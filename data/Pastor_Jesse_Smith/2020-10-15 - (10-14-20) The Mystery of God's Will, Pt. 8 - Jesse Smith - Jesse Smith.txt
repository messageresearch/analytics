[Music] appreciate that let's go to a scripture here i'd like to look at the mystery of god's will you know sunday morning we finished that little series there on uh proving all things i'd like to get back and finish a couple more series or whether i can finish a mystery of god's will tonight or sunday or i'm sorry next wednesday and then try to finish the philippians series and then we'll see where the lord takes us after that god's grace so i'd like to go to uh first corinthians 12 let's go back we'll finish a couple gifts of the spirit tonight lord willing and then we'll move on past that thank you first corinthians 12. i don't have any slides in case you will be pulling up probably numerous scriptures tonight god's grace first corinthians 12. so by god's grace we're on verse 10 first corinthians 12 10. but i can start there right first corinthians 12 10. let's all read 10 and 11 together thank you for helping out carrots on the scripture in the bible all right that's read ten eleven on three one two three to another the working of miracles to another prophecy to another discerning of spirits to another diverse kinds of tongues to another the interpretation of tongues but all these worketh that one and the self-same spirit dividing to every man severally as he will may god add his blessings to the ring of his word you may be seated praise god so let's uh look to the lord here and we'll uh minister on this thought here continue on the mystery of god's will last time it was part seven we looked at uh the first few gifts of the holy spirit uh we looked at uh wisdom knowledge faith uh then healing last time miracles and prophecy and tonight we'll look at discernment of spirits and diverse kinds of tongues and interpretations and then we're willing if we get through that uh just give a little testimony about god's will and we'll look at rewards and consequences rewards for accepting the mystery and then consequences for rejecting the mystery so by god's grace tonight we'll look at discernment now the gift of discernment it judges or distinguishes between the source or motivation behind actions uh prophecies or words so when someone has the gift of discernment they're able by god's spirit to tell the source why did the person uh act that way why did the person prophesy that why did the person say that or why did the person do that the gift of discernment judges the source or motivation uh behind an action just like first corinthians i'm sorry just like uh hebrews 4 12 says the word of god is cup is cut uh it cuts sharp it's sharper than a double-edged sword it discerns the joints and bones of the marrow and divides asunder the soul and spirit and so that's a perfect scripture about the gift of discernment praise god and it divides and shows it judges the thoughts and intents of the heart and so it's able to tell which is wonderful it's able to tell is it from the holy spirit or is it from a fallen spirit right that's what discernment's able to do it judges is this from a true spirit of god or is this a fallen demonic spirit of god and it's able to identify it so it's able to tell also whether it's a spirit of divination a lying spirit a greedy spirit a lustful spirit a jealous spirit one of those is able to divide and discern and tell which spirit it is okay so this gift it judges publicly also anything that's announced publicly like prophecies or interpretations of unknown tongues uh the scripture says first corinthians 14 29 did you put it up there first corinthians 14 29 what a level of maturity i think we ended uh part seven with that idea what maturity is it going to take for uh someone to stand up in our audience and foretell the future or discern someone's action and then what maturity is going to take after that for people to judge and say that person was right or wrong if the lord allows these all these gifts to be manifested in the service before the coming of the lord we know it does happen at certain times uh hasn't happened for us in a while uh but nevertheless god is the same yesterday today and forever the bible said let the prophets speak two or three and let the other judge can go to the next verse verse 30 if anything be revealed to another that sitteth by let the first hold his peace okay so it's it's true maturity gifts are often looked down upon sometimes by people but really when they're operated the right way it's the it's a true expression of christian maturity because they're able to judge and and discern people's intentions like brother ryan was able to judge that woman who said well i've got a word from the lord right after i go to get my hair done i got to get my my next permanent remember brother i told that story a woman said well i'll have a message from the lord billy once i get my hair colored and once i get my hair done the right way and brother man discern right away that was the wrong spirit and it kept trying to interrupt brother bran was preaching and lamb said he had to tell that person to sit down right because it was trying to interrupt the preaching of the word okay and so uh and then people after the service remember they came up to brother branham and they said oh you're blasting the holy spirit i said brother branson how can i blaspheme when the word of god says the spirit is subject to the prophets and the prophet uh knew that that that message wasn't to come at that time uh but what a maturity it's gonna take for us uh to be able lord willing in the future to be able to do this to publicly announce messages to people but then have to judge and sit there and judge and say was this from god or is this not from god and then uh live with the consequences right you have to live with the consequences and if it's uh if it was right then we rejoice if it's wrong then it's time to repent like i said it hasn't happened much um as far as publicly you know we see it more one-on-one in conversations you can judge people's spirits many times and their actions one-on-one uh but it does happen from time to time so this is uh the gift of like it's like a sword and it divides a man's soul and spirit and discerns the thoughts and tents of the heart uh now it also tells the private secrets of the heart like with brother branham's gift of discernment right and jesus with the woman at the well and jesus with nathanael right uh he said philip he's philip once nathaniel said come and see right and when philip got there jesus said i saw you are you under the fig tree right and he said i know you're the messiah he said if you believe this you're going to see much more than this praise god so it judged it right away it judged where he was it told him things and secrets that only nathanael could know only the woman at the well could know and that was a a sign of a gift praise god now you remember solomon used a sermon to reveal the good intentions of the real mother of the baby when another woman falsely claimed to be its mother so there it revealed the intentions right a real mother doesn't want to see their baby lost right but the mother uh who wasn't the real mother she didn't care whether the baby was divided or not but the real mother cared so the gift of discernment shows who really cares praise god it shows uh who is the the real owner of something praise god in this case a mother of children and then we already mentioned him nathanael nathanael had a guileless spirit think about that jesus said you have nothing wrong in your spirit think about that you have no pretense you're not pretending at all that's what jesus said he said you have no guile in your spirit what a compliment oh i want that to be my i want that to be my testimony don't you want that too where jesus would say you're not a pretender you're as genuine as they come praise god like they say you're true blue praise god he said nathanael was guileless there's no guile in your spirit but he also had to show the woman her five uh six men that were immoral and she said surely thou art a prophet so judge those spirits right and judge them uh peter exercised discernment when he revealed ananias's secret lie and sapphira secret lie and also simon the sorcerer's wicked heart condition we looked at a few services ago that was such a striking scripture my he bapped he was baptized and simon the sorcerer and he followed them he believed but then when it came time uh where he saw power operating he wanted to buy the power and peter said you're in the bitterness of heart what a bitter heart condition and so see church words many times tell what's in people's hearts right the things people want and i'll say like this the things they spend their money on many times reveals what's in their heart right or what they're willing to spend their money on like one time somebody told me oh i think it's okay to have to spend 20 000 on a hairdo and i thought what kind of what kind of spirit is that i thought instantly i thought well my spirit judges that that's the wrong spirit when you know people are hungry and dying and uh starving and can't can't pay for their rent and you spend twenty thousand dollars on one haircut and i thought that instantly judged it and then i found culture brother branham said that's evil you know he said something along those lines where it's evil but he's just instantly see people's words many times express the conditions of their heart whether it's a a good heart right it's a heart with a a true heart right with understanding and honesty or it's a heart of thorns right and cares of the world and and pleasures of this world or it's a heart that has a uh a heart that has a stony ground right and it's never gonna produce anything right it's just gonna be there for a little while and then it's gonna get dried out so many times church we catch people's spirits by the things they say like the one time when the preacher fell away a famous preacher in ohio fell away uh we had i had six things i knew he was wrong one thing he let his children listen to rock and roll with headphones i knew that was wrong i discerned that right away he let the women cut their hair and wear makeup just in a little bit just a little bit uh a little levin levin's a whole lump right and there was uh he oh he made fun of a brother who our brother brooks he made from front of brother brooks there's four things already i can't remember the other two things uh oh yeah you talk you got the holy ghost when you believe the uh the god that brother man was a prophet there's five out of six so my my buzzer's going off constantly around that person and eventually they leave the message and fall away and so what does that the the spirit of discernment does that it judges the source behind those words and so peter did that he he discerned simon the sorcerer's wicked heart condition when he wanted to have a gift that god didn't ordain him to have uh sinners recognize god's spirit when their secrets are revealed through gifts of prophecy i remember the one time we had a brother when we first moved back into this sanctuary we had a brother visit he used to be from the lima area and i preached on king saul we were in this sanctuary right here i remember he kind of sat in the back in the middle and i still remember his name and everything too but i appreciate all the song i didn't know why i was preaching on saul i was preaching on that series on psalm david and i was just showing how saul fell short of the glory of god and out in the parking lot the brother come up and was crying and saying you preached my whole life today and uh he got caught in abuse case and he was actually heading to jail and he spent time in jail he said that was me i thought i had all of god's blessings in the message but then i i i took the wrong decision and it ruined my entire life and he said he spent years and in debauchery and years uh in uh uh basically regret regretting but what did the word what did the word do it discerned his life praise god it judged his life his jaw his life was a saw life but our lives should be a day in life right men and women after the heart of god but without the stumbling right right because we've got more power in the new testament praise god amen hallelujah amen so uh it's clear the word of god shows the secrets and so we had a i say like someone who's backslidden their secrets were revealed during the word of the word of god is being preached and then we had a dream of some saints in our church a few years ago they had a dream that wolves were attacking them uh and the bible says that uh evil spirits are like wolves in acts 20 29 and 30. so case if you can pull that one up so right at that very moment um they had these they had this dream where wolves were attacking them and then other people in the church were at that time were around and so they were connected to the wolves so can you pull that up acts 20 29 and 30. okay i can actually 20 29 and 30. all right thank you uh 29 for this i know that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you not spring the flock verse 30 also of your own self shall men arise speaking perverse things to draw away uh disciples after them and uh the very moment after uh this this couple sent me the text i had just told my wife i i was talking about a problem in the church i said i said these i said this family's acting like wolves and then i got the text that very minute the very minute uh where this couple had a dream and it was about this situation and so that judged it completely because when the word of god came to judge it they admitted they were wrong and uh we were on the right side by god's grace so that's what discernment does it judges it reveals the source behind actions praise god and i love that god using dreams god using uh word and discernment he does it all the time and then another saint uh god help me discern uh uh they were they had a lying spirit on them one of our former church members when they requested permission to share their false teachings and in front of the church they want to do that and they kind of lied about it they kind of said oh i just want to give a testimony but they lied about it because they wanted to inject some false doctrine to draw disciples after themselves and to a church that they thought was right but see i just the holy spirit just gave me uh that that buzzer that ring went off and just discerned it and said that's not the right spirit that's not what the holy spirit would do i remember that one time i told you about down in north carolina we were having a wonderful time at the altar a member at tim humes church and a sister came up and tried to tug remember that guys tug the the mic right out of the pastor's hand the pastor said they're like no that's the wrong spirit and we had to it was really quite a situation and we had to go in the back afterwards and she eventually repented back there young she could have been 15 maybe 20 years old and she just had a burden to try to correct her friend but she wanted to do it in the wrong way at the wrong time uh basically wanted to tell her friend that she was uh going into sin but uh that was the wrong time and place the wrong time in place that's not the right uh the the woman shouldn't take while while the pastor is trying to get people to repent and get them to the altar and someone shouldn't come up and interrupt the pastor right because everything should be done decently in an order praise god all right so that's just a few simple examples where the holy spirit will discern the right time it'll discern uh the spirit behind people's decisions or can give dreams to do discernment all kinds of things where it does good where it gives us clear discernment but as i said on sunday remember there's times we don't always have discernment right our gifts don't operate every single day in every single situation right like judas is scared at the last supper the disciples didn't discern him remember we talked about that on sunday and so what would you say oh the the disciples don't have discernment no god just didn't anoint them for that moment to have it right and then they had to live with it afterwards they heard judas left and they had to live with it afterwards they didn't have discernment for every moment and so it's kind of like uh it's kind of this idea you know we want god to be able to use gifts in our lives but we can't force god to do it praise god it's got to be god's time and it's got to be god's season we can't keep uh we can't force god to do anything uh we have but we have to be uh set aside that's what the word sanctified means set aside consecrated set in a holy place so god can use us when he wants to use us all right so just uh that idea there where discernment is an automatic of something that happens every single time all right now that's the gift of discernment let's go to tongues now tongues allow believers to speak in unknown or known human languages or even unknown tongues of angels jesus promised believers would speak in new tongues in mark 16 17 did you pull up their acacia it'd just be good to read that jesus promised believers would speak in new tongues um now they're only for public when they're interpreted and judged but if they're young gifts that we encourage them to be public right until uh we get an interpreter so mark 16 17 and these signs shall follow them that believe and the church said amen praise god in my name they shall cast out devils they shall speak with new tongues praise god so it's a bible promise from jesus now we in the message are so we're so sure that we're not going to beg god to uh every service to speak in tongues right like that was my experience growing up we had tongues in every service and if not you know the people didn't think we had a good service that was my experience and and my church taught well you got a jib jabber say something over and over till you speak in tongues right but we're talk over and over in the message uh to not make tongues and evidence because that was the false doctrine of this day right that's the false doctrine this day but yet the bible does say that this will be one of the signs that follow believers praise god and so it accompanies the gift so just like we should see casting out devils we should also have those speaking with new tongues praise god it's part of the gifts that accompany the church okay so you can go to the next verse verse 18. and they'll take up serpents if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover we see of course that one the most uh but everything else is a part of that these all follow uh believers praise god now if if if the condition gets like denominational churches then tongues without interpretations create a barbaric insane atmosphere according to paul paul says it's just barbaric no one even knows what's talking it reminds us of the tower of babel right that's what it reminds us of when everyone's speaking in unknown tongues and there's no interpretation uh so without an interpreter they're strictly for private prayer and individual edification god now first corinthians 12 30. can you pull it up there acacia uh clearly teaches not all christians speak with tongues okay so let's read that one first corinthians 12 30. it says uh have all gifts of healing do all speak with tongues do all interpret this ends almost every argument i've ever had or any debate about tongues because he clearly says not all speak with tongues but yet paul supported prophetic tongue so let's go to first corinthians 14 1-5 yet he truly supported prophetic tongues this is what we were saying a few weeks ago when we looked at this series that this is something that our church can pray for right our church should pray for uh prophecies uh for for all the operation of the gifts because the most people are going to be helped when something applies to all of us and prophecy normally applies to all of us because it will foretell us what's going to happen so we can make writing praise god follow after charity verse 1 and desire the spiritual gifts but rather that ye may prophesy for he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men but unto god for no man understandeth him but howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries but he that prophesies speaketh unto men to edification to exhortation and comfort he that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifies himself but he that prophesieth edifieth the church okay so paul clearly says the greater gift is prophecy because it helps everybody know the future praise god and again that's something we have to desire the bible said the reason we may not see it is because the bible says we don't desire it verse 1 desire the spiritual gifts but rather that ye may prophesy i don't know i don't know about you but remember when van's dad was sick were we desiring a healing or not we prayed for it every service right for three weeks until it came we'll see it seems many times the gifts we desire most are divine healing and so we see it more but if we desire prophecy how many believe we'll see it more i believe that if we desire these gifts if we desire more people to be blessed more people to be edified i believe god will hear those prayers i believe that i remember you know the last time we had tongues in 2010 i remember that if i'm not mistaken 2010 trying to think of the exact date maybe it was a little bit earlier i remember i was preaching on uh the gifts of i was doing a series on the gifts of the holy spirit and i remember the wednesday night before that before the easter uh it was at that waterloo church that tiny little church hole in the wall church that wednesday night at the end of service i danced around the front and i just praised god and i went to columbus i took my family to columbus that sunday and then the brother came in brother stephen came in and we still got on tape where he gave a unknown tongue and interpretation and it told that uh some people were dying spiritually and i but but that was the thought and i thought it was so striking i was just preaching on gifts and the anointing and all these i think i preached 34 gifts or 34 sermons on gifts and as i we i just got free in the spirit and we're just worshiping and the very next service we had a operation of unknown tongues interpretations i thought wow that i thought perhaps the minds of the people were in that mode right they were they were hearing about gifts they were stirred up about gifts i know i was because i was preaching on it right and then it happened and so the bible says desire them but desire that more people may be edified that the most people can be strengthened amen hallelujah and so paul strongly supports prophecy praise god and again the most recent one i've heard was 2013 when brother brooks prophesied those uh well-known preachers dying that was the most recent prophecy that i can remember as far as we're telling the future uh on the day of pentecost 120 spirit-filled believers spoke in their native galilean tongues but here's from 17 different regions heard them in their own language so all tongues were known and understood the modern churches of course air greatly they have instant constant uninterrupted unknown tongues and public services and all he leads to is confusion and chaos uh which god does not offer i remember in height in college i went with a couple of football players so my buddies won this church and at the end they all just spoke in tongues and prophesied i just had my head down and one of the guys who went on to the nfl went on to win a couple super bowls he came up afterwards and asked me said jesse was that right and i had to tell no that wasn't right uh because the bible says that leads to confusion and chaos and god is not the author of that but i'll say it like this uh i like at least that they're open to spiritual things happening right i like that don't you i like how they at least come to church expecting something supernatural to happen praise god that's what we need praise god we need constant revival amen that's what we need hallelujah they're wrong with it but i thank god that they're at least coming expecting something supernatural to happen that's a wonderful testimony i think now while peter preached in cornelius house the holy ghost fell upon the hearers who spoke in tongues and magnified god i'm going to read that acts 10 48. let's read that so see this is why we had that uh sermon we preached uh last month about the see and hear principle whenever the holy ghost fell you could see it you could hear it you would magnify god uh i'll say i said you know what let me read verse 46 for they heard them speak with tongues and magnify god and then answered peter can any man forbid water that they will be baptized we just sing that song magnify the lord with me right and so when the holy ghost fell it caused them to speak in tongues and also magnify god amen because jesus said it's like a well it's like a well springing up and the water flows praise god it's like it's like you turn on the faucet praise god and the water comes pouring out amen that's the that's the holy spirit when they're born again the praises come out the glory comes out and the words come out you've got to praise your heavenly father the baby's got to call out the father i'm a father papa god amen and that's the word of the lord that we see from the scripture now acts 19 what a tremendous uh testimony of the 12 ephesians they spoke in tongues and prophesied what an encouragement to that church right because remember prophecy helps out the most people so all 12 must have been helped right or a large group of them the prophecy foretold something that was going to happen and no doubt it must have happened because the holy spirit doesn't lie how many can say amen to that the holy spirit does not lie so he spoke in a tongue prophesied and no doubt it came to pass because when you speak in the name of the lord it must come to pass if the conditions are met yeah we can say that too praise god so again tongues prophecy all go together and then the bible says if you speak in tongues and there's uh not an interpreter pray for the interpretation that's first corinthians 14 13. occasion can you hold it up there first corinthians 14 13. and this will be the last verse here first corinthians 14 13. wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret and so when i've seen that at churches and they all speak in tongues they never pray for interpretation they just pray in tongues and then move on and everybody seems to be enthusiastic but there's no prayer for the interpretation well there ought to be more prayer for the interpretations that more people can understand it praise god amen now interpretation of tongues we don't need to go in that gift because it's already directly connected to diverse kinds of tongues uh it takes uh someone just someone who has freely just speaks in tongues the other person just freely knows what to say i talked to one man i forget who it was now but he had the gift of interpretation it must have been from a denominational church and he said i just opened my mouth and the words come out he said i don't even know what i'm saying so the same thing is like with uh speaking in tongues right when it comes out many times you're not even sure what you're saying it just comes out right it just flows out and so i talked to that man i was just so impressed i was like wow he just opens his mouth now talk about trusting god right but that's the same kind of trust you have in god like if you have the gift of healing and you know someone's going to get healed when you pray for them right other people might be like oh how in the world could you do that how could you be so sure well god god was possessing my body amen god was possessing my mind he was possessing my thoughts he was possessing my words amen his word was in my mouth hallelujah amen that's that's how you know right it just he just takes all over praise god you're so possessed you're so filled that you're just yielded to the holy spirit my mother what i'm saying that's the greatest thing you can do is be united right master the human ability and be yielded to the holy spirit praise god so remember we follow charity so first we seek being born again and then desire the spiritual gifts and love is our absolute motivation we're commanded to desire uh and covet the best gifts the bible said first corinthians 12 31 but earn it covet earnestly the best gifts yet i show yet show i unto you a more excellent way so we follow charity desire spiritual gifts earnestly covet the best gifts and this is something that i i feel like as message believers we have to be very concerned about right uh because a gift is like a it's like a portion of god's money right a gift is the word charisma it means uh a talent right it means something divine it means the divine gift of god and if god has entrusted us with a divine gift then we need to be accountable with it praise god we need to be uh responsible for it like i told you i've been entrusted with so many thousands of dollars for the book coming up i haven't spent it yet i'm entrusted with it i got to make sure it's spent the right way it's still sitting in the bank account right the church bank account can't touch it i'm just entrusted with it i got to make sure that's used the right way praise god and so it is with our lives if we have a gift we have to make sure it's used for god's glory and the thing is we've got to make sure we're available uh and we let make ourselves available for god to use us praise god like i said i don't know when this i don't know when this revival is going to come but i hope it's sometime soon in my lifetime praise god well i'm talking about the squeeze where we start seeing the third pole we start having this pressure right this this desire to get closer to god the desire to see the gifts operate right the desire for prophecy my think of it i mean that's what we want to see right we want to see the mighty god come on the scene we appreciate all he does for us we're so thankful for all he does for us but we look at the bible and the bible says we're to covet earnestly these best things we're to desire these great things where desire to hear prophecy and if we hadn't heard it for a while we should desire it praise god because the bible says desire prophecy that we can know the future that the whole church can be blessed amen and then the other side is maybe god doesn't want to send it at this time but yet we're still we're still supposed to desire it we're still supposed to be hungering and thirsting for god's gifts to operate all right now i want to read this quote brother branham uh gave us about gifts again i pulled it up here on my phone yeah it is the man said the church must believe every word every promise every iota and claim it for themselves and exercise themselves in it if i was engaged to a girl and i was a single man and i'd send her something an engagement ring and she wouldn't wear it then that show she doesn't believe me she doesn't want to be my bride and if christ sends his church the gifts that he promised and they refuse them and say they're not so they don't want to be the bride of christ their spouse is some other lover and not christ the bridegroom so the real church keeps the promise and keeps all and accepts the gifts that god sends them amen so see that's got to be our desire like a uh a spouse woman accepting the marriage uh ring right or the the engagement ring wow i'm gonna i'm gonna use this i'm gonna i'm gonna wear this uh i'm gonna possess this and that's what our attitude has to be with the gifts of god i'm gonna wear this i'm gonna let god use me like this praise god i'm gonna let god use me publicly for his glory and also of course privately as well so we must study our way we must uh study our gifts that we have in our lives and help god to help us or ask god to help us operate in them and we want to have a double return on our investment matthew 25 21 i'll turn there matthew 25 21 with a parable the talents i think 25 21. all right let's read actually 22 i'm sorry 20 20 verse 20 as well and so that he had received five talents came and brought other five talents saying lord thou deliver us unto me five talents behold i have gained beside them five talents more his lord said to him well done thou good and faithful servant thou hast been faithful over a few things i'll make thee ruler over many things enter thou into the joy of the lord he also that had received two talents came and said lord thou deliver us unto me two talents behold i have gained two other talents beside them he said unto i'm sorry his lord said unto him well done good and faithful servant thou hast been faithful over a few things i'll make the ruler over many things enter thou into the joy of the lord then he which i received the one talent came and said lord i knew that thou art a hard man see like like they say uh our brother ramsay's god carries a a stick right a big stick see they're making god out to be this this this really angry person but he has to correct us right and so this is the kind of attitude that buries a talent in the ground reaping where thou is not sown and gathering whether that's not straw and i was afraid and went and hid thy town in the earth lo there thou hast that is thine so fear right fear kept this person from operating their god-given talents and so the only way to get rid of fear is to have love right because love casts out all fear praise god how do you fall in love more jesus keep his commands praise god keep his commands uh fellowship with him open your heart to him right let jesus come in sup with him and he with you all right so we see it's uh investment into the spiritual gifts how many want to be jesus bride then we've got to wear the wedding got to wear the wedding gear praise god the engagement ring and anything else jesus gives us we got to wear it so let's go back quickly are you wearing it uh are you wearing the the ring of wisdom tonight gotta wear it gotta show it right gotta show the world are you wearing the ring of knowledge tonight we gotta show it you gotta say god thank you lord thank you let me let me be a light and everybody knows i'm married to you jesus and not bury that not take off that ring and put it away in the drawer and forget about it so nobody sees it we got to be available for god to use us praise god god say lord use me in my home use me at the church use me on the job amen use me at school are you wearing the engagement ring of faith do you have faith that moves mountains how about healing divine healing where you pray for the sick and eventually they recover how about the ring of miracles where god anoints your faith and instantly things happen right there you don't have to wait happens right there miracles how about prophecy like i said this one's hard to come by right you have the ring of prophecy where god anoints you to foretell the future or how about the ring of discernment being able to judge what is that person's motive what is that person's objective which spirit is behind this person's words or actions are we letting uh jesus's ring shine praise god and how about uh tongues are we speaking when god wants us to speak are we willing to open our mouths and speak are we willing to open our mouths and interpret right are we in the ring of god's tongue's interpretation and so that's a good uh that's a good summary of that as bill graham says if we're jesus's bride we'll wear the ring praise god we'll accept what he's given to us and we'll study it we'll invest it and we'll know what we got on how anyone know what they got on praise god amen praise god you ever heard of anybody any man giving a woman a wife an engagement ring and she don't even know what it looks like or anything i mean that's the whole point of it right so you can see what it looks like and see how pretty it is and man they spent some money on me they must really love me not that you know that right that really means anything you know as far as natural things of gold and uh you know money or diamonds or anything like that but it's the idea behind it's the love behind it and so jesus wants us to show everybody our life we have to be that city on a hill that cannot be hidden praise god so don't let your wisdom be hidden right don't let the tongues be hidden don't let the miracles or the prophecy or the faith don't let that be hidden or the word of knowledge we cannot let these things go hidden in our lives we gotta let god we gotta let we gotta wear it so then god can use it all right now uh the next part of this chapter after uh defining the gifts and giving examples uh i share how i feel i found god's will for my life i'm almost 40 married with eight children how humbly how do i believe that i'm in the perfect will of god for my life how would i how would i judge that well i look at relationships i i first talk about my wife and i'm meeting in the sandbox you know we both repented and got saved on the same night and then we were both open to god changing uh our desires but we prayed about it we had multiple meetings with pastors and marriage couples we didn't jump into anything we didn't hurry into anything right we waited for god's peace to settle in our hearts and lives we looked at each other's strengths and weaknesses and uh and felt led then to get married and that's still the second happiest day of my life right after the day we got saved there's four that's 40 minutes already goodness somebody tell that clock he's a busy busy body and he needs to stop stop turning so fast uh let me try to yeah let me finish this and i'll close here uh so relationships so again you don't rush into it but yet we know people that have known right away like brother cam he and julian knew right away that at the court very long they just knew right away they were to be married by the will of god and so we have to look at our relationships is that in the will of god i like uh i shouldn't share that that's more personal i shouldn't share that one so i won't share that one um but i'll say this many times the relationship is where people fall away from the perfect will of god now understand that how sad is that people are willing to live in the permissive will of god on this earth knowingly living in the permissive will of god and just hope for heaven someday i can imagine that just for some temporary earthly pleasures they're willing to forsake god's perfect will where they could they they could manifest god's presence greater than any other way they'd rather enjoy some fleshly pleasures rather than do god's perfect will that illustration francis chan used he had a rope and it was stretched across the entire platform and he colored the very end of it red and he said this is your life this red line this red painted part of the rope way over here this is your earthly life and you're gonna live in pleasure for that little red part and and not take into consideration the rest of this rope that stretches all the way across you're gonna you're gonna try to live in pleasure and and you're gonna take a chance with the rest of that rope just in that little bit of time there at the beginning of the rope the bible says make your calling and election sure praise god the bible says set your affections on things above we should look at the rope of our lives right and see that little red line and say wow i want that red line to count for jesus so i can live eternally with jesus christ praise god i think that's a great illustration i've always wanted to get him rope and do that i just forget about it that little air that little place is so important now vocations i thought i would be a doctor boy was i wrong on that when i got to school i thought i could never do that that many classes but i walk into a classroom and i fall in love with the kids i didn't even know what i was about to do and then god opened up the teaching job for me after prayer and fasting and seeking the lord going to church there was 800 applicants for two positions and i got one of them with no with no experience so that was all god and then we do the bible clubs the last five years of course they're canceled now but hundreds of children and teens have heard the gospel because i've got the job there and i thank the lord for that and i even got to baptize three people in the name of the lord jesus christ i've invited them for bible studies and more to come to church they haven't come but i got to at least baptize them in the name of the lord jesus christ the first case second was pastoring when we started the church here in 2006 we waited on the lord and then felt led to it brother brooks ordained it and so it's all been done according to the god we know churches where uh there wasn't a preacher that started the church the family just part of the church and no one ordained it but that's not apostolic apostolic is having a preacher ordain another preacher right because he sees the gift of god he's got to get through god and that gift of god recognizes another gift of god and so that's the way the early church started paul told titus few ordained elders in every city titus was a pastor you ordained so pastors ordained pastors right or it could be missionaries yeah apostles ordained pastors and so it started the right way i believe by god's grace and i prayed and fasted before preaching so i can look at my vocations and i believe i'm in the perfect will of god i can't think of a time where i missed god's will now the next is your location i've only lived in two places in my life toledo and akron and i didn't ask to come to akron god opened that up use football to bring me here but of course we know i know the reason was greater it was a spiritual purpose i left everything i ever knew and loved and god showed me his love and i got saved into akron or here in columbus and then back to akron and i've never felt god's leading to leave this city at all now some people remember we looked at abraham he had 15 times he moved at least 15 times each time sometimes it was his will sometimes it was god's will right but a christian is open to god's leading right god leading you somewhere else or god keeping you in one place a christian is open to that uh and many times church with with with people in the permissive with the god they're running from where they should be right like a lot of people i've seen people they move away from a good church everybody needs a home church every sheep needs a shepherd right but many times people get in the permissive will of god because they move away from where god wanted them usually for money like lot right or maybe because of hard times and it's a test like abraham when the famine came he failed the test and went down to egypt and lied about his wife and he's gotten all kinds of trouble right because of pressures and cares of the world and so it takes it takes courage it takes faith to stay where god's called you right and to find where god's called you and also to move if god calls you some other place the next is ministries my main my family's main ministries to provide three weekly church services and then of course fellowships and everything and my children serve in the music ministry can you pull up a second chronicles i'm sorry first chronicles 25 1. i remember the scripture i don't know if you remember the scripture but i want to read this one again here tonight first chronicles 25 1-6 moreover david and the captains of the host separated to the service of the sons of asaph and of he-man and of uh judathon who should prophesy with harps with sultries and with symbols and the number of the workmen according to their service and in verse two he gives those who prophesied according to the order of the king verse three i'm going to skip that who prophesied with a harp to give thanks and praise to the lord so david ordains all these people some had the gift of prophesy in verse two some have the gift to prophesy with harp in verse three and some gave thanks and praise to the lord everybody had to give now look at that some people had a gift to give thanks some people had a gift to give praise amen some people had a gift to prophesy right so everybody has a place but we got to find our place amen and then the one i like is about the children verse four of command these are his sons and now go to verse five all these were the sons of haman the king's seer in the words of god to lift up the horn and god gave him and fourteen sons and three daughters all these were under the hands of their father for song in the house of the lord with symbols sultries and harps for the service of the house of god according to the king's order to asap jeduthan and haman and the number of them with their brethren that were instructed in the songs the lord even all that were cunning was 200 four score and eight 288. god had 288 people just focus on the music ministry talk about a revival my 288 people that were born the bible said they were born right the bible said they were under the head of their father in the house of lord for the service of the house of god they were born and david placed them in the house of god for music for thanks for prophecy for harps amen god did that praise god and so god does the same today i feel like that scripture really speaks to me with my eight children uh that our children my wife and i our children are for song in the house of the lord for the service of the house of god now if you gave me a choice tonight and i i could have all my sports talents or playing the piano like malachi i would trade and malachi could have the sports and i would take the piano my wife knows i like i pretend like i could sing like all these guys all the time right you know air guitar there's something part of me i wish i could do that and we know that's way more important right that's way more valuable than natural things but yet god had a plan for it god can use it uh to get you to where get me to where he wanted me to be but that's a ministry and uh you can see from the scripture a man had all these children in order that they could praise god amen that was his ministry his family's ministry was the praise give thanks to god worship god prophesy with harps and lift up the name of the lord that was god's will for his life amen it's my joy through the preaching and the deacon work and the financial work and some of the trusty work it's my joy to do that our church also supports missionaries the poor needy bible studies whatever people need it's been a while since we had some but uh people every now and then need them and then the video making ministry the book ministry that's uh taking the gospel spreading the truth the bible says preachers are to proclaim the gospel right we herald the gospel which means announce the gospel and that's what those ministries do they announce the true revelation they announce the word of god for this hour remember i waited on that for almost 10 years i waited on that ministry of the books and the video making ministry and then also the gifts of the holy spirit i've a lot of those examples i gave were from my own life where i've seen god use me through preaching and faith healing miracles discernment but john 15 5 is is my uh life scripture jesus said i am the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and i in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me ye can do nothing praise god church you and i are nothing without jesus we have no talent we have no money we have no ability without jesus we're absolutely nothing and jesus is everything praise god when gifts are you search we feel unconscious of it right many times we're just unconscious because god gently and mercifully anoints us to help other people i told you sometimes i feel extremely zealous that's something many times that's happened i'm zealous but sometimes it's gentle sometimes it's merciful uh in any supernatural work jesus he captures our entire thought process process right the bible said be transformed by the renewing of your mind and then you can prove the perfect will of god so in all these areas right with ministries and family and location and vocation and and gifts of the holy spirit all these can be proven it's either the perfect will or it's the permissible of god but it takes a transformed mind to do that as we said you lay yourself on god's altar present your body living sacrifice lay aside your thoughts your time your plans your preferences and then be a living sacrifice with a transformed mind i'm gonna have to finish this next time let's stay in our feet because i i kind of want to go further i better stop so i got to work tomorrow i got a long day tomorrow i got like a 12-hour day tomorrow we got conferences so i don't want to kill or kill myself or anything like that musicians if you'll come by god's grace so church sharing all that i asked myself and i've asked the readers lord willing uh have i missed god's will for my life in any of those areas have i refused any open doors have i broken any command now i've fallen short in areas of my life but as far as where i live and my job and uh my family my marriage my gifts i don't i look at that and i i can't see where i have have i refused any open door i don't i haven't seen one have i broken any major command that's the question i ask myself and that's the question i want all of us ask ourselves as we look at on sunday night with blessings and curses some mistakes they will have a lasting punishment right others are smaller and they don't have that lasting impact but that's the that's the question we need to ask lord am i doing your perfect will i want to know your perfect will so let's go our heads and let's ask the lord that in a word of prayer tonight [Music] heavenly father god would just come reverently again before your throne as we bring a close to the preaching of your word lords and i have declared more of your gifts i finished the gifts as you've taught me through study as i've labored in doctrine as that scripture comes to my mind [Music] you show me all these examples you reminded me of all these examples lord your prophet said they're like weddings engage your friends we recognize god that you've sent these gifts in our lives the bible says they're given to every man and every woman the
