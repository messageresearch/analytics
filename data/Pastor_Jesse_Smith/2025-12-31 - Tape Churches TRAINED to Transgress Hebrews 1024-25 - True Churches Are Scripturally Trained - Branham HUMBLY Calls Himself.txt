TRANSCRIPT
========================================
These people claim to believe every word that you say to be true, but they don't. They don't believe it. They are own actions prove that they don't. The gospel sounds in the purity of its word and of its manifestation. And still they don't get it. They can't understand it. They're not trained to that sound of the Bible. They're tr trained to some denominational creed instead of the sound of the Bible. Therefore, when the Bible sounds it out, they don't know what you're talking about. Greetings, friends, in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ. [music] Is God training his people to sit at home and not [music] physically attend church anymore? I believe the answer is no. And this video will rightly divide the word of truth from the Bible about church [music] attendance as well as quotes from God's true prophet, brother William Marin Brandham. So here's the outline for the video. We'll look at Bible teaching and brother Random quotes that agree with Bible teaching [music] regarding church attendance. And then second, we'll look at the possible origin of this false doctrine, which I believe is a doctrine of the nicotans to sit at home and not physically gather in church services. And then third, we'll look at quotes from brother Brandham that use the word training in them. So the first two verses that are very important are Hebrews 10:24 and 25. And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works. So people that don't assemble are selfish because they're not considering others on how they can provoke them or stir them up to more love for God and each other and also to good works for God. Verse 25, not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is, but exhorting one another and so much the more as you see that day approaching. So the Bible asks us to do it more and more, gather together more with believers of like precious faith. And the Bible says we exhort one another when we do that. The word exhort means to comfort, to console, to encourage and strengthen. So people that sit at home like the current Brightham Tabernacle and don't physically attend church are losing out on consolation, comfort, and encouragement. No matter how much they tried to deny it, it's true because the Bible's true. The Bible is the absolute. And when you transgress the Bible, you are transgressing the very king of heaven, the Lord Jesus Christ. For he is the word. The Bible is the word of God on paper to us. This reminds me also of Matthew 15 here. Matthew 15:2 and3. Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders for they washing not their hands when they eat bread? But he answered and said unto them, why do you also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition? So it's been a tradition of the leaders of Brandham Tabernacle for many years, not just since 2020 when CO happened. Even before that, a lot of the leaders from Random Tabernacle did not physically attend church. That's been their tradition for decades. So for decades, the leaders of Brandham Tabernacle would not physically gather in a home church, but then around 2015 to 2020, they did. But now we see from March 2020 to the present here, 2026, they failed to physically gather in church. So that's their tradition. It's a tradition of man. It's not a tradition of God. And then Luke 4:16, "And he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up. And as his custom was, he went to the synagogue on the Sabbath day and stood up for to read. So the custom of God in flesh, the custom of Emmanuel, Jesus Christ, the almighty God in flesh, was to go to the synagogue on the Sabbath. So he would go to the synagogue every Saturday. But we know according to Acts chapter 20, the church gathers now on the first day of the week, Sunday. So if Jesus was here, he'd go to church every Sunday just like he went to church every Saturday. Now friends, there also is a truth that the early church did meet for church services in individual houses. Like Romans 16:5 says, "Likewise, greet the church that is in their house." 1 Corinthians 16:19, "Aquil and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord with the church that is in their house." But this is a different kind of house church than Brenham Tabernacle. Brethren Tabernacle, they stay in their own separate houses. They don't gather multiple families in one house. So they're not following the biblical pattern. And of course as time went on and we moved into the Leodysian church age, the industrial revolution. Now we have the ability to build churches. And so brother Bram's custom during his life was to physically gather in the church, not sit at home and press play. Brother Ram never did that. Brother Ram never taught that. The Bible never taught that. So anyone who does that is transgressing the word of God. All these Bible verses that we've read so far by the grace of God. Friends, last year I put out numerous videos about physically gathering in church and how the current Brandham tabernacle breaks all those commandments from the Bible and commandments from God's prophet, Brother Brandham. Brother Ram said the awfulst cult won't go to church and won't work. Well, it seems like Brandham tabernacle people still work. But the other element to that awful cult, that cult mentality is not physically attending church. So, they're guilty of that. It's an awful cult. There's the quotes from brother Brandham where he says you cannot be as good of a Christian if you stay at home and don't physically go to church. He said it's like saying you're hungry but you won't go to the table to eat. That's what brother Ram said physically attending church is like. Well, you say I want to hear the word of God. I want to hear the purest form of the word of God. I want to hear the voice of God. But you won't go to the table. You won't go to the local church to hear the preaching of the word of God because faith only comes by hearing the word of God. Brother Graham said, "If the preaching won't pep you up, nothing will." And that was preaching by living men preaching the living word of God in the five-fold ministry. Keep the quote in context. That preaching was not pressing play and obey and sitting at home transgressing the command of God. And I love what brother Ram said in Christ is the mystery of God revealed, "If God is in your heart, you can't hardly wait for them doors to open out yonder to get in there to fellowship with your brothers." That's exactly what Hebrews 10:24 and 25 says and brother Ram will later quote that verse in this quotation. So the question is, is God in the heart of the members of the current Brandom Tabernacle? Cuz brother Brandham said, if God's in your heart, you can't wait for the doors to open. [clears throat] So we can wonder that. Is God in their heart? It doesn't seem like it, but God is the judge. If God was in your heart, you'd long for the church doors to open and go fellowship with your brothers and sisters and of course hear the word of God preached by the living five-fold ministry. As brother Random modeled in his life during his lifetime, brother Ram said in a thinking man's filter 1965, "As the days grow closer and closer, the narrowing of the path, we want to go closer together." He said, "Just sticking closer and closer as we see that day approaching." So he quotes Hebrews 10:24 and 25, assembling ourselves together all with one accord and one heart. He said, "Stay together. Don't never let one of you get away." So I thought this quote was thus sayith the Lord. Well, apparently not. Apparently, they have some thus lords that are more important than others at Brenham Tabernacle. They can transgress some commands, but then say they're keeping others. But of course, they're breaking many commands, at least 25, as the my video series shows. And remember, Brother Ram said this repeatedly, but he says it in the church age book. The church age messenger will preach the gospel exactly as God gave it to Paul, exactly in line with every word in the Bible. There is no Bible scripture that says right before the rapture, we're going to need to be trained and sit at home and press play and deny and also defy the five-fold ministry. Name call them, call them yunk, call them makebelievers, call them deus. There's no Bible scripture that says that. Yet, that's what Brandham tabernacle is doing because they don't really care about the Bible. The Bible's not their absolute. The tapes are their absolute, which is heresy and idolatry. So, friends, let's get to the second part of this. The possible origin. Where did this idea of training to transgress church attendance come from? Now, I'm open to correction on this, but it seems like it comes from the blog posts from Brenham Tabernacle. So, it seems like the current pastor Brennham Tabernacle was training the people to have home tape services well before CO, but then once CO hit, the state of Indiana cancelled their gatherings because they had more than 250 people. And this is from Brightham Tabernacles blog post. It says, "As you probably already know, the state of Indiana is requesting that gatherings of 250 people or gatherings which does not allow 6 ft distance for each person to be cancelled in order to prevent the corona virus from spreading. This includes churches. We can now see the beginning of why father has had us in training to have our home tape services. The bride cannot be separated as he united us around the message and is perfecting his bride." end quote. Now friends, I believe this is the wrong understanding. I know churches that were large churches, almost as big as Brandham Tabernacle, and they still gathered during Coronairus. They just made sure there was 6 ft between everyone. And then they rotated half of the church would come one Sunday and then the other half would come the next Sunday and they'd rotate it on Wednesday night as well. Half the church would come on this Wednesday night and then the next half would come on the next Wednesday night and so forth. So to me, this is an excuse not to gather more as you see that day approaching. When CO struck our church, I felt led just to cancel the Sunday PM service. We kept the Sunday A.M. service and I kept that for 50 days and then it just struck me 50 was Jubilee and after 50 days, no one had the Corona virus. So we resumed having our full services cuz the question becomes, do we obey God or man? And of course, we know the answer. We should obey God rather than man. And that was from March 14th, 2020. So that was when they stopped having services there and still to this day do not have physical services with preaching, singing, worship. Last year, one tape boy called me a liar because they said Brandham Tabernacle meets for prayer on Wednesday night. But he didn't say this. He didn't say that there's no singing and it's silent prayer and there's no preaching. So it's a silent prayer meeting. Maybe for an hour, who knows? Maybe less. But either way, that one meeting does not allow the whole church to come together. And it doesn't resemble the meetings that brother Brandham had during his lifetime. So they're not doing what brother Brandham did. They're not saying what brother Brandham said. And it certainly doesn't match the Bible where in Acts 20, the Bible said they met on the first day of week with preaching, feet washing, and so forth. So the truth is Brandon Tabernacle is not doing anything like the book of Acts Church and Brother Brandham's church while brother Random was alive. Another witness from the Brandom Tabernacle blog post is April 7th, 2020. It said, quote, "He has given us vindication after vindication that we are in his perfect will and that he is coming for us soon. He has trained us for this hour, friends, through our home tape services, home prayer meetings, and home Easter meetings as well." End quote. Now, friends, I'm not against praying in your home. You should pray in your home. You should listen to tapes in your home, but that does not replace physically gathering in the church building like brother Brandham did while he was alive. Now, the pastor went on to say, quote, "Which unites the bride is never before." End quote. Where did brother Brandham say, "The greatest uniting and uniting in the most powerful way would be at home." That's right. Brother Ram did not say that. So again, they're saying what Brother Ram did not say. Remember, Brother Ram said, "If God is in your heart, you can't wait for those church doors to open to worship with your brother and sister. And when does the Bible say we ought to obey man rather than God? The Bible says the exact opposite. So again, their folly is made manifest as the Bible said it will be. Now friends, I can understand during Coronairus, there was some time where we didn't know exactly what to do or how long this would last. But friends, how long is Brandham Tabernacle going to sit at home waiting for the rapture? Seems like they're waiting for the rapture. Are they going to spend their whole lives, the rest of their lives at home waiting for the rapture? What if the rapture doesn't come in their lifetime? And brother Ram said the rapture could be in 500 years. In taking sides with Jesus 1962, he said, "We don't know. It could be possible that it could be 100 years from now. It could be 500 years, 1,000 years, 10,000 years. I don't know. Nobody knows." So Brandon Tabernacle is making it seem like the rapture is so close. So they're getting training for the rapture at home. But what if the rapture doesn't come in their day? They've missed out on years and years. And how long is this going to turn into decades of just sitting at home and disobeying the Bible, transgressing the scriptures about gathering more as you see that day approaching? And friends, we always thought it would be the government that would shut down Brandham Tabernacle and other churches, but it's actually Brandham Tabernacle that shut down itself because we know churches like ours, many message churches stayed open during CO. They just followed the guidelines. But Brandham Tabernacle shut their church doors and the church doors are still shut for regular worship services with singing, preaching, worshiping, praying, a regular normal church service as it was when brother Brandham was alive. So how deceived is this church if they shut their own doors? When brother Brandham taught it wouldn't be the church that would shut its own doors. It would be the government, the federation of churches that would shut our doors down. And friends, I found something recently while reading the church age book that I think applies here. Brandom tabernacle has gone from deeds of nickelians to doctrine of nicicoatans. At first, it was just a saying. Well, let's stay at home. Let's do training. But now it's the unbending way. That's the only way for what they say is the royal seed of Abraham to worship. So now it's the unbending way. And friends, it's a hybrid religion. As brother Ram said, when you take one step away from the word of God, when you take one step away from Hebrews 10:24 and 25, you've got a hybrid religion. As brother Ram said, it's on page 136 in the red church age book. This one by the grace of God. And then brother Bram says when the church gets away from the word, it will believe anything. It is like Eve. And friends, that's exactly what has happened in Brandham Tabernacle. They'll believe anything their pastor says or their associate pastor. When their pastor says, "Every word on tape is thus sayith the Lord," they believe it. When the pastor says, "Just sit at home, just press play, don't gather more as you see that day approaching," they believe it. When the pastor says, "I'm a minor prophet," they believe it. And yet, he's never spoken anything in the name of the Lord in advance of it being fulfilled. as brother Brandham called it, a test of a prophet. Their pastor claims to be a minor prophet, but has never even passed the initial test to be considered a prophet. As brother Bram taught out of Deuteronomy chapter 18, the Bible said they've turned away their ears from the truth and turned unto fables. As brother Bram quoted 2 Timothy 4 1-5. It's a fable to silence the five-fold ministry. It's a fable to say just sit down and press play. It's a fable to say as Brandham Tabernacle does that the angel who revealed the book of revelation to John was brother Brandham because brother Ram said there's no pre-existence of souls. That's a fable. It's a fable to say that brother Brandham has a living ministry today. The Bible said when Moses passed away, God went to Joshua and said my servant Moses is dead. Now it's your turn to minister. And that's the same thing that happened today. Brother Brandon passed away and now it's the five-fold ministry. It's their turn to pick up and preach the word of God, as one of my recent videos showed. Brother Ram said the young man could sweep this message on to the coming of the Lord if Jesus didn't come in his day. He said, "These men can make more sense of it and hope they would bring it to life." Brother Brandham said, "Some people have to fill our shoes as he and brother Neville were getting old." He didn't say they have to sit down and press play. They believe the fable that the tapes are the token. They believe the fable that going to a tape church is the evidence of the token. That's an absolute fable. But what can we expect friends? When you step away from the word of God, when you transgress the word of God, even on church attendance, you'll believe anything because you've got a deity spirit. You've also got a rebellious spirit. And now they'll believe anything. With the antichrist spirit that has moved from a deed of the nickel, a saying of the nickelans, now it's a doctrine of the nicicoatans. It's the unbending way. Everyone in their church or cult-like gathering has to follow the words of their leader. Now, we'll move here to the final section. Brother Brandham quotes on training because there are no quotes that say we need to sit at home to be trained for the rapture. So, again, Brandham Tabernacle is not saying what William Brandham said. And I don't have any particular order for these quotes. We'll just go through them as I laid them out here. Brother Ram said, "Anyone that changes the Bible is not trained to the sound of the Bible. They're trained to some denominational creed instead of the sound of the Bible." So, Current Brandom Tabernacle is trained to a denominational creed that says, "Sit at home and don't gather more as you see that day approaching." Let's play the quote. &gt;&gt; The gospel sounds in the purity of its word &gt;&gt; and of its manifestation, and still they don't get it. They can't understand it. They're not trained to that sound of the Bible. They're trained to some denominational creed instead of the sound of the Bible. Therefore, when the Bible sounds it out, they don't know what you're talking about. &gt;&gt; Then in 1962, Brother Ram said, "God soldiers are trained to the word. They warn others that something is not in the scripture." So, I reached out to Joseph and Billy Paul personally. They were kind, but they rejected my attempts to bring correction to them. And so the love of God in my heart and many other people's hearts have tried to correct them over the years, but they won't receive it. But that's what God's soldiers do. They're trained to the word and they try to warn others when they're not obeying the scripture. Let's listen to the quote. &gt;&gt; That's the way God's soldiers are today. &gt;&gt; They're trained to the word. &gt;&gt; When anything comes up a little polish to it that's got something else that's not scripture, they warn their congregation. &gt;&gt; Amen. Anything that's not Bible, anything that's not it's not godlike, such as having soup suppers, dances, and everything else to pay off the pastors, &gt;&gt; those things are wrong. &gt;&gt; And as that quote said, see, we warn our congregations. We warn other congregations. That's what this video is all about and the video series that exposes the 25 lies coming out of Brandon Tabernacle. We're trying to warn others. Warn congregations. I love this quote from Taking Sides with Jesus, 1962. Brother Bram says, "I can show you the vision that I have for the future." Now, I have a separate video about this if you want to watch it, but Joseph said, "We've got to catch his vision. We've got to play the tapes." That's a denominational mandate. That's a lie. &gt;&gt; But they got to catch the vision. You got to play the tapes. You've got to &gt;&gt; Brother Ram's vision was not to sit at home and press play. Brother Ram's vision was to train the young preachers by the elder preachers. And so that way more problems would be taken care of and then he could send out the young preachers when new churches sprung up. Let's listen to the quotes from Take Inside with Jesus. &gt;&gt; Now we're going to start off with the early church and just bring it for about 5 minutes now down to what they did and then I can show you the vision that I have for the future. You brother out there with your little churches and uh you want to you're doing a work. God will reward you for that. Go out there, preach, do everything you can that all of you get together, you bunch of men that had meetings and talk on deep things of the scripture and pray and and then in there get training in your own groups, other ministers, man that you see that that has a calling in their life for the ministry. Train them young men. Bring them in here to the elder. All of you set together in a ministerial meeting and there teach the deeper things of God. Don't go on the bad end. Keep someone who you can have confidence in to be kind of like a a leader for you. And in there, churches can go here and training up a group of men. And if I'm in evangelistic work somewhere, there's places I can place them worldwide. What if I had a group of men, young men trained in the message? See, just say, "Now, wait a minute. Before I leave here, we're going to set in order these churches. I have a man I've already them. They got the money. They're on the road here right now to take over this. A good man, his two or three young men with him who will be his helpers and assistants. And a church of this state can be set there which will be a outpost in India, outpost in Germany, outpost in Switzerland. Well, right now we should have had them all around the nation. It's where I've been. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the message then from there comes another. From another comes another. See what I mean? And if you can get the preacher straight and him going, "Right, look what he's going to do. He's going to influence." It would take care of hundreds of these things. That's it. We're just beating that. You see, you got to get it a system. [clears throat] God's system, right? Uh Jethro said to Moses, "Well, you can't beat out all of them." Or, "And God put elders out there, 70 of them, and took the spirit with Moses and put him up on those 70 elders, and they prophesied." &gt;&gt; And it didn't weaken Moses a bit and strengthened him. He had just as much prophecy in him as they did before they took the spirit off of them prophesy. See, he just separated his son out of Moses. Let them judge the smaller things. But when it comes to the just 70 of them and took the spirit was on Moses and put him up on those 70 elders and they prophesied &gt;&gt; and it didn't weaken Moses a bit and strengthened him. He had just as much prophecy in him as they did before they took the spirit off him and prophesied. See, he just separated us out of Moses. Let them judge the smaller things. And but when it comes to the major things, you come in with them and help them like that. That's the way. That was God's way back there. That was God's way in the in the early church age and I believe it's God's way now, &gt;&gt; right? For us to do it. So, let's do it. Just quit talking about it and do it. That's all. We [clears throat] can do it by the grace of God. Don't you believe it? &gt;&gt; Brother Ram also talked about this training in 1960. He said he had some offers for some churches if the young preachers wanted them. if you're ready to go be a pastor now, if you got your training. And then he said, "If you ever want to take a church or anything, let Brother Brandham know." Brother Ram did not train them to press play and obey because there's no quotes that say that. All the quotes say he wanted preachers that were older, training the younger preachers. And that lines up perfectly with the Bible. Let's listen to the quote. &gt;&gt; I got some offers for some churches if you all want them. [clears throat] If you're ready to go to pastor now, if you got your training and which I believe you have and you got all settled down, I got one in Oregon, some in Washington, California, and Arizona, different places. And if you want to ever take a church or anything, well, right here's a good place to start from, right? &gt;&gt; And there's souls crying everywhere, even to the Indian reservations and whatever you want to go to. Just let us know because I believe that you boys are anchored now. Amen. &gt;&gt; I just love to see him do that. &gt;&gt; Here's another quote that says, "In essence, the tape boys have no discernment." Brother Ram's talking about a form of godliness and denying the power thereof. He said, "If you've got spiritual discernment and the Holy Ghost is upon you, it says amen to every promise of God." What about the promises of God in Hebrews 10:24 and 25 that say we should assemble more, provoke one another to good works, exhort one another, encourage them, and then brother Ram quotes Hebrews 10:24 and2. But Ram said it ought to draw us together. The Bible said, "Assembling ourselves together, it ought to be one revival after another. Bonfires of God's glory built in every church and in every place." He didn't say built in every home as you sit at home and press play and disobey. He didn't say that. He said it's actually physically gathering a church as he quoted Hebrews 10:24 and2. Oh God have mercy on these tape worshippers. May they accept these quotes someday. As I told in another video, may the next generation in that tape church system recognize the folly of their parents and grandparents and so forth and pastors and leaders and may repent of that and follow and obey these quotes from God's prophet brother Renham that are quoting Hebrews 10:24 and2. Let's listen to the quote. having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof, &gt;&gt; no spiritual discernment. When you got spiritual discernment and the Holy Ghost is upon you, you have spiritual discernment. &gt;&gt; It says amen to every promise of God. Paul said those days would be we got it. It's here. It's on us and we look and see it. We hear it from everywhere. What do we do? It ought to draw us together. The Bible said assem ourselves together. And that's the more when you see that day approaching. &gt;&gt; It ought to be one revival after another in bonfires of God's glory built in every church in every place. &gt;&gt; A great coming together where all the churches with one heart and one accord themselves together and forget their man-made theology and cry out to God for spiritual power &gt;&gt; and spiritual discernment. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the hour we need. &gt;&gt; Brother Ram again talks about training ministers to go to churches and take over in a total deliverance. 1959, Brother Ram called it a great move of bringing up other ministers to go out into the fields to establish the faith and to have a minister ready, willing, and trained to take over. So, Brother Ram's talking about missionary work. And brother Ram said, "It's a great move of God when brother Brandham would go out in the missionary fields, start churches, and then he could have men trained that could take them over, not to press, play, and obey, but to preach the word of God, as brother Brandham modeled through his entire life." He never said press, play, and obey and sit at home and silence the preachers. Brother Ram said, "The most important thing is a preacher, a minister who knows how to rightly divide the word of truth." And then in that quote, brother Rand says, 'Lord, that out of it shall go ministers and evangelists and teachers and missionaries to all parts of the world. He does not pray for tape boys. He prays for preachers. Let's listen to the quote. &gt;&gt; May there be a fellowship in this church. Seeing that we're just about to emerge into some great move, we field of bringing up other ministers to go out into the fields of where if you shall send me into the different parts of the world there to establish the faith and to have a minister ready and willing and trained to take [clears throat] over. &gt;&gt; Amen. And may the faith that was once delivered to the saints that we are gallantly standing for become a circle around the world. Grant it, Lord. And may this little weed pile as it was one day when we dedicated it to you. May there be a church rise up here, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That out of it shall go ministers and evangelists and teachers and missionaries to all parts of the world. Right. &gt;&gt; Lastly here in unbelief does not hinder God. 1962 brother Brandham said in the last days it's going to take a stand is a scriptural trained church on the line for there's going to be carnal impersonations rise. So true brother Brennham. We need scriptural trained churches that can recognize the carnal impersonations such as the tape church worship movement, the press play and disobey movement. Yes, a scriptural trained church will recognize that's a carnal impersonation that doesn't resemble the book of Acts. That goes against the book of Acts blueprint. And so it's a carnal impersonation. It's a hybrid religion. Brother Ram said, "And yet, if it's off the scripture, leave it alone." So anyone who tells you to sit at home and don't physically gather at church, leave them alone. No matter what kind of a sensation, no matter what they say, no matter what supernatural experiences they say happens to them while they're at home, what results you find out of it, if it isn't scripture, stay away from it. Stay right with the word. Yes. Amen, brother Brandham. will stay right with the word of God. No matter what carnal personations or sensation these tape worshippers say they're having, it's not a sensation that agrees with the Bible. Let's listen to the quote. &gt;&gt; In the last days, what is Tego to take the stand is a scriptural trained church. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; On the line for there's going to be carnal impersonations. Rise, &gt;&gt; right? The Bible said, "As Jambus and Jamis withstood Moses, so will these men of repbate mind concerning the truth." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Jesus was the truth. &gt;&gt; Thy word is the truth. Because in the beginning was the word, and the word was with God. And the word was made flesh and dwelt among them. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the word of God is more powerful than a two-edged sword, cutting to the son of the bone, and a discerner of the thoughts of the heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We realize that we're in that day to where anything can look so real, but yet if it's off the scripture, leave it alone. &gt;&gt; Right? No matter what kind of a sensation, what results you find out of it, if it isn't scripture, stay away from it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Stay right with the word. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; In closing, friends, I hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God. Remember, Brother Ram said, "No matter what Brandham Tabernacle turns out to be, you be a follower of the word." He said, "Don't let it be you. You be a servant of Christ. No matter what the church world does, you be a servant of Christ. It's not up to the Brandham Tabernacle. Neither is it up to any churches. It's up to you as an individual to be ready at the coming of the Lord. Hallelujah, brother Brandham. And look what Brandham tabernacles turned out to be. 25 false teachings coming out of their church, sitting at home, isolating themselves away from the body of Christ, isolating themselves away from their brothers and sisters in Christ Jesus, not provoking each other unto good works. So no matter what sensations they have, no matter what apparent experiences they have, it's off the word of God. Stay away from those type of people. Stay away from hybrid religion. Remember friends, in humble thyself 63, brother said, "Don't forget this tabernacle will lose its strength." Remember that this is the target where Satan has got every gun in hell trained on it. He'll cause one person to do something that's contrary to what the other one thinks. He's doing that. He is up to that. That's his business. So friends, God's prophet told us these things. We can take everything back to the word of God. If any church is not saying exactly what the Bible says, what St. Paul said, they are off the word of God. They're either at the deeds of nickelans or if they've made it a doctrine, now they're at the doctrine of nicicoatans. So that's a form of the antichrist spirit. But we want to be led by the Holy Spirit. We want to be led by the Holy Ghost. How do we know we are? Because we're lining ourselves up with the word of God. Making ourselves ready, making sure everything we believe is thus sayith the Bible, the absolute. Friends, let's be a scriptural trained church. Let's stand against the carnal impersonations of the church world system. Leave it alone if anything is off the scripture. Stay right with the word. Yes, we'll do that in 2026 by the grace of almighty God. If you have any questions, concerns, or testimonies about this video, please contact me. God bless you and may Jesus [music] Christ be the desire of your heart. I'm very happy to be here this afternoon and again in defense of the gospel of Jesus Christ to bring the good tidings, the good news that Jesus raised from the dead, living among man today, his church. [music] The same Jesus that was yesterday will be today and forever. He's never failed.
