TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] and the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him the spirit of wisdom of understanding the spirit of counsel might the spirit of knowledge and the fear of the Lord and shall make him of quick understanding and the fear of the Lord greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to do a part two on this series on the fear of the Lord and in this video we're looking at the New Testament verses that speak of the fear of the Lord by the grace of God hi friends I'm Jesse Smith pastor bride of Christ Fellowship here in akan Ohio USA and I defend the original Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ that he revealed to St Paul and then had to restore through Martin Luther John Wesley and the late Prophet brother William Maran and brandham who lived from 1909 to 1965 and also defend brother Ram's Godly Christian character so here's a screenshot of A Brief Review of part one we looked at Old Testament verses we found that the fear of the Lord is your choice to love good it's profound honor for God and hatred for sin it's your prerequisite for the beginning of wisdom it's your strong confidence in God or your Refuge it's your Fountain of Life it's your source of Happiness it's your path to praise or reward of God it's your path to Lasting Purity your path to Blessings your lesson to be learned and it's also your conclusion about life purpose now as we get into part two I want to slightly amend uh my definition of the fear of the Lord here's a screenshot in part one I said that the fear of the Lord is profound honor and it is but I'd like to add to that the Hebrew definition is morally reverence so moral is Right Behavior reverence is profound honor so the fear of the Lord is behaving right with profound honor as a meditated on this definition I thought of the New Testament and the words of our Lord Jesus who said if you love me keep my commands I knew the fear of the Lord was hating evil departing from evil in order to obey God's word so I think now I can say that the fear of the Lord in the New Testament is loving obedience obedience is the right Behavior spoken of in the Old Testament so I get this idea of loving obedience from the words of Jesus three times in John 14 Jesus said if you love me keep my commands so the keeping of commands would be obedience which is the same as the Old Testament wording of right behavior and of course we obey based upon love and not a sinful fear of the Lord but it's a loving fear of the Lord as brother Ram said we're saved by grace but then our works are done for our gratitude or appreciation or I'd even say our love for the Salvation that God has revealed to us and given to us so these are two different ways to to identify the fear of the Lord maybe in common terms that we'd understand you could call it right behavior in profound honor or you could just call it loving obedience as Jesus said in John 14:15 let's go through now the verses on the fear of the Lord in the New Testament I chose the ones that I thought would be most helpful here by God's grace the fear of the Lord is your highest respect for the one who can save or destroy your soul Matthew 10:28 says and fear not them which kill the body but are not able to kill the soul but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and Body in hell we give God the greatest respect because he has power over our souls and thank God he saved us by grace through faith Ephesians 2: 8-10 the next verse about the fear of the Lord is it's your source of God's mercy according to Luke 1:50 the Bible said and his Mercy is on them that fear Him from generation to generation when God sees that we fear Him him we lovingly obey him then he extends Mercy to us next Luke 23:40 the fear of the Lord is your hope in the last moments before death this is seen with the saved thief on the cross the saved Thief said Dost not thou fear God seeing Thou Art in the same condemnation he spoke this to the other malactor who was railing on Jesus earlier in Luke 23:39 so this fear of God that the save Thief had led him to ask for Jesus to remember him him in verse 42 and of course Jesus said today Thou shalt be with me in Paradise this shows how important the fear of the Lord is at the moment of death next the fear of the Lord is your motivation for perfecting Holiness in 2 Corinthians 7:1 the Bible says having therefore these promises dearly beloved let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the Flesh and spirit perfecting Holiness in the fear of God we will not be like the rejected church that's lovers of Pleasures more than lovers of God we're going to be lovers of God and therefore will be perfected or matured in the Holiness of God because we fear the lord the fear of the Lord is your key to a loving marriage we see that in Ephesians 5 21 and 22 the Bible says submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God Ephesians 5:22 says wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the Lord so in these two verses we see the submission that's required wives submit to their own husbands in the fear of God and so as the wife submits in obeying her husband the husband submits to Christ by loving his wife as Christ loved the church we see that in Ephesians 5:25 husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it this verse should remind you of the verse we covered in part one proverbs 31:30 a woman that fearth the Lord shall be praised so we see this fear of the Lord continued in happy marriages in the New Testament next the fear of the Lord is your source for almsgiving prayer and fasting we see this in corus's life in Acts 10 verse two he was a devout man one that feared God with all his house which gave much alms to the people and prayed to God all way if we want to please God with almsgiving prayer and fasting then we need the fear of the Lord to do that next the fear of the Lord is your acceptance with God according to acts 10:35 Peter said but in every nation he that fearth him and worketh righteousness is accepted with him God accepts all those who fear Him and then work righteousness of course we're not saved by works again works are an expression of our gratitude for God saving our souls this reminds me of Galatians 5:6 works are an outflow of the love of God because Faith Works by love so if we have faith we'll work but before faith we have to have love if we love God we keep his Commandments if we love God that gives us faith and then that Faith causes us to work because Faith Works by love as its motivation next the fear of the Lord is your basis for receiving more from God according to acts 13:26 men and Brethren Children of the stock of Abraham and whosoever among you fearth God to you is the word of this salvation sent so Paul recognized because the Jews fear God God was giving them a chance to receive the New Testament the New Covenant so we know as message believers if we love God and fear God God will give us the further Revelation for rapturing Faith any other Revelations God wants to reveal in the end time we'll receive it because we fear God and keep his commands next the fear of the Lord is your essential humility as Gentiles whom God will eventually cut off we see this in Romans 11: 20-2 the Bible said well because of unbelief they were broken off and thou standest by faith be not high- minded but fear for if God Spar not the natural branches take heed he also spare not thee then verse 23 says God is able to graft Israel in again and we see this happening in Romans 11:25 blindness is in part is happen to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in and in verse 26 so shall all Israel be saved so after God raptures the way the Gentile bride he'll graft back in the 144,000 Jews and will save them next the fear of the Lord is your humility as you work out your own salvation Philippians 2:12 Paul said wherefore my beloved as you have always obeyed not as in my presence only but now much more in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and trembling the word trembling in the Greek means the anxiety of one who distrusts his ability completely to meet all requirements but religiously does his utmost to fulfill his duty that's a beautiful definition we have no ability to meet God's requirements because Jesus met all our requirements on the cross by the blood that he shed saying it is finished but then once we're saved we recognize God has a duty for us and we do everything in our power to fulfill God's Duty for us which is the greatest commandment to love God with all of our heart soul mind and strength next the fear of the Lord is taught by Grace So Grace teaches your heart to fear the lord as the hymn Amazing Grace speaks of and then the fear of the Lord is your motivation for acceptably serving the the Lord in this Grace Hebrews 1228 and 29 wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have Grace whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear for our God is a consuming fire so it's through Grace that we serve god with reverence and godly fear Grace taught our hearts to fear next the fear of the Lord is your mindset as you sojourn here in your service to God 1 Peter 1:17 and 21:17 the Bible says if you call on the father pass the time of your sojourning here in fear so we must pass our time in the fear of the Lord and if we'll do that we'll do 1 Peter 21:17 where we'll honor all men love the Brotherhood fear God honor the king next the fear of the Lord is the anointing the church walks in after great signs and wonders are done among them this is according to acts 5: 5-16 and acts 93 31 after the death of ananas and saf the Bible said great fear or fear of the Lord came upon the church then the Bible said the Saints did many signs wonders and miracles acts 9:31 says they walked in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost and were multiplied so I've seen this in my life and no doubt others have seen it as well when God does a great sign Wonder Miracle brings a renewed fear of the Lord upon ourselves upon the Saints and we rejoice in that next the fear of the Lord is not in the mind of Sinners according to Romans 318 of course this is something to keep in mind as you're witnessing to people there is no fear of God before their eyes so that's why we preach the gospel the good news to the people first we must show them the bad news that their sins have condemned them and they cannot save themselves and then we share the good news of the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ the substitutionary sacrifice of our Lord Jesus and his grace is called a free gift in Romans 5: 15 16 and 18 two more verses here uh the fear of the Lord is the final command to the Lost before the mark of the beast is laid down it's in Revelation 14: 6-11 the Bible said another Angel flew in the midst of Heaven having the Everlasting gospel to preach to them that dwell on the earth to Every Nation Kindred tongue and people saying with a loud voice fear God and give glory to him for the hour of his judgment is come and worship him that made Heaven and Earth and the Sea and in The Fountains of the waters and then verse 9 the second half of it says if any man worship the beast in His image and receive his Mark in his forehead or in his hand verse 10 the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God this again shows the importance of having the fear of the Lord just to be saved like we'd say the foolish virgin and again that wonderful example of the thief on the cross saved in those last moments because he had the fear of the Lord and then if you have this fear of the Lord it will lead to the wisdom needed to recognize the Beast who being rode by the mother Harlot this is found in Revelation 13:18 Revelation 17:9 so I put these two verses together Revelation 14 then Revelation 131 18 and Revelation 179 this looks like it's God's last call to the foolish virgin gospel comes and says fear God the good news is fear God God will have mercy on you and then if those foolish virgins receive the fear of God that'll give them the beginning of wisdom to rec recogniz the Seven Hills or the Seven Mountains upon which ancient Rome sat and current Rome sits with that wisdom they'll recognize the Roman Catholic Church as the mother Harlot and they will not accept the mark of the beast we've come to the end of part two friends I hope all these verses on the fear of the Lord from the New Testament were a blessing they've been a great blessing to me and also our church by the grace of God it's amazing to see how the fear of the Lord is a part of our Salvation our justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost our entire ire Earthly Journey so in the next part we'll look at the quotes from God's Prophet brother brandom on the fear of the Lord and we'll see our conclusion likely a part three by God's grace if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
