TRANSCRIPT
========================================
the new birth is no different from any other birth it's a mess you ought to seen what mess I was in when I got it and every once in a while when it comes up on me again I get messy again with it I cry and boohoo and Carry On Till I guess I don't look very good to look at but I got something on the inside of me that's taking me all and on and on and on and on it's new life I don't care what it looks like I want to know what it is that's the main thing need diping them old muddy waters no sir well the water's up serious better than they are I heard a person say to the day he said well it's been some time ago said do you mean to tell me I'm going to have to come down there that older and stop excuse me and go on down and cry and carry on like the rest of them people down boohoo and cry I said you going to get saved you do well I said I'll just never do that I said go ahead where you are then I was preaching as the woman she was cry crying she raised up her hand started shouting little old boy Baptist teacher come up to me and he said Billy when are you going to get away from them holy rulers I said away them what said I'm holy rulers said I was enjoying your message the other night so that woman raised up and started crying with her hands up in air crying I said said didn't that interrupt you I said no she didn't do it would I said that didn't interrupt me he said you know what said that just made chills go up my back like a wind shade I said boy if you'd ever get to heaven you'd freeze to death I said there sure Shou in heaven right for they're crying before the altar of God holy holy holy Lord God Almighty day and night to the heaven amen yes sir God provided with you say brother BR you're teaching that new kind of religion uhuh I just got a brand new case of of the old time kind old time religion that there screaming and crying and going on yep that's right see one oldfashioned conversion get out the alt CED boohoo through and to see a 10,000 standing just say well I'll try it try it he's not a Christ a try he's one to accept live or die sink or drown take him anyhow yesterday standing in the backyard of of my sister that lives next door to his sister Woods we was noticing a little cocoon that had formed on a tree and the wind was blowing it back and forth and she was telling me that in the streams of the deserts I believe it she was reading an article about the coocon it's a little worm that goes in there and Farms a little shell around him to keep him through the cold and but when it comes time this person who was dealing with the little fellow they seen the little uh Kakuna moving and wiggling around and they felt so sorry for the little fellas so they thought they would just cut the end of it off and let the little bug out because when he come out of there he was going to have wings he went in as a bug or a little worm he comes out with wings in a more like a glorified State amen and as he was wiggling and pulling and hugging and beating and biting and trying to get out of the coocon they felt sorry for him so they thought they would just give him a sharp cut so they go get the scissors and cut the end off and when they cut the end off the little bug come out but he never was right because he didn't have any strength in his body he had no he couldn't use his wings and I think that's the way we've tried to duplicate that get down to the altar and say this that and the other and try to get the people back to God into the church to come to Christ just let them boohoo out that's all just work your way out of it that's all if you try to give them a shortcut they'll never able to stand I just like to see them struggle and work at it till God gives them a real birth in the natural way just give them the real birth just people say well honey I think you prayed enough you just stay there until you're ready to fly that's the only thing God has a way of doing it oh well if you want to be good just go over to jar the church Mama went to the same church that might be just fine but you know it takes a death to bring a life amen and we've got to die until then we are so de that there can be a new life come in that our wings will be valuable and our our experience that we have will be valuable to others and to ourselves praise God we all know that the Bible teaches the new birth and they substituted handshakes and everything else for the new birth but it'll never take the place of the new birth it's got to be an experience of born again we all know that any kind of a birth is a mess when a baby's born if it's on the floor if it's in a Shu pile or in a pink decorated hospital room it's a mess but it brings life that's what the new birth is it's a mess but it brings life glory to God it ain't a style or a put on or Declaration of Creeds it's a baptism of the Holy Ghost and that's the secret of the real believing Church borned again oh I know you get up in the altar crying and boohoo and squealing the slobber but it brings life it takes a starch out of you it makes you something that you ought to be it takes all the world and the stiff neck out of you and today we just walk up and say I take Jesus for my personal savior that'll never take the place of the New Birth when man and when and come to the Altar and forget where they are and who's around them until they really die out and are born again all night prayer meetings and the power of the Holy Ghost get back into the church again that's what we need today is a good old time St Paul's Revival in the Bible Holy Ghost preach back in the power yet in the Simplicity of preaching it's in the power of the Resurrection to and the new birth is no conception it's no it's no difference it's a it's a mess when a man is born again he makes him do things he wouldn't think he was going to do it might make you Squall and boohoo and carry on it might make you do things that you didn't think you would do but it brings new life that's the main thing is new life I don't care what level I have to meet it on I want new birth and new life I don't care where P that is a Holy Roller or whatever it is I want new life and New Life can only come when death comes to the believer or the unbeliever people are afraid of the new birth they're afraid of it now any birth I don't care what level it's on it's a mess you think if it's out you're in a pig pin any birth makes a mess if it's in a pig pin if it's in a if it's in the cow table if it's in a pink decor ated hospital room I don't care where a birth take place it's a mess and the new birth is the same it'll make you do things that you didn't think you do you might cry boohoo and rub around on the altar no matter what you do I've never asked God it wouldn't do no good to try to bring the new birth to my level I want to meet God's level of the new birth and receive it I don't care what I have to do someone said not long ago I'm afraid to receive the Holy Ghost I'm afraid it would make me speak in tongues like them others I don't care if I spoke in tongues talked in tongues crow in tongues or anything else I want the Holy Ghost that's the meain principle I don't care what level it is I'll meet God on his level what he wants to say is right that's where I want to stand that new birth that changes a man changes a woman changes the desire changes her appetite rational with God until you can hold on until the blessing comes and God will change you like he did Jacob suppl her to Israel Prince so many people not say oh if I'd have to get down there and boohoo and cry if I'd ever had to speak in them tongues oh not me oh well my mother would turn me out my Society well they never play cards with me again don't worry if you do that you won't play any more cards anyhow that's right you don't have to worry about that and your societies will be a bunch of trash to you that's exactly right CU there will only be one Society that's the blood of Jesus Christ and the redeemed from the foundation of the world Hallelujah that's the Society of Jesus Christ amen blood was talked about despise rejecting cast out call idiots everything else but that don't take away the promise of God God remains the same yesterday today and forever and no man's no better than his word and his word sticks just as good now as it ever did that every man that will believe it you know when you're when you take an ocean to meet Jesus he'll make you do some of the silliest things you just ruin all all your presed you think he won't Squall and cry and boohoo but you will if you want to see him you you'll just do anything to see him but little old Jacob he didn't care how he had to get it that birth right's what he wanted no matter how he got it just so he got it am if he had G up the alt scream and cry and boooo and snot excuse me or you know right up in his eyes I didn't say that and so excuse me so get out your cry through till he got it why he got it see he didn't care how he got it just so he got it somebody says brother people there booing on that alar and crying and crying I don't want it that way you won't get it amen for when the spirit of God is in you it lines up with the word of God and if it denies a word of God then it isn't you haven't got the right shot yet the allong you're not an ulated sin still lays at the door unbelief in the word so it takes the toxine of God to kill sin and sin is number one killer yes it is it kills and it kills to the uttermost so we know that it's a that it's a the sin that does the killing so it's a toxine that people just refuse to take it they don't like it they don't like the thought of New Birth now we know that any birth is a mess I don't care if it's in a pig pin or if it's uh Pink decorated hospital room any birth is a mess and the new birth is nothing less it's a mess right it'll make you boohoo and cry and carry on like you then the office mess you every in but it'll do you good amen Jesus said except the corn wheat falls in the ground and dies it abides alone and the people don't want to die all right you want to be alive God in the world and still you want to be religious so you accept an intellectual conception of it and then when you do that you're still dead in sin and trespasses and that's what makes people act and do the way they do because the spirit that's in them dominates your life say well other people do this well you're not like the other people you are dead in your life is heing God through Christ and heal by the Holy Spirit Hallelujah all right see you didn't try the toxin it's just because the people don't want to try it now you got to die you got to ro that's a trouble that people St gring out the Altar and get some kind of sensation jump up and shake hands with the preacher go out and get some kind of a Dogma or Creed and recite it and say I belong to so and so I belong to so and so are you a Christian I'm so and so a Christian is to be Christlike yes Christlike is to believe the word if you don't believe the word then he can't be Christlike how can you say you're a Christian and deny half of the word that's right if the Holy Spirit wrote the word the Holy Spirit confirms the word and the Holy Spirit is the word the word abiding in you brings God's promises to every believer amen that word means so beit I believe it with all my heart it's the word of the Living God before a seed can reproduce itself it's got to die and Order and not only die but it's got to rot in order to get new life out of it it's got to die and rot in itself and so does every siner every man no matter how highly he's educated and how much he's polished how many uh degrees he has in the church or so forth how many of these things how many colleges he's educated out of he's got to die to his own Theory he's got to die to himself he's got to die to everything to be reborned again by the Holy Ghost you make him cry and boohoo and speak in tongues and jump up and down and carry on like a maniac but he's got new life that's what it takes to do it he got to have new life they're afraid of the new birth the new birth is a mess now they call New Birth all everything oh sure I believe in been born again and they say they're born again and deny the word say they have the Holy Ghost and take the scriptures and plainly teach the Bible how it is and then they say oh that was for another age and mean that the Holy Ghost that's in you will witness to that is for another age when he said it's to you and to your children to them as far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call amen hallelujah he can't lie if there's a spirit in you that denies that to be the truth then it's not the holy spirit cuz the Holy Spirit wrote the word amen that's as solid as I know how to place it that's what's the matter with the Christian church today has tried to accept some manufactured way in instead of beating its way through to the kingdom of God it's tried some other way and it won't work you kill your patient you kill your your your baby God's Baby by trying to manufacture some way oh there's no need of this here boohoo crying there's no need of this all this oh yes there is there's no need of this dying unless there's death that cannot be birthed birth only comes by the substance of death l a corner wheat falls into the ground and dies it abides alone it must Rock and get into corruption and then from that corruption Springs forth life no other way will work it must first corrupt and be uh corrupted and that's way we must be D to ourselves and be borned a new of the Holy Spirit now they haven't found any better way for a chicken to get out of a shell than to Peck his way through that's God's provided way for him and he's equipped to do it amen God wouldn't provide a way without providing an instrument for it so he provided the way and provided the instrument for the chicken to free self amen the word needed a savior one day and God provided his son when he come he was not recognized he was not wanted they said they wanted a savior but when God sent it in his way they asked for a king God give him a baby they wanted a mighty man to stomp out Rome God give him a little crying baby in a barn amen see but it was God's providing way we but they didn't want it the way God want to understand it they want the way they wanted it see so therefore they went into chaos because they didn't accept his way there were some that did this was the birthplace of the church was it Pentecost after Jesus had commissioned them to go into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature these signs shall follow them that believe he had told them what to do told them to go up city of Jerusalem and wait they needed a charter amen they needed a charter they wanted to draw up a Creed God give them the Holy Ghost they needed a denomination but God give them a spirit what a difference how God does do it the Holy Ghost was God's provided way to lead the church not a bishop amen the Holy Ghost that's what that was her Charter and from that day to this has been ever true Born Again child's Charter the Holy Ghost
