[0:00] I'm going to record this uh sermon in
[0:01] case anybody wants copies I have most of
[0:03] the sermons that I've preached here
[0:04] recorded if anybody wanted to go back
[0:06] and listen to any of those um I think
[0:09] the only one I missed was the baptism of
[0:10] the Holy Ghost I think that was the only
[0:12] one that I missed there by the grace of
[0:14] God so we want to look look at the
[0:16] mystery of the godhead and there's only
[0:18] one service today is that right brother
[0:19] Irvin okay so I'm not even going to pay
[0:21] attention to the clock today I'm just
[0:22] going to preach praise God I want you to
[0:24] get it and I want you to uh enjoy the
[0:27] the word of God today usually at my
[0:29] church you know there're in aaran I
[0:30] preach at least an hour and a half
[0:32] that's usually where I I cut it off so
[0:33] just so you know if you need like
[0:35] brother BR said if you need to get up
[0:36] and stand up you know stretch your legs
[0:38] up against the wall he said go ahead and
[0:40] do that praise God because I'm going to
[0:41] make a recording today and I trust to be
[0:43] a blessing uh to you by the grace of
[0:46] God so God sent the seventh angel
[0:50] according to Revelation 10:7 to finish
[0:52] the mystery of God and brother Braham
[0:54] said it says mystery but of course it
[0:57] means all the mysteries in the Bible
[0:59] that are called Mysteries Mysteries
[1:01] Hallelujah and brother Ram said God just
[1:03] calls them the mystery of God and we
[1:05] know that because uh God gave Paul the
[1:08] full Revelation and then of course after
[1:11] Paul John wrote the Book of Revelation
[1:13] but there were some things in the M I'm
[1:15] sorry some things in the Book of
[1:16] Revelation Paul didn't know about
[1:17] because Paul had already passed on he'd
[1:19] already been a martyr and so uh then the
[1:22] bi the Bible shows us that they would
[1:24] lose some truth through the 2,000-year
[1:26] church ages and God would restore at the
[1:28] end of the Gentile Church
[1:30] that's where we're at today we're living
[1:32] in an age of restoration praise God
[1:34] hallelujah we're so blessed to live in
[1:36] this day where we're not lacking
[1:38] Revelation but we've received the full
[1:40] revelation of God's word hallelujah so
[1:42] we're very grateful for that uh the
[1:44] Bible says I will restore sayeth the
[1:47] Lord in Joel chapter 2 this is the hour
[1:50] of restoration God is restoring the
[1:52] original Faith Malachi 45 and6 of course
[1:55] brother Ram says Elijah will turn our
[1:58] hearts back he said to the p Pentecostal
[2:00] fathers to the apostolic fathers so our
[2:03] hearts are turned back to the Bible we
[2:05] don't want a man's Creed we want what
[2:07] the Bible says praise God we're not
[2:09] going to settle for a denomination we're
[2:11] not going to settle for a Creed you all
[2:13] came out of denomination just like I did
[2:15] hallelujah amen so we we came out of
[2:18] denomination we will not go back in we
[2:20] will not add man's ideas but we will
[2:22] believe the full word of God we will
[2:24] believe the full truth of God because
[2:26] this is the hour when the full truth is
[2:28] available to us Hallelujah so we're very
[2:31] grateful for that what God has done in
[2:33] this hour
[2:35] Hallelujah now we know I just want to
[2:38] share just a few basic things here uh by
[2:40] the grace of God we know God is one
[2:44] person we we know God is not three
[2:46] persons we know God is not two persons
[2:50] um and so I want to state that plainly
[2:54] uh but remember brother Ram said there
[2:55] will be a few people in the
[2:57] denominations that are saved brother Ram
[2:59] said God has children in the Catholic
[3:02] Church brother bam said that brother bam
[3:04] said God has children in the Methodist
[3:06] Church right how many believe you still
[3:09] got loved ones that are caugh maybe
[3:10] caught up in denomination now look at
[3:11] the witnesses here me too
[3:13] Hallelujah right and brother B said
[3:15] they're foolish virsion he said they're
[3:17] virgin to all that they believe of God's
[3:20] word so they're true to all that they
[3:23] know but they're foolish because they
[3:25] don't prepare and receive the baptism of
[3:27] the Holy Ghost right they're they could
[3:29] have prepared to receive the Holy Ghost
[3:31] they could have went deeper in the word
[3:33] like you and I are going Hallelujah
[3:34] today amen they could have but they
[3:37] didn't prepare the oil but that's why
[3:39] we're here today no church building uh
[3:42] in this area there's no no building
[3:44] built for us to assemble there so you
[3:46] love God so much you'll Gather in a
[3:47] man's basement and praise God hallelujah
[3:50] doesn't matter where you gather the
[3:51] church is not the building the church is
[3:53] the body of Believers Hallelujah you're
[3:56] the church I'm the church brother
[3:57] Irvin's the church sister wil is the
[3:59] church We Are One Church one body our
[4:02] body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost
[4:04] hallelujah amen but I want to say this
[4:07] brother R says in 1961 he said
[4:09] trinitarianism is of the devil he said
[4:12] that's thus sayith the Lord but he says
[4:15] he says but he said trinitarians can be
[4:17] saved he said because this is not a
[4:20] Salvation issue this is not am I saved
[4:22] by the blood or am I saved by rosaries
[4:25] am I saved by the blood of Jesus Christ
[4:27] or am I saved by my Creed brother said
[4:30] the trinitarians can be saved he said
[4:32] but the time has come when they're
[4:33] sincerely
[4:35] wrong he said they can be sincere and be
[4:38] trinitarians but he said they're
[4:39] sincerely wrong Hallelujah and that's
[4:42] right the the trinitarian doctrine
[4:43] doesn't pertain to Salvation brother
[4:45] ramam said the same thing about the
[4:47] serpent seed remember I read that to you
[4:48] last time if you got a real good memory
[4:50] yeah back in August brother Ram said
[4:52] serpent seed is the killer he said but
[4:55] it's okay if people can't see it it
[4:56] doesn't to I'm sorry it doesn't pertain
[4:58] to Salvation
[5:00] he said it just shines more light on the
[5:02] gospel truth that we're all trying to
[5:04] see hallelujah amen
[5:08] hallelujah now there's a reason it's
[5:10] very important to not accept three
[5:12] persons I'm going to close with that at
[5:13] the end of this sermon here by God's
[5:15] grace there's a very important reason
[5:18] that that we're not trinitarians as
[5:20] you'll
[5:20] see um but I want to say this you know
[5:24] of my friends that are in denominations
[5:26] many of them are precious people
[5:30] and they're honest people so I have
[5:32] compassion on trinitarians that are
[5:34] honest trinitarians now there's also
[5:36] trinitarians that are total Scoundrels
[5:38] and filled with demon powers you know
[5:41] right I'm talking about the the child
[5:42] molesters I'm talking about the
[5:44] murderers I'm talking about the the
[5:46] greedy money hungry uh liars and false
[5:50] prophets amen right they're lost they're
[5:54] demon-possessed but there are foolish
[5:55] virgins that are saved and I have pity
[5:58] on them I have compassion on them and
[6:00] one reason I do is because the truth uh
[6:03] because the revelation of one person is
[6:05] very close to the
[6:07] trinitarian right it's very close
[6:09] there's still a mysterious element okay
[6:12] so I just want to tell you I have
[6:14] compassion on trinitarians as long as
[6:16] they're foolish virgin all right and
[6:18] brother bam said they can be
[6:21] saved remember Jesus said overall in
[6:24] Matthew 7:14 he said few will find the
[6:27] narrow road that leads to repent
[6:31] so very few trinitarians will be saved
[6:33] let me say this very few message people
[6:35] will be saved amen it's a few it's a
[6:38] small group right because the many are
[6:40] deceived but Jesus said the elect cannot
[6:43] be deceived Hallelujah and how do you
[6:45] know the truth how do you know you're
[6:46] not deceived you believe the Bible
[6:48] Hallelujah you believe thus say the
[6:50] scripture Hallelujah brother Bram said
[6:52] if you got the Holy Ghost he said it'll
[6:53] point you back to the word of God every
[6:56] time Hallelujah he said when you got the
[6:58] Holy Ghost you can say Amen to every
[7:00] word of God hallelujah that's right
[7:04] Hallelujah not every word of brother
[7:06] brandom I hope there's no brother
[7:07] brandom worshippers in here today we
[7:09] thank God for our Prophet but it's not
[7:11] every word of brother brandom it's every
[7:13] word of God hallelujah that's right
[7:15] that's right Hallelujah I don't think we
[7:17] have any brother R worshippers in here
[7:19] so praise the Lord amen I battle that
[7:21] Spirit a lot online so that's why I'm
[7:22] constantly preaching on that by God's
[7:25] grace but uh you know like like last
[7:28] week I put out a video where I told
[7:30] people never baptized in the name of
[7:32] William Brandon isn't it sad people
[7:33] would do that amen it's so sad brother
[7:36] random said that spirit that would do
[7:38] that he said is an antichrist
[7:41] Spirit he said it he said it he called
[7:43] it the devil's toilet now think about
[7:45] those words that's harsh that's harsh
[7:47] words brother Ram said that's a devil's
[7:49] toilet I got the quote from 1961 brother
[7:52] Ram said that he says one of the most
[7:54] awfulest things is some of the Tommy rot
[7:57] things he said I am a sinner saved by
[8:00] grace he said but Jesus is your savior
[8:03] Hallelujah remember 1 Corinthians
[8:05] chapter 1 Paul said I'm glad I baptized
[8:07] none of you except some of you would
[8:09] have said I baptize in my own name amen
[8:13] so see that shows brother R was a real
[8:14] man of God he was so much like Christ
[8:17] that people start baptizing in his name
[8:19] just like
[8:21] Paul and didn't they say John the
[8:23] Baptist aren't you the Messiah some
[8:25] people confuse John the Baptist for the
[8:27] Messiah so see in one way we learn a
[8:29] good lesson let's be so much like Jesus
[8:31] that people have sometimes
[8:34] wonder Hallelujah let's be so much like
[8:36] Jesus so they know Christ is in us
[8:38] hallelujah that's right exctly right but
[8:40] of course we would never go where the
[8:42] Antichrist Spirit takes people and they
[8:44] baptize the name of William brandom or
[8:46] some nonsense like that that's from Hell
[8:48] Jesus Christ is the only name to baptize
[8:50] in hallelujah amen
[8:55] hallelujah now I got a lot of verses
[8:58] here so You' got your Bibles I like some
[8:59] of you to maybe read for me because I
[9:01] like to keep you awake too Hallelujah I
[9:03] like you to read the word of God here
[9:07] now the Bible never says God is three
[9:10] persons but I want Daniel to read
[9:12] Hebrews chapter 1 verse3 brother Daniel
[9:15] and I want brother John Proverbs 305 and
[9:17] 6 so Hebrews 1:3 Daniel and John
[9:21] proverbs 30 verse 5 and
[9:23] 6 there's only one verse in the Bible
[9:26] where it talks about God and the person
[9:28] of God and it's Hebrews 1:3 so brother
[9:32] Daniel whenever you're ready
[9:34] brother who being the brightness of his
[9:37] glory and the expressed image of his
[9:40] person and upholding All Things by the
[9:42] word of his power when he had by himself
[9:45] purged our sins sat down on the right
[9:49] hand of the of the Majesty on high thank
[9:52] you brother Jesus is the express image
[9:56] of his person every catch you yet that's
[9:59] the only verse in the Bible that I found
[10:01] I could be wrong I trust some of you
[10:03] bibl readers will let me know if I'm
[10:05] wrong after service that's the only
[10:07] verse in the Bible where it says God has
[10:10] a person he's a person but Jesus is the
[10:14] image of his person amen amen and the
[10:18] express image means the exact
[10:20] reproduction it means like a fact
[10:22] anybody ever sent a fact yet got a fact
[10:24] machine anybody it's just like a copy
[10:26] machine whatever you put in there you
[10:28] just press copy I do it all the time I'm
[10:29] a school teacher I copy all the time it
[10:32] makes a perfect copy everything's the
[10:34] same Glory that's what God did in Christ
[10:37] God put all of his word in Christ
[10:38] hallelujah amen hallelujah God had a fax
[10:41] machine and he when he faxed himself he
[10:43] put it in Christ hallelujah amen the
[10:47] Bible said in John 1 ver14 the word was
[10:50] made flesh and dwelt among us hallelujah
[10:54] so Jesus's character was fully human but
[10:57] it was fully the word of of
[11:00] God CU Jesus told us in John 14 he said
[11:03] when you've seen me you've seen the
[11:05] father amen the character of God not the
[11:09] spirit of God you'll never see the
[11:10] spirit of God we'll get to that in a
[11:12] little bit but the character of God the
[11:14] nature of God all of God's nature
[11:16] everything that God was however God
[11:19] would have acted that was in
[11:21] Christ so here's a verse that never says
[11:23] Jesus is a second person it says Jesus
[11:26] is the image of the person of God
[11:30] Hallelujah all right now brother John
[11:33] Proverbs 35 and6 there every word of God
[11:36] is pure he is a shield unto them that
[11:39] put their trust in him and add thou not
[11:42] unto his words lest he reprove thee and
[11:44] thou be found a liar all right how many
[11:47] words of God are pure every word every
[11:51] word so if no word caus god a second or
[11:53] third person then we ought not to say
[11:56] that amen but also every word the Bible
[11:59] does say about God we've got to say Amen
[12:01] to and there's got to be a revelation
[12:03] there's got to be some type of Truth in
[12:05] there that we can grab a hold of and say
[12:08] I believe the God's word hallelujah
[12:10] that's why I told my trinitarian friends
[12:11] one time I said I don't I don't doubt
[12:14] anything in the Bible I believe
[12:16] everything the Bible says about God I
[12:18] just reject all your man-made
[12:21] Creeds I believe everything the Bible
[12:23] says about the godhead Hallelujah so did
[12:25] brother Brandon Hallelujah but we don't
[12:28] want to go to heaven and believe you
[12:30] know believe God's three persons and God
[12:32] will call us a liar especially as a
[12:35] preacher I don't want God to say well
[12:37] you lied to the people and you added to
[12:39] my Bible I never want to add I never
[12:41] want to take away praise God all
[12:44] right now I just want to um give you
[12:48] this example this helped a couple people
[12:49] when I shared this think about yourself
[12:53] how many persons are you brother John
[12:55] just you how many persons are you sure I
[12:59] are you
[13:00] sure Levi how many persons are you one
[13:03] one but how many aspects or how many
[13:06] elements do you have to your your being
[13:08] three three amen you're one person but
[13:11] you got three elements or three aspects
[13:14] to your being you're a you have a body
[13:17] you have a spirit and you have a soul
[13:19] that's according to first Thessalonians
[13:21] 5:23 and whose image are you made in God
[13:26] of God man is made in the image of God
[13:29] so man is one person sisters are one
[13:32] person but you have three aspects to you
[13:35] you have a body a spirit and a soul and
[13:38] the church said amen so is God God is
[13:41] one person but he reveals himself as
[13:44] father son Holy Ghost amen one person
[13:49] Hallelujah is it it's mysterious right
[13:51] it's there's a mysterious element to
[13:53] it Hallelujah and I I even like what
[13:56] Paul says in Romans 7 brother Levi he
[13:58] says when I sin it's not me that sins
[14:01] but it's the sin that dwells within me
[14:03] praise God hallelujah so Paul even
[14:06] separates I am not like that sin nature
[14:09] that's not the real me the real me is
[14:11] the seed of God the spirit of God the
[14:14] soul that God placed in me that's the
[14:16] real me praise God that's right
[14:19] amen but of course Jesus had no sin
[14:21] nature in him so he never had to say
[14:24] that Hallelujah but Paul would Paul
[14:26] would separate the difference between
[14:27] his sin nature
[14:29] and the seed of God or the soul that God
[14:31] gave him
[14:33] Hallelujah now uh Levi can you read John
[14:36] 1118 brother John 1:18 and brother Arley
[14:40] can you read 1 Timothy 6:16 brother
[14:43] Arley 1 Timothy 6:16 can you read that
[14:46] brother and then Levi you're uh John
[14:51] 1:18 now these two verses are going to
[14:53] are going to show that you will never
[14:55] see God and no one has ever seen God and
[14:58] you never
[15:00] will because God is
[15:03] invisible think about that I was
[15:04] thinking last night you look at all the
[15:06] we saw those Stars last night I was
[15:08] thinking like all that God just holds in
[15:10] his hand like this whole universe God
[15:12] just holds in his hand he's so great
[15:15] he's so mighty our minds can't
[15:17] comprehend it so let's not be
[15:19] discouraged if there's a few things in
[15:20] the Bible maybe we can't understand
[15:22] everything let's get let's just m let's
[15:24] just make sure God is great in our eyes
[15:27] let's not limit God cannot limit the
[15:29] Holy One of Israel praise God all right
[15:32] just just remember how great this God is
[15:34] nothing is too hard for the Lord
[15:36] hallelujah that's right so brother Levi
[15:39] uh John
[15:41] 1:18 no man has seen God at any
[15:45] time the only begotten son which is in
[15:48] the bosom of the father he has declared
[15:52] him amen amen see no man has ever seen
[15:55] God so even in the Old Testament the
[15:57] Bible said when Jacob wrestled the Angel
[15:59] and he said I've seen the Lord he
[16:01] actually didn't see the invisible Spirit
[16:03] what he saw was a manifestation of God
[16:06] all right is everybody understand that
[16:09] amen physical manifestation yeah when
[16:11] they saw the pillar of fire Moses you
[16:13] know and Israel saw the pillar of fire
[16:16] they really weren't seeing God God
[16:18] himself because God was invisible and
[16:20] God's spirit was inside that
[16:22] fire all right and that's what brother
[16:24] arley's going to read 1 Timothy 6:16
[16:27] notice this verse says God dwells in the
[16:29] light so God is inside of the light
[16:33] brother Arley when you're ready there
[16:34] brother 1 Timothy
[16:39] 6:16 who only have immor dwelling in the
[16:43] light which no man can
[16:45] approach whom no man has seen nor can
[16:49] see to whom the honor and power
[16:52] Everlasting am all right praise God
[16:55] dwelling in the light everybody catch
[16:56] that he's the only one with immortal
[16:58] morality he's the only one with eternal
[17:00] life and he dwells in the light and no
[17:03] man has ever seen him and no man ever
[17:05] will see God we'll never see God as far
[17:07] as the invisible Spirit but we'll see
[17:09] his son we'll see his manifestation of
[17:12] himself amen we'll see the express image
[17:15] of God hallelujah amen glory now sister
[17:19] Rachel do you want to go to uh
[17:20] Colossians can you go to Colossians
[17:22] chapter 1:15 I'll have you read that
[17:25] Colossians
[17:27] 1:15 who else okay let me find this
[17:30] other one I want to read
[17:33] here and sister Miram would you read uh
[17:35] Colossians 29 so I got 115 over here and
[17:38] 29 over here would that be okay
[17:42] Hallelujah whenever ready sister Rachel
[17:44] Colossians 1:15 who is the image of the
[17:47] invisible God the firstborn of every
[17:50] creature Hallelujah so Jesus is the
[17:53] image of the invisible God you'll see
[17:55] that it's many times in the Bible God is
[17:57] invisible so to become visible he made a
[18:00] manifestation of light brother raham
[18:03] said it was like a little Halo now
[18:04] before even that Halo there had to be
[18:06] time space and matter right so God first
[18:08] had to create time space and matter and
[18:10] then a little Halo of light comes out of
[18:12] that and that was Christ that was the
[18:16] word that was God's Veil that was God's
[18:19] manifestation that was God's son
[18:21] something came out of God now he's got a
[18:23] son praise God hallelujah that's what
[18:25] that's what brother teaches it's all
[18:28] over the message you can find it I heard
[18:30] Lonnie Jenkins preach on it it was a
[18:31] beautiful message you ever hear Lonnie
[18:32] Jenkins message on it brother oh it's
[18:34] beautiful yes so after God created time
[18:37] and space matter and then the light came
[18:39] out brother said there's Christ there's
[18:40] the logos there's the sun there's the
[18:43] pillar of fire there's the Holy Ghost
[18:44] amen hallelujah in a visible form
[18:48] because God's invisible the first thing
[18:50] that became visible was his son his word
[18:53] and brother said that was when Jesus
[18:54] said or God said let there be light
[18:57] Hallelujah amen amen that first light
[19:00] that first little Halo of fire the
[19:02] pillar of fire that was let there be
[19:04] light and that was Christ's Spirit
[19:06] hallelujah amen it was the Holy Spirit
[19:09] in a visible form Hallelujah all right
[19:13] he's the image of the invisible God
[19:14] thank you sister Rachel sister Miram can
[19:16] you read 2:15 or I'm sorry
[19:18] 29 for in him I all the fullness of the
[19:22] godhead bodily amen hallelujah in Christ
[19:26] so God put all of himself in
[19:29] Christ Hallelujah now church when did he
[19:31] do that brother Bram said at the River
[19:34] Jordan how many know that the Bible said
[19:37] in in in John chapter one The Spirit
[19:39] descended on Jesus at the River Jordan
[19:41] and it remained on him praise God and
[19:44] then brother R tells us at the
[19:46] crucifixion at some point that Spirit
[19:48] had to withdraw because God had to put a
[19:50] curse on the body of Jesus he became sin
[19:53] that we might be made his righteousness
[19:56] amen but then after he raised brother he
[19:58] said all power is given unto me in
[20:01] heaven and earth hallelujah amen the
[20:04] fullness of the godhead dwelt in him
[20:06] bodily praise God amen amen does
[20:08] everybody understand Hallelujah I know
[20:10] it's a little deep here but it's deep
[20:12] and rich is what brother bam says
[20:13] hallelujah he says like it's like bears
[20:15] looking honey off each other he said
[20:16] that's what it is when we're when we're
[20:18] having good fellowship and the word of
[20:20] God's being revealed amen you're just
[20:22] licking licking the honey off of us here
[20:24] amen it's so delicious Hallelujah
[20:29] so God is invisible but he became
[20:31] visible in in the pillar of fire we say
[20:34] the light of
[20:36] God and then the fullness of God's
[20:39] spirit God put that in Christ
[20:42] Hallelujah now I want to show you the
[20:45] word the real word to use with the
[20:47] father son Holy Ghost the word we should
[20:49] use is not persons but it's
[20:53] manifestations okay so Howard can you
[20:55] get uh 1 Timothy 3:16
[20:59] and Sister Sarah would you get 1
[21:00] Corinthians 12:7 I see you got your
[21:02] Bible there can you get 1 Corinthians
[21:04] 12:7 Sister Sarah would that be okay and
[21:07] then Howard's going to get 1 Timothy
[21:10] 3:16 so this is how you win every debate
[21:14] brother said it's okay to debate
[21:15] sometimes you just don't argue brother
[21:17] Ram had at least three debates one about
[21:19] the godhead one about serpent seed and
[21:21] another it's okay to debate as long as
[21:22] you keep the Christian Spirit St Paul
[21:25] went in the Sabbath every Saturday and
[21:27] reasoned with the scribes and
[21:29] Pharisees that's like a debate it was a
[21:31] good honest debate he's trying to give
[21:33] them reasons to believe Jesus was
[21:35] Messiah Hallelujah I believe the
[21:37] greatest reason he could have said is
[21:39] look at my life I was a murderer I was a
[21:41] Pharisee but look at now I'm forgiven
[21:43] and I'm empowered by the Holy Spirit
[21:45] praise God Hallelujah Jesus lives in me
[21:48] the one I used to persecute now I live
[21:50] for him praise God Amen brother Howard 1
[21:55] Timothy 3:16
[21:57] brother
[21:59] controversy
[22:01] is God was manifest in the justified in
[22:05] the spirit seen of angels preached into
[22:08] the Gentiles believed on in the world
[22:12] received up into glory amen the key word
[22:15] there is Manifest God was manifest the
[22:18] word manifest means to appear God
[22:20] appeared in the flesh it wasn't a second
[22:23] person it was God hallelujah is that
[22:26] right God appeared in the flesh so we
[22:29] always use that word right brother Ram
[22:31] came to point us back to the word of God
[22:33] well let's use the Bible words right
[22:35] that's what we tell our trinitarian
[22:36] friends right I'm not a trinitarian I'm
[22:38] a Christian praise God I'm not a Oneness
[22:41] either because that one word Oneness is
[22:42] in the Bible I'm just a holy ghost
[22:44] filled Saint and I believe everything
[22:46] the Bible says about the godhead amen
[22:48] God is one person Hallelujah I don't
[22:50] need a label I don't need any of that
[22:52] I'm a holy ghost filed Christian
[22:53] Hallelujah the word of God's enough for
[22:55] me brother IR Hallelujah I don't need
[22:57] any anything added on to it I'm a
[22:59] Christian
[23:00] Hallelujah right so the word when you
[23:02] talk about the son you always got to say
[23:04] you always got to remember he's a
[23:05] manifestation of God that body is an
[23:08] appearing of God but God dwells inside
[23:11] the body all right so sorry sister uh 1
[23:15] Corinthians 12:7 here the the Bible says
[23:17] the Holy Ghost is a manifestation as
[23:20] well so that's 1 Corinthians 127 there
[23:23] sister whenever you're
[23:26] ready to Pro amen so see this is
[23:31] speaking of gifts of the holy spirit so
[23:32] when the gifts of the holy spirit works
[23:34] like through brother John when he got
[23:35] healed whether that was his faith or
[23:37] somebody else's faith when his back got
[23:39] healed that was an appearing of the Holy
[23:41] Ghost that's a manifestation right and
[23:44] think about the day of
[23:46] Pentecost who who can uh who can shout
[23:48] it out what was one of the ways the Holy
[23:50] Ghost manifested on the day of
[23:53] Pentecost Tong of fire tongues of fire
[23:56] how else
[23:59] speaking in t speaking in tongues
[24:01] Hallelujah what's another one preaching
[24:03] boldly preaching boldly that's right how
[24:06] about the Russian Mighty Wind amen now
[24:09] think of that 120 licks of
[24:12] fire that's 120 pieces of God Did It
[24:16] limit God was God like well I better
[24:18] stop because I I can't produce any more
[24:20] fires he's he's infinite he could have
[24:23] produced a billion fires amen hallelujah
[24:26] and that steel would not have exhausted
[24:27] his power he appeared on 120 and then he
[24:31] was speaking through 120 with the
[24:33] tongues you're exactly right God
[24:35] speaking through 120 different people at
[24:37] the same time you can't limit God
[24:39] hallelujah amen that's right when he
[24:40] wants to speak he's going to speak the
[24:42] spirit and the bride say come Hallelujah
[24:44] so when God is witnessing through you
[24:46] it's the Holy Spirit manifesting through
[24:48] your life praise
[24:49] God when you sisters train your children
[24:52] and you teach them the Bible That's God
[24:54] speaking through you amen that's right
[24:56] amen that's right
[24:58] you fathers when you discipline your
[25:00] children or just love your children or
[25:01] whatever you got to do when you're
[25:02] telling them the truth that's God
[25:04] speaking through you brother said the
[25:06] bride has a Voice Hallelujah because the
[25:08] spear and the bride say come hallelujah
[25:11] amen these worshippers brother say Well
[25:13] only brother braham's the voice of God
[25:15] you're against the Bible the Bible said
[25:17] the spirit and the bride say come
[25:19] hallelujah amen thank God I always go
[25:22] back to that that false Doctrine I got
[25:24] to preach against that
[25:26] one all right so whenever you see the
[25:28] son whenever we talk about the father
[25:30] son Holy Ghost the son was a
[25:31] manifestation the holy spirit is a
[25:34] manifestation of God it's an appearing
[25:36] of God all right now remember brother
[25:40] told this story many times he talked to
[25:42] a Jewish rabbi remember and the rabbi
[25:45] said you can't cut God in three persons
[25:47] and give him to a Jew remember he said
[25:49] that yes and brother said I don't do
[25:51] that he said Rabbi let me ask you who is
[25:54] Messiah in relation to
[25:56] God and the m Mah said he was God oh
[25:59] thank you brother I appreciate that God
[26:00] give you a reward
[26:02] here give water in the name of a
[26:04] disciple praise God remember brother
[26:07] said that he said he told the man he
[26:10] said uh who is he in relation to God and
[26:14] the the Jewish rabbi said he is God and
[26:16] brother said that's exactly right and
[26:18] brother Ram read Isaiah 9:6 let's read
[26:21] that Isaiah
[26:22] 9:6 Brother Andy do you want to read
[26:24] that brother when you get it Isaiah 96
[26:28] didn't see had a Bible he's got a Bible
[26:30] good and this is the scripture brother
[26:32] random
[26:34] uses whenever you're ready Brother Andy
[26:37] forto us child isor
[26:42] us
[26:49] be amen and this this th brother used
[26:53] this verse to convince a Jew that
[26:56] Christians have the godhead right
[26:58] Hallelujah in fact there's another
[27:00] Jewish rabbi brother Ram said he used
[27:02] this scripture to make instead of a
[27:04] Jewish rabbi he said now he's a
[27:05] Pentecostal
[27:07] Rabbi with the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[27:09] In other words he left the Jewish law
[27:11] and now he came into he was a Messianic
[27:13] Christian praise God amen amen
[27:16] hallelujah because we don't believe
[27:18] Jesus was a second person he was the
[27:20] image of the person of God Amen that's
[27:23] right not a second not a third the same
[27:25] one just in a visible image of him
[27:28] Hallelujah think about that Mighty God
[27:31] Jesus is the Mighty God the Everlasting
[27:33] father the Prince of Peace amen
[27:37] hallelujah now go to Proverbs 8 now

[27:45] curveball right curve balls don't strike
[27:47] you out if you're a real good player I
[27:49] you see them on the TV that sometimes
[27:50] they hit home runs and you can hit a
[27:52] curveball pretty
[27:53] hard but what we're saying is we're
[27:55] getting into the deeper things of God
[27:57] here here Proverbs
[27:59] 8 verse uh
[28:03] 22 this is a beautiful portion of
[28:05] scripture this supports what brother
[28:08] random taught that the the light of God
[28:10] came out of God and that was the first
[28:12] image of God before there was a world uh
[28:17] before there was Angels it was God's
[28:19] light because the Bible said he's the
[28:20] first born of every creature there it is
[28:22] amen
[28:24] hallelujah the logos that Pillar of Fire
[28:26] that first came out of God was the first

[28:34] said I'm the beginning of the creation
[28:36] of God hallelujah oh my see we don't Den
[28:40] we don't doubt any scripture in the
[28:41] Bible brother uran we believe every word

[28:46] the Bible I got to say well I can't
[28:47] preach this or I don't understand it the
[28:49] Holy Ghost will give us
[28:50] understanding Hallelujah Proverbs 8:22
[28:53] this is a long section so I'm going to
[28:55] read this one here the Lord possessed me
[28:57] in the the beginning of his way before
[28:58] his works of old this is speaking of
[28:59] wisdom which is a type of the Holy Ghost
[29:02] I was set up from Everlasting from the
[29:04] beginning wherever the Earth was so
[29:05] before the Earth was wisdom was there
[29:08] which is the holy
[29:09] spirit when there was no depths of water
[29:12] I was brought forth when there were no
[29:13] fountains abounding with water before
[29:16] the mountains were settled before the
[29:17] hills I was brought forth there was
[29:19] already the pillar of fire before

[29:45] Earth nor the fields nor the highest
[29:46] part of the Dust of the world when he
[29:48] prepared the heavens I was
[29:51] there when he set a compass upon the
[29:54] face of the death when he established
[29:55] the clouds above when he Str stren The
[29:57] Fountains of the deep when he gave to
[29:59] the Sea his decree that the water should
[30:01] not pass his commandment when he
[30:03] appointed the foundations of the earth
[30:05] then I was where I was by him as one

[30:48] came out of God he said was playing and
[30:50] the the Hebrew word means

[31:30] the Bible Jesus was the first one to
[31:32] Rejoice
[31:33] hallelujah amen the Angels were the

[37:41] saying God's saying the invisible Spirit
[37:44] and the son this invisible spirit and
[37:46] now this Pillar of Fire this son of God
[37:49] this logos brother calls it now he said
[37:51] let us in other words God is going to
[37:53] work through that manifestation to
[37:55] create everything everything amen
[37:58] hallelujah glory
[38:00] amen and notice he said let us make man
[38:03] in our
[38:04] image Hallelujah father son Holy Spirit
[38:09] Glory oh it's good now Ephesians 3:9
[38:14] Ephesians
[38:15] 3:9 sister Wilma would you read that
[38:17] when you get it Ephesians 3:9 this
[38:20] scripture says God created All Things by
[38:23] who Jesus Christ and Jesus is the
[38:28] word what do you create what how do you
[38:31] create your day how do you create your
[38:32] feelings you create it by your word oh I
[38:34] had a great day I'm gonna have a great
[38:36] day sister Ruth I'm gonna have a safe
[38:38] travel Sister Sarah we're I'm gonna have
[38:40] a great service with Junction City
[38:43] Saints what am I doing I'm creating my
[38:45] day I'm have a good day at work brother
[38:47] Daniel I'm gonna have a successful job
[38:50] tomorrow what are you doing you're
[38:52] creating by Your Word tomorrow I'm going
[38:54] to feel better brother Howard what what
[38:56] are you doing you're creating by your
[38:58] spoken word that's what God did
[38:59] Hallelujah and when God spoke the word
[39:02] that word was Christ amen because Christ
[39:05] is the word hallelujah amen his name is
[39:08] the word of
[39:10] God glory so sister wima Ephesians
[39:14] 3:9
[39:19] and beginning of the world have been God
[39:23] who created all things through Jesus
[39:25] Christ amen how did God create all
[39:27] things wonderful sister wima how did God
[39:29] do it by Christ Christ means the
[39:32] anointing the anointing of what the holy
[39:33] spirit amen so when God said let there
[39:36] be light that word was
[39:38] Christ and then God used that Pillar of
[39:40] Fire brother ra said that Pillar of Fire
[39:42] then started speaking Day One Creation
[39:44] Day two creation and go brother man said
[39:46] God created through Christ the word and
[39:49] now the pillar of fire is speaking
[39:50] hallelujah
[39:52] amen oh my now raise your hand does that
[39:55] help anybody by God's grace the first
[39:57] few minutes of this I got I'm 39 minutes
[40:00] in does that help anybody by God's grace
[40:02] okay I got a couple hands there all
[40:03] right well Hallelujah I hope more people
[40:05] are helped by the End by God's I hope
[40:07] every hand can go up by the end but if
[40:09] not well God gives us different
[40:10] Revelations at different times brother's
[40:12] got both I got both hands up too brother
[40:15] Hallelujah so see now Genesis 1: 126
[40:18] makes sense God can use us because it
[40:21] was invisible plus
[40:24] visible right there's no other noun to
[40:28] use right he has to use us he has to use
[40:32] a plural noun because a noun is a person
[40:35] place or thing right what was the sun
[40:39] the sun was a manifestation it's a thing
[40:42] it's a light Glory it's not a second
[40:45] person but it is a noun so with our
[40:48] English language the only way we can
[40:50] understand God is God saying let us
[40:52] Father and Son invisible and visible let
[40:55] us make man in our image
[40:58] amen
[40:59] glory and I can believe every word in
[41:02] the
[41:03] Bible I believe every word in the Bible
[41:06] and the church said amen there's no
[41:09] verse that stumbles me like the godhead
[41:11] because it all fits it all fits is it a
[41:14] mystery absolutely but we never add to
[41:16] the word nor take away from it amen
[41:20] hallelujah and now we can understand
[41:22] Matthew
[41:23] 28:19 baptize them in the name
[41:26] of the father son Holy Ghost one
[41:30] name one name to the father son Holy
[41:33] Ghost and the Bible says in Philippians
[41:35] 2:9 there's one name that's above all
[41:38] names that's the name of Jesus Christ
[41:40] amen
[41:42] amen one
[41:44] name Hallelujah remember Jesus means
[41:46] Jehovah is our
[41:48] savior right Jehovah so brother says
[41:51] Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus of
[41:54] the
[41:55] new
[41:57] hallelujah oh it's
[41:59] beautiful and like like like like you've
[42:01] heard it say brother Ram said the same
[42:02] thing brother Ram said I'm a father I'm
[42:05] a son I'm a husband I'm a brother he was
[42:07] a grandpa he was a prophet he's a friend
[42:10] he's all these things but he's got one
[42:11] name William Marin brandham Hallelujah I
[42:15] think I counted one time I have at least
[42:17] eight titles I'm a teacher father you
[42:18] know Pastor I might have 10 titles we
[42:21] all have all these titles but that's not
[42:23] my name brother said you can't sign your
[42:25] checks with your tit there's only power
[42:27] in the name Hallelujah so no one was
[42:29] ever baptized in Father Son and Holy
[42:31] Ghost no demon was ever cast out in
[42:33] Father Son and Holy Ghost they're only
[42:35] cast out in the name of Jesus
[42:37] Christ
[42:39] Hallelujah just speak that holy name in
[42:41] prayer and watch demons scatter
[42:43] Hallelujah watch The Darkness scatter
[42:46] you speak that name that name is light
[42:48] and the Darkness must flee hallelujah oh
[42:51] glory to God I got some Smiles
[42:53] hallelujah amen amen first John John 57
[42:57] first John
[42:58] 5:7 brother John you want to read that
[43:00] for us
[43:02] brother so all these so-called
[43:04] trinitarian scriptures can easily be
[43:07] understood if we just stay with the
[43:10] Bible words and we don't add to them
[43:13] Amen brother irin how many sermons have
[43:15] you heard on the godhead here one or two
[43:18] or
[43:22] none okay well that makes me feel good
[43:26] all right I'm just going to throw this
[43:29] over here for there are three that bear
[43:31] record in heaven the Father the word and
[43:34] the Holy Ghost and these three are one
[43:37] amen the Father the word and the Holy
[43:40] Ghost no notice it didn't say
[43:42] son brother said the trinitarians don't
[43:44] like that verse because because they
[43:46] call him the Eternal Son of God like
[43:48] they're so in love with father son Holy
[43:50] Ghost what do they do like this or
[43:51] something like that father son Holy
[43:53] Ghost they're just so in love with that
[43:55] but brother said look God used the name
[43:57] word to show that Christ he's also the
[43:59] word of God God created All Things by
[44:03] his word hallelujah oh it's beautiful
[44:05] and he didn't say he didn't say these
[44:07] three are three persons he said these
[44:09] three are one right just like there's
[44:12] one name to the father son Holy Ghost
[44:14] not names
[44:16] Hallelujah now Jesus's baptism we're not
[44:19] going to go there but Matthew chapter 3
[44:21] when Jesus was baptized trinitarians
[44:23] stumbled they see see there's three
[44:25] persons
[44:27] nonsense Jesus's body was
[44:30] there the dove was there and then there
[44:32] was a voice in one place brother said
[44:34] the voice came from the
[44:37] dove right if the voice came from the
[44:39] dove well that makes it not three that
[44:41] makes only two
[44:44] manifestations all right and I already
[44:47] showed you on the day of Pentecost God
[44:49] was speaking through 120 different
[44:51] people God had 120 lick of fires is God
[44:54] 120 persons no but God can manifest
[44:58] himself as many ways as he wants praise
[45:01] God so at jesus' baptism there was three
[45:03] manifestations that didn't make him
[45:05] three persons that made him all
[45:08] powerful as brother said that makes him
[45:12] omnipresent he can be anywhere he wants
[45:15] as much as he wants as little as he
[45:17] wants he can be anywhere at any time and
[45:19] any place brother Bram said he's he's
[45:21] omnipresent by his for knowledge in
[45:24] other words God knows everything that
[45:26] going to happen out in your Woods there
[45:27] brother herin he knows every little
[45:29] animal every squirrel that's going to
[45:30] get nuts or no no nuts or whatever any
[45:33] chipmunk or what they're going to get
[45:34] God knows everything because he's got
[45:36] four knowledge but then God can bring
[45:38] his presence in as many places as he
[45:42] wants
[45:44] Hallelujah okay so we have at Jesus
[45:47] baptism we have three manifestations of
[45:50] God a voice right we have a body and we
[45:54] have a spear of a dove
[45:56] and I already showed you the son is not
[45:58] a second person the sun is a
[45:59] manifestation of
[46:01] God all right and if if God uh you know
[46:06] God can manifest himself in in three
[46:07] ways at one time that's easy because on
[46:09] day of Pentecost he did over 120 it's
[46:12] that's nothing that's not hard for God
[46:14] is anything too hard for the Lord no
[46:18] Hallelujah now next jesus' prayers in
[46:21] Gethsemane they say was Jesus praying to
[46:24] himself no
[46:26] no the flesh was praying to the spirit
[46:30] brother said he said there's the mystery
[46:33] Jesus was fully human and fully God so
[46:36] when Jesus prayed it was the flesh it
[46:38] was the humanity praying to the
[46:41] spirit all right not two persons but the
[46:45] manifestation praying to the invisible
[46:48] Spirit if we're going to use Bible words
[46:51] and brother Ram said who do you pray to
[46:52] When you
[46:53] pray can anybody say out loud who do you
[46:55] pray pray to When you pray Jesus but
[46:58] where's Jesus if you're born again
[46:59] where's
[47:00] Jesus he's inside you right but where
[47:04] else is he Bible said he sits on the
[47:06] throne in heaven huh so he's in me yet
[47:09] he's up in heaven at the same time amen
[47:12] nothing is too hard for God hallelujah
[47:15] think about that Jesus spirit is in the
[47:17] Saints all over the world but yet his
[47:19] spirit is still in heaven as well oh how
[47:23] great is our God makes want to sing that
[47:24] song How great is Our God sing with me
[47:28] how great you cannot limit God we will
[47:31] not limit the Holy One of Israel we'll
[47:33] let him be all that he says he is and
[47:36] we'll love him for all that he is oh
[47:40] hallelujah thank you
[47:42] Jesus and brother Bram said it was the
[47:44] same for Jesus Jesus's body prayed to
[47:47] the spirit that was inside of it and
[47:49] also in heaven at the same
[47:54] time
[47:56] Hallelujah now how many know the
[47:58] scripture God is not the author of
[48:02] confusion see he's not trying to confuse
[48:05] you but he is showing you how great he
[48:07] is and that he cannot be limited and and
[48:10] brother bam says we in our finite
[48:14] Minds we cannot understand an infinite
[48:16] being completely Hallelujah and brother
[48:20] said then he'll take all eternity
[48:21] brother Irvin to reveal himself to
[48:24] us
[48:27] Hallelujah we'll have new bodies we'll
[48:29] have a new spirit a new mind we'll have
[48:31] no sin and yet Jesus will still be
[48:34] teaching us all throughout
[48:36] eternity that's the kind of God I want
[48:38] to serve right
[48:39] there and there's no end to it sister s
[48:42] sister Ruth there's no end to Eternity
[48:44] now I don't know how to explain
[48:47] that but we are going to be learning
[48:49] about Christ and God throughout all
[48:52] eternity and remember God keeps his
[48:54] headship remember First Corinthians 11
[48:56] here's the order it's woman who's above
[48:59] woman man who's above man Christ who's
[49:03] above
[49:05] Christ
[49:06] God that's the word of God is that
[49:10] right Christ was the body was always
[49:13] submissive to the father just like that
[49:16] Pillar of Fire at the beginning was
[49:18] always submissive to the invisible spear
[49:20] behind it yet not two persons one
[49:24] person oh I like those Smiles
[49:27] amen
[49:31] hallelujah okay we're doing really good
[49:33] on time here by God's grace where am I
[49:36] at okay only at 49 minutes okay great
[49:38] this is better than I thought I've been
[49:40] just trying to hit the highlights here
[49:41] by God's
[49:43] grace okay
[49:48] now I want to go to the Book of John go
[49:51] to John 14 here that's the scripture I
[49:52] want to look up
[49:54] here
[50:04] yeah John
[50:06] 1428 but Levi when you get that can you
[50:08] read that brother John 1428 so now let's
[50:10] look at a little bit on the body of
[50:12] Jesus versus the god inside of
[50:15] him okay so whenever you ready brother
[50:17] uh John
[50:21] 14:28 ye have heard how that I said to
[50:25] you
[50:26] I go
[50:27] away and come again unto
[50:31] you if you love me you would
[50:35] Rejoice because I said I go unto the
[50:39] father for my father is greater than I
[50:43] amen how many can say Amen to that amen
[50:46] so the body of Jesus says there's
[50:50] something greater than me now think
[50:52] about that he's got all of God's spirit
[50:53] inside of him but he says the the father
[50:56] is greater than the son in other words
[50:59] the spirit of God the invisible spirit
[51:01] of God is greater than the flesh body of
[51:04] Jesus and the church said amen see we
[51:06] can't throw that verse out we got to
[51:08] keep that verse praise God Amen but it's
[51:10] true the spirit of God is greater than
[51:13] the body it created it's just like a
[51:15] glove who's greater brother John the
[51:17] glove you put on or the hand in the
[51:18] glove what's who's greater hand in the
[51:21] glove the hand Amen Hallelujah Jesus was
[51:24] like the his body was like the glove
[51:26] brother R say it's like a mask it's God
[51:27] just changing his mask God hid behind
[51:30] the pillar of fire then God hid behind
[51:31] mezc and then God hid behind his son
[51:34] Jesus Christ and he said the father's
[51:36] greater than I who's the great one the
[51:38] great one is the invisible Spirit behind
[51:40] the veil praise God Amen Hallelujah but
[51:43] then God says I'll put all of my spirit
[51:45] all my power all my authority inside
[51:47] that body inside that Veil and the
[51:49] fullness of God will be inside of that
[51:52] Veil praise God Oh Glory
[51:56] see that one always stumbles the
[51:58] trinitarian right because their Creed
[52:00] says the son is equal to the father and
[52:03] no less well that's the verse I bring
[52:05] out right there well your Creeds lie
[52:08] because Jesus said the father is greater
[52:09] than I and the church there
[52:12] amen right it don't take much to throw
[52:15] these trinitarians
[52:17] off because what they they don't even
[52:20] really realize what their Creed says the
[52:22] Bible's not the problem their Creed is
[52:24] the problem
[52:26] so all she need is a couple verses the
[52:29] Creed says uh the father is equal to the
[52:31] Son and the son's equal to the Father
[52:33] the father's equal to the Holy Ghost but
[52:35] the Bible said the Father the Son said
[52:38] the father's greater than I so I stand
[52:41] with the Bible amen the the hand is
[52:44] greater than the
[52:45] glove Hallelujah and church that's what
[52:48] you are you're a glove too may God put
[52:51] his hand in your life today may God put
[52:53] his word in your mouth today praise God
[52:56] and God will use you for his glory
[52:58] that's what I'm hoping is happening
[52:59] right now God is using me as a glove and
[53:01] God's speaking and revealing himself to
[53:03] each one of you that's what every real
[53:05] preacher wants to do like brother said
[53:08] the real gift of God is to get out of
[53:09] the way get the glove out of the way
[53:11] right so the so God can put his hand in
[53:13] there and God can use the gift praise
[53:16] God Amen like I was so blessed that last
[53:19] time couple times I preached on the
[53:21] baptism of Holy Ghost I think five
[53:22] people in here came up now some of the
[53:25] aren't here tonight five people came up
[53:26] and said I was just praying and
[53:28] wondering about the baptism of the Holy
[53:30] Ghost that
[53:31] morning Hallelujah that's what I love
[53:34] when God steps in and God speaks to
[53:36] individuals because he's a discerner the
[53:39] word is a discerner or a judge of the
[53:41] thoughts and intents of the heart and
[53:43] that's how you know God is present
[53:45] hallelujah amen that's right
[53:47] amen and remember that that guest
[53:50] preacher his daughter that night before
[53:52] was at the altar till midnight at asking
[53:55] God for the Holy
[53:56] Ghost and then I come in and preach on
[53:59] the Holy Ghost the very next
[54:01] day hallelujah amen and look and this
[54:05] why I told my church look how humble she
[54:07] was she didn't even get the Holy Ghost
[54:09] because there's a time and place for you
[54:10] to be born but she still came back even
[54:13] though God didn't give it to her she
[54:15] still still came back the next day
[54:17] wantan to worship God and sing God and
[54:19] hear the word of God that's what I call
[54:21] love for God Amen that's right
[54:24] Hallelujah
[54:26] and doesn't that remind us what Jesus
[54:28] said in patience possess your souls
[54:31] that's what we need in America there's a
[54:33] lot of patience praise God right we want
[54:36] everything now speak the word brother
[54:37] speak the word speak to the mountain
[54:39] what if God didn't tell you to speak to
[54:40] the mountain
[54:41] yet what if it ain't time to speak to
[54:43] the mountain then you got to
[54:46] wait
[54:48] right but see Christians in a lot of
[54:50] Christians in America and other
[54:52] developed countries they just want easy
[54:53] religion microwave religion oh just
[54:55] speak the word all your problems will be
[54:56] gone speak the word but that's not how
[54:58] that's not how it always
[54:59] works
[55:01] Hallelujah brother Ram said when Paul
[55:03] was a prisoner to Christ he couldn't
[55:05] cast the devil off that woman with the
[55:07] spirit of Divination in the book of Acts
[55:09] until it was
[55:10] time the Bible said Paul had to wait on
[55:13] God and then finally after numerous days
[55:15] the Bible said he was grieved in his
[55:17] spirit and he said come out of her in
[55:19] the name of Jesus Christ and she came
[55:21] out that hour praise
[55:24] God that's what we need church we got to
[55:26] be prisoners we got to be prisoners for
[55:28] Jesus Christ amen that's right
[55:34] Hallelujah you got to wait on the Lord
[55:37] we must wait on
[55:39] God so I just showed you there the son
[55:43] he says the son says the father is
[55:46] greater than I the invisible spirit is
[55:48] greater than the manifestation amen the
[55:50] spirit is greater than the creation Oh
[55:52] Glory the Creator is greater than the
[55:55] creation hallelujah amen amen hallelujah
[55:58] I'm just trying to clinch that nail
[55:59] brother Iran really put that in I want
[56:01] to put it in all the way hallelujah amen

[56:05] truth it's finished Hallelujah we've got
[56:08] confidence in God's word hallelujah
[56:10] amen here's another one John 5:19 John
[56:13] 5:19 brother Arley will you read that
[56:15] John
[56:16] 5:19 brother RAM used this all the time
[56:20] to tell people that brother random could
[56:22] not heal anybody when he wanted to
[56:24] brother r could not see a vision every
[56:26] time he wanted
[56:28] to and the same thing was true with
[56:30] Jesus Jesus did not he had he healed so
[56:33] many people the Bible said they couldn't
[56:34] even fill the world with books about it
[56:36] but there were times he couldn't heal
[56:38] people because of unbelief or it wasn't
[56:40] the father's will and this is the verse
[56:43] brother R used so Arley when you're
[56:44] ready John 5:19 then Jesus and said unto
[56:49] them verily verily I say unto you the
[56:51] son can do nothing of himself but what
[56:54] he sees the father do for whatsoever he
[56:58] does also the son like Hallelujah the
[57:02] son does what the son does nothing of
[57:05] himself Amen brother mam said Jesus
[57:07] flesh body had no power to do any
[57:10] Miracles now he had Authority Hallelujah
[57:14] but he said I can do nothing of myself
[57:16] in other words brother said see Jesus
[57:18] operated by Vision hallelujah
[57:20] amen Jesus he said I can do nothing
[57:23] except the father shows me first
[57:26] same thing in brother Ram's life right
[57:29] but brother Ram was a sinner saved by
[57:30] grace Jesus was a sinless Son of God
[57:32] born of a virgin
[57:33] hallelujah it's exactly right so see we
[57:37] cannot forget these verses Jesus said
[57:38] the father's greater than I Jesus said I
[57:40] can do nothing except the father shows
[57:41] me first amen
[57:44] hallelujah and neither can you or I do
[57:46] anything they asked brother Ram in 1964
[57:49] they said is it possible for you to
[57:51] speak us into existence so I'm sorry
[57:53] Speak the Rapture into resistance so we
[57:55] get he said so we get bodies that are
[57:58] Rapture Ready and brother he said
[58:00] because of the squirrels and things like
[58:02] that how many know brother spoke
[58:03] squirrels into existence how many know
[58:06] brother spoke the storms and they left
[58:09] amen well they asked him well brother
[58:10] Ram if you God could have you do that
[58:12] could you speak us into Rapture
[58:14] condition with new bodies brother said I
[58:16] see what you're saying and I'm
[58:18] paraphrasing he said but I never asked
[58:21] the father to speak the squirrels the
[58:23] father told me to do
[58:26] and the church said amen
[58:29] amen so like you can't walk out here and
[58:31] say I want corn this afternoon Corn's

[58:41] first amen that's right you got a good
[58:43] thought I mean there's power in the
[58:44] spoken
[58:46] word but I didn't do that on myself God
[58:49] showed me that Hallelujah like my
[58:52] brother cam one time the anointing came
[58:54] on brother Cam and he was talking to his
[58:57] friend and his friend's like hey I'm

[59:24] say it was wonderful amen he sent him a
[59:27] picture of it wow now Cam's not done
[59:30] that
[59:31] since but it was God showing us when God
[59:34] wants to do something he's going to
[59:36] speak his word and you just got to open
[59:38] up your mouth we can do nothing except
[59:40] the father shows us first we've got to
[59:43] do what our we got to do what God calls
[59:44] us to do praise God Amen that's right we
[59:46] can only speak what God call tells us to
[59:49] speak Hallelujah that's right amen amen
[59:54] is that right
[59:56] now we want to be positive the Bible
[59:57] says there's power of life and death in
[59:59] the tongue right we want to be positive
[1:00:01] but it's not from God it's not
[1:00:03] guaranteed to happen unless it's from
[1:00:07] God right like a lot of people were
[1:00:09] expecting Oh Billy Paul uh I'm sorry Los
[1:00:12] Angeles is GNA fall in the ocean before
[1:00:13] Billy Paul died that's not even on tape
[1:00:16] I never put any I never put any weight
[1:00:18] on that quote because it was never it
[1:00:20] was never it's never a quote on
[1:00:22] tape see as much as people can speak and
[1:00:25] oh we'll speak it and all these things
[1:00:28] it wasn't from God it wasn't a word of
[1:00:31] God if God said anything it's going to
[1:00:33] come to pass amen he said my word will
[1:00:36] not return void praise
[1:00:38] God I doubt for me I doubt that it was
[1:00:41] even said I don't even know but I look
[1:00:44] at the fruits of people's Ministries
[1:00:46] Ministries that worship brother brandom
[1:00:48] I don't take a I don't put any weight on
[1:00:49] things they
[1:00:50] say
[1:00:52] hallelujah but when God leads you you to
[1:00:54] speak something it's going to happen now
[1:00:56] listen church this is interesting too I
[1:00:58] have a we have a couple sorry we have a
[1:01:01] uh we have families in our church that
[1:01:02] can't have
[1:01:03] babies they're married they can't have
[1:01:05] babies and I don't understand why we
[1:01:06] have family members and things but on
[1:01:09] two
[1:01:10] occasions God has called someone in our
[1:01:12] church and then me myself to speak
[1:01:15] babies and they
[1:01:18] came so the first one was brother Jose I
[1:01:22] don't know if you remember brother Jose
[1:01:23] he's the Nicaraguan brother our church
[1:01:24] he's got gray hair he goes a real big
[1:01:26] beard like Moses it looks
[1:01:28] like we were at his uh we were at his
[1:01:31] nephew's house and and they wanted
[1:01:33] prayer they wanted to have children
[1:01:34] we're just praying and he's he's got his
[1:01:35] guitar we're just singing Amazing Grace
[1:01:37] I felt the spirit of God fall we're we
[1:01:39] weeping and crying and brother Jose said
[1:01:41] God heard your prayer you're going to
[1:01:42] have a baby and I was like I hope I sure
[1:01:45] hope that was from
[1:01:48] God well 10 months later the baby was
[1:01:51] born on my
[1:01:52] birthday they sent me a picture happy
[1:01:55] birthday brother Jesse this boy was born
[1:01:57] on your birthday and they could not have
[1:01:59] babies beforeand wow God then there was
[1:02:03] a coworker named Nikki at our school and
[1:02:06] she would we were Christians and we
[1:02:08] would just talk and she'd say my husband
[1:02:09] and I can't have
[1:02:11] babies and I was just studying on baress
[1:02:13] right so I said let me come over I'll do
[1:02:15] a Bible study so we had a big group I
[1:02:16] did a Bible study and she's like well we
[1:02:19] just can't have babies we tried I was in
[1:02:21] my prayer one morning I was just praying
[1:02:24] all of a sudden I started weeping and
[1:02:25] crying and I said I speak to that
[1:02:27] mountain of baress in Nicki's life I
[1:02:30] speak to that mount in the name of Jesus
[1:02:32] Christ it's going to move amen I didn't
[1:02:34] even know what I was doing I just felt
[1:02:36] emotional I was crying I went upstairs I
[1:02:39] talked to my wife and said honey I just
[1:02:41] spoke something in the name of the Lord
[1:02:42] but don't don't tell
[1:02:43] anybody cuz I didn't
[1:02:47] know it was just God couple days later I
[1:02:50] was pushing my kids on the swing you
[1:02:52] know how they like to be pushing I got a
[1:02:55] ding I checked my phone and the woman's
[1:02:57] there with her husband they got the
[1:02:58] pregnancy test saying we're
[1:03:01] pregnant I said
[1:03:04] Hallelujah nine months later they had a
[1:03:06] baby named
[1:03:08] Mary I said and I told her afterward I
[1:03:10] said I spoke to that
[1:03:12] mountain Jesus said speak to the
[1:03:14] mountain and it'll be moved but brother
[1:03:16] R says you can't do it when you want to
[1:03:17] you got to be led by God to do it amen
[1:03:20] oh and then for more on that then the
[1:03:22] woman they want to have more kids then
[1:03:23] she said she had a dream of me praying
[1:03:26] for them to have more children than they
[1:03:28] had
[1:03:29] twins I said I don't know why God God
[1:03:31] just puts his servants in there I don't
[1:03:32] know why I'm just we're just Servants of
[1:03:34] God she and she told me that I had a
[1:03:36] dream of you and now we had twins I said
[1:03:39] well I don't know it just it's God's
[1:03:41] people God just God backs up his word if
[1:03:44] you believe God's word God will
[1:03:46] vindicate you praise God Amen that's
[1:03:47] right now in my mind why don't I go to
[1:03:50] church and then speak to the mountain of
[1:03:52] baroness in this church in my family or
[1:03:54] I I can't do it till God tells me to do
[1:03:58] it right and if you've heard brother R
[1:04:01] brother R say the same thing people want
[1:04:03] him to pray and speak the word or have
[1:04:04] Vision he's like I can't have a vision
[1:04:06] unless God shows it to
[1:04:08] me do you remember sister stad cleff
[1:04:10] from Germany remember that
[1:04:12] story there was a German uh military man
[1:04:15] named uh Julius stad
[1:04:17] cleff his wife had a baby the baby
[1:04:21] died and the woman called brother Bram
[1:04:24] and said brother Braham we will my my
[1:04:26] husband he's in charge of the military
[1:04:27] we'll fly you over to Germany to raise
[1:04:29] the baby up and brother Bram said I
[1:04:30] appreciate your faith he said but let me
[1:04:32] get father's word on it
[1:04:35] first a prophet of
[1:04:38] God and and she had seen the baby in
[1:04:41] Mexico raised from the dead she saw
[1:04:45] that so she's like surely God's going to
[1:04:48] do it for
[1:04:50] me and I I want brother R to speak to
[1:04:52] speak the word what brother Ram do the
[1:04:55] Bible brother R said he went out to his
[1:04:57] cave he prayed all night he come back in
[1:05:01] uh sister Ma you know tell her I don't
[1:05:04] have a word from the Lord yet he went
[1:05:05] out a second time and he said when he
[1:05:07] went the second time the Holy Spirit
[1:05:08] told him he said don't rebuke that
[1:05:10] that's the hand of the Lord something
[1:05:13] awful would have happened to that baby
[1:05:14] if it got
[1:05:15] older and brother R went back and told
[1:05:18] me to tell that to sister stadle and
[1:05:21] sister stadle said she said brother was
[1:05:24] there something wrong with my faith and
[1:05:25] brother R said no you had great
[1:05:28] faith because you were asking God for a
[1:05:32] miracle but that's a a perfect example
[1:05:35] brother and then the Lutheran Pastor saw
[1:05:37] that story and he said I appreciate a
[1:05:39] man like brother random who will wait on
[1:05:41] a clear-cut decision from God before he
[1:05:44] says something in the name of the Lord
[1:05:46] amen amen amen in other words brother
[1:05:49] Ram can do nothing of himself brother
[1:05:51] Levi and brother Irving can do nothing
[1:05:53] of themselves we can only do what the
[1:05:55] father tells us to do praise God exactly
[1:05:58] right amen amen same thing with Jesus
[1:06:01] yes the whole point of all those stories
[1:06:03] I guess is to say that Jesus said I can
[1:06:05] do nothing except the father shows
[1:06:07] me praise
[1:06:09] God and brother Ram says sister SF you
[1:06:12] have great faith you would have flew me
[1:06:15] all the way over to Germany just to pray
[1:06:16] for your dead
[1:06:18] baby that's great faith so see church
[1:06:21] when bad things happen don't think you
[1:06:22] have little faith remember you have
[1:06:24] great faith amen because you just want
[1:06:26] God to move but sometimes God calls his
[1:06:29] children home precious in the sight of
[1:06:31] the Lord is the death of his
[1:06:34] Saints all right now let me try to bring
[1:06:37] this down to a close where am I at I'm
[1:06:38] at
[1:06:39] a hour and six you've been a good
[1:06:42] audience you've been patient audience
[1:06:44] nobody's thrown any Tomatoes at me today
[1:06:46] by God's grace now of course nobody ever
[1:06:48] will you're sweet people
[1:06:52] hallelujah so let's let's go if you got
[1:06:54] your Bibles go to 1 Corinthians
[1:06:56] 15:22 1 Corinthians 15:22 I got a couple
[1:06:59] more points I'm going to bring it down
[1:07:00] to
[1:07:10] close this Oneness between the father
[1:07:13] and the
[1:07:16] son it's so beautiful the son is always
[1:07:20] in subject to the
[1:07:22] father I'll say it again the son will
[1:07:25] always be obedient to the
[1:07:27] father all throughout
[1:07:32] eternity Jesus says all the he said all
[1:07:35] power in Heaven and Earth is given unto
[1:07:36] me but there will come a time when Jesus
[1:07:41] will become subject to the father and
[1:07:43] I'm very careful in my words here
[1:07:45] because I don't want to take anything
[1:07:46] away from the
[1:07:48] Bible subject in order in other words in
[1:07:51] back in submission to the word of I'm
[1:07:53] sorry back back in submission to the
[1:07:54] father right now he's got all power all
[1:07:57] authority but the Bible says and brother
[1:07:59] Ram says this in questions and answers
[1:08:01] 1964 he uses the scripture when
[1:08:05] everything is finished when the
[1:08:06] armageddon's finished the millenniums
[1:08:08] finished gag meog is finished the white
[1:08:11] Throne judgment is finished and the
[1:08:12] future home comes down Hallelujah and
[1:08:15] we're all living in the city when
[1:08:17] everything's finish at some point Jesus
[1:08:20] will give and he'll give the kingdom
[1:08:22] back to the father now hopefully that
[1:08:24] doesn't blow your mind too much but if
[1:08:27] it does good for you say Amen to it
[1:08:30] because it's right in the Bible it's not
[1:08:32] it's not something outside the Bible it
[1:08:33] is in the
[1:08:36] Bible see because the Creator will
[1:08:38] always be greater than the
[1:08:40] creation 1 Corinthians 15:22 for as in
[1:08:44] Adam all die even so in Christ shall all
[1:08:48] be made alive but every man in his own
[1:08:50] order Christ the first fruits afterward
[1:08:53] they that are Christ that is coming then
[1:08:55] cometh the end now look then cometh the
[1:08:57] end the end of
[1:08:59] time how many know there's a time after
[1:09:02] the M after the Millennium and after the
[1:09:03] white Throne judgment there's coming a
[1:09:05] time when there's no more time right
[1:09:07] amen hallelujah amen that's the end the
[1:09:11] end of time at the end of time then
[1:09:14] cometh the end the Bible says when he
[1:09:17] shall have delivered up the kingdom of
[1:09:19] God Jesus is going to deliver to the
[1:09:21] father here's the kingdom that you gave
[1:09:23] me I'm bringing it I'm delivering it
[1:09:25] back up to you and the church
[1:09:29] said he's got all power all authority in
[1:09:32] Heaven and Earth but when the end comes
[1:09:36] he says he comes back to the father and
[1:09:38] father I've been faithful I've been a
[1:09:39] good and faithful son amen hallelujah
[1:09:42] and I'm delivering this Kingdom back to
[1:09:45] you
[1:09:48] Hallelujah I can't explain it brother
[1:09:49] Irvin I just believe
[1:09:52] it know God's not three
[1:09:55] persons that's that's what I know for
[1:09:57] sure cuz remember that's that's Egyptian
[1:10:00] that's always a pagan false Doctrine
[1:10:03] remember the uh I'll just briefly
[1:10:05] remember the every false Doctrine has
[1:10:07] always had three Gods right in Egypt it
[1:10:10] was Osiris Isis and Horus and I I I
[1:10:15] wrote about it in my book every false
[1:10:17] religion has always had three Gods
[1:10:18] because Satan is trying to copy God but
[1:10:21] Satan cannot be God so he just ver he
[1:10:24] just perverts God's word right see every
[1:10:27] false religion has these three Gods but
[1:10:29] it's not three Gods there's only really
[1:10:31] one
[1:10:33] God now back to 1 Corinthians 15 verse
[1:10:36] 24 then cometh the end when he shall
[1:10:38] have delivered up to the kingdom to God
[1:10:40] even the father when he shall put down
[1:10:43] all Rule and all authority and all power
[1:10:47] so this is after the devil's been Cast
[1:10:49] Lake of Fire thank God how you looking
[1:10:51] forward to that day no more death devil
[1:10:54] how about all the demons amen how about
[1:10:56] all sickness how about all disease
[1:10:58] there's coming a day when it shall be no
[1:11:00] more praise
[1:11:02] God all rule all principality Powers all
[1:11:05] sin and disease and darkness and
[1:11:07] wickedness all evil will be cast out and
[1:11:10] Jesus delivers up the kingdom to God
[1:11:12] again huj hallelujah amen we're back in
[1:11:14] Eden brother hallelujah we're going back
[1:11:17] to the Garden of Eden but now it's not a
[1:11:18] garden now it's a holy city hallelujah
[1:11:22] amen Hallelujah verse 25 for he must
[1:11:26] Reign to as he hath put all enemies
[1:11:29] under his feet so now we know Jesus
[1:11:32] Reigns until all enemies are under his
[1:11:34] feet then he delivers the kingdom back
[1:11:36] to the father amen this is your kingdom
[1:11:40] father it's a lot like at the beginning
[1:11:42] right Jesus the pillar of fire and the
[1:11:44] invisible spirit it's his it's your
[1:11:47] kingdom everything came from you
[1:11:50] father oh hallelujah amen verse 26 six
[1:11:54] The Last Enemy that should be destroyed
[1:11:57] is death hallelujah thank God
[1:11:59] Hallelujah for he has put all things
[1:12:02] under his feet but when he saith all
[1:12:04] things are put under him it is Manifest
[1:12:06] that he has expected which did put all
[1:12:09] things under him other words we know
[1:12:12] where how how all got put under Jesus
[1:12:14] through God's power it was made manifest
[1:12:17] through the power of God this Holy
[1:12:18] Spirit working through Jesus's body
[1:12:21] verse 28 here it is and when all things
[1:12:24] shall be subdued unto him then shall the
[1:12:27] son also be subject unto him that put
[1:12:32] all things under him that God may be all
[1:12:37] in
[1:12:38] all right now Jesus has all power all
[1:12:42] authority but when death is put away all
[1:12:44] sickness is put away then Jesus delivers
[1:12:47] the kingdom see I'm very careful which
[1:12:48] words I'm using he delivers the kingdom
[1:12:50] and says father it's your kingdom
[1:12:52] Hallelujah
[1:12:54] Hallelujah that's why Jesus said pray to
[1:12:56] the heavenly father Our Father Who Art
[1:12:58] in Heaven HED be your name Hallelujah
[1:13:02] remember in John 20: 17 if you got your
[1:13:05] Bible go there John
[1:13:08] 20:7 just come to my mind
[1:13:17] here John 2017
[1:13:20] there uh brother Daniel when you get
[1:13:22] that would you read that
[1:13:24] here's Jesus after the resurrection
[1:13:26] notice what he says look what notice
[1:13:29] what he says about God and the father go
[1:13:31] brother Daniel whenever you're ready
[1:13:32] brother no
[1:13:38] rush Jesus sayith unto her touch me not
[1:13:41] for I am not yet ascendant to my fathers
[1:13:44] but go to my brethren and say unto them
[1:13:48] I Ascend unto my father and your father
[1:13:51] and to my God and your God
[1:13:55] amen he said I'm ascending to my father
[1:13:58] and my
[1:13:59] God what's talking there the flesh is
[1:14:02] talking the flesh had a father that
[1:14:05] created it the flesh had a God that
[1:14:08] created it he said don't he said don't
[1:14:10] worry I'm ascending up to my God and my
[1:14:13] father your father your God Hallelujah
[1:14:17] the flesh had a
[1:14:19] Creator Hallelujah but yet then there's
[1:14:22] times that God would speak right through
[1:14:24] Jesus right let's go to John 14 I'm I'm
[1:14:26] almost done here I appreciate your
[1:14:27] patience you've been a wonderful group
[1:14:29] of Believers
[1:14:31] here John 148 Philip saith unto him Lord
[1:14:34] show us the father and it will satisfy
[1:14:36] us just show me the father and look what
[1:14:39] the father says right and Jesus said to
[1:14:41] him have I been so long time with you
[1:14:44] and yet thou Hast not known me
[1:14:46] Phillip he that has has seen me hasth
[1:14:49] seen the father and how sayest thou then
[1:14:51] show us the father amen man amen see
[1:14:55] sometimes God would speak right through
[1:14:57] him and then sometimes Jesus's Humanity
[1:14:59] would
[1:15:01] speak Hallelujah brother R said that's
[1:15:04] the mystery the mystery is with the Son
[1:15:08] and the father and I I think I wrote
[1:15:10] this in my book too trinitarians believe
[1:15:12] in three persons right but I we can at
[1:15:14] least narrow it down to two persons now
[1:15:15] we know it's one person
[1:15:17] right but in other words I have more
[1:15:19] respect for people that believe God's
[1:15:21] two persons than three
[1:15:23] because the Holy Spirit and the father
[1:15:25] are the selfs same person because the
[1:15:27] father's holy Jesus called him Holy
[1:15:29] Father and the Holy Ghost conceived the
[1:15:32] body of Jesus if the father and the Holy
[1:15:35] Ghost are two separate persons Jesus had
[1:15:37] two different dads brother use that all
[1:15:39] the
[1:15:41] time right because Jesus was conceived
[1:15:44] of the Holy Spirit whoever conceives is
[1:15:45] the
[1:15:47] father so that's where trinitarians get
[1:15:49] mixed up well who's the father which
[1:15:51] does he have two dads he was con see by
[1:15:53] the Holy Ghost but his father is the old
[1:15:55] man with the great beard so we can see
[1:15:58] how the father and the Holy Ghost are
[1:15:59] the self-saving person so I have more
[1:16:01] respect for people that believe God's
[1:16:02] two persons than
[1:16:04] three but we know he's not two he's one
[1:16:08] amen but the mystery is between the
[1:16:11] father and the son and did you notice in
[1:16:13] Paul's verse in Colossians 2:2 Paul
[1:16:16] never said H the mystery of Father God
[1:16:19] father son Holy
[1:16:20] Ghost right I believe that's Paul
[1:16:22] showing how the real mystery is between
[1:16:24] the father and the
[1:16:26] son
[1:16:27] hallelujah amen it's been good to be in
[1:16:30] the house of the Lord today amen that's
[1:16:32] right I'm almost done I'm almost done
[1:16:33] you've had a great audience here
[1:16:34] hallelujah
[1:16:37] hallelujah now let me close why is this
[1:16:40] so
[1:16:42] important now this is now this next
[1:16:45] thought is my thought I could be wrong
[1:16:46] on this but in Matthew
[1:16:49] 13:33 Jesus tells a parable of a woman
[1:16:53] who hid three measures I'm sorry hid Le
[1:16:55] in three measures a meal and then this
[1:16:58] meal expanded until everything was leav
[1:17:02] now anyone that knows their Bible
[1:17:03] brother said it too leav is sin which
[1:17:06] woman would put sin in her bread or her
[1:17:10] Doctrine and then her Doctrine become
[1:17:13] fully corrupt is that the bride of
[1:17:15] Christ or is that the Roman Catholic
[1:17:18] Church that's the Roman Catholic Church
[1:17:20] three measures father son Holy Ghost
[1:17:23] three persons Holy
[1:17:25] Ghost whatever they
[1:17:28] do I don't
[1:17:30] know that woman is the Roman Catholic
[1:17:34] Church she injected that three measures
[1:17:36] of Trinity in there and now look what
[1:17:38] it's become not only you know uh just in
[1:17:44] Philadelphia uh there was a there was
[1:17:46] investigation and they found hund
[1:17:49] hundreds of thousands of abuse cases
[1:17:51] just in Philadelphia
[1:17:54] of priests molesting boys and girls and
[1:17:57] then they did it then they did a further
[1:17:58] investigation and the nuns were guilty
[1:18:00] as
[1:18:01] well molesting children that's just in
[1:18:04] one
[1:18:05] place so see how this see how you know
[1:18:08] one false Doctrine if it's not repented
[1:18:10] of it's not taken care of it will spread
[1:18:12] to the whole thing amen and we see it
[1:18:15] message churches they get one false
[1:18:17] Doctrine if they don't take care of that
[1:18:18] what does it become now they baptize in
[1:18:20] William brandom's name now they worship
[1:18:21] brother brandham
[1:18:23] right if or the now it's return Ministry
[1:18:26] brother's got to come back and and give
[1:18:28] us rapturing faith if you've got the
[1:18:29] Holy Ghost you've got rapturing faith
[1:18:31] amen hallelujah that's right praise God
[1:18:35] brother R said his ministry was the
[1:18:36] teaching Reign the former rain and
[1:18:40] brother said then comes the latter rain
[1:18:41] which is rapturing Faith Hallelujah
[1:18:44] Glory that's right that's right
[1:18:48] church and brother R says plainly the
[1:18:50] bride will have unleavened she'll be
[1:18:52] unle to the word so this this woman
[1:18:55] cannot be the bride of Christ it must be
[1:18:57] the Roman Catholic church and then you
[1:18:59] see this woman in Revelation 18:4 she's
[1:19:02] a cage full of unclean and hateful Birds
[1:19:05] she's full of it like that full of sin
[1:19:08] just like that bread was full of Leaven
[1:19:11] amen
[1:19:14] glory where did it start with this false
[1:19:17] baptism in father son Holy
[1:19:19] Ghost and then they made a pope office
[1:19:21] somebody show me where the word Pope is
[1:19:22] in in the Bible it ain't even in the
[1:19:24] Bible they call him Holy Father and
[1:19:26] that's blasphemy there's only one time
[1:19:29] holy father's used that's when Jesus
[1:19:31] prayed in John 17 he said Holy Father
[1:19:34] keep them uh through your name that thou
[1:19:36] has given me praise God Amen and they
[1:19:39] steal the title of God and they give it
[1:19:41] to a man who's not holy at
[1:19:46] all my
[1:19:47] goodness now what does this boil down to
[1:19:50] now if you got your Bible Revelation
[1:19:51] 13:6 I'm almost done
[1:19:56] Revelation 13:6 and U sister Ruth would
[1:19:59] you read that when you get that
[1:20:00] Revelation
[1:20:12] 136
[1:20:15] amen who's listening to the seals lately
[1:20:17] brother Ram uses the scripture and
[1:20:20] brother Ram said this is triple
[1:20:21] blasphemy
[1:20:23] so by the end of the church ages the
[1:20:25] Roman Catholic Church is guilty of
[1:20:27] triple blasphemy they blasphemed his
[1:20:30] name how did the Roman Catholic Church
[1:20:32] blaspheme the name of Jesus because they
[1:20:34] took the name of Jesus away and now they
[1:20:36] have titles Father Son and Holy Ghost
[1:20:38] who's everybody the Catholic wedding
[1:20:39] here anybody I've been to numerous
[1:20:41] Catholics weddings you know at the end
[1:20:42] of it what do they say they said I now
[1:20:44] marry you in the name of the father Son
[1:20:46] and Holy Ghost
[1:20:48] what but at our weddings I just married
[1:20:50] Austin Lena last month I said I now
[1:20:52] marry you in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:20:54] Christ amen amen hallelujah they take
[1:20:57] Jesus out of it and whose name is
[1:20:59] greater than Jesus in the Catholic
[1:21:01] Church Mary's
[1:21:03] name right got to pray your rosaries to
[1:21:05] Mary Mother holy mother of God all this
[1:21:07] nonsense they blashe the name of God by
[1:21:10] changing his name and then exalting Mary
[1:21:12] above Jesus amen that's
[1:21:16] right how do they Blasphemous
[1:21:19] Tabernacle our sister read it you know
[1:21:22] how they Blasphemous Tabernacle they
[1:21:24] call Rome the Eternal City of God that's
[1:21:28] blasphemy Revelation 18 shows that City
[1:21:31] will have an end to it hallelujah amen
[1:21:34] God will pour out his judgment upon that
[1:21:35] City amen because all the all the
[1:21:38] murders everything all the guilt goes
[1:21:40] back to there now there must be some
[1:21:41] crazy uh conspiracy theory here Rome
[1:21:43] must be behind everything right even
[1:21:45] this war in Israel all the the war in
[1:21:47] Ukraine somehow the Pope's behind it
[1:21:49] because the Bible says the Roman
[1:21:51] Catholic Church is guilty of all the
[1:21:54] murders it's in the Bible they're
[1:21:57] pulling strings behind the
[1:21:59] scenes that's right and what's the last
[1:22:01] one the Bible said they blasphemed the
[1:22:03] Saints in heaven and brother said they
[1:22:05] blashe the Saints because they pray to
[1:22:07] them right and the Bible said there's
[1:22:09] not there's not aund mediators there's
[1:22:12] one mediator between God and man the man
[1:22:14] Christ Jesus amen so why is this so
[1:22:17] important brother Jesse that I know
[1:22:18] God's not three persons because the end
[1:22:21] result of this if you accept a false
[1:22:22] Doctrine it leads to this it leads to a
[1:22:26] church full of sin full of false
[1:22:28] Doctrine but that's not the Church of
[1:22:30] Christ the Church of Christ is washed in
[1:22:32] the waters of the word hallelujah amen
[1:22:35] hallelujah she's a glorious Church
[1:22:37] Without spotle Hallelujah that's right
[1:22:41] amen and brother Ram said you can get
[1:22:44] the mark in your hand or your forhead
[1:22:46] the Bible says Amen brother man said
[1:22:50] what's the mark in the forehead he said
[1:22:52] the mark of in the forehead is accepting
[1:22:53] their trinitarian Doctrine wow think
[1:22:56] about that church we are one of the few
[1:22:58] people on Earth that don't believe in
[1:23:00] the Trinity or three Gods we're one of
[1:23:02] the
[1:23:04] few most people believe in a
[1:23:06] multiplicity of gods trinitarians
[1:23:07] believe in three Gods really that's what
[1:23:09] their Doctrine says right because the
[1:23:11] father's equal to the son son's equal to
[1:23:12] the father all this they believe in
[1:23:15] three gods and then Hindus have millions
[1:23:17] of
[1:23:17] gods right they can't even step on a
[1:23:19] little ant oh I offended oh offended my
[1:23:22] great great-grandfather whoever that is
[1:23:24] you know or someday that that might turn
[1:23:26] into me I might be that Aunt someday
[1:23:28] they have all these
[1:23:30] Gods right but we are the people of the
[1:23:33] one true God just like Jesus said here o
[1:23:36] Israel the Lord our God is one Lord
[1:23:39] hallelujah amen we're the same people
[1:23:41] with the same Faith the people of God
[1:23:43] who believe God is one person and we
[1:23:45] will not take the mark of the devil
[1:23:47] we'll take the mark of the Holy Ghost
[1:23:49] praise God let's stand to our feet
[1:23:51] Hallelujah thank you for your patience
[1:23:53] praise God how many enjoyed the word now
[1:23:55] everybody enjoyed the word of God Amen
[1:23:56] well thank you I appreciate that both my
[1:23:59] hands are up amen I enjoyed the word
[1:24:00] it's a good refresher to go over this as
[1:24:03] I said I had questions here and then I
[1:24:05] had questions I got email questions and
[1:24:07] everything like that that's just the
[1:24:08] highlights of course you could preach
[1:24:10] brother bam said he could only hit the
[1:24:11] highlights of all these topics he said
[1:24:13] you could take weeks and months just on
[1:24:14] one seal I could take weeks and months
[1:24:16] on the godhead and go through all these
[1:24:19] scriptures but the main thing we do is
[1:24:21] we never add to the word of God
[1:24:23] and we believe everything the Bible says
[1:24:25] about the godhead amen let's bow our
[1:24:28] heads here now as we bow our heads
[1:24:30] church if there's any needs afterwards
[1:24:32] we can have a prayer line if there's any
[1:24:34] needs at all but let's keep this a
[1:24:36] spiritual Atmosphere by the grace of
[1:24:38] God as I said earlier you never know
[1:24:41] when God is going to speak through
[1:24:43] someone right God can he's he's Almighty
[1:24:46] he could speak through a child he could
[1:24:47] speak through a young sister or an
[1:24:49] elderly brother you never know when God
[1:24:52] is going to move so we want to be sweet
[1:24:54] we want to be submissive to the Holy
[1:24:56] Spirit we want to be pleasing to
[1:24:58] God let's bow our heads for a moment
