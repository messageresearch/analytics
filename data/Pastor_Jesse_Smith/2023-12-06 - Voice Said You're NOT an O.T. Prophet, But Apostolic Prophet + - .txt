TRANSCRIPT
========================================
so I got up about 4:00 and got started driving and Billy was sleeping we went into a place and I was thinking on my mind you know what one of these days as soon as I can get the wife up there I won't tell her what I'm going to do but I get up there and I'm going to tell her I love this place a while nobody us going anywhere else let just stay here and that's back from civilization 1100 miles from edburg see way in the wood I thought Bo won't that be fine I won't have to get a haircut and I won't have to dress up and I'll just be a a regular Mountaineer what I always wanted to be and I said I got some guns and some people give me and I'll be a guide like you never heard of I'll just love it now the Lord tells me go down and tell somebody something I'll run out and tell them and come back again and I'll help Bud and we'll really have a real place here I was thinking on that we went into a restaurant to eat little place in a mountain just about 7 7:00 it was getting a little late so I woke Billy up without a gasoline so had to get some gasoline and went into this little place this little restaurant and while there a man come across the street maybe a teeny bit older than I was but he looked like a man didn't he had on a pair of overhauled overhauled jacket riding boots black hat whiskers down on his face like this snow white his hair hanging out from under his back of his hat oh that look like a man not some soft lazy with a cigar in his mouth about that long set with a pair of shorts on around some patio a swimming pool some pop bellied easterner like excuse that expression but a guy look like a man to me hard rough look like it live words God made man to live I was admire you he come into the restaurant and order some pancakes about 15 20 people he had to sneeze you know how some people but he let out a great big healthy wood sneeze look like the wind is bling when he did nobody dared to say nothing no sir I said Billy there's a man at my own heart said Oh Daddy you don't want to be like that's what that's me in the future I said that's me and I sat there a little bit Billy looked up at me and kept on eating his pancakes and I I was finished fine in a few minutes somebody in a booth right around from us with a board this way a back of the booth I couldn't see around a man got up that looked exactly my profile about 75 years old little bitty fell his clothes tied on him ragged and the bud that got up with him was Fletcher Bry exactly gray hair hanging in his face and Billy looked around he said Daddy that looks like you and fleser you can imagine how I felt and the little fell looked like me wobbled up you been standing over a campfire with smoke all over them faces dirty I think their breakfast together a man must have paid 20 cents maybe a cup of coffee or something my heart bounced within me and I watched it Billy said what your Mar you I said nothing I watched that and they went around and went out he said Daddy what some Mar you I said nothing and he got in the car I said he said do you mind driving again I said no he said I'm still sleeping so he went to sleep I went speeding down the road about 55 M an hour in the truck over the mountain coming on towards the the bar down to coming home to Arizona but I was coming down into Utah and as I got there coming down through the mountains about 20 mil out of the city just as it you've heard it as I told you about the morning about the squirrels and all these things have something Somebody went to talking to me a voice just saying as you hear mine I know it sounds neurotically but as I got through expressing have I ever told you anything about what was right and a voice got to talking I was talking to it said carry out your plans and you'll be like that I said Lord I don't want to be like that said your wife will go to she won't live up in them Hills like that and you'll become a bum just as the dream showed you would I said I don't want to be that but the I don't want to have to live like that I I want to do something different but I I was told that that you'd call me to be a a prophet and I want to live in the wilderness like the prophet but I was using my own excuse so I can hunt my own good and he said but that was the prophets of the Old Testament you've been called to be that in a much higher office than thatall he said you have more gifts besides that you was called to pray for the sick and to preach the gospel and uh in the apostolic Farms you know of of greater things many great gifts so why do you wait for me to move you every time you move where is your reward that I see and then said do you remember I told you yes do you remember what brother Roberson told you in your dream in his dream or Vision that you done like Moses you forgot the feeling of your people you forgot the call that I called you to I let the sick lady I want Lord to tell me where to go and not to that's wrong I built myself a complex because the people didn't hear my message and if you God forbid that I try to compare the life of now like Moses that's exactly what Moses did the people wouldn't listen to him when he come to deliver him so he just left him alone and went into the Wilderness but God turned him around and he long forgot the suffering people and then I said Lord if how could I that's right with no education with a grammar school education be able in people standing RS and everywhere to hear the simple gospel it's more it's greater now than it was under the old Covenant he ascended on high and gives gifts unto man Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever Hallelujah then I was talking and I heard it talking to me and it left me and I said bill and he was sound asleep I said Billy was that you and he didn't even wake up and I thought Lord God I slow my car down what does this mean and I said Billy Billy said what do you want and I said you talking to me no why I I want to tell you something I Dreamed a Dream not long ago you remember seeing that guy look like me and flesh ask mother when he get back to Tucson I told her this dream that Billy something happened it's going on now something was talking to me and I I thought it was you he looked at me kind strange and wait a little bit we driving on so a few minutes he went back to sleep again and I was driving along thinking about it what could that mean driving along l in the road and all at once you're to come talking again and he said return did not I tell you in the beginning to do the work of an evangelist amen when I called you down the river did not I say that John the Baptist was sent forth to for on the first coming wasn't John more than a prophet Jesus said to himself whyd you go out to see a prophet said more than a prophet amen amen then it all begin to come to me I begin to to Wonder then he reminded me again of the of the people how doing what Moses did how can Moses reach the people in the wilderness how can I reach the people in the wilderness exactly the same thing then it comes this second Timothy 4 remember when we dedicated the church that morning 30 years ago some of you Oldtimer when he showed me them trees and I planted them on both sides you remember that you remember the Visions all wrote in books and on tapes and everything the years ago how I've seen these and I I never crossed up the Oneness in the Trinity I stood between them and planted these trees and they were the only two trees that had pruit and now all the trees grew up about 30 ft and stop things went PL into heaven broke off of the same Branch see one on one side one on the other and I broke them you remember the vision wrot books since in my life story know and they went put up into heaven like that quickly and he said hold out your hands for the fruit and then I found the same fruit in the cross want to run down there and he said do the work of an evangelist make fullprof your ministry the time will come when they not endure sound doctor don't quit them and keep going that all come into my mind and then
