TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] Revelation chapter 14 the themes of this chapter include the lamb with his 144,000 Jewish saints on Mount Zion the announcements of three angels and the Battle of Armageddon the symbols and key revelations include the father's name written in their foreheads the three angels the Saints that keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus the harvest of the earth and the winepress of the wrath of God the father's name written in their foreheads is a symbol of the baptism of the Holy Ghost as previously taught in Revelation 7 verse 3 and revelation 9 verse 4 this is the same Holy Ghost baptism that Jesus urged his followers to receive in acts 1 verse 5 which they did receive on the day of Pentecost in acts 2 verse 4 and is the seal of the Holy Ghost that we Gentiles must receive today right now according to Ephesians 4 verse 30 and John 3 verse 7 so in Revelation 14 the Jewish people who were previously blinded to receiving Christ as their Messiah are now able to see him as their Savior and are born again by the Holy Ghost note that the father's name in the forehead is a contrast to the horse forehead which is Old Testament language mentioned in Jeremiah chapter 3 verses 1 to 15 which is a bold defiant face that refuses to be ashamed of sin the mother harlot of Revelation 17 has this forehead in the New Testament just as a refuses to be ashamed of her sin the true Jewish church is a woman who is boldly in love with Christ and refuses to be ashamed of the gospel of Jesus today the New Testament church called Jesus's bride has this seal in her soul and so will the 144,000 born-again Israelis recall from 1st Thessalonians 5:23 that man has three parts to his being a body human spirit and soul the human spirit is renewed day by day according to Ephesians 4:23 and 2nd Corinthians chapter 4 verse 16 so the baptism of the Holy Ghost has to be in the soul of man Christians today are sealed in their soul because jesus said he would send a rest for your soul according to Matthew 11 verse 29 the three angels of verses 6 through 12 seem to be symbols of human messengers or preachers because verse 6 says this angel preaches the everlasting gospel and we know that God does not send heavenly angels to preach and save souls but rather men who are anointed of the Holy Ghost are often called angels it seems these angels are human messengers because we have already seen God call men angels in Revelation chapters 1 2 and 3 along with numerous other scriptures galatians 4:14 first samuel 29 verse 9 ii samuel 1927 and revelation 22 verses 8 and 9 these three angels seem to be the final three church age messengers to the Sardis age the Philadelphian age and the Laodicean age which are Martin Luther John Wesley and William Branham respectively the Saints that keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus is a phrase used to reveal that this group believes both the Old Testament and the New Testament and recognize Jesus Christ as the Messiah that was sent to the Jews but was rejected and then received by the Gentiles a similar phrase is used to describe believers who believe Jesus Christ is the Messiah promised in the Old Testament and have now received his Holy Spirit in the New Testament as ta'en revelation 1 verse 2 revelation 1 verse 9 Revelation chapter 6 verse 9 and Revelation chapter 12 verse 17 the harvest of the earth is a symbol of Christ gathering two separate groups to two separate locations at the end of the world according to Matthew 13 verses 38 through 40 one group is the wheat or true believers who lived righteously and will be gathered to the kingdom of their father which is with Jesus at the marriage supper of the lamb and then to reign with Christ in the 1,000 year earthly millennial reign the other group is to the unbelievers who do wickedly and will be gathered to the furnace or fire or hell in the heart of the earth to await their judgment at the white throne judgment the winepress of the wrath of God is a symbol of the slaying of the sinners who took the mark of the beast and worshipped His image at the Battle of Armageddon because verse 20 says there is blood that comes out of the winepress the Battle of Armageddon is also seen in two other portions in the book of Revelation revelation 19 verses 11 to 21 and revelation 16 verse 16 which tells us the Battle of Armageddon is a gathering of those unbelievers who took the mark of the beast in defiance against Jesus Christ and his followers revelation 19:11 221 tells us that this battle is Christ taking these unbelievers through the winepress according to revelation 19:15 and it tells us how the slaying takes place the sword or word that proceeds out of Jesus Christ's mouth smites these beasts worshippers and then the birds or fowls of the skies of the heavens will be filled with their flesh the timing of events is as follows it seems that chronologically the messages of the last three angels in verses 6 to 12 seems to come first because God is still dealing with the Gentiles every nation kindred tongue and people according to chapter 14 verse 6 and letting them hear the preaching of the everlasting gospel recall that God will only move on to dealing with the Jews until every Gentile believer is sealed into the kingdom of God according to Luke 21 verse 24 and Romans 11:25 the next event chronologically would be the scene of the Lamb and the 144,000 on Mount Zion which is seen in verses one through five Christ will most certainly first redeem these 144,000 since they are called firstfruits in chapter fourteen verse four before he destroys all the rest of the men and women on the earth the beast worshippers which is what we see in verses 13 through 20 in this chapter the Battle of Armageddon in verses 13 through 20 will be the last event before the 1000 year millennial reign of peace upon the earth for all evil men including all earthly leaders will be slain and then the kingdom of Christ will reign upon the earth for 1,000 years or the Lord's Day with Christ ruling nations with a rod of iron a corner Revelation 19 verse 18 if you would like more bible scriptures
