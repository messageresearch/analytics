[16:03] she said they have a high uh she's now
[16:05] they have a high rate of coronavirus
[16:07] cases so
[16:08] she said pray that they don't get too
[16:11] high where she would have to quarantine
[16:13] when she gets back i guess if it's high
[16:14] enough
[16:16] ohio would make him quarantine or
[16:18] something like that so
[16:19] she asked for our prayers so let's pray
[16:21] for her tonight

[17:20] infirmity so let's touch the throne of
[17:22] god tonight

[26:07] [Music]
[26:45] [Music]
[26:50] do
[26:53] [Music]
[27:29] just came to my heart there i thought
[27:30] we'd take it tonight praise god
[27:32] thank the lord let's take our bibles i'd
[27:34] like to uh
[27:35] look at blessings and cursings again
[27:37] tonight by god's grace
[27:39] and go a little bit further here though
[27:41] simon i had a good talk last night and
[27:42] it's kind of got some thoughts going
[27:44] so lord willing uh let's open up with
[27:48] a familiar one let's go to
[27:52] deuteronomy 29
[28:08] you're driving me 29
[28:18] now here uh deuteronomy 29
[28:22] look at verse 16 i'd like to uh just
[28:25] bring to your members this
[28:26] scripture is using the church age book
[28:28] regarding idolatry and names being
[28:31] removed
[28:32] out of the book of life so deuteronomy
[28:34] 29
[28:35] 16 to verse verses 16 to 20.
[28:52] all right jeremy 29 16 through 20.
[28:59] this is a little bit lengthy reading but
[29:01] i thought it'd be helpful you know
[29:02] brother graham felt led of the lord to
[29:03] put in the church age book so i'd like
[29:04] to read it here
[29:05] uh all of it tonight uh maybe we'll all
[29:09] read the last verse together because
[29:10] it's so
[29:11] well four verses five verses long so let
[29:14] me read the first few verses alone
[29:16] and then we'll read that last verse 20
[29:18] together verse 16
[29:19] for ye know how ye have dwelt in the
[29:21] land of egypt and how we came
[29:23] through the nations which passed by
[29:25] which he passed by rather
[29:27] and ye have seen their abominations and
[29:29] their idols wooden stones silver and
[29:31] gold
[29:31] which were among them lest there should
[29:33] be any
[29:35] among you man or woman or family or
[29:37] tribe bless you
[29:38] whose heart turneth away this day from
[29:41] the lord our god
[29:42] to go and serve the gods of these
[29:44] nations
[29:45] lest there should be among you a root
[29:47] that beareth gall and wormwood
[29:49] and it came to pass when he heareth the
[29:51] words of this curse that he bless
[29:53] himself in his heart saying i shall have
[29:55] peace though i walk in the imagination
[29:57] of mine heart
[29:58] to add drunkenness to thirst
[30:02] okay so that the scripture is speaking
[30:05] of a man who
[30:06] in israel who hears the curse but he
[30:08] blesses himself and said oh
[30:10] ah that's not going to happen i'm not
[30:11] going to be cursed let's read verse 20
[30:13] together here
[30:15] uh let's read him three one two three
[30:17] the lord will not
[30:19] spare him but then the anger of the lord
[30:22] and his jealousy jealousy sorry shall
[30:24] smoke against that man
[30:27] and all the curses that are written in
[30:29] this book
[30:30] shall lie upon him and the lord shall
[30:33] blot out his name
[30:34] from under heaven let's have a word of
[30:36] prayer tonight by god's grace
[30:37] that's the holy spirit to guide us and
[30:39] help us heavenly father god we're
[30:41] gathered in your house
[30:42] uh it's a privilege to be on the
[30:43] battlefield for the lord and lord we
[30:45] promise you
[30:46] we'll serve you until we die or until we
[30:48] have the body change preferably lord
[30:50] the body change lord as all of us don't
[30:53] want to die
[30:54] but lord we want to live to see the
[30:56] coming of the lord but lord nevertheless
[30:58] not
[30:58] our will but thy will be done so lord
[31:01] take this night lord guide me
[31:03] lord help the people feed them lord god
[31:06] may they pull and may i pull on you and
[31:08] lord may you speak to us by the holy
[31:10] spirit as we desire
[31:11] to experience your blessings father god
[31:14] and lord
[31:15] enjoy them to the fullest capacity lord
[31:18] where we're fully surrendered minds
[31:20] fully surrendered wills and our souls
[31:22] lord have
[31:23] your nature inside of them by the holy
[31:26] spirit seal of god
[31:27] so lord speak to us here tonight and
[31:29] help us lord help those physically that
[31:31] press their way out to the house of god
[31:33] bless them lord abundantly
[31:34] those live streaming and lord also those
[31:37] on the archive may your spirit help them
[31:39] in jesus christ's name and the saint
[31:40] said amen praise god god bless you as
[31:43] being seated praise god
[31:46] and i think i might as well just thank
[31:47] everybody i want to thank thank
[31:49] naomi and uh beatrice and wesley for the
[31:51] nice card there
[31:53] thank you i i sure appreciated that that
[31:55] really made
[31:56] me made me feel good i guess everybody
[31:58] you know i
[31:59] appreciate all the cards i haven't had
[32:01] time to get back to it you know we're
[32:03] we had guests to like 10 30 last night
[32:05] and had to get ready for work and
[32:07] i had to work we had a meeting this
[32:08] morning at 8 10 and i didn't really have
[32:10] any time to
[32:11] get back to anything so lord willing i
[32:13] like to get back to
[32:14] thanking everybody but i appreciate that
[32:16] i literally went to bed last night with
[32:17] a big old smile on my face so
[32:19] i just told my wife i said honey how do
[32:21] you do it how are you so smart to plan
[32:24] this out
[32:25] i just couldn't stop smiling i don't
[32:28] think i could ever pull something off
[32:29] like that but we need to try children
[32:31] you need to help me so well we'll have
[32:33] to do something like that one of these
[32:34] days lord willing
[32:36] so yeah i really appreciate everybody's
[32:37] love and i just really felt like
[32:39] i could hardly contain my happiness last
[32:41] night so i i just thank you and
[32:43] and thank the lord for his grace i guess
[32:45] they say 40 is the new 30 right is that
[32:47] they say
[32:50] [Music]
[32:52] 40 is the new 30 like like 50 50 is the
[32:55] new
[32:56] uh i'm sorry 50 is the new 40 right
[32:59] so in other words uh whatever age you
[33:01] are it's like you're 10 years younger
[33:03] so i guess that's a new saying you can
[33:05] switch over here i got some slides here
[33:07] tonight
[33:07] by god's grace i just thank the lord and
[33:10] um you know god is rich in mercy
[33:12] so we give god all the praise and
[33:14] thankful for another year to serve the
[33:16] lord
[33:17] so we just read this tonight church and
[33:19] brother ram uses this scripture to show
[33:21] why are two tribes deleted so tribes are
[33:24] deleted because of pride
[33:26] because they they say oh i'm okay
[33:29] uh well they say i'm blessed by god
[33:33] so god considers this a literal curse
[33:35] when when you know this is iniquity when
[33:37] you
[33:38] know what to do you know right but
[33:40] instead you try to avoid the curse or
[33:42] the punishment of god
[33:43] and people take upon themselves or they
[33:46] try to bless themselves
[33:47] but ultimately they'll be cursed because
[33:49] they're into idolatry remember they have
[33:51] idols
[33:52] wood stone silver gold now we don't see
[33:54] a lot of that in america we see
[33:56] the idols of money right we see the
[33:58] idols of uh popularity
[34:01] uh pride and all these idols in america
[34:04] we just see them
[34:04] all over the place but the cause uh
[34:08] or sorry the curse rather against
[34:09] idolatry is names blotted out
[34:12] i think the closest thing for us would
[34:14] be those who worship brother branham as
[34:16] we've labored on that
[34:17] you know 14 20 services whatever we've
[34:20] labored on that so i'm not going to
[34:21] spend much time on that
[34:22] but i think that's the closest ones we
[34:23] have to be careful of but remember
[34:25] brother said you can make a piano
[34:27] a idol all right malcolm you can make uh
[34:31] a car right brother jess yeah you can
[34:34] make uh your husband your wife
[34:36] brother you can make a pastor you can
[34:38] make a preacher you can make anything an
[34:40] idol right
[34:41] so we don't want to make anything an
[34:42] idol uh we want to
[34:44] recognize god's curses and his blessings
[34:47] and we want to
[34:48] obey god's word and we don't want to be
[34:50] prideful
[34:51] and think well we're we're close enough
[34:53] with god where we don't have to keep
[34:54] god's word
[34:56] remember the promise is if you
[34:57] diligently hearken in the word of god
[34:59] you'll be blessed praise god but it's
[35:02] diligent hearkening
[35:03] unto god now i want to finish the quote
[35:06] brother brahman gives us the next part
[35:07] of the quote
[35:08] hearing is pronounced the curse against
[35:11] idolatry
[35:12] or spiritual fornication the tribe that
[35:14] turned to idolatry was to have its name
[35:16] blotted out
[35:17] and the history of the two tribes whose
[35:19] names were brought out because of
[35:21] idolatry is found in the first king so
[35:22] we're not dead and ephraim we we're
[35:23] familiar with that right dead and
[35:24] ephraim we know their names are blotted
[35:26] out
[35:26] just under heaven not in heaven just
[35:29] under heaven which is another strange
[35:30] mystery i don't know anything about
[35:32] and i don't know anybody that does how
[35:34] your name can be blotted out from
[35:36] under heaven but not in heaven i'm not
[35:38] sure how that works must be a temporary
[35:39] judgment or something like that
[35:41] okay now i want to take this service
[35:43] tonight in the next uh
[35:45] 30 let me do 40 minutes here
[35:48] and i want to go through my remaining
[35:50] quotes that i had found from brother
[35:52] branham
[35:53] and then i want to go uh to back to this
[35:56] preacher that simon and i and cam and
[35:58] i've actually been listening to
[35:59] the pentecostal preacher who first we we
[36:02] heard talk about curses and blessings
[36:04] so i want to get to that and then i want
[36:07] to close with how jesus
[36:08] allows us to go through punishments or
[36:10] temporary curses in order to teach us
[36:12] right in order to humble us so i want to
[36:15] just close with that so that's where you
[36:17] know i'm going
[36:17] by god's grace so i tried to put it all
[36:19] together uh where it seemed like it
[36:21] would
[36:22] fit together so may god help me by god's
[36:24] grace
[36:25] now roman says sometimes sickness is a
[36:27] curse
[36:28] and that's deuteronomy 28 22. i'm going
[36:30] to read that just for
[36:31] uh your sake and my sake deuteronomy 28
[36:36] 22 remember we read through this chapter
[36:38] a couple weeks ago
[36:40] and uh lord willing it was just a
[36:43] beautiful beautiful chapter of blessings
[36:45] curses are are just such a powerful
[36:47] warning
[36:48] against unbelief so deuteronomy 28
[36:52] 22. the lord shall smite thee with a
[36:55] consumption
[36:56] and with a fever and with an
[36:58] inflammation and with an extreme burning
[37:00] and with the sword and with blessing
[37:02] and with mildew and they shall pursue
[37:05] thee
[37:06] until thou perish now church when i was
[37:08] sick with covet i don't know why i was
[37:10] sick
[37:11] i sought god i didn't know if there was
[37:13] anything i need to repent of you know i
[37:14] had my daily battles my mind battles and
[37:16] you know i fall short of god's glory
[37:18] sometimes i get discouraged
[37:19] sometimes i feel sorry for myself maybe
[37:22] i'll battle pride or
[37:23] you know different things i battle but
[37:24] when i was laying in the bed for that
[37:26] two days or a day and a half or
[37:28] two and a half days i i can't get i
[37:29] can't remember i couldn't i could just
[37:31] confess
[37:32] everything and i didn't know why i was
[37:33] sick but i just kept saying it's lying
[37:36] vanity so
[37:37] i personally i don't i didn't feel like
[37:38] i had anything that i'd done wrong
[37:40] maybe it was just a test uh and again uh
[37:44] there was many blessings that came out
[37:45] of it you know brother randy being here
[37:46] brother amen got the
[37:48] fellowship with him quite a bit and but
[37:50] amnesty was really encouraged
[37:51] everybody amen i told him i said brother
[37:53] i said you gotta we gotta find the
[37:55] blessing and everything even though i
[37:56] wasn't here all those four services
[37:58] i said look you got the fellowship with
[37:59] brother randy you probably wouldn't have
[38:01] had that if i was here
[38:02] because i would have been with the
[38:03] preacher right and so he got
[38:06] he was so encouraged you should have saw
[38:07] amen he was he was like lighting up like
[38:09] a light bulb you know
[38:10] uh so i said all things work together
[38:13] for good to them that love the lord
[38:14] and then he said he got the fellowship
[38:16] with brother nathaniel after service you
[38:18] know
[38:18] um so i thought well that's at least one
[38:21] blessing that i can see to come out plus
[38:23] i got to rest at home for a while
[38:25] i got to make that video at home the one
[38:26] about how to receive the holy ghost
[38:28] i got to make that recovering from coven
[38:31] and
[38:32] i got numerous good testimonies back
[38:33] from that people really enjoy that so
[38:35] uh you know i don't know why i search my
[38:38] heart i'm not quite sure
[38:39] but that's one of the curses if you
[38:41] don't obey god
[38:43] is fever consumption right inflammation
[38:46] burning the swords you're getting cut
[38:48] with the sword battle
[38:50] mildew all these things
[38:53] now here's where broadband says it now i
[38:55] know it's really small i wonder
[38:57] i wanted to make this i want to cut what
[38:58] i do is i cut them in half and then i
[39:00] expand the the font size
[39:01] so i'm sorry so i hate to hurt your eyes
[39:04] but i'll read it
[39:05] if his children will only take his word
[39:07] so he can prove it
[39:08] by you so god god needs somebody to
[39:10] prove his word by
[39:12] so he chooses you so if he's going to
[39:15] prove he's a healer
[39:16] who's got to get sick me
[39:20] right you we got to get sick he needs
[39:22] somebody to prove his word by
[39:25] right somebody had to be lost so they
[39:26] could be saved
[39:28] right amen somebody had to be drunken so
[39:30] god can sober him up praise god
[39:32] someone had to be an addict so they
[39:34] could be set free praise god
[39:37] he said that's the only way he can prove
[39:39] his word he doesn't prove it to
[39:41] unbelievers
[39:43] because he says because they can't be
[39:45] proved they're unbelievers
[39:47] but it's not to unbelievers it's not for
[39:50] them believers
[39:51] it's to him that believe
[39:54] and if you can find somebody who believe
[39:56] his work
[39:57] he will prove his word by you amen
[40:01] praise god sometimes sickness and these
[40:04] happen to us that way that god can prove
[40:07] himself how many can say lord
[40:09] help me to humble myself that when i get
[40:11] sick
[40:12] i'll be thankful in it praise god and i
[40:15] can and lord help me to remember
[40:17] that it may be you just trying to get
[40:20] uh or to me to prove your word is true
[40:24] you're just using me as someone who can
[40:26] be a testimony
[40:27] that believes the word is true and you
[40:29] can use me in other words lord
[40:31] borrow my body to do a miracle
[40:34] how many trust god that much praise the
[40:37] lord
[40:38] our brother donnie reagan said i really
[40:40] like that line lord
[40:41] you can borrow my body if you want to
[40:43] fulfill your word i thought wow what a
[40:45] what a humble word that is what a humble
[40:48] attitude that is
[40:49] do you remember the blind man that jesus
[40:51] found they said who sinned he or his
[40:52] father mother
[40:53] in other words who cursed this man right
[40:55] who curses blind men
[40:57] he said in this case neither huh
[41:00] blindness isn't a curse
[41:01] not always but that the works of god
[41:05] might be made known see it happened to
[41:09] the boy
[41:09] so that jesus could be glorified oh god
[41:12] help us to see our trials amen
[41:15] help us to see our difficulties our
[41:17] discouragements
[41:18] our frustrations as an opportunity that
[41:21] christ could be glorified
[41:25] he said this this is the line i love he
[41:27] said sometimes
[41:28] sickness now look at this church this is
[41:29] in 1965 this is uh
[41:31] eight months before he passed sometimes
[41:34] sickness
[41:35] is not a curse it's a blessing
[41:40] yeah i know it takes a lot of faith to
[41:41] say amen to that that's why i didn't
[41:42] hear that many amens right
[41:44] you're bad we're having that mind battle
[41:46] right not the soul battle the soul
[41:48] wants to say amen but it's that mind
[41:52] i don't know about that it's hard to be
[41:55] sick right that's what i say it's hard
[41:57] it's hard to be sick sometimes it's a
[42:00] blessing
[42:00] that we can stick our faith out there
[42:05] and call those things which are not as
[42:08] though they were
[42:10] right like lying vanities like bang
[42:12] taught me that good lesson there
[42:14] god said so and he'll prove it so if
[42:17] you'll just not
[42:18] weaken under the test
[42:21] wow in all of our trials god just wants
[42:24] to be strong
[42:25] under the test to handle and carry the
[42:28] heavy load amen
[42:29] god just wants us to carry the cross
[42:31] praise god
[42:32] to bear the cross he's just asking us to
[42:35] bear the cross a little longer
[42:37] and just hold up with faith i know god's
[42:39] going to bring me up i know god's going
[42:41] to bring me up
[42:41] and then when he does he gets all the
[42:43] glory because church you and i know
[42:45] in our humanity we can't do anything of
[42:47] ourselves
[42:48] right we can't i couldn't make the covet
[42:51] leave any sooner
[42:52] i tried to rebuke it i tried to speak
[42:54] against it of course maybe that helped
[42:55] maybe did bring it out sooner
[42:57] but none of us can do it of our own
[42:59] power we don't have the power to divide
[43:01] healing
[43:01] within ourselves in all resting god but
[43:04] god is
[43:05] fighting and wanting to find somebody he
[43:07] can prove his word on divine healing as
[43:09] the truth
[43:11] praise god boy it's hot in here tonight
[43:12] man i turned up to 70. i shouldn't turn
[43:15] up so high
[43:16] he said he could prove job look he could
[43:19] test job
[43:20] one time that he wouldn't curse him to
[43:21] his face look at the trial that joe went
[43:23] through
[43:24] but down in the very jaws of death yet
[43:26] he said the lord gave
[43:27] the lord take away blessed be the name
[43:30] of the lord
[43:31] he certainly believed that god proved
[43:33] his word to joke he approved it to
[43:34] abraham he proved it so
[43:36] how many want god to prove his word to
[43:38] them amen i do praise god now it's hard
[43:41] to say lord
[43:42] do whatever you want to prove your word
[43:44] to me
[43:45] but i want to say that tonight lord by
[43:47] your grace from my
[43:48] soul do whatever you have to do to prove
[43:51] your word to me
[43:52] and that i can be used to glorify your
[43:54] name amen
[43:57] praise god
[44:01] this next thought is on curses for
[44:04] disobeying the word yeah i think i read
[44:06] this one
[44:07] sunday but let me just read it again
[44:09] deuteronomy 28 14 and 15
[44:13] if thou shalt not go aside from any of
[44:15] the words which i command thee this day
[44:17] look at that yet obey every word
[44:18] just like jesus said live by some words
[44:21] no live by every word
[44:24] he said to the right hand or to the left
[44:27] to go after other gods
[44:28] to serve them see that's the only reason
[44:31] god says people leave the narrow path
[44:33] is to serve other gods right or to serve
[44:35] their lusts of their flesh or
[44:37] or to serve their their own desires
[44:40] their own will
[44:42] that's the only reason you turn off the
[44:44] narrow way
[44:46] verse 15 but it shall come to pass if
[44:48] thou will
[44:49] not hearken unto the voice of the lord
[44:51] thy god to observe to do
[44:53] all of his commandments and his statutes
[44:55] which i command thee this day that all
[44:56] these curses shall come upon thee
[44:58] and overtake thee now look at that
[45:02] so see in other words uh in other words
[45:05] if you and i
[45:06] if we disobey god and we go off in the
[45:09] wrong path we've got
[45:10] we've got the consequences chasing us
[45:12] right
[45:13] they're gonna overtake us they're gonna
[45:15] hunt us down we're gonna be hunted down
[45:18] i don't think anybody here likes to be
[45:20] hunted down right amen
[45:22] amen but the bible says
[45:25] if we don't obey god diligently those
[45:27] curses are going to overtake us
[45:29] and hunt us down they're going to be
[45:32] like haunting us right we're always
[45:33] going to have that like we know that
[45:34] feeling when we do wrong
[45:35] right and we haven't made it right and
[45:37] we know oh it's going to happen
[45:39] when is it going to happen when am i
[45:40] going to get punished for it you know
[45:41] right
[45:42] children know that especially right
[45:43] children look at my
[45:46] yeah they know right we know as adults
[45:48] we know god
[45:49] doesn't play uh god's gonna correct his
[45:52] children praise god he's not gonna let
[45:54] them get by there's a quote i don't have
[45:55] it here
[45:55] i saw it last week but man said god
[45:58] don't let his children
[45:59] or brother said god's not going to let
[46:00] me get by with any sin
[46:03] i forget which message that was i heard
[46:05] brother say that he said god i think it
[46:06] was restoration of the bride
[46:08] bride tree 62 uh easter lebron said
[46:10] god's not going to let me get by with
[46:12] any sin
[46:15] and so so we cannot turn
[46:18] to the left to the right or to the left
[46:20] we must stay on the narrow road or else
[46:23] those
[46:23] consequences are going to hunt us down
[46:26] right haven consequences are going to
[46:28] hunt us down right now
[46:30] if we if we go outside the path of god
[46:34] the consequences are going to hunt us
[46:36] down
[46:38] we can try to run as much as we want but
[46:39] there's no running from god
[46:42] he uh we know this bible says the sins
[46:45] will find this out right
[46:48] so the scriptural
[46:52] now here's here's the quote i read it on
[46:54] sunday i believe i did this the first
[46:56] bride i think i remember that in the
[46:57] arena on sunday
[46:58] but i just wanted to give you a
[46:59] scripture for it it was uh the one we
[47:01] just read deuteronomy
[47:02] 28 14 15. now the first bride of the
[47:05] human race before husband came to her
[47:06] she fell from grace by listening to
[47:08] satan's life
[47:09] after god had her fortified behind his
[47:11] word
[47:12] if she'd have stayed behind the word she
[47:14] never fell
[47:15] now that's in the natural notice the
[47:16] natural woman and what's the curse the
[47:18] actual curse of coming out
[47:20] from behind god's word so anytime we
[47:23] stray from the path there's going to be
[47:25] a curse overtake us
[47:27] so what's the best suggestion should we
[47:29] keep running uh carrich should we keep
[47:31] running
[47:31] from the curse or should we repent and
[47:34] get back on the narrow road what do you
[47:35] think hon
[47:37] give it a round of applause
[47:38] [Laughter]
[47:41] yeah instead of running from our
[47:42] problems why don't we run to god amen
[47:46] and that's what we as adults that's what
[47:47] we've learned to do that's what children
[47:49] young in the faith
[47:50] that's what they've learned to do rather
[47:52] than running from the problems
[47:54] and having this haunting feeling like
[47:56] they're good stuff is going to get me
[47:57] something
[47:58] rather that let's confess our wrongs and
[48:01] come clean before god
[48:03] and david said he'll restore the joy of
[48:05] my salvation
[48:06] that's why i was telling amen that's why
[48:08] some people they can't smile at church
[48:10] right you know you see some people come
[48:12] in and out or sometimes they're here
[48:13] sometimes they're not you know
[48:14] they come and they never smile why
[48:16] aren't they smiling because their life
[48:18] is curved why aren't they happy because
[48:19] their life is cursed
[48:20] they know they're off the narrow the
[48:22] narrow road they know a punishment's
[48:25] coming down the road so how can they be
[48:26] happy and praise god
[48:28] they can't right
[48:33] if you know trouble's gonna get you are
[48:36] you gonna be happy
[48:36] praising god but if you know you there's
[48:40] nothing between you and the lord
[48:41] and you're expecting the blessing and
[48:42] the protection of god you can be happy
[48:44] in the lord
[48:46] i don't know about you i'd rather be
[48:48] happy coming to church
[48:50] i'd rather confess my sin and don't feel
[48:52] like something
[48:53] there's a dog after me or there's a
[48:55] bounty on my name or something like that
[48:57] i'd rather have the joy of god and the
[48:59] love of christ in my heart to know that
[49:01] there's something that's chasing me it's
[49:03] god's blessings amen
[49:05] like the bible said the blessings will
[49:07] overtake you if you diligently hearken
[49:09] to the voice of god
[49:10] praise god okay so as you see there's
[49:14] always a curse but
[49:15] it tells there's always a curse for
[49:16] stepping off the path of god
[49:21] now we know this is very familiar but it
[49:23] applies to us
[49:24] like it did to israel we saw on sunday
[49:27] when balaam tried to curse him
[49:28] you cannot curse what god is blessed as
[49:31] far as a permanent curse
[49:33] right and anyone who's outside of god's
[49:37] leadership
[49:37] cannot curse who god has blessed
[49:41] right because remember we know rachel
[49:43] right rachel was saved right we believe
[49:44] that with our hearts she produces joseph
[49:46] and
[49:46] benjamin but yet temporarily she was
[49:49] cursed
[49:50] because jacob pronounced it but it was
[49:52] by the leadership of the lord
[49:53] it wasn't jacob's idea it wasn't jacob
[49:56] trying to get back at his wife for you
[49:58] know
[49:58] laban's you know holding withholding it
[50:00] for seven years it wasn't that
[50:01] it was it was god correcting his
[50:04] daughter
[50:05] rachel i know that's hard to say but
[50:07] that's god
[50:08] chastening his daughter that he loves
[50:11] who stole
[50:12] the idols right but what did god
[50:14] pronounce in his word don't take idols
[50:16] right
[50:17] don't hide idols it's that secret sin
[50:19] church is that right it's a secret sin
[50:22] that god despises why hold it in
[50:25] we should take it out before the lord
[50:27] said god purge me and cleanse me
[50:29] make me clean help me to have the joy of
[50:31] the lord help me to stay in your
[50:32] presence
[50:33] help your blessing to remain upon my
[50:35] life
[50:37] but see god didn't curse adam and eve in
[50:38] the beginning right god didn't curse
[50:40] adam
[50:41] he might have done the same thing but he
[50:43] cursed the earth of thorns and thistles
[50:45] look
[50:45] look how gracious god is to adam
[50:48] now i believe the way the scripture says
[50:50] it i believe
[50:52] adam was a negligent and is watching
[50:55] over eve
[50:55] and he let eve walk away to the tree of
[50:58] life that's
[50:59] that's what i think happened and there
[51:01] are some quotes on that where
[51:03] adam wasn't there but then when adam
[51:05] gets back after the fruit's already been
[51:07] eaten he sees her in the condition
[51:09] because the bible puts the blame on adam
[51:12] right in
[51:12] romans the bible puts the blame on adam
[51:14] so i think adam wasn't uh
[51:16] a diligent like he should have been his
[51:18] wife wandered off she got the begow
[51:20] deceived and defiled
[51:22] uh got the wrong seed well he comes back
[51:24] and he sees the condition
[51:26] and then he has to he knows well she's
[51:28] gonna die she's part of me
[51:30] i'll i'll partake in that so i can be
[51:32] with her because he loves her that's the
[51:33] type of christ
[51:35] right taking upon our sin upon him to
[51:37] redeem us
[51:39] okay but notice adam wasn't cursed
[51:43] the ground was cursed amen you and i are
[51:46] not cursed praise god
[51:47] this ground may get cursed amen but not
[51:50] the real you the soul
[51:51] praise god because the real use the soul
[51:56] he didn't curse eve but he said adam
[51:58] would be her ruler
[52:00] look at that she committed such a we
[52:02] would think such an awful act right
[52:04] yet god didn't curse her
[52:08] from now on she ain't trying any
[52:10] preaching or anything
[52:12] adam is a ruler and all the days of your
[52:14] life and sorrow you'll bring
[52:16] your life into the earth and he said but
[52:18] i'll put entity between your seat now
[52:20] she didn't have any seeds she never did
[52:21] have so she had to receive a seed from
[52:23] some way god gave her seed
[52:25] not by uh relation but by creation
[52:28] can't you blind people see that's the
[52:30] sea the serpent oh my satan got there
[52:32] before adam
[52:33] that was the seed but she received a
[52:35] seed what was it
[52:36] god himself he was the beginning of the
[52:38] creation of god
[52:40] amen beautiful scriptures sir quoting
[52:43] them
[52:43] now this was a this was also a curse
[52:49] uh from deuteronomy 8 or 28 18
[52:53] not being able to have children cursing
[52:55] shall be the fruit of thy body and the
[52:57] fruit of thy land
[52:58] the increase of i kind and the flocks of
[53:01] thy sheep
[53:02] now the church we got to remember not
[53:04] every woman who struggled with bringing
[53:05] forth children was cursed like sarah
[53:07] because it wasn't for that it wasn't for
[53:09] a curse it was for a testimony
[53:12] now there are some women like mike mccow
[53:14] i don't know how to say i know it's not
[53:15] michael because that's michael the
[53:17] archangel i don't actually know the
[53:18] pronunciation for that one
[53:19] mitchell machow mike child i'm not sure
[53:23] but anyways david's wife from saul from
[53:26] saul's uh
[53:26] daughters she was cursed and couldn't
[53:30] have children but that doesn't mean it's
[53:31] every child
[53:33] right remember that remember that story
[53:35] um i believe it was elijah
[53:37] or it's not elijah elijah elijah had
[53:40] he had this he had this route he kept
[53:42] walking well there's a woman there that
[53:43] had a husband she's like hubby
[53:45] can we build on a house for this this
[53:47] prophet of god
[53:48] he's like sure i'll build it you know he
[53:50] built it and then elijah had a little
[53:52] stop a little hotel
[53:54] between his is his preaching locations
[53:57] yeah a little place to stop
[53:59] and one day he got so happy elijah he's
[54:01] like lord i'm going to bless that woman
[54:04] what can i bless her with and the
[54:06] servant gaheza says well
[54:08] she don't have any children right and
[54:10] what does he do he says this time next
[54:12] year
[54:12] you're going to embrace a son thus saith
[54:15] the lord
[54:16] and she did right because it was thus
[54:19] saith the lord
[54:20] now we're not told anything in the
[54:22] scripture that she was cursed
[54:25] now what did she act like did she act
[54:27] like she was cursed or did she act like
[54:28] she was blessed
[54:30] i know about you but anybody that would
[54:32] want to bless a holy ghost preacher
[54:34] you're blessed right a cursed person
[54:36] wouldn't want to do that right
[54:39] so it seems no i'm not saying it's
[54:41] absolute but
[54:42] it seems this woman wasn't cursed it
[54:44] just seemed it was for the glory of god
[54:47] now after the child died remember what
[54:49] the woman said she ran up to elijah
[54:51] go through gahey's and said did i ask
[54:53] for this child
[54:55] so it doesn't even look like she was
[54:56] cursed she's like i didn't even ask for
[54:59] this child
[55:00] so maybe it wasn't the plan of god you
[55:02] know or maybe it wasn't the curse of god
[55:05] but she said this was i didn't even ask
[55:06] for this child elijah
[55:08] and so remember what he did he went in
[55:09] there he laid on him and breathed on him
[55:11] knocked him out face to face talking
[55:13] about mouth-to-mouth
[55:15] resuscitation there and he sneezed seven
[55:17] times and the boy came back to life and
[55:19] he presented his son here's your
[55:21] here's your void mom right what a
[55:24] powerful testimony that is
[55:27] but see there's an example where we
[55:29] don't get anything from the scripture
[55:31] where she's cursed
[55:32] so the reason i'm saying that is let's
[55:35] not jump to conclusions
[55:37] with curses and blessings now i shared
[55:40] some a few weeks ago and i need to
[55:41] clarify that
[55:42] like different people i've known that
[55:43] have fallen away from the message
[55:45] i didn't know for sure it was curse it
[55:47] just looks like a curse
[55:49] so the reason i share that is to give a
[55:50] warning because the bible says
[55:52] i'm to warn all men
[55:55] and a lot of those same uh the same
[55:57] things you see in these lives of these
[55:59] preachers that fall
[55:59] it's the same thing we read in
[56:00] deuteronomy 28 with curses
[56:03] and that's the same thing got trouble
[56:06] you know all this uh
[56:07] all kinds of trouble physical trouble
[56:09] spiritual trouble
[56:11] and it's just it's all kinds of trouble
[56:13] all because they start compromising
[56:15] on the word of god
[56:18] and they almost they basically blaspheme
[56:19] brother branham are they they say such
[56:21] evil words that would never come out of
[56:23] a a real saints mouth
[56:25] right they marry people two or three
[56:27] times they enjoy rock and roll they
[56:29] listen to rock and roll you know now and
[56:30] they used to be in the message
[56:32] i mean some of these things just they
[56:34] don't add up so what i'm saying is that
[56:36] uh we got to be careful not to jump to
[56:39] conclusions
[56:41] but with mchow or my child
[56:45] we know god did curse her okay
[56:48] brother man says it like this in part
[56:50] and he said saul's daughter seemed to be
[56:51] very much embarrassed at that man's
[56:53] action
[56:54] her husband her young handsome husband
[56:56] had cut up
[56:59] and misbehaved himself in her presence
[57:02] see to her it was misbehavior
[57:04] but to david he's like i was before god
[57:07] i wasn't dancing for you darling
[57:09] i was dancing for god
[57:12] hallelujah praise god he said
[57:17] uh the king's daughter david said if you
[57:19] don't like that watch this a little
[57:21] while
[57:23] i love that and around and around the
[57:26] arky went again dancing the spear
[57:28] and she was embarrassed and god cursed
[57:30] that woman
[57:31] with the curse because she was
[57:34] embarrassed about
[57:35] her hubby dancing around the church
[57:39] oh the victory through the blood of
[57:41] jesus christ the token
[57:43] of the resurrection of christ his life
[57:46] lives within his church
[57:47] there's no other way of fellowship under
[57:49] but under that blood
[57:50] our denominations will separate us one
[57:52] will say that's nonsense one will say
[57:54] this
[57:54] one will say the other aren't you glad
[57:56] that we can be happy in the lord and we
[57:58] can rejoice in the holy spirit praise
[58:00] god
[58:01] don't be ever be embarrassed if
[58:02] somebody's trying to worship god from
[58:04] the depths of their soul
[58:06] amen i always pray that constantly god
[58:09] help our church to be more free in the
[58:10] spirit
[58:11] i think every pastor would pray that
[58:12] don't you any real pastor with a heart
[58:15] for the people
[58:16] i we don't we don't want to be bound up
[58:17] we want to be free
[58:20] we know everybody expresses it different
[58:21] though you know we understand that
[58:23] but we don't want we don't ever want to
[58:25] be embarrassed if somebody does get a
[58:27] little free
[58:29] or a lot free right we're not going to
[58:31] be embarrassed by that
[58:32] we want to be encouraged by that praise
[58:34] god
[58:36] because the bible says god will curse
[58:37] people if they're embarrassed by holy
[58:40] ghost worship
[58:42] oh my god help us god help the message
[58:46] churches
[58:47] right including us god help all of us is
[58:50] what i'm saying
[58:51] because we don't want to get so stiff
[58:52] and starchy where we couldn't want to
[58:54] rejoice in the holy spirit praise god
[58:58] glory
[59:01] now uh believers have power to curse and
[59:05] bless
[59:06] right so deuteronomy 28 18.
[59:10] you know what i think i forgot to i that
[59:12] that shouldn't be there so i'm sorry i
[59:14] forgot to
[59:14] i copied i duplicated the slide i forgot
[59:17] to delete that scripture
[59:18] because that scripture says cursed me
[59:20] the fruit of thy body the fruit thy land
[59:22] the increase of thy kind and the flocks
[59:24] thy sheep yes i just i forgot to leave
[59:26] that forgive me
[59:28] so here's where jesus says verily i say
[59:30] unto you whatsoever ye shall bind on
[59:32] earth now bind means to tie up
[59:34] so jesus said you can tie things up in
[59:36] prayer and by speaking the word
[59:39] or throw into chains you can chain
[59:42] things up
[59:43] isn't that something your prayers can
[59:46] chain
[59:46] up the enemy right
[59:50] the enemy wants to hop and jump on your
[59:52] family right he wants to hop and jump on
[59:54] you
[59:55] then he wants to spread and create
[59:57] division of church you and i
[59:59] church we have power to bind the enemy
[1:00:03] to tie him up right
[1:00:07] whatever you bind whatever you cast into
[1:00:09] chains
[1:00:11] on earth will be bound in heaven
[1:00:13] whatsoever he shall loose
[1:00:15] and that means to loosen dissolve or
[1:00:17] unbind
[1:00:19] shall be loose in heaven praise god
[1:00:24] so whatever you tie up whatever you
[1:00:25] limit whatever you hinder
[1:00:27] will be stopped but whatever you lose
[1:00:29] will be let go
[1:00:30] and let free now these preachers on tv
[1:00:35] they always release anointing they
[1:00:36] release a blessing right they release
[1:00:38] this they
[1:00:39] release that they release so many things
[1:00:41] on them i'm not even sure if they can
[1:00:42] remember how many things they released
[1:00:45] uh but i guess in one way church i do
[1:00:48] that
[1:00:48] in one way i always pray a blessing over
[1:00:50] you right at the end of the service
[1:00:53] i pray bless the saints of god
[1:00:55] strengthen them
[1:00:56] answer their prayers help them what am i
[1:00:58] trying to do i'm trying to loose the
[1:01:00] blessings of god on you praise god
[1:01:03] if you'll obey and if i'll obey
[1:01:06] but see church we got the power to bind
[1:01:10] and stop things from moving
[1:01:13] now for us it might be like with
[1:01:14] sickness right we want to stop a
[1:01:16] sickness before it gets to our family i
[1:01:17] know my wife and i would probably say
[1:01:18] amen on that one
[1:01:20] right because then it goes from one
[1:01:21] child to the next and then yeah yeah
[1:01:23] everybody's sick uh but that that would
[1:01:26] be one example where you want to bind
[1:01:28] you want to stop something
[1:01:30] and uh make sure it doesn't impact other
[1:01:33] people
[1:01:36] you know i've i've preached this before
[1:01:37] i've you know when i've gone other
[1:01:38] places
[1:01:40] jesus said uh jesus told that evil
[1:01:42] spirit to to leave go to dry places and
[1:01:45] never return
[1:01:46] so i've encouraged people to do that
[1:01:48] especially people that are addicted
[1:01:49] like cigarettes or alcohol or something
[1:01:52] like that i've encouraged them
[1:01:53] when you rebuke that spirit bind it
[1:01:57] tie it up and send it away so it can't
[1:02:00] come back praise god
[1:02:01] amen and that's the kind of faith we've
[1:02:03] got to have right
[1:02:04] in other words i'll never go back to
[1:02:06] that i'll never do that again
[1:02:08] i bind that spirit in jesus christ's
[1:02:11] name
[1:02:12] that's real faith right that's what he's
[1:02:15] talking about here
[1:02:16] binding it
[1:02:20] or with healing i loose this person from
[1:02:22] their infirmity in jesus christ's name
[1:02:25] in other words i cast out that spirit in
[1:02:27] jesus christ's name
[1:02:30] and again i say to you that if two of
[1:02:31] you that's why i read this earlier i
[1:02:33] quoted earlier if two of you shall agree
[1:02:36] on earth
[1:02:36] as touching anything that they shall ask
[1:02:39] it shall be done for them of my father
[1:02:41] which is in heaven now of course
[1:02:42] remember this has to be according to
[1:02:44] god's will
[1:02:45] right everything we always got to
[1:02:46] remember that it always has to be
[1:02:48] according to god's will
[1:02:50] okay and let me read a quote from uh
[1:02:53] works as faith expressed
[1:02:57] he said if you can't believe it it just
[1:02:59] won't happen now i can't make you
[1:03:01] believe neither can you make yourself
[1:03:03] believe
[1:03:03] so church give yourself license not to
[1:03:06] give yourself a hard time
[1:03:07] okay well i just don't have enough faith
[1:03:10] well
[1:03:11] brown said you can't make yourself
[1:03:13] believe
[1:03:14] he said god has to give it to you it's a
[1:03:17] gift of god to believe
[1:03:21] now if you're turning down god's gift
[1:03:22] that's a different story
[1:03:24] right now he said not your faith
[1:03:28] it's god's faith your intellectual faith
[1:03:32] might believe it fine
[1:03:33] but unless the faith of god is down in
[1:03:36] your heart see
[1:03:37] and just keep believing it with all your
[1:03:39] heart
[1:03:40] until god does reveal it to you keep
[1:03:43] believing
[1:03:44] it until god does reveal it
[1:03:47] amen so see don't get down on yourself
[1:03:50] if you don't have the faith yet now if
[1:03:51] you've got sin in your life
[1:03:52] and that's the reason you don't have
[1:03:53] faith yeah get rid of the sin
[1:03:56] but if your life is clean your life is
[1:03:58] pure you don't see any curses on your
[1:04:00] life
[1:04:01] and you confess everything's under the
[1:04:02] blood and you don't have you feel you
[1:04:04] feel like the gift of faith to believe
[1:04:06] it yet
[1:04:07] he said keep believing it with all your
[1:04:09] heart until god gives you that gift
[1:04:12] amen praise god
[1:04:19] the wrath says no matter how religious
[1:04:20] you are or how good or bad you are
[1:04:23] unless the grace of god drops into your
[1:04:25] heart you'll never get well
[1:04:29] so i i told that to brother matt
[1:04:31] lightner last time he was here i said
[1:04:33] he said i'm stuck on divine healing
[1:04:34] you've got any suggestions i said yes
[1:04:36] listen to work is faith expressed
[1:04:38] that is brother rams pinnacle message on
[1:04:40] divine healing you just learn more and
[1:04:42] more and more
[1:04:43] and that's the pinnacle revelation on
[1:04:44] divine healing you can't force yourself
[1:04:47] to believe
[1:04:47] don't get down on yourself if the
[1:04:49] revelation hasn't dropped yet it's got
[1:04:51] to be a gift from god
[1:04:53] it has to be a gift from god right and
[1:04:56] it's if you've got to get the divine
[1:04:58] healing then even then you still got to
[1:05:00] wait for god to tell you to believe to
[1:05:02] or to god to drop it down your heart to
[1:05:04] to believe it
[1:05:05] and know that it's going to happen you
[1:05:07] have to wait on god
[1:05:08] it's a constant waiting on god
[1:05:12] it's waiting for god's inspiration
[1:05:16] now look at this peter called to
[1:05:17] remembrance and said behold master
[1:05:19] behold
[1:05:19] the fig tree which thou cursest is
[1:05:22] withered away
[1:05:24] and jesus answering saith on him have
[1:05:26] faith in god wow
[1:05:28] so it takes faith to curse something
[1:05:31] now faith what is faith faith is a
[1:05:32] revelation of the will of god
[1:05:34] so you have to have a gift right a gift
[1:05:37] or a revelation from god to know god's
[1:05:39] will before you curse something
[1:05:42] right and i'm still
[1:05:46] looking at the curses i remember a few
[1:05:47] week months ago i cursed the spirits
[1:05:49] that were battling my dad and mom i'm
[1:05:50] still waiting on that
[1:05:52] i'm still waiting on that because i
[1:05:54] didn't feel i didn't plan to do that
[1:05:55] church
[1:05:56] either i was off in the flesh or just
[1:05:58] emotional or that was god so i'm still
[1:06:00] waiting
[1:06:00] but program teaches us if you can't wait
[1:06:03] a week
[1:06:04] then you really don't have faith if you
[1:06:06] can't wait a month you don't have faith
[1:06:08] if you can't wait a year you really
[1:06:09] don't have faith because abraham waited
[1:06:11] 25 years
[1:06:13] so see i'm just waiting on that i didn't
[1:06:15] plan to say it
[1:06:17] i had no idea i was going to say that
[1:06:20] and so i'm just waiting to see if god is
[1:06:21] going to bring the victory in this
[1:06:23] season
[1:06:24] right because we had to wait what we had
[1:06:25] to wait april may wait wait two months
[1:06:27] for van's dad to get well
[1:06:29] but the very the very morning the very
[1:06:31] morning after he
[1:06:32] died and they brought him back i said
[1:06:34] he's going to be well
[1:06:35] and he's going to come out of the
[1:06:36] hospital in the name of jesus christ
[1:06:37] well it took two months to manifest
[1:06:39] they took vang raising in faith right
[1:06:42] and going and getting the prayer cloth
[1:06:43] it took jose bringing that prayer call
[1:06:44] from brother branham it took all these
[1:06:46] things had to work together
[1:06:48] in order to receive god's blessing and
[1:06:51] who is glorified in all that
[1:06:52] jesus christ jesus christ he does all
[1:06:55] this
[1:06:56] for his glory
[1:06:59] he said so look he connects cursing
[1:07:02] and faith they're so close together
[1:07:04] faith to curse
[1:07:06] in other words faith to bind right
[1:07:09] faith to mind or faith to lose
[1:07:12] that's connected together for verily i
[1:07:15] said to you whatsoever you shall say
[1:07:16] this mountain be thou removed okay so
[1:07:18] now
[1:07:18] we're starting to see what curses are
[1:07:20] it's speaking to it
[1:07:22] right or blessing something speaking to
[1:07:24] it or cursing it
[1:07:26] so when when we speak to the mountain to
[1:07:28] move we're cursing that mountain
[1:07:30] right we're removing that mountain
[1:07:33] and be thou cast in the sea and shall
[1:07:36] not doubt in his heart and shall believe
[1:07:37] that those things which he says shall
[1:07:39] come to pass
[1:07:39] he shall have whatsoever he said but
[1:07:42] don't forget the other quote my man said
[1:07:43] you can believe all day
[1:07:44] but until it drops down as god's will it
[1:07:47] ain't gonna happen
[1:07:52] let's finish the scripture
[1:07:55] yeah now look how he connects it look
[1:07:57] how forgiveness
[1:07:59] right look how forgiveness is connected
[1:08:01] to faith and curses and blessings
[1:08:04] therefore i say to you whatsoever things
[1:08:06] you desire when you pray
[1:08:07] believe that you receive them and you
[1:08:09] shall have them so you gotta have faith
[1:08:11] you gotta have a revelation it's god's
[1:08:13] will to do it and when you stand praying
[1:08:15] forgive if you have ought against any
[1:08:17] that your father also which is in heaven
[1:08:19] may forgive you
[1:08:20] your trespasses but if you do not
[1:08:23] forgive neither will your father which
[1:08:25] is in heaven
[1:08:26] forgive your trespasses so see brother
[1:08:28] tell us how can you have faith
[1:08:30] when you've got sin in your heart
[1:08:31] against somebody
[1:08:33] first john talks about that right if my
[1:08:35] heart condemns me
[1:08:36] i'm not going to get what i asked for
[1:08:38] but if my heart condemned me not
[1:08:40] then god hears me so jesus connects it
[1:08:43] together when you're blessing
[1:08:45] when you're cursing when you're binding
[1:08:46] when you're losing we got to have the
[1:08:49] right heart attitude about it
[1:08:51] and our lives must be in diligent
[1:08:54] obedience to the word of god
[1:08:58] all right now i love this scripture here
[1:09:03] and when he called on him his twelve
[1:09:04] disciples he gave them power
[1:09:06] against unclean spirits to cast them out
[1:09:09] and to heal
[1:09:10] how many diseases oh
[1:09:13] so church we should pray about every
[1:09:15] disease
[1:09:17] every sickness we can pray about it and
[1:09:20] all how many diseases all manner of
[1:09:22] diseases
[1:09:24] all sickness all diseases he gave his
[1:09:26] disciples
[1:09:27] power over that and we have the same
[1:09:30] today by god's grace
[1:09:32] right like other man said just believe
[1:09:34] it speak it until the grace drops down
[1:09:37] praise the lord
[1:09:41] little children let no man deceive you
[1:09:42] he that does does righteous is righteous
[1:09:45] even as he is righteous he that
[1:09:46] committed sinners of the devil
[1:09:48] for the devil sinner from the beginning
[1:09:50] for this purpose was the son of god
[1:09:52] manifested that he might destroy the
[1:09:54] works of the devil
[1:09:55] okay so christ was meant christ became
[1:09:58] unveiled
[1:09:59] to destroy satan's works and not just
[1:10:02] the sin
[1:10:03] debt right but also the sickness right
[1:10:05] the mental trouble
[1:10:07] the insanity right all these curses the
[1:10:09] addictions
[1:10:10] jesus was manifested to destroy all
[1:10:13] those things
[1:10:14] and he does it by speaking the word amen
[1:10:17] by binding by loosing he uh pronounces a
[1:10:20] blessing instead of a curse
[1:10:22] and he curses what is cursed wow look at
[1:10:25] that
[1:10:26] jesus curses what is cursed those demons
[1:10:29] are cursed right so he curses them
[1:10:31] and he commands them to leave he curses
[1:10:34] the curse
[1:10:36] whosoever is born of god does not commit
[1:10:38] sin
[1:10:40] for his seed remains in him he cannot
[1:10:42] sin because he's
[1:10:44] born of god amen what encouragement
[1:10:47] jesus purpose was to destroy satan's
[1:10:50] works
[1:10:51] right and our soul is remaining
[1:10:55] anointed by god and we can have
[1:10:56] confidence if we confess all of our sins
[1:10:59] then the word of god will flow out of
[1:11:00] our soul right and he'll speak god's
[1:11:02] word and accomplish god's purpose in our
[1:11:04] lives
[1:11:06] amen now i read this a few
[1:11:12] no i'm sorry i didn't read this one so
[1:11:14] brother is preaching the token he's in
[1:11:16] the prayer line
[1:11:17] lord jesus i'm walking off this platform
[1:11:19] down here to identify myself with these

[1:17:48] down here
[1:17:49] you have assurance that uh you have
[1:17:51] everything you need of in this journey
[1:17:53] is providing that token of his

[1:19:16] okay now i'm going to skip past some of
[1:19:17] these here because of time
[1:19:20] i told myself oh yeah 35 minutes i'll be
[1:19:22] done yeah
[1:19:23] definitely and now i'm at 45.
[1:19:31] so i can say
[1:19:35] let me uh skip ahead i just kind of want
[1:19:37] to get to this
[1:19:41] yeah i this was really special scripture
[1:19:43] look how close i think
[1:19:44] i've preached something on this line
[1:19:45] before look how close paul put the
[1:19:48] blessings
[1:19:48] and the curses now this is to the
[1:19:51] corinthians remember they were they a
[1:19:52] book of acts church
[1:19:53] yeah did they have a lot of trouble yes
[1:19:56] they had a lot of trouble
[1:19:57] did they have a lot of blessings yeah
[1:19:58] they had a lot of gifts of the holy
[1:19:59] spirit too
[1:20:01] but look all the brother and greet you
[1:20:03] greet you another with a holy kiss
[1:20:05] the salutation of me paul with my own
[1:20:07] head if any man
[1:20:09] love not the lord jesus christ let him
[1:20:11] be an
[1:20:12] anathema which is a curse
[1:20:16] any man
[1:20:19] oh we don't believe in curses in the new
[1:20:20] testament though jess you don't
[1:20:23] paul cursed anybody who didn't love
[1:20:26] christ
[1:20:27] in other words anybody that doesn't love
[1:20:28] the truth he cursed him
[1:20:30] well that's because that's what god said
[1:20:32] in the old testament right god had
[1:20:33] already said it
[1:20:34] so he's just repeating what god already
[1:20:36] said
[1:20:38] that continues in the new testament if
[1:20:40] any man
[1:20:41] love not our lord jesus christ let him
[1:20:43] be cursed
[1:20:46] cursive maranatha our lord cometh so see
[1:20:49] they're cursed because our lord is
[1:20:50] coming
[1:20:53] and looking and blessed the grace of our
[1:20:56] lord jesus christ be with you
[1:21:00] my love be with you all in christ jesus
[1:21:04] amen this is uh
[1:21:07] you know he's ending the letter so he
[1:21:09] ends it curse anybody that doesn't
[1:21:11] believe in christ
[1:21:12] and bless all the rest you with peace
[1:21:16] see god god god's not a dirty grandpa
[1:21:19] right
[1:21:22] everybody should believe in jesus christ
[1:21:24] is that right
[1:21:25] the bible said god searches all the
[1:21:26] earth his eyes run to and fro around the
[1:21:28] earth
[1:21:29] looking for those who believe in him
[1:21:32] looking for those that will put their
[1:21:33] confidence in
[1:21:34] so paul clearly he just simply says
[1:21:36] cursed me anybody that doesn't love this
[1:21:38] truth
[1:21:39] but god's peace upon those that do
[1:21:41] aren't you glad you can have peace
[1:21:42] tonight
[1:21:43] i'm glad i got paul's blessing tonight
[1:21:45] and not paul's curse
[1:21:48] because i love the lord jesus christ
[1:21:52] let's all say that let's all say i love
[1:21:53] the lord jesus christ ready i love the
[1:21:55] lord jesus christ
[1:21:57] his blessing is peace is upon us
[1:22:01] if we don't love him his curse is upon
[1:22:03] us
[1:22:05] and the best part is he's coming again
[1:22:06] by god's grace
[1:22:08] and all these wrongs are going to be
[1:22:10] made right
[1:22:12] now i'm going to close with this
[1:22:16] so i've read this gentleman's book now
[1:22:18] he passed away back in i think 2004
[1:22:21] 2005. he's a pentecostal preacher uh but
[1:22:24] i read his book it was a beautiful book
[1:22:26] his praying
[1:22:27] uh changing nations through praying and
[1:22:29] fasting
[1:22:30] and he had some powerful testimonies
[1:22:33] where he prayed for nations and god
[1:22:36] he would pray he would pray curses off
[1:22:38] of nations and there were some african
[1:22:40] nations he named in there
[1:22:41] and he listed the dates they prayed and
[1:22:43] the dates the government changed
[1:22:45] uh he also prayed for the united kingdom
[1:22:47] as well in great britain and
[1:22:48] just great victories that came about
[1:22:50] through his prayer and fasting
[1:22:52] now here's another one he said there was
[1:22:54] a curse he found a curse on u.s presence
[1:22:56] that's why
[1:22:57] so many were assassinated and he said he
[1:23:00] went to ronald reagan and he said they
[1:23:01] prayed for ronald reagan
[1:23:03] that the curses would leave the curse of
[1:23:05] assassination
[1:23:06] would leave the presidents and he got
[1:23:09] shot i think a week later
[1:23:11] but he didn't die and he said since then
[1:23:14] and then he lived what that was
[1:23:15] other than 20 20 years later he lived 25
[1:23:18] years later and no
[1:23:19] presents had been assassinated since so
[1:23:22] i thought wow that was pretty powerful
[1:23:27] now this this this man i've listened to
[1:23:30] many times
[1:23:31] i sense a really good spirit he's got a
[1:23:33] good spirit course he didn't believe the
[1:23:34] message
[1:23:35] but he has a really good spirit and so
[1:23:38] he said
[1:23:39] he said thousands of people would be set
[1:23:41] free when he would preach on blessings
[1:23:43] and cursings
[1:23:44] and so i want to show you this is his
[1:23:45] prayer that he
[1:23:47] got uh he got inspired by the holy
[1:23:49] spirit to have the people speak out loud
[1:23:52] at the end of these services where he
[1:23:54] deal with them and he said
[1:23:56] thousands of people were set free from
[1:23:57] curses now we're going to read through
[1:23:59] it but just look how simple it is in
[1:24:02] other words all you have to do is
[1:24:03] confess
[1:24:03] any any sin that you have confess any
[1:24:06] sin that you have right
[1:24:08] anybody you have anything against get
[1:24:10] any evil thing out of your house
[1:24:13] right which to us would be what common
[1:24:16] sense
[1:24:17] but because these denominational people
[1:24:19] had didn't have the message teaching
[1:24:21] it was like new to them it was like
[1:24:23] fresh revelation oh wow i shouldn't play
[1:24:25] the ouija board
[1:24:26] oh you mean i got to forgive my wife i
[1:24:28] got to forgive my husband
[1:24:29] i mean i can't speak badly against my
[1:24:30] mom or dad
[1:24:32] no you can't you can't do that and be
[1:24:34] blessed
[1:24:36] and so look at this prayer that
[1:24:38] apparently thousands of people
[1:24:40] oh i must have did it on two days ago
[1:24:42] okay i wrote just go
[1:24:44] here's the prayer look at this prayer
[1:24:45] church lord jesus i believe you're the
[1:24:47] son of god the only way to god
[1:24:48] that you die on the cross for my sins
[1:24:50] and rose again from the dead kind of
[1:24:51] sounds like the sinner's prayer
[1:24:53] and church when i listen to it i hear
[1:24:55] people shouting rejoicing in his
[1:24:57] meetings
[1:24:58] i think a lot of those people are just
[1:24:59] getting saved for the first time
[1:25:02] because i don't think a lot of they went
[1:25:03] to church but i don't even think many of
[1:25:04] them are saved
[1:25:06] but he leads them in this prayer to get
[1:25:08] saved
[1:25:09] and get the curses off them
[1:25:15] he said i renounce all my sins and i
[1:25:17] turn to you
[1:25:18] lord jesus for mercy and for forgiveness
[1:25:20] i believe you do forgive me from now on
[1:25:23] i want to live for you i want to hear
[1:25:24] your voice and do what you tell me isn't
[1:25:26] this diligently obeying
[1:25:28] all the word of god
[1:25:31] in order to receive your blessing lord
[1:25:33] and to be released from any curse over
[1:25:35] my life
[1:25:35] first i confess all known sin committed
[1:25:38] by me
[1:25:39] or by any of my ancestors i don't know
[1:25:42] if you have to go that far i honestly
[1:25:43] don't know if you have to go that far
[1:25:45] or others related to me confess those
[1:25:47] specific sins but one thing that just
[1:25:49] came to mind
[1:25:49] was daniel remember when daniel before
[1:25:51] he met the angel he confessed all the
[1:25:53] sins of israel
[1:25:54] he said our fathers and our leaders and
[1:25:57] everybody
[1:25:58] now that might be different because it's
[1:25:59] the old testament i don't know
[1:26:03] and then he said then he gives them a
[1:26:05] pause he says now confess those in a
[1:26:07] whisper to the holy spirit
[1:26:09] confess all your sins lord i thank you
[1:26:12] and i believe
[1:26:13] you have forgiven everything i've
[1:26:15] confessed and lord
[1:26:16] now i want to say i also forgive all
[1:26:18] others who have harmed me or wronged me
[1:26:21] now look so if you haven't forgive
[1:26:23] somebody you have a spirit of bitterness
[1:26:25] you have a demon in your mind right
[1:26:29] the bible said neither give place to the
[1:26:30] devil if you can't forgive anybody
[1:26:32] you've got a demon
[1:26:33] influencing you you've got a curse on
[1:26:35] your life
[1:26:37] but what is he saying he's showing you
[1:26:39] you have to forgive everybody then god
[1:26:41] forgives you
[1:26:41] just like we read tonight what jesus
[1:26:43] said and these should be common sense to
[1:26:46] christians right
[1:26:48] remember when nathaniel was here what do
[1:26:50] you say a little leaven
[1:26:52] leavens the hole up right
[1:26:55] and when all the leavens out what do you
[1:26:57] get the fullness of the godhead bowling
[1:26:59] is that right that things we hear
[1:27:03] we hear the message right year after
[1:27:05] year after year but these people may not
[1:27:07] have heard it
[1:27:09] but we should know better in the message
[1:27:10] right we do
[1:27:14] that should be common sense for a lot of
[1:27:15] these people we're just church members
[1:27:17] they're proud to study their bible
[1:27:20] but i'll tell you these will work too
[1:27:22] for you tonight amen
[1:27:23] i believe they have all my heart they'll
[1:27:25] work for the listeners i look they'll
[1:27:26] work for anybody
[1:27:27] if you really pray a prayer like this
[1:27:29] and you mean it and get down to business
[1:27:31] with god god
[1:27:32] will hear you i forgive them
[1:27:36] all now as i would have god forgive me
[1:27:40] in particular i forgive and he says name
[1:27:43] those specific people my dad
[1:27:44] my mom my brother my uncle my grandpa
[1:27:48] specifically name the people you need to
[1:27:50] forgive say it out loud
[1:27:52] furthermore lord i renounce any contact
[1:27:55] by myself or
[1:27:56] any related to me with satan right or
[1:27:58] the occult power in any form or any kind
[1:28:00] of secret society
[1:28:02] also lord i commit myself to remove from
[1:28:04] my house any kind of occult
[1:28:05] objects that honor satan and dishonor
[1:28:08] jesus christ
[1:28:12] with your help lord i will remove them
[1:28:13] all and now lord jesus i thank you
[1:28:15] further that on the cross
[1:28:17] you were made a curse that i might be
[1:28:19] redeemed from a curse and receive the
[1:28:21] blessing
[1:28:22] and because of what you did for me on
[1:28:24] the cross i now release myself
[1:28:26] i don't know if you can do that but i
[1:28:27] think what it means is like i now bind
[1:28:29] or i now loose myself
[1:28:33] from every curse and every evil
[1:28:36] influence and every dark shadow
[1:28:38] over me or my family from any source
[1:28:40] whatever
[1:28:41] i release myself now in the name of
[1:28:44] jesus christ
[1:28:45] amen let's end our feet saints
[1:28:53] in church i've listened to numerous of
[1:28:54] his sermons and when he says that
[1:28:56] the people just they just shout and
[1:28:58] rejoice it's like a happy shout and clap
[1:29:01] he said he would he would see people
[1:29:02] pray that he said their faces would
[1:29:04] literally
[1:29:05] transform right before his eyes to
[1:29:06] happiness and joy
[1:29:08] the blessing would start so fast when
[1:29:10] people just
[1:29:12] forgive when they just can forgive
[1:29:15] those who sinned against them but church
[1:29:17] isn't that the daily prayer right didn't
[1:29:19] jesus say
[1:29:20] help me to forgive others as you forgive
[1:29:22] me isn't that the daily prayer
[1:29:24] the lord's prayer see so these people
[1:29:27] that
[1:29:28] you know god thank god they're getting
[1:29:29] victory but for some reason they must
[1:29:31] have not known the lord's prayer
[1:29:33] we and if they did they they didn't know
[1:29:35] it they were
[1:29:36] living in iniquity right but every day
[1:29:38] we should pray that father forgive them
[1:29:40] for they don't know what they're doing
[1:29:41] and forgive me if i have any debts
[1:29:43] against anybody forgive me lord
