TRANSCRIPT
========================================
chapter 13 elijah shall restore all things chapter 13 contains footnotes numbers 1898-1972 and jesus answered and said unto them elias truly shall first come and restore all things matthew 17 verse 11 the subject of elijah and his shared anointing elisha and john the baptist had the spirit of elijah has both baffled and astounded believers for centuries but daniel 12 4 and revelation 10 verse 7 assure us the mystery of god will be finished in the end time god is obligated to reveal this mystery in our day because the worldwide rapture conditions are evident see chapter 12 as the final star angel to the laodicean age the mystery of elijah's anointing is actually part of the seventh mystery the seven stars because the final star angel to the laodicean age was to be an elijah anointed prophet elijah shall restore all things before the gentile rapture six passages of scripture acts 3 verses 20 and 21 matthew 17 verses 11 and 12 malachi 4 verses 5 and 6 revelation 10 verses 7 through 11 amos 3 verse 7 and luke 17 verse 30 declare an authoritative biblical truth about elijah's spirit in the end time jesus will remain in heaven and not physically return to the earth until all things including bible doctrines and the hearts of believers are restored to their original apostolic conditions by the preaching of a prophet anointed with the spirit of elijah acts 3 verses 20 and 21 beginning here peter teaches jesus will remain in heaven until the times of restitution of all things in the greek restitution means restoration all things pertaining to christianity need restored or put back into their original condition look at modern churches and ask yourself do churches today resemble the churches in the book of acts of course not as they are lacking power holiness diligence truth sincerity and more joel 2 verse 25 agrees with god's promise to restore the true church back to its original glory i will restore matthew 17 verses 11 and 12 restoration is also jesus's theme in matthew 17 verse 11 elias elijah truly shall first come and restore all things three points need emphasized first all things must be restored which agrees with joel and peter's restoration prophecies second jesus says elijah alone not elijah with moses is going to come and restore everything before jesus's millennial reign occurs third jesus affirms in matthew 17 verse 12 that john the baptist had elijah's spirit upon him but i say unto you that elias has come already and they knew him not but have done unto him whatsoever they listed both matthew 17 verse 12 and luke 1 verse 17 agree john the baptist had elijah's spirit upon him putting these findings together elijah's anointing comes upon four other men besides elijah himself telling five total appearances of elijah's spirit elijah first kings 17 verse 1 elisha second kings 2 verses 19-15 the preparation elijah john the baptist malachi 4 verses 5 and 6 with luke 1 verse 17 isaiah 40 verse 3 with matthew 3 verses 1 through 3 malachi 3 verse 1 with matthew 11 verse 10 and matthew 17 verses 12 and 13. the restoration elijah william branham according to malachi 4 verses 5 and 6 matthew 17 verse 11 luke 17 verse 30 revelation 10 verse 7 with amos 3 verse 7 elijah in the tribulation accompanied by moses revelation 11 verses 3 through 13. malachi 4 verses 5 and 6. this text mentions the spirit of elijah working in two separate ministries before judgment strikes the world before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord these two ministries belong to john the baptist and william branham john prepared the way for the messiah's first coming and branham restored the way for jesus's second coming malachi 4 verse 6 reads and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers lest i come and smite the earth with a curse the two ministries elijah's spirit fulfills are turning the heart of the fathers to the children and turning the heart of the children to the fathers according to luke 1 verse 17 john the baptist fulfilled the first ministry of turning the hearts of the fathers to the children and he shall go before him in the spirit and power of elias to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just to make ready a people prepared for the lord john by elijah's spirit prepared the people for the messiah jesus by preaching repentance mark 1 verse 4 proclaims john did baptize in the wilderness and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins repenting and obeying god is the definition of a turned heart romans 6 17 agrees saying but god be thanked that ye were the servants of sin but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you act 7 verse 39 shows a disobedient heart is turned back into worldliness to whom our fathers would not obey but thrust him from them and in their hearts turn back again into egypt the fathers john preached to were the first generation of believers who accepted the messiah the first generation included early father apostles like paul and peter these original apostles were deeply burdened for the children or last generation of christians who would see jesus's return to the earth and wrote about it john the baptist had the preparation ministry for the messiah preparing believers hearts through repentance to receive jesus malachi 3 verse 1 foretold this saying behold i will send my messenger and he shall prepare the way before me jesus affirmed this spoke of john in matthew 11 verse 10 for this is he of whom it is written behold i send my messenger before thy face which shall prepare thy way before thee isaiah 40 verse 3 and matthew 3 verses 1 through 3 teach the same saying john's voice would cry prepare ye the way of the lord but there had to come a restoration ministry another preacher anointed with elijah's spirit had to come to turn the hearts of the children or last generation of christians back to their fathers the first generation believers this book is one of many witnesses that william branham's ministry is turning hearts back to bible-based repentance and obedience so that end-time christians can love serve and understand god just like the early apostolic believers branham's bible revelations are currently restoring the book of acts church worldwide branham's restoration ministry is the former reign ministry from joel 2 verse 23 as former can mean teacher in hebrew after two decades of studying branham's teachings i can testify to the depths of sound teaching god has restored to his bride in every single area of doctrine the 12 mysteries true repentance salvation by grace prayer and fasting marriage and divorce modest appearance abomination still in effect two kinds of christians melchizedek the serpent seed predestination daniel's 70 weeks the feasts and holy days of israel ties and offerings torment in the lake of fire is not eternal divine healing the nine gifts of the spirit male only preachers male only angels and so much more while rejoicing and growing through the former reigns teaching we eagerly await the latter reign the final anointing of rapturing faith someone to delete the fourth elijah ministry to the gentiles and make the fifth elijah ministry of the tribulation a restoration but that would be a gross heir for two reasons first john the baptist came alone to turn the hearts of the apostolic fathers to the children in malachi 4 6 so the turning of the hearts of the children back to their apostolic fathers must be done by one elijah anointed man not two william branham came alone to turn the hearts of the children to the fathers the fifth elijah ministry of revelation 11 verse 3 consists of two men elijah and moses second the fifth elijah ministry during the tribulation is a ministry of judgment or torment according to revelation chapter 11 verse 10. this of course differs greatly from the fourth elijah ministry which brought restoration before the rapture additionally the 144 000 jews are restored only after jesus physically returns to them following the rapture of the two prophets zechariah chapter 13 verse 6 seems to support this because they are ignorant of the nail prince in jesus hands and his death on the cross what are these wounds in thine hands reconciliation and restoration occur only through the knowledge of the blood of jesus's cross according to colossians 1 verses 14 20 and 22 revelation 10 verses 7 through 11. these scriptures reveal jesus giving the open book formerly sealed with seven seals to an earthly seventh angel the open book's revelations are then taken around the world notice first the open book can only come to the earth at the end time agreeing with daniel 12 4 but thou o daniel shut up the words and seal the book even to the time of the end many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased revelation 10 verse 11 places this end time revelation at the end of the times of the gentiles because the open book is eaten and taken around the world to gentiles thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings the open book is not sent to israel only but to every nation under heaven revelation 10 verse 11 reveals god is going to finish jesus's great commission preached in matthew 28 verses 19 and 20 by the loosing of the seven seals the seventh angel of revelation 10 7 must be the same fourth elijah ministry because they both happen at the end time before the times of the gentiles finishes thus the seventh angel preaches during the seven church ages or times of the gentiles labeled as the seventh angel in revelation 10 7 he must be the angel of the church of the laodiceans in revelation 3 verse 14. because laodicea was the seventh and final gentile church jesus addressed amos 3 verse 7 the 7th angel of revelation 10 verse 7 must also be a prophet because amos 3 verse 7 assures god only reveals his mysteries to prophets surely the lord god will do nothing but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets branham revealed the secrets of these 12 bible-defined mysteries and also correctly foretold the future by the holy spirit sick believers were foretold of their healings by branham and they were well shortly thereafter brother branham correctly prophesied the immoral condition of the churches in the united states how no greater ministry would rise to the gentiles than what god gave to him and no christian denomination would return to an apostolic ministry additionally christ revealed the seven seals to branham the united states's identity position and destiny in revelation 13 and spoke with thus saith the lord regarding numerous bible doctrines luke 17 verse 30. the last of the six verses about god's end time restoration was detailed in chapter 12 under the section the last sign before the rapture the son of man ministry had to be revealed to the gentiles before the rapture and jesus anointed brother branham to fulfill this prophecy it's notable there are three r's emphasized in this day revelation restoration and rapture brahms ministry was the revelation of the son of man his ministry brought restoration of bible teachings turning hearts back to the apostolic fathers with the baptism of the holy ghost believers are ready for the rapture i trust you can now see the clear bible evidence for brother adam's ministry it was foretold by jesus malachi peter and john and witnessed by millions worldwide historical evidence of branham's restoration ministry historical evidence abounds for substantiating william branham's restoration ministry firsthand witnesses of his gifts of healing and discernment testify to god's anointing upon his life amazingly the pillar of fire was photographed in his meetings speaking with thus saith the lord branham spoke god's opinion on sound doctrine and foretold the future researching branham's life you will see the characteristics of elijah spirit upon the kentucky born prophet healings and discernment branham's healing ministry is legendary as god used it to initiate the post-world war ii healing revival although his healing campaigns began in 1946 branham had been pastoring a local church in jeffersonville indiana since 1933 met by an angel and commissioned to pray for the sick in may 1946 healings multiplied throughout his state the nation and then the world observed branham's ministry began first well before other evangelists because god himself ordained it oral roberts began his own healing campaigns in 1947 and billy graham rose to national acclaim in 1949 after only four years of supernatural ministry over one thousand ministers gathered at a voice of healing convention in 1950 to recognize branham's influence on the healing revival they praised god and paid tribute to branham for inspiring them to start praying for the sick as moses was given two signs to prove he was god's deliverer god commissioned branham with two signs a sign in his hand to identify sicknesses and discernments to know the secrets of hearts divinely equipped the power of a branham service remains a legend unparalleled in the history of the charismatic movement the largest stadiums and auditoriums in the world were filled with worshipers and jesus christ mightily healed and saved his people branham's sign in his hand detected diseases when a sick person put their right hand into his left hand mita branham william's wife was detected as having a tumor on her left ovary around 1948 well before it caused me to pain over the next 15 years the tumor grew until it bulged out of meda's side causing her to hobble as she walked but in november 1963 the angel of the lord met branham and told him to speak to the tumor he prayed before the doctor's hand shall touch her the hand of god shall take the tumor away and it won't even be found so it was the tumor literally vanished as she sat in the doctor's office seconds before her doctor asked to touch it authentic healings were commonplace in branham's ministry guided by a vision branham traveled to milltown indiana to pray for 28 year old georgia carter tuberculosis had caused her to wither away to 50 pounds and had kept her bedridden for nearly 9 years branham grabbed her hand and called upon the name of the lord jesus and she was instantly healed she spent the rest of her days as the pianist at the local baptist church another saint named florence humes was healed of tuberculosis in 1955 almost all hope was lost as florence mother of three girls was rapidly losing weight in a prayer line in campbellsville kentucky branham first discerned her disease then condemned satan in prayer and turned florence loose in the name of jesus christ florence miraculously recovered having five more children 25 grandchildren and over 40 great-grandchildren you can listen to the audio of this miraculous event online i had the pleasure of meeting florence before she passed in 2015. the healing of congressman william upshaw in 1951 remains one of the most powerful healing testimonies from branham's meetings after being a paraplegic for nearly 50 years bound to a wheelchair and crutches upshaw attended branham's meeting and rose from his wheelchair walking in complete healing he preached christ the rest of his days testifying of christ's mighty power upshaw claimed to have sent his written testimony to president truman every senator and congressman king george vi winston churchill and even joseph stalin again you can listen to upshaw's own voice give this testimony online healing magazines like the voice of healing catalogue jesus's power in branham's ministry at branham's memorial service in january 1966 the late evangelist tommy osborne well said the man we know is william branham was sent to demonstrate god again in the flesh branham came our way as the prophet of god and showed us in the 20th century precisely the same things that were shown us in the gospels where we read of a few incidents in the gospels we have seen hundreds in our generation no less great nor wonderful but far more numerous we have seen them in our day unfortunately most historians reject branham's teachings but gladly accept and praise god for the supernatural healings via his two signs the same was true of jesus's earthly ministry multitudes rejoiced over his miracles but many of his own disciples left his ministry because of his doctrine faithful saints accept the bible-based words of life jesus revealed to branham just as peter stayed with jesus when the majority left saying lord to whom shall we go thou hast the words of eternal life the return of the pillar of fire it's historically proven that the pillar of fire returned to vindicate brother branham's ministry you first learned of the pillar of fire or the lord in a visible manifestation leading moses and the children of israel as they journeyed from egypt the pillar of fire has to be jesus's spirit or the holy spirit for hebrews 11 verse 26 plainly says moses esteemed the reproach of christ the lord as the pillar of fire met moses to give him the ten commandments and also inspired him to write the pentateuch or the first five old testament books since the pillar of fire was visible at the onset of the old testament it had to come at the founding of the new acts 9 verses 3 through 6 and galatians 1 verse 17 point to jesus being the pillar of fire who met paul and later inspired him to write the majority of the new testament's foundational epistles since restoration was foretold the mystery of god was to be finished and desperately needed at the close of the new testament it was necessary for the pillar of fire to return overall the church was in a lukewarm state and couldn't understand the old or new testament but god promised to restore daniel 12 4 says the book would be sealed into the end time when jesus brings the open book to earth after loosing its seven seals as told in revelation 10. in march of 1963 the lord met branham in the desert near tucson arizona and commissioned him to preach the seven seals with thus saith the lord these revelations rightly divided the word of truth making the bible understandable and god's presence real once again god had visited his prophet in a desert to bring the word of the lord god previously met moses in the wilderness to inspire the writing of the old testament and jesus led paul to the arabian desert to inspire his writing of the new now god was fulfilling revelation 10 1-7 by meeting with his prophet branham in the desert to finish his divine mystery two evidences support the spirit's visible return in brother branham's ministry on january 24 1950 a picture was taken of branham at a debate on divine healing in houston texas sea figure 26 above his head is the pillar of fire and this photo remains the most well-known picture of the post world war ii healing era george j lacy an official examiner of question documents verified the photo was not retouched but light struck the negative a second evidence of the visible pillar of fire was on january 8 1961 when the spirit became visible to the entire branham tabernacle congregation at the conclusion of branham's sermon about the book of revelation see chapter 7. audio exists from the supernatural occurrence the return of thus saith the lord accompanying the pillar of fire's return was the necessary return of a prophet speaking for god with the full authority of thus saith the lord moses spoke this authoritative phrase to both pharaoh and israel paul prophesied the rapture by the word of the lord and challenged the corinthians to recognize his prophetic authority to speak for god what came the word of god out from you or came unto you only if any man think himself to be a prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge that the things that i write unto you are the commandments of the lord branham's picture with the pillar of fire validates god choosing him to speak on behalf of heaven with all due respect note that preachers like oral roberts and billy graham never spoke with thus saith the lord for they were not commissioned by god to do so both men had their gifts and positions but not as prophet of the lord modern preachers like t.d jakes and joel olsteen never prophesy with us saith the lord like brother branham did truly no man in recent history has spoken like branham in the name of the lord and exercised such an awesome unparalleled gift of discernment remember it's thus saith the lord will never see a greater gift to the gentiles before the rapture than branham's discernment gift open your bible and heart to receive these 30 statements brother branham spoke with the same thus saith the lord authority as moses and paul thus saith the lord regarding doctrine the divine presence of the pillar of fire in branham's meetings led him to preach doctrine with the authoritative phrase thus saith the lord doctrine is instruction a direct order or command this means god was speaking direct orders originally found in scripture through his prophet to christians of this final age while most left branham because of his doctrine the true bride of christ were and still are drawn like a magnet to his bible-based teachings the main reason believers follow branham's doctrines is because they are found in the word of god in my personal life i went to many churches and always left feeling disappointed and unfulfilled before jesus gave me my heart's desire with branham's bible-centered doctrines his bible references answered my questions about every aspect of my life i could physically point to the scripture in the bible providing me specific instructions on how to live i finally knew i was doing god's perfect will concerning the doctrinal mysteries in this book six of the twelve were delivered with thus saith the lord from god through branham chapter one regarding the doctrine of the godhead as one person and not an unholy trinity of three persons trinitarianism is of the devil i say that thus saith the lord look where it come from it come from the nicean council when the catholic church become in rulership the word trinity is not even mentioned in the entire book of the bible and as far as three gods that's from hell there's one god chapter two regarding the doctrine of israel's blindness to their own messiah originally taught in the fifth seal if you've never heard if you ever believed i ever said anything in a sermon inspired you take them tapes on the seven seals and if you ever heard anything that's really as i can say it's thus saith the lord get those chapter 6 regarding the doctrine of the baptism of the holy ghost i want to make myself very clear on what the baptism with the holy ghost is according to the word it is not according to me and it is not according to you it has to be according to thus saith the lord for we are falsely led amen chapter 7 regarding the revelations of the seven church ages now the vision plus the word plus the history plus the church ages and all blend together so i could truly say that to the best of my understanding and according to the word of god in the vision and the revelation the interpretation thereof is thus saith the lord chapter 9 regarding the roman catholic church as the mother harlot of revelation 17 and then finally she the roman catholic church was the mother of harlots she gave birth unto churches after her because they couldn't have been boys they had to be girls and we find out that the protestant church is a product of the catholic church by searching the scriptures and looking at your history book we see that the protestant church is the product and the protestant can't holler at the catholic because the both says they are harlots and that's flat but that's thus saith the lord chapter 10 regarding the mystery of iniquity working by the antichrist spirit now but you see antichrist come in as we pictured it and showed it what a revelation my my and to think all these years we've seen it moving up and here it is it's absolutely directly thus saith the lord additionally branham highlighted eight individual doctrines as thus saith the lord with their validating scriptures recognizing jesus's enigma in matthew 28 verse 19 water baptism is to be performed in the literal name of jesus christ acts 2 verse 38 acts 8 verse 16 acts 10 verse 48 acts 19 verse 5 and acts 22 verse 16 rather than the titles of father son and holy ghost thus saith the lord the baptism using the title of father son and holy ghost is false thus saith the lord i command every one of you on here or on tape that hasn't been baptized in the name of jesus christ be baptized again in the name of jesus christ marriage in divorce matthew 5 32 matthew 19 verses 3 through 13 and the serpent seed doctrine genesis 3 verse 15 proverbs 30 verse 20. and here they are the true mystery of marriage and divorce and the serpent's seed and all these things that's been fussed about it's thus saith the lord what is it the quickening power coming to the church making her ready this hour that we're approaching quickening power ancient rome morphed into papal rome and rules the world at the end time as the fourth kingdom from daniel's interpretation of nebuchadnezzar's dream daniel 2 verses 40 through 43 russia communism isn't conquering nothing god's word can't fail romanism is going to conquer the world let's take daniel's vision that's the word of god thou o daniel thou o king nebuchadnezzar is the head of gold babylon another kingdom will succeed thee which is silver see which was medes o persia another one was greece alexander the great next come in rome and there wasn't nothing said about a communism rome conquered the world catholic hierarchy with all the denominations in the world right now coming together as an organization the confederation of churches organizing themselves together it isn't russia it's rome thus saith the lord yeah show me a scripture where communism or anything else besides rome will rule women who purposely dress in sexy provocative clothes will answer for committing adultery because they cause men to lust after them proverbs 7 verse 10 and verse 27 matthew 5 verse 28 they don't know what decency means out here with little old tight dresses on and things like that and men lusting after them and think that they're decent you might not have done nothing wrong sister but let me tell you you're a tool of the devil and at the judgment bar thus saith the lord you'll answer for committing adultery and your soul will be gone you know better a woman who cuts her hair shames both her husband and christ and is spiritually dead having rejected the quickening or life-giving power of the holy ghost baptism first corinthians 11 verses 1 through 16 ephesians 2 verses 1 through 3. the woman that's a child of god lets her hair grow to show that she's consecrated to every word of god if she cuts it off i don't care how much she dances sings is in the choir speaks in tongues runs up and down or has all kinds of aid societies she is dead that's thus saith the lord the word of god branham's bible-based teachings are restoring god's people back to the fullness of pentecost joel 2 verses 23-26 the people of god are being made ready by the word of truth from the messenger to this age in her will be the fullness of pentecost for the spirit will bring the people right back to where they were at the beginning that is thus saith the lord it is thus saith the lord for that is what joel 2 verses 23-26 says the elijah messenger to the gentiles malachi 4 verses 5 and 6. the fourth ministry of elijah appeared in the united states in the 1960s god has promised malachi 4 for this last day and malachi 4 has not yet been fulfilled but it must be fulfilled for it is a germatized word of god spoken through malachi the prophet jesus referred to it it is to be just before the coming of christ the second time all scripture that has not been fulfilled must be before that time the bible is to be finished two to be finished the gentile dispensation is to be finished with the church age when this anointed messenger arrives of course he will plant the seed of the entire bible plum from the serpent to the messenger in the former rain then he will be rejected by the denominational people as his forefather john and elijah as was spoken by our lord so it's at this time in this country that that person will appear for it's in the scripture and it's thus saith the lord fulfilled prophecies and three in the process of coming to pass one qualification for being a genuine prophet is to foretell something in the lord's name and then see it come to pass william branham was a true prophet for he correctly prophesied the passing of florence chicarian in 1965 and the healing of florence humes in 1955. in chicarian situation she was diagnosed with inoperable cancer and after seeing a vision of her passing branham said thus saith the lord their daughter florence is going to die while it's not difficult to prophesy death for a cancer patient the context shows its supernatural origin florence's brother demas was a famous minister and several friends in their pentecostal ranks had prophesied in the name of the lord that florence would be healed but with florence's passing branham's word from the lord was proven to be true even when death is certain god sometimes uses prophets to warn the sick of their deaths just as elijah foretold king ahaziah of his certain death in second kings 1 verses 1 through 17. humes's situation described earlier was just as desperate as she was noticeably thin dying with tuberculosis but god's prophet condemned satan in jesus christ's name and foretold her healing saying god bless you sister tell you what to do to know whether i told you the truth you go monday and way then next monday way again see what i've told you amen indeed in the name of the lord hume saw the prophecy come to pass she was turned loose being made well living 60 more years three prophecies are in the process of coming to pass with the first being his 1961 prophecy of no greater gift arising to the gentiles than the gift of discernment god gave him chapter 12 details branham's discernment gift in the section the last sign before the rapture for 60 years this prophecy has stood firm preachers have come and gone some even performing miracles but none have come close to the discerning ability to know the thoughts and intents of the hearts like jesus repeatedly performed in branham video exists from branham's 1954 meetings in washington dc in which he told a cancer patient 15 secrets including her name address and ailments before pronouncing her healing in jesus's mighty name instances of infallible discernments like this were commonplace in branham's prayer lines a second prophecy coming to pass is the immoral condition of american churches in april 1965 branham shared a symbolic vision with thus saith the lord in which a group of women represented american churches the women had bobbed hair painted faces were dancing to rock and roll smoking cigarettes and hardly wearing any clothes in an attempt to sexually seduce history shows most churches especially pentecostals in 1965 condemned all these evil practices recently we've seen the acceptance of these sins in nearly every church specifically the celebration of rock and roll when i shared branham's vision with my mother now 70 years old she admitted her pentecostal denomination once forbid rock and roll until a decade ago her heart broke at a recent youth convention as she watched young people dance to rock rap and more something she thought would never have been accepted in her denomination undoubtedly this sinful trend will only increase since it's a warning in the name of the lord the third prophecy from july 1965 foretold the impossibility of christian denominations returning to the apostolic gospel and the certainty of their acceptance of the future pope antichrist god's prophet announced it's predicted that they're going to do it and they're going to do it for it's thus saith the lord they're going to do it you think them nominations will ever break up their denomination come back to the word it's thus saith the lord they won't will they go into the antichrist exactly it's thus saith the lord they will friend there is no hope for denominational systems in 56 years since his prophecy thundered out true apostolic revival has not come to a single denomination and never will come to their dead systems while the warning is stern god's grace to call out his people from organization is amazing revelation 18 verse 4 pleads with millions yet today come out of her my people that you be not partakers of her sins and that you receive not of her plagues future prophecies with thus saith the lord in divine mercy god has given us 11 future prophecies to help us prepare for jesus's rapture return the first is driverless cars prophesied in 1933 but not recorded on tape until 1958. branham said now i said it'll come to pass that those cars will not be run by a steering wheel it'll be something another run it's them cars they're bringing out right now remote control for safety now you remember that's thus saith the lord it's likely waymo a sister company of google along with tesla general motors and other companies will help bring this prophecy to pass backslidden united states has seven judgment prophecies against her we are coming into religious persecution with the same things that they did in pagan rome many years ago forced thus saith the lord and i say this thus saith the lord the god that america claims to serve will destroy her this america has become condemned and what did she do according to the vision she elected the wrong person i don't know how long it'll take it to run out but it will be some day thus saith the lord it will she's on her downward move right now she'll never come back again she's gone that's right she's been gone since 1956 when she condemned and turned away god from the great revival hours and remember thus saith the lord there will be a woman rule before the end time she'll either be president vice president or it'll be the catholic church as a woman i've seen her a great woman the nation bowed to her it will be one before the end time thus say the lord write it down and find out you young people see if it happens if it isn't i'm a false prophet i remember just my last message in california where i thought i never go back again when i predicted los angeles would go beneath the ocean thus saith the lord it will she is done she is washed she is finished what hour i don't know when but it will be sunk someday thus saith the holy spirit out of the word of god that america there had been whole turning god down and will receive the mark of the beast according to revelations the 13th chapter and we're moving into it the last and seventh vision was wherein i heard a most terrible explosion as i turned to look i saw nothing but debris craters and smoke all over the land of america along with branham's earlier prophecy that every denomination would take the mark of the beast he also described it as a form of unionized religion pertaining to labor union i know you work you men have labor unions and things that you if you want to work you have to belong to it that's exactly right you have to do that but watch it see because it's going to come from labor to religion one of these days see now you just remember it's a forerunner of everything becoming unionized you can't work they won't let you on the job your your scab unless you unless you belong to this union now remember you young people remember what brother branham's saying and may my words be engraved with an iron pen in a mountain of steel thus saith the lord that same thing will happen in religion you'll belong to a denomination of some sort or you cannot buy or sell so be real careful brother let it go just to labor alone watch it it's a warning god's spirit warns christians to spiritually battle against the effects of catholicism in punishment for failing to repent of untold iniquities a harsh prophecy is spoken against the vatican don't you never try to fight communism fight romanism for that's thus saith the lord the lord said romanism is going to rule not communism it's just a puppet remember i say this is god's prophet the russian empire will drop an atomic bomb of some sort on the vatican city and destroy it in one hour thus saith the lord armed with these thus say the lord doctrines and fulfilled and future prophecies jesus's earthly bride is now fulfilling revelation 10 verse 11 by sharing these prophecies essentially prophesying again and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings possessing thus saith the lord the word of the king makes you ready for the final showdown before the rapture this last showdown is between the true bride church of jesus christ and the false united denominational churches recall haman's wicked plot to kill esther and her people through evil laws that's a type of the catholic beast systems plot to lay down its worldwide mark in deadly religious persecution against jesus's bride through government legislation esther's intercession for the king's favor at the second wine banquet in the presence of her enemy haman secured deliverance the bride of christ's favor with king jesus will grant her deliverance from satan's false church at the latter wine banquet or the time when rapturing faith is poured out branham's elijah characteristics since william branham fulfilled the forthcoming of elijah's spirit he fittingly displayed numerous characteristics of elijah and john the baptist first all three men spoke the word of the lord elijah spoke with thus saith the lord when he prophesied of haziah's demise in second kings 1 verses 1 through 18. the word came to john in the wilderness whereby he foretold jesus would take away the sins of the world and baptize with the holy ghost as this chapter chronicles brother branham correctly spoke in the name of the lord more than 30 times second all three were set apart from and opposed the popular religious organizations of their day elijah rebuked ahab jezebel and their false 450 baal prophets in 1st kings 18 verses 17 through 22 and 1st kings 21 verses 20 through 25 john called the pharisees and sadducees a generation of vipers in matthew 3 verses 6 through 8 as god revealed the incurable iniquities of denominations branham condemned preachers who rejected bible revelations and today i indict this bunch of ordained ministers in their creeds and denominations they are crucifying to the people the very god that they claim that they love and serve i indict these ministers in the name of the lord jesus upon their doctrine that claim that the days of miracles is past and that the water baptism in the name of jesus christ is not sufficient and not right upon any of these words that they have substituted creeds for i indict them as guilty and the blood of jesus christ upon their hands for crucifying afresh the lord jesus the second time they are crucifying christ to the public taking from them the thing that they're supposed to be giving to them and they substituted something else in its place a church creed for popularity third these men condemned prominent immoral women elijah condemned jezebel's murder of innocent naboth in first kings 21 verses 17-29 john the baptist rebuked herod for his unlawful marriage to herodias prompting her to take off his head branham condemned the evil influences of marilyn monroe and jackie kennedy about monroe he warned i don't want you influenced by marilyn monroe i want you to be influenced by jesus christ see and by his word he is the word if the word don't influence you then christ can't because he is the word branham rebuked kennedy for encouraging women to cut their hair breaking first corinthians 11 verses 1 through 16. he preached i said a hard thing about mrs kennedy a couple times about her setting fashions for the world with these waterhead haircuts and how our sisters and them cut their hair and dress like mrs kennedy i said like a jezebel of old that's true fourth all three were men of the wilderness elijah was from gilead a mountainous region near the river jordan he spent time at the brook cherith being fed by ravens later he rested under a juniper tree and dwelt alone in a cave hearing god's voice john dwell in the wilderness receiving god's word and baptizing there john is well known for wearing camel's hair and eating locusts and honey brother branham spent much of his free time in the woods and wilderness in order to refresh his mind and body his gift of discernment sapped much of his physical strength just as daniel experienced in daniel 8 verses 26 and 27 nature was also his refuge a place to meet with god branham shared and my nature has always been to the woods i was born in the woods and i just seemed like was raised up there and even my conversion never took it out of me not so much to get the game but just to be in the woods i think god is there to see him how he moves lastly all three men battled the sin nature when not under the holy spirit's anointing fearing jezebel's threat elijah fled in 1st kings 19 verses 1-8 despite having so recently called fire down from heaven to consume his sacrifice while in prison john doubted whether jesus was the messiah despite having baptized jesus and having seen the spirit descend upon him like a dove under god's powerful anointing brother branham repeatedly and publicly declared he was god's prophet when correctly discerning a woman's infirmity he proclaimed and that you might know that i be god's prophet and his spirit is here on me now you also have a condition of the colon and bowel but when jesus's mighty anointing left brother random doubted he was a prophet hesitating to label himself so the people many times regard me as being a prophet i do not regard myself that no sir i do not i have i don't say that to be humble i say that to be truthful i do not regard myself to be a prophet of the lord i i haven't that honor false claims to be elijah although many men and women have falsely claimed to have elijah's anointing two stand out in particular john alexander dowie and tony palmer dowie 1847 to 1907 was a pastor from australia who moved to america and gained many followers in the chicago area dowie did indeed possess a legitimate healing ministry having won nearly 100 suits against doctors and clergy who denied his healing testimonies sadly he declared himself elijah the restorer in 1901 and was later removed from leading the city of zion for fiscal irresponsibility what's significant about dowie is the timing in which he falsely claimed to possess the elijah anointing as 1901 was only eight years before the true elijah was born william branham a biblical precedent exists for men recognizing god's season for prophecy to be fulfilled but prematurely injecting themselves into it in acts 5 verses 34-39 the jewish teacher gamalia names this and judas of galilee as men who boasted themselves as great ones and gained many followers to their shame and destruction these evil men sensed it was time for a great one to come and he did jesus christ but they selfishly exalted themselves as great rather than waiting for god's chosen one gamalia wisely advised the jewish council to abstain from persecuting peter and the christians for if the move was of men it would cease moving on to our day jesus himself taught many would rise and claim to be him right before his second coming in matthew 24 24 spiritual men recognize this is the season of jesus second coming and some allow satan to deceive them into pretending to be messiah but they lie do not fear for jesus says you'll know all the false prophets by their evil fruits you'll know the true church jesus's bride for shall have the correct interpretation of the bible and the power of the spirit accompanying her bishop tony palmer 2014 is best known for unifying the charismatic word of faith movement with the vatican in february 2014 palmer visited kenneth copeland's leadership conference in the spirit of elijah to reunite protestants and catholics it was a lie for the spirit of elijah had already spoken thus saith the lord through branham to fight against not unite with romanism the bishop claimed the protest against rome was over and all christians were catholics however revelation 18 verse 5 says heaven will not forget rome's sins palmer was right about one thing he knew elijah had to return before jesus second coming but must have overlooked branham's unequaled ministry the bishop erd by teaching the anointing unites us not the doctrine ii john 1 verse 9 teaches otherwise whosoever transgresseth and abideth not in the doctrine of christ hath not god he that abideth in the doctrine of christ he hath both the father and the son true christian unity requires both the anointing and true doctrine many false prophets and false christs have the anointing but are void of truth copeland's group swallowed up palmer's false unity plea blessing pope francis with all their hearts and souls an idolatrous statement and visited the vatican a few months later to officially unite in brotherhood yes the iron catholics and clay protestants of daniel 2 verse 43 are mixed but not cleaving one to another true god-fearing protestants remain staunchly opposed to rome for the blood of millions of martyrs is on her hands and she is guilty of continual idolatry marialatry pedophilia and every other unclean spirit tragically palmer died in a head-on motorcycle accident in july 2014 and we mourn for his wife children and family but the question remains if elijah's spirit upon branham had already come with thus saith the lord to condemn catholicism's iniquity how could god send another man with elijah spirit palmer to condone rome's wickedness and urge complete unity with the mother harlot scriptural and prophetic authority validates branham as god's true and only elijah messenger to this age william branham was not jesus in recent years two extreme erroneous groups have risen up around branham's movement one exalts branham as infallible essentially equal with jesus and the other labels him a charlatan william branham was not jesus far from it according to his own words he admitted he was a sinner saved by grace making thousands of sins per year and repenting frequently i make thousands of mistakes in each month in each year sure i do but when i see i'm wrong i say god i didn't mean to do it you know my heart i didn't mean to do that i was trapped into that i didn't mean to do it you forgive me lord branham plainly said i'm not infallible in 1963 after telling his congregation it was awful and tommy rot to say he was such in october of 1962 branham never wanted or accepted jesus's honor the ever-growing branham worship group says every word branham said was thus saith the lord this is blatant heresy in light of romans 3 verse 4 yea let god be true but every man a liar the rest of romans 3 says there is none righteous and every tongue has used deceit jesus alone is the only infallible man if branham was a true prophet he like every prophet would be infallible when he spoke in the name of the lord and with thus saith the lord it's my conviction branham was a true prophet but not every word he uttered was inspired as he often admitted during his lifetime brother branham battled and rebuked men who worshipped him two years before his death branham wondered if god would take him off the earth because men were giving him more attention than they were to christ's bible message i'm nothing i'm your brother don't you pay any attention to the messenger you watch the message don't watch the messenger god will take it away from you he will share his glory with nobody that's right don't you watch the messenger watch the message the man worshiping antichrist spirit never left after branham's death as many worship branham secretly by claiming his every word was infallible branham's supernatural gifts caused some to exalt him just as some confused john the baptist for jesus in john 1 verses 19-20 and this is the record of john when the jews sent priests and levites from jerusalem to ask him who art thou and he confessed and denied not but confessed i am not the christ anyone worshiping a man is the seed of satan however servants of god always battle this satanic scheme like paul and barnabas desperately condemned worship directed to them in acts 14 like john the baptist branham only pointed believers to jesus john said behold the lamb of god and branham directed believers away from his mortality pointing to the immortal christ praying may they look away from this mortal clay of a servant may they look to him who is the omnipotent who is and we know lord that we are finite no matter who we are we're still mortal but not the messenger but the message granted lord that's where we point to to jesus christ the son of god grant that he will be so real to everyone here today even to the little children that he will become the absolute of the entire congregation we ask it in jesus name amen any student of branham's teachings knows he grew in revelation some of his doctrinal understandings greatly changed over the course of his ministry for example branham grew in his understanding of the godhead and the seven seals in 1952 he thanked god for the great third person of the trinity who burned in his heart but nine years later he boldly preached trinitarianism was of the devil branham originally believed the white horse writer of revelation 6 2 was the holy spirit but three years later declared he was the antichrist spirit with thus saith the lord in both doctrines his later interpretations contradicted his first teachings proving not every word he said was divine since god doesn't contradict himself branham's growth and understanding is a sign of his humble teachable christ-like spirit william branham was not a charlatan the anti-brahm group claims he was a charlatan but their assumptions are evidence of their ignorance one claim against branham was that he purposely lied and exaggerated stories in order to gain influence it's true details and random stories change at times but nothing suggests he was lying humans sometimes forget details which i can relate to as a minister of the gospel also unlike nearly every other human brother branham spent much time daily seeing visions in a heavenly dimension many associated with him witnessed him constantly breaking in and out of visions as daniel suffered physically and mentally from visions branham did too a weary mind is prone to forgetfulness but god's amazing grace kept branham sharp with thus saith the lord branham wasn't afraid of being challenged as he openly invited listeners to test his teachings by the word quoting prove all things repeatedly he knew the bible was always right and accepted correction from it now we must prove all things by the scripture not what if it's contrary to my faith and yet the scripture says so the scripture is right and i'm wrong see the scripture is always right and only way you can do anything is come back to the scripture a second more serious attack is saying branham's prophecies failed but branham has evidence of accurately foretelling events in the name of the lord as you've already read five prophecies that have either come to pass or are in the process of being fulfilled the anti-brahm group makes three mistakes regarding branham's prophecies first they claim prophecies have failed because they haven't come to pass but ignore the fact that brother brahm never put a date on their fulfillment next they fail to recognize some prophetic visions are conditional while others are unconditional conditional promises come to pass through human obedience and thus can remain unfulfilled due to disobedience joshua 1 verses 1 through 4 shows god's conditional promise to israel through joshua equivalent to thus saith the lord regarding their potential boundaries or coasts but judges one and two show israeli tribes failed to drive out all the inhabitants of canaan thus not fully claiming their coasts did god's own thus saith the lord fail no that generation of israelis failed god's conditional thus saith the lord promise due to disobedience and miss their opportunity to expand their borders on the other hand jesus's earthly life and mission is an example of an unconditional promise despite herod's efforts to kill all israeli male babies two years old and under god protected baby jesus by sending him and his parents to egypt isaiah's thus saith the lord prophecies about jesus's life death and resurrection in isaiah 53 were going to be fulfilled no matter what a final mistake is denying the fact that god can use other men to fulfill brother branham's prophecies if they have not yet come to pass in 1st kings 19 verses 15-17 the lord commanded elijah to anoint hasael jehu and elisha elijah could have said thus saith the lord i'm going to anoint three men but elisha was the only one he anointed hasiel seems to be anointed by elisha in second kings 8 verses 13 through 15 and jay who is anointed by a son of a prophet in second kings 9 verses 1 through 13. scripture doesn't offer a reason why god didn't allow elijah to anoint the other two men but you learn we cannot interpret prophecies by human reasoning god is the only true interpreter of his word i must insert a friendly challenge to readers to contact me if you think a branham prophecy has failed after two decades of studying and preaching revelations god revealed to branham i'm convinced branham was a genuine prophet of god who was accurate with thus saith the lord brother branham was as genuine as christians come with impeccable character financially branham lived a very modest life shunning luxurious living unlike today's many prosperity preachers he lived true to his first wife hope and after her death did the same with his second wife meda branham kept his ministry small when other ministers of his time like oral roberts spent millions to expand theirs all while compromising on bible truths brahms purpose in staying small was to be able to preach to any size congregation and to abstain from begging for money but i've kept my meeting small i've never tried to get big or some great big program where i have to beg people for money when it gets like that i'll fold the bible and go back to my tabernacle see i never have to do that may god help me to never do it i've never had big programs so i can go to a church that holds ten and hold a revival or if the lord wants me to preach to a hundred thousand he sends somebody along to pay for it so i go on and preach to a hundred thousand so that's the way we live so just don't have to have money just very small no these are not the words of a charlatan rather they reveal branham was a humble honest christian who was loved and vindicated by god but despised and rejected by the majority of christendom william branham and the twelve mysteries two bible passages foretold brother branham's ministry of restoring the twelve mysteries the twelve pieces of shoe bread and elijah repairing the altar with 12 stones on december 30th 1962 william branham preached two sermons and the latter evening service was different than any other sermon he had ever preached the sermon titled is this the sign of the answer contained a cluster of interrelated dreams and visions he couldn't interpret yet he spoke in the name of the lord that something important was going to happen soon branham wondered if the dreams and visions meant his death or jesus's coming but three months later the lord showed him they signaled a furthering of his ministry into its third and final phase the last phase of branham's ministry was to finish the mystery of god in fulfillment of revelation 10 verse 7. he spent the second half of the is this the sign of the answer sermon preaching all the bible mysteries that needed to be explained before the end time many of which he had already preached branham began the teaching by quoting c.i scofield's comments on matthew 13 verse 11 which defined 11 new testament mysteries and then added more bible revelations god's people needed it became clear to me that schofield and branham were on to something divine and i began studying these mysteries to begin my search i used my electronic bible concordance to search the king james version for every scripture that used the word mystery and found twenty-seven after reading them all i concluded there were twelve mystery doctrines not eleven scofield left one out the mystery of god's will found in ephesians 1 verse 9. 12 mysteries connects to 12 loaves of shoe bread in the old testament holy place just as the seven church ages were represented by the seven golden candlesticks the types have to match the anti-types there were not 11 loaves of bread but 12. next the spirit of god brought to my remembrance how branham taught the waters of separation and moses's tabernacle typed our new testament worship experience old testament worshippers first had to be sprinkled with the waters of separation before they could even enter moses tabernacle so the red heifer typed jesus death on the cross and the sprinkling of the water typed a believer's first act of repentance first peter 1 verse 2 shows new testament sprinkling as god's anointing to repent and obey elect according to the foreknowledge of god the father through sanctification of the spirit unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of jesus christ once sprinkled the cleansed and forgiven believer could enter the outer court and offer sacrifices which typed justification the first new testament work of grace branham taught this and said old testament worshipers in the outer court still lacked fellowship with almighty god for there were two courts they could not enter holy place and the holiest of holies in the new many believers repent and worship god but fail to advance in worship with the holy place representing sanctification and the holiest of holies typing the baptism of the holy ghost or true fellowship with god branham taught now my baptist brother i want to ask you something if justification is all god requires i'd like to ask you this when the man was separated by the waters of separation sprinkled then he could not yet enter into the worship of the glory of the lord he could not do it because he was only sprinkled from his sins it separated him from his sins but it did not put him in fellowship that's right it only separated him from his sins now ephesians says we are washed by the water of the word now hearing the word and being just as religious as you want to be and your your pastor a scholar and your doctor of divinity a scholar still that don't put us in fellowship no sir it will not do it because they were only separated from their sins now that's a justification was martin luther's doctrine we know that being justified by faith and still it didn't bring a fellowship the anti-type of the holy place is the second work of grace called sanctification sanctified christians today must worship with all three furniture pieces the seven golden candlesticks the twelve loaves of shoe bread and the altar of incense the seven candlesticks speak of branham's thus saith the lord interpretation of the seven church ages see chapter seven believers must recognize their church age laodicea and maintain a brightly burning testimony for christ as every other age accomplished then believers feast on the fresh spiritual shoe bread the bread of his face or the twelve new testament mystery doctrines tasting the goodness of the lord before entering the holiest christians become prayer warriors offering fiery sincere prayers including sighing and crying for the abominations done in the world a crucial point about the twelve loaves of shoe bread as the twelve new testament mysteries is that paul said you can understand all mysteries yet not have love in first corinthians thirteen verse two and though i have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge and though i have all faith so that i could remove mountains and have not charity i am nothing just as priests could devour the shew bread yet still not enter the holiest believers today can devour the 12 mysteries and still not be born again yes you can understand all the mysteries the 12 previous chapters of this book and still not be filled with the holy ghost baptism experience a dedicated sincere prayer life is needed to be born again as evidenced by the altar of incense being the final piece of furniture before entering the holiest the third work of grace the baptism of the holy ghost is tight by the holiest of holies god meets with and speaks to christians in their souls as exodus 25 22 says it was the place of meeting and communion or speaking the ark of the covenant contained two tables of stone the pot of manna and aaron's rod the stone tables speak of the new testament word covenant written on the fleshly tables of our hearts according to second corinthians 3 verse 3 the part of manna represents god sharing his original supernatural word with believers in every generation god's word is incorruptible and satisfies the hungry soul for he satisfieth the longing soul and filleth the hungry soul with goodness aaron's rod represents a resurrected quickened soul according to ephesians 2 verse 5 even when we were dead in sins hath he quickened us together with christ by grace ye are saved i believe there's a second scriptural precedent for branham restoring the 12 mysteries first kings 18 verses 30 and 31 shows elijah repairing the altar of the lord with 12 stones at the mount carmel showdown once the altar of worship was restored elijah prayed and the fire fell vindicating him as god's true prophet elijah showdown typed the final showdown coming before the rapture which branham calls the mount zion latter rain showdown then in the latter rain will come a mount carmel showdown he will be indicated pointed out in the word revelation 10 7 and god will vindicate his ministry he will preach the truth as elijah did and be ready for the mount zion showdown in our day branham had the spirit of elijah and restored true worship by placing 12 stones or the 12 mysteries in their proper place matthew 16 verses 17 and 18 teach a stone or rock is a revelation one day soon the holy ghost fire will fall vindicating branham as god's true prophet as evidenced by his followers being raptured into the sky to meet jesus in the air branham's emphasis on the bible and concordance amazed by the revelations of moses's tabernacle typing new testament worship i wondered how to teach the twelve new testament mysteries the holy spirit reminded me of how he taught branham to interpret the seven seals and i followed his example each day before preaching one of the seals god showed branham a vision interpreting its meaning then branham would spend the rest of the day finding bible support for each vision's meanings using his concordance to locate scriptural evidence for god's revelations here branham explains it well and then i thought well what is it lord and i walked up and down the floor while i'd kneel down and pray go back and pick up the bible sit down and read walk back and forth and then all of a sudden when i got quiet hear it vision just unfolded like that then i grab a pen right quick and go to writing it down like that whatever i was seeing and doing watching it like that till i got it wrote down then i take the rest of the day and go down and chase this out and see if it all tied all the way down through the scriptures then it prove all things see further brother branham likens this method to raising a building stone by stone which connects to his elijah-like ministry of restoring the altar of worship using 12 stones or 12 mystery truths so help me i never knew it before none of these things revelations of the seals have i ever known before that's right and i just don't just go up there and take the bible and sit down and sit there until when it vision goes to breaking forth like that i just pick up my pen and start writing see and just stay there maybe for hours till it gets uh it gets finished then i go back and i find out as i see where he said this i thought well looks like i've seen that somewhere i got my concordance go look back is there something like that and here it is right here and then here it is over here again here it is back here and down here and over here then i just tie it right in i know that's god as long as it's comparing scripture with scripture that's the way it has to do just like putting a building together the stones have to fit stone by stone in my case with the twelve mysteries i'm not a prophet so i never saw visions but i started with the unfailing thus saith the lord teachings from branham as my foundational rock with each mystery such as chapter five's mystery of godliness i used the concordance to look up each occurrence of godliness in the king james version there are 15 then i looked up each of the eight character traits such as virtue and temperance in the concordance and every bible occurrence had to be taken into prayerful consideration in understanding the trait it's indisputable that the bible interprets itself so the revelation of virtue temperance and every other trait must already lay in scripture this book's aim has been to clearly prove the revelations of the 12 mysteries are already in the bible branham's experience in the spiritual realms supporting heavenly visions using his bible in concordance caused him to distinguish his teachings on the seven seals as his greatest meetings he says the spirit's revealing of truth is greater than divine healing of all the times that i've been behind the pulpit at the tabernacle i have never never in any time of my ministry ever worked into the realms of god and the spiritual realms as it's been this time yeah it's beyond anything i ever did in any time of my ministry in any meeting at anywhere like this mostly it's on healing this is revealing of truth by the same spirit see same spirit branham on mysteries as bread while no one quote exists of brother branham saying twelve mysteries numerous quotes associate mysteries and bread in moses's tabernacle the shoe bread was hidden from the public inside the holy place priests alone could eat of it once a week the manna was even more exclusive accessible only once a year to israel's high priest interestingly there's no biblical record of any priest eating from the pot of manna spiritually speaking the 12 bible mysteries are hidden from most christians accessible only to spiritual priests who are living sanctified lives born again christians who enter into the holiest by the baptism of the holy ghost behold the pot of manna or original eternal word delivered on the day of pentecost branham's first quote connecting mysteries and bread is fittingly from december 1960 immediately after he preached the revelation of the mystery of the seven stars and seven golden candlesticks the seven church ages according to a dream or vision from the lord he says his preaching was a mountain of bread the saints were feasting on help me god because i seek sincerely to know your will that i might do it to bring as you showed me many years ago when i left this church the bread of life to the peoples of the world when i saw that great mountain of bread and white robe saints coming from all over the earth to eat this bread of life oh god let me oh god let me never never fail to feed the people on the bread of life bless these hungry souls in here that raise their hands just now in june 1964 brother branham likens christians to spiritual kings and priests who enter into the holy place and holiest of holies eating shoe bread or bibles with brand new revelations it may be but you see inside behind that badger skin behind that human skin in there is the shekinah glory in there is the power in there is the word in there is the shoe bread and the shekinah glory which is the light that makes light that ripens grain you kansas people know that by your wheat crops without that sun it won't light and until you come in behind that badger skin until you get out of your old skin your old thoughts your old creeds and come into the presence of god then the word becomes a living reality to you then you're awakened to the shekinah glory then the bible becomes a new book then jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever you're living in his presence eating the shoe bread that's only provided that day for believers priests only and we are priests royal priesthood a holy nation peculiar people giving spiritual sacrifices to god but you must come in to behind the veil to see the unveiled god and god is unveiled that's his word made manifest next in what may be the most important quote associating mysteries and bread brother branham uses malachi 4 verses 5 and 6 and revelation 10 verse 7 to say god is turning our hearts back to eating all the revealed mysteries calling them the shoe bread of this laodicean church age the shekinah glory it ripens the shoe bread that we feast on and drive across the country for hundreds of miles see it's the believer's food it's only for a believer remember the shoe bread was only for the believer only see shoe bread seed notice what does it do that's your kind of glory over the shoe bread kept it from spoiling what's this your kind of glory today to break beyond the veil to see who god is standing before you see who god is standing here before us the the pillar of fire he is veiled in human flesh but what does the shekinah what did it do the shoe bread seed the word that were to live on in this day by these promises the shekinah glory ripens that shoe bread brings it to pass makes it bread to the believer that laid in the pages of the bible year after year the word for this age to the denominations it's a stumbling block to the denominations they stumble at it down through the years luther wesley martin luther and all sankey finney john smith knox all stumbled at it but what's it to be done in the last days what is to reveal bring forth what's malachi 4 to do to turn back the people from that stumbling block to break down the traditions and to reveal the bread with the shekinah glory watch it ripen and produce just exactly what it said it would do oh my the shoe bread for this age to the denomination a stumbling block a bunch of fanatics but we who believe but now as revelation 10 as promised all the mysteries of god that's been hidden the pages down through them years would be ripened brought forth in the age of the seventh angel's message restored truths another observation from is this the sign of the end sir is branham listing more mysteries after he read scofield's list of 11 such as the serpent seed the true understanding of grace non-eternal hell water baptism in jesus christ literal name and the return of the pillar of fire but notice these doctrines are not specifically labeled as mysteries in scripture like the 12 mysteries of each previous chapter since god's word omits the mystery label i choose to do the same the conclusion is twofold first some of these doctrines are part of the 12 mysteries showing they are mysterious they include the serpent seed as part of the mystery of iniquity grace accepted and grace failed in the mystery of godliness and water baptism as part of the mystery of the godhead second the doctrines not labeled as mysteries in the kjv such as non-eternal hell and the return of the pillar of fire can be categorized as restored truths christians lost during the church ages recall the end time is the age of restoration according to joel 2 verses 23-26 matthew 17 11 and acts 3 verses 20 and 21 revelations are hidden wisdom given to the wise the 12 bible-defined mysteries and branham's god-given revelations are so simple and plain you would think multitudes of church members would rejoice in them sadly most fulfill the denunciation given to the laosen church age thinking they have everything spiritually and desire nothing more from god in most of my conversations sharing about the mysteries church members disregard them showing no interest in the deep things of god if they had the spirit they would desire the deep things for the spirit searches all things yea the deep things of god lukewarm is god's description of this revelation rejecting group another reason church members reject the mysteries is because they're hidden from them first corinthians 2 verse 7 supports this saying but we speak the wisdom of god in the mystery even the hidden wisdom which god ordained before the world unto our glory why is it hidden because they have rejected god's previous attempts to show them truth billions will be left behind after the rapture and suffer god's wrath in the tribulation because they refuse god's counsel proverbs 1 verses 24 through 26 reads because i have called and ye refused i have stretched out my hand and no man regarded but ye have said at not all my counsel and would none of my reproof i also will laugh at your calamity i will mock when your fear cometh the tribulation is the reaping of their sinful planting david speaks of god's just dealings with mankind that apply to today in second samuel 22 verses 26-28 with the merciful thou will show thyself merciful and with the upright man thou wilt show thyself upright with the pure thou wilt show thyself pure and with the froward thou will show thyself unsavory and the afflicted people thou wilt save but thine eyes are upon the haughty that thou mayest bring them down jesus endured the same truth-rejecting demon-filled religious groups we battle the pharisees flat-out denied and ignored all the scriptures about jesus like groups today do to followers of brother branham's ministry john 7 52 exposes one major heir the pharisees made they never asked jesus where he was born they assumed he was born in galilee but bethlehem was his birthplace how many today hear brother branham's doctrines like the one person godhead the serpent seed women having uncut hair and never search the scriptures to see if they are true shame and folly is all that is left for such world loving church members proverbs 18 verse 13 confirms this he that answereth a matter before he heareth it it is folly and shame unto him holy ghost-filled christians want to know god's mysteries we delight in the deep things of god for they reveal god's heart we want to please god he is seeking true worshipers now for his eyes go to and fro throughout the earth to reveal himself to truth-hungry souls jesus heart trusts his wife paul says in first corinthians 4 verse 9 we are made a spectacle unto the world and to angels and to men the word spectacle means theater or public show giving us the imagery of a broadway show human history is a great drama being played out before the world angels and men thankfully the author and finisher of the script loves and protects those that love him and will not suffer them to be tempted above their capacity the final act in this climatic times of the gentile scene is for heaven's hero our husband jesus christ to return to rapture his bride off the earth revelation 19 verse 7 says our charge as jesus's future wife is to make ourselves ready the bible is our husband's love letter giving us both clear and secret instructions to prepare for the rapture the secrets or mysteries are only revealed to jesus's bride because she truly hungers to obey him deuteronomy 29 verse 29 proclaims this saying the secret things belong unto the lord our god but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children forever that we may do all the words of this law the distinctive characteristic of true christians is their desire to lovingly obey jesus as a wife obeys her husband thus the purpose of god revealing his mysteries is so you can do the will of god james 1 verse 22 says but be ye doers of the word and not hearers only deceiving your own selves jesus bride is a doer not a hearer only since you've received jesus spirit in the depths of your being your soul he has confidence that you'll do his good pleasure in everything recall how god confidently allowed job to be tested by satan himself god wasn't worried about job falling neither is he worried about you falling because you have already received his own life in your soul the holy ghost like job and the proverbs 31 woman jesus heart is confident in your obedience proverbs 31 verses 10 through 11 proclaims who can find a virtuous woman for her price is far above ruby's the heart of her husband dust safely trust in her so that he shall have no need of spoil truly god doesn't think he knows you're going to overcome satan and keep his word for you are the spiritual seed of abraham genesis 18 is repeating now as god is preparing to destroy the sin-loving sodomites of this world but god is graciously revealing all his plans to you like he did abraham because you're keeping his bible commands and the lord said shall i hide from abraham that thing which i do seeing that abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him for i know him that he will command his children and his household after him and they shall keep the way of the lord to do justice and judgment that the lord may bring upon abraham that which he has spoken of him since you love jesus christ with all your heart you're in the abraham group to whom jesus revealed his 12 mystery doctrines recall the four heart reactions to jesus from figure 21 in chapter eight jesus hid these revelations from the other three groups the lot group foolish virgins mrs lot group make believers like judas iscariot and sodomites unbelievers whether the rapture comes in this generation or a future generation jesus's blessing will rest upon you and your children because you're abraham's spiritual seed you've obeyed his voice and kept his commands isaac the seed of abraham received this same promise in genesis 26 verses 4 and 5 and i will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven and will give unto thy seed all these countries and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because that abraham obeyed my voice and kept my charge my commandments my statutes and my laws your ministry is making yourself ready finishing jesus's great commission and waiting for your heavenly husband to appear not on stage but above the stage in the air our promise remains then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord you don't know the day and hour of his return neither do the angels or the husband himself but he knows your heart and he's trusting you'll be ready conclusion with a comma scripture is clear that god promised to send a prophet anointed with the spirit of elijah to restore all things before jesus returns to the earth amos 3 verse 7 agrees saying god always sends a prophet to reveal the secrets our lord was obligated by his promises to send a prophet before the times of the gentiles were finished and he has come and gone speaking in jesus name with thus saith the lord the apostolic ministry of bible days has returned though small in number jesus's bride patterns herself after paul's divine pattern pointed to paul's scriptures by branham as a member of jesus's bride never let your hunger for god wane feed your soul daily upon god's fresh bread his word god doesn't condemn people for being born in sin but for loving darkness rather than light if your soul is full of holy ghost love you'll never denominate upon your own opinions instead you'll constantly seek more revelation from god branham had to stand against every denominational system because they grew lukewarm and thought they had no more need of god's power like revelation 3 verse 17 expresses god's prophet said that way when i speak against some denomination or the denominational system it isn't the people in there it's the system that i'm against you see that holds them apart holds us from receiving see they drop their declarations say we believe this period if they would end it with a comma we believe this plus as much as the lord can show us out of his word it would be all right but they do not do it that way you know that it couldn't be a denomination and do that see it would just be the move of god moving on all the time you see i'm a witness that god is active and moving in my life and our local church by his grace we're thrilled to be a part of god's restoration of the book of acts church the best part is the move of god is only going to increase in bride churches according to prophecy in joel 2 verses 23-26 imagine a church full of fresh bread fresh preaching imagine a church overflowing with wine joy and gladness and oil saints being born again imagine being satisfied leaving church every single time imagine long stretches of joyous praise to jesus imagine being unashamed of the gospel in every area of your life some saints are already experiencing these blessings but the bride worldwide is coming into them in order to fulfill god's promises my final prayer is for god to help us boldly utter the revelations he has made known to us as paul prayed in ephesians 6 verses 18-20 we are called to boldly share god's secrets not hide them from others dear jesus open doors of utterance to the lost and embolden our souls and spirits to make known the mystery of the gospel in their ears at the beginning of this book jesus secrets were at your fingertips but now they are written in your heart by the holy ghost god's secrets are both with you and in you proverbs 3 verse 32 affirms his secret is with the righteous second corinthians 4 7 says god's treasure is inside you but we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of god and not us i'm ending this book with a symbolic comma as a tribute to branham's dedication to constant revival through receiving further revelation from the holy spirit branham never denominated thinking he knew everything bride members today will keep the same humble attitude as their star messenger branham may you believe god sent william branham to finish the mystery of god and obey the bible truths he pointed to with all my heart i believe brother branham's bible-based revelations plus as much additional revelation the lord jesus christ will reveal to me out of his word
