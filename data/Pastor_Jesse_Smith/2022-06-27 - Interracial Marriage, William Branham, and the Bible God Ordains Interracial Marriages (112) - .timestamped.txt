[0:00] [Music]
[0:09] greetings friends in the name above all
[0:11] names the lord jesus christ
[0:14] the purpose of this video is to teach
[0:16] the bible truth about interracial
[0:18] marriage
[0:19] which is
[0:20] that god allows and accepts interracial
[0:23] marriage when he ordains it among two
[0:26] believers
[0:27] like he did with moses and zipporah and
[0:30] the second purpose of this video is to
[0:32] understand why god's prophet william
[0:34] branham was against interracial marriage
[0:38] it seems from my observations that
[0:39] brother branham was against interracial
[0:41] marriage for two reasons first because
[0:44] it was illegal in the united states in
[0:47] his lifetime but became legal in 1967
[0:50] and second because the era of the civil
[0:53] rights movement was a violent and
[0:55] tumultuous time to live in
[0:58] here's the outline for the video
[1:00] first we'll look at how we must
[1:02] recognize opinions of brother branham
[1:05] second we'll look at bible doctrine
[1:08] about interracial marriage
[1:10] third we'll look at positive things
[1:11] brother ram said about moses and
[1:13] zipporah
[1:15] fourth we'll look at negative things
[1:16] brother branham said about interracial
[1:18] marriage and the cultural context
[1:21] fifth we'll look at answers to questions
[1:23] about interracial marriage
[1:25] and sixth we'll look at a few
[1:27] inconsistencies among some message
[1:29] believers
[1:32] before starting the first section i want
[1:34] to thank message minister jason demars
[1:36] for his video about this topic
[1:39] which was a great help to me as i
[1:40] prepared this video
[1:43] also i wanted to say if you want to
[1:44] listen to two sermons i preached on this
[1:46] subject you can find them on the bride
[1:49] of christ fellowship akron youtube
[1:50] channel
[1:52] they were preached on june 19th and june
[1:55] 22nd 2022 respectively
[2:01] we must recognize opinions of brother
[2:03] branham
[2:05] friends we must recognize the human
[2:08] opinions of brother branham are not
[2:10] absolute truths
[2:12] as numerous videos of mine from the past
[2:14] have shown brother adam clearly taught
[2:17] his followers to be careful and discern
[2:19] between his human side his opinions
[2:22] that could be altogether wrong
[2:24] and the divine side or the prophetic
[2:26] gift which would be accompanied with
[2:29] thus saith the lord
[2:30] as he said in the sermon he cares to
[2:33] ucare 1963.
[2:36] brother branham repeatedly said he was
[2:38] not infallible
[2:40] brother branham said the tapes had
[2:42] mix-ups and he made mistakes like saying
[2:44] 700 did not buy the need to bail instead
[2:46] of 7000 all the time and just so you
[2:50] know i won't be playing all these quotes
[2:51] from brother branham because i put them
[2:53] in many of my videos from the past
[2:55] but if you need those quotes let me know
[2:58] i'll be happy to share them with you
[3:00] and i also want to conserve time in this
[3:01] video
[3:03] those who make brother branham and his
[3:05] tapes infallible are either
[3:07] one not saved and thus have a reprobate
[3:10] mind and worship the deity or idolatry
[3:13] spirit
[3:14] or two they are saved but not born again
[3:17] since they're not being led into all
[3:19] truth by the holy ghost as jesus
[3:21] promised
[3:22] and they also have very little
[3:23] discernment to judge between truth and
[3:25] error
[3:26] this would also mean these saved ones
[3:28] have a sinful complex of pridefully
[3:31] exalting brother branham and his tapes
[3:33] the third option is
[3:35] they could be born again but they have
[3:37] this one awful sinful mental complex of
[3:40] exalting the tapes to infallibility
[3:44] which is possible according to scripture
[3:46] as peter had an awful complex against
[3:48] eating with gentiles and would not do it
[3:51] as recorded in galatians 2 verses 11 to
[3:53] 15
[3:54] which paul rebuked him for having
[3:57] regarding this sinful complex of making
[4:00] the tapes infallible
[4:02] this complex causes people to be either
[4:04] under a delusional spirit or a lying
[4:07] spirit because they're not doing what
[4:09] the bible and brother branham said to do
[4:12] and those two things are first proving
[4:14] all things by the scripture
[4:16] and second making all doctrine run from
[4:19] genesis to revelation
[4:22] friends we must prove all things by the
[4:23] scripture and scripture does not forbid
[4:26] interracial marriages when both persons
[4:28] are believers in the one true god
[4:31] jehovah who we also know as the lord
[4:33] jesus christ because jehovah of the old
[4:36] is jesus christ of the new testament
[4:40] second brother branham said all doctrine
[4:42] should be taught from genesis to
[4:43] revelation
[4:45] and there is not a doctrine banning
[4:47] interracial marriages taught from
[4:49] genesis to revelation
[4:51] the truth that doctrine must run from
[4:52] genesis to revelation is found in isaiah
[4:55] 28 verses 9 and 10.
[4:57] god said in order to understand doctrine
[5:00] he said precept must be upon precept
[5:02] line upon line here a little there a
[5:04] little
[5:06] those who make every word on tape
[5:08] infallible
[5:09] are contradicting themselves and brother
[5:11] branham and creating a state of
[5:13] confusion
[5:14] and god is not the author of confusion
[5:17] this is true because numerous quotes
[5:20] from brother branham specifically say
[5:22] his words were not thus saith the lord
[5:24] and yet message believers will say every
[5:26] word was thus saith the lord completely
[5:29] contradicting brother branham and yet
[5:31] they say they believe every word brother
[5:32] branham said was thus saith the lord
[5:34] again proving they are delusional or
[5:36] insane or just liars
[5:39] here's a few examples regarding the 1977
[5:42] prediction brother banner said quote
[5:44] which i don't say the lord told me this
[5:46] end quote
[5:48] in 1951 the sermon the angel lord
[5:50] brother brahm said quote now this is not
[5:53] the lord speaking this is your brother
[5:55] brother branham end quote
[5:58] regarding marriage and divorce in 1964
[6:00] brother ram said quote let me say this
[6:03] not the lord let me say it end quote
[6:07] and then picking him up a little later
[6:08] in the paragraph quote now remember this
[6:11] is me not the lord see end quote
[6:15] next let's recognize two major
[6:17] observations regarding the quotes that
[6:19] show brother branham was against
[6:21] interracial marriage
[6:22] and again i believe brother ram's stance
[6:25] against interracial marriage was his
[6:27] opinion only and not a bible doctrine
[6:30] the first observation is brother ram
[6:31] never said thus say the lord interracial
[6:34] marriage is wrong
[6:37] now some may say brother branham sounded
[6:39] very serious and stern about this
[6:40] subject
[6:42] that may be true but emotion and zeal
[6:44] and seriousness does not always mean god
[6:47] was speaking through brother branham i
[6:49] have two examples about this
[6:51] regarding the 1977 prediction when
[6:54] brother branham was teaching on it in
[6:55] the 70th week of daniel he got so
[6:57] excited he was shouting and singing he
[7:00] even broke into the song
[7:02] oh we're watching for the coming of that
[7:04] glad millennial day when our blessed
[7:06] lord shall come and catch his wading
[7:08] right away
[7:09] of course we know the world did not come
[7:11] into total annihilation by 1977.
[7:15] a second example is brother rand's
[7:16] prediction that martin luther king jr
[7:19] would lead millions into a hitler-like
[7:22] death trap and brother branham said this
[7:24] in the sermon the third exodus from june
[7:26] 1963.
[7:28] brother iran was so serious and stern
[7:30] about this prediction that he said quote
[7:32] and remember i'm on tape end quote
[7:35] and then of course a month later in the
[7:36] sermon he cares do you care brother
[7:38] branham was asked if this was a prophecy
[7:40] or not and that is when he said no
[7:43] he said i have nothing on it from the
[7:45] lord it's just my opinion he said i
[7:47] could be altogether a wrong in my
[7:49] opinion about martin luther king jr
[7:52] and the second major observation is that
[7:53] brother branham rarely if ever used
[7:56] scripture to teach interracial marriage
[7:58] was wrong
[8:00] and of course i'm open to correction i'm
[8:02] going to go over brother ramsey's quotes
[8:03] against interracial marriage later in
[8:05] the video
[8:06] and if you see definite scriptures and
[8:07] those quotes
[8:08] that i'm missing please let me know
[8:11] i believe brother brown was so stern in
[8:13] his stance against interracial marriage
[8:15] because of two facts
[8:17] first interracial marriage was illegal
[8:19] in the united states until 1967
[8:22] and second the civil rights movement was
[8:25] a time filled with extreme violence
[8:27] against blacks and also some interracial
[8:30] couples
[8:32] to prove the first point that brother
[8:33] brown was a law-abiding citizen and
[8:36] therefore would be against interracial
[8:37] marriage because it was illegal
[8:39] let's listen to this quote from the
[8:40] sermon life 1962
[8:43] in the quote you'll hear brother branham
[8:44] say i abide by the laws
[8:47] and before we listen notice that brother
[8:48] branham never says the lord told him to
[8:50] say this or it was thus saith the lord
[8:53] so we know it wasn't that it wasn't thus
[8:55] saith the lord
[8:56] in this quote brother branham says you
[8:58] ought to leave it the way god made it
[9:00] and i believe that's his opinion because
[9:02] should moses and zipporah have not
[9:05] married and instead stayed the way god
[9:07] made them one hebrew and one ethiopian
[9:11] the answer is no
[9:13] moses and zipporah should have married
[9:14] because it was god who chose them to be
[9:16] married and brother branham himself said
[9:18] that brother ram said god chose zipporah
[9:21] for moses as we'll show later in this
[9:23] video
[9:24] and there one day we find out
[9:27] that even miriam a prophetess
[9:30] and aaron the high priest
[9:33] made fun of moses why
[9:37] because she was an ethiopian
[9:39] and felt wasn't enough women of our own
[9:42] a group to marry instead of going down
[9:43] there and marrying that woman
[9:45] that wasn't moses choice that was god's
[9:48] choice for moses
[9:52] and also recall how god rebuked miriam
[9:54] and aaron for speaking against moses
[9:56] marriage to zipporah the ethiopian
[9:59] but now let's listen to the life quote
[10:01] where brother ram said he wanted to
[10:02] abide by the laws against interracial
[10:04] marriage let's listen to the quote
[10:07] i said it's not for me to say
[10:10] the boss
[10:11] government said let it be what it is
[10:14] permit them to marry and so forth i said
[10:17] that's that's up to them as an american
[10:20] i i abide by the laws
[10:22] to me
[10:23] don't leave it the way god had it
[10:28] later in this video i'll show how the
[10:29] civil rights movement of the 1950s and
[10:31] 60s was a time filled with extreme
[10:33] violence against some blacks and some
[10:36] interracial couples
[10:38] before moving to the next section i want
[10:40] to clearly state
[10:41] that i believe everyone corrects brother
[10:43] branham whether they admit it or not
[10:47] and if they say they don't correct
[10:48] brother branham then they're either
[10:50] honestly ignorant of many of brother
[10:52] band's quotes because of all the changes
[10:54] in brother bam's opinions or slips of
[10:56] tongue and other human mistakes
[10:58] or they're possessed with a lying spirit
[11:01] or delusional spirit or we'd also say a
[11:03] reprobate mind
[11:05] now friends the reason i can be so stern
[11:07] with that statement
[11:09] that some people are possessed with a
[11:10] delusional spirit is because i have a
[11:12] running list of over 50 human opinions
[11:16] and mistakes brother branham made
[11:18] which lord willing i might make a video
[11:20] about later or a podcast and i don't
[11:22] compile this list to discredit brother
[11:24] branham because i believe brother
[11:26] branham was a true prophet of god
[11:28] but i compiled this list to show brother
[11:30] branham had human opinions that were not
[11:33] infallible and this agrees with what
[11:35] brother branham said he wasn't
[11:36] infallible
[11:38] he had human opinions that were not
[11:40] god's opinions and this list also shows
[11:44] the wicked spirit of idolatry that is
[11:46] upon many people who claim to believe
[11:48] brother branham but in reality they do
[11:50] not believe him
[11:52] and what's worse is they don't believe
[11:53] the bible
[11:55] i'm going to name some of these 50 plus
[11:57] human opinions of brother branham just
[11:59] so you have an idea of what i'm talking
[12:01] about
[12:02] first example is the martin luther king
[12:04] jr death trap we just mentioned which
[12:06] brother banner said was his opinion
[12:08] the 1977 prediction of total
[12:10] annihilation in the united states
[12:13] his son joseph branham as a prophet but
[12:15] yet he said that's my prayer anyhow
[12:18] brother graham's prayer for billy paul
[12:20] to be a full prophet but later said he
[12:22] wasn't called to be a minister
[12:25] brother brown's desire for rebecca his
[12:27] daughter to take his place
[12:30] brother ram statement that there can't
[12:31] be another generation in arizona due to
[12:34] the high birth rates of children with
[12:36] mental retardation
[12:38] brother branham's opinion that matthew
[12:40] 24 would be fulfilled in his generation
[12:43] which would mean a return of god to the
[12:44] jews
[12:45] and an ushering end of the tribulation
[12:47] period
[12:49] brother branham's agreement with a
[12:50] woman's dream that he'd be killed by
[12:52] gunshot by the false church as he was
[12:55] going into a meeting
[12:57] brother branham's opinion that billy
[12:59] paul was the promised joseph
[13:02] brother random statement that the third
[13:03] person of the trinity burned in his
[13:05] heart and he loved the third person of
[13:07] the trinity
[13:08] brother branham's teaching that the
[13:10] promised land typed the millennium
[13:13] brother brandon's statement that the
[13:14] human body is made up of 80 percent
[13:16] water and petroleum
[13:18] brother branham's statement that christ
[13:20] died a sinner
[13:22] brother random statement that elisha was
[13:24] on mount transfiguration
[13:27] brother random statement that rebecca
[13:29] met her bride
[13:31] brother random statement that the
[13:32] rapture was in second thessalonians
[13:34] chapter four but there is no second
[13:36] thessalonians chapter four
[13:39] and lastly brother random statement that
[13:40] jesus never said to go and teach the
[13:42] gospel
[13:44] but yet jesus said that in matthew 28
[13:46] verse 19.
[13:48] friends i have and i will continue to
[13:50] pray for those who are either willingly
[13:53] or ignorantly exalting the tapes of
[13:56] brother branham
[13:57] sometimes it's very frustrating for me
[14:00] because i'll interact with these kind of
[14:02] people
[14:03] online or in letters
[14:05] and they will not directly answer my
[14:07] simple questions
[14:09] and they'll often call me names and
[14:12] speak evil words but i recognize that's
[14:14] just the evil spirit that's upon him and
[14:16] i know i must love my enemies and bless
[14:18] them who persecute me as the lord jesus
[14:20] christ commanded
[14:22] now we'll move on to the next section
[14:24] and we will do what the bible and
[14:26] brother branham said we will see that
[14:28] the doctrine of interracial marriage
[14:30] runs in continuity from genesis to
[14:33] revelation
[14:35] bible doctrine about interracial
[14:37] marriage
[14:39] the exact words interracial marriage are
[14:42] not in the king james version bible
[14:44] the word race is used four times in the
[14:46] king james
[14:47] but it's not used for any ethnic group
[14:50] it's a word used only for running
[14:52] competitions
[14:53] instead the word nations is used such as
[14:56] in the case of deuteronomy 7 1-6 and
[14:59] joshua 23 12-13
[15:02] and you will find god forbid the jews to
[15:05] marry among different nations because of
[15:07] their idolatry
[15:09] and the fact that their unbelieving
[15:10] spouse would turn them away from
[15:12] following jehovah the one true god
[15:15] notice specifically in these verses from
[15:17] deuteronomy 7 and joshua 23
[15:20] these nations were also middle eastern
[15:22] nations
[15:23] meaning they had the same similar
[15:25] physical features as the israelites
[15:28] yet god still forbid their marriages
[15:31] this means god's focus was on the
[15:32] spiritual differences and not the
[15:35] physical differences
[15:37] some message people say you can only
[15:39] marry someone who looks like you but god
[15:41] said don't marry the neighboring nations
[15:43] that look like you due to spiritual
[15:45] reasons not physical reasons
[15:48] the bible is clear that there are only
[15:50] three requirements for marriage
[15:52] and recall that jesus christ is the same
[15:54] yesterday today and forever
[15:56] first
[15:57] for both the old testament and new
[15:58] testament believer they had to marry a
[16:01] believer not an unbeliever
[16:04] for the new testament believer this is
[16:05] found in first corinthians 7
[16:07] 39
[16:08] and for the old testament believer
[16:10] that's found in deuteronomy 7 1-6
[16:13] and again joshua 23 verses 12 and 13.
[16:17] also here's a quote from brother branham
[16:19] where he said no believer should ever
[16:21] marry an unbeliever under no
[16:23] circumstances
[16:24] should always marry believers and of
[16:26] course this lines up with the scripture
[16:28] let's listen to the quote
[16:30] and then it
[16:35] among is own people
[16:38] he went over and married a sinner
[16:41] an idolater
[16:43] worship of idols
[16:45] he married jezebel
[16:48] and she was not a believer
[16:52] and no believer should ever marry an
[16:56] unbeliever under no circumstances
[16:59] should always marry believers
[17:05] the second requirement for the new
[17:07] testament believer is the believer can
[17:09] have no living spouse or else it's
[17:11] adultery
[17:13] according to matthew 5 32
[17:15] now in the old testament it was
[17:17] different israel could have divorces and
[17:20] remarry even if they had a living spouse
[17:23] and jesus said that was because of the
[17:24] hardness of their hearts
[17:26] so the second requirement is different
[17:28] it only applies to us the new testament
[17:30] believers
[17:32] the third requirement applies both to
[17:34] old and new testament believers
[17:37] is the requirement for an honest vow
[17:40] which in the new testament means
[17:41] confessing any previous fornication
[17:43] before marriage
[17:45] as seen in matthew 5 32 and matthew 19
[17:48] verse 9.
[17:50] in the old testament they also had to
[17:52] have a honest vow according to numbers
[17:54] chapter 30 verses 1 through 16.
[17:58] marriage within different nations or
[18:00] interracial marriage was possible
[18:03] in the old testament when the gentile
[18:05] spouse became a jew as a proselyte or
[18:08] through spiritual conversion
[18:10] we can see that god had plans for
[18:12] gentiles to come into the abrahamic
[18:14] covenant in genesis 17 verses 12 and 27
[18:19] all the male gentiles had to be
[18:21] circumcised like the jews in order to
[18:24] come into the covenant
[18:26] and then numbers 19 verse 10
[18:28] says any sojourner or stranger which
[18:31] would be a gentile that would come among
[18:33] the jews would have to be sprinkled with
[18:35] the waters of separation in order to be
[18:37] a worshiper
[18:39] so this spiritual conversion
[18:41] is called spiritual admission by brother
[18:43] branham in the church age book on page
[18:45] 227
[18:46] he said ruth came in to the tribes of
[18:49] israel through spiritual admission
[18:52] it's noteworthy that the number of
[18:54] gentiles among the jews had increased
[18:57] from the days of abraham to solomon
[19:00] to the amount of 153
[19:03] 600 and that's according to second
[19:05] chronicles 2 verse 17.
[19:09] now let's look at five examples of godly
[19:11] marriages between different nations or
[19:14] nationalities
[19:16] and we could say these are five examples
[19:17] of interracial marriages amongst
[19:19] believers in the old testament
[19:22] and remember jesus christ is the same
[19:24] yesterday today and forever
[19:27] the first example is joseph and azenath
[19:30] from genesis 41 verse 45
[19:33] joseph married a gentile and so his
[19:35] children were a half jew half gentile as
[19:38] brother branham said in the first seal
[19:41] so friends was this wrong for joseph to
[19:43] marry azenath or did god ordain this
[19:45] marriage
[19:46] it seems god ordained this marriage
[19:48] because joseph told his brothers you did
[19:50] not send me here to egypt god sent me
[19:52] here
[19:53] and as further proof god bless joseph's
[19:55] two sons put them among the 12 tribes of
[19:58] israel
[19:59] and then we learn in revelation 4 verse
[20:01] 4 that these two sons
[20:03] have two of the 24 seats that surround
[20:06] the throne of the lord jesus christ
[20:09] the second example is moses and zipporah
[20:12] moses of course was a hebrew and
[20:14] zipporah was an ethiopian
[20:17] in the hebrew lexicon ethiopian means
[20:19] from cush
[20:20] which is the southernmost people's
[20:22] located in africa
[20:24] it's the descendants of cush located
[20:26] around the southern parts of the nile
[20:29] near ethiopia
[20:31] numbers 12 verse 1 and 8
[20:34] say that mirim and aaron spake against
[20:36] moses because of the ethiopian woman
[20:39] whom he had married
[20:40] and of course if you know the story god
[20:42] did not like miriam and aaron speaking
[20:45] against moses
[20:46] and god said wherefore then were you not
[20:49] afraid to speak against my servant moses
[20:51] notice they were speaking against god's
[20:53] servant and his marriage to an ethiopian
[20:57] so i encourage everyone not to speak
[20:58] against a godly marriage that might be
[21:01] interracial because you'd be committing
[21:03] the same heir that miriam and aaron made
[21:07] and as you'll see later brother branham
[21:08] called zipporah a black woman
[21:11] said she was the only one that saved
[21:12] moses life and that god chose zipporah
[21:16] to be moses's wife
[21:18] therefore god chose believers from two
[21:20] different races to marry and he blessed
[21:23] their union
[21:25] the third example is rahab and salmon
[21:28] from the time of joshua
[21:30] both exodus 32 verses 11 12 and verses
[21:34] 16 and 17
[21:36] and deuteronomy 7 1-6
[21:38] specifically forbid marriage to a
[21:41] canaanite yet salmon married rahab who
[21:44] was a canaanite
[21:46] this was possible and acceptable to god
[21:48] because rahab became a believer in
[21:50] israel's god jehovah as proven by
[21:53] hebrews 11
[21:55] 31
[21:56] so this leads us to understand that
[21:58] god's prohibition against interracial
[22:00] marriage was only due to spiritual
[22:03] differences
[22:04] and if someone of a different race
[22:06] converted or became a proselyte to
[22:08] judaism then the jew could marry that
[22:10] person from a different nation
[22:12] and then god would allow interracial
[22:14] marriage
[22:16] and of course the proof of god's
[22:17] blessing upon this interracial marriage
[22:19] was that rahab
[22:21] brought forth boaz who married ruth and
[22:23] they brought forth obed and then jesse
[22:26] and then david on down until jesus
[22:28] christ came out of their lineage
[22:31] a fourth example is boaz and ruth from
[22:34] the time of the judges
[22:36] notice deuteronomy 22 verses 3 through 6
[22:39] says no moabite could enter into the
[22:42] congregation of the lord
[22:45] now friends are we to believe ruth could
[22:47] not enter into the congregation of the
[22:49] lord into the outer courts of the
[22:51] tabernacle of the lord
[22:53] or is it most likely ruth was allowed to
[22:56] worship jehovah through her conversion
[22:59] and through the waters of separation
[23:01] since out of her loins become david and
[23:03] eventually the messiah jesus christ
[23:06] recall matthew 1 verse 5
[23:09] as both rahab and ruth
[23:11] are listed in matthew's genealogy of the
[23:13] lord jesus christ
[23:15] so god was not ashamed to put a
[23:17] canaanite and a moabite in the lineage
[23:19] of the messiah so this leads me to
[23:22] believe that god would allow a moabite
[23:24] to come into the congregation of the
[23:25] lord if they converted if they repented
[23:28] their sins and became a true follower of
[23:30] jehovah god
[23:32] so again remember the birth order rahab
[23:34] and salmon brought forth boaz
[23:37] boaz married mamobite ruth
[23:40] and they brought forth obed then jesse
[23:42] then david on down to the messiah jesus
[23:45] christ
[23:46] the fifth example is uriah the hittite
[23:49] and bathsheba
[23:51] both deuteronomy 7 verse 3 and exodus 34
[23:55] 11-17 forbid marriage to hittites yet
[23:59] bathsheba married uriah the hittite and
[24:02] he proved to be a mighty man in david's
[24:04] army with a great zeal for israel's god
[24:07] and israel's army
[24:10] this marriage could have only been
[24:11] possible through uriah's conversion to
[24:13] judaism
[24:15] now i want to look at an example from
[24:17] the new testament that shows god can
[24:19] save and fill a believer who is the
[24:22] result of an interracial marriage and
[24:24] the example is timothy
[24:27] according to philippians 2 verses 19
[24:30] through 22 paul knew no one who had
[24:33] natural care for the philippian state
[24:35] like paul had
[24:37] paul said that timothy was as a son with
[24:40] the father with him
[24:42] so paul was like a father of the faith
[24:44] and timothy was like his son in the
[24:45] gospel
[24:46] paul plainly says no man was more
[24:49] like-minded to him than timothy
[24:52] so no one was more like the prophet of
[24:53] god than timothy
[24:56] according to acts 16 1-3
[24:59] timothy was the offspring of a greek and
[25:02] jew
[25:03] timothy's dad was greek timothy's mother
[25:06] was jew
[25:07] so he was half jew half greek
[25:09] so this example again proves
[25:12] children who come from a mixed marriage
[25:13] are no different than any other children
[25:15] they can still be saved sanctified
[25:18] filled with the holy ghost they can be
[25:20] extremely spiritual they can be very
[25:22] like-minded compared to the prophet of
[25:24] god
[25:25] they can have the same faith and have
[25:27] the same mind as the prophet of god
[25:29] it's a mind that loves the lord jesus
[25:31] christ
[25:33] i want to look at five other important
[25:35] verses the first one is acts 17 verse 26
[25:39] the bible said god made of one blood all
[25:42] nations of men for to dwell on all the
[25:45] face of the earth
[25:46] so we're taught by the bible there's one
[25:48] blood of people upon the earth which
[25:50] proves interracial marriages are not
[25:53] hybrid in the sense of mixing different
[25:55] seeds
[25:56] for all human blood is the same blood
[25:58] and all human seed is the same seed
[26:00] because interracial couples can
[26:02] reproduce and have more children
[26:05] second the new testament king james
[26:07] version bible puts no difference between
[26:10] races
[26:11] as there's no difference between the jew
[26:12] and the gentile and we are all abraham's
[26:15] spiritual seed
[26:17] that's according to romans 10
[26:19] verses 12 and 13 and galatians 3 verses
[26:22] 26 through 29
[26:25] what matters now is that we are a
[26:26] spiritual nation
[26:28] that's according to first peter 2 verse
[26:30] 9
[26:31] which says but ye are chosen generation
[26:33] a royal priesthood and holy nation
[26:37] third according to romans 2 verse 16
[26:40] god will judge the secrets of all men's
[26:42] hearts by jesus christ according to
[26:44] paul's gospels
[26:46] notice we won't be judged by every word
[26:48] on brother branham's tapes
[26:50] especially since brother ram said there
[26:51] were mix up on the tapes
[26:54] since paul never commanded a ban on
[26:56] interracial marriages then there is no
[26:58] ban on interracial marriages
[27:00] and since paul's gospel cannot be
[27:02] changed it cannot be added to or taken
[27:04] away as brother random said and as
[27:06] brother ram quoted in galatians chapter
[27:08] 1 verses 6 through 12
[27:10] we cannot add a ban on interracial
[27:12] marriage to the new testament
[27:15] remember the church age book chapter
[27:16] three
[27:17] brother brahm said one of these days
[27:19] there's going to come a prophet to the
[27:20] later scene church age and you will know
[27:22] if he's the real one sent from god or
[27:24] not yes you will
[27:26] for if he is of god he will be in that
[27:28] word exactly as god gave it to paul he
[27:31] won't deviate from that word for a
[27:33] moment not by one iota
[27:36] then brother ram said get back to the
[27:38] word or you are lost
[27:40] he won't build on a private revelation
[27:42] or interpretation but on the word
[27:46] so friends if you just look in the word
[27:47] of god if you look at paul's gospels
[27:49] even you'll never see a ban on
[27:51] interracial marriage
[27:53] you only see bans against marrying an
[27:55] unbeliever
[27:56] you see a ban against marrying a second
[27:58] spouse when you already have a living
[28:00] spouse
[28:01] and you see a ban against dishonest vows
[28:04] but you never see a ban against
[28:06] interracial marriages in the old
[28:07] testament or the new testament as long
[28:10] as both believers were just that
[28:12] believers
[28:14] before scripture is that i can only find
[28:16] one mention of skin color in the bible
[28:19] and that's in song of solomon now there
[28:21] could be more and if i'm not aware of
[28:23] them let me know
[28:24] it's in song of psalm 1 verses 5 and 6.
[28:28] of course this is the shulamite who was
[28:30] courted and then engaged and then
[28:32] married to solomon
[28:34] in verse 5 she said i am black but
[28:36] calmly verse 6 says look not upon me
[28:39] because i am black and she tells the
[28:41] reason why her skin was darker it was
[28:44] because her family forced her to work
[28:46] outside in the hot skin tanning sun
[28:50] so we know from the context that royalty
[28:52] probably didn't work outside they were
[28:54] so rich and more powerful so they never
[28:55] had to work outside in the hot sun so
[28:58] their skin would be lighter toned than
[29:00] just the common people or the laborers
[29:02] now the fact that this is the only
[29:03] mention of skin color proves again that
[29:06] god never had a ban on interracial
[29:08] marriages because of skin color
[29:10] the fifth scripture is in revelation 5
[29:13] verses 9 and 10
[29:15] and this scripture shows that despite
[29:17] the fact that there are some interracial
[29:19] marriages amongst believers god will
[29:21] still have redeemed believers from every
[29:23] kindred tongue people and nation
[29:26] now this scripture proves the majority
[29:28] of married believers will marry within
[29:30] their nations
[29:32] because that's where they live and
[29:33] remain
[29:34] and it's more likely they're going to
[29:35] marry someone that they have interaction
[29:37] with in their own nation but not all
[29:40] believers are required to marry within
[29:43] their own nation because there's no
[29:45] scriptural command against interracial
[29:47] marriage from the lord jesus christ
[29:50] revelation 5 verse 9 says and they sung
[29:52] a new song saying thou art worthy to
[29:54] take the book and to open the seals
[29:56] thereof for thou was slain and has
[29:58] redeemed us to god by thy blood out of
[30:00] every kindred and tongue and people and
[30:03] nation and hast made us unto our god
[30:05] kings and priests and we shall reign on
[30:07] the earth
[30:09] as we close this section remember
[30:11] brother ram said he preached what paul
[30:13] preached and we were resting on that
[30:16] so friends we cannot rest on brother
[30:18] rams humans opinions we must rest upon
[30:20] the bible because the bibles are
[30:22] absolute
[30:23] and the bible is our one and only
[30:25] absolute
[30:26] there is only one absolute
[30:28] and the holy ghost will only point you
[30:30] to the word of god
[30:32] so our conclusion is if we do what
[30:34] brother branham and the bible taught us
[30:35] to do prove all things by the scripture
[30:38] we come to the conclusion that there are
[30:40] times when god chooses to put couples
[30:42] together from different nations or
[30:44] different races
[30:46] and i want to ask this question what if
[30:48] you never heard brother branham preach
[30:50] against interracial marriages
[30:52] and you knew only the bible teaching
[30:54] about interracial marriage
[30:55] what conclusion would you come to
[30:58] it's likely you come to the same
[30:59] conclusion that i just presented
[31:02] that god allows interracial marriage as
[31:04] long as between two believers as proven
[31:07] by the scriptures
[31:09] and also there's numerous people that i
[31:11] know including myself that were not
[31:13] raising the message and while growing up
[31:15] we knew there was nothing wrong with
[31:17] interracial marriage
[31:18] it was something to be celebrated just
[31:20] like any other marriage as long as the
[31:22] couple were genuine believers in jesus
[31:24] christ
[31:26] before we came to the message all we
[31:27] knew was the bible and we knew the bible
[31:29] taught that interracial marriage was
[31:31] acceptable like in the case of moses and
[31:33] zipporah
[31:34] so i hope you consider that perspective
[31:36] and i hope it helps you out by god's
[31:38] grace
[31:40] positive things brother brahms said
[31:41] about moses and zipporah
[31:44] so now we'll listen to five quotes from
[31:46] brother branham about moses and zipporah
[31:48] and it will show how god placed him
[31:50] together and remember friends according
[31:52] to hebrews 13 verse 8 jesus christ is
[31:55] the same yesterday today and forever god
[31:57] will always bless interracial marriages
[31:59] as long as he leads them together and of
[32:01] course that applies to any marriage
[32:03] whether interracial or not
[32:06] in this first quote brother ram said
[32:08] zappora was the only one that saved
[32:09] moses
[32:10] physical life
[32:12] so consider that god chose zipporah an
[32:14] ethiopian because he knew she would save
[32:17] his life let's listen to the quote
[32:20] the questioner asked
[32:22] does this scripture mean that god aimed
[32:25] to kill moses are his son
[32:28] and why
[32:30] god was after moses
[32:32] and support was the only one that saved
[32:35] him there
[32:36] for
[32:37] sephora got a sharp rock
[32:40] and went and cut the foreskin over her
[32:42] baby and threw it before moses and said
[32:45] a bloody husband to me
[32:47] is that right
[32:49] and god would have talked his life
[32:53] but perhaps an angel was standing in her
[32:54] there
[32:56] catch it quickly
[32:57] see
[32:58] as the fourth one circumcised the baby
[33:00] said moses
[33:03] you're so concerned about everything
[33:05] else about your journey but your own boy
[33:07] hasn't been circumcised
[33:11] next brother ram said it was wrong for
[33:13] aaron and miriam to make fun of moses
[33:15] for marrying an ethiopian
[33:17] now in this quote friends brother
[33:19] branham will use the terminology colored
[33:21] girl now of course that's not
[33:23] politically correct today so i apologize
[33:25] if that offends anybody but that
[33:27] terminology was acceptable during
[33:28] brother graham's lifetime let's listen
[33:30] to the quote
[33:33] was made fun of my sister and his
[33:35] brother one time because he married a
[33:37] colored girl ethiopian girl it didn't
[33:39] make fun and god happened to be present
[33:42] and heard it was that right
[33:44] he just was present and heard it that's
[33:46] right and when he did he said bring him
[33:48] in here he said don't you fear god
[33:51] [Applause]
[33:56] the next quote brother bram said moses
[33:58] married a negro girl and again i'm sorry
[34:00] if the word negro offends anyone
[34:03] i know it's not politically correct but
[34:05] it's on tape and this was the language
[34:07] people used during brother graham's
[34:08] lifetime
[34:09] but again this shows brother branham
[34:11] said moses married a black woman
[34:13] let's listen to the
[34:19] when she quote because moses married
[34:21] this negro girl and said both of the
[34:23] other girls to be married and so forth
[34:25] he had done it and god wasn't pleased
[34:28] with that and smaller with an adversary
[34:32] in the next quote 1961 brother ram said
[34:35] god chose zipporah for moses
[34:39] and that god demands respects for his
[34:41] servants of course he talks about how
[34:43] aaron and miriam disrespected moses due
[34:46] to his marriage
[34:47] so may god help us all to respect the
[34:49] marriages that god brings together
[34:51] whether interracial or not
[34:53] let's listen to the quote
[34:56] and there one day we find out
[34:58] that even miriam a
[35:01] and aaron the high priest
[35:04] made fun of moses wife
[35:08] because she was an ethiopian
[35:10] i thought wasn't enough women of our own
[35:13] group to marry instead of going down
[35:15] there and marrying that woman
[35:17] that wasn't moses choice that was god's
[35:19] choice for moses
[35:22] and when they made fun of it that
[35:24] angered god in such a way
[35:28] until he struck miriam the prophecies
[35:30] full of leprosy moses own sister
[35:34] what about that
[35:36] her of confidence
[35:38] but what was she doing
[35:40] she was making fun and an irreverence to
[35:43] god's messenger
[35:46] the messenger of the covenant of that
[35:48] name
[35:51] in this last quote it doesn't mention
[35:52] moses and zipporah but brother and does
[35:55] say god breeds people together how he
[35:57] wants them
[35:58] so if god had foreknowledge about moses
[36:00] and zipporah god determined who their
[36:03] grandparents and parents would marry
[36:05] and then brought moses and the poor
[36:06] together to be married and have children
[36:09] according to the plan of god
[36:10] god wanted a certain testimony for moses
[36:13] and zipporah
[36:14] and so god does the same today god has
[36:16] certain testimonies for certain people
[36:18] and god can allow interracial marriages
[36:20] today for a specific testimony let's
[36:23] listen to the quote
[36:25] and in the millennium there's elohim
[36:26] sitting on the throne
[36:29] that's right with all his subjects
[36:30] around him
[36:32] and he predestinated before the
[36:33] foundation were like a man building
[36:35] chimes or making chimes the motor each
[36:37] bell's got to ring different from the
[36:38] other the same materials but so much
[36:40] iron so much uh steel so much brass to
[36:44] make it give the tang that's what god
[36:46] did he bred this one to that one to this
[36:48] one to that one to this one to that one
[36:49] till he got exactly what he wanted
[36:51] that's how it come down god will unveil
[36:53] himself in a pillar far down through the
[36:56] prophets and into the son of god which
[36:57] he was god
[36:59] it's the same god bringing out exactly
[37:01] from perfection to perfection from glory
[37:04] unto glory that's where the church goes
[37:09] negative things brother branham said
[37:11] about interracial marriage and the
[37:13] cultural context he lived in
[37:16] some wonder why brother brown was so
[37:18] strongly against interracial marriage
[37:20] and in my opinion it seems there were
[37:22] two factors
[37:23] first it was illegal in the united
[37:26] states until 1967
[37:28] and history shows interracial couples
[37:30] could be arrested for being married
[37:33] and the second reason is the civil
[37:34] rights era from the 1940s to 1960s was
[37:38] often a violent hateful and tumultuous
[37:41] time to live in for some people
[37:43] i want to briefly look at the cultural
[37:45] context brother branham lived in and i'm
[37:47] going to reference an article from the
[37:49] history channel's website before reading
[37:52] some of these examples i want to let
[37:53] listeners know if you have children you
[37:55] may want them to step out of the room
[37:57] because some of these events from
[37:58] history are very violent and sad and
[38:00] graphic
[38:02] so in 1954
[38:04] brown versus the board of education
[38:06] ended racial segregation in schools yet
[38:09] many schools remain segregated
[38:12] in 1955 an awful thing happened a black
[38:16] 14 year old was brutally murdered for
[38:18] allegedly flirting with the white woman
[38:21] and this brought international attention
[38:24] to the civil rights movement
[38:26] in 1955 rosa parks refused to give up
[38:29] her seat to a white man on a montgomery
[38:32] alabama bus
[38:33] that started a year-long bus boycott
[38:37] in 1957 president dwight eisenhower had
[38:40] to send federal troops to escort
[38:43] students into the little rock central
[38:45] high school
[38:46] in little rock arkansas
[38:49] also in 1957 president eisenhower signed
[38:52] the civil rights act of 1957 to help
[38:55] protect voter rights
[38:58] in 1960 sit-ins became popular as a
[39:02] non-violent form of protest
[39:05] in 1963 president jfk had to send in the
[39:09] national guard to the campus of the
[39:11] university of alabama to allow two black
[39:14] students
[39:15] to enter and register
[39:18] august 1963 was when martin luther king
[39:21] jr gave his i have a dream speech in
[39:24] front of the lincoln memorial in
[39:25] washington d.c
[39:27] sadly in september 63 a bomb
[39:30] at the 16th street baptist church in
[39:32] birmington alabama killed four young
[39:35] girls and injured several others
[39:38] this bombing fueled angry protests
[39:42] 1964 president johnson signed the civil
[39:45] rights act preventing employment
[39:47] discrimination due to race color sex
[39:49] religion or national origin
[39:52] in march 1965
[39:55] bloody sunday took place
[39:57] when 600 civil rights marchers walked to
[40:00] selma alabama to montgomery in order to
[40:03] protest black voter suppression
[40:06] local police blocked and brutally
[40:09] attacked these marchers
[40:12] in 1968 martin luther king jr was
[40:14] assassinated on the balcony of his hotel
[40:16] room in memphis tennessee
[40:19] i want to reference a second article
[40:21] this article is from the life magazine
[40:24] 1963 which message believers will be
[40:26] very familiar with because of the
[40:28] because of the supernatural cloud from
[40:30] february 28 1963
[40:33] in the magazine it seems there's a very
[40:35] biased article
[40:36] as the article makes blacks out to be a
[40:39] very hateful and aggressive group now of
[40:43] course we know this certainly was not
[40:44] the case
[40:45] because many of the protesters simply
[40:47] wanted justice for some of the murders
[40:49] that we mentioned earlier and of course
[40:51] there were numerous others
[40:52] many of the blacks just wanted equal
[40:54] treatment in the military when eating in
[40:56] public attending the same schools etc
[41:00] friends these are some of the saddest
[41:01] pictures i've seen
[41:03] it pains all of our hearts to see blacks
[41:05] so mistreated and again the reason i'm
[41:07] showing this is so you can understand
[41:08] the context in which brother ram lived
[41:11] and preached he saw so much violence and
[41:13] hatred and he knew the hatred and
[41:16] violence was inspired of the devil so he
[41:18] encouraged believers to marry within
[41:20] their own nationalities
[41:22] which was also a legal requirement at
[41:24] that time as well
[41:27] now we'll listen to portions of quotes
[41:29] from god's prophet brother branham
[41:31] again you'll hear brother branham call
[41:33] black people colored or negros
[41:35] and i'm sorry if that is offensive to
[41:37] anybody please know this language was
[41:39] commonly used in the civil rights era
[41:41] but is not politically correct language
[41:43] today
[41:45] you will hear brother branham say some
[41:46] very serious and harsh words about
[41:48] interracial marriage
[41:50] some of the serious words are
[41:52] when he says it's wrong
[41:53] which is true in one sense because it
[41:55] was illegal
[41:56] and he'll say it's not right which was
[41:59] technically true in the legal aspect of
[42:01] it but again these statements don't seem
[42:03] to agree with the scriptures
[42:05] also you're going to hear brother ram
[42:06] say some harsh words like he called
[42:08] interracial marriage horrible
[42:10] and he called it hybriding and he said
[42:13] it's ruining the race of people
[42:15] and it's against nature
[42:17] and it's one kind of evil going on in
[42:19] the world today
[42:21] i believe it's likely brother bran was
[42:23] so harsh against interracial marriage
[42:25] due to the violence he witnessed in both
[42:27] america and in africa that he talked
[42:29] about
[42:30] and he would read about the violence in
[42:31] newspapers as well
[42:33] this violence made brother branham speak
[42:36] harsh things against martin luther king
[42:37] jr and brother brandon thought he would
[42:39] lead millions into a hitler-like death
[42:42] trap because he thought it looked like a
[42:44] communist style takeover of the united
[42:46] states government
[42:48] but remember brother ram said he could
[42:49] be altogether wrong about martin luther
[42:51] king jr and had nothing on it from the
[42:53] lord
[42:54] i do want to play one quote from
[42:56] questions and answers 1964 where brother
[42:58] brandon made a great observation he
[43:01] noted how communists from the past and
[43:03] even fascists like hitler used racial
[43:06] wars or racial hatred in order to take
[43:09] over political power
[43:11] we can even see that today in the united
[43:12] states
[43:14] where one party the democratic party
[43:16] often uses attacks of racism
[43:19] against the republican party
[43:21] and so we see how government leaders use
[43:23] racism
[43:24] as a way to take more power from the
[43:26] people or keep power
[43:28] whenever there's a crisis
[43:30] or a tragedy
[43:32] sinful government leaders will use that
[43:34] crisis in order to grab more power
[43:36] so let's listen to the
[43:38] is it i'll quote
[43:40] you that it's communism and not them
[43:42] colored people
[43:44] that's how communism has always come in
[43:46] to take over they do that in every
[43:47] nation
[43:49] that's how they do it getting you
[43:50] fighting amongst one another revolution
[43:52] then they take can without a shop
[43:54] they don't want to blow this country up
[43:55] they want it
[43:56] they can warm wheat it in and now they
[43:58] see the case appearing out and know what
[44:00] the old revolution was and thought they
[44:01] started another revolution to prove my
[44:03] porn is clear after they have
[44:06] integration they have it now
[44:08] legally lawfully they're causing more
[44:10] trouble now than in the first place
[44:13] see it shows that it is communism and
[44:16] not them precious souls that's born of
[44:19] the spirit of god
[44:22] now we'll listen to numerous quotes from
[44:24] brother branham about interracial
[44:25] marriage how he's against it but pay
[44:28] attention to the amount of bible verses
[44:30] or bible references or bible quotes that
[44:32] he uses
[44:34] you'll hear there are very little
[44:35] scriptures referenced
[44:37] and this proves brother ram's stance
[44:39] against interracial marriage was most
[44:41] likely his opinion
[44:43] especially considering the five examples
[44:45] from interracial marriage in the old
[44:46] testament and also timothy's holy
[44:49] devotion to the prophet of god paul as a
[44:52] child of a mixed marriage
[44:54] in the first quote from condemnation by
[44:56] representation 1960
[44:58] brother branham calls interracial
[45:00] marriage terrible and not right
[45:02] now again i would ask
[45:04] was it terrible that god allowed moses
[45:07] and zipporah to marry
[45:08] did god do a terrible thing when he let
[45:11] moses and zappora marry
[45:13] of course the answer is no
[45:15] brother branham also calls this
[45:16] interbreeding and asked how can the
[45:19] world go on much longer so it seems
[45:21] brother ran was burdened by all the
[45:23] racism and violence surrounding the
[45:25] civil rights movement let's listen to
[45:27] the quote
[45:37] [Music]
[45:41] i got hundreds of precious colored
[45:43] friends
[45:44] this born again christians
[45:46] but on this line of segregations and
[45:48] things we're talking about
[45:50] hybriding the people
[45:52] what tell me what fine
[45:55] custard
[45:56] fine christian colored woman want her
[45:59] baby to be on my ladder by white man
[46:06] what white woman would want her baby to
[46:08] be in my ladder
[46:10] by a colored man
[46:12] god means what
[46:17] i believe it's right
[46:21] what are we doing friends men think they
[46:23] know all about it
[46:25] but people would be a better off you
[46:26] just let them away there away god made
[46:28] them
[46:30] let the brown race marry the brown race
[46:33] the white race mirror the white race the
[46:34] dark race the yellow race and whatever
[46:36] more stay the way god made them
[46:39] if a vile god made it it was white let
[46:41] it remain white if it's
[46:43] blue black brown whatever the flower is
[46:45] let it alone
[46:47] if corn was raised a certain way yellow
[46:49] corn don't mix with white corn if you do
[46:50] you mix it up then it can't bring itself
[46:52] back again
[46:54] if a mew was or jack was a jack the
[46:56] jelly to begin with let him stay that
[46:58] way don't mention with horses you make a
[47:00] renegade
[47:03] hybrid
[47:04] oh it's such a curse
[47:07] go back to where god started
[47:09] let's go back to the beginning
[47:11] amen go back to where god
[47:14] brought us what we're supposed to be
[47:18] oh this inner breed
[47:22] how can the world go on my shoulder no
[47:24] wonder the vision of the lord says here
[47:27] that i've seen it finally come to a spot
[47:29] where she's just one big smoldering heap
[47:32] she's blown up we're on the road out
[47:34] friends there's no way no way there's no
[47:36] way around it we got to come to it face
[47:38] it
[47:43] the next quote is from 1961 here brother
[47:46] ram said racial disintegration is evil
[47:49] and he noticed all the fusses and fights
[47:51] and stews in the civil rights movement
[47:53] so i would humbly ask was it evil for
[47:55] moses and zipporah to marry of course
[47:58] the answer is no
[47:59] don't forget brother ram said god chose
[48:01] zepora from moses
[48:03] so god could not make an evil choice
[48:05] let's listen to the quote
[48:08] so when he began to read in the book and
[48:10] see that the time was drawing night at
[48:12] full faith
[48:16] [Applause]
[48:20] what are we doing
[48:22] when nations are praying
[48:26] let's see a lord
[48:28] man's heart failing for fear
[48:31] perplexed of time
[48:34] all
[48:35] these things are handwriting on the wall
[48:41] racial disintegration
[48:43] all kinds of evil going on in the world
[48:54] [Applause]
[48:56] that one little nation for the size of
[48:59] cuba down here can destroy the world in
[49:01] 10 minutes
[49:05] here in 1962 we'll again listen to the
[49:07] quote from life preached in salem oregon
[49:10] brother ram said you ought to leave it
[49:12] the way god had it he's a god of variety
[49:14] notice again no scripture and no thus
[49:17] saith the lord statement
[49:19] let's listen to the quote
[49:21] i'm a southerner
[49:23] the big boss up here says this nation
[49:25] what they say is all right i think in
[49:28] the
[49:28] segregation condition
[49:31] of the sound some of them said to me one
[49:33] time said brother brandon being a
[49:34] southerner what do you think about
[49:36] segregation i said it's not for me to
[49:38] say
[49:39] the boss
[49:41] government said let it be what it is
[49:43] permit them to marry and so forth i said
[49:47] that's that's up to them as an american
[49:49] i i abide by the laws
[49:51] to me
[49:53] or to leave it the way god had it he
[49:54] made a white man black man brown man
[49:57] he's a god of variety let him stay the
[49:58] way god made them that's what i think if
[50:01] i was a black man i want to i want to
[50:02] stay in my class of people
[50:05] uh chinese yellow i i won't stay that
[50:08] way then i'm anglo-saxon white let me
[50:11] marry amongst the white teach my
[50:12] children the same and this day they're
[50:14] kind of a flower and a color that god
[50:16] made us at the beginning after all he's
[50:17] the one that made it
[50:20] here in 1963 brother branham said we
[50:23] should never cross that up
[50:25] he said interracial marriages makes
[50:27] hybrid he says you're ruining the race
[50:29] of people
[50:30] now of course this is brother brown's
[50:31] opinion
[50:32] and we have to take that statement back
[50:34] to the bible and ask ourselves did moses
[50:37] ruin his race by marrying zipporah of
[50:40] course the answer is no
[50:41] let's listen to the quote
[50:44] i believe god is a god
[50:48] of
[50:50] well i'd say he's a god of variety
[50:53] he makes big mountains and little
[50:54] mountains
[50:56] he makes deserts he makes forest
[50:58] he makes white man black man red man we
[51:01] should never cross that up
[51:03] it becomes a hybrid and any hybrid
[51:06] cannot rebreed itself
[51:09] you're ruining the race of people
[51:14] here's another quote from 1963 brother
[51:16] bam says you get against nature if you
[51:18] interbreed
[51:19] he said don't cross them up
[51:21] so again if we take that back to the
[51:22] scripture
[51:24] did god go against himself when he put
[51:26] moses and zappora together
[51:28] did god interbreed and did god cross up
[51:31] moses and zipporah in order to get
[51:32] gershom and his brother
[51:34] i believe the answer is no
[51:36] let's listen to the quote
[51:38] but this man if i can only speak to him
[51:41] leading those precious people under the
[51:44] name of religion
[51:46] into a death trap where he's going to
[51:48] kill him thousands times thousands of
[51:50] them
[51:53] they don't they just get the
[51:54] natural sign
[51:58] this man
[52:00] the colored brother
[52:02] when that great uprise come in louisiana
[52:05] i was there at the time
[52:08] when the there's a colored minister
[52:10] precious old brother stood up out there
[52:12] and said uh asked the militia could i
[52:14] speak to they're my
[52:16] people and this old minister stood up
[52:18] right there said i
[52:20] want to say this morning i never was
[52:22] ashamed of my color
[52:24] my maker made me what i am
[52:28] that's what he wants if you remain
[52:31] that's what he wants every man to remain
[52:33] he makes white flowers and blue flowers
[52:35] and all colors of flowers don't
[52:37] interbreed them
[52:38] don't cross them up
[52:40] you get against nature
[52:44] in 1964 brother ram said i don't believe
[52:47] in it
[52:48] but again notice there's no scriptural
[52:49] reference there's no thus saith the lord
[52:52] he said i believe you should just stay
[52:54] what we are
[52:55] i don't believe in mixing marriages
[52:58] well that makes me ask should moses and
[53:00] zipporah remained unmarried should they
[53:03] have stayed just the way they were or
[53:05] did god want them to be married
[53:07] of course the answer is god wanted them
[53:08] to be married
[53:10] was it a mistake moses and zipporah were
[53:12] married or did god choose zipporah for
[53:15] moses as brother ram said in another
[53:17] quote
[53:18] the answer is it was not a mistake
[53:20] let's listen to the quote
[53:22] now i don't believe in mixing marriages
[53:25] i believe that a white man should not
[53:27] marry a colored girl or a colored girl
[53:29] marry a white man or a yellow marry a
[53:31] colored or a white or i believe the
[53:33] brown black white and races of people
[53:35] are like a flower garden of god and i do
[53:38] not believe they should be crossed up i
[53:40] believe that's the way god made them and
[53:42] i believe that's the way they should
[53:43] remain what it fools me and i've seen
[53:46] some real pretty colored girl
[53:48] intelligent nice looking kid just as
[53:51] pretty as any woman you want to see what
[53:52] does she want to marry a white man and
[53:54] have milan children what would an
[53:56] intelligent color girl want was such a
[53:58] thing as that
[53:59] it because that something a communist
[54:02] how would a a fine uh uh a colored man
[54:06] want to marry a white woman and have a
[54:09] lot of children i don't believe i
[54:11] believe you should stay just what we are
[54:13] but we we're servants of christ and god
[54:16] made me if he made me my color black i'd
[54:19] be happy to be a black man for god if he
[54:21] made me yellow i'll be a happy yellow
[54:24] man for christ if he made me uh white i
[54:27] will have a white man for christ if he
[54:29] may be brown or red an indian whatever
[54:32] it is i'd stay my same color that would
[54:34] be me i want to be like my maker made me
[54:39] the final quote is from 1965 brother ram
[54:41] says intermarrying was wrong
[54:45] so we must balance this quote and take
[54:46] it back to the word
[54:48] again brother adam gave no scripture and
[54:50] no thus saith the lord in this statement
[54:52] we have to ask ourselves was it wrong
[54:54] for moses to marry zipporah
[54:56] or joseph to marry azenath
[54:59] or timothy's mom to marry timothy's dad
[55:02] and of course the answer is no
[55:04] let's listen to the quote
[55:06] as uh i believe it's gestural told moses
[55:08] one time that it's just too much for you
[55:11] so we've got um plenty of brothers here
[55:14] on your problems and every one of them
[55:16] has been legitimate and there are fine
[55:19] things that has to be taken care of and
[55:21] i would recommend our pastor or brother
[55:24] man and other ministers
[55:26] of our faith here and you can go to them
[55:29] they tell you just exactly the thing to
[55:31] do some people their children
[55:33] intermarrying or things that's wrong and
[55:35] these men could help you just the same
[55:37] as as anyone else cause they're servants
[55:40] of christ and go to them and i'm sure
[55:42] they will
[55:43] they will give you the help that you
[55:44] need
[55:48] answers to questions about interracial
[55:50] marriage
[55:52] the first question is isn't moses and
[55:55] zipporah
[55:56] a type of christ and the church only and
[55:59] not an example of natural marriage
[56:02] i believe the answer to that is no
[56:04] and the reason is because we have four
[56:06] other examples from the old testament
[56:08] that i've already showed plus the
[56:10] example of timothy being half greek and
[56:12] half jew and yet being a real holy
[56:14] ghost-filled christian
[56:16] and again if you just read the bible
[56:18] without having heard brother rams
[56:19] preaching about interracial marriage
[56:22] you'd understand god had no prohibition
[56:24] against believers intermarrying within
[56:27] different nationalities
[56:29] a second question what about the
[56:31] attention that interracial marriages
[56:33] draw
[56:36] well my answer to that is
[56:37] that's just natural
[56:39] whenever someone's physically different
[56:41] or visibly different they draw attention
[56:43] from others
[56:45] and as a certainty anyone who's
[56:47] different is gonna receive extra
[56:49] attention
[56:51] moses's marriage drew attention from
[56:53] aaron and miriam but god stood with
[56:55] moses and so god will do the same for
[56:57] believers whenever they stand out just
[57:00] like when our sisters are the only women
[57:02] in the store or at a beach wearing
[57:04] modest clothes
[57:06] our sisters automatically stand out but
[57:08] god is standing with them
[57:12] the fact is most people marry within
[57:14] their own country or their own nation
[57:16] among people that look like them
[57:18] it's just simply probability that people
[57:20] will marry someone who looks a lot like
[57:22] them from their own nation
[57:24] but it's not a bible principle that
[57:26] intermarrying is wrong
[57:28] and for those people who are
[57:30] intermarried and get unwanted attention
[57:32] they have to remember that god brought
[57:34] them together
[57:35] and god will give them the perfect love
[57:37] that casts out all fear or all negative
[57:40] attention
[57:41] just like moses and zipporah if god
[57:44] helped them to overcome the criticism of
[57:46] miriam and aaron god will help today's
[57:49] couples that he leads to inner mary
[57:51] overcome the criticism that they live
[57:53] under
[57:54] i remember the words of jesus with god
[57:56] all things are possible
[57:58] you can also remember the words of paul
[58:00] i can do all things through christ who
[58:02] strengthens me
[58:03] if an interracial couple is being
[58:05] criticized then it's a opportunity for
[58:07] them to love their enemies
[58:10] and bless those who persecute them
[58:13] none of us enjoy being persecuted or
[58:15] being mistreated but it's going to
[58:17] happen in life especially as christians
[58:19] especially as we get closer to the
[58:21] coming of the lord
[58:22] right before the mark of the beast gets
[58:23] laid down
[58:24] when the beast system is going to want
[58:26] to kill all the christians who believe
[58:28] the truth of the gospel
[58:30] so may god help us all to have perfect
[58:32] love to cast out all fear
[58:35] question three are children affected
[58:38] when they are born from an interracial
[58:40] marriage
[58:42] i would say yes
[58:43] and some of the effects are positive and
[58:45] some of the facts are negative
[58:47] it can be positive when they come in
[58:49] contact with different cultural
[58:50] practices which the children easily
[58:53] adapt to and they also may enjoy
[58:55] such as differences in food
[58:57] personalities or family traditions
[59:00] the negative effect is when they come in
[59:02] contact with negative or hate-filled
[59:04] people
[59:06] so it's the duty of the parents to train
[59:08] their children to be prepared for
[59:09] criticism
[59:10] or unwanted attention
[59:13] by the leading of the holy spirit the
[59:14] parents can prepare their children to do
[59:16] as jesus said if someone curses them
[59:19] they can bless them in return
[59:21] they can also walk away from negative
[59:22] people
[59:24] and they can certainly pray for people
[59:25] who make fun of them or persecute them
[59:29] as a personal testimony when i was
[59:30] growing up i was darker skinned than
[59:32] most of the people in the farm community
[59:34] that i was raised in and so i was called
[59:37] at least two different racial slurs
[59:40] as half mexican and half english
[59:42] i was called the slang word
[59:44] for a mexican american i was also called
[59:47] the slang word for a black person
[59:50] so i was called the s word for mexican
[59:52] american and i was called the n word for
[59:55] a black person because i got so dark
[59:57] during the summer times
[59:58] and because of the name calling i would
[1:00:00] go home crying
[1:00:01] and it really hurt my feelings to be
[1:00:03] name called these slang terms
[1:00:06] but by god's grace my mom prayed with me
[1:00:09] i was able to learn to
[1:00:11] overcome the name calling and eventually
[1:00:12] thank god the name calling stopped after
[1:00:15] a few years
[1:00:16] and i remember the scripture from
[1:00:18] hebrews where the bible said god will
[1:00:19] never leave us nor forsake us
[1:00:22] so despite being mistreated i always
[1:00:23] knew that god was with me and god helped
[1:00:25] me to overcome all the evil treatment
[1:00:28] that i had to endure so i thank the lord
[1:00:30] for his grace upon my life
[1:00:33] question four
[1:00:35] why don't you just take a prophet's
[1:00:37] opinion about interracial marriage
[1:00:40] well first the bible doesn't tell us to
[1:00:42] take every prophet's personal opinions
[1:00:44] on every single matter
[1:00:46] the bible says in acts 17 verse 11 the
[1:00:50] bereans
[1:00:51] believed paul but they took everything
[1:00:53] paul said back to the scriptures to make
[1:00:55] sure everything he said was found in the
[1:00:58] bible
[1:00:59] they searched the scriptures daily
[1:01:00] whether these things were so
[1:01:03] so the bereans believed the prophet
[1:01:05] messenger for their age but still
[1:01:07] searched the scriptures regarding the
[1:01:08] things he said that's the same thing we
[1:01:10] do with brother branham and when i
[1:01:12] search the scriptures i find god
[1:01:14] bringing interracial couples together on
[1:01:16] at least six cases
[1:01:19] and think about this if believers would
[1:01:21] have been required down through the ages
[1:01:23] to believe everything a prophet said
[1:01:26] even their human opinions
[1:01:27] then everybody would have had to believe
[1:01:29] jacob the prophet when he thought joseph
[1:01:32] was dead
[1:01:33] but joseph wasn't dead joseph was alive
[1:01:35] in egypt
[1:01:36] also everyone would have had to believe
[1:01:38] nathan when he told david to do all that
[1:01:40] was in his heart and yet god corrected
[1:01:43] nathan on his human opinion
[1:01:45] so see friends there's no bible teaching
[1:01:47] that says believers should believe every
[1:01:49] single human opinion
[1:01:51] of the prophet of god
[1:01:53] second brother abraham specifically told
[1:01:55] us to be careful not to make his
[1:01:57] opinions divine statements
[1:01:59] especially in relation to martin luther
[1:02:01] king jr and the civil rights movement
[1:02:04] and third it is not healthy to take
[1:02:06] every opinion of any man
[1:02:09] over our own opinion if the bible says
[1:02:11] different than the preacher's opinion
[1:02:14] especially since brother bran told us to
[1:02:16] be very careful when listening to him to
[1:02:19] discern between the human and the divine
[1:02:21] side
[1:02:21] and brother man told us he was not
[1:02:23] infallible and he was subject to making
[1:02:25] mistakes and being wrong
[1:02:28] people that take brother branham's
[1:02:29] opinion over their own every single time
[1:02:32] is a dangerous movement towards
[1:02:34] cult-like behavior
[1:02:37] remember in cults you cannot question
[1:02:39] anything the leader says
[1:02:40] because cults essentially make their
[1:02:42] leader infallible
[1:02:44] it's wrong to make any leader infallible
[1:02:46] except the lord jesus christ
[1:02:49] now true prophets like brother ram can
[1:02:51] speak thus saith the lord and those thus
[1:02:53] say the lord's statements are infallible
[1:02:55] but not every word brother branham said
[1:02:57] on tape was infallible
[1:03:00] jesus christ promised the holy ghost
[1:03:02] would lead and guide us into all truth
[1:03:04] so the longer the holy ghost filled
[1:03:06] believers are here the more truth they
[1:03:09] will receive by revelation of the spirit
[1:03:12] the more discernment they'll have
[1:03:13] between brother brahms opinions and the
[1:03:16] divine statements that he stated with
[1:03:17] thus saith the lord
[1:03:20] inconsistencies among some message
[1:03:22] believers
[1:03:25] i only have two inconsistencies i've
[1:03:26] noticed amongst message believers
[1:03:29] the first is that message believers
[1:03:31] will contradict themselves by saying
[1:03:34] black can't marry white but then they'll
[1:03:36] let the brown marry white
[1:03:38] here's a quote from brother branham
[1:03:40] where he says the brown have to marry
[1:03:42] the brown the white have to marry the
[1:03:44] white the black have to marry the black
[1:03:46] let's listen to the quote
[1:03:49] the people would be a better offense
[1:03:51] god made them
[1:03:54] let the brown race marry the brown race
[1:03:56] the white race mere the white race the
[1:03:58] dark race the yellow race and whatever
[1:04:00] more stay the way god made them
[1:04:02] if apollo god made it it was white let
[1:04:05] it remain white if it's
[1:04:07] blue black brown whatever the flower is
[1:04:09] let it alone
[1:04:10] if corn was raised a certain way yellow
[1:04:12] corn don't mix with white corn if you do
[1:04:14] you mix it up then it can't breathe and
[1:04:15] set back again
[1:04:19] so friends despite this brother random
[1:04:21] quote some message churches will let
[1:04:23] brown marry white
[1:04:24] which shows their hypocrisy because
[1:04:27] they're picking and choosing which
[1:04:28] quotes they want to believe while
[1:04:30] ignoring others
[1:04:32] and then they'll hypocritically say i
[1:04:34] only say what the tapes say
[1:04:36] or they'll say you can't correct a
[1:04:37] prophet
[1:04:38] and yet they are correcting brother
[1:04:40] branham by ignoring his quotes that are
[1:04:42] against their own opinions
[1:04:44] the second inconsistency is related but
[1:04:47] some of these message people will ignore
[1:04:50] the zipporah and moses quotes
[1:04:52] and yet these people will constantly say
[1:04:55] say what the tapes say
[1:04:57] so it's hypocritical and inconsistent to
[1:04:59] say say what brother am's tapes say and
[1:05:01] then ignore the quotes that you don't
[1:05:03] agree with
[1:05:04] and of course there are many examples of
[1:05:06] this
[1:05:07] which lord willing in the future will
[1:05:08] address
[1:05:09] as i said earlier i already have over 52
[1:05:12] proofs from brother rams tapes that not
[1:05:14] every word on tape is thus saith the
[1:05:16] lord
[1:05:19] in closing
[1:05:21] i hope this video has been a helpful
[1:05:22] video by the grace of god i know for
[1:05:24] some people this is a controversial
[1:05:26] subject but please consider all that the
[1:05:29] bible says and what brother branham said
[1:05:31] about these subjects
[1:05:33] remember the bibles are absolute brother
[1:05:35] adam came to point us back to the bible
[1:05:37] brother branham said malachi 4 5 and 6
[1:05:39] would restore the apostolic doctrine to
[1:05:42] the saints
[1:05:44] there must
[1:05:49] for be thus saith the lord malachi the
[1:05:52] fourth chapter
[1:05:55] that's exactly what he said would be a
[1:05:57] sign just before the coming of the great
[1:05:59] and terrible day of the lord i'll send
[1:06:01] you elijah
[1:06:17] so when we read the old testament and
[1:06:19] new testament we can see how god allowed
[1:06:21] interracial marriage at times
[1:06:23] and god cannot change as malachi chapter
[1:06:26] 2 says for i am the lord thy god and i
[1:06:28] change not and of course we all know
[1:06:30] hebrews 13 verse 8 jesus christ is the
[1:06:32] same yesterday today and forever
[1:06:36] if you have any questions concerns or
[1:06:38] testimonies about this video please
[1:06:40] contact me
[1:06:42] god bless you and may jesus christ be
[1:06:44] the desire of your heart
