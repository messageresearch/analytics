[0:00] now I'll read verse 15 and he said unto
[0:02] them go ye into all the world and preach
[0:05] the gospel to Every
[0:07] Creature he that believeth and is
[0:09] baptized shall be saved but he that
[0:11] believeth not shall be damned no and
[0:15] these signs shall follow them that
[0:17] believe in my name shall they cast out
[0:19] Devils they shall speak with new tongues
[0:22] they shall take up serpents and if they
[0:24] drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt
[0:26] them they shall lay hands on the sick
[0:29] and they shall recover so Matthew 28 we
[0:32] saw one perspective of Jesus giving the
[0:35] Great Commission and he said it's
[0:37] recorded there just to teach but then
[0:39] here in Mark 16 we have another
[0:42] perspective of Jesus's last Great
[0:44] Commission and here we see the power of
[0:46] God here we see the supernatural work of
[0:48] the Holy Ghost praise God but we're not
[0:51] done I want to read verse 19 and 20 as
[0:52] well and so then after the Lord had
[0:55] spoken unto them he was received up into
[0:56] heaven and sat on the right hand of God
[0:59] I love verse 20
[1:00] and they went forth and preached
[1:02] everywhere the Lord working with them
[1:05] and confirming the word with signs
[1:07] following amen aren't you glad that God
[1:10] confirms his word with Supernatural
[1:12] signs amen hallelujah let's have one
[1:15] more word of prayer can we just bow our
[1:16] heads for a moment here and let's all
[1:17] agree together in prayer Heavenly Father
[1:19] we thank you for tonight God we thank
[1:21] you for this opportunity to be gathered
[1:22] with Saints of like Precious Faith Lord
[1:24] I love all those songs we sing Lord God
[1:27] thank you for paying the debt that we
[1:28] all owed we all owe to sin debt because
[1:31] the wages of sin is death but thanks be
[1:34] to God Hallelujah for giving us the
[1:36] victory through our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:38] thank you Lord Jesus for taking all of
[1:40] our sin upon you all of our trespasses
[1:43] all of our iniquity and you paid the
[1:45] price for our forgiveness Lord God
[1:47] hallelujah you became our sin that we
[1:49] might become your righteousness so Lord
[1:51] we stand here as righteous Sons and
[1:53] Daughters of God today by Grace Lord God
[1:56] and no one can lay any charge to God's
[1:58] elect Hallelujah thank you God for the
[2:00] love of God for the grace of our Lord
[2:03] Jesus Christ God anoint me to preach
[2:05] tonight Lord God and I pray you'd anoint
[2:06] your people to receive the word of God
[2:09] and Lord I just I pray that your spirit
[2:10] would now flow like we sang Lord may you
[2:13] just flow through me flow through each
[2:14] and every person God for your glory in
[2:16] Jesus Christ's name and the Saints said
[2:19] amen God bless you as you're being
[2:20] seated there praise
[2:23] God I'll try to preach just for an hour
[2:25] tonight you know by the grace of God I
[2:27] got a big trip home as well two and a
[2:29] half hour trip and my family sends their
[2:31] greetings you know my wife wanted to
[2:32] come but we had we had three little ones
[2:34] and we didn't want them driving in the
[2:35] car for 5 hours they kind of get cranky
[2:38] and a little tired you know uh but
[2:40] hopefully maybe next time my wife could
[2:41] come by God's grace uh so we're again
[2:44] happy to be here it was great to see all
[2:46] you when you come down or come up to
[2:47] akan rather uh a number of weeks ago
[2:49] that was such a wonderful time in the
[2:51] Lord and we sure appreciate the
[2:52] sacrifice everybody made and and uh I've
[2:55] been hearing about wonderful baptisms uh
[2:58] more people being baptized that's that's
[3:00] awesome it's just a wonderful blessing
[3:03] to know that people want to be
[3:04] identified with the Lord Jesus Christ
[3:06] Hallelujah so may God richly bless uh
[3:09] each one of you is anyone here that was
[3:11] recently
[3:12] baptized okay not not here okay it would
[3:15] have been Marlin and Matt Marlon Barkman
[3:19] Matt Troyer and then my sister-in-law
[3:22] Mary
[3:24] Joyce all right praise God well I
[3:27] certainly thank the Lord for their souls
[3:28] being baptized praise prise God what a
[3:30] blessing Hallelujah God is really moving
[3:32] praise God hallelujah when a soul gets
[3:35] saved the Bible said there's rejoicing
[3:37] in the presence of the Angels so there's
[3:39] been a lot of angels rejoicing around
[3:40] here lately by God's grace these last
[3:42] few months Hallelujah so I want to just
[3:45] take this thought in Lord willing I'll
[3:46] try like I said try to preach for about
[3:48] an hour here and I want to uh I want to
[3:51] just uh show the importance of having
[3:53] the right Doctrine um and of course you
[3:57] know and show some examples from the
[3:59] Bible of solid Doctrine and then of
[4:02] course doctrine of devils so we can
[4:04] discern uh by God's grace between uh
[4:07] both of them so we saw our text here and
[4:10] and here we read the Great Commission
[4:12] from both perspectives from the
[4:14] perspective of Matthew uh in Matthew 28
[4:17] and their perspective from Luke and we
[4:19] see in both cases here in both cases
[4:22] Jesus says we're to teach All Nations
[4:25] right and as we go and teach All Nations
[4:27] then God will give us signs wonders and
[4:29] miracles in other words God will do
[4:32] Supernatural things to vindicate that
[4:34] his word is being
[4:36] preached and I'm sure uh I'm sure as
[4:39] we've seen even brother John be healed
[4:41] right recently and uh and and brother
[4:44] Daniel talking about his Deliverance
[4:46] those are just two simple examples right
[4:48] of how God comes and he vindicates his
[4:51] truth right God was leading you into
[4:53] truth God's been leading you and God's
[4:54] been leading each one of you into truth
[4:56] and and uh and and amongst the believer
[4:59] God will do Supernatural things he his
[5:02] spirit will drop down and do something
[5:04] spontaneous something Supernatural so
[5:07] that the people will know that God is
[5:09] with them Hallelujah so I hope the
[5:12] church tonight I hope all of you know
[5:14] God is with you praise God if he's
[5:16] setting people free if he's saving
[5:18] people uh if he's healing people's
[5:20] bodies if he's giving you Supernatural
[5:22] dreams right sister Hallelujah if God is
[5:26] giving you Supernatural experiences then
[5:28] that's a it's a test
[5:30] that Jesus Christ is with you praise God
[5:32] his spirit is right here amongst us
[5:34] tonight praise God because we've invited
[5:36] him we've prayed to him we've worshiped
[5:38] to him and he said whether two or three
[5:40] are gathered there I am in the midst
[5:42] praise God so we're thankful that Jesus
[5:45] Christ is here hallelujah and I believe
[5:47] tonight he'll vindicate his word
[5:48] hallelujah some way or another like even
[5:50] last night uh after service you know uh
[5:54] and then today a sister come up and said
[5:56] I really enjoyed last night's service
[5:58] that's just what I needed to hear and
[6:00] and then a couple weeks ago I was
[6:01] preaching and someone come up come up
[6:03] after services and brother Jesse that
[6:04] was exactly I've been struggling with
[6:06] that thought all week and then you came
[6:09] and you came and preach exactly what I
[6:10] was struggling with and God has Set Me
[6:13] Free praise God Amen so that's just how
[6:15] Jesus works praise God the Bible said
[6:18] they that are led by the spirit they're
[6:20] the sons of God hallelujah and so church
[6:22] we always want to be led by the Holy
[6:24] Spirit we want to obey the Holy Spirit
[6:26] and then we want to see the Holy Spirit
[6:28] lead us to say things
[6:29] lead us to do things lead us move us it
[6:32] might seem strange at the time but if
[6:35] we're obeying the word of God and we
[6:37] feel a certain leading then we want to
[6:39] go through with that leading praise God
[6:41] like one time I was over there in
[6:42] Indiana preaching and and I kept going
[6:44] to this side I kept preaching on a
[6:46] certain I kept preaching on a thought
[6:48] about uh you know sexual sin for some
[6:51] reason I kept going to this side and I
[6:53] even during the sermon I'm like why am I
[6:54] going to this side and everybody was
[6:56] laughing well a young man probably about
[6:59] 18 he come up for prayer afterwards and
[7:01] he said brother Jesse I've been
[7:02] struggling with
[7:04] pornography he said and you kept coming
[7:06] to preach that right at me and I had no
[7:08] idea I had no idea and so that's just a
[7:11] testimony of of sometimes God's leading
[7:13] you to say things and do things and even
[7:16] might be leading in a certain direction
[7:17] praise God like he kept leading me to
[7:19] one side of the church and and it's just
[7:22] God God is trying to reach his people
[7:24] praise God and the and the young man was
[7:26] sincere he cried and I kept I kept in
[7:28] touch with him for a few weeks on the
[7:29] text and he was getting Victory by God's
[7:31] grace and uh I I haven't checked in with
[7:34] him lately but I trust by the grace of
[7:36] God that he's obeyed the voice of the
[7:37] Holy Spirit praise God and so you know
[7:40] that God is uh God is here and he's
[7:42] speaking to us here tonight I believe
[7:43] he'll continue to speak to us here by
[7:45] God's grace now I'd like to I'd like to
[7:48] get you to also look at a few verses
[7:50] here um let's let's look at 2 Timothy 4
[7:54] if we can 2 Timothy 4
[7:58] verse1
[8:04] uh we I'll start reading at verse one um
[8:06] of course this is Paul's last letter
[8:08] before he was beheaded as a martyr in
[8:11] Rome and these are some of the last
[8:13] words the Holy Spirit had him write to
[8:16] us so these are beautiful words 2
[8:19] Timothy 4:1 and I want to now look at
[8:21] the the phrase or the two words sound
[8:23] Doctrine he's going to say it in verse
[8:25] three but I want to get to my thought
[8:27] about sound do Doctrine verse versus
[8:30] doctrines of devils all right and you're
[8:33] a you're a group that's freshly come out
[8:35] of denomination right or man-made Creeds
[8:38] and man-made Rule and so and now you're
[8:41] free in Christ Jesus and so the Holy
[8:44] Spirit as he's here amongst you he's
[8:47] going to bring in Preachers and anoint
[8:48] preachers to teach you true Doctrine to
[8:52] give you the true teaching of the Holy
[8:54] Spirit and every now and then you know
[8:56] the enemy might come in and he might try
[8:58] to bring somebody in here and they might
[8:59] try to spread a a a false Doctrine among
[9:02] you just say have you heard about this
[9:03] and have you heard about that and you
[9:05] might want to do this and and youve got
[9:07] to have your guard up you got to be able
[9:09] to resist the devil praise God when the
[9:12] devil brings a false Doctrine or a false
[9:14] uh a doctrine of a devil you got to be
[9:16] able to resist that and you got to turn
[9:18] down that and you got to you resist that
[9:21] by the grace of God and you got to stay
[9:23] with true Doctrine and true teaching by
[9:25] the grace of God
[9:27] hallelujah all right so 2 Timothy 4:1 I
[9:31] charge the therefore before God and the
[9:32] Lord Jesus Christ who shall judge the
[9:36] quick and the dead at his appearing and
[9:37] his kingdom preach the
[9:40] word be instant in season and osas in
[9:43] other words our preachers must be always
[9:44] be ready to preach right sometimes we're
[9:47] not ready but God will be ready for us
[9:49] amen hallelujah that's happened to me
[9:51] many times I don't feel ready but then
[9:53] God will put some thoughts on in my mind
[9:55] and I'll preach it and it will bless the
[9:57] people anyway praise God I just got to
[9:59] be a willing vessel preachers just have
[10:01] to be willing vessels praise God and
[10:03] then if they're obedient and they have
[10:04] confessed their sins God will anoint
[10:06] them to preach exactly what the people
[10:08] have need of hallelujah amen glory
[10:12] preach the word now we finish that uh
[10:14] let's finish verse two reprove rebuke
[10:16] exhort with all longsuffering and
[10:19] Doctrine so preachers have to be very
[10:21] longsuffering in other words they they
[10:23] got to preach the truth but they got to
[10:24] be patient and let the people grow into
[10:27] the word of God
[10:29] I mean we wish we wish it was easy just
[10:31] we could you know tomorrow morning we
[10:33] could wake up and have all of our all
[10:35] our disciplines and we'd have no more
[10:37] trials and you know no no more no more
[10:39] battles to go through that'd be
[10:40] wonderful if I could just go from
[10:42] immature to mature one night I could go
[10:44] to bed immature wake up mature that'd be
[10:46] wonderful but that's not how character
[10:48] is made that's not even how plants
[10:51] natural plants right you don't plant
[10:52] them one day and the next day oh the
[10:54] fruit's here oh Glory no it takes
[10:57] patience you have to work through the
[10:58] season you got to Pray For Rain amen
[11:01] hallelujah you got to weed Hallelujah
[11:03] you got to you got to do your part pray
[11:04] you got to trust the process right but
[11:07] you have to do the work praise God you
[11:09] got to go through the process and the
[11:11] changes and the seasons so it is with us
[11:13] praise God we've got to preach the word
[11:15] of God and let the people receive it and
[11:17] it's got to grow up they have to grow up
[11:20] into the faith praise God they got to
[11:22] receive the word of God and they got to
[11:24] work with it and you got to be patient
[11:26] and you got to let them understand the
[11:27] word of God and you got to let them grow
[11:30] into a real Christian praise God
[11:34] Amen verse
[11:37] three now he says for time will come
[11:39] when they will not endure sound Doctrine
[11:42] now that's a prophecy of this time most
[11:46] churches will not accept sound Doctrine
[11:48] now sound Doctrine just means healthy so
[11:50] you take a it means spiritual
[11:53] health when we preach by the Holy Spirit
[11:56] it produces healthy Christians amen it
[11:59] doesn't produce sick Christians who are
[12:01] depressed all the time addicted to
[12:03] pornography like we said right that's
[12:06] unhealthy Christians anger and
[12:07] bitterness and broken homes and divorces
[12:10] and and adulteries and fornications
[12:13] that's unhealthy living but the real
[12:15] Holy Spirit produces a healthy Christian
[12:17] Life praise God
[12:19] hallelujah and when we teach the truth
[12:22] of God's word it produces a real
[12:24] Christian Life like just an example two
[12:26] nights ago uh we had a Believers come
[12:29] over they're Christians but they don't
[12:31] believe all the Revelation God's given
[12:33] to
[12:34] us and the the the gentleman came over I
[12:37] think he's 45 years old he's a few years
[12:38] older than me I'm
[12:40] 42 and he said brother Jesse he said
[12:42] there's something different about your
[12:44] family I got eight kids he said I feel
[12:48] peace in this
[12:50] home and I said well that's just the
[12:52] grace of God that's just the Holy Spirit
[12:55] I kind of gave my wife a little pat on
[12:56] the back I said give all the credit to
[12:57] mom over there you you
[12:59] know Hallelujah I like to give her she
[13:02] she's with the kids most of the day
[13:04] right as I go to work you know but he
[13:06] said there's something different about
[13:07] your
[13:08] family and I tried to point him to the
[13:10] Bible the revelation God has given us
[13:13] the revelation of God the mysteries of
[13:16] God are finished the Bible says
[13:20] hallelujah and I just it was just a
[13:22] fresh reminder to me that when a a
[13:24] Christian and a family loves Jesus and
[13:28] keeps a healthy Christian Life people
[13:30] are going to notice it praise God he's
[13:33] like I want to read your book and he
[13:35] couldn't believe I could write 800 page
[13:36] book and I said it wasn't me it was
[13:38] Jesus if any good thing comes out of my
[13:41] life it wasn't me because Jesus said in
[13:43] John 15:5 without me you can do nothing
[13:46] praise God none of us can do anything
[13:48] good unless we yield to the Holy Spirit
[13:51] and the Holy Spirit takes control of Our
[13:53] Lives amen and then God can do something
[13:55] with our lives hallelujah praise God
[13:57] Amen thank you Jesus
[13:59] just a fresh reminder to
[14:02] me that most churches don't do not carry
[14:05] sound Doctrine and we'll give us some
[14:07] examples uh later by God's grace why not
[14:11] because let's let's finish verse three
[14:13] but after their own lust shall they Heap
[14:15] to themselves teachers having itching
[14:17] ears so doctrines of devils are are
[14:21] teachings that preachers teach or
[14:24] preachers preach and it allows the
[14:26] people to enjoy the lust of the flesh
[14:31] right so that's how you know that's how
[14:34] you're going to know as we go through
[14:35] some of these scriptures there's obvious
[14:37] examples in the Bible any preacher that
[14:39] allows you to enjoy the lust of the
[14:41] Flesh in a sinful way is a false teacher
[14:45] right and they're preaching false
[14:46] Doctrine but a man of God who's led by
[14:49] the holy spirit will teach you to live a
[14:51] holy life and a real Christian loves
[14:53] living a holy life praise God Amen
[14:57] because you love Jesus said if you love
[14:58] me you'll keep my commands praise God so
[15:02] the Gospel of Jesus Christ is based upon
[15:04] love if I love Jesus I love to obey him
[15:08] praise God now am I gonna have a fight
[15:10] yes I'm gonna have a fight every day
[15:12] with my worst enemy you know who my
[15:13] worst enemy Sister Sarah is you know who
[15:15] it is it's
[15:17] me Jesse Smith's worst enemy is Jesse
[15:20] Smith you say it's the devil well yeah
[15:23] he's he's my enemy but the Bible
[15:26] says Paul said that my greatest enemy is
[15:29] the sin that dwells within me remember
[15:31] that Romans chapter 7 amen he says I
[15:34] want to do good but then Evil's right
[15:36] there with me and then I hate what I do
[15:39] right he he ended up when he sins he
[15:42] hates what he does so in other words
[15:43] Paul's saying I'm my worst
[15:45] enemy right so we can't just blame Satan
[15:49] all the time sometimes well many times
[15:51] we give into our own fleshly
[15:54] desires right
[15:57] Hallelujah
[16:01] now IID like to uh I'll just stop right
[16:04] there well let's read verse four and
[16:06] they shall turn away their ears from the
[16:07] truth and shall be turned unto
[16:11] fables I don't want to be a preacher of
[16:13] fables I want to be a preacher of Truth
[16:16] like a fable is oh just just say a
[16:18] prayer and everybody's going to heaven
[16:20] that's a
[16:21] fable oh you can be a Christian and
[16:24] really live any way you want God's going
[16:25] to forgive you eventually you can just
[16:27] sin however you want that's a favor
[16:29] the Bible says all that live Godly in
[16:32] Christ Jesus will suffer persecution and
[16:34] the Bible says without Holiness no man
[16:36] shall see the Lord praise
[16:39] God see we don't want to preach fables
[16:42] uh just you know stories to people we
[16:44] want to tell you the truth we want to
[16:46] tell you the real gospel the good news
[16:48] that Jesus Christ died for our sins and
[16:50] when we have faith in him it transforms
[16:53] our hearts and our lives hallelujah oh
[16:55] my thank God amen glory
[17:01] now this word Doctrine means to teach so
[17:05] Paul said the real Christians will have
[17:07] healthy Doctrine or healthy
[17:09] teaching but the false Christians right
[17:13] will have doctrines of devils that
[17:17] eventually lead to the lust of the
[17:20] flesh okay now let's I want to show this
[17:23] here uh it'd be important to show this
[17:25] by God's
[17:27] grace 2 Corinthians 11:20 and brother
[17:30] Daniel can you read that when you get
[17:31] that 2 Corinthians
[17:48] 11:20 for ye suffer if a man bring you
[17:51] into bondage if a man devour you if a
[17:54] man take of you if a man exalt if a man
[17:59] SM you on the face amen now look at this
[18:03] verse
[18:04] friends this verse is essentially saying
[18:07] who's the one that's going to cause all
[18:09] the trouble sometimes in the church the
[18:12] preachers
[18:14] right so we got to make sure we got Holy
[18:17] Ghost filled preachers amen hallelujah
[18:19] amen the preachers are going to either
[18:21] build you up or they're going to tear
[18:23] you down thank God they build us up here
[18:26] hallelujah amen thank God Hallelujah now
[18:29] you guys left a preacher that tore you
[18:32] down I'm just going to be personal here
[18:34] for a moment tore down your faith tore
[18:36] down your freedom tears down all this
[18:39] but now you're free in Christ Jesus
[18:41] praise God and now the preachers are
[18:43] building you up Hallelujah they're

[19:08] words of Life Hallelujah and a real
[19:10] preacher will preach and the life of
[19:12] Christ will inspire you to live closer
[19:14] to Jesus praise God Amen read that again
[19:18] brother Daniel read that again
[19:20] buddy for ye suffer if a man bring you
[19:23] into bondage if a man devour you if a
[19:26] man take of you
[19:28] if a man exalt himself if a man Smite
[19:31] you on the face now look at that it says
[19:34] they suffer see the Corinthian Church
[19:37] was allowing false preachers to do
[19:40] that Hallelujah now you all wouldn't let
[19:44] it happen because you all one night
[19:45] before the preacher come up you took
[19:47] some oil and you prayed and you laid it
[19:49] on the
[19:50] chairs amen amen see you are all led by
[19:55] the Holy Spirit to get rid of that false
[19:59] teaching thank God that was a real Act
[20:02] of Faith praise God Amen I told that to
[20:05] our church that's a real testimony there
[20:07] by God's grace talk about the prayer the
[20:09] prayers of the Saints having effect
[20:11] that's beautiful praise God because a
[20:14] man will tear you down but we can't
[20:17] allow it right we can't allow men to
[20:19] tear us down if they got the wrong
[20:21] Spirit we got to get that man out and we
[20:23] got to get men who believe in the Holy
[20:25] Spirit praise God who believe the
[20:28] revelation of Jesus Christ for this hour
[20:30] hallelujah amen thank god oh that's
[20:35] beautiful thank you brother I appreciate
[20:37] that so
[20:39] see God is either going to
[20:41] use uh I'm sorry God is going to use men
[20:44] who are led by the Holy Spirit to build
[20:46] you up but Satan's going to try to send
[20:48] men that are not led by the Holy Spirit
[20:51] but you've got to turn them down you've
[20:53] got to refuse them as you already have
[20:55] experience doing
[20:57] that
[20:58] so if another false teaching would come
[21:01] in you'll be able by the grace of God to
[21:04] withstand it and to send it out of your
[21:06] midst by the grace of God hallelujah how
[21:10] many believe that by God's grace Glory
[21:13] thank the
[21:14] Lord now we just showed you then now in
[21:16] these last two
[21:18] verses we need sound Doctrine we need
[21:21] healthy
[21:23] teaching right but Satan's going to try
[21:25] to anoint
[21:26] men to bring in in false doctrines that
[21:30] hurt the people that harm the
[21:32] people all right
[21:36] now let me uh I want to go to this next
[21:39] thought go to Matthew 4:23 if you got
[21:41] your
[21:43] Bibles I want to just go back to this
[21:45] here before I move on to some of these
[21:49] examples Matthew
[21:57] 4:23
[22:00] brother irin you want to read that
[22:01] brother Matthew
[22:03] 4:23 and Jesus about all G teaching in
[22:08] their synagogues and preaching the
[22:10] gospel of the kingdom and healing all
[22:11] manner of sickness and all manner
[22:14] decease among the people amen
[22:17] hallelujah thank you
[22:20] brother now reason I had him read
[22:24] that where's my scripture okay yeah
[22:28] the reason I had him read that was
[22:29] because look at the ministry of Jesus
[22:32] Jesus did both preaching and teaching
[22:36] how many know there's a difference does
[22:38] everyone know there's a difference
[22:38] between preaching and teaching there's a
[22:42] difference teaching is giving
[22:44] instruction so they said Master teach us
[22:47] to pray and what' he do he showed them
[22:49] how to pray here's how you pray Our
[22:50] Father out in heaven how be your name
[22:52] let your kingdom come let your will be
[22:54] done forgive us our debts as we he gives
[22:56] us the outline teach us he teach us
[22:58] where to pray where do we pray many
[22:59] times in our prayer closet Hallelujah he
[23:03] teaches us how to give arms Lord teach
[23:05] us how to give arms teach us how to fast
[23:07] and he said he shows us how to do that
[23:09] he gives us instructions this is how you
[23:10] do it praise God that's teaching
[23:14] whenever a man of God goes to the word
[23:16] of God and tells you this is how you do
[23:18] something that's teaching but preaching
[23:20] is different preaching is declaring the
[23:23] promises of
[23:25] God okay so
[23:28] you'll have a teacher and maybe he'll
[23:30] teach you about you know praying fasting
[23:32] or giving alms he'll be able to teach
[23:33] you right through the
[23:35] scriptures but then he may break into
[23:37] preaching and he'll declare that Jesus
[23:39] Christ Is A Healer amen Jesus Christ is
[23:43] a savior you can be he declare that
[23:45] he'll declare Jesus Christ can heal you
[23:48] today Jesus Christ wants to save you
[23:50] Jesus Christ can fill you with the Holy
[23:51] Ghost praise God Amen declaring proud
[23:54] Jesus cares about you Jesus uh is
[23:57] patient with you amen Jesus will forgive
[24:00] you all these statements are just
[24:02] preaching which is good we got to have
[24:05] both Hallelujah so Jesus would preach
[24:08] and say I I'm here to heal remember he

[25:36] that's what's most important is
[25:38] spiritual riches not so much natural
[25:40] riches thank God for the jobs that we
[25:42] have in the homes and even this this
[25:44] wonderful garage we have here by God's

[26:44] here to preach over here they'll either
[26:47] be teaching giving instruction how to do
[26:48] something or they'll be preaching and
[26:50] declaring the word of God how many know
[26:52] that we need both of those because Jesus
[26:55] did both he bro he both preached and he
[26:58] taught irin read it right Irvin read it
[27:00] Jesus preached and he

[28:38] need to do here's what you have to
[28:39] understand
[28:40] amen there's both preaching and teaching
[28:43] he amen thank God Hallelujah now some
[28:47] churches are guilty of too much
[28:48] preaching brother urvan it's all
[28:50] miracles all miracles all miracles and
[28:52] you never learn the word and you never
[28:54] get instructed on how to do anything
[28:57] it's just believe believe believe and
[28:59] trust God today's your day for a miracle
[29:01] today's your day for every service is a
[29:03] day for a
[29:04] miracle right but that's the Bible said
[29:06] do all work miracles
[29:09] no and then there's some churches that
[29:11] all those do is teach you this here's
[29:12] how you do this here's how you do this
[29:14] and they don't give you enough they
[29:16] don't give you enough
[29:17] preaching so what do we need we need
[29:19] both praise God we got to have both like
[29:23] for example our church we just had a
[29:24] brother from South Carolina come up and
[29:26] preach uh he's an evangelist so he just
[29:29] goes from church to church and he's a
[29:31] preacher he's not a teacher he'll he'll
[29:33] tell you he said if you want me to teach
[29:35] I can't teach anything I'm here to
[29:37] preach and boy he preached he really
[29:40] raised our faith I'm like Hallelujah I'd
[29:42] be like I could go stomp on uh 12 Devils
[29:44] right now just feel like I could just he
[29:46] just my faith is so high like God gives
[29:48] us all these promises and God is with me
[29:50] and God's C is never going to filine I
[29:52] felt like Abraham like I can just walk
[29:54] out every promise of
[29:55] God it raised my my faith and then we'll
[29:59] have like another we'll have a teacher
[30:00] come in and he'll teach us more insight
[30:02] on how to pray more
[30:04] sincerely oh I never I never thought
[30:07] about that now I now I can approach God
[30:09] through this scripture and I can I can
[30:11] pray more sincere this way oh such a
[30:15] great
[30:16] teaching see how there's a difference
[30:18] can everybody see how there's a
[30:18] difference by God's
[30:21] grace you know that the night Jesus was
[30:24] arrested do you remember what he said I
[30:27] think it's in Matthew let's go to
[30:28] Matthew I'm I I don't have it looked up
[30:30] here but let me see if I can find it
[30:33] Jesus said you come you said you're
[30:35] coming out you're coming to arrest me uh
[30:37] with staves and swords but wasn't I
[30:40] daily with you in the temple how many
[30:43] remember
[30:45] that yeah it's Matthew 26 I
[30:54] believe there it is 55 yeah there is 26
[30:57] thank thank you Jesus I didn't have that
[30:58] scripture written down so the Lord
[31:00] helped me to me remember it praise God
[31:02] Matthew 26:55 in the same hour said
[31:05] Jesus to the multitudes are you come out
[31:07] as against a thief with swords and
[31:09] stains for to take me I sat daily with
[31:12] you doing what teaching in the temple
[31:15] and you laid no hold on
[31:17] me see not not every service was Jesus
[31:20] healing everyone in a prayer line not
[31:22] every service many services were like
[31:24] that but remember he go to Nazareth and
[31:27] could he do could he do prayer lines in
[31:28] Nazareth and heal everybody no the Bible
[31:32] said he was rejected by his own people
[31:34] the Bible said because of their unbelief
[31:36] he couldn't do Miracles he couldn't
[31:37] preach to them think about
[31:40] that God wanted to do Miracles there but
[31:43] they didn't believe and they had
[31:44] something against Jesus and so no
[31:46] Miracles could be
[31:47] done right but here today the holy
[31:50] spirit's here today to raise our faith
[31:52] so we can receive Miracles when God
[31:55] wants to do Miracles but the holy holy
[31:57] spirit is also here to teach us how to
[31:59] live a holy life praise Goden teach us
[32:02] how to pray teach us how to fast and
[32:04] give HS and be a real Christian teach us
[32:07] the Bible how to understand it how to
[32:10] live it how can I forgive how can I how
[32:14] can I be a real blessing to my neighbor
[32:15] how can I how can I witness to win souls
[32:18] because the Bible says he that's wise
[32:20] wins Souls
[32:22] Hallelujah Lord teach me how to save my
[32:24] mother or save my father from out of
[32:27] denomination or teach me how to do
[32:29] that see so we have both Saints we have
[32:34] both preaching to declare God's promises
[32:37] and raise our faith and then we have
[32:38] teaching to show us how to do
[32:41] things
[32:43] Hallelujah didn't the Bible say in
[32:46] Romans 10 that faith comes by hearing
[32:49] and hearing by the word of God
[32:52] hallelujah so see the preaching is
[32:54] either raising our faith for
[32:55] Supernatural works of God God or to
[32:57] believe God or it's teaching us as well
[33:00] it's giving us more faith okay this is
[33:01] how I trust God this is how I become
[33:04] more faithful in my prayer life this is
[33:06] how I overcome Temptations of the flesh
[33:08] this is how I this is how I overcome
[33:10] these Temptations in my
[33:12] life it's teaching me how to do
[33:15] it like just for example uh you know the
[33:18] holy spirit's here to teach us how to
[33:20] how to serve God right away in the
[33:22] morning you know some people they get up
[33:23] and then they go get a pot of coffee or
[33:25] they got to eat like a whole bowl of
[33:26] cereal and they haven't even read their
[33:29] Bibles or they haven't even prayed now
[33:32] I'm not I'm not a legalist but you know
[33:36] the Bible says seek ye first the kingdom
[33:37] of God right and his righteousness so in
[33:41] other words some people are like Sinners
[33:44] well they'll get up and they'll just
[33:45] turn on the TV right
[33:46] away and they haven't even prayed they
[33:48] haven't you of course they're Sinners
[33:50] right they haven't sought God they
[33:51] haven't worshiped God they haven't read
[33:52] their Bibles but if we're going to be
[33:54] Christians we should be able to talk we
[33:56] should be able to be taught by the Holy
[33:58] Spirit how to seek God first
[34:01] amen how to keep God first cuz Jesus
[34:04] said if you seek me first what
[34:05] everything's going to be what added unto
[34:08] you all these other things the clothing
[34:11] the food and all the shelter and
[34:13] everything uh your your crops you know
[34:15] all that's going to be added but you got
[34:17] to seek God first
[34:19] hallelujah
[34:21] amen taught to seek God first taught to
[34:26] worship God first before going about
[34:29] your day amen praise
[34:33] God all right so what was Jesus doing
[34:35] all the time if he wasn't having healing
[34:37] Miracles what was he doing brother Irvin
[34:38] he was teaching the
[34:40] people he just sat down there the Bible
[34:42] said he'd sit on salomon's porch and he
[34:45] would just everybody would sit down he
[34:46] just instruct he he he teach about you
[34:48] know uh he teach about the second coming
[34:50] right he talk about the second coming he
[34:52] he teach Parables he teach all these
[34:54] things he teach about prayer and how you
[34:56] must become like a child to enter the
[34:58] kingdom of God so when he wasn't doing
[35:00] the Miracles and doing the healing and
[35:01] the prayer lines he was teaching the
[35:04] people how many would like to sat and
[35:06] listen to Jesus
[35:08] teach
[35:10] amen one thing we know for sure he would
[35:12] have been confusing all those smart
[35:14] educated Pharisees right because he was
[35:16] doing that at 12 years old Hallelujah
[35:20] and then by the time he was 33 they said
[35:22] we can't ask any more questions we're
[35:23] out of here we we can't handle this guy
[35:25] praise God amen he was such a wise
[35:29] teacher of the word of God hallelujah
[35:31] the father he said I I don't say
[35:33] anything except the father shows me
[35:35] first praise God Amen Hallelujah that's
[35:38] how we should be we shouldn't say
[35:39] anything we shouldn't do anything until
[35:41] God gives us an unction or God gives us
[35:43] a leading of the Holy Spirit God give us
[35:45] a leading tonight praise God
[35:48] Amen
[35:51] Hallelujah now go to 1 Timothy 4 we went
[35:54] to Second Timothy 4 let's go to 1
[35:56] Timothy 4
[35:59] now I want to start looking at this list
[36:01] now
[36:07] here let's look at some actual examples
[36:10] here of doctrines of
[36:13] devils most of us if you've been in the
[36:15] I know brother Irvin's been in the Bible
[36:17] most of his adult life is that right
[36:18] brother you've been Christian most of
[36:19] your adult life Hallelujah so most of
[36:23] these uh most of us have a good
[36:25] understanding of doctrines of sound
[36:27] Doctrine Holiness right but I want you
[36:31] to see some real examples of devilish
[36:34] doctrines so you'll be able to recognize
[36:37] the enemy right at every one of his
[36:40] trips praise
[36:43] God second I'm sorry 1 Timothy 4:1 now
[36:46] the spirit speaks expressly that in the
[36:49] latter times are we the latter times
[36:51] it's been 2,000 years since Christ right
[36:53] I I believe we're in the latter
[36:55] times so some shall depart from the
[36:57] faith giving heed to seducing Spirits
[37:01] which are deceiving seducing means
[37:03] deceiving spirits and doctrines of
[37:08] devils wow so we're I'm either teaching
[37:12] Doctrine from God tonight or doctrine
[37:15] from a devil and I believe it's from the
[37:17] Holy Spirit praise God hallelujah and
[37:19] the way you know is test me by the word
[37:22] of God Paul said prove all things hold
[37:25] fast that which is good amen hallelujah
[37:28] Paul told Timothy rightly divide the
[37:30] word of truth
[37:32] hallelujah the Bible said in first John
[37:35] try every Spirit see whether it be of
[37:38] the spirit of God and how can you know
[37:41] God tells us we go back to the holy
[37:43] scriptures praise God Jesus said Thy
[37:45] word is truth sanctify them through thy
[37:47] truth Thy word is truth this is the
[37:50] truth praise God Amen and the Bible says
[37:52] in the Old Testament any man that
[37:53] doesn't speak according to this word
[37:56] does not have God in him praise God
[38:00] Amen
[38:02] Hallelujah so let's look at some ex uh
[38:05] specific
[38:07] examples of doctrines of
[38:10] devils all right so the first one now
[38:12] this might seem strange to you uh verse
[38:15] two speaking lies and hypocrisy having
[38:17] their conscience sear with a hot iron
[38:20] okay so these preachers will just lie to
[38:23] people and their conscience is seared in
[38:25] other words they don't have a Feeling
[38:27] Anymore of right or
[38:29] wrong I'm sure all of us know this if
[38:32] we've been serving God a long time right
[38:35] when we first become a Christian we're
[38:36] so sensitive to sin right oh there's a I
[38:40] don't want to lie I don't want to steal
[38:41] I don't want to think evil thoughts I
[38:43] don't want to say evil words but we all
[38:45] know if we've been serving God a long
[38:47] time if we're not careful we lose that
[38:49] sensitivity sometimes the church said
[38:53] amen in other words it it doesn't
[38:56] doesn't feel so bad to sin like it used
[39:00] to right like I told you with Paul Paul
[39:03] said I got good and evil right there and
[39:05] then sometimes I do what I
[39:08] hate see sometimes church we lose that
[39:12] but a sinner a false teacher has lost
[39:15] all feeling of that that's why they can
[39:17] say such ridiculous things that they
[39:19] don't feel bad about
[39:21] it
[39:23] unbelievable so we must keep our
[39:25] sensitivity to the Holy Spirit and the
[39:28] way to do that is to daily confess our
[39:29] sins and to stay in the word of God
[39:33] hallelujah brothers and sisters man does
[39:36] not live by bread alone but by every
[39:38] word that proceeds out of the mouth of
[39:42] God if you haven't read your Bible today
[39:44] it's time to read your Bible praise God
[39:46] make sure you read it before you go to
[39:47] bed you should probably read it before
[39:48] you go to bed too even if you read it
[39:49] this morning praise God I'm in jobes I
[39:52] read job this morning by God's grace
[39:55] amen
[39:57] now here's the first example verse three
[40:00] what's the first doctrine of a
[40:03] devil forbidding to
[40:07] marry did everybody catch
[40:09] that forbidding to marry now which
[40:11] church is famous for forbiding people to
[40:14] marry the Roman Catholic
[40:16] Church they have Priestly celibacy right
[40:20] so we know right now it's an absolute
[40:23] doctrine of a devil to tell preachers
[40:25] they shouldn't get married it's from the
[40:27] devil and what do it cause child
[40:31] abuse homosexual priests and
[40:34] nuns that's what it calls the Bible said
[40:37] that's a doctrine of a
[40:40] devil
[40:43] Hallelujah now the second one and verse
[40:47] three and commanding to abstain from
[40:50] meat so anyone that says oh you must be
[40:53] a vegetarian you can't eat meat that's a
[40:55] doct of a devil think about that a devil
[40:58] would say just be a vegetarian and if
[41:00] you eat meat you're a sinner a devil
[41:03] would say that why because it's a it's
[41:06] an issue of Pride it's
[41:07] self-righteousness well I don't eat meat
[41:09] so I'm holier than brother
[41:11] Irvin I'm holier than Daniel because I
[41:13] don't eat meat that's Pride a devil
[41:16] imagine that a devil's trying to twist
[41:18] people's
[41:19] diets now it's okay to be a vegetarian
[41:22] if you want the sin is when you say you
[41:25] can't eat meat
[41:27] that's the sin that's the devil because
[41:30] it's building a denomination right it's
[41:32] a denomination of we're all we're all
[41:34] vegetarians or we're not
[41:36] saved
[41:38] right that's what the Bible
[41:40] says look how look how deceptive Satan
[41:45] is he tells the preachers they can't
[41:47] marry Roman Catholic Church then he says
[41:49] you can't eat Meats now the Roman
[41:51] Catholic Church does that on Fridays
[41:53] during Lent they can't eat meat but then
[41:55] they can eat fish
[41:57] but fish is meat according to the Bible
[41:59] so they contradict themselves it is the
[42:02] B Jesus said give me some meat oh thank
[42:04] you buddy I appreciate that God bless
[42:06] you Hallelujah right Jesus resurrected
[42:09] he said give me some meat right what
[42:11] they give him fish Catholic say we're
[42:13] not eating meat give me fish that's a
[42:16] contradiction right it's a doctrine of a
[42:19] devil oh we're holy and uh we're holy we
[42:22] we don't our preachers don't marry we
[42:24] don't eat meat on Fridays what
[42:26] difference does it make doesn't make any
[42:28] difference it's a self-made
[42:31] righteousness it's a man-made Creed it's
[42:33] a man-made denomination and it's from
[42:35] the devil I just showed it to you praise
[42:37] God that's not my opinion that's what
[42:39] the Bible says how many you believe the
[42:40] Bible praise God
[42:45] Amen now let me show you another one go
[42:48] to Second Timothy 2 Verse
[42:55] 18
[42:57] 2 Timothy
[43:03] 2:18 now Paul
[43:06] lists two men in verse 17 who are
[43:09] spreading this doctrine of a devil now
[43:11] look at this doctrine of a Dev Verse 18
[43:13] who concerning the truth have aired
[43:14] saying that the resurrection is passed
[43:17] already and overthroweth the faith of
[43:20] some now look look just just stop for a
[43:24] moment here look what he says the two
[43:26] false preachers are saying the
[43:27] resurrection's already done in other
[43:30] words there's no more Resurrection
[43:31] there's no
[43:34] Rapture right there's not going to be
[43:36] any Resurrection uh Jesus Jesus and the
[43:39] Saints Old Testament Saints are the only
[43:40] ones who had a resurrection we're not
[43:42] getting a resurrection or there's no
[43:45] Rapture and the Bible says this
[43:47] overthrows people's Faith so a devil
[43:51] will say there's no Rapture we're just
[43:53] going to live here and die and that's
[43:55] that's the end of it
[43:56] that's a lie the Bible says some of us
[43:59] are going to be privileged enough to be
[44:01] alive when Jesus comes back amen
[44:04] hallelujah but the dead in Christ will
[44:06] rise first hallelujah
[44:08] amen Paul's going to rise Peter's going
[44:11] to rise John's going to rise James is
[44:13] going to rise and some of us may see
[44:15] them by the grace of God if we live to
[44:17] see it but a devil will say there's no
[44:22] Resurrection there's no Rapture coming
[44:24] that's a preacher who's anointed of the
[44:26] devil how do you know because look what
[44:28] it does in verse 19 I'm
[44:33] sorry oh I'm sorry yeah I got to read 17
[44:36] I'm sorry 17 is what the Bible is what
[44:38] it's called in the Bible and their word
[44:40] will eat as doth a canker of whom is H
[44:44] hus and fitus okay a canker is a flesh
[44:48] eating disease so how many ever heard of
[44:50] leprosy right leprosy will eat away
[44:53] right at your skin it's something
[44:54] similar to canker something similar to
[44:55] that
[44:56] in other words Paul is saying the
[44:58] preachers that say there's no Rapture if
[45:01] the people accept that it'll be like a
[45:03] flesh eating cancer will eat up all
[45:06] their faith it will just it will destroy
[45:09] them church that means we got to be
[45:11] looking for the coming of Jesus we can't
[45:14] stop looking for the coming of Jesus we
[45:16] got to be ready Jesus said Watch and
[45:19] Pray so that day doesn't come upon you
[45:22] as a thief in the night how many looking
[45:23] for Jesus tonight praise God he could
[45:25] come tonight praise God he can come
[45:27] tomorrow we got to keep looking for
[45:29] Christ don't let your faith get eaten up
[45:31] and get cankered away keep trusting in
[45:33] God hallelujah if we if we have to go to
[45:36] the grave and Jesus still hasn't come
[45:38] that's fine I'll go to my grave saying
[45:40] I'm looking for Jesus to come back
[45:42] praise God and I'll be the first one to
[45:44] rise Hallelujah Hopey those would be my
[45:46] last words if I go to the Grave you know
[45:48] if Jesus doesn't come back in my
[45:50] lifetime I hope those are my last words
[45:52] let me be the first to rise the dead in
[45:55] Christ will rise first
[45:56] first amen thank God Hallelujah there is
[46:00] a resurrection there is a Rapture of the
[46:04] Bride of Jesus Christ of the body of
[46:06] Christ
[46:08] amen now friends there's a
[46:11] whole there's a whole bunch of
[46:14] uh doctrines out there that are false
[46:18] doctrines and let me let me check my
[46:20] time here how much time have I been
[46:21] preaching I just want to preach out okay
[46:22] 46 minutes already that's hard to
[46:25] believe I just have a hard time
[46:26] believing that all
[46:33] right um the next one the fourth one
[46:36] I've showed you three already the fourth
[46:37] doctrine of a devil is a doctrine of no
[46:41] fasting right that's spoken of we're not
[46:43] going to read it but just write it down
[46:44] if you want or just you know I record
[46:45] this I can share with brother irin if
[46:46] you want Mark 2:20 and Philippians 3:19
[46:51] in Philippians 3:19 Paul said false
[46:53] preachers make their belly their
[46:58] God in other words they're only
[47:00] interested in getting enough money so
[47:01] they can feed their big
[47:03] bellies right they only want to be a
[47:06] Christian or they only want to be
[47:08] connected to the church so they can get
[47:09] more
[47:11] food isn't that something that's what
[47:13] Paul said that's not what I said Paul
[47:14] said that they're God they worship their
[47:17] belly right they're more concerned about
[47:20] food than God's
[47:22] word it's a script it's a it's a it's a
[47:24] doctor of a devil
[47:26] more and and didn't Jesus say they'll be
[47:28] eating and drinking like the days of
[47:30] Noah at the end time all they're
[47:32] concerned about is eating and drinking
[47:33] all it's all they're concerned about
[47:35] they can't they don't fast for Jesus
[47:36] they don't fast to grow closer to God or
[47:38] bring healing to people they don't fast
[47:40] at all it's all about just eating and
[47:42] drinking eating and drinking that's all
[47:44] they do and they made their belly their
[47:51] God now I do want you to read this one
[47:53] go to um Jude 1 verse4 if you got your
[47:57] Bible there maybe Micaiah can you get
[47:58] Jude 1 verse4 buddy it's at the very
[48:01] back of the Bible the LA second to last
[48:03] book of the Bible Jude 1
[48:07] verse4 here's the fifth doctrine of a
[48:11] devil and I mentioned this earlier the
[48:14] fifth doctrine of a devil is called
[48:16] lashious if you're familiar with the
[48:17] King James that word means
[48:21] lawlessness so the devil will come and
[48:24] say oh you're saved by grace
[48:26] live however you want I mentioned it
[48:28] earlier that's a Doctrine from
[48:30] hell you can't say well I'm under grace
[48:33] I'll just live however I want I can go
[48:35] sin and do whatever I want no sir that's
[48:38] the devil saying that go ahead buddy got
[48:41] it Jude one
[48:43] verse4 are
[48:54] Cain
[48:56] of our
[49:01] God
[49:02] Only Our Lord Jesus Christ great reading
[49:05] buddy boy you got a good teacher my
[49:07] friend you read pretty good compared to
[49:10] these public school kids I'm
[49:12] around you're good buddy Hallelujah so
[49:15] what do he say there are men that are
[49:18] ordained to condemnation other words God
[49:20] has forn knowledge they're going to be
[49:21] the false teachers and God knows they're
[49:24] going to come in and they're going to
[49:25] change
[49:27] Grace Grace is a gift right but Paul
[49:31] says shall we continue in sin that Grace
[49:34] May abound God
[49:36] forbid in other words should we keep
[49:38] sinning so God can have more grace on us
[49:40] and show more love to us Paul said God
[49:42] forbid that's in Romans chapter 6 I
[49:44] believe if I'm not
[49:47] mistaken see so Micaiah read it very
[49:50] well evil men will turn Grace into
[49:54] lawlessness
[49:56] well you know you can you can go ahead
[49:57] and divorce that woman and go ahead
[49:59] marry another one and if you want go
[50:01] ahead divorce again and just marry
[50:02] another it's okay you're saved by grace
[50:04] no it's not no it's not you can't do
[50:08] that you marry one Jesus said go back to
[50:11] the beginning with Adam and Eve praise
[50:13] God go back to the beginning it's one
[50:15] man one woman until death praise God The
[50:17] Vow lasts until
[50:19] death but see you know a lot you you
[50:21] guys may you may or may not know it but
[50:23] a lot of churches in America a allow
[50:25] people to marry two and three and four
[50:28] times that's from hell that's a doctrine
[50:31] of a
[50:33] devil
[50:34] Hallelujah and so it is when they say oh
[50:37] it's okay you can go get drunk like my
[50:40] wife was raised in the Lutheran Church
[50:42] and their preachers actually allow them
[50:44] to drink alcohol and get drunk but as
[50:46] long as they come to church on Sunday
[50:47] it's okay I had a friend brother Irving
[50:51] he was a Lutheran he's a paper Lutheran
[50:53] his whole wall was filled with empty
[50:54] beer cans
[50:56] I mean it looked like a stor shell and
[50:57] he was proud of that now that's sad
[51:00] friends that's sad but who allowed it
[51:02] the preachers allowed it what was it a
[51:05] doctrine of a
[51:07] devil right the their their God was
[51:10] their
[51:12] belly Hallelujah and the Bible says be
[51:15] not drunk with wine which is going to
[51:18] excess but the Bible said be drunk with
[51:21] the Holy Spirit praise God that's what
[51:22] we need today we need somebody drunk
[51:25] with the spirit of God hallelujah
[51:27] they're so in love with Jesus they look
[51:29] like they're drunk but I look like I'm
[51:30] drunk yet tonight praise God hallelujah
[51:32] drunk on the spirit of God they just
[51:34] love God they just want to give God
[51:36] praise they want to love God that's what
[51:39] that and they accuse him of being drunk
[51:41] on the day of Pentecost may may God
[51:43] granted that some in this church will be
[51:45] accused of being drunk on the Holy Ghost
[51:48] praise God oh let it be me Let It Be You
[51:51] praise God each one of us should be so
[51:53] full of the spirit of God that we're
[51:55] filled with God's love and power amen
[51:59] hallelujah I hope somebody in my life
[52:01] can accuse me you look like you're drunk
[52:03] y say not of natural wine spiritual
[52:07] wine amen hallelujah that's what I want
[52:10] my testimony to me praise God and then I
[52:12] want to live holy tomorrow too amen when
[52:15] I'm not shouting or Screaming or dancing
[52:18] I still want to live holy all the days
[52:20] of my life you know why cuz Jesus said
[52:23] be holy because I'm holy
[52:26] am but the Bible also said be uh rejoice
[52:30] in the lord always and again I say
[52:33] rejoice hallelujah praise God the Bible
[52:36] also says to be full of joy full of
[52:39] rejoicing praise God amen amen
[52:43] hallelujah and I preached that last time
[52:45] I'm going to say it here again remember
[52:47] last time I was dancing around here I
[52:48] had to make sure I didn't hit my head
[52:49] right I had to make sure I jumped over
[52:52] here I didn't hit my head on that metal
[52:54] piece right there
[52:56] because David danced with all of his
[52:58] heart and God God was blessed by it God
[53:03] looked down from heaven and said there's
[53:04] a man after my own heart right
[53:09] there Hallelujah other words you you
[53:12] each one of us need to be free to give
[53:14] God glory praise God like when we're
[53:16] singing that song like we sang today
[53:18] those three songs some of you can have
[53:20] the freedom just shout out praise
[53:22] God or can shout out Hallelujah praise
[53:25] God you just keep singing you
[53:28] know Hallelujah there's freedom in the
[53:31] Holy Spirit praise God even while I'm
[53:33] preaching you some of you can stand up
[53:35] and say
[53:37] amen that's not going to hurt my
[53:39] feelings that just shows you're really
[53:41] believing what you're hearing
[53:43] amen hallelujah praise God Amen one time
[53:48] I preached and the people were pulling
[53:49] so hard I had to stop preaching I
[53:51] couldn't preach anymore the whole church
[53:53] it was at Cam's Church my brother cam
[53:55] I was preaching about Elijah and
[53:59] Elisha and I was saying how elishah had
[54:02] to keep watching Elijah the whole time
[54:04] as long as he kept his eyes on Elijah he
[54:07] get that double
[54:08] portion so he just followed him around
[54:11] everywhere he went said I'm found Elijah
[54:12] I'm found Elijah and God sent us an
[54:14] Elijah this day too hallelujah praise
[54:18] God and he saw when Elijah went up he
[54:21] was watching he said oh my father my
[54:24] father the the Chariots of Israel the
[54:26] horsemen
[54:27] thereof oh my that that actually means
[54:30] Elijah you're more important to us than
[54:33] all the Chariots and horses and swords
[54:36] the man of God the daughters of God the
[54:38] children of God are more important for
[54:40] our safety and all the the F-15 Fighters
[54:43] and helicopters that this Army has your
[54:45] prayers protect us more than even the
[54:48] natural armies of America praise God
[54:52] Amen so Elisha waited and can you
[54:54] imagine when that mantle started falling
[54:56] you imagine he ran up and he just
[54:58] grabbed that mantle with all he had oh
[55:00] he said praise God I got what I wanted I
[55:04] got the double anointing so he walked
[55:07] over to the stream he took this mantle
[55:10] and he struck the water and he said
[55:12] where's the god of
[55:14] Elijah amen I got his anointing I got
[55:18] his mantle where is the god of Elijah
[55:21] and he struck the waters and the waters
[55:23] moved back oh what a what a a blessing
[55:25] praise God hallelujah and as I was
[55:29] preaching that at cam Church the people
[55:30] were so loud I said I and they're
[55:32] worshiping I said you just worship God
[55:34] I'm done
[55:35] preaching and we had a prayer line and
[55:37] numerous people got healed on that
[55:38] prayer
[55:39] line even even my grandpa my grandpa had
[55:42] diabetes and his leg was numb he come up
[55:45] for prayer this just a couple years
[55:46] before he died he come up for prayer he
[55:47] said after I prayed for him all the
[55:48] numbness left and all the feeling came
[55:50] back in his
[55:52] leg that's Jesus amen and it reminded me
[55:56] of when Solomon dedicated the temple and
[55:57] Moses and Aaron what happened when they
[56:00] dedicated the Tabernacle you
[56:02] remember when they anointed they took
[56:05] the the blood of the the the goats and
[56:07] they anointed all three courts what
[56:09] happened the Holy Ghost fell and the
[56:11] priest couldn't even
[56:14] Minister Hallelujah in other words when
[56:17] the church gets cleaned out when the
[56:19] church is on fire for God hallelujah
[56:21] then then the preachers don't need to
[56:23] preach anymore the people just enjoy the
[56:26] presence of God hallelujah oh my I've
[56:29] only seen it happen a couple times in my
[56:31] 19 years of preaching but it can happen
[56:34] here it can happen anywhere wherever
[56:36] people love God and worship God and
[56:40] preachers got to be longsuffering so we
[56:42] can have that someday by God's grace
[56:45] hallelujah
[56:46] amen thank God
[56:50] Amen thank you
[56:52] Jesus I don't know how I got to there
[56:54] but
[56:55] that's the fifth one that's the fifth
[56:58] doctrine of a devil oh you you you have
[57:00] Grace you can live however you want it's
[57:02] okay if you keep sinting and you keep
[57:04] doing wicked things that's a doctrine of
[57:06] the
[57:08] devil a sixth one is
[57:10] that a lot of preachers say it today
[57:13] it's called the Prosperity Gospel God
[57:15] wants everybody Healthy and Wealthy how
[57:16] many ever heard that one before that's a
[57:19] Doctrine from Hell God doesn't make
[57:22] everybody
[57:23] wealthy I got scripture where the Bible
[57:25] says the Lord makes some poor and some
[57:31] rich
[57:35] right and even healthy Paul cried out
[57:38] three times God heal me heal me what did
[57:40] Jesus say my grace is sufficient for you
[57:43] I'm not going to heal you this
[57:44] time right that was in second
[57:46] Corinthians chapter
[57:49] 12 some people will just the the
[57:51] preacher say well if you're not if
[57:53] you're not healthy it's your own fault
[57:55] and you don't have enough Faith well how
[57:57] do they know that did Paul have not have
[58:00] enough Faith No he had so much Faith he
[58:03] prayed three times and Jesus said no my
[58:06] grace is sufficient for you what about
[58:08] Timothy Timothy had often infirm
[58:10] infirmities in his stomach remember that
[58:13] and what did Paul say well let me just
[58:15] pray for you I'm going to cast that
[58:16] devil out of you no
[58:18] no Paul said drink a little wine for
[58:21] your stomach sake Timothy and your of in
[58:24] infirmities
[58:25] right does everybody hear
[58:28] me God doesn't always want to heal and
[58:31] always make you wealthy and Rich that's
[58:33] not always God's plan but these
[58:35] preachers are lying to the
[58:38] people it's a doctrine of a
[58:41] devil where oh if I'm not healed it's my
[58:44] fault if I'm not rich it's not it's my
[58:45] fault no it's not it might be God's will
[58:48] now sometimes it might be your fault
[58:49] right but sometimes it's God's will if
[58:52] you're sick or you're poor
[58:55] in church don't get me wrong I don't
[58:56] want anybody to be sick I hate being
[58:59] sick but sometimes God allows it in
[59:02] Paul's case to keep him
[59:06] humble or sometimes God will keep you
[59:08] sick for a testimony like the boy or the
[59:11] man who was who was born blind right
[59:13] that the Jesus disciples asked Jesus why
[59:16] is he born blind is it his sin or his
[59:17] parents' sin he said neither it's for
[59:20] the glory of God is everybody with me
[59:25] see so when a preacher says everybody's
[59:27] wealthy everybody should be wealthy it's
[59:29] your fault if you're not wealthy it's
[59:30] your fault if you're not healthy that's
[59:31] a
[59:32] lie each one of us have to seek God for
[59:35] God's will for our
[59:37] lives each one of us got to be like Paul
[59:39] and say Lord Heal Me Lord Heal Me Lord
[59:43] provide for
[59:44] me and even Paul in his last letter
[59:46] what' he tell he told Timothy make sure
[59:49] you bring that coat because it's coming
[59:51] the winter time think about that church
[59:54] Paul had had one coat and it wasn't even
[59:56] in the city where he was at he didn't he
[59:58] didn't have enough money brother Urban
[1:00:00] like we could we could go to any store
[1:00:01] and we can buy a coat like that in in
[1:00:04] this
[1:00:05] town Paul couldn't do
[1:00:08] that now was he God's man or not was he
[1:00:11] was he a prophet of God or not yes he
[1:00:13] was so apparently God didn't want him
[1:00:15] wealthy he couldn't even afford a coat
[1:00:17] we can all go to Walmart or whatever
[1:00:19] story you guys got here we'll just we
[1:00:23] we'll go tonight we'll get your car
[1:00:24] heart brother Daniel right we can do
[1:00:26] that but Paul wasn't he was so poor he
[1:00:30] said make sure you bring my parchments
[1:00:32] my my my my my uh my books and bring my
[1:00:36] coat because it's coming winter
[1:00:39] time
[1:00:42] hallelujah thank the Lord now there's a
[1:00:45] whole bunch more I'm just going to read
[1:00:46] a bunch of them now the one we got to
[1:00:48] battle
[1:00:50] today is there's a spirit of
[1:00:53] pride
[1:00:55] where preachers today and if you haven't
[1:00:57] seen it I can show you the videos
[1:00:59] preachers today that believe what we
[1:01:00] believe they call themselves The
[1:01:02] Greatest Christians of all time so
[1:01:04] really they don't believe what we
[1:01:06] believe that's the same thing the
[1:01:08] disciples were arguing about who's
[1:01:09] greater remember Peter and John and
[1:01:11] James well I'm greater than you and
[1:01:12] Jesus said why you argu about who's
[1:01:14] greater you're
[1:01:17] carnal see that's anytime we exalt
[1:01:20] ourselves we're the greatest or we're
[1:01:21] we're something special we're nothing
[1:01:24] but the only thing we're special is
[1:01:25] because Jesus saved us praise God that's
[1:01:27] the only thing that makes me special is
[1:01:29] that Jesus died for me and he let me
[1:01:31] receive salvation he gave me the gift of
[1:01:33] faith
[1:01:35] Hallelujah I think I'm at an hour now
[1:01:37] here so I better try to close
[1:01:39] here yeah I'm just pass an hour
[1:01:43] here and then some people will say
[1:01:45] brother Bram was the greatest prophet of
[1:01:47] all time and we're the greatest
[1:01:49] Christians of all time but there's no
[1:01:51] scripture for that there's no scrip
[1:01:54] scripture for
[1:01:55] that and even if they were like John the
[1:01:58] Baptist who is the greatest Old
[1:02:00] Testament person John the Baptist was
[1:02:02] the greatest Old Testament isn't that
[1:02:03] what Jesus
[1:02:05] said Jesus said no man is born of a
[1:02:08] woman greater than
[1:02:11] John so even if someone is the greatest
[1:02:14] Christian of all time they're not going
[1:02:16] to say it you got to let Jesus say
[1:02:19] it amen hallelujah praise God real
[1:02:23] Christians don't walk around say I'm the
[1:02:24] greatest ever was I'm no no no no
[1:02:27] Christians are
[1:02:30] servants a minister means a servant a
[1:02:32] preacher I should I'm serving You by
[1:02:34] preaching the word of God left my family
[1:02:35] tonight right to preach and labor and
[1:02:38] sweats running down my back right I'm
[1:02:40] preaching the word of God I'm bringing
[1:02:42] you the truth of God's word to serve you
[1:02:44] praise
[1:02:45] God
[1:02:50] hallelujah there's a whole bunch others
[1:02:53] here
[1:02:56] the Bible also says let's read 1 Timothy
[1:02:58] 1 here 1 Timothy
[1:03:01] 1:9 I want to show you some other
[1:03:03] doctrines of devils just so you got it
[1:03:05] in the scripture just so you know where
[1:03:07] it's at in the scripture you're probably
[1:03:09] aware of it but it's really wonderful
[1:03:11] the Bible lists these out these are
[1:03:13] doctrines of
[1:03:17] Devils first Timothy verse uh n knowing
[1:03:22] this that the law is not made for a
[1:03:23] righteous man but the for the Lawless
[1:03:24] and disobedient for the ungodly and the
[1:03:27] Sinners for Unholy and profane for
[1:03:29] murderers now notice so here's the first
[1:03:32] Doctrine now most PE most churches don't
[1:03:35] teach this but some might we know the U
[1:03:38] actually we know the Muslims teach this
[1:03:39] right they can if Muslims kill people
[1:03:42] when they die in the Jihad they're
[1:03:44] promised eternal life that's a doctrine
[1:03:47] of a devil because
[1:03:49] murder any murder that's acceptable is a
[1:03:52] doctrine of a devil right
[1:03:57] that's uh first one in verse n
[1:03:59] now for murders of fathers and murders
[1:04:02] of mothers for manslayers verse 10 for
[1:04:04] wh mongers so these are people that
[1:04:06] sleep around with all kinds of different
[1:04:07] people that's that's from hell right
[1:04:10] that's a doctrine of a devil oh you can
[1:04:12] sleep and you can you can have as many
[1:04:15] lovers as you want that's from hell
[1:04:17] that's a
[1:04:19] lie for wh mongers for them that defile
[1:04:22] themselves with mankind that's
[1:04:23] homosexual
[1:04:25] for men
[1:04:26] Stealers now that's from people that rob
[1:04:29] men for slavery men and women for
[1:04:31] slavery that's men Stealers so slavery
[1:04:33] is abomination to God and if there be
[1:04:36] any other thing that's contrary to sound
[1:04:41] Doctrine
[1:04:45] Hallelujah now let me read a couple more
[1:04:47] here as I close give me five minutes
[1:04:49] here let me set timer I'll try to close
[1:04:52] you've been a wonderful audience here
[1:04:53] tonight it's hard to that was already in
[1:04:54] hour it's hard to believe that's already
[1:04:55] an hour I I hardly believe it here's
[1:04:58] some more doctrines of devils here's a
[1:05:00] doctorine in the Pentecostal churches
[1:05:02] say everybody's got to speak in tongues
[1:05:04] that's that's the doctrine of a devil
[1:05:06] because Paul said not all speak with
[1:05:09] tongues second people wear immodest
[1:05:11] clothing now you guys got good modest
[1:05:13] clothing but most churches have immodest
[1:05:15] clothing and that's a doctrine of a
[1:05:17] devil some Churches allow women
[1:05:19] preachers that's a doctrine of a devil
[1:05:22] women are not called to preach God's
[1:05:23] word
[1:05:25] mandatory circumcision for righteousness
[1:05:27] now that's a Jewish thing right but it
[1:05:29] could it could impact some people you
[1:05:31] the boys have to be circumcised or
[1:05:33] you're not saved you're not in Abraham's
[1:05:34] Covenant that's a doctrine of a devil
[1:05:36] Paul
[1:05:38] said
[1:05:40] um when when Paul I'm sorry when Peter
[1:05:43] wouldn't eat with the Gentiles he was
[1:05:45] discriminating because of fear and
[1:05:47] that's a doctrine of a
[1:05:49] devil right I'm only going to eat with
[1:05:52] white people or I'm only going to eat
[1:05:53] with black people people and I'm going
[1:05:54] to not eat with white people that's
[1:05:55] that's a devil causing division because
[1:05:59] Jesus Christ is the spirit of love and
[1:06:01] unity praise
[1:06:03] God
[1:06:06] hallelujah
[1:06:07] amen adultery like we said divorcing and
[1:06:10] remarrying that's a doctrine of a
[1:06:12] devil we already saw murder putting any
[1:06:16] evil things before your eyes that's a
[1:06:18] doctrine of a devil if people allow that
[1:06:21] right that's Psalms 101:3 David said I
[1:06:24] will set no Wicked thing before my eyes
[1:06:26] and 1 Timothy 5 says uh abstain from all
[1:06:30] appearances of evil praise God praise
[1:06:35] God uh having a calling God three
[1:06:39] persons is a doctrine of from Satan
[1:06:41] because God never said I'm three persons
[1:06:44] it changes who God is right it's exactly
[1:06:47] right God never said I'm three
[1:06:49] persons the Bible said Jesus is the
[1:06:51] image of God's one person
[1:06:54] that's what the Bible said in Hebrews
[1:06:56] 1:3 another one is hair lengths when a
[1:06:59] man grows his hair that's the doctrine
[1:07:01] of a devil when a woman cuts her hair
[1:07:02] that's a doctrine of a devil that's true
[1:07:05] that's the Bible 1 Corinthians
[1:07:08] 11 adding books to the Bible is a
[1:07:10] doctrine of a devil like the Book of
[1:07:12] Mormon you're adding to God's word God's
[1:07:14] plagues will be added to
[1:07:17] them blaspheming or changing God's name
[1:07:20] is a doctrine of a devil like they call
[1:07:22] him Holy Trinity that's a Doctrine of a
[1:07:24] devil God God is not a trinity he's not
[1:07:27] a trinity of persons he's one God hereo
[1:07:30] Israel the Lord our God is one Lord amen
[1:07:34] hallelujah crossdressing is an
[1:07:36] Abomination women wearing pants is a
[1:07:38] doctrine of a devil men dressing up like
[1:07:40] women like they some people do today I
[1:07:42] saw one yesterday at Target dressing up
[1:07:45] that's probably the last time I'm going
[1:07:46] to Target

[1:07:50] time I got I got to go to

[1:08:35] Doctrine this is in the Old
[1:08:38] Testament what is God's teaching like
[1:08:40] it's like a rain shower boy we really
[1:08:42] need rain don't we

[1:09:30] word of God and I felt like my soul was
[1:09:32] being watered oh I walk in here dry but
[1:09:35] I leave out here with a drink from the
[1:09:37] Holy Spirit praise God I walk out here
[1:09:40] saturated hallelujah amen I came in all
[1:09:42] dry and not really wanting to praise God
[1:09:45] or hear God's word but I walk out I'm
[1:09:47] satisfied I feel like God has watered my
[1:09:51] soul thank God Amen then Jesus says when
[1:09:54] you're born again sister wi Jesus said
[1:09:56] it flows up up out of you like a well of
[1:09:59] Living Water

[1:10:13] beautiful
[1:10:15] Glory there's my five
[1:10:19] minutes so God said when I teach you
[1:10:22] it's like a rain sh hours Falling and
[1:10:24] let's pray for rain when we're done here
[1:10:26] brother we need it too at our place my
[1:10:29] wife planted all these plants and it
[1:10:30] hasn't rained much on him
[1:10:32] so last scripture it's my last one let's
[1:10:35] stand my last scripture second John go
[1:10:38] to this The Second Epistle of John
[1:10:40] towards the end of the New Testament I
[1:10:42] want you to see how important true
[1:10:44] Doctrine is sound Doctrine brother Urban
[1:10:46] brother John whoever is going to be
[1:10:48] preaching most of the time
[1:10:50] here true Doctrine is so important
[1:10:57] I go as far as saying this those people
[1:10:59] with the true Doctrine are the ones who
[1:11:01] have the true holy
[1:11:02] spirit because of this verse right here
[1:11:05] brother Urban would you read uh verses
[1:11:07] let's see 9 and 10
[1:11:11] brother whoo transgresses and abideth
[1:11:14] not in the of Christ has not God he that
[1:11:18] abideth in the doctr of Christ he has
[1:11:21] both the father and the son if there
[1:11:24] come any unto you and bring not this do
[1:11:28] receive him not into your house neither
[1:11:31] him God speak amen and let's all say it
[1:11:35] together and the church said what
[1:11:37] amen so did did did we hear that right
[1:11:40] Church brother irin and I read this
[1:11:43] correctly whosoever abideth not in the
[1:11:46] doctrine or the teaching of Christ does
[1:11:48] not have God so all these churches that
[1:11:52] teach these doctrines of devils God is
[1:11:53] not
[1:11:54] there right they don't have
[1:11:59] God but if we abide or live in or dwell
[1:12:03] in the doctrine the teaching of Christ
[1:12:05] we have both the father and the son
[1:12:09] remember the father is invisible
[1:12:11] Spirit right so we have the invisible
[1:12:14] Spirit the Holy Spirit and we have the
[1:12:16] son and Jesus is the high priest amen so
[1:12:20] we got the Holy Spirit and we got the
[1:12:22] body of Jesus that makes intercession
[1:12:24] for us if we teach the right Doctrine
[1:12:26] and live the right Doctrine Church what
[1:12:28] else could we ask for we couldn't ask
[1:12:30] for anything else all we could ask for
[1:12:32] is to have the right teaching so the
[1:12:34] Father and Son can minister to all of
[1:12:36] our needs Hallelujah and the people
[1:12:39] said amen let's bow our heads for a word
[1:12:41] of prayer I told you that was my last
[1:12:43] verse I could preach a couple more hours
[1:12:45] probably tonight but I don't want to be
[1:12:47] driving past 1: a.m. tonight my God's
[1:12:49] grace Hallelujah let's bow our heads for
[1:12:51] a
[1:12:52] moment
[1:12:55] we want to pray for natural rain church
[1:12:57] but I also want to pray for Spiritual
[1:12:58] rain that the teaching of the holy
[1:13:01] spirit will be present in this
[1:13:04] place that the teaching will always
[1:13:07] point us to
[1:13:08] Holiness and not enjoying lust of the
[1:13:11] flesh like the sinful lust of the flesh
[1:13:14] it's okay to eat a steak right it's okay
[1:13:16] to eat chicken it's that that's not the
[1:13:18] sin I'm talking about of the lust of the
[1:13:19] flesh I'm talking about adultery
[1:13:22] fornication
[1:13:24] like abstaining from meats and priests
[1:13:27] not marrying you know preachers not

[1:13:31] and thank God for the true doctrine that
