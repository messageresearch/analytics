TRANSCRIPT
========================================
the greatest thing that I find against the church tonight is fear Everybody's scared to death about something what are you scared about if a man's born again you should be happy Carefree just like these fellows singing up here and a brother testifying back there just free there ain't nothing can harm you nothing present nothing future nothing can separate us from the love of God that's in Christ God has promised he's called by election he said he's Church in order Jesus said no man can come to me except the father draws him you never come to God because that you wanted to you come because Christ called you God called you and he that comes to me I will in no wise cast out I'll give him every lasting life not just lasting for a week one Revival to another but Everlasting eternal life and will raise him up at the last day oh my that doesn't take the wind out of Satan's sails I don't know what it does say how you know I said Jesus said so thus sayth the Lord Jesus said so that settles it if he said it I believe it he said in John 5:24 P subject to me he that Hearth my words and believeth on him that sent me has everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation with pass and death into life so that's pretty easy brother Brandon no man no man can believe Jesus to be the Christ in his heart and will be the same man he was before can't do it no sir as I said last night drinking smoking gambling all those things isn't sin it isn't sin to gamble it isn't gambling isn't sin rather smoking isn't sin drinking isn't sin swearing isn't sin it's a attribute of sin because you're a sinner that's the reason you do it if you was a Christian you wouldn't do it he said he that loves the world are the things of the world the love of God's Not in even in him so now you're either uh you never did see a Halfway Christian I asked someone the other night I said are you a Christian brother said I'm a pretty good Christian said no you're not there is no pretty good Christian how many ever seen a drunk sober man nobody how ever seen a black white bird nobody it's either you never seen a sinner Saint you're either born again or you're not borned again you're either on one side of the fence and now if you are borned again you have everlasting life and there's nothing within you all the old things has passed away and it's just the the fountain Bitter Sweet Water don't come from the same Fountain see the trees knowing by the fruit it bears by their fruits you shall know what is the Holy Ghost today to a human being when it comes it's the circumcised didn't didn't Stephen say so in in um acts the 7th chapter when he said oh you uncircumcised the heart and ears you always do resist the Holy Ghost as your fathers did so do you is that right and the Holy Ghost is a circumcision and what circumcision do cuts off surpless flesh amen all the things of the world it's circumcises you away from the things of the world the love of the world the love of the flesh the pride of life it just circumcises you from that you have nothing to do with it it does it itself and puts you in love with Jesus Christ with an undying love there's nothing can separate you from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus Paul said perils and trials and prisms and everything else nothing present nothing future can separate us from the love of God which in Christ Jesus and he's called you circumcised you put it you in him and predestinated your Eternal destination if that ought to make Christians shout I don't know what we're do it if that wouldn't wake the man up and it's in Christ I don't know what would take to wake him up I believe he's twice dead plucked up with the roots don't you all right
