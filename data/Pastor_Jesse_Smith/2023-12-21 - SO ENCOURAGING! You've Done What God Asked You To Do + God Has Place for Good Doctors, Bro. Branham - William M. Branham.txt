TRANSCRIPT
========================================
well now many of these little pretty faed mothers sitting here some of them 60 or 70 years old would say what have I done brother brandom you've raised your children you've done what you were supposed to do maybe some old dad sitting here say well I've hired the fields I've done this I never preach but you did just what God sent for you to do there's a place for you speaking to an old doctor yesterday one of my doctor friends buddies 80 something years old and his sister-in-law is here at the church tonight and she's been just a tingle teeny bit worried about him and I went to see him and as soon as I began to talk to him he brightened up told me about a hunting trip he taken many years ago up in Colorado in the very same country I hunt and just as brilliant and bright and I said Doctor how long you been practicing he said when you were nursing and way down I said a many a time he said I've practiced taking my buggy I put my saddle bags over my horse I took the little Cel and I've walked and I said yes down along the creek Banks 2:00 in the morning with your flashlight trying to find the house where her little child had tummy acre mother and labor pains that's right and I said you know doctor I believe across this dividing line here between Mortal and immortality God has a place for good old doctors that serve like that great tears come in his eyes and he started crying he reached up his feeble hands and said brother I hope so across the land god judges a man's Soul what he is then I give him this satisfying scripture many times plying through those dark muddy fields at night trying to help somebody maybe never get a penny for but it's all right I said Jesus said in the scripture blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain Mercy amen and that is true
