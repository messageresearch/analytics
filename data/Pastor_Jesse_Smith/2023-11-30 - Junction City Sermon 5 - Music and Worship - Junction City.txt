TRANSCRIPT
========================================
that's really handy if that is going to we'll see how that uh the air stays off or not because I just want to play a few clips from brother brandom tonight and also teach from the word of God I thought it might help us uh uh especially as a young a young group of Believers as you are as far as young in the Revelation that God's revealed in this hour I thought I'd play a couple um uh uh sermon audios from brother brandom and I tried to find my loudest device this so far this iPad was the loudest one it was louder than my phone there so I'll probably have to hold it up so everybody can hear but I want you to actually hear what it was like in some of those meetings some of those songs and uh it'll be a great blessing to you I'm sure like it's been a great blessing to me all these years you know I've heard the I first heard uh the message on no on November uh 2001 on Thanksgiving night I heard the message for the first time I heard serpent seat that's a first message Simon's like you got to listen to this Jesse you got to listen to this I'm like okay man okay I'll listen to it he kept he kept pushing on me and I it was like it was like two or three 4 hours of just like uh I couldn't believe it spiritual Revelation eyes open and I'm like and I'm wow I I just started seeing the the world in a whole new way along with the Bible Hallelujah and it's been a life transformation ever since Hallelujah so I thank the Lord for his grace thank I thank the Lord for thus sayeth the Lord hallelujah maybe I'll preach that next time uh I just got a whole sermon on all that thus sayth the Lord Brother man preach that pertain to doctrine that pertain to Mysteries and beautiful message praise God and all the future prophecies you know with the Vatican and Russia and different prophecies it's just a beautiful message to know we don't have thus sayth some denomination we have thus sayith the Lord Jesus Christ amen hallelujah it's a beautiful thought so uh you know I guess I thought I would preach this I think last week or no two weeks ago I left here and I thought I'd like to preach on just worship scriptures and music and the power of it um just some general scriptures so we started there in second Kings and this is of course Elisha he was the prophet right after Elijah and this in this case brother man makes it's a kind of a humorous story brother R makes this very humorous he said the prophet Elisha was kind of in a bad mood that day and then two kings come to him and he he said he liked one of them he liked Jehoshaphat but he didn't like ahab's son because he knew ahab's son was a rascal just like Ahab and uh you know they they asked for the word of the Lord and Elisha's like he's like I don't want to do it but I'll do it for jehoshaphat's sake so if you just know the story I that's a great lesson you know as as as Christians we don't like the sins that Sinners do right we love the sinner but we hate the sin yeah amen H but sometimes we're moved if somebody has a request sometimes we're moved by that request and we've got to move past our feelings right and we've got to do the word of the Lord we've got to serve other people yeah and so we find Elisha doing that but I want you to notice did you notice how did the hand of God come upon him think about when the hand of God's come upon you healed you revealed the word to you you know where there's been numerous times in my life I felt like I'm just I'm doing exactly what God wants me to do right now I God is I I've just known it God is speaking through me right now you know I've just known that different times in my life uh different times when I cast out devils and uh preach different messages you know I've just known it I don't know how I I just you just know it am it's the hand of God that comes on you praise God amen well Elisha needs to prophesy he needs to use his gift right because they want they want thus said the Lord so what does he do does he uh does he go check the news no what does he do does he go call his dad or his uncle or his grandma no he says bring me a Minstrel and a Minstrel is a skilled player on the string instrument so maybe he brought a harp in maybe he brought some type of other I don't know other another string instrument but it's just a great reminder when we want God's hand on us we got to worship God Amen you got to start praising the name of the Lord amen hallelujah isn't that how David cast out the demons off of Saul he was all Saul was all discouraged and all he was so rebellious against God and these advisers say hey we know how to get the spirit off we know how to get the spirit off uh go get David praise God Amen go get the man who can play worship hallelujah praise God now hopefully the three songs we sang tonight if you had any uh frustration about today hopefully that set you free praise God don't you find that I find that all the time I'll go into a church service brother Aaron I'll be tired and discouraged I worked all day or I'm tired I'll be yawning but somebody if somebody plays the right song I'll just be off I'll be all happy again I I forget about all my trials amen amen because that's what music is there for amen music music is there to drive away doubts amen it's there to drive away sin and drive away unbelief and drive away all these things that's what music does it brings the hand of God on you praise God it's exactly right that's the word of God hallelujah so I just want to open up with this one just to show you you can be in a bad mood yeah we all get in bad moods sometimes right we don't like to admit it all the time but we we do well one way to get out of that is to start worshiping amen yes amen hallelujah absolutely and so uh and let me just encourage you this you're a new church you're a young young group of Believers as far as you're coming out to new new beliefs there's going to be Services where it starts off hard or starts off discouraged but keep keep doing the services Because by the end everything can change how many is a witness of that how many times have I seen I've been preaching 19 years I mean how many times you know people are tired and they're discouraged but you just press through you just keep trusting God you keep quoting God you you keep singing worship you keep giving God adoration but by the end everybody's happy and you walk out of there God has answered prayers people feeling they shaking hands hugging and and the love of God is back in the church praise God this is how God does it through worship thank you brother irin I appreciate that I I'm sorry your house is going to get kind of hot now so but at least we're downstairs amen hallelujah now there are many many scriptures uh I could go through I'm going to try to watch the time but before I get to that Saints I want to play this I thought this would be good um I want to play you a time where brother brandham and this goes back to two Thursdays ago brother brandham saw the Holy Ghost fall and you can hear people be born again after I preach here four people come up and told me after I preached last time last Thursday on the Holy Ghost four people come up and said that's exactly what they needed to hear so I thought well people really need to hear that let me play one where the Holy Ghost Falls so you can hear what it sounds like now remember it's got to fall the same way every time not the same sounds necessarily but it's got to produce something you can see and something you can hear no sure this is from the sermon God hiding himself and simplicity it was the first sermon brother R preached after the seventh seal after the the week of on the seals he went out to Albuquerque and he preached out there it is one of the most beautiful sermons I've ever heard brother man preach now there's a lot of there's lot of beautiful sermons brother preach but almost all of them right all of them we'd say but what I'm saying is this one has meant a lot to me so uh hopefully this will work now with the audio and I'll try to play it here truth way all I'm going to go back so help me the Holy Spirit here so help me Jesus Christ in here have I ever told you anything wrong is here but there's something so the people have been praying for the Holy Ghost maybe for 5 or 10 minutes he says he said I see a light circling right across the building back and forth now listen look people are shouting they're praying really loud there you go there you go that's way struck a little lady over here that's way struck another there you go you [Music] screaming saw the Holy Ghost anoint [Music] her was somewhere prise God there you areen it's like an emergency happened but it wasn't it was eternal [Applause] life another he sees the Holy Ghost drop on each of these people he's the way the truth the [Applause] life except that life fallen on others accept it while it's falling on others all the place holy I'm not excited I'm telling you the [Music] truth Glory that's right you can hear all the people praying right they're all praying some are louder than others but they're all praying stand there minutes stay right there he said you haven't been standing there five minutes yet I'll pause it right there isn't that amazing the people there's praying now some people feel led to pray out loud and that's what you need to do sometimes right we're going to prove that by the scripture God likes loud there's times God likes loud praise there's times God's like God likes loud praying loud worshiping okay and this is an atmosphere where the Holy Ghost Falls because the people are praying for it now later at once it quiets down brother Bram said I saw the Holy Spirit as a pillar of fire it fell on the woman he said and her hand shot up so before she screamed like it sounds like somebody's dying right well she was dying to herself spiritually she was dying out to her unbelief so the order was brother Ram saw the Holy Ghost and first she threw her hands up and then brother R said look there it is she's filled with the Holy Ghost and then she starts screaming so see the reaction was throw hands up Holy Ghost Falls and then she starts screaming and praising God and then another guy Scream another I think brother BR said five people got the Holy Ghost in that shower he called it we just got a shower an hour ago right an inch of water right that's what that was Hallelujah and a holy ghost shower Hallelujah but you got to create an atmosphere they were singing they were you can hear brother M he'll go he'll go down and sing you know I can hear my savior calling you know he just sings These simple hymns but the people are hungry for God oh then the Holy Ghost Falls when they really start worshiping God hallelujah all right now I just thought I'd share that just uh and you can go listen to that actually you know if you don't have time to listen to the sermon just go to the last 45 minutes of the sermon and you can hear them start praying the Holy Ghost Falls it's just a I've used it with our church uh we've had the Holy Ghost fall in our church you know numerous times I use it in other churches sometimes you need to hear what that sounds like right everybody's praying everybody's praying out loud there's voices remember like I remember I showed last time in Acts chapter 4 uh the Bible said they ought to lift their themselves up I'm sorry they lift up their their their voices in prayer in the prayer meeting and the Holy Ghost Shake took the building hallelujah amen they had to have a fiery prayer yeah they had to have a real sincere prayer like when I'm I'm not playing games God I want the Holy Ghost praise God you got to be sincere and so that's one example what it may sound like now um for time sake um if you got your Bible go to John 4:24 brother Daniel can you read that actually 23 and 24 Daniel uh John 4:23 and 24 I just got to hit the highlights because again uh I could I could preach hours and hours on there's so many verses about worship is that Albuquerque yes Albuquerque New Mexico yep it was uh March 12th I'm sorry April 12th April 12th 63 one of the Highlight sermons to me because you can hear the Holy Ghost fall brother R describes it it's a beautiful beautiful recording so brother Daniel when you're ready 23 24 but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshipers shall worship the father in the spirit and in TR for the father seeketh such to worship him God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship him in the spirit and in truth amen praise God now look Jesus says God is looking for true worshippers yeah amen right you ever think about what what is God looking for he's not looking for more money right he's he's not looking for he's not looking for any anything carnal he's looking for someone that will worship him yes amen but there's two elements you got to meet you got to have the spirit of God and you've got to have truth yes amen I think God is looking and smiling down on this little church here tonight by God's grace I believe that Hallelujah I wouldn't be here if I didn't believe that Hallelujah I believe that Thank God now the word Worship in the Old Testament just means to bow down or pay h to and homage means respect or admiration in the New Testament it means like uh it means to kiss like Kiss the hand or profound reverence or uh expressing respect or again homage so it's the highest adoration or the highest honor you could give that's worship now that's why we don't kiss our cars like oh I got a brand new car I'm going to kiss it what we do is we pray over our cars right that's why we don't kiss the ground or we don't uh you know we don't kiss the Pope's hand like a lot of mega churches have done I got they got they put it on YouTube we don't do that because that's a worship that's worship amen amen but now you get the idea so God wants us in other words like spiritually the Bible says in Psalm chapter 2 kiss the son lest he be angry so in other words we have to have not physical kissing but spiritual expressions of our love to God in other words we have to have the most sincere uh the most uh honorable worship to Jesus Christ Hallelujah and that's worship ex profound reverence and profound respect and there's two elements okay so worshiping in the truth is easy it's worshiping according to the Bible commands from this message because this message points us back to the Bible amen amen so no women preachers Catholic Church is the mother Harlot right the baptism Holy Ghost is three steps right just sanctification baptism Holy Ghost water baptism name of Lord Jesus Christ God is one person all those great Revelations right that's just scratching the surface So you you're getting the truth but now the spirit the Bible says to walk in the spirit you've got to do the truth yeah okay so to get the Holy Ghost on us we got to confess our sins and we've got to obey the word of God that's what the Bible says walk in the light as he's in the light how do you do that you confess your sins John chapter I'm sorry 1 John chap 1:7 confess your sins and then you walk in the light and the blood of Jesus Christ forgives us and we walk in the light and we have Fellowship one with another amen okay so those if you want to be a true worshipper you got to have the spirit and that's by obeying the truth repenting of your sins and then you have the truth by obeying the Revelation God's given to us in this hour all right so that's why you know a church that has a woman preacher right they'll they they can have the spirit there they can they can confess their sins except for the woman preacher and probably some other ones too but as but we'll see it with balum I mean as long as they repent of some sins God will come down and he'll he'll anoint them yeah amen but then they're then then she'll get up and preach well now they don't have truth so they're not true worshippers it's a false worship now can God still save them yes brother tells us God has children in the Methodist the Baptist Catholic he said as long as they trust as long as they're trusting in the blood of Jesus Christ he said they're saved yeah right so we know that but look they're they're not true worshippers but tonight church we can be true worshippers hallelujah amen see we got just got to obey the truth confess our sins do what God says and then uh we've got to uh get the spirit on us and then we got to worship right we got the spirit the holy spirit's on us we're walking the truth and we got the truth hallelujah we're teaching the truth believing the truth it's that simple praise God Amen and then then now thinking back to Elisha then we start praising God tonight and then what can happen the hand of God can drop on anybody here tonight amen if you're sick we can call you up we could pray trust God to heal amen if you're confused uh we can pray and ask God to take away the confusion and somebody will God will give somebody a Word of Wisdom like mother maybe brother Aaron has the answer to your question he can come up and say well this is what the word says and you say oh praise God now I'm all the confusion is left now I know exactly what the Bible says hallelujah I've had that numerous times in our church my daughter one time was so confused and and we I prayed and prayed I screamed at the top of my lungs I pray and she still wasn't better so after the church brother AR we Clos the service uh some sisters three or four sisters in our church come up and talk to her she was battling whether I have the Holy Ghost or not and three or four older sisters said you know we're just like you're just like us you know you're raising the message and you're young and you're having these mind battles but look at look at these scriptures these scriptures and my daughter she started weeping my oldest daughter and she left out of there totally free amen it wasn't Daddy's prayers that time that did it I tried with all my heart but it was God giving those sisters and God had told the sisters before the service God told one of the sisters you need to do something today she's like what do I the whole service she's like what do I do what do I do she didn't know she just knew God's leading me to do something and I believe it was a word of knowledge because knowledge is understanding yeah because she brought understanding to my daughter now my daughter understood yes I am born again and she's lived it ever since too she even lived it before that but see it don't have to be you know it could be a tongue interpretation or prophecy but God is going to send what the people need amen amen hallelujah but see we got to sing right we got to obey the truth we got to get under the spirit obey the spirit teach the truth and then we got to start singing and praising God and God's hand will come right down Hallelujah he'll say now I got John now I got Irvin now I got Daniel right in the palm of my hand now I can use them for God's glory for my glory right God Glory okay now I got a list here church and I'm not going to read we're not going to read all of them I have a list of uh let's see 11 12 12 13 14 15 different things about worship and they're straight from the Bible ways you can worship God all right and I'll tell you which ones the the saints were really blessed by last night uh the first one if you got your Bible Luke 19 uh the first one is pray raing or blessing god with a loud voice you can do that you're allowed to bless God with a loud voice you don't have to be quiet all the time in here right like you heard on that recording it sounded like a siren went off like a holy ghost siren think kind of sounds like a a fire department siren that sister you know right but it's letting the devil know you're getting washed out devil you're get your fire is getting put out devil right right Hallelujah prise God Amen that happens numerous happens numerous times in our church there's two or three sisters in our church that when the Holy Ghost Falls they scream and you think it would be bloody murder like if if you weren't like in the spirit but it's God ringing the bell Allelujah it's God alerting right alerting hell that their kingdom is coming down praise God amen amen amen now Luke 19:38 now here this is Jesus I believe it was Palm Sunday if I'm not mistaken and the the the people were crying out in verse 38 saying blessed be the king that cometh in the name of the Lord peace in heaven and glory in the highest and some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said Master rebuke thy disciples and he answered said to them I tell you that if thee should not I'm sorry if the should hold their peace the stones would immediately cry out now in other parallel passages uh the Pharisees are upset and said tell the children to stop crying tell them to stop shouting M and do Jesus walk over and said no you he he say well children you're a little out of order you should stop shouting for me you know you're too loud you you children need to quiet down is that what Jesus said no he said he said in other words he told the Pharisees said don't worry about it he said God's word is being fulfilled praise God this day the Zechariah scripture is fulfilled praise God Amen Hallelujah Jesus didn't tell him be quiet shut up don't don't shout so loud don't scream so loud Jesus said if they don't do it the rocks will cry out praise God Amen Hallelujah that's why we sing that that song Ain't No Rock going to cry in my place I love that song I'm not going to be quiet when I feel God leading me to be loud unless I'm trying to you know watch my voice I got to be careful see crying out and blessing God was part of fulfilling the word of God hallelujah now that's just one now the next one go to First Kings 8:54 First Kings 8:54 First Kings 8:54 this is Solomon right after the dedication and church I want you to know you're free to do these things during the praise and worship and then right after and really even during the sermon if the word of God is moving you you can shout praise God you can say bless the Lord amen how just however you feel led now none of us want to inter the sermon because the the Bible says the man of God he studies and prays he studies himself approved unto God in other words God approves his message in his prayer time in his study time and then he comes to the pulpit and really that's what that's God thus sayith the Lord right that's God thus sayith the word of God to us and we learn from that but if somebody needs a touch from God or or if if God is going to heal somebody maybe right during the sermon the Bible we read it last time remember in Acts chapter uh 10 the Bible said while Peter preached these words the Holy Ghost fell Hallelujah on them that heard the word praise God Amen I've only had that one time in my Ministry I was preaching and the people were so loud I just said okay I'm done you all can worship praise God and that's exactly what happened when Moses dedicated the Tabernacle thank you buddy and Solomon right the Holy Ghost fell and the priest couldn't even Minister amen hallelujah we almost had that last night it was such a wonderful time in the Lord hallelujah people are just shouting rejoicing standing claing in uh praising God worshiping it was just such a wonderful atmosphere I want you to notice here uh the ark is brought to the temple here in chapter 8 Solomon had just built the house I'm looking at brother Iran's book here in the the subtopics oh yeah and then he dedicates it in verse 22 now he gives us long prayer from verse 22 and notice verse 54 shows Solomon right after his prayer of dedication and it was so when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication before the Lord he arose from before the altar Lord from kneeling on his hand or his knees with his hands spread up to heaven so Solon prayed like this and was God mad at him no God was actually blessing him amen hallelujah so we got freedom to bless God loudly we got freedom to get on our knees and raise our hands to look up to heaven amen hallelujah and then in verse 55 he stood and blessed all the congregation with a loud voice see we got permission to use a loud voice hallelujah amen to bless God Amen right and then He blesses the Lord now that Lord capital L O R D it means Jehovah Jehovah means a self-existent one so Salomon would say Blessed Be Jehovah blessed be the self-existent one amen he doesn't need anyone to do anything he does whatever he once hallelujah amen he just filled this house hallelujah amen and Saints wouldn't you fall on your knees if God filled your house oh absolutely that's what really blessed the church last night I said it basically Solomon saw a miracle so if you saw a miracle wouldn't you fall on your knees and give God thanks for that amen hallelujah absolutely Solon just saw the Holy Ghost fall like a fire and it filled the Temple and so he said praise God I I'm going to dedicate this house to God that's all I can do what else can I do I'm a man he's God thank you Jesus and then He blesses god with a loud voice amen if you ever see a miracle it'll make you bless God with a loud voice hallelujah amen exactly right oh it's beautiful now we could go to many others uh 1 Timothy 2:8 Paul says I will therefore that men pray everywhere lifting up holy hands without wrath and doubting so notice he said everywhere he just didn't say Jerusalem right he just didn't say Jeffersonville he just didn't say uh Happy Valley I love brother Donnie that's why I said that but everywhere God wants you everywhere to lift up hands and pray and don't doubt God's word amen so I just want you to tell you that church like as soon as brother John starts the song service you know I just I just noticed God moved it on my heart and I just started raising my hands I'm praising God you have a right to do that yeah amen God wants you to do that yes because that what does this mean it means I Surrender and just like it was just like Solomon thanking God I bless you God oh Lord fill this place uh hear every prayer uh Lord when any when whenever anyone's in trouble may they look to this Holy Temple amen hallelujah and Jonah had to and Jonah experienced that he was in the belly of a whale but he believed Solomon's dedication so he looked back somehow in the the whale he figured out where Jerusalem was how did he do that it must have been God's Compass Hallelujah God's absolute Hallelujah he's in the belly of a whale with seaweed all over him he said I remember Solomon said if I just pray that Holy Holy Temple God will hear my prayer and God heard him on the third day he got vomited out and God gave him a second chance hallelujah amen how many how many believe God's a god of Second Chances don't be discouraged if you make a mistake don't be discouraged just remember now you're part of the club of Believers amen because all believers make mistakes amen and all believers even brother Jesse needs a second chance church we all run from the presence of the Lord at times brother brand admitted he did too there was numerous times he disobeyed the Lord remember down in South Africa he the angel told him to stay there in deran but he he left with the brothers wanted to do their denominational itinerary and he suffered for it right but that happens so he could learn but also so we can learn from that Amy amen don't take a denomination take thus sayth the Lord hallelujah now there's other ones uh Ezra 995 now this is a different this is a different whole different situation Ezra gets on his knees and lifts his hands again and he repents because he gets back to Jerusalem in Ezra's time and all and most of the Israelites had inter married and married Heathen women so he falls down for a different reason Solomon fell down at seeing a miracle but Ezra falls down and raises hands on seeing sin in the church so see God God wants you just to move be moved by the holy spirit amen sometimes you might pray with your hands up like sometimes you might pray like Ezra like oh God I'm in despair how could this happen how could this God forgive our church amen that's real yeah amen these are all expressions of worship and the best part is with Ezra and Salon they both went to God and God heard both their prayers amen right amen hallelujah so right after I got married I was in my wife and I got married in college this this was this is a falling down on my knees story so I we got married my senior year in college I was on scholarship so they just gave me free money it was awesome I guess it wasn't free I had to work for it I had to go to college football I had to go to class so I guess I did work for it a little bit but well after I graduated that's when the check ended okay so and we just found out my wife was expected and I didn't have a job and I couldn't find I the first couple places I I found I couldn't find a job and church I tell you I felt about this big you know what I did I went to my bedroom when my wife was at work my wife was working she had a job at a coffee shop and I didn't have a job now my job was just before was being a football player but now the checks are running out so you know what I did I went to my room locked the door I went just like this on my bed I said God I'd rather die than not have a job and provide for my wife and this baby on the way I just laid there and cried Church God's my witness within a few moments I got a phone call out there like oh and it's the grocery store the grocery store said oh yeah we like to hire you Jesse I said thank God Hallelujah prise you'll start on Friday I think that was a Wednesday the next day I got a phone call now that was only going to be he said but I can only give you 20 hours a week I said I'll take it I'll take anything praise God cuz I was just praying for something W I don't have nothing we had savings and things like that but I wanted a job the next day I got a call from a different employer and they said I'll give you 40 uh hours a week fulltime at Gojo and I was like Hallelujah I'm taking that one so I to call back that that grocery store and say I'm so sorry but they're giving me 40 hours they're like we understand we understand and I said Hallelujah two weeks later I was already working there Gojo I went to the uh the interview where I I'm currently working I walked in there for five minutes and the woman told me later I sat down for the interview they're asking me all these questions and all the teachers there were Christians I didn't even know it and it was a fem minute interview I walked out and then the the principal come running out and said Jesse we we are so excited to hire you uh you just got to go through one more interview and we've been looking for a candidate like you all these for for for all this time and and they you know you know I got hired then shortly after that and I've been there ever since just finished my 19th year and one of the teachers was there she said as soon as you walked in the door we knew you were a Christian she said there was some glow on you or something Hallelujah brother said the gospel goes amen hallelujah but where did it start with falling on my knees in desperation shutting myself in with God hallelujah I just want to show you there's different Expressions you can be on your knees you can stand and pray you you just want to pray with faith Hallelujah all these different way to [Music] worship go to uh see Hebrews uh Hebrews 1315 I loved how Brother John start off with thanks because that's part of this message it is God's requirement that we come to church and give thanks amen God's telling us you should come to church and give thanks find something to give thanks for amen I mean who's got a who's got a good working toilet at home you ought to give thanks what if that thing breaks you ain't going to be very thankful right especially I got eight kids at home and my parents think of how many fleshes we have I was just I was just taking you know my little boy he's almost three I was taking him to the restroom day I just I accidentally you know accidentally slipped on on that lever you know on the on the on the uh toilet and I thought I broke it I was like praise God it didn't break hallelujah thank God I'm thankful for everything I don't want to be ungrateful yeah amen I don't want to be spoiled brat Hallelujah I want to be a thankful Son of God hallelujah amen a thankful daughter of God is what we want to be amen now look verse 15 brother John you read that 13:15 by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually that is the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name Hallelujah so when you come to church when you come like this and you praise God and you literally say that Praise You Jesus can we say that together ready praise you jesuses now let's say thank you Jesus can wek you thank you Jesus you just gave God a sacrifice you didn't have to kill a lamb a bulock right a bird all you had to say was thank you Jesus and God looks up uh the Bible said it's a sweet smelling Savor un God you said Thank You Jesus and it goes up that worship goes up and God said that's wonderful praise and the same thing with your prayers the B David said let my prayer be like incense how many like to smell of incense there's some incenses that are really nice right and the Bible said when you pray and you tell God thank you Lord thank you Jesus it's like incense coming up and God said this is a good atmosphere now I can put my hand upon John now amen praise God now my hand can anoint brother Irving because he's given the sacrifice of praise amen that's that's what Elisha had to do Elisha had to get the menal out and then the spirit fell on him is that right am amen now he Elisha had to confess his sins of course he had to be obeying God but then when he started worshiping everything started changing then he said make the valley full of ditches in other words he told him thus sayi the Lord here's how you get out of your problem and god it worked amen they had to thus say the Lord and it worked hallelujah amen I got on my knees beg God for a job and it worked I still got it today praise God Amen it worked amen because God wants to be worshiped God wants to be loved and God wants you to know how to approach him yeah amen glory now I'm skipping because again there's just many many verses go to Ephesians 518 brother uran you want to read that Ephesians 5:18 I'll take a SI there thank you Mah you're going to get a reward brother in the name the Bible say

in all things Hallelujah no matter what you're going through try to give God thanks hallelujah amen in the name of Jesus Christ and the Bible said you'll be filled with the spirit amen hallelujah was yes Ephesians 5: 18- 20 brother beautiful portion of scripture it ties him perfectly with Elisha that's how he got filled with the spirit he said bring me a menst bring me somebody that complain brother Bram said he said if you can't be the prophet what' he say you be one of the instruments amen so brother said put yourself in Elisha's story you can't be Elisha you're not a prophet nobody's a prophet here right who foretells events in the name of the Lord nobody here right you might have had a dream that's a minor prophecy there which would be a gift but he said if you can't be Elisha which none of us can be be one of the instrument players amen hallelujah other words words you be a worshipper if you don't if you don't know how to play an instrument I don't brother B said then use this T string instrument called your hands he said this is a 10 string instrument and now you're playing the T string instrument he said that's what he said Hallelujah is that right amen if you if you can't do that at least use these two Str these vocal strings right here Glory Hallelujah everybody can be a menstral praise Goden if you can't be the prophet you be the minstrel he said and you'll see the hand of God come down amen amen now I love this one dancing um I preach on a little bit here but go to uh 2 Samuel 6 14 2 Samuel 6:14 and Friends brother brandham danced in his own own church he talks about it numerous times he was preaching on a New Year's Eve service I think I've told the story and he took a break he said I was preaching six hours on a Blackboard on the second coming of Christ he said I took a break these sisters got up and sing is special there's going to be a meeting in the air he was he was upset that they were dancing but then the holy spirit said well where is dancing in the Bible brother said that's a good question and then he he knew realized Miriam was the first one that danced in the Bible as far as recording and then he said well the my trouble is I just don't have enough Victory he said so I start tapping my foot and they were singing there's going to be a meeting in the air and then brother said before he knew it he was out there dancing with the sisters praise God he was out there praising God he said it didn't look too awful good he said but I I sure felt good afterwards amen hallelujah church I don't look good when I dance but I feel sure I I sure feel God's spirit afterwards Hallelujah cuz I'd rather dance for God than anything else praise God he's the only one we're dancing for praise God amen amen we danced last night boy I was sweating I'm still trying to recover but notice David just didn't do a little dance brother Aon would you read verse 14 Brother 2 Samuel 6:14 and David danced before the Lord with all his M and David was GED with a linen e amen how much strength did he use oh you know we danced last night until the girls you know I invite the little girls up they love to dance and I just I I dismissed church and I said okay you girls want to do another one yeah okay we did one and we did another one I said you girls so we danced until they said no we danced till like 9:30 last night cuz I had the scripture I want to see them dance with all their might I want to see that so they know what David they know what it's like to be David amen they finally said oh we've had enough I said well praise God now you dance with all your might hallelujah amen Jesus said let the little children come unto me Hallelujah the Bible said through the the the the cries of children God has perfected praise amen hallelujah and like I told you my daughter said the first service where I opened up the the church to dance in she said that was the greatest service she's ever been a part of she's 11 and she danced around there oh it was a great time in the Lord hallelujah screaming shouting praising God she danc last night see some people they God wants them to dance right there's a season for dancing and a season for morning and remember uh where's the next verse okay yeah verse 21 brother Aon can you read verse 21 and David said unto M it was before the Lord which chose me before thy father and before all his house to appoint me ruler over the people of the Lord over Israel therefore will I play before the Lord hallelujah so David said when I was dancing I wasn't dancing for you wife yeah honey I wasn't dancing for you you were embarrassed but I wasn't dancing for you I was dancing for the Lord amen I was dancing for Jehovah the self-existent one praise God Amen Hallelujah and he said I therefore I'm going to play before the Lord now play means to laugh it means to sing and dance to make sport so you're just having a you're just having a time of rejoicing hallelujah thank you Jesus it's such a joy now David was saying thank God the ark is coming back into its position Hallelujah the ark was the presence of God in other words thank God the presence of God is back in the church oh that's what Jesus wants tonight he wants his Spirit to be in this church hallelujah amen you know you know the story he talked to mall he said mall if you don't like that wait till you see me do it again yeah and that proves not every dance has to be spontaneous sometimes I plan it out I do sometimes I know I'm going to dance afterwards sometimes I don't sometimes the spirit just strikes you and I just start praising God thank you Jesus other times I know I'm going to dance cuz David couldn't don't we all believe Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and tomorrow tomorrow forever that's right he's the same amen he's not different he's the same hallelujah amen if David could dance under under the law what could we do under grace amen Oh Glory all right now here's one uh Psalm Psalm 46 so so far I've talked about being loud dancing lifting hands getting on knees it's all okay how many can say Amen to that amen all these are okay these are Servants of God these are people that are pleasing God now in Psalm 46 verse 10 and 11 here's scripture where there's times it's okay to be quiet yeah Psalm 4610 and 11 I want to actually turn there myself here okay so if you look at look at verses 1 and two God's a very present help and trouble therefore we will not fear so this Psalm is written in a time where they're being very fearful and church how how many experienced fear this week any that's okay to be honest this song this is a song this is a song written so when you're fearful you'll remember to do what the song says which verse 10 11 verse 10 says be still and know that I am God I will be exalted among the Heathen I exalted in the earth they were afraid of the Heathen right they're afraid of all the armies and Nations around them but D but by the Holy Spirit I'm sorry this song's of the sons of Kora not David Kora sons of Kora verse 11 the Lord of hosts is with us the god of Jacob is our refuge saah isn't that beautiful seah means stop and meditate on that other words when you're fearful moms or dads Grandpa's grandmas when you're fearful you can be still and know God is here he's the Lord of Angel hosts amen he's the God of Angel Armies there's angels that surround us praise God amen hallelujah amen so see there when when you're going through a good time you want to use a loud voice you you see a miracle you want to shout you want to get on your knees you want to praise God lift up holy hands but in a moment of fear it's okay just to be quiet say I know God is with me I know God's here he will not forsake me Hallelujah he's the God of Angel Armies as the song says amen and I know he watches over me see there's times to be loud praise him there's times to be quiet the next one there's even a time to be quiet when you're battling Suicidal Thoughts First Kings 19:12 I'm not going to ask anybody to raise their hands but if uh some people battle that I've never battled that you know that Spirit maybe I battled different spirits but we all have to battle and overcome Spirits amen someone's going to overcome the spirit of suicide hallelujah amen just like somebody's got to overcome the spirit of fear or or greed or lust or Pride amen somebody's got to overcome it praise God Amen First Kings 19:12 this is Elijah Elijah is in the cave and he just asked God God will you take my life in other words I'm battling Suicidal Thoughts he just killed 450 Bale prophets we know the story right M 450 people he executed that were demon-possessed people and then Jezebel makes a threat and said I'm going to kill you by this time or whatever and he said brother brother shows that's what happens when the anointing leaves you you can kill 450 but the threat of one woman makes you run away see the anointing left him he just killed 450 why is he scared of one yeah because the anointing leaves and we got to pray till we get it back and the church said amen amen we got to get back in the spirit see go God will anoint us his hand will come upon us we'll do the works of God but then he'll pull it back and now let's see how you respond how you going to respond to your trials now amen amen hallelujah verse 12 First Kings 19:12 sister Miram you want to read that for us verse 12 and after the earthquake fire the Lord was not in the fire and after the fire a still small voice thank you now let's all get real quiet for a moment if there's a lot of noise can you hear a still Small Voice no so Elijah's in this cave I thought I heard the clock to that's when you really know it's quiet you can hear the Click Click you can hear the seconds take by I can hear now Elijah's in the cave he's like oh God I want to die just take me home right now I don't want to live battling suicidal thoughts and then he hears an earthquake but God wasn't in that and then he sees Fire Imagine looking out the cave he sees fire god wasn't in that he's like I just want to die maybe I should commit suicide and then God said what doest thou here Elijah and that is that amazing you want to take your life you're batt in suicide and God says what are you doing here yeah amen what you doing right Adam Where Art Thou God knew where he was yeah but God wants you to think about the things you're what are you actually planning on doing yeah amen what condition are you in God didn't come by a loud earthquake or a huge hot fire like a pillar of fire he come by a whisper John the voice of the Lord calls you to do this it still small voice he was he didn't he wasn't on his knees with his hands raised he wasn't shouting and clapping like David he was in a suicidal battle so see how there's times we need to be still and know that he's God Amen Hallelujah now for me I have to remember that too I feel like if I'm not dancing John I feel like I'm failing God if I don't see a miracle every service brother Aaron I feel like have I failed God I've got to battle that side I don't really battle the suicidal thought you I haven't seen a a miracle for like the last month what something wrong with me maybe there would be you know maybe I got to overcome something but here you can experience God in a quiet place as well and God is pleased with that worship God was pleased with Elijah he said oh God I'm the only one left there are seven other thousand people that are just just like you in the message amen praise God well God I'm the only we're just a small Message Church in Junction City there's nobody else I got 7,000 other message churches you're not alone praise God hallelujah amen thank you Jesus I got some food for you outside it's going to give you strength to go for 40 days hallelujah I got some spiritual food in due season for you amen hallelujah like brother said when he preached the revelation of the future home he said I I I fed on that experience for two weeks he said now he used at least eight details from Clarence Larin but the one detail he said he got from God if you listen carefully was that the Earth is renewed in three stages he says what is that water Noah the blood of Jesus Christ shed on the earth and then fire and I looked I have Lin's book Lin didn't teach this three steps of three stages of justification sanctification baptism holy ghost that was a revelation from God so all these accusers are misunderstanding but said I got this message from God it wasn't lens's details that was from God it was the earth goes through three steps to be perfected just like you and I go through three steps to be perfected we're Justified we're baptized then we're Sanctified all of our bad habits cleaned out and then we're filled with the Holy Ghost and Fire hallelujah thank God exactly right amen amen but just like the devil the devil's the accuser of the Brethren that's what they're going to do they're going to find little things to accuse that means they never understood the message to begin with amen amen if you can walk away from these Revelations you never had to begin with brother Aaron because the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against this Revelation Hallelujah and the gates of hell are taking them down into sinful lives and cursing brother brandom how could you curse another child of God yeah amen that's it's like Jesus said they have ears but cannot hear all they can hear is human mistakes and human uh just Humanity of brother R they can't see the god that points to the word of God they can't see the revelation of the word of God but thank God we see it amen all right now we're I'm I got to I got to get moved on because I've preached 53 minutes that's a long time we're not going to read these but in 2 Chronicles 23 and 25 David institutes instruments into the worship and he also talks about him in Psalms 149 and Psalms 150 so let's go to Psalm 149 and I know church this is a process you're a brand new church you're coming out of a very legalistic thing so over time you're going to be free you're going to develop more more freedom you're going to be you're going to feel more freee to raise your hands you're going to feel more free to stomp your foot you're going to free you're going to feel more free to clap you're going to feel more free to kind of dance and maybe you'll start going side to side like this then pretty soon you'll do some spins and then pretty soon you'll be running around the building hallelujah thank you Jesus you're just going to grow in your freedom all the time amen that's what I see in my life Hallelujah I'm growing in the freedom of the Lord where the spirit of the Lord is there's what bondage no where the spirit of the Lord is there's liberty hallelujah amen I'm going to play you some Liberty songs here pretty soon by God's grace church anything you do Saints to praise God anything you express to worship God loves it when you're raising your hands God says I love that if you're on your knees cry praising God worshiping God God said love that when you're singing a song God said I love that he said I take pleasure in that when when that when that brother I got the scripture later when that brother says amen he said God said I take pleasure in that he agrees with my word all all your expressions of worship brother Urban God loves it in fact he Delights in it yeah that's why we got to give God more praise he he Delight more in our praise right look at verse one praise ye the Lord sing of the Lord a new song and his praise in the congregation of the Saints so as you go on God will teach you new songs verse two let Israel rejoice in him that made him so he rejoice in God rejoice in your creator let the children of Zion be joyful in their kings so see God Wants You joyful in him it's a joy to have Jesus as your king amen verse three let them Praise Him in the dance that means allow allow God God's people to praise him in the dance how come some people won't allow it because that's the Antichrist Spirit right this is the holy spirit saying praise me dance for me let them dance let them sing praises unto him with a timberl in the harp so the tambourine right somebody needs a tambourine in here next time or in the future right you'll grow in that let them do it amen David saying the Holy Spirit through through David saying let them praise God Be Joyful that you're a Christian amen hallelujah amen be happy he's God saved you be happy he rescued you out of man-made organization and man-made Creeds amen Rejoice that you can worship God in the spirit and Truth amen now here's where I'm going to this is what I saying brother Iran verse four this is you brother for the lord taketh pleasure in his people

happy or getting ice cream I don't know and they're just or you got them a a Christmas present or a birthday present and they're just like what oh my don't you take pleasure in that I love when my children get excited they can't wait to open their present on Christmas I can't I I love watching that I take pleasure in their pleasure Oh Glory and God takes pleasure in your worship Hallelujah and let me say like this the greatest pleasure you'll ever have in life is worshiping Jesus Christ don't tell me there's a greater pleasure there's not worshiping God is the greatest blessing you'll ever have in your life so if you haven't danced Yet brother Daniel if you do it'll be the greatest pleasure in your life Hallelujah if you haven't shouted brother John or if you you haven't uh you haven't got on your knees and praise God it'll be the greatest pleasure because what could be greater than praising your creator amen can anybody think of anything greater making $10 million would that be greater and going to hell no going to heaven or worshiping Jesus amen the lord taketh pleasure in his people he will beautify the meek with salvation let the sa be joyful and Glory let them sing aloud upon their beds all right so when the kids go into bed you can lay down with them give them a good night kiss and say let's sing a good night song only believe or the great physician let's sing on our beds is that what the Bible says now how many need to do that more I need to do that more now we always sing like out as a family we sing out in the living room and then they go lay down but I like how the Bible said sing in your beds too amen all right um now if you go down to chapter 150 it just verse one and two and three just say praise him praise him praise him in the church Praise Him in

God's grace oh I love it I love it brother look how he handles it he said oh what a nice spiritual lift now he gets right to the word of God though right special's over now it's time for the word I think it's beautiful let's say praise the Lord can we praise the Lord so people can't tell me oh well know you can't sing a fast song like that and you can't scream during the song people can't tell me that because I've already heard brother R talk about it he said don't just get religion in your head get it all over you praise God Amen I just showed you in the Bible David danced with all of his might praise God all of his might all of his strength he danced for God Amen Hallelujah that the thing is people are usually uh there's a couple reasons they don't worship either they're are they they're already making love like Samson made love to Delila right so message people will give their strength to another lover an idol in their life yeah so they don't when they come to church they don't have any love to give for God because they've already given it to pornography or movies or lust whatever right amen or the other one is fear what are they going to think of me what are they it doesn't matter what they think of you like David said I wasn't dancing for you wife mall I was dancing for God hallelujah and that's what I had to overcome was was caring what other people think I mean I do respect people I I do care what they say but ultimately I'm here to give God praise amen and God Delights in My Worship praise God he told me let them dance let them praise the Lord in the dance hallelujah amen is that is this helpful to anybody tonight by God's grace absolutely so this is what I'm saying this is what I want this church to grow into because that's the word of God that's what the Bible says I couldn't find I was listening to a quote yesterday or listening to a sermon yesterday and brother Ram got up and they were singing a fast song I can't remember what what it was we sang it last night at church but I can't remember he said he said this is Pentecost he said they start laughing and stoping this is It's The Joy yeah sure it's the sincere worship you're worshiping in spirit and in truth amen and brother R will make it like this he said you got to shake off your starchiness where just you're still all the time yes brother he said shake off that starchiness and just enjoy God just love God just worship God just be in love with Jesus Hallelujah brother brand said if your religion is dead he said go bu it that's what he said you got a dead Rel religion go buried in the yard and get a living one amen M's alive brother Irvin Hallelujah God is alive he's real hallelujah hallelujah thank you Jesus and I know that's what you guys need right I need it too we all need it when we come up I keep out denomination too not not as strict as yours but I needed to be free and God showed me how to be free you know how we get free by the word of God Amen by worshiping right Spirit truth worship and then God's spirit comes down on you amen amen now I'm going to try to finish up I've already been an hour and 10 minutes this is longer than I thought I was going to go tonight so there's verses where you're allowed to shout and clap in Psalm 3211 and Psalm 471 yeah let's read uh yeah let's fin yeah let's finish with those Psalm 3211 I'll have to maybe finish in two weeks or something like that whatever brother irvan might have on his heart I just felt led to preach this tonight there's so much more I could do well oh yeah if you want a fuller teaching on it you I'll give brother irin the link to our Ser our service last night I preached the whole thing last night sure if you if you want to do that you don't have to but it's just one option uh Psalm 30211 brother every you want to read that for us brother then brother John I'll have you read the next one whenever you're ready brother be glad in the Lord and rejoice ye righteous and Shout for Joy all ye that are upright shout for Joy now it depends are you upright or not are you doing the right things or not amen we all make mistakes so we all got to say sorry but once you say sorry now you're upright again the righteous stumbles seven times right we stumble but he gets up again the Bible says amen and now once I got up and I said sorry now I'm righteous again I'm upright I'm not laying down I'm upright so let that person shout for Joy because God is with you hallelujah amen amen Saints you can tell the devil I got permission to shout for Joy the Bible tells me to do it Hallelujah the Bible tells me let them dance the Bible tells me to raise your hands and shout and cry out to God hallelujah amen Satan wants to keep everybody just fearful or like Samson giving their love they he gave us his body to God but he didn't give his heart he gave his heart to Delila San wants us to give our hearts to our jobs or Hearts to some other lover or something like that but we got to give Jesus Christ everything praise God amen amen he's worthy yes he is amen he said love me with all your mind soul body and strength and then brother John would you want to read psalms 471 pretty close to that one oh clap your hands all ye people shout unto the Lord with a voice of Triumph what's Triumph Victory amen so God's people need to have victories when you get a victory when you can be thankful for something you ought to shout for that right God doesn't want his people to have voice of losing right or the voice of failure that's not going to make you shout you got to have a voice of Triumph oh we this week God helped us God blessed us God brought us through another week he helped us overcome the enemy this week I'm shouting with Triumph hallelujah amen hallelujah and he says clap your hands all you people while you're shouting with Triumph see that's why clapping is a sign of Triumph right we you know brother BR says he said all in his day he said the soldiers would clap and sing to encourage themselves before going out to battle right you can see I've seen a couple on YouTube they got this the American Soldier singing uh Days of Elijah these are the days it's got like 10 million views that's a pretty awesome video and they're getting themselves ready to go out to war preparing the word of the Lord L that's how they get themselves ready that's how they worship how much more should we do that too praise God Amen we're not fighting a natural enemy it's a spiritual enemy amen we need the victory praise God let's have a voice of Triumph not a voice of complaint yeah amen or voice we don't want a voice of failure or we don't want a voice of surrender to the enemy we want to overcome the enemy now in closing I got verses about God wants you to say Amen the Bible tells you to say Amen to the word of God uh another way to worship God is fasting meals or you can feast and invite people that can't afford to pay you back invite Jesus said invite them when you have a feast that's a way to worship God Amen receiving the word with gladness Acts chapter 2 in other words if you enjoy what was preached tonight you should leave out of here happy you should be glad that you came to the house of God Amen that's what act chapter 2 said they were they that received the word gladly were baptized yeah and they continued in the apostles Fellowship Doctrine and they gathered together for communion as well these are all expressions of worship that we should give to show God our love and dedication so in summer your bodies can dance or be still they can stand or kneel or bow anytime in the service you can leap or not leap David leaped with all his might brother Aaron read it he leaped yeah you can have hands up or hands down your choice you can play instruments literal instruments or you can play these instruments you can tap your feet brother Ram said you can Stomp Like the T like the tambourine bee right you can fast or you can Feast you guys you like to Feast Sundays after service right God bless your wives and uh daughters for making all that delicious food you got you can clap for joy and you physically gather with Saints you have community feet washing and and uh and wine and bread and you do water baptisms in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah now before we close any questions on anything I've said or anything uh you guys want to ask me scripturally about uh worship I know I couldn't get to everything but I just wanted you show you a broad view God loves all this worship he takes pleasure in it he takes pleasure he loves when people are joyful when they're thankful it's a sacrifice of praise when you dance you said I take joy in that Hallelujah any questions obiously Freedom takes a little bit of time yes yes I just as a testimony to that the first time I ever went anywhere and the way you sat there trying to explain how it was how the devil wants religious people that would have been wild in the church I came from I'm saying you just didn't talk you sat there and you were quiet it was irreverent to be anything but um but I realized in my heart the first time I went to the men's encounter out in Lebanon Missouri and they did praise and worship and I mean they did defin I mean you know Apostolic Pentecostal what do you call it and they're up there you know and just I mean anyway I
