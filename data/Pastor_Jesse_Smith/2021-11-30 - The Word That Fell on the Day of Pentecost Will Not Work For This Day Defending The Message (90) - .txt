Description:
Twice in 1965, William Branham stated the Word that fell on the Day of Pentecost will not work for this day. What does this mean? This video clarifies the meaning, proving we still need the baptism the Holy Ghost, but we also need the prophetic rapture-related Scriptures fulfilled in our lives in order to go in the first resurrection, or rapture. 

Brother Branham's accusers have misinterpreted his quotes by not listening to their contexts. Will they repent of their slander against Brother Branham?

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] greetings friends in the matchless name of the lord jesus christ what did brother branham mean in his 1965 quotes saying the word that fell on the day of pentecost will not work this day friends when taken in context the short and concise answer is that brother branham's statement simply means the verses of acts 2 verse 4 and joel 2 28 are not rapture verses the bride of christ will need the anointing and revelation of the prophetic rapture verses which include 1 thessalonians 4 verses 13 through and first corinthians 15 verses 51-54 in order to be raptured of course though before she's raptured she will need the infilling of the baptism of the holy ghost in her soul the accusation brother brahms accusers those who have left his bible-based message have grossly misinterpreted this quote and claim it means william branham taught the crucifixion of jesus christ does not work for today nor does the filling of the holy ghost work for today and brother brahms followers must trust in him as a hierarchical priest to intercede between them and god here's the quote from one of brother graham's accusers and i quote doesn't that minimize christ's suffering on the cross to become that perfect sacrifice for us the thing that's always bothered me about that in terms of the message is so now we take christ and say his sacrifice to usher in a new relationship based on grace with god based on the holy spirit based on the leadership of the holy spirit it absolutely is minimized particularly when william branham says that the spirit of pentecost did not work for the day today then if that's true then the crucifixion of christ didn't work for today right end quote obviously brother rams accusers have greatly misunderstood this quote the truth from the quotes and their contexts let's listen to both quotes regarding the word that fell at pentecost and note their context brother branham was not doing away with the crucifixion or the day of pentecost the baptism of the holy ghost no sir experienced was for pentecost this is for the bride going home to the right we got something different the pentecostal represented that again we're in the bride age do more than the word of noah would work in the days of moses no more than moses the law would work in the time of paul here you're trying to tell me you're a dad to that and you cannot have that church you i'm speaking tonight across the nation if you separate yourself from denomination and all the filth and things of this world and all those things that keeps you in man-made creeds and orders and things like that you separate yourself look up get ready the fire is pride should be made more if immortally immortality be changed in a moment in a twinkling of god we which are alive and remain shall not forbid them which are asleep but you see what does that the message it went for then the englishman tried to hold that same message for today that won't work today it won't work how would what if moses would have come with noah's message we'll build a heart and float down the nile it wouldn't have worked and neither would jesus message ever work of moses and neither will wesley's message ever work in luther or luther's west message vice versa and today where our last great reformation was pentecost and today we're moving from that and a pentecostal message won't mix with this because it's another day it's all the word of god but it's building like the feet arms coming up it's farming a bride for the rapture they don't don't displace that people back there they live for their message all them will come out within the bride now that we've heard the context of these two quotes we can easily see how brother brown's accusers misunderstood brother branham brother branham was clearly referring to the rapture scriptures that need to be fulfilled will brother branham's accusers repent of their misunderstanding and slander brother branham it's likely they will not but we can pray for them in the holy name of jesus and ask god to help them to learn to repent and humble themselves and admit that they're wrong now let's hear some quotes from brother branham that say salvation is the same as it's always been by jesus's blood and the holy ghost experience today is the same as the day of pentecost and is needed to go in the rapture and that people can be saved outside of brother graham's ministry but of course anyone who would deny the baptism of the holy ghost cannot make the rapture according to jesus's teachings in matthew chapter 25 regarding the parable of the wise and foolish virgins the same holy ghost that fell on the day of pentecost is the same holy ghost that's here now he's the satisfied potion because he is the word that's right the holy ghost wrote the word he interprets the word now i believe in good conduct if you are saved you will do righteously we have already gone over that but let me tell you now salvation is not jesus plus it is jesus alone salvation is of the lord from start to finish it is all god let his life be in me let it be his blood that cleanses me let it be his spirit that fills me let it be his word in my heart and mouth let it be his stripes that heal me let it be jesus and jesus alone not by works of righteousness which i have done no sir christ is my life amen what about the people that believe in the lord now and don't and not the way you preach they don't have to believe this they don't have to be the way i preach it see don't have to believe that for the last day message will they be saved yes if they believe the lord see and if they if they disagree and say i don't believe he's the word i don't believe it this is right i don't believe in the baptism the holy ghost that shows where they're headed for the tribulation period but those who can accept the word in its fullness not me preaching it because it's a bible says so those who accept that is free because the words already been judged so it's so thrilling always told the people when i crossed the line on the other side i like to stand up and sing amazing grace how sweet the sound the savior like me grace precious grace to know is what saves us by grace are you saved through faith another example of the need to take the full context one time years ago i was in a minister's meeting and one of the ministers shared a quote from brother branham and after reading a portion of the quote he went on for maybe 5 10 or 15 minutes about why he thought this quote was confusing i had not heard the quote before so i didn't know how to answer but when i went home i went and read the quote myself and found that if the brother had just kept reading the next sentences and the next paragraph his question would have been answered this is the same mistake brother iran's accusers made with a quote in question about the word that fell on the day of pentecost won't work for today had they just listened to the remainder of the quote kept reading kept listening they would have understood the context was about the rapture and not about salvation or the baptism of the holy ghost they would understand we still need the crucifixion of jesus christ that word still works for today for our salvation but we need more of jesus's word regarding the rapture in order for us to go in the rapture just like noah needed word for his day to be safe in the ark and moses needed the word for his day to bring the people out of egypt the quote that the minister wondered about was from things that are to be 1965 first let's listen to the little snippet of the quote that the brother read but failed to read on you see well i prophesy ephesus so did balaam that has nothing i got the baptism in the holy spirit that still has nothing to do with it that's only a temporal gift for you so now that we've heard the quote the brother was asking the question how can you have the baptism of the holy spirit and it's just a temporal gift for you he was wondering if someone can fall away after having the baptism of the holy spirit well of course if he would just kept reading he would have known that brother branham was talking about the anointing the holy ghost in the human spirit and not the soul so in other words the baptism of the holy ghost in the soul is a permanent anointing not a temporal and it lasts until the day of our redemption according to ephesians 4 verse 30 and numerous scriptures about the seal of god now let's listen to the quote in this full context so you can see the brother would have gotten his answer if he just kept reading the quote and understood the context but then failed to read on or listen on you see well i probably saw episodes so did balaam that has nothing i got the baptism in the holy spirit that still has nothing to do with it that's it's only a temporal gift for you the real gift is your soul right there the man that was born of god and that controls the whole thing to the word of god and the will of god and there you grow up see then you are son and daughter of god you're a child of god friends as more and more accusers rise up against brother branham we must remember to take everything brother brahm said back to the bible and also when listening to brother branham listen to the full context of the quotation we know the holy ghost is with us and he will help us rightly divide the word of god and according to jesus he will guide us into all truth in closing i hope this short video has been a blessing it's been an exercise and rightly dividing the word of truth it's likely accusers of brother branham are only going to multiply so we're in need of more humility and also the anointing of the holy spirit to go back to the scripture search the scriptures daily and yield to the holy spirit as we learn to rightly divide the truth regarding all the brother brahms bible doctrines and statements and remember brother branham said the most important thing of today is a minister who can rightly divide the word of god so may the holy spirit help us to search for the truth here's the a good quote preacher i admire them and their gift is far beyond anything can be done in anything else is a preacher a man who knows how to rightly divide the word of god if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me god bless you and may jesus christ be the desire of your heart
