[0:00] [Music]
[0:02] and just remember from the West will
[0:04] come a white horse rider amen we'll ride
[0:08] this Trail
[0:10] again it's a
[0:13] promise greetings friends in the
[0:16] matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[0:18] the purpose of this video is to answer a
[0:20] question I received from numerous
[0:22] viewers and brothers and the question is
[0:25] about the quote from brother Brandon
[0:26] where he says I'll ride this Trail again
[0:29] I want to give my best understanding on
[0:32] this question and I could be wrong of
[0:34] course but I'm just going to give my
[0:36] best understanding by the grace of God
[0:38] this is a subject I'd like feedback on
[0:41] I'd like thoughts from other believers
[0:43] who study the word of God the quotes and
[0:46] pray it's similar to that of the seven
[0:48] Thunders I'm open to further Revelation
[0:50] by the grace of God hi friends I'm Jesse
[0:53] Smith pastor bride of Christ Fellowship
[0:55] here in akan Ohio we're coming up on our
[0:56] 18th year anniversary by the grace of
[0:59] God and I defend the Bible revelations
[1:01] that Jesus Christ revealed to his true
[1:04] Prophet The Late William brandom 1909
[1:07] and 1965 and I defend brother brandom's
[1:10] Godly Christian character here's the
[1:12] simple order of this video first I'll
[1:15] review the question that I've received
[1:17] and I'll State my general answer second
[1:20] we'll look at the timeline of quotes
[1:22] from God's Prophet brother brandham and
[1:24] play them and third we'll finish with
[1:27] two thus sayith the Lord's statements
[1:29] brother brandham spoke out west in the
[1:31] four or five sermons he preached before
[1:34] the Lord took him home and the reason I
[1:36] say four or five is if you call the last
[1:39] recording a full sermon or not communion
[1:41] from December 12th
[1:44] 1965 so let's begin let's look at the
[1:46] question from numerous people and my
[1:48] answer first question I got was from a
[1:50] brother in December
[1:52] 2021 will you please tell me your view
[1:55] on this subject of I'll ride this Trail
[1:57] again because the prophet told us with
[1:59] thus the Lord in the first quote and
[2:02] he's referring to a quote from the God
[2:04] of this evil age August 1st
[2:07] 1965 so here's my answer by God's grace
[2:11] it's one of three possibilities and of
[2:13] course there could be more possibilities
[2:15] it's either one brother brandham will
[2:17] come back from the dead and do a
[2:19] preaching tour or two brother bram's
[2:22] Ministry would continue in the bride
[2:24] through the Holy Ghost anointing upon
[2:27] other living men like Elisha continued
[2:31] Elijah's Ministry and fulfill Revelation
[2:34] 10:
[2:37] 8-1 or third brother Brighton was going
[2:40] to speak with authority out west before
[2:43] he died and the Lord took him to
[2:46] heaven so I personally think the second
[2:48] possibility is the most likely
[2:51] fulfillment of this statement arod this
[2:54] Trail again but it also could be a
[2:55] combination of the second and third it
[2:58] could have been brother bram's Ministry
[3:00] was going to continue through other
[3:02] anointed men and he was also going to
[3:04] speak with authority out west before he
[3:06] passed away and also friends there's
[3:08] about six quotes on this topic so if
[3:11] there's others please let me know five
[3:13] of the quotes say I'll ride this Trail
[3:16] once more or I'll ride this Trail again
[3:18] and then the six quote doesn't say I'll
[3:20] ride this Trail again but brother random
[3:22] does talk about two brothers who had the
[3:25] same dreams about him it was the quote
[3:28] the brother mentioned from from the God
[3:30] of this evil age
[3:31] 1965 where brother random said it's thus
[3:34] say the lord it's something coming forth
[3:36] from God it's also interesting to note
[3:38] friends that the last time brother Ram
[3:40] spoke about this subject of I'll ride
[3:42] this Trail again was the evening of
[3:45] November 28th 1965 so in the last month
[3:48] or so the last 27 or 28 days of brother
[3:52] Adam's life and in this final five
[3:54] recordings on tape he never mentioned
[3:57] I'll ride this Trail again during that
[3:59] final month or so of his life here on
[4:01] Earth by God's grace now let's do the
[4:04] timeline of quotes from brother brandom
[4:05] and play them so we can have a good
[4:08] understanding or general understanding
[4:10] of his statements about this subject the
[4:13] first quote is from God of this evil age
[4:15] August 1st the morning service
[4:18] 1965 brother Rand said something's just
[4:20] getting ready to happen I know it talks
[4:23] about Junior Jackson having a dream and
[4:25] another man from Oregon he says I don't
[4:27] know the interpretation that's important
[4:29] to to note he's waiting on the Lord but
[4:31] it is thus sayith the Lord something
[4:34] coming forth from God I don't know what
[4:36] it is and he says the holy spirit is
[4:39] withholding the interpretation thereof
[4:41] from me but I know God is fixing to do
[4:43] something it'll be glorious in our eyes
[4:45] let's listen to the
[4:47] quote now I want to say that there's
[4:50] something just getting ready to
[4:53] happen I know it many of you here
[4:56] remember when brother Junior Jackson
[4:59] come to me a little bit before going
[5:01] towards Arizona of a dream he had a
[5:04] strange thing how many remembers that
[5:07] and the lord gave us the interpretation
[5:09] and it happened to the
[5:11] letter now he just had another dream
[5:15] something and the strange thing a man
[5:18] was here the day from
[5:20] Argan doesn't hardly know me and was
[5:24] dream the same dream about the junior
[5:27] Jackson
[5:28] dream and and and come to me I don't
[5:32] know the
[5:34] interpretation I'm waiting for the Lord
[5:36] but I know it's going to be something
[5:38] from God just remember that thus sayeth
[5:42] the Lord it's something coming forth
[5:45] from God I don't know what it is really
[5:49] striking very
[5:51] striking frankly according to the the
[5:54] dreams that both man one of them he
[5:58] might be a Baptist Pres tan he might be
[6:01] sitting here this morning I don't know
[6:02] he's here of the day I don't know the
[6:05] man but he told the dream with tears in
[6:08] his
[6:09] eyes and shooking he come all the way
[6:11] from Argan here to express it brother
[6:14] Jackson come in like man this morning
[6:16] one man not knowing the other one
[6:18] thousands of miles from the other and
[6:20] both dreams just exactly on the same
[6:23] thing so the holy spirit is withholding
[6:26] the interpretation thereof from me I
[6:28] don't know what to tell the man but I
[6:31] know God is fixing to do something and
[6:34] it'll be glorious in our
[6:37] eyes the next quote is from August 15th
[6:40] and knoweth it not
[6:42] 1965 brother BR gives us more details
[6:44] about the dreams in the dreams brother
[6:47] Brandon is dressed in white riding a
[6:49] white horse he's dressed up like an
[6:51] Indian chief he's got Authority in his
[6:54] words he screamed I'll ride this Trail
[6:57] once more it seems like brother Brandon
[6:59] was also so withstanding another person
[7:01] a false prophet and again brother
[7:03] Brandon was asked what does it mean and
[7:05] he says I don't know so it seems like
[7:07] there's at least three dreams or
[7:10] statements about brother brandom being
[7:12] dressed in white on a white horse in
[7:14] this quote junior Jackson Leo Mercer and
[7:18] Roy borders so Junior Jackson's dream
[7:21] said brother Ram took to the skies and
[7:24] you were gone towards the West so this
[7:26] statement makes me think it it might
[7:28] mean brother Brandon was going to preach
[7:30] out west and then die the Lord was going
[7:33] to take him home uh Leo Mercer said he
[7:36] never heard such a command so again
[7:38] brother Brandon giving commands makes me
[7:39] think of thus sayith the Lord commands
[7:41] because there could be no greater
[7:42] Authority than saying thus sayith the
[7:44] Lord then Roy borderers says you were
[7:47] packed toward the west and then but I
[7:50] think this dream was more about brother
[7:51] random going out west to get meet the
[7:53] angels and then come back east and
[7:55] preach the Seven Seals but again I could
[7:57] be wrong let's listen to the quote from
[7:59] and knoweth it not then he started
[8:01] holding his heart to cry right there in
[8:03] the room he said Mr brandom I realize I
[8:07] got to stand before
[8:08] God he said I don't know whether I sleep
[8:11] or what happened he said I dreamed I'm
[8:14] going to say as asleep and I dream
[8:17] said said a Bo shook the whole earth
[8:20] said the Earth shook from my feet I said
[8:23] I after quit shaking I Heard a Voice and
[8:25] said brother BR was your voice said I
[8:27] know it just something said that to him
[8:29] said he said I'll ride this Trail once
[8:33] more instead I started looking up the
[8:35] rock like this looked on into past the
[8:37] clouds and way up there standing on a
[8:39] rock that reached from the East to the
[8:41] West in a porned shaped like that like a
[8:43] pyramid run back here to the East and
[8:45] said there you would stand there on a
[8:47] horse that I never seen anything like it
[8:49] in my life Great White Horse white man
[8:52] hanging down and said you dressed like
[8:55] an Indian chief with all the things the
[8:56] Indians use said he had a breastplate
[8:59] and Bangals on the arms and all down
[9:01] around like that said you had your hands
[9:03] up like that and said that horse
[9:05] standing there like a military horse
[9:07] with a prince like this walking he
[9:10] standing still and said you pulled on
[9:12] the Rings went riding off towards the
[9:14] West said I look down there and there's
[9:16] a whole lot of scientists and the next
[9:18] morning that was Saturday on the next
[9:20] morning I preached on scientist you know
[9:21] being of the devil and said scientist is
[9:23] there pouring things in tubes and mixing
[9:25] it said you stop the horse raised up
[9:27] your hands again and screamed I'll ride
[9:29] this Trail once more and so the whole
[9:31] earth Shook and people shook they looked
[9:33] up look one another like that looked up
[9:34] to you they just Shug their shoulders
[9:36] went on with their scientific research
[9:38] and said you started going on towards
[9:39] your West and when I did said I seen
[9:42] this man that called himself a prophet

[10:39] here you know that no man can ride this
[10:42] road here without God beain him to do it
[10:45] get off of here and said the man turned
[10:47] around and said the man has wrote me
[10:49] letters and said across his horse's hips
[10:52] that black and gray and mixed up
[10:53] together said across his horse's hips

[13:58] got you packed away how many remembers
[14:00] the the dream of brother Roy and said
[14:02] the White Cloud packed you away and said
[14:05] then you was gone I walked through the

[14:27] you and packed you away from us towards
[14:28] the West as before the PID or anything

[14:35] walk the streets and de while I went and
[14:36] set the table I had look up there at the
[14:38] head of the table said I can just see
[14:41] that much of you as Snow White said you
[14:43] stand there and said you spoke with
[14:45] authority there was no guessing to it
[14:49] that am man understood exactly what she
[14:50] was saying oh my brother sister now
[14:54] everyone of you conscious I know what
[14:55] that
[14:56] means just what
[14:59] stay close to Christ let me warn you now
[15:02] as a minister of the Gospel of this
[15:05] don't take any
[15:08] foolishness don't imagine anything stay
[15:13] right there until this inside of the
[15:16] inside is anchored to the word that
[15:19] you're writing Christ because that's the
[15:21] only thing that's going to because we're
[15:24] in the most deceiving age that we ever
[15:27] lived in it would see the very elected
[15:31] if it was possible because they have
[15:33] anointing they can do anything like the
[15:34] rest of them clean your lives up pay
[15:37] your debts oh no man Jesus said not I
[15:40] mean like your house Ren stuff you got
[15:42] to do it get all your things off your
[15:43] hands get everything right Make Ready
[15:47] Get Ready remember in the name of the
[15:50] Lord something's fixing to
[15:53] happen I'm going into the Hills this
[15:55] week not it's
[15:57] AC hun S course I like the hunt squirrel
[16:00] but I'm going out there for this purpose
[16:02] saying oh God I don't know which way to
[16:04] move and I don't want to miss this help
[16:07] me you pray for me will you do it I'll
[16:10] be praying for you I hope by the mercies
[16:13] of God that I meet every one of him we
[16:15] meet in a better land than this year
[16:18] next quote is from November 28th the
[16:19] morning service brother brand says I'll
[16:21] ride this Trail again is a promise
[16:24] apparently of a Revival but again
[16:27] there's no interpretation given and
[16:29] there's no thus sayith the Lord about
[16:31] any details regarding this dream or
[16:34] these dreams it's a very brief short
[16:37] statement brother random says will there
[16:40] be another Revival he says just remember
[16:42] from the West will come a white horse
[16:44] rider we'll ride this Trail again that's
[16:47] right soon as we get ready it's a
[16:49] promise and it's interesting brother
[16:51] brandom says we'll ride this Trail again
[16:54] so more than one person it seems like
[16:57] again this makes me think I ride this
[16:59] Trail again means a group of preachers
[17:02] and notice brother Ram says it's a
[17:04] promise in other words the dreams were
[17:06] thus sayith the Lord but he didn't have
[17:07] the
[17:08] interpretation and here in this quote he
[17:10] doesn't say he has the interpretation so
[17:13] we got to be careful how we interpret
[17:15] this let's listen to the
[17:17] quote now there's I was getting pretty
[17:20] old and I thought will I will there be
[17:22] another Revival I'll see another time
[17:25] and just remember from the West will
[17:27] come a white horse rider amen we'll ride
[17:30] this Trail
[17:33] again it's a
[17:35] [Music]
[17:37] promise and the last mention is again
[17:39] the same day November 28th in the
[17:42] evening service brother R says he's
[17:44] ready to ride the trail he's reporting
[17:46] for service of course this is after he
[17:49] tells the experience he had of God
[17:51] healing him from his stomach issue he
[17:53] said why me an old man suffered all my
[17:56] life would God heal me now I believe I
[17:58] ride this Trail again I got to bring a
[18:00] message Lord your servants reporting for
[18:03] service amen I'm ready and that's the
[18:06] final mention by God's grace why me an
[18:10] old man suffered all my
[18:13] life why did he heal me
[18:16] now I believe I'll ride this Trail
[18:19] [Music]
[18:21] again got to bring a
[18:25] message I say to my father tonight as
[18:28] Junior seen in a a dream the other night
[18:31] of the wings of this Dove moving in
[18:33] these wind this year Lord your servants
[18:36] reporting for service amen I'm
[18:40] ready remember friends brother random
[18:42] would pass away less than a month later
[18:44] December 24th
[18:46] 1965 I like to also give the scriptures
[18:49] of why I think these set of Dreams could
[18:51] mean that a Ministry of Brothers The
[18:55] Fold Ministry would preach brother Ram's
[18:57] message around the world I believe that
[19:00] would be the most likely interpretation
[19:03] of this dream you can find this in First
[19:05] Kings 19:15 through 17 Elijah was given
[19:09] three commands to anoint three people
[19:12] but he himself only fulfilled one of
[19:14] those commands in person he was
[19:17] commanded to anoint haziel King over
[19:20] Syria Elijah did not do this it seems
[19:23] Elisha did this in 2 Kings 81
[19:27] 13-15 second Elijah was to anoint juu
[19:31] King over Israel Elijah did not do this
[19:34] in person it looks like a son of a
[19:36] prophet anointed juu king in 2 Kings
[19:40] 91-113 and the third command Was Elijah
[19:43] to anoint Elisha a prophet in his room
[19:47] this is the one thing that he did do in
[19:48] person 2 Kings 29-15 the double portion
[19:53] of the Holy Ghost fell on Elisha so here
[19:56] we get the idea God told Elijah specific
[19:58] specifically you're going to anoint
[19:59] three people but he didn't he only did
[20:02] one and then God used other people to
[20:05] anoint the other two
[20:08] individuals so here we see how God can
[20:10] interpret his word any way he wants this
[20:13] story helps us understand why brother
[20:14] brandom could speak something in the
[20:16] name of the Lord and He himself may not
[20:18] have done it someone else could have
[20:20] done it so we have to leave that open as
[20:22] a possibility because that's a
[20:23] scriptural example and the scripture is
[20:26] the absolute also I want to say that I
[20:29] reject the teaching that brother
[20:30] brandham will rise from the dead and
[20:32] return for another worldwide preaching
[20:36] Ministry this is often called the return
[20:38] Ministry and I do not believe in that
[20:41] because we're supposed to look for
[20:42] Jesus's return and not brother brandom's
[20:45] return the Bible never tells us to look
[20:47] for any other return other than the Lord
[20:49] Jesus Christ of course we understand the
[20:52] dead in Christ will rise first before
[20:54] the Rapture and this will include
[20:56] brother brandom but we're not expecting
[20:58] brother brandham or anyone else to have
[21:00] any Revival Ministry so I believe this
[21:03] interpretation of other men preaching
[21:05] brother bram's message to be the best
[21:07] fulfilling of the I'll ride this Trail
[21:09] again set of dreams and I believe this
[21:12] will fulfill Revelation 10 vers 8- 11
[21:16] because the revelation of the open book
[21:19] must be taken around the world and
[21:21] brother brandom even said himself he may
[21:23] not do it but the message will introduce
[21:25] Jesus Christ to the world so the message
[21:28] must go around the world before judgment
[21:30] can fall and then the Rapture can take
[21:32] place as Jesus said in Matthew
[21:34] 24:14 this gospel must be preached to
[21:37] every nation and then the end will come
[21:40] in Look Away to Jesus December 29th 1963
[21:44] brother randam said I may not do it but
[21:46] this message will introduce Jesus Christ
[21:48] to the world let's listen to the quote
[21:51] and I want to say this I've never said
[21:52] it before but according to scripture
[21:56] according to what he said 30 years ago
[21:58] 33 years ago on the river down there in
[22:01] 19 and33 rather what he said everything
[22:05] has happened just exactly I may not do
[22:08] it but this message will introduce Jesus
[22:11] Christ to the world for as John the
[22:13] Baptist was sent to forerun the first
[22:15] coming so is the message to forerun the
[22:18] second coming and John said Behold the
[22:21] Lamb of God that takes away the sin of
[22:23] the world so it's it paralleled it in
[22:26] every way and I know it will the message
[22:29] will go
[22:30] on and one final point the few churches
[22:34] that I've been in contact with or heard
[22:36] about that our return Ministry churches
[22:38] have all been surrounded with false
[22:42] Doctrine and sinful wickedness for
[22:45] example one return Ministry Church has
[22:48] adultery going on with the preachers and
[22:50] other people in the church that proves
[22:53] that this leaven of a false Doctrine if
[22:55] it's not taken out will spread to the
[22:57] entire church
[22:59] and another church has even worse sins
[23:01] I'm not going to mention but even worse
[23:03] sins abusive sins so Jesus said a tree
[23:06] is known by its fruit so this obvious
[23:09] corrupt sinful Wicked fruit in the
[23:12] return Ministry churches I believe
[23:13] proves again that's a false Doctrine
[23:16] we're not expecting brother Bram to come
[23:17] back and preach and have a Revival
[23:20] Ministry now for this final section here
[23:23] I want to look at two thus sayith the
[23:24] Lord's statements out west now the
[23:26] reason I'm sharing these is because the
[23:28] dreams about brother brandham riding
[23:30] this Trail again show that he spoke with
[23:32] authority and there could be no greater
[23:35] Authority than saying thus sayith the
[23:37] Lord and again brother random preached
[23:39] his last five sermons out west or four
[23:41] sermons depending on if you consider
[23:44] communion a sermon or not and he gave
[23:46] two thus sayith the Lord statements the
[23:48] first was he was reiterating the Los
[23:51] Angeles sinking prophecy seems like he
[23:54] was giving an authorative warning to the
[23:56] people out west this was in leadership
[24:00] 1965 December 7th brother brandom said
[24:03] Church unless you get right with God
[24:04] you're doomed thus sayith the Holy
[24:06] Spirit now I want to share something too
[24:09] it seems like God had mercy on these
[24:11] people out in California because they
[24:14] were not doomed in other words they
[24:16] probably got to live on the rest of
[24:18] their lives some of them still could be
[24:20] alive today but it seems like that
[24:22] generation must have repented because
[24:24] they were not doomed Los Angeles has not
[24:27] yet sunk into the ocean and that would
[24:30] make sense because brother BR said every
[24:32] generation gets a chance at the word of
[24:33] God and also God cannot judge the
[24:36] righteous with the wicked as Genesis 18-
[24:38] 19 show us God had to call all the
[24:41] foolish virgin out of Sodom before he
[24:44] destroyed Sodom and so it seems the same
[24:46] would apply today because Jesus Christ
[24:48] is the same yesterday today and forever
[24:51] it seems likely God would have to call
[24:52] all the foolish virgins out of Los
[24:54] Angeles before he destroys it but again
[24:56] I could be wrong on that but it's seems
[24:58] like because we've had all these years
[25:00] 59 years since brother brandom gave this
[25:02] prophecy that God is showing Mercy but
[25:06] again that's just my own thought that's
[25:07] my own personal opinion but let's listen
[25:09] to the statement thus sayith the Lord
[25:10] from leadership here's the quote look
[25:13] here do you know what the Lord says
[25:15] about Los Angeles and these places here
[25:16] she's gone you remember what I told you
[25:18] about two years ago how that earthquake
[25:20] of coming can up here in Alaska I also
[25:23] tell you that Hollywood in Los Angeles
[25:25] is sliding into the
[25:27] ocean California you're
[25:30] doomed not only California but you were
[25:33] you're doomed Church unless you get
[25:35] right with God you're
[25:37] doomed thus saith the Holy Spirit have
[25:40] you ever heard me use that name unless
[25:42] it come to pass asked you you've known
[25:45] me 20 years did I ever tell you anything
[25:48] in the name of the Lord but what come to
[25:50] pass if everything I've ever told you
[25:52] would happen happen say
[25:56] amen I tell you now's the hour you
[25:59] better be getting right all of
[26:01] us and the final thus say the statement
[26:04] is actually from that same sermon
[26:05] leadership 1965 December 7th brother Ram
[26:09] talks about how women wear sexy clothes
[26:12] and they have the spirit of a street
[26:14] prostitute brother Ram quotes Jesus from
[26:17] Matthew 5 whosoever lookth on a woman to
[26:20] lust after has already committed
[26:21] adultery with her in his heart brother
[26:24] Ram says that women say they don't make
[26:25] any other clothes but brother Ram says
[26:27] they got goods and sewing machines
[26:29] there's no excuse that's exactly I don't
[26:31] want to hurt you and this is not a joke
[26:33] this is thus say the Lord from the
[26:35] scripture brother Ram said I'm an old
[26:37] man I haven't got much longer to stay
[26:40] but I've got to tell the truth if this
[26:42] is my last message it's the truth see
[26:45] don't sister don't brother again this
[26:47] seems to be a very anointed statement
[26:50] because he speaks with thus sayith the
[26:51] Lord and this is the last full sermon
[26:54] brother Brandon preached cuz the next
[26:55] sermon was just a short statement
[26:58] brother brother random had about
[27:00] communion but this is his last full
[27:02] sermon and notice he said if this is my
[27:04] last message it's the truth so this
[27:07] seems to be an authorative thus sayi the
[27:09] Lord's statement that women have to make
[27:12] effort to wear modest clothing and men
[27:15] should not lust after women who are
[27:17] dressed immodestly so that's the second
[27:19] authoritative statement with thus say
[27:21] the Lord let's listen to the quote what
[27:24] kind of homes he going to have he takes
[27:25] a strip teas a burs off of the street
[27:27] out here
[27:28] a street prostitute oh say now wait a
[27:31] minute how does she dress
[27:33] herself
[27:35] amen wear shorts and they say street
[27:38] prostitute oh you say now brother one
[27:40] them little old tight skirts look like
[27:41] you're poured into street prostitute
[27:44] Jesus said whosoever lookth upon a woman
[27:46] to lust after her has committed adultery
[27:48] with her in his heart then he's got to
[27:50] answer for that and what she do she
[27:52] present herself who's
[27:54] guilty
[27:56] amen think of it
[27:58] you say they don't make any other
[28:00] clothes they got goods and sewing
[28:02] machines no
[28:05] excuse
[28:07] exactly I I don't want to hurt you and
[28:09] this is not a joke this is thus sayeth
[28:12] the Lord from the
[28:13] scriptures it's exactly true friend I'm
[28:17] an old man I haven't got much longer to
[28:19] stay but I've got to tell you the truth
[28:22] if this is my last message it's the
[28:24] truth see don't sister don't brother
[28:28] in
[28:29] closing friends I hope this short video
[28:31] was a blessing by the grace of God again
[28:34] with every quote and statement from
[28:35] brother brandom we have to take it back
[28:36] to the scripture we have to rightly
[28:38] divide the word of Truth we have to
[28:40] prove all things and so I believe the
[28:42] scriptures on this video like First
[28:44] Kings 19 and all the Kings verses about
[28:48] Elijah and Elisha really help us
[28:50] understand this statement also
[28:51] Revelation 108-111 and Matthew
[28:55] 24:14 remember brother random says God
[28:57] can't give us anything outside the word
[28:59] everything that's spoken in the name of
[29:00] the Lord must have some scriptural
[29:03] bible-based Foundation by the grace of
[29:05] God I look forward to the comments or
[29:08] email me please if you have any other
[29:10] further quotes about this subject I'd
[29:11] really like to understand it better by
[29:14] God's grace I'm open to correction I'd
[29:17] like to get your thoughts on it as well
[29:18] but of course it's got to be scriptural
[29:20] Thoughts by the grace of God and again I
[29:22] appreciate the questions about this and
[29:25] hope this was a help by the grace of God
[29:27] if you have questions concerns or
[29:29] testimonies about this video please
[29:31] contact
[29:32] me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[29:35] the desire of your
[29:39] heart
