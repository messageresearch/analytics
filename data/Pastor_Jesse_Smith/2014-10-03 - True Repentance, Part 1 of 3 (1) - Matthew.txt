Description:
True repentance is the first step in a believer's salvation, yet many are unaware of what true repentance really is. This is why Jesus said "few" will find the way to salvation (Matthew 7:14) and many will do wonderful works in the name of Jesus and yet still miss heaven (Matthew 7:21-23). Most think it is simply "making a decision" and reciting a ritualistic prayer but the Bible shows us what a true repentant heart looks like. Please enjoy Part 1 as we look at the subjects of "Repentance is the First Step" and "What is True Repentance?". Please view Parts 2 and 3 of this series of teaching videos. God bless you!
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
greetings friends in the Holy Name of Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to teach what true repentance from sin really is according to the Bible we believe there is a great need to teach on this topic for Jesus said few not many will find the narrow way that leads to life in Matthew 7:14 he said this because he knew the world would love Darkness or sin more than light which is the word of God Christ Jesus also said that he would have to tell many on the day of judgment that he never knew them and yet these many people had prophesied cast out devils and did many wonderful Works in his name thankfully Jesus told us the reason the many who did the wonderful works for the name of Jesus were rejected on the day of judgment sadly they were also workers of iniquity according to Matthew 7:23 iniquity means wickedness and they did not do the will of God which is the word of God according to verse 21 yet these many people had works or actions that led them to think God was with them but their lives also had wickedness and sin so they never even obtained true repentance before God this teaches us that many people today will do works for Jesus without experiencing true repentance from their sins because the teaching on repentance in many churches is so watered down and incomplete as we will show repentance is more than just saying sorry for your sins and saying a quick scripted recited prayer we want you and as many as the Lord will call us to share this gospel video with to experience true repentance rep from your sins that you might know Jesus in the power of his resurrection according to Philippians 3:10 and also that you might become a new creature in Christ Jesus according to Galatians 6:15 we begin at the birth of the New Testament Church on the day of Pentecost when St Peter said this when he was asked by Sinners what they should do for salvation then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call notice that repentance along with water baptism was the first step in becoming a follower of Jesus Christ Our video on water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ is available on our website for viewing but this video you're watching now on repentance from sin is actually a prerequisite video to water baptism being baptized in water and doing other works in the name of Jesus is meaningless unless the heart of the sinner has been changed by a true Act of repentance repentance is a crucial first step in your salvation as it was a major part of the preaching ministries of Jesus and John the Baptist as both preach repentance from their sins in Mark 1:15 Matthew 4:17 and Matthew 3 :8 for example John the Baptist told everyone to repent even Herod Antipas the political leader of Galilee John told Herod that his marriage wasn't lawful but Herod didn't repent and remained in a sinful marriage his marriage did not please God as he was married to his living brother's former wife herodias this marriage made Herod an adulterer Herod would not repent at the words of a prophet of God what if Jesus told you today your marriage or current relationship was unlawful would you repent and change your life in order to please God do each of us love Jesus that much and is our repentance that sincere we will now examine repentance by teaching what true repentance is how repentance happens what we must repent of how the cross leads us to repentance and a call for True repentance what what is true repentance looking at the word repent in the Greek Lexicon gives us a definition to start with to change one's mind for better heartily to amend with abhorrence of one's past sins there are three aspects to genuine repentance that we will bring out of this definition and each is fully supported in scripture the first is changing one's mind about their sins the second is heartily making amends for one's sins and the third is abhor or hating past sins the first concept of repentance as a change of mind is Illustrated beautifully through the teaching of the Lord Jesus in Matthew 21: 25-32 Jesus tells the parable of two sons and their father's Vineyard the father asked his two sons to work in the vineyard the first son said I will not but afterward he repented and went to work the first son changed his mind or repented and it was displayed through his actions he literally went to work for his father after saying he would not the second son said he would work but did not his actions did not line up with his words the second son is an example of many professed Christians today who say I believe in Jesus and I repented of my sins but if their actions towards sin do not back up their words then they have spoken in vain if we say we repented then we must leave our sins behind us and go to work for Jesus in his Vineyard if we love Jesus then the Bible said it is not Grievous or burdensome or hard to leave our sins behind and to keep God's Commandments 1 John 53 and4 say for this is the love of God that we keep his Commandments and his Commandments are not Grievous or burdensome or hard for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith the next two parts of repentance deal with heartily making amends for sin and also abhorring or hating your sins these two parts of repentance are also seen displayed in the scripture zakus hardly made amends for his sin of extortion and stealing money from people by restoring the money he had taken zakus returned four times the amount he stole from those that He sinned against according to Luke 19:8 that was true repentance According To Jesus himself your self as for abhorring or hating your past sins St Paul taught us to hate our past sins and current sins in Romans 7:15 St Paul also taught us to have Godly sorrow towards sin in our lives which will lead to a Zeal to obey Jesus 2 Corinthians 7: 10 and 11 says that Godly sorrow produces a carefulness or earnestness to be clear or pure from sin last lastly St Paul wrote in Romans 6:21 that we would feel ashamed of our past sins of course when someone repents for the first time they will have a huge load of Shame due to this massive shame and guilt the true repentant believer will weep their way to Salvation and forgiveness as the Bible teaches us in the following passages out of Luke 7: 37-48 and James 4: 1-10 in Luke 7: 37-48 the woman who brought an alabaster box of ointment to Simon the Pharisees house was so ashamed of her sins that she wased Jesus's feet with her tears and wiped his feet with her long hair Jesus told her thy sins are forgiven in verse 44 and that she loved him much in verse 47 this teaches us that true love for Jesus Will weep in Thanksgiving at his feet for the mercy he shown in dying for our sins and raising for our justification ation the woman stayed at the feet of Jesus until she heard Jesus say her sins were forgiven we can do the same today because the Bible teaches that the holy spirit will give us a witness to our spirits that we are the children of God we must pray until we feel fully surrendered and the spirit will speak the same words that Jesus spoke to our hearts your sins which are many are forgiven James 4: 1-10 gives us us another powerful teaching on how to repent and draw nigh to God James wrote be afflicted and mourn and weep let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to heaviness humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord and He Shall lift you up God doesn't want a dried dyed confession with only an intellectual experience of reciting a prayer of repentance God wants an experience of you and I truly repenting from our sins being fully devoted to walk away from our sins and expressing our great love and thankfulness for Jesus's Grace like the woman with the alabaster box
