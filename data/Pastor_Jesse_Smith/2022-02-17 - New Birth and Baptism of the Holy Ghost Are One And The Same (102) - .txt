Description:
The Bible teaches man has three parts to his being: body, human spirit (mind), and soul. The New Testament new birth takes place in the soul of the believer. The new birth is synonymous with the baptism of the Holy Ghost, making the new birth and baptism of the Holy Ghost the one and the same event. God's prophet, Brother Branham, grew in his understanding of this major doctrine. After the opening of the Seven Seals, Brother Branham taught the new birth and baptism of the Holy Ghost were one and the same, also synonymous with the "seal" of the Holy Ghost.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] greetings friends in the matchless name of the lord jesus christ the purpose of this video is to show that the new birth and the baptism of the holy ghost are one in the same recently a viewer asked me to make a video about this subject and after a prayer and waiting on the lord i felt led to do it because it's such a major important critical doctrine for the bride of jesus christ and for the church in general we know salvation is a major doctrine according to god's prophet brother branham and therefore the baptism of the holy ghost would also be a major topic as well because the baptism of the holy ghost is needed to go in the rapture according to matthew chapter 25 verses 1 through 13 and 1st thessalonians chapters four and five here's a summary of my explanation of how the new birth and the baptism of the holy ghost are one in the same the new birth and holy ghost baptism are the same event in the soul of the believer and thanks to brother branham's revelation on the anointed ones at the end times that the holy spirit gave to him we know there is also a filling or baptism of the holy spirit in the human spirit or mind which is the second realm of man because man has three realms or parts to his being according to first thessalonians 5 23 here's a visual and the very god of peace sanctify you holy and i pray your whole spirit that your human spirit or mind and soul that's the core of your being where free moral agency is located as well and body your flesh body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our lord jesus christ god's revelation of this hour tells us there are two kinds of fillings or baptisms there is one filling in the human spirit and then a different filling in the human soul the most important filling or baptism of the holy ghost is in the soul of the believer for when you have that baptism you are sealed or marked by the holy ghost unto the day of your redemption according to ephesians 4 verse 30. this video will fully show how the baptism of the human spirit was available in the old testament and is still available today but there's a greater baptism today that's the baptism of the holy ghost in the soul let's begin by looking at quotes from brother william branham god's prophet what will help most of our viewers is the fact that brother branham taught the filling and baptism of the holy ghost were different events before he preached the seven seals in 1963 and then afterwards he taught that they were one in the same so again brother branham grew in his understanding of the baptism of the holy ghost before he preached the seven seals he thought they were two different events the filling was different from the baptism but after the seven seals were loose from the book and the full revelation of god was given to brother branham he understood that the sealing of the holy ghost was the same as the filling and baptism and that event takes place in the human soul in the new testament this first quote is brother branham's previous teaching on how the filling and baptism were different let's listen to the quote i never thought there's a person believe that like me though this morning i heard charles fuller as it's going down he believes too that the new birth is not the baptism the holy ghost the new birth is being born the holy ghost is a baptism now here's the quotes showing the filling and baptism are one in the same from the church age book so when i invite those who are spirit-filled to come and deal with those who have answered the invitation to receive the spirit these dear ones surge forward and deal with the people in such manner as to encourage them to yield to god and believe to speak in tongues this has caused a great deal of confusion and i want to tell you exactly what i mean i mean for the sinner to come forward and be born again which is to be baptized into the body of christ by the holy ghost which is exactly what took place at pentecost when the church was launched in other words to be born of the spirit is to be truly baptized with the holy ghost it is one and the same what is the baptism with the holy ghost it is the spirit baptizing you into the body of christ it is the new birth it is the spirit of god coming in and filling you after you have repented having heard his word and been baptized in water as an answer of a good conscience toward god despite what some people say about the church age book it was and is a powerful book brother branham said on tape that the church age book was so biblically clear that readers would understand deep doctrines like the book of life if they had any light of god in them at all let's listen to the quote there comes your name on the book see you guys he's grammarizing this book of the seven church ages and the problem come up the question about your name taken off the lamb's book of life it's part of a lot of ministers so once you get the book you'll understand if you got any light in you notice now you'll turn your head won't even look at it if you don't want to see it like my mother you say you can't get blood from a turnip because there's no blood in it branham fully supported the church age book and its revelations about the messages and messengers to each church age that he said he'd stand at the day of judgment for the book let's listen to the quote and consider the magnitude of this statement in my book you'll all be drawn out in the seven churches which he told me which i stand by as a witness to god to be judged in their judgment party it comes from god not from my faith after the opening of the seven seals you can look at quotes from brother branham and see how he used new birth and baptism of the soul interchangeably let's listen to this first one from a instance i paradox that every born-again member of the body of christ is a paradox in themselves i believe each one of you methodists and presbyterian and lutheran that never had experienced the baptism of the holy spirit was in some formal church that did not believe in the genuine new birth and has now received the baptism of the holy ghost is a perfect example of a paradox they because something happened to you that changed your whole being and anyone could look at that and know that what a paradox is america the next one is a quote from the token when god has given you the true baptism of the holy spirit then the life of jesus christ is within you now that's true every theologian i have to admit that to be this it's a new birth you're born anew of the holy ghost and because a god has did this and you know you're no good in yourself and you accept what god has did then he sealed you into his kingdom by the holy spirit here's a brother random quote from modern events made clear by prophecy from 1965 you'll hear brother adam say how your human spirit or mind can be filled with the holy spirit and then that anointing can leave and you would be lost there are numerous quotes like this after the seven seals because that was when the full revelation began being open to brother branham this many people just can't believe it even spirit spirit-filled people of course give you one little choke the baptist the holy ghost don't mean you're going in not at all and you're not gonna have don't have to do your soul that's a baptism here's the inside soul in here that has to come from god but then on the outside you have five senses and five out inlets to your contacts you're looking on the inside you have a spirit and in there you have five outlets your conscience and love and so forth five outlets to that spirit remember in that spirit you can be baptized for the genuine spirit of god and still be lost it's the soul that lives that was ordained of god didn't jesus say many will come to me that day and said lord have i cast out devils done great mighty words prophesied the great gifts of god he said depart from you that work iniquity i never even knew you many will come in that day didn't care this is prophesying he was the devil we find out later tonight a great man was supposed to be great leaders in that days with humility and everything else but failed to see the word of god itself may manifest before them we could just take a bunch of i got rolled down here how about balaam this powerful statement from brother branham that a person can be justified and sanctified but then lose their salvation is fully backed up by scripture because hebrews 10 29 says a person can be sanctified which is the second work of grace and then trodden underfoot the son of god which means to blaspheme the holy ghost so this means if a person was sanctified it can only mean their human spirit or human mind was anointed by the holy ghost but not their soul and of course judas iscariot is a good example of this no doubt he was justified and sanctified but then towards the end of his life he transgressed the word of god sold out his soul and satan filled his heart and the bible said he went to his own place in acts chapter 1. he forfeited his own salvation and was lost hebrews 10 29 says of how much sore punishment suppose ye shall he be thought worthy who hath trodden underfoot the son of god and hath counted the blood of the covenant wherewith he was sanctified an unholy thing and hath done despite unto the spirit of grace another hebrew scripture teaches this reality as well in hebrews chapter 6 verses 4 through 6 which says a person can crucify to themselves the son of god or the holy ghost and be lost even after partaking of spiritual blessings of the holy ghost for it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and were made partakers of the holy ghost and have tasted the good word of god and the powers of the world to come if they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance seeing they crucified to themselves the son of god afresh and put him to an open shame i believe in my humble opinion that the reason brother brahm changed his thinking about the new birth and the baptism of the holy ghost is because he had to receive the revelation of this subject this subject is specifically called a mystery by paul in the bible in colossians 1 verses 26 and 27 even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations but is now made manifest to his saints to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory so the phrase christ in you is a synonymous phrase for the new birth or the baptism of the holy ghost in the soul it's synonymous for being born again as well the revelation of the mystery of godliness unlocks salvation in the old testament as we just explained the revelation of the mystery of christ in you or the baptism of the holy ghost helps unlock another bible mystery which is the mystery of godliness or how god restores godliness to man as brother branham taught this and listed it as schofield's eight mystery in 1962 in the sermon is this the sign of the answer let's listen to the quote the seventh mystery is our god even christ as the incarnate fullness of the godhead embodied in whom all divine wisdom and godliness is restored to man ninth mystery is the mystery of iniquity found in second thessalonians and so forth the tenth mystery is of the seven stars of revelations 1 20 we just been through that the seven stars of the seven churches and seven messengers and so forth in the mystery of godliness which is found in first timothy 3 16 god restores godliness or god's character qualities to man through the three works of grace which are justification sanctification and the baptism of the holy ghost in the first two stages of grace justification and sanctification god builds a believer's character through his character virtues or attributes which peter lists in second peter 1 verses 5 through 7. and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity when a believer is justified he has the anointing of faith in sanctification the believers anointed with virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness and brotherly kindness so there is one holy ghost anointing for justification and there are six anointings for sanctification so the longer you serve god faithfully the more anointings god gives you and they're all just more anointing of the holy ghost lastly in the third work of grace the believer is capped off or sealed by the baptism of the holy ghost in his soul which is also called charity by peter and this is god's own spirit because god is charity god is love this revealed mystery now helps explain why old testament saints could not be baptized with the holy ghost in their souls meaning they could not have the new birth just as jesus taught in john 7 verses 37-39 in the last day that great day of the feast jesus stood and cried saying if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink he that believeth on me as the scripture has said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water but this spake he of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive so notice jesus is speaking of future receiving of the holy ghost which was fulfilled in acts chapter 2 verse 4. let's finish verse 39 for the holy ghost was not yet given because that jesus was not yet glorified old testament saints could not be filled with the holy ghost in their souls because their sins were under animal blood but after jesus raised from the dead new testament saints could have the baptism of the holy ghost in their souls again here's the diagram of the three parts of man the old testament saint could only have the holy ghost on their flesh body like samson had a powerful anointing to defeat one thousand philistines and lift up and carry away the gates of a city old testament saints could also have the anointing on their human spirits or minds which is how they could prophesy or write many chapters of the bible without one word failing and without making any mistakes this means any believer before the day of pentecost other than jesus christ could not have the baptism of the holy ghost in their souls they could only have the feeling of the holy spirit in their human spirits or minds old testament saints could have the anointing of the character qualities of faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness and brotherly kindness but they can never be baptized with the holy ghost in their souls according to john's revelation in john 7 verse 39 so anytime the old testament or the four gospels say someone was filled with god's spirit it means they were filled in their human spirits or minds their minds were anointed with the holy ghost not their souls here's an excerpt from my 2021 book where i deal with this subject from pages 353 to 360. this is not the whole section just a few paragraphs old testament examples of the temporary anointing now that you've learned the human spirit the second part of your being is only anointed temporarily by the holy ghost you can understand old testament bible examples referring to believers being filled with the holy ghost you know these temporary fillings only anointed their minds not their souls because jesus was not yet glorified pharaoh recognized god's spirit in joseph in genesis 41 verse 38 saying can we find such a one as this is a man in whom the spirit of god is in exodus 28 verse 3 wise hearted jews were filled with the spirit of wisdom in order to make aaron's priestly garments bezellio was filled with the spirit of god in all manner of workmanship to help build the tabernacle of moses but it was his human spirit that was filled with god's spirit not yet his soul because hebrews 10 verse 4 says it was impossible for the blood of bulls and goats which sacrifices he was living under to take away his sins numbers 14 verse 24 says caleb had another spirit with him which caused him to follow god fully in the days of joshua in numbers 27 verse 18 joshua had god's spirit for the lord told moses take thee joshua the son of nun a man in whom is the spirit and lay thine hand upon him micah knew his mind was filled with god's spirit saying but truly i am full of power by the spirit of the lord and of judgment and of might to declare unto jacob his transgression and to israel his sin all prophets had god's spirit temporarily anointing them numbers 11 verses 25 through 29 shows how god put a portion of his spirit that was already upon moses on 70 elders causing them to prophesy without ceasing additionally the revelation of godliness helps us understand that john the baptist elizabeth zacharias and others in the four gospels were not yet born again in their souls but their human spirits were filled with the holy ghost again proven by the authority of john 7 39 i'll read another portion from my 2021 book on pages 360 and 361 new testament examples of the temporary anointing john the baptist and his parents zacharias and elizabeth are three new testament examples of the temporary anointing of god's spirit technically the new testament did not begin until after jesus death and resurrection hebrews 9 verses 16 and 17 validates this saying for where a testament is there must also of necessity be the death of the testator for a testament is of force after men are dead otherwise it is of no strength at all while the testator liveth these three individuals are classified as new testament examples because their temporary anointing is recorded in luke's gospel which is considered part of the traditional new testament canon luke chapter 1 records john and his parents being filled with the holy ghost luke 1 verse 15 says for he john shall be great in the sight of the lord and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink and he should be filled with the holy ghost even from his mother's womb speaking of elizabeth luke 1 verse 41 says and it came to pass that when elizabeth heard the salutation of mary the babe leaped in her womb and elizabeth was filled with the holy ghost luke 1 verse 67 mentioned zechariah saying and his father zacharias was filled with the holy ghost and prophesied weigh these three experiences with jesus's words in john 7 39 but this spake he of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the holy ghost was not yet given because that jesus was not yet glorified based upon the messiah's declaration john and his parents were temporarily filled with the holy ghost in their human spirits or minds and not in their souls additional proof is found in john's doubt of christ as messiah matthew 11 verses 2 and 3 reads now when john had heard in the prison the works of christ he sent two of his disciples and said unto him art thou he that should come or do we look for another the pressure stress and agony of prison life had caused john to doubt his earlier experience of seeing the holy ghost ascend and remain upon christ at his baptism that he performed john could doubt his supernatural experience because his soul was not sealed indeed john lacked the greater power in his soul to be an unwavering witness that only the holy ghost baptism could provide acts 1 verse 8 identifies this power saying but ye shall receive power after that the holy ghost has come upon you and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem and in judea and in samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth three other new testament passages teach of the temporary anointing of god's spirit upon the human spirit or mind matthew 7 verses 21 through 23 show that many persons who had god's anointing temporarily will be lost and sent to hell because they chose to work iniquity rather than righteousness two of jesus's parables give us more information about this fact and those parables are called the we and the tares and the net cast into the sea hebrews 6 verses 4 through 8 describes wicked people who temporarily enjoy the blessings of the holy spirit the hebrews author clearly states these reprobates can be enlightened of the spirit taste of heavenly gifts partake of the holy ghost but still fall away from living a true christian life lastly hebrews 10 verses 26 through 29 speaks of those who sin willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth god's judgment and fiery indonation is against those who serve god with his anointing long enough to be sanctified but then trot and underfoot the son of god and live despite the spirit of grace in closing i hope this video has been a blessing friends and i hope it's proved fully by the scriptures by brother madam's quotes using the understanding from john 7 39 that the new birth and baptism of the holy ghost are the one and the same event in the soul of the new testament believer yes no doubt there are many church members today around the world who have been filled with the holy spirit in their human spirits or minds but if they fail to go on in humility serving the lord daily repenting growing in the grace and knowledge of our lord jesus christ they will either turn into reprobates like the workers of iniquity and be lost or remain foolish virgins the rest of their lives not redeeming the time as paul says in ephesians chapter 5 paul said the wise virgins redeem the time ephesians 5 16 and 17 clearly state this redeeming the time because the days are evil wherefore be not unwise in other words do not be a foolish virgin but understanding what the will the lord is so all the believers who continue moving on in their walk with god keep progressing in revelation will receive the baptism of the holy ghost in their souls and then they will redeem the time they will walk circumspectly or exactly according to ephesians 5 15 and they will understand the perfect will of god as romans 12 verses 1 and 2 also states but foolish virgins can be saved but they won't do the perfect will of god they will be virgin or without idolatry to all the word that they've accepted but they'll still be foolish because they failed to recognize the revelation that god has given for this hour and that's the revelation god gave to his prophet brother william branham who pointed us to the absolute jesus christ who is the word of god if you have any questions testimonies or concerns about this video please contact me [Music] god bless you and may jesus christ be the desire of your heart
