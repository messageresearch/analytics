[0:03] Well, that's the same way with preaching
[0:04] divine healing or anything else.
[0:07] &gt;&gt; As you go along, you begin to learn. If
[0:10] you don't learn, there's something
[0:11] wrong. See, you've got to learn. And
[0:14] you've got to learn how to accept God
[0:17] and what it really means.
[0:19] &gt;&gt; Greetings, [music] friends, in the
[0:21] matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[0:23] The purpose of this video is to show how
[0:25] God's prophet, brother William Marin
[0:27] Brham, [music] grew in his understanding
[0:30] of divine healing as he stated in his
[0:32] November 26, [music]
[0:34] 1965 sermon, "Works is faith expressed."
[0:39] Over the years, I've shared this [music]
[0:40] particular sermon with numerous brothers
[0:43] and just told them, "In my humble
[0:45] opinion, I believe this is brother
[0:46] [music] Brandham's masterpiece on divine
[0:49] healing." Brother Ram specifically said,
[0:51] quote, "Then [music] all this we learn
[0:54] by." End quote.
[0:56] &gt;&gt; Then all this we learn by.
[1:00] &gt;&gt; Then Brother Ram said, "Quote." Well,
[1:03] that's the same way with preaching
[1:04] divine healing or anything else. As you
[1:06] go along, you begin to learn. If you
[1:09] don't learn, there's something wrong.
[1:11] So, you've got to learn, and you've got
[1:13] to learn how to accept God and what it
[1:15] really means." End quote. Well, that's
[1:18] the same way with preaching divine
[1:19] healing or anything else.
[1:21] &gt;&gt; As you go along, you begin to learn. If
[1:24] you don't learn, there's something
[1:26] wrong. See, you've got to learn. And
[1:28] you've got to learn how to accept God
[1:31] and what it really means.
[1:33] &gt;&gt; So, friends, learning is not a bad word.
[1:36] As some preachers might say, learning is
[1:39] the result of revelation. The word
[1:42] revelation means unveiling. So once
[1:44] something is unveiled, we learn what is
[1:47] underneath the veil, we might say. So
[1:50] that's all learning is. It's
[1:51] understanding what was unveiled.
[1:54] Jesus used the word learn in Matthew
[1:56] 11:28 through30. Come unto me all ye
[2:00] that labor and are heavy laden, and I
[2:02] will give you rest. Take my yoke upon
[2:04] you and learn of me, for I'm meek and
[2:05] lowly in heart, and ye shall find rest
[2:07] unto your souls. For my yoke is easy,
[2:10] and my burden is light. So the Lord
[2:13] Jesus Christ invites all who are weary
[2:16] to come to him to learn. So there can be
[2:19] nothing wrong with learning as long as
[2:20] it's learning spiritually with a sincere
[2:23] pure heart. Brother actually quoted this
[2:26] verse in 1953.
[2:28] His wife was asking about all the people
[2:32] that were in line. He said up to four
[2:34] city blocks away. He said they were
[2:37] standing. My wife said, "You don't mean
[2:39] all those people come to hear you
[2:41] preach." Brother Ram said, quote, I
[2:43] said, "No, they come to learn of Jesus."
[2:45] End quote.
[2:46] &gt;&gt; There was about four city blocks up. The
[2:49] people were ready for a revival. They
[2:52] were standing. My wife said, "You don't
[2:53] mean all those people come to hear you
[2:55] preach." I said, "No, they come to learn
[2:58] of Jesus."
[2:59] Brother Random recognized as he preached
[3:01] the word of God, it was revealed to the
[3:03] people and therefore they learned or
[3:05] understood what brother Brandham was
[3:08] preaching. There's also a verse brother
[3:11] Ram used in the church age book to show
[3:13] the evidence of the Holy Ghost was being
[3:15] able to be taught of God. It's John
[3:18] 6:45. It is written in the prophets, and
[3:20] they shall all be taught of God. Every
[3:23] man therefore that hath heard and hath
[3:24] learned of the father cometh unto me.
[3:28] So the only way to come to Jesus was to
[3:32] hear learn of the father then you could
[3:34] come to Jesus. So learning was essential
[3:38] to come to Jesus. Brother Ram uses this
[3:40] in the Smyrnan church age chapter 4. He
[3:43] said, quote, "To further bring out what
[3:45] we have just said and to also use a
[3:47] scripture that should be born in mind as
[3:49] we talk about who it is that is baptized
[3:52] with the Holy Ghost, see what Jesus says
[3:54] in John 6:45. It is written in the
[3:57] prophets, and they shall all be taught
[3:59] of God." When someone is taught
[4:02] something, they learn what was taught.
[4:05] Belram goes on to quote Isaiah 54:13,
[4:08] "And all thy children shall be taught of
[4:10] the Lord." So Jesus was referencing
[4:12] Isaiah 54:13 in John 6:45. Brother Bram
[4:17] goes on to say, "The all of God are the
[4:20] children of God. Thus it is that the
[4:22] evidence of being a true child of God,
[4:24] he whom the spirit has come upon and
[4:26] indwells is again set forth as one
[4:29] taught the word by the Holy Ghost."
[4:32] So the evidence of a bornag again holy
[4:35] ghostfilled believer is that he or she
[4:38] can be taught the word of God according
[4:40] to John 6:45 the words of the Lord Jesus
[4:43] Christ. And he was quoting Isaiah 54:13.
[4:47] There's numerous other New Testament
[4:49] verses that speak of learning. I'll just
[4:51] hit a few here. Romans 15:4. And
[4:54] whatsoever things were written a four
[4:55] time were written for our learning that
[4:57] we through patience and comfort of the
[4:59] scriptures might have hope. So there's
[5:02] at least three effects of learning the
[5:04] Old Testament scripture. We get
[5:05] patience, comfort, and hope. Perhaps
[5:07] that's why many believers, even message
[5:09] believers, don't have those patience,
[5:12] comfort, or hope because they don't
[5:13] believe in learning. Even the Lord Jesus
[5:16] had to learn obedience through the
[5:18] things he suffered. If Jesus had to
[5:20] learn, friends, how much more do we have
[5:22] to learn? He was sinless, were sinful,
[5:24] were sinners saved by grace. He was the
[5:27] divine sinless son of God, the lamb of
[5:30] God. Hebrews 5:8. Though he were a son,
[5:34] yet learned he obedience by the things
[5:35] which he suffered. So here's the outline
[5:38] for the video. By God's grace, first
[5:40] we'll look at First, we'll look at four
[5:42] important points.
[5:44] Second, we'll look at brother Ram's
[5:46] testimony about learning from works is
[5:48] faith expressed. Third, we'll look at
[5:51] the 20 paragraphs in works is faith
[5:55] expressed where brother Ram emphasizes
[5:57] the need for revelation for divine
[5:59] healing. Fourth, we'll look at the
[6:02] correct approach to divine healing.
[6:05] Fifth, we'll look at five issues with
[6:06] divine healing you have to keep in mind.
[6:09] And then sixth, and finally, we'll look
[6:10] at various helpful quotes from brother
[6:13] Brandham. I think you really like these
[6:14] quotes. They've been golden nuggets to
[6:17] me over the years by God's grace. So
[6:19] let's begin with important points. The
[6:20] first important point is divine healing
[6:22] is a minor and we should grow or learn
[6:25] as brother Ram said about both major and
[6:28] minor teachings. I made a video about
[6:30] this last year. Jesus called them
[6:31] weightier matters of the law. So there
[6:33] are major matters of the word and less
[6:37] major or minor matters of the word of
[6:39] God. And brother Ram repeatedly said
[6:42] never major on a minor. So, it's clear
[6:45] some churches, even method churches,
[6:47] have majored on divine healing and
[6:49] miracles, but it's not a major, it's a
[6:51] minor.
[6:53] Second, we also know divine healing is
[6:54] the bait on the hook, so to speak,
[6:57] because it's promised in Mark 16, and
[6:59] it's an important element of the gospel
[7:01] because Jesus said, "These signs shall
[7:02] follow them that believe." Paul said he
[7:05] did not come preaching in word only, but
[7:07] in power in 1 Thessalonians 1:5.
[7:10] It's also recorded that Jesus did so
[7:12] many supernatural works that the world
[7:14] could not contain the books that could
[7:16] be written about all that Jesus
[7:17] accomplished in John 21:25.
[7:21] So we want to keep a balance as Paul
[7:23] told the Corinthians, follow after
[7:24] charity and desire spiritual gifts, but
[7:26] rather that you may prophesy. That's 1
[7:28] Corinthians 14:1.
[7:30] And also I love this one. 1 Corinthians
[7:32] 12:31, but covet earnestly the best
[7:35] gifts and yet show I unto you a more
[7:37] excellent way. So that's the balance. We
[7:40] have to have supernatural but we can't
[7:42] major on it. So while we major on
[7:45] salvation, the baptism of the Holy
[7:46] Ghost, the major weightier matters of
[7:49] scripture, we must also desire the minor
[7:51] things or covet holy covetousness. Covet
[7:55] earnestly the best gifts and the best
[7:57] gifts are prophecy and most likely
[7:59] wisdom because wisdom manages all the
[8:01] gifts and prophesying edifies the most
[8:04] people. The third point is sadly I've
[8:07] heard many message preachers in the open
[8:10] book group and sometimes I refer to them
[8:12] as the go group because they publicly
[8:15] call themselves the greatest or among
[8:17] the greatest preachers of all time.
[8:19] These preachers lean towards the
[8:20] prosperity gospel with a promise that
[8:22] God always wants to heal. And the
[8:25] saddest part, I think, is that I've
[8:27] never heard any of these openbook
[8:30] preachers say that the sick need to find
[8:32] the will of God first. I've never heard
[8:35] one of them say that. And this is so
[8:38] wrong because the preachers simply say,
[8:39] "God is going to heal." And then on at
[8:42] least two occasions, I've seen preachers
[8:44] declare that someone was going to be
[8:46] healed and then they die. But then they
[8:48] still say, "God healed the person by
[8:50] giving them a theophony or a celestial
[8:52] body." But that was not the expected
[8:54] outcome that all the listening believers
[8:57] were expecting, nor the outcome that was
[8:59] implied. It wasn't the outcome that they
[9:01] were cheering for, shouting for. Nobody
[9:04] thought the two sick people would be
[9:06] dead and go to heaven. They believe the
[9:09] two sick people would be healed and
[9:10] continue living on the earth. And
[9:13] fourth, and finally, it is not always
[9:14] God's will to heal. as brother Ram
[9:16] taught in numerous occasions. In one
[9:19] particular case was the death of Sister
[9:21] Stad's baby from Germany in which
[9:24] brother Random got a clear-cut decision
[9:25] from God that it was the hand of the
[9:27] Lord to not resurrect the baby from the
[9:30] dead. The Bible clearly teaches this as
[9:33] well. It's not always God's will to
[9:34] heal. Paul had the thorn in his flesh, a
[9:38] satanic buffeting messenger, and he was
[9:41] not healed, although he saw it three
[9:42] times according to 2 Corinthians 12:es
[9:45] 1-9. Timothy is not recorded as being
[9:48] healed. He had stomach ailments that
[9:51] continued, and he was to manage them
[9:53] through drinking a little wine for his
[9:55] stomach's sake. In 1 Timothy 5:23,
[9:58] Trophamus had an illness in Malum. He
[10:01] was not healed according to 2 Timothy
[10:03] 4:20.
[10:05] The Old Testament prophet Elisha was not
[10:08] healed of his final illness according to
[10:11] 2 Kings 13:14.
[10:13] And remember friends, he did twice as
[10:15] many miracles as Elijah. But Elijah was
[10:17] raptured, he was not, although he did
[10:19] twice as many miracles and had a double
[10:22] anointing.
[10:23] And then the Old Testament patriarch
[10:25] Jacob had a dislocated hip and he limped
[10:27] for life. As far as we know, he was
[10:29] never healed of that limp. according to
[10:30] Genesis 32 24-31.
[10:34] Let's move on to the second part here.
[10:36] Let's look at brother Random's height of
[10:38] his learning regarding divine healing.
[10:41] And this pinnacle of his learning was
[10:43] that we must first receive a revelation
[10:45] for healing. So we'll look at numerous
[10:48] paragraphs here from works as faith
[10:50] expressed. This subject starts around
[10:52] paragraph 92 and goes to paragraph 105.
[10:57] In paragraph 92, Brother Ram's talking
[10:59] about people misunderstanding divine
[11:00] healing. He said people gets emotion.
[11:02] They try to work on emotion, but that
[11:04] won't work. Brother Ram talks about he
[11:07] and brother Gerholtzer, we're old men.
[11:09] We've been in divine healing a long
[11:11] time. We've seen the pros and cons and
[11:13] everything and praying for the sick
[11:15] around the world and seeing the
[11:16] disappointments of people, seeing the
[11:18] hallelujah from every side. Then all
[11:20] this we learn by. So, Brother Ram says,
[11:22] "We learn by those that get healed and
[11:25] we learn by those who don't get healed."
[11:27] And he said, "When they first started
[11:29] preaching divine healing, it was like
[11:30] learning to swim." Brother Ram said when
[11:33] he was young in divine healing, he would
[11:35] walk out on the street night after night
[11:37] to try to get himself around to himself.
[11:40] He said it's like a little kid splashing
[11:42] the water, seeing visions, you know. He
[11:45] said when he first prayed for the sick,
[11:47] he hadn't slept for several days and
[11:48] didn't know he was talking to a man. And
[11:51] then he started crying saying he's going
[11:52] home. And the brother said, 'You can't
[11:54] go home. There's a meeting going on down
[11:56] there. Then brother Ram replied and
[11:58] said, 'Well, I'll be ready in a few
[12:00] minutes to go home. He said he was just
[12:02] beyond beside himself almost. He was a
[12:04] boy then in preaching divine healing.
[12:07] Then brother Ram said, "It's like
[12:09] learning to swim. When you first swim
[12:11] it, you splash the water and go across
[12:13] the pool. But after you learn to swim,
[12:16] more graceful is the stroke. It don't
[12:18] wear you out so much." See, that's it.
[12:20] that you learn how to do it and cut
[12:21] every corner, make it better, and that's
[12:23] more of an ease. See, just like a little
[12:26] boy learning how to walk, he says he
[12:29] might fall down a dozen times and get
[12:30] worn out before he gets there, but an
[12:32] athlete could walk right down the aisle,
[12:35] never even notice doing it. And he said,
[12:38] "That's the same way with preaching
[12:40] divine healing or anything else. As you
[12:42] go along, you begin to learn. If you
[12:44] don't learn, there's something wrong.
[12:46] See, you've got to learn. And you've got
[12:47] to learn how to accept God and what it
[12:49] really means.
[12:51] So notice, friends, something's wrong if
[12:53] people are not learning about the
[12:54] gospel, the majors and the minors. If
[12:57] preachers just preach the same thing
[12:58] year after year and they're not
[13:00] learning, something's wrong. We've got
[13:02] to learn. We got to grow in grace and
[13:04] knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ. In
[13:06] paragraph 100, Brother Ram says,
[13:08] "Sometimes we say, well, this guy didn't
[13:10] have enough faith. This guy didn't do
[13:12] this and this. There's a reason there
[13:14] for that. There's a reason. Sometimes
[13:16] it's unconfessed sin. So it's true.
[13:19] Sometimes people don't get healed
[13:20] because of unconfessed sin. Sometimes
[13:22] they don't have enough faith.
[13:25] But the Ram said, "You could pour a
[13:26] gallon of oil on a person and scream
[13:27] till you got horse. It'll never move
[13:29] that devil." No, sir. You've got to
[13:30] confess that. That's what the
[13:32] discernment does. Say, "Go make that
[13:35] right. Bring that out."
[13:37] Paragraph 101. But it's so slow doing
[13:39] that. Then the rest of them get
[13:41] impatient and they say, "Ah, I never got
[13:43] prayed for." So there's another reason
[13:45] people don't get healed. Impatience.
[13:47] Then brother Ram says, "But we want to
[13:49] find a way." Now what takes place, the
[13:52] real basis of divine healing, and
[13:53] remember friends, it's going to be the
[13:55] revealed will of God. The basis for
[13:58] divine healing is finding first the will
[14:00] of God. Then brother Ram says, you can't
[14:03] base your eternal destination on gifts.
[14:05] You can't major on a minor. Satan can
[14:07] impersonate any gift God's got. He talks
[14:10] about how demons shout, demons speak in
[14:13] tongues. He said, "And people sometime
[14:15] who don't know the difference declare
[14:16] this to be real when it isn't real." He
[14:20] says the same thing with divine healing
[14:21] in paragraph 104. They think, well, it's
[14:24] a hocus pocus or something like that. It
[14:26] isn't. It's a genuine unadulterated
[14:29] faith in what God said to be the truth.
[14:31] And that anchors and when it anchors,
[14:33] there's nothing going to move it. It's
[14:34] going to stay there.
[14:37] And then he gets to the second time he
[14:38] uses the word revelation in this sermon.
[14:41] Now faith is a revelation from God.
[14:43] That's where I want to stay there just a
[14:45] moment. It's a revelation. He has
[14:47] revealed it to you by his grace. Now
[14:50] notice these words. This is so powerful.
[14:52] It's nothing you did. So some people
[14:54] think I have to do something to get
[14:55] healed. Brother Ram said it's nothing
[14:57] you did. You didn't work yourself up
[14:59] into faith. You ever have faith, it's g
[15:02] to you by the grace of God and God
[15:04] reveals it to you. Therefore, faith is a
[15:06] revelation. And the whole church of God
[15:08] is built upon the revelation.
[15:10] So, this is brother Ram's summary of
[15:12] what he learned about divine healing.
[15:15] Divine healing, he says, is by grace.
[15:18] It's not something you did. You didn't
[15:20] work yourself up into it. You have faith
[15:23] because God gave it to you by grace. And
[15:26] that faith is a revelation.
[15:28] Before leaving this section, I found
[15:31] there's 68 quotes where brother Ram
[15:33] talks about a positive mental attitude
[15:36] toward any divine promise of God will
[15:38] bring it to pass. So, it seems to me
[15:40] that this is what brother Random thought
[15:42] previously to November 1965, it seemed
[15:46] like early in brother Ram's ministry, he
[15:48] simply taught just take a positive
[15:50] attitude, a positive mental attitude
[15:52] toward any promise of God, and God will
[15:54] bring it to pass. But friends, after the
[15:56] seven seals were preached, there's only
[15:58] one quote where brother Ram talks about
[16:00] the positive mental attitude. The last
[16:03] quote was in June 6th, 1963, show us the
[16:07] father. Quote, if you can take the right
[16:10] mental attitude toward any divine
[16:12] promise of God, he will bring it to
[16:14] pass. End quote. Now, friends, I'm open
[16:17] to correction, but that's what I found.
[16:19] And this ties in perfectly again with
[16:21] the Sister Stad example from Germany.
[16:24] Brother Random said, "Sister Stadcliffe
[16:26] had great faith, but yet it was God's
[16:28] will, God's clear-cut decision to take
[16:31] the baby home." God told Brother Ram,
[16:33] "Don't rebuke that because it was the
[16:35] hand of the Lord. Don't rebuke the fact
[16:37] that God let the baby die and took the
[16:40] baby home because it was the hand of the
[16:41] Lord." So, Sister Stadf could have tried
[16:44] to have a right positive mental attitude
[16:47] toward the promise of God that he raises
[16:48] the dead, but it would not have mattered
[16:50] because it it was the will of God to
[16:53] take the baby home.
[16:54] &gt;&gt; There was something moving in the room.
[16:56] I jumped up and I said, "Lord, what
[16:58] would you have your servant know?" said,
[16:59] "Do not rebuke that. That's the hand of
[17:01] the Lord." So, I got her on the phone. I
[17:04] said, "No, God has called your baby."
[17:06] And so when she come over to see us and
[17:09] I left her at the house when I left
[17:10] yesterday, she said, "What was it,
[17:12] brother Benam? My my weakness of faith."
[17:15] I said, "You have great faith. You
[17:17] prayed for your baby. You and your
[17:18] husband held on to God to raise that
[17:20] baby and he refused to do it because he
[17:23] knows what's best." And still you love
[17:24] him. That's real faith.
[17:26] &gt;&gt; Anybody when mountains are moving and
[17:28] things can have faith, but let it go
[17:29] backwards one time and see how it works.
[17:31] That's when you prove whether you got
[17:33] faith or not. Every son that cometh to
[17:35] God must be chasened in trial of God. So
[17:38] remember our tri trials works patience
[17:40] and patience works hope and so forth.
[17:44] This Lutheran minister said, "Why don't
[17:46] you wait till you get a clear cut
[17:48] decision from God like brother Brandon
[17:51] did and then you know what you're
[17:52] talking about." Now that is it, brother.
[17:54] If we'll just not jump at conclusions
[17:56] and wait and get a clean clear cut
[17:59] decision from God.
[18:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. So this shows the growth in
[18:02] brother Ram's ministry in the beginning
[18:05] and throughout his ministry. He thought
[18:08] just any positive mental attitude would
[18:10] bring any promise of God to pass. But he
[18:12] found out later first you must find the
[18:14] will of God for each situation. Let God
[18:17] reveal his will for every situation. And
[18:20] then God will bring his will to pass as
[18:23] we yield to his will. And friends, a lot
[18:26] of the prosperity message preachers that
[18:28] I've heard and of course other
[18:29] Pentecostal preachers, they often use
[18:32] this quote just have a positive mental
[18:34] attitude toward any promise of God and
[18:36] God will bring it to pass. But again, we
[18:38] don't see Brother Bram emphasizing this
[18:40] after the seven seals. Only one time
[18:42] after the seven seals did he make this
[18:44] quotation. Friends, we've come to the
[18:46] end of part one of this video series. It
[18:48] seems like this is going to be a longer
[18:50] video here by God's grace. So, I'll stop
[18:52] here with part one. Hope it's been a
[18:54] blessing by the grace of God. We thank
[18:56] God for the revelation on divine healing
[18:59] to first find the will of God for our
[19:02] situation.
[19:03] If you have any questions, concerns or
[19:05] testimonies about this video, please
[19:06] contact me.
[19:08] God bless you and may Jesus [music]
[19:10] Christ be the desire of your heart.
[19:14] very happy to be here this afternoon and
[19:16] again in defense of the gospel of Jesus
[19:18] Christ to bring the good tidings, the
[19:21] good news that Jesus raised from the
[19:23] dead, living among man today, his
[19:25] church. [music]
[19:27] The same Jesus that was yesterday will
[19:29] be today and forever
[19:32] is never failed.
