[0:00] [Music]
[0:02] the other day I got something mixed up I
[0:05] happen to hear it yes I've caught it
[0:06] right there and it's on the tape if you
[0:08] happen to catch that on your tape
[0:09] remember look in the Bible do you see
[0:13] greetings friends in the mattress name
[0:15] of the Lord Jesus Christ this is part
[0:18] three of the video series called 60 plus
[0:21] proofs the tapes of brother Branham have
[0:24] mistakes yet he's a true prophet
[0:27] here in part three we'll cover proofs
[0:30] numbers 43 through 69 that the tapes of
[0:34] God's Prophet brother Bynum have human
[0:36] mistakes yet he's a true prophet of God
[0:39] there'll be times that I'll say 66
[0:41] mistakes but while I was listening to
[0:42] brother Branham in my free time I found
[0:44] three other human mistakes so I thought
[0:46] I would add them to this list and
[0:48] perhaps at some point in the future as I
[0:50] compile more I'll make another video but
[0:52] as for now this will be the third and
[0:54] final part of this series
[0:57] number 43 is from June 63
[1:01] brother Adam said quote God give me to
[1:02] understand I shouldn't do that because
[1:04] that's many of them are still his
[1:07] children end quote
[1:09] brother brand was saying God told him
[1:11] not to say Ricky and raquetta anymore
[1:12] but I want you to notice brother Graham
[1:15] disobeyed what God showed him and he
[1:17] continued saying Ricky and raquetta a
[1:19] few times after this
[1:21] for example 1965 does God ever change
[1:23] his mind about his word quote you'll
[1:26] have a bunch of regattas that's exactly
[1:28] right a bunch of little painted up
[1:29] Jezebels end quote
[1:32] so if you believe every word is thus
[1:34] saith the Lord You Have To purposely
[1:35] ignore the numerous times brother random
[1:37] used ricotta even after God told him not
[1:39] to
[1:40] number 44 is from June of 63. brother
[1:44] Graham said Martin Luther King Jr would
[1:46] lead millions in a hitler-like death
[1:48] trap quote just like Hitler did over in
[1:51] Germany LED them right into the death
[1:53] trap and that's exactly the same thing
[1:55] and remember I'm on tape you'll see it
[1:57] after maybe after I'm gone that's
[1:58] exactly what's going to happen then
[2:00] precious people will die down there like
[2:02] flies starts a revolutionary both white
[2:05] and colored will fight again and die
[2:06] like flies end quote friends this was
[2:09] not thus saith the Lord because brother
[2:11] bran was asked about it later a month
[2:13] later and he cares do you care well the
[2:15] ram said quote I have nothing on it from
[2:17] the Lord I could be altogether wrong in
[2:19] my thought about Martin Luther King I
[2:21] don't know I can't say that's just my
[2:23] opinion end quote
[2:25] so we see two important things here are
[2:27] the Rams predictions about Martin Luther
[2:29] King Jr beating Millions into a death
[2:31] trap did not come to pass because it was
[2:33] just a human thought a human prediction
[2:35] but then we also see him Clearly say
[2:38] that his opinions are not thus saith the
[2:40] Lord he said I had nothing on it from
[2:42] the Lord so this again proves
[2:43] brotherbraham's opinions were no
[2:45] different than anyone else's just like
[2:47] brother Rams said
[2:48] number 45 is from July 63 brother Ram
[2:51] said Caleb and Joshua held up Moses's
[2:54] hands he said quote you people here hold
[2:57] him up like Joshua and Caleb held up the
[2:59] hands of Moses end quote but of course
[3:02] it wasn't Caleb and Joshua it was Aaron
[3:05] and her in Exodus 17 verse 12. so what
[3:09] is the rightly divided word of truth I
[3:11] believe the scripture is Right Exodus 17
[3:13] verse 12 and brother Graham just
[3:15] misquoted the scripture programs
[3:17] forgetful Human Side was seen just like
[3:19] it is seen in all of our lives in my
[3:21] life in everyone's life
[3:23] number 46 is from November 1963. brother
[3:27] Branham agreed with a woman's dream that
[3:29] predicted his death by gunshot going
[3:31] into a meeting he'd get out of his car
[3:34] and be shot by the church quote I seen
[3:37] them that church fixed the way is going
[3:38] to kill me secretly sometime when I'm
[3:40] getting out of my car going and be fired
[3:43] from but said then the spirit said not
[3:45] at this time but it'll come later aha
[3:48] end quote so again the sister's dream
[3:50] was not thus saith the Lord Brother
[3:52] Brown did not die by a gunshot right
[3:55] after leaving his car going in to preach
[3:57] a meeting
[3:58] we all know how brother Ram died so of
[4:00] course this quote is not thus saith the
[4:02] Lord although he agreed with his
[4:03] sister's dream saying aha
[4:06] number 47 is the last one from 1963 from
[4:09] November brother said quote and in this
[4:12] would be a woman stand up that would
[4:14] govern the United States not actually a
[4:15] woman but a church end quote so here
[4:18] brother Ram says the sixth major vision
[4:20] would not be a literal woman it would be
[4:22] a church but yet in 1956 brother Ram
[4:25] said in God's covenant with Abraham I
[4:27] predict this that a woman will be
[4:29] president before we're annihilated
[4:30] that's right I said that in 1933 by
[4:33] Vision end quote so which is right is
[4:36] the sixth Vision going to be a woman or
[4:38] a church well really none of us know
[4:40] it's my personal opinion it'll be a
[4:42] church but a lot of message preachers
[4:43] think it's Kamala Harris but I just
[4:45] bring this out to make a point not every
[4:47] word on tape is thus say the Lord
[4:49] because in one quote brother Brandon
[4:51] says not a woman a church but earlier he
[4:53] said it would be a literal woman so
[4:55] again both of these quotes cannot be
[4:57] true because they contradict themselves
[4:58] and time will tell and God will
[5:00] interpret his word the way he wants to
[5:02] bring it to pass as he always has done
[5:05] moving ahead into 1964 in February
[5:08] brother Ram said the church ages started
[5:10] in 33 A.D quote he starts from his first
[5:13] church age which began at 80 33 and he
[5:17] started the countdown end quote now
[5:19] friends this contradicts what brother I
[5:21] am taught in the church age book when he
[5:22] said the first church age started in 53
[5:24] A.D so which one is true to me friends
[5:27] and my humble opinion it doesn't really
[5:29] matter when the church age started if
[5:31] you define the church as the group that
[5:33] had the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[5:35] the church age started in 30 A.D as I
[5:38] believe that's the correct date of Jesus
[5:39] death and then the Holy Ghost falling 50
[5:42] days later others think the church ages
[5:44] started in 53 A.D because of the church
[5:46] starting in Ephesus at that time so
[5:48] either way it doesn't matter to me the
[5:50] main thing is that we have the baptism
[5:51] of the Holy Ghost but the point I'm
[5:53] trying to make is that brother Reynold
[5:54] gave two different start dates for the
[5:56] church ages and both can't be right
[5:58] because they contradict themselves
[6:00] number 49 is from July 64. but the Rams
[6:04] said the day of atonement was more than
[6:06] seven sabbaths from Pentecost quote from
[6:08] the Feast of Pentecost to the Feast of
[6:10] the atonement was 50 days end quote now
[6:13] brother random caught this mistake and
[6:14] even admitted that this was a mistake on
[6:16] the tapes a month later and questions
[6:18] and answers part 164 quote like the
[6:21] other day I got something mixed up I
[6:23] happen to hear it and it's I caught it
[6:25] right there and it's on the tape and I
[6:28] I'll probably hear from it if you happen
[6:30] to get it or anything on that tape it
[6:32] should be not the seventh month after
[6:34] that brought in the Feast of the
[6:35] trumpets which meant the seven Church
[6:37] ages seven months not seven sabbaths but
[6:40] if you happen to catch that on your tape
[6:41] remember look in the Bible
[6:43] number 50 is also from July 64. quote
[6:47] and Jesus never referred to himself as
[6:49] Son of God he referred to himself always
[6:52] as son of man end quote
[6:54] so brother Brown thought Jesus never
[6:55] called himself the Son of God but that
[6:57] goes against scripture if you read John
[7:00] 9 35-38 and John 10 34-36 Jesus referred
[7:05] to himself as Son of God
[7:07] the red letter words in John 9 35 Dost
[7:10] thou believe on the Son of God and then
[7:13] in John 10 36 because I said I am the
[7:15] son of God
[7:16] so which is true of course the scripture
[7:18] is true Jesus Christ did refer to
[7:20] himself as the son of God
[7:23] number 51 is from August 64. questions
[7:27] answers part one quote you're a dual
[7:29] person three people in one soul body and
[7:32] spirit end quote
[7:34] brother Ram said this a few times that
[7:36] each of us were three persons like in a
[7:39] trial 1964 quote now see just like I am
[7:42] three persons end quote he even said
[7:45] this in things that are to be 65 quote
[7:48] there's three people of you end quote
[7:51] of course in chapter one of the church
[7:53] age book brother man said quote how can
[7:55] three persons be in one God not only is
[7:57] there no Bible for it but it shows even
[7:59] a lack of intelligent reasoning end
[8:01] quote
[8:02] so if God's not three persons and we're
[8:04] in the image of God we cannot be three
[8:06] persons so of course this is just a slip
[8:08] of the tongue for brother Branham when
[8:10] he calls himself three people it says
[8:13] each one of us are three persons
[8:15] he means three kind of relationships or
[8:17] three titles in one person such as a
[8:20] husband father and son
[8:23] moving ahead to 1965 this is number 52
[8:27] in the seated discrepancy brother Bram
[8:29] said quote he never had no real real
[8:32] Faith he had what he thought was a faith
[8:34] end quote so brother Adam said Judas
[8:37] never had no real Faith but remember
[8:38] earlier in 1964 brother Braham said he
[8:42] had genuine justification genuine
[8:44] sanctification and his name was on the
[8:46] Lamb's Book of Life brother Graham said
[8:48] in one place but of course we know later
[8:50] brother Ram said any name on the Lamb's
[8:52] Book of Life cannot be blotted out so we
[8:55] could actually make this number 52 and
[8:57] 53.
[8:58] and questions and answers part 364
[9:01] brother Rams said quote I mentioned that
[9:03] Judas had his name on The Book of Life
[9:05] now that's true end quote so brother I'm
[9:08] taught Judas was saved in one place and
[9:10] then a year later said Judas never had
[9:12] real Faith to begin with so what's the
[9:14] truth it seems from the scripture Judas
[9:16] did have real Faith as the Bible gives
[9:19] at least 13 metaphors of people who can
[9:21] start with faith but then be a Castaway
[9:23] or be Shipwrecked or be apostate and
[9:27] leave the faith in Matthew 13 Jesus said
[9:30] the seed that falls on the Stony hearted
[9:32] ground believes for a while endures for
[9:34] a while but then the time of offense
[9:37] transgresses against the word of God and
[9:39] leaves the faith so Jesus Christ himself
[9:41] said you can believe for a while
[9:43] genuinely believe but then lose your
[9:45] salvation
[9:46] and then number 53 brother Brandon said
[9:49] judas's name was on the Lamb's Book of
[9:51] Life in questions and answers part one
[9:52] quote was Judas iscariot's name blotted
[9:55] out of the Lamb's Book of Life or was it
[9:57] ever on it yes it was on it and was
[10:00] blotted out end quote
[10:02] but then the church age book brother Ram
[10:04] said quote those whose names are placed
[10:06] in a section of the Lamb's Book of Life
[10:08] and cannot be erased for their names are
[10:10] the names of his bride then we must
[10:12] accept that end quote
[10:14] so brother Rams said in the church age
[10:16] book names cannot be blotted out of the
[10:18] Lamb's Book of Life and the next
[10:20] sentence says but names can be blotted
[10:22] out of The Book of Life
[10:24] also in chapter 7 of the church age book
[10:27] brother Brandon said the names on the
[10:28] Lamb's Book of Life cannot be removed
[10:31] under any circumstance yet in 1964
[10:34] brother random said Judas iscariot's
[10:37] name was removed from the Lamb's Book
[10:39] here's the church age Book quote quote
[10:42] we will also show that there is a group
[10:44] of people whose names having been placed
[10:47] on that record before the foundation of
[10:49] the world cannot under any circumstances
[10:51] have those names removed end quote
[10:55] and then remember in August 1964
[10:57] questions and answers part one that's
[10:59] brother Brandon quote was Judas
[11:01] iscariot's name blotted out of the
[11:03] Lamb's Book of Life or was it ever on it
[11:05] yes it was on it and was blotted out end
[11:09] quote
[11:09] so here we see brother random group and
[11:11] his Revelation about the Lamb's Book of
[11:13] Life that doesn't stumble us he was
[11:15] human and neither of these quotes were
[11:17] thus saith the Lord so we appreciate the
[11:19] Holy Ghost guiding brother Branham into
[11:21] all truth
[11:23] number 54 is from February 65 marriage
[11:26] and divorce brother Ram said quote Jacob
[11:29] out of whom come the Patriarchs he had
[11:32] at least a dozen Wives end quote brother
[11:34] Ram claimed Jacob had at least a dozen
[11:36] wives but this Bible says he only had
[11:38] four wives so which is the rightly
[11:40] divided word of truth of course the
[11:43] Bible's right Jacob only had four wives
[11:44] because he promised his father-in-law
[11:46] Laban he would not marry any other wives
[11:48] and so again we see brother Ram just had
[11:50] a slip of the tongue or a forgetful
[11:52] memory regarding how many wives Jacob
[11:54] had
[11:55] number 55 is from who is this
[11:57] Melchizedek program said quote that's
[12:00] the reason Jesus note all things because
[12:02] he was the word before he was flesh end
[12:05] quote so here brother Ram said Jesus
[12:07] knew all things because he was a
[12:09] theophany before he came flesh but the
[12:12] Bible says Jesus didn't know all things
[12:14] in his Earthly human body the Bible said
[12:16] Jesus did not know the day or the hour
[12:18] Jesus said the son and Angels don't know
[12:21] only the Father Knows in Matthew 24 36
[12:25] and also Mark 13 32.
[12:29] and even in this quote brother random
[12:30] makes it sound like theophies know all
[12:32] things but again that's not true angels
[12:34] are in theophanese and they don't know
[12:36] the coming of Jesus in The Rapture they
[12:38] don't know the day or the hour According
[12:40] To Jesus even the Saints who are in
[12:42] heaven don't know only the father knows
[12:44] the day and the hour so of course there
[12:46] is information theophanes don't know
[12:48] there's some information that God keeps
[12:50] just to himself
[12:52] number 56 is from April 65 brother Ram
[12:55] said quote the schools in Arizona where
[12:58] I live and 80 percent of the children in
[13:00] school is mentally what will
[13:02] their children be we can't have another
[13:04] generation we're at the end end quote
[13:07] so 57 years ago brother Ram said Arizona
[13:09] would not have another generation here
[13:12] we are if a generation is 40 years then
[13:14] we've already had another generation
[13:16] another generation in Arizona did rise
[13:18] up if time keeps going on there will be
[13:21] another generation so again this was
[13:22] just brother Ram's humble opinion but of
[13:25] course it wasn't thus saith the Lord
[13:27] number 57 is from September 65. brother
[13:30] Ram said quote you are 80 something
[13:33] percent of water and petroleum anyhow
[13:35] and you've got to take these sources in
[13:37] to keep you alive end quote
[13:40] now I mentioned this in part one but
[13:42] petroleum is toxic to any living thing
[13:44] whether it's human plant or animal there
[13:47] is no petroleum or diesel or gasoline or
[13:50] kerosene in the human body so again this
[13:52] just shows how brother Brown was human
[13:54] he was fallible he didn't know all
[13:55] things and of course this wasn't thus
[13:57] saith the Lord
[13:59] number 58 is from November 65 what house
[14:03] will you Bill me Billy Graham said quote
[14:05] that was the Old Testament the first
[14:07] four books Genesis Leviticus Deuteronomy
[14:10] and exodus end quote so of course
[14:12] brother Graham left out the fifth book
[14:13] The Book of Numbers because the Old
[14:15] Testament originally was the Torah which
[14:18] is five books so of course this
[14:20] statement was not thus saith the Lord
[14:21] the Torah was composed of Five Books not
[14:24] four books
[14:25] number 59 is from the Rapture and I had
[14:28] this in part one brother bam said the
[14:30] Rapture was in second Thessalonians the
[14:32] fourth chapter quote and the second is
[14:34] fulfilled in second Thessalonians the
[14:36] fourth chapter I would not have you
[14:38] ignorant Brethren concerning those
[14:39] asleep end quote of course there is no
[14:43] second Thessalonians chapter four his
[14:45] first Thessalonians chapter 4.
[14:48] number 60 is from the Rapture again
[14:50] December 65 where the ram said quote but
[14:53] nobody set before a prophet because he
[14:55] was he was absolutely the word of God
[14:56] end quote
[14:58] now on one hand a prophet cannot be
[15:00] corrected with thus saith the Lord but
[15:02] the human side of the Prophet can be
[15:03] corrected so here brother random makes
[15:05] it sound like a prophet can never be
[15:07] corrected but in 1950 brother Ram said
[15:10] he was corrected by Brother Sharon quote
[15:12] brother Shara a man corrected me on that
[15:14] he said brother Branham I hate to
[15:15] correct you on anything but said you're
[15:17] mistaken there he said you've caused
[15:19] those people for not receiving their
[15:22] presence and you cause them to lose
[15:23] their their reward he said it's more
[15:25] blessed to give than it is to receive
[15:27] end quote and brother Brown even hoped
[15:29] for correction in the god who's rich in
[15:31] Mercy 65 quote with such theologians
[15:34] behind me and maybe they will correct me
[15:36] when I'm wrong I hope so end quote
[15:39] so we have an example of brother brand
[15:41] being corrected by Brother Sharon and
[15:43] then hoping to be corrected by
[15:45] theologians so the idea that a prophet
[15:47] can never be corrected is wrong
[15:49] so if you cannot correct a profit the
[15:52] profit is infallible he's equal to God
[15:55] and if you cannot correct a prophet then
[15:57] Peter was not a prophet but we know he
[15:59] was because Paul corrected Peter in
[16:01] Galatians chapter 2. Peter would not
[16:04] have fellowship with the Gentiles
[16:05] because he was fearful of the Jewish
[16:07] teachers and so he would not eat with
[16:09] the Gentiles but Paul corrected him to
[16:12] his face
[16:13] and friend anyone knows Peter was a
[16:15] prophet he prophesied in second Peter
[16:17] chapter 3 about the day of the Lord and
[16:19] the fervent heat that would consume the
[16:21] Earth and even brother Branham called
[16:23] Peter a prophet in 1961 God being
[16:26] misunderstood quote
[16:28] then God had a prophet there who could
[16:30] stand up and speak Peter said you men of
[16:33] Jerusalem and you that dwell in Judea
[16:34] don't misunderstand this end quote
[16:38] so if you believe a prophet cannot be
[16:41] corrected then you're making brother
[16:42] Ram's own words contradict themselves
[16:44] because brother Rams said Peter was a
[16:47] prophet and yet he was corrected by Paul
[16:49] if you cannot correct a profit then you
[16:52] would have to come to the conclusion
[16:53] that brother Bram lied or was deceived
[16:55] numerous times when he said he was
[16:58] corrected by his wife brother Sharett
[17:00] and other people
[17:02] number 61 is from leadership 65. brother
[17:06] Ram said unbelievers would go into an
[17:08] eternal hell quote go into eternal hell
[17:11] that's been prepared for the devil and
[17:13] his angels end quote and four months
[17:16] before this in the thinking man's filter
[17:17] by the ram said quote there's no such
[17:19] thing as eternal hell end quote
[17:22] so what's the truth the truth is hell is
[17:24] not Eternal as brother I am taught
[17:25] repeatedly and of course the statement
[17:27] from leadership going to eternal hell
[17:29] that's likely a slip of the tongue
[17:32] number 62 is from and knoweth and not
[17:34] August 65. brother Ram said quote as far
[17:37] as I know I don't see anything to hinder
[17:39] at this time the coming of the Lord
[17:41] Jesus outside of the Readiness of his
[17:43] church end quote so brother Adam saw
[17:46] nothing to hinder the coming of the Lord
[17:48] outside of the Readiness of the church
[17:49] but yet we know there's numerous Old
[17:52] Testament scriptures that still need to
[17:53] be fulfilled in relation to Israel
[17:55] there's many Jews still returning to
[17:57] Israel at this time such as Jews who are
[18:01] living in Ethiopia returning to Israel
[18:03] just within the last few months brother
[18:06] Ram thought just the Readiness of the
[18:07] church was keeping the coming of the
[18:09] Lord but there's also other scriptures
[18:11] like the return of the Jews that need to
[18:13] be fulfilled as well
[18:15] moving into the church age book number
[18:17] 63
[18:20] this was likely Lee vale's mistake but
[18:22] he quoted the wrong scripture quote her
[18:24] Zeo has literally been that of the Jews
[18:27] John 2 verse 17 the Zeal of thine house
[18:30] hath eat me up but it is a wrong Zeal
[18:32] end quote
[18:34] John 2 17 is not about the Jews it's
[18:37] about Jesus Christ Jesus Christ had Zeal
[18:41] for the house of the Lord which is why
[18:42] he cleaned it out on two occasions at
[18:45] the beginning of his ministry and the
[18:46] end of his ministry so it seems like
[18:48] levale as Eder the church age book put
[18:50] the wrong scripture in the church age
[18:52] book the Jews had Zeal for their own
[18:54] man-made Creeds or their own traditions
[18:56] of man as Jesus said in Matthew chapter
[18:58] 15 and those Creeds were of none effect
[19:01] historians say they had the mishnah
[19:04] which was their own interpretation of
[19:06] the Torah and remember friends brother
[19:08] random was excited about and supported
[19:10] the printing of the church age book and
[19:13] it was printed during his lifetime less
[19:15] than a month before he passed away and
[19:17] he hoped many people would read it
[19:19] and I do believe there are wonderful
[19:20] truths within the church age book but
[19:23] this shows a wrong scripture quoted
[19:26] number 64 is also from the church age
[19:28] book a wrong scripture is referenced
[19:31] quote in Revelation 14 the Beast that
[19:33] was wounded unto death but lived again
[19:35] is Imperial Pagan Rome end quote if
[19:39] anyone reads Revelation chapter 14 it
[19:41] doesn't talk about the Beast so again
[19:43] Lee Vale probably wrote the wrong
[19:45] chapter it's Revelation 13 Verse 3 and I
[19:48] saw one of his heads as it were wounded
[19:50] to death and his deadly wound was healed
[19:53] end quote so again not every word in the
[19:56] church age book was thus saith the Lord
[19:58] as Branham Tabernacle declares
[20:00] number 65 in the church age book Brother
[20:03] Anderson quote you want to know if I
[20:04] believe in the doctrine of pre-existence
[20:06] I don't believe in that Mormon doctrine
[20:08] of the pre-existence of souls any more
[20:10] than I believe in reincarnation or the
[20:12] transmigration of souls end quote
[20:15] so here brother Ram says he does not
[20:16] believe in the pre-existence of Souls
[20:18] which means we could not have been the
[20:21] sons of God that shouted for Joy at the
[20:23] foundation of the world because if we
[20:25] were then we would already had
[20:27] pre-existed outside of the mind of God
[20:29] but the Bible says in Ephesians 1 we
[20:31] were chosen in Christ before the
[20:33] foundational World chosen in the mind of
[20:35] God
[20:36] now twice brother Graham said we were
[20:38] the sons of God shouting for Joy spoken
[20:40] of in the Book of Job but again those
[20:42] had to be angels as sons of God they
[20:44] could not have been Believers such as us
[20:46] because we did not pre-exist before
[20:48] coming from the mind of God to flesh and
[20:51] brother man said that in 1955 beginning
[20:53] in any of the Gentile dispensation quote
[20:55] see we come out of Eternity we was
[20:58] before there was a world did you know
[20:59] that the morning Stars shouted for Joy
[21:02] them singing them shining one shouted
[21:04] for Joy when they seen that someday they
[21:07] were Tabernacle they were tabernacled
[21:09] here on Earth end quote and again in
[21:11] 1958 he said that we were the sons of
[21:14] God shouting for joy in the serpent seed
[21:16] quote who is this job 27 38 when the
[21:20] morning Stars sang together and the sons
[21:22] of God shouted for Joy we're not
[21:24] creatures of time we're creatures of
[21:26] Eternity end quote
[21:28] also this quote about the pre-existence
[21:30] of souls means that brother random could
[21:32] not have been the angel ministering to
[21:34] John the Divine as he wrote the Book of
[21:36] Revelation which Branham Tabernacle
[21:39] falsely teaches if they believe brother
[21:41] Branham was that angel that talked to
[21:43] John then they have to deny this quote
[21:46] we did not have a pre-existence of souls
[21:48] before we came to this earth brother
[21:50] random said we bypassed our theophany
[21:52] and went from thought to flesh
[21:55] and brother Adam said this and who is
[21:56] this Melchizedek 1965 quote and then you
[21:59] see you come right down the regular line
[22:01] but you bypassed the theophany and
[22:03] became flesh man to be tempted by sin
[22:06] end quote number 66 from the church age
[22:09] book brother Branham said this
[22:10] generation will not pass until all will
[22:12] be fulfilled in Matthew chapter 24. if a
[22:15] generation is 40 years friends then it's
[22:17] now been 57 years since the church age
[22:19] book was published and not all of
[22:21] Matthew 24 has come to pass if a
[22:24] generation is 40 years quote Matthew 24
[22:27] mentions signs in the heavens concerning
[22:28] this last day just before Jesus comes
[22:31] and when he the pope went to Jerusalem
[22:33] the moon or the church went to total
[22:35] darkness this is it this is the end this
[22:37] generation shall not pass away until all
[22:39] be fulfilled even so Lord Jesus come
[22:41] quickly end quote
[22:44] number 67 brother Brandon said Enoch
[22:47] served God for 500 years in the
[22:50] leadership sermon 1965 quote look at
[22:53] Enoch he walked with God for 500 years
[22:55] and then he had a testimony that he
[22:58] pleased God end quote
[23:00] friends Genesis 5 23 says in all the
[23:03] days of Enoch were 360 in five years so
[23:07] what is the rightly divided truth did
[23:09] Enoch walk with God 500 or 365 years I
[23:14] believe the scripture is the truth so I
[23:16] believe Enoch walked 365 years with God
[23:18] and when brother Branham said 500 years
[23:20] it was just brother Ram's Human Side
[23:23] being forgetful
[23:25] number 68 is about when names were
[23:28] written on the Lamb's Book of Life
[23:29] brother Brandon said in 1955 the sermon
[23:32] Fellowship that right now names are
[23:34] being written on the Lamb's Book of Life
[23:37] quote
[23:38] oh God I thank thee that in glory right
[23:41] now names are being written down in the
[23:43] Lamb's Book of Life
[23:45] keep them O Father into thy Grace end
[23:47] quote and of course numerous times after
[23:49] this brother Randolph said the names
[23:51] written on the Lamb's Book of Life were
[23:54] written before the foundation of the
[23:56] world and not in real time when
[23:58] Believers were getting saved one example
[24:01] is from two years later and Sir as we
[24:03] would see Jesus 1957 brother Ram said
[24:05] quote the poet used to sing the song We
[24:08] sang it many times in Baptist Church
[24:10] there is a new name written down in
[24:12] glory tonight you know someone wrote Oh
[24:14] my name was wrote In The Book of Life
[24:16] Tonight the poet was fine by saying that
[24:19] and it's led many souls to Christ but
[24:21] how wrong he was the Bible said that our
[24:24] names were written in the Lamb's Book of
[24:25] Life before the foundation of the world
[24:27] when was it when the lamb was slain
[24:29] every person that was ever to be saved
[24:31] was associated with a lamb in the slang
[24:34] before the foundation of the world end
[24:36] quote
[24:37] so which is the rightly divided word of
[24:39] truth I believe the latter quote is
[24:41] scripturally accurate all the names are
[24:43] written on the Lamb's Book of Life
[24:44] before the foundation of the world but
[24:47] friends there's also a truth that God
[24:49] does write down names in a book of
[24:51] remembrance according to the scriptures
[24:53] according to Malachi 3 verse 16 the
[24:57] Bible said those that fear the lord
[24:58] spake often one to another and the Lord
[25:00] hearken and heard it in a book of
[25:02] remembrance was written before him for
[25:04] them that fear the lord and that thought
[25:07] upon his name
[25:08] so there is some book in heaven that is
[25:11] currently writing down the names of
[25:12] those that fear the lord and talk about
[25:14] him in real time
[25:16] but as far as the Lamb's Book of Life is
[25:18] concerned it seems all those names are
[25:20] written before the foundation of the
[25:22] world according to Revelation 13 verse 8
[25:25] and all that dwell upon the Earth shall
[25:27] worship Him whose names are not written
[25:29] in the book of the life of the lamb
[25:31] slain from the foundation of the world
[25:34] and lastly number 69 brother Brandon
[25:37] believed he'd have a part in getting
[25:38] Israel back to the Lord Jesus before he
[25:41] died this is from Gabriel's instructions
[25:44] to Daniel 1961 brother Ram said quote
[25:47] the reason I've always believed before
[25:49] my class here that there was something
[25:51] that I'd have apart before I die of
[25:54] getting Israel back to the Lord because
[25:56] when the very hour by the Pan-American
[25:59] chart that Israel was declared a nation
[26:01] for the first time for 2 000 years since
[26:03] they've been scattered not a people it
[26:05] was that very same hour exactly to the
[26:07] hour that the angel Lord met me up
[26:09] yonder and sent me to the with the
[26:11] gospel the very same thing May the 7th
[26:14] 1946 end quote
[26:17] here it seems brother random believed he
[26:19] would have a part through his prophetic
[26:20] gift interning the blinded Israel back
[26:23] to the Lord Jesus Christ in other quotes
[26:26] he believed that as well
[26:27] that Israel needed to see a prophet and
[26:29] brother Branham had a prophetic gift
[26:31] and brother Graham believe in this quote
[26:33] that he would help turn blinded Israel
[26:36] back to Christ before he died
[26:38] but of course this was just his own
[26:40] human thought his own human desire his
[26:43] love for all people but especially
[26:44] Israel with his human desire he hoped he
[26:47] could use his prophetic gift to open the
[26:49] blinded eyes of Israel and turn them to
[26:51] Jesus Christ but of course we know this
[26:54] did not happen before brother random
[26:55] died in 1965. Israel still blinded today
[26:59] and it seems the blindness will only be
[27:01] removed after Jesus is finished saving
[27:04] every Gentile Soul according to Luke 21
[27:07] verse 24 Jesus said Jerusalem will be
[27:09] trodden down until the times of the
[27:11] Gentiles be fulfilled
[27:14] a plea and prayer for tape worshipers to
[27:16] repent
[27:18] friends the reason I made this long list
[27:21] of 66 proofs the tapes have honest human
[27:24] mistakes of brother Branham was to try
[27:25] to plead with tape worshipers to not say
[27:28] every word on tape is thus saith the
[27:30] Lord anyone who believes that is either
[27:32] completely ignorant or completely insane
[27:34] because if you cannot recognize truth
[27:36] then you have been Anointed with a
[27:38] spirit of delusion now of course it's
[27:41] also possible some of these people in
[27:43] the tape Church movement are saved but
[27:45] if that's the case they have an awful
[27:47] sinful complex of Pride and the spirit
[27:50] of idolatry worshiping the tapes
[27:52] exalting every word to infallibility
[27:54] saying every word is thus saith the Lord
[27:56] so my plea is friends in the Tate Church
[27:59] movement be honest before God humble
[28:01] yourself look at these 66 clear simple
[28:04] examples that there are contradictions
[28:06] on the tapes of brother Branham he was a
[28:08] man he was human he even admitted
[28:10] numerous times to making mistakes on the
[28:12] tapes and said he did it all the time of
[28:15] course when he said thus saith the Lord
[28:16] there was no mistake in that but of
[28:18] course not every statement on tape is
[28:20] thus said the Lord let's have a prayer
[28:23] friends for all these people who are
[28:24] worshiping the tapes
[28:26] father God in humility Lord God we just
[28:29] ask God that this video and the facts
[28:31] and truths on this video could be used
[28:34] to help these tape worshipers repent
[28:36] of their idolatry whether they're
[28:38] ignorant of it or whether they're aware
[28:40] of it Lord only you can bring them to
[28:42] repentance Dear God
[28:44] and the scripture says the goodness of
[28:45] God leads them to repentance so Lord let
[28:48] your goodness and your spirit of Truth
[28:50] speak to them again today
[28:52] whenever they'll watch this and may they
[28:54] humble themselves and stop saying that
[28:56] every word on the tape is thus saith the
[28:58] Lord
[28:59] Lord we know all the elect will receive
[29:01] this Truth for the elect cannot be
[29:03] deceived into saying every word brother
[29:05] Ram said was thus saith the Lord so we
[29:07] thank you for your grace and mercy Lord
[29:08] I pray you hear our humble prayer save
[29:11] what you can dear God by your grace and
[29:13] mercy deliver these people from their
[29:15] complexes
[29:16] and if they're not saved may they repent
[29:19] of their Spirit of idolatry and get
[29:21] saved through the blood of Jesus Christ
[29:23] we thank you for your mercy in Jesus
[29:25] Christ's name amen
[29:30] in closing
[29:32] friends I hope this exhaustive list of
[29:34] 66 proofs that there were mistakes on
[29:37] the tapes was a blessing to you and
[29:39] again I believe brother Branham was a
[29:40] genuine prophet of God I preached his
[29:43] Bible revelations since 2004. so I
[29:46] preached 18 years 16 years as a pastor
[29:50] promoting the Bible revelations that God
[29:52] gave to brother Branham and they've
[29:53] literally transformed my life but again
[29:56] our prayer is that this video will help
[29:59] people be delivered from the lie that
[30:02] every word on brother Ram's tapes was
[30:03] thus saith the Lord
[30:05] if you feel out of the Holy Spirit
[30:06] please share this with people so they
[30:08] can be set free from that bondage
[30:11] if you have any questions concerns or
[30:13] testimonies about this video please
[30:15] contact me
[30:18] God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[30:20] the desire of your heart
