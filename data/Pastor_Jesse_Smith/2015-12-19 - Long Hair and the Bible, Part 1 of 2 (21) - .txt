Description:
NEW BOOK - March 2019: "Restoring Christian Modesty"
My book has chapters on jewelry, makeup, hair length, separate garments for men and women, and much more.

This video teaches 5 New Testament texts that prove men and women should have different lengths of hair. Men should have short hair and women should have long and uncut hair based upon 1 Corinthians 11:1-16. Part 2 will teach about Old Testament Scriptures on hair, and also on the history of hair length here in the United States.  One thing is for sure - God never asked a godly Jewish or Christian woman to cut her hair. Ever. There is no Scripture for godly women to cut their hair. God bless you richly as you seek the truth of the Word of God!

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to answer the question why do some Christian women keep their hair very long and uncut this is a fair and honest question that a lot of people probably wonder but might not have the answers to so is our desire to humbly share by the Bible and by history why we believe God is still asking Christian women today to keep their hair long and uncut their entire lives God In His Holy Bible states that there must be a difference between the hair length of men and women the Bible says that in the New Testament it is a shame for a man to have long uncut hair according to 1 Corinthians 11:14 and it is a shame for a woman to have hair cut or shorn even to have a shaved head according to 1 Corinthians 11:6 the hair length of men and women should be opposite short hair for men and long uncut hair for women we will now examine five New Testament texts that support this sound Doctrine new Testament teaching on hair length the only reason we believe God is asking women to have long uncut hair is because the Bible commands women to have long uncut hair in the New Testament and we cannot find a place where God asked any godly woman whether in the New Testament or the Old Testament to cut or trim her hair in any way in the New Testament God never asked a woman to cut her hair in any way ever the main New Testament text for teaching on hair length is 1 Corinthians 11: 1-16 let's go through this text and explain the truth that has been laying in the scripture for nearly 2,000 years verses 1 and two speak of St Paul urging the Corinthians to continue to follow his ordinances because he was taught the gospel by Christ himself Galatians 1: 11- 12 validate this verse three lists the god ordained headship Paul preached man is head over the woman Christ is head over the man and God the Eternal invisible spirit is head over Christ this headship or order of leadership is important because in Verses 4 5 and 6 Paul Begins the instruction on hair so hair length is a god- ordained symbol of Authority or leadership here on Earth amongst humans a man dishonors Christ if he covers his head which means he lets his hair grow long as verse 14 says it is a shame for a man to have long hair a woman dishonors her husband if she prays or prophesies with an uncovered head verse 15 teaches that a woman's long uncut hair is given her for a covering since it is a shame for a woman to be shorn which means to have short hair or shaven which means all hair cut off let her be covered or let her have long uncut hair please know that the covering of a woman is not a cap as can be seen by certain Amish menonite and other religious sects the Bible itself described what the covering of a woman must be it is long uncut hair according to 1 Corinthians 11:15 there is no scripture that says a cap is given her for a covering verse 7-2 explain why women should have long hair because they came out of man in the beginning and were created for the man long hair on a woman is the sign of her husband's authority over her as the husband's authority over the wife is taught all throughout the Bible according to Genesis 3:16 and Ephesians 5: 22- 24 in verses 13-6 Paul asked the Corinthians to judge themselves is it calmly or fit for woman to pray to God uncovered with Shore or shaved head Paul states that nature itself teaches that long hair on a man is a shame modern science says 40% of all men experience baldness so we can again see the infallible truth of the Bible that God allows nature to teach us that long hair on a man is a shame St Paul goes on to teach that if a woman has long hair it is a glory to her because it was given to her for a covering based upon that Bible word covering we want to share a beautiful scripture from the Old Testament that gives us further understanding of what hair as a natural woman's covering represents to God for the spiritual woman or the church or bride or wife of the Lord Jesus Christ Isaiah 30:1 woe to the rebellious children sayeth the Lord that take counsel but not of me and that cover with a covering but not of my spirit that they may add sin to sin the natural human bride has a covering and it is her hair according to 1 Corinthians 11:15 this is a symbol that she is honor the authority of her ruler her husband the spiritual bride or the Church of the Living God has a covering and it is the holy spirit of God according to Isaiah 30:1 the presence of the covering of the anointing of the Holy Ghost proves she is under the authority of her ruler Christ Jesus her husband secondly the natural bride has untrimmed uncut hair according to 1 Corinthians 11: 5 and 6 the spiritual bride the Bride of Jesus Christ she lives by every word that the Holy Spirit wrote taking nothing away from the word of God based upon Matthew 4:4 and Revelation 22: 18 and 19 this church will not trim off parts of the Bible or neglect to preach any truth of God whether Society agrees with it or not thirdly for the natural bride to cut her hair means to deny her husband glory and herself Glory according to 1 Corinthians 11:5 and also verse 15 but if a woman have long hair it is a glory to her for the spiritual bride to reject one word of the Bible is to deny Christ glory in her life but the true church progresses in their walk with God from glory to more Glory according to 2 Corinthians 3:18 as we return to 1 Corinthians chap 11 St Paul ends this portion of the scripture by answering the question he asked in verse 13 is it fit for a woman to pray to God uncovered with short hair or a shaved head the Apostle says despite some being contentious about the this topic of hair length we have no such custom or no practice of women praying to God with short hair neither do the Churches of God the Churches of God in the days of St Paul did not allow women to prophesy or pray to God with short hair nor men to pray to God with long hair we believe that St Paul taught this doctrine of women wearing long uncut hair and men with short hair in every church he visited because of 1 Corinthians 4:1 17 for this cause have I sent unto you timotheus who is my beloved Son and faithful in the Lord who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ as I teach everywhere in every Church there are four more New Testament texts that go along with 1 Corinthians 11 for a total of five to help us see the truth of God's desire for specific hair lengths for men and women John 11: 1 and 2 and John 12: 1-8 these two texts describe Mary the sister of Lazarus who anointed Jesus with ointment now a certain man was sick named Lazareth of Bethany the town of Mary and her sister Martha it was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair whose brother Lazareth was sick John 12:3 then took Mary a pound of ointment of nerd very costly and anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped his feet with her hair and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment this undeniable Bible witness helps prove that women in the days of Jesus did not cut their hair because it would be impossible for a woman with short hair to wash the feet of Jesus Christ short bobbed hair could not wrap around the feet of Jesus and act as a towel to clean and anoint those precious holy feet Mary the sister of Lazarus is a New Testament Bible witness that women must have long uncut hair in order to do the perfect will of the Lord if Mary had short bobbed hair she could not have honored the Lord Jesus Christ in this way before his death Luke 7: 36-50 this text in Luke 7 is very similar to that of John 12:3 as Luke speaks of a woman which was a sinner who went to the house of Simon the Pharisee she must have seen how the Servants of Simon and perhaps Simon himself did not kiss Jesus or wash his feet upon his entrance or anoint his head with oil and being moved by her love for Christ as Savior cease not to kiss his feet and anoint them with oil wash them with their tears of repentance and wipe them with the hairs of her head this act of Love caused Jesus to tell her plainly L that her sins were forgiven in verse 48 observe again that this forgiven woman could not have wiped Jesus feet with short bobbed hair she had to have long uncut hair with years of growth in order to wipe those precious feet of the Lord Jesus Christ Revelation 9:8 this text in Revelation 9 is another true witness from the Bible that emphasizes different hair lengths for men and women and they had hair as the hair of women and their teeth were as a teeth of lions Revelation 98 is part of a striking portion of scripture about the tribulation period detailed in chapter 9: 3-10 under the fifth trumpet during the tribulation God will allow locusts to torment unbelievers and those who have rejected Jesus Christ as Lord and ruler of their lives one of the physical attributes of these locusts is that they have hair as the hair of women we must ask ourselves what is hair that is the hair of women what style of hair do these locusts have if we look at American society today there's hardly any difference between the hair length of men and women most women cut and Bob their hair and it is rare to find a woman who lets her hair grow long and uncut as the Bible teaches women to do so we must not look to society to Define hair length but instead the Bible and God himself must Define hair length if we are going to be sincere Christians if we take an honest look at the Bible and let the Bible provide definitions for itself we will easily understand that hair as the hair of women means long uncut hair for the Bible describes God's requirements for different hair lengths for men and women which is straight from the word of God as we mentioned in 1 Corinthians 11 1-16 so then these Loc have long uncut hair as a torment to the Christ rejecting people who willingly took the mark of the beast we understand that God may be allowing these locusts to torment or haunt the Sinners and bible rejectors who must endure the tribulation because all of them have refused to honor God's commands about salvation the baptism of the Holy Ghost and even hair length they allowed their women to Bob their hair and dishonor their husband and God's word and never taught against men growing their hair out long to look like women they took away truth from the Bible and failed to preach the entire Holy Bible we conclude this section by saying that no New Testament scripture supports Christian women cutting their hair and if you find any Scripture that does please let us know for it will help us to teach God's word in all truth as we are striving to do daily [Music] if
