This video teaches that the 10 Commandments apply to Christians for two reasons. First, the Holy Ghost provides New Testament Scriptures that tell us the moral laws, or 10 commandments, are still in effect. Second, Christians are empowered to fulfill the righteousness of the law by the Holy Ghost and are no longer under the curse of the law.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] greetings friends in the Mattress name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to answer the question do the 10 commandments apply to Christians the answer is yes for two reasons first the Holy Ghost gives new testament scriptures that keep these moral laws in effect for Christians with two or three witnesses second although Christians are not under the curse of the law God calls us to be holy like he is providing us with His Holy Spirit to fulfill the righteousness of the law by his gift of grace the ten commandments the ten commandments of Moses are still in effect in the New Testament although Saturday sabbath-keeping has a different application for Christians here is the list of the Ten Commandments from Exodus 20 verses 1 to 17 with each Commandments corresponding New Testament scripture or scriptures the two or three witnesses to prove these commands are moral law still in effect in the New Testament the first commandment no other gods before me still in effect according to Matthew 4 verse 10 then G is saith unto him get thee hence Satan for it is written thou shalt worship the Lord thy God and him only shalt thou serve the second commandment make no graven images still in effect according to acts 17 29 and revelation 9 24 as much then as we are the offspring of God we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold or silver or stone graven by art and man's device and the times of this ignorance God winked at but now commandeth all men everywhere to repent and the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands that they should not worship devils and idols of gold and silver and brass and stone and wood which neither can see nor hear nor walk the third commandment do not take the name of the Lord in vain still in effect according to Matthew 6 verse 9 after this manner therefore pray ye our Father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name the fourth commandment keep the Sabbath day holy this has a new application the New Testament Sabbath is the believer resting or ceasing from his sinful works and then doing the works of the Holy Ghost this spiritual rest begins when a person is born again of the Holy Ghost this is proven by isaiah 28 verses 11 and 12 and first corinthians 14 verses 21 and 22 notice in isaiah chapter 28 isaiah plainly said this is the rest the new rest is connected to God using stammering lips to speak to his people which is fulfilled in Acts chapter 2 for they spoke with tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance in first Corinthians 14 21 Paul later quotes Isaiah 28 verses 11 and 12 and connects it to the tongues that were given to the Jews and all the other nations in Acts chapter 2 God's purpose of Saturday Sabbath keeping in the Old Testament points to something greater to come Jesus teaches that the true rest is the born-again experience he proclaims in John 3:7 and John 7 verses 37 to 39 in reference to believers receiving the Holy Ghost Jesus says you must be born again and if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink he that believeth on me as the scripture hath said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water in the born-again experience a Christian rest or walks according to the spirit and does not fulfill the lusts of the flesh for the remainder of his earthly walk the spear folk Christian will rest or cease from doing lustful sinful habits and will do the works that please God now that's a true rest I would much rather rest for my sinful works every day of my life than just relaxing on each Saturday but continuing sinful works thankfully if we receive the true baptism of the Holy Ghost and rest from our sinful lives we will actually have a physical day of rest built into our week which is Sunday how great is the wisdom of our God just as the early Christians met on the first day of the week according to Acts chapter 20 verse 7 so we meet every Sunday to honor the resurrection of Jesus Christ true Christians will not forsake the assembling of the Saints on the first day of the week because sincere weekly meetings provide spiritual meat edification comfort consolation and more the New Testament Sabbath is the believer resting or ceasing from his sinful works and then doing the works of the Holy Ghost Hebrews chapter 4 verses 1 to 12 also support this teaching specifically verse 9 there remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God for he that has entered into his rest he also hath ceased from his own works as God did from his let us labor therefore to enter into that rest lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief Matthew 11:28 come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls the fifth commandment honor thy mother and father still in effect according to Ephesians chapter 6 verses 1 to 3 children obey your parents in the Lord for this is right honor thy father and mother which is the first commandment with promise that it may be well with thee and thou mayest live long on the earth the sixth commandment thou shall not kill still in effect according to Galatians 5:21 envyings murders drunkenness revellings and such like of the which i tell you before as i have also told you in time past that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of god the seventh commandment thou shalt not commit adultery still in a fact according to 1st Corinthians chapter 6 verses 9 and 10 know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate nor abusers of themselves with mankind nor thieves nor covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God the eighth commandment thou shalt not steal still in effect a corner 1st Corinthians 6 verse 10 nor thieves nor covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God the ninth commandment thou shalt not bear false witness still in effect according to Ephesians 4 verse 25 wherefore putting away lying speak every man truth with this neighbor for we are members one of another the tenth commandment thou shalt not covet still in effect according to 1st Corinthians 6 verse 10 nor thieves nor covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God Christians are not under the curse of the law Paul's writings from Romans and Galatians teach that we are not under the law meaning we are not saved by our individual works or by our own righteousness according to Romans 4 verses 1 to 16 Romans 6 verses 14 and 15 Galatians 2 verse 21 and Galatians 3 verse 23 and Galatians 5 verse 4 the law has the power to curse anyone who does not keep every single Old Testament commandment in contrast New Testament believers are saved by grace through faith in Jesus Christ for Christ bore the curse of God for our sins on the cross of Calvary while we are not under the curse of the law God still desires that his children Christians be holy because he is holy Peter says God wants to fashion or pattern his children after his holiness and not patterned after lusts 1st Peter 1 verses 14 through 16 as obedient children not fashioning yourselves according to the former lusts in your ignorance but as he which hath called you is holy so be ye holy in all manner of conversation because it is written be holy for I am holy so you see friend a study into New Testament teaching will help you understand that we are to fulfill the righteousness of the law according to Romans 8 verse 4 that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit the Old Testament law is righteous and God desires that New Testament believers walk in obedience to the Holy Ghost which automatically fulfills the righteousness of the law Christians should willingly choose to obey God's Word obeying the will of the Holy Spirit Paul caused this the law the law that we are currently under the law of the Spirit in Romans 8 verses 1 and 2 there's therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death this law of the spear is the same law that Jesus Christ walked in according to Luke 4 verse 14 and Jesus returned in the power of the spirit into Galilee and there went out a fame of him through all the region round about this Holy Ghost law or leading will never lead us into sin but rather into complete obedience to the Word of God Jesus walked in the law of the Spirit his entire life because the spear abode upon him the spirit led Christ into full obedience to the Word of God and so the Spirit will lead our lives the exact same way in closing if you have any questions about how the Ten Commandments still apply to Christians or if you like more information about how to rightly divide the word of God or the Old Testament for the New Testament Christian please contact me god bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
