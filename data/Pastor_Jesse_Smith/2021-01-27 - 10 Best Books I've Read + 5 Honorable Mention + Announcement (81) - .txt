NOTE: Around the 18:10 mark, I made a mistake. I meant to say Jesus lived a a "sinless" life, not a sinful life. I'm sorry for my error. I know Jesus lived a sinless life.  I believe every word of Jesus Christ, every Word in His Bible, and I just made a mistake.
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] greetings friends in the mattress name of the lord jesus christ here's the 10 best books i've read and why they've been so helpful to me there'll be an honorable mention list after the top 10 and there will be one announcement about my youtube channel at the end of the video as an obvious disclaimer i don't agree with everything in all these books and concerning the bible the church age book and the seven seals book i can't put into words the value of these texts number one the king james version of the holy bible 1611. god's bible is the inerrant infallible unchanging truth forever settled in heaven and for everlasting as heaven and earth shall pass away but god's word will never pass away jesus said my words are spirit and they are life in john 6 63 as i daily read the bible the spiritual revelations jump off the pages just as god's mercies are new every morning he also gives daily revelations called daily bread every morning i preached christ for 16 years and still have only scratched the surface of his unsearchable riches his book is eternal just like him like proverbs 2 verse 4 says the deeper we dig in scripture the more treasures we find some recent treasures have been the five wise virgins from jesus's matthew 25 parable being typed by the five daughters of zelophed in numbers 26 preached by my brother cam who is also a pastor other recent treasures are the dangers of partial fear of the lord in second kings 17 god's promise to prosper us as long as we seek god as taught in second chronicles 26 verse 5 and jesus's prophecy about the coronavirus in matthew 24 verse 7. for those curious why i use the king james version only i'm not a bible translation scholar but these things i know for sure first the king james version is god's response when he honored the supernatural prayer of william tyndale while being burned at the stake and he requested god to open the eyes of the king of england in regards to an english translation of the holy scriptures a year later the bible was translated into english authorized by king henry viii henry granted permission and license to john rogers to print the english bible the king later printed twenty thousand english bibles composed of ninety seven percent of tyndale's work called the great bible and sent a copy to every church in england the most accurate bible ever translated the king james version of 1611 contains 90 of tyndale's translation work second the king james version is an accurate word for word translation since every word of god is pure tried in the fire seven times other versions are thought for thought which are dangerous and should be avoided third most versions delete words from the king james version in my experience i've seen the niv delete many of the king james words and other versions do the same now according to scripture these versions are cursed because you cannot add or take away one word of god plagues will be added to those who add to the word of god and names will be taken off the book of life for those who take words out of the bible of the few bible versions i've studied like niv esv isv and asb i've seen them delete important words from the king james version and make the text confusing such as calling lucifer the day star in the esv a title given to christ the niv deletes first john 5 7 which is important for the understanding of the one person godhead and also deletes the end of mark 16 about jesus's commission to cast out devils heal the sick and so forth so i choose to leave all other versions alone outside of the king james version because they confuse doctrine and delete holy words of god fourth the king james version gives the best understanding some complain about thee and thou but they actually provide greater meaning and help you understand the bible if you research it fifth god vindicates the power of the king james version being his true word charles spurgeon jonathan edwards george whitfield and other revivalists especially our prophet william branham used the king james version my mother was healed of cancer in 1988 by quoting the king james version of psalms 118 verse 119. i've quoted the king james version and cast out devils seen the sick healed and more sixth teaching and believing the king james version promotes the incorruptible seed of god the word of god and plants those seeds into people's hearts this is what america was built upon when the united states was founded and preachers were using the king james version bible our nation had no laws that permitted abortion and homosexuality their laws came directly from moses and it produced the greatest civilization the world has ever seen because it was a civilization founded on judeo-christian principles now that this nation has rejected the word of god and interjected all these false versions we see the wicked effects that the corruptable seeds of satan have produced seventh and lastly the king james version has no copyright it's free in public domain obviously many new bible versions are motivated by money making which is another reason to stay away from them the second best book i've ever read is an exposition of the seven church ages by william branham 1965. originally preached in 1960 this exposition was edited and published becoming a treasure trove of doctrinal truce in my humble opinion it's the second greatest book on earth outside the holy bible this book is the very doctrinal foundation of my life and pastoral ministry and i greatly thank the lord for it i give brother branham double honor for his efforts to labor in the word and doctrine as 1st timothy 5 17 says a few highlights of this life-changing book are the teachings on the supreme deity of jesus christ that he's the one person of the godhead the keystone of the bible three qualifications every minister should aspire to the book of life the serpent seed the baptism of the holy ghost jesus's compliment of the last works of the saints being more than the first and the thus saith the lord promise of the former and latter reigns for our day in joel 2 verses 23-26 referring to the church ages book brother branham thought so highly of it he believed any sincere heart searching for truth would see it within its pages he said but wait till you get the book you'll understand it if you just got any light in you about your name taken off the lamb's book of life it's puzzled out a minister so wait you get the book you'll understand it if book number three the revelation of the seven seals by william branham originally preached in march of 1963 this book is a direct transcription of his sermons with no grammar edits so it can be a bit of a challenge to read at first i advise you to read it while also listening to the audio at the same time it's a faith building powerhouse of truth validated with thus saith the lord to ensure readers the revelations contained therein were directly from god this sermon series from branham is another doctrinal treasure trove especially related to the seven seals and god again validated he was the one who sent the revelations by having branham speak them with thus saith the lord additionally many symbols for the book of revelation are revealed as we now understand god's power through the four beasts at the throne of god four holy ghost powers given to the church to battle in their earthly battle against satan's four horse riders during the time of the seven church ages or times of the gentiles as jesus calls it in luke 21 24. brother branham said his week of studying for these sermons was greater than any previous ministry he had ever done including divine healing of all the times that i've been behind the pulpit at the tabernacle i have never never in any time of my ministry ever worked into the realms of god in the spiritual realms has been this time beyond anything i ever did in any time in my ministry in any meeting and anywhere like this or its own healing this is revealing of truth by the same spirit same spirit indeed through the revelations preached in the seven seals the bible became a new bible the bible now makes sense it has continuity and is living and active right now we can clearly see our position as wise virgins as the bride of jesus christ making ourselves ready to meet our heavenly bridegroom in the air at the rapture in the feast of trumpets 1964 brother branham said immediately after that the angels of the lord appeared and told about the seven uh trumpets or the seven seals and i was to return back here to jeffersonville and preach the seven seals and there if i've ever said anything that was inspired it was in that there or the angel lord medicine up the bible become a new bible there it opened up and revealed all the things that the reformers and things that left out it was a complete revelation of jesus christ all together new to us but perfectly exactly with the scripture that was the word which has always been i was so inspired and directed book number four today matters by john maxwell 2005 a former minister john maxwell's book came to me at a time when i desperately needed it i was a young husband father and preacher my good friend john graham shared this book with me and it's done wonders for my perspective and daily habits humans become what we do every day our daily choices will either compound into blessings or curses maxwell says life has 12 areas we must daily strengthen and improve they include attitude priorities health family thinking commitments finances faith relationships generosity values and growth maxwell gives examples from his own life and others who daily invested in these areas of their lives and saw massive compound effects for example maxwell describes the compound effects of his faith in christ from his 20s 30s 40s 50s and 60s the same applies to our health as taking care of our body daily for decades often yields great blessings one of the most impactful statements from this book is maxwell showing what the descendants of one preacher and his wife accomplished that preacher was jonathan edwards and his wife named sarah this example shows the blessing of daily investing in your family one thousand four hundred descendants of jonathan and sarah were studied and they included 13 college presidents 65 professors 100 lawyers 30 judges 66 doctors and over 80 holders of public office of course the greatest achievement our descendants can achieve is being a holy ghost-filled christian but we can gain a lot of wisdom from maxwell's words when he says while you can't do much about your ancestors you can influence your descendants greatly yes today matters jesus said to seek first the kingdom of god and everything else would be added to you and god promised his blessing would be upon a thousand generations according to deuteronomy 7 verse 9 psalms 112 verses 1 and 2 says blessed is the man who feareth the lord that delighteth greatly in his commandments his seed shall be mighty upon the earth the generation of the upright shall be blessed book number five his needs her needs building an affair-proof marriage by dr willard harley 1986 this is undoubtedly the most impactful book upon my marriage i've ever read i believe most if not all marriages would benefit from the truths in this book harley lists five needs for both men and women and if those needs are met the marriage thrives one powerful quote i'll paraphrase is this your spouse married you because they wanted your loving treatment you express to them during the courtship and engagement period to last the rest of their lives in other words married couples must keep that first love alive other pastors have asked me to preach marriage banquets to their congregations on about six occasions and harley's principles are always in my teachings because they're backed up by the holy truths of the bible as well as quotations from brother branham i've often used these principles in marriage counseling as well book number six be fruitful and multiply by nancy campbell 2003 first i'll say anyone stumbling over me reading a book by a woman and trying to glean truce out of it is likely unaware that brother branham god's prophet used a woman's book called how did it happen by rachel c haseltine to obtain a lot of the church history he used when he preached the seven church age series in december 1960 this be fruitful multiply book provides complete bible validation for having large families based upon god's commission to be fruitful and multiply these bible truths are why my wife and i have eight children because we believe god's word is true our family has been laughed at made fun of scoffed at but that is just one reproach for being a true christian let me add a word of wisdom that a wife's health should be the number one factor when deciding to expand upon your family one of the many highlights from this book include that god sent his own son jesus into a family that would have had at least seven children according to mark six verse three jesus the firstborn james joseph judah simon and sisters that's at least two sisters the point is if god was able to take care of jesus his only begotten son virgin born in a family of at least nine in a time when they were not rich and increased with goods and weren't living in the laodicean benefits we have today god can just as easily take care of any size family all that's required is faith in god's promises furthermore i must address one of satan's lies he uses to get christians to say the following i won't have children because i don't want them to live in this wicked world satan's lie is that your potential children cannot overcome the sinful world this statement is motivated by fear and not faith what are you scared of satan christians cast down the spirit of fear and are empowered by the spirit of power love and a sound mind christians living in fear are certainly not born again for the fearful will not inherit the kingdom of god and those that worship the spirit of fear will burn in the lake of fire according to revelation 21 verse 8. this excuse diminishes god and exalts satan in their evil reasoning they are saying satan is more powerful than god they are also saying god is not able to protect their children nor help them but our bible says christians are more than conquerors through christ jesus greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world no weapon formed against christians shall prosper why couldn't your potential children overcome this wicked world is it because you cannot overcome it john says only one thing is required to overcome this world faith and it's a freely given gift of god according to ephesians 2 verses 8 through 10. first john 5 verses 4 and 5 say for whatsoever is born of god overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith who is he that overcometh the world but he that believeth that jesus is the son of god the reality is that parents should be so strong in the faith that their godly child training should prepare their child or children to overcome the world as proverbs 22 verse 6 teaches us to train up a child in the way he should go the truth is this age is selfish and lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god most couples don't want to be burdened with caring for children they'd rather do their own thing and if they are using birth control pills then they are likely murderers as well because the pill often stops a fertilized egg a new life from attaching to the uterine wall if over 50 million babies have been aborted in clinics how many have been aborted by the birth control pill book number seven the feasts of israel by kevin j connor 1995. as a young minister this book was gifted to me and has been a great teacher about the natural and prophetic principles of the feasts and holy days of israel which include passover unleavened bread first fruits weeks trumpets atonement and tabernacles a couple of highlights are number one leaven is a type of sin throughout the entire bible this truth helps us to understand jesus's sinful life as he was the unleavened bread and it shows the dangers of false doctrine in past and current churches like the leaven of the pharisees and sadducees and this teaching helps us interpret jesus's parable of 11 hidden three measures of meal in matthew 13 33. the man-made false teaching of the three-person god the false trinity dogma was the leaven hid in the early church's doctrine which has completely permeated into their entire belief system polluting both catholic and protestant belief systems a second highlight is understanding god's prophetic calendar passover unleavened bread and first fruits were all prophetically fulfilled when jesus was crucified and raised from the dead two thousand years ago we are now prophetically living in the feast of weeks the long season of wheat harvest before god returns to the jews through the holy day of trumpets it's likely the two prophets moses and elijah will fulfill the trumpets and jesus revealing himself to the 144 thousand jewish remnant will fulfill the holy day of atonement the feast of tabernacles is fulfilled in the 1000 year millennial reign book number eight message companion by marcus becker 2013. gifted to me in 2013 this book was a quick read for me because i couldn't put it down i read it in two days this is an essential read for anyone interested in the supernatural ministry of god's prophet william branham becker's work is a great source for important quotes from brother branham in order to see the changing of his ministry from 1959 to 1965. it includes pictures news articles and other publications that are chronologically ordered with brother branham's sermons helping the reader understand the significance of both world events and events in brother branham's life for me a few highlights we're seeing the progression of brother branham obeying the holy spirit in his commission as it changed in the first second and third polls also seeing the timing of his commission to store up food or tape recordings was very helpful lastly you see the beautiful revelation of god showing brother branham his ministry as god's eliezer commissioned to get a bride for isaac or jesus christ book number nine family shepherds by votey bockham jr 2011. votey's book calls and equips men to lead their homes so i encourage fathers to read this book this book came to me as a young father and strengthened my biblical foundation on the how and why of being a godly father of course i known brother bam's message for about 10 years and that gave me a great foundation to be a godly man but this book puts vast amounts of biblical truth in one location votey is baptist by denomination so i don't agree with everything in the book but the biblical teaching for men far outweighs my disagreements with his denomination one of the greatest scriptures that impacted me in the book was first samuel 3 13 which shows eli's failure to restrain his two sons and the punishment god put upon eli for this act this truth showed me a true loving father must restrain his child or children when they repeatedly disobey god's word additionally this book shows the husband's role in teaching his children using apologetics leading and loving his wife and the absolute necessity of having your family in a home church serving christ with other believers and their families book number 10 free to focus by michael hyatt 2019 a disclaimer this is the only book on the list that i didn't read as i listened to the audiobook i've benefited from michael hyatt's productivity teachings for about three years since i used his free book writing course to help me write my first book restoring christian modesty free to focus has helped me as i'm writing my second book about the new testament's 12 reveal mysteries this is because free to focus has helped me prioritize my life it teaches three steps to completely focus on my calling in life stop cut and act this book gets down into the details of what a daily schedule looks like when it's completely focused on a goal i'd say today matters is a broad yet essential perspective on becoming focused and productive while free to focus helps you daily live focused and stay productive hyatt truly teaches how you and i can accomplish more by doing less the secret is accomplishing more of what truly matters by saying no to things that are not as important honorable mention here's five books that have greatly affected me the first is the five love languages by gary chapman this book was given to me when i first became a christian before i knew the message of william branham and he showed me that people receive love in different ways so if i'm going to love people with christ's love i must learn how to express love to them in a way that they can receive it second is dress for the occasion now this is a young adult book but it was introduced to me in college and it contained so much history about dressing modestly that it helped inspire me to write my first book restoring christian modesty if you want to see how americans once had the truth about modesty but then fell from it decade by decade this is the book to get the third book is which version is the bible a disclaimer here i have not read this whole book but the parts that i have read have convinced me that the king james version is the most accurate and trustworthy bible translation known to mankind a fourth book is shaping history by prayer and fasting by derek prince this book shows how god has always led men to pray and fast for the future of their nations especially israel the author includes testimonies from his own prayer and fasting ministries around the time of world war ii it encourages christians today to pray and fast for our nations that we could continue the great commission and lead quiet and peaceable lives as saint paul teaches the fifth honorable mention book is the purpose-driven life by rick warren of course i don't agree with rick warren in the areas of the pope and of the trinity but this book shows beautiful scriptures about god's purpose for every believer's life again i read this book very quickly and it culminates by showing every christian should have a home church find their gifts invest in them that they might fulfill god's purpose for their life your purpose is found in god not in yourself finally here's an announcement due to the recent censorship of conservative free speech during the 2020 presidential election in the united states by facebook google twitter youtube and amazon one goal i have for 2021 is to move away from the youtube platform and eventually build my own or use another service such as rumble i haven't made a final decision yet but i'll let my audience know later this year lord willing i've already deleted my twitter instagram and facebook accounts and i've even stopped purchasing things from amazon my goal is to have my own platform on my new web page www.pastorjessiesmith.com the site is live and slowly growing so please be aware of my desire to eventually leave youtube if you'd like to receive more bible teaching that strengthens you your church your family and your pastor just like brother branham loved brother neville's weekly radio ministry that reached an untold number of families outside of his home church i would hope brother branham would love my youtube ministry as it seeks to point people to jesus's bible-based message equipping and strengthening the saints it is one of the best fields in the nation and how many heard the broadcast yesterday i'm an old veteran creature over 20 years old and i heard lots of sermons but i believe i heard one of the most uh appropriate sermon for the day that we're living i heard is yesterday our pastor for the devil you missed that mr great treasure that was dearly in my heart to remark to each other how that the lord was using our brother and yesterday's message on the radio and it was a marvelous masterpiece if i ever heard one now i was so happy to know that uh the one who the lord was using to bring the message i was associated with in the work of the lord and so and the court's head of the trio yesterday was just and we appreciate this with all of our hearts and pray that god will continue to be with our brother and grant these great powerful messages both in song and in the word as the time goes on if you have any questions or concerns about this video or testimonies please contact me god bless you and may jesus christ be the desire of your heart
