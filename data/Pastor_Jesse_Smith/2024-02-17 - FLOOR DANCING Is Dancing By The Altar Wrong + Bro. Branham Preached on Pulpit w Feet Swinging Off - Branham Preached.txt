TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] what makes the difference the sensation that's reason I don't believe in dancing on the floor greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to answer a question from a brother from Africa he asked me is it sinful to Floor dance and he defined floor dancing as dancing at the alter first I want to say I appreciate all questions you know brother brandham did questions and answer Services of course and every Sunday night when I'm preaching at my home church I take questions and answers and also teach a lesson as well so we never want to be afraid of questions it's okay if we don't have all the answers but we know the Holy Ghost will guide us into all Truth by the grace of God if I'm not mistaken this brother or a brother in his same country recently asked about Flatt tops so I made a video about that as well and friends my name is Pastor Jesse Smith I've been pastoring here in akan Ohio at bride of Christ Fellowship for 17 years and I defend the Bible revelations that Jesus Christ revealed to his Prophet brother William brandham 1909 to 1965 I also defend brother bram's Godly Christian character so let's start with the question here's the question from an email we don't allow the people to dance at the altar everyone must stand at their sitting position without coming forward to dance when you come near the altar we call it floor dancing here's the quote from the prophet so let's listen to the quote from the prophet brother random says the following in God's only provided place of worship November 2865 let's listen to the quote all the same what makes the difference the sensation that's the reason I don't believe in dancing on the floor no man so my initial answer is no there's nothing wrong with dancing by the altar I could not find any Bible scriptures that would forbid this and of course I could not find any quotes from God's Prophet brother brandham either that would forbid dancing near The Altar and on a personal note every time I dance before the Lord or nearly every time it's right by the alar cuz I'm usually preaching by God's grace but I want to make a few points here as well the first point is that I think this group of churches has misunderstood the quote from God's only provided place of worship and this is what I emailed the brother a few days ago if you look at the context of the quote you'll see brother Bram is talking about a man hugging up a woman while they're dancing so in brother bram's terminology in this case floor dancing was men and women dancing together hugging each other up and the man brother R said would get sensation when he hugged up a woman let's listen to the quote I looked around then all the hard nights the trials passed away and I could see their faces and a young woman run up there one of the most beautiful women and she just threw her arms around me and said precious brother and when she passed by now she was woman so but in there there'll never be sin our glands are changed there we won't raise children no more there see all the same what makes the difference the sensation that's the reason I don't believe in dancing on the floor no man uh before God in my Bible I've lived clean as that way through my life when I was a little boy all through my Young Manhood any girl I ever went out with I can walk right back to the Judgment with her see but there's no man I don't care who you are can let a woman in the make of a woman hug herself up close to you if you're a true healthy man it's a sensation but it wasn't there there's no glands you're all the same glands just pure unadulterated sisterly and brotherly love more than it would be for your even for you hug your own little daughter see your own daughter said she's male she's female and you're male see it could create something but there it can't sin is done it's all over real just real holy love so that's the first point I want to make I believe the churches here have misunderstood the quote and I'm not condemning them I'm just saying that's the first observation I see about this brother brandom is not condemning dancing by the altar a second point I want to make is that every church is Sovereign of itself brother Ram said that many times I'm not going to play the quotes here on this video but you can look at up and so perhaps you know this Sovereign Church wants to make that requirement that nobody Dance by the altar will they have the freedom to do that by God's grace as long as people can dance and praise the Lord and Psalm 149 and Psalm 150 the Bible says pray praise His name in The Dance Let Them praise the name of Jesus in the dance perhaps they've had selfish prideful people trying to get attention by dancing in front of the whole church I don't know maybe they just have a large church with limited space I don't know so we got to let them have their freedom as a sovereign church so as long as they allow them to dance that's okay by God's grace as far as I'm concerned and somebody can correct me if I'm wrong by God's grace with a quote and also a Bible scripture the third point I want to make is that David danced right in the presence of God the Prince of God of course was dwelling in the Ark of the Covenant at that time so we know that's scriptural David danced right in the presence of God and another examples from Proverbs 8 the logos was playing in the presence of God brother Ram also says this in 1953 the pillar of fire brother ramam says the logos was playing Yonder like a little child before the doorstep of the father so there the logos is dancing right in the presence of the invisible father let's listen to the quote but then the Loos that went out of him become like a little Halo of light let's see it playing Yonder like a child before the doorstep of the father and now I can see him as he moves over here and he draws into his his memory or his mind a picture of what the world should be now there's not a star or nothing another point I'd like to make is that brother random got so filled with the spirit so lost in the spirit that one time and perhaps perhaps others I don't know but at least one time he was so lost in the spirit he was sitting up on the pulpit with his feet swinging off preaching as hard as he could go and he said I'd like to stay there a while and he said he lived off that for several days afterwards getting so lost in the spirit remember the pulpit is a sacred desk right it's a sacred place so here brother Brandon was preaching as hard as he can sitting on top of the pulpit and he said he wished he could have stayed there a while so here we see the freedom of the Holy Ghost here we see the the power of the Holy Ghost and of course Church sovereignty as well by God's grace let's listen to the quote it's from Redemption and completeness in Joy 1954 here some time ago I was preaching in a little church and and I was just oh I haven't got very many fullfit manners according to the I guess the Theology of the day so I guess I got a little unruly and I think I jumped up on the plat on the pull pit like that and grabbed the microphone my hand and sat there my feet swinging off preaching it's hard as they could I come to myself I didn't know what I was doing and few minutes I got lost again I found myself down the middle of the aisle rolling up my trous away I don't know why but I was really I'd like to stay there a while one thing I'd like to say it was somewhere that I sure was enjoying myself I just lived off of it for several days afterwards it's by God's grace I think I'll play one more quote brother R said the first time he danced in the spirit was at a New Year's Eve service at his church there inff Ville and after condemning the dancing he thought about it for a while the Holy Spirit directed him to the word and then he said it wasn't very long after he started patting his feet that he was out there with that girl dancing I got the victory he said so we don't know where brother brandham was dancing I've been to the brandom Tabernacle a few times I'm not quite sure if it was in the aisle or right up there in front by the altar but I just thought I'd play this quote to show how brother random so freely danc in the spirit perhaps in front of the altar perhaps in the eye I can't tell from this quote but I just want everyone to see the freedom of the Holy Ghost brother brandom preaching while sitting on top of the pulpit and then brother brandom out there dancing right around females of course not dancing with them necessarily but dancing in the Holy Ghost enjoying the freedom of the Holy Ghost let's listen to the quote hey I got feel pretty good got Pat my foot with that girl W well you know I thought well maybe that's just my method is put anyhow so I started patting a you you know wasn't very long I thought there with that girl D I got the [Music] victory in closing friends I hope this video was a blessing Again by the grace of God I love these questions I love that Christians want to please the Holy Ghost and we have such a wonderful promise in John 16:14 the Holy Ghost will guide us into all truth brother Ram told us many times prove all things test me by the word and so this question like many other questions we just take it back to the word and we also want to balance it with the quotes from brother brandom because they align with the word of God and we can plainly see that every church is Sovereign of itself God loves dancing in the spirit there's freedom in the Holy Ghost and we can dance right in the presence of Jesus Christ Our Lord if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
