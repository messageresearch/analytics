[0:02] and he married a
[0:05] gentile woman that produced Ephraim and
[0:08] Manasses which was J A into the kingdom
[0:12] into the Patriotic promise and God's
[0:15] spirit will never leave that word it'll
[0:17] stay right with the word blinding some
[0:19] and Open the Eyes of others it'll always
[0:21] do
[0:22] that greetings friends in the matchless
[0:25] name of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[0:27] purpose of this video is to show four
[0:29] more truths
[0:30] about the validity of interracial
[0:32] marriage according to the Bible this
[0:34] video then is a followup to a video I
[0:36] put out on February 22nd about
[0:38] interracial marriage and how God's
[0:40] Prophet the true Prophet brother William
[0:42] Mar and brandham said Moses's marriage
[0:44] to Zapora was perfect because it was
[0:47] God's choice so God chose for Moses to
[0:50] marry outside of his race outside of his
[0:54] nationality Moses married an Ethiopian
[0:56] woman Zapora and that was perfect in the
[0:59] plan of God so these next three or four
[1:02] points were Quicken to me this morning
[1:05] as I was working on my latest podcast
[1:07] also that defends the message and so let
[1:09] me briefly go through these four points
[1:11] here by God's grace first the thought
[1:14] came to me that all of brother Ram's
[1:16] quotes about the six interracial couples
[1:21] from the Bible are all positive brother
[1:23] RAM does not say one negative thing
[1:25] about these six couples that were
[1:27] married in we' say in interracial
[1:30] marriages let's go through those couples
[1:32] the first one of course Moses and Zapora
[1:35] second Uriah and basheba third Ruth and
[1:38] Boaz fourth Rahab and Solon fifth Joseph
[1:42] and azth and a new one at least for me
[1:46] was Esther and King Xerxes the Persian
[1:50] king so later in the video we'll get to
[1:52] quotes on those but let's look at the
[1:54] second point now the second point is
[1:57] that these interracial marriages are not
[1:59] worldly someone made a comment on my
[2:01] February 22nd video that said
[2:03] interracial marriages are worldly and
[2:06] I'm pretty sure I know the famous
[2:07] preacher where this person got that
[2:09] statement from so the second point is
[2:12] that interracial marriages are not
[2:13] worldly because if you say that you're
[2:16] actually calling God worldly and God is
[2:17] Not worldly God is Holy the critics of
[2:21] interracial marriage cannot call God
[2:23] both worldly and holy God is Holy and
[2:26] again if you take the quotes from God's
[2:28] Prophet brother brandham the interracial
[2:29] marriage of Moses and Zapora was perfect
[2:33] and God's
[2:34] choice the third point is that other
[2:36] critics from that February 22nd video
[2:39] called the children of interracial
[2:42] marriage couples hybrids and so this
[2:45] morning I found a quote where brother
[2:46] brandom said Joseph and azen's children
[2:49] were heirs to the kingdom so this quote
[2:52] demolishes this weak argument that the
[2:55] children of interracial marriage couples
[2:57] are hybrids they're not hybrids if
[3:00] they're Believers they're heirs to the
[3:02] kingdom of God and of course we'll prove
[3:04] that by the scriptures and the quotes in
[3:06] a moment here and the fourth point is
[3:09] that a Critic said the interracial
[3:11] marriage examples from the Bible that
[3:13] I've listed are the only ones that God
[3:16] allowed because they are types of Christ
[3:18] and the church and of course that is
[3:21] ridiculous all marriages are a type of
[3:24] Christ in the church according to
[3:26] Ephesians chap 5 and then Ephesians 3
[3:29] says one of the mysteries of God is to
[3:30] show that the Jew and Gentile Believers
[3:33] in Christ are of the same body so the
[3:36] person just needs to read Ephesians 3
[3:39] 1-9 if they really want the truth by the
[3:41] grace of God so I hope it's plain for
[3:43] our viewers to see that these four
[3:46] points further prove that God is for
[3:48] interracial marriage when he ordains it
[3:51] interracial marriages are few and far
[3:53] between and we're thankful for the
[3:55] continual revelation of the Holy Spirit
[3:58] from the Bible brother Ram said the holy
[4:01] spirit will only point you to the Bible
[4:03] the holy spirit will not point you away
[4:04] from the Bible because the Holy Spirit
[4:06] wrote the Bible see it's still in the
[4:09] word you see you can't get out of that
[4:10] word it won't leave the word and God's
[4:13] spirit will never leave that word it'll
[4:15] stay right with the word blinding some
[4:17] and Open the Eyes of others it'll always
[4:19] do that the holy spirit is a
[4:24] compass the North Star is the word and
[4:27] the compass will only point to the north
[4:29] star and the Holy Ghost will only point
[4:32] you to the word not some ecumenical move
[4:35] not some denomination but to the word of
[4:38] God Amen you remember all the other
[4:41] stars shift with the world but the North
[4:43] Star stays exactly because it's in a
[4:45] center and every other man's word will
[4:48] fail but God's word Can't Fail it's a
[4:50] NSTAR Center it won't shift with the
[4:53] world no matter where the world is it
[4:55] Remains the same yesterday today and
[4:57] forever and he is the world
[5:00] now the compass is the Holy Spirit and
[5:04] the your your tie poost would be the
[5:07] North Star so the holy spirit will
[5:09] always Point towards the word hallelujah
[5:12] the holy spirit will never lead you to
[5:14] anything else but the word of God that's
[5:17] so how could a man accept the
[5:20] Creed when it's contrary to the word and
[5:23] then still say he has the Holy Ghost the
[5:26] Holy Ghost has point you away from that
[5:29] it takes the Holy Spirit to point you to
[5:33] the word for he is the word he is the
[5:37] word and it can only as the um as the
[5:40] magnet in the compass is only set
[5:43] towards the North Pole that's the only
[5:46] way it can draw and when the Holy Spirit
[5:49] is the author and writer and the
[5:52] quickener of the word how can it point
[5:54] the person to anything else but the word
[5:58] so now let's go through these quotes on
[5:59] the these six interracial marriage
[6:01] Couples from the Bible by God's grace
[6:02] first we'll start with Moses and Zapora
[6:04] of course these two quotes are repeat
[6:06] from the February 22nd video brother ram
[6:09] calls it perfect and then brother ram
[6:11] calls it God's choice let's listen to
[6:14] the quotes and Mariam showed her try too
[6:18] when she laughed because Moses married
[6:20] this Negro girl and said wasn't there
[6:22] other girls to be married and so forth
[6:24] he could done it and God wasn't pleased
[6:26] with that and smot her with leprosy and
[6:29] her own brother screamed out and said
[6:31] would you let your sister die in that
[6:33] shape and God told Moses to come before
[6:36] him and he went and interceded for for
[6:38] marrying she didn't live long after that
[6:41] no brother what God does is
[6:46] perfect we ain't got no business with
[6:48] our minds putting anything to it just
[6:51] leave it the way it is God did it God
[6:54] said it that settles it just take it I
[6:57] don't know how if I could explain it
[6:59] that I be equal with God I can't explain
[7:02] it I just believe it oh that's all I'm
[7:06] asked to
[7:07] do and there one day we find out that
[7:11] even Mariam a
[7:13] propheus and Aaron the high priest made
[7:17] fun of moses'
[7:19] wife because she was an Ethiopian and
[7:23] thought was there enough women of our
[7:25] own group to marry instead of going down
[7:27] there and marrying that woman that
[7:29] wasn't moses' choice that was God's
[7:31] choice for Moses
[7:33] amen and when they made fun of it that
[7:37] angered God in such a
[7:39] way until he struck Miriam the prophetes
[7:42] full of leprosy moses' own sister what
[7:46] about that her a
[7:50] prophetess but what was she doing she
[7:53] was making fun in an ear reverence to
[7:56] God's messenger amen the messenger of
[7:59] the Covenant of that day and she was
[8:02] irreverent and also Aaron the high
[8:05] priest the very mouthiest of Moses yeah
[8:10] right next let's look at Uriah and basba
[8:13] I'll just look at these quotes that
[8:14] brother R mentioned Uriah brother R
[8:17] called Uriah a gallant soldier in one
[8:19] quote in another quote he said he wanted
[8:22] to go up and tell Uriah in heaven that
[8:24] his testimony meant something to brother
[8:27] brandham notice brother Bram never criti
[8:29] izes Uriah for his interracial marriage
[8:31] Uriah was a hittite bash of course was a
[8:34] Jew they were not supposed to marry
[8:37] under the conditions when the hittite
[8:39] was an unbeliever but Uriah was a
[8:41] proelite so Uriah was a genuine believer
[8:45] in the god of Israel so of course they
[8:47] were allowed to marry because he was a
[8:49] proelite and notice that brother Braham
[8:51] didn't say well when I get to heaven I'm
[8:53] going to go up to Uriah and say your
[8:55] interracial marriage was wrong and if
[8:58] you would had any children they would
[8:59] would have been hybrid that's not what
[9:01] brother Bram said because we know both
[9:03] the Bible and brother brandham put Uriah
[9:06] in a very positive light let's listen to
[9:08] the quotes and she was to be mother and
[9:11] brought her in so that he could lay it
[9:13] on Ur and he was not a gentile he was
[9:16] not a Jew he was a gentile
[9:18] amen and he was a hati a proelite to the
[9:22] Jewish religion brother when I get to
[9:25] Glory I want to walk up to your and
[9:26] shake his hands and say God be praise
[9:29] for your testimony meant something to me
[9:32] in my Earthly Journey amen but you're
[9:34] are that Gallant
[9:36] Soldier being yet only a proelite he was
[9:40] a gentile a
[9:42] hatip but he said God forbid me to go
[9:45] down with my wife in the ark of my God
[9:49] on the
[9:50] battlefield when I cross the line
[9:53] between this life and that one there I
[9:55] want to shake your eyes hand he was a
[9:57] real man amen
[10:00] the third example is Ruth and Boaz of
[10:02] course Ruth was a moabitas moabites were
[10:05] not allowed to enter the congregation of
[10:06] the Lord of course in the state that
[10:08] they were heathens or unbelievers but if
[10:10] they were prosites then they were
[10:12] allowed to worship almighty God and Ruth
[10:15] is the best example notice brother Bram
[10:18] says Ruth Story is a beautiful story
[10:20] brother Bram also says it's a beautiful
[10:22] type of Christ in the church notice
[10:24] brother Ram doesn't say Ruth and Boaz is
[10:28] an interracial Mar marriage story of
[10:30] compromise and
[10:31] worldliness and one of the most powerful
[10:33] points is that Ruth's son OED was not a
[10:37] hybrid OED was in the lineage of the
[10:40] Lord Jesus Christ because it went OED
[10:43] Jesse David and then 14 Generations I
[10:46] believe later was the Christ so all
[10:49] these critics and accusations come to
[10:52] nothing in the light of the truth of the
[10:54] Holy Scripture let's listen to the
[10:56] quotes and now Ruth the night woman was
[11:00] a beautiful type of the Gentile bride
[11:04] the beautiful story of of Ruth when
[11:07] returning with neom when neom had lost
[11:09] all of her inheritance and Boaz brought
[11:11] it back I believe I preached on that the
[11:13] last time of year a beautiful picture
[11:16] then we find after he come over and
[11:19] after he come Boaz and there come
[11:21] another Gentile in which he come in by
[11:23] Ruth and out of there come Jess out of
[11:25] Jess come David and a little Hillside
[11:28] stable out there brought forth the King
[11:30] of Kings Jesus Christ the son of David
[11:34] his spiritual son next let's look at
[11:37] Ester and Xerxes brother Ram said Esther
[11:39] is a type of the church today in the
[11:42] sweetness of the Holy Spirit not in the
[11:45] worldliness of some type of make
[11:46] believer or hybrid believer so a Jew
[11:50] marrying a Persian would have been an
[11:51] interracial marriage but it was part of
[11:54] God's perfect plan it was God's choice
[11:56] just like with Moses and Zapora it was
[11:58] God's choice to use Esther to save the
[12:00] Jewish people God is so wonderful God Is
[12:03] So Perfect God is so amazing let's
[12:05] listen to the quotes on Esther Esther
[12:07] was a type of the church today those who
[12:10] are ready to come out and Adorn
[12:14] themselves with the sweetness of the
[12:16] Holy Spirit not the perfuming and the
[12:18] dressing of the world try to compare
[12:21] with them but that hidden man of the
[12:23] heart that's the
[12:25] one next is Rahab and Salon brother Ram
[12:29] said Rahab is a type of the true church
[12:31] not the compromising Church she's a type
[12:34] of the believer today the real believer
[12:37] brother brandom says notice brother
[12:39] randam does not say she's a type of the
[12:41] make believer or the worldly believer or
[12:44] the foolish virgin or something like
[12:45] that brother R always makes her out to
[12:48] be a True Believer she was a Canaanite
[12:50] living in Jericho Jews were not supposed
[12:53] to Mary Canaanites and heathens from
[12:55] other nations but the fact is Rahab was
[12:57] not a heathen she became a believer the
[12:59] fear of the Lord Came Upon her when she
[13:01] heard about God bringing Israel out of
[13:04] Egypt she became a Believer therefore
[13:06] Solon could marry her so let's listen to
[13:08] the quotes on Rahab Rahab didn't ask to
[13:11] see Joshua's
[13:13] sign she just
[13:17] heard a type of the church a type of the
[13:21] true church that's been pulled away at
[13:24] prostitution I'm a Methodist today a
[13:26] Baptist a presbyterian the next day p P
[13:29] away in prostitution yes now Rahab the
[13:33] Harlot known as the Harlot she was the
[13:36] type of the believer today the real
[13:39] believer she didn't say now I hear that
[13:42] U Joshua can do signs because he's a
[13:46] successor of Moses I'd like to see those
[13:49] signs if I can see those signs then I'll
[13:51] believe it well he didn't absolutely
[13:54] have to show those signs because she
[13:57] believed it anyhow last let's look at
[13:59] Joseph and azth brother random of course
[14:02] uses this couple as a type of Christ in
[14:05] the church in the church age book
[14:07] brother uses this couple as a type for
[14:09] the Gentile Rapture when Joseph reveals
[14:12] himself to his Brethren he puts
[14:14] everybody out of the palace and brother
[14:16] Ram said look the bride Joseph's bride
[14:18] is not with Joseph when Joseph reveals
[14:21] himself to his Brethren showing that the
[14:24] raptured Bride of Jesus Christ will be
[14:25] at the marriage supper of the lamb and
[14:28] not here on the Earth Earth during the
[14:29] tribulation when Jesus reveals himself
[14:32] to the
[14:33] 144,000 now where will the Gentile
[14:35] Church be while Jesus is making himself
[14:37] known to his Brethren remember that the
[14:40] Bride of Joseph with the two children
[14:41] were in the palace where Joseph had
[14:44] commanded let everyone leave me put them
[14:47] all out from before me so the Gentile
[14:50] bride was hidden in the Palace of Joseph
[14:53] where will the Gentile Church go in the
[14:55] Rapture into the palace the bride will
[14:58] be taken all off the Earth she will be
[15:00] caught up before the Great Tribulation
[15:02] to meet her Lord in the air so again
[15:04] this is a beautiful type and the point I
[15:06] want to emphasized is this quote I found
[15:08] just this morning where brother ramam
[15:09] said Joseph and az's children were joint
[15:13] Hees into the kingdom into the patriarch
[15:16] promise so Joseph and aanas children
[15:19] were not hybrids they were not to be
[15:21] looked down upon or disrespected or
[15:23] thought lower than other children that
[15:26] were fully Jew these were half Jew half
[15:29] Egyptian children and they became joint
[15:31] heirs into the kingdom and it's
[15:34] completely scriptural here's a visual
[15:35] I'd like to show you I made this years
[15:37] ago when studying The Book of Life
[15:39] Joseph is originally listed with the 12
[15:42] sons of Jacob in Genesis 35 22-
[15:46] 26 but in the Book of Numbers Levi is
[15:50] taken out because his inheritance is the
[15:52] Lord the Lord is his portion and then
[15:55] Joseph is out and his two sons go in
[15:58] Ephraim and manasse they in yellow font
[16:01] to make it easier to see now there's an
[16:03] asterisk by Ephraim and Dan because they
[16:05] commit idolatry and God blots their
[16:07] names out from under Heaven not in
[16:10] heaven brother Ram teaches us that in
[16:11] the church age book so there we see the
[16:14] sons of an interracial marriage become
[16:16] heirs to the kingdom they're in numbers
[16:19] 10 11- 28 they were not hybrids they
[16:23] were not less than other Jewish children
[16:25] fully Jewish blooded children they were
[16:28] individual tribes named among the 12
[16:30] tribes of Israel then in Revelation 7:
[16:33] 4-8 we see the 144,000 tribes receiving
[16:37] the baptism of the Holy Ghost during the
[16:39] tribulation period Dan and Ephraim are
[16:41] still out but there's Manasseh Manasseh
[16:44] m is the son of Joseph and azth an
[16:47] interracial marriage Levi and Joseph are
[16:50] back in because of the names being
[16:52] blotted out but then in the Millennium
[16:54] there in Ezekiel 48 brother Ram tells us
[16:57] all the names are restored so we see
[16:59] Ephraim back in Dan back in and so we
[17:02] see the conclusion throughout all
[17:04] thousand years of the Millennium Ephraim
[17:07] and manasse their tribes will be counted
[17:10] in the 12 tribes of Israel proving they
[17:12] were not hybrid they were not less than
[17:15] they're not to be looked down upon they
[17:17] were chosen in the mind of God before
[17:19] the foundation of the world as the Bible
[17:21] tells us in Ephesians 1 so here's a
[17:24] quote I'd like to play Israel and the
[17:25] church part 1 1953 brother random says
[17:28] he married Gentile woman that produced
[17:30] Ephraim and Manasseh which was joint
[17:33] heirs into the kingdom into the
[17:35] patriarchic promise let's listen to the
[17:37] quote Joseph was given a gentile
[17:42] bride he was rejected of his brothers
[17:46] and turned and took a gentile bride is
[17:48] that right he gave him Pharaoh gave him
[17:52] the priest of or a daughter for a bride
[17:57] and he married a
[17:59] Gentile woman that produced Ephraim and
[18:03] Manasses which was Jord a into the king
[18:07] into the Patriotic
[18:09] promise in closing friends I hope this
[18:11] video was a blessing by the grace of God
[18:13] again these three or four ideas and
[18:15] points kind of came to me this morning
[18:16] so I just thought when I catch the
[18:18] inspiration of the Holy Ghost I'll go
[18:19] back to the scripture quickly go to the
[18:21] quotes and then share them with the
[18:22] Saints by the grace of God so I hope
[18:24] this was a blessing God's word can never
[18:26] fail God's word is always true
[18:29] the word of God sets us free and
[18:31] remember friends if you are forgiven
[18:33] through the blood of Jesus Christ
[18:35] through faith in Jesus Christ you've
[18:36] been baptized in the name of the Lord
[18:37] Jesus Christ and you are a child of
[18:39] Abraham according to the book of
[18:40] Galatians then if you receive the
[18:42] baptism of the Holy Ghost then you are
[18:44] an adopted son or daughter into the
[18:46] kingdom of God that also makes you a
[18:48] king and priest unto God no matter what
[18:50] your natural Human family Tree is like
[18:54] whether you came from an interracial
[18:56] marriage or not God is not looking at
[18:58] the natural seed anymore he's looking at
[19:00] the spiritual seed according to 1 Peter
[19:02] 1:23 we must be born again of The
[19:04] Incorruptible seed the word of God
[19:07] that's one reason God showed us the
[19:08] revelation of the serpent seed because
[19:10] all humans are hybrid with the sin
[19:13] nature they're not like the original
[19:15] humans Adam and Eve who had no sin no
[19:18] all of us have sinned and fallen short
[19:20] of the glory of God so we need a new
[19:22] birth we need a new seed and it's a
[19:24] spiritual seed by the grace of God thank
[19:26] God for the spiritual seed of the baptis
[19:28] AP ISM of the Holy Ghost it's shed
[19:30] abroad in our hearts as Acts chapter 2
[19:32] says let's continue to share this
[19:34] message with every people Kindred nation
[19:37] and tongue according to Revelation 10
[19:40] 8-11 let's keep eating the book The
[19:42] Revelations from the Bible that were
[19:44] restored to us through God's Prophet
[19:46] brother William brandham let's prophesy
[19:48] them again let's share them again until
[19:51] the last one comes
[19:52] in if you have any questions concerns or
[19:55] testimonies about this video please
[19:56] contact me
[19:59] God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[20:01] the desire of your heart
