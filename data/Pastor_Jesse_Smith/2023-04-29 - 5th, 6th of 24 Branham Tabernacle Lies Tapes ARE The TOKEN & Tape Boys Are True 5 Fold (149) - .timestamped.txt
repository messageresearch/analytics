[0:05] that's
[0:07] just been able to read
[0:13] and yes
[0:17] [Music]
[0:33] greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:35] of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of
[0:38] this video is to show the fifth and
[0:41] sixth lies out of 24 lies or more coming
[0:45] out of Branham Tabernacle
[0:48] As A Brief Review the first lie is that
[0:50] every word on brother Ram's tapes is
[0:53] thus say the Lord the tapes can never be
[0:55] wrong and the tapes have no mistakes the
[0:58] second lie is all answers are on brother
[1:01] Rams tapes
[1:02] the third lie is unquestionally believe
[1:05] every word on tape is thus safe the Lord
[1:08] even if brother Branham lied and the
[1:11] fourth lie is a false vision of a
[1:14] denominational mandate that every church
[1:16] has to play brother random's tapes
[1:19] so friends any person that loves Jesus
[1:21] Christ above all and also has the
[1:24] baptism of the Holy Ghost recognizes
[1:26] these four lies and can easily discern
[1:29] that they transgress the Bible the word
[1:32] of God
[1:33] now let's look at the fifth and sixth
[1:35] lies the fifth lie is that the tapes are
[1:39] the token and being part of a tape
[1:42] church is the token
[1:45] now friends both of these statements are
[1:48] false evidences of the baptism of the
[1:50] Holy Ghost because that's what the token
[1:52] is the token is the baptism of the Holy
[1:54] Ghost as the Bible and brother Branham
[1:57] taught
[1:58] so let's listen to today's current
[1:59] Branham Tabernacle leadership Express
[2:02] these lies we'll listen to these lies
[2:05] back to back so you can see the context
[2:07] in which they were spoken let's listen
[2:09] to these lies
[2:11] but they've got to catch the vision you
[2:15] got to play the tapes
[2:18] you've got to
[2:26] amen
[2:34] praise the Lord
[2:36] they're the tokens
[2:37] [Applause]
[2:42] so what did she have to do she had to
[2:45] show her token
[2:48] you know what I said I'm a tape Church
[2:57] amen
[3:00] that's the token
[3:04] amen
[3:07] praise the Lord
[3:11] now that we've heard these lies remember
[3:13] brother Branham never said either of
[3:16] these lies there are no quotes from
[3:19] Brother Branham that state these lies
[3:22] so these lies are proof Branham
[3:24] Tabernacle has now created their own
[3:26] denomination
[3:27] their denomination that has created
[3:29] their own Creeds like press play and
[3:32] Obey and that's equal to any other
[3:34] man-made Creed such as God as three
[3:36] persons or the Pentecostal Creed that
[3:39] tongues are the initial evidence of the
[3:41] Holy Ghost or the Creed of some
[3:43] preachers that say you are the message
[3:46] and any other statement that is not
[3:48] found in the word of God
[3:49] so these two statements are lies friends
[3:52] the holy ghost in the soul of the
[3:54] believer is the token let's listen to
[3:57] brother random plainly say the baptism
[4:00] of the Holy Ghost which is the token and
[4:02] then he'll say receive the token of the
[4:04] baptism of the Holy Spirit
[4:12] together
[4:19] baptism of the Holy Ghost which is the
[4:21] tokenist Hebrews 11 says all these
[4:28] all these and the church in this day
[4:30] that's received the token of the baptism
[4:33] of the holy spirit that the blood has
[4:34] been shed and
[4:37] on the church without
[4:40] and of course let's play these quotes
[4:42] back to back and the first from today's
[4:44] Branham Tabernacle leadership and then
[4:46] the truth from brother Brandon let's
[4:48] listen to the quotes
[4:50] but they got to catch the vision you got
[4:54] to play the tapes they're the tokens
[4:57] [Applause]
[5:01] and the church in this day that's
[5:04] received the token of the baptism of the
[5:06] holy spirit that the blood has been shed
[5:08] and
[5:11] without
[5:14] so what did she have to do she had to
[5:17] show her token
[5:20] you know what I said I'm a tape Church
[5:26] that's the token
[5:30] the whole church survived together it's
[5:32] been
[5:36] baptism odd Holy Ghost which is the
[5:39] token is Hebrews 11.
[5:42] now let's listen to God's Prophet
[5:43] brother random say that he's responsible
[5:46] for a message and he would not point us
[5:48] to random Tabernacle he would only point
[5:50] us to Jesus Christ
[5:52] so this proves being a member of Branham
[5:54] Tabernacle or any other tape church is
[5:58] not the evidence of the token and recall
[6:01] as you heard at the beginning of this
[6:03] video that brother Brandon said Branham
[6:05] Tabernacle would lose its strength let's
[6:07] listen to the quotes back to back
[6:09] messages
[6:16] [Music]
[6:27] [Music]
[6:36] in Jesus Christ
[6:42] [Music]
[6:48] with him in peace with him fancy Christ
[6:53] but in Christ he is God's Tabernacle he
[6:57] is the place that God came into himself
[7:01] friends what a joy to know that God's
[7:03] Prophet brother Brandon pointed us
[7:05] correctly to Jesus Christ and that Jesus
[7:08] Christ's Spirit the Holy Ghost in our
[7:10] souls is the one and only token
[7:13] so all True Believers will understand
[7:15] the token is the baptism of the Holy
[7:18] Ghost and will not accept a man-made
[7:20] Creed that exalts tapes or MP3 files as
[7:24] the token or exalts being part of a tape
[7:28] church is the evidence of the token
[7:30] those statements are complete nonsense
[7:33] and again thankfully Jesus Christ told
[7:36] us what the token was in Acts chapter 1
[7:39] verses 4 and 5. he told his Apostles to
[7:43] wait for the promise of the father in
[7:45] Jerusalem and he says ye shall be
[7:48] baptized with the Holy Ghost not many
[7:49] days hence
[7:51] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[7:53] and forever Jesus Christ was not telling
[7:56] them to wait for tapes or to become part
[7:59] of a tape Church
[8:00] Jesus Christ was telling them to wait
[8:02] for his holy spirit to fall upon their
[8:05] souls quickening their souls and
[8:07] baptizing them into the spiritual body
[8:09] of Jesus Christ
[8:11] also Jesus Christ said in John 16 13
[8:14] when the spirit of Truth has come he
[8:16] would guide you into all truth clearly
[8:19] Branham Tabernacle is not being guided
[8:22] into all truth
[8:23] they're being guided away from truth as
[8:26] this video series plainly shows with 24
[8:29] or more lies that they're propagating to
[8:31] millions and millions of people around
[8:33] the world
[8:34] also John 15 26 Jesus said when the
[8:38] comforters come
[8:39] whom I will send unto you from the
[8:42] father even the spirit of Truth which
[8:43] proceedeth from the father he shall
[8:45] testify of me
[8:47] so notice Jesus Christ said when a
[8:49] person is baptized with the Holy Ghost
[8:51] the spirit of truth that spirit will
[8:53] testify of Jesus Christ and Jesus
[8:56] Christ's word is found in the Holy Bible
[8:58] but today Branham Tabernacle is not
[9:01] pointing to Jesus Christ or the Bible
[9:03] they're pointing people to their own
[9:05] false interpretation of the tapes of
[9:08] brother Branham and they're not even
[9:10] saying what brother Branham said you did
[9:12] not find tapes are equal to the Token in
[9:15] the Bible or on brother Ram's tapes
[9:18] you do not find every word of the
[9:20] seventh angel or seventh Church age
[9:22] messenger is thus saith the Lord in the
[9:24] Bible nor do you find that about any of
[9:26] the seven Church age Messengers
[9:28] because none of them were infallible
[9:30] only Jesus Christ is infallible
[9:34] moving on to the sixth lie coming out of
[9:36] Branham Tabernacle today the sixth lie
[9:39] is that Tate boys are the true five-fold
[9:42] Ministry and tapes are number one in the
[9:45] fivefold ministry and the preaching
[9:48] Ministry is second in the fivefold
[9:50] ministry
[9:51] so first let's listen to the LIE coming
[9:54] out of Branham Tabernacle that says tape
[9:56] boys are the true faithful Ministry and
[9:59] then we'll play another quote where the
[10:01] leadership says tapes are number one
[10:04] let's listen to the lies coming out of
[10:05] Branham Tabernacle
[10:16] they said get under the message display
[10:19] your token or you'll perish
[10:22] and and then when they did that then
[10:26] they played her a tape
[10:28] that's what faithfulness is supposed to
[10:30] do
[10:32] amen
[10:40] a lot of you praise God that you're
[10:42] isolated you know what I just listened
[10:44] to the tapes
[10:46] you know it is when you say
[10:49] that these tapes are secondary to the
[10:52] ministry
[10:54] now your tape people
[10:57] so
[10:59] number one to us is the tapes
[11:02] amen
[11:05] number two is the ministry doesn't
[11:07] matter tapes are first to us mistakes
[11:10] so truly I ain't got time to listen to
[11:13] their tapes I'm gonna listen to the
[11:15] tapes this message
[11:17] so with us if our number one is the
[11:20] tapes I ain't got time then if you teach
[11:22] the people and say the ministry is
[11:24] number two and the ministry is number
[11:26] one and the tapes are number two they
[11:28] ain't got time for the tapes
[11:32] it's called The Seed of discrepancy
[11:36] when you get anybody to disbelief or to
[11:39] say this message a second greater higher
[11:42] equal than God's Prophet it's the seed
[11:45] of discrepancy
[11:48] now that we've heard the lies friends
[11:50] any true honest Christian will know Tate
[11:53] boys are not even mentioned in Ephesians
[11:55] 4 verse 11. which says and he gave some
[11:58] Apostles and some prophets and some
[12:00] evangelists and some pastors and
[12:03] teachers tape boys are not even in the
[12:05] scripture
[12:06] so Jeffersonville leadership is adding
[12:09] to the word of God and we all know the
[12:11] awful consequences to adding to the word
[12:13] of God according to revelation 22 18-19
[12:17] and also proverbs 30 verses 5 and 6.
[12:20] If any man adds to the word plagues will
[12:23] be added unto him if any man adds to the
[12:25] word God will call them a liar according
[12:28] to Proverbs 35 and 6. remember friends
[12:31] these words are spoken in brotherly
[12:32] kindness as a warning to help turn
[12:34] people away from the lies coming out of
[12:37] Branham Tabernacle and to the truth of
[12:39] the Holy scriptures I'm not judging
[12:41] anyone's Eternal destination only God
[12:44] can do that but the Bible tells us in
[12:46] Colossians 1 to warn every man and I've
[12:50] tried to do it privately and it hasn't
[12:52] worked so now I'm trying to do it
[12:54] publicly as humbly as possible by the
[12:56] grace of God and it is actually the love
[12:58] of Jesus Christ that causes us to warn
[13:01] one another to try to help one another
[13:05] as Proverbs 9 verse 8 says reprove not a
[13:08] scorner lest ye hate thee rebuke a wise
[13:10] man and he will love thee if the leaders
[13:12] of Branham Tabernacle are wise they'll
[13:15] be able to accept the correction on
[13:16] these videos repent humble themselves
[13:18] and actually love the videos because
[13:21] it's the Holy Spirit behind it by the
[13:23] grace of almighty God
[13:25] friends this adding of Tate boys into
[13:27] Ephesians 4 11 is the same as the
[13:30] Catholic Church adding Pope into
[13:32] Ephesians 4 11. the office of the pope
[13:35] is not found in the Bible nor is the
[13:37] office of tape boy found in the Bible
[13:40] leadership at today's Branham Tabernacle
[13:42] is committing the sin of twisting or
[13:45] resting the scriptures as the Bible says
[13:48] in second Peter 3 16 the unlearned and
[13:52] unstable rest or twist the scriptures as
[13:55] they do also the other scriptures
[13:57] random Tabernacle is twisting the
[14:00] scripture of Joshua chapter 2 Joshua
[14:02] chapter 2 does not add tape boys into
[14:05] Ephesians 4 verse 11. I've already
[14:07] covered this subject thoroughly in my
[14:10] 77th video called Tate boys are not part
[14:13] of Jesus's fivefold Ministry so if you'd
[14:15] like a more in-depth teaching you can
[14:17] watch that video by God's grace
[14:19] friends also Branham Tabernacle said we
[14:22] don't have time to listen to tapes if we
[14:24] don't put them first that's nonsense we
[14:27] listen to the tapes in our homes we
[14:29] listen to them in our cars while we're
[14:31] traveling and so it's nonsense for the
[14:34] leader to say we don't have time for
[14:35] tapes the fact is we cannot change the
[14:38] pattern that Jesus Christ established on
[14:40] the day of Pentecost and thereafter and
[14:42] also the pattern he gave Saint Paul in
[14:44] Ephesians 4 verse 11. Jesus pattern has
[14:47] always been living preachers preaching
[14:49] the Living Word of the Lord Jesus Christ
[14:52] we respect all preachers who have
[14:55] preached the gospel that have died and
[14:57] gone on to their Eternal reward but we
[14:59] do not pretend that dead men are still
[15:01] alive and let them Pastor over us
[15:03] because God has always had living
[15:05] preachers as pastors teachers evangelist
[15:09] Apostles and so forth in the fivefold
[15:11] ministry
[15:12] so friends the Bible and brother Branham
[15:15] never said the tape should be number one
[15:18] so the reality is Branham Tabernacle has
[15:20] the seed of discrepancy they don't
[15:22] understand the true faithful Ministry
[15:24] the living five-fold ministry will
[15:26] always respect and honor the word of God
[15:29] that was delivered from the previous
[15:31] members of the fivefold ministry and
[15:33] they all work together as one
[15:35] this is exactly what brother Branham
[15:37] taught in 1961 questions and answers
[15:39] where he said Brethren he's speaking to
[15:42] the preachers I'm putting you all the
[15:44] same place as I am because you're just
[15:46] as much into it the message as I am
[15:48] let's listen to the quote
[15:55] [Applause]
[16:03] you see what I'm doing brother I'm
[16:04] putting you all the same place
[16:07] cause you're just as much into it as I
[16:09] am
[16:10] you are messengers of this same message
[16:17] now let's listen to these quotes back to
[16:19] back where Branham tabernacle's current
[16:21] leadership says tapes are number one and
[16:23] yet brother Branham says the fivefold
[16:26] ministry is all the same in other words
[16:28] brother Branham is not higher than
[16:29] anyone else he had his place his
[16:31] position but he's not worshiped let's
[16:34] listen to the quotes
[16:37] so
[16:38] number one to us is the tapes
[16:42] amen
[16:44] number two is the ministry doesn't
[16:47] matter tapes are first to us mistakes
[16:51] so with us if our number one is the
[16:54] tapes I ain't got time then
[17:05] you are messengers of this same message
[17:12] lastly I thought I'd share a quote from
[17:14] 1951 our hope is in God and brother
[17:17] Brown says that tape recordings are a
[17:20] secondary Ministry
[17:30] these recordings are being sent around
[17:33] the nation
[17:34] and they're going into homes and in the
[17:37] halls and so forth they even got us in a
[17:40] movie picture of the day to introduce
[17:41] these things
[17:42] and hundreds of people are being saved
[17:45] and healed right through these
[17:46] recordings
[17:48] aren't you happy that man's got the
[17:50] message on their heart maybe they're not
[17:51] preachers but they're trying to get the
[17:53] message
[17:54] doctors they tell me and manner of
[17:59] great standing in the world
[18:01] are out trying to win souls for Christ
[18:05] God can use these things in a secondary
[18:07] way like this may the Lord Jesus bless
[18:10] everyone that hears the message
[18:12] may they be saved and healed
[18:15] random Tabernacles leadership said the
[18:18] tapes are number one and not secondary
[18:20] as you heard and as I'll play again here
[18:23] in a few moments but notice the very man
[18:26] they say they follow and believe brother
[18:27] Branham said the tape recordings are
[18:29] secondary and yet now Branham Tabernacle
[18:32] is exalting the tapes to primary so
[18:35] again Brigham Tabernacle is not saying
[18:37] what their founder taught when did
[18:40] Brother Branham make tapes primary and
[18:43] not secondary
[18:44] the fact is he never did that's because
[18:47] he was a word Prophet who finished the
[18:50] mystery of God and turned our hearts
[18:52] back to the apostolic fathers so now
[18:54] let's listen to the quotes back to back
[18:55] you'll hear Branham Tabernacles say the
[18:58] tapes are number one and not secondary
[19:01] but then you'll hear God's Prophet
[19:02] brother random say the tapes are
[19:04] secondary
[19:05] let's listen to the quotes
[19:09] you know it is when you say
[19:13] or secondary to the ministry
[19:18] I'm so happy to see these brothers
[19:23] can use these
[19:28] to everyone that hears the message
[19:32] so
[19:33] number one to us is the tapes
[19:37] amen
[19:39] number two is the ministry it doesn't
[19:42] matter tapes are first to us mistakes
[19:46] so with us if our number one is the
[19:49] tapes I ain't got time then
[19:51] I'm so happy to see these Brethren here
[19:53] just a whole line of these recorders God
[19:57] can use these things in a secondary way
[19:59] like this may the Lord Jesus bless
[20:01] everyone that hears the message
[20:04] and lastly friends remember in brother
[20:07] Brown's last recorded sermon from
[20:09] Jeffersonville Indiana at the Branham
[20:11] Tabernacle he preached the evening
[20:13] service God of this evil age in the
[20:16] morning service he deferred to the
[20:19] pastor brother Neville and let brother
[20:20] Neville preach I believe this is a very
[20:23] symbolic expression of brother Ram's
[20:25] respect for each member of the fivefold
[20:28] ministry
[20:29] and brother Ram said he was led of the
[20:30] Holy Spirit to let the pastor preach
[20:33] that morning and not to preach himself
[20:35] this shows brother Ram never made
[20:37] himself primary above the local Pastor
[20:40] brother Neville so why doesn't Branham
[20:42] Tabernacle follow that example now of
[20:44] course it's because they received a seed
[20:46] of discrepancy they're not saying what
[20:49] brother random said they're not saying
[20:51] what the Bible says
[20:52] let's listen to those quotes from
[20:54] Brother Branham
[21:05] I know I had the leading of the Lord to
[21:07] listen to that this morning very fine
[21:09] and I see why you people like to come
[21:12] and listen to him also and he'll always
[21:15] do you good I'm sure
[21:19] in closing friends let's have a word of
[21:22] prayer again for the leadership at
[21:24] Branham Tabernacle and all these
[21:25] millions of people who are deceived
[21:27] they've allowed the seed of discrepancy
[21:29] to give them a strong delusion they
[21:32] received the seed of discrepancy of
[21:34] idolatry and they essentially worship
[21:36] brother Branham and his tapes
[21:39] Heavenly Father Lord we ask in Jesus
[21:41] Christ's name you'll be merciful to this
[21:43] tape Church movement and the leadership
[21:45] at Branham Tabernacle may they repent of
[21:48] their many lies may they recognize
[21:51] the seat of discrepancy they've received
[21:54] dear God their idolatry their
[21:56] misinterpretation of the word of God may
[21:58] they humble themselves and repent and
[22:01] dust and Ashes and get back to the truth
[22:04] I pray God they would not fight against
[22:06] the truth but that they would humble
[22:08] themselves and receive the truth may
[22:10] they receive the spirit of Truth the
[22:12] comforter that they might be guided into
[22:14] all truth back to the Bible
[22:16] back to the revelation of Jesus Christ
[22:19] in the Holy scriptures and asked us
[22:21] humbly in Jesus Christ's name amen
[22:25] if you have any questions concerns or
[22:27] testimonies about this video please
[22:29] contact me
[22:31] God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[22:33] the desire of your heart
