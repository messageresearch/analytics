[1:00] y especially to avoid sexual
[1:04] attention most people consider teaching
[1:07] on a topic like modesty as a form of
[1:09] legalism but that could not be further
[1:12] from the truth because the definition of
[1:13] legalism is excessive adherence to law
[1:17] or
[1:19] formula we must teach modesty because
[1:21] the Bible teaches it just like we must
[1:24] teach that murder and drunkenness are
[1:26] sins we are not being legalistic just
[1:29] because we teach followers of Jesus
[1:31] Christ to observe the commandments of
[1:33] Jesus Christ in fact we are actually
[1:36] fulfilling the Great Commission of Jesus
[1:38] if we are teaching his disciples to
[1:40] observe all his
[1:42] commands Matthew 28:20 teaching them to
[1:46] observe all things whatsoever I have
[1:48] commanded you and lo I Am With You
[1:50] Always even unto the end of the world
[1:54] Amen the real issue with people
[1:56] disliking teaching about modesty is that
[1:59] they do not want to to obey the Bible
[2:01] but Jesus said your love for him was
[2:03] displayed by your obedience for his
[2:06] words John
[2:08] 14:21 he that hath my Commandments and
[2:11] keepeth them is he that loveth me and he
[2:13] that loveth me shall be loved to my
[2:15] father and I will love him and will
[2:17] manifest myself to
[2:19] him if you love Jesus you will gladly
[2:22] obey the Bible in this case with your
[2:24] modest clothing if you love sin you will
[2:27] reject the Bible's teaching on modesty
[2:29] and dress
[2:30] immodestly before we teach the four
[2:33] guidelines we must show how the Bible
[2:35] defines areas of the body some areas
[2:38] need no explanation such as the head
[2:40] feet hands and arms what needs
[2:43] explanation are the following areas to
[2:45] summarized modest clothing that God
[2:47] desires based upon the Bible We Believe
[2:50] Christians today should wear clothes
[2:51] that fully cover the breasts belly loins
[2:55] and thighs at all times the breast belly
[2:59] loins and thighs are all body areas
[3:01] considered nakedness in the sight of God
[3:04] according to Genesis 3: 7 11 and 21 and
[3:09] Isaiah 47:
[3:14] 1-3 the four Bible guidelines we will
[3:17] present help ensure that Christians will
[3:20] be modestly dressed covering all
[3:22] nakedness if they obey the Bible's
[3:24] teaching these four Bible guidelines are
[3:28] cover all areas of nakedness
[3:30] wear one thick layer of clothing or
[3:33] multiple layers of thinner
[3:35] clothing wear gender specific clothing
[3:38] wear clothes like Jesus's Heavenly
[3:40] garments loose long and
[3:44] flowing the four Bible
[3:49] guidelines the first Bible guideline is
[3:52] we should wear clothes that cover areas
[3:55] that God considers
[3:56] nakedness the following scriptures teach
[3:59] this guideline line Genesis 37 and 21
[4:03] Isaiah 47:
[4:06] 1-3 the Bible teaches that Adam and Eve
[4:09] were both naked without clothes before
[4:12] sin entered the world as soon as they
[4:14] partook of the forbidden fruit it caused
[4:17] them to sew fig leaves together to make
[4:19] aprons which were loin
[4:21] coverings the loins refer to the
[4:24] reproductive parts around the area of
[4:26] the hips loins are nakedness
[4:30] in Hebrew the word apron means loin
[4:35] covering Genesis 3:7 and the eyes of
[4:38] them both were opened and they knew that
[4:41] they were naked and they sewed fig
[4:43] leaves together and made themselves
[4:47] aprons but once the voice of God came
[4:49] walking in the garden and acknowledged
[4:52] Adam and Eve's sin God made coats of
[4:54] skins to fully cover more of their
[4:57] nakedness Genesis 3: 21 unto Adam also
[5:02] and to his wife did the Lord God make
[5:04] coats of skins and clothe
[5:06] them we learn that God covered the
[5:09] nakedness of Adam and Eve with more
[5:11] clothing than Adam and Eve have chosen
[5:13] for themselves God's ideas about modesty
[5:16] are always better than man's ideas as we
[5:19] will see God usually asks humans to wear
[5:22] more clothing than they think they need
[5:25] we know this because the word coats
[5:27] means a long shirt-like garment like a
[5:30] tunic that covers from the breast down
[5:33] to nearly the feet Adam and Eve at first
[5:36] chose to cover only the loins the hip
[5:39] area with the reproductive parts but God
[5:41] chose to cover nearly the entire body
[5:44] including the breasts belly loins and
[5:49] thighs in Isaiah 47: 1-3 Isaiah told the
[5:54] virgin daughter of Babylon or the people
[5:56] in the city of Babylon that God would
[5:58] allow their nakedness to be uncovered
[6:00] which included bare legs bare legs in
[6:04] this context meant uncovering the thighs
[6:07] uncovered thighs are
[6:09] nakedness so we learn from God's holy
[6:12] word that men and women should cover
[6:14] their breasts belly loins and thighs
[6:17] with clothes because any of these body
[6:19] erors left uncovered are nakedness in
[6:22] the eyes of
[6:25] God the second Bible guideline is where
[6:29] one leg lay of thick clothing material
[6:31] or wear multiple layers of clothing the
[6:34] following scriptures teach this
[6:36] guideline Genesis 3:21 Matthew 540 and
[6:40] John
[6:44] 21:7 in Genesis 3: 21 we learn that God
[6:48] clothed Adam and Eve with coats of skins
[6:51] these skins were probably lamb skins
[6:53] because we believe the first animal
[6:55] sacrifices on Earth which were done by
[6:57] God himself would have most likely been
[7:00] Lambs as a foreshadowing of the
[7:02] crucifixion of Jesus Christ who is the
[7:04] Lamb of God who takes away the sin of
[7:07] the world according to John 1: 29 lamb
[7:11] skin clothing would be very thick this
[7:13] clothing would not reveal the form of
[7:15] the body making it very modest clothing
[7:18] an easy example of the thickness of this
[7:20] type of clothing is to picture in your
[7:22] mind sheering or sheep skin boots God
[7:26] wanted thick clothing that did not
[7:27] reveal the form of the body
[7:30] as you read later in the Bible you will
[7:31] find Jesus talking about layers of
[7:33] clothing in Matthew 5:40 as he spoke
[7:37] about coats and cloaks Matthew 5:40
[7:41] shows that God desired either one thick
[7:43] layer of clothing or multiple layers of
[7:46] thin clothing probably to accommodate
[7:48] the different weather patterns on the
[7:50] earth the Greek word for coat means a
[7:53] tunic an undergarment usually worn next
[7:56] to the skin the coats Jesus spoke of
[7:58] were thin shirt-like garments like
[8:01] tunics worn next to the skin these coats
[8:04] were the undergarment layer like
[8:06] underwear today but with much more cloth
[8:08] or material than our modern-day
[8:10] underwear because it was like a very
[8:12] long t-shirt the cloak was the outer
[8:15] garment or outside garment worn on top
[8:17] of the tunic or coat
[8:20] undergarment another word for cloak is
[8:22] robe which is like the Scarlet robe the
[8:24] Roman soldiers put on Jesus in Matthew
[8:27] 27:28 this robe or clo cloak was an
[8:30] outer garment usually worn over the
[8:32] tunic the Greek word for cloak means the
[8:34] upper garment the cloak or
[8:37] mantle it is important to note here that
[8:40] God considered a person to be naked when
[8:42] they took off their outer garment or
[8:44] their cloak or robe if the outer garment
[8:47] was taken off then the person would be
[8:48] viewed in only their thin undergarment
[8:51] clothing this guideline is seen in
[8:53] numerous places in the Bible but most
[8:55] easily seen in John
[8:58] 21:7
[9:00] therefore that disciple whom Jesus Lov
[9:02] saith unto Peter it is the Lord now when
[9:04] Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord
[9:06] he GED his father's coat unto him for he
[9:09] was naked and did cast himself into the
[9:13] sea the Greek word for coat means an
[9:16] upper garment a frock which fishermen
[9:19] used to wear at their work the Greek
[9:22] word for naked means clad in
[9:24] undergarments only the outer garments or
[9:27] cloak being laid aside notice that Peter
[9:30] had his outer garment off the Fisher's
[9:33] coat and the Bible recorded Peter as
[9:35] being naked the way to apply this today
[9:38] is for us to be sure we have at least
[9:40] two layers of clothing on or have one
[9:43] thick layer of clothing on and abstain
[9:45] from walking around in our underwear in
[9:47] public this would include not walking
[9:49] around in public or even appearing in
[9:52] public beaches in bathing suits as most
[9:55] bathing suits and shorts only have one
[9:57] layer of thin clothing which is
[9:59] certainly immodest according to the
[10:01] Bible swimsuits almost always reveal the
[10:04] form of the body which is immodest and
[10:06] almost always expose areas of the body
[10:09] that God considers
[10:11] nakedness please continue viewing part
[10:14] two of this video series God bless you
[10:17] and may Jesus Christ be the desire of
[10:19] your
[10:19] [Music]
[10:28] heart
