TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] all that you ever loved and all that ever loved you is gathered here with you to meet God greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to understand brother bram's statement when he went beyond the curtain of time and said he was told that all he ever loved and all that ever loved him would be given to him as a reward for a service to the Lord numerous people have asked me over the years does this mean people will be saved even if they weren't Believers in other words do Believers have this blessing that anyone they love will be saved by God I believe the answer is no I believe every person that is going to be saved must repent of their sins and accept Jesus Christ as their lord and savior on an individual basis by the grace of God hi friends I'm Jesse Smith pastor bride of Christ Fellowship here in Aran Ohio USA and I defend the original Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ that he revealed to St Paul and then had to restore through Martin Luther John Wesley and the late Prophet William Marian brandham who lived from 1909 to 1965 I also defend brother Ram's Godly Christian character so in this video I'm defending the original Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ how salvation is through faith in the blood of Jesus Christ and with this understanding from the scripture we'll understand better brother Ram's experience when he went beyond the curtain of time so let's begin by listening to a quote from God's Prophet brother William brandham there's at least 10 quotes or more where brother randam talks about his experience going beyond the curtain of time the first time I can find that he tells about this experience was May 1960 when he preached the rejected King at the brandham Tabernacle and then he told this all the way up to the final year of his life 1965 and we're listening to the first time he told it publicly it would have been in June of 1960 and the sermon having conferences I want you to notice the context in which brother brandom said the voice told him all that he ever loved and all that ever loved him would be given to him the context is at the end of brother Ram's translation or Vision or experience he says going beyond the curtain of time and at the very end of this experience his horse Prince and his dog Fritz come running to him and it was at that moment that the voice said all that you have loved and all that ever loved you would be given to you so I believe in context this statement is referring to the animals that brother brandom loved and that loved brother brandom during his lifetime would be given to him as a reward right after this experience with his former horse and dog brother ROM feels himself leaving that Dimension and coming back and then he finds himself there in his bed again let's listen to the quote old dog was gone I always thought after Sav I thought wonder when I get over there if I see old Fritz and while I was sitting there I look coming down across the you only hear come old Fritz coming up to me and he was just licking his tongue you on panting like that looking at me I look come in behind him and here come old Prince my horse my saddle horse and he run up to me and he put his neck around me and I said oh God what is this just then a voice spoke and said all that you ever loved and all that ever loved you God has given to you we all here together oh my my heart just melled within me all that you ever loved and all that ever loved you is gathered here with you to meet God hallelujah I said oh praise be to God and about that time I felt myself moving I said I don't have to go back do her and I kept in just a minute I was back there at the bed again so now friends let's look at the Bible what the Bible talks about in regards to people being saved one of the most important verses is acts 238 which says repent be baptized every one of you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and this was right after acts 236 where the multitude asked what shall we do and they had pricked Hearts they had convicted hearts hearts convicted of sin so we see the church was birthed on the day of Pentecost with this salvation prescription we might say the first step is repentance and there's three steps to repentance it's abhorring your past sins it's changing your mind about your sins and it's making amends for your sins according to the Greek Lexicon so the first step of Salvation is repenting from past sins having faith in the blood of Jesus Christ according to Romans chapter 3 also Ephesians 2 says we're saved by grace through faith so a person must have faith in the blood of Jesus Christ trusting in the all sufficient sacrifice of the cross of Jesus Christ repenting of his sins knowing that our sins were placed upon Christ and that Christ's righteousness is imputed unto us for salvation and then Romans 1013 says whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved so an individual must call Upon Jesus himself or herself repenting of their sin trusting in the blood of Jesus Christ for forgiveness and the righteousness of Christ given to the repentant sinner who now become a saint by the grace of God a separated one unto the purpose and gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ so when a person repents they're Justified which means declared righteous as they wish to be this state of justification is also the first step in the three steps of Grace it's the new heart experience as Ezekiel 36 said new heart justification new spirit sanctification and my spirit or God's spirit the baptism of the Holy Ghost and this state of justification this new heart experience is also the first step on the stature of perfect man according to Second Peter chapter 1 faith is the first step Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness and then the Capstone the baptism of the Holy Ghost is Charity Now using the Bible I want to show a beautiful powerful example of how even the love of Jesus could not save the Rich Young Ruler so again this scripture proves that we have to understand brother bram's Vision the correct way we can't just assume anyone we love on the street or anyone in our family is going to be saved just cuz we love them that person has to love God they have to love the Lord Jesus Christ and repent of their sins because here in Mark 10 verse 21 the Bible said then Jesus beholding him loved him and of course then Jesus told him what he had to do what he lacked he lacked the love of God he had too much selfishness about his worldly goods and riches but then in verse 22 the Rich Young Ruler was sad at Jesus's saying went away grief for he had great possessions brother brandom of course tells us that the Rich Young Ruler was likely lost and went to hell brother Bram taught the Rich Young Ruler grew up and became the rich man that went to hell in Luke 16 in hell he lifted up his eyes he was the one that was neglectful of the beggar Lazarus remember Lazarus was saved and the rich man was lost so if that's true even Jesus's own love and compassion for the Rich Young Ruler was enough to save the rich wrong ruler because each individual must repent and trust in the Lord Jesus Christ to be saved so this is a powerful story of Jesus's love and it proves God has love for the sinner because he's the same yesterday today and forever according to Hebrews 13:8 brother Ram said quote God loves Sinners but hates his sin end quote so God loves Sinners but he hates their sin because God is love according to 1 John 4:16 God is love and he that dwelleth in him dwelleth in God and God in him John 3:16 said for God so loved the world so God has a love for Sinners God has a compassion for Sinners just like Jesus had compassion and love he looked on the Rich Young Ruler and loved him we see the same idea in the Old Testament Ezekiel 33:11 as I live sayith the Lord I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked but that the wicked turn from his way and live so God has always had a compassionate love upon all Sinners that's why he sends his rain upon the just and the unjust he lets the sun rise upon the just and the unjust according to Matthew CH 5 because God is love now let's look at some more quotes from God's Prophet brother brandom in this first quote brother brandom says I can't save you I can only obey what he says do it's up to you for your salvation shall we pray so obviously brother Ram put the importance of being saved on the individual brother Ram said I can't save you you've got to choose to accept God's grace and be saved let's listen to the quote but Jesus is give you a sign these signs shall follow them that [Applause] believe I can't save you I can only obey what he says do it's up to you for your salvation shall we pray in the next quote brother Ram says a minister can't save you he can tell you the word and point you to Christ and then he says and Christ can't save you what he's already done he saved you 1,900 years ago you just have to accept it so brother's talking about how the sacrifice of Jesus Christ already purchased your healing nearly 2,000 years ago and you just have to accept what Christ did he shed his blood he was wounded for your transgressions but with his stripes you were healed you just have to accept the Saving Grace that's already been provided for you by the Cross of Christ let's listen to the quote a man preaching Divine Healing doesn't make him a Healer no more it makes a man a savior a minister can't save you he can tell you the word and point you to Christ and Christ came save you what he's already done he saved you 1900 years ago you just have to accept it well then he man can't heal you he can only point you to Christ who healed you 1900 years ago when he died and the next quote brother BR said because man can't save you when man can only make an altar call but it's your individual or personal faith and trust in God to plunge beneath the blood and to be filled with his spirit and by become a partaker of the Divine not a partaker of the church a partaker of the Divine so A beautiful statement from God's Prophet brother brandom again placing it on the individual brother Ram never said well if I just love you you can be saved he said you've got to trust in the blood of Jesus Christ and you've got to be plunged underneath the blood of Jesus Christ you must come to the fountain filled with blood drawn from emanuel's veins let's listen to the quote I think the day that great man has swept this nation back and forth Jack schoters Billy Grims many others went over and over and over and over through the nation and go right back the same year and find the same group that he preached to just as far diluted in sin as he ever was because man can't save you the man can only make an overall but it's your individual of personal faith and trust in God to plunge beneath the blood and to be filled with his spirit and become a partakers of the Divine not a partaker of the church a partaker of the Divine the divine nature changing your own vile nature into a nature that loves God who BS every word that he said is the truth and accepting it as your own personal gift from God in the next quote brother Ram said there's no man that can save you I don't care what he does he can't save you he can't do nothing to save you Christ saves you but he's made the way for you to be saved brother Ram said it's your faith so see the individual must have faith in the blood of Jesus Christ only Christ saves Believers our human love and compassion for others will not save them the individual must have love for Jesus Christ must repent of his sins and want to be saved that's the gospel let's listen to the quote now we misunderstand when we say healing when we say salvation there's no man can save you I don't care what he does he can't save you he can't baptize you enough in water he can't do nothing to save you Christ saves you but he's made the way for you to be saved remember you can only be saved by your personal faith you can only be healed by your personal faith you believe this to be the Bible am God's word you believe your pastor to be a man of God whatever Church you go to if you don't you should leave it get to a man that is a man of God then if you believe him believe he's telling you the truth then accept that your own personal faith in Christ saves you no matter how good your pastor is how Godly saintly your mother is how how real the word of God is how much you cry how much you pray it's your faith that saves You by faith are you saved in the next quote brother Ram said a believer's got to be born just exact like his daddy was cuz God doesn't have grandchildren he's got to have the experience he can't go in on Papa's experience or Mama's experience you got to have your own experience that was their birth you know you have to have a birth too so this proves people cannot be saved through brother bram's experience each individual must have their own baptism of the Holy Ghost experience let's listen to the quote a lot of people it's half born part of the way born grandsons as davidy said the other night God don't have grandchildren he only has sons and daughters but when comes to a place that a grandchild that's just brought in by cause his mother was Pentecostal or his daddy was Pentecostal he becomes part of the church no sir he's got to be born just like his daddy was God doesn't have grandchildren he's got to have the experience you can't go on Papa's experience or Mama's experience you got to have your own experience that was their birth you don't you have to have a birth too God don't recog has grandchildren am he doesn't have any they're all sons and daughters in the next quote brother Ram's talking about Moses on the back side of the desert and brother Ram said every Christian should have that experience before they say anything about being a Christian your own experience no man has a right to call himself a Christian until he's talked face to face with God so again brother Ram never says I can talk to God for you and my love for you can save you no brother Ram said every IND individual must meet God face to face in order to repent and be saved let's listen to the quote so no man has the right to call himself thus until he's talked face to face with God on a backside of a desert somewhere where he met God himself and all the atheists in the world could not explain it away from him he was there he know it happened every Christian should have that experience before they say anything about being a Christian your own experience next point I want to make is that brother Ram did say there will be surprises on the day of Judgment of course this will be foolish virgins there's two types of Christians two different resurrections for those two different type of Christians now we see the foolish virgins resurrected and saved at the white Throne judgment we see this in Matthew 25: 34-40 These Foolish virgins will be surprised at the Judgment because they were secret Believers as brother Ram taught and brother RAM used biblical examples for us to understand men like jeras Nicodemus and Gia in Matthew 25 34-40 these Believers were surprised on the day of judgment because they had a secret faith in Christ but they did a few public acts of Grace and kindness towards Holy Ghost filled Saints and that was proof of their faith Jesus gave six acts that they did and when they did these acts to Believers it was as if they were doing it to Christ himself they visited the believer in prison they fed them when they were hungry they clothed them when they were naked they provided housing to them they gave them drink when they were thirsty and they visited the sick so the foolish virgins many of them will be surprised on the day of judgment but they're saved because they were secret believers they belied in God therefore they visited God's people they helped God's people in their times of trouble brother Ram clearly taught this in chapter 7 of the church age book in the sardian church age brother Ram said they're given eternal life on the ground that they've been kind and good to the Brethren and These Foolish virgins will also be judged by their Works according to Revelation 20:2 but remember they're not saved by works but the works are proof that they had Faith because Galatians 5:6 says Faith Works by love so the foolish virgins had love for God they must have secretly repented had a new heart got Justified got saved but they could only go to that first step of justification but that love for God gave them faith faith and that Faith caused them to work and go minister to those Holy Ghost filled Saints in those six conditions they were in prison they were hungry they needed clothes they needed housing they were thirsty or they were sick so again no man or woman is saved by works they're saved by grace through faith but that Faith must work according to Galatians 5:6 it starts with receiving the love of Christ that gives us faith and that causes us to work and do something for others by the grace of God regarding Nicodemus and Gia brother Braham said because of their love of the people of God they'll be recognized and saved they served and help the children of God in times of trouble brother Ram said perhaps like Nicodemus and Gia they stood for the children in a time of trouble so again brother Ram gives us a perhaps brother Ram doesn't know for sure that Nicodemus or Gia will be the foolish virgins but he says perhaps because in the scripture we see they were secret believers they love God to a certain degree but they could only live a little bit of the word they couldn't live all the word of God but they never blasphemed the message of the hour then brother Ram called him a separated god-loving people trying to abide in the word according to all that they knew and they were help in the work of the Lord and will come up at the end time now regarding the secret believer brother Bram said God forces the secret believer to the issue of standing for him he said God knows how to force you to show your color what you are so we see that in jer's case God forced the issue he had to decide was he going to believe Jesus or not so he believed Jesus and his daughter was resurrected we see this with Nicodemus Nicodemus eventually left the Sanhedrin he stood for Jesus Nicodemus was mentioned as taking part in the preparation for the anointing and burial of the body of Christ so God brought the issue on Nicodemus to show his true colors he was a Believer just a secret believer and then God did the same for Gia in the book of Acts some of the Jews wanted to kill the apostles but G said don't kill them if it's of God you can't stop it if it's not of God it'll come to not so gilia stood for the children of God in a time of trouble so if you like a full teaching on this I preached on this on August 18th 2024 called The Secret believer I'll leave a link to it in the description by the grace of God in closing friends hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God As I said over the years I've been asked this question numerous times does brother Ram's experience apply to us his experience of hearing all that you ever loved and all that ever loved you given to you as a reward so it seems like maybe in relation to our animals in our life I believe that would be given to every believer because we know there's animals in heaven in Revelation 19 all these horses come out of Heaven there's horses that came and got Elijah when he was raptured there in 2 Kings but I do not believe this statement all you ever loved refers to humans I do not believe one human can save another I believe each individual human must repent of his own own sin and have personal faith in the Lord Jesus Christ himself in order to be saved just as the scriptures told us from Ephesians 2 Romans 10 acts 238 and of course there's many other scriptures that relate to salvation but the individual must have faith in the Lord Jesus Christ in order to be saved friends it's such an amazing picture of God's love in Matthew 25 with the foolish virgins there at the white Throne judgment These Foolish virgins didn't even know Jesus was veiled behind his breath Brethren the Holy Ghost filled Saints reminds us of the sermon brother random preached the unveiling of God brother R showed how God always veiled himself in the pillar of fire in mzc he veiled himself in the Tabernacle of Moses Tabernacle of Solomon and then he veiled the fullness of the godhead B in his son Jesus Christ Hallelujah glory to God for that but now he's veiled behind Believers not the fullness of God but a portion of God a measure of God living behind every believer today who's baptized with the Holy Ghost so God 's love is so amazing that he would save secret believers who had salvation in a private secret way in their lives he would save them and acknowledge their works of being good to his Brethren the Holy Ghost filled Saints it's so amazing that Jesus told These Foolish virgins he even knew them before the foundation of the world Matthew 25:34 then shall the king say unto them on his right hand come he blessed on my father so all these secret Believers were still blessed by God God forne them before the foundation of the world Jesus said they'll inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world so again it proves Jesus Christ has forn knowledge of every single believer whether wise virgin or foolish virgin Jesus has great compassion on both so I trust this topic has been a great blessing to your heart again seeing the amazing love of our Lord Jesus Christ and may this inspire all of us to be good to the Brethren other Holy Ghost filled Saints foolish virgin even our enemy Jesus said we're supposed to love our enemies so let's visit them in prison let's feed them let's give them clothes let's house them let's give them drinks and let's visit the sick let's Express the love of Jesus Christ to all Humanity if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
