[0:07] greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:09] of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of
[0:12] this video is to teach Bible truth about
[0:14] predestination the Greek definition of
[0:17] predestination is predetermined
[0:19] determined before or limit in advance
[0:23] friends God does determine events
[0:26] beforehand but he only predestinate
[0:28] through a fair objective process called
[0:31] his foreknowledge and this order is
[0:34] found in Romans 8:29 through 30 for whom
[0:37] he did foreknow he also did predestinate
[0:39] to be conformed to the image of his son
[0:41] that he might be the firstborn among
[0:43] many brethren moreover whom he did
[0:46] predestinate them he also called and
[0:49] whom he called them he also justified
[0:51] and whom he justified them he also
[0:53] glorified so the order is first
[0:57] foreknowledge God's knowledge of each
[1:00] person's choice about salvation before
[1:03] their birth second predestination third
[1:08] calling or election or choosing fourth
[1:13] justification fifth glorification
[1:19] this order is also supported in first
[1:21] Peter 1 verse to elect according to the
[1:24] foreknowledge of God the Father through
[1:26] sanctification of the spirit unto
[1:29] obedience and sprinkling of the blood of
[1:31] Jesus Christ grace unto you and peace be
[1:34] multiplied these three scriptures Romans
[1:38] 8:29 and 30 and 1st Peter 1 verse 2 lay
[1:42] the foundation for helping answer our
[1:43] questions about predestination let's
[1:46] answer four questions about
[1:48] predestination the first question about
[1:50] predestination is does God forcefully
[1:53] predestinate some people to heaven and
[1:55] others to hell without giving them a
[1:58] choice no the truth is God mercifully
[2:01] and objectively predestinate some people
[2:03] to heaven and others to hell
[2:06] based upon his foreknowledge of each
[2:08] person's own free more agency even
[2:12] before the world was founded God
[2:13] foreknew what each person would choose
[2:15] in regards to salvation and so he wisely
[2:18] predetermined events in their lives so
[2:20] they have the opportunity to be saved
[2:22] and do his will or if they are lost they
[2:26] have no excuses as to why they did not
[2:28] repent of their wickedness Romans 1
[2:31] verses 19 to 21 says all men are without
[2:34] excuse on Judgment Day for two reasons
[2:36] first because God manifests his creative
[2:39] power in every human body and second his
[2:42] eternal power is revealed through nature
[2:46] God would never punish a person for
[2:48] something he made them do God is just
[2:51] not unjust there is no unrighteousness
[2:53] with God according to Roman's 914 God
[2:57] will save all who love him but God will
[3:00] give those who do not love him what they
[3:01] want eternal separation from him while
[3:05] the separation for sinners is eternal
[3:07] the punishment is not eternal the lake
[3:10] of fire is not an eternal destination
[3:12] which will be covered in a future video
[3:14] Lord willing according to Ephesians 1
[3:17] verse 5 and verse 11 God predetermines
[3:20] believers to be adopted into his family
[3:22] as his children according to the purpose
[3:25] of his own will Ephesians 1 5 having
[3:29] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[3:32] children by
[3:32] Christ to himself according to the good
[3:35] pleasure of his will
[3:36] verse 11 in whom also we have obtained
[3:39] an inheritance being predestinated
[3:41] according to the purpose of him who
[3:43] worketh all things after the counsel of
[3:45] his own will a second question is if God
[3:51] doesn't force people to be lost how do
[3:53] you explain Romans 9 21 where it says
[3:56] there are vessels unto honor and others
[3:58] unto dishonour friends God does not
[4:01] force people to be lost again start with
[4:04] the order of predestination in Romans 8
[4:06] and first Peter chapter 1 God starts
[4:10] with four knowledge about each person's
[4:12] final choice whether to love him or love
[4:14] sin based upon his foreknowledge he
[4:17] forms a few vessels of Honor or Holy
[4:20] Ghost filled Christians and the rest are
[4:22] vessels of dishonor because he knows
[4:24] they will love wickedness Romans 917
[4:28] gives us an example of this as it says
[4:30] God raised up Pharaoh in the days of
[4:32] Moses that he might show his power in
[4:34] him God knew Pharaoh would keep
[4:37] hardening his heart against God's
[4:38] command to let his people go
[4:40] and so God used that foreknowledge to
[4:42] display the ten plagues and the
[4:44] miraculous crossing of the Red Sea
[4:47] romans 9 17 for the scripture saith unto
[4:50] pharaoh even for the same purpose have I
[4:53] raised thee up that I might show my
[4:55] power in thee and that my name might be
[4:57] declared throughout all the earth a
[5:00] third question is is free more agency
[5:04] taught in Scripture yes free more agency
[5:07] is fully taught in Scripture as God does
[5:09] not predetermine our decisions in
[5:12] Genesis chapters 1 through 3 God set
[5:15] life the tree of life and death the tree
[5:19] of knowledge of good and evil before
[5:21] Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden they
[5:23] freely chose death Eve through deception
[5:26] and Adam through willing disobedience
[5:28] God gave Cain the choice of obedience or
[5:32] disobedience Genesis 4:7 says if thou
[5:36] doest well shalt thou not be accepted
[5:38] and if thou doest not well sin lieth the
[5:41] door and unto thee shall be his desire
[5:43] and thou shalt rule over
[5:46] God also set life and death before
[5:49] Israel in Deuteronomy 30 verses 15 to 20
[5:54] Joshua told Israel to choose you this
[5:56] day who in Joshua 24 verse 15 notice
[6:02] that God tempts no man but he allows
[6:04] temptation and at the same time will not
[6:07] allow it to be overpowering
[6:09] according to James 1:13 job 1 verse 12
[6:12] and first Corinthians 10:13 God's
[6:16] judgment is based upon human choice
[6:18] according to Roman's 2 verses 6 to 8 God
[6:23] encourages the pursuit of happiness but
[6:25] reminds us that every work and decision
[6:28] will be weighed in judgment Ecclesiastes
[6:30] 11 verse 9 rejoice o young man in thy
[6:34] youth and let thy heart Cheerilee in the
[6:35] days of thy youth and walk in the ways
[6:38] of thine heart and in the sight of thine
[6:40] eyes but know thou that for all these
[6:42] things God will bring thee into judgment
[6:46] Ecclesiastes 12:13 2:14 let us hear the
[6:50] conclusion of the whole matter fear God
[6:52] and keep his Commandments for this is
[6:54] the whole duty of man for God shall
[6:57] bring every work into judgment with
[6:58] every secret thing whether it be good or
[7:01] whether it be evil at Judgment Day the
[7:04] white throne judgment
[7:06] each person will be judged according to
[7:08] their works or decisions within their
[7:10] freemore agency revelation 20 verse 12
[7:14] and I saw the dead small and great stand
[7:16] before God and the books were opened and
[7:19] another book was opened which is the
[7:20] book of life and the dead were judged
[7:22] out of those things which were written
[7:24] in the books according to their works
[7:29] a fourth question about predestination
[7:30] is does God give everyone an equal
[7:33] chance to be saved yes and he does it
[7:36] with love and goodness in John 7:37 239
[7:41] Jesus offered the living water of the
[7:43] Holy Ghost to any man saying if any man
[7:46] thirst let him come unto me and drink
[7:48] today any man or woman can come to
[7:51] Christ to drink of his Holy Spirit
[7:54] the book of Revelation ends with an
[7:56] invitation to everyone whosoever will to
[7:59] come to the New Jerusalem revelation
[8:02] 22:17 and the spirit and the bride say
[8:05] come and let him that heareth say come
[8:07] and let him that is athirst come and
[8:10] whosoever will let him take the water of
[8:13] life freely God is not willing that any
[8:17] should perish wishes all men could be
[8:19] saved and does not delight in the death
[8:22] of the wicked 2nd Peter 3:9 the Lord is
[8:25] not slack concerning his promise as some
[8:27] men count slackness but is
[8:30] long-suffering to us-ward not willing
[8:32] that any should perish but that all
[8:34] should come to repentance first Timothy
[8:37] 2 verses 3 through 4 for this is good
[8:40] and acceptable in the sight of God our
[8:42] Savior who will or wishes in the Greek
[8:46] have all men to be saved and to come
[8:49] unto the knowledge of the truth God
[8:52] longs for all to be saved because God
[8:54] does not delight in the death of the
[8:56] wicked Ezekiel 33 verse 11 saying to
[9:00] them as I live saith the Lord God I have
[9:03] no pleasure in the death of the wicked
[9:04] but that the wicked turn from his way
[9:07] and live terney
[9:09] turn you from your evil ways for why
[9:11] will ye die o house of Israel God offers
[9:15] salvation with love and goodness to
[9:17] every single person Jeremiah 31 verse 3
[9:20] the Lord hath appeared of old unto me
[9:22] saying yay I have loved thee with an
[9:25] everlasting love therefore with
[9:27] loving-kindness have i drawn thee romans
[9:30] 2 verse 4 or despises thou the riches of
[9:34] His goodness and forbearance and
[9:35] longsuffering not knowing that the
[9:37] goodness of God leadeth thee to
[9:39] repentance Jesus love the rich young
[9:42] ruler in ma
[9:43] 10 verse 21 but the young man turned
[9:46] down Jesus's offer to be an apostle
[9:48] because he loved money Jesus also called
[9:52] Judas friend in Matthew 26 verse 50
[9:55] proving his great compassionate heart
[9:57] even for the son of perdition your
[10:01] responsibility Peter teaches your job
[10:04] and my job is to make your calling and
[10:07] election sure 2nd Peter 1 verse 10
[10:10] wherefore the rather brethren give
[10:13] diligence to make your calling and
[10:14] election sure for if you do these things
[10:17] you shall never fall twice Peter tells
[10:21] us to give all diligence as we serve the
[10:23] Lord Jesus Christ diligence in the Greek
[10:26] means to hasten to make haste to exert
[10:29] oneself endeavor give diligence by your
[10:34] own free more agency and by your own
[10:36] love make your calling and election sure
[10:39] prove to everyone your love for God and
[10:42] the location of your treasure is your
[10:44] treasure on earth or in heaven the Bible
[10:47] says your affection should be set on
[10:49] things in heaven for where your treasure
[10:51] is there will your heart be also you and
[10:55] I don't know who is predestinated to be
[10:58] a vessel of Mercy or vessel of Wrath so
[11:01] we must give all diligence to make our
[11:02] calling and election sure Ephesians 2:10
[11:05] says God created you to do his good
[11:08] works that he ordained you to walk in
[11:10] for we are his workmanship created in
[11:13] Christ Jesus unto good works which God
[11:16] hath before ordained that we should walk
[11:18] in them in closing if you would like
