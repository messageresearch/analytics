[0:02] the Evangelist is a special man he's a
[0:06] man that's burning like a fireball he
[0:08] runs into a city and preaches his
[0:10] message and gets out of there somewhere
[0:11] else see he's a special
[0:14] man greetings friends in the matchless
[0:17] name of the Lord Jesus Christ what is an
[0:20] evangelist a viewer asked me this
[0:22] question recently so I've been making a
[0:24] series on the fivefold ministry by God's
[0:27] grace an evangelist is a bringer of good
[0:29] tidings
[0:30] hi friends I'm Jesse Smith pastor of
[0:32] bride of Christ Fellowship here in akan
[0:33] Ohio USA and I defend the original
[0:36] Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ that he
[0:38] revealed to St Paul then had to restore
[0:40] through Martin Luther John Wesley and
[0:42] the late Prophet William Maran Bram who
[0:44] lived from 1909 to
[0:46] 1965 I also defend brother Ram's Godly
[0:49] Christian character this video is the
[0:51] third video in a series on the fivefold
[0:53] ministry we've already done what is a
[0:55] pastor and what is an apostle in this
[0:57] third video we're looking at what is the
[0:59] evangelist
[1:00] so just as we did for the word Apostle
[1:03] we'll look to the Greek Lexicon for what
[1:05] is an evangelist and it means a bringer
[1:07] of Good Tidings an evangelist It also
[1:10] says those Heralds of Salvation through
[1:13] Christ who are not
[1:15] Apostles let's remember that an apostle
[1:17] is one who is sent to introduce the
[1:20] gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ to those
[1:21] that have never heard it to make
[1:23] converts to show Great Signs wonders and
[1:25] miracles and then to set in order
[1:28] churches established with with elders
[1:31] and of course each local church would
[1:32] have a local Elder who is the pastor or
[1:35] also known as the bishop of the church
[1:37] so we must differentiate an evangelist
[1:39] from the other four preaching gifts so
[1:42] the Evangelist is a bringer of Good
[1:44] Tidings so he's not an apostle he's not
[1:47] introducing the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:49] to people that have never heard it he's
[1:51] preaching to those who have already
[1:53] heard the Gospel of Jesus Christ and
[1:55] also he's not a pastor a pastor stays in
[1:57] one location and Shepherds flock of
[2:00] Believers so an evangelist travels to
[2:04] other churches outside of his own home
[2:06] church and he's not necessarily a
[2:09] teacher a teacher is an instructor who
[2:11] tells by the scripture how to observe
[2:14] all the commands of the Lord Jesus
[2:15] Christ as we'll look at in a future
[2:17] video by the grace of God and he's not a
[2:19] prophet the Evangelist is not a prophet
[2:22] who speaks with thus sayith the Lord
[2:24] prophesies about future events and
[2:27] interprets the word of God or in other
[2:29] words gives the true meaning of the word
[2:31] of God so we'll use the Bible of course
[2:34] to Define an evangelist further he's one
[2:36] who brings Good Tidings the first time
[2:39] the word evangelist is used in the Bible
[2:41] is acts
[2:42] 21:8 Paul said we entered into the house
[2:45] of Philip the Evangelist which was one
[2:47] of the seven and Abode with him so the
[2:49] first evangelist we see in the scripture
[2:51] is philli and he had four virgin
[2:53] daughters who prophesied in Acts
[2:55] 21:9 and then Ephesians 4:11 list the
[2:59] fivefold ministry Apostles prophets and
[3:01] some
[3:02] evangelists and some pastors and
[3:05] teachers and the final time we see the
[3:07] Evangelist listed in the scripture is 2
[3:09] Timothy 4:5 Paul tells Timothy in his
[3:11] final letter but watch thou in all
[3:13] things endure afflictions do the work of
[3:15] an evangelist make full proof of thy
[3:18] Ministry now based upon those three
[3:20] verses that use the word evangelist we
[3:22] can look to other scriptures to help us
[3:24] understand more about the Evangelist a
[3:27] very helpful one would be Acts 15:3 six
[3:30] the Bible says in some days after Paul
[3:32] said unto Barnabas let us go again and
[3:34] visit our brethren in every city where
[3:36] we have preached the word of God and see
[3:38] how they do this verse shows St Paul and
[3:41] Barnabas doing Evangelistic work they've
[3:44] already done missionary work and
[3:45] established churches and now they're
[3:47] moving into
[3:48] evangelism because they're going to
[3:51] cities and churches that have already
[3:53] heard the word of the Lord and they're
[3:55] going to try to further establish them
[3:57] and strengthen them in the word of God
[3:59] so we see
[4:00] Paul and Barnabas doing both Apostle
[4:02] work and
[4:04] evangelism so this is what
[4:05] differentiates an evangelist from the
[4:08] Apostle the Apostle continually goes to
[4:10] places that don't have churches and
[4:12] tries to establish churches through
[4:14] preaching signs Miracles and wonders and
[4:16] then establishes local churches and sets
[4:19] in order the church with a pastor the
[4:22] pastor stays in one Church most of the
[4:24] time the teacher can of course travel to
[4:27] numerous churches But the teacher will
[4:28] instruct the people to to observe the
[4:30] commands of God and the prophet will
[4:32] speak with thus sayith the Lord let's
[4:34] look at a few quotes from God's Prophet
[4:35] brother brandom about evangelists in
[4:37] 1955 he said there were numerous
[4:40] examples of evangelists who swept back
[4:42] and forth across the nation he named
[4:44] Billy Graham Jack Schuler Jackie Burch
[4:47] and or Roberts and he said many of the
[4:49] Great evangelists that just crossed back
[4:51] and forth through our nation comb back
[4:54] and comb back and forth back and forth
[4:57] so that quote backs up what we saw Paul
[4:59] Barnabas do in Acts
[5:02] 15:36 they would just go back and visit
[5:04] the Believers and strengthen them and
[5:06] bring them good tidings let's listen to
[5:08] the quote you know that just look at the
[5:11] Evangelist who swep Across the Nation
[5:14] look at Billy grim and Jack Schuler and
[5:17] and Jackie burst and all all those
[5:20] others and Oral Roberts and the many of
[5:23] the Great evangelist has just cross back
[5:25] and forth and through the nation and
[5:27] comb back and comb back and forth back
[5:29] and forth back
[5:30] for there's another quote we often hear
[5:33] about the Evangelist it's from 1963
[5:35] warning then judgment brother am just
[5:37] makes a few sentences about evangelist
[5:39] he calls him a special man that burns
[5:41] like a fireball he runs into a city
[5:43] preaches his message gets out of there
[5:46] and then somewhere else he's a special
[5:48] man so this also helps differentiate the
[5:51] Evangelist he goes to establish churches
[5:54] preaches the word and then leaves let's
[5:57] listen to the quote the abang Jesus is a
[6:00] special man he's a man that's burning
[6:03] like a fireball he runs into a city and
[6:05] preaches his message and gets out of
[6:07] there somewhere else see he's a special
[6:10] man in
[6:13] closing friends hope this video was a
[6:15] blessing by the grace of God we've now
[6:16] looked at three of the gifts of the five
[6:18] full ministry the Evangelist is a great
[6:20] work it's a special work as Paul said do
[6:23] the work of an evangelist it's a lot of
[6:26] work for a man to travel to EST Lish
[6:29] churches bring the Good Tidings and
[6:32] visit time and time again it's a
[6:34] wonderful
[6:35] Ministry I personally know numerous
[6:38] evangelists who come to our church and
[6:40] minister they often stir up the people
[6:43] we often get Supernatural testimonies
[6:45] and answers to prayer through the work
[6:46] of the Evangelist so as a pastor I'm
[6:48] very grateful for the work of the
[6:50] Evangelist and of course I myself have
[6:52] done evangelism work as well sometimes I
[6:55] get invitations to preach of course at
[6:57] established churches and I do the work
[6:59] of an evangelist by the grace of God
[7:01] just in a very small measure and as
[7:03] we'll see in future videos by God's
[7:05] grace I'm working on a video how brother
[7:06] brandom had all five gifts all five
[7:09] preaching gifts and he would just kind
[7:11] of move into each gift as God led him
[7:15] and we see that in the Bible was St Paul
[7:17] by the Holy Spirit St Paul would
[7:19] transition from one gift one preaching
[7:22] gift to the other he started off as an
[7:24] apostle then he would be a pastor in a
[7:28] new church such as at Ephesus brother
[7:29] Ram said he was the pastor there for 3
[7:31] years he called himself a teacher to the
[7:34] Gentiles we saw him and Barnabas do
[7:36] evangelism in Acts 15:36 and of course
[7:39] he was a prophet when he foretold things
[7:41] in the name of the Lord like the Rapture
[7:43] in 1 Thessalonians 4:15 through1 17
[7:46] let's have a word of prayer for our
[7:47] evangelist Lord we thank you for the
[7:49] evangelists Lord God out in the field
[7:51] today Lord further anoint them
[7:53] strengthen them to be Bringers of Good
[7:55] Tidings to the Believers Lord God may
[7:57] they be Fireballs to stir the Saints up
[8:01] like a brand plucked out of the fire
[8:02] lord God may they have wonderful
[8:04] testimonies signs Miracles and wonders
[8:06] Lord God stiring up the people give them
[8:09] strength to travel strength to endure
[8:12] the trials the tests of their office
[8:14] they're doing a great work may they
[8:16] cross this nation Lord and other nations
[8:18] back and forth winning souls for the
[8:20] kingdom of God for the glory of our Lord
[8:22] Jesus Christ we thank you for the
[8:23] Evangelist anoint these special men
[8:25] further as Lord you finish the Great
[8:27] Commission and end up the time of the
[8:30] Gentiles we give you glory in Jesus
[8:32] Christ's name
