Description:
Hebrews chapters 5 and 6 describe two kinds of Christians based upon their spiritual diets: milk and meat. These two diets represent the two kinds of Christians: wise (meat) and foolish (milk). 

Hebrews 6:1-3 lists 6 elementary doctrines Christians must understand before moving on to perfection, or completion, with the baptism of the Holy Ghost. 

These 6 elementary doctrines are necessary for believers who are in the first two works of grace: justification and sanctification.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] greetings friends in the name above all names the lord jesus christ the purpose of this video is to show the difference between milk christianity and meet christianity the inspiration from this video came from a recent sermon i preached and while i was preaching i felt like the holy spirit gave me a little more insight into this context regarding the scriptures of hebrews chapter 5 and hebrews chapter 6. while preaching on these scriptures i found that a believer could recognize where they are in the three works of grace whether they're in justification sanctification or the baptism of the holy ghost based upon the word that they were hearing and living by the grace of god so let's begin with the context of hebrews chapters five and six and then we'll look at the six doctrines that are needed for a justified christian and a sanctified christian the context of hebrews chapters 5 and 6 beginning in hebrews 5 verse 10 the bible says called of god and high priest after the order of melchizedek speaking of jesus christ verse 11 says of whom we may have many things to say and hard to be uttered seeing ye are dull of hearing so the hebrews author likely paul tells these hebrew christians their doll of hearing or their slow of understanding regarding melchizedek and jesus christ this should make us grateful that our prophet william branham preached on who is this melchizedek in 1965 which provided us great revelations regarding the godhead notice the writer likely paul had more to say about melchizedek and jesus christ but he knew the hebrew christians could not handle that type of preaching verse 12 tells us why for when for the time you ought to be teachers you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of god and are become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat this scripture shows the truth that christians should mature in their understanding so they can teach others about the christian faith but if they're not able to do that that shows they have not moved on in their walk with the lord they've been slow or sluggish as paul said dull of hearing and they need to be taught the same things that they already learned again which paul says they have need of milk and not of strong meat so milk christianity is someone who gets saved but then doesn't grow in their knowledge and understanding of the gospel of the lord jesus christ this is something to consider how many believers today really understand the faith and could teach sinners about how to repent be sanctified and be filled with the holy ghost in hebrews 5 13 it says for everyone that uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is a babe the word unskillful means inexperienced in other words christians can have an initial experience with repentance but they must have more experiences with god they must grow in their faith they must mature and experience god in new ways in other words they must be justified and then experience sanctification as well if not paul says they're a babe they're just a baby christian and then verse 14 gives us a beautiful text but strong meat belongs to them that are of full age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil so here paul tells us those that are full age mature christians eat strong meat or listen to meaty sermons and then he tells us what these sermons consist of they consist of preaching that helps them discern both good and evil so milk sermons are more general sermons about jesus and christianity in general terms but meaty sermons help a christian discern good and evil in their daily lives and the bible says their senses are exercised to discern now the word exercise in the greek means to exercise vigorously in any way either the body or the mind the word use means a habit whether of the body or mind and so christians that eat strong meat have made it a habit to daily discern good and evil in their lives mature christians daily exercise their discernment to be able to judge and detect if something is good or evil if this is a good influence in their life or a bad influence in their life so based upon these beautiful scriptures so far we can see someone who is justified can only hear milk preaching general sermons about christianity but as a christian becomes sanctified he needs more mature sermons sermons that will help him to see good and evil in his daily life and of course repent of the evil and cleave to the good this means the more mature christians will be able to discern good and evil in their lives and as god's prophet brother branham said the closer we get to the light the more we see our imperfections in blind bartimaeus 1957 brother branham said speaking of daniel curry quote and it began to get lighter lighter lighter no certain place it was coming from and he began to slow up and said then all of a sudden he came to a stop and there was the brightest light he had ever seen in all his life it was a thousand times brighter than the midday sun and he said he heard a voice saying daniel curry did you ever steal anything when you were on earth you were here at my judgment seat and he said i thought i'd been a honest man but said in the presence of that light i realized that there were some things i had pulled little shady deals i didn't think about it when i was on earth but in the presence of that light he said then he said yes lord i have stole end quote how are you rising god the more sinful the whole thing looks and then sometimes in prayer you can imagine when the holy spirit take you up into a sphere then the whole thing looks chaos then when you come back down you seem like you're to the people you're a rascal that's your you're nothing but an old sarcastic but when we come here we are here for one pacific purpose this is the house of correction this is the throne this is the throne of god and judgment goes forth from the house of god and here's where we come together get in love with one another as only christians can't love but in here we are we are under a uh a leadership of the holy spirit the holy ghost is among us and we're here to be to take awakening among us to see where our short places are or shortcomings and how can we catch from where we should be over to where we ought to be now where we are where we ought to be and that's what we study ministers study those places for other people when they see the people they laugh then they begin all that as we grow as christians and become more like christ the more our character is shaped into the character of christ the brighter the light of god shines upon our daily lives and we see our great need to grow in righteousness and godliness as even saint paul said o wretched men that i am who shall deliver me from this body of death but thanks be to god who gives us the victory through our lord jesus christ we never want to become complacent as christians we don't want to be baby christians we want to receive the word that we need for this season of our life whether we're a new christian and we need the milk of the word or if we're an experienced christian and we become dull of hearing and we need to go back and relearn the things we've already learned in order that we can grow and mature and be able to receive the deeper teachings of god's word the six doctrines that are needed for a justified christian and a sanctified christian moving on to hebrews chapter 6 verse 1 says therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of christ let us go on unto perfection in the greek the word perfection means one who has in his own person raised faith to its perfection and so set before us the highest example of faith so this is speaking of christian maturity let us go on unto christian maturity and notice then paul lists six doctrines that are principle or elementary or beginning doctrines that we must master first is repentance from dead works second and of faith toward god in verse two third of the doctrine of baptisms fourth and of the laying on of hands fifth and of the resurrection of the dead and sixth of eternal judgment then verse three says and this we will do if god permit so god must permit or allow us to move on from milk to meat and of course god will allow this if we obey him and the current word he's revealing to us at this particular time of our lives if we're faithful with the word he's bringing to us now then no doubt he'll permit us to move on to the next word that we need to receive the more mature word that we need to grow by let's look at the first doctrine which is repentance from dead works friends i can hardly emphasize the importance of this first doctrine repentance from dead works is the first step to becoming a christian this should remind us of acts 2 verse 38 which says repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ it's beautiful to see the continuity of the scripture peter in acts 2 38 gives us the first step repentance which is here the first step paul gives us in hebrews chapter 6 it is also the first sermon john the baptist preached and jesus preached for the scripture says they preached first repentance for the kingdom of heaven was at hand according to matthew 3 verses 1 and 2 for john the baptist matthew 4 verse 17 for jesus because the scripture says from that time jesus began to preach and say repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand this repentance from dead works is so crucial for a christian to grow out of justification and into sanctification saint paul calls dead works works of the flesh and he speaks of 16 of them in first corinthians 6 verses 9 and 10 and galatians 5 verses 19 through 21 i'm going to quickly name them and define them so you will know how important is for christians to repent from dead works the first is effeminate which is child molestation the second is abusers of themselves with mankind which are sodomites and homosexuals third are covetousness and envy which is greedy gain eager to have more what belongs to others fourth is drunkards becoming intoxicated by any form of alcohol fifth is revilers a which is a complainer or someone who protests rashly next is uncleanness which is lustful and luxurious living needing the fanciest clothes the best cars the best electronics next is lashiviousness which is unbridled excess it's lust without any sense of shame or lawlessness next is witchcraft which is which is sorcery or magical satanic arts poisoning and the administration of drugs of course drug use is a huge problem in this society the next is hatred which is enmity or intense dislike or ill will the tenth one is variance which is contention heated disagreements maintained in arguments the eleventh is emulation which is fierce jealousy rivalry pursued twelfth is wrath passionate anger boiling up 13th is strife a desire to put oneself forward electioneering for some position and friends all these definitions are from the greek lexicon 14th is seditions which are dissentions and divisions fifteenth are heresies teaching your own tenants opinions for followers and sixteenth is revelings which are nocturnal riotous frolicsome loud parties that go late into the night friends consider this list of 16 sins how many christians do you know that repent from all these dead works in first corinthians 6 and galatians 5 paul says those who commit these sins cannot inherit the kingdom of god in other words if we don't repent from these dead works we'll never be born again by the baptism of the holy ghost into the kingdom of god because jesus said the kingdom of god is within you in luke chapter 17. before we move on to the second doctrine consider how many churches teach repentance from dead works and do they teach repentance from all 16 of those dead works perhaps there could be even more dead works it'd be a lengthy study to see if there were even more dead works than what i just listed out of those 16 consider jesus said few that would find the narrow road so based upon jesus's words and paul's words few christians will be meek christians most will be milk christians accepting salvation and reaching the first step of grace which is justification by faith they'll have faith in the blood of jesus christ of faith in the gospel the good news of salvation through our lord jesus christ but how many will move on deeper in the christian faith into full sanctification and then into the baptism of the holy ghost it's quite a sobering thought the second doctrine is faith toward god in the greek faith means assurance so christians after being taught to repent should be taught to have assurance in god of course that means his written word and also a spoken word which you might receive through a dream a vision or some other spiritual gift but the main thought here is to have faith toward god assurance in god and not to put your hope or trust in money or riches as jesus said you can only serve one master god or mammon which is riches how many christians mature enough where their faith is not in their job but their faith is in god himself and his holy word the third doctrine is the doctrine of baptisms according to my studies there's at least three kinds of baptisms first there's water baptism which should be administered by speaking the full name of god which is the lord jesus christ there are very few churches that teach this so again this shows how very few christians will move on out of milk christianity and to meet christianity the second baptism is the baptism of the holy spirit in the human mind or spirit this is the spirit filling that old testament saints had before jesus christ died and resurrected and also includes saints like elizabeth zacharias and john the baptist recorded in the gospels john chapter 7 verses 37 through 39 say the holy ghost could not be given until after jesus christ was glorified which they received on the day of pentecost in acts chapter 2. so that means every person who was filled with the spirit before acts chapter 2 had the filling or baptism of the spirit in the human mind and not the human soul the third type of baptism then is the baptism of the holy ghost and the soul of the believer this is what jesus came to give us according to matthew chapter 11 he said i'm going to give you rest unto your souls so this is the baptism or rest that they did not have in the old testament again it's obvious most churches do not understand the three kinds of baptisms so we can again see how very few people will move on past justification into the meteor subjects of god's word into sanctification and then into the baptism of the holy ghost for example a lot of pentecostal churches basically teach speaking in tongues is the baptism of the holy spirit and it's the only baptism you need well the true understanding of god's word is that speaking in tongues is a gift of god and not all speak with tongues but being filled with the spirit to speak in tongues most often happens in the human spirit which would be an anointing in the human mind and not the soul but of course i do believe it is possible to be baptized with the holy ghost in the soul and speak in tongues like they did on the day of pentecost in acts chapter 2. but if that would happen we would believe there would be an interpretation for those unknown tongues just like there was on the day of pentecost the fourth doctrine is the laying on of hands so there's three aspects to laying on of hands first is laying on hands for divine healing second is laying on of hands for ordination and third is laying on of hands in violence there's a laying on of hands for divine healing as taught in mark chapter 16 jesus said lay hands on the sick and they shall recover some churches believe in this doctrine others do not it's a shame if a church doesn't believe in that because jesus promised that believers would have this sign they would lay hands on the sick and they would recover laying on of hands in violence is spoken of in first timothy 5 22 paul said lay hands suddenly on no man neither be partaker of other men's sins keep thyself pure so in context paul is saying don't be a partaker of other men's sins so sometimes men sin when they lay hands on others to hurt them or beat them or abuse them of course abuse in all forms is wrong all the time and abuse is a sign of demonic possession the other kind of laying on of hands is for ordaining elders as spoken of in first timothy 4 14 paul said neglect not the gift that is in thee which was given thee by prophecy with the laying on of hands of the presbytery so this is speaking of ordaining ministers to preach the gospel and the main idea here is that before you lay hands on someone to ordain them a minister they must meet the qualifications of a minister which paul gave in the previous chapter first timothy chapter 3 verses 1 through 7. before a man can be a minister he has to rule his house well by the word of god keeping he and himself and his family in subjection to the word of god he cannot be a novice or a young christian and he should be an example of the faith to the believers and then once he displays all these attributes and meets all the qualifications then hand should be laid upon him and ordain him as a minister of the gospel so concerning the laying on of hands milk christians will miss out on the power of laying hands on the sick and seeing them recover no christians might also make the mistake of ordaining someone before they should be ordained in other words laying their hands on someone and ordaining them when they're not qualified to serve as a minister and then they might also make the mistake of laying hands on someone and mistreating them which again would be an awful mistake the fifth doctrine is resurrection of the dead now this is important because there are two kinds of resurrections for two different kinds of christians i have a video about this on my youtube channel if you'd like to learn more about this subject but clearly it's a subject a lot of people don't understand most people think there's only one resurrection but there's actually two revelation chapter 20 verses five and six speak of the first resurrection and this is the resurrection where the holy ghost feel christians over the last two thousand years and the old testament saints will live and reign with christ for a thousand years during the millennium this resurrection begins with the rapture of the gentile church which is the next major event that we're waiting to take place and this will take place before the tribulation sets in the second resurrection is where all men are brought to the great white throne judgment jesus speaks of this in john 5 verse 29 he said and shall come forth they that have done good unto the resurrection of life and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of damnation so this second resurrection takes place after the thousand-year millennium and after the battle of gog and magog in which satan is cast in the lake of fire and then you have the great white throne judgment every person who ever lived at any time of human history will be resurrected to this resurrection and they'll be separated in one of two places either on the right hand as sheep or in the left hand as goats the sheep will be saved the goats will be lost the importance of understanding both resurrections is that we should live for the high calling of god in other words we should live to be a part of the first resurrection and the bible says to do that you must be blessed and holy for revelation 20 verse 6 said blessed and holy is he that hath part in this first resurrection so milk christians will fail to understand the scriptures that encourage us to be diligent faithful christians peter twice said to give all diligence to make our calling and election sure but milk christians are more lazy about their walk with god they don't show a lot of diligence they don't form the right habits that christians should form they do not press toward the mark of the high calling of god in christ jesus they're content living a foolish life as paul said in ephesians chapter 5 they don't walk circumspectly or exactly they kind of wander through life and they reject the perfect will of god by neglecting the baptism of the holy ghost which makes them foolish virgins as jesus talked about in the parables of the ten virgins five are wise five are foolish and the sixth doctrine is eternal judgment so in this doctrine we learn that god's judgment upon each and every soul will last eternally but of course the punishment does not because there is no such thing as an eternal hell that is because a sinner does not have eternal life and therefore cannot live eternally sinners may be punished for hundreds or maybe thousands or millions of years but at some point they will cease to exist first john 3 verse 15 proves this it says whosoever hateth his brother is a murder and you know that no murder hath eternal life abiding in him i have two videos about how hell is not eternal if you'd like to watch those i think they'd be a blessing to you so again god's judgments upon each and every human and also angel will last eternally but scripture tells us satan will cease to exist at some point ezekiel 28 verse 19 tells us that it says thou shalt be a terror and never shalt thou be any more satan has an ending point at some point he will cease to exist he shall not be any more and so will every other demon that he deceived among the third of the angels that he caused to leave their holy estate and join his power of darkness and so it is with every human sinner every human sinner who's a goat who's ultimately rejected by god because he or she rejected god during this life they rejected the grace of god at some point he or she will cease to exist they cannot burn eternally because they do not have eternal life and god is not an unjust judge god would not punish someone eternally for rejecting his word for only a few decades or so that concludes the six doctrines and notice hebrews 6 3 says and this we will do if god permit so again if a christian will humble himself and be taught to repent from dead works that first doctrine then that christian can move on to faith toward god and then the doctrine of baptisms laying on of hands resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment if a christian learns all these and receives god's truth and grows past justification into sanctification and surely god will permit them to go into perfection which is the baptism of the holy ghost or charity in the soul of the believer in closing i hope this video has been a help to you friends the inspiration of god struck me while i was preaching this and i saw how it connected to the three works of grace so i hope it's a help to you in your christian journey as i'm sure it's your desire to be a mature christian and so i close with that question which food are you in need of milk or meat for some of our viewers you've been feeding on the meat for years you're growing in grace and knowledge of god your heart is constantly on fire for more of the holy ghost and more discernment to recognize good and evil in your daily life to keep the evil out and to continue doing good for the glory of our lord jesus christ other viewers you might have been believers for a number of years but maybe you realize i've become a milk christian i need to go back and learn the elementary teachings again i've forgotten the things that the holy spirit once taught me i've been distracted my mind has been on the cares of the world and other things the thing to do is repent and turn to jesus christ do that first doctrine repentance from dead works search your heart and life see if any of those 16 sins that i listed earlier apply to you and then you can repent of those and bring forth fruits meet for repentance as john the baptist told us friends may we press on toward the mark of the high calling of god in christ jesus being justified sanctified and baptized with the holy ghost if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me god bless you and may jesus christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
