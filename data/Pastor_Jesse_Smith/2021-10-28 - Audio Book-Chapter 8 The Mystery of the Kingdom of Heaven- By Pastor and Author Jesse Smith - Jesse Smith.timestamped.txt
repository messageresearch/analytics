[0:00] chapter 8 the mystery of the kingdom of
[0:02] heaven
[0:04] chapter 8 contains footnotes numbers
[0:06] 1167-1453
[0:11] he answered and said unto them because
[0:13] it is given unto you to know the
[0:15] mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but
[0:17] to them it is not given
[0:19] matthew 13 verse 11
[0:22] in the four gospels of matthew mark luke
[0:24] and john jesus teaches 16 parable
[0:27] mysteries related to the kingdom of
[0:29] heaven
[0:30] knowing the meaning of each parable
[0:32] gives you a complete understanding
[0:34] of god's new testament kingdom
[0:36] you are able to see your individual role
[0:38] in god's kingdom the kingdom's enemies
[0:41] and also how the kingdom continues until
[0:43] the consummation of human history
[0:47] to begin with the kingdom of heaven is
[0:48] not a physical kingdom on earth but a
[0:51] spiritual one
[0:52] at this moment the kingdoms of this
[0:54] world like russia the united states and
[0:57] china are not the kingdoms of our lord
[0:59] jesus christ but one day they will be
[1:03] jesus tells us the location of the
[1:05] kingdom of heaven in luke 17 verse 21
[1:08] behold the kingdom of god is within you
[1:11] god's kingdom or dominion or rule in the
[1:14] greek lexicon
[1:16] is inside the soul of the believer as
[1:19] the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:21] see chapter 6
[1:22] paul teaches when a person is born again
[1:25] he is translated into the kingdom of his
[1:27] dear son
[1:30] this means the kingdom of heaven first
[1:31] came into believer's souls on the day of
[1:34] pentecost
[1:35] previous to pentecost the kingdom of
[1:37] heaven was at hand but not yet in
[1:40] believer's souls according to matthew
[1:42] chapter 3 verses 1 and 2
[1:45] in those days came john the baptist
[1:47] preaching in the wilderness of judea and
[1:49] saying repent ye for the kingdom of
[1:51] heaven is at hand
[1:53] jesus preached the same truth in matthew
[1:55] 4 verse 17.
[1:57] repent for the kingdom of heaven is at
[1:59] hand
[2:02] since the holy ghost has been pouring
[2:04] out for nearly 2 000 years jesus has
[2:07] wisely designed for born-again
[2:09] christians
[2:10] to rule and reign in the kingdom of
[2:11] heaven while living in the earthly
[2:13] kingdoms of men
[2:15] satan is our opponent and we are
[2:17] promised victory because the god of
[2:19] peace shall bruise satan under your feet
[2:22] shortly
[2:23] satan is the main influence behind every
[2:26] earthly kingdom
[2:27] as jesus teaches satan as a kingdom once
[2:30] granted permission by god satan has
[2:32] power to give earthly kingdoms to those
[2:34] he chooses but god's kingdom is greater
[2:37] in every way
[2:39] god has equipped us to defeat satan's
[2:41] spiritual kingdom and influence
[2:44] believers are fully armored soldiers
[2:46] wrestling not against flesh and blood
[2:48] but against principalities against
[2:50] powers against the rulers of the
[2:52] darkness of this world against spiritual
[2:55] wickedness in high places
[2:57] christians war spiritually against the
[2:59] wicked influences of every earthly
[3:02] kingdom and are victorious
[3:04] more than conquerors through him that
[3:06] loved us
[3:08] take heed to your heavenly father's
[3:10] invitation to be part of his eternal
[3:12] kingdom first thessalonians 2 verse 12
[3:15] says that we should walk worthy of god
[3:17] who hath called you unto his kingdom and
[3:20] glory
[3:22] the confusion about the mystery of the
[3:24] kingdom of heaven
[3:26] to begin with there is no confusion that
[3:28] jesus's 16 parable mysteries are from
[3:31] god as jesus said he spoke only what the
[3:33] father taught him
[3:35] it is also widely understood that the
[3:37] parables are natural witnesses of the
[3:39] spiritual world
[3:40] for example knowing how to bake bread or
[3:43] plant a mustard seed does not make a
[3:45] person worthy of eternal life
[3:48] the confusion about the kingdom of
[3:50] heaven is about how to interpret the
[3:52] parables
[3:53] should they be applied directly to our
[3:55] lives today
[3:56] if so how far should they be applied
[3:59] in our politically correct society
[4:01] should the children of the kingdom and
[4:03] the children of the wicked one be
[4:04] identified
[4:06] can the woman hiding leaven in bread be
[4:08] identified
[4:09] should christians warn people about the
[4:11] furnace of fire
[4:13] and wailing and gnashing of teeth that
[4:15] await those who offend god's kingdom and
[4:17] work iniquity
[4:18] the answer to all these questions is yes
[4:20] and the parable should be applied as far
[4:22] as god intended to the very soul of
[4:25] every man
[4:27] the revelation of the kingdom of heaven
[4:29] is those who understand the kingdom's
[4:31] purpose extent and organization and give
[4:35] christ dominion in their earthly lives
[4:37] will be the ones who rule with christ in
[4:39] his future dominion
[4:43] biblical evidence for the revelation of
[4:44] the mystery of the kingdom of heaven
[4:47] the sixteen parable mysteries completely
[4:49] reveal the mystery of the kingdom of
[4:51] heaven when compared with the rest of
[4:53] scripture
[4:54] here are brief summaries followed by
[4:55] full biblical explanations
[4:58] one the sower and the foregrounds
[5:01] men display four heart reactions to
[5:03] hearing preaching about jesus christ
[5:06] two the wheat and tares
[5:08] each person is either a child of god or
[5:11] satan and churches are full of both
[5:14] 3 the grain of mustard seed
[5:17] the false church started small but grew
[5:19] until it was large and filled with all
[5:21] demonic powers chapter 9 reveals the
[5:24] false church
[5:25] 4 the leaven hid in three measures of
[5:28] meal
[5:29] the false church had lies in her
[5:31] teachings until her entire doctrine
[5:33] became fully corrupted
[5:35] 5 the treasure in a field
[5:38] a true believer joyfully trades all his
[5:40] possessions at the surprising
[5:42] opportunity to gain christ
[5:46] 6.
[5:47] the one pearl of great price
[5:49] a true believer abandons his search for
[5:51] many spiritual truths
[5:53] in order to gain the one most valuable
[5:55] truth christ
[5:58] seven the net cast into the sea
[6:01] at the end of the world the gospel will
[6:03] attract believers and unbelievers but
[6:05] god's angels will separate the wicked
[6:07] away from the holy
[6:09] 8 the unmerciful servant
[6:12] a person must forgive others if he
[6:14] expects god to forgive him
[6:17] 9
[6:18] the laborers in the vineyard eternal
[6:20] life is the reward god gives to all who
[6:23] labor in his kingdom
[6:25] 10 the wicked husbandman
[6:28] the kingdom was rejected by the jews and
[6:30] then given to the gentiles to bring
[6:32] forth fruit unto god
[6:34] see chapter 2
[6:36] 11 the king's son
[6:39] after most jews reject it gentile
[6:41] believers respond to god's invitation
[6:44] for the rapture and are clothed in the
[6:46] wedding garment the baptism of the holy
[6:48] ghost
[6:50] 12 the 10 virgins
[6:52] wise believers possess oil or the
[6:54] baptism of the holy ghost as they await
[6:57] their wedding day with jesus the rapture
[7:00] see chapter 12
[7:02] 13 the talents christ commits varying
[7:05] amounts of talents and resources to his
[7:08] servants and rewards those who
[7:10] faithfully invest in them
[7:12] 14 the pounds
[7:15] christ provides an equal opportunity to
[7:17] his servants and rewards those who
[7:19] faithfully act upon it
[7:22] 15 the seed cast into the ground
[7:25] god causes spiritual growth by invisible
[7:28] means but men observe it in three stages
[7:32] 16 the great supper
[7:34] after most jews made excuses to reject
[7:37] it gentiles should accept jesus's
[7:39] compelling invitation to his great
[7:41] supper the marriage supper of the lamb
[7:45] parable 1 the sower and the foregrounds
[7:49] revelation men display four heart
[7:51] reactions to hearing preaching about
[7:54] jesus christ
[7:55] found in matthew 13 verses 3 through 9
[7:58] and verses 18 through 23 this first
[8:01] revelation begins on the individual
[8:03] level
[8:04] and is interpreted by christ himself
[8:07] men can have only one of four reactions
[8:10] after hearing preaching about jesus
[8:11] christ
[8:12] as the parable details four types of
[8:14] ground that seed falls upon
[8:17] seed symbolizes god's word there will be
[8:20] no excuses on the day of judgment each
[8:22] type of ground receives seed
[8:24] each heart received the word
[8:26] each person has to ask the same question
[8:28] pontius pilate infamously asked when he
[8:31] stated what shall i do then with jesus
[8:33] which is called christ
[8:35] god is watching what you do with the
[8:37] word you have heard
[8:40] the first ground or heart is called the
[8:42] wayside representing a heart that hears
[8:44] the word of god but does not understand
[8:47] it files representing satan the wicked
[8:50] one snatch away god's word from the
[8:52] person's heart these files play an
[8:55] important role later in the third
[8:56] parable this heart immediately rejects
[8:59] god's word thus not believing and
[9:01] ultimately not saved
[9:03] jesus says that most people fall into
[9:06] this category declaring there are few
[9:08] that are saved
[9:10] the second ground is another sad heart
[9:12] condition called the stony places
[9:15] this kind of person rejoices over the
[9:17] word for a season and he can for a while
[9:20] believe but then rejects the truth due
[9:23] to tribulation or persecution
[9:26] the rejection occurs because there is no
[9:28] root in himself
[9:29] meaning no deep genuine love for christ
[9:32] as paul says christians are rooted and
[9:34] grounded in love
[9:36] jesus says this experience starts
[9:38] excitedly lasting longer than the
[9:40] wayside but then slowly withers away
[9:44] psalm 1 verse 3 says the godly have
[9:46] leaves that shall not wither
[9:48] real christian love does not wither away
[9:51] jew describes apostates as clouds
[9:53] without water and trees whose fruit
[9:56] withereth
[9:57] clearly the stony place's heart is
[9:59] apostate and lost just as the wayside
[10:02] heart
[10:04] the third ground can be called thorny
[10:06] because it receives the seed but then
[10:08] thorns spring up and choke it making the
[10:11] plant unfruitful
[10:13] this third heart hears the word but then
[10:15] chooses to care for the world riches and
[10:17] pleasures more than christ
[10:20] although this heart lasted much longer
[10:21] than the previous two
[10:23] it still missed the ultimate goal of
[10:24] christianity fruitfulness what good is
[10:27] an apple tree if it doesn't bring forth
[10:29] its fruit
[10:30] jesus wants christians to bring forth
[10:32] their fruits to serve their god-ordained
[10:34] purposes
[10:36] the rare and precious fruit of the
[10:37] spirit is love joy peace longsuffering
[10:41] gentleness goodness faith meekness and
[10:44] temperance jesus said he chose the
[10:47] disciples to go and bring forth fruit
[10:49] and that your fruit should remain
[10:51] paul warns all christians that riches
[10:54] can cause believers to fall into
[10:55] temptations snares and into many foolish
[10:59] and hurtful lusts
[11:00] which drown men in destruction and
[11:02] perdition
[11:04] his advice to timothy a man of god is to
[11:06] flee these things and follow after
[11:08] righteousness godliness faith love
[11:12] patience and meekness paul in his second
[11:14] letter to timothy prophesied that men in
[11:17] the last days will be lovers of
[11:19] pleasures more than lovers of god
[11:21] after reading this you might think it's
[11:24] impossible for the unfruitful heart to
[11:26] be saved but i will soon show much bible
[11:28] evidence that salvation is possible for
[11:31] this heart although the reward will be
[11:33] little to nothing examples include lot
[11:36] and the repentant thief on the cross
[11:38] paul says a man can be saved but suffer
[11:40] loss of reward
[11:43] the fourth and final ground is good
[11:45] ground that brings forth fruit in one of
[11:47] three quantities thirtyfold sixtyfold or
[11:51] a hundredfold
[11:52] jesus interprets this ground as an
[11:54] honest and good heart
[11:56] having heard the word keep it and bring
[11:59] forth fruit with patience
[12:00] if you are an honest hearted christian
[12:02] you will produce the nine fruits of the
[12:04] spirit because you are honest about your
[12:06] spiritual condition you won't let money
[12:09] riches or pleasures choke your love for
[12:11] god's word as you love god with all your
[12:14] heart soul mind and strength you will
[12:17] hate even one sin stain upon your
[12:19] spiritual life
[12:21] james says pure religion is keeping
[12:22] yourself unspotted from the world
[12:25] you won't let one evil root of
[12:26] bitterness spring up and trouble your
[12:29] heart because you are completely focused
[12:31] on seeing an abundant harvest for the
[12:33] lord's glory
[12:36] genesis to revelation teaches this
[12:38] biblical revelation of four heart
[12:40] reactions
[12:41] or heart conditions see figure 21
[12:44] genesis gives four kinds of heart
[12:46] reactions to god's revelation in
[12:49] abraham's day
[12:50] abraham's heart was good ground for he
[12:52] was the friend of god and father of
[12:54] faith living a fully devoted and
[12:57] separated life
[12:58] abraham and sarah brought forth isaac as
[13:00] fruit of their union and spiritual
[13:02] devotion
[13:04] lot's heart was thorny because although
[13:06] he was just and righteous he erroneously
[13:08] led his family into residing in sodom
[13:11] causing him and his family daily torment
[13:14] there was no real fruit to lot's
[13:15] ministry efforts in sodom just as the
[13:18] thorny ground was unfruitful
[13:20] lot's wife represents the stony ground
[13:22] because jesus identifies her as one
[13:25] whose heart and eyes turn back to sodom
[13:28] due to her love for it causing her to
[13:30] lose her life
[13:32] the sodomites represent wayside hearts
[13:35] for the mob at lot's house
[13:37] heard him call their homosexuality
[13:39] wickedness but then satan immediately
[13:41] snatched the seed words from their
[13:43] hearts
[13:44] the mob felt judged and were planning on
[13:47] physically violating a lot until he was
[13:49] saved by the angels
[13:51] these were all destroyed with fire and
[13:53] brimstone shortly after the angels
[13:55] pulled lot and his two daughters out of
[13:57] the city
[13:59] jesus crucifixion exposes these four
[14:02] hearts
[14:03] most people think of only three crosses
[14:05] on golgotha
[14:06] but there was a fourth cross or tree not
[14:09] far away
[14:10] judas iscariot's tree
[14:12] jesus heart represents the good ground
[14:14] for he always did that which pleased the
[14:16] father and there was so much fruit to
[14:18] his life that john supposed that even
[14:20] the world itself could not contain the
[14:22] books that should be written about him
[14:25] the saved thief who was promised
[14:26] paradise by christ symbolizes the thorny
[14:29] ground for his life was fruitless
[14:32] in fact the save thief was mocking
[14:34] christ with the others shortly before
[14:36] his change of heart as matthew 27 44
[14:39] says
[14:40] the thieves also which were crucified
[14:42] with him cast the same in his teeth
[14:45] judas iscariot's heart was the stony
[14:47] ground for he served christ for a season
[14:50] even witnessing countless miracles
[14:53] before withering away and ending in
[14:55] apostasy betrayal and hell
[14:58] the lost thief's heart was the wayside
[15:01] for he railed against jesus until the
[15:03] end without any fear of god
[15:07] paul described the four hearts as four
[15:09] different kinds of vessels
[15:10] gold silver wood and earth
[15:14] the gold represents the good ground and
[15:16] the silver symbolizes the thorny ground
[15:18] wood represents the stony side heart and
[15:21] earth symbolizes the wayside heart gold
[15:24] and silver vessels are honorable and
[15:26] thus can be used by the master for good
[15:28] works
[15:29] obviously gold is more valuable useful
[15:32] or better than silver just as the
[15:34] prophet samuel told saul that david was
[15:36] better than he
[15:37] god saw david's life was more useful
[15:39] than saul's
[15:40] because of david's pure heart
[15:42] the wood and earth are dishonorable
[15:44] disposable vessels showing again that
[15:47] two hearts are saved and two were lost
[15:50] paul was an honorable vessel for jesus
[15:53] literally called him a chosen vessel to
[15:55] bear his name to the gentiles
[15:57] kings and israel the egyptian ruler
[16:00] pharaoh was a vessel of dishonor for
[16:02] paul said god raised pharaoh up as a
[16:04] vessel of wrath fitted for destruction
[16:07] proverbs 16 verse 4 also says the lord
[16:10] hath made all things for himself yea
[16:13] even the wicked for the day of evil
[16:16] revelation 22 verse 11 lists the four
[16:19] conditions every person will end up in
[16:21] at jesus's second coming
[16:23] holy righteous filthy and unjust
[16:27] the holy condition represents the good
[16:29] ground while the righteous represents
[16:32] the thorny ground
[16:33] the filthy condition represents the
[16:35] stony ground
[16:36] and the unjust condition is the wayside
[16:39] ground
[16:40] the holy and righteous hearts will be
[16:42] saved while the filthy and unjust will
[16:44] be lost
[16:46] please take a few moments to meditate
[16:48] upon the revelation of the sower and the
[16:50] foregrounds that it may be applied to
[16:52] your soul
[16:53] you may want to fall to your knees in
[16:55] sincere prayer to jesus christ your high
[16:58] priest
[16:59] and ask him to show you which heart
[17:00] condition you have cultivated thus far
[17:03] in your life
[17:04] which ground does your heart resemble
[17:06] is the ground of your heart good honest
[17:09] and producing much fruit
[17:11] or is it thorny because you have let
[17:13] love of pleasures and riches choke the
[17:15] growth of god's word in your life if so
[17:18] the remedy is to let jesus's holy spirit
[17:21] the master gardener weed out the cares
[17:24] of the world and ungodly habits from
[17:26] your heart and life
[17:28] is your ground like the stony ground and
[17:30] you have left christianity after
[17:32] believing for a season
[17:34] if so return to christ and repent of all
[17:36] your transgressions that god's word will
[17:39] have a deep love to be planted in
[17:42] lastly if your heart is the wayside
[17:44] ground and you have never followed
[17:46] christ won't you repent of your sins now
[17:48] and be baptized in jesus christ's name
[17:51] won't you lose your sinful life and gain
[17:53] eternal life
[17:56] parable 2 the we in tares
[17:59] revelation
[18:00] each person is either a child of god or
[18:03] satan and the churches are full of both
[18:06] found in matthew 13 verses 24 through 30
[18:09] and verses 36 through 43 the second
[18:12] revelation is again interpreted by
[18:14] christ
[18:15] here the good seed is not the word
[18:17] itself as in the first parable but is
[18:19] the product of the word preached the
[18:21] children of god
[18:24] jesus teaches there will be both wheat
[18:26] god's children
[18:27] and tares satan's children in the world
[18:30] until the end time
[18:32] god's children originate from jesus the
[18:34] son of man the sower who first sowed
[18:36] good seeds or believers in the world or
[18:39] field the devil is the enemy who came in
[18:42] afterwards and sowed tares or
[18:44] unbelievers
[18:46] at harvest time or the end of the world
[18:48] the angels will come to separate
[18:50] unbelievers for their fire judgment
[18:53] afterwards the righteous wheat will
[18:55] shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of
[18:58] their father
[19:00] this parable's timeline is from the
[19:02] beginning of jesus's earthly ministry to
[19:04] the end of the times of the gentiles or
[19:07] end of the church ages which is yet in
[19:09] the future
[19:10] jesus said he the son of man sowed the
[19:13] good seed during jesus's earthly
[19:15] ministry he either called himself or was
[19:18] called son of man eighty times
[19:20] in matthew 13 24 the son of man went
[19:24] sowing first which was jesus's three and
[19:26] a half year earthly ministry
[19:28] jesus's preaching and healing ministry
[19:30] caused many to believe the gospel such
[19:32] as the many samaritans in the city that
[19:35] believed jesus was the christ the savior
[19:37] of the world
[19:38] but eventually all the early believers
[19:41] such as peter james john and paul died
[19:44] as matthew 13 25 says while men slept
[19:49] as the early apostles started sleeping
[19:51] or dying satan began sowing his tares or
[19:54] children among the believers as
[19:56] scripture details
[19:58] around 60 a.d paul cried for three
[20:01] straight years warning the ephesians
[20:03] that wolves or false teachers would
[20:05] enter into their assembly not sparing
[20:08] the flock
[20:09] about six years later jude said evil men
[20:11] would pervert grace by making it
[20:13] leschiviousness or a license for
[20:15] immorality around 90 a.d john wrote that
[20:19] there were already many antichrists
[20:21] working deception in the churches
[20:24] the tares or children of the wicked one
[20:27] are impersonators of the wheat or
[20:29] children of the kingdom
[20:30] physical tears are darnell weeds which
[20:33] are nearly identical in appearance to
[20:35] wheat
[20:36] explaining why jesus commanded that both
[20:38] wheat and tear grow together until the
[20:40] harvest so that wheat would not be
[20:42] uprooted with the terror
[20:44] to the human eye it's nearly impossible
[20:46] to distinguish between the wheat and
[20:48] tare so christ assigns the angels to
[20:51] separate them at the end of the world
[20:54] spiritual tares are impersonators of
[20:56] christianity great in number and sitting
[20:59] in every church looking and acting
[21:01] nearly identical to spiritual wheat
[21:05] tares appear to be twins of the wheat
[21:07] but they are not true wheat the bible is
[21:09] filled with twins or wheat entire
[21:11] examples
[21:13] cain and abel balaam and moses and judas
[21:16] and jesus
[21:17] the only way to know which of the twins
[21:19] is the true believer is to observe which
[21:21] one obeys the word as cain was
[21:23] instructed to obey but rejected god's
[21:26] will
[21:27] just as terrors resemble wheat these men
[21:29] all had a parallel spiritual life balaam
[21:32] and moses were both known prophets judas
[21:35] and jesus ministered together and both
[21:37] performed miracles
[21:40] one reason terrors are extremely
[21:41] deceptive is because they can honor and
[21:44] worship god enough to see the holy
[21:46] spirit supernaturally move in their
[21:48] services
[21:49] jesus said no man that speaks lightly of
[21:51] him can do a miracle in his name
[21:53] proving that tares will speak honorably
[21:55] of jesus in order to work under his
[21:57] anointing
[21:58] but afterwards their tares will work
[22:00] iniquity engaging in lustful lifestyles
[22:04] as jesus taught in matthew 7 verses
[22:06] 21-23
[22:08] not everyone that saith unto me lord
[22:10] lord shall enter into the kingdom of
[22:12] heaven but he that doeth the will of my
[22:14] father which is in heaven
[22:16] many will say to me in that day lord
[22:18] lord have we not prophesied in thy name
[22:21] and in thy name have cast out devils
[22:23] and in thy name have done wonderful
[22:25] works
[22:26] and then will i profess unto them i
[22:28] never knew you depart from me ye that
[22:30] work iniquity
[22:33] paul speaks of tares describing their
[22:35] sinful characteristics in these last
[22:37] days
[22:38] saying tares are lovers of their own
[22:40] selves covetous boasters proud
[22:44] blasphemers disobedient to parents
[22:46] unthankful unholy without natural
[22:49] affection truce breakers false accusers
[22:53] incontinent fierce despisers of those
[22:56] that are good traitors heady high-minded
[22:59] lovers of pleasures more than lovers of
[23:01] god
[23:02] the apostle says they have a form or
[23:04] resemblance of godliness but all deny
[23:07] the power of god
[23:08] that produces genuine godliness tares do
[23:11] some good works but harbor wicked
[23:13] selfish hearts putting on a public
[23:15] church membership act
[23:17] true christians let god's power purify
[23:20] and sanctify them wholly because they
[23:23] want to see jesus face to face and have
[23:25] a body just like his
[23:28] just as a physical tear causes sickness
[23:31] a spiritual tare's unholy life nauseates
[23:34] a true believer the greek lexicon says
[23:36] darnell grains if eaten produce
[23:39] convulsions and even death
[23:41] jesus described the spiritual condition
[23:43] in the letter to the laodiceans saying a
[23:46] lukewarm tear with lukewarm works would
[23:49] be spewed out of his mouth because he
[23:51] claimed to be upright but instead was
[23:53] miserable wretched blind and naked
[23:57] witnessing a compromising unfaithful
[23:59] undisciplined spiritual life makes both
[24:02] jesus and christians sick to their
[24:04] stomachs
[24:06] at harvest time the end of the world the
[24:09] tares will be gathered and bound first
[24:11] before the wheat
[24:12] this prophetic detail lets us know that
[24:14] the impersonators of christianity will
[24:17] unite in an economical council before
[24:19] the rapture or catching away of the
[24:21] gentile bride of christ
[24:23] chapter 12 details the rapture mystery
[24:26] this gathering is manifestly declared in
[24:29] the pope's 2016 call for unity and love
[24:32] falsely claiming that jews christians
[24:35] muslims and buddhists are all children
[24:37] of god
[24:38] with all due respect the pope is wrong
[24:41] the only way to be a child of god is by
[24:43] faith in christ jesus so religions that
[24:45] deny faith in christ like muslims and
[24:48] buddhists are not god's weak children
[24:51] the binding time is upon us as the
[24:53] terror churches or children of the
[24:55] mother harlot the roman catholic church
[24:58] and those who commit spiritual adultery
[25:00] with them will soon be bound in their
[25:02] money-centered ecumenical council in
[25:05] preparation for their burning as
[25:07] foretold in revelation 2 verses 22 and
[25:10] 23 and revelation 13 verses 14 14-18
[25:15] although christians cannot always
[25:17] identify individual terrors
[25:19] nor is it our desire to we can identify
[25:22] the characteristics of the group they
[25:24] will unite with
[25:26] tares will have some good supernatural
[25:28] works by god's spirit but the majority
[25:30] of their works will be self-loving
[25:32] self-serving endeavors tares will
[25:35] ultimately desire to unite with the
[25:37] mother harlot and her daughters
[25:39] rather than with the bride of jesus
[25:41] christ and his revealed word of truth
[25:45] parable 3 the grain of mustard seed
[25:49] revelation the false church started
[25:51] small but grew until it was large and
[25:54] filled with all demonic powers
[25:56] found in matthew 13 verses 31 and 32
[26:00] this third parable has dual meanings but
[26:02] the second meaning is the revelation
[26:04] that is far more prevalent than the
[26:06] first
[26:08] the first less prevailing meaning is
[26:10] that a tiny mustard seed grain is
[26:13] likened unto faith in god's word
[26:15] jesus says faith the size of a mustard
[26:17] seed can remove mountains which in
[26:20] context
[26:21] means casting out evil spirits
[26:23] according to christ the faith seed will
[26:25] bring forth miracle fruit when doubt is
[26:28] kept out of the heart
[26:30] the confusing mysterious second meaning
[26:33] that most people do not see is the false
[26:36] church which combats the kingdom of
[26:38] heaven started by the very smallest of
[26:41] lies or false doctrines but eventually
[26:44] flourished into a massive worldwide
[26:46] habitation of devils
[26:49] in the early church's infancy god
[26:51] protected his children by purging them
[26:54] from sinful people
[26:55] and of the rest durst no man joined
[26:57] himself to them but the people magnified
[27:00] them and believers were the more added
[27:03] to the lord multitudes both of men and
[27:05] women but by 90 a.d john said there were
[27:08] many antichrists battling the saints
[27:11] fast forward 2 000 years and the false
[27:14] church is now the greatest largest group
[27:16] in the world
[27:18] who is the mustard tree the holy spirit
[27:21] helps us identify her as the roman
[27:23] catholic church
[27:25] first she unashamedly claims to be the
[27:27] mother church meaning she is the first
[27:29] false church that rejected the
[27:31] leadership of the holy ghost taking
[27:33] inspiration from the wicked one
[27:36] second this great tree is lodging birds
[27:39] which symbolize unclean spirits
[27:42] according to genesis 15 verses 10 and 11
[27:45] mark 4 verse 15 and revelation 18 verse
[27:48] 2.
[27:49] when god confirmed his unconditional
[27:51] covenant with abraham the father of
[27:53] faith had to drive away files as he
[27:56] offered sacrifices to god which
[27:58] represented evil spirits being cast out
[28:00] for satan wants to destroy true worship
[28:03] by devouring worshipers and by catching
[28:05] away the word from their hearts
[28:08] revelation 18 verse 2 is the absolute
[28:10] clearest picture of birds symbolizing
[28:13] demons for the roman church is said to
[28:15] be a habitation of devils and the hold
[28:18] of every foul spirit in a cage of every
[28:21] unclean and hateful bird
[28:24] god could not give us a more brutal
[28:26] honest and scathing description of rome
[28:28] think of it every kind of demon or bird
[28:31] lives in the roman catholic church
[28:33] system and the proof is ever before us
[28:37] in august 2018
[28:39] abuse allegations against catholic
[28:41] priests in pennsylvania made world news
[28:44] as over 300 priests abused more than 1
[28:47] 000 victims over the course of 70 years
[28:50] horrific details of abuse filled the
[28:52] grand jury report including rapes
[28:55] whippings and abortions
[28:57] in a cbs interview a mother blamed a
[28:59] priest for her son's accidental death by
[29:02] an overdose on painkillers because the
[29:05] priest repeatedly raped her son causing
[29:07] him irreparable back damage
[29:10] her son then overdosed and died
[29:12] trying to get relief from the unending
[29:14] agonizing back pain when asked how this
[29:17] abuse could happen one pennsylvania
[29:19] survivor said there's something in the
[29:21] dna of the church that encourages this
[29:25] the bible reveals the roman church's dna
[29:28] for she is the jezebel church the mother
[29:30] of harlots and abominations the cage for
[29:33] every demonic spirit and ultimately a
[29:35] spiritual child of satan priest abuse is
[29:38] not new as abuse cases have skyrocketed
[29:41] over the past three decades revealing
[29:43] thousands upon thousands of victims from
[29:46] australia 2017 dominican republic 2014
[29:51] netherlands 2011
[29:53] germany 2010 ireland 2009
[29:57] boston 2002
[29:59] austria 1999 and louisiana 1985.
[30:03] this supreme and utter wickedness was
[30:05] not done in just one state
[30:07] but viciously infected the global
[30:09] community
[30:11] shortly after the pennsylvania grand
[30:12] jury report at least 18 victims of
[30:15] sexual abuse at hands of nuns came
[30:18] forward revealing another secret plague
[30:20] in catholicism
[30:22] both priests and nuns are guilty of
[30:24] sexual immorality
[30:26] paul says child molesters or effeminate
[30:29] men shall not inherit the kingdom of god
[30:31] no doubt this would apply to pedophile
[30:34] nuns as well this relentless child rape
[30:37] epidemic proves the roman church is
[30:40] truly the habitation of devils the hold
[30:42] of every foul spirit and the cage of
[30:45] every unclean and hateful demon
[30:47] see chapter
[30:49] returning to the symbolism of fowls
[30:52] there is one bird and one only not a
[30:54] group of birds that symbolizes god's
[30:57] spirit and that is the dove
[30:59] at jesus baptism the holy ghost
[31:01] descended like a dove abode upon him and
[31:04] remained on him empowering his earthly
[31:07] ministry
[31:08] multiple birds rarely represent god's
[31:10] spirit proving the mustard tree in this
[31:12] parable is the false church the roman
[31:14] catholic church and not the true church
[31:18] data proves the roman catholic church is
[31:21] the largest so-called christian church
[31:23] in the world which gives evidence that
[31:25] she is the mustard tree that became the
[31:27] greatest among herbs the pew research
[31:30] center found that catholics make up over
[31:32] 50 percent of the global christian
[31:34] population 36 percent being protestants
[31:37] and 11 as orthodox
[31:40] with over 1.2 billion catholics in the
[31:42] ever-growing number of abuse victims
[31:45] this third parable must represent the
[31:47] roman catholic church and not the true
[31:49] church the bride of christ both jesus
[31:52] and paul prophesied that true christians
[31:54] would decrease in number in the last
[31:56] days jesus said few would find the
[31:59] narrow road to eternal life because
[32:01] iniquity not righteousness would abound
[32:04] christ also declared fewer and fewer
[32:06] souls would be saved as time passed
[32:09] saying history would be shortened in
[32:11] order that some souls might be saved
[32:14] paul said evil men and seducers shall
[32:16] wax worse and worse deceiving and being
[32:19] deceived
[32:20] our time has a great increase of
[32:22] deception causing fewer people to be
[32:24] saved
[32:27] parable 4 the leaven hid in three
[32:29] measures of meal
[32:31] revelation
[32:32] the false church hid lies in her
[32:34] teachings until her entire doctrine
[32:36] became fully corrupted
[32:39] found in matthew 13 33 this fourth
[32:42] parable speaks of a woman or church
[32:45] hiding leaven in three measures of meal
[32:47] until the bread is completely leavened
[32:50] some confuse this woman with the true
[32:51] church but the scriptural revelation is
[32:54] that this woman is the false church
[32:56] hiding lies in her teachings
[32:58] this fourth parable along with the
[33:00] second and seventh parables foretells
[33:02] complete doctrinal corruption and
[33:04] worldwide deception inside false
[33:06] churches at the end of the world rather
[33:09] than a major expansion of the true
[33:11] church
[33:12] although this parable is very short it
[33:14] contains powerful symbols
[33:17] to begin with leaven the yeast added to
[33:20] dough to make it ferment and rise always
[33:23] has a negative spiritual connotation in
[33:25] scripture
[33:26] mentioned nearly 40 times 11 represents
[33:29] sin as jesus likened leaven unto the
[33:31] pharisees false doctrine saying
[33:34] how is it that ye do not understand that
[33:36] i spake it not to you concerning bread
[33:39] that you should beware of the leaven of
[33:40] the pharisees and of the sadducees
[33:43] then understood they how that he bade
[33:45] them not beware of the leaven of bread
[33:47] but of the doctrine of the pharisees and
[33:50] of the sadducees
[33:52] paul labelled a member of the church of
[33:54] corinth as leaven amongst the brethren
[33:57] because he was committing fornication
[34:00] second meal is flour used to make cakes
[34:03] of bread which was an everyday staple
[34:05] food for israelis
[34:07] meal represents god's pure word that we
[34:10] should daily hear and obey jesus said i
[34:13] am the bread of life
[34:14] showing he the word of god is the
[34:17] believer's daily portion of spiritual
[34:19] food the meal offering in the old
[34:21] testament represented christ's cross as
[34:24] all the offerings foreshadowed his
[34:25] sacrificial work
[34:27] mission and character
[34:29] jesus even likened himself to a grain of
[34:31] wheat that had to die
[34:32] and be crushed or bruised before it
[34:35] could live again
[34:36] since christ is pure meal or pure
[34:39] teachings meal with levin represents
[34:41] impure or corrupted teachings
[34:45] next what woman or church hid leaven or
[34:49] lies in her teachings until the whole
[34:51] doctrine was leavened
[34:53] she is mystery babylon or the roman
[34:55] catholic church for jesus warns us of
[34:58] only one woman who is drunken with the
[35:00] blood of the saints and whose false
[35:02] doctrines he hates because they are
[35:04] completely abominable
[35:06] calling her both jezebel and the mother
[35:09] of harlots and abominations of the earth
[35:12] this unfaithful church worked
[35:14] deceptively for she hid the mixed in
[35:17] leaven of polytheism a three-person god
[35:21] from the people as satan delights in
[35:23] masking sin as righteousness or light
[35:28] fourth the three measures of meal denote
[35:31] god's threefold manifestation as father
[35:34] son and holy ghost for god is truly the
[35:37] father the word and the holy ghost but
[35:40] these three are one not three persons
[35:43] neither god nor his bible ever say i am
[35:46] three persons
[35:47] so the leaven injected into the three
[35:49] measures is the three person
[35:52] false doctrine
[35:53] that god is three eternal separate
[35:56] distinct yet co-equal persons
[35:59] a three-person god creates polytheism
[36:01] tritheism and ultimately idolatry in all
[36:05] churches that confess the trinity
[36:08] fifth notice the leaven was hid in the
[36:10] meal early in the baking process
[36:13] this detail reveals that the false
[36:16] godhead teaching began early in church
[36:18] history
[36:19] the earliest record of believers using
[36:21] the false titles baptism rather than the
[36:24] true baptism in the name of the lord
[36:26] jesus christ
[36:27] comes from the didachi
[36:29] a second century catechism
[36:32] the didachi reads
[36:33] concerning baptism baptized thus
[36:36] having first rehearsed all these things
[36:39] baptized in the name of the father and
[36:41] of the son and of the holy ghost
[36:43] in running water
[36:45] yet the inspired inerrant infallible
[36:48] book of acts declares that early church
[36:50] pillars such as peter philip and paul
[36:53] all baptized using the literal name of
[36:56] the lord jesus christ during the
[36:58] church's infancy in the first century
[37:01] how contrary is the didache compared to
[37:03] peter's infallible words on the day the
[37:06] church was born the day of pentecost
[37:09] when he declared repent and be baptized
[37:12] every one of you in the name of jesus
[37:14] christ for the remission of sins and ye
[37:17] shall receive the gift of the holy ghost
[37:20] it was also during the second century
[37:22] many years after the bible authors and
[37:24] apostles completed the new testament
[37:26] canon that the term trinity was
[37:28] introduced by both theophilus of antioch
[37:32] and tertullian further demonstrating
[37:35] that the leaven was added by
[37:37] non-apostles early in church history
[37:41] lastly like leaven permeating throughout
[37:43] the entire bread
[37:45] until the hole is leavened the trinity
[37:47] lie has risen or expanded corrupting the
[37:50] entire set of catholic doctrine which
[37:52] includes the following heresies
[37:54] transubstantiation
[37:56] the communion of saints mandatory
[37:58] clerical celibacy the office of the pope
[38:02] the holy father title of the pope and
[38:04] the veneration of statues and images to
[38:06] name a few
[38:08] the trinity lie is so widespread that
[38:10] most church members do not question its
[38:13] validity
[38:14] one scholar uses fear to threaten his
[38:16] readers that they will lose their souls
[38:19] if they deny the trinity stating try to
[38:21] explain it and you'll lose your mind but
[38:24] try to deny it and you'll lose your soul
[38:27] how absurd
[38:28] it is impossible to lose your soul for
[38:30] not believing a dogmatic lie that is not
[38:33] even found in holy writ in fact the
[38:36] opposite is true
[38:37] god will save your soul for believing
[38:39] only god's words
[38:41] you must not give in to fear and submit
[38:43] to the man-made trinity dogma for god
[38:46] does not give us the spirit of fear but
[38:48] gives us the holy spirit the spirit of
[38:50] power and of love and of a sound mind
[38:53] there is nothing biblically sound about
[38:56] three individual persons as one deity
[38:59] put all your confidence in the word of
[39:00] god knowing god is one person
[39:03] and that you have not added to the bible
[39:05] nor taken away from it feast on the
[39:07] unleavened meal the pure unadulterated
[39:10] word of god
[39:13] parable number five the treasure hidden
[39:16] a field
[39:17] revelation a true believer joyfully
[39:19] trades all his possessions at the
[39:21] surprising opportunity to gain christ
[39:25] found in matthew 13 verse 44
[39:28] this fifth revelation likens the kingdom
[39:30] of heaven unto treasure hidden a field
[39:33] prompting a surprise and joyful man to
[39:36] sell all he has in order to buy the
[39:38] field and treasure therein the first
[39:41] symbol treasure
[39:42] stands for the baptism of the holy ghost
[39:44] for paul teaches that the gospel light
[39:47] that is shined in our hearts is treasure
[39:49] in earth and vessels for christ dwells
[39:52] in our hearts by faith
[39:54] god's spirit is treasure abiding in the
[39:57] heart or inner man
[39:59] this holy ghost treasure fell into the
[40:01] hearts of believers on the day of
[40:03] pentecost for peter said the promise of
[40:05] the holy ghost
[40:06] is what god shed forth and paul received
[40:09] the same experience later saying the
[40:11] love of god is shed abroad in our hearts
[40:14] by the holy ghost which is given to us
[40:17] to gain christ is to be filled with his
[40:19] spirit
[40:20] see chapter six
[40:22] furthermore jesus says the kingdom of
[40:24] god is within you and paul echoes the
[40:26] same that the hope of glory is christ in
[40:30] you
[40:31] after his resurrection jesus breathed on
[40:33] his disciples urging them to receive the
[40:35] holy ghost treasure saying receive ye
[40:38] the holy ghost
[40:40] christians will always love and consider
[40:42] god's spirit a treasure above the things
[40:44] of the world whereas tares will love
[40:47] worldly pleasures and riches more than
[40:49] god
[40:51] is the treasure found
[40:53] it is hidden in the field of the bible
[40:56] recall jesus is teaching from the
[40:58] introduction chapter about god's desire
[41:00] to hide himself from the prideful and
[41:03] reveal himself to the humble the
[41:05] treasure of the baptism of the holy
[41:07] ghost experience is found hidden only in
[41:09] the field of god's word foretold by the
[41:12] prophets
[41:13] nearly 800 years before messiah came
[41:16] joel prophesied of the baptism of the
[41:18] holy ghost which was fulfilled in acts 2
[41:21] verses 16-21 saying
[41:24] and it shall come to pass
[41:25] afterward that i will pour out my spirit
[41:28] upon all flesh and your sons and your
[41:30] daughters shall prophesy your old men
[41:32] shall dream dreams your young men shall
[41:35] see visions
[41:36] jeremiah some 600 years before christ
[41:39] prophesied of the holy ghost as
[41:41] vindicated by the book of hebrews saying
[41:44] but this shall be the covenant that i
[41:46] will make with the house of israel after
[41:48] those days saith the lord i will put my
[41:51] law in their inward parts
[41:53] and write it in their hearts and will be
[41:55] their god and they shall be my people
[41:58] some 580 years before messiah came
[42:01] ezekiel 4 told the baptism of the holy
[42:03] ghost writing a new heart also will i
[42:06] give you and a new spirit will i put
[42:08] within you and i will take away the
[42:10] stony heart of your flesh and i will
[42:12] give you an heart of flesh and i will
[42:14] put my spirit within you and cause you
[42:16] to walk in my statutes and ye shall keep
[42:19] my judgments and do them
[42:21] the treasure is in the field meaning the
[42:23] baptism of the holy ghost is foretold in
[42:26] scripture
[42:28] this parable says the man found the
[42:30] treasure in the field which speaks from
[42:32] the human perspective rather than gods
[42:35] scripture declares the eternal
[42:36] perspective is that no man can come to
[42:38] jesus except the father draws him and
[42:41] jesus is the one seeking the lost
[42:43] and not vice versa
[42:45] god's gracious heart though lets the man
[42:47] experience the joy of finding unexpected
[42:50] treasure from his human perspective
[42:53] philip's heart burned with excitement
[42:54] when he experienced the joy of finding
[42:56] christ telling nathanael we have found
[42:59] him of whom moses in the law
[43:02] and the prophets did right jesus of
[43:04] nazareth the son of joseph
[43:06] from god's perspective it was really
[43:08] jesus finding philip and nathanael while
[43:11] men are surprised at finding christ god
[43:13] is not but there is rejoicing both on
[43:16] earth and in heaven
[43:19] this parable emphasizes how god uses the
[43:21] element of surprise in believers lives
[43:24] awakening them from complete ignorance
[43:27] just as finding unexpected treasure in a
[43:30] simple common field would delight a man
[43:32] god's surprising instant introduction of
[43:35] himself into a man's life brings joy
[43:38] unspeakable in john 4 verses 4 through
[43:41] 42 the samaritan woman at jacob's well
[43:44] went to find water but instead
[43:47] surprisingly found the messiah's
[43:49] treasure of living waters she hid the
[43:51] treasure in her heart and excitedly went
[43:54] into the city and told others about it
[43:56] the bible says many of the samaritans of
[43:59] that city believed on him for the saying
[44:02] of the woman which testified he told me
[44:04] all that i ever did
[44:06] imagine the surprise and excitement the
[44:08] ethiopian eunuch experienced in acts 8
[44:11] verses 26 through 40 when philip
[44:14] preached unto him jesus for the first
[44:16] time from isaiah chapter 53
[44:19] the eunuch spontaneous joy in that
[44:21] predestined moment moved him to obey the
[44:24] gospel command to be baptized
[44:26] immediately and he commanded the chariot
[44:29] to stand still and they went down both
[44:31] into the water both philip and the
[44:33] eunuch and he baptized him
[44:37] this parable says the man hid the
[44:38] treasure before making the purchase of
[44:40] the field hiding god's treasure is
[44:43] likened unto meditating and memorizing
[44:45] scripture for psalm 119 verse 11 says
[44:49] thy word have i hidden mine heart that i
[44:51] might not sin against thee
[44:54] meditating upon scripture ensures the
[44:56] word is stored in your heart as david
[44:58] says
[44:59] let the words of my mouth and the
[45:01] meditation of my heart be acceptable in
[45:04] thy sight o lord my strength and my
[45:07] redeemer psalm 1 verse 2 declares the
[45:10] blessed man delights in god's word and
[45:13] in his law doth he meditate day and
[45:15] night
[45:16] may god's word be hidden in your heart
[45:18] like it was in jeremiah's heart for he
[45:20] says thy words were found and i did eat
[45:23] them and thy word was unto me the joy
[45:26] and rejoicing of mine heart
[45:29] selling and buying has both a natural
[45:32] and spiritual meaning in this parable in
[45:34] the natural believers gladly sell out
[45:37] any financial gains that might hinder
[45:39] their relationship with christ in order
[45:41] to receive him
[45:43] moses chose to suffer affliction with
[45:45] the people of god in order to gain the
[45:48] heavenly riches selling out the
[45:50] financial and worldly pleasures that
[45:52] would accompany being the son of pharaoh
[45:55] elisha sold out his farming aspirations
[45:57] in order to follow elijah slaying his
[46:00] yoke of oxen and feeding the people so
[46:02] he could follow and minister to elijah
[46:05] brothers peter and andrew and james and
[46:07] john left their fishing nets in order to
[46:09] follow christ as fishers of men
[46:12] jesus promised peter and all believers
[46:14] that the rewards for forsaking the world
[46:17] would be and hundredfold now in this
[46:18] time and eternal life in the world to
[46:21] come
[46:23] in the spiritual selling means forsaking
[46:26] satan's lies while buying represents
[46:28] repenting from those lies and believing
[46:30] god's word
[46:32] jesus says selling is losing your life
[46:34] that you might find your spiritual life
[46:36] which includes loving christ more than
[46:38] family proverbs 23 verse 23 says
[46:42] by the truth and sell it not also wisdom
[46:45] and instruction and understanding when
[46:48] you buy the field of biblical truth you
[46:50] will experience the treasure of the
[46:52] baptism of the holy ghost
[46:54] not only can you buy the truth but jesus
[46:56] tells the laodicean church age our age
[46:59] to buy spiritual gold and white raiment
[47:01] from him
[47:02] gold is time tested unwavering faith and
[47:05] white raiment represents a righteous
[47:08] spiritual life of integrity in obedience
[47:10] to the holy spirit
[47:14] parable six the one pearl of great price
[47:17] revelation a true believer abandons his
[47:20] search for many spiritual truths in
[47:22] order to gain the one most valuable
[47:24] truth christ
[47:27] found in matthew 13 verses 45 and 46
[47:31] this sixth revelation contrasts the
[47:34] fifth parable which emphasized the
[47:36] suddenness and total surprise when
[47:38] discovering god's treasure
[47:40] here in the sixth parable jesus
[47:42] illustrates how god satisfies those who
[47:45] are actively seeking many pearls by
[47:47] letting them discover the ultimate pearl
[47:51] the first symbol shows a merchant man
[47:53] seeking many pearls meaning someone who
[47:55] is actively searching for religious or
[47:58] spiritual truths
[47:59] the man is not a careless or wicked man
[48:02] but one who has been awakened and is
[48:04] sincerely seeking truth pearls always
[48:06] represent valuable beautiful and rare
[48:09] treasures in scripture as proved by the
[48:11] following texts
[48:13] matthew 7 verse 6 first timothy 2 verse
[48:16] 9 revelation 17 verse 4 revelation 18
[48:20] verse 12 and revelation 21 verse 21
[48:24] jesus words from matthew 7 verse 6 in
[48:26] particular prove pearls represent his
[48:29] life-changing truths saying
[48:31] give not that which is holy unto the
[48:34] dogs
[48:34] either cast you your pearls before swine
[48:37] lest they trample them under their feet
[48:40] and turn again and rend you
[48:43] men can find valuable moral teachings or
[48:46] pearls in nearly any religion but
[48:48] especially in judaism speaking of
[48:50] moses's law paul says the law is holy
[48:53] and the commandment holy and just and
[48:55] good there is tremendous moral wisdom in
[48:58] moses law
[48:59] yet there is one religion that is far
[49:01] above all others in value christianity
[49:04] because its founder offers complete
[49:06] forgiveness by grace
[49:08] power for living godly on this earth and
[49:10] eternal life
[49:13] the pearl of great price typifies
[49:15] receiving jesus christ spirit or the
[49:17] baptism of the holy ghost for this
[49:19] baptism was the mystery hid from ages
[49:22] and generations
[49:23] god loves and will reward diligent
[49:25] searchers of truth by letting them
[49:28] discover the ultimate pearl the baptism
[49:30] of the holy ghost
[49:31] when a man finds his great pearl by
[49:34] hearing preaching about jesus christ he
[49:36] will sell everything in order to possess
[49:38] it as seen in two clear new testament
[49:41] passages
[49:43] acts 19 verses one through seven
[49:46] provides the first example
[49:48] observe how the twelve ephesian
[49:50] believers sold out their goodly pearls
[49:53] or their previous holy teachings learned
[49:55] from john the baptist in order to
[49:58] possess the one pearl of great price the
[50:00] baptism of the holy ghost
[50:02] once paul revealed to them that there
[50:04] was one great pearl available to them
[50:06] the baptism of the holy ghost
[50:08] the twelve were quickly re-baptized in
[50:11] the name of the lord jesus christ and
[50:13] receive god's holy ghost treasure for
[50:16] the holy ghost came on them and they
[50:18] spake with tongues and prophesied the
[50:20] ephesians sold out john's baptism were
[50:23] moved on to the fresh revelation of the
[50:25] spirit for their time period in order to
[50:28] possess the baptism of the holy ghost
[50:30] the one pearl of great price
[50:34] paul's conversion from judaism to
[50:35] christianity is a second clear example
[50:38] of a man selling out his goodly pearls
[50:41] or moral teachings in order to gain the
[50:43] baptism of the holy ghost
[50:45] by his own words paul was blameless a
[50:48] hebrew of hebrews a dedicated devoted
[50:51] and learned man with tremendous zeal
[50:53] from moses's law but after once being in
[50:56] the supernatural presence of jesus
[50:58] christ paul's desires were transformed
[51:00] and he eagerly forsook his previous
[51:03] self-righteousness renouncing it as dung
[51:06] in order that he might win christ
[51:08] it wasn't long after paul's conversion
[51:10] that he received the pearl of great
[51:12] price the baptism of the holy ghost
[51:15] paul described the pearl of great price
[51:17] by saying he wanted to be found in him
[51:19] christ not having mine own righteousness
[51:22] which is of the law but that which is
[51:24] through the faith of christ the
[51:26] righteousness which is of god by faith
[51:29] that i may know him and the power of his
[51:32] resurrection and the fellowship of his
[51:34] sufferings being made conformable unto
[51:37] his death
[51:39] a final thought comes from revelation 21
[51:41] verse 21 which says
[51:43] and the twelve gates were twelve pearls
[51:46] every several gate was of one pearl and
[51:48] the street of the city was pure gold as
[51:51] it were transparent glass
[51:53] herein is the christian's future home
[51:55] the holy city new jerusalem the
[51:58] tabernacle of god which comes down from
[52:00] god out of heaven as the eternal abode
[52:03] after all sin death and hell are
[52:06] annihilated and forgotten
[52:08] this eternal city is indescribably
[52:10] beautiful as every facet of her beauty
[52:13] tells a story of amazing grace and
[52:16] jesus's love
[52:17] notice there are 12 gates three gates on
[52:20] each of the four sides
[52:22] each made from a massive pearl upon
[52:24] entering the holy city you must pass
[52:26] through a massive pearl of great price
[52:29] as a reminder of god's saving grace to
[52:31] you no wonder christ will wipe all the
[52:34] tears from our eyes as we enter the city
[52:37] and rejoice in his matches love story of
[52:39] redemption for will remember our life
[52:41] story our deep soul desire and
[52:44] passionate longing to possess the
[52:46] ultimate treasure god's spirit and his
[52:49] amazing grace to let us find it
[52:52] our hearts will feel eternally grateful
[52:54] that we sold out the many goodly pearls
[52:56] of religious truth in order to possess
[52:59] the holy ghost
[53:00] the best word to describe such a happy
[53:02] group of people is blessed for
[53:05] revelation 22 verses 14 and 15 says
[53:08] blessed are they that do his
[53:10] commandments that they might have right
[53:12] to the tree of life and may enter in
[53:14] through the gates into the city for
[53:16] without are dogs and sorcerers and
[53:19] whoremongers and murderers and idolaters
[53:22] and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie
[53:27] parable number 7 the net cast into the
[53:30] sea
[53:31] revelation
[53:32] at the end of the world the gospel will
[53:34] attract believers and unbelievers but
[53:36] god's angels will separate the wicked
[53:39] away from the holy
[53:40] found in matthew 13 verses 47 through 50
[53:44] the seventh revelation is similar to the
[53:46] wheat and tares as it depicts two
[53:49] different kinds of people closely
[53:50] associated to one another the wicked and
[53:53] the just the seventh parable foretells a
[53:56] worldwide gathering onto christianity
[53:59] that requires a final separation between
[54:02] the wicked and just
[54:04] the net cast into the sea that gathers
[54:07] of every kind denotes the universal
[54:10] invitation to christianity commissioned
[54:12] by christ for his disciples to go ye
[54:15] into all the world and preach the gospel
[54:18] to every creature he that believeth and
[54:20] is baptized shall be saved but he that
[54:23] believeth not shall be damned
[54:25] according to revelation 17 verse 15 the
[54:28] sea represents peoples multitudes
[54:31] nations and tongues
[54:32] our lord prophesied the end would not
[54:34] come until every nation had heard the
[54:36] gospel invitation
[54:38] further vindicating the seventh parable
[54:40] as a true end time revelation
[54:44] jesus called his first preachers fishers
[54:46] of men so the invitation to become a
[54:49] christian is the spiritual net that
[54:51] draws men to christ
[54:52] however just as judas iscariot was
[54:55] called of jesus and later fell by
[54:57] transgression the calling does not
[54:59] guarantee salvation for christ says for
[55:02] many be called but few chosen
[55:06] jesus john and paul prophesied of this
[55:09] net scenario for the last days which
[55:11] foretold large numbers of people or
[55:14] every kind who are attracted to
[55:16] christianity but are mere professors of
[55:18] the faith rather than true possessors of
[55:21] its power
[55:22] jesus witnessed this same vain worship
[55:24] in his earthly ministry saying this
[55:26] people draw thy unto me with their mouth
[55:29] and on earth me with their lips but
[55:31] their heart is far from me but in vain
[55:33] they do worship me teaching for
[55:35] doctrines the commandments of men
[55:37] jesus said the false church would be so
[55:39] close to the true that only the elect
[55:41] would not be deceived
[55:43] john's revelation taught that the false
[55:45] economical move would deceive the whole
[55:47] world and eventually seek to control
[55:50] each person's ability to buy and sell
[55:53] paul said deceivers would wax worse and
[55:55] worse having a form of godliness but
[55:57] denying the power thereof
[56:00] so the question arises why would the
[56:02] masses be attracted to gather around
[56:04] christianity yet remain wicked and
[56:06] deceived the answer comes from jesus
[56:09] christ and paul
[56:10] wicked people enjoy the blessings of the
[56:12] holy spirit but do not want to fully
[56:14] surrender to it in matthew 5 45 christ
[56:18] says for he maketh his son to rise on
[56:20] the evil and on the good and sendeth
[56:23] rain on the just and on the unjust
[56:25] god is so gracious he sends natural
[56:28] sunlight and rain upon just and unjust
[56:31] people
[56:32] all sinners enjoy the blessings of the
[56:34] sun and rain yet many deny god's
[56:36] existence
[56:37] likewise god's mercy also sends
[56:39] spiritual reign or his spirit's
[56:42] anointing upon both just and unjust
[56:45] people
[56:47] sinners can experience god's joy freedom
[56:49] and love and yet be lost
[56:52] psalm says god's presence brings a
[56:54] fullness of joy which is the same
[56:56] emotion the stony-hearted ones
[56:58] experienced temporarily before becoming
[57:01] offended by the word
[57:03] isaiah 10 verse 27 teaches the spirit's
[57:06] anointing also breaks demonic yokes or
[57:09] addictions granting freedom in people's
[57:12] lives
[57:13] but all too often as jesus teaches the
[57:15] person set free with a clean house
[57:18] allows seven more devils to return
[57:20] falling back into sinful addiction and
[57:23] the last state is worse than the first
[57:25] since god is a spirit and god is love
[57:28] sinners can feel god's merciful love
[57:30] offering them truth but then reject it
[57:32] because they don't love the truth since
[57:34] god's spirit is the spirit of truth
[57:38] paul by the spirit further expounds on
[57:41] this thought in hebrews 6 verses 4
[57:43] through 8 comparing wicked people who
[57:46] temporarily enjoy the blessings of the
[57:48] holy spirit
[57:49] yet later live openly wicked lives to
[57:52] plants that bear thorns and briars
[57:55] the apostle says wicked people whose end
[57:57] is burning just like the tares can be
[58:00] enlightened of the spirit can taste of
[58:02] heavenly gifts be partakers of the holy
[58:05] ghost but still fall away from living a
[58:08] true christian life
[58:09] just as the thorn lives off the rain so
[58:12] do many sinners live off god's anointing
[58:14] but they are not the seed or children of
[58:16] god and cannot bring forth godly fruit
[58:19] because they are workers of iniquity
[58:23] does this teaching surprise you it did
[58:25] me
[58:26] not long after my surrender to christ in
[58:28] the year 2000 i was reading my bible in
[58:31] my college dorm room and came across
[58:33] matthew 7 verses 21-23 which says
[58:37] not everyone that saith unto me lord
[58:39] lord shall enter into the kingdom of
[58:41] heaven but he that doeth the will of my
[58:43] father which is in heaven
[58:45] many will say to me in that day lord
[58:46] lord have we not prophesied in thy name
[58:49] and in thy name have cast out devils and
[58:52] in thy name done many wonderful works
[58:55] and then will i profess unto them i
[58:57] never knew you depart from me ye that
[58:59] work iniquity
[59:02] i was confounded how could jesus command
[59:05] that many eternally depart from him who
[59:08] had done wonderful works like
[59:10] prophesying and casting out devils in
[59:12] his name
[59:14] how could christ condemn people who had
[59:16] been anointed of his spirit to do good
[59:17] works
[59:19] two years later the undeniable
[59:21] revelation came as i listened to william
[59:24] branham's sermon the anointed ones at
[59:26] the end time
[59:27] branham pointed me to scriptures showing
[59:29] the true anointing of god's spirit
[59:31] temporarily falls on false teachers
[59:34] of course the anointing is not upon the
[59:37] false teacher while he is teaching lies
[59:39] but it falls on him either before or
[59:42] after while worshiping operating
[59:44] spiritual gifts and praying
[59:46] branham emphasized jesus's words in
[59:49] matthew 24 verse 24 which speaks of
[59:52] false christs and false prophets
[59:55] the genuine anointing of the holy spirit
[59:57] temporarily manifests through an unsaved
[1:00:00] person
[1:00:02] scripture contains multiple examples of
[1:00:04] false christs or wicked people who want
[1:00:08] only god's blessings and mercies but not
[1:00:10] a holy fully surrendered life to god's
[1:00:13] word in genesis cain worshiped the true
[1:00:16] god heard his voice and spoke back to
[1:00:18] him was given god's direct instruction
[1:00:21] for obedience
[1:00:22] begged him for mercy and received it but
[1:00:25] left the presence of god as a reprobate
[1:00:28] a son of that wicked one
[1:00:30] in numbers balaam is perhaps the
[1:00:32] clearest bible example of a false christ
[1:00:35] this false prophet spoke directly to god
[1:00:37] in extended conversations called jehovah
[1:00:40] my god experienced supernatural visions
[1:00:43] and trances when the holy spirit fell on
[1:00:46] him and prophesied correctly about
[1:00:48] israel by the holy ghost
[1:00:51] sadly balaam ultimately loved money more
[1:00:53] than god leading him to teach israel to
[1:00:56] commit fornication which caused 24 000
[1:01:00] deaths
[1:01:01] the prophecy of balaam by god's spirit
[1:01:03] was correct but his teaching was false
[1:01:06] peter said balaam's destiny was
[1:01:08] hell judas iscariot is a third example
[1:01:12] for he was chosen by jesus yet unclean
[1:01:15] he was given power to cast out unclean
[1:01:18] spirits and heal all manner of sickness
[1:01:20] and diseases and must have correctly
[1:01:22] operated in the supernatural as
[1:01:25] evidenced at the last supper when the
[1:01:27] other 11 apostles questioned if they
[1:01:30] were the traitor not instantly
[1:01:32] suspecting judas
[1:01:34] access judas obtained a part of the
[1:01:36] apostolic ministry but fell from god as
[1:01:38] a traitor was lost and went to his own
[1:01:41] place as the son of perdition
[1:01:44] branham citing jesus's warning to remove
[1:01:47] names of reprobates out of the book of
[1:01:49] life in revelation 3 verse 15 says of
[1:01:52] judas
[1:01:54] the part that judas obtained amongst the
[1:01:56] twelve and then lost was neither
[1:01:59] inferior to the ministries of the other
[1:02:01] eleven nor was it a devilish foreign
[1:02:04] ministry interjected amongst the
[1:02:06] ministries of the others
[1:02:08] judas a devil lost a god-given holy
[1:02:11] ghost ministry and killed himself and
[1:02:14] went to his own place
[1:02:16] his name was even in the book of life
[1:02:18] but his name was blotted out
[1:02:21] it is through the right approach to god
[1:02:23] that sinners like cain balaam and judas
[1:02:26] experience god's anointing god promises
[1:02:28] to draw an eye to those who draw an eye
[1:02:30] to him
[1:02:31] sinners like saints draw nigh to god
[1:02:34] through sacrifice humility and reverence
[1:02:37] to receive god's mercy
[1:02:39] but saints faithfully serve god
[1:02:40] thereafter while sinners backslide
[1:02:43] cain drew near to god by bringing him an
[1:02:45] offering but it was the wrong kind
[1:02:48] balaam drew near to god and heard his
[1:02:50] specific instructions through private
[1:02:52] worship prayer and sacrifice offering a
[1:02:55] block and ram upon seven separate altars
[1:02:59] judas knew the right approach to
[1:03:00] experiencing god's power was being
[1:03:02] careful to always respect jesus and
[1:03:05] never say an evil word against him for
[1:03:07] jesus said this was the key to doing
[1:03:09] miracles in his name
[1:03:10] according to christ many unsaved workers
[1:03:13] of iniquity will plead their case to be
[1:03:15] saved on judgment day based upon their
[1:03:17] experiences with the anointing but
[1:03:19] jesus's judgments will be based upon who
[1:03:22] obeyed the will of god with their entire
[1:03:24] life
[1:03:26] this teaching implies that signs
[1:03:28] miracles and wonders done by the holy
[1:03:30] ghost prove only god's presence
[1:03:33] manifested among a group and they do not
[1:03:35] vindicate that group or individual as
[1:03:38] being truly saved a move of the holy
[1:03:40] ghost proves the group or individual
[1:03:43] approach god correctly in a temporary
[1:03:45] manner
[1:03:46] no matter the denomination or movement
[1:03:49] charismatic pentecostal word of faith
[1:03:52] apostolic holiness etc
[1:03:54] miracles do not prove a person is saved
[1:03:57] or a church is part of the true kingdom
[1:03:59] of god
[1:04:00] give the individual denomination or
[1:04:03] movement time to manifest the real seed
[1:04:06] inside of them so you can judge the
[1:04:08] fruit of the ministry since jesus said a
[1:04:10] tree is known by its fruit
[1:04:12] miracles and supernatural works prove
[1:04:15] only that the holy ghost was manifesting
[1:04:17] not that he is having the full
[1:04:19] preeminence he desires in their daily
[1:04:21] lives
[1:04:23] once the gospel net is full at the end
[1:04:26] of the world having gathered or
[1:04:28] attracted every kind of person god's
[1:04:30] angels will come and separate the wicked
[1:04:32] from the just so that the wicked may be
[1:04:35] burned
[1:04:36] this separation will take place at the
[1:04:38] great white throne judgment as seen in
[1:04:40] revelation 20 verses 11 through 15 and
[1:04:43] matthew 25 verses
[1:04:45] 31-46
[1:04:47] the tares or wicked workers of iniquity
[1:04:50] will see abraham isaac and jacob in the
[1:04:53] kingdom of god but they will be thrust
[1:04:55] out
[1:04:56] the wicked will experience wailing and
[1:04:58] gnashing of teeth in the lake of fire
[1:05:00] which is the same judgment pronounced
[1:05:01] upon the tares in the second parable
[1:05:04] it behooves all who call upon the name
[1:05:06] of jesus christ to examine themselves to
[1:05:09] see if they are in the faith and that
[1:05:11] christ's spirit is in their souls
[1:05:14] christians must diligently make their
[1:05:15] calling and election sure
[1:05:17] faithfully doing god's works bringing
[1:05:19] forth fruit pleasing unto god
[1:05:24] parable 8 the unmerciful servant
[1:05:27] revelation a person must forgive others
[1:05:30] if he expects god to forgive him
[1:05:33] found in matthew 18 verses 21-35
[1:05:37] this parable stresses the necessity of
[1:05:39] forgiveness
[1:05:40] jesus tells this parable in response to
[1:05:42] peter's question about how often he
[1:05:45] should forgive his brother
[1:05:46] peter estimates seven times but jesus
[1:05:49] says seventy times seven or an unlimited
[1:05:52] number of times
[1:05:55] in the parable the certain king
[1:05:57] represents the heavenly father who
[1:05:59] compassionately and freely forgives a
[1:06:01] servant who owes ten thousand talents or
[1:06:04] an insurmountable debt
[1:06:06] so great is our sin debt to god that
[1:06:09] none could dream of undoing the sin
[1:06:11] damage we have committed against god's
[1:06:13] holiness
[1:06:14] sadly this forgiven servant leaves the
[1:06:17] king's presence and finds a fellow
[1:06:19] servant who owes him one hundred talents
[1:06:21] or one percent of the debt he was
[1:06:23] forgiven and demands he repay him
[1:06:26] the fellow servant begs for patience
[1:06:28] but the first servant refuses and has
[1:06:31] him cast into prison
[1:06:32] when the king hears of this injustice
[1:06:35] the first servant is brought before him
[1:06:37] and in wrath declares him as wicked
[1:06:40] the king sentences him to torment until
[1:06:42] his ten thousand talent debt is paid
[1:06:46] representing a sentence to the lake of
[1:06:48] fire
[1:06:48] jesus states so likewise shall my
[1:06:51] heavenly father do also unto you if ye
[1:06:54] from your hearts forgive not everyone
[1:06:56] his brother their
[1:06:58] trespasses this parable is found only in
[1:07:02] matthew jesus is recorded stating the
[1:07:05] same principle from the sermon on the
[1:07:06] mount in matthew 6 verses 14 and 15 and
[1:07:10] during the final week of his earthly
[1:07:12] life in mark 11 verses 25-26
[1:07:16] certainly christ wants us to understand
[1:07:19] all sins committed against us by others
[1:07:22] pale in comparison to the sins we have
[1:07:24] committed against almighty god
[1:07:28] forgiveness is so important that jesus
[1:07:30] inserts it
[1:07:31] in the lord's prayer
[1:07:33] the model daily prayer in matthew 6
[1:07:35] verse 12
[1:07:36] and forgive us our debts as we forgive
[1:07:39] our debtors
[1:07:40] the gift of forgiveness is daily
[1:07:42] received and daily given
[1:07:44] christ implores christians to humbly
[1:07:46] possess a debtor's mindset so we can
[1:07:49] forgive those indebted to us
[1:07:52] the god designed debtors mindset
[1:07:54] produces gratitude and mercy
[1:07:56] rather than hopeless guiltiness our lord
[1:07:59] simply wants us to always remember how
[1:08:01] much we were forgiven so that we can
[1:08:03] freely forgive others
[1:08:05] jesus promises in matthew 5 verse 7
[1:08:08] blessed are the merciful for they shall
[1:08:10] obtain mercy
[1:08:12] kingdom citizens keep their hearts or
[1:08:15] grounds free from every life-sucking
[1:08:17] root of bitterness that tries to spring
[1:08:20] up in their hearts through prayer
[1:08:22] christians daily weed their hearts and
[1:08:24] cast their cares upon the lord putting
[1:08:26] away all roots of bitterness
[1:08:28] choose to forgive with a tender heart
[1:08:31] paul says let all bitterness and wrath
[1:08:33] and anger and clamor and evil speaking
[1:08:37] be put away from you with all malice and
[1:08:40] be kind one to another tenderhearted
[1:08:42] forgiving one another even as god for
[1:08:45] christ's sake hath forgiven you
[1:08:47] on a personal note i strongly encourage
[1:08:50] you to view my friend's testimony of
[1:08:52] forgiveness on youtube
[1:08:54] michael j mccloskey a testimony of
[1:08:56] forgiveness
[1:08:58] seven years after being targeted and
[1:09:00] shot by a police officer in which he
[1:09:02] became paralyzed from the waist down
[1:09:04] michael powerfully and publicly forgave
[1:09:07] the officer in court holding high his
[1:09:09] king james bible as a banner of victory
[1:09:13] his story is one of the greatest
[1:09:14] examples of jesus's love and forgiveness
[1:09:17] i have ever witnessed
[1:09:20] parable number 9 the laborers in the
[1:09:23] vineyard
[1:09:24] revelation
[1:09:25] eternal life is the reward god gives to
[1:09:27] all who labor in his kingdom
[1:09:30] found in matthew 20 verses 1 1-16
[1:09:34] jesus's parable of labors in the
[1:09:36] vineyard magnifies his equity as he
[1:09:38] gives each of his servants a just reward
[1:09:41] for their labor isaiah rightly describes
[1:09:43] god as
[1:09:44] a just god and a savior our god fairly
[1:09:48] deals with mankind in every age as he
[1:09:50] seeks laborers for his kingdom
[1:09:53] paul supports isaiah asking is there
[1:09:55] unrighteousness with god god forbid
[1:09:59] jesus is the householder who hires
[1:10:02] laborers for his vineyard at the first
[1:10:04] hour of the day and agrees on their
[1:10:06] wages the householder hires more
[1:10:08] laborers at the 3rd 6th and 9th hours
[1:10:11] before making one last hire at the 11th
[1:10:13] hour
[1:10:14] at the conclusion of the day
[1:10:16] the 12th hour the laborers come to jesus
[1:10:19] for payment
[1:10:20] the last laborers the 11th hour workers
[1:10:23] are paid first receiving a penny when
[1:10:25] the first hour workers are paid the same
[1:10:27] amount some murmur against the
[1:10:29] householder but are rebuked because the
[1:10:32] initial payment agreement was kept the
[1:10:34] householder declares his lawful dealings
[1:10:37] and affirms he is good
[1:10:40] the main lesson is that some christians
[1:10:41] labor longer than others and in much
[1:10:44] more difficult circumstances yet eternal
[1:10:46] life is the reward for all faithful
[1:10:49] laborers
[1:10:50] the first hour workers worked for 12
[1:10:52] hours and endured the sun's most intense
[1:10:55] heat for an entire day the 11th hour
[1:10:58] workers logged one hour at the sun
[1:11:00] setting and decreasing temperature
[1:11:03] apply this principle to spiritual labor
[1:11:05] as you compare the ministries of stephen
[1:11:07] and john who served one year and 66
[1:11:10] years respectively
[1:11:13] stephen is the first recorded christian
[1:11:15] martyr having been stoned by a jewish
[1:11:17] council around 31 a.d at the age of 29
[1:11:20] years
[1:11:21] during his one year of holy ghost
[1:11:23] empowered ministry stephen was full of
[1:11:25] faith and power did great wonders and
[1:11:28] miracles among the people
[1:11:29] a great labor of the kingdom was stephen
[1:11:32] yet he must receive the same eternal
[1:11:34] life reward as the apostle john history
[1:11:37] says john died around 100 a.d at the
[1:11:40] ripe old age of 94 years meaning he
[1:11:43] faithfully ministered for over 70 years
[1:11:45] both stephen and john endure the heat of
[1:11:47] persecution while laboring for the
[1:11:50] householder and both will receive
[1:11:52] eternal life the just and good payment
[1:11:54] promised to them
[1:11:56] john labored decades longer than stephen
[1:11:58] but each man's steps were ordered of the
[1:12:00] lord psalm 37 verse 23 reads the steps
[1:12:04] of a good man are ordered by the lord
[1:12:06] and he delighteth in his way
[1:12:09] the householder plainly states he can do
[1:12:12] his own will with his own workers saying
[1:12:15] i am good god is a good and fair
[1:12:17] heavenly father with a plan for every
[1:12:19] life
[1:12:20] the loving lord has different
[1:12:21] assignments for believers and today's
[1:12:24] spiritual labor conditions vary
[1:12:26] worldwide united states christians
[1:12:28] experience very little persecution but
[1:12:31] other christians especially middle
[1:12:32] easterners are facing genocide
[1:12:35] newsweek reports anti-christian
[1:12:37] persecution is increasing and its
[1:12:39] severity is intensifying making
[1:12:42] christians the most persecuted religious
[1:12:44] group in the world
[1:12:46] no matter the circumstances god desires
[1:12:49] faithful service in the hour in which ye
[1:12:51] are called
[1:12:52] conditions are only going to get worse
[1:12:55] prophecy says both love and the number
[1:12:57] of converts will continue to decrease
[1:12:59] until the end time
[1:13:01] matthew 24 verse 12 states and because
[1:13:04] iniquity shall abound the love of many
[1:13:06] shall wax cold
[1:13:08] sin destroys love god has to shorten the
[1:13:10] days to ensure some people are saved
[1:13:13] our lord says in matthew 24 22 and
[1:13:16] accept those days should be shortened
[1:13:18] there should be no flesh saved but for
[1:13:20] the elect's sake those days shall be
[1:13:22] shortened
[1:13:24] despite charismatics prophesying of
[1:13:26] worldwide revival and a great harvest of
[1:13:29] souls scripture foretells the opposite
[1:13:31] worldwide deception
[1:13:33] paul prophesies in second timothy 3
[1:13:35] verse 13 but evil men and seducers shall
[1:13:38] wax worse and worse deceiving and being
[1:13:40] deceived
[1:13:42] john says all nations will be deceived
[1:13:43] by and cooperate with the false church
[1:13:46] the mother harlot see chapter 9.
[1:13:50] the final scripture in the parable
[1:13:52] matthew 20 verse 16 says so the last
[1:13:55] shall be first and the first last for
[1:13:57] many be called but few chosen christ's
[1:14:00] parable closes with his assurance that
[1:14:03] he not man will determine the order of
[1:14:06] rewards and honor divine wisdom causes
[1:14:08] him to honor the last first and the
[1:14:11] first last
[1:14:12] god calls many to his service but he has
[1:14:14] chosen a select few to hire more
[1:14:17] honorable works based upon his foreign
[1:14:19] knowledge
[1:14:20] rest assured god's choosing is always
[1:14:22] right o the depth of the riches both of
[1:14:25] the wisdom and knowledge of god how
[1:14:27] unsearchable are his judgments and his
[1:14:29] ways past finding out for who hath known
[1:14:32] the mind of the lord or who hath been
[1:14:34] his counselor
[1:14:37] parable 10 the wicked husbandman
[1:14:40] revelation the kingdom was rejected by
[1:14:42] the jews and then given to the gentiles
[1:14:45] to bring forth fruit unto god
[1:14:48] found in matthew 21 verses 33 through 46
[1:14:52] jesus interprets the parable of the
[1:14:54] wicked husbandman for us
[1:14:56] christ declares to the jews therefore
[1:14:59] say i unto you the kingdom of god shall
[1:15:01] be taken from you and given to a nation
[1:15:04] bringing forth the fruits thereof
[1:15:07] the symbols are evident the heavenly
[1:15:09] father is the householder or owner of
[1:15:11] the vineyard representing the kingdom of
[1:15:13] god
[1:15:14] israel represents the husbandmen to whom
[1:15:17] the householder entrusted its fruit to
[1:15:19] when the householders sent servants to
[1:15:21] receive the fruit the husbandmen beat
[1:15:24] killed and stoned them
[1:15:26] jesus says these servants represent the
[1:15:28] old testament prophets god sent to
[1:15:30] israel whom they rejected luke 13 34
[1:15:34] reads o jerusalem jerusalem which
[1:15:37] killeth the prophets and stone is them
[1:15:39] that are sent unto thee how often would
[1:15:42] i have gathered thy children together as
[1:15:44] a hand doth gather her brood under her
[1:15:46] wings and ye would not
[1:15:49] lastly the householder sent his son to
[1:15:51] receive the fruit this represents the
[1:15:53] father sending his son jesus but the
[1:15:56] chief priests and pharisees crucified
[1:15:58] him out of the vineyard or without the
[1:16:00] gate of jerusalem
[1:16:03] containing some common sense the priests
[1:16:06] and pharisees infer jesus is likening
[1:16:08] them to the wicked husbandmen
[1:16:10] jesus asked if they have read psalm 118
[1:16:14] verses 22 and 23 which he quotes aloud
[1:16:17] in their ears
[1:16:19] multiple new testament passages refer to
[1:16:21] christ as the rejected stone
[1:16:24] acts 4 verse 11 romans 9 33
[1:16:28] ephesians 2 verse 20 and first peter 2
[1:16:30] verse 7.
[1:16:32] christ interprets the parable breathing
[1:16:34] out the sentence against israel that the
[1:16:36] kingdom will be given to the gentiles
[1:16:38] paul echoes this in acts 28 verse 28
[1:16:42] be it known therefore unto you that the
[1:16:44] salvation of god is sent unto the
[1:16:46] gentiles and that they will hear it
[1:16:50] parable 11 the king's son
[1:16:53] revelation believers respond to god's
[1:16:56] invitation for the rapture and are
[1:16:58] appropriately clothed in the wedding
[1:17:00] garment or the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:17:03] found in matthew 22 verses 1 through 14
[1:17:06] this parable typifies the heavenly
[1:17:09] father as a certain king preparing a
[1:17:11] wedding for his son or jesus christ
[1:17:15] the marriage represents the future
[1:17:16] marriage supper of the lamb taught in
[1:17:18] revelation 19 verse 9.
[1:17:20] this supper represents the wedding
[1:17:22] reception of christ and his bride the
[1:17:24] new testament church which takes place
[1:17:27] immediately after jesus raptures away
[1:17:29] his bride
[1:17:30] before the tribulation
[1:17:33] those bid into the wedding who would not
[1:17:35] come represent israel because they
[1:17:38] rejected their own messiah's invitation
[1:17:40] to the kingdom of god
[1:17:42] some jews made light of the imitation
[1:17:45] preferring farming and selling
[1:17:46] merchandise over following jesus's
[1:17:49] ministry
[1:17:50] the remaining jews or remnant slew
[1:17:53] jesus's servants or preachers he would
[1:17:55] send following his ascension to heaven
[1:17:58] christ plainly foretells that the jews
[1:18:00] will kill his prophets and wise men and
[1:18:03] scribes
[1:18:04] the wrath of the king's armies and the
[1:18:06] burning of the city represent the roman
[1:18:08] emperor titus's destruction of jerusalem
[1:18:12] in 70 a.d
[1:18:14] next the king sends out one last
[1:18:17] invitation to the farthest extents of
[1:18:19] his kingdom to the highways gathering
[1:18:22] both good and bad guests so that his
[1:18:24] wedding is fully attended
[1:18:26] this final invite represents the holy
[1:18:28] ghost gospel being given to the gentiles
[1:18:31] who were afar off from the promises of
[1:18:33] god
[1:18:34] paul and barnabas declare this to israel
[1:18:37] in acts 13 verse 46
[1:18:39] then paul and barnabas waxed bold and
[1:18:42] said it was necessary that the word of
[1:18:44] god should first have been spoken to you
[1:18:47] but seeing ye put it from you and judge
[1:18:49] yourselves unworthy of everlasting life
[1:18:52] lo we turn to the gentiles
[1:18:54] the jews judge themselves unworthy of
[1:18:56] everlasting life just as the king called
[1:18:59] them not worthy of the wedding
[1:19:02] the parable climaxes as the king comes
[1:19:05] into the wedding to see his gentile
[1:19:07] guests but finds a man without a wedding
[1:19:09] garment
[1:19:10] angered the king asked the guest how he
[1:19:13] came into the wedding without the
[1:19:14] garment but the guest is speechless
[1:19:17] punishment issues forth from the king as
[1:19:20] he sends the guest into outer darkness
[1:19:22] to endure weeping and gnashing of teeth
[1:19:25] why was the king so angry about the
[1:19:27] guest rejecting the wedding garment
[1:19:30] scripture teaches how kings and rulers
[1:19:32] provided changes of clothes as presents
[1:19:35] for their honored friends or guests such
[1:19:38] as the case of joseph providing a change
[1:19:40] of raiment for his brothers although
[1:19:42] benjamin received five changes turning
[1:19:45] down a wedding garment for a king's
[1:19:47] marriage celebration for his son would
[1:19:49] be the highest form of disrespect
[1:19:51] especially from a man who was filthy
[1:19:54] from the elements of living in the
[1:19:55] highways
[1:19:56] like esther knew a king must only be
[1:19:59] approached in a respectful clean and
[1:20:01] dignified manner
[1:20:03] but this guest refused the king's
[1:20:04] requirement for a wedding garment
[1:20:07] despite it being readily available and
[1:20:09] freely offered for all guests showing
[1:20:12] his disdain for the king
[1:20:14] his son and the other guests
[1:20:18] the wedding garment represents the
[1:20:20] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:20:21] because it is a gift god offers to
[1:20:24] believers their children and all that
[1:20:26] are far off even as many as the lord our
[1:20:29] god shall call
[1:20:30] jesus says the holy ghost is the promise
[1:20:32] of the father that endues or clothes
[1:20:36] believers in power
[1:20:38] paul too uses the garment imagery for
[1:20:40] the holy ghost saying but put ye on the
[1:20:43] lord jesus christ and make not provision
[1:20:45] for the flesh to fulfill the lust
[1:20:48] thereof
[1:20:49] in revelation 3 verse 4 the lord jesus
[1:20:51] admonishes the sardis church for their
[1:20:54] holy lifestyle saying
[1:20:56] thou hast a few names even in sardis
[1:20:59] which have not defiled their garments
[1:21:00] and they shall walk with me in white for
[1:21:03] they are worthy
[1:21:04] the wedding garment is also synonymous
[1:21:06] to eternal life because the baptism of
[1:21:09] the holy ghost is the spirit of christ
[1:21:11] in your soul
[1:21:12] paul says it is christ in you the hope
[1:21:14] of glory
[1:21:16] john supports this telling believers
[1:21:18] they already have eternal life in 1st
[1:21:20] john 5 13.
[1:21:22] these things have written unto you that
[1:21:24] believe on the name of the son of god
[1:21:26] that ye may know that ye have eternal
[1:21:28] life and that ye may believe on the name
[1:21:31] of the son of god
[1:21:34] the guest without the wedding garment
[1:21:35] represents believers who respond to
[1:21:37] preaching about the end times and gather
[1:21:40] in worship with holy ghost-filled saints
[1:21:43] but they themselves fail to receive the
[1:21:45] gift of the holy ghost
[1:21:46] this guest is just like judas iscariot
[1:21:49] jesus says this guest is cast into outer
[1:21:51] darkness where there is weeping and
[1:21:53] gnashing of teeth which represents being
[1:21:56] cast into hell according to four other
[1:21:58] scriptures
[1:21:59] most notably jesus says the christ
[1:22:01] rejecting jews will endure weeping and
[1:22:04] gnashing of teeth being thrust out or
[1:22:07] cast out of the kingdom of god as
[1:22:09] workers of iniquity
[1:22:10] jesus teaches workers of iniquity can be
[1:22:13] temporarily anointed of the holy spirit
[1:22:15] to perform miracles and yet turn from
[1:22:17] christ to do their own will instead of
[1:22:20] his
[1:22:20] judas performed and witnessed amazing
[1:22:23] miracles but forsook the spirits leading
[1:22:25] ended his own will selling out christ
[1:22:28] for 30 pieces of silver
[1:22:31] like judas garment rejecting worshipers
[1:22:34] feel the attraction of true worship and
[1:22:36] understand jesus's wedding or rapture
[1:22:39] will soon occur they like seeing the
[1:22:41] life-changing power of god on others but
[1:22:44] never experience it for themselves
[1:22:46] somehow the garment rejectors convince
[1:22:48] themselves that their own garments are
[1:22:50] good enough for god's service but isaiah
[1:22:53] 64 6 says but we are all as an unclean
[1:22:56] thing and all our righteousnesses are as
[1:23:00] filthy rags
[1:23:01] you cannot trust in your own
[1:23:02] righteousness when christ says your
[1:23:04] righteousness must exceed that of the
[1:23:07] pharisees in order to enter the kingdom
[1:23:09] christ is freely offering his
[1:23:11] righteousness in exchange for admission
[1:23:13] of our sins
[1:23:15] second corinthians 5 verse 21 declares
[1:23:18] for he hath made him to be sin for us
[1:23:20] who knew no sin that we might be made
[1:23:23] the righteousness of god in him
[1:23:27] parable 12 the 10 virgins
[1:23:30] revelation
[1:23:31] wise believers possess oil or the
[1:23:33] baptism of the holy ghost as they await
[1:23:36] their wedding day the rapture with jesus
[1:23:40] found in matthew 25 verses 1 through 13
[1:23:44] this parable further differentiates the
[1:23:46] two kinds of christians referenced in
[1:23:49] figure 21
[1:23:50] those with good and thorny hearts
[1:23:53] jesus now describes these two kinds of
[1:23:55] christians as wise and foolish
[1:23:57] wise christians will be ready for the
[1:23:59] bridegroom's coming or jesus's return
[1:24:02] for his bride at the rapture
[1:24:04] foolish christians will be caught
[1:24:05] unprepared and will miss the marriage or
[1:24:08] the marriage supper of the lamb that
[1:24:10] proceeds the rapture
[1:24:13] ancient jewish marriage ceremonies in
[1:24:15] the east were much different than those
[1:24:17] of modern western civilization
[1:24:20] the customs varied among families but
[1:24:22] often the bridegroom would begin a
[1:24:23] procession to the marriage ceremony at
[1:24:26] an unknown evening hour matthew henry
[1:24:29] says the bridegroom came attended with
[1:24:32] his friends late in the night to the
[1:24:34] house of the bride where she expected
[1:24:36] him
[1:24:37] attended with her bridemaids
[1:24:39] who upon notice given of the
[1:24:41] bridegroom's approach
[1:24:42] were to go out with lamps in their hands
[1:24:45] to light him into the house with
[1:24:47] ceremony and formality in order to the
[1:24:50] celebrating of the nuptials with great
[1:24:52] mirth
[1:24:54] the ten virgin bridesmaids serve the
[1:24:56] bride and possibly acted as witnesses of
[1:24:59] the wedding nuptials just as boaz
[1:25:01] requested 10 witnesses when he purchased
[1:25:04] ruth to be his wife
[1:25:07] examining the symbols the 10 virgins
[1:25:08] represent both the bride and her wedding
[1:25:11] party as they are her closest friends
[1:25:14] in short the ten virgins represent the
[1:25:16] new testament church
[1:25:18] the fact that they were virgins having
[1:25:20] no sexual intercourse
[1:25:22] symbolizes complete spiritual purity
[1:25:25] spiritual virgins today do not have any
[1:25:27] intercourse with worldliness and
[1:25:29] idolatry
[1:25:30] christ is their only love interest
[1:25:33] in complete devotion to him they do not
[1:25:35] flirt with worldly temptations
[1:25:37] paul tells the corinthians they should
[1:25:39] be chaste virgins to christ keeping
[1:25:41] their minds uncorrupted and undeceived
[1:25:44] from the simplicity that is in christ
[1:25:48] oil is the symbol of the baptism of the
[1:25:50] holy ghost because zechariah 4 says the
[1:25:53] golden oil that emptied out of the two
[1:25:55] olive trees into the seven candlesticks
[1:25:58] is god's spirit not by might nor by
[1:26:01] power but by my spirit saith the lord of
[1:26:04] hosts
[1:26:05] note carefully that both groups had oil
[1:26:07] but the wise had extra oil choosing to
[1:26:10] take additional oil in their vessels
[1:26:13] with their lamps
[1:26:14] the foolish virgins only had oil in
[1:26:17] their lamps but the wise took extra oil
[1:26:20] in case the bridegroom delayed his
[1:26:21] coming which he did
[1:26:24] wise christians today have an extra
[1:26:26] measure of oil representing the
[1:26:28] anointing of the holy ghost in their
[1:26:30] souls
[1:26:31] foolish virgins have the holy ghost
[1:26:33] anointing in their human spirits or
[1:26:35] minds
[1:26:36] but not in their souls as displayed in
[1:26:38] figure 22.
[1:26:41] the bridegroom tearing represents jesus
[1:26:44] tearing for the rapture which he has
[1:26:46] been doing for nearly two thousand years
[1:26:48] the midnight cry of the bridegroom's
[1:26:50] approaching procession awakening the
[1:26:52] virgins is equivalent to the rapture
[1:26:54] shout paul teaches about and symbolizes
[1:26:57] the supernatural preaching
[1:26:59] and healing ministry of the late william
[1:27:01] branham that awakened all christendom in
[1:27:04] the 1940s 50s and 60s see chapter 7 12
[1:27:09] and 13. please contact me if you have
[1:27:11] not heard the message or shout god gave
[1:27:14] to his prophet william branham
[1:27:17] upon hearing the shout all the virgins
[1:27:19] trimmed their lamps removing the charred
[1:27:22] portion of the wick ensuring their lamps
[1:27:24] burned their brightest
[1:27:26] lamp trimming represents sanctification
[1:27:29] or the second work of grace that follows
[1:27:31] justification
[1:27:32] william branham's shall ministry
[1:27:35] emphasize the three works of grace
[1:27:37] justification sanctification and the
[1:27:40] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:27:42] see chapter 5 and parable
[1:27:44] 15. the five foolish virgins realize
[1:27:47] they do not have enough oil and ask the
[1:27:50] wise for some of their oil
[1:27:52] the wise admit they do not have enough
[1:27:54] oil to share and charge the foolish to
[1:27:57] go buy their own oil
[1:27:59] spiritually holy ghost-filled christians
[1:28:01] or wise virgins cannot give the baptism
[1:28:04] of the spirit to anyone
[1:28:05] only christ baptizes souls with the holy
[1:28:08] ghost as john the baptist says i indeed
[1:28:11] baptize you with water unto repentance
[1:28:13] but he that cometh after me is mightier
[1:28:15] than i whose shoes i am not worthy to
[1:28:18] bear he shall baptize you with the holy
[1:28:20] ghost and with fire
[1:28:23] this is sound advice from the wise
[1:28:25] virgins as jesus invites all to come and
[1:28:28] buy spiritual blessings from him in
[1:28:30] revelation 3 verse 18
[1:28:32] i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried
[1:28:35] in the fire that thou mayest be rich and
[1:28:38] white raiment that thou mayest be
[1:28:40] clothed and that the shame of thy
[1:28:42] nakedness do not appear and anoint thine
[1:28:45] eyes with i salve that thou mayest see
[1:28:48] you again see how foolish virgins are
[1:28:49] more concerned with cares of the world
[1:28:52] physical transactions rather than
[1:28:54] spiritual transactions such as prayer
[1:28:57] the foolish virgins didn't repent pray
[1:29:00] and obey enough to receive the oil of
[1:29:02] the holy ghost because god promised to
[1:29:05] fill anyone with his holy spirit who
[1:29:07] truly hungered and thirsted for it yet
[1:29:09] the foolish live free from idolatry
[1:29:12] having no intercourse with demons
[1:29:15] while the foolish go to buy oil the
[1:29:17] bridegroom comes and the wise virgins go
[1:29:20] in with him to the marriage festivities
[1:29:22] and the door is shut the coming
[1:29:24] bridegroom is the rapture proving only
[1:29:27] wise virgins or holy ghost-filled
[1:29:29] christians go up to the meeting in the
[1:29:31] air
[1:29:33] the shutting of the door reminds you of
[1:29:34] noah's ark and god shutting the door in
[1:29:37] conclusion that no more souls would be
[1:29:39] saved
[1:29:40] this imagery fits our day perfectly
[1:29:43] jesus compares the conditions at the end
[1:29:45] of the world to the days of noah in luke
[1:29:47] 17 verses 26 through 30. in noah's day
[1:29:51] all believers gathered in one physical
[1:29:53] location the ark
[1:29:55] today god's people are gathering in one
[1:29:57] spiritual location heavenly places or
[1:30:00] the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:30:02] like the ark all those outside of the
[1:30:04] baptism of the holy ghost will suffer
[1:30:06] either partially or completely during
[1:30:09] the great tribulation
[1:30:12] once the last holy ghost-filled
[1:30:13] christian has his lamp trimmed and
[1:30:15] filled with oil the times of the
[1:30:17] gentiles will be complete
[1:30:19] god will cut off the gentile branch or
[1:30:22] people and graft the 144 thousand
[1:30:24] israelis back into the holy tree
[1:30:28] jesus concludes the parable by
[1:30:30] instructing believers to watch which in
[1:30:33] the greek means to give strict attention
[1:30:35] to the cautious active to take heed lest
[1:30:39] through remission and indolence some
[1:30:41] destructive calamities suddenly overtake
[1:30:43] one kingdom of god
[1:30:46] the teaching and preaching of the
[1:30:47] baptism of the holy ghost requires your
[1:30:49] full attention
[1:30:50] rapture ready saints will be fully
[1:30:52] focused on the bridegroom and actively
[1:30:54] working in his kingdom
[1:30:58] parable 13 the talents
[1:31:01] revelation christ commits varying
[1:31:03] amounts of talents and resources to his
[1:31:06] servants and rewards those who
[1:31:08] faithfully invest in them
[1:31:10] found in matthew 25 verses 14 through 30
[1:31:13] this parable greatly resembles the
[1:31:15] pounds parable but as notable
[1:31:17] differences i will point out in the 14th
[1:31:19] parable
[1:31:21] the talents parable was spoken privately
[1:31:24] to jesus disciples only as he sat with
[1:31:27] them on the mount of the olives a few
[1:31:29] days before his crucifixion
[1:31:31] jesus was answering their three
[1:31:33] questions
[1:31:34] when will the temple be thrown down what
[1:31:36] is the sign of jesus's second coming and
[1:31:38] what is the sign of the end of the world
[1:31:41] the talent's parable is jesus's answer
[1:31:43] to the question what is the sign of
[1:31:45] jesus's second coming because it
[1:31:47] immediately follows the parable of the
[1:31:49] ten virgins
[1:31:50] both deal with the second coming of
[1:31:52] jesus
[1:31:54] jesus says the kingdom of heaven is like
[1:31:56] a rich man traveling to a far country
[1:31:58] who leaves his goods or money with his
[1:32:00] servants to invest during his absence
[1:32:04] the first servant gets five talents the
[1:32:06] second gets two talents and the third
[1:32:08] gets one talent
[1:32:10] the varying amounts of talents speak to
[1:32:12] varying abilities and potential the rich
[1:32:14] man saw in his servants
[1:32:17] the two servants with the most talents
[1:32:19] diligently make business trades to
[1:32:21] double their money but the servant with
[1:32:23] one talent lazily buries it in the earth
[1:32:26] after a long absence the rich man
[1:32:28] returns to reckon with his servants he's
[1:32:31] well pleased with his first two but
[1:32:33] angry with a third because he did not
[1:32:35] apply the very least effort to increase
[1:32:37] his lord's money
[1:32:40] the rich man's long absence represents
[1:32:42] jesus going to heaven after his first
[1:32:44] coming and being there a long time until
[1:32:47] a second coming
[1:32:48] christians are awaiting his second
[1:32:50] coming now during jesus time away seated
[1:32:53] at the right hand of the majesty on high
[1:32:55] his servants are given talents or
[1:32:57] spiritual gifts to invest in for the
[1:33:00] benefit of jesus kingdom
[1:33:02] examining natural talents helps you
[1:33:05] understand the value of spiritual gifts
[1:33:07] chapter 11 defines and details the nine
[1:33:09] gifts of the holy ghost
[1:33:12] a talent is a sum of money weighing a
[1:33:14] talent in the greek
[1:33:16] english clergyman john gill 1697-1771
[1:33:21] notes a single talent was equivalent to
[1:33:24] 375 english pounds of silver
[1:33:27] or 4 500 pounds of gold
[1:33:29] since jesus did not indicate if the
[1:33:31] towns were silver or gold i will show
[1:33:33] the value of both
[1:33:35] using eric nye's online currency
[1:33:37] converter to convert 1770 ad english
[1:33:41] pounds into 2019
[1:33:44] adus dollars figure 23 shows the values
[1:33:48] of the talents both in silver and gold
[1:33:52] imagine your grandfather gifted you some
[1:33:54] of his money to start a business for him
[1:33:56] while he was traveling overseas
[1:33:58] with a smile his last words to you
[1:34:00] before his decade long absence are do
[1:34:03] something anything i can't wait to see
[1:34:06] what you'll accomplish for me
[1:34:08] whether the amount was at either end of
[1:34:10] the spectrum having seventy one thousand
[1:34:12] dollars one talent of silver or four
[1:34:15] million three hundred thousand dollars
[1:34:17] five gold talents you'd be extremely
[1:34:20] fortunate with either amount you are not
[1:34:22] starting in debt as this money is simply
[1:34:24] gifted to you
[1:34:26] again this is not your money with the
[1:34:28] largest sum you could immediately
[1:34:29] purchase property and build a home for
[1:34:31] your business
[1:34:32] with the smallest sum you could begin
[1:34:35] renting a property and purchase machines
[1:34:37] and other assets
[1:34:38] at the very least you can invest the
[1:34:40] money in the stock market money market
[1:34:43] accounts real estate or hand the money
[1:34:45] over to bankers in fixed annuities if
[1:34:48] you desire guaranteed returns
[1:34:51] the reality of this illustration is
[1:34:53] jesus christ god's own son has gifted
[1:34:56] you at least one of the nine spiritual
[1:34:57] gifts and instructed you to do your part
[1:35:00] in his kingdom the lord says help finish
[1:35:03] the great commission display my love and
[1:35:06] power to others especially your fellow
[1:35:08] man
[1:35:09] paul urges you to be fervent in business
[1:35:12] and redeem the time
[1:35:14] spiritual gifts are a serious matter one
[1:35:17] in which jesus deals very strictly
[1:35:19] of course spiritual gifts are secondary
[1:35:21] to charity or the baptism of the holy
[1:35:24] ghost
[1:35:25] but in this parable you learn how jesus
[1:35:27] is going to deal with his servants upon
[1:35:29] his return
[1:35:30] a time of holy reckoning
[1:35:32] something jesus's return will be like a
[1:35:34] party or whimsical celebration
[1:35:37] no jesus's return is a reckoning with
[1:35:39] his servants for their efforts to
[1:35:41] promote the father's business with his
[1:35:43] own money or talents
[1:35:47] paul teaches each believer is given
[1:35:48] different measures of gifts hence
[1:35:51] jesus's unequal distribution of talents
[1:35:54] the apostle uses the gift of faith as an
[1:35:56] example in romans 12 3
[1:35:58] instructing believers to be humble
[1:36:00] because god dealt to every man the
[1:36:02] measure of faith
[1:36:04] three verses later paul says we have
[1:36:06] gifts differing according to the grace
[1:36:08] that is given to us you may have noticed
[1:36:11] paul was endued with many gifts and long
[1:36:13] to impart spiritual gifts to the saints
[1:36:15] he ministered to
[1:36:17] perhaps paul was a five-talent servant
[1:36:19] of jesus christ paul spoke in tongues
[1:36:21] more often than all the corinthians
[1:36:23] exercised the gift of prophecy
[1:36:25] concerning future events worked miracles
[1:36:28] and had the gifts of the apostle and
[1:36:30] teacher
[1:36:31] yet instead of feeling self-sufficient
[1:36:33] and independent of god's assistance
[1:36:35] because of his many gifts paul
[1:36:37] constantly practiced self-denial forcing
[1:36:40] his body to obey god's word to ensure he
[1:36:43] would not be a spiritual castaway paul's
[1:36:45] example teaches us the more gifts we
[1:36:47] have the more responsible we must be
[1:36:50] in luke 12 48 our lord says for unto
[1:36:54] whomsoever much is given of him shall
[1:36:56] much be required
[1:36:58] and to whom men have committed much of
[1:37:00] him they will ask the more
[1:37:03] in the parable the first two servants
[1:37:05] doubled their money they were gifted the
[1:37:07] five talented servant now had ten and
[1:37:09] two talented servant now had four
[1:37:12] applying this spiritually jesus wants
[1:37:14] you to invest in your gifts so you're
[1:37:16] twice as wise for example
[1:37:18] as you were when you started serving him
[1:37:20] if wisdom is one of your spiritual gifts
[1:37:23] recall there are nine spiritual gifts if
[1:37:25] your gift is healing you'll strive to be
[1:37:27] twice as effective in praying for the
[1:37:29] sick than when you started jesus's
[1:37:31] apostles exemplify growing in their
[1:37:34] healing gifts because they had to learn
[1:37:35] from christ that some sicknesses like
[1:37:38] the demon of epilepsy only come out by
[1:37:41] prayer and fasting
[1:37:43] christians see growth in their spiritual
[1:37:44] lives as evidence of dedication to
[1:37:47] christ ii peter 3 verse 18 says but grow
[1:37:51] in grace and in the knowledge of our
[1:37:53] lord and savior jesus christ
[1:37:55] the way to grow is to abide in christ
[1:37:57] jesus says abide in me and i in you as
[1:38:00] the branch cannot bear fruit of itself
[1:38:03] except it abide in the vine
[1:38:05] no more can ye except you abide in me
[1:38:08] if you abide in me and my words abide in
[1:38:10] you ye shall ask what ye will and it
[1:38:13] shall be done unto you numerous
[1:38:16] scriptures speak of abounding or
[1:38:18] increasing in everything
[1:38:20] love hope giving utterance diligence
[1:38:23] judgment faith virtue knowledge and all
[1:38:26] the character qualities of christ
[1:38:30] bearing your talent or running from your
[1:38:32] giftedness is not an option
[1:38:34] you learn from the parable's third and
[1:38:36] final servant that hiding your tail in
[1:38:38] the earth is a wicked and slawful act
[1:38:41] christians must defeat laziness letting
[1:38:44] nothing distract them from doing the
[1:38:45] father's business
[1:38:47] additionally you can see the disastrous
[1:38:49] effects of the spirit of fear in this
[1:38:51] parable the wicked servant says he was
[1:38:53] afraid and so he did nothing for jesus
[1:38:56] kingdom even falsely accusing our lord
[1:38:59] harboring fear causes spiritual
[1:39:01] paralysis and is a great sin revelation
[1:39:04] says the fearful will burn in the lake
[1:39:05] of fire meaning they are not worthy of
[1:39:07] eternal life and will not enter the new
[1:39:09] jerusalem there is nothing to fear if
[1:39:11] jesus is your lord because christ has
[1:39:14] promised his holy spirit will never
[1:39:16] leave nor forsake us
[1:39:18] very plainly jesus does not give you the
[1:39:20] spirit of fear but gives power love and
[1:39:23] a sound mind
[1:39:24] remember that god has predestined all
[1:39:26] events and assigned you works he
[1:39:28] ordained you to do before the world was
[1:39:31] founded
[1:39:32] the faithful god will work out
[1:39:33] everything if you will just believe him
[1:39:35] and humbly invest in your ministry and
[1:39:37] spiritual gifts the wicked servant is
[1:39:40] cast into outer darkness where weeping
[1:39:42] and gnashing of teeth is
[1:39:44] this is a reference to the lake of fire
[1:39:46] as christ says weeping and gnashing is
[1:39:48] experienced by the group that is thrust
[1:39:50] out of the kingdom of god and sees with
[1:39:52] their own eyes abraham isaac and jacob
[1:39:55] ruling that kingdom
[1:39:58] the lord jesus says the one talent
[1:40:00] of the wicked servant is given to the
[1:40:02] first servant with ten talents
[1:40:04] it's doubtful this means jesus gives one
[1:40:06] person spiritual gifts to another
[1:40:09] but one certain application is that
[1:40:11] christ will have one person finish a
[1:40:13] ministry that another person has
[1:40:15] forsaken
[1:40:16] acts 1 verses 23 through 26
[1:40:19] exemplifies this truth as mathias is
[1:40:22] chosen to replace judas iscarit as one
[1:40:24] of the twelve apostles
[1:40:26] history says matthias labored greatly
[1:40:29] for christ preaching in judea before his
[1:40:31] missionary work of converting souls to
[1:40:33] jesus in cappadocia
[1:40:36] matthias died a martyr by crucifixion in
[1:40:39] the region about the caspian sea
[1:40:42] our lord directs you to recognize your
[1:40:44] ministry and be responsible for it or
[1:40:47] else another may take your crown
[1:40:49] revelation 3 verse 11 says behold i come
[1:40:52] quickly
[1:40:53] hold that fast which thou hast that no
[1:40:56] man take thy crown it appears matthias
[1:40:58] took the crown judas forfeited you must
[1:41:01] diligently serve jesus if you want a
[1:41:03] full reward
[1:41:04] second john 1 verse 8 reads
[1:41:07] look to yourselves that we lose not
[1:41:09] those things which we have wrought
[1:41:12] but that we receive a full reward
[1:41:15] the lesson is that jesus wants his
[1:41:17] closest most intimate servants to know
[1:41:20] he's given them different amounts of
[1:41:22] varying gifts but each can faithfully
[1:41:24] invest in them for jesus glory
[1:41:27] recall that jesus had to tell peter to
[1:41:30] not worry about god's plans for john's
[1:41:32] ministry but rather to fix his eyes
[1:41:35] solely upon christ
[1:41:36] your eyes must always be focused upon
[1:41:38] jesus's will for your life rather than
[1:41:41] comparing your life to others
[1:41:45] parable 14 the pounds
[1:41:48] revelation
[1:41:49] christ provides an equal opportunity to
[1:41:51] his servants and rewards those who
[1:41:54] faithfully act upon it
[1:41:56] found in luke 19 verses 11 through 27
[1:41:59] the pounds parable closely resembles the
[1:42:01] talents but is different in four notable
[1:42:04] ways
[1:42:06] the similarities with the talents
[1:42:07] parable are obvious first a rich man or
[1:42:11] nobleman leaves on a long-term trip
[1:42:13] representing jesus's ascension to heaven
[1:42:16] to be seated at the right hand of the
[1:42:17] father during the times of the gentiles
[1:42:20] second before leaving the rich man
[1:42:22] leaves three servants in charge of his
[1:42:24] money with the expectation they will
[1:42:26] carry on and grow his business until he
[1:42:28] returns
[1:42:30] third two servants are faithful with the
[1:42:32] entrusted goods while the third servant
[1:42:34] does nothing
[1:42:36] fourth the nobleman praises the two
[1:42:38] faithful servants upon his return and
[1:42:40] severely chastens the third unfaithful
[1:42:42] servant
[1:42:43] the fate of the third servant is not
[1:42:45] recorded in the pound's parable but he
[1:42:48] is called wicked just as the third
[1:42:50] servant from the talents parable
[1:42:53] the first difference is the group jesus
[1:42:55] is speaking to here in the pounds
[1:42:57] parable christ is addressing a multitude
[1:42:59] of jews who are under expectation that
[1:43:02] jesus is going to immediately overthrow
[1:43:04] the roman empire and institute the
[1:43:07] messianic government the jewish kingdom
[1:43:10] of david free from tyranny and foreign
[1:43:12] influence
[1:43:13] luke 19 verse 11 declares this saying
[1:43:16] and as they heard these things he added
[1:43:18] and spake a parable because he was nigh
[1:43:21] to jerusalem and because they thought
[1:43:23] that the kingdom of god should
[1:43:24] immediately appear
[1:43:26] jesus knows the messianic kingdom or his
[1:43:28] one thousand-year millennial reign upon
[1:43:31] the earth is over three thousand years
[1:43:33] in the future so he speaks this parable
[1:43:35] to correct the multitudes false hope for
[1:43:38] an imminent appearing of christ's
[1:43:40] sinless kingdom
[1:43:41] jesus directs their thoughts to a life
[1:43:43] of faithful service
[1:43:46] second the pound's parable shows the
[1:43:48] spirit of hatred the entire world has
[1:43:50] for christ and the truth of christianity
[1:43:53] jesus says the citizens hate the
[1:43:55] nobleman and send him a message saying
[1:43:58] they will not be ruled by him
[1:43:59] this represents the hatred the world has
[1:44:02] always had for christ
[1:44:04] jesus also warned his disciples they
[1:44:06] would be hated of all men for his sake
[1:44:08] in matthew 10 22.
[1:44:10] many religious groups publicly and
[1:44:12] boldly declare their hatred for
[1:44:14] christianity
[1:44:15] but a sad reality is that many churches
[1:44:17] who claim to be christians hate jesus's
[1:44:20] bible commands
[1:44:21] jesus teaches this in matthew 6 24
[1:44:25] no man can serve two masters for either
[1:44:27] he will hate the one and love the other
[1:44:30] or else he will hold to the one and
[1:44:31] despise the other ye cannot serve god
[1:44:34] and mammon truly many church members
[1:44:37] claim to love jesus but hate the bible
[1:44:39] commands against cussing drunkenness
[1:44:41] fornicating adultery lustful thoughts
[1:44:44] and dressing immodestly
[1:44:46] paul states the fact that homosexuals
[1:44:48] hate the knowledge of god these false
[1:44:51] christians have a form of godliness but
[1:44:53] hatefully deny the cleansing power
[1:44:55] thereof at the parable's conclusion all
[1:44:58] the citizens who refuse to let christ
[1:45:00] reign over their lives will be slain in
[1:45:02] front of him representing the second
[1:45:04] death when sinners are tormented with
[1:45:06] fire and brimstone in the presence of
[1:45:08] the holy angels and the lamb
[1:45:12] the citizens hate the nobleman because
[1:45:14] he wants to reign over them jesus is
[1:45:16] showing that he is king of kings and
[1:45:18] lord of lords and wants to exercise the
[1:45:21] highest influence and control over his
[1:45:24] beloved blood-bought creation
[1:45:26] but the majority of earth's inhabitants
[1:45:29] will not let christ's spirit reign over
[1:45:31] them choosing to let the law of sin and
[1:45:33] death rule their lives rather than the
[1:45:35] law of the spirit and life
[1:45:38] each person will be ruled by either
[1:45:40] death and disobedience or life and
[1:45:42] obedience as you love jesus and let him
[1:45:45] rule your life you reign in this life as
[1:45:47] a spiritual king and priest over sin
[1:45:50] the devil the world and the flesh
[1:45:54] the third difference is the amount of
[1:45:56] money each of christ's servants are
[1:45:58] given a pound
[1:45:59] again using gill and nye's work a
[1:46:02] biblical pound is equivalent to 75
[1:46:04] english pounds or 14
[1:46:07] 335 dollars and 70 cents in u.s dollars
[1:46:11] while this sum is more modest compared
[1:46:13] to the talents parable a jewish
[1:46:15] multitude listening to christ could
[1:46:17] easily relate to this realistic wage
[1:46:20] also this smaller sum matches jesus's
[1:46:22] description as a very little amount our
[1:46:25] lord congratulated the servants saying
[1:46:27] well thou good servant because thou hast
[1:46:30] been faithful in a very little have thou
[1:46:32] authority over ten cities
[1:46:34] jesus wanted this multitude to
[1:46:36] understand their amount of
[1:46:37] responsibility compared to his was very
[1:46:40] small but the reward would be very great
[1:46:44] christians should not feel overwhelmed
[1:46:45] or stressed about their stewardship god
[1:46:48] promises to never give us situations and
[1:46:51] temptations we cannot handle
[1:46:54] it's essential to notice this parable
[1:46:56] assigning each servant the same amount
[1:46:58] of money which greatly differs from the
[1:47:00] talents parable
[1:47:02] here money is equal which cannot
[1:47:04] represent spiritual gifts for gifts are
[1:47:06] not given equally not all speak in
[1:47:09] tongues prophesy or perform miracles so
[1:47:12] what is equal or nearly equal among
[1:47:14] christians the answer is an equal
[1:47:16] opportunity to love jesus in your home
[1:47:20] on your job around your family members
[1:47:22] with your money and more
[1:47:24] nearly every christian has a home family
[1:47:27] friends job and money
[1:47:28] while some christians are given more
[1:47:30] years to live than others all christians
[1:47:32] are given one lifetime one opportunity
[1:47:35] to love god and their neighbors
[1:47:38] jesus offers many examples of equal
[1:47:41] opportunity works every christian not
[1:47:44] just preachers can act upon thereby
[1:47:46] investing their pound in his glorious
[1:47:49] eternal kingdom including but not
[1:47:51] limited to
[1:47:52] withstanding persecution yields a great
[1:47:55] heavenly reward
[1:47:57] giving alms in secret yields an open
[1:47:59] reward
[1:48:01] praying in secret yields an open reward
[1:48:04] fasting in secret yields an open reward
[1:48:08] receiving a profit or righteous man
[1:48:10] yields a profits or righteous man's
[1:48:12] reward
[1:48:14] providing food drink shelter or clothes
[1:48:16] to a christian or visiting one when he's
[1:48:19] sick or in prison yields an entrance
[1:48:21] into eternal life
[1:48:23] giving an apostle a cup of water for
[1:48:26] christ's sake
[1:48:27] yields a reward
[1:48:29] loving your enemies blessing those who
[1:48:31] persecute you praying for those who
[1:48:33] despitefully use you and lending with no
[1:48:36] hope of repayment yields a great reward
[1:48:39] along with the title being called the
[1:48:41] children of the highest
[1:48:43] hosting a feast for the less fortunate
[1:48:46] who cannot repay you yields a recompense
[1:48:49] at the resurrection of the just
[1:48:51] fighting the good fight finishing the
[1:48:53] course and keeping the christian faith
[1:48:56] yields a crown of righteousness
[1:48:58] providing a christian's physical
[1:49:00] necessities a member of the household of
[1:49:02] faith yields a heavenly reward upon a
[1:49:05] giver's account
[1:49:07] doing anything heartily as doing it to
[1:49:09] christ yields the reward of the
[1:49:11] inheritance
[1:49:13] seeking god yields rewards
[1:49:16] enduring temptation yields the crown of
[1:49:18] eternal life
[1:49:20] visiting the fatherless and widows and
[1:49:22] keeping oneself unspotted from the world
[1:49:25] yields the reward of spiritual purity
[1:49:28] overcoming sin during any of the seven
[1:49:30] church ages yields the reward of
[1:49:32] inheriting all things or all the church
[1:49:35] age rewards eating the tree of life
[1:49:38] escaping the second death eating the
[1:49:40] hidden manna
[1:49:41] a white stone with a new name within
[1:49:44] power to rule over nations the morning
[1:49:46] star white raiment having your name
[1:49:49] remain in the book of life being a
[1:49:51] pillar in the temple of god having
[1:49:53] jesus's new name
[1:49:55] god's new name
[1:49:56] and new jerusalem's new name written
[1:49:58] upon him and sitting with jesus in his
[1:50:00] throne
[1:50:02] fourthly this parable gives a detail
[1:50:05] about one of christ's special rewards
[1:50:07] ruling over cities jesus tells the
[1:50:09] servant who had a tenfold increase upon
[1:50:12] his pound
[1:50:14] well thou good servant because thou has
[1:50:16] been faithful in a very little have thou
[1:50:19] authority over ten cities
[1:50:21] two supporting texts about overcoming
[1:50:23] saints
[1:50:24] ruling cities or even nations
[1:50:26] include revelation 2 verses 26 and 27
[1:50:30] and revelation 20 verses 4 and 6.
[1:50:33] in the first jesus says he will give
[1:50:36] overcomers power over the nations to
[1:50:38] rule them with a rod of iron
[1:50:40] this means his saints will be minor
[1:50:42] rulers underneath his own rule for
[1:50:45] scripture twice records jesus will rule
[1:50:47] all nations with the rod of iron
[1:50:50] in the second the blessed and holy
[1:50:52] saints who overcome the beast or rome
[1:50:55] live and reign with christ for one
[1:50:56] thousand years
[1:50:58] recall reign means to exercise kingly
[1:51:01] power
[1:51:02] additionally jesus promises his twelve
[1:51:04] apostles they will sit upon twelve
[1:51:06] thrones judging the twelve tribes of
[1:51:08] israel
[1:51:09] what wonderful blessings god has in
[1:51:12] store for those that love him now
[1:51:16] parable 15 the seed cast into the ground
[1:51:20] revelation god causes spiritual growth
[1:51:23] by invisible means but men observe it in
[1:51:26] three stages
[1:51:28] located in mark 4 verses 26 through 29
[1:51:32] this parable emphasizes three stages of
[1:51:34] growth in connection to the kingdom of
[1:51:36] heaven
[1:51:37] based upon jesus's words that the
[1:51:40] kingdom of god is within a believer in
[1:51:42] the form of the baptism of the holy
[1:51:44] ghost in a man's soul the three stages
[1:51:47] of growth refer to the three works of
[1:51:49] grace taught in chapter five
[1:51:51] justification sanctification and the
[1:51:53] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:51:56] jesus describes a man casting seeds into
[1:51:59] the ground the man goes about his daily
[1:52:01] routine of sleeping and raising as the
[1:52:04] seeds mysteriously spring up without him
[1:52:06] knowing how
[1:52:08] the earth jesus says brings forth the
[1:52:10] fruit of herself without the man's help
[1:52:13] next jesus lists the three stages of the
[1:52:15] wheat plant blade ear and full corn
[1:52:19] once the matured fruit is produced the
[1:52:21] man immediately harvests the grain
[1:52:24] this parable symbols are familiar but
[1:52:27] the sower has a different meaning
[1:52:29] previously the sower represented jesus
[1:52:31] the son of man but now he represents a
[1:52:33] blood-bought redeemed human preacher
[1:52:36] because he doesn't know how seeds grow
[1:52:38] and cannot cause seeds to increase
[1:52:40] but jesus knows about the growth of
[1:52:42] seeds for it was by him the word of god
[1:52:46] that all things including seeds were
[1:52:48] created
[1:52:49] jesus causes growth because his spirit
[1:52:51] is quickening power
[1:52:52] finite human preachers paul says are
[1:52:55] limited but are united as one in their
[1:52:58] efforts to both sow and water seeds
[1:53:00] first corinthians 3 verses 7 and 8 reads
[1:53:04] so then neither is he that planteth
[1:53:06] anything neither he that watereth but
[1:53:08] god that giveth the increase now he that
[1:53:11] planteth and he that watereth are one
[1:53:13] and every man shall receive his own
[1:53:15] reward according to his own labor
[1:53:19] observe jesus emphasis upon the fact
[1:53:22] that the man does not know how seeds
[1:53:24] grow he says the earth bringeth forth
[1:53:26] fruit of herself
[1:53:28] man plants and waters but cannot force
[1:53:30] seeds to grow
[1:53:31] god's creative growing process causes
[1:53:34] growth without the help of man
[1:53:36] paul says the same in first corinthians
[1:53:38] three verse 6 i have planted apollos
[1:53:41] watered but god gave the increase
[1:53:44] christian ministers labor with their
[1:53:45] human efforts but only god can give an
[1:53:48] increase of souls
[1:53:49] acts 2 verse 47 declares and the lord
[1:53:52] added to the church daily such as should
[1:53:54] be saved
[1:53:57] another point is to show god's growing
[1:53:59] power while men sleep
[1:54:01] god's spirit is always working whether
[1:54:03] you are awake or asleep and he can cause
[1:54:05] you to understand truth through dreams
[1:54:08] job 33 verses 15 and 16 says in a dream
[1:54:12] in a vision of the night when deep sleep
[1:54:15] fall upon men in slumberings upon the
[1:54:18] bed then he openeth the ears of men and
[1:54:20] seal of their instruction
[1:54:22] god changes situations through his ever
[1:54:25] working spirit as he works on your
[1:54:27] behalf even while you sleep
[1:54:29] psalm 30 verse 5 reads weeping may
[1:54:32] endure for a night but joy cometh in the
[1:54:34] morning
[1:54:36] just as in the wheat and tares the seeds
[1:54:39] represent genuine christians a man's
[1:54:42] soul receives the incorruptible seed
[1:54:44] word of god and experiences the baptism
[1:54:46] of the holy ghost first peter 1 23 says
[1:54:50] being born again not of corruptable seed
[1:54:53] but of incorruptable by the word of god
[1:54:55] which liveth and abideth forever
[1:54:58] notice that nothing is said of the tares
[1:55:00] no doubt every field would have tares
[1:55:02] but this parable is focusing only upon
[1:55:05] the wheat's three-stage growth
[1:55:07] and the immediacy of harvest time
[1:55:10] the parable's main lesson is that wheat
[1:55:13] grows in three mysterious stages
[1:55:15] representing how believers mysteriously
[1:55:17] but faithfully grow up in three stages
[1:55:20] just like the wheat growing process is
[1:55:22] certain christian maturity is a
[1:55:24] guaranteed process when the believer
[1:55:26] remains planted in christ's teachings
[1:55:29] when you delight in and meditate upon
[1:55:31] the word you are like a tree planted by
[1:55:34] the rivers of water that bringeth forth
[1:55:36] his fruit in his season his leaf also
[1:55:39] shall not wither and whatsoever he does
[1:55:42] shall prosper psalm 92 13 echoes this
[1:55:46] truth saying
[1:55:47] those that be planted in the house of
[1:55:49] the lord shall flourish in the courts of
[1:55:51] our god
[1:55:53] the three stages of christian growth are
[1:55:56] just as distinguishable as the wheat's
[1:55:58] three stages see figure 14 in chapter
[1:56:01] five look at paul's life for a clear
[1:56:03] example of the first stage justification
[1:56:07] or the wheat blade the blade is the
[1:56:09] narrow leaf that first springs forth
[1:56:10] from the soil just a few inches tall
[1:56:13] before the blade is visible there's no
[1:56:15] sign of life
[1:56:16] once the blade grows up there is visible
[1:56:19] proof of life
[1:56:20] before paul met jesus on the road to
[1:56:22] damascus he showed no signs of life
[1:56:24] spiritually speaking in fact he was an
[1:56:27] agent of death
[1:56:28] advocating for stephen stoning and
[1:56:30] making havoc of the church by entering
[1:56:33] christians homes
[1:56:34] and dragging them to prisons
[1:56:36] but after paul was blinded and humbled
[1:56:39] by a supernatural encounter with the
[1:56:40] light of christ ananias prayed for
[1:56:43] paul's healing and the scales fell from
[1:56:45] his eyes
[1:56:46] upon receiving his healing paul
[1:56:48] immediately arose and was baptized
[1:56:51] just like the wheat blade springs upward
[1:56:53] from the dark soil paul's new spiritual
[1:56:56] life arose upward out of his darkened
[1:56:58] condition of unbelief
[1:57:00] new life arose visible to all
[1:57:03] a new wheat plant named paul raised up
[1:57:06] justified from all his sins
[1:57:08] for the first time this new creature in
[1:57:10] christ was in plain view to all men
[1:57:14] jesus's 12 apostles are prime examples
[1:57:16] of the second stage of grace
[1:57:18] sanctification which corresponds to the
[1:57:21] wheat's second stage jesus calls the ear
[1:57:24] wheat plants grow quickly in the second
[1:57:26] stage
[1:57:27] spouting stems that range from two to
[1:57:29] four feet tall
[1:57:31] at the top of the stem is the head or
[1:57:33] spike of the wheat plant this is the ear
[1:57:36] jesus refers to the ear contains 35 to
[1:57:39] 50 grains or kernels of wheat but in the
[1:57:43] second stage they are green and need
[1:57:45] more time to mature
[1:57:47] jesus 12 apostles grew quickly in the
[1:57:49] faith leaving family and careers to
[1:57:51] preach two by two with miraculous
[1:57:54] healing power throughout judea
[1:57:56] the four gospels show they were green in
[1:57:58] many ways and needed to mature
[1:58:00] peter is a clear example because he had
[1:58:02] faith to walk on water but not long
[1:58:05] after erroneously rebuked jesus for
[1:58:08] foretelling his death and resurrection
[1:58:10] chapter 5 section called jesus 12
[1:58:13] apostles and the stature of perfect man
[1:58:15] details the apostles growth in the
[1:58:17] second stage of grace
[1:58:19] john 17 verses 12 through 19 records
[1:58:23] jesus's tender last supper prayer for
[1:58:26] his apostles in which he specifically
[1:58:28] prays for their future sanctification
[1:58:31] jesus plainly asked the father for their
[1:58:33] sanctification in john 17 17 saying
[1:58:37] sanctify them through thy truth thy word
[1:58:39] is truth
[1:58:41] after three and a half years of
[1:58:42] following christ the twelve apostles
[1:58:44] still needed more sanctification which
[1:58:46] they received after jesus resurrection
[1:58:48] and ascension when matthias had taken
[1:58:51] the place of judas iscariot
[1:58:53] the ear stage reached its conclusion
[1:58:55] during the ten days of prayer and
[1:58:57] supplication in the upper room in
[1:58:59] jerusalem the apostles became fully
[1:59:02] sanctified during this 10-day season of
[1:59:04] prayer
[1:59:05] scripture describes the believers as
[1:59:07] being in one accord on the truth of
[1:59:09] god's promise to send the baptism of the
[1:59:11] holy ghost
[1:59:14] the wheat's third and final stage is
[1:59:16] referred to as the full corn in the ear
[1:59:18] by jesus and corresponds to the third
[1:59:21] work of grace the baptism of the holy
[1:59:23] ghost
[1:59:24] in this final stage maturing wheat turns
[1:59:27] from green to straw brown and the
[1:59:29] kernels become swollen in heart
[1:59:32] previously in the second stage the
[1:59:34] kernel was soft and if pinched would
[1:59:37] emit a milky substance
[1:59:39] after standing long in the presence of
[1:59:41] the hot sun the wheat had nods or boughs
[1:59:44] signaling harvest time
[1:59:46] in the same way a holy ghost-filled
[1:59:48] christian is both beyond milk teaching
[1:59:50] and bows and submits to every word of
[1:59:52] the son of god
[1:59:54] hebrews 5 verses 12 through 14 records
[1:59:57] the author rebuking his hebrew christian
[1:59:59] readers for remaining immature
[2:00:02] milk-drinking believers
[2:00:04] the author says the believers had enough
[2:00:05] time to become mature bible teachers but
[2:00:08] instead need to re-learn the simple
[2:00:10] milky basic teachings of christianity
[2:00:13] strong meat the author writes belongs to
[2:00:16] them that are of full age who can
[2:00:18] discern good from evil
[2:00:19] holy ghost-filled christians are mature
[2:00:21] enough to handle deep teaching that
[2:00:24] discerns good and evil in their daily
[2:00:26] lives
[2:00:27] jesus's meat was to do the will of him
[2:00:29] that sent me and to finish his work
[2:00:32] mature christians also do the perfect
[2:00:35] will of god no matter how difficult it
[2:00:37] may seem
[2:00:38] immature christians
[2:00:40] not yet born again of the holy ghost
[2:00:42] still need basic milky teaching just
[2:00:45] like the immature wheat kernel that
[2:00:47] oozes milk when pinched concerning
[2:00:49] bowing paul writes like a mature bowing
[2:00:52] wheat head he bows his knees in prayer
[2:00:56] for the ephesian saints to be
[2:00:57] strengthened by the spirit in their
[2:00:59] inner man rooted and grounded in love to
[2:01:02] know the love of christ and to be filled
[2:01:04] with all the fullness of god
[2:01:07] peter says christians must submit or bow
[2:01:09] to every ordinance of man for the lord's
[2:01:11] sake unless men forbid christians to
[2:01:14] preach and teach in jesus name
[2:01:17] logically christians additionally submit
[2:01:19] to every word of god for god is so much
[2:01:22] greater than man jesus lived by obeying
[2:01:25] every word of god and spirit-filled
[2:01:27] christians follow his holy example
[2:01:29] the book of acts church serves as an
[2:01:31] example of the wheat's third stage after
[2:01:34] receiving the baptism of the holy ghost
[2:01:36] on the day of pentecost
[2:01:38] the saints bowed to none but christ
[2:01:40] even suffering martyrdom like courageous
[2:01:43] stephen and james
[2:01:45] more mature christians could not be
[2:01:46] found
[2:01:47] acts 15 26 says they were men that
[2:01:50] hazarded their lives for the name of the
[2:01:52] lord jesus christ their voices joined
[2:01:55] with paul's who said for me to live is
[2:01:58] christ and to die is gain
[2:02:02] the parable's final emphasis is upon the
[2:02:04] immediacy of the harvest once the weed
[2:02:07] is mature suggesting the imminent
[2:02:09] rapture of the bride of christ or new
[2:02:12] testament holy ghost filled church
[2:02:15] mark 4 29 says but when the fruit is
[2:02:17] brought forth immediately he putteth in
[2:02:20] the sickle because the harvest has come
[2:02:22] chapter 12 details the mystery of the
[2:02:24] rapture
[2:02:26] at this very moment god is still
[2:02:28] baptizing souls with the holy ghost
[2:02:30] around the world fulfilling jesus's
[2:02:32] great commission when the last
[2:02:34] predestined soul is born again the
[2:02:37] rapture harvest will begin
[2:02:39] using symbolism from the ten versions
[2:02:41] parable when the last wise virgin had
[2:02:44] arrived at the midnight wedding
[2:02:45] procession with her oil filled bright
[2:02:48] glowing lamp the bridegroom could
[2:02:50] immediately continue to his home for the
[2:02:53] remaining wedding festivities in the
[2:02:55] king sun parable the
[2:02:57] sun's wedding could commence once the
[2:02:59] last wedding guest was adorning the
[2:03:02] wedding garment and all those without a
[2:03:04] wedding garment were removed from the
[2:03:05] gathering
[2:03:06] christians still pray for the lord of
[2:03:08] the harvest to send forth laborers into
[2:03:10] his vineyard for harvest because there
[2:03:12] is still work to be done
[2:03:15] although some may become discouraged
[2:03:17] waiting for the rapture harvest jesus
[2:03:19] christ values your patience as harvest
[2:03:22] time nears
[2:03:23] james 5 7 reads
[2:03:25] be patient therefore brethren unto the
[2:03:28] coming of the lord behold the husbandman
[2:03:30] waiteth for the precious fruit of the
[2:03:32] earth and hath long patience for it
[2:03:34] until he received the early and latter
[2:03:36] rain
[2:03:37] each mature weak plant is precious in
[2:03:40] his holy site
[2:03:41] the lord of the harvest will not lose or
[2:03:43] leave behind a single kernel on a single
[2:03:46] wheat head
[2:03:47] jesus promises and this is the father's
[2:03:49] will which hath sent me that of all
[2:03:51] which he hath given me i should lose
[2:03:53] nothing but should raise it up again at
[2:03:55] the last day
[2:03:58] parable 16 the great supper
[2:04:01] revelation
[2:04:02] after most jews made excuses to reject
[2:04:05] it gentiles should accept jesus's
[2:04:07] compelling invitation to his great
[2:04:09] supper the marriage supper of the lamb
[2:04:12] located in luke 14 verses 15-24
[2:04:16] this parable emphasizes a great supper
[2:04:19] representing the marriage supper of the
[2:04:20] lamb that immediately follows the
[2:04:22] imminent rapture of the new testament
[2:04:24] church this parable closely resembles
[2:04:27] the king sun parable but differs in
[2:04:29] unique ways
[2:04:32] it's similar because a wealthy man is
[2:04:33] inviting everyone to a special event
[2:04:37] in the king sun parable it was a wedding
[2:04:39] but here it's a great supper in a house
[2:04:42] both parables contain three separate
[2:04:44] invitations from the wealthy man
[2:04:46] both describe various worldly
[2:04:48] motivations for rejecting the special
[2:04:50] event including farming viewing property
[2:04:54] selling merchandise and being a newlywed
[2:04:56] both parables serve as a warning and
[2:04:58] rebuke to the established jewish
[2:05:01] religious system of jesus time while
[2:05:04] offering hope to gentiles
[2:05:07] the parable's context is jesus speaking
[2:05:09] to a man
[2:05:10] at the house of achieve pharisee
[2:05:13] this man offers a seemingly pious
[2:05:15] declaration of the future blessedness of
[2:05:18] he who would eat bread in the kingdom of
[2:05:20] god
[2:05:21] in reality he expresses a false hope for
[2:05:23] the future while neglecting the present
[2:05:26] invitation into jesus spiritual kingdom
[2:05:29] jesus's sobering parable validates the
[2:05:31] man's insincerity christ who is the word
[2:05:34] corrects and discerns his empty speech
[2:05:37] by stating that those who eat in the
[2:05:39] future kingdom of god are those who
[2:05:41] forsake all without excuse to receive
[2:05:43] him now during their lifetime
[2:05:47] those first invited to the great supper
[2:05:49] represent the religious upper class jews
[2:05:52] pharisees and sadducees
[2:05:54] because judgment begins at the house of
[2:05:56] god the lord first invites those who
[2:05:58] claim to represent him and his kingdom
[2:06:01] this group makes three polite excuses to
[2:06:03] miss the great supper
[2:06:05] the first excuse is a man who purchased
[2:06:07] land and wants to go see it the second
[2:06:09] is a man who purchased oxen and needs to
[2:06:11] prove them
[2:06:13] the third is a man who recently married
[2:06:14] a wife these excuses can be categorized
[2:06:18] as chokers of the word mentioned in the
[2:06:20] sower and the foregrounds parable
[2:06:23] property work and marriage are cares and
[2:06:26] riches and pleasures of this life that
[2:06:28] choke the effects of god's word when
[2:06:31] given greater priority than christ's
[2:06:33] gospel
[2:06:35] feeling rejected the angered master
[2:06:37] sends a second invitation into the
[2:06:39] streets and lanes of the city to bring
[2:06:41] the poor maimed halt and blind to his
[2:06:45] great supper this group represents
[2:06:47] jesus's loving ministry to the lower
[2:06:49] class despised jews labeled publicans
[2:06:53] and sinners by the upper class group
[2:06:55] in matthew 9 verses 11-13
[2:06:58] christ says this group honestly assesses
[2:07:01] their spiritually sick condition and
[2:07:03] repents of their sins through god's
[2:07:05] mercy
[2:07:06] mary magdalene the immoral woman
[2:07:08] previously possessed of seven devils are
[2:07:11] examples of this lower class group
[2:07:13] brought into the great supper by
[2:07:15] christ's choosing
[2:07:16] james 2 verse 5 says hearken my beloved
[2:07:19] brethren hath not god chosen the poor of
[2:07:22] this world rich in faith and heirs of
[2:07:24] the kingdom which he hath promised to
[2:07:26] them that love him
[2:07:29] when the master learns there is yet room
[2:07:31] in his supper he sends a final
[2:07:33] invitation to the highways and hedges
[2:07:35] and charges his servants to compel them
[2:07:38] to come in that my house may be filled
[2:07:41] undoubtedly this invitation symbolizes
[2:07:44] god offering the kingdom to the gentiles
[2:07:47] who paul says were afar off but are made
[2:07:50] nigh by the blood of christ
[2:07:52] truly the gentiles were without christ
[2:07:54] being aliens from the commonwealth of
[2:07:56] israel and strangers from the covenants
[2:07:58] of promise having no hope and without
[2:08:01] god in the world
[2:08:02] jesus's great commission and peter's day
[2:08:05] of pentecost sermon both expressed the
[2:08:07] highways and hedges invitation
[2:08:09] christ says in mark 16 15 go ye into all
[2:08:13] the world and preach the gospel to every
[2:08:15] creature
[2:08:16] in acts 2 verse 39 peter teaches the
[2:08:18] holy ghost promise is unto you and to
[2:08:21] your children and to all that are far
[2:08:23] off even as many as the lord our god
[2:08:26] shall call
[2:08:28] compelling preaching is necessary to
[2:08:30] call and fill god's house or the
[2:08:32] marriage supper of the lamb event
[2:08:34] jesus says compel them to come in that
[2:08:37] my house may be filled
[2:08:38] preachers must constrain or pressure
[2:08:41] sinners to repentance water baptism and
[2:08:43] the baptism of the holy ghost with
[2:08:45] divine zeal
[2:08:47] ministers are offering eternal life and
[2:08:49] no greater gift could be preached
[2:08:51] god's loving heart longs for all men to
[2:08:53] be saved
[2:08:55] as he does not delight in the death of
[2:08:56] the wicked
[2:08:57] ezekiel 18 verses 31 and 32 captures
[2:09:01] god's heart saying
[2:09:02] cast away from you all your
[2:09:04] transgressions whereby ye have
[2:09:07] transgressed and make you a new heart
[2:09:09] and a new spirit for why will ye die o
[2:09:12] house of israel for i have no pleasure
[2:09:14] in the death of him that dieth saith god
[2:09:17] wherefore turn yourselves and live ye
[2:09:19] god passionately pleads for you to live
[2:09:22] for him
[2:09:23] despise death and love life
[2:09:25] paul's godly jealousy for the
[2:09:27] corinthians to live as spiritual chaste
[2:09:29] virgins to christ was just that god's
[2:09:32] own jealousy for his children's
[2:09:34] unwavering love and devotion
[2:09:37] the parable closes with christ pulling
[2:09:39] off the veil of his story
[2:09:41] revealing that he is the certain man and
[2:09:43] the great supper is his the lord says
[2:09:46] for i say unto you that none of those
[2:09:48] men which were bitten shall taste of my
[2:09:50] supper
[2:09:52] jesus declares it is my supper and no
[2:09:54] meal could ever taste so satisfying as
[2:09:56] his
[2:09:58] no excuse is sufficient for placing a
[2:10:00] secondary emphasis on the glorious
[2:10:02] gospel of the lord jesus christ
[2:10:05] being invited to jesus's wedding supper
[2:10:07] is the greatest thing that's ever
[2:10:08] happened to you
[2:10:10] knowing jesus his heart his desires his
[2:10:13] truth and his love
[2:10:14] is the one and only worthwhile
[2:10:16] relationship
[2:10:17] in ephesians 3 verses 8 and 9 paul calls
[2:10:20] this relationship the fellowship of the
[2:10:22] mystery or the intimacy of the mystery
[2:10:25] and he was privileged to preach among
[2:10:27] the gentiles
[2:10:28] the unsearchable riches of christ accept
[2:10:31] christ's invitation to receive the word
[2:10:33] of his kingdom now
[2:10:35] if you taste of his gracious word in
[2:10:37] this life and fully digest the scroll of
[2:10:39] truth you'll surely taste of christ's
[2:10:42] heavenly supper following the catching
[2:10:44] away of his bride the holy ghost filled
[2:10:46] new testament church
[2:10:49] themes of the sixteen parables
[2:10:52] it's helpful to see god's overarching
[2:10:54] themes in the 16 parable mysteries
[2:10:57] jesus's most emphasized theme is
[2:10:59] salvation justification
[2:11:01] or the first work of grace
[2:11:03] as five parables focus on his gracious
[2:11:06] redemption plan and free gift of eternal
[2:11:08] life the treasure in the field the pearl
[2:11:12] of great price the laborers in the
[2:11:14] vineyard the unmerciful servant the seed
[2:11:17] cast into the ground
[2:11:20] stewardship is the second most
[2:11:22] emphasized theme being taught in three
[2:11:24] parables because god delights in his
[2:11:26] children being accountable and
[2:11:28] responsible
[2:11:29] once the free gift of salvation has been
[2:11:31] received god wants his children to
[2:11:33] imitate him learning to be faithful
[2:11:36] focused and loving like his own divine
[2:11:38] character
[2:11:40] the three parables include the
[2:11:41] foregrounds the talents
[2:11:44] the pounds
[2:11:46] the eight remaining parables are
[2:11:48] categorized in pairs that share themes
[2:11:51] god establishes all his truths in the
[2:11:53] mouth of two or three witnesses the
[2:11:55] theme of being prepared for the rapture
[2:11:57] with the baptism of the holy ghost is
[2:11:59] seen in the two following parables
[2:12:02] the king's son the ten
[2:12:04] virgins
[2:12:06] the theme of the deceitfulness of sin is
[2:12:08] taught in the following two parables the
[2:12:10] grain of mustard seed
[2:12:12] the leaven hid in three measures
[2:12:16] the condition of mankind at the end of
[2:12:18] the world is described in the following
[2:12:20] two parables the wheat and the tares
[2:12:23] the net cast into the sea
[2:12:26] finally the theme of the jews and
[2:12:28] gentiles is taught in the following two
[2:12:30] parables the wicked husbandman
[2:12:33] the great supper
[2:12:36] the rewards for receiving the kingdom
[2:12:38] revelations
[2:12:39] those who receive the revelations of the
[2:12:41] kingdom of heaven during their earthly
[2:12:43] lives and continue living a faithful
[2:12:46] christian life will be the same ones who
[2:12:48] rule in the future when christ's kingdom
[2:12:50] comes down to earth
[2:12:52] jesus's words prove this for he said the
[2:12:54] mysteries were given to his disciples in
[2:12:57] mark 4 verse 11 and later told them that
[2:12:59] they would sit on thrones judging the
[2:13:01] twelve tribes of israel because they
[2:13:04] continued with him in his temptations
[2:13:06] not only do jesus apostles receive a
[2:13:09] kingdom to reign over but so does every
[2:13:11] true christian
[2:13:12] although the apostles reign will be much
[2:13:14] grander
[2:13:16] when you understand the kingdom of god
[2:13:17] during your life you are already both a
[2:13:20] king and priest unto god on this earth
[2:13:22] because christ loved you and washed you
[2:13:24] from your sins in his own blood
[2:13:27] colossians 1 verse 13 says you're
[2:13:29] already translated into the kingdom of
[2:13:31] his dear son
[2:13:32] of course you were also promised to
[2:13:34] reign in jesus future kingdom
[2:13:37] as a spiritual king now you reign in
[2:13:40] life by ruling over sin the world the
[2:13:42] flesh and satan
[2:13:44] like a king you're empowered with mighty
[2:13:46] weapons but yours are for spiritual
[2:13:48] warfare to cast down
[2:13:50] every evil or high thing that exalts
[2:13:52] itself against god's word and mortify
[2:13:55] every sinful deed of the flesh you are
[2:13:58] anointed to speak the word
[2:14:00] for the word is nigh thee even in thy
[2:14:02] mouth
[2:14:03] like jesus combatted and defeated satan
[2:14:05] by repeatedly declaring it is written by
[2:14:08] christ's spiritual power you control the
[2:14:10] three spiritual channels of temptation
[2:14:13] lust of the eyes
[2:14:14] lust of the flesh
[2:14:16] and pride of life
[2:14:18] not allowing sin to enter your life in
[2:14:20] order to keep yourself pure
[2:14:23] as a spiritual priest now god has called
[2:14:26] you to offer continual prayer praise and
[2:14:28] offerings to his great name fully
[2:14:30] armored christians are called to
[2:14:32] constant prayer by paul who said praying
[2:14:35] always with all prayer and supplication
[2:14:37] in the spirit and watching there unto
[2:14:39] with all perseverance and supplication
[2:14:42] for all saints
[2:14:43] it is through praying in the spirit not
[2:14:45] praying in the flesh that you build up
[2:14:47] your spiritual power for jude 1 verse 20
[2:14:50] says but ye beloved building up
[2:14:52] yourselves on your most holy faith
[2:14:55] praying in the holy ghost
[2:14:58] daily prayer in the holy ghost is the
[2:15:00] necessary spiritual workout needed to
[2:15:02] grow stronger faith just as a daily
[2:15:05] physical exercise workout is needed to
[2:15:07] grow stronger muscles
[2:15:10] as a spiritual priest you offer
[2:15:11] continual praise to jesus from your lips
[2:15:14] as hebrews 13 15 reveals by him
[2:15:17] therefore let us offer the sacrifice of
[2:15:18] praise to god continually that is the
[2:15:21] fruit of our lips giving thanks to his
[2:15:23] name in ephesians 4 verse 29 paul says
[2:15:26] let no corrupt communication proceed out
[2:15:28] of your mouth but that which is good to
[2:15:31] the use of edifying that it may minister
[2:15:33] grace unto the hears
[2:15:36] in your spiritual priest's office you
[2:15:38] offer both spiritual and natural
[2:15:40] offerings to god your spiritual offering
[2:15:42] is presenting your entire body and mind
[2:15:44] as a holy living sacrifice to god this
[2:15:48] is imagery of the old testament burnt
[2:15:50] offering a totally consumed sacrifice
[2:15:53] when you give your entire body and mind
[2:15:54] to christ being totally consumed by
[2:15:57] god's will it is a sweet savor unto god
[2:16:00] natural offerings include giving secret
[2:16:02] alms or donations to the poor the roman
[2:16:05] centurion cornelius was told by god's
[2:16:08] angel that the record of his alms were
[2:16:10] kept in heaven as a memorial before god
[2:16:13] proverbs 19 verse 17 says god views your
[2:16:16] donations to the poor as lending
[2:16:18] directly to himself and he promises to
[2:16:20] repay you
[2:16:23] if you receive the revelations of the
[2:16:24] kingdom now and rule over sin in this
[2:16:27] life christ will elevate you to rule in
[2:16:29] his future kingdom for john says we as
[2:16:31] kings and priests shall reign on the
[2:16:33] earth
[2:16:34] while our future reign has some mystery
[2:16:36] to it christ described how his faithful
[2:16:38] ones will be granted authority and
[2:16:40] rulership over many things including
[2:16:42] cities during the one thousand year
[2:16:44] millennium you read in the talents
[2:16:46] parable that your future reign is based
[2:16:48] upon your current faithfulness in your
[2:16:50] earthly labors if you're faithful in a
[2:16:52] few of christ's things he'll make you
[2:16:54] ruler over many jesus told the servant
[2:16:57] who made a 10-fold increase he'd have
[2:16:58] authority over 10 cities
[2:17:01] in revelation 2 verse 26 christ says and
[2:17:04] he that overcometh and keepeth my works
[2:17:06] into the end to him will i give power
[2:17:08] over the nations
[2:17:10] may these scriptures encourage you to
[2:17:12] keep investing in your spiritual gifts
[2:17:14] while investing your money into the
[2:17:15] kingdom of god this makes you an
[2:17:17] overcomer and christ has great rewards
[2:17:19] prepared for you may you abound in
[2:17:22] everything faith utterance knowledge
[2:17:24] diligence and giving paul's words in
[2:17:26] first corinthians 15
[2:17:28] 58 ring true therefore my beloved
[2:17:31] brethren be steadfast unmovable always
[2:17:34] abounding in the work of the lord for as
[2:17:36] much as ye know that your labor is not
[2:17:38] in vain in the lord
[2:17:41] the consequences for rejecting the
[2:17:43] kingdom revelations
[2:17:45] those who reject the revelations of
[2:17:47] god's kingdom become part of satan's
[2:17:49] kingdom of darkness and will eventually
[2:17:51] be eternally separated from the king of
[2:17:54] kings jesus christ each parable details
[2:17:57] the consequences of choosing satan's
[2:17:59] kingdom over christ's kingdom
[2:18:02] the sower and the foregrounds the
[2:18:04] consequence for the two types of
[2:18:06] unbelieving hearts our hearts completely
[2:18:08] void of god's word being seared confused
[2:18:11] useless and barren
[2:18:14] the wheat and the tares the consequence
[2:18:16] for a tear is a powerless and feigned
[2:18:19] impersonation of christianity that makes
[2:18:21] jesus sick to his stomach tears are
[2:18:23] burned in the lake of fire
[2:18:26] the grain of mustard seed
[2:18:28] the consequence of being part of the
[2:18:29] false church and her daughter churches
[2:18:31] is to be judged as a partaker in their
[2:18:34] evil ways sharing the guilt and judgment
[2:18:36] of their demon-filled assemblies
[2:18:39] the leaven hid in three measures a meal
[2:18:42] the consequences of eating the fully
[2:18:43] leavened bread or false teachings of the
[2:18:45] mother church include malice wickedness
[2:18:48] and insincerity making god three
[2:18:50] separate persons brings the consequence
[2:18:52] of being a liar and an idolater
[2:18:56] the treasure in a field
[2:18:58] the consequence of a man not trading all
[2:19:00] his possessions at the surprising
[2:19:02] opportunity to gain christ is being
[2:19:04] unworthy of jesus and the loss of his
[2:19:07] life
[2:19:09] the one pearl of great price
[2:19:11] the consequence of one not abandoning
[2:19:13] his search for many spiritual truths in
[2:19:15] order to gain christ is being ever
[2:19:17] learning but never able to come to the
[2:19:19] knowledge of the truth leading to the
[2:19:21] destruction of his soul
[2:19:24] the net cast into the sea the
[2:19:26] consequence of one being partially
[2:19:28] attracted to the gospel yet living a
[2:19:30] wicked iniquity-filled life will result
[2:19:33] in his soul's destruction in the lake of
[2:19:35] fire
[2:19:37] the unmerciful servant the consequence
[2:19:39] for one not forgiving others is jesus
[2:19:42] denying his forgiveness for a man's sins
[2:19:46] labors in the vineyard the consequence
[2:19:48] for not working in jesus vineyard is a
[2:19:51] loss of eternal life which is the equal
[2:19:53] reward god gives to all his kingdom
[2:19:55] laborers
[2:19:57] the wicked husbandman the consequence
[2:20:00] upon the unbelieving jews who rejected
[2:20:02] christ's kingdom is destruction but
[2:20:05] gentiles are issued the same warning in
[2:20:07] romans 11 verse 22
[2:20:10] the king's son the consequence for
[2:20:12] rejecting god's wedding garment or
[2:20:15] baptism of the holy ghost is enduring
[2:20:17] the awful tribulation period
[2:20:20] the ten virgins
[2:20:22] the consequence for not possessing extra
[2:20:24] oil or the baptism of the holy ghost is
[2:20:26] enduring the tribulation period and
[2:20:28] missing out on jesus's wedding the
[2:20:30] rapture
[2:20:32] the talents
[2:20:34] the consequence for neglecting jesus
[2:20:36] talents and resources is being called
[2:20:38] wicked and slothful and being cast into
[2:20:40] the lake of fire with weeping and
[2:20:42] gnashing of teeth
[2:20:44] the pounds
[2:20:46] the consequence for not investing
[2:20:47] jesus's pound is being called wicked and
[2:20:50] suffering the same lake of fire destiny
[2:20:52] as the talent's parable
[2:20:55] the seed cast into the ground the
[2:20:58] consequence of one rejecting god's
[2:20:59] three-stage growing process or three
[2:21:01] works of grace is becoming both a blind
[2:21:04] guide and liar as one will lead others
[2:21:06] away from the baptism of the holy ghost
[2:21:08] while offering potential converts false
[2:21:11] hope by telling them they are born again
[2:21:13] when they are not
[2:21:15] the great supper
[2:21:17] the consequence of gentiles rejecting
[2:21:19] jesus's compelling invitation to the
[2:21:22] marriage supper of the lamb will be
[2:21:23] suffering his chastening or wrath in the
[2:21:25] tribulation period
[2:21:28] conclusion
[2:21:30] christ has uttered a 16-fold revelation
[2:21:32] to his kingdom making it possible for
[2:21:34] you to accept his invitation into the
[2:21:37] kingdom that you might take your place
[2:21:39] in it may you submit to every word of
[2:21:41] your king now in this spiritual kingdom
[2:21:44] so that you are sure to be part of
[2:21:45] christ's future millennial kingdom what
[2:21:47] glorious rewards await us the kings and
[2:21:50] priests of jesus christ
[2:21:54] action steps to the kingdom of heaven
[2:21:57] step 1 if not done already repent in
[2:22:00] faith and be fully immersed in water in
[2:22:02] the name of the lord jesus christ seek
[2:22:05] to be born again by the baptism of the
[2:22:06] holy ghost which places you into the
[2:22:09] kingdom of god
[2:22:11] step 2 with holy ghost power from on
[2:22:14] high christ will help you redeem your
[2:22:15] time and lead you into your position in
[2:22:18] his kingdom revealing your talents and
[2:22:20] ministries
[2:22:22] step 3 periodically examine your
[2:22:24] position talents and ministries to be
[2:22:27] sure you are growing in stewardship and
[2:22:29] understanding you'll rejoice as you
[2:22:31] fulfill god's purpose for your life
