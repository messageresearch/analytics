word we say every breath we breathe lord god may it be for your glory father may you receive all the praise tonight as we approach your word in jesus christ's name amen galatians 3. like to look at um you know on sunday i said i'd like to do the bride tree but i think i'll save that for sunday i just today i kind of felt led to study on the blessings and cursing so i'd like to look at that again tonight so look at blessings and cursings part 2 tonight so let's go to galatians chapter 3. verse 6 galatians 3 6 and uh i don't have slides yet but i'll have slides later uh keisha just a moment as you're turning there galatians 3 6 i'd like to just share a quick testimony from ben narad you know we were he and i were texting my wife and i and him were texting in about the weekend and my wife said what a great time we had with ben's mom and brother ben said i was real happy she got to come with me he said i've been bragging about all of you no we don't want to brag but we know he means it in love but she told me coming home i wish i live closer i love that church and those people he said you folks made a wonderful impression on my mom thank you for that they've been through a lot with message churches throughout the years it was special to me to hear her say that so i know a little bit about what they've been through so i just want to encourage everybody thanks for your love to sister no rod i know when she walked in here she was really nervous and stoned really straight faced and by the time she was leaving she was i don't know if you saw when she was leaving she was asking if my girls could come and stay the night with her she could take some of my little girls home but she was so happy so thank you for the love you know that everybody pours out upon our our friends and our guests i just thought that was a nice testimony i thought my i thought the the saints would be happy to hear that by god's grace so let's uh go to galatians 3 6. i'd like to read a little bit of a portion tonight uh galatians 3 6. i'll read for a little while and then i think we'll read a few verses together by god's grace so let me read here verse six even as abraham believed god and it was accounted to him for righteousness know ye therefore that they which are of faith now that of course means assurance or trust and we know it means revelation so you can trust god right the same are the children of abraham all right so we look at ourselves not just as children of our parents but we are actually the spiritual children of abraham the father of faith and the scripture for seeing that god would justify the heathen through faith preached before the gospel unto abraham so god preached the gospel to abraham the good news saying in thee shall all nations be blessed verse 9 so then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful abraham verse 10. for as many are i'm sorry as are of the works of the law are under the curse for it is written cursed is everyone that continueth not in the things which are written in the book of the law to do them verse 11 but that no man is justified by the law and the sight of god it is evident for the just shall live by faith and the law is not of faith but the man that doeth them shall live in them let's read 13 together okay let's read that together on three one two three christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law being made a curse for us for it is written cursed is everyone that hangeth on a tree verse 14 that the blessing of abraham might come on the gentiles through jesus christ what is the blessing that we might receive the promise of the spirit the holy spirit through faith the blessing is the baptism of the holy spirit because peter said it's to you your children to them that are far off even as many as the lord our god shall cause god's still calling today then the blessing of abraham is still for us today amen may god add his blessings to remus word you may be seated praise god and occasionally i think you can switch over here so let's look at part two by god's grace tonight also real quick i did talk with the uh uh the missionary brother maxwell lee this week it's been a couple years since we talked but i just want to update you on him he's doing really well and uh they've been going down into south america and um i'm sorry they haven't i'm sorry this year they haven't because of covet he said but they're still getting reports back that the saints that uh they won to the lord the last year are still moving on he said they're getting many more baptisms and devils are being cast out and the sick are being healed and and even a chief even a chief of a tribe uh was baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and his testimony was this his testimony was he read the bible and saw every time the apostles baptized it was in the name of jesus christ and he said lord if this is true send me a preacher that's preaching it and a year later this missionary that i was talking to came to him and told him the true baptism and baptized him in the name of the lord jesus christ so just awesome to see that the book of acts is still going on praise god we got our little part here in akron but it's still spreading out around the world and we can do our part to pray we can do our part to send missionary offerings and spread the gospel of jesus christ praise god so let's uh let's look and see how jesus took again all the curses okay so we read galatians 3 and we saw how all the curses were placed upon jesus jesus became a curse for us praise god so if you have your bibles let's go to deuteronomy 21 uh verse 22 and 23. i'd like to read these again just to kind of refresh ourselves with these what a beautiful uh promise we have through the cross of christ deuteronomy 21 22 and 23 now verse 22 deuteronomy 21 22 and if a man have committed a sin worthy of death and he be to be put to death and thou hang him on a tree his body shall not remain all night upon the tree pardon me but thou shalt in any wise bury him that day for he that is hanged is a curse of god that thy land be not defiled which the lord thy god giveth thee for an inheritance okay so the bible clearly says any man that's hanged is cursed now we know jesus was hanged unworthily right uh he didn't do anything wrong but he became the sacrifice the curse for us and i believe brother simon preached that one time i thought it was a good thought that's the reason uh the bible said jesus could not be holden of death because he wasn't worthy of death right so death couldn't hold him but instead as an innocent sacrifice he took all the payment for death right and then because of that he could conquer over death i believe the bible said it was not possible that he could be held of death let me look that up real quick um i believe it was acts chapter 2. so let me see if i can uh yes it was acts 2 24. you don't have to turn there but the bible said whom god hath raised up having loose now isn't that interesting remember jesus said the bible said god raised them up but jesus said destroy this body and i'll raise it up well who raised up jesus which person of the trinity raised them up was it the second or the first it was neither it was the one and only praise god whom god hath raised up because jesus was god's image having loosed the pains of death because it was not possible that he should be holding of it praise god so death could not hold jesus it could not be a power overcome over him it could not master him it could not rule him it could not take seas of him praise god it could not hold him in his hand amen it could not continue to hold him because he was he didn't fit the qualifications right he didn't die uh worthy of it he died unworthy of it because he was a worthy sacrifice praise god and so because of that he was still cursed to be on a tree but he was actually taking our curse in other words you and i shouldn't be hung on a tree praise god you and i deserve to be hung on a tree but jesus took the curse and the bible said that jesus took the curse uh so that the blessing might come upon us through justification right and through the promise of the holy spirit amen so when we believe in jesus sacrifice the bible says that the blessing of justification comes upon us we're justified we're declared righteous from our sins and the blessing of abraham comes upon us amen let's read isaiah 53 because that's another great chapter i'll never get tired of reading this chapter by god's grace because it tells all that jesus did for me isaiah 53 1. and let's recall these i looked at them a few weeks ago but let's just look at them again verse one who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the lord revealed i'm sorry what the world is going on here sorry i'm turning this thing off i tried numerous times to turn turn off the wi-fi and everything forgive me verse 2 for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of a dry ground and has no form nor comeliness and when he shall when we shall see him there's no beauty that we should desire and i was telling a brother on uh youtube on the comments that he was saying was was jesus darker and what what kind of long hair did he have and i said well he was probably dark skinned right because most most jews were dark skinned with black hair i said he probably was but i said that really doesn't matter doesn't matter really how long his hair was but one thing about it is it wasn't beautiful it wasn't pretty right he wasn't an attractive man as we'd say he had no beauty that anyone even the common person the lowest of persons the poorest of persons he had nothing beautiful about him that we would desire now think about the people you know which one would you say there's no beauty in that person which one would you say right you and i we're common people we're middle class people which one of us would look at a lower class and say that person is really not beautiful at all we don't like to use the word ugly but which one we say they're probably not very beautiful right that's jesus jesus had no beauty that we would desire him and yet all the cartoons and the pictures make him so beautiful right yeah jesus had none of that he was despised and rejected a man a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we have seen him not you know there's many times church this summer i would go to certain stores and i'd see beggars right and we you know we have that first we have that first uh feeling to kind of like shun them right we want to hide our faces from them well this is what jesus says now we want to have an open heart right to uh we want to have an open heart to beggars and to the sick and everything like that but you know most of us feel that way when we see somebody who's really down and out they're dirty we know they're uh uh we know they're a beggar you know we want to hide our faces from them well that's what everyone did with jesus he had no beauty and we want to hide our faces we wouldn't want to look at him think about that the most holy person right the most god in flesh the most worthy person became so ugly that we didn't want to look at him now we're getting look we're looking at the curse right he became the curse so think about that next time you don't want to look at somebody may god help us to remember the reason we don't look at them maybe is because they're cursed and we could help them out of the curse right as we saw we all saw this we helped a couple of young brothers a few years ago get out of curses for a while but then they chose to go back in them remember we helped them get out for a while and they admitted to being out of it and being blessed but then they fell back into curses so that's real right it's real if somebody will come and believe us if someone will come and believe the bible as we're pointing the bible then they will come out of the curse right and they'll be blessed as long as they stay in the blessing as long as they choose to be in the blessing but see they hid our faces he was despised and we have seemed him not surely hath bore our grease and carried our sorrows yet we didn't seem him stricken smitten of god and afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions see he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed praise god see all of our transgressions all of our iniquities everything that we deserve to be cursed with he took the curse praise god but he was verse 6 all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way and the lord laid on him the iniquity of us all so as he as he hung on the tree god put all the curses on it think about that all the curses of adultery all the curses of of lying and stealing and murder think about i've been reading through the old testament think about all those murders the bible said all all the men and women that got killed by the edge of the sword that was common in the bible i've been reading i'm in kings right now the edge of the sword and this group died and that all the curses of all those were laid upon jesus as he hung on that tree because the bible said curse it is he that hangs on a tree and church it wasn't a surprise he knew he was going to get it he knew he had to face it and he tried to pray to avoid it but yet he humbled himself may god help us to humble ourselves right to serve god and not be afraid of maybe the pain that we're going to have to go through but trust god that if god called us to it then he can bring us through it praise god amen my all this iniquity was laid upon the iniquity of king saul right the iniquity of david the adulterer of david all the iniquity of noah's drunkenness that how you can name all of them right the iniquity of adam and eve right all their iniquity could be laid upon christ and the best part is be paid for praise god amen and be forgiven this is what jesus did taking all of the curses think about that the the mistake of eve being deceived into adultery and receiving the wrong seed all that was placed upon jesus he took her punishment we serve a mighty god hallelujah amen he was oppressed he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he's brought as a lamb to the slaughter as a sheep before her shears is dumb so he opened not his mouth even with your curses on him even with my curses on him he never complained did he he not he opened not his mouth he didn't complain and he even told the women he said don't cry for me he said he said be concerned about yourself right because one day this city will be encompassed about and pray that your flight be not in winter praise god he was so unconcerned about himself that he was even in the midst of carrying the cross or maybe having help at that time by simon the cyrene he was able to feel the pain for other people praise god may god help us to feel pain for other people right to put ourselves in other people's shoes that's what jesus did to take our curse that we might have this blessing today amen hallelujah he was taken from prison and from judgment who shall declare his generation for he was cut out i'm sorry cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people was he stricken he was cursed he was he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death because he had done no violence neither was there any deceit in his mouth now look at that church he didn't speak any deceit yet he got slapped in his mouth look at that his mouth was perfect but he got smote in the mouth didn't deserve it that's a curse when he when he was holy they treated him like he was unholy right and yet we say evil things and god is merciful to us right we don't get cursed we may get punished but we don't get cursed like long term we say we're sorry and that's the end of it now we may have to suffer a little bit of the consequences but yet he his mouth was perfect yet he got slapped across the face my verse 10 yet it please the lord to bruise him he hath put him to grief and when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed he shall prolong his days and his plea and the pleasure of the lord shall prosper in his hand he shall see of the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many how many justified tonight amen you ought to say amen loud to that how many justify tonight amen because of jesus because he took your curse you're declared righteous amen it's a legal action it's a legal exchange praise god god gave him our our curses and god gave us his righteousness amen he said justify many for he shall bear their iniquities bear their curses therefore will i divide him a portion with the great he's worthy amen and he shall divide the spoil with the strong because he hath poured out his soul unto death and he was numbered with the transgressors and he bear the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors hallelujah amen now look at that even with even with all the curses on him look at that church that proves his body had no sin in it even with the curses on him he said father forgive them they don't know what they're doing even with curses on him he prayed a blessing to them praise god think about that even though he's cursed he still blessed them and he interceded for them in the midst of his being cursed hallelujah and church sometimes some people have find it so hard to just say something nice about somebody they're upset with right because of a complex or because they did this to me years ago months ago weeks ago they can't even say one nice thing about that person and yet here's jesus all of your sin all of my sin on him and he still prays father forgive them that are that are crucify me they don't know what they're doing see look at that amazing love that's the kind of love that we need praise god that's the kind of love we should manifest to other people praise god amen he still interceded the bible said intercession for the transgressors intercessions for malachi smith praise god amen intercessions for lydia smith and acacia smith right to making intercession for you and i praise god he took your curse that you might be blessed amen hallelujah thank you jesus now look did he did he take all the curses yeah the bible said the lord laid the iniquity of all of us on him so that we can be blessed praise god now i want to finish deuteronomy 28 curses right we read a few so let's take your bibles let's go to deuteronomy 28 and i could use some readers malachi lydia casey if you got your bibles it's okay if you don't but if you got him i could use some reason i would like to finish this chapter you know i've been listening to preaching and teaching about blessings and curses and i think it'd just be great to read through all these just to have an idea remember church they had to listen to all these curses and blessings before they went in the promised land if you remember they had to admit as they crossed over jordan after they crossed over jordan they had to admit these are all the blessings and all the blessings will come upon us if we obey but if we disobey what's going to come on them all the curses when they cross the jordan they had to admit that remember that the remember the stones they had stones they had they had i think the hand of god wrote the law in those stones and they had to pass through and they had to accept god's blessings but also god's cursings all right so deuteronomy 28 now remember this quote uh really you don't need to chase the blessings what you need to do is meet the conditions god will take care of the blessings amen so i want to we did this already we read deuteronomy 27 a couple of sundays ago uh and we we looked at even verse 44 48 but i'd like to read 15 on and just kind of just kind of get an idea these are the conditions which will bring uh curses in the land okay so when we start with lydia lydia are you there hon can you read why don't you read 15 down to 20. every aspect of their lives would be cursed right the bible said all that their hand would do they'd find a curse in it if they didn't diligently hearken unto the ways of god their body their animals their jobs right everything they set their hand to do they would see a a curse in it they wouldn't see a blessing they'd see a curse malachi 21-26 please they shall persuade the lord shall cause you to be smitten before thy all right now you see we begin with pestilences right so that's like the coronavirus and i i made that little observation jesus prophesied pestilences would come remember that observation this uh coronavirus mostly affects the elderly and that would be the generation that actually turned down revival in 1956 it would actually be that generation that could be well i don't think it's coincidence but some people might say it is i just thought of that a few months ago but then also no doubt it affects the body and then the weather as well in the land and then uh their battles they would lose and look at america losing all these wars not really winning hardly anything right since uh world war ii they've hardly won anything is that right malka do you think of anything that they have won okay just some small operations yeah we know like with uh vietnam and different ones korea they never even won a war they just went in there and then left so interesting to see that now uh 27 in case you want to read something are you able to okay do you want to read 27 through 30. thou shalt be amen god had done such great things think about that he brought him out of egypt he's part of the red sea he brought him through the wilderness he brought him into the promised land i'm sorry he brought him to the borders of the promised land right and here he's telling them these blessings you get if you obey but these are the curses you get if you disobey it goes down to their marriages right they're animals uh uncurable diseases all right verse 31 thine ox shall be slain before thine eyes and thou shalt not eat thereof thine ash shall be violently taken away from before thy face and shall not be restored to thee thy sheep shall be given unto thine enemies and thou shalt have none to rescue them thy sons and thy daughters shall be given unto another people and thine eyes shall look and fail with longing for them all the day long and there shall be no might in thine hand no strength the fruit of thy land and all thy labor shall a nation which thou knowest not eat up and thou shalt be only oppressed and crushed always so look no victory now think about that church all the people that come to message churches and do they have the victory see we should have the victory if anybody has the victory it's those that are obeying the word of god praise god doesn't mean they're not without challenges right or battles but they're gaining the victory praise god but those under these curses are constantly the bible said being overcome no might in their hand they're only being oppressed and crushed always always losing they can't get the victory over temptation they can't just just can't get the victory that's a sign of a curse because of disobedience look at that verse 34 so that thou shalt be mad for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see look anger see anger anger despair look at all these curses uh bodily incurable diseases defeat on every side my and all this could be avoided if they just had reverence for god's word simple respect right simple respect just don't set up idols in your house right simple things very very simple things to do just worship give god a tenth right and then give god an offering just simple things talk to your children constantly about the word of god very very very simple things there's so much that could have been avoided if the people would have just obeyed diligently and hearken under the voice of god look at verse 35 the lord shall smite thee in the knees and in the legs with a sore botch that cannot be healed from the soul of thy foot unto the top of thy head but like how brother graham said i want the holy ghost from the top of my head to the soul of my foot amen praise god the curse comes upon the top of the head to the bottom of the feet for those who despise the word of god verse 36 the lord shall bring thee and thy king which thou shalt set over thee unto a nation which neither thou nor thy fathers have known and there shall thou serve other gods wood and stone and thou shalt become an astonishment a proverb and a byword among all nations whither the lord shall lead thee thou shalt carry much seed out into the field and shalt gather but little in for the locusts shall consume it thou shalt plant vineyards and dress them but shalt neither drink of the wine nor gather the grapes for the worm shall eat them thou shalt have olive trees throughout all thy coasts but thou shalt not anoint thy self with the oil for thine olive shall cast his fruit thou shalt beget sons and daughters but thou shalt not enjoy them for they shall go into captivity all thy trees and fruit of thy land shall the locust consume the stranger that is within thee shall get up above thee very high and thou shalt come down very low look at that there everybody else seems to be blessed and you're going down seem to be cursed he shall lend to thee and thou shalt not lend to him he shall be the head and thou shalt be the tale church we ought to consider a blessing when we can lend people some money right or food and really many times we shouldn't ask for it back jesus said verse 45 moreover all these curses shall come upon thee and shall pursue thee and overtake thee till thou be destroyed because not unto the voice of the lord thy god to keep his commandments and the statutes which he commanded thee and remember this beautiful verse down to 47 because thou serve us not the lord thy god with joyfulness and with gladness of heart for the abundance of all things there therefore shalt thou serve thine enemies which the lord thy god shall send against thee in hunger and thirst and nakedness and in want of all things and he shall put a yoke of iron upon thy neck until he have destroyed thee look slavery total addiction instead of complete freedom they're complete slaves oh he whom the son is set free is free indeed amen but these can't say that these this group can't say that because they've they they've cursed or they've cursed god they've rejected the very thing that brings them victory and because of that they're cursed lydia can you read uh talks about the nation that will come basically eat the fruit of all their lands and the fruit of their body go down to verse 53 lydia creed 53 uh to 50. why don't you go to 53 to 60. i'll give you a lot of reason because you're a big [Music] girl continuously those are some very uh detailed and very sad punishments and i read about them uh just last week in the second king uh that literally happened in israel now that was over uh 500 years after after this that these some of these curses would be so compounded after year and year of idolatry and disobedience and wickedness that they would stoop to the very depths of these curses and that would be a sign that they were cursed they were not diligently seeking god they weren't serving god with joyfulness and gladness of heart oh i'm so glad i can come to church and smile and praise god and be happy because it's a joy to serve god it's not a it's not a grievance it's a joy to serve god amen but for them it wasn't it was a it was a pain to serve god it was a bother to serve god for them and so god let them uh suffer the punishments verse 61 also every sickness and every plague which is not written the book of this law them will the lord bring upon thee until thou be destroyed look at that even the things that aren't in here you're going to inherit right because of disobedience verse 62 and ye shall be left few in number whereas ye were as the stars of heaven from multitude because thou wouldest not obey the voice of the lord thy god what does it all come down to obedience joyful obedience right obeying god even when it's hard but doing it with love in your heart knowing that god has a purpose he may not show me now but someday he'll show me and i know god cannot make a mistake god plans everything perfect perfectly and his purposes are sure and amen hallelujah thank god verse 63 and it shall come to pass that as the lord rejoiced over you to do you good and to multiply you so the lord will rejoice over you to destroy you and bring you to naught and ye shall be plucked from off the land whither thou goest to possess it and the lord shall scatter thee among all people from one end of the earth even unto the other and there thou shalt serve other gods which neither thou nor thy fathers have known even wood and stone i'm just going to stop real quick i was looking at the news recently and i forget which country was in africa just made a deal with israel and israel is going to pay the money to fly all the israelis from that african country back to israel in other words we still have saints coming back to israel praise god there are still some of the 144 000 coming back praise god that's what we're waiting on praise god we're waiting on on all the 144 000 to get in israel we're still waiting on the message to get to every nation and when everybody gets in their place then jesus will get in his place at that meeting in the air praise god amen but everybody has to be in their place hallelujah verse 65 malcolm kingdom 65 to the end please the lord shalom foreign all right thank you quite a quite a chapter isn't it church you start off with uh how many blessings start off with blessings in the first 14 verses and the rest of the chapter goes through all the cursings as we read through there now i want to um remember let's just summarize the blessings again just summary if you obey god diligently he would exalt you right because he exalts the humble oh you have spiritual reproduction physical reproduction you have health victory you're the head not the tail and you're above not below all those blessings just for lovingly coming to church and serving god every day every every time you go to church and happily praising god in your house and the church said oh that's all just for just wanting to please god with a loving heart a glad heart a joyful heart god promises you all the blessings amen he said so much you can't even contain it i'll pour out the blessings from heaven now we just read through the list i didn't get a chance i wanted to list all of them i didn't got a chance i just thought we'd read it now i want to bring this up here before we move on i was listening to a minister of preaching he's uh and he had many years of experience with blessings and curses he gave another independent list so i think a lot of these though can be connected to deuteronomy 28 mental breakdowns have you ever heard of a mental breakdown i've known pastors have had mental breakdowns that could be a curse because someone wasn't diligently obeying the word lord and remember we just read that sorrow of mine remember that sorrow of mind it was right there in verse 65 a trembling heart no ease your heart's not stable you're nervous all the time heart trouble heart disease sorrow of mind so this minister uh of the p the preacher passed away but he said mental breakdown chronic sickness especially if they're headed hereditary because the the blessings go from generation to generation but also the curses go from generation to generation also when doctors cannot find a cause for a sickness it could be a curse it could be something somebody else did or something they did down the line further down the line female trouble we saw this baroness was a curse right not not being able to have babies was a curse miscarriage tendency that's all what deuteronomy says yeah so female trouble divorces and family breakups remember the bible talked about your children will be taken from you sold in slavery see divorces uh that's a cause of a curse i think about my family i feel like this church i feel like my parents are under a curse i'm going to be praying that god will show me so we can help deliver them from the curse right i believe that with all my heart uh family breakups and everything like that but i thank god that although you know my parents may be under it i know our uh the siblings have overcome it by the blood of jesus christ i believe that with all my heart because we're all still married we all have families and everything like that god's blessing is upon our lives financial insufficiency remember he said you'll plant all kinds of seeds but you'll hardly reap anything church you know you know people people can't some people can never get ahead with finances now it may be a test like it may be a test like lazarus right the poor the the beggar he was a child of abraham because he went down to abraham's bosom he was saved it could be a test like that but if people just can't have financial blessings year after year after a year it's time they go searching their lives right and see are they diligently hearkening to the word of the lord are they obeying god's word or not people that are accident prone the same accidents happen again and again and again they just can't seem to get the victory suicide and unnatural death tendencies uh when when people die in families and it just seems so strange or it seems unnatural it's a time for people to seek god right it's a time to ask heaven why the church i don't know i don't know about this but let me just be honest most message churches i've gone to over the years not all of them but many of them you can feel the people are in a backslidden condition i don't know about you but the ones that many many of the ones i go to you can almost feel it you can almost feel and then you know when when you preach repentance thankfully some many people sometimes lots of people come up for prayer because they're already in a backslidden condition right so when as a minister when you see that the church is calling on god they're not pawn like that one time i recently preached uh and i preached was really really preaching hard on you know the lust of the eyes and everything like that and a young man come up and he confessed that he was doing uh he was doing pornography himself with this with his brothers and sisters and you wonder and and find out the whole family's under a curse the whole family is under a curse it's broken up with the law and children are taken away by uh lawyers and everything it's it's just so unnatural and you can feel that you and people will sit in churches and yet some of those i even talk to his parents later on and they'll quote brother branham and they'll quote all these things but then when i'm talking to them they try to correct me like i don't know more about it which i'm not trying to know more about it but the fact is we all know the curse is on the family and yet the leader of that family is trying to rebuke me and correct me and teach me which i can be taught i want to learn but if you can see a curse is upon a family then you you you know then that person needs to humble themselves and seek god's face and stop trying to correct people and try start trying to see how god can correct them because the curse is upon them and that just struck me tonight i didn't think about that until i was preaching it i'm have to tell the pastor about that family because the family's broken up uh there's all kinds of sexual sins and everything like that uh it's just awful just awful now i want to um i want to look at a few things here let's see i don't know if i want to get to that quite yet i might say that to the end here yeah i think i'll say that to the end let me uh scroll down here i'm going to skip down to uh some new ones i haven't really preached yet i marked it with a symbol so i wouldn't miss it like a a star so just wait yeah there's a star okay i just i wouldn't want to miss it on my notes okay so all right so let's look at some more we read that now let's look at this one here some of these may surprise you church some promised land blessings and curses i didn't have time like i think i'm in exodus 21 17 right now that's where i'm at i'm going through the whole bible with curses i went through all the new testament now i'm going through the old testament now he said and joshua observed them at that time say cursed be the man before the lord that rises up and builds this city jericho he shall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn and his youngest son shall be set up the gates of it now i don't know did you know this joshua cursed the man that would rebuild jericho and then in first kings 16 hundreds of years later a man did rebuild it and these exact things happened to him so see church we got to be careful what we do we have to be we need to know what god's word is blessed and we didn't know what god's word is curse praise god let's go to first kings let's read that first king 16 34. so you can see it first kings 16 34. if brother branham has cursed something then let's stay away from it praise god everybody everybody can say amen to that if a prophet joshua cursed something even in passing he don't even uh you don't even say thou sayeth lord did he say thus saith the lord in this scripture no he just pronounced the curse all right first kings 16 34. now this is in the days of uh ahab i believe yeah verse 34. in his days did heiel the bethlehemite build jericho he laid the foundation thereof in abaram his firstborn and set up the gates thereof in his youngest son sigub according to the word of the lord which he spake by joshua the son of none so that was in uh bc 925 let's see when joshua spoke that i didn't get the exact number of years but let's look at that just because i they got that nice feature in my scopia bible where you can see the number of years okay so is 14 wow 1451. yes over 550 years later 550 years later joshua said curse is a man that rebuilds it his sons will die and that's exactly what happened how many believe god's word is inspired whether it's got thus saith the lord behind it or not this don't have they'll say the lord is certainly inspired but this he just said cursed be this man before the lord just a prophet issuing a curse it was inspired and the man's family the man's sons died and when he rebuilt jericho so see some more promised land curses then there was a famine in the remember i mentioned this a few weeks ago when there was a famine in the days of david three years can you imagine church three years three years do you even can you even name one thing you did in 2017 three years ago can you even name i have a hard time thinking about what happened in 2017. well for three years it was famine it didn't rain in israel during the days of david and yet he was a man after god's own heart wasn't he year after year and david inquired the lord finally david said lord why is this happening and the lord answered it is for saul and for his bloody house because he slew the gibeonites and so notice israel as a nation god deals with them as a nation was punished for saul's bloody rule verse 3 shows david trying to make atonement a church this is why i believe america still has blessings because we're not judged by as a nation we're judged by individuals now you all know what happened what's happening in california they're having the worst fires that's ever happened now they may be cooling down now i haven't heard much about it but in 2020 they just went through the worst fires and burnings and loss of population they've ever had why because god's going to sink that place right because of all the evil there well look at all the i think about this look at all the blessings in ohio look at all the good message churches we got in ohio we've got at least a handful isn't that interesting so see their israel is by nation but whereby individual and look at the blessings god has bestowed upon us i just think it's striking i really do and in my in my lifetime church i can only think of a couple really bad summers where we had droughts 1988 was one of them i remember that a couple years ago we had a pretty bad drought but i mean it wasn't it's not like we were short on water or anything you know the rain the snows came and and uh bless us later on but look at that three years can you imagine three years no rain and lack of food and why is it because a curse for a man who just killed a family a group of giving knights the curse rested upon the people for three years now didn't the bible say the blessings go from generation to generation so do the curses this went from saul to the next generation and could david stop it no he couldn't stop this one interesting now this is quite a story this is one of the most uh i'll say it like this uh this was a fresh revelation here's what he says and again listen the anger of the lord was a kin was kindled against who israel so what did god do god moved david against them to say go number israel and judah do you remember this story how many people how many men died in this story remember 70 000 men died now we've had what over 220 000 from coronavirus in america with this pestilence it only lasted three days three days and seventy thousand people died we've had chronovirus wetford march april may june july august of dem rock film eight months right and it's more than it's almost tripled it right it's tripled it almost but this was seventy thousand remember god gave david three choices the prophet gave him three choices either your family or i think it was like six months of plagues or three days and david's like three days three days now church we're not going to read the whole story tonight because i i want to finish in a little bit but here is this was a revelation to me god never works outside a freemore agency and the church said nor can he tempt uh that should be he nor can he tempt man so god can't tempt david right so it looks like god is moving david it's like god's making him sin but that's that's just a figure of speech god can't tempt david so church this means god god was going to foresee david backsliding god knew david was going to backside he wanted in pride he wanted to number the people so god was going to work through by his foreknowledge work through david's backsliding to punish israel for their long-term backsliding can you imagine that isn't that powerful that blew me away what a fresh revelation that god he can't work outside a freemore agency so to punish israel he had to wait for a time when he knew david was gonna backslide and then use that to punish israel so church let's have this in our heart god will never punish those that have integrity of heart right is that what god told the king the philistine king he said i've seen the integrity of your heart that you didn't want to sin against me right so i kept you from sinning against me god will never make god will never lead or tempt any man who really wants to do what's right god will never let him do wrong because he wants to do right hallelujah so what does that mean if you and i want to make the rapture and we really do want it with sincerity god's gonna make a way for us amen if we've got integrity that means we really want it my that was so striking to me wow it looks like god is moving david but god wasn't god knew david wanted to backslide so god allowed it to happen he let satan tempt him right so see he he must have known satan accused and david there he said go ahead just like he would joke go ahead and accuse go and attempt david with that because i've got to punish israel for their wrongdoings as well so in other words there's nothing wrong with god god is fair god is just and the church said praise god that's a that is that's beautiful that came to me last week i wanted to preach it last sunday but i wasn't preaching we had a good time in the lord though wonderful time in the lord now here's another one church where a lot of people fail today they trust in the economy rather than god thus saith the lord look at that no there's a good thing i'll say the word right there cursed be the man that trusts in man see who are you trusting are you trusting your boss are you trusting the government for social security is that is that who our trust is really in the bible said cursed is the man that trusts in man and makes his flesh his arm and whose heart dependeth i'm sorry departed from the lord for he shall be like the heath which like a tree or bush in the desert and he shall not see when good cometh but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness in assault land and not inhabited now church does that sound like nebuchadnezzar remember when god had to humble nebuchadnezzar he wasn't out in the desert but he was out with the beasts right because he was trusting in himself he said i've done this kingdom this is my work and god said it's not blessed is the man that trusteth in the lord and whose hope is in the lord aren't you glad you're trusting the lord tonight are you trusting in jesus christ tonight amen that's the only one we can trust and praise god even if uh the socialists win the election in november right even if even if they win november our trust is not in who wins in november our trust is who is who's already won up in heaven praise god he won a long time ago praise god he won when he defeated death and resurrected hallelujah amen our hope is in jesus christ like they want to say they want to say store up food right they say store foods soar up guns concentration camps right they try to get everybody to be afraid but it's a curse of trust in man it's a curse of trust in the government we put our trust in god and god will make a way he'll provide he'll protect all glory to god god knows all things god is with us he's not against us god's blessing will be with his people praise god amen i think i'll hold off on that one let me go back up and i'm going to close with this uh already preached about an hour man where's the time go let's close with uh sometimes how objects are connected to cursings okay all right passes already sorry no i didn't yeah sure sometimes objects are connected with cursings let's close with that because i think it has a as a really nice closing for us to think about here okay so first of all how do you remember the story well before that when we talk about curses on objects it's not the physical object really that has the curse but it's the individual's acceptance of the curse right it's kind of like water at baptism water doesn't save you it doesn't have any power of its own right but it's the it's the blessing that comes from being baptized from obeying god's word right so the blessing is not really in the water the blessings in the obedience well so it is with the curses right like there's a story of a man of a preacher that had he had dragons up on his walls right because his grandpa went to china visited china bought these dragons and he put him up on his wall and then the preacher said that he could never get ahead financially and then the holy spirit said you've got dragons on your wall who does a dragon represent whose dragon represent revelation 12 9 satan he said get rid of him although it hurt the preacher's heart he took down the the dragons his grandpa he loved his grandpa who passed away got rid of him and he said the next year he didn't change anything and his finances his income doubled and he didn't change anything that's quite a testimony but you understand it's not the dragon that's that has the spirit right it's it's it's accepting something that hasn't that has an evil connotation to it right it's the connection it's not that physical object but it's accepting something and oh this would look good in my house and not really realizing what comes with that okay so i just want you to see that it's just like those swine remember the swine that jesus sent the demons into the swine there's nothing really wrong with the swine right it's the spirit that comes upon the swine same thing with pictures and objects right it's not really the object but it's the spear that comes along with it if you accept it okay like here's a good example like i didn't put up there but how many ever heard of the ouija board well i never played it but we had some preachers that uh played it and then when they were sinners but got delivered and they testified that god's brought them out of the occult i don't know if you remember that children or not but we have had a preacher share that with us and he's got the victory over it and god's done great supernatural things afterwards in his ministry but anyways when you do the ouija board you have to admit and open yourself up to contacting demons and spirits well there's nothing the board itself doesn't have that but it's when you open yourself up to those spirits right through the board but it's not the board itself it's the spirits that come with the board right it's the spirits that come with you with someone trying to talk to demons okay so does that make sense i hope i said the right way i hope everybody understands that all right now here is a a good example brother braham told a couple to burn a shirt to deliver their child from epilepsy i remember that story so there when a couple had a child that had epilepsy brother man said go burn the shirt and when they burned the shirt the epilepsy left so that that proves that family must have had uh some connection they must have accepted some lie or they must have accepted some disease that came along with that clothing it wasn't the clothing itself but it must have been some sickness that came along or the epilepsy through that shirt or through something they'd said or something they'd done because a shirt is not a demon right a shirt is not a demon can we all say amen to that too but the shirt represented something they need to repent of right and there could have been a spear that spirit followed that shirt maybe that maybe someone cursed that shirt and they gave it to the family it could have been that but it wasn't really the shirt it was something they accepted and and they might have just opened themselves up to it not really thought oh this person our family gave us can i say like this a disney shirt can i just say it like that because a disney shirt might have a curse on it right especially if it's got a half naked women on it right or woman on it right or a murderer like a character who's a murderer on it might have a spirit on it now brother brooks said one of his children had epilepsy and they took the shirt that was on the child and burn it and the epilepsy left the child we know another couple that said the same thing though but that didn't bring the victory so it goes like this uh we have to find god's leading for every healing every healing won't be the same does everybody understand laying you know anointing people with oil that won't work every time right that's not because there's nothing in the oil right it's just through obeying god's plan god's will so i want you i want you to balance that out not every time somebody fast are they going to get the answer but you can get the answer through fasting right you can get a answer to prayer through fasting and i'm going kind of long serious so let me finish up i only got a couple more slides all right next one now notice cursed objects come in houses and then the house can be cursed that's what we're talking about earlier with the the picture of dragons the graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire thou shall not desire the silver or gold that's on them nor take it to thee lest thou be snare therein for it is abomination the lord thy god neither shalt thou bring an abomination into thine house lest thou be accursed thing like it but thou shalt utterly detest it and thou shalt utterly abhor it for it is a cursed thing at church this the sad thing is many of our curses today are on phones right and tablets and i don't know it'll be up to god if that person has to get rid of the tablet or just get rid of the lust in their heart because clearly anything you allow in your house that's cursed makes you cursed praise god punished if you accept sin in your house you have to suffer the punishment of it okay like i know the one preacher who fell away from the message he let his children bring rock and roll into the house and then his eye one of his eyes went crooked afterwards i don't know if you knew that sister one of his eyes went crooked afterwards and he's on medication he's got all these health problems i don't know if that is but it sure looks like it is he invited rock and roll and then his children one of his child is divorced now and married a second time all the all the women in their family cut their hair where wear short shorts and pants now but look at that he let rock and roll and rap into his house and it got to the place when he was still pastoring in the message his teenage children wouldn't even sit in the sanctuary they had to sit in the pastor's office and wouldn't even hear the word of god that's how bad it was that's that's how much that rebellious spirit had accursed their house i don't know about you but i don't want curses i want blessings on my house praise god i want my children to rejoice in the word of the lord amen hallelujah i don't want to hide them from the word i want them to rejoice in the word amen with joyfulness and gladness of heart but that's in the message that happened the message see you let a curse in it's going to curse your house all right i'm almost done i'm close with it i'm closing with this last one church did you know this there's a connection to communion with blessings and curses remember this it's not the bread and wine that has the curse on it it's the disobedience if people eat it and drink it unworthily remember the scripture let a man examine himself because if he eats and drinks unworthily it's damnation to himself not discerning the lord's body now how many people in the corinthian church had curses on them anybody read that out loud this is the same church that had that man sleeping with his stepmom same church this wasn't a few people in the church that had curses many of them had curses and because they didn't because they they took the bread and the wine without repenting of their sins they got weak and sickly doesn't that sound like the promised land does that sound like the promised land church don't you know we're in the promised land praise god the spiritual promised land amen isn't that something isn't that striking to you that's striking to me that if if people when i when i break that bread sister beatrice if they didn't examine their hearts that'll be a curse to them and they might get sick and they might even die because they don't judge themselves you say it's a curse brother jesse yeah brother brahm said so he says what are you you're a christian you live before everybody as a christian if you take that communion and don't live as a christian you're not discerning the lord's body you're putting a stumbling block in somebody else's way see as they see you trying to do that and then not living what you're supposed to live see you're not discerning the lord's body now watch it what the curse of it is watch the curse of what it is let's stand to our feet praise god i better stop brother branham call it a curse we'll read the quote we'll read this other quote on sunday church communion has a blessing or a curse musicians you can come by god's grace [Music] let's meditate on that as we're just as we close and ultimately dismiss that we are in the promised land we're in a spiritual promised land and every decision we make can either be a blessing or a curse if we let cursed things in our homes there's going to be some curse in our home it could be something upon our body it could be a broken family it could be a mind battle right it could be a mental breakdown sorrow of heart it could be a heart trouble all because we don't judge the word the right way and we allow something cursed to enter in and that curse or that sin that comes in is the evil spirit and that evil spirit begins to destroy the house how many want a peaceful house how many want to judge themselves worthy of the gospel that's my prayer that's why i want that more than anything else god's blessings to be upon me uh we just pray that song the lord the blessing lord bless you and lord keep you make his face shine upon you let's have a word of prayer how many would say brother just pray for me that i'll keep everything cursed out of my house and my house will be blessed god bless the hands i'm not even opening my eyes here tonight but i'm sure every hand would be up even those that are at home even those that are here on the archive just raise your hand let there be a reaction on earth let there be a reaction in your life to the word of god i respond to the word
