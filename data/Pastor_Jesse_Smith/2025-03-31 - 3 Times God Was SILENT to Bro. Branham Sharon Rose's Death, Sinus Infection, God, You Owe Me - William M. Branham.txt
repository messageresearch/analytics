TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] and still he won't move. Seems to set silent. That's when you've got to be sure that he is God. Don't be discouraged. Greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of this video is to look at three times when God's prophet, brother William Brham, felt God was setting silent or laying silent as he says it in the sermon, Be certain of God from January 1959. Every requirement that God has made or asked, we have met that requirement. And yet he lays silent. He just won't answer us. I'm sure that I'm speaking to people this morning who's come to that place. I've been there many times myself. When I went back and traced my life and turned over every stone and I'd find that I did something wrong, I'd go confess it and say, "Lord God, I'll make it right and go do so. Then come back again and say now Lord thy God you'll answer me surely I met every request that you required me to do and every requirement I have met it and still he won't move seems to set silent that's when you've got to be sure that he is God don't be discourageed encouraged. The only thing is it in your heart to be certain of God. Of course, this has a Bible foundation. So, we'll start with the Bible foundation of how sometimes God doesn't answer our prayers right away. It seems like God is being silent, but of course, God promised he would never leave us nor forsake us. according to Hebrews 13:5 and 6. For he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee, so that we may boldly say, the Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me. So, the Bible foundation of the truth that sometimes God is silent in order to test us or to try us. There's at least four examples. I'm sure there's many more in the scripture, but the one brother Brandham uses is the widow at Zarapath from First Kings 17. She likely waited two or two and 1/2 years until God sent her Elijah. She thought she and her son would die according to First Kings 17:12. And I'm just paraphrasing, but she told Elijah she was going to gather the sticks, use the remaining oil and flour that she had, bake and eat the final cake, and then she and her son would die. So, it seems like God was silent to this widow for about 2 or 2 and 1/2 years. But then God answered her through the prophet of God. Second, the three Hebrew children, we'd say, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, God was silent in the sense that God didn't tell them that he was going to save them from the fiery furnace. In Daniel 3:17, they said, "Our God is able to deliver us. But in verse 18, but if not, be it known unto thee, oh king, we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image. So apparently for a short amount of time, God was silent, but then God showed up. He didn't send another angel, as brother Ram dramatizes, God showed up in the midst of the fire, the fourth man in the fire, one likened to the son of man, the Lord Jesus Christ, in his theophony form. Third, uh the prophet Jacob in the book of Genesis, he didn't know Joseph was alive for many years. One estimate is about 22 years. It seemed like God was silent and God did not tell him that his son Joseph was alive in Egypt. And brother Ram said God only tells his prophets what he wants them to know. God doesn't tell them everything. See, God don't tell his prophets everything. He just tells them what he wants them to know. See, God was working out a plan then and he had to work in it. God will, if you'll submit yourself to God, God will make you work right into his plan. And then the fourth example is Job. Of course, Job waited months, the Bible says, to test him in order to prove to the devil that Job loved God, not just for the hedge of protection and the blessings. So, I guess I could add a fifth example here in 2 Chronicles 32:31 regarding King Hezekiah. The Bible said God left him or God took his strong anointing off of Hezekiah. So remember Hezekiah had served God with integrity his entire life and that was based on the anointing and the blessing of God. But God pulled back his anointing and blessing off of Hezekiah in order to try him. Again 2 Chronicles 32:31 that he might know all that was in his heart. So there was still some remaining perhaps selfishness or pride in Hezekiah's heart. So God pulled off his strong anointing and allowed Hezekiah to see the sin that was still in his heart. And of course, all of us have some type of sin in our lives. Brother Ram said, "We sin every day." Paul had to die daily from his sinful nature. So there's five Bible examples of when it seems like God is silent in our lives, but we should not be discouraged. Again, he'll never forsake us. That's what the promise of God is. But he has to test us and try us. So let's look at these three times that Brother Ram talks about God being silent. The first he talked about an Israel life worthy of the gospel, June 30th, 1963. It's a story from 1936 or 37 during the time of the Ohio River flood. And it was about the death of Hope and Sharon Rose. I have a video on my channel that just has this full quote. I'm not going to play the full quote here, but Brother Ram was praying for God to heal his wife and daughter. And Brother Random said it was if God said, quote, "Shut up. I don't want to hear you at all." End quote. And so this is a time God was silent to brother Brandham. And of course this was because of brother Ram's disobedience. Brother Ram was invited to preach to the Pentecostals. He tells about that story of going up to Mishawaka and getting many invitations. But he turned down the invitations to cater to his mother-in-law. And brother Ram said that was a great mistake of his life. But I love it. In the midst of being tempted to almost quit the ministry and quit preaching, brother Ram said everything broke up in his spirit realm, his mind realm and the anchor the Holy Ghost held and he was able to keep pressing on. Now, no doubt he was going to go through many more difficult times. He even talked about battling suicidal thoughts and so forth, but God was faithful. The anchor held in the soul. This is why it's so important to be baptized with the Holy Ghost. So, let's listen to a portion of that quote. And here's where I made my mistake, friends. I'll listen to my mother-in-law instead of listening to God. And if I would have went ahead then, this great thing would have been manifested before this and the church had been farther along. But listen to my mistakes. Here's where sorrow started. He just pulled down the curtain as if say, "Shut up. I don't want to hear you at all. You wouldn't even talk to me." Then if he wouldn't talk to me, it was Satan's time. He said, 'I thought you said he was a good God. What's all this you're hollering about? You're just a boy. Look around over the city. Every girl, every boy you ever social, we think you've lost your mind. You have. Now, he couldn't tell me there was no God because I'd already seen it. But he told me he didn't care for me. I said, "That's right." I began to think, well, what? See, everything be to break away when it come to reasonings. But when it come to that that hung, it stayed there. I was just about ready to say then I'll quit. But when it got down to all the reasoning powers that broke away, then it come to that eternal life, that new birth. What if it hadn't have been there? What if it hadn't? We wouldn't have known one another the way we do now. This church would have not been here like this. The thousands and millions around the world But thank God it was there. Then when I thought, what who am I anyhow? Who am I to question his majesty? Who am I to question the creator to give me my very life here on earth? Where did I get that baby? Who give it to me? Not mine anyhow. Just loan her to me for a while. I said, "Satan, get away from me." I went over, lay my hand on the baby. I said, "God bless you, sweetheart. In a minute, daddy will take you down. Put your own mommy's arms. The angels will pack your little soul away and I'll meet you in that morning. I said, Lord, you give her to me. You're taking her away and throw you slainy like Job said, "Yet I love you and I believe you. If you send me to hell, I love you anyhow. I can't get away from that." The second example is from 1960. Brother Ram tells this story in the sermon, "Go tell April 17th, 1960." And it seems Brother Random had a awful sinus infection for about 9 days. Brother Ram had these meetings set up. He was to go there and preach, but he had this high fever in the hundreds for nine days straight. He said he had many anointed preachers come pray for him to get well, but it seemed like the prayers were not being answered. And then towards the end of this nine days, Brother Ram told his wife perhaps God never called him to preach. And brother Rams said his wife kind of rebuked him a little bit and just said to keep silent. Then after that, Brother Brandham just waited on the Lord. And then the Lord Jesus finally ended the silence and came to him. had a vision. Brother Ram had a vision of the Lord Jesus and the Lord Jesus said, "You're catering too much to denominations." So, we can see these two examples, these first two examples, God is silent because brother Random was catering to his mother-in-law and denominations. And the Lord Jesus also said, Brother Ram was failing to recognize his new ministry, the third pole. So, a beautiful story here of being tested here even with some sickness. But again, God graciously comes to brother Brandham at the end of this test just as he returned to brother Brandham after the death of his first wife and daughter Sharon Rose. Let's listen to a portion of this quote from Gotel 1960. I talked something other give me and what it was. It pulled that sinus down and blocked it. Then I laid in the bed for nine days with this a high burning fever. Many my brother and here come to me many famous brothers come prayed for me. Here come brother Grim Snelling. Here come brother Rattle. All these brothers sure all gathered in praying and everything else. Me praying, trying my best, couldn't even whisper. I wonder what's it all about. You know, I'm so thankful for a god-given wife. Aren't you, brethren, a real wife? Real companion. I sit down. I motion to her and got her over close to me. I said, "Meie, sometimes I wonder." I said, "I wonder what's the matter." I said, "Why would them meetings be there and God let me lay like this?" I said, 'Wh was it?' And I said, "Sometimes I wonder if he even called me." She said, "Ain't you ashamed of yourself?" And she told me, said, "Bill, don't you know that God knows what he's doing with you? Just just be quiet." And so I went in that kind of rebuked me a little, you know. So I went in, laid down on the bed. She come in to change the sheets and she had got the the things on her arm and I looked and I seen something make a flicker over to one side and I looked and there was my wall opened up and I seen Jesus. How many have ever heard me say it? I've seen Jesus twice in my life in a vision. He looked down at me like that and he said to me, "You are waiting for your new ministry to be confirmed to you." He said, "I've already confirmed it to you. It's already confirmed. You've got to accept it." And I didn't listen to him just a minute. It come into my mind. I didn't hear that. It just come in my mind like a man that he's been a sinner all his life and he knows there's a Bible, knows there's a God, but all it wants to hear is a sermon. Then something tells him it's you. And the he said to me then, "You've got to accept it the same way. You've got to believe it. I'm afraid of defeat. Anything I'm afraid I'll bring a reproach. I'm always afraid of watching think I'll call the wrong thing because I've talked warning of the Bible how that Moses is giving great power and he smoke the rock instead of speaking to it. And there he stood talking to me and he said but you walk with too many. He said to walk with me you walk alone. I'd seen that. I've been catering too much to denominations and everything. You see somebody trying to tell you what to do and what not to do. You got to follow him. Amen. The third and final example is from the sermon God doesn't call man to judgment without first warning him July 24th, 1963. In this story, brother Brandham prayed for a young mother and she got well, but then she got sick and died in the hospital. And brother Brandham thought because God had healed her at first that she was going to live the rest of her life for the glory of God. and she and her husband and then her mother were going to serve God faithfully. That this family was all going to unite in the Christian faith and serve God. But then the Lord took the young mother home. She passed away and brother Ram said these words. He said he didn't know why he said it, but he said, "God, you owe me an understanding." And brother Ram said, "God did not like that." And God was silent to Brother Ram for about three or four months. Brother Ram said, "God, just let him pout it out." And then after brother Ram repents, Brother Ram finds out that this young mother that passed away should have died a couple years earlier. She should have drowned in a lake at some type of gathering, some family gathering, but God spared her. God had her life saved because she wasn't ready to go to heaven. She would have been lost. So this is an example where God spares someone's life in order to grant them salvation. So this is the mercy of God. God is rich in mercy. So beautiful story here of brother Ram growing in grace and knowledge of the Lord. Brother Ram being very transparent about his mistakes. That's what we all need to be more transparent, more humble about our mistakes. Let's listen to a portion of this quote. And I I I don't know what caused me to do it, but I said, "Lord God, you you owe me an understanding and after me going out there and and telling that husband and him coming to the Lord after you done these things for him and all that and then take that girl's life like that." I said, "You owe me understanding. When you tell God something like that, he'll leave you sitting alone. I don't He don't owe me nothing. I'm in debt to him." Well, he just let me pound it out for a few days, you know. And after about 3 or 4 months, one day I was out on the creek bank and the Lord spoke to me in a vision and said, "Now go to her mother and say this to her mother." Did not her time come the year before that when she was drowning in a creek on a picnic. She should have went at that time, but I had to take her when she was ready to go. That's why all this happened, why you went out there. Then I got down and cried. I said, "Lord Jesus, forgive me. Your poor stupid servant. I should have never said that, Lord." And I went back down to the lady. She lived on Marcus Street. And I went over to her and I said, "I want to ask you a question." She said, "Sure, Brother Bill." And I said, "Is it true that this girl uh uh uh almost said that's right, Brother Brandham?" Said her husband and they they had to get her out of the creek and said they had to use artificial respiration a prone pressure and they had to get a machine and pump the water out of her. Said she had her skirt on this having a picnic. She was out there and stepped in some sand slipped off overhead and strangled in the water. They didn't notice her and directly seen her coming up and going down and they run in and got her and brought her out and said she almost died. Said she I said that was her time to go. See, God knows what he's doing. Now, the Lord probably would have told me that if I hadn't taken the attitude that I did. Lord, you owe me to tell me about that. He don't owe you nothing. In closing, friends, I hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God. It's an encouragement for us to know that God's going to test us. God's going to try us at times. And brother Ram said he loves to see how we're going to react. That's again from that sermon, Be Certain of God, 1959. You know, he loves to test us. He loves to see the reaction of your faith. Did you know that God likes to see how you react? He loves to test us because the Bible says, "As many as I love, I rebuke and chasen." in Revelation chapter 3 and Hebrews 12 said God has to chasen or test or discipline or train every son or daughter that comes to him. So, we're all going to go through this. We probably already gone through it sometimes at some point in our life already, but we're going to go through it again by the grace of God in order to test us, to try us, that our faith might come forth as gold as Job said. Job knew he was being tested and he knew at the end of it he'd come forth as gold. So, a few reminders. Let's remember to put God first just like the widow at Zerapath. Elijah had instructed her, "Bring me a cake first and then the miracle will happen." Of course, brother Ram quotes this and then he quotes Matthew chapter 6 about seek ye first the kingdom of God in his righteousness and then everything else will be added unto us. So, we get the lesson to seek God first in the morning. Put God first in our finances. Make sure the Lord Jesus Christ is number one in our lives. We also remember Isaiah where it says, "They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength." In every case here in the Bible, the the saints that were tested were eventually visited by God and they renewed their strength by the grace of God. And friends, we want to pass the test. God loves to test us and we want to pass it by being faithful to the Lord. And the story of Job tells us that we can even make awful mistakes in the midst of the test and God will still forgive us and love us. Remember the Bible says that Job actually justified himself more than God. Job said he was more righteous than God. Elahu rebuked him for that. But it was the truth. In the midst of the pain and suffering, even in the midst of prophesying, Job prophesied that I'll stand with the Lord on the earth in my flesh, I shall see God. But he was going back and forth from being in the spirit and being in the flesh. And Job said, I repent in dust and ashes. I abhore myself for the mistakes I made going through the test. in Job 42. So friends, we're going to make mistakes, little mistakes at times when we're tested by the Lord. But remember, just keep waiting on the Lord. Just keep confessing your sin. God will strengthen us. He'll forgive us. He'll renew our strength like the eagle. And lastly, remember that quote from the church age book. It's a beautiful section, pages 116 through 118, at least in the old copy of the church age book. Brother Ram's talking about the love of God and how the proof of God's love is an election or your choosing or your calling. Brother Ram said, "God may commit you to death as he did Paul. He may commit you to suffering as he did Job. That is his prerogative. He is sovereign, but it is all with a purpose because God is not the author of confusion. God is the author of peace." So God wants us to learn peace in the midst of our tests and trials of life. Whatever he commits our lives to, God is trustworthy. We can trust him with our lives and our souls and our eternity. Then on page 117, we get that great quote that character is a victory, not a gift. Power apart from character is satanic, but power with character is fit to rule. What a memorable, powerful quote. And then a little later, Brother Ram says, "The cloudy skies and storms of life are no signs of God's disapproval. Neither are the bright skies and still waters signs of his love and approval. His approval of any of us is only in the beloved. His love is elective love. Does he love us? Ah, yes. But how shall we know? We shall know because he said so. And brother Ram said, "How shall I prove my love to him? By believing what he said and by conducting himself with joy amidst the trials that he in his wisdom allows to come to pass." So friends, let's continue to trust God. As Proverbs 3 says, "Trust in the Lord with all your heart. Lean not to your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge him and he will direct your paths." So when God sets silent or lays silent as brother Ram says, keep trusting in him. He will come and save you. He will renew your strength like the eagle. If you have any questions, concerns or testimonies about this video, please contact me. God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart.
