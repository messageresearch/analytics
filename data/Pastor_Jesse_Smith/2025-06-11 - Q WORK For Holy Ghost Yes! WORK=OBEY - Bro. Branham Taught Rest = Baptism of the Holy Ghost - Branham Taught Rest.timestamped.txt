[0:04] I'll stand like a weather vein. I'll do
[0:06] anything you want me to do. Only I want
[0:07] the Holy Ghost. I'm determined to get
[0:10] it.
[0:12] When you surrender fully, he'll come in
[0:14] fully. But until you surrender, he can't
[0:17] come in fully.
[0:19] Greetings, friends, in the matchless
[0:21] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The
[0:23] purpose of this video is to answer a
[0:25] question I received recently. Do
[0:28] believers have to work for the Holy
[0:30] Ghost baptism or the filling of the Holy
[0:33] Ghost? And the answer is yes. The Bible
[0:36] teaches this, but it's speaking of a
[0:39] different kind of work. It's speaking of
[0:41] the work of each Christian to learn to
[0:44] obey the Holy Spirit instead of the
[0:48] flesh. This is certainly a deeper
[0:50] subject, but that's expected because the
[0:53] baptism of the Holy Ghost is called a
[0:55] mystery in Colossians 1:26 and 27. The
[0:59] mystery that was hid from ages, but is
[1:01] now revealed Christ in you, the hope of
[1:03] glory. So, how does Christ get in you?
[1:06] He must be born in you. And every birth
[1:09] requires labor in the natural and the
[1:11] spiritual. A pregnant mother must labor
[1:15] to give birth. And so in the spiritual,
[1:18] each believer must go through a time of
[1:20] laboring in order to bring forth new
[1:23] life. As Jesus said in John 3, you must
[1:26] be born again.
[1:28] There's two points that I want to
[1:31] address as far as foundational points.
[1:33] The first is Ephesians 2 8-10. I believe
[1:36] this. We are saved by grace through
[1:38] faith, not of works, lest any man should
[1:41] boast. All my videos prove this. This is
[1:43] what brother Brandon preached as well.
[1:45] God's true prophet. We're only saved by
[1:48] grace. After you're saved, though, the
[1:50] Bible speaks that there are two more
[1:53] works of grace for a total of three
[1:55] works of grace. Justification is being
[1:58] saved. It's God declaring you righteous
[2:00] by faith in the blood of Jesus Christ.
[2:02] But then grace keeps working. Grace then
[2:05] sanctifies you or purifies your vessel,
[2:08] purifies your daily habits. And then
[2:10] third, and finally, grace allows you to
[2:12] be filled with the Holy Ghost or
[2:14] baptized with the Holy Ghost or born
[2:16] again, receive the new birth, Christ in
[2:19] you, the hope of glory. I'll be
[2:21] mentioning numerous videos that will
[2:23] help you if you go watch them. I think
[2:25] the first one I'll mention is that the
[2:28] new birth and the baptism of the Holy
[2:30] Ghost are one and the same as God's
[2:32] prophet, Brother Ram, taught. Also,
[2:34] here's a visual for the three works of
[2:36] grace. This is a visual from my 2021
[2:39] book. I have an entire chapter on Christ
[2:41] in you, the hope of glory, the mystery
[2:43] of the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Man's
[2:45] natural birth has three works. Man's
[2:48] spiritual birth has three works. As you
[2:50] can see,
[2:52] the Old Testament tabernacle was
[2:53] cleansed through three courts. Outer
[2:56] court, holy place, holiest of holies.
[2:59] Ezekiel prophesied of the three works of
[3:01] grace. He said there you have a new
[3:02] heart, new spirit, and then God's
[3:04] spirit. Jesus taught the three works of
[3:07] grace in Mark 4:28, the blade, the ear,
[3:11] and the full corn. And then Jesus said
[3:13] he would take us through these three
[3:15] works because he's the way, the truth,
[3:18] and the life.
[3:20] I have two videos also about the three
[3:22] works of grace. So, I'll leave a link to
[3:24] those in the description as well. And
[3:27] friends, remember, brother Ram said his
[3:29] message was the three works of grace. He
[3:31] told a story about his mother having a
[3:33] dream. There was three steps leading up
[3:36] to the path that would take a person to
[3:37] heaven. And a woman said she could walk
[3:39] on this path in high heels. And brother
[3:41] Ram tried to warn her, but she did it
[3:43] anyway and she fell off. In other words,
[3:45] you can't receive the baptism of the
[3:47] Holy Ghost and live a worldly life. My
[3:50] old mother, she's gone on now and she
[3:53] was a very odd woman and she's, you
[3:56] know, Indian and she was odd. But in
[4:00] there, she was a person that didn't
[4:01] dream. But I don't think she only had
[4:03] four or five dreams all of her life. But
[4:05] every time she dreamed a dream, it was
[4:08] true. She had a dream, it was true. I
[4:11] remember one time I first started
[4:12] preaching many years ago. We living
[4:14] right up here on the road right above
[4:16] here. I was preaching right here at this
[4:18] church and she dreamed a dream that I
[4:20] was standing here by the side of a three
[4:24] steps. And I was standing preaching to
[4:26] everybody that they must walk up these
[4:29] three steps before they hit the highway.
[4:32] And on the highways, a little pearly
[4:35] like white line run right into the the
[4:38] the doors of heaven to the pearly gates.
[4:40] And that pearl had been stretched out to
[4:42] the top of these steps. If that ain't my
[4:44] message exactly today, justification,
[4:46] sanctification, baptism. And I was
[4:49] saying that a person has to come by
[4:52] these three steps to be able to walk
[4:53] that highway and said that there was a
[4:56] lady came by. Now you know what kind of
[4:58] shoes people wore 35 years ago. There's
[5:01] a lady come by had on a great big pair
[5:02] of like they wear today spiky shoes and
[5:05] she come by and I said wait a minute
[5:07] sister you can't walk that highway is
[5:09] that and I said you you can't do it. And
[5:12] she said uh
[5:14] she said she looked around and said,
[5:16] "Don't believe him. He's a mad man.
[5:18] Don't believe him. I'll show you I can
[5:20] be justified, sanctified, and filled
[5:21] with the Holy Ghost still walking." And
[5:23] she I just let her go. Couldn't do no
[5:25] more about it. Couldn't stop her. And
[5:26] she jumped up on the highway, looked
[5:28] back at the sister, said, "Yeah, I told
[5:29] you." She started run up and she You
[5:31] know what the Bible said in Isaiah 5th
[5:33] chapter that they have outstretched
[5:35] necks. They have to to pitch over. Amen.
[5:38] see
[5:41] mincing as it has to it has to twist
[5:43] mincing as they go making a tingling
[5:45] with her heels the daughters of Zion in
[5:47] the last days and she started up that
[5:49] highway just as hard as she could run
[5:51] and as well that throw got narrow and
[5:53] narrow she started reeling mincing like
[5:55] that and off she went mother said the
[5:58] harvest screams that I ever heard in my
[6:00] life was that woman falling into those
[6:01] flames and smoke going down down like
[6:04] that I turn around and said see she just
[6:07] obeyed Everything but one word.
[6:12] See, everything but one word. Sure,
[6:14] Pentecostal women can be saved,
[6:16] sanctified, and filled with the Holy
[6:17] Ghost. And then failed.
[6:21] Absolutely. Man shall not live by bread
[6:23] alone, but by every word. See, see, and
[6:27] she failed it. And as I said, see, she
[6:29] should have went on in. All right. But
[6:30] see, she failed to listen. Tell her what
[6:34] was ahead. and he's wrote the gospel by
[6:37] the disciples, apostles, the doctrine of
[6:39] the apostles and prophets and so forth
[6:42] and they won't listen. The three works
[6:45] of grace were also foreshadowed when
[6:47] Israel left Egypt and made its way to
[6:50] the promised land. There was three
[6:52] stages of their journey. The first stage
[6:55] was leaving Egypt. The second stage was
[6:57] the wilderness and the third stage was
[6:59] crossing Jordan. So, it took three
[7:01] stages to enter into the promise. And
[7:03] that's what we'll see in the New
[7:04] Testament as well. Before getting to
[7:06] these four important Bible points, I've
[7:09] interacted with numerous people out of
[7:10] denominations and friends, it's so sad.
[7:12] They teach that you are filled with the
[7:14] Holy Ghost the moment you get saved. And
[7:17] that is an awful lie. That's a great
[7:19] deception. Think of it. You know, some
[7:21] people get saved when they're four,
[7:22] five, six, seven years old. And do they
[7:25] look like they're filled with the Holy
[7:27] Ghost after they say a prayer of
[7:28] repentance? No. Certainly not. And then
[7:31] think about adults that are really
[7:32] worldly. Will they get saved in
[7:34] denominational churches and people tell
[7:35] them they're filled with the Holy Ghost?
[7:37] Are they filled with the Holy Ghost?
[7:39] Certainly not. A lot of them continue in
[7:40] their sins, their dirty habits. So, it's
[7:44] an awful, awful, false doctrine to tell
[7:46] people they are filled with the Holy
[7:47] Ghost as soon as they're saved. Do they
[7:49] have the Holy Ghost working in their
[7:51] life? Of course. It's called the new
[7:53] heart as Ezekiel taught in Ezekiel 36.
[7:55] You get a new heart, but then you need a
[7:57] new spirit. You need a transformed mind
[7:59] and then you get God's spirit to dwell
[8:01] in your soul. Let's start looking at
[8:03] these four Bible proofs. The first proof
[8:05] is the main Bible text that says you
[8:09] must labor to enter into the promise of
[8:11] God. It's Hebrews 4 1-12. I'm just going
[8:14] to summarize this. But verse one says,
[8:17] "Let us therefore fear lest a promise
[8:19] being left us of entering into his rest
[8:23] any of you should seem to come short of
[8:26] it."
[8:27] Verse two says we must mix faith with
[8:30] the word preached.
[8:33] Then verses 8 and N say if Joshua or
[8:36] Jesus had given them rest then he would
[8:37] not afterward have spoken of of another
[8:39] day.
[8:41] So this tells us the rest Hebrews 4 is
[8:44] talking about is not Sunday or Saturday.
[8:47] It's not a Sabbath day of physical rest.
[8:50] It's spiritual rest. Verse 9, there
[8:52] remainth therefore a rest of the people
[8:54] of God. And verse 10 tells us what it
[8:56] is. The rest is you ceasing from your
[8:58] sinful works and then living or obeying
[9:02] and doing the works of the Holy Ghost.
[9:04] Verse 10, for he that has entered into
[9:06] his rest, he also has ceased from his
[9:09] own works as God did from his.
[9:12] So someone who's filled with the Holy
[9:14] Ghost now does the works of God very
[9:16] frequently. They cease from their old
[9:18] sinful works. And notice back to verse
[9:20] one, Hebrews 4:1 speaks of a promise we
[9:23] must enter into. This is the same
[9:25] promise Jesus spoke of in Acts 1:4. He
[9:29] told them to wait for the promise of the
[9:31] father. They should not depart from
[9:33] Jerusalem. And then Acts 15 tells us
[9:36] what the promise is. Ye shall be
[9:37] baptized with the Holy Ghost not many
[9:39] days hence. So it's undeniable. The
[9:42] promise to enter into in the new
[9:44] covenant is the baptism of the Holy
[9:46] Ghost.
[9:47] This is also seen in Galatians 3:14.
[9:51] That the blessing of Abraham might come
[9:53] on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ
[9:55] that we might receive the promise of the
[9:58] spirit through faith. So it's undeniable
[10:01] we must labor to enter into that rest.
[10:04] We must labor to enter into the baptism
[10:06] of the Holy Ghost. Remember friends, in
[10:09] the Old Testament, they could not
[10:10] receive the Holy Ghost in the soul.
[10:12] There's three parts to man according to
[10:14] 1 Thessalonians 5:23. body, spirit,
[10:18] soul. Soul is the deepest inner part of
[10:21] your being.
[10:23] In the Old Testament, they couldn't
[10:24] receive the Holy Ghost in the soul
[10:26] because their sins were only covered
[10:27] over by the blood of bulls and goats.
[10:31] Jesus says this plainly in John 7:38
[10:35] and 39.
[10:37] He talks about living water. But then in
[10:39] verse 39 it says, "But this spake he of
[10:41] the spirit which they that believe on
[10:43] him should receive for the Holy Ghost
[10:45] was not yet given because that Jesus was
[10:48] not yet glorified." So this tells us the
[10:50] Holy Ghost could not come into the soul
[10:52] of the believer until after Jesus died
[10:55] and raised with a glorified body. And
[10:57] that's what they received on the day of
[10:59] Pentecost. That was the promise of the
[11:01] father. It's undeniable Bible truth. So
[11:04] that's the main text. Hebrews 4:1-12. We
[11:07] have to enter into the promise through
[11:09] laboring. Now, we'll see a little later
[11:11] that labor doesn't mean what it means in
[11:13] other places. It means diligence. Let's
[11:16] next look at the rest for the soul. Now,
[11:18] in Hebrews 4 1 3 4 5 8 9 10 and 11, it
[11:23] speaks of this rest. And it's the rest
[11:26] for the soul. It's not a physical day of
[11:29] rest like Saturday or Sunday again. And
[11:31] to prove that, we're going to look at
[11:32] two other portions of scripture. Isaiah
[11:35] 28:11 and 12. For with stammering lips
[11:38] in another tongue will he speak to this
[11:40] people to whom he said, "This is the
[11:42] rest." So what is the rest? It's the
[11:44] speaking in tongues that came on the day
[11:47] of Pentecost. Now we know tongues is not
[11:49] the evidence of the Holy Ghost today.
[11:50] But God used it on the day of Pentecost
[11:52] as a supernatural sign and wonder to the
[11:56] 17 nations that were gathered there in
[11:58] Jerusalem in Acts chapter 2. He said,
[12:01] "This is the rest wherewith you may
[12:03] cause the weary to rest, and this is the
[12:05] refreshing, yet they would not hear." So
[12:08] the rest, the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[12:10] was going to fall on the day of
[12:11] Pentecost on these Jews that were in the
[12:14] upper room, and they were going to have
[12:15] stammering lips and another tongue. It's
[12:18] undeniable. This is the rest that God
[12:20] promised. Jesus told them in Acts 14 to
[12:22] go wait for this rest. Go wait for the
[12:24] promise. And then Paul says that this
[12:27] verse Isaiah 28:11-2 was about the day
[12:30] of Pentecost. He says that in 1
[12:32] Corinthians 14:21 in the law it is
[12:35] written with men of other tongues and
[12:38] other lips will I speak unto this
[12:39] people. And yet for all this they will
[12:42] not hear me sayeth the Lord. So God even
[12:44] foretold that most of Israel would
[12:46] reject the baptism of the Holy Ghost. So
[12:48] Isaiah 28 11-12 spoke of the rest of the
[12:52] baptism of the Holy Ghost in the soul.
[12:54] And when Jesus was on the earth
[12:56] preaching, he said he was going to send
[12:57] a rest for the soul, not a rest for the
[13:00] body. So not Saturday Sabbath or Sunday
[13:02] Sabbath, not rest for the mind, but rest
[13:05] for the soul. This is in Matthew 11:28
[13:08] and 29. Come unto me all you that labor
[13:11] and are heavy laden, and I will give you
[13:13] rest. In other words, to the people that
[13:15] are tired of going on in their sinful
[13:17] life with bad sinful habits. Stop doing
[13:21] your own works as Hebrews 4 said, "But
[13:23] do the works of God." Matthew 11:29,
[13:25] "Take my yoke upon you and learn of me,
[13:27] for I meek and lowly in heart, and ye
[13:30] shall find rest unto your souls." So,
[13:33] it's undeniable. You must labor to enter
[13:36] into this rest. And that rest is in the
[13:39] soul. Let me read 1 Thessalonians 5:23
[13:42] again to show how there are three parts.
[13:45] And I pray your whole spirit, that's
[13:47] your mind, and your soul, that's the
[13:49] innermost part of you, your nature, the
[13:51] nature of your being, and your body. So
[13:54] there's three parts, spirit, soul, body.
[13:57] Be preserved blameless unto the coming
[13:59] of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[14:02] Now, this third point is very important.
[14:04] The word labor in Hebrews chapter 4
[14:07] means diligence. So here's a screenshot
[14:09] of that. It means to hasten, to exert
[14:12] oneself, to give diligence. So this is
[14:16] speaking of you must give human effort.
[14:18] You must, in other words, do the will of
[14:20] God. Die to your own will and do the
[14:22] will of God. Just as Jesus prayed in the
[14:25] garden of Gethsemane, not my will, but
[14:28] thine be done. So we must give
[14:30] diligence. We must exert our effort to
[14:33] obey the word of God. We're not earning
[14:35] the Holy Ghost. We're dying out to our
[14:37] human will to receive the Holy Ghost. So
[14:40] again, let us labor or let us give
[14:42] diligence therefore to enter into the
[14:44] rest. This is the same diligence 2 Peter
[14:48] 1:10 speaks of. Give diligence to make
[14:51] your calling and election sure. And what
[14:53] is Peter talking about? Give diligence
[14:56] to what? Give diligence to add more
[14:59] anointing of the Holy Ghost to you. Add
[15:01] faith, virtue, add knowledge, add
[15:04] temperance, add patience, add godliness,
[15:07] add brotherly kindness, and add charity.
[15:10] So see, we must give diligence. We must
[15:12] obey the Holy Spirit. And then God gives
[15:16] us more anointing. That's what this
[15:19] means. To work for the Holy Ghost, we
[15:21] must obey the Holy Ghost. We must bring
[15:25] our bodies and minds into obedience to
[15:28] the Holy Ghost. Paul calls it a war in
[15:31] Romans chapter 7. I preached on that
[15:33] recently. He said, 'I see the law of my
[15:36] members warning against the law of my
[15:38] mind. I want to do good, but evil's
[15:40] right there with me. That's what this is
[15:42] referring to, laboring or waring against
[15:45] the sinful nature of the flesh in order
[15:47] to obey the Holy Spirit. And this is
[15:50] scriptural, giving diligence to obey.
[15:52] This is part of the greatest command.
[15:55] Mark 12:30, "Thou shalt love the Lord
[15:57] your God with all thy heart, with all
[15:59] thy soul, with all thy mind, and with
[16:01] all thy strength."
[16:03] That word strength is very important.
[16:06] That's being diligent. When you give God
[16:08] your strength, you're being diligent.
[16:10] You're working against the temptations
[16:12] of the flesh. You're working against the
[16:14] sin nature. You're working against your
[16:16] fleshly will in order to do the will of
[16:18] God. So the word diligence is a synonym
[16:22] or means the same as work in Hebrews
[16:25] chapter 4. Labor to enter into this
[16:28] rest. So this can be stated four
[16:30] different ways. We work for the Holy
[16:32] Ghost according to Hebrews 4:11. Labor
[16:34] for the promise. Labor to enter into
[16:37] rest. Work for the Holy Ghost. Another
[16:40] way to say it is be diligent for the
[16:43] Holy Ghost. That's according to second
[16:44] Peter 1 5-10. And then he said, "If you
[16:48] do these things, you shall never fail."
[16:50] So again, doing, in other words,
[16:52] obeying, submitting to the Holy Ghost.
[16:55] We must submit to the Holy Ghost if we
[16:57] want to be filled with the Holy Ghost.
[16:58] God will not force his spirit on
[17:00] anybody. So now we have three words that
[17:03] mean the same. Work for the Holy Ghost.
[17:05] Labor for the Holy Ghost, be diligent
[17:07] for the Holy Ghost. Here's a fourth one.
[17:10] Yield for the Holy Ghost. That's
[17:12] according to Romans 6
[17:14] 12-4.
[17:16] The Bible said, "Let not sin therefore
[17:18] reign in your mortal body that you
[17:19] should obey it in the lust thereof." So
[17:21] again, it's dealing with obedience.
[17:24] Neither yield your members as
[17:25] instruments of unrighteousness unto sin,
[17:28] but yield yourselves unto God. For sin
[17:31] shall not have dominion over you, for
[17:33] you're not under the law, but under
[17:35] grace. So this is how we overcome sin.
[17:38] We've got to yield. We've got to work.
[17:40] We've got to be diligent. We've got to
[17:42] labor against the sin nature. It's
[17:44] undeniable Bible proof, friends. And
[17:47] then I love this one. Acts 5:32, God
[17:49] gives the Holy Ghost to them that obey
[17:51] him. So, do we have to work for the Holy
[17:54] Ghost? Yes. Work against your sinful
[17:56] nature. Do we have to obey for the Holy
[17:58] Ghost? Yes. It's thus sayith the
[18:00] scripture, Acts 5:32.
[18:03] There's other ways to explain this as
[18:04] well. Jesus said, "Take up your cross
[18:06] daily." And what is a cross? It's
[18:08] crucifixion. And you have to crucify
[18:10] your own sinful will every single day.
[18:14] Luke 9:23.
[18:16] We're talking about crucifying the
[18:18] sinful desires of the flesh in order to
[18:21] obey more of the word of God. Paul said
[18:25] this in 1 Corinthians 15:31.
[18:27] I die daily. He's speaking of the same
[18:30] thing Jesus was talking about. Dying to
[18:32] the sinful nature of the flesh. That's
[18:35] the work. That's the labor. That's the
[18:37] yielding. Paul says it plainly in Romans
[18:40] 8:13.
[18:42] If I live through the spirit, I mortify
[18:45] the deeds of the body. That mortify
[18:47] means to kill. That's the work. That's
[18:50] the labor. Killing out the sinful
[18:53] desires and doing God's desire. And then
[18:57] he says Romans 8:14, for as many are as
[19:00] led by the spirit of God, they are the
[19:02] sons of God. What does the spirit of God
[19:03] lead us to do? Kill our sinful desires.
[19:07] labor to obey the word of God. Be
[19:09] diligent to obey the Holy Ghost. Yield
[19:12] to the Holy Ghost. Obey the Holy Ghost.
[19:15] But it takes a death and its work to
[19:17] die. It's hard to die out to the daily
[19:20] sinful desires. I also want you to see
[19:22] this important scripture. It's 1
[19:24] Corinthians 15:10. Paul said, "I labored
[19:28] more abundantly than they all." He's
[19:30] talking about all the other apostles,
[19:32] the 11 other apostles that were
[19:33] faithful. yet not I, but the grace of
[19:36] God which was given unto me. So Paul
[19:38] says he labored and did more missionary
[19:40] work than any of the 11 apostles. He
[19:43] said, "But it wasn't me. It was the
[19:45] grace of God." So now we see a another
[19:48] truth to this. When we work for God,
[19:51] it's actually God's spirit strengthening
[19:53] us to do the work. We're not working of
[19:55] our own works. We're working God's
[19:57] works. And that's what Hebrews 4 is
[19:59] about. ceasing from your works and doing
[20:02] the works of God through the power of
[20:04] the Holy Spirit. Paul calls it grace
[20:08] that caused him to work harder than
[20:09] anybody else. It wasn't his human
[20:12] efforts. It was the spirit of God
[20:14] motivating him to do the works of God.
[20:16] So, we're working for the Holy Ghost. In
[20:18] other words, we're working to die out to
[20:20] our sinful nature. We're working against
[20:22] the sinful flesh. We're working to die
[20:25] out. We're working to crucify daily the
[20:29] lust of the flesh, lust of the eyes,
[20:31] pride of life, so we can be led by the
[20:33] Holy Spirit. So we can do the works of
[20:35] the Holy Spirit, not our own works. The
[20:39] fourth point I want to make is that love
[20:40] is the motivation for all godly works.
[20:43] And you could make it interchangeable,
[20:45] love or grace. You could say either one.
[20:47] And we get this again from 1 Corinthians
[20:49] 15:10. Paul said, "I labored more than
[20:52] everybody because the grace of God that
[20:53] was in me." So we could say grace is the
[20:56] motivation for works or we could say
[20:57] love is the motivation for works as
[21:00] Galatians 5:6 says faith which workketh
[21:04] by love. So we can make like a
[21:06] flowchart. How do we do the works of
[21:08] God? Well, it starts with love. You have
[21:10] to have the love of God in your heart or
[21:11] you could replace that with the grace of
[21:13] God in your heart. Love motivates faith
[21:15] because it says faith works by love. So
[21:19] everything starts with love of God. And
[21:21] again that's the greatest commandment
[21:22] according to Jesus. loving God with all
[21:24] your heart, soul, mind, and strength. So
[21:26] if you love God, that will motivate your
[21:28] faith and then the faith will go to
[21:30] work. Faith works by love. So we have to
[21:34] have these three components. This is
[21:36] when you've entered into God's rest. The
[21:38] love of God is motivating your faith and
[21:41] faith is going to work. We also see this
[21:43] in Titus 2:14. Jesus gave himself for us
[21:46] that he might redeem us from all
[21:48] iniquity and purify unto himself a
[21:50] peculiar people zealous of good works.
[21:53] So that's what the Holy Spirit does. It
[21:55] creates a zeal in us to be purified to
[21:58] crucify the sinful desires of the flesh
[22:00] every day so we can be zealous for good
[22:03] works. And any seasoned Christian knows
[22:06] this. Every day I got to crucify the
[22:07] sinful desires of my flesh to make
[22:10] videos to study for preaching to do any
[22:13] labor for the kingdom of God. Just like
[22:15] Paul said, it was the grace of God
[22:17] motivating him. Every Christian knows
[22:19] that it's God's love that motivates us
[22:22] to do the works of Jesus and works for
[22:25] Jesus. There's a few quotes from brother
[22:28] Brandham I'd like to play. The first one
[22:29] is from 1957. Brother Random connects
[22:32] Isaiah 28, the rest that God promised
[22:35] through stammering lips. He connects
[22:37] that with Hebrews chapter 4, labor to
[22:39] enter into that rest. And then he
[22:40] connects that with Matthew 11 where
[22:43] Jesus said, "I'll give you rest for your
[22:45] souls." Beautiful quote. Ties all these
[22:47] things together. The rest of God is the
[22:50] baptism of the Holy Ghost. Let's listen
[22:52] to the quotes. Watch what Paul said. If
[22:55] Jesus would have given them rest, he
[22:57] would have spoke of another day. But he
[22:59] limited a day, saying, David, after so
[23:00] long a time, when you hear his voice,
[23:03] harden not your heart. And there
[23:05] remainth, listen now, ninth verse, there
[23:08] remainth therefore, a rest, a Sabbath to
[23:11] the people of God.
[23:14] For he, the man or woman, that has
[23:17] entered into his rest, come unto me all
[23:18] you labor and heavy laden, and I'll give
[23:20] you rest, has ceased from his works as
[23:23] God did from his.
[23:26] Say, brother Benham, what happens? You
[23:27] get the Holy Ghost. Amen. Christ comes
[23:30] into you. Is that right? Turn with me to
[23:33] Isaiah the 28th chapter.
[23:36] For with stammer lips, and with other
[23:39] tongues will I speak to this people, to
[23:42] whom it is said, this is the Sabbath,
[23:48] wherein ye shall cause the weary to
[23:51] rest.
[23:53] This is the refreshments. Yet they would
[23:56] not hear. For the word of the Lord came
[24:01] unto them. Somebody preached it. Precept
[24:05] upon precept upon precept, line upon
[24:08] line upon line, here a little and there
[24:10] a little, that they might go and fall
[24:14] backward and be broken and snared and
[24:16] taken. Amen. What is the rest? When did
[24:20] the rest come? when people spoke with
[24:23] other tongues and had stammered lips.
[24:26] Stammerred lips. They didn't speak
[24:27] nothing. They stammered. When did that
[24:29] happen? On the day of Pentecost when the
[24:31] Holy Ghost come.
[24:33] That is the rest. The Holy Ghost. Jesus
[24:36] said, "Come unto me all you wear and
[24:37] heavy laden. And I'll give you rest.
[24:40] I'll give you life. Eternal life." Zoe,
[24:44] God's own life. God will come into you
[24:46] and be a part of you. He'll give you a
[24:47] birth and make you a son and daughter.
[24:50] The next quote is from Albuquerque, New
[24:52] Mexico. God hiding himself in simplicity
[24:54] right after the preaching of the seven
[24:55] seals, April 12th evening, 1963.
[25:00] Brother Ram's leading people to the
[25:01] baptism of the Holy Ghost. And if you
[25:03] want a good recording of that, listen to
[25:06] that sermon. In fact, the last 45
[25:08] minutes, Brother Ram's leading people to
[25:09] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[25:12] And he's basically showing them how to
[25:13] labor to be born again. In other words,
[25:15] how to be diligent to die out to the
[25:18] sinful nature and be filled with the
[25:19] Holy Spirit. Brother Ram says, "When you
[25:22] surrender fully, he'll come in fully." I
[25:25] thought that's a good way to say it.
[25:27] Working for the Holy Ghost is working to
[25:29] surrender. Working against the fleshly
[25:32] desires, the sin nature, and
[25:34] surrendering to God's will. Brother Ram
[25:36] said, "Surrender your thoughts,
[25:37] surrender your thinking, surrender your
[25:39] life, surrender your all, surrender your
[25:41] prestige, surrender everything to him.
[25:43] He'll come in and fill you with the Holy
[25:45] Ghost. Beautiful quote. Let's listen to
[25:47] the quote.
[25:49] Stay right with it. Stay right with it.
[25:50] Just stay right there.
[25:52] You haven't been standing there five
[25:54] minutes yet. Stay right there.
[25:58] You promised it, God. I'm here to
[26:00] receive it. All right. There it is.
[26:03] Reach right out. Say, "I receive it.
[26:05] Here it is, Lord. I want it. I I stood
[26:07] up here. I'm sincere. I mean it. You
[26:10] promised it to me." Amen.
[26:17] Glory. Hallelujah. Just keep believing.
[26:20] Keep you said you believe me. The Holy
[26:23] Spirit, that light just keeps moving
[26:25] around over the building. What is it?
[26:27] It's hunting somebody that'll open up.
[26:34] I tell the truth.
[26:38] Amen.
[26:44] [Music]
[26:48] Kyle, raised up your hands and praised
[26:49] him, saying, "Lord, I thank you. You
[26:51] give me the promise. I'm going to hold
[26:53] you the promise. Thank you, Lord. Thank
[26:55] you. I I'm looking right at it.
[26:59] [Music]
[27:13] Stay right with us. Stay there, Lord.
[27:15] I'm going to stay right here. I don't
[27:16] care if it's in the morning. I'll be
[27:18] standing right here praising you. I know
[27:19] you're going to send it. This
[27:21] convention's ending tonight. And I'm
[27:23] here without the Holy Ghost. I'm going
[27:25] away from here filled with the Holy
[27:26] Ghost. So help me. You promise it.
[27:31] I'll stand like a weather vein. I'll do
[27:33] anything you want me to do. only I want
[27:34] the Holy Ghost and I'm determined to get
[27:37] it.
[27:39] When you surrender fully, he'll come in
[27:41] fully. But until you surrender, he can't
[27:44] come in fully. Surrender. Surrender your
[27:47] thoughts, surrender your thinking,
[27:49] surrender your life, surrender your all,
[27:51] surrender your prestige, surrender
[27:53] everything to him now. And he'll come in
[27:55] and fill you with the Holy Ghost. That's
[27:57] what he's sure to do. It already struck
[27:59] you a three year in the building. It's
[28:01] more than that. in the Holy Ghost. Just
[28:03] keep believing.
[28:08] [Music]
[28:24] Glory to God.
[28:27] [Music]
[28:38] Humble your own thinking. Humble your
[28:41] own ways.
[28:43] And friends, I have a lot more helpful
[28:44] videos if you'd like. I'll leave a link
[28:46] to this audio book of chapter 6 of my
[28:49] 2021 book, Christ in You, the Baptism of
[28:52] the Holy Ghost. It's a Mystery. This
[28:54] chapter, by God's grace, fully explains
[28:56] this mystery. It'd be very helpful for
[28:59] you to listen to that by the grace of
[29:00] God. Also, another video is you can be
[29:02] saved but yet not born again in the
[29:04] soul. So, this shows how there's three
[29:06] parts to man. And it gives five Bible
[29:09] examples in the New Testament of people
[29:11] that were saved but yet not born again.
[29:13] A great example is Cornelius in Acts
[29:15] chapter 10. He was saved because he was
[29:18] fasting, praying, giving alms, but he
[29:20] had not received the baptism of the Holy
[29:22] Ghost until Peter came and preached to
[29:24] him. It's a beautiful story. I'd
[29:26] recommend anybody reading that. Acts
[29:27] chapter 10. The next video is what I
[29:30] mentioned earlier. New birth and baptism
[29:31] of the Holy Ghost are one and the same.
[29:33] Brother Ram's quotes and scriptures.
[29:35] Another good one is 12 terms for the
[29:37] baptism of the Holy Ghost. The Bible
[29:39] uses at least 12 different terms in
[29:42] order to define the one self-same event,
[29:46] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Very
[29:48] important. Hope you'll watch that by
[29:50] God's grace. And last one, how to
[29:53] receive the Holy Ghost and how you'll
[29:54] act when he comes. I think I made the
[29:56] statement daily read, Bible, pray. So if
[30:00] you look at the scriptures from the Lord
[30:02] Jesus Christ and Paul, basically every
[30:04] day we have to read our Bibles, pray,
[30:06] and then obey. If we do that, we will be
[30:09] filled with the Holy Ghost. It's a Bible
[30:11] promise. It's undeniable.
[30:13] In closing,
[30:15] friends, hope this video was a blessing
[30:16] by the grace of God. Excellent question.
[30:18] It's a deep understanding. It's a deep
[30:20] revelation that God gave to brother
[30:22] Brandham. And then we prophesy it again.
[30:25] As Revelation 10 8-11 says, we're eating
[30:28] this book and then we can prophesy it
[30:30] again. We can foretell it again by the
[30:32] grace of God. Yes, we must labor against
[30:36] the flesh. We must labor to be diligent.
[30:39] We must labor to obey the Holy Ghost and
[30:41] then we'll be filled with the Holy
[30:42] Ghost. It's undeniable. It is Bible
[30:45] truth. It's Bible revelation. I trust
[30:48] you've been blessed today. If you feel
[30:50] led, share this with a person that might
[30:51] be seeking the baptism of the Holy
[30:53] Ghost. I think it'll be a great help to
[30:54] them by the grace of God. If you have
[30:57] any questions, concerns or testimonies
[30:59] about this video, please contact me.
[31:02] God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[31:05] the desire of your heart.
[31:08] Very happy to be here this afternoon and
[31:10] again in defense of the gospel of Jesus
[31:12] Christ to bring the good tidings, the
[31:15] good news that Jesus raised from the
[31:17] dead, living among man today, his
[31:19] church. The same Jesus that was
[31:22] yesterday will be today and forever.
[31:26] He's never failed.
[31:29] [Music]
