TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] one [Music] more week promise then there's one there's one listen to you [Music] greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to teach the timing of Daniel 70 weeks according to God's Prophet brother William Branham to begin with I'll say that I'm sure my understanding of this may differ with many people or many ministers as I believe there is still one week remaining for Israel out of the 70 weeks I believe 69 weeks have been fulfilled but I believe there's still one more week left of time for Israel or seven years left for Israel and friends my understanding of this subject changed in 2021 after a deep study on this topic before 2021 I believed Jesus had preached the first three and a half years of Daniel's 70th week as brother branham's later quote say from 1963 to 1965. but when I studied this topic deeply religram's own sermon about the 70 weeks of Daniel in 1961 convinced me there are still seven years left for Israel and convinced me that only 69 of the 70 weeks have been fulfilled and not 69 and a half I do believe the Lord Jesus preached around three and a half years but I do not believe his three and a half year Ministry was part of the 70th week of Daniel I believe the Lord Jesus is three and a half years of ministry finished the 69th week of Daniel's 70 weeks and there's still one week remaining for Israel so in summary I believe brother branham's original 1961 teaching on Daniel 70 weeks was correct and then his later quotes were incorrect and I understand usually the opposite is true usually we find brother Ram's later teachings to be correct on almost every topic such as the godhead the Seven Seals the three parts of man the baptism of the Holy Ghost and so forth but this topic of Daniel's 70 weeks does not pertain to the Gentile bride of Jesus Christ and therefore it would make sense that God did not need to correct brother Branham on this subject similar to other subjects God didn't correct brother Branham on such as his 1977 prediction of total Annihilation to the world that he said in 1958 and that and that's her dick now this is not the Lord saying this the other about the woman in his is the Lord but I predicted in 19 and and thirty 33 that the world would be total Annihilation before 77. and also his hopes that Rebecca would quote maybe take my place someday quote in 1957 . good morning early I went out as I thought literally broken who I believe is going to maybe fix my place someday to see her first nation just recently also is hope that Billy Paul would quote fully be a prophet sent from God end quote in 1951 I pray to that and also a hope that Joseph his son would be a prophet as he hoped in 1959. I said Joseph my son [Music] and of course friends we know Joseph brennam is not a prophet and I have a video about that topic if you'd like to know why by God's grace so this topic of Daniel 70 weeks doesn't pertain to Salvation so if you disagree by God's grace I hope we'll disagree as brothers and not as enemies there's a very simple outline for this video I'll first show the correct calculation by God's grace and then second five reasons to support this calculation so let's start with the correct calculation to begin with Daniel 9 verse 24 says 70 weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city and so according to Genesis 29 verse 27 one week equals seven years so 70 weeks equals 490 years so God told Daniel Israel had 490 years to complete the six-fold purpose of Daniel 70 weeks in Daniel 9 verse 24 and brother random preached an entire sermon on the six-fold purpose which you can listen to by God's grace but to summarize it there were basically 490 years left for God to deal with Israel before the Millennium because after the 490 years God would bring in Everlasting righteousness which would be the one thousand year Millennial reign so here's a screenshot to show how God divided up the 70 weeks of Daniel in Daniel 9 24 God said there were 70 weeks and then in Daniel 9 25 the scripture says from the going forth of the Commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the prince shall be seven weeks if you pause right there that means the first division of the 70 weeks would be seven weeks or 49 years until the Jewish temple was built again along with the wall even in trouble as times now the second division is a group of 62 weeks or 434 years and these are mentioned in Daniel 9 25 and Daniel 9 26 and notice Daniel 9 26 and after a three score in two weeks shall Messiah be cut off so we see here plainly the Bible says Jesus Christ the Messiah would be cut off or crucified after three score in two weeks or 62 weeks now you have to take those 62 weeks 434 years and add them to the previous seven weeks that were mentioned earlier in Daniel 9 25. so 434 years the 62 weeks plus the previous 49 years or seven weeks makes 483 years according to Daniel 9 26 it would be 483 years until Jesus the Messiah was crucified or died then in Daniel 9 27 we see this last week out of the 70 weeks mentioned and it says quote and he shall confirm the Covenant with many for one week end quote so as we look at Daniel 9 24 through Daniel 9 27 we can now see the three divisions of time there's seven weeks until the Jewish temple was rebuilt and there were 62 more weeks until Jesus died and then there was a one week or seven year covenant made so these are the three divisions of the 70 weeks now the starting spot for Daniel 70 weeks has to be are the Xerxes Temple order to rebuild the Temple that took place in 445 BC as brother Brandon said let's listen to the quote the issue was given on the 14th day of March BC 445. the issue went forth the bill rebuild the Temple you understand it as you people have read the scriptures and so this prophecy of seven weeks or 49 years was fulfilled around 396 BC when Nehemiah finished the wall around Jerusalem the next division was 62 weeks mentioned in Daniel 9 26 and this would be 434 years from 396 BC which takes us to 38 A.D then brother Branham showed that Jesus rode into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday in 30 A.D and then brother random presented the apparent problem of not having the right calculation of dates laram said quote now God can't make it Miss end quote God can't make it Miss if he said it would be so many days and so many days if he says that so much is so much so what are we going to do now the BC 475 to 80 30 are Julian our stronghold years and then brother random showed how you have to subtract seven years from 38 A.D because the Jewish prophetic years are shorter than the solar years solar years are 365.25 days long but prophetic years are 360 days long so brother Ram show that's how you get the correct calculation for Jesus's crucifixion he said it was in 30 A.D let's listen to the quote on the back of a white View on Palm Sunday April the 2nd 80 30. Jesus wrote into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday 80 30. and now now from BC 445 to 80 30 is exactly 475 years now here's a visual I made that makes sense of quote the trouble end quote brother Brandon talked about or this discrepancy between solar years versus prophetic years so when you add 483 solar years to 4 45 BC you get 38 A.D which is an incorrect calculation but if you use prophetic years and you add 483 prophetic years so 445 BC you get 30 A.D which is the correct date of Jesus's crucifixion now friends this is proof Jesus did not preach the first three and a half years of the 70th week Jesus could not have preached the first three and a half years of the 70th week because the Bible said in Daniel 9 26 that after three score in two weeks shall Messiah be cut off so the Bible said Jesus was cut off after 69 weeks or the 62 weeks plus the seven weeks and notice the Bible did not say after three score in two weeks and a half week shall Messiah be cut off so we can't add to the Bible and say that Jesus was cut off after 62 and a half weeks the Bible said he was cut off after 62 weeks and so I believe this is both scriptural and mathematical proof that Jesus did not preach the first three and a half years of the seventh week of Daniel rather he preached the last three and a half years of the 69th week of Daniel and there's still one week or seven years left of time for Israel notice brother Graham said a difference of eight years so brother Ram saw the trouble between the solar years and the prophetic years but then he showed the solution as well the solution of course was using prophetic years or the prophetic calendar rather than the solar calendar and then brother random says we have the exact proof of the prophecy let's listen to the quote that was prophesied to come to pass in those 70 weeks never happened then so it is left for the last days now amen now the reason some people get this teaching mixed up is because in the same sermon the 70th week of Daniel 1961 brother random gave two different dates for Jesus crucifixion the first one we already heard was 30 A.D and then just four paragraphs later brother Brandon said they rejected Christ and killed him in ad33 let's listen to the quotes now Jesus Messiah wrote Into the City of Jerusalem Triumph on the back of a white you on Palm Sunday April the 2nd 80 30. Jesus wrote into Jerusalem on Palm Sunday 80 30. far from the time of the going forth to build the temple until the destroying uh when they rejected Christ and killed him in 1833 where Christ has killed is exactly 483 years so in the sermon brother Brandon gave two different dates for Jesus crucifixion of course anyone who's honest knows brother Brown was human and he made mistakes so in my humble opinion I believe brother random made a mistake when he said Christ died in 33 A.D I believe the first quote brother Brandon gave that Jesus died in 30 A.D because that's the only calculation that works with Daniel 70 weeks and fulfills the scripture of Daniel 9 26 that Messiah would be cut off after 69 weeks now I want to show some quotes where brother Ram says there's one week left for the Jews here in paragraph 105 he said there's one week left one week's yet determined let's listen to the quote what God did with the Jews just exactly what he said he would do and then 69 years I was born in 83 years but six to nine weeks and one week left one week set determined then in paragraph 165 brother Brandon said we've already had 69 weeks and there's one week left for the Jew let's listen to the quote if all this stuff was to take bases over in this time of the 70th weak the last week now if they've already had 69 weeks and lived in spin the way God said it didn't happen exactly the way God said it would do then there's one more weak promise to the Jews just get ready amen see listen how close we are last week seven the seventh year and then in paragraph 170 and shortly thereafter or the branch has the Roman Prince or the pope Antichrist will break the Covenant he makes with Israel after three and one half years well the brand said the pope Antichrist breaks the Covenant in the middle of the week and causes the Jewish sacrifice and oblation to cease that Israel will set up yet in the future they'll rebuild their Jewish temple and re-establish animal sacrifices in the future and the third time brother Ram says this Roman Prince Will Come in the middle of the week and break his Covenant with Israel let's listen to the quotes and remember once these two prophets going to do when they come this Beast this Prince that's your scatter the power of the Holy people what will they do he'll break his Covenant with them after three and a half years he'll ask them now go to share in the middle of the week three and a half days three and a half years brother I reach the Covenant and causes the sacrifice an album that they will have set up already because they'll go right back you are in churches you can be received in this image unto the Beast will have a fellowship we'll get rid of Communism where this swipe communism all the way out see and they can do it see and they'll do it but now what instead of uh and set up to this the daily worship sacrifice will come back into the city when the temple is rebuilt and this Priestess to come in the middle of this week will break his Covenant and do away with this sacrifice is he said he is scattered scattered and wanted to do any last storm to the consummation and then brother random in paragraph 221 says the two Jewish prophets likely Moses and Elijah or two men Anointed with their spirits will be killed and then resurrected right in the midst of the 70th week let's listen to the quote how many is it thousand Jordan preschool days three and a half years and then they should be killed in the street fight in the midst of this 70th week so you see where the 70 weeks of annual are you see where we're living at I think in my beloved friends we're at the end so friends this quote from 1961 is in direct opposition to brother Graham's later quotes in 1963 64-65 when he said Jesus preached the first three and a half years of the 70th week and so friends when you have two quotes that go directly against each other you have to take it back to the word and when you take these two different quotes back to Daniel 9 26 you find that the only one that makes sense is that the two future Jewish prophets preached the first three and a half years of Daniel's 70th week next let's look at five reasons to support this calculation first Daniel 9 26 says after Jesus died after the 69 weeks or after the 483 years from 445 BC and this can only be 30 A.D if you make Jesus death in 33 A.D then your number of years doesn't match Daniel 9 26. if you make Jesus death in 33 A.D then you're actually adding to the word of God you're adding to Daniel 9 26. remember Daniel 9 26 says after 60 and two weeks or after 69 weeks it does not say after 60 and 2 and 1/2 weeks we cannot add that half week we cannot add to the scriptures the second reason if you make Jesus the prince of Daniel 9 27 then Jesus overspreads the Abomination that makes desolation in the temple of God based on the word cause in Daniel 9 27. but second Thessalonians 2 verse 4 says the overspreading is done by the future Roman Prince or the pope Antichrist that exalts himself as God in the Jewish temple According to second Thessalonians 2 verse 4. who oppose it and exalteth himself above all that's called God or that is worshiped so that he is God sitteth in the temple of God showing himself that he is God and remember friends we have quotes from Brother Branham that support this as well let's listen to those quotes and notice the over spreading of abomination to make desolation the overspreading of abomination is domination what is that to do away with the overspreading of this to do away with that see they're overspreading uh that Roman power to conquer all the Sleeping virgins Jews and all will all be Roman or we won't be nothing yeah he'll break his Covenant in the middle of the week overspreading all the Abomination if it was the abomination of Jesus time when it rolling the core there with their propaganda it'll be Rome again it'll be Abomination again to the church to make Destiny and shall continue unto the consummation what will he do he'll continue it on onto the consummation at the end the third reason is that a complete or full 70th week or seven additional years are needed in order to allow the numerous prophecies to come to pass that are left in the scripture for example the two prophets of Revelation 11 have to prophesy before the 144 000 Jews are sealed with the baptism of the Holy Ghost because those two prophets are pointing the people to the Messiah the Lord Jesus Christ also there are more Jewish Martyrs that have to be martyred as taught by the fifth seal and so more time is needed for those Martyrs to give their lives and then more time is needed after the two prophets leave in Revelation 11 more time is needed for the trumpets and vowels to be sounded because remember the trumpets and vows have not sounded yet that's according to Revelation 7 verse 3 and Revelation 8 verse 7 because the first trumpet cannot sound until after the 144 000 Jews are sealed by the Holy Ghost and the proof of that is because the first trumpet destroys all the Green Grass and friends if we just look around us around the world there's still green grass so the first trumpet cannot even blow yet the fourth reason according to Daniel 9 27 Jesus did not establish a one week or seven year Covenant with Israel nor did Jesus death cause the Pharisees to stop sacrificing animals even after Jesus resurrection animal sacrifice happened in Jesus time according to Luke 2 24 Matthew 21 verse 13 and other scriptures but remember Daniel 9 27 said he the future Pope Antichrist would cause animal sacrifices to cease in the midst of the week so this has to be a future week which is the seven year Great Tribulation period and the fifth and final reason the date of 30 A.D allows Israel to have the 40-year probation period for rejecting the Messiah before judgment came in 70 A.D when Titus destroyed Jerusalem it seems God often uses 40-year probation period it was the same probation period God used with Israel as they wandered 40 years in the wilderness for their fear of the Canaanites before Joshua took the people into the land and then here we see god-giving Israel 40 years after the crucifixion of the Messiah until the Judgment came in 70 A.D when the Roman general Titus invaded Jerusalem and destroyed the Holy Temple and brought judgment upon Israel for rejecting their Messiah in closing friends I hope this video has been a help by the grace of God again this topic does not pertain to our Salvation as Gentiles we are saved by grace through faith in the New Covenant the Covenant of Jesus blood so we rejoice in that but of course the Revelation on this topic does give more light on the scriptures and I believe brother Brown's original teaching on it in 1961 was the correct teaching because it's the only one that allows Daniel 9 24 through 9 27 to work according to the mathematical calculations and the prophetic teachings from this context if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
