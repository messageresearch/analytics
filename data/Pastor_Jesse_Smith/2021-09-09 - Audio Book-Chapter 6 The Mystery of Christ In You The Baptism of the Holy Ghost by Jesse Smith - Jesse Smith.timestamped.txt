[0:00] chapter 6 the mystery of christ in you
[0:03] the baptism of the holy ghost
[0:06] chapter 6 includes footnotes numbers
[0:08] 804-971
[0:12] to whom god would make known what is the
[0:14] riches of the glory of this mystery
[0:17] among the gentiles which is christ in
[0:19] you the hope of glory colossians 1 27
[0:26] during your earthly journey you could
[0:28] have no greater privilege than for jesus
[0:30] christ spirit to permanently live inside
[0:32] you all the days of your life
[0:34] the epigraph shows how paul calls this
[0:37] abiding presence christ in you
[0:40] similarly jesus calls it the baptism of
[0:42] the holy ghost this permanency privilege
[0:45] was unavailable in the old testament and
[0:48] is one of the major purposes and
[0:49] benefits of the new testament
[0:53] the baptism of the holy ghost is one of
[0:54] the better promises contained in the
[0:57] better covenant
[0:58] or new testament
[1:00] god walked with adam and eden but he
[1:02] wanted something better
[1:04] now he wants to walk in you
[1:06] god says i will dwell in them and walk
[1:09] in them and i will be their god and they
[1:11] shall be my people
[1:14] the verse preceding the epigraph
[1:16] colossians 1 verse 26
[1:18] calls the holy ghost baptism
[1:20] the mystery which hath been hid from
[1:22] ages and from generations but now is
[1:25] made manifest to his saints
[1:28] the baptism of the holy ghost is a
[1:30] hidden mystery god purposely kept from
[1:32] ancient ages generations and saints
[1:36] as you'll soon see job david and other
[1:39] saints knew they lacked something or
[1:41] rather someone
[1:42] namely they lacked the comforter in
[1:44] their souls
[1:46] the spirit of truth the holy ghost
[1:50] beginning with moses and extending the
[1:51] next
[1:52] 1500 years the lord first had to show
[1:56] the weakness of the law through human
[1:57] flesh the failure of the law would
[2:00] magnify the need for the holy ghost
[2:02] baptism god then sent his son jesus as
[2:05] the first to be filled with and walk
[2:08] according to the holy spirit
[2:10] in the fullness of time the holy ghost
[2:12] came rushing into the believer's souls
[2:14] on the day of pentecost so man for the
[2:17] first time could walk not after the
[2:19] flesh but after the spirit
[2:23] the foretelling and announcing of the
[2:25] baptism of the holy ghost
[2:28] the prophets joel jeremiah and ezekiel
[2:31] foretold the permanent anointing of the
[2:33] baptism of the holy ghost
[2:35] some 800 and 600 years before christ
[2:38] this long-awaited promise of god's
[2:40] indwelling permanent power was first
[2:43] experienced on the day of pentecost in
[2:46] acts chapter 2.
[2:48] joel described this experience as god
[2:50] freely pouring out his spirit upon
[2:52] believers of all ages and peter
[2:55] validated joel by quoting him in acts 2
[2:58] verses 16-21
[3:01] jeremiah fashioned this baptism as god
[3:04] writing his commands upon the hearts of
[3:05] his believing children and the writer of
[3:08] hebrews confirmed this in hebrews 8
[3:10] verse 10
[3:12] ezekiel 36 27 says the holy ghost
[3:15] baptism or god's spirit within you would
[3:18] cause or empower god's saints to walk in
[3:21] his statutes keep and do his judgments
[3:26] the new testament opens with john the
[3:28] baptist baptizing repentant ones
[3:31] john is aware his baptism unto
[3:32] repentance is solely an immersion in
[3:35] water he knows he is sent to baptize
[3:38] with water
[3:39] his close relationship with god gave him
[3:41] knowledge to announce the coming messiah
[3:44] would baptize his followers with
[3:45] something greater than water the holy
[3:47] ghost
[3:48] mark 1 verse 8 records john saying i
[3:51] indeed have baptized you with water but
[3:54] he shall baptize you with the holy ghost
[3:57] although baptism unto repentance is a
[3:59] necessary experience
[4:00] john knew there was a greater experience
[4:02] than just being baptized in water
[4:06] mark 1 verses 9 through 12 records
[4:08] jesus's water baptism administered by
[4:11] john
[4:12] this was no ordinary baptism for the
[4:13] heavens opened and god's spirit
[4:15] descended in the form of a dove
[4:17] a parallel passage in john 1 33 says the
[4:21] spirit descended and remained upon
[4:23] christ
[4:24] indeed the spirit abode upon him
[4:27] luke 4 verse 1 describes jesus as being
[4:30] full of the holy ghost after john
[4:32] baptized him you conclude that jesus
[4:34] christ is the first to be baptized with
[4:37] the holy ghost and is commissioned to
[4:39] baptize others into this blessed
[4:41] fellowship after his resurrection
[4:44] this explains why jesus foretells his
[4:46] disciples they would experience the same
[4:48] holy ghost baptism he had saying ye
[4:51] shall drink indeed of my cup and be
[4:54] baptized with the baptism that i am
[4:55] baptized with
[4:57] jesus himself says he was sealed by the
[5:00] father and the word seal is repeatedly
[5:02] used by paul to describe the baptism of
[5:05] the holy ghost in second corinthians 1
[5:07] verse 22
[5:09] ephesians 1 verse 13
[5:11] and ephesians 4 30.
[5:15] the four gospels contain jesus's
[5:17] announcements of the baptism of the holy
[5:19] ghost during his earthly ministry after
[5:22] he himself was filled with god's spirit
[5:25] in the first year of jesus's public
[5:26] ministry you read his first extensive
[5:29] teaching on the baptism of the holy
[5:31] ghost found in john chapter 3 verses 1
[5:34] through 12 during his conversation with
[5:36] a pharisee named nicodemus
[5:38] four times jesus says believers must be
[5:41] born again
[5:42] or born of the spirit
[5:44] christ foretold the sudden powerful
[5:47] appearing of the soul baptism by
[5:49] comparing it to the wind
[5:51] the wind bloweth where it listeth and
[5:53] thou hears the sound thereof but can't
[5:56] not tell whence it cometh and whither it
[5:58] goeth so is everyone that is born of the
[6:00] spirit
[6:02] when nicodemus couldn't understand the
[6:04] born-again requirement jesus challenged
[6:06] him by saying
[6:07] art thou a master of israel and knoweth
[6:10] not these things
[6:12] it seems jesus expected a master scholar
[6:15] like nicodemus to recall the
[6:17] aforementioned old testament prophecies
[6:20] of the holy ghost from joel jeremiah and
[6:23] ezekiel
[6:25] in jesus second year ministry he
[6:27] preaches the sermon on the mount
[6:29] christ's fourth beatitude hints of the
[6:32] baptism of the holy ghost matthew 5 6
[6:35] says blessed are they which do hunger
[6:37] and thirst after righteousness for they
[6:40] should be filled
[6:41] later while teaching his disciples to
[6:43] pray messiah explains the simplicity in
[6:46] which we ask for the holy ghost and the
[6:48] heavenly father gives it
[6:50] luke 11 13 reads
[6:52] if ye then being evil know how to give
[6:55] good gifts unto your children how much
[6:57] more shall your heavenly father give the
[6:59] holy spirit to them that ask him
[7:03] during christ's third year of ministry
[7:05] he gave arguably the boldest most public
[7:08] invitation for the soon-to-be available
[7:11] baptism of the holy ghost in john
[7:13] chapter 7.
[7:14] verse 2 informs us jesus is with
[7:17] thousands of jews celebrating the feast
[7:19] of tabernacles in jerusalem
[7:22] 18th century theologian john gill
[7:25] provides contextual insight on the
[7:27] astounding meaning of this passage
[7:29] gil describes a jewish traditional
[7:31] ceremony of drawing and pouring water
[7:34] that occurred during the solemn assembly
[7:36] on the last day of the feast the eighth
[7:38] day in which no servile work was done
[7:41] since moses ordained this last feast to
[7:44] be a time of rejoicing in leviticus 23
[7:47] 40
[7:48] jews would shout and dance as the priest
[7:50] drew water from the pool of siloam and
[7:53] poured it into a basin at the altar to
[7:56] fulfill isaiah 12 3
[7:58] therefore with joy shall you draw water
[8:01] out of the wells of salvation
[8:03] this ceremony had dual purposes
[8:06] the first was to rejoice in god's annual
[8:08] pouring out of the water of his spirit
[8:11] to wash and forgive israel through the
[8:13] day of atonement
[8:15] second prayer was offered beseeching god
[8:18] for sufficient natural reigns for the
[8:20] ensuing agricultural year
[8:23] israel was approaching god in
[8:24] thanksgiving for the waters of
[8:26] forgiveness and seeking god for natural
[8:29] water for their crops
[8:31] at some point on the last day of that
[8:33] great day of the feast jesus stood and
[8:36] cried saying if any man thirst let him
[8:39] come unto me and drink he that believeth
[8:41] on me as the scripture hath said out of
[8:44] his belly shall flow rivers of living
[8:46] water
[8:48] john 7 39 says christ was referring to
[8:51] the living waters of the holy spirit
[8:53] that would be given after jesus receives
[8:55] his glorified body following his
[8:57] resurrection
[8:59] more about jesus's glorified body will
[9:01] be explained later in this chapter
[9:03] but imagine the thousands of jews silent
[9:05] and stunned
[9:06] viewing the young controversial rabbi
[9:09] loudly declaring he was offering eternal
[9:12] water greater than the upcoming reigns
[9:15] israelis were trusting in to sustain
[9:17] their natural life
[9:19] jesus was the very god they were praying
[9:21] to standing among them offering them
[9:24] eternal water for their souls
[9:27] shortly before his arrest and
[9:28] crucifixion in his third and final year
[9:31] of ministry christ taught his apostles
[9:33] about the holy ghost baptism during
[9:35] their final intimate hours after the
[9:38] passover on their way to the garden of
[9:40] gethsemane in john chapters 14-17
[9:44] indeed christ promised to send another
[9:46] comforter even the spirit of truth later
[9:49] naming the comforter as the holy ghost
[9:52] who shall be in you christ continually
[9:54] emphasizes future dwelling inside his
[9:57] disciples
[9:58] meaning inside their souls saying i in
[10:01] you in john 14 20.
[10:04] jesus later says twice i in them
[10:07] in john 17 verse 23
[10:10] and 17 26
[10:13] on at least two occasions following his
[10:15] resurrection christ instructed his
[10:17] apostles to wait or tarry for the holy
[10:20] ghost which he refers to as the promise
[10:23] of the father
[10:24] despite following jesus and performing
[10:26] miracles for over three years the
[10:28] apostles were not born again
[10:31] jesus death and resurrection he urged
[10:34] his disciples to receive this baptism
[10:36] john 20 verse 22 reads and when he had
[10:39] said this he breathed on them and saith
[10:41] unto them receive ye the holy ghost
[10:44] some of his final words before leaving
[10:45] his disciples assured them he would send
[10:48] the baptism of the holy ghost recorded
[10:50] in acts 1 verses 5 through 8.
[10:53] christ uttered for john truly baptized
[10:56] with water but ye shall be baptized with
[10:58] the holy ghost not many days hence but
[11:00] ye shall receive power after that the
[11:02] holy ghost has come upon you
[11:05] finally fifty days after jesus
[11:07] resurrection on the day of pentecost 120
[11:10] disciples received the baptism of the
[11:12] holy ghost while tearing in an upper
[11:15] room
[11:16] acts 2 verse 4 records and they were all
[11:18] filled with the holy ghost and began to
[11:20] speak with other tongues as the spirit
[11:23] gave them utterance
[11:24] this holy spirit baptism caused the once
[11:27] timid and fearful disciples to flow into
[11:30] the streets of jerusalem
[11:32] and saturate the city with loud noisy
[11:34] praise
[11:35] at 9 am in the morning
[11:38] thankfully the same holy spirit is
[11:40] available to us today but many are
[11:42] confused about how and when he comes
[11:47] the confusion about the mystery of the
[11:49] holy ghost baptism
[11:51] the confusion around the baptism of the
[11:52] holy ghost doctrine or born-again
[11:54] experience is widespread and carries
[11:57] massive repercussions
[11:59] when and how is a believer baptized with
[12:01] the holy ghost
[12:04] the revelation of the holy ghost baptism
[12:06] is christ's spirit permanently
[12:08] indwelling and sealing marking the
[12:11] believer's soul as the third work of
[12:13] grace
[12:15] i'll first show the two false extremes
[12:18] most churches gravitate towards before
[12:20] using biblical proof to identify
[12:23] precisely when and how a believer is
[12:25] born again
[12:27] there are two extremes most churches
[12:28] erroneously gravitate towards
[12:31] unemotional confession or emotional
[12:34] speaking in unknown tongues
[12:36] evangelicals foster the unemotional
[12:38] confession while charismatics and
[12:41] pentecostal denominations demand
[12:43] emotional speaking in unknown tongues
[12:46] from this point forward charismatics and
[12:48] pentecostal denominations will be
[12:50] referred to in one group as charismatics
[12:54] many evangelicals say you're already
[12:56] born again as soon as you invite jesus
[12:58] into your heart or recite the sinner's
[13:01] prayer
[13:02] sadly no scripture teaches new believers
[13:04] to recite a scripted generic unemotional
[13:07] prayer to invite jesus into their hearts
[13:10] instead the book of acts models zealous
[13:12] repentance from sin followed by water
[13:14] baptism in the name of the lord jesus
[13:16] christ and then a sealing with the holy
[13:19] ghost baptism
[13:20] in most cases the born-again experience
[13:22] follows water baptism at a future date
[13:25] true repentance is turning from and
[13:28] hating your previous sin which is often
[13:30] left out of the stoic evangelical
[13:33] salvation prayer
[13:35] the charismatics swing to the other
[13:37] extreme urging and requiring new
[13:40] believers to emotionally utter unknown
[13:42] words as evidence of being born again
[13:45] while having an emotional experience
[13:47] with god is impactful
[13:48] speaking in unknown tongues as the
[13:51] evidence of being born again is
[13:53] unscriptural
[13:54] on the day of pentecost all 17
[13:56] nationalities heard and understood peter
[14:00] and the christians declaring the
[14:02] wonderful works of god in their own
[14:04] native languages
[14:05] the 120 believers spoke in other
[14:07] languages unknown to them such as
[14:10] iranian greek persian latin coptic and
[14:14] more but the tongues were all understood
[14:18] modern charismatic showcase their
[14:20] erroneous teachings when they speak in
[14:22] unknown tongues and no one understands
[14:24] their words
[14:26] in acts chapter 2 all inspired tongues
[14:28] were understood by the hears
[14:30] today in charismatic churches most
[14:32] tongues confuse the hearers
[14:35] god is not the author of confusion in
[14:37] the assembly of the saints
[14:39] tongues as the evidence churches are
[14:41] majoring on a minor emphasizing the gift
[14:44] of tongues rather than the giver of the
[14:46] gifts
[14:47] figure 15 shows the correct middle of
[14:50] the road approach to the holy ghost and
[14:52] the two erroneous approaches that are on
[14:54] the fringes of the road to
[14:56] heaven
[14:58] figure 15 extreme emphasis on confession
[15:02] dangerous fringe
[15:04] on one fringe the new believer publicly
[15:07] confesses faith in jesus christ as
[15:09] savior but neither seeks nor shows
[15:11] emotion
[15:12] his clergy completely avoid using the
[15:14] baptism of the holy ghost terminology
[15:17] despite the fact jesus used it in acts 1
[15:20] verse 5.
[15:22] true baptism of the holy ghost middle of
[15:25] the road in the middle of the road lays
[15:27] the truth the believer publicly
[15:29] confesses faith in jesus christ and
[15:32] seeks to receive god's spirit with a
[15:34] bold liberating emotional experience
[15:37] based upon god's choosing the believer
[15:40] may prophesy speak in an unknown tongue
[15:43] shout weep dance scream or show other
[15:46] emotions
[15:48] sinners who witness this experience
[15:50] would call the believer drunk
[15:53] extreme emphasis on tongues
[15:55] dangerous fringe
[15:57] on the other fringe after publicly
[15:59] confessing faith in jesus christ as
[16:01] savior the believer seeks to boldly
[16:04] speak with unknown tongues as the
[16:06] evidence of the new birth based upon
[16:08] man's choosing in acts 2 all the tongues
[16:11] were understood but today few or none
[16:14] understand what is spoken when people
[16:16] speak in tongues
[16:17] sadly this believer seeks the unknown
[16:19] tongue's gift rather than the giver of
[16:22] the gifts the holy ghost
[16:25] the negative repercussions of both
[16:27] fringe teachings hurt millions of
[16:30] church-goers because they lack the
[16:32] permanent indwelling presence of christ
[16:35] the baptism of the holy ghost is a seal
[16:37] unto the day of redemption
[16:39] meaning it's a permanent mark of god's
[16:41] anointing and influence upon a
[16:44] believer's soul
[16:45] this anointing never leaves the believer
[16:48] without this permanent seal the
[16:49] evangelicals and charismatics are like
[16:52] jesus's description of homeowners who
[16:55] build their houses upon sand rather than
[16:58] rock in matthew 7 verses 24 through 27.
[17:03] when the storms of life come in various
[17:05] forms of temptations those without the
[17:07] permanent seal of god often see their
[17:09] testimony fall apart as they indulge in
[17:12] adultery greed idolatry drugs and other
[17:16] sins
[17:17] temporary testimonies abound in their
[17:19] churches rather than permanent lifelong
[17:22] memorials of obedience and dedication to
[17:25] the glory of jesus christ
[17:28] for evangelicals many are deprived of
[17:30] personally experiencing god's power in
[17:33] any form
[17:34] in luke 24 verse 49 jesus says believers
[17:37] are endued or clothed with power upon
[17:40] receiving the holy ghost
[17:42] but unemotional confessions usually lead
[17:45] to compromising sin loving church
[17:47] members because they never receive god's
[17:50] power to overcome temptations
[17:53] without supernatural power church
[17:55] members submit to temptations and learn
[17:57] to live in idolatrous sins under the
[18:00] guise of liberty or freedom in christ
[18:03] as second timothy 3 verse 5 says they
[18:06] have a form of godliness but deny the
[18:08] power thereof
[18:11] charismatics exalt personal experience
[18:14] above bible truth
[18:15] while they may experience god's power in
[18:17] the form of emotional tongue speaking
[18:20] they often stop short of experiencing
[18:22] god's power in their souls
[18:24] hebrews 4 verse 10 speaks of this power
[18:27] calling it a rest from selfish
[18:30] individual works
[18:31] the repercussion then of exalting tongue
[18:34] speaking above the true holy ghost
[18:37] baptism in the soul
[18:38] is coming short of the new birth and
[18:40] god's full inheritance
[18:42] just as israel tasted the massive grapes
[18:45] of canaan before rejecting god's leading
[18:48] to possess the land
[18:49] charismatic's taste of the glorious
[18:51] gifts of the holy ghost
[18:53] like tongue speaking but reject god's
[18:55] desire to possess their every decision
[18:59] the obvious result for charismatics is
[19:01] wandering for decades in the same false
[19:03] doctrine of unknown tongues as the
[19:05] evidence of the holy ghost just as
[19:07] israel wandered in the wilderness for 40
[19:09] years
[19:12] biblical evidence for the revelation of
[19:14] the holy ghost baptism
[19:17] now that the two extremes have been
[19:18] described and debunked here is biblical
[19:21] proof for when and how a believer is
[19:24] baptized with the holy ghost
[19:26] when is a believer baptized with the
[19:28] holy ghost
[19:29] a christian is born again sometime after
[19:32] he is justified saved
[19:34] and completely sanctified rid of sinful
[19:37] habits
[19:38] in short you're born again after the
[19:40] first two works of grace are complete
[19:43] chapter 5 fully details the three works
[19:46] of grace needed for god's spirit to
[19:48] completely possess a christian
[19:50] justification sanctification
[19:52] and the baptism of the holy ghost
[19:54] god gives the holy ghost the third work
[19:56] of grace
[19:58] to them that obey him by being justified
[20:00] and sanctified
[20:02] four examples from the book of acts
[20:04] validate this truth
[20:06] the first text acts 1 verses 12 through
[20:09] 15
[20:10] records about 120 christians
[20:14] which included jesus's 11 remaining
[20:16] apostles
[20:17] and godly women gathering in an upper
[20:20] room in jerusalem to receive the holy
[20:22] ghost
[20:23] when did they receive the holy ghost
[20:25] 10 days later after god finished
[20:27] sanctifying them acts 2 verses 1 through
[20:30] 4 describes their holy ghost baptisms
[20:33] the holy ghost fell in a group setting
[20:36] as they all continued with one accord in
[20:38] prayer and supplication in the upper
[20:41] room for ten days
[20:43] although they were saved at different
[20:44] times before gathering in the upper room
[20:46] their complete sanctification came at
[20:49] the same time through group prayer and
[20:51] supplication
[20:53] consider the three works of grace in the
[20:55] life of mary the mother of jesus
[20:58] she was saved at some point prior to her
[21:00] meeting with elizabeth for she declared
[21:03] god as her savior in luke 1 verses 46
[21:06] and 47
[21:07] and mary said my soul doth magnify the
[21:10] lord and my spirit hath rejoiced in god
[21:12] my savior
[21:14] mary's sanctification must have lasted
[21:16] well over 30 years
[21:18] she first had to give birth to jesus and
[21:20] then his ministry began at the age of 30
[21:23] and lasted over three years but the
[21:25] faithful god finished her sanctification
[21:27] by giving her the gift of the holy ghost
[21:29] at pentecost
[21:31] mary is recorded as being in the upper
[21:33] room in acts 1 verse 14.
[21:36] acts 8 verses 5 through 25 is a second
[21:40] text about philip's evangelistic
[21:42] ministry in the city of samaria
[21:45] when did the samaritans receive the
[21:46] baptism of the holy ghost
[21:48] after peter and john laid hands on them
[21:51] and prayed for them to receive the holy
[21:53] ghost
[21:54] it's crucial to recognize that the
[21:55] samaritans were already believers before
[21:58] peter and john laid hands on them for
[22:00] they had seen miracles and were baptized
[22:02] in water
[22:04] this text wonderfully proves the
[22:06] difference between water baptism and the
[22:08] holy ghost baptism as you can believe in
[22:11] jesus christ
[22:12] have been baptized in his name and yet
[22:15] still not be baptized with the holy
[22:16] ghost in your soul
[22:18] reading acts 8 15-17 unveils this
[22:22] revelation
[22:23] for peter and john had to pray for the
[22:25] samaritans to receive the holy ghost
[22:27] because he was fallen upon none of them
[22:30] only they were baptized in the name of
[22:32] the lord jesus
[22:34] then they laid their hands on them and
[22:35] they received the holy ghost
[22:37] what you and every believer needs today
[22:40] is the holy ghost to fall upon your soul
[22:42] baptizing your nature with god's divine
[22:45] nature
[22:46] although salvation is a magnificent step
[22:49] god wants complete preeminence in
[22:50] christians lives he wants believers
[22:53] daily empowered by the holy ghost
[22:57] the samaritans then quickly experienced
[22:59] the three works of grace
[23:01] in acts 8 verses 5-13 samaritans
[23:04] witnessed miracles and were justified
[23:07] being saved and baptized in the name of
[23:09] the lord jesus
[23:10] not the titles father son and holy ghost
[23:13] see chapter 1
[23:15] sanctification took place in their lives
[23:17] from the time they were baptized until
[23:19] peter and john arrived after news spread
[23:22] to jerusalem of their conversions
[23:24] the holy ghost fell upon them as peter
[23:26] and john lay their hands on them and
[23:29] prayed
[23:31] the third text of acts 10 verses 1
[23:34] through 48 shows a scene in caesarea in
[23:37] which gentiles in the house of cornelius
[23:40] the centurion received the baptism of
[23:42] the holy ghost
[23:43] when did cornelius and the many in his
[23:46] house receive this soul baptism
[23:49] they received the holy ghost baptism
[23:51] while peter preached to them
[23:52] acts 10 44 states while peter yet spake
[23:56] these words the holy ghost fell on all
[23:58] them which heard the word
[24:01] concerning the three works of grace
[24:03] cornelius and his household were already
[24:05] saved and sanctified before meeting
[24:08] peter
[24:09] acts 10 verses 36 and 37 proves
[24:12] cornelius had heard about christ and
[24:14] believed although he had not yet been
[24:16] water baptized peter said that word i
[24:20] say ye know
[24:21] which was the truth that god preached
[24:23] peace by jesus christ to israel
[24:26] consider how sanctified cornelius was
[24:29] before he met peter and compare your
[24:31] life to his for a moment
[24:34] scripture calls cornelius a devout man
[24:36] who constantly prayed fasted and gave
[24:39] alms to people in so much that the
[24:41] visiting angel told him heaven had a
[24:44] memorial of all his prayers and alms
[24:47] being in this sanctified condition it's
[24:49] easy to see how peter could preach a
[24:51] short 10 verse long sermon and the holy
[24:55] ghost could fall upon cornelius and his
[24:57] household forever baptizing their souls
[24:59] into the kingdom of god
[25:02] amazingly this text gives one more
[25:04] astounding fact many don't realize
[25:07] god can fill believers with the holy
[25:09] ghost before they are baptized in water
[25:12] yes god can send the spiritual soul
[25:15] baptism
[25:16] before a man knows about the natural
[25:18] water baptism
[25:20] acts 10 verses 47 and 48 records peter's
[25:24] command for cornelius and his house to
[25:27] be baptized in water after they had been
[25:29] baptized with the holy ghost saying
[25:32] can any man forbid water that these
[25:34] should not be baptized which have
[25:36] received the holy ghost as well as we
[25:38] and he commanded them to be baptized in
[25:40] the name of the lord then pray they him
[25:43] to tarry certain days
[25:45] you learn the physical act of being
[25:47] baptized in water doesn't save and
[25:49] forgive sins
[25:51] water alone has no virtue to save
[25:53] calling upon the lord in obedience to
[25:55] his command for repentance has virtue to
[25:58] save
[25:59] romans 10 verses 12 and 13 reads
[26:03] for there is no difference between the
[26:04] jew and the greek for the same lord over
[26:07] all is rich unto all that call upon him
[26:10] for whosoever shall call upon the name
[26:12] of the lord shall be saved
[26:15] water baptism is simply an outward
[26:17] expression of the inward work of grace
[26:19] that has taken place
[26:21] you also learn through the example of
[26:23] corneas household that anyone who is
[26:26] spiritually baptized with the holy ghost
[26:28] will immediately be baptized in water
[26:31] when commanded to do so
[26:34] before peter preached in his house
[26:36] carnius was already saved by believing
[26:38] in christ for the forgiveness of sins
[26:41] and was sanctified living a selfless
[26:43] life of prayer
[26:45] fasting and almsgiving
[26:47] no one knows why he hadn't yet been
[26:49] baptized in water but one possibility is
[26:52] there was a separation of jews and
[26:54] gentiles in those days
[26:56] cornelius a gentile would not have been
[26:58] allowed to be in the company of jews and
[27:00] therefore could not hear preaching about
[27:02] being baptized in water
[27:04] before peter's great sheep vision the
[27:06] jewish christians had not yet received
[27:08] the revelation of god's grace extending
[27:11] to the gentiles
[27:13] peter acknowledged the end of this jew
[27:15] gentile segregation saying of a truth i
[27:18] perceive that god is no respecter of
[27:20] persons
[27:22] in fact the whole point of peter's great
[27:24] sheep vision in acts 10 verses 9 through
[27:26] 16
[27:27] was to prepare him to see god pour out
[27:30] the holy ghost upon the gentiles whom he
[27:32] had previously considered too unclean to
[27:35] be god's people
[27:37] acts 19 verses 1 through 7 is a fourth
[27:41] text in which paul meets 12 disciples of
[27:43] john the baptist in ephesus
[27:46] a city in modern day turkey
[27:48] when did these 12 ephesians receive the
[27:51] baptism of the holy ghost
[27:53] after paul opened their understanding to
[27:55] the existence of the baptism of the holy
[27:57] ghost
[27:58] this shows believers can be justified
[28:00] and sanctified without having knowledge
[28:02] of the third work of grace the baptism
[28:04] of the holy ghost
[28:06] as taught in acts 18 verses 24 through
[28:09] 28 the ephesian church was led by its
[28:12] bold and eloquent teacher apollos he was
[28:15] mighty in the scriptures
[28:17] and instructed in the way of the lord
[28:19] apollos's fervency caused him to
[28:22] diligently and publicly proclaim the
[28:24] repentance doctrine of john the baptist
[28:27] undoubtedly his teaching caused
[28:28] believers to be justified and sanctified
[28:30] before god
[28:32] later aquila and priscilla helped
[28:35] increase apollos's understanding of the
[28:37] way of god and apollos mightily
[28:40] convinced the jews showing by the
[28:42] scriptures that jesus was christ
[28:44] apollos and his group were justified and
[28:47] sanctified but unaware of the holy ghost
[28:49] baptism until god sent his hand-picked
[28:52] apostle paul on his third and final
[28:55] missionary journey
[28:57] upon his arrival we are only told paul's
[29:00] one question for the saved and
[29:02] sanctified ephesians have ye received
[29:04] the holy ghost sin she believed
[29:07] paul didn't doubt their belief in christ
[29:09] he wondered whether christ was inside
[29:11] their souls
[29:12] their response was that they had not
[29:14] heard of the holy ghost baptism
[29:17] paul knew what most preachers today do
[29:19] not
[29:20] the holy ghost fills you sometime after
[29:22] you believe not when you believe
[29:25] god doesn't fill a vessel until it is
[29:27] justified or declared his and also
[29:30] sanctified or cleaned out
[29:32] you wouldn't immediately use a cup you
[29:34] found laying on the grass at the park no
[29:37] matter how pretty or what the name brand
[29:39] was
[29:40] you'd first take it home and wash it
[29:42] before filling and using it
[29:44] god showed paul the three works of grace
[29:47] and he wrote the same in ephesians 1
[29:49] verse 13 saying
[29:50] in whom also after that ye believed you
[29:53] were sealed with that holy spirit of
[29:55] promise
[29:56] the holy ghost filling comes sometime
[29:59] after you believe as a seal for your
[30:01] soul
[30:02] truly acts chapters 2 8 and 10 agree
[30:06] with chapter
[30:07] and validate christians receive the holy
[30:10] ghost after believing or after their
[30:12] moment of salvation
[30:14] and after being sanctified from sinful
[30:16] habits
[30:18] two more points can be made from paul's
[30:21] ephesus visit
[30:22] first in paul's day there were two
[30:24] different water baptisms
[30:26] john the baptists and the lord jesus
[30:29] christ baptism
[30:31] john the baptist's water baptism
[30:33] represented repentance unto salvation
[30:36] but the lord jesus christ water baptism
[30:38] represented the desire to obtain the
[30:40] spiritual soul baptism of the holy ghost
[30:44] this situation was prevalent in paul's
[30:46] day because believers were leaving the
[30:48] old testament for the new
[30:50] and john's baptism was a preliminary act
[30:53] to prepare the way of the lord meaning
[30:56] it prepared new testament believers for
[30:58] the spiritual baptism of the holy ghost
[31:01] the lord jesus christ water baptism with
[31:04] the promise to receive the baptism of
[31:05] the holy ghost is your golden
[31:07] opportunity to enter god's kingdom
[31:10] the ephesians could not be born again
[31:12] without knowledge of and obedience to
[31:14] the lord jesus christ water baptism
[31:17] because they were ignorant of its
[31:18] existence
[31:19] nor can believers today be born again
[31:22] without the knowledge of the full soul
[31:24] baptism of the holy ghost
[31:26] this two baptism situation still exists
[31:29] today in a different form because most
[31:31] churches don't teach the necessary
[31:33] doctrine that the water baptism is
[31:35] different from the soul baptism most
[31:38] clergy tell new converts they are
[31:40] already born again when they are water
[31:42] baptized but this is a major error
[31:46] a second point is that god allows
[31:47] re-baptism in water acts 19 verses 3
[31:51] through 5 says the ephesians were
[31:53] already water baptized unto john's water
[31:56] baptism but paul informed them they
[31:58] needed to be water baptized
[32:00] in the literal name of the lord jesus
[32:03] the ephesians knew of and believed in
[32:05] christ but were ignorant of the lord
[32:07] jesus christ water baptism
[32:09] upon their obedience and water baptisms
[32:12] paul laid his hands upon them and the
[32:14] holy ghost came on them
[32:17] in your case you may need re-baptized
[32:20] and this is acceptable unto god
[32:22] according to acts 19 verses 1-7
[32:25] if you were sprinkled or if the title's
[32:27] father-son holy ghost were invoked at
[32:30] your previous baptism you need
[32:32] re-baptized fully immersed in water
[32:34] while calling upon the literal name of
[32:36] the lord jesus christ
[32:38] a few of my brothers were sprinkled as
[32:40] babies but upon seeing god's revelation
[32:42] of the lord jesus christ baptism they
[32:45] were gladly re-baptized and filled with
[32:47] the holy ghost afterwards
[32:49] in my life i was wrongly baptized in the
[32:52] titles father son and holy ghost and
[32:54] also in the jesus only format but god
[32:57] graciously allowed me to be correctly
[32:59] baptized on my third attempt in the name
[33:02] of the lord jesus christ
[33:03] god's peace will fill your soul when
[33:05] you've been correctly baptized in water
[33:08] and spiritually baptized with the holy
[33:10] ghost
[33:12] how is a believer baptized with the holy
[33:14] ghost
[33:15] he's born again by the spirit of god
[33:17] falling into his soul from heaven
[33:19] causing a bold liberating emotional
[33:21] worship experience
[33:23] i call it the see and hear principle
[33:25] because that is what peter called it
[33:28] every time a believer was filled with
[33:29] the holy ghost in the book of acts
[33:31] observers could see and hear the outward
[33:34] effects of their inward soul baptism
[33:37] just as you see and hear a natural
[33:39] baby's birth you see and hear a
[33:41] christian spiritual birth
[33:43] five texts from the book of acts
[33:45] illustrate this revelation and acts 11
[33:48] 15 proves the holy ghost will fall into
[33:50] the souls of men in a similar worshipful
[33:53] manner every time
[33:55] and as i began to speak the holy ghost
[33:57] fell on them as on us at the beginning
[34:00] yes the spiritual birth experience will
[34:02] be a bold liberating worship experience
[34:05] for every christian
[34:08] every christian must have an experience
[34:10] of being baptized with the holy ghost
[34:12] but not every experience is exactly the
[34:14] same
[34:15] there is not one specific outward
[34:17] evidence of the soul baptism as i'll
[34:20] soon explain there can be varieties of
[34:22] expressions at the literal moment of
[34:24] receiving the baptism of the holy ghost
[34:27] such as speaking in tongues so others
[34:29] can understand the gospel
[34:31] declaring god's wonderful works
[34:33] prophesying or magnifying god but each
[34:36] experience is unashamedly life-changing
[34:39] a believer's experience must also be
[34:42] word based meaning the christian can
[34:44] identify how his experience matches one
[34:47] of those in the book of acts when the
[34:49] holy ghost fell upon souls
[34:51] it's as if you were there in the upper
[34:53] room in acts chapter 2 because you've
[34:55] had a similar experience
[34:57] lyrics to isaiah martin's 1906 hymn i'm
[35:01] glad i'm one of them joyfully ring in
[35:03] the hearts of all born again believers
[35:06] they were gathered in the upper room all
[35:08] praying in his name they were baptized
[35:10] with the holy ghost and power for
[35:12] service came now what he did for them
[35:14] that day he'll do for you the same i'm
[35:17] so glad that i can say i'm one of them
[35:20] one of them one of them i'm so glad that
[35:22] i can say i'm one of them
[35:24] one of them one of them i'm so glad that
[35:27] i can say i'm one of them
[35:30] while emotion comes with a see and hear
[35:33] experience it's not the focus of it lots
[35:36] of worshipers get emotional but never
[35:38] fully repent of their sins to experience
[35:40] a changed life the focus at the
[35:42] beginning of the sea and hear experience
[35:45] is lovingly praising god while asking
[35:47] him to fill your soul
[35:48] our father loves to hear his children
[35:50] pray and ask him to fulfill his word
[35:53] just as earthly fathers enjoy meeting
[35:55] their children's requests
[35:58] jesus says in luke 11 13 if ye then
[36:01] being evil know how to give good gifts
[36:03] unto your children how much more shall
[36:05] your heavenly father give the holy
[36:07] spirit to them that ask him
[36:11] in acts 2 verses 1 through 33 peter
[36:14] originates the see and hear principle by
[36:16] telling the multitude therefore being by
[36:19] the right hand of god exalted and having
[36:21] received of the father the promise of
[36:23] the holy ghost he has shed forth this
[36:26] which ye now see in here
[36:28] earlier in the chapter the 120 believers
[36:30] got so full of the holy ghost that they
[36:33] left the upper room and went into the
[36:34] streets of jerusalem about 9 am
[36:37] declaring the wonderful works of god in
[36:40] such a way that they were accused of
[36:42] being drunk on wine
[36:44] the holy ghost and the souls of these
[36:46] freshly filled christians caused the
[36:48] praises of god to flow out of their
[36:50] souls
[36:51] into their minds and then further out
[36:53] into their bodies and mouths as they
[36:55] moved around the streets and boldly
[36:57] spake of god's works
[36:59] it's been said a natural birth is a mess
[37:02] and so is a spiritual birth
[37:04] all the joy loud worship emotion and
[37:07] victory comes flowing out at once
[37:09] it looks messy to the world like natural
[37:12] drunkenness but it's a spiritual birth
[37:14] it's an emergence it's eternal life
[37:18] acts 2 is not an unemotional scripted
[37:21] sinner's prayer experience
[37:23] this was the promised living water jesus
[37:25] spoke about flowing out of satisfied
[37:28] souls freshly filled with eternal life
[37:31] note how acts 2 verses 6 through 11
[37:34] teaches the multitude understood
[37:36] everything these holy ghost-filled
[37:38] galileans were saying
[37:41] the seeing here principle is seen a
[37:43] second time in acts 4 31 as recently
[37:47] born again christians prayed for
[37:49] boldness to speak god's word and
[37:51] scripture says the holy ghost filled all
[37:53] saints who were praying for this
[37:55] petition
[37:56] this powerful prayer meeting followed
[37:58] the miraculous healing of a lame man at
[38:00] the gate beautiful
[38:02] after performing the miracle through
[38:04] god's power peter and john were arrested
[38:06] and threatened to not speak jesus name
[38:09] anymore
[38:10] once released among the brethren again
[38:12] acts 4 verse 25 says they lifted up
[38:15] their voice to god with one accord their
[38:18] prayers asked for signs wonders and
[38:20] miracles to be done by the name of thy
[38:23] holy child jesus
[38:24] god was so pleased that he shook the
[38:27] building and those who had not been born
[38:29] again were immediately filled for the
[38:31] place was shaken where they were
[38:32] assembled together and they were all
[38:34] filled with the holy ghost and they
[38:36] spake the word of god with boldness
[38:39] observe all you can see and hear in this
[38:41] event a shaking building and many loud
[38:44] bold voices the heavenly father smiled
[38:47] as his spiritual babies were born
[38:50] acts 8 verses 14 through 25 depicts the
[38:54] samaritans receiving the baptism of the
[38:56] holy ghost
[38:57] and the seeing here principle is evident
[39:00] the same worship experience from acts 2
[39:02] in jerusalem is now happening nearly 100
[39:05] miles away in samaria
[39:07] after peter and john lay hands upon the
[39:10] samaritans and the holy ghost falls upon
[39:12] them
[39:12] a former sorcerer
[39:14] and recent christian convert named simon
[39:16] is so amazed by how the samaritans act
[39:19] upon receiving the holy ghost that he
[39:21] offers peter money if he will give him
[39:24] the power to lay hands on people to
[39:26] impart the holy ghost simon was well
[39:28] acquainted with seeing satan manipulate
[39:31] molest and bewitch people through his
[39:33] own evil sorceries but had never
[39:36] witnessed such genuine pure holy and
[39:39] righteous empowerment as saints
[39:41] receiving the baptism of the holy ghost
[39:44] ultimately simon pleads with peter for
[39:46] prayer that god will forgive him of
[39:48] thinking he could purchase the power to
[39:50] impart the holy ghost to believe her
[39:53] souls
[39:54] simon had to learn what john the baptist
[39:56] taught it is jesus christ alone who
[39:59] baptizes with the holy ghost not any
[40:01] other person
[40:04] a third text about how the holy ghost
[40:05] falls is acts 10 verses 44 through 48.
[40:10] though small this text and its
[40:12] description in the following chapter
[40:14] provides great support for the see and
[40:16] hear principle
[40:17] during peter's sermon inside corneos's
[40:19] house the gift of the holy ghost is
[40:22] poured out upon many gentiles
[40:24] the jews with peter heard them speak
[40:26] with tongues and magnify god
[40:29] praise and worship directed to god
[40:31] always flows out of the mouths of
[40:33] spiritual babes
[40:35] these tongues were no doubt understood
[40:37] by the jews and anyone else in hearing
[40:39] distance because peter later returned to
[40:42] jerusalem and told his jewish brethren
[40:44] that god gave the gentiles the gift of
[40:46] the holy ghost like as he did unto us
[40:49] acts 11 15 proves the holy ghost fell on
[40:53] gentiles in the same way it fell upon
[40:55] jews in acts chapter 2.
[40:58] additionally peter's jerusalem testimony
[41:01] in acts 11 teaches the presence of the
[41:03] holy ghost
[41:04] inside a holy ghost-filled believer's
[41:06] soul can recognize when someone else has
[41:09] received the baptism of the holy ghost
[41:12] watching the samaritans receive the holy
[41:13] ghost brought jesus's words to peter's
[41:16] remembrance
[41:17] and as i began to speak the holy ghost
[41:20] fell on them as on us at the beginning
[41:22] then remembered i the word of the lord
[41:25] how that he said john indeed baptized
[41:27] with water but ye shall be baptized with
[41:29] the holy ghost for as much then as god
[41:32] gave them the light gift as he did unto
[41:34] us who believed on the lord jesus christ
[41:37] what was i that i could withstand god
[41:39] when they heard these things they held
[41:41] their peace and glorified god saying
[41:43] then hath god also to the gentiles
[41:46] granted repentance unto life
[41:50] a believer with god's own eternal life
[41:52] can often recognize when a fellow
[41:54] believer is born again
[41:55] paul confirms this truth in romans 8
[41:58] verse 16 saying
[42:00] the spirit itself beareth witness with
[42:02] our spirit that we are the children of
[42:04] god
[42:05] first john 5 6 and verse 8 say
[42:09] it is the spirit that beareth witness
[42:11] because the spirit is truth and there
[42:14] are three that bear witness in earth the
[42:16] spirit and the water and the blood and
[42:18] these three agree in one
[42:22] the final time recorded in acts in which
[42:24] believers receive the holy ghost is
[42:27] chapter 19 verses one through seven and
[42:29] the seeing hear principle is displayed
[42:31] by two expressions
[42:33] speaking with tongues and prophesying
[42:36] acts 19 verse 6 says and when paul had
[42:38] laid his hands upon them the holy ghost
[42:40] came on them and they spake with tongues
[42:43] and prophesied god sent tongues to share
[42:46] his works with the ephesians
[42:48] it's implied that these disciples were
[42:50] not alone there must have been
[42:52] unbelievers amongst the group of 12
[42:54] because tongues are a sign for
[42:56] unbelievers not believers
[42:58] first corinthians 14 22 reads wherefore
[43:01] tongues are for a sign
[43:03] not to them that believe but to them
[43:05] that believe not
[43:07] prophecy a dramatic gift to assure
[43:09] believers of god's foreknowledge and
[43:11] omniscience
[43:12] accompany the tongues for telling things
[43:15] to come they would soon witness the
[43:16] fulfillment of
[43:18] revelation 19 verse 10 promises prophecy
[43:21] for those with jesus's spirit saying the
[43:23] testimony of jesus is the spirit of
[43:26] prophecy
[43:27] supernatural prophecy will be present
[43:29] among christians
[43:30] but no not all christians prophesy
[43:33] according to first corinthians 12 verses
[43:35] 29-31
[43:39] unknown tongues are not the evidence of
[43:41] the holy ghost baptism
[43:44] millions of charismatic churches
[43:45] worldwide erroneously teach speaking in
[43:48] unknown tongues is the initial evidence
[43:51] of the baptism of the holy ghost
[43:53] while the seeing here principle agrees
[43:55] believers must have an emotional bold
[43:58] and liberating worship experience at the
[44:00] initial moment of receiving the baptism
[44:02] of the holy ghost the bible allows for
[44:05] different expressions in the worship
[44:06] experience unknown tongue speaking is
[44:09] not the evidence of being born again
[44:12] six proofs validate this claim
[44:16] first all instances of speaking in
[44:18] tongues in the book of acts were
[44:20] understood by the hearers but today they
[44:23] are mostly unknown
[44:24] genuine tongues from the holy ghost in
[44:27] the book of acts were always understood
[44:29] by the hears when sent by god all
[44:31] hearers always understood what was said
[44:34] in acts 2 verses 4 through 12
[44:37] acts 10 verses 44 through 46
[44:40] and acts 19 verses 1 through 6 when the
[44:43] holy ghost fell and tongues were
[44:45] manifested
[44:46] the proof of this is found in acts 11
[44:48] 15. when peter said the holy ghost fell
[44:51] at the house of cornelius the same way
[44:53] it did on the day of pentecost
[44:56] since all the tongues that manifested on
[44:58] the day of pentecost were understood by
[45:00] the 17 nations of hearers
[45:02] than any other tongues given when the
[45:04] holy ghost fell in the book of acts had
[45:06] to be understood as well based upon the
[45:09] testimony of peter and the fact that god
[45:11] and his ways are unchanging in modern
[45:14] services there are usually unknown
[45:16] tongues and no one understands what is
[45:18] being spoken which is completely
[45:20] opposite of what took place in acts
[45:23] chapters 2 10 and 19.
[45:26] second the bible does not record tongues
[45:28] being manifested every time believers
[45:31] were born again
[45:32] speaking in tongues is mentioned three
[45:34] out of the five times in the book of
[45:36] acts when the holy ghost fell and filled
[45:38] believers but not five out of five this
[45:41] proof speaking in tongues is not present
[45:44] every time the holy ghost comes
[45:46] god must have a need to manifest the
[45:48] power of tongues or he will not send
[45:50] that manifestation
[45:52] known tongues were present in acts 2
[45:54] verses 1 through 5 acts 10 verses 44
[45:57] through 46
[45:59] and acts 19 verses 5 and 6 but not in
[46:02] acts 4 verse 31 and acts 8 verse 17.
[46:06] the two instances without tongues
[46:09] acts 4 verse 31 and acts 8 verse 17 show
[46:12] god must not have needed tongues because
[46:15] all the believers present spoke the same
[46:17] language
[46:19] third paul taught not all christians
[46:21] speak in tongues
[46:22] first corinthians 12 verses 29 through
[46:25] 31 says are all apostles
[46:28] are all prophets are all teachers are
[46:31] all workers of miracles have all the
[46:33] gifts of healing do all speak with
[46:35] tongues do all interpret but covet
[46:38] earnestly the best gifts and yet show i
[46:40] unto you a more excellent way
[46:44] paul's repeated questioning proves there
[46:46] is diversity in gifts of the holy ghost
[46:49] not all speak with tongues
[46:51] therefore it's wrong to try and convince
[46:53] every believer that they must speak in
[46:55] unknown tongues
[46:56] this ungodly teaching is like pressuring
[46:58] every christian to perform a miracle
[47:01] like satan twice pressured jesus to
[47:03] tempt his father to perform miracles
[47:06] note though paul wrote in 1st
[47:08] corinthians 14 verses 5 and 6 he wished
[47:11] all believers would speak in tongues
[47:13] because of the powerful edification that
[47:15] the gift brings to the individual and
[47:18] the potential edification it can bring
[47:20] to an entire congregation if the unknown
[47:23] tongue would be interpreted so everyone
[47:25] understood what the tongue said
[47:28] fourth tongues are signs for unbelievers
[47:32] not believers
[47:33] tongues are not a sign for believers
[47:36] according to first corinthians 14 22
[47:39] wherefore tongues are for a sign
[47:42] not to them that believe but to them
[47:44] that believe not
[47:45] but prophesying serveth not for them
[47:48] that believe not but for them which
[47:50] believe
[47:51] this means tongues cannot be assigned to
[47:53] believers who are seeking the baptism of
[47:55] the holy ghost yet many churches teach
[47:58] the opposite
[48:00] a man seeking the baptism of the holy
[48:02] ghost is already a believer and doesn't
[48:04] need the sign of speaking in unknown
[48:06] tongues to believe he is born again
[48:09] the seeker does need a sea in here
[48:11] experience but it's wrong to require him
[48:13] to speak in an unknown tongue
[48:15] gifts are determined by god not man
[48:18] first corinthians 12
[48:20] 11 and 18
[48:22] say god divides gifts to every man based
[48:25] upon his will as it pleases him
[48:29] in acts chapter 2 the first tongues were
[48:31] spoken by the 120 saints in order to get
[48:34] the unbelievers to believe this matches
[48:37] what paul says in first corinthians 14
[48:39] verse 22.
[48:41] tongues are assigned to unbelievers the
[48:43] 120 spoke in unknown tongues so the
[48:46] foreigners from 17 different locations
[48:49] could hear the wonderful works of god
[48:51] and then repent be baptized and fill
[48:54] with the holy ghost
[48:57] fifth no one knows the source of an
[48:59] unknown tongue without an interpretation
[49:02] the problem with unknown tongues being
[49:04] the absolute evidence a person is born
[49:06] again is that no one knows the source of
[49:08] the tongue unless it is interpreted and
[49:11] judged
[49:12] this is why paul says in first
[49:13] corinthians 14 verses 28 29 all tongues
[49:17] and interpretations need judged and if
[49:20] there are no interpreters for those who
[49:22] speak in unknown tongues the tongues
[49:24] should be kept silent in the church the
[49:26] fact is most initial evidence churches
[49:29] don't judge unknown tongues
[49:32] unknown tongues cannot be the evidence
[49:34] of the holy ghost baptism
[49:36] because if it is then you would have to
[49:38] accept every kind of unknown tongue from
[49:40] any person as in evidence of being born
[49:43] again but speaking in tongues can be
[49:45] easily impersonated by the devil and his
[49:48] servants
[49:49] as reports from missionaries verify this
[49:52] religious encyclopedias describe one of
[49:54] the evidences of demon possession as
[49:57] speaking in an unknown tongue commonly
[49:59] called glossolalia
[50:02] witches and other workers of witchcraft
[50:04] are not born again by the spirit of god
[50:06] just because they speak in unknown
[50:08] tongues
[50:10] god desires tongues of men and angels to
[50:13] be manifested among his people as paul
[50:15] taught that the gift of tongues should
[50:17] be in the church but it must be used
[50:19] properly and kept in order paul placed
[50:22] great emphasis on understanding the
[50:24] meaning of tongues in first corinthians
[50:26] 14 verses 6 11 and 19 saying unknown
[50:31] tongues only profit if they are
[50:33] interpreted
[50:34] the apostle said he'd rather speak five
[50:36] words with understanding than ten
[50:39] thousand in unknown tongues
[50:41] speakers and unknown tongues seem like
[50:43] barbarians to the listeners without
[50:45] interpretations
[50:47] the three thousand souls saved on the
[50:48] day of pentecost didn't think the 120
[50:52] holy ghost-filled saints were barbarians
[50:54] they understood the wonderful works of
[50:56] god they were declaring and received
[50:58] christ for themselves
[51:01] the holy ghost does not come with one
[51:04] mandated observation unknown tongues
[51:07] as jesus taught in luke 17 verse 20 the
[51:11] kingdom of god cometh not with
[51:12] observation
[51:14] it comes with a powerful dynamic worship
[51:16] experience others can see and hear
[51:19] a pure godly and overcoming life
[51:22] follows the see and hear experience
[51:24] which leads to the next proof
[51:26] unknown tongues are not in evidence of
[51:28] the new birth
[51:31] six jesus taught what the real evidence
[51:33] of receiving the holy ghost is and it
[51:36] isn't unknown tongues
[51:38] in john 14 verse 26
[51:41] and chapter 16 verse 13
[51:44] jesus says the evidence of being born
[51:45] again is being led by the spirit into
[51:47] all truth
[51:49] john 14 verse 26 reads
[51:51] but the comforter which is the holy
[51:53] ghost whom the father will send in my
[51:55] name he shall teach you all things and
[51:58] bring all things to your remembrance
[52:00] whatsoever i have said unto you
[52:02] john 16 verse 13 declares how be it when
[52:05] he the spirit of truth has come he will
[52:07] guide you into all truth for he shall
[52:09] not speak of himself but whatsoever he
[52:12] shall hear that shall he speak and he
[52:14] will show you things to
[52:16] come the evidence you are a child of god
[52:20] is that you can be taught to continually
[52:21] live a more holy obedient and righteous
[52:24] lifestyle
[52:25] john 6 verse 45 says it is written in
[52:28] the prophets and they shall be all
[52:30] taught of god every man therefore that
[52:33] hath heard and hath learned of the
[52:35] father cometh unto me
[52:37] this evidence manifested in christ's own
[52:40] earthly life
[52:41] luke 2 verse 52 says jesus increased in
[52:44] wisdom and stature and in favor with god
[52:47] and man
[52:48] christ's holy character will manifest in
[52:50] every believer's life
[52:52] meekness and humility are prerequisites
[52:54] for the high calling of living a
[52:56] christ-like life for jesus says
[52:59] take my yoke upon you and learn of me
[53:02] for i am meek and lowly in heart
[53:04] both sinners and christians are growing
[53:06] in their endeavors
[53:08] sinners will increase unto more
[53:09] ungodliness and evil men and seducers
[53:13] shall wax worse and worse
[53:15] deceiving and being deceived but
[53:17] christians grow up into him in all
[53:19] things even christ
[53:21] proverbs 4 verse 18 supports progressive
[53:24] holiness saying but the path of the just
[53:27] is as the shining light that shineth
[53:30] more and more unto the perfect day
[53:33] before concluding this subject i've
[53:35] personally witnessed numerous examples
[53:37] of people who spoke in tongues but later
[53:40] rejected righteousness and turned to
[53:42] unrighteousness
[53:44] these broken lives prove speaking in
[53:46] tongues is only a temporary anointing of
[53:48] a gift and not the seal or permanent
[53:51] abiding presence of christ
[53:53] two examples from my college days bear
[53:56] retelling
[53:58] first a friend alcohol graham confessed
[54:01] in tears that he pretended to speak in
[54:03] tongues during a revival service at his
[54:06] church
[54:07] he said he didn't want to pretend but
[54:09] felt intense pressure to perform an
[54:11] unknown tongue
[54:12] when the preacher stuck the microphone
[54:14] under his mouth and spoke to the entire
[54:17] congregation saying did you receive the
[54:19] holy ghost gram
[54:21] feeling singled out in front of the
[54:22] entire church and afraid the group would
[54:24] ridicule him if he didn't say yes he
[54:27] loudly answered yes
[54:29] unexpectedly the preacher stuck the
[54:31] microphone back into his face and
[54:33] shouted then speak in tongues for
[54:35] everyone to hear graham didn't have the
[54:37] courage to tell the truth so he
[54:39] blabbered an unknown tongue into the mic
[54:41] to the delight of the preacher and
[54:43] congregation
[54:45] my prayer is that graham has found
[54:47] forgiveness and redemption through the
[54:48] spirit of truth
[54:51] a second college friend i'll call billy
[54:54] got saved during his freshman year
[54:56] through a revival sponsored by an
[54:58] initial evidence church
[55:00] being tall handsome and charismatic the
[55:03] initial evidence church quickly groomed
[55:05] him to the pulpit as a preacher
[55:08] visiting their church i watched he and
[55:10] his fiancee repeatedly speak in unknown
[55:13] tongues afterwards i shared my differing
[55:15] opinion about the initial evidence but
[55:17] we agreed to disagree
[55:19] billy eventually married his fiancee but
[55:22] less than three years into their
[55:23] marriage his wife committed adultery
[55:25] with another man divorcing him and
[55:27] leaving him alone her adulterous act
[55:30] proved she never had the baptism of the
[55:32] holy ghost despite frequently speaking
[55:34] in unknown tongues because first
[55:36] corinthians 6 verses 9 through 10 says
[55:40] neither adulterers shall inherit the
[55:42] kingdom of god
[55:43] the sea of the holy ghost seals out
[55:45] satan's power to persuade believers to
[55:48] commit adultery among other sins
[55:51] billy's ex-wife may have had a genuine
[55:53] gift to speak in tongues but it was
[55:56] wrong for her church to teach her to
[55:58] seek after the gift of tongues rather
[56:00] than the giver of the gifts jesus christ
[56:03] had she received jesus christ our lord
[56:06] would have washed away her desire to
[56:08] commit adultery and she would be married
[56:10] to billy to this day
[56:12] speaking in unknown tongues can be
[56:14] easily impersonated as a carnal fleshly
[56:16] evidence but the real evidence is faith
[56:19] that produces the life of christ in a
[56:21] believer's daily life
[56:24] hebrews 11 verse 1 is the only new
[56:26] testament scripture that uses the word
[56:28] evidence and it never mentions unknown
[56:30] tongues now faith is the substance of
[56:33] things hoped for the evidence of things
[56:35] not seen
[56:36] invisible faith that produces
[56:38] progressively holy christ-like works is
[56:41] the evidence a christian has been truly
[56:43] born again
[56:47] more about the genuine evidence of the
[56:48] holy ghost baptism
[56:50] more can be said regarding the sixth
[56:52] reason why tongues isn't the evidence of
[56:54] the holy ghost baptism
[56:56] yes jesus taught the real evidence for
[56:58] receiving the baptism of the holy ghost
[57:00] as being guided by the holy spirit into
[57:02] all bible truth but he also provided
[57:05] concrete examples to help clarify the
[57:07] nature of the spirit's guidance
[57:10] a christian life guided into all truth
[57:12] includes
[57:13] love for other christians john 13 35
[57:17] says by this shall all men know that
[57:19] they are my disciples if you have love
[57:21] one to another
[57:23] supernatural signs and wonders done by
[57:25] the holy ghost
[57:27] mark 16 verses 17 and 18 says and these
[57:30] signs shall follow them that believe in
[57:33] my name shall they cast out devils speak
[57:35] with new tongues lay hands on the sick
[57:38] and they shall recover
[57:40] remembering jesus's words
[57:42] john 14 verse 26 says the holy ghost
[57:45] shall bring all things to your
[57:47] remembrance whatsoever i have said unto
[57:50] you
[57:51] testifying about and glorifying jesus
[57:54] john 15 26 and 16 14 say the spirit of
[57:59] truth he shall testify of me and he
[58:02] shall glorify me
[58:04] being convicted of and overcoming sin
[58:07] john 16 verse 8 and 1st john 5 verse 4
[58:11] say he will reprove the world of sin and
[58:14] for whatsoever is born of god overcometh
[58:17] the world
[58:19] knowing future events
[58:20] john 16 13 says the spirit of truth will
[58:24] show you things to come
[58:26] listening to and believing the human
[58:28] messengers sent to preach during their
[58:30] lifetimes
[58:32] john 17 verses 20 and 21 says
[58:35] neither pray i for these alone but for
[58:37] them also which shall believe on me
[58:39] through their word
[58:41] that they all may be one
[58:44] the above seven examples demonstrate the
[58:46] nature of the spirit's guidance for new
[58:49] testament believers but what about old
[58:51] testament saints
[58:52] generally speaking it can be said the
[58:54] spirit guided old testament saints into
[58:57] all of god's revelation available to
[58:59] them during their lifetimes
[59:01] they had to be in the word all the way
[59:03] for their day while saints like noah
[59:05] joshua caleb and john the baptist
[59:08] couldn't receive the baptism of the holy
[59:10] spirit in their souls they could be led
[59:12] by it
[59:14] noah is one of eight believers who were
[59:15] led by the spirit into all the truth for
[59:18] his day which meant living all of god's
[59:20] righteous commands and physically
[59:22] separating themselves into noah's ark
[59:25] before the flood
[59:26] the evidence noah's group were genuine
[59:28] believers was their full obedience to
[59:30] god's word in their lifetimes
[59:33] joshua and caleb were the only two out
[59:35] of the multitude that left egypt to
[59:37] inherit the promised land numbers 14
[59:40] verse 24 says caleb had another spirit
[59:43] and it was that spirit that led he and
[59:45] joshua to receive the messenger of their
[59:47] day moses
[59:49] and to obey all the truth of moses's
[59:51] message
[59:53] john the baptist was the messenger for
[59:54] his day and all true believers heard him
[59:57] confess their sins and repentance and
[59:59] were baptized
[1:00:01] in luke 7 verse 30 the pharisees and
[1:00:03] lawyers rejected god's counsel given to
[1:00:06] john and refused to be baptized
[1:00:09] consequently john called those who
[1:00:11] rejected his message a generation of
[1:00:13] vipers later in this chapter more will
[1:00:15] be taught on the holy ghost and the old
[1:00:17] testament saints
[1:00:21] unifying and differentiating terminology
[1:00:25] terminology about the baptism of the
[1:00:26] holy ghost needs both unified and
[1:00:29] differentiated from the other two works
[1:00:31] of grace
[1:00:32] chapter five covers the three works of
[1:00:34] grace justification sanctification and
[1:00:37] the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:00:40] it's absolutely essential for believers
[1:00:42] to have this understanding to rightly
[1:00:44] divide the word of truth about the three
[1:00:46] stages in a christian's experience
[1:00:48] without this understanding churches will
[1:00:50] falsely assure new believers who have
[1:00:53] only recently been baptized in water
[1:00:55] they are already born again
[1:00:57] but in reality the new believers are
[1:00:59] only justified not sanctified and
[1:01:02] certainly not endued with power from on
[1:01:04] high
[1:01:05] sadly i've witnessed a bible teacher try
[1:01:07] to convince children as young as five
[1:01:09] years old that they already had jesus
[1:01:12] full power and could do greater works
[1:01:14] than him misinterpreting john 14 verse
[1:01:16] 12
[1:01:17] yet most of these children did not show
[1:01:19] any fruits of repentance justification
[1:01:22] nor the signs of a sanctified
[1:01:24] transformed human spirit
[1:01:26] along with spreading confusion when
[1:01:28] teachers reject or are ignorant of the
[1:01:30] three works of grace the power of god is
[1:01:32] reduced to a stale emotionless moment of
[1:01:35] inviting jesus in your heart
[1:01:37] thankfully the bible offers us so much
[1:01:39] more hope than this
[1:01:42] figure 16 shows the three works of grace
[1:01:44] and unifies terminology for each stage
[1:01:47] the first stage justification is often
[1:01:50] referred to as being saved and ezekiel
[1:01:52] calls it the new heart
[1:01:54] justification corresponds to israel's
[1:01:56] exodus out of egypt wherein they were
[1:01:58] saved from bondage and cleansed through
[1:02:01] the red sea representing the new
[1:02:03] testament water baptism
[1:02:05] sanctification the second stage is
[1:02:08] called the new spirit by ezekiel because
[1:02:10] god is renewing the believer's mind or
[1:02:12] human spirit
[1:02:13] another word for sanctification is
[1:02:15] purification god cleans out the
[1:02:17] believer's mind in this stage
[1:02:19] in the purest sense it is a brainwashing
[1:02:22] or human spirit washing by the washing
[1:02:24] of water by the word
[1:02:26] formerly the christian was under the
[1:02:28] spirit of disobedience but
[1:02:30] sanctification teaches him to obey the
[1:02:32] word
[1:02:33] this stage corresponds to israel's
[1:02:35] wilderness journey in which they were
[1:02:36] tested or proved by god that he might
[1:02:39] know what was in thine heart whether
[1:02:41] israel would keep the commandments or no
[1:02:45] the baptism of the holy ghost is the
[1:02:47] third stage specifically reserved for
[1:02:49] new testament christians
[1:02:51] old testament saints could never attain
[1:02:53] to this stage because jesus blood had
[1:02:56] not yet atoned for mankind's sins and he
[1:02:59] was not yet glorified
[1:03:01] note this following list of terms and
[1:03:03] descriptors for the holy ghost baptism
[1:03:06] it far exceeds the previous two stages
[1:03:09] converted luke 22 32
[1:03:13] endued with power from on high luke 24
[1:03:16] 49

[1:04:05] the holy ghost titus 3 verse 5
[1:04:08] washed robes made white in the blood of
[1:04:10] the lamb revelation 7 verse 14
[1:04:15] most of these terms and phrases are not
[1:04:17] found in the old testament proving they
[1:04:19] were reserved by god for the new
[1:04:21] covenant when he would live in believers
[1:04:23] souls old testament believers cannot be
[1:04:25] labeled as born again baptized with the
[1:04:28] holy ghost sealed or regenerated only
[1:04:31] new testament believers are able to
[1:04:33] presently possess love eternal life the
[1:04:36] spirit of adoption and have god daily
[1:04:39] walking in them
[1:04:41] let it be clearly and emphatically
[1:04:43] stated that the following terms and
[1:04:45] phrases are speaking of the one and same
[1:04:47] experience of the baptism of the holy
[1:04:50] ghost
[1:04:51] new birth born again filled with the
[1:04:53] holy ghost sealed christ in you
[1:04:56] possessing eternal life converted
[1:04:59] adopted regenerated charity love and
[1:05:03] endued with power from on high
[1:05:06] for your benefit it bears revisiting
[1:05:08] that love and charity are identical
[1:05:10] terms and are synonymous for the baptism
[1:05:12] of the holy ghost
[1:05:14] the bible twice says god is love
[1:05:16] chapter one's section called god
[1:05:19] manifests himself in three ways
[1:05:21] introduces the truth that god the father
[1:05:24] and the holy ghost are the self-same
[1:05:26] person
[1:05:27] god is the holy spirit the person of
[1:05:29] love who comes to abide in your soul
[1:05:32] if this seems confusing go back and read
[1:05:34] chapter 5 section called
[1:05:36] character quality number 8 charity
[1:05:39] eight scriptures reveal this truth and
[1:05:41] help bring harmony to bible terminology
[1:05:44] about the holy ghost baptism
[1:05:48] the holy ghost baptism comes upon one of
[1:05:51] man's three parts
[1:05:53] as explored in chapter five every human
[1:05:56] has three parts to his or her being body
[1:05:59] human spirit and soul
[1:06:01] first thessalonians 5 23 provides this
[1:06:03] fact saying and the very god of peace
[1:06:06] sanctify you holy and i pray god your
[1:06:09] whole spirit and soul and body be
[1:06:12] preserved blameless unto the coming of
[1:06:14] our lord jesus christ
[1:06:16] figure 17 provides a visual of man's
[1:06:19] threefold division some may suggest man
[1:06:21] has fewer or more parts to his being but
[1:06:24] the bible limits it to only three parts
[1:06:28] if each man has three parts which part
[1:06:31] receives the seal of god or the baptism
[1:06:33] of the holy ghost that jesus promised
[1:06:35] the body spirit or soul
[1:06:37] recall jesus's words in john 7 verses 37
[1:06:41] through 39
[1:06:42] about the holy ghost not being given
[1:06:44] until after he was resurrected and
[1:06:46] glorified
[1:06:48] which part of man was awaiting a
[1:06:49] spiritual baptism the soul
[1:06:53] equipped with the knowledge that man has
[1:06:55] only three parts to his being you can
[1:06:57] use the process of elimination to rule
[1:06:59] out the two parts that do not experience
[1:07:01] the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:07:03] body and human spirit
[1:07:05] and find the part that does
[1:07:07] the soul
[1:07:10] the body does not receive the baptism of
[1:07:12] the holy ghost starting from the outside
[1:07:15] and working inward the body or flesh
[1:07:17] does not receive the baptism of the holy
[1:07:19] ghost
[1:07:20] paul says for i know that in me that is
[1:07:23] in my flesh dwelleth no good thing
[1:07:26] the apostle knew his flesh had a totally
[1:07:28] depraved sin nature twice more saying
[1:07:31] sin dwelt inside his flesh
[1:07:34] galatians 5 verse 17 says for the flesh
[1:07:37] lusteth against the spirit and the
[1:07:39] spirit against the flesh and these are
[1:07:41] contrary the one to the other so that ye
[1:07:44] cannot do the things that ye would
[1:07:47] the flesh is completely defiant against
[1:07:49] the holy spirit and always lusting after
[1:07:51] sin
[1:07:53] at times the flesh
[1:07:55] equipped with its five senses can
[1:07:57] certainly feel the anointing of the holy
[1:07:59] ghost but it is always temporary at
[1:08:02] paul's conversion on the damascus road
[1:08:04] in acts 9 verses 1 through 6 christ's
[1:08:07] heavenly light shines so brightly that
[1:08:10] he fell to the ground and physically
[1:08:11] trembled under jesus's holiness
[1:08:14] but paul wasn't baptized with the holy
[1:08:16] ghost until a later date
[1:08:18] after he received his eyesight and was
[1:08:20] baptized in water
[1:08:24] the human spirit does not receive the
[1:08:25] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:08:28] moving inward beyond the flesh is the
[1:08:30] human spirit or mind thinking takes
[1:08:33] place here in the human spirit this
[1:08:35] second part of man is the part that many
[1:08:37] erroneously say receives the seal of god
[1:08:40] but these professors are mistaken
[1:08:42] because the human mind needs daily
[1:08:44] renewed and refreshed by the holy ghost
[1:08:47] romans 12 verse 1 says a christian
[1:08:49] conforms or fashions his mind
[1:08:52] through spiritual transformation
[1:08:54] then ii corinthians 4 16 teaches this
[1:08:58] renewing happens daily
[1:09:00] for which cause we faint not but though
[1:09:02] our outward man perish yet the inward
[1:09:05] man is renewed day by day
[1:09:08] contrary-wise the baptism of the holy
[1:09:10] ghost or seal of god upon man's soul
[1:09:14] is a permanent anointing that lasts unto
[1:09:16] the day of redemption when god seals a
[1:09:19] man's soul the work is one and done
[1:09:22] but the human mind must be daily made
[1:09:24] new and forced to serve the law of god
[1:09:26] by man's freemore agency
[1:09:29] romans 7 verse 25 reads i thank god
[1:09:32] through jesus christ our lord so then
[1:09:34] with the mind i myself serve the law of
[1:09:36] god but with the flesh the law of sin
[1:09:42] the five aspects to the human spirit
[1:09:45] scripture teaches there are five aspects
[1:09:47] to the human spirit
[1:09:48] conscience memory reason affection and
[1:09:51] imagination
[1:09:53] each aspect is temporarily anointed by
[1:09:55] the holy ghost when the believer brings
[1:09:58] his mind into obedience to god's word
[1:10:00] it's noteworthy that the human spirit or
[1:10:02] mind is like a battlefield between satan
[1:10:05] and the believer
[1:10:06] the enemy has free access to your mind
[1:10:09] and can inject evil thoughts without
[1:10:11] your permission
[1:10:13] ephesians 6 16 likens this unto satan
[1:10:16] shooting fiery darts into your mind
[1:10:19] you can't stop him from attacking but
[1:10:21] you can stop the fiery darts from
[1:10:22] hitting you
[1:10:24] with the mighty weapons of your
[1:10:25] christian warfare such as the shield of
[1:10:27] faith you can cast down all imaginations
[1:10:30] and every high thing that exalts itself
[1:10:33] against god's word
[1:10:34] definitions and bible examples of these
[1:10:37] five aspects include
[1:10:40] conscience is the moral compass that
[1:10:42] guides man to recognizing right and
[1:10:44] wrong
[1:10:44] the scribes and pharisees were convicted
[1:10:46] by their own conscience
[1:10:48] and decided not to stone the woman
[1:10:50] caught in adultery after jesus directed
[1:10:52] them to examine their own guilt first
[1:10:55] before judging the
[1:10:56] woman
[1:10:58] memory is the ability to store and
[1:11:00] recall information
[1:11:02] peter's memory of jesus's promise to
[1:11:04] baptize with the holy ghost helped calm
[1:11:07] and convince jews that god had granted
[1:11:08] the gentiles repentance unto life in
[1:11:12] acts 11 verses 1-18
[1:11:14] one benefit of the baptism of the holy
[1:11:16] ghost is that he will bring all things
[1:11:19] to remembrance when needed
[1:11:22] reason is the ability to explain the
[1:11:24] cause or justification
[1:11:26] of an action or event
[1:11:28] jesus perceived the scribe's evil
[1:11:30] reasoning in mark 2 verses 1-8
[1:11:33] after messiah declared a paralyzed man
[1:11:36] forgiven the scribes silently reasoned
[1:11:39] jesus blasphemed because only god can
[1:11:41] forgive sins
[1:11:43] but christ proceeded to prove he was god
[1:11:45] by miraculously causing the man to walk
[1:11:48] godly reasoning is a powerful tool used
[1:11:51] to explain the scriptures as paul caused
[1:11:53] many thessalonians to believe the gospel
[1:11:56] by reasoning old testament scriptures
[1:11:59] about jesus's death and resurrection in
[1:12:01] acts 17 verses 1 through 4.
[1:12:05] affection is the emotional component of
[1:12:07] the human spirit
[1:12:09] paul says titus one of his fellow
[1:12:11] workers in the gospel had an abundant
[1:12:14] inward affection towards the believers
[1:12:16] in corinth all believers must set their
[1:12:19] affections on things above not on things
[1:12:22] on the earth
[1:12:24] imagination is the ability to mentally
[1:12:26] form new ideas concepts or images not
[1:12:30] present
[1:12:31] god flooded the earth in noah's day
[1:12:33] because every imagination of the
[1:12:34] thoughts of men's hearts were only evil
[1:12:37] continually
[1:12:39] christians use their imaginations to
[1:12:40] receive revelation from god as they
[1:12:43] consider the future joys of heaven which
[1:12:45] god has prepared for those he loves
[1:12:48] note how first corinthians 2 verses 9
[1:12:50] and 10 says god has already revealed
[1:12:53] unimaginable deep things to his children
[1:12:56] but as it is written i have not seen nor
[1:12:59] ear heard neither have entered into the
[1:13:02] heart of man the things which god hath
[1:13:04] prepared for them that love him but god
[1:13:06] hath revealed them unto us by his spirit
[1:13:09] for the spirit searcheth all things yea
[1:13:12] the deep things of god
[1:13:15] the supernatural human spirit
[1:13:18] man's human spirit is the supernatural
[1:13:20] part of him god designed to live for
[1:13:22] thousands or more years
[1:13:24] currently cain's human spirit is one of
[1:13:27] the millions that lived six thousand
[1:13:29] years ago in the days of man's origin
[1:13:32] the human spirit of cain and all the
[1:13:34] lost of his day
[1:13:35] are alive in hell awaiting judgment at
[1:13:38] the white throne
[1:13:39] first peter 3 verses 18 through 20
[1:13:42] teaches that jesus preached unto the
[1:13:44] spirits in prison who disobeyed noah's
[1:13:47] message and lived over 2000 years before
[1:13:50] christ's earthly ministry
[1:13:53] three biblical examples teach human
[1:13:55] spirits keep both their strengths and
[1:13:57] weaknesses or character even after death
[1:14:01] first the prophet samuel remained a
[1:14:03] prophet four years after his death when
[1:14:05] his spirit was called up to earth by the
[1:14:07] witch of endor his righteous character
[1:14:10] remained intact for he foretold or
[1:14:12] prophesied the death of saul and his
[1:14:14] sons the day before it happened proving
[1:14:16] he still had the prophetic gift in his
[1:14:18] human spirit once a prophet always a
[1:14:21] prophet
[1:14:22] interestingly this story also shows how
[1:14:24] a diviner or necromancer was able to
[1:14:27] bring up samuel's spirit from abraham's
[1:14:29] bosom
[1:14:30] thankfully this is no longer possible
[1:14:32] because jesus's death and descent into
[1:14:34] hell allowed him to take the keys of
[1:14:37] death and hell before resurrecting in
[1:14:39] power and leading the saints to heaven
[1:14:42] more on the keys of death and hell in
[1:14:44] the following section
[1:14:46] found in luke 16 verses 19 through 31
[1:14:50] jesus story of the rich man and beggar
[1:14:52] named lazarus is a second example of
[1:14:54] human spirits keeping their character
[1:14:57] after death
[1:14:58] following death the rich man finds
[1:15:00] himself tormented in the flames of hell
[1:15:02] while lazarus rests comfortably with
[1:15:04] abraham
[1:15:05] the rich man's human spirit remained
[1:15:07] prideful even after death as seen in his
[1:15:10] discourse with abraham
[1:15:12] having five brothers the rich man wanted
[1:15:14] abraham to send lazarus back from the
[1:15:16] dead to testify to his brothers so they
[1:15:19] would believe god's word and escape hell
[1:15:22] abraham refused saying his brothers only
[1:15:25] needed to hear moses and the prophets to
[1:15:27] be saved
[1:15:28] arrogantly the rich man tried to correct
[1:15:30] father abraham by saying the miracle of
[1:15:33] lazarus's raising from the dead would
[1:15:35] convince his brothers to be saved death
[1:15:38] never changed the rich man's selfish
[1:15:40] prideful character
[1:15:42] wisely abraham uttered if they hear not
[1:15:45] moses and the prophets neither will they
[1:15:47] be persuaded though one rose from the
[1:15:49] dead
[1:15:50] witnessing miracles does not bring
[1:15:51] salvation repentance from sin brings
[1:15:54] salvation
[1:15:56] a third example of human spirits keeping
[1:15:58] their character after death is the souls
[1:16:01] under the altar in revelation 6 verses 9
[1:16:04] through 11.
[1:16:05] in this fifth seal souls in the heavenly
[1:16:07] dimension are crying out for revenge you
[1:16:10] learn in chapter 2 of this book that
[1:16:12] these souls are jews who have been
[1:16:14] martyred for their faith in the word of
[1:16:15] god or old testament from the days of
[1:16:18] jesus to the present this includes all
[1:16:21] the slain jews during the new testament
[1:16:23] from the 1st century up to the 6 million
[1:16:25] jews murdered during the holocaust to
[1:16:28] the persecuted jews of today
[1:16:30] note they did not have the testimony of
[1:16:32] jesus christ like the apostle john had
[1:16:35] in revelation 1 verse 2
[1:16:37] and chapter 1 verse 9.
[1:16:39] yes these jews were faithful to moses
[1:16:41] law but their human spirits still seek
[1:16:44] vengeance for their blood the human
[1:16:46] spirits of holy ghost-filled christians
[1:16:48] seek not vengeance but ask forgiveness
[1:16:51] for their persecutors stephen the first
[1:16:53] recorded christian martyr by stoning
[1:16:56] kneel down at his death and cried with a
[1:16:58] loud voice lord lay not this sin to
[1:17:01] their charge
[1:17:02] the ultimate example of a human spirit
[1:17:04] offering forgiveness is jesus christ at
[1:17:07] his crucifixion
[1:17:08] messiah breathed father forgive them for
[1:17:11] they know not what they do
[1:17:15] the human spirit receives a temporary
[1:17:17] anointing
[1:17:18] the fact that the human spirit only
[1:17:20] receives a temporary anointing is a
[1:17:22] prominent revelation in this chapter
[1:17:24] every church that makes speaking in
[1:17:26] tongues the evidence of receiving the
[1:17:27] holy ghost
[1:17:28] fails this revelation
[1:17:30] because they only receive a temporary
[1:17:32] anointing on their human spirits rather
[1:17:34] than a permanent one the holy spirit
[1:17:36] anoints their minds causing them to
[1:17:38] operate the gift of tongues but the
[1:17:40] anointing eventually leaves
[1:17:43] afterwards worldliness usually creeps
[1:17:45] into their lives and genuine fruits of
[1:17:47] the holy spirit cannot be produced
[1:17:51] jesus promised believers power when
[1:17:53] baptized with the holy ghost but many
[1:17:55] tongue speakers only have power to speak
[1:17:57] in unknown tongues and lack the power to
[1:18:00] overcome the lusts of the eyes lust of
[1:18:02] the flesh and pride of life
[1:18:04] it does no good to utter unknown tongues
[1:18:06] at church but utter gossip cursing lies
[1:18:10] and praise for worldliness outside the
[1:18:12] church
[1:18:14] even born again christians battle the
[1:18:16] lusts and pride of life some mornings
[1:18:19] when you wake up your human spirit has
[1:18:21] backslid into total defiance to god's
[1:18:23] word and your flesh doesn't feel like
[1:18:25] seeking god through morning prayer and
[1:18:26] bible reading but as a spiritual king
[1:18:29] you must exercise dominion over both the
[1:18:32] flesh and human spirit bringing them
[1:18:34] into subjection to the holy ghost
[1:18:36] ruling over the flesh and spirit is
[1:18:38] walking in obedience to god's spirit
[1:18:41] living spiritually minded is your daily
[1:18:43] victory of life and peace
[1:18:45] romans 8 verses 4 through 7 says
[1:18:47] that the righteousness of the law might
[1:18:50] be fulfilled in us who walk not after
[1:18:52] the flesh but after the spirit
[1:18:54] for they that are after the flesh do
[1:18:56] mind the things of the flesh but they
[1:18:58] that are after the spirit the things of
[1:18:59] the spirit for to be carnally minded is
[1:19:02] death but to be spiritually minded is
[1:19:04] life and peace because the carnal mind
[1:19:06] is enmity against god for it is not
[1:19:09] subject to the law of god
[1:19:11] neither indeed can be
[1:19:15] the dividing line between the temporary
[1:19:17] and permanent anointing
[1:19:19] you can understand the difference
[1:19:20] between the holy ghost's temporary
[1:19:22] anointing on the human spirit versus the
[1:19:25] permanent anointing upon the soul by
[1:19:27] using three scriptures
[1:19:29] john 7 39 acts 1 verse 5 and acts 2
[1:19:33] verse 4.
[1:19:34] these scriptures create a dividing line
[1:19:36] at the day of pentecost
[1:19:38] with full bible authority acts 2 verse 4
[1:19:41] is the first time believers all but
[1:19:43] jesus
[1:19:44] received the permanent anointing of the
[1:19:46] holy ghost in their souls
[1:19:48] every other time the bible speaks of the
[1:19:50] anointing or feeling of the holy ghost
[1:19:52] previous to the day of pentecost
[1:19:55] it is referring to the temporary
[1:19:56] anointing of the human spirit not the
[1:19:59] soul
[1:19:59] this means every old testament scripture
[1:20:02] that refers to the holy ghost anointing
[1:20:04] men and women was a temporary anointing
[1:20:06] upon their human spirits and not their
[1:20:08] souls
[1:20:10] additionally it means anyone anointed by
[1:20:12] the holy ghost in the four gospels
[1:20:15] excluding jesus christ at his water
[1:20:16] baptism only received a temporary
[1:20:19] anointing
[1:20:21] examining john 7 39 the baptism of the
[1:20:25] holy ghost in the soul could only be
[1:20:27] given after jesus was glorified
[1:20:30] but this spake he of the spirit which
[1:20:32] they that believe on him should receive
[1:20:34] for the holy ghost was not yet given
[1:20:36] because that jesus was not yet glorified
[1:20:39] when was jesus glorified christ was
[1:20:41] glorified or received a new glorified
[1:20:43] body at the moment of his resurrection
[1:20:46] john 12 verses 23 and 24 records jesus
[1:20:50] saying his death meant the hour of his
[1:20:52] glorification was near saying the hours
[1:20:55] come that the son of man should be
[1:20:56] glorified verily verily i say unto you
[1:20:59] except a corn of wheat fall into the
[1:21:01] ground and die it abideth alone but if
[1:21:04] it die it bringeth forth much fruit
[1:21:06] two more scriptures john 2 verse 22 and
[1:21:09] john 12 16 place jesus glorification
[1:21:13] after his resurrection because christ's
[1:21:15] disciples only gain understanding of his
[1:21:18] prophecies after jesus rose from the
[1:21:20] dead
[1:21:21] john 12 16 reads these things understood
[1:21:24] not his disciples at the first but when
[1:21:27] jesus was glorified then remembered they
[1:21:30] that these things were written of him
[1:21:32] and that they had done these things unto
[1:21:34] him
[1:21:35] shortly after the day of pentecost peter
[1:21:37] performed a miracle in christ's name and
[1:21:39] said god had already glorified his son
[1:21:41] jesus
[1:21:42] the god of abraham and of isaac and of
[1:21:44] jacob the god of our fathers hath
[1:21:46] glorified his son jesus
[1:21:49] acts 1 verse 5 records jesus's red
[1:21:52] letter words of promise to baptize his
[1:21:54] believers with the holy ghost ten days
[1:21:57] before it happened
[1:21:58] for john truly baptized with water but
[1:22:01] ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost
[1:22:03] not many days hence
[1:22:05] this was the soul baptism both christ
[1:22:07] and john the baptist foretold
[1:22:09] luke 3 verse 16 records john
[1:22:12] differentiating his water baptism from
[1:22:14] the soul baptism that christ would
[1:22:16] unleash at pentecost john answered
[1:22:19] saying unto them all i indeed baptize
[1:22:21] you with water but one mightier than i
[1:22:24] cometh the latchet of whose shoes i am
[1:22:26] not worthy to unloose
[1:22:28] he shall baptize you with the holy ghost
[1:22:30] and with fire
[1:22:34] old testament examples of the temporary
[1:22:36] anointing
[1:22:38] now that you've learned the human spirit
[1:22:40] the second part of your being is only
[1:22:42] anointed temporarily by the holy ghost
[1:22:44] you can understand old testament bible
[1:22:46] examples referring to believers being
[1:22:48] filled with the holy ghost
[1:22:50] you know these temporary fillings only
[1:22:53] anointed their minds not their souls
[1:22:55] because jesus was not yet glorified
[1:22:59] pharaoh recognized god's spirit in
[1:23:01] joseph in genesis 41 verse 38 saying can
[1:23:05] we find such a one as this is a man in
[1:23:08] whom the spirit of god is
[1:23:11] in exodus 28 verse 3 wise-hearted jews
[1:23:14] were filled with the spirit of wisdom in
[1:23:16] order to make aaron's priestly garments
[1:23:19] bezalil was filled with the spirit of
[1:23:21] god in all manner of workmanship to help
[1:23:23] build the tabernacle of moses
[1:23:25] but it was his human spirit that was
[1:23:27] filled with god's spirit not yet his
[1:23:29] soul because hebrews 10 verse 4 says it
[1:23:32] was impossible for the blood of bulls
[1:23:34] and goats which sacrifices he was living
[1:23:36] under to take away his sins
[1:23:39] numbers 14 verse 24 says caleb had
[1:23:42] another spirit with him which caused him
[1:23:44] to follow god fully in the days of
[1:23:46] joshua in numbers 27 verse 18 joshua had
[1:23:50] god's spirit for the lord told moses
[1:23:53] take thee joshua the son of nun a man in
[1:23:56] whom is the spirit and lay thine hand
[1:23:58] upon him
[1:23:59] micah knew his mind was filled with
[1:24:01] god's spirit saying but truly i am full
[1:24:03] of power by the spirit of the lord and
[1:24:05] of judgment and of might to declare unto
[1:24:08] jacob his transgression and to israel
[1:24:10] his sin
[1:24:12] all prophets had god's spirit
[1:24:14] temporarily anointing them
[1:24:16] numbers 11 verses 25-29 shows how god
[1:24:20] put a portion of his spirit that was
[1:24:22] already upon moses on seventy elders
[1:24:25] causing them to prophesy without ceasing
[1:24:29] closely examining three old testament
[1:24:31] individuals helps further prove the
[1:24:33] spirit's anointing was temporary
[1:24:35] samson saul and david
[1:24:38] sampson is known both for his
[1:24:40] supernatural strength via the holy ghost
[1:24:43] but also for his immorality judges 13 25
[1:24:47] and judges 14 verse 6
[1:24:49] record the spirit mightily moving upon
[1:24:51] him but later his disobedience and
[1:24:54] sensuality caused the lord to depart
[1:24:56] from him surely god's spirit was
[1:24:58] anointing samson to fulfill his life's
[1:25:01] purpose of delivering israel from the
[1:25:03] philistines but it wasn't the lord's
[1:25:05] anointing causing him to commit
[1:25:07] fornication with a prostitute
[1:25:09] the new testament believer is empowered
[1:25:11] by the baptism of the holy ghost in his
[1:25:13] soul to abstain from fornication since
[1:25:16] fornicators will not inherit the kingdom
[1:25:18] of god
[1:25:19] but this soul anointing wasn't available
[1:25:21] in samson's lifetime
[1:25:24] at the beginning of his reign saul was
[1:25:26] anointed king of israel and the spirit
[1:25:28] of god came upon him in 1st samuel 10
[1:25:31] verses 1-10
[1:25:32] through his rebellion against god an
[1:25:34] evil spirit came upon saul but departed
[1:25:37] as david played his harp after david
[1:25:40] slew goliath in 1st samuel 18 verses 6
[1:25:43] through 12 the evil spirit returned to
[1:25:46] saul because he was jealous when dancing
[1:25:48] israeli women proclaimed david the
[1:25:50] better warrior
[1:25:52] the evil spirit would come and go saul
[1:25:54] even unsuccessfully attempted to murder
[1:25:56] david twice in 1st samuel 19 verses 8
[1:26:00] through 18.
[1:26:01] next saul and his servants went to rhema
[1:26:04] to dispose of david but instead all
[1:26:06] prophesied as the spirit of god came
[1:26:08] upon them
[1:26:10] saul spent many of his remaining years
[1:26:12] on earth harboring a murderous spirit as
[1:26:14] he hunted down david
[1:26:16] god grew weary of saul's disobedience
[1:26:19] ultimately taking away both his mercy
[1:26:21] from saul and the kingdom of israel
[1:26:24] saul experienced only the temporary
[1:26:26] anointing of god's spirit upon his human
[1:26:28] spirit
[1:26:29] new testament believers with the
[1:26:31] permanent seal of god's spirit in their
[1:26:33] souls will not harbor murderous spirits
[1:26:35] because jesus says behold the kingdom of
[1:26:38] god is within their souls
[1:26:40] murderers will not inherit the kingdom
[1:26:42] of god
[1:26:43] first john 3 verse 15 teaches no murder
[1:26:46] has eternal life
[1:26:47] every born-again christian though
[1:26:49] already possesses eternal life
[1:26:52] david's life may serve as the most
[1:26:54] profound example of the holy spirit's
[1:26:56] temporary anointing upon the human
[1:26:59] spirit because his victories and
[1:27:01] failures were so great
[1:27:03] even before his epic victory against the
[1:27:05] giant goliath god's anointing came upon
[1:27:08] david as samuel poured a horn of natural
[1:27:10] oil on his head and pronounced him the
[1:27:12] next king
[1:27:14] along with being the universal symbol
[1:27:15] for a giant killer david is also well
[1:27:18] known for having a heart that chased
[1:27:20] after god's heart
[1:27:21] david loved god's anointing and you read
[1:27:23] of his love for god and his law
[1:27:25] in scores of worship songs in the book
[1:27:28] of psalm many of his psalms prophesied
[1:27:30] of jesus christ including psalm 16 22
[1:27:34] and 110.
[1:27:35] indeed over one thousand years before
[1:27:38] jesus crucifixion the holy spirit took
[1:27:41] david so deep into revelation that he
[1:27:43] foretold messiah's suffering and some of
[1:27:45] his very words from the cross by writing
[1:27:48] my god my god why is thou forsaken me
[1:27:51] all my bones they look and stare upon me
[1:27:54] they part my garments among them and
[1:27:55] cast lots upon my vesture
[1:27:58] david humbly and accurately said in
[1:28:00] second samuel 32 verse 2
[1:28:03] the spirit of the lord spake by me and
[1:28:05] his word was in my tongue
[1:28:07] 2 peter 1 21 rightly describes david's
[1:28:10] experiences saying
[1:28:11] holy men of god spake as they were moved
[1:28:14] by the holy ghost
[1:28:16] on the other side of the spectrum david
[1:28:18] experienced the pain agony and shame of
[1:28:21] rejecting the anointing in his human
[1:28:23] spirit when he harbored and acted upon
[1:28:25] lustful thoughts about another man's
[1:28:27] wife bathsheba
[1:28:30] first kings 15 verse 5 says this
[1:28:32] situation was david's one time he
[1:28:34] purposely turned aside from god's
[1:28:36] command because david did that which was
[1:28:38] right in the eyes of the lord and turn
[1:28:41] not aside from anything that he
[1:28:42] commanded him all the days of his life
[1:28:45] save only in the matter of uriah the
[1:28:47] hittite
[1:28:49] without the permanent seal of the holy
[1:28:50] ghost in his soul david radically turned
[1:28:53] aside from the anointing of god's spirit
[1:28:55] and committed horrendous evils
[1:28:59] told in second samuel chapters 11 and 12
[1:29:02] david's first mistake was neglecting his
[1:29:04] kingly war duties
[1:29:06] at the time of his downfall he was in
[1:29:08] jerusalem but should have been out with
[1:29:10] israel's army battling the ammonites you
[1:29:13] must learn to never neglect your
[1:29:14] responsibilities as all old testament
[1:29:17] scripture is written for your benefit
[1:29:20] next david stood on his rooftop at night
[1:29:23] and saw bathsheba bathing
[1:29:25] consumed by her beauty he inquired of
[1:29:27] her identity and then sent messengers to
[1:29:29] bring her to him
[1:29:31] consider the time that passed between
[1:29:33] the moment david first saw bathsheba and
[1:29:35] the time he lay with her in which he
[1:29:38] could have repented of his lust
[1:29:40] and chose obedience to god's commands
[1:29:42] he had at least two ways out
[1:29:45] first with god's anointing he could have
[1:29:46] cast out this lustful temptation from
[1:29:48] his mind
[1:29:50] second the king who had at least eight
[1:29:52] wives and ten concubines could have
[1:29:54] easily satisfied his sensual passions
[1:29:57] with one of his legal wives but instead
[1:30:00] took another man's only wife
[1:30:02] david willingly ignored the conviction
[1:30:04] of the holy spirit and scripture says he
[1:30:07] despised the commandment of the lord
[1:30:09] that forbid adultery
[1:30:10] david chose to commit adultery with
[1:30:12] bathsheba and after he received word
[1:30:14] from her that she was pregnant he
[1:30:16] repeatedly tried to cover up his sin
[1:30:19] this moved david to place bathsheba's
[1:30:21] husband loyal soldier uriah in the
[1:30:24] middle of a violent battle that led to
[1:30:26] his death
[1:30:27] the prophet nathan put the blame of
[1:30:29] murder upon david saying
[1:30:31] thou has killed uriah the hittite with
[1:30:33] the sword and has taken his wife to be
[1:30:36] thy wife and has slain him with the
[1:30:38] sword of the children of ammon
[1:30:41] in all of this scripture gives no clues
[1:30:43] about bathsheba's motives but david
[1:30:45] admits his blame saying i have sinned
[1:30:47] against the lord
[1:30:50] like all children of god david suffered
[1:30:52] grave consequences for his evil actions
[1:30:55] foretold by the prophet nathan as the
[1:30:57] sword never departed from his house
[1:31:00] he and bathsheba's first child died
[1:31:02] shortly after birth
[1:31:03] david's daughter tamar was raped by her
[1:31:06] half-brother amnon who was then murdered
[1:31:08] by absalon david's son
[1:31:11] soon after that epsilon stole the hearts
[1:31:13] of the people and the kingdom from david
[1:31:16] forcing his father into exile epsilon
[1:31:18] then slept with his father's concubines
[1:31:20] publicly as divine retribution for his
[1:31:23] secret adultery with bathsheba adonijah
[1:31:26] another son of david was executed after
[1:31:29] david's death as a traitor friend god is
[1:31:32] not mocked whatsoever a man sows that
[1:31:35] shall he reap
[1:31:37] psalm 51 is universally acknowledged as
[1:31:40] a divine song of repentance after david
[1:31:42] committed adultery with bathsheba
[1:31:45] in verses 10 through 12 david requests
[1:31:48] god recreating a clean heart within him
[1:31:51] and a renewal of the right spirit
[1:31:53] he pleads for god not to cast him away
[1:31:55] from his holy presence saying
[1:31:57] take not thy holy spirit from me this
[1:32:00] statement shows david knew god's
[1:32:02] anointing upon him was temporary the
[1:32:05] king then asked for a restoration of joy
[1:32:07] and god's upholding power for his human
[1:32:10] spirit
[1:32:12] herein lays the truth that under the old
[1:32:14] testament david could kill a giant
[1:32:16] goliath
[1:32:17] outside his body but not the giant of
[1:32:20] lust within his body because he lacked
[1:32:22] the inward power of the baptism of the
[1:32:24] holy ghost new testament teaching states
[1:32:27] adulterers cannot inherit the kingdom of
[1:32:29] god this is because power is now
[1:32:31] available to overcome adultery and every
[1:32:34] other sin
[1:32:35] in short a new testament believer who is
[1:32:37] truly baptized with the holy ghost will
[1:32:39] not commit adultery
[1:32:41] he may commit adultery before being born
[1:32:43] again but not after
[1:32:45] spirit-filled christians are sealed or
[1:32:48] marked as god's eternal property and are
[1:32:50] guarded by the power of god from
[1:32:52] committing adultery and other grave sins
[1:32:55] first peter 1 verse 5 says we are kept
[1:32:58] or guarded by the power of god through
[1:33:01] faith
[1:33:03] preachers and lay members alike may
[1:33:05] erroneously use david's failures to
[1:33:08] justify their own lusts claiming they
[1:33:10] too can be men or women after god's
[1:33:13] heart despite adulteries fornications
[1:33:16] and multiple marriages
[1:33:18] but the revelation of the holy ghost
[1:33:20] baptism unveils their folly by showing a
[1:33:23] higher holiness standard for new
[1:33:25] testament saints based upon access to
[1:33:28] greater power
[1:33:29] wolves in sheep's clothing live by the
[1:33:31] motto if god forgave david for his
[1:33:33] sexual sin
[1:33:35] then god will forgive me
[1:33:37] sadly these wolves plan out their sins
[1:33:40] like adulteries despite romans 13 verse
[1:33:43] 14 admonishing us to put ye on the lord
[1:33:46] jesus christ and make not provision for
[1:33:48] the flesh to fulfill the lust thereof
[1:33:52] false preachers devise plan and execute
[1:33:55] their sexual escapades but godly
[1:33:57] preachers depart from all iniquity
[1:34:00] second timothy 2 verse 19 reads
[1:34:02] nevertheless the foundation of god
[1:34:04] standeth sure having this seal the lord
[1:34:07] knoweth them that are his and let
[1:34:09] everyone that nameth the name of christ
[1:34:11] depart from iniquity
[1:34:14] while david was guilty of his failures
[1:34:16] his life proves old testament believers
[1:34:19] lack the permanent indwelling of god's
[1:34:21] presence because god was hiding it until
[1:34:24] pentecost
[1:34:25] if david had been born again the holy
[1:34:27] ghost seal inside of him would have
[1:34:29] caused him to overcome adultery with
[1:34:31] bathsheba and refrain from uriah's
[1:34:34] murder rather than despising god's
[1:34:36] commands
[1:34:37] god's soul seal offers christians power
[1:34:40] to cause them to obey god according to
[1:34:43] ezekiel 36 verse 27
[1:34:48] new testament examples of the temporary
[1:34:50] anointing
[1:34:52] john the baptist and his parents
[1:34:53] zacharias and elizabeth are three new
[1:34:56] testament examples of the temporary
[1:34:58] anointing of god's spirit
[1:35:00] technically the new testament did not
[1:35:02] begin until after jesus death and
[1:35:04] resurrection
[1:35:05] hebrews 9 verses 16 and 17 validates
[1:35:09] this saying
[1:35:10] for where a testament is there must also
[1:35:12] of necessity be the death of the
[1:35:14] testator
[1:35:15] for a testament is a force after men are
[1:35:18] dead otherwise it is of no strength at
[1:35:20] all while the testator liveth
[1:35:23] these three individuals are classified
[1:35:25] as new testament examples because their
[1:35:27] temporary anointing is recorded in
[1:35:29] luke's gospel which is considered part
[1:35:31] of the traditional new testament canon
[1:35:35] luke chapter 1 records john and his
[1:35:37] parents being filled with the holy ghost
[1:35:39] luke 1 verse 15 says for he john shall
[1:35:43] be great in the sight of the lord and
[1:35:45] shall drink neither wine nor strong
[1:35:46] drink and he should be filled with the
[1:35:48] holy ghost even from his mother's womb
[1:35:51] speaking of elizabeth luke 1 verse 41
[1:35:54] says and it came to pass that when
[1:35:56] elizabeth heard the salutation of mary
[1:35:59] the babe leaped in her womb and
[1:36:01] elizabeth was filled with the holy ghost
[1:36:04] luke 1 verse 67 mentioned zechariah
[1:36:06] saying and his father zacharias was
[1:36:08] filled with the holy ghost
[1:36:10] and prophesied
[1:36:13] weigh these three experiences with
[1:36:15] jesus's words in john 7 39
[1:36:18] but this spake he of the spirit which
[1:36:20] they that believe on him should receive
[1:36:22] for the holy ghost was not yet given
[1:36:24] because that jesus was not yet glorified
[1:36:27] based upon the messiah's declaration
[1:36:29] john and his parents were temporarily
[1:36:31] filled with the holy ghost in their
[1:36:33] human spirits and not their souls
[1:36:36] additional proof is found in john's
[1:36:38] doubt of christ as messiah
[1:36:40] matthew 11 verses 2 and 3 reads now when
[1:36:43] john had heard in the prison the works
[1:36:45] of christ he sent two of his disciples
[1:36:48] and said unto him art thou he that
[1:36:50] should come or do we look for another
[1:36:53] the pressure stress and agony of prison
[1:36:55] life had caused john to doubt his
[1:36:57] earlier experience of seeing the holy
[1:37:00] ghost descend and remain upon christ at
[1:37:02] his baptism that he performed
[1:37:05] john could doubt his supernatural
[1:37:07] experience because his soul was not
[1:37:08] sealed
[1:37:09] indeed john lacked the greater power in
[1:37:12] his soul to be an unwavering witness
[1:37:14] that only the holy ghost baptism could
[1:37:16] provide
[1:37:18] acts 1 verse 8 identifies this power
[1:37:20] saying but ye shall receive power after
[1:37:23] that the holy ghost has come upon you
[1:37:25] and ye shall be witnesses unto me both
[1:37:27] in jerusalem and in judea and in samaria
[1:37:31] and unto the uttermost part of the earth
[1:37:35] three other new testament passages teach
[1:37:37] of the temporary anointing of god's
[1:37:38] spirit upon the human spirit
[1:37:41] matthew 7 verses 21-23
[1:37:44] shows that many persons who had god's
[1:37:45] anointing temporarily will be lost and
[1:37:48] sent to hell because they chose to work
[1:37:50] iniquity rather than righteousness
[1:37:53] see chapter 8's parables called the
[1:37:55] wheat and the tares and the net cast
[1:37:57] into the sea for a full study on this
[1:37:59] passage
[1:38:00] hebrews 6 verses 4 through 8 describes
[1:38:03] wicked people who temporarily enjoy the
[1:38:05] blessings of the holy spirit the hebrews
[1:38:08] author clearly states these reprobates
[1:38:10] can be enlightened of the spirit taste
[1:38:12] of heavenly gifts partake of the holy
[1:38:14] ghost but still fall away from living a
[1:38:17] true christian life
[1:38:18] lastly hebrews 10 verses 26 through 29
[1:38:22] speaks of those who sin willfully after
[1:38:24] receiving the knowledge of the truth
[1:38:26] god's judgment and fiery indignation is
[1:38:29] against those who serve god with his
[1:38:31] anointing long enough to be sanctified
[1:38:34] but then trodden underfoot the son of
[1:38:36] god and live despite the spirit of grace
[1:38:41] the soul receives the permanent
[1:38:43] anointing of the holy ghost
[1:38:45] using the process of elimination among
[1:38:47] the three parts of man's being
[1:38:50] body human spirit and soul
[1:38:52] the soul is the only realm of man left
[1:38:54] that can logically receive the baptism
[1:38:56] of the holy ghost the body and human
[1:38:59] spirit have already been ruled out as
[1:39:01] god's permanent abode but does scripture
[1:39:03] give enough support for the soul as
[1:39:05] god's permanent dwelling place within
[1:39:07] man
[1:39:08] the answer is a resounding yes
[1:39:12] contrast david's old testament
[1:39:13] description of god's temporary anointing
[1:39:16] with new testament descriptions of the
[1:39:18] permanent anointing
[1:39:20] psalm 51 verse 11 says take not thy holy
[1:39:23] spirit from me
[1:39:25] implying david knew the feeling of god's
[1:39:27] anointing leaving him but paul's words
[1:39:29] in ephesians 4 30 say the seal of the
[1:39:32] holy ghost cannot be taken away and last
[1:39:35] unto the day of redemption or until you
[1:39:38] die or your body is changed at the
[1:39:40] pre-tribulation rapture
[1:39:43] now insert jesus's promises for his
[1:39:46] spirit to indwell and never leave
[1:39:48] believers
[1:39:49] john 14 16 records messiah saying and i
[1:39:52] will pray the father and he shall give
[1:39:54] you another comforter that he may abide
[1:39:57] with you forever
[1:39:59] jesus promised believers would know he
[1:40:00] was living in them and that he had made
[1:40:03] his abode with them in john 14 20 and
[1:40:06] verse 23
[1:40:08] christ's parting words to his disciples
[1:40:10] in matthew 28 20 were lo i am with you
[1:40:14] alway even unto the end of the world he
[1:40:17] would be with them by dwelling inside
[1:40:18] their souls
[1:40:20] twice in john 17 jesus says he'll
[1:40:22] achieve oneness with his disciples by
[1:40:24] his spirit living inside them
[1:40:26] john 17 verse 23 says i in them and thou
[1:40:30] and me that they may be made perfect in
[1:40:33] one
[1:40:34] john 17 26 reads and i have declared
[1:40:37] unto them thy name and will declare it
[1:40:39] that the love wherewith thou hast love
[1:40:41] me may be in them and i in them
[1:40:45] god permanently dwelling in believers
[1:40:47] souls is a major part of god's better
[1:40:50] covenant as he declares i will dwell in
[1:40:53] them and walk in them and i will be
[1:40:55] their god and they shall be my people
[1:40:58] new testament saints permanently born
[1:41:00] again in their souls have the benefit of
[1:41:02] greater obedience constancy and
[1:41:05] stability compared to old testament
[1:41:07] saints because the human will is fully
[1:41:10] surrendered to god's will
[1:41:11] remember david's fall into the shameful
[1:41:13] public adultery with bathsheba
[1:41:16] he lacked the power and stability of the
[1:41:18] baptism of the holy ghost in his hour of
[1:41:20] temptation
[1:41:21] likewise before pentecost peter fell in
[1:41:24] a shameful public denial of christ while
[1:41:26] speaking with a lowly maid
[1:41:28] the difference for peter was pentecost
[1:41:30] which was unavailable to david before
[1:41:33] the upper room peter even cowardly ran
[1:41:35] for his life at the threat of arrest but
[1:41:37] afterwards he was boldly crucified
[1:41:39] upside down as a martyr for christ in 64
[1:41:42] a.d
[1:41:43] once filled with the holy ghost in his
[1:41:45] soul peter could not deny his lord and
[1:41:47] savior
[1:41:50] what is the soul
[1:41:52] the soul is defined as the nature will
[1:41:55] or desire of the human spirit the soul
[1:41:57] is closely connected to the human spirit
[1:42:13] soul thirsts for god the living god
[1:42:16] this was by god's perfect design because
[1:42:18] he wants fellowship with his creation
[1:42:21] just as the body has an innate natural
[1:42:23] thirst for water so the soul has an
[1:42:25] innate spiritual thirst for god's
[1:42:27] acceptance and fellowship
[1:42:30] if the body is denied water it dies
[1:42:32] the soul dies or is eternally separated
[1:42:35] from god if it denies itself fellowship
[1:42:37] with god's spirit isaiah 26
[1:42:40] verses 7 through 9 beautifully describes
[1:42:43] the soul's thirst or desire for god
[1:42:46] the way of the just is uprightness thou
[1:42:48] most upright dust weight the path of the
[1:42:51] just yea in the way of thy judgments o
[1:42:54] lord have we waited for thee the desire
[1:42:56] of our soul is to thy name and to the
[1:42:59] remembrance of thee with my soul have i
[1:43:01] desired thee in the night yea with my
[1:43:03] spirit within me will i seek thee early
[1:43:06] for when thy judgments are on the earth
[1:43:08] the inhabitants of the world will learn
[1:43:10] righteousness
[1:43:12] the lord built this holy thirst into
[1:43:14] each person's soul so all are without
[1:43:17] excuse on the day of judgment
[1:43:19] romans 1 verses 18 through 21 teaches
[1:43:23] god manifests himself to all men through
[1:43:25] the amazing design of their human bodies
[1:43:28] and the indescribable majesty of the
[1:43:30] heavens earth and universe
[1:43:32] these three elements holy thirst design
[1:43:35] of the human body and majestic universe
[1:43:39] form an undeniable group of witnesses to
[1:43:41] god's unfathomable love for his creation
[1:43:45] paul speaks truth when he says but god
[1:43:48] who is rich in mercy for his great love
[1:43:50] wherewith he loved us
[1:43:52] no man will be able to say god did not
[1:43:54] love him because christ has provided
[1:43:56] witnesses both within
[1:43:58] holy thirst design of the human body
[1:44:01] and without man
[1:44:02] creation
[1:44:04] the holy thirst in every soul produces a
[1:44:07] longing to worship
[1:44:08] every person in every culture longs to
[1:44:10] worship a higher being
[1:44:12] no matter how advanced or primitive
[1:44:14] wealthy or poor urban or rural
[1:44:17] mankind longs to worship it and does
[1:44:19] worship someone or something
[1:44:22] most often men try to satisfy this
[1:44:24] thirst with false religion because it
[1:44:27] pleases their selfish fleshly and sinful
[1:44:30] desires but god searches the earth until
[1:44:32] he identifies small groups of honest
[1:44:35] worshipers who will not stop searching
[1:44:37] until they find his true spiritual water
[1:44:40] that alone quenches the spiritual thirst
[1:44:43] inside them
[1:44:45] peter preached this truth in acts 10
[1:44:47] verses 34 and 35 saying of a truth i
[1:44:50] perceive that god is no respecter of
[1:44:52] persons but in every nation he that
[1:44:54] feareth him and worketh righteousness is
[1:44:57] accepted with him
[1:44:59] jesus says the father is seeking true
[1:45:01] worshipers zechariah chapter 4 verse 10
[1:45:04] agrees saying god's eyes run to and fro
[1:45:07] through the whole earth
[1:45:08] second chronicles chapter 16 verse 9
[1:45:11] also describes god's eyes searching the
[1:45:14] whole earth in order to show himself
[1:45:16] strong in the behalf of them whose heart
[1:45:19] is perfect toward him
[1:45:21] rest assured the loving heavenly father
[1:45:23] will search out and find every soul
[1:45:26] longing for fellowship with him
[1:45:29] free moral agency or the power of
[1:45:32] autonomous choice originates within
[1:45:34] man's soul as a gift from god
[1:45:37] life on earth is a gift but salvation
[1:45:40] unto eternal life is an even greater
[1:45:42] gift and is yours to gain or lose to
[1:45:45] accept salvation is to keep your soul
[1:45:48] to reject it is to lose your soul as
[1:45:50] jesus teaches in mark 8 36 for what
[1:45:54] shall a prophet a man if he shall gain
[1:45:56] the whole world and lose his own soul
[1:45:59] the lord does not force any soul to
[1:46:01] follow him or repent from his sins but
[1:46:04] graciously offers mercy and warnings to
[1:46:07] all persons
[1:46:09] the soul nature ultimately directs a
[1:46:12] person's destiny to heaven or hell
[1:46:15] your soul directs your way whether it's
[1:46:17] the correct or erroneous way
[1:46:20] james 5 verse 20 reads
[1:46:22] let him know that he which converteth
[1:46:24] the sinner from the heir of his way
[1:46:27] shall save a soul from death and shall
[1:46:29] hide a multitude of sins
[1:46:32] god mercifully gives each person the way
[1:46:34] or desire of their heart psalm 37 verse
[1:46:38] 4 says god gives the righteous the
[1:46:40] desires of their hearts
[1:46:42] romans 1 verse 28 implies he gives
[1:46:45] sinners their evil desire saying
[1:46:47] and even as they did not like to retain
[1:46:49] god in their knowledge god gave them
[1:46:52] over to a reprobate mind to do those
[1:46:54] things which are not convenient
[1:46:57] those who want to be saved will be and
[1:46:59] those who desire a life and eternity
[1:47:01] without god will receive the same
[1:47:05] through the soul's free moral agency
[1:47:07] every person either chooses faith or
[1:47:09] unbelief
[1:47:10] if faith is chosen god directs the
[1:47:13] believer to heaven if faith is rejected
[1:47:16] unbelief is the default state of the
[1:47:18] unbeliever and satan directs him to hell
[1:47:21] unbelief is the absence or rejection of
[1:47:24] faith in god
[1:47:25] continual sin leads to complete unbelief
[1:47:28] to reject faith is the ultimate final
[1:47:31] sin because it determines a person's
[1:47:33] eternal destiny
[1:47:35] ezekiel 18 4 says the soul that sinneth
[1:47:38] it shall die
[1:47:40] sinning means missing the mark or
[1:47:42] wandering from the way in hebrew
[1:47:44] therefore it is a man's soul via free
[1:47:47] moral agency that chooses every action
[1:47:50] the soul either does good faith or evil
[1:47:54] unbelief
[1:47:55] romans 2 verses 9 and 10 confirm this
[1:47:59] saying tribulation and anguish upon
[1:48:02] every soul of man that doeth evil of the
[1:48:04] jew first and also of the gentile but
[1:48:07] glory honor and peace to every man that
[1:48:10] worketh good to the jew first and also
[1:48:13] to the gentile
[1:48:16] every soul worships someone or something
[1:48:18] the souls of faith rejecters choose to
[1:48:21] disbelieve god but their soul still
[1:48:23] worships satan according to their own
[1:48:25] wills
[1:48:26] appropriately paul calls all false
[1:48:29] worship will worship in colossians 2
[1:48:31] verse 23 after condemning the worship of
[1:48:34] angels and legalistic teachings in
[1:48:37] verses 16 through 22
[1:48:39] will worship or worshiping in self-will
[1:48:42] is the default mode of soul worship for
[1:48:45] all who reject god's requirements for
[1:48:47] true worship
[1:48:48] jesus teaches true worshipers must
[1:48:51] not should
[1:48:52] worship in spirit and in truth in john 4
[1:48:55] verse 24
[1:48:57] god is a spirit and they that worship
[1:48:59] him must worship him in spirit and in
[1:49:01] truth
[1:49:02] cain is the first human will worship
[1:49:04] example in genesis 4 verses 1 through 7.
[1:49:08] instead of being happy that god had
[1:49:10] accepted his brother abel's offering and
[1:49:12] following his example to please god cain
[1:49:15] became very wroth against god
[1:49:18] the merciful god offered cain another
[1:49:20] chance at true worship through obedience
[1:49:22] and the opportunity to be the spiritual
[1:49:24] head of his brother but he flatly
[1:49:26] refused god's counsel
[1:49:28] cain then murdered abel and lied about
[1:49:30] it to god worshiping like cain and
[1:49:33] self-will according to your own
[1:49:35] requirements is a soul damning decision
[1:49:38] this is why cain is called the son of
[1:49:40] satan in 1st john 3 verses 11 and 12.
[1:49:44] for this is the message that ye have
[1:49:45] heard from the beginning that we should
[1:49:47] love one another not his cain who was of
[1:49:49] that wicked one and slew his brother and
[1:49:52] wherefore slew he him because his own
[1:49:54] works were evil and his brothers
[1:49:56] righteous
[1:49:58] cain rejected the simple way to
[1:50:00] salvation john 14 verse 6 says jesus is
[1:50:04] god's one way to salvation i am the way
[1:50:06] the truth and the life
[1:50:08] and isaiah 35 8 says this way is so
[1:50:11] simple a fool will not err therein and a
[1:50:14] highway shall be there and a way and it
[1:50:17] shall be called the way of holiness the
[1:50:19] unclean shall not pass over it but it
[1:50:22] shall be for those the wayfaring men
[1:50:24] though fools shall not air therein
[1:50:30] imagery and foreshadowing of the soul
[1:50:32] receiving the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:50:35] scripture uses at least eight images
[1:50:38] with corresponding old testament
[1:50:40] foreshadowings to help us understand how
[1:50:42] the soul or human nature is born again
[1:50:45] all eight representations are fulfilled
[1:50:48] simultaneously at the moment a christian
[1:50:50] is born again
[1:50:53] the soul needs filled with god's nature
[1:50:56] more than 10 times the new testament
[1:50:58] mentions believers being filled with the
[1:51:00] holy ghost
[1:51:01] which suggests man's soul or will
[1:51:04] begins empty of the divine nature
[1:51:07] without the full anointing of god's
[1:51:09] spirit the human soul only has a finite
[1:51:12] human nature which ultimately leads
[1:51:14] itself to destruction
[1:51:16] ephesians 2 verse 3 says we were by
[1:51:19] nature the children of wrath before our
[1:51:21] conversions to christianity but
[1:51:23] beginning in acts 2 verse 4 believers
[1:51:26] were filled with the divine nature or
[1:51:28] divine will of god and were
[1:51:30] appropriately described as having one
[1:51:32] soul
[1:51:33] the fourth verse of 2nd peter chapter 1
[1:51:36] states this truth plainly saying
[1:51:38] christians are now partakers of the
[1:51:40] divine nature
[1:51:42] paul likens believers unto vessels that
[1:51:44] must be filled with the spirit having
[1:51:46] previously been sanctified ready for the
[1:51:49] master's use
[1:51:50] similarly jesus likens believers unto
[1:51:53] houses that must be cleaned out of
[1:51:55] devils in matthew 12 verses 29 and
[1:51:58] verses 43 through 45. the obvious
[1:52:02] implication is that our houses our
[1:52:03] bodies must be filled with the holy
[1:52:05] ghost
[1:52:07] elisha's miracle of filling the widow
[1:52:10] woman's borrowed pots with oil in 2nd
[1:52:12] kings 4 verses 1 through 7 foreshadows
[1:52:15] the filling of the holy ghost
[1:52:17] in the new testament god will fill every
[1:52:20] empty vessel or soul who comes to him to
[1:52:23] be filled and he'll only stop when no
[1:52:25] more gentiles seek his spirit
[1:52:29] the soul needs sealed or marked as god's
[1:52:32] eternal property
[1:52:34] seven new testament scriptures call the
[1:52:36] baptism of the holy ghost a seal and in
[1:52:39] the greek it means both a mark
[1:52:41] and a sealing up both definitions
[1:52:44] accurately depict what happens at the
[1:52:46] new birth
[1:52:48] god's abiding spirit becomes a permanent
[1:52:51] property mark or stamp on the believer's
[1:52:53] soul keeping it from being marked or
[1:52:56] claimed by satan god puts his spiritual
[1:52:58] mark upon his children as a token
[1:53:01] they've received his new testament
[1:53:03] covenant
[1:53:05] it's also a seal to close up the soul
[1:53:07] like an envelope until it reaches its
[1:53:09] heavenly home after death god's will is
[1:53:12] sealed in to the soul while satan's will
[1:53:16] is sealed out
[1:53:17] beginning with cain sinners have been
[1:53:19] taking satan's mark on their souls
[1:53:22] romans 1 verses 18-32
[1:53:25] and 2 thessalonians 2 verses 9-14
[1:53:29] detail how satan's mark comes as the
[1:53:32] point of no return
[1:53:34] when sinners reject god's truth for the
[1:53:36] last time
[1:53:37] in return god gives them over to their
[1:53:39] reprobate minds letting them believe
[1:53:42] lies unto their own destruction because
[1:53:44] they love not the truth
[1:53:47] ephesians 4 30 says god seals his divine
[1:53:50] nature into the christian unto the day
[1:53:53] of redemption
[1:53:54] this eternal seal lasts longer than the
[1:53:57] time from one annual church revival
[1:53:59] event to the next
[1:54:01] it lasts forever without end because god
[1:54:04] seal is his holy spirit which is the one
[1:54:07] and only eternal spirit
[1:54:10] as you'll soon see in first john 3 verse
[1:54:12] 9
[1:54:13] unbelief is sealed out of the soul and
[1:54:15] faith is sealed in
[1:54:18] ezekiel chapter 9 verses 1 through 7
[1:54:21] foreshadows the marking of the holy
[1:54:23] spirit comparing it to a scribe marking
[1:54:26] faithful believers who sighed and cried
[1:54:28] against abominations
[1:54:30] kings sealed off their gardens and
[1:54:32] fountains in bible times
[1:54:35] solomon likens his wife to a sealed
[1:54:37] garden and fountain in song of solomon 4
[1:54:40] verse 12.
[1:54:42] a garden enclosed is my sister my spouse
[1:54:45] a spring shut up a fountain sealed
[1:54:48] this foreshadows jesus sealing off his
[1:54:51] spouse the bride the new testament
[1:54:53] church
[1:54:54] with the sole seal of the holy ghost
[1:54:58] the soul needs clothed in divine power
[1:55:02] in luke 24 49 jesus says the holy ghost
[1:55:05] baptism is a garment of power for the
[1:55:08] spirit is power
[1:55:10] luke 4 verse 14 says and jesus returned
[1:55:13] in the power of the spirit into galilee
[1:55:16] man sinful soul is naked or lacking
[1:55:19] divine power
[1:55:20] in colossians 3 verses 7 through 10 paul
[1:55:23] calls this sinful powerless soul the old
[1:55:26] man and says his works are anger wrath
[1:55:30] malice blasphemy among other sins
[1:55:34] the old man must be put off or taken off
[1:55:37] like a garment and the new man must be
[1:55:39] put on
[1:55:41] the holy ghost baptism is power to do
[1:55:43] god's will
[1:55:45] the apostle admonishes believers to put
[1:55:47] ye on the lord jesus christ and make not
[1:55:50] provision for the flesh to fulfill the
[1:55:52] lusts thereof
[1:55:55] additionally sinful souls are
[1:55:57] spiritually naked after death meaning
[1:56:00] they lack a celestial eternal body also
[1:56:03] called a theophany
[1:56:05] paul teaches this in second corinthians
[1:56:07] 5 verses 1-5 saying believers groan to
[1:56:11] be clothed with their celestial or
[1:56:14] heavenly bodies
[1:56:15] souls of sinners are found naked
[1:56:18] void of the clothing of the spirit's
[1:56:20] power
[1:56:22] elisha receiving elijah's mantle
[1:56:25] or anointing
[1:56:26] in second kings chapter 2 verse 14
[1:56:29] foreshadows the soul clothing of the
[1:56:31] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:56:35] the soul needs its unbelief removed or
[1:56:37] circumcised
[1:56:39] in romans 2 verses 28 28-29 paul claims
[1:56:43] the holy ghost-filled christian is a
[1:56:45] spiritual jew having the circumcision of
[1:56:48] the heart in the spirit
[1:56:50] he again teaches this truth in
[1:56:52] philippians 3 verse 3 and colossians 2
[1:56:55] verse 11 saying we are the circumcision
[1:56:58] which worship god in the spirit
[1:57:00] and have the circumcision of christ
[1:57:03] indeed it is christ who uses his sword
[1:57:06] the word
[1:57:07] to permanently cut off the evil desires
[1:57:10] of the human will
[1:57:11] severing it from the soul never to
[1:57:13] return again
[1:57:16] abraham's circumcision in genesis 17
[1:57:19] verses 1 through 14 was a sign of the
[1:57:21] covenant between he and god
[1:57:23] foreshadowing the soul circumcision of
[1:57:26] the new testament christian
[1:57:29] the soul needs born or brought forth
[1:57:31] from above
[1:57:33] a birth is a bringing forth a start of
[1:57:35] new life
[1:57:36] your first birth from your mother's womb
[1:57:39] is your natural birth
[1:57:41] but christ promised and required
[1:57:43] heavenly birth for your soul saying ye
[1:57:45] must be born again in john 3 verse 7
[1:57:49] in the greek again means from above
[1:57:52] your body birth on earth was your first
[1:57:54] birth
[1:57:55] through your father's corruptable seed
[1:57:58] but your soul's birth from heaven is
[1:58:00] another birth experience through your
[1:58:02] heavenly father's seed first peter 1
[1:58:04] verse 23 plainly states being born again
[1:58:08] not a corruptable seed but of
[1:58:10] incorruptable by the word of god which
[1:58:13] liveth and abideth forever
[1:58:15] your body will die and perish but your
[1:58:17] soul will live eternally because it has
[1:58:20] god's own life or seed
[1:58:23] first john 3 verse 9 boldly proclaims
[1:58:26] your soul cannot sin because its seed
[1:58:29] life is from god
[1:58:31] whosoever is born of god doth not commit
[1:58:33] sin for his seed remaineth in him and he
[1:58:37] cannot sin because he is born of god
[1:58:40] the apostle paul taught his flesh and
[1:58:42] mind sinned but not himself his soul
[1:58:47] romans 7 17 states now then it is no
[1:58:50] more i that do it but sin that dwelleth
[1:58:52] in me
[1:58:54] the born-again soul is a new spiritual
[1:58:57] creature like a natural baby is a new
[1:59:00] creature it's a start of a new life
[1:59:02] eternal life 2 corinthians 5 verse 17
[1:59:06] says therefore if any man be in christ
[1:59:09] he is a new creature old things are
[1:59:11] passed away behold all things are become
[1:59:14] new
[1:59:15] indeed god's foreknowledge knew you
[1:59:17] desire the new birth so he foreordained
[1:59:20] it in his will
[1:59:22] like first time parents plan for and
[1:59:25] eagerly anticipate their first child's
[1:59:27] arrival your heavenly father planned
[1:59:29] your spiritual birth in his will at the
[1:59:32] perfect time in season
[1:59:34] john 1 verses 12 and 13 say
[1:59:37] sons of god are born again not of blood
[1:59:41] nor of the will of the flesh nor of the
[1:59:43] will of man but of god
[1:59:47] seth
[1:59:48] son of adam and eve foreshadows the new
[1:59:50] testament new birth
[1:59:52] eve said seth was another seed or second
[1:59:55] seed from god to replace abel whom cain
[1:59:58] slew
[1:59:59] eve needed a new creature a new son
[2:00:02] christians need another seed a second
[2:00:04] seed an incorruptible seed from above in
[2:00:08] order to be a new creature seth was
[2:00:11] actually the second seed of adam as cain
[2:00:13] was the seed of the serpent according to
[2:00:15] genesis 3 verse 15 and 1st john 3 verse
[2:00:19] 12
[2:00:20] chapter 10 details the serpent seed and
[2:00:22] cain's true father
[2:00:25] the soul needs quickened or made alive
[2:00:27] through god's eternal life
[2:00:30] your human soul has a supernatural life
[2:00:32] but doesn't have eternal life until it's
[2:00:34] born again
[2:00:36] your soul receives a faith seed for
[2:00:38] salvation through preaching but the seed
[2:00:41] needs quickened or made alive according
[2:00:43] to the greek
[2:00:44] in order for a natural seed to grow it
[2:00:47] needs three conditions met
[2:00:49] light water and fertile soil
[2:00:52] the seed cannot be quickened until all
[2:00:54] three conditions are present
[2:00:57] likewise the spiritual seed in your soul
[2:00:59] is quickened when the three following
[2:01:01] conditions are met
[2:01:04] the word seed in a believer's soul needs
[2:01:06] spiritual light soil and water to be
[2:01:09] quickened and these conditions were met
[2:01:11] on the day of pentecost
[2:01:12] spiritual light is the knowledge of
[2:01:14] jesus's work on the cross that paul says
[2:01:17] shine in our hearts
[2:01:19] second corinthians 4 verse 6 reads for
[2:01:22] god who commanded the light to shine out
[2:01:24] of darkness hath shine in our hearts to
[2:01:27] give the light of the knowledge of the
[2:01:28] glory of god in the face of jesus christ
[2:01:32] this spiritual light shine brightly upon
[2:01:34] dark hearts as peter preached to the 17
[2:01:37] nationalities in acts 2 verses 14-36
[2:01:42] the second condition is fertile soil
[2:01:44] which jesus says is an honest and good
[2:01:46] heart in luke 8
[2:01:48] 15. this condition was met at pentecost
[2:01:52] when the new believer's hearts were
[2:01:53] pricked in acts 2 verse 37 leading to
[2:01:56] their repentance and water baptism in
[2:01:59] the name of jesus christ
[2:02:01] spiritual water is a third and final
[2:02:03] condition which represents the holy
[2:02:05] spirit that fell on the day of pentecost
[2:02:08] peter said this divine water was poured
[2:02:10] out upon he and the other 119 believers
[2:02:14] in the upper room in acts 2 verse 17.
[2:02:17] after peter's pentecost sermon the
[2:02:19] spiritual water fell upon the new
[2:02:21] believers shortly after their water
[2:02:23] baptisms because scripture says three
[2:02:26] thousand souls were added to the church
[2:02:28] that very day
[2:02:31] aaron's dead rod that butted overnight
[2:02:34] in the holiest of holies in numbers 17
[2:02:36] verse 8 foreshadows the baptism of the
[2:02:39] holy ghost
[2:02:40] the lifeless rod received resurrection
[2:02:43] power in the third realm of moses's
[2:02:45] tabernacle typing the third work of
[2:02:48] grace
[2:02:49] the outer core and holy place type
[2:02:51] justification and sanctification
[2:02:53] respectively
[2:02:56] the soul needs immersed or baptized in
[2:02:58] god's nature
[2:03:00] the son of god himself depicted the
[2:03:02] born-again experience as a spiritual
[2:03:04] baptism for the soul in acts 1 verse 5
[2:03:08] but ye shall be baptized with the holy
[2:03:10] ghost not many days hence
[2:03:12] the human soul is fully immersed in
[2:03:14] god's nature or will when it's born
[2:03:17] again
[2:03:18] as ezekiel says this divine nature will
[2:03:20] cause you to keep god's commands just
[2:03:23] like water causes a seed to carry out
[2:03:25] its genetic code
[2:03:28] reverting to the seed imagery water is
[2:03:30] one of the three elements a seed needs
[2:03:33] to germinate but the right amount of
[2:03:35] water is essential
[2:03:37] too much water and the seed dies
[2:03:39] waterlogged lacking oxygen too little
[2:03:42] water and the seed coat remains hard and
[2:03:44] doesn't germinate
[2:03:46] but when evenly moist soil surrounds the
[2:03:48] seed this baptism causes life to spring
[2:03:51] forth
[2:03:54] neyman's bodily cleansing after his
[2:03:56] seventh dip or baptism in the river
[2:03:58] jordan in second kings 5 14
[2:04:02] foreshadows our spiritual cleansing
[2:04:04] through the holy ghost baptism
[2:04:08] the soul needs rest from doing its own
[2:04:10] will
[2:04:11] the lord jesus christ specifically
[2:04:13] preached his promise to give rest for
[2:04:16] our souls in matthew 11 verses 28 and 29
[2:04:20] come unto me all ye that labor and are
[2:04:22] heavy laden and i will give you rest
[2:04:25] take my yoke upon you and learn of me
[2:04:28] for i am meek and lowly in heart and ye
[2:04:30] shall find rest unto your souls
[2:04:34] without christ's rest all souls are
[2:04:36] restless working to feel justified with
[2:04:39] god
[2:04:40] the human will labors in vain to try to
[2:04:43] do good deeds but ultimately fails
[2:04:46] all religions outside of christianity
[2:04:48] including all non-religious self-help
[2:04:50] programs are self-serving self-motivated
[2:04:54] and selfish
[2:04:55] they all do man's will rather than gods
[2:04:59] judaism is called the deeds of the law
[2:05:02] in romans 3 verse 20 because all human
[2:05:04] deeds and efforts of sinful fallible
[2:05:07] flesh cannot be justified in god's sight
[2:05:10] it's true the law is holy just and
[2:05:13] spiritual but we are carnal sold under
[2:05:15] sin
[2:05:16] what the human will needs is a rest from
[2:05:18] its carnal will and a full submission
[2:05:21] and obedience to the will of god
[2:05:24] this privilege is provided by the
[2:05:25] baptism of the holy ghost
[2:05:28] another way to express being sold under
[2:05:31] sin is slavery or the spirit of bondage
[2:05:34] the soul is under slavery labor and
[2:05:37] bondage until it's set free by the holy
[2:05:39] ghost baptism appropriately called the
[2:05:42] spirit of adoption in romans 8 15.
[2:05:45] you're officially adopted into god's
[2:05:47] family
[2:05:48] as his child through the new birth
[2:05:51] paul says in galatians 5 verse 4 we
[2:05:53] receive the adoption of sons
[2:05:56] you can rest knowing you're a child of
[2:05:57] god with a family kinship to him and not
[2:06:01] a slave romans 8 verse 23 tells you the
[2:06:04] adoption process is completed when you
[2:06:07] receive your new glorified body
[2:06:10] and not only they but ourselves also
[2:06:12] which have the first fruits of the
[2:06:14] spirit
[2:06:15] even we ourselves groan within ourselves
[2:06:18] waiting for the adoption to it the
[2:06:20] redemption of our body
[2:06:23] hebrews 4 verses 1 through 12
[2:06:25] beautifully explains the new testament
[2:06:28] rest for the soul
[2:06:29] the author gives two examples of resting
[2:06:32] god resting from his creative work on
[2:06:34] the seventh day
[2:06:35] and most of israel failing to enter into
[2:06:38] their rest in the promised land
[2:06:40] before urging christians to labor to
[2:06:42] enter into the new rest for the people
[2:06:45] of god
[2:06:46] this rest must be both the same rest
[2:06:48] christ promised in matthew 11 29 and a
[2:06:52] new rest different from the sabbath day
[2:06:55] moses instituted in exodus chapter 20.
[2:06:58] the new testament rest is ceasing from
[2:07:00] your own works and doing god's works
[2:07:03] hebrews 4 verse 10 validates this for he
[2:07:06] that is entered into his rest he also
[2:07:09] hath ceased from his own works as god
[2:07:11] did from his
[2:07:13] in colossians 1 verse 29 paul states his
[2:07:16] labors are god's spirit laboring through
[2:07:18] him
[2:07:19] whereunto i also labor striving
[2:07:22] according to his working which worketh
[2:07:24] in me mightily
[2:07:27] you must know the new testament sabbath
[2:07:28] is not resting every saturday as
[2:07:31] seventh-day adventists teach
[2:07:33] while you should rest your body while
[2:07:35] worshiping with other believers every
[2:07:36] sunday
[2:07:37] like acts 20 verse 7 and hebrews 10 25
[2:07:41] show the baptism of the holy ghost is
[2:07:44] the soul rest jesus promised not a body
[2:07:47] rest
[2:07:48] old testament saints already had the
[2:07:50] body rest under the fourth commandment
[2:07:52] colossians 2 verses 16 and 17 state
[2:07:56] saturday sabbath days were a shadow of
[2:07:59] things to come
[2:08:00] isaiah boldly prophesied the shadow or
[2:08:03] saturday sabbath would vanish on the day
[2:08:05] of pentecost by saying this is the rest
[2:08:08] in isaiah 28 verses 11 and 12.
[2:08:12] the prophet foretold the real soul rest
[2:08:15] would be stammering lips spoken to god's
[2:08:17] people
[2:08:18] paul says isaiah's prophecy was
[2:08:20] fulfilled on the day of pentecost
[2:08:22] in first corinthians 14 verse 21
[2:08:26] in the born-again experience a christian
[2:08:28] rests or walks according to the spirit
[2:08:30] and does not fulfill the lust of the
[2:08:32] flesh
[2:08:34] for the remainder of his christian walk
[2:08:36] the believer rests or ceases from sinful
[2:08:38] habits and establishes holy habits now
[2:08:41] that's a true rest
[2:08:44] the new testament soul rest gives
[2:08:46] believers the potential but it remains
[2:08:48] impossible due to our sin nature
[2:08:50] to always obey god's word if we only
[2:08:53] wait and listen for god's spirit to
[2:08:55] speak to us in every situation
[2:08:58] this is true because our souls cannot
[2:08:59] sin or disbelieve once baptized with the
[2:09:02] holy ghost reference first john 3 verse
[2:09:05] 9
[2:09:06] whosoever is born of god doth not commit
[2:09:09] sin
[2:09:10] for his seed remaineth in him
[2:09:12] and he cannot sin because he is born of
[2:09:14] god but of course we don't wait and pray
[2:09:17] enough on a daily basis
[2:09:19] we often choose to make decisions based
[2:09:21] upon the feelings of the flesh or human
[2:09:23] spirit rather than the soul
[2:09:25] the greatest lessons in life are
[2:09:27] learning to listen to and rest upon the
[2:09:30] revelations from god's spirit in our
[2:09:33] souls
[2:09:34] listen to god first then act wait upon
[2:09:37] his leading calm yourself to hear the
[2:09:40] still small voice in your soul
[2:09:42] you'll never regret resting from your
[2:09:44] works and doing god's
[2:09:47] truly the rest jesus offers you today is
[2:09:50] a glorious soul rest one in which isaiah
[2:09:53] promised 800 years before emmanuel came
[2:09:57] isaiah 11 verse 10 reads and in that day
[2:10:00] there shall be a root of jesse which
[2:10:02] shall stand for an end sign of the
[2:10:03] people to it shall the gentiles seek and
[2:10:06] his rest shall be glorious
[2:10:09] by the holy ghost baptism we partake in
[2:10:12] the divine glorious rest of god
[2:10:16] ruth's rest while waiting for boaz to
[2:10:18] finish the kinsmen redeemer work
[2:10:21] foreshadows the baptism of the holy
[2:10:22] ghost
[2:10:24] her life fits the three works of grace
[2:10:26] framework
[2:10:27] she was first justified or saved after
[2:10:30] deciding to believe and follow naomi's
[2:10:32] god jehovah
[2:10:34] secondly her sanctification came as she
[2:10:36] served and labored in boaz's field
[2:10:39] gleaning every ear of corn to ensure
[2:10:42] naomi's and her own survival
[2:10:45] ruth 3 verse 18 records naomi's wisdom
[2:10:48] for ruth to rest in boaz's redemption
[2:10:51] work
[2:10:52] then said she sit still my daughter
[2:10:55] until thou know how the matter will fall
[2:10:58] for the man will not be in rest until he
[2:11:00] have finished the thing this day
[2:11:03] christians do the same resting from
[2:11:05] their own works and trusting in the
[2:11:07] finished work of jesus's cross and
[2:11:09] resurrection
[2:11:12] to conclude this imagery section
[2:11:14] scripture offers numerous symbols for
[2:11:16] the holy ghost including but not limited
[2:11:19] to
[2:11:20] oil
[2:11:21] dove
[2:11:22] water
[2:11:23] rain fire
[2:11:25] wind
[2:11:26] standard
[2:11:27] clothes
[2:11:29] quicken seed
[2:11:32] refillings of the holy ghost happen in
[2:11:35] the human spirit
[2:11:37] you may hear preachers or believers say
[2:11:39] they were refilled with the holy ghost
[2:11:41] based upon scripture a refilling of the
[2:11:44] holy ghost can only happen in the human
[2:11:45] spirit and not the soul
[2:11:48] 2 corinthians 4 verse 16
[2:11:50] and ephesians 4 verse 23 teach your
[2:11:53] human spirit can have a fresh refilling
[2:11:55] or renewing
[2:11:57] these scriptures say you're renewed
[2:11:59] daily in the spirit of your mind
[2:12:02] no scripture teaches souls are refilled
[2:12:04] or reborn after the initial filling or
[2:12:07] birth
[2:12:09] ephesians 4 30 says the seal of god
[2:12:11] lasts until your day of redemption
[2:12:14] not for a year or until the next church
[2:12:16] revival meeting
[2:12:17] god seal marks and protects you until
[2:12:19] you die and cross over into the heavenly
[2:12:22] dimension or until your physical body
[2:12:24] gets swallowed up in a glorified body at
[2:12:27] the pre-tribulation rapture
[2:12:30] some may read the context of acts 4 31
[2:12:34] and think souls can be refilled with the
[2:12:36] holy ghost
[2:12:37] but careful examination and scriptural
[2:12:39] comparison leads us to believe
[2:12:41] differently
[2:12:42] peter and john had returned to their
[2:12:44] company or fellow christians after being
[2:12:47] threatened to stop speaking in jesus
[2:12:49] name
[2:12:50] after loud group prayer the holy ghost
[2:12:52] shook the building and they were all
[2:12:54] filled with the holy ghost
[2:12:56] some in the company may have received
[2:12:57] the holy ghost baptism for the first
[2:12:59] time but not all and certainly not peter
[2:13:01] and john acts 1 13 says peter and john
[2:13:05] were among the group that was already
[2:13:07] filled with the holy ghost when the
[2:13:08] spirit fell in acts 2 verse 4. this
[2:13:11] means peter and john got a spirit
[2:13:13] refilling in their human spirits to
[2:13:16] refresh their minds but not another soul
[2:13:18] sealing because their soul baptism in
[2:13:20] acts 2 verse 4 lasted unto the day of
[2:13:23] redemption
[2:13:26] the soul of the old testament believer
[2:13:29] since only new testament believers can
[2:13:31] have their souls filled sealed clothed
[2:13:34] circumcised born quickened baptized and
[2:13:37] at rest what did old testament saints
[2:13:39] have in their souls
[2:13:41] the answer is faith hebrews 11 verse 1
[2:13:44] describes faith as a spiritual substance
[2:13:47] or a small portion of god's spirit
[2:13:51] abraham the father of us all
[2:13:54] can be used as an example to illustrate
[2:13:56] an old testament believers soul change
[2:13:59] from unbelief to faith
[2:14:01] yet according to jesus the holy ghost
[2:14:03] could not be given in full measure to
[2:14:05] abraham
[2:14:07] like all persons abraham was born a
[2:14:10] sinner or unbeliever with an inherent
[2:14:12] sin nature david wrote behold i was
[2:14:16] shapen in iniquity and in sin did my
[2:14:18] mother conceive me
[2:14:20] romans 3 verse 23 reads for all have
[2:14:23] sinned and come short of the glory of
[2:14:24] god
[2:14:25] abraham was raised in ur of the chaldeas
[2:14:28] a southern babylonian city
[2:14:31] even as a sinner abraham's soul was
[2:14:33] thirsting for god but barren of faith
[2:14:36] therefore his soul was in the state of
[2:14:37] unbelief yet thirsting for truth
[2:14:41] one wonderful day in mesopotamia
[2:14:43] the god of glory appeared to abraham
[2:14:46] although he was still known as abram
[2:14:47] until genesis 17 verse 5
[2:14:50] and in his freemore agency received
[2:14:53] god's word becoming a believer
[2:14:55] abraham freely chose to believe god and
[2:14:57] now had faith in god
[2:14:59] which set his way or course
[2:15:02] to acceptance with god in heaven indeed
[2:15:05] abraham had been converted from the heir
[2:15:07] of his way according to james 5 20.
[2:15:10] hebrews 11 verses 8 through 10 details
[2:15:13] how by faith his faith infused soul
[2:15:16] directed his earthly course
[2:15:18] by faith abraham when he was called to
[2:15:20] go out into a place
[2:15:22] which he should after receive for an
[2:15:24] inheritance obeyed
[2:15:26] and he went out not knowing whether he
[2:15:28] went
[2:15:29] by faith he sojourned in the land of
[2:15:31] promise as in a strange country dwelling
[2:15:34] in tabernacles with isaac and jacob the
[2:15:36] heirs with him of the same promise for
[2:15:38] he looked for a city which hath
[2:15:40] foundations whose builder and maker is
[2:15:42] god
[2:15:44] lot abraham's nephew
[2:15:47] undoubtedly experienced this same
[2:15:48] salvation in his soul
[2:15:50] 2 peter 2 verses 7 through 9 says lot
[2:15:53] was a righteous man with a righteous
[2:15:55] soul
[2:15:56] faith in his soul directed his earthly
[2:15:58] course to resist and rightfully accuse
[2:16:01] the sodomites of their wickedness
[2:16:03] god then mercifully delivered him from
[2:16:05] the judgment of sodom and gomorrah
[2:16:08] figuratively the seed of god's word had
[2:16:10] fallen upon abraham's soul
[2:16:13] but not yet quickened the seed contained
[2:16:15] powerful potential to produce great
[2:16:17] fruits of the spirit but could not due
[2:16:20] to the spiritual conditions of abraham's
[2:16:22] lifetime
[2:16:24] a natural seed lays dormant until three
[2:16:26] conditions are met sufficient water
[2:16:29] light and fertile soil
[2:16:30] the spiritual seed of god's word also
[2:16:33] needs three conditions met
[2:16:35] in abraham's lifetime two of the three
[2:16:37] spiritual conditions needed to quicken
[2:16:39] the seed in his soul were unavailable
[2:16:42] the water of the spirit was available to
[2:16:44] believers as you've already read of
[2:16:46] numerous old testament saints being
[2:16:48] powerfully anointed of the holy spirit
[2:16:50] in their human spirits
[2:16:52] god graciously anointed believers minds
[2:16:54] and bodies who longed for his presence
[2:16:57] but spiritual light and fertile soil
[2:16:59] were unavailable
[2:17:02] spiritual light is the knowledge of
[2:17:03] jesus christ and forgiveness of sins
[2:17:05] through his cross
[2:17:07] jesus's cross and pardoning blood were
[2:17:09] nearly 2 000 years in the future ahead
[2:17:11] of abraham and thus unavailable
[2:17:14] spiritually fertile soil was unavailable
[2:17:17] too because of the weakness of animal
[2:17:19] sacrifices
[2:17:20] jesus says a fertile heart is an honest
[2:17:23] and good heart in luke 8 15. according
[2:17:26] to hebrews 9 verses 9 through 14
[2:17:28] abraham's flesh could be purified after
[2:17:30] animal sacrifice but his human spirit or
[2:17:33] heart didn't completely feel good
[2:17:36] specifically abraham's conscience could
[2:17:38] not be fully purged from dead works to
[2:17:40] serve the living god imagine abraham
[2:17:43] sacrificing and worshiping in sincerity
[2:17:45] trusting he was forgiven and righteous
[2:17:47] in god's sight by meeting his
[2:17:49] requirements but leaving his altar with
[2:17:52] an unclean guilty conscience remembering
[2:17:55] his past sins
[2:17:57] after each of abraham's animal
[2:17:59] sacrifices hebrews 10 verses 3 and 4
[2:18:02] says there was a remembrance again of
[2:18:04] sins every year
[2:18:06] because it was not possible that the
[2:18:08] blood of bulls and of goats should take
[2:18:10] away sins
[2:18:11] animal blood purged the flesh but not
[2:18:13] the human spirit
[2:18:16] with an unclean human spirit god could
[2:18:18] not baptize abraham's human spirit with
[2:18:20] his spirit let alone his soul
[2:18:22] it's clear the conditions for the soul
[2:18:24] baptism weren't right
[2:18:27] the remembrance of sins is observable in
[2:18:29] the lives of old testament saints
[2:18:32] especially in job and david
[2:18:34] jobe 9 verse 2 and verse 33 show job's
[2:18:37] desire to feel just with god through a
[2:18:40] mediator that would bring peace between
[2:18:42] he and god
[2:18:43] that mediator would later come as jesus
[2:18:45] christ the one mediator between god and
[2:18:48] men
[2:18:49] job's many previous animal sacrifices
[2:18:51] were accepted by god but it wasn't
[2:18:53] possible for the blood of those animals
[2:18:55] to make job feel truly justified job
[2:18:59] knew he lacked a person his mediator
[2:19:01] jesus christ
[2:19:03] david knew he lacked the same echoing
[2:19:05] similar thoughts in psalm 130 verse 3
[2:19:08] and psalm 143 verse 2.
[2:19:11] israel's king asked if thou lord
[2:19:14] shouldest mark iniquities o lord who
[2:19:16] shall stand
[2:19:18] david said in thy sight shall no man
[2:19:20] living be justified
[2:19:22] paul said the law couldn't justify
[2:19:24] believers like job and david when he
[2:19:27] said therefore by the deeds of the law
[2:19:29] there shall no flesh be justified in his
[2:19:31] sight
[2:19:33] job and david's words explain their lack
[2:19:35] of rest or lack of the holy ghost
[2:19:37] baptism but to their credit god was
[2:19:40] hiding it from every old testament age
[2:19:42] and generation
[2:19:44] in accordance with the forthcoming keys
[2:19:47] of death and hell section
[2:19:48] abraham and the old testament saints
[2:19:50] lived a life subject to bondage and the
[2:19:53] fear of death due to the weakness of
[2:19:55] animal sacrifices
[2:19:56] but this fit into the plan of god to
[2:19:59] magnify the power of jesus's blood the
[2:20:02] law was a teacher a schoolmaster to
[2:20:04] bring us unto christ
[2:20:06] weak animal sacrifices emphasize the
[2:20:09] need for the powerful sinless holy
[2:20:11] sacrifice of christ
[2:20:14] before the cross satan stood before god
[2:20:17] like a cruel lawyer accusing all
[2:20:19] believers of sins based upon god's own
[2:20:21] law
[2:20:22] lucifer is rightly named the accuser of
[2:20:24] our brethren
[2:20:25] colossians 2 verse 14 makes it seem
[2:20:28] satan had compiled a written record of
[2:20:30] the sins of the old testament saints
[2:20:32] as handwriting of ordinances that was
[2:20:35] against them
[2:20:36] thankfully jesus death blotted out the
[2:20:39] handwriting taking it out of the way
[2:20:41] nailing it to his cross
[2:20:43] indeed all the evidence of our sins was
[2:20:45] nailed to his cross and taken out of the
[2:20:48] way isaiah 53 verse 6 rightly declares
[2:20:51] the lord hath laid on him the iniquity
[2:20:53] of us all
[2:20:55] our ransom or sin debt was paid in full
[2:20:57] by the substitutionary sacrifice of
[2:21:00] jesus christ three scriptures say jesus
[2:21:03] gave his life as a ransom payment for
[2:21:05] all sinners
[2:21:07] returning to abraham and lot both men
[2:21:10] had righteous souls by obeying god's
[2:21:12] animal sacrifice requirements but their
[2:21:14] degree of dedication to god's word and
[2:21:17] separation from sin differed
[2:21:19] abraham lived in total surrender to god
[2:21:22] while lot pitched his tent toward sodom
[2:21:25] before eventually becoming a resident in
[2:21:27] the sin saturated city
[2:21:29] lot's testimony only produced the saving
[2:21:31] of two souls out of sodom his virgin
[2:21:34] daughters before its destruction
[2:21:37] previous to losing his wife to the
[2:21:39] pillar of salt condemnation and his
[2:21:41] other daughters and son-in-laws in the
[2:21:44] fire and brimstone la experienced daily
[2:21:46] vexation from everything he saw and
[2:21:49] heard in sodom
[2:21:50] abraham's life was peaceful not of
[2:21:53] torment as lotz was
[2:21:55] genesis 18 verse 19 and genesis 26 verse
[2:21:59] 5
[2:22:00] portray the father of faith patriarch as
[2:22:02] an obedient diligent teacher and keeper
[2:22:05] of god's commands among his family and
[2:22:08] household servants
[2:22:10] recalling the stature of a perfect man
[2:22:12] from chapter 5 abraham and lot both
[2:22:15] advanced in character adding traits to
[2:22:17] their faith
[2:22:18] with souls anointed with faith both men
[2:22:21] yielded their human spirits to god's
[2:22:22] service
[2:22:23] it seems abraham obtained the seventh
[2:22:26] trait brotherly kindness because he
[2:22:28] rescued lot from the kings gave lot the
[2:22:31] first choice on land to inhabit and then
[2:22:33] dramatically interceded with god for lot
[2:22:36] and the believer's souls in sodom
[2:22:39] abraham's soul though couldn't be born
[2:22:41] again due to the weakness of the law and
[2:22:43] animal blood
[2:22:44] it's likely lot only reached the fourth
[2:22:46] trait temperance because he was not
[2:22:48] content living away from sodom's riches
[2:22:51] impatient purposely lived amongst the
[2:22:53] ungodly sodomites ungodly and took the
[2:22:57] first choice of land to inhabit rather
[2:22:59] than allowing his elder uncle the first
[2:23:01] choice lacked brotherly kindness like
[2:23:04] jesus's disciples old testament saints
[2:23:06] could gain and lose the divine character
[2:23:08] qualities in their human spirits
[2:23:13] soul redemption through christ's blood
[2:23:15] peter writes of both the soul's
[2:23:17] redemption through christ's blood
[2:23:19] and its purification by the spirit in
[2:23:22] his first epistle he declares christians
[2:23:24] were not redeemed with corruptible
[2:23:26] things as silver and gold but with the
[2:23:29] precious blood of christ as of a lamb
[2:23:31] without blemish and without spot
[2:23:34] in the greek redeemed means to release
[2:23:37] on receipt of ransom and liberate by
[2:23:39] payment of ransom to cause to be
[2:23:42] released
[2:23:43] to oneself by payment of a ransom to
[2:23:45] deliver
[2:23:47] new testament saints experienced
[2:23:49] liberated souls meaning the souls of the
[2:23:51] old testament saints were not yet
[2:23:53] released or delivered from satan's
[2:23:55] authority
[2:23:56] hence all believing souls in the old
[2:23:58] testament were kept in abraham's bosom
[2:24:00] in the heart of the earth separated only
[2:24:03] by a great chasm from the unbelievers in
[2:24:05] hell
[2:24:06] the devil had brought all men souls into
[2:24:08] bondage to sin by overcoming adam in
[2:24:11] eden
[2:24:12] jesus's self-sacrificial blood literally
[2:24:15] purchased the believer's souls back to
[2:24:17] god
[2:24:18] acts 20 verse 28 says christ purchased
[2:24:21] the church with his own blood
[2:24:23] since the wages of sin was death death
[2:24:26] of an innocent substitute was lawful
[2:24:28] payment or ransom for the redemption of
[2:24:30] believing souls
[2:24:32] matthew 20 verse 28 says the son of man
[2:24:35] came not to be ministered unto but to
[2:24:37] minister and to give his life
[2:24:40] a ransom for many friend jesus's blood
[2:24:43] bought your soul you are bought with a
[2:24:46] price therefore glorify god in your body
[2:24:49] and in your spirit which are gods
[2:24:52] now that christ's blood has paid in full
[2:24:55] the ransom for every believing soul
[2:24:57] there is now no condemnation to them
[2:24:59] which are in christ jesus who walk not
[2:25:02] after the flesh but after the spirit
[2:25:04] new testament believers can serve god
[2:25:06] with great freedom and liberty through a
[2:25:08] clean holy conscience
[2:25:10] hebrews 9 14 reads how much more shall
[2:25:13] the blood of christ who through the
[2:25:15] eternal spirit offered himself without
[2:25:17] spot to god purge your conscience from
[2:25:20] dead works to serve the living god
[2:25:23] if abraham could faithfully command and
[2:25:25] teach others god's will with a defiled
[2:25:27] conscience how much more should we serve
[2:25:30] our living god through the conscience
[2:25:32] purging blood of jesus christ
[2:25:34] let us serve him in complete liberation
[2:25:36] from condemnation
[2:25:38] romans 5 verse 1 rings true therefore
[2:25:41] being justified by faith we have peace
[2:25:43] with god through our lord jesus christ
[2:25:48] paradise and the keys of death and hell
[2:25:51] before calvary satan held the keys of
[2:25:53] death and hell
[2:25:54] hebrews 2 verse 14 labels satan's keys
[2:25:57] as the power of death since they are not
[2:26:00] literal keys but spiritual authority
[2:26:03] satan earned the keys by beguiling eve
[2:26:05] into sinning which was followed by
[2:26:07] adam's willful sin through the fall
[2:26:10] satan conquered adam god's chosen ruler
[2:26:12] of the earth and all mankind came into
[2:26:15] bondage to satan and sin
[2:26:17] according to god's law ii peter 2 verse
[2:26:20] 19 says for of whom a man is overcome of
[2:26:23] the same is he brought in bondage
[2:26:27] for the next four thousand years after
[2:26:28] adam during the old testament mankind
[2:26:31] lived under this bondage and fear of
[2:26:33] death as slaves to sin
[2:26:36] thankfully another portion of god's law
[2:26:38] written in heaven before written on
[2:26:40] earth provided forgiveness of sins
[2:26:43] through the shedding of innocent blood
[2:26:45] this was certainly one of the better
[2:26:47] promises hebrews 9 verse 22 declares
[2:26:50] without shedding of blood is no
[2:26:52] remission
[2:26:53] substituting innocent blood and payment
[2:26:55] for someone else's sin is called a
[2:26:57] ransom or price for redeeming god
[2:27:00] ordained animal sacrifices to provide a
[2:27:02] temporary covering for sin in the old
[2:27:05] testament but not a total abolishment of
[2:27:07] sin
[2:27:08] truly the blood of bulls and goats could
[2:27:10] never take away sins which allowed satan
[2:27:12] to use the keys of death to keep all
[2:27:15] believers captive in the heart of the
[2:27:16] earth after their deaths
[2:27:19] animal sacrifices were limited in power
[2:27:22] only purifying the flesh and not the
[2:27:24] human spirit or conscience of man
[2:27:27] since a human adam calls the fall
[2:27:30] a human life not an animal life had to
[2:27:33] pay the ransom for sin
[2:27:35] first corinthians 15 verses 21 and 22
[2:27:38] verify this saying for since by man came
[2:27:41] death by man mankind also the
[2:27:44] resurrection of the dead for as in adam
[2:27:46] all die even so in christ shall all be
[2:27:49] made alive
[2:27:51] a holy human sacrifice was needed to
[2:27:53] obtain
[2:27:54] eternal redemption for us and pay the
[2:27:56] full ransom for sin where could god get
[2:27:59] a holy sinless human being to become a
[2:28:01] willing offering for all humanity's sins
[2:28:06] god in his spirit form could not die and
[2:28:08] shed blood so he prepared himself a body
[2:28:11] his son
[2:28:12] and jesus willingly died on the cross to
[2:28:14] give his life a ransom for many
[2:28:17] just as god provided himself a sacrifice
[2:28:19] to save abraham's natural seed isaac god
[2:28:23] again provided his own sacrifice for
[2:28:25] abraham's spiritual seed the new
[2:28:27] testament church hebrews 9 verses 12
[2:28:30] through 14 validates this saying neither
[2:28:32] by the blood of goats and calves but by
[2:28:35] his own blood he entered in once into
[2:28:37] the holy place having obtained eternal
[2:28:39] redemption for us
[2:28:41] for if the blood of bulls and of goats
[2:28:43] and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling
[2:28:45] the unclean sanctifieth to the purifying
[2:28:48] of the flesh how much more shall the
[2:28:50] blood of christ who threw the eternal
[2:28:52] spirit offered himself without spot to
[2:28:55] god purge your conscience from dead
[2:28:57] works to serve the living god
[2:29:01] in the next chapter hebrews 10 verses 1
[2:29:03] through 18 these truths are expounded
[2:29:06] upon god prepared a body for himself
[2:29:09] since jesus is called emmanuel meaning
[2:29:11] god with us in the greek by jesus
[2:29:14] crucifixion we are sanctified through
[2:29:16] the offering of the body of jesus christ
[2:29:19] once and for all
[2:29:20] jesus is pure sinless life made him the
[2:29:23] one and only acceptable sacrifice unto
[2:29:25] god
[2:29:26] allowing our sins and iniquities to be
[2:29:28] completely abolished hebrews 10 verse 14
[2:29:32] and verses 17 through 18 reads
[2:29:35] for by one offering he hath perfected
[2:29:37] forever them that are sanctified and
[2:29:39] their sins and iniquities will i
[2:29:41] remember no more now where remission of
[2:29:43] these is there is no more offering for
[2:29:46] sin
[2:29:48] hebrews 2 verses 14 through 18 brings a
[2:29:51] great climax to this section pronouncing
[2:29:53] jesus's death destroyed satan's hold on
[2:29:56] the old testament saints and delivered
[2:29:58] them from bondage
[2:30:00] hebrews 2 verses 14 through 16 reads for
[2:30:03] as much then as the children are
[2:30:05] partakers of flesh and blood he also
[2:30:07] himself likewise took part of the same
[2:30:10] that through death he might destroy him
[2:30:12] that had the power of death that is the
[2:30:14] devil and deliver them who through fear
[2:30:17] of death were all their lifetimes
[2:30:19] subject to bondage for verily he took
[2:30:21] not on him the nature of angels but he
[2:30:24] took on him the seed of abraham
[2:30:27] by jesus paying the sin ransom with his
[2:30:29] holy blood he destroyed satan's
[2:30:31] influence over mankind
[2:30:35] as jesus's dead body lay in joseph of
[2:30:38] arimathea's tomb christ went by the
[2:30:40] spirit to hell located in the heart of
[2:30:43] the earth and took the keys of death and
[2:30:45] hell from satan christ now possessed the
[2:30:48] power of death this was a total surprise
[2:30:50] attack and raid upon hell
[2:30:53] neither satan nor the kings of the earth
[2:30:55] had predicted jesus redemption of the
[2:30:57] keys of death and hell that adam
[2:30:59] forfeited first corinthians 2 verses 7
[2:31:02] and 8 says none of the princes of this
[2:31:04] world knew for had they known it they
[2:31:06] would not have crucified the lord of
[2:31:08] glory
[2:31:09] if herod pilate and especially satan had
[2:31:12] known what jesus would accomplish after
[2:31:14] his death they would not have helped
[2:31:16] crucify him but god brilliantly hid
[2:31:19] jesus's raid on hell and subsequent
[2:31:21] resurrection in one of the 23 000 old
[2:31:25] testament verses
[2:31:26] psalm 16 verse 10 contains one of god's
[2:31:29] better promises
[2:31:31] jesus seizing the keys of death and hell
[2:31:34] david speaking of christ wrote for thou
[2:31:36] wilt not leave my soul in hell neither
[2:31:39] will thou suffer thine holy one to see
[2:31:41] corruption
[2:31:43] satan and the princes of the world
[2:31:45] didn't understand and weren't aware of
[2:31:48] the ramifications of the psalm 16 verse
[2:31:51] 10 prophecy allowing jesus to resurrect
[2:31:54] from the dead
[2:31:55] through jesus's innocent death he paid
[2:31:57] our ransom conquering death
[2:32:00] acts 2 verse 24 reads christ loosed the
[2:32:03] pains of death because it was not
[2:32:05] possible that he should be holding of it
[2:32:07] jesus paid our penalty and took death's
[2:32:10] keys from satan
[2:32:12] with the keys of death in his hand the
[2:32:14] true lion the lion of the tribe of judah
[2:32:17] led many of the old testament saints
[2:32:19] previously dwelling in abraham's bosom
[2:32:21] up to the earth's surface on easter
[2:32:23] morning
[2:32:24] christ first opened his grave and then
[2:32:26] many other graves of the saints who came
[2:32:28] out of the graves after his resurrection
[2:32:31] and went into the holy city and appeared
[2:32:33] unto many
[2:32:34] job's prophecy had finally come true a
[2:32:37] resurrected job was standing in a new
[2:32:39] glorified body on the earth with his
[2:32:42] redeemer just as his vision predicted
[2:32:45] nearly sixteen hundred years before
[2:32:47] christ
[2:32:48] for i know that my redeemer liveth and
[2:32:50] that he shall stand at the latter day
[2:32:52] upon the earth
[2:32:54] and though after my skin worms destroy
[2:32:56] this body yet in my flesh shall i see
[2:32:59] god whom i shall see for myself and mine
[2:33:02] eyes shall behold and not another though
[2:33:04] my reigns be consumed within me
[2:33:08] jesus was seen for 40 days after his
[2:33:10] resurrection and it seems likely the old
[2:33:12] testament saints were also seen for this
[2:33:14] time period
[2:33:15] imagine the thrill for believers living
[2:33:17] in jerusalem to know they could see a
[2:33:19] resurrected christ as well as a
[2:33:21] resurrected abraham and sarah job joseph
[2:33:24] or david around any corner but imagine
[2:33:27] the shame and mental torment for men
[2:33:29] like caiaphas and pilate who might have
[2:33:32] seen the resurrected ones and heard
[2:33:33] report after report of jesus and the
[2:33:36] saints being alive
[2:33:39] at the conclusion of the 40-day period
[2:33:41] jesus ascended to heaven in a cloud
[2:33:43] inside of his apostles to sit at the
[2:33:45] right hand of the majesty on high as he
[2:33:48] went out of their sight ascending
[2:33:49] towards his heavenly throne he was
[2:33:51] joined by the resurrected old testament
[2:33:53] saints
[2:33:54] the saints followed their leader the son
[2:33:56] of god towards glory as ephesians 4
[2:33:59] verse 5 says when he ascended up on high
[2:34:02] he led captivity captive
[2:34:05] jesus led captivity captive meaning he
[2:34:07] led the old testament saints out of
[2:34:09] captivity from the heart of the earth
[2:34:12] and into god's possession or divine
[2:34:14] captivity
[2:34:16] by god's power they rose higher and
[2:34:18] higher until they reached heaven's gates
[2:34:20] psalm 24 verses 7 through 10 records the
[2:34:24] dialogue between christ the resurrected
[2:34:26] saints and the angel doorkeepers as the
[2:34:29] resurrected ones arrive at heaven's
[2:34:31] doors
[2:34:32] jesus voice shouts lift up your heads o
[2:34:36] ye gates and be lift up ye everlasting
[2:34:39] doors and the king of glory shall come
[2:34:41] in
[2:34:42] the door
[2:34:43] dutifully asked for identification upon
[2:34:45] entrance into heaven saying who is this
[2:34:48] king of glory
[2:34:49] abraham sarah job and the resurrected
[2:34:52] saints proclaimed their king's
[2:34:53] credentials saying the lord strong and
[2:34:56] mighty the lord mighty in battle
[2:34:59] how strong mighty and glorious was
[2:35:01] christ when he was slapped buffeted spit
[2:35:04] on beaten scoured stripped crucified and
[2:35:07] stabbed in obedience of the father's
[2:35:09] will
[2:35:10] christ endured the unfathomable
[2:35:12] brutality and shame of the cross for
[2:35:15] this moment the moment of joyfully
[2:35:17] entering his kingdom with his redeemed
[2:35:20] forgiven subjects hebrews 12 verse 2
[2:35:22] says looking under jesus the author and
[2:35:25] finisher of our faith who for the joy
[2:35:27] that was set before him endured the
[2:35:30] cross despising the shame and is set
[2:35:32] down at the right hand of the throne of
[2:35:34] god
[2:35:36] the dialogue repeats in psalm 24 verses
[2:35:39] 9-10 as jesus again commands for
[2:35:42] heaven's gates to be lifted up so the
[2:35:44] king of glory can enter the doorkeepers
[2:35:46] again ask who is the king of glory and
[2:35:49] the resurrected saints declare their
[2:35:50] savior jesus christ as the lord of hosts
[2:35:54] he is the king of glory jesus is the
[2:35:56] lord of hosts proving his supremacy over
[2:35:59] all creatures including the heavenly
[2:36:01] armies
[2:36:02] did not jesus say he had the option of
[2:36:04] asking his father for 12 legions of
[2:36:06] angels to appear at his side the greek
[2:36:09] meaning of legions is
[2:36:11] 6826 men exacting 12 legions or nearly
[2:36:15] 82 000 angels according to colossians 1
[2:36:19] verses 15 through 17 christ is the image
[2:36:22] of the invisible god
[2:36:24] firstborn of every creature creator of
[2:36:26] all things before all things and by him
[2:36:29] all things consist
[2:36:31] the lord jesus christ is the king of
[2:36:33] glory
[2:36:35] since jesus's ascension to heaven with
[2:36:37] the resurrected old testament saints he
[2:36:40] has been fulfilling his high priest
[2:36:41] office seated on his heavenly throne
[2:36:44] making intercession for the saints
[2:36:46] living on earth
[2:36:47] in the new testament saint can no longer
[2:36:50] empower necromancers like the witch of
[2:36:52] endor to access believer's souls because
[2:36:55] they are protected in heaven by the
[2:36:57] blood of jesus christ
[2:36:59] god's son bruised the serpent's head on
[2:37:01] the cross crushing his venomous power of
[2:37:03] death life conquered death and now all
[2:37:06] who believe are freely forgiven all
[2:37:08] their trespasses and ascend to heaven
[2:37:11] upon death
[2:37:12] rather than descending to the lower
[2:37:13] parts of the earth
[2:37:16] paul knew upon his death he would ascend
[2:37:18] to heaven and put on his eternal body
[2:37:20] that awaited him there
[2:37:22] second corinthians 5 verses 1 and 2 says
[2:37:25] for we know that if our earthly house of
[2:37:27] this tabernacle were dissolved we have a
[2:37:29] building of god and house not made with
[2:37:32] hands eternal in the heavens
[2:37:34] for in this we groan earnestly desiring
[2:37:37] to be clothed upon with our house which
[2:37:39] is from heaven paradise is no longer in
[2:37:42] the heart of the earth it's located in
[2:37:44] heaven in second corinthians 12 4 the
[2:37:47] apostle said he was caught up into
[2:37:49] paradise
[2:37:50] upon death christian souls ascend up to
[2:37:52] paradise not down
[2:37:55] christians are assured to be present
[2:37:56] with the lord after leaving their
[2:37:58] earthly bodies
[2:37:59] we are confident i say and willing
[2:38:02] rather to be absent from the body and to
[2:38:04] be present with the lord
[2:38:08] souls and the book of life
[2:38:11] as illustrated in jesus's sower and the
[2:38:13] four grounds parable in matthew 13
[2:38:16] verses three through nine
[2:38:17] see chapter eight each soul or ground
[2:38:20] has the opportunity to receive god's
[2:38:22] word or seed
[2:38:24] the mysterious truth of the second
[2:38:26] ground called the stony ground teaches
[2:38:28] souls like judas iscariot can
[2:38:31] temporarily receive the word faith and
[2:38:34] grow thereby for a period of time before
[2:38:36] ultimately rejecting it leaving their
[2:38:39] souls lost and bound for the lake of
[2:38:41] fire the stony ground's loss of sea life
[2:38:44] explains the oft misunderstood subject
[2:38:47] of names being blotted out from the book
[2:38:49] of life
[2:38:51] when a name is blotted out of the book
[2:38:53] of life the person loses the gift of
[2:38:55] salvation
[2:38:57] it's true a person can believe in christ
[2:38:58] for salvation but later reject christ
[2:39:01] just like a person can receive a
[2:39:03] christmas gift but later discard it
[2:39:06] both gifts salvation and a christmas
[2:39:08] present are given by unmerited grace but
[2:39:11] the receiver must accept and keep the
[2:39:13] gift
[2:39:14] salvation is a promise based upon
[2:39:16] conditions if you believe and endure
[2:39:19] unto the end
[2:39:20] hebrews 10 verse 39 says you must
[2:39:22] believe to the saving of the soul
[2:39:24] chapter 8 will deal more with this
[2:39:26] subject in light of judas iscariots
[2:39:29] falling away from salvation as john 17
[2:39:32] verse 12 says none of the disciples were
[2:39:34] lost but the son of perdition
[2:39:37] jesus said he kept the other 11
[2:39:38] disciples but judas was lost
[2:39:41] judas was saved but later forfeited
[2:39:43] salvation for money
[2:39:45] judas obtained part of a holy ghost
[2:39:48] ministry god took away his part out of
[2:39:50] the book of life when he betrayed christ
[2:39:53] you can read hebrews 6 verses 4 through
[2:39:56] 8 and hebrews 10 verses 26 through 29
[2:39:59] and verses 38 and 39 in the meantime for
[2:40:03] more on this truth
[2:40:05] often repeat the phrase once saved
[2:40:08] always saved but judas proves this
[2:40:10] phrase incorrect the true phrase is once
[2:40:13] sealed always sealed based upon
[2:40:15] ephesians 4 30.
[2:40:17] once a believer's soul is sealed by the
[2:40:19] holy ghost baptism he is destined for
[2:40:22] heaven
[2:40:24] is there eternal security for christians
[2:40:27] yes every christian who meets god's
[2:40:29] salvation requirements is eternally
[2:40:31] secure
[2:40:32] your faith is the evidence of your
[2:40:34] eternal security
[2:40:35] john 10 verses 27 through 29 says jesus
[2:40:39] sheep hear his voice and he gives them
[2:40:41] eternal life
[2:40:42] messiah promises no man is able to pluck
[2:40:45] them out of my father's hand
[2:40:47] but transgressors workers of iniquity
[2:40:50] the slawful and wicked have no eternal
[2:40:52] security because they forfeit eternal
[2:40:55] life for temporal pleasures of this life
[2:40:59] four astounding truths exist regarding
[2:41:01] the book of life
[2:41:03] first it's located in heaven and those
[2:41:05] whose names are on it should rejoice
[2:41:07] according to luke 10 verse 20.
[2:41:10] second it is the faithful witness the
[2:41:12] lord jesus who wrote the book of life
[2:41:15] but also he alone blots names out
[2:41:18] according to exodus 32 verses 32 and 33
[2:41:21] deuteronomy 29 verse 20 and revelation 3
[2:41:24] verse 5.
[2:41:26] these scriptures also teach christ blots
[2:41:28] out the names on the grounds of
[2:41:30] willfully sinning against him or failing
[2:41:32] to overcome the world
[2:41:35] third two scriptures revelation 13 verse
[2:41:38] 8 and revelation 17 verse 8 say all the
[2:41:41] names within the book of life were
[2:41:43] written before the foundation of the
[2:41:45] world through god's foreknowledge
[2:41:47] meaning there is no present compiling of
[2:41:50] names your name wasn't written on the
[2:41:52] book of life the day you were saved like
[2:41:54] many believe
[2:41:55] rather god foreknew you'd be saved and
[2:41:57] wrote it before the foundation of the
[2:41:59] world
[2:42:00] revelation 13 verse 8 and 17 verse 8
[2:42:03] also reveal the fourth truth that
[2:42:05] unbelievers names or the wayside souls
[2:42:08] have never been nor ever will be written
[2:42:11] on the book of life
[2:42:13] figure 18 rightly divides the locations
[2:42:15] of names in heaven's books based upon
[2:42:18] jesus's classification of souls into
[2:42:21] four categories
[2:42:23] obviously the names of unbelievers are
[2:42:25] recorded in some heavenly books referred
[2:42:28] to in revelation 20 verse 12.
[2:42:30] but the only book with eternally saved
[2:42:32] names is another book which is the book
[2:42:35] of life
[2:42:37] figure 18
[2:42:38] good souls matthew 13 verse 23
[2:42:42] names written in the lamb section of the
[2:42:44] book of life before the foundation of
[2:42:46] the world also known as wise virgins
[2:42:49] in matthew 25 verses 1-13
[2:42:53] thorny souls matthew 13 verse 22
[2:42:56] names written in the book of life before
[2:42:58] the foundation of the world and left
[2:43:00] remaining therein
[2:43:02] also known as foolish virgins in matthew
[2:43:04] 25 verses 1 through 13. 13
[2:43:07] stony souls matthew 13 verses 20 and 21
[2:43:12] names were written in the book of life
[2:43:13] section before the foundation of the
[2:43:15] world but blotted out due to their sins
[2:43:19] wayside souls matthew 13 verse 19
[2:43:22] names were never written in the book of
[2:43:24] life but were recorded in other books
[2:43:28] both the old and new testaments offer
[2:43:31] examples of names being blotted out of
[2:43:33] the book of life the old has three
[2:43:35] examples and the new alludes to one
[2:43:38] beginning in the old israel's worship of
[2:43:41] the golden calf in exodus 32 serves as
[2:43:44] the first witness of god blotting out
[2:43:46] names from the book of life
[2:43:48] moses unselfishly stood in the gap for
[2:43:51] idolatrous israel offering for his name
[2:43:53] to be blotted out instead of israel's
[2:43:56] but the lord said unto moses whosoever
[2:43:59] has sinned against me him will i blot
[2:44:01] out of my book
[2:44:03] hebrews 3 verses 16 through 19 and jude
[2:44:06] 1 verse 5
[2:44:08] affirmed that many israelis who fell in
[2:44:10] the wilderness were lost their names
[2:44:12] being blotted out of the book of life
[2:44:16] two of the twelve tribes of israel
[2:44:18] dan and ephraim had their names blotted
[2:44:20] out from under heaven not in heaven for
[2:44:23] committing idolatry
[2:44:25] dan and ephraim were listed as part of
[2:44:26] the twelve sons of jacob that went into
[2:44:29] egypt in genesis 35 verses 22-26
[2:44:33] both names remained in their tribal
[2:44:35] order after leaving egypt in numbers 10
[2:44:38] verses 11-28
[2:44:40] but deuteronomy 29 verses 16-20 had
[2:44:43] pronounced the blotting out warning to
[2:44:45] any israeli who would go and serve the
[2:44:48] gods of these nations saying
[2:44:50] the lord shall blot out his name from
[2:44:52] under heaven
[2:44:54] the tribe of dan's idolatry is recorded
[2:44:56] in first kings 12 verses 25-30 and
[2:45:00] ephraim's joining to idols is found in
[2:45:02] hosea 4 verse 17.
[2:45:04] the consequences for their idolatry is
[2:45:07] nearly 3 000 years without tribal
[2:45:09] recognition proven in revelation 7
[2:45:11] verses 4 through
[2:45:13] as dan and ephraim's tribal names are
[2:45:15] missing from the 144 000 jews who are
[2:45:18] marked in their foreheads before the
[2:45:20] great destructions of the tribulation
[2:45:22] period
[2:45:23] surprisingly though god's amazing grace
[2:45:25] restores their tribal names in the
[2:45:27] millennium
[2:45:28] according to ezekiel 48 verses 1 through
[2:45:30] 8 and verses 22-29
[2:45:33] because dan and ephraim as literal sons
[2:45:36] of jacob will be resurrected as
[2:45:38] overcomers to inherit their tribe's
[2:45:40] portion of land
[2:45:42] the third blotting out took place at the
[2:45:44] very conclusion of the old testament at
[2:45:46] jesus's crucifixion
[2:45:48] after pilate's attempt to wash his hands
[2:45:50] of guilt and claim his innocence in
[2:45:53] jesus death all the people answered him
[2:45:56] his blood be upon us and our children
[2:45:59] the israeli multitude willingly rejected
[2:46:02] some ignorantly though as jesus prayed
[2:46:04] for their forgiveness
[2:46:05] their own messiah and paul says they
[2:46:08] were broken off or cut off from the life
[2:46:10] of god or holy spirit in romans 11 verse
[2:46:13] 19.
[2:46:14] psalm 69 verses 20 through 28 prophesied
[2:46:18] of christ's calvary humiliation and also
[2:46:21] the blotting out of the workers of
[2:46:22] iniquity who consented to jesus death
[2:46:26] verse 21 says they gave me also gal for
[2:46:29] meat and in my thirst they gave me
[2:46:31] vinegar to drink
[2:46:33] and then verse 28 reads let them be
[2:46:35] blotted out of the book of the living
[2:46:37] and not be written with the righteous
[2:46:39] many jews who rejected jesus had their
[2:46:41] names blotted out of the book of life
[2:46:44] but the apostle reassures us not all
[2:46:46] israel is lost though saying
[2:46:48] even so then at this present time also
[2:46:51] there is a remnant according to the
[2:46:53] election of grace
[2:46:55] even though the majority rejected their
[2:46:56] messiah god still saved the small
[2:46:58] remnant who worshiped in spirit and
[2:47:01] truth
[2:47:03] judas iscariot is the new testament
[2:47:05] example for an individual's name being
[2:47:07] blotted out of the book of life
[2:47:09] chapter 5 details his reception and
[2:47:12] eventual rejection of salvation
[2:47:15] but now you must know he was chosen by
[2:47:17] christ believed in christ was baptized
[2:47:20] under repentance and baptized others
[2:47:23] judas was commissioned by christ with
[2:47:24] the same holy ghost anointed ministry as
[2:47:27] the other 11 apostles in luke 9 verses 1
[2:47:30] and 2. then in luke 10 verses 17 17-24
[2:47:34] judas was among the group that jesus
[2:47:36] said had their names written in heaven
[2:47:38] sadly judas fell from his salvation by
[2:47:40] the wicked transgression of betrayal
[2:47:43] going to his own place or hell jesus
[2:47:45] says judas is lost he lost his soul
[2:47:49] his name's part on the book of life
[2:47:52] judas was overcome by the love of money
[2:47:54] he didn't overcome sin and consequently
[2:47:57] jesus was required to blot his name off
[2:48:00] the book of life
[2:48:01] had judas fully repented of his
[2:48:03] transgression and went to pentecost to
[2:48:05] receive the baptism of the holy ghost he
[2:48:07] would have been eternally sealed his
[2:48:10] name could have remained on the book
[2:48:12] but he departed from the faith
[2:48:14] like the stony ground judas for a while
[2:48:16] believed but then rejected the truth
[2:48:18] since he had no root in himself
[2:48:21] no deep genuine love for christ since
[2:48:23] paul says christians are rooted and
[2:48:25] grounded in love
[2:48:27] judas let the word seed grow a little
[2:48:29] making some progress but later let it
[2:48:31] die
[2:48:33] while the book of life was written
[2:48:35] before the foundation of the world and
[2:48:37] doesn't have names added to it during
[2:48:39] human history there is another heavenly
[2:48:41] book called the book of remembrance that
[2:48:44] is written in real time before the lord
[2:48:46] in his presence
[2:48:47] its purpose is to record the thoughts
[2:48:50] words and deeds of them that fear the
[2:48:52] lord malachi 3 verse 15 says then they
[2:48:55] that fear the lord spake often one to
[2:48:58] another and the lord hearkened and heard
[2:49:00] it and a book of remembrance was written
[2:49:03] before him for them that feared the lord
[2:49:05] and that thought upon his name
[2:49:07] in hebrew remembrance means memorial
[2:49:10] notice godly words and deeds are written
[2:49:13] therein acts 10 verses 3 and 4 seems to
[2:49:16] refer to this book as an angel of god
[2:49:19] tells cornelius his prayers and alms are
[2:49:22] come up for a memorial before god the
[2:49:24] book of remembrance will be useful in
[2:49:26] the future a signing of heavenly rewards
[2:49:30] finishing the book of life teaching
[2:49:32] there will be a future writing and
[2:49:34] compilation of names in a book in the
[2:49:36] new jerusalem also called mount zion the
[2:49:40] city of the living god in hebrews 12 22
[2:49:44] god foreknows all future inhabitants of
[2:49:46] this holy city psalm 87 verse 6 shows
[2:49:50] god will make a revised role of names
[2:49:52] who remain in the book of life after the
[2:49:54] second resurrection
[2:49:56] the lord shall count when he writeth up
[2:49:58] the people that this man was born there
[2:50:01] salah
[2:50:02] herein is the final roll call in heaven
[2:50:05] how we want our names to be in that
[2:50:07] number
[2:50:10] soul searching
[2:50:12] you may have heard christians say they
[2:50:14] search their soul for answers in the
[2:50:15] midst of life's trials most likely we
[2:50:18] can all relate to a time of soul
[2:50:20] searching a time to make major life
[2:50:22] decisions like salvation marriage family
[2:50:26] ending relationships or moving locations
[2:50:28] the bible calls this communing with your
[2:50:30] own heart as explained by david asaph
[2:50:34] and
[2:50:34] solomon this truth helps you understand
[2:50:37] how you can know your soul condition
[2:50:39] whether faith is present the soul is
[2:50:41] saved
[2:50:42] or absent the soul is lost
[2:50:46] you might also call soul searching a
[2:50:48] testing time or trial of your faith
[2:50:51] peter admits there are seasons in which
[2:50:53] your faith will undergo fiery tests
[2:50:55] in first peter 1 verses 6 through 8
[2:50:58] despite unspeakable loss suffering and
[2:51:00] disappointment the prophet job
[2:51:02] eventually recognized his faith was on
[2:51:04] trial he put his confidence in god and
[2:51:07] knew the outcome would produce godly
[2:51:09] character
[2:51:10] job 23 verse 10 reads but he knoweth the
[2:51:13] way that i take when he hath tried me i
[2:51:15] shall come forth as gold
[2:51:18] in psalm 4 verse 4 david writes
[2:51:21] stand in awe and sin not commune with
[2:51:24] your own heart upon your bed and be
[2:51:26] still
[2:51:27] soul searching is best accomplished
[2:51:29] during distraction free quiet time
[2:51:32] asaph's words in psalm 77 verse 6
[2:51:35] provide the great revelation that the
[2:51:36] human spirit or mind stills itself
[2:51:39] before searching the soul
[2:51:41] i call to remembrance my song in the
[2:51:43] night i commune with my own heart and my
[2:51:46] spirit made diligent search
[2:51:50] it is during the still moments and hours
[2:51:51] of soul searching that god leads and
[2:51:54] accompanies every heart on its soul
[2:51:56] search the gentle spirit of god anoints
[2:51:58] each human spirit to search its motives
[2:52:01] and objectives that originated in the
[2:52:03] soul
[2:52:04] recall the soul is home of freemore
[2:52:07] agency the human will
[2:52:09] as each soul comes in god's view he
[2:52:11] weighs the actions thoughts and
[2:52:13] decisions and gives each person the
[2:52:15] fruit of their doings
[2:52:17] first chronicles 28 verse 9 says the
[2:52:20] lord searcheth all hearts and
[2:52:22] understandeth all the imaginations of
[2:52:24] the thoughts
[2:52:26] if thou seek him he will be found of
[2:52:28] thee but if thou forsake him he will
[2:52:30] cast thee off forever
[2:52:32] jeremiah 17 verse 10 adds i the lord
[2:52:35] search the heart i try the reigns even
[2:52:38] to give every man according to his ways
[2:52:41] and according to the fruit of his doings
[2:52:43] jesus is the lord for revelation 2 verse
[2:52:46] 23 is jesus proclaiming i am he which
[2:52:50] searches the reigns and hearts and i
[2:52:52] will give unto every one of you
[2:52:54] according to your works
[2:52:57] at the conclusion of the search every
[2:52:59] soul decides to continue in their own
[2:53:01] will or abandon it for god's
[2:53:04] a worthy soul abandons their selfish
[2:53:06] will and seeks god's will and he
[2:53:09] promises to be found jeremiah 29 13
[2:53:12] states and ye shall seek me and find me
[2:53:15] when ye shall search for me with all
[2:53:17] your heart god satisfies the holy thirst
[2:53:20] inside worthy souls
[2:53:23] and unworthy souls like the rich man in
[2:53:25] jesus's parable in luke 12 verses 16-21
[2:53:30] the context is jesus encouraging a man
[2:53:32] to not covet his father's inheritance in
[2:53:34] verses 13-15
[2:53:37] jesus portrays a rich man communing with
[2:53:39] his own soul
[2:53:40] a rich man's human spirit tells his soul
[2:53:43] to take its ease in other words the man
[2:53:45] tells his own soul to take peace and
[2:53:47] comfort in his riches and to cease from
[2:53:50] trusting in god
[2:53:51] in luke 12 19 jesus makes it seem the
[2:53:54] human spirit or consciousness actually
[2:53:57] talks to the soul because it says and i
[2:53:59] will say to my soul soul thou has much
[2:54:02] goods laid up for many years take thy
[2:54:05] knees eat drink and be merry
[2:54:08] truly your consciousness either
[2:54:10] satisfies the holy thirst to know god in
[2:54:13] your soul or silences it
[2:54:16] jesus is parable about the rich man
[2:54:18] building greater barns is a classic
[2:54:21] example of a soul drawing back from
[2:54:23] living by faith
[2:54:25] the rich man told his soul to cease
[2:54:26] trusting in god and to trust in his
[2:54:29] great barns
[2:54:30] similarly judas iscariot's drawing back
[2:54:33] moment was his decision to leave jesus
[2:54:35] and his apostles at the last supper
[2:54:38] betraying his lord
[2:54:40] john 13 verse 2 reads and supper being
[2:54:43] ended the devil having now put into the
[2:54:45] heart of judas iscariot simon's son to
[2:54:48] betray him
[2:54:50] judas leaving the communion table
[2:54:52] symbolized him leaving faith
[2:54:54] judas left grace grace never left him
[2:54:58] he embodied hebrews 12 15 which says men
[2:55:01] can fail or fall back from the grace of
[2:55:04] god judas did despite unto the spirit of
[2:55:07] grace meaning he insulted the holy ghost
[2:55:10] he cast aside his faith and its absence
[2:55:13] allowed satan to enter judas heart
[2:55:16] luke 22 3 explains then entered satan
[2:55:20] into judas surnamed iscariot being of
[2:55:22] the number of the twelve
[2:55:25] i'm persuaded you can choose a better
[2:55:27] destiny than judas hebrews 6 verses 9
[2:55:30] through 12 declares
[2:55:32] but beloved we are persuaded better
[2:55:34] things of you and things that accompany
[2:55:36] salvation though we thus speak for god
[2:55:39] is not unrighteous to forget your work
[2:55:41] and labor of love which ye have showed
[2:55:43] toward his name in that ye have
[2:55:45] ministered to the saints and do minister
[2:55:48] and we desire that every one of you do
[2:55:50] show the same diligence to the full
[2:55:52] assurance of hope unto the end that ye
[2:55:55] be not slothful but followers of them
[2:55:57] who through faith and patience inherit
[2:55:59] the promises
[2:56:03] dividing asunder soul and spirit
[2:56:05] while the soul and human spirit are
[2:56:07] closely connected scripture says they
[2:56:09] can be differentiated in order to allow
[2:56:12] individual ministry in care
[2:56:15] your soul is like the core of the human
[2:56:17] spirit and they are interdependent
[2:56:19] adam became a living soul when both his
[2:56:21] human spirit and soul entered his body
[2:56:24] genesis 2 verse 7 says adam became a
[2:56:27] living soul as god breathed into his
[2:56:29] nostrils the breath of life
[2:56:32] once adam's human spirit and soul were
[2:56:34] placed inside his body he was alive
[2:56:37] contrary-wise at adam's passing away his
[2:56:40] human spirit and soul left his body and
[2:56:43] he was dead or separated from this earth
[2:56:47] a seed serves as a suitable illustration
[2:56:49] for man's three parts
[2:56:51] the seed coat is like the body the
[2:56:53] stored food like the human spirit and
[2:56:55] the embryo represents the soul
[2:56:58] a complete seed always has all three
[2:57:00] parts just as a human being is complete
[2:57:02] with the body human spirit and soul
[2:57:06] as a seed can be divided into its three
[2:57:08] parts man's three parts can be divided
[2:57:11] or differentiated by god's word
[2:57:13] hebrews 4 verse 12 declares for the word
[2:57:16] of god is quick and powerful and sharper
[2:57:19] than any two-edged sword piercing even
[2:57:21] to the dividing asunder of soul and
[2:57:23] spirit and of the joints in morrow and
[2:57:26] is a discerner of the thoughts and
[2:57:27] intents of the heart
[2:57:29] the word reveals the location of the
[2:57:31] spiritual battle whether in the soul or
[2:57:33] human spirit it also discerns or judges
[2:57:36] the thoughts and intents of the human
[2:57:38] spirit and soul
[2:57:41] when you hear it said i'm having a mind
[2:57:43] battle you know the person's human
[2:57:45] spirit is under attack
[2:57:47] this is when your mind feels foggy and
[2:57:49] confused
[2:57:50] paul says the word of god is our mighty
[2:57:52] weapon amidst mind battles in second
[2:57:54] corinthians 10 verse 5
[2:57:57] casting down imaginations and every high
[2:57:59] thing that exalteth itself against the
[2:58:01] knowledge of god and bringing into
[2:58:03] captivity every thought to the obedience
[2:58:06] of christ
[2:58:08] battle ready christians cast down or
[2:58:10] reject evil thoughts choosing to dwell
[2:58:12] on god's word in order to win mind
[2:58:14] battles
[2:58:15] paul says god's peace comes to those who
[2:58:18] purposely think on things that are true
[2:58:20] honest just pure lovely of good report
[2:58:24] virtuous and praiseworthy
[2:58:27] if someone says i'm going through a
[2:58:29] soul-searching time it usually means
[2:58:31] their soul is at war with possibly both
[2:58:34] the flesh and human spirit attacking it
[2:58:36] you already learned how soul searching
[2:58:38] is when major choices are made and when
[2:58:40] faith is tested and tried
[2:58:42] peter confirms how the flesh wars
[2:58:44] against the soul saying
[2:58:46] dearly beloved i beseech you as
[2:58:48] strangers and pilgrims abstain from
[2:58:50] fleshly lusts which war against the soul
[2:58:54] a young christian man in the corinth
[2:58:55] church was so overtaken by the fleshly
[2:58:58] lust of sexual immorality that paul
[2:59:01] excommunicated him from the church in
[2:59:03] hopes his soul would be saved
[2:59:05] paul recognized the battle for the
[2:59:07] deputy's soul in acts 13 verses 6
[2:59:10] through 12 when elimus the sorcerer
[2:59:13] tried to stop the deputy from hearing
[2:59:15] paul's preaching
[2:59:16] the deputy's soul desired to hear the
[2:59:19] word of god being preached the spirit
[2:59:21] led paul to pronounce temporary
[2:59:24] blindness upon elimus
[2:59:26] so the deputies hungry soul could
[2:59:27] receive the word
[2:59:29] upon seeing this mighty sign the deputy
[2:59:31] believed the gospel
[2:59:34] all christians benefit from god's sword
[2:59:36] word separating the soul from the human
[2:59:38] spirit in order to faithfully minister
[2:59:41] to their individual needs
[2:59:43] most often this happens as christians
[2:59:44] listen to preaching romans 10 verse 17
[2:59:47] reads so then faith cometh by hearing
[2:59:50] and hearing by the word of god
[2:59:52] through my own church attendance and
[2:59:54] preaching i've seen the holy spirit
[2:59:56] minister to believers minds by
[2:59:58] presenting new scriptures they had never
[2:59:59] seen before
[3:00:01] thereby helping them understand god's
[3:00:03] will and truth
[3:00:04] other times the word preached brings
[3:00:06] peace to unsettled minds
[3:00:08] i've also seen the word minister to the
[3:00:10] needs of the soul as god seeks his
[3:00:13] children's obedience submission and
[3:00:15] praise
[3:00:16] indeed the preaching of the cross is to
[3:00:18] them that perish foolishness but unto us
[3:00:20] which are saved it is the power of god
[3:00:25] ephesians 4 verses 11 through 16 teaches
[3:00:28] the holy spirit anoints the fivefold
[3:00:30] preaching ministry to equip and edify
[3:00:33] believers while bringing a unity of
[3:00:35] faith and knowledge about jesus christ
[3:00:38] the word conforms us to be christ-like
[3:00:41] transforming our thinking to renew our
[3:00:42] minds
[3:00:44] then the renewed human spirit can prove
[3:00:46] what is that good and acceptable and
[3:00:48] perfect will of god
[3:00:50] a renewed mind clearly understands god's
[3:00:52] perfect will for its soul
[3:00:57] jesus is universal invite to receive the
[3:00:59] soul baptism
[3:01:01] jesus paul and his new testament church
[3:01:04] sound a universal invitation to receive
[3:01:07] both salvation and the baptism of the
[3:01:09] holy ghost
[3:01:10] christ doesn't discriminate age race or
[3:01:13] gender all who want to be saved and
[3:01:16] filled with the holy ghost can be
[3:01:18] jesus in john 7 verses 37 through 39
[3:01:22] offer the living water of the holy
[3:01:24] spirit to any man saying if any man
[3:01:26] thirsts let him come unto me and drink
[3:01:29] in matthew 11 verses 28 through 30 jesus
[3:01:33] invites all to come unto him for soul
[3:01:35] rest
[3:01:36] come unto me all ye that labor and are
[3:01:38] heavy laden and i will give you rest
[3:01:41] paul says more of the same in romans 10
[3:01:44] verses 12 and 13
[3:01:46] for there is no difference between the
[3:01:48] jew and the greek for the same lord over
[3:01:50] all is rich unto all that call upon him
[3:01:53] for whosoever shall call upon the name
[3:01:55] of the lord shall be saved
[3:01:57] the holy spirit in the bride or new
[3:02:00] testament church freely offers the water
[3:02:02] of life to everyone in revelation 22 17
[3:02:06] and the spirit and the bride say come
[3:02:08] and let him that heareth say come and
[3:02:11] let him that is a thirst come and
[3:02:13] whosoever will let him take the water of
[3:02:16] life freely
[3:02:18] if you're thirsty for eternal water god
[3:02:20] is ready to quench your thirst
[3:02:23] this gracious universal invitation will
[3:02:26] be referenced on judgment day as
[3:02:28] everyone will admit to having an
[3:02:30] opportunity to repent and accept jesus
[3:02:32] christ as their savior
[3:02:34] recall romans 1 verse 20 teaches
[3:02:37] there'll be no excuses on the day of
[3:02:38] judgment
[3:02:39] yes romans 2 verse 16 says that day is
[3:02:42] coming the day when god shall judge the
[3:02:45] secrets of men by jesus christ according
[3:02:48] to my gospel
[3:02:49] no secret will be kept from jesus christ
[3:02:52] at that day the gospel he commissioned
[3:02:54] and revealed to paul will be his
[3:02:56] judgment standard respond to his loving
[3:02:59] universal invitation by receiving christ
[3:03:02] as savior and as your souls rest
[3:03:07] predestined to receive the soul baptism
[3:03:10] although the invitation is universal its
[3:03:13] reception is not jesus said few will
[3:03:16] find the narrow road that leads to life
[3:03:18] but scripture gives us an assurance that
[3:03:20] all of god's predestined elected and
[3:03:23] foreknown sons and daughters will
[3:03:25] receive the baptism of the holy ghost
[3:03:28] paul is the main teacher about god's
[3:03:30] foreknowledge and predestination
[3:03:32] ephesians 1 verses 4 and 5 say god chose
[3:03:35] us in him before the foundation of the
[3:03:38] world and then predestined us unto the
[3:03:40] adoption of children by jesus christ to
[3:03:43] himself
[3:03:44] imagine that before the world was
[3:03:46] founded god knew human history and chose
[3:03:49] you and his mind to be adopted into his
[3:03:51] family by jesus christ spirit god didn't
[3:03:54] force you to choose him he knew you
[3:03:56] would choose him and with that
[3:03:57] foreknowledge he predestined how and
[3:04:00] when you'd be born again by a spirit
[3:04:02] god knows all who will receive and those
[3:04:05] who will not
[3:04:06] romans 8 verses 29 and 30 provide the
[3:04:09] divine order of his own counsel for whom
[3:04:11] he did for no he did also predestinate
[3:04:14] to be conformed to the image of his son
[3:04:16] that he might be the firstborn among
[3:04:18] many brethren
[3:04:19] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[3:04:22] he also called and whom he called them
[3:04:24] he also justified and whom he justified
[3:04:27] them he also glorified
[3:04:30] god's three steps in his eternal order
[3:04:32] for salvation is foreknowledge
[3:04:35] predestination and calling
[3:04:38] the almighty begins by knowing your
[3:04:39] ultimate choice about salvation
[3:04:42] then predestinates the events of your
[3:04:43] life so you can receive his calling to
[3:04:46] the new birth
[3:04:47] he already knows you'll receive him and
[3:04:49] be baptized with his holy spirit after
[3:04:51] explaining this it seems paul is
[3:04:53] supercharged with faith because his next
[3:04:55] words are what shall we then say to
[3:04:58] these things if god before us who can be
[3:05:01] against us
[3:05:03] peter's first epistle also identifies
[3:05:05] foreknowledge as god's determining
[3:05:07] factor for salvation
[3:05:09] through eternal infinite foreknowledge
[3:05:11] the lord knows who will accept the
[3:05:13] gospel
[3:05:14] then he elects or chooses believers for
[3:05:17] his purposes
[3:05:18] first peter 1 verse 2 proclaims elect
[3:05:21] according to the foreknowledge of god
[3:05:23] the father through sanctification of the
[3:05:25] spirit unto obedience and sprinkling of
[3:05:28] the blood of jesus christ
[3:05:31] paul's letter to the galatians provides
[3:05:32] the capstone on the baptism of the holy
[3:05:35] ghost revelation
[3:05:36] galatians 4 verses 1 through 7 likens us
[3:05:40] to servants to sin until god adopted us
[3:05:43] into his family through christ's
[3:05:45] work on the cross
[3:05:47] why did we receive the baptism of the
[3:05:48] holy ghost because we already were sons
[3:05:51] in god's mind
[3:05:53] galatians 4 verse 6 declares
[3:05:56] and because ye are sons god has sent
[3:05:58] forth the spirit of his son into your
[3:06:00] hearts crying abba father
[3:06:03] god's foreknowledge before the world was
[3:06:05] founded told him you choose him so
[3:06:08] you've always been a son or daughter in
[3:06:10] his thinking even before you knew you
[3:06:12] loved god you already were his child
[3:06:16] the prodigal son parable in luke 15
[3:06:19] verses 11 through 32 perfectly expresses
[3:06:22] this thought
[3:06:24] just like the prodigal left his father's
[3:06:25] house we willingly leave righteousness
[3:06:28] and run from truth
[3:06:30] some of us run for longer than others
[3:06:32] but eventually we come to ourselves as
[3:06:34] the prodigal did amongst the swine
[3:06:36] was the prodigal any less of a son while
[3:06:39] eating the swines as husks
[3:06:41] no he was fully a son just out of
[3:06:44] position until he repented
[3:06:46] i remember the moment i came to myself
[3:06:48] and knew i could return to my heavenly
[3:06:50] father do you
[3:06:52] and i remember the feeling of the father
[3:06:54] running to receive me back into his
[3:06:56] family after the prodigal's repentance
[3:06:58] the father gave him shoes a ring and
[3:07:01] change of clothes which typed the
[3:07:02] baptism of the holy ghost the prodigal
[3:07:05] was freshly clothed or endued with power
[3:07:08] authority from his father
[3:07:10] just as jesus says his born-again child
[3:07:13] receives power from on high because the
[3:07:15] prodigal was a son the father could give
[3:07:18] him the clothes and because you're a
[3:07:19] child of god he can give you the baptism
[3:07:22] of the holy ghost despite your
[3:07:23] disgraceful past this is amazing grace
[3:07:28] knowing god's foreknowledge helps you
[3:07:30] understand scriptures that may have been
[3:07:32] perplexing but beforehand
[3:07:34] no one rebuked the unbelieving jews as
[3:07:36] much as christ when he proclaimed the
[3:07:38] devil was their father and said their
[3:07:40] converts were two-fold more children of
[3:07:42] hell than they were was jesus being
[3:07:45] unfair or partial
[3:07:46] of course not he was speaking by the
[3:07:48] foreknowledge god had made known to him
[3:07:51] about their eternal destinies for jesus
[3:07:53] said he only spoke what god showed him
[3:07:56] in john 14 verse 17 christ goes as far
[3:07:59] as saying worldly persons cannot receive
[3:08:01] the holy spirit
[3:08:02] even the spirit of truth whom the world
[3:08:05] cannot receive because it seeth him not
[3:08:07] neither knoweth him but ye know him for
[3:08:10] he dwelt with you and shall be in you
[3:08:13] jesus sheep his predestinated children
[3:08:16] will hear and obey his voice
[3:08:18] god's sheep have eternal security
[3:08:20] because god knows they will faithfully
[3:08:21] believe the goats will not believe
[3:08:24] john 10 verses 26-28 reads but ye
[3:08:28] believe not because you are not of my
[3:08:30] sheep as i said unto you my sheep hear
[3:08:33] my voice and i know them and they follow
[3:08:35] me and i give unto them eternal life and
[3:08:38] they shall never perish neither shall
[3:08:40] any man pluck them out of my hand
[3:08:44] our human perspective can only hope and
[3:08:46] wish for people to be saved and baptized
[3:08:48] with the holy ghost but god's eternal
[3:08:50] perspective allows him to foreknow all
[3:08:53] who will receive him god created time
[3:08:55] space and matter so he's outside of time
[3:08:58] limits he knows the beginning from the
[3:09:00] end
[3:09:01] having no beginning of days nor end of
[3:09:03] life
[3:09:04] in the midst of any obstacle to win
[3:09:06] souls believers must continue to finish
[3:09:08] the great commission while sharing jesus
[3:09:11] confidence that every predestinated
[3:09:13] believer will come home to the heavenly
[3:09:15] father
[3:09:16] messiah says
[3:09:18] all that the father giveth me shall come
[3:09:19] to me and him that cometh to me i will
[3:09:22] in no wise cast out
[3:09:26] the rewards for receiving the revelation
[3:09:28] of the baptism of the holy ghost
[3:09:31] outstanding rewards await those who
[3:09:32] receive the revelation of the baptism of
[3:09:34] the holy ghost both in this life and the
[3:09:37] life to come
[3:09:39] the great rewards in this life are
[3:09:40] possessing eternal life experiencing
[3:09:43] god's fellowship possessing spiritual
[3:09:45] sight
[3:09:46] manifesting the fruits of the spirit and
[3:09:48] a small remnant will escape death
[3:09:50] altogether in the rapture
[3:09:53] eternal life as a personal possession
[3:09:55] during this life serves as an anchor for
[3:09:58] your soul
[3:09:59] anchors usually ground boats to rocks
[3:10:01] below but the soul anchor lifts you
[3:10:04] upward
[3:10:05] do you know where your soul anchor
[3:10:06] catches within the holiest of holies in
[3:10:09] heaven hebrews 6 verses 19 through 20
[3:10:12] says
[3:10:13] which hope we have as an anchor for the
[3:10:15] soul
[3:10:16] both sure and steadfast and which
[3:10:18] entereth into that within the veil
[3:10:20] whither the forerunner is for us entered
[3:10:23] even jesus made in high priest forever
[3:10:26] after the order of melchizedek
[3:10:29] paul agrees saying we are seated
[3:10:31] together in heavenly places in christ
[3:10:33] jesus
[3:10:34] the eternal soul anchor
[3:10:36] again gives you assurance of eternal
[3:10:38] life
[3:10:38] since the holy ghost is eternal life
[3:10:41] called the eternal spirit in hebrews 9
[3:10:43] 14
[3:10:44] every born-again christian possesses a
[3:10:46] small portion of god's own life death is
[3:10:49] passed out of your soul in john 5 24
[3:10:52] jesus says verily verily i say unto you
[3:10:55] he that heareth my word and believeth on
[3:10:57] him that sent me hath everlasting life
[3:11:00] and shall not come into condemnation but
[3:11:03] is passed from death unto life
[3:11:06] this eternal internal assurance is
[3:11:09] available to you now but wasn't
[3:11:11] obtainable for adam noah abraham moses
[3:11:14] and the rest of the old testament saints
[3:11:18] second spirit-filled believers
[3:11:20] experience a divine partaking of
[3:11:22] christ's fellowship while living in this
[3:11:24] corrupt world
[3:11:25] through meditation prayer and worship
[3:11:28] you can know christ intimately paul was
[3:11:30] born again and said he knew christ in
[3:11:33] two ways in his resurrection power and
[3:11:36] in the fellowship of his sufferings you
[3:11:38] were dead in sins but now your soul is
[3:11:40] alive through resurrection power none
[3:11:43] but jesus walks with you during your
[3:11:44] sufferings whether you're physically or
[3:11:46] mentally persecuted these dreadful
[3:11:49] seasons may actually best manifest
[3:11:51] christ's fellowship with you
[3:11:53] as you learn to lean upon him rather
[3:11:55] than men
[3:11:57] as your fellowship increases with christ
[3:11:59] your fellowship with the world family
[3:12:01] friends and associates decreases
[3:12:04] the longer paul preached the more he was
[3:12:06] rejected by men such as the so-called
[3:12:09] believers in asia and also demas
[3:12:12] but paul had consolation christ's grace
[3:12:14] was with him throughout his sufferings
[3:12:16] and he'd receive a crown of life upon
[3:12:18] entering heaven
[3:12:21] third holy ghost-filled saints or wise
[3:12:24] virgin christians are the only group on
[3:12:26] earth that possess spiritual eyesight or
[3:12:28] understanding
[3:12:30] starting with jews and gentiles paul
[3:12:32] says most jews are blinded to the gospel
[3:12:34] in romans 11 verse 25
[3:12:37] their eyes will be opened to christ
[3:12:38] after the times of the gentiles is over
[3:12:42] moving on to the gentiles there are
[3:12:43] three types sinners foolish virgin
[3:12:46] christians and wise virgin christians
[3:12:49] second corinthians 4 verse 4 says satan
[3:12:52] has blinded the minds of them which
[3:12:53] believe not
[3:12:55] sinners minds denounce the spiritual
[3:12:57] light or knowledge of jesus's glorious
[3:13:00] gospel
[3:13:01] some might think foolish virgins have
[3:13:04] spiritual eyesight but three texts
[3:13:06] matthew 25 verse 8 john 3 verse 3 and
[3:13:10] revelation 3 verse 17 prove otherwise in
[3:13:14] matthew 25 verse 8 the lamps of the
[3:13:16] foolish virgins are gone out
[3:13:18] no fire no light
[3:13:20] this means the fullness of the holy
[3:13:22] ghost does not shine in their souls
[3:13:24] foolish virgins are saved being
[3:13:26] spiritual virgins but did not fully
[3:13:28] prepare to possess the oil of the holy
[3:13:31] ghost baptism therefore they do not
[3:13:33] fully know christ in his resurrection
[3:13:35] power and the fellowship of his
[3:13:37] sufferings
[3:13:38] god's light has shine in our hearts our
[3:13:41] souls and we have this treasure in earth
[3:13:43] and vessels
[3:13:45] true spiritual eyesight lets us see the
[3:13:47] world through god's eyes
[3:13:48] our worldview matches god's because we
[3:13:52] hate all sin choosing to love holiness
[3:13:55] obedience and righteousness
[3:13:57] jesus says you can only see or
[3:13:59] understand the kingdom of god when
[3:14:01] you're born again in john 3 verse 3.
[3:14:04] foolish virgins then cannot understand
[3:14:07] and thus cannot obey kingdom truths
[3:14:09] foolish virgins are part of the blind
[3:14:11] lukewarm group in revelation 3 verses 14
[3:14:15] through 22
[3:14:16] fluctuating between occasional love for
[3:14:18] god and love for worldly pleasures
[3:14:22] a common example of american
[3:14:24] lukewarmness in my region is church
[3:14:26] members loving both football games and
[3:14:28] their sunday worship service these
[3:14:30] foolish christians spend their entire
[3:14:32] saturday and sunday evening each weekend
[3:14:35] from september to february worshiping
[3:14:38] for six or more hours at the throne of
[3:14:40] the ohio state buckeyes and cleveland
[3:14:42] browns football teams
[3:14:44] some will even go to friday night high
[3:14:46] school football games wasting another
[3:14:48] three hours
[3:14:50] yet they will enjoy their one to two
[3:14:52] hours at their sunday morning church
[3:14:54] services
[3:14:55] their weekends are grossly lukewarm not
[3:14:58] hot or fully focused on serving jesus
[3:15:00] christ
[3:15:02] fourthly born-again christians are the
[3:15:05] only group on earth who manifest the
[3:15:07] fruits of the holy ghost
[3:15:09] jesus's the sower and the four grounds
[3:15:11] parable found in matthew 13 verses 3
[3:15:14] through 9 and verses 18 through 23
[3:15:18] reveals there are four heart reactions
[3:15:19] to hearing christ's gospel
[3:15:21] only one reaction from the honest and
[3:15:24] good heart brings forth fruit galatians
[3:15:26] 5 verses 22 through 23 lists the nine
[3:15:30] precious and rare fruits of the spirit
[3:15:32] love joy peace long-suffering gentleness
[3:15:35] goodness
[3:15:36] faith meekness temperance
[3:15:39] all other religions produce imitation
[3:15:42] fruit
[3:15:43] they promote good works but without the
[3:15:45] seed of god's word and the truths of
[3:15:47] jesus christ gospel there is no real
[3:15:50] fruit production first corinthians 13
[3:15:52] verses 1 through 3 says good works done
[3:15:55] without christ's love even giving away
[3:15:58] all your money and dying at the stake is
[3:16:00] a martyr prophet the worker nothing
[3:16:04] fifth a small remnant of holy
[3:16:06] ghost-filled christians who live until
[3:16:08] the end of the gentile church ages see
[3:16:10] chapter 7 will experience the earthly
[3:16:13] reward of escaping death their bodies
[3:16:15] will be changed swallowed up in life at
[3:16:18] the last trump and they will need no
[3:16:20] funeral
[3:16:21] christ will snatch them away in the
[3:16:23] rapture before the awful tribulation
[3:16:25] period chapter 12 fully details this
[3:16:28] earthly reward for the soul baptized
[3:16:30] saints who are privileged to live until
[3:16:32] christ's literal coming
[3:16:35] heavenly rewards are numerous as well
[3:16:38] for those receiving the privilege of
[3:16:40] obtaining the first resurrection or
[3:16:42] rapture
[3:16:43] chapter 12 details the heavenly rewards
[3:16:45] which include meeting jesus and the
[3:16:47] resurrected saints at the meeting in the
[3:16:49] air the wedding supper of the lamb and
[3:16:52] the 1000 year earthly millennial reign
[3:16:55] paul said he would press towards the
[3:16:57] mark and go to any means to attain unto
[3:17:00] the resurrection of the dead and so
[3:17:02] should we be willing to lose our lives
[3:17:04] in order to gain heaven's future rewards
[3:17:07] revelation 20 verse 6 gives two
[3:17:09] descriptions for christians who attain
[3:17:12] the first resurrection blessed and holy
[3:17:16] immediately following the millennium is
[3:17:18] the climatic white throne judgment in
[3:17:20] which every soul that ever lived will be
[3:17:22] judged by their works and either granted
[3:17:25] eternal life or cast into the lake of
[3:17:27] fire
[3:17:28] there is one special reward for the holy
[3:17:30] ghost baptized saint at this judgment
[3:17:33] sitting with christ in his throne
[3:17:35] this is the final reward spoken to the
[3:17:37] overcomer in the laodicean church age
[3:17:40] in revelation 3 verse 21
[3:17:43] to him that overcometh will i grant to
[3:17:45] sit with me in my throne even as i also
[3:17:48] overcame and sat down with my father in
[3:17:51] his throne
[3:17:53] obviously every overcomer from every age
[3:17:56] will inherit this reward based upon
[3:17:58] revelation 21 verse 7 he that overcometh
[3:18:01] shall inherit all things and i will be
[3:18:03] his god and he shall be my son
[3:18:07] muse about this reward and consider how
[3:18:09] all men and women throughout earth's
[3:18:11] history will be gathered at this second
[3:18:13] resurrection
[3:18:14] matthew 25 verses 32 and 33 describes it
[3:18:19] as all nations being gathered in one
[3:18:20] place in order to be separated into two
[3:18:23] groups the saved and the lost
[3:18:26] cain abel and nimrod will be there along
[3:18:29] with jacob and esau
[3:18:30] moses and pharaoh will be present
[3:18:33] in attendance will be famous men like
[3:18:34] goliath buddha cyrus confucius darius
[3:18:38] cicero and julius caesar
[3:18:41] men that other men esteem great like
[3:18:43] alexander the great will all stand face
[3:18:45] to face with the true great one the lord
[3:18:48] jesus christ
[3:18:50] what excuse would these men be able to
[3:18:52] make for not obeying the portion of
[3:18:54] god's truth that was available during
[3:18:56] their lifetimes
[3:18:57] if they refuse god's word there will be
[3:18:59] no excuses
[3:19:01] jesus tells us he will raise up
[3:19:02] witnesses who endured identical
[3:19:05] temptations but were overcomers first
[3:19:07] corinthians 10 verse 13 teaches our
[3:19:10] temptations are common to man or all the
[3:19:13] same therefore we are all judged by the
[3:19:15] same standard
[3:19:16] unrepentant ones who possessed great
[3:19:18] earthly power perhaps like alexander the
[3:19:21] great will not be able to plead that
[3:19:22] their temptation was too great to
[3:19:24] overcome because god will raise up moses
[3:19:27] as a witness since he overcame the
[3:19:29] temptation of riches and power in egypt
[3:19:32] hebrews 11 verses 24-27 says moses
[3:19:35] refused royal egyptian status pleasures
[3:19:39] and riches in order to be a part of
[3:19:41] god's people you can do the same
[3:19:45] matthew 12 verses 41 and 42 shows how
[3:19:48] jesus will use the men of nineveh and
[3:19:50] the queen of the south as witnesses
[3:19:52] against the unbelievers
[3:19:54] pharisees sadducees etc
[3:19:56] of his earthly ministry which lived 800
[3:19:59] and a thousand years beforehand
[3:20:01] respectively the men of nineveh are
[3:20:03] witnesses because they repented at the
[3:20:05] preaching of a lesser preacher than
[3:20:07] jesus jonah
[3:20:09] the queen of the south is a witness
[3:20:10] because she traveled a great distance to
[3:20:13] hear a less gifted man than jesus
[3:20:15] solomon
[3:20:16] you learn god only requires respect for
[3:20:18] his preaching servants in every
[3:20:20] generation
[3:20:21] respect to a lesser gift of god will
[3:20:24] witness against those who disrespected a
[3:20:26] greater gift
[3:20:28] and where will moses the men of nineveh
[3:20:30] and the queen of south be sitting at
[3:20:32] this judgment they'll be sitting with
[3:20:34] jesus on his throne as he promised in
[3:20:36] revelation 3 verse 21
[3:20:39] paul promises the same that the saints
[3:20:41] will judge the world and even angels in
[3:20:43] first corinthians six verses two and
[3:20:45] three
[3:20:46] yes if you're an overcomer you will sit
[3:20:49] by jesus and judge the very demons that
[3:20:51] tempted and attacked you
[3:20:52] second peter two verse four and jude 1
[3:20:55] verse 6 teach some fallen angels are
[3:20:57] already awaiting judgment
[3:20:59] paul describes human history as a
[3:21:01] theater or spectacle unto angels in
[3:21:04] first corinthians 4 verse 9.
[3:21:07] fallen angels watch our lives like
[3:21:08] spectators sitting in a theater and then
[3:21:11] planning carry out evil against us
[3:21:14] but through the grace of jesus christ
[3:21:16] every overcomer testifies against the
[3:21:18] demons at the great white throne
[3:21:20] judgment and becomes a spectator as the
[3:21:22] wicked angels are cast into the lake of
[3:21:25] fire
[3:21:28] the consequences for rejecting the
[3:21:30] revelation of the baptism of the holy
[3:21:32] ghost
[3:21:34] returning to jesus's sower and
[3:21:36] foregrounds parable from matthew 13
[3:21:39] there are serious consequences to the
[3:21:41] three
[3:21:42] other heart reactions that reject the
[3:21:44] revelation of the holy ghost baptism
[3:21:46] recall the four reactions to hearing
[3:21:48] christ's gospel
[3:21:50] one honest and good two thorny three
[3:21:54] stoney and four wayside
[3:21:57] this section details the consequences
[3:21:59] for the thorny stoney and wayside
[3:22:03] the thorny reaction is the foolish
[3:22:05] virgin christian
[3:22:06] who is indeed eternally saved but misses
[3:22:09] being part of the rapture and millennium
[3:22:12] because he failed to prepare oil for the
[3:22:13] bridegroom's coming
[3:22:15] in short he foolishly stopped short of
[3:22:18] his soul being sealed by the holy ghost
[3:22:21] like israel's exodus from egypt he came
[3:22:24] all the way to the jordan river or holy
[3:22:26] ghost baptism only to shrink back in
[3:22:29] unbelief
[3:22:31] the honest and good heart had fruit
[3:22:33] representing the nine fruits of the
[3:22:34] spirit but the thorny hearted believers
[3:22:37] brought forth no fruit
[3:22:39] any farmer or common house deader knows
[3:22:41] a disappointment at harvest time when
[3:22:43] there's a lack of fruitfulness
[3:22:46] they understand the painful feelings of
[3:22:47] knowing an opportunity was lost and
[3:22:50] potential wasn't reached you can begin
[3:22:52] to see god's disappointment at the lack
[3:22:55] of spiritual fruit in the foolish
[3:22:56] virgins as he is the lord of the soul
[3:22:59] harvest yet he's patient as the divine
[3:23:02] husbandman to wait for the precious
[3:23:04] fruit of the earth according to james 5
[3:23:07] verse 7.
[3:23:09] you might wonder why such harsh
[3:23:11] consequences exist to the saved thorny
[3:23:14] hard believer isaiah 35 8 holds the
[3:23:17] answer
[3:23:18] and and highway shall be there and away
[3:23:22] and it shall be called the way of
[3:23:23] holiness the unclean shall not pass over
[3:23:26] it but it shall be for those the
[3:23:28] wayfaring men though fools shall not air
[3:23:31] therein god's command for believers to
[3:23:34] walk in holiness is so simple and he's
[3:23:37] provided such great mighty weapons of
[3:23:39] warfare that only a fool would squander
[3:23:41] the once in a life opportunity to be
[3:23:44] part of the holy ghost kingdom of god so
[3:23:47] god calls them fools who fall short of
[3:23:49] the seal of god
[3:23:51] combined with this the fact that
[3:23:53] everyone is freely and repeatedly
[3:23:55] invited to receive the holy ghost
[3:23:56] baptism and it causes the foolish virgin
[3:23:59] to miss out on indescribably honorable
[3:24:02] events like the rapture the wedding
[3:24:04] supper and the millennium
[3:24:08] putting three other scriptures together
[3:24:10] you see more obvious foolish attributes
[3:24:12] of this thorny-hearted group
[3:24:14] first luke 11 13 records jesus's pledge
[3:24:18] to give the holy spirit to anyone who
[3:24:20] asks
[3:24:22] the context is god the father portrayed
[3:24:24] as a generous father who delights in
[3:24:26] giving his children gifts
[3:24:28] this shows thorny hearts do not pray
[3:24:31] enough failing to ask god for the soul
[3:24:33] baptism
[3:24:34] next matthew 5 6 says foolish virgins
[3:24:38] neglect their spiritual hunger and
[3:24:39] thirst
[3:24:40] this is true because in christ's
[3:24:42] beatitude he promised to fill those who
[3:24:44] hungered and thirsted for righteousness
[3:24:47] the fact the foolish virgins were not
[3:24:49] born again shows they neglected their
[3:24:51] souls thirst for god third ephesians 5
[3:24:55] verses 15 through 17 identifies faulty
[3:24:58] time management as an attribute of the
[3:25:01] foolish virgins because paul says the
[3:25:04] wise christians redeem their time
[3:25:06] foolish christians waste their time on
[3:25:08] frivolous cares of the world
[3:25:10] movies sports entertainments comedy
[3:25:13] riches social media and more
[3:25:16] time wasting was an attribute of the
[3:25:18] foolish virgins in matthew 5 3. they
[3:25:21] didn't plan ahead for the fact the
[3:25:22] bridegroom might tarry which he did
[3:25:25] in the spiritual sense they didn't pray
[3:25:27] seek god repent or worship enough
[3:25:30] they were invited to the rapture but
[3:25:32] didn't prepare in time jesus christ
[3:25:34] didn't have preeminence in their lives
[3:25:38] a stony heart one who temporarily
[3:25:40] believes in christ but then rejects him
[3:25:43] inherits awful consequences for
[3:25:46] devaluing the baptism of the holy ghost
[3:25:49] there are different degrees of
[3:25:50] punishment for those who once believed
[3:25:51] the gospel but left it
[3:25:54] luke 12 47 and 48 records jesus's own
[3:25:58] words you must heed
[3:25:59] and that servant which knew his lord's
[3:26:02] will and prepared not himself
[3:26:04] neither did according to his will shall
[3:26:06] be beaten with many stripes but he that
[3:26:09] knew not and did commit things worthy of
[3:26:11] stripes shall be beaten with few stripes
[3:26:14] here you learn punishment is based upon
[3:26:16] how much truth a person knew
[3:26:19] judas iscariot is the infamous example
[3:26:22] of someone who knew very much about the
[3:26:24] gospel but forfeited it
[3:26:26] he believed and served jesus for a
[3:26:28] season at least three years
[3:26:30] before betraying our messiah
[3:26:32] it would have been better for judas to
[3:26:34] have never been born compared to the
[3:26:36] woes that await him in torment
[3:26:38] no doubt he like others who serve christ
[3:26:41] but later betray him will be beaten with
[3:26:43] many stripes
[3:26:45] matthew 26 24 records jesus's words
[3:26:48] about judas's awaiting judgment the son
[3:26:51] of man goeth as it is written of him but
[3:26:54] woe unto that man by whom the son of man
[3:26:56] is betrayed
[3:26:58] it had been good for that man if he had
[3:27:00] not been born
[3:27:02] your heart sings for judas because he
[3:27:03] had the highest calling in scripture
[3:27:05] apostle
[3:27:06] and had the greatest completely
[3:27:08] blameless leader jesus christ and still
[3:27:12] forsook truth
[3:27:13] furthermore he was less than two months
[3:27:15] away from receiving the baptism of the
[3:27:17] holy ghost in the upper room in acts
[3:27:20] chapter 2.
[3:27:21] he turned his back on christ despite
[3:27:23] being so incredibly close to the
[3:27:25] spiritual promised land of the new birth
[3:27:29] finally the wayside heart one who
[3:27:31] briefly entertains believing in christ
[3:27:34] before letting satan snatch god's word
[3:27:36] from his soul
[3:27:37] also receives disgraceful dejected and
[3:27:40] sorrowful consequences
[3:27:42] many wayside hearts spitefully work
[3:27:44] against the lord jesus and purposely
[3:27:47] deceive distract tempt and destroy
[3:27:50] others
[3:27:51] they'll have degrees of damnation based
[3:27:53] upon the level of evil their souls
[3:27:55] created
[3:27:57] religious unbelievers like the scribes
[3:28:00] and pharisees of jesus day will receive
[3:28:02] the greater damnation because they
[3:28:04] blasphemed christ but also kept others
[3:28:06] from entering into god's promises
[3:28:09] any city that rejected the preaching of
[3:28:11] jesus disciples will have more intense
[3:28:14] punishment than the sodomites according
[3:28:16] to christ in luke 10 verses 1 through
[3:28:19] 12. jesus specifically names the cities
[3:28:21] of chorazin bethsaida and capernaum as
[3:28:25] having worse torment than tyree and
[3:28:28] sidon because they saw more mighty works
[3:28:31] and failed to repent
[3:28:34] conclusion
[3:28:35] christ's own words in john 7 verses 37
[3:28:39] and 39 combined with paul's declaration
[3:28:42] in colossians 1 26 that the baptism of
[3:28:45] the holy ghost was hidden from ages and
[3:28:47] generations
[3:28:49] old testament saints could only
[3:28:50] experience a limited temporary anointing
[3:28:53] of the holy ghost upon their flesh and
[3:28:54] minds but new testament saints are
[3:28:57] privileged to possess the permanent
[3:28:59] eternal seal of the holy ghost in our
[3:29:01] souls
[3:29:03] the baptism of the holy ghost revelation
[3:29:05] can hardly be overemphasized because
[3:29:07] without god's soul seal a person profits
[3:29:10] nothing
[3:29:11] first corinthians 13 verses 1 through 3
[3:29:14] says you can understand all the
[3:29:16] mysteries all 12 taught in this book and
[3:29:18] yet not have charity the baptism of the
[3:29:21] holy ghost
[3:29:22] god's presence in your soul is the
[3:29:24] relationship element of your walk with
[3:29:26] almighty god
[3:29:28] revelation without relationship profits
[3:29:30] little to nothing
[3:29:32] peter is the prime example for he
[3:29:34] possessed revelation that jesus was the
[3:29:36] christ
[3:29:37] in matthew 16 verses 16 through 17 but
[3:29:40] you know he later denied christ to a
[3:29:42] young maid three times
[3:29:44] peter received the relationship with
[3:29:46] christ the holy ghost baptism in acts
[3:29:49] chapter 2 verse 4 and was a new man
[3:29:52] afterwards being crucified upside down
[3:29:54] at the end of his life as a martyr to
[3:29:57] honor jesus
[3:29:58] relationship or oneness with christ
[3:30:01] profits your soul eternally
[3:30:03] my prayer for you is that you'll soon
[3:30:05] have a see in here experience like
[3:30:07] peter's if you haven't already
[3:30:10] now that you've received this revelation
[3:30:12] the bible makes sense and you understand
[3:30:14] the unified terminology for the baptism
[3:30:17] of the holy ghost
[3:30:18] most importantly you understand the need
[3:30:21] for all believers to understand and
[3:30:23] experience a deeper fuller experience
[3:30:26] with the holy ghost
[3:30:27] christ's blood purchased not only our
[3:30:29] forgiveness but the right for his spirit
[3:30:32] to baptize our souls into his kingdom
[3:30:35] because of his great sacrifice on the
[3:30:36] cross we are motivated to share his
[3:30:38] desire to constantly walk talk and dwell
[3:30:42] in his children's souls jesus wants more
[3:30:45] than a sinner's prayer and a speaking
[3:30:47] and unknown tongue's experience
[3:30:49] christ longs for intimate oneness with
[3:30:52] your soul
[3:30:54] action steps to the baptism of the holy
[3:30:56] ghost
[3:30:58] step number one if you haven't been
[3:31:00] baptized in the name of the lord jesus
[3:31:02] christ obey this command
[3:31:04] if you have repent thoroughly of every
[3:31:07] known sin commune with christ upon your
[3:31:09] bed or in your prayer closet and let him
[3:31:12] walk you through your mind and soul that
[3:31:14] you can see the current state of each
[3:31:18] step number two
[3:31:19] look at the seven character traits of
[3:31:21] the stature of a perfect man and ask god
[3:31:24] to add his character to your being while
[3:31:26] waiting for the new birth devote
[3:31:28] yourself to a season of prayer and
[3:31:30] worship as you wait upon the lord's
[3:31:32] timing
[3:31:34] step number three
[3:31:35] recall corneas life and imitate it in
[3:31:38] love fast pray and give alms
[3:31:42] empty yourself of selfishness and live
[3:31:44] for others
[3:31:45] then god will come and fill you
