TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] the other day I got something mixed up I happen to hear it yes I've caught it right there and it's on the tape if you happen to catch that on your tape remember look in the Bible do you see greetings friends in the mattress name of the Lord Jesus Christ this is part three of the video series called 60 plus proofs the tapes of brother Branham have mistakes yet he's a true prophet here in part three we'll cover proofs numbers 43 through 69 that the tapes of God's Prophet brother Bynum have human mistakes yet he's a true prophet of God there'll be times that I'll say 66 mistakes but while I was listening to brother Branham in my free time I found three other human mistakes so I thought I would add them to this list and perhaps at some point in the future as I compile more I'll make another video but as for now this will be the third and final part of this series number 43 is from June 63 brother Adam said quote God give me to understand I shouldn't do that because that's many of them are still his children end quote brother brand was saying God told him not to say Ricky and raquetta anymore but I want you to notice brother Graham disobeyed what God showed him and he continued saying Ricky and raquetta a few times after this for example 1965 does God ever change his mind about his word quote you'll have a bunch of regattas that's exactly right a bunch of little painted up Jezebels end quote so if you believe every word is thus saith the Lord You Have To purposely ignore the numerous times brother random used ricotta even after God told him not to number 44 is from June of 63. brother Graham said Martin Luther King Jr would lead millions in a hitler-like death trap quote just like Hitler did over in Germany LED them right into the death trap and that's exactly the same thing and remember I'm on tape you'll see it after maybe after I'm gone that's exactly what's going to happen then precious people will die down there like flies starts a revolutionary both white and colored will fight again and die like flies end quote friends this was not thus saith the Lord because brother bran was asked about it later a month later and he cares do you care well the ram said quote I have nothing on it from the Lord I could be altogether wrong in my thought about Martin Luther King I don't know I can't say that's just my opinion end quote so we see two important things here are the Rams predictions about Martin Luther King Jr beating Millions into a death trap did not come to pass because it was just a human thought a human prediction but then we also see him Clearly say that his opinions are not thus saith the Lord he said I had nothing on it from the Lord so this again proves brotherbraham's opinions were no different than anyone else's just like brother Rams said number 45 is from July 63 brother Ram said Caleb and Joshua held up Moses's hands he said quote you people here hold him up like Joshua and Caleb held up the hands of Moses end quote but of course it wasn't Caleb and Joshua it was Aaron and her in Exodus 17 verse 12. so what is the rightly divided word of truth I believe the scripture is Right Exodus 17 verse 12 and brother Graham just misquoted the scripture programs forgetful Human Side was seen just like it is seen in all of our lives in my life in everyone's life number 46 is from November 1963. brother Branham agreed with a woman's dream that predicted his death by gunshot going into a meeting he'd get out of his car and be shot by the church quote I seen them that church fixed the way is going to kill me secretly sometime when I'm getting out of my car going and be fired from but said then the spirit said not at this time but it'll come later aha end quote so again the sister's dream was not thus saith the Lord Brother Brown did not die by a gunshot right after leaving his car going in to preach a meeting we all know how brother Ram died so of course this quote is not thus saith the Lord although he agreed with his sister's dream saying aha number 47 is the last one from 1963 from November brother said quote and in this would be a woman stand up that would govern the United States not actually a woman but a church end quote so here brother Ram says the sixth major vision would not be a literal woman it would be a church but yet in 1956 brother Ram said in God's covenant with Abraham I predict this that a woman will be president before we're annihilated that's right I said that in 1933 by Vision end quote so which is right is the sixth Vision going to be a woman or a church well really none of us know it's my personal opinion it'll be a church but a lot of message preachers think it's Kamala Harris but I just bring this out to make a point not every word on tape is thus say the Lord because in one quote brother Brandon says not a woman a church but earlier he said it would be a literal woman so again both of these quotes cannot be true because they contradict themselves and time will tell and God will interpret his word the way he wants to bring it to pass as he always has done moving ahead into 1964 in February brother Ram said the church ages started in 33 A.D quote he starts from his first church age which began at 80 33 and he started the countdown end quote now friends this contradicts what brother I am taught in the church age book when he said the first church age started in 53 A.D so which one is true to me friends and my humble opinion it doesn't really matter when the church age started if you define the church as the group that had the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the church age started in 30 A.D as I believe that's the correct date of Jesus death and then the Holy Ghost falling 50 days later others think the church ages started in 53 A.D because of the church starting in Ephesus at that time so either way it doesn't matter to me the main thing is that we have the baptism of the Holy Ghost but the point I'm trying to make is that brother Reynold gave two different start dates for the church ages and both can't be right because they contradict themselves number 49 is from July 64. but the Rams said the day of atonement was more than seven sabbaths from Pentecost quote from the Feast of Pentecost to the Feast of the atonement was 50 days end quote now brother random caught this mistake and even admitted that this was a mistake on the tapes a month later and questions and answers part 164 quote like the other day I got something mixed up I happen to hear it and it's I caught it right there and it's on the tape and I I'll probably hear from it if you happen to get it or anything on that tape it should be not the seventh month after that brought in the Feast of the trumpets which meant the seven Church ages seven months not seven sabbaths but if you happen to catch that on your tape remember look in the Bible number 50 is also from July 64. quote and Jesus never referred to himself as Son of God he referred to himself always as son of man end quote so brother Brown thought Jesus never called himself the Son of God but that goes against scripture if you read John 9 35-38 and John 10 34-36 Jesus referred to himself as Son of God the red letter words in John 9 35 Dost thou believe on the Son of God and then in John 10 36 because I said I am the son of God so which is true of course the scripture is true Jesus Christ did refer to himself as the son of God number 51 is from August 64. questions answers part one quote you're a dual person three people in one soul body and spirit end quote brother Ram said this a few times that each of us were three persons like in a trial 1964 quote now see just like I am three persons end quote he even said this in things that are to be 65 quote there's three people of you end quote of course in chapter one of the church age book brother man said quote how can three persons be in one God not only is there no Bible for it but it shows even a lack of intelligent reasoning end quote so if God's not three persons and we're in the image of God we cannot be three persons so of course this is just a slip of the tongue for brother Branham when he calls himself three people it says each one of us are three persons he means three kind of relationships or three titles in one person such as a husband father and son moving ahead to 1965 this is number 52 in the seated discrepancy brother Bram said quote he never had no real real Faith he had what he thought was a faith end quote so brother Adam said Judas never had no real Faith but remember earlier in 1964 brother Braham said he had genuine justification genuine sanctification and his name was on the Lamb's Book of Life brother Graham said in one place but of course we know later brother Ram said any name on the Lamb's Book of Life cannot be blotted out so we could actually make this number 52 and 53. and questions and answers part 364 brother Rams said quote I mentioned that Judas had his name on The Book of Life now that's true end quote so brother I'm taught Judas was saved in one place and then a year later said Judas never had real Faith to begin with so what's the truth it seems from the scripture Judas did have real Faith as the Bible gives at least 13 metaphors of people who can start with faith but then be a Castaway or be Shipwrecked or be apostate and leave the faith in Matthew 13 Jesus said the seed that falls on the Stony hearted ground believes for a while endures for a while but then the time of offense transgresses against the word of God and leaves the faith so Jesus Christ himself said you can believe for a while genuinely believe but then lose your salvation and then number 53 brother Brandon said judas's name was on the Lamb's Book of Life in questions and answers part one quote was Judas iscariot's name blotted out of the Lamb's Book of Life or was it ever on it yes it was on it and was blotted out end quote but then the church age book brother Ram said quote those whose names are placed in a section of the Lamb's Book of Life and cannot be erased for their names are the names of his bride then we must accept that end quote so brother Rams said in the church age book names cannot be blotted out of the Lamb's Book of Life and the next sentence says but names can be blotted out of The Book of Life also in chapter 7 of the church age book brother Brandon said the names on the Lamb's Book of Life cannot be removed under any circumstance yet in 1964 brother random said Judas iscariot's name was removed from the Lamb's Book here's the church age Book quote quote we will also show that there is a group of people whose names having been placed on that record before the foundation of the world cannot under any circumstances have those names removed end quote and then remember in August 1964 questions and answers part one that's brother Brandon quote was Judas iscariot's name blotted out of the Lamb's Book of Life or was it ever on it yes it was on it and was blotted out end quote so here we see brother random group and his Revelation about the Lamb's Book of Life that doesn't stumble us he was human and neither of these quotes were thus saith the Lord so we appreciate the Holy Ghost guiding brother Branham into all truth number 54 is from February 65 marriage and divorce brother Ram said quote Jacob out of whom come the Patriarchs he had at least a dozen Wives end quote brother Ram claimed Jacob had at least a dozen wives but this Bible says he only had four wives so which is the rightly divided word of truth of course the Bible's right Jacob only had four wives because he promised his father-in-law Laban he would not marry any other wives and so again we see brother Ram just had a slip of the tongue or a forgetful memory regarding how many wives Jacob had number 55 is from who is this Melchizedek program said quote that's the reason Jesus note all things because he was the word before he was flesh end quote so here brother Ram said Jesus knew all things because he was a theophany before he came flesh but the Bible says Jesus didn't know all things in his Earthly human body the Bible said Jesus did not know the day or the hour Jesus said the son and Angels don't know only the Father Knows in Matthew 24 36 and also Mark 13 32. and even in this quote brother random makes it sound like theophies know all things but again that's not true angels are in theophanese and they don't know the coming of Jesus in The Rapture they don't know the day or the hour According To Jesus even the Saints who are in heaven don't know only the father knows the day and the hour so of course there is information theophanes don't know there's some information that God keeps just to himself number 56 is from April 65 brother Ram said quote the schools in Arizona where I live and 80 percent of the children in school is mentally what will their children be we can't have another generation we're at the end end quote so 57 years ago brother Ram said Arizona would not have another generation here we are if a generation is 40 years then we've already had another generation another generation in Arizona did rise up if time keeps going on there will be another generation so again this was just brother Ram's humble opinion but of course it wasn't thus saith the Lord number 57 is from September 65. brother Ram said quote you are 80 something percent of water and petroleum anyhow and you've got to take these sources in to keep you alive end quote now I mentioned this in part one but petroleum is toxic to any living thing whether it's human plant or animal there is no petroleum or diesel or gasoline or kerosene in the human body so again this just shows how brother Brown was human he was fallible he didn't know all things and of course this wasn't thus saith the Lord number 58 is from November 65 what house will you Bill me Billy Graham said quote that was the Old Testament the first four books Genesis Leviticus Deuteronomy and exodus end quote so of course brother Graham left out the fifth book The Book of Numbers because the Old Testament originally was the Torah which is five books so of course this statement was not thus saith the Lord the Torah was composed of Five Books not four books number 59 is from the Rapture and I had this in part one brother bam said the Rapture was in second Thessalonians the fourth chapter quote and the second is fulfilled in second Thessalonians the fourth chapter I would not have you ignorant Brethren concerning those asleep end quote of course there is no second Thessalonians chapter four his first Thessalonians chapter 4. number 60 is from the Rapture again December 65 where the ram said quote but nobody set before a prophet because he was he was absolutely the word of God end quote now on one hand a prophet cannot be corrected with thus saith the Lord but the human side of the Prophet can be corrected so here brother random makes it sound like a prophet can never be corrected but in 1950 brother Ram said he was corrected by Brother Sharon quote brother Shara a man corrected me on that he said brother Branham I hate to correct you on anything but said you're mistaken there he said you've caused those people for not receiving their presence and you cause them to lose their their reward he said it's more blessed to give than it is to receive end quote and brother Brown even hoped for correction in the god who's rich in Mercy 65 quote with such theologians behind me and maybe they will correct me when I'm wrong I hope so end quote so we have an example of brother brand being corrected by Brother Sharon and then hoping to be corrected by theologians so the idea that a prophet can never be corrected is wrong so if you cannot correct a profit the profit is infallible he's equal to God and if you cannot correct a prophet then Peter was not a prophet but we know he was because Paul corrected Peter in Galatians chapter 2. Peter would not have fellowship with the Gentiles because he was fearful of the Jewish teachers and so he would not eat with the Gentiles but Paul corrected him to his face and friend anyone knows Peter was a prophet he prophesied in second Peter chapter 3 about the day of the Lord and the fervent heat that would consume the Earth and even brother Branham called Peter a prophet in 1961 God being misunderstood quote then God had a prophet there who could stand up and speak Peter said you men of Jerusalem and you that dwell in Judea don't misunderstand this end quote so if you believe a prophet cannot be corrected then you're making brother Ram's own words contradict themselves because brother Rams said Peter was a prophet and yet he was corrected by Paul if you cannot correct a profit then you would have to come to the conclusion that brother Bram lied or was deceived numerous times when he said he was corrected by his wife brother Sharett and other people number 61 is from leadership 65. brother Ram said unbelievers would go into an eternal hell quote go into eternal hell that's been prepared for the devil and his angels end quote and four months before this in the thinking man's filter by the ram said quote there's no such thing as eternal hell end quote so what's the truth the truth is hell is not Eternal as brother I am taught repeatedly and of course the statement from leadership going to eternal hell that's likely a slip of the tongue number 62 is from and knoweth and not August 65. brother Ram said quote as far as I know I don't see anything to hinder at this time the coming of the Lord Jesus outside of the Readiness of his church end quote so brother Adam saw nothing to hinder the coming of the Lord outside of the Readiness of the church but yet we know there's numerous Old Testament scriptures that still need to be fulfilled in relation to Israel there's many Jews still returning to Israel at this time such as Jews who are living in Ethiopia returning to Israel just within the last few months brother Ram thought just the Readiness of the church was keeping the coming of the Lord but there's also other scriptures like the return of the Jews that need to be fulfilled as well moving into the church age book number 63 this was likely Lee vale's mistake but he quoted the wrong scripture quote her Zeo has literally been that of the Jews John 2 verse 17 the Zeal of thine house hath eat me up but it is a wrong Zeal end quote John 2 17 is not about the Jews it's about Jesus Christ Jesus Christ had Zeal for the house of the Lord which is why he cleaned it out on two occasions at the beginning of his ministry and the end of his ministry so it seems like levale as Eder the church age book put the wrong scripture in the church age book the Jews had Zeal for their own man-made Creeds or their own traditions of man as Jesus said in Matthew chapter 15 and those Creeds were of none effect historians say they had the mishnah which was their own interpretation of the Torah and remember friends brother random was excited about and supported the printing of the church age book and it was printed during his lifetime less than a month before he passed away and he hoped many people would read it and I do believe there are wonderful truths within the church age book but this shows a wrong scripture quoted number 64 is also from the church age book a wrong scripture is referenced quote in Revelation 14 the Beast that was wounded unto death but lived again is Imperial Pagan Rome end quote if anyone reads Revelation chapter 14 it doesn't talk about the Beast so again Lee Vale probably wrote the wrong chapter it's Revelation 13 Verse 3 and I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death and his deadly wound was healed end quote so again not every word in the church age book was thus saith the Lord as Branham Tabernacle declares number 65 in the church age book Brother Anderson quote you want to know if I believe in the doctrine of pre-existence I don't believe in that Mormon doctrine of the pre-existence of souls any more than I believe in reincarnation or the transmigration of souls end quote so here brother Ram says he does not believe in the pre-existence of Souls which means we could not have been the sons of God that shouted for Joy at the foundation of the world because if we were then we would already had pre-existed outside of the mind of God but the Bible says in Ephesians 1 we were chosen in Christ before the foundational World chosen in the mind of God now twice brother Graham said we were the sons of God shouting for Joy spoken of in the Book of Job but again those had to be angels as sons of God they could not have been Believers such as us because we did not pre-exist before coming from the mind of God to flesh and brother man said that in 1955 beginning in any of the Gentile dispensation quote see we come out of Eternity we was before there was a world did you know that the morning Stars shouted for Joy them singing them shining one shouted for Joy when they seen that someday they were Tabernacle they were tabernacled here on Earth end quote and again in 1958 he said that we were the sons of God shouting for joy in the serpent seed quote who is this job 27 38 when the morning Stars sang together and the sons of God shouted for Joy we're not creatures of time we're creatures of Eternity end quote also this quote about the pre-existence of souls means that brother random could not have been the angel ministering to John the Divine as he wrote the Book of Revelation which Branham Tabernacle falsely teaches if they believe brother Branham was that angel that talked to John then they have to deny this quote we did not have a pre-existence of souls before we came to this earth brother random said we bypassed our theophany and went from thought to flesh and brother Adam said this and who is this Melchizedek 1965 quote and then you see you come right down the regular line but you bypassed the theophany and became flesh man to be tempted by sin end quote number 66 from the church age book brother Branham said this generation will not pass until all will be fulfilled in Matthew chapter 24. if a generation is 40 years friends then it's now been 57 years since the church age book was published and not all of Matthew 24 has come to pass if a generation is 40 years quote Matthew 24 mentions signs in the heavens concerning this last day just before Jesus comes and when he the pope went to Jerusalem the moon or the church went to total darkness this is it this is the end this generation shall not pass away until all be fulfilled even so Lord Jesus come quickly end quote number 67 brother Brandon said Enoch served God for 500 years in the leadership sermon 1965 quote look at Enoch he walked with God for 500 years and then he had a testimony that he pleased God end quote friends Genesis 5 23 says in all the days of Enoch were 360 in five years so what is the rightly divided truth did Enoch walk with God 500 or 365 years I believe the scripture is the truth so I believe Enoch walked 365 years with God and when brother Branham said 500 years it was just brother Ram's Human Side being forgetful number 68 is about when names were written on the Lamb's Book of Life brother Brandon said in 1955 the sermon Fellowship that right now names are being written on the Lamb's Book of Life quote oh God I thank thee that in glory right now names are being written down in the Lamb's Book of Life keep them O Father into thy Grace end quote and of course numerous times after this brother Randolph said the names written on the Lamb's Book of Life were written before the foundation of the world and not in real time when Believers were getting saved one example is from two years later and Sir as we would see Jesus 1957 brother Ram said quote the poet used to sing the song We sang it many times in Baptist Church there is a new name written down in glory tonight you know someone wrote Oh my name was wrote In The Book of Life Tonight the poet was fine by saying that and it's led many souls to Christ but how wrong he was the Bible said that our names were written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world when was it when the lamb was slain every person that was ever to be saved was associated with a lamb in the slang before the foundation of the world end quote so which is the rightly divided word of truth I believe the latter quote is scripturally accurate all the names are written on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world but friends there's also a truth that God does write down names in a book of remembrance according to the scriptures according to Malachi 3 verse 16 the Bible said those that fear the lord spake often one to another and the Lord hearken and heard it in a book of remembrance was written before him for them that fear the lord and that thought upon his name so there is some book in heaven that is currently writing down the names of those that fear the lord and talk about him in real time but as far as the Lamb's Book of Life is concerned it seems all those names are written before the foundation of the world according to Revelation 13 verse 8 and all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the book of the life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world and lastly number 69 brother Brandon believed he'd have a part in getting Israel back to the Lord Jesus before he died this is from Gabriel's instructions to Daniel 1961 brother Ram said quote the reason I've always believed before my class here that there was something that I'd have apart before I die of getting Israel back to the Lord because when the very hour by the Pan-American chart that Israel was declared a nation for the first time for 2 000 years since they've been scattered not a people it was that very same hour exactly to the hour that the angel Lord met me up yonder and sent me to the with the gospel the very same thing May the 7th 1946 end quote here it seems brother random believed he would have a part through his prophetic gift interning the blinded Israel back to the Lord Jesus Christ in other quotes he believed that as well that Israel needed to see a prophet and brother Branham had a prophetic gift and brother Graham believe in this quote that he would help turn blinded Israel back to Christ before he died but of course this was just his own human thought his own human desire his love for all people but especially Israel with his human desire he hoped he could use his prophetic gift to open the blinded eyes of Israel and turn them to Jesus Christ but of course we know this did not happen before brother random died in 1965. Israel still blinded today and it seems the blindness will only be removed after Jesus is finished saving every Gentile Soul according to Luke 21 verse 24 Jesus said Jerusalem will be trodden down until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled a plea and prayer for tape worshipers to repent friends the reason I made this long list of 66 proofs the tapes have honest human mistakes of brother Branham was to try to plead with tape worshipers to not say every word on tape is thus saith the Lord anyone who believes that is either completely ignorant or completely insane because if you cannot recognize truth then you have been Anointed with a spirit of delusion now of course it's also possible some of these people in the tape Church movement are saved but if that's the case they have an awful sinful complex of Pride and the spirit of idolatry worshiping the tapes exalting every word to infallibility saying every word is thus saith the Lord so my plea is friends in the Tate Church movement be honest before God humble yourself look at these 66 clear simple examples that there are contradictions on the tapes of brother Branham he was a man he was human he even admitted numerous times to making mistakes on the tapes and said he did it all the time of course when he said thus saith the Lord there was no mistake in that but of course not every statement on tape is thus said the Lord let's have a prayer friends for all these people who are worshiping the tapes father God in humility Lord God we just ask God that this video and the facts and truths on this video could be used to help these tape worshipers repent of their idolatry whether they're ignorant of it or whether they're aware of it Lord only you can bring them to repentance Dear God and the scripture says the goodness of God leads them to repentance so Lord let your goodness and your spirit of Truth speak to them again today whenever they'll watch this and may they humble themselves and stop saying that every word on the tape is thus saith the Lord Lord we know all the elect will receive this Truth for the elect cannot be deceived into saying every word brother Ram said was thus saith the Lord so we thank you for your grace and mercy Lord I pray you hear our humble prayer save what you can dear God by your grace and mercy deliver these people from their complexes and if they're not saved may they repent of their Spirit of idolatry and get saved through the blood of Jesus Christ we thank you for your mercy in Jesus Christ's name amen in closing friends I hope this exhaustive list of 66 proofs that there were mistakes on the tapes was a blessing to you and again I believe brother Branham was a genuine prophet of God I preached his Bible revelations since 2004. so I preached 18 years 16 years as a pastor promoting the Bible revelations that God gave to brother Branham and they've literally transformed my life but again our prayer is that this video will help people be delivered from the lie that every word on brother Ram's tapes was thus saith the Lord if you feel out of the Holy Spirit please share this with people so they can be set free from that bondage if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
