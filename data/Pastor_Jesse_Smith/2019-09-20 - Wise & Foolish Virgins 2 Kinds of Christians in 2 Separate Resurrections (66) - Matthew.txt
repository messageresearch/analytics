Description:
In Matthew 25:1-3, the Lord Jesus Christ teaches there are two kinds of Christians: wise and foolish. 

The wise virgins are those with the "oil" of the baptism of the Holy Ghost, or seal in their souls. Wise virgin Christians redeem the time for the kingdom of God.

Foolish virgins are those who serve God and live free from idolatry but never fully obey and receive the born again experience.

There has always been two kinds of genuine believers: Enoch and Noah, Abraham and Lot, David and Saul, Jesus' disciples and the saved thief on the cross, to name a few. 

The first resurrection is the rapture and only the Holy Ghost filled, wise virgins will be a part of this. The wise virgins will enjoy the marriage supper of the Lamb and then rule and reign with Christ during the 1,000 year Millennium. 

The second resurrection is when the foolish virgins and all other humans will appear at the White Throne Judgment. 

Please contact me with any questions, testimonies, or concerns.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to share Jesus's teaching about the two kinds of Christians that he calls wise and foolish virgins hopefully each viewer can see which type of spiritual virgin you are and if you are not yet a wise virgin or Holy Ghost filled Christian you will soon become one these two different kinds of Christians wise and foolish virgins will raise in two different resurrections the first and second resurrections as fully taught in Scripture here's a quick summary before I share a detailed teaching the wise virgins are those with the baptism of the Holy Ghost in their souls beginning with the New Testament Saints on the day of Pentecost and continuing to today's living Saints the dead in Christ will raise first in the first resurrection which is the rapture and then the living Saints will have a body change and meet Christ and the dead in Christ in the air the rapture is an imminent future event that will take place at an unknown day or hour although Paul says we will know the times and seasons revelation 20 verses 4 and 5 says the first resurrection is the resurrection to live and reign with Christ on the earth for 1,000 years of peace all the rest of the world including the foolish virgin Christians who were never born again of the Holy Ghost in their souls along with all the sinners will miss the rapture or first resurrection and die in the tribulation period they will not live again until after the glorious 1000 year millennial reign being raised at the second resurrection with all the foolish virgins and sinners who died before the rapture over the past 2,000 years when all in the graves will hear Jesus's voice and come forward to the white throne judgment Jesus calls the second resurrection the resurrection of life or of damnation this is fully proven by Scripture let's begin with this wise and foolish Christians Jesus teaches this truth in Matthew 25 verses 1 to 13 Jesus's parable says the kingdom of heaven is like 10 virgins that take their lamps and go out to meet the bridegroom the wise took extra oil and vessels in case the bridegroom would tarry which he did so they would not run out but the foolish virgin took no extra oil the foolish only had oil burning in their lamps the Virgin's fall asleep while waiting for him but both are awakened by a midnight cry both virgins trimmed their lamps or removed the charred portion of their wicks to ensure their lamps are brightly burning the foolish realized they are out of oil so they asked the wise for oil but the wise say they cannot share while the Fouch leave to go buy oil the bridegroom comes and only the wise virgins go into the marriage the foolish returned and tried to enter the marriage but the bridegroom says no he does not know them jesus' final words are watch therefore for you know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh the parable symbols are apparent symbols the bridegroom represents Jesus Christ returning for his New Testament church or bride at the rapture 3 scriptures refer to Christ as a bridegroom and husband who will soon be married to the New Testament Holy Ghost filled Church John 329 Ephesians 5:23 232 and revelation 19 verses 7 through 9 the bridegroom's delay represents the last 2000 years Jesus has been raining on God's right hand in heaven the marriage event symbolizes the rapture and marriage supper to the lamb as seen in Revelation 19 verse 9 and he saith unto me write blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb and he saith unto me these are the true sayings of God the rapture is an intimate event and could happen any day or hour and is the first resurrection because Paul says the dead in Christ will rise first and we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds more on the first resurrection a bit later the term virgins represents new testament christians who have no spiritual intercourse with idols since natural virgins no sexual intercourse New Testament virgin Christians do not worship Hollywood professional athletes famous musicians nor do they make money houses or possessions idols Paul says genuine Christians are chaste virgins to Christ in 2nd Corinthians 11 verses 2 & 3 the wise virgins who had oil represent Christians who are born again by the baptism of the Holy Ghost this is the sea of the Holy Ghost in the soul of man as man has three parts to his being according to 1st Thessalonians 5 verse 23 this is the Holy Ghost baptism jesus describes in acts 1 verse 5 saying for John truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence Jesus also taught that the New Testament Holy Ghost baptism in the soul was unavailable to Old Testament believers and came on the day of Pentecost in John 7 verses 37 to 39 in the last day that great day of the feast Jesus stood and cried saying if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink he that believeth on me as the scripture hath said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water but this spake he of the Spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because that Jesus was not yet glorified John 20 verse 22 and when he had said this he breathed on them and saith unto them receive ye the Holy Ghost this means Old Testament Saints like Abraham Sarah Isaac Rebecca David and Solomon were not born again in their souls which in the case of David explains why he could slay Goliath and write Scripture by the Holy Ghost being in his human spirit or mind but later commits wicked acts like adultery and murder David did not have the power of the seal of the Holy Ghost in his soul today the Holy Ghost baptized Christian is kept from committing adultery and murdering by the seal or abiding presence of Christ Lord willing a separate future video will be focused on this subject oil symbolizes the Holy Ghost according to Zechariah chapter 4 says the golden oil that emptied out of the two olive trees into the seven candlesticks is God's Spirit not by might not by power but by my spirit saith the Lord of Hosts Paul also describes wise Christians as those who redeem the time fully understanding God's will for their lives the foolish virgins believe in Jesus living a life free from idolatry or making love to the world but failed to use their time wisely for the kingdom of God foolish virgins do not understand God's will because they do not seek God to know it God promises to give the Holy Ghost to them that obey Him according to acts 5:32 and those that ask for the Holy Ghost according to Luke 11:13 so the foolish virgin does not devote special time to obeying God's invitation to seek Him they have a partial hunger and thirst but not a full hunger and thirst for righteousness because God would fill them if they did it is crucial to see that Jesus invites all to be born again we already read John 7 verses 37 to 39 where Jesus said if any man thirst notice now Revelation chapter 22 verse 17 and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that heareth come and let him that is athirst come and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely there has always been a wise and foolish virgin in every age including during the Old Testament in the first 2,000 years of world history Enoch represented the wise virgin and Noah represented the foolish virgin Enoch the seventh from Adam walked with God until God took him off the earth Enoch the seventh from Adam typed the Holy Ghost filled believers in the seventh church age the Laodicean Church age who will not die being the Saints who are alive and remain and go in a rapture no represents the foolish version of his time being born about seven years after Enochs rapture while noah found grace in the sight of the lord and was a preacher of righteousness his life still did not match Enochs obedience as evidenced by his drunkenness after the floodwaters receded in the days of Abraham Abraham represented the wise virgin and lot represented the foolish virgin Abraham is the wise virgin because he lived completely separate from Sodom and Gomorrah God knew Abraham would command his children and household to keep the way of the Lord doing justice and judgment lot represents the foolish virgin because the riches and prestige of Sodom and Gomorrah attracted him and his family lot was righteous but was also daily vexed by the wickedness he saw and heard in Sodom and he was guilty of putting himself and his family in this position in David's time David represented the wise virgin while saw represented the foolish virgin David was the wise Virgin of his day because God saw him as a man after his own heart scripture records faithful David as only disobeying God in one event his adultery with Bathsheba and murder of Uriah saw as the foolish virgin of his day the prophet Samuel assured us Saul was saved not going to hell but Saul wasted much of his life disobeying God and harboring a murdering spirit against David God took his mercy away from Saul and Samuel said David was better at obeying God because his heart was after God's heart in the days of Jesus Jesus and His disciples were the wise virgins the saved thief on the cross and perhaps gamellia and Nicodemus were the foolish version of their day Jesus disciples left everything they had in order to follow Christ completely redeeming the time the saved thief repented on the cross and Jesus promised him he would be with him in paradise the very same day gamellia and Nicodemus were most likely saved because they were a help and served the people of God in times of trouble at the time of Jesus's resurrection we saw more proof of wise and foolish virgins even in the Old Testament according to Matthew 27 verses 52 and 53 many of the Old Testament Saints raised from the dead after Jesus's resurrection but not all the prove some were rewarded above others because of their love and obedience for the Lord God the wise versions of the Old Testament raised with Jesus at his resurrection while the foolish remain in the grave to finish the ten virgins parable the midnight cry is the shout of first Thessalonians 4:16 the first part of the rapture preceding the voice and the Trump there's only one Christian ministry that awakened an entire generation here at the end time and history validates the ministry of brother William Branham as the awakening ministry that occurred during the 1940s 50s and 60s randoms message of restoration is fully scriptural as taught in acts 3 21 Matthew 17 11 Luke 17 30 revelation 10 1 2 7 and Malachi 4 verses 5 & 6 those wise virgins who had the baptism of the Holy Ghost will go into the rapture with Christ for he is the bridegroom when the foolish virgin came to knock on the bridegroom's door Jesus did not let them in the door to the rapture was closed Jesus urges Christians to be ready watching for the rapture the two resurrections scripture proves that there are two future resurrections and every person will be a part of one or the other the first resurrection which is the rapture 1st Thessalonians 4 verses 13 to 18 says the dead in Christ will rise first and then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord this means the Saints will be with Christ during the 1,000 year millennial reign revelation 20 verses 4 to 6 is a portion of Scripture that names the rapture as the first resurrection and details the Millennium it is a time when the Saints rule and reign with Christ because they overcame the beast or Rome or Roman Catholic Church verse 5 provides a shocking matru fact that the rest of the Dead lived not again until the 1,000 years are finished the Millennium is not for everyone it's only for the Holy Ghost filled Saints or wise virgins John 5:24 and 25 records Jesus declaring that some believers already have eternal life saying half everlasting life when fully believing John 5:24 and 25 verily verily I say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from death unto life verily verily I say unto you the hour is coming and now is when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God and they that hear shall live wise virgins already have eternal life the oil or the baptism of the Holy Ghost notice the Holy Ghost field Saints will not come into condemnation Romans 8:33 says who shall lay any charge to God's elect Romans 8:1 says there is no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus first John 5 verses 13 and 20 supports this as well saying true believers already have eternal life these things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the son of God that you may know that you have eternal life and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God and we know that the Son of God has come and has given us an understanding that we may know him that is true and we are in him that is true even in his son Jesus Christ this is the true God and eternal life but the foolish virgins do not receive eternal life until the white throne judgment as oil represents eternal life or the baptism of the Holy Ghost Matthew 25 verse 46 says the foolish virgins go to eternal life but holy ghost field Saints already have it on this earth and these go away into everlasting punishment but the righteous into life eternal note that God loves the foolish virgin too so much that he calls them blessed of his father although foolish and avoiding the baptism of the Holy Ghost during their lifetimes God still honors them for their pure Christian lives not committing adultery with Hollywood sports love of money and so forth Matthew 25:34 then shall the King say unto them on his right hand come you blessed it on my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world the fish CEO of Revelation 6 verses 9 to 11 also proves eternal life is not possessed by everyone on earth as this seal shows faithful Jews who only have the testimony of the Word of God and not the testimony of Jesus for they cry out for revenge white robes or eternal life are given unto them which has to take place at the white throne judgment or second resurrection the second resurrection this is the resurrection of souls to come to the white throne judgment also called the resurrection unto life and the resurrection unto condemnation in John 5 verses 28 to 29 according to Jesus Christ himself Marvel not at this for the hours coming in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice and shall come forth they that have done good unto the resurrection of life and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of damnation revelation 20 verses 11 through 15 also details the white throne judgment where the sea gives up their dead and death and hell deliver every one to the white throne to be judged by their works the save go into eternal life but those whose names are missing from the book of life go into the second death or the lake of fire in closing may you y-z redeem your time and seek the baptism of the holy ghost getting prepared with extra oil for the coming bridegroom please contact me if you have any questions or concerns or testimonies regarding this video god bless you and may Jesus Christ be to the zyre of your heart
