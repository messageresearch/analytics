TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] I'm not sinless I got plenty hanging on me but every hour I confess it constantly I going on the merits of the blood of Jesus Christ he died for me greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to react to a recent video I saw about Derek Prince and his comments on God's Prophet brother William brandham hi friends I'm Jesse Smith pastor Christ Fellowship here in akan Ohio USA and I defend the original Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ that he revealed to St Paul and then restored through Martin Luther John Wesley and the late Prophet brother William brandham 1909 to 1965 and also defend brother bram's Godly Christian character and that's what this video is about by the grace of God I'm going to begin this video by sharing a clip from a video I saw of Dereck Prince Derek Prince was a Pentecostal Bible teacher lived from 1915 to 2003 I've viewed some of his sermons uh they were blessing the ones on fasting and praying and the teaching on blessings and curses was a real blessing to me he used a lot of Bible scripture that was helpful to me one major difference I have with Derek Prince was the fact that tongues were the culmination or he called him the Seal of the baptism of the Holy Spirit his personal website shares his belief on tongues as the evidence or culmination of the baptism here's a screenshot shot he said quote the distinctive seal of the baptism in the Holy Spirit is speaking in tongues some call it the evidence actually I prefer myself to call the culmination of the baptism I have a video about the five or six reasons why tongues are not the evidence of the baptism of the Holy Ghost as both the Bible and God's Prophet brother brandham plainly teach so let's get to this video now I saw recently of Dereck Prince I personally believe Dereck Prince erroneously says brother brandom was led by two different Spirits I've listened to Brother brandham since 2001 late 2001 so almost 22 years and I've never heard a more Bible centered preacher I've never heard a more humble Preacher Brother BR was a true Holy Ghost filled Saint a humble man of God a genuine prophet of God as all my videos and sermons show by the grace of God but after watching this video it made me think of two questions so I like some input from the Saints again this is sort of a different video a reaction video first is Derek Prince referring to Gordon Lindsay and then number two if so what were the specific reasons Lindsay separated from brother brandham in Lindsay's own words so here's the clip I found it on the torn curtain by Joshua Simone YouTube channel I don't follow this man and he's against brother brandham so I don't support him at all but his video came up and it mentioned brother brandham so I watched it here's the video and I'm going to say something which in a way is painful but I I've prayed much about this I think God wants me to say it Pentecost hostals of whom I am one have a kind of awe of William Branham how many of you have heard of William Branham that's most of you well William Branham was a man of God with a most remarkable and dramatic gift from God but I happen to have been friends with a Bible teacher whose name I will not give who worked very closely with William Branham for several years and he gave us once a personal sharing and he said I had to come to the conclusion that there were two Spirits in William Brandon one was the spirit of God and one was not and you see the sad thing is and I say this with real sadness in spite of His Marvelous gifts and the way God used him his end was either pathetic or tragic according to how you view it he was killed as a result of a motor accident in which his car was struck by a drunk driver and he left behind a little group of Fanatics who were worshippers of William brandham and who are some of the saddest people you'll ever meet in a Christian Association why did that happen because if you mix two spirits and don't eliminate the wrong one ultimately it will corrupt the work of the good one okay so the first thing I want to say is I'm thankful that Derek Prince recognized powerful gift of God that brother brandham had of course commissioned by an Angel in 1946 we're thankful for that so I appreciate Derek Prince recognizing that second notice Derrick Prince did not not have this knowledge firsthand he took someone else's word about brother brandham so to me that's a big mistake drik Prince made and of course maybe he wasn't even around to get to meet brother brandom I don't know it seems like most likely they never crossed paths but that leads me into the question can someone please tell me if indeed Derek Prince is referring to Gordon Lindsay and then perhaps give me some proof of that I don't know maybe there's videos out there of Derrik Prince talking about his relationship with Gordon Lindsay if so please share them with me maybe I'll make a part two to follow up on this video the next point is that Derek Prince seems to believe this friend who said brother bandam had two Spirits in him based upon the fact that brother Ram died by a car accident to me that's a very weak argument friends all of us know some people some really Godly Saints who died in accidents whether plane accidents car accidents I think it's really immature to judge someone by the way that they die even Elisha died from a disease in 2 Kings 13:14 Elisha had twice as many miracles as Elijah but God let him die on a sick bed with a disease that doesn't make Elisha less of a man of God just like all the people we know that have died tragically in car accidents and plane accidents maybe motorcycle accidents that's not always a sign of God's judgment or displeasure with a person I think the right approach is to look at how they live their life for example David the man after God's Own Heart seems like he died in peace but look what he did during his life he committed adultery murdered numbered the people there was numerous mistakes David made that were awful mistakes but he died in peace now contrast that with brother Brenham brother Brenham was a prophet of God finished the mysteries of God prophesied correctly over six times in the name of the Lord he died tragically we'd say but he never committed adultery he never murdered so what would you rather have if you had the choice between those two lives one life you die peacefully but you commit awful sins another life you live righteously then you have a tragic death so I believe it's wise to focus on how a person lived and not so much how a person died the next point is that Derek Prince says brother brandom left behind a very small group of people that worshiped him I think this is a misleading statement there were many many people that followed brother brandham and his bible-based teachings that were left behind after brother bram's death it's true there was a small group that worshiped him they still worship him today at brandham Tabernacle that's not the majority of people people and even though some preachers that were around brother brandham went into awful sins that's because the Bible says few there be that find the narrow road that leads to life remember Jesus had 70 men who left him 70 preachers left Jesus so the majority of the preachers Around Jesus left him and the minority stayed true to him same thing is true in every age Paul said all in Asia have forsaken me so that means very few stayed with St Paul same thing we see with brother brandham very few stayed with brother bram's Bible teachings this helps us to to see again that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever Hebrews 13:8 and again brother Bram did not mix two Spirits that's a ridiculous statement for Derek Prince to make that would put brother brandom on the level of balum and that's not true brother Bram was a genuine prophet of God brother BR constantly preached the word of God he was constantly repenting of his sins he said I confess my sins every day every hour he was constantly pleading for the grace of God to be on his life again the most faithful Bible preacher I've ever heard the most humble Bible preacher I've ever heard as even my own Ministry has has been most impacted by the ministry of God's Prophet brother William brandham the last thing I want to show is what seems to be some evidences of why Gordon Lindsay left brother brandham there's a website called prophetic Revelation and I don't agree with many things this man says but he does seem to have real letters from Gordon Lindsay and his wife Freda Lindsay so I want to show those now so in this first letter this is from Freda Lindsay Gordon Lindsay's wife and it seems she disagreed with Brother brandom on the Lord Jesus Christ water baptism so this is not Gordon Lindsay's statement it's his wife's statement so I don't know if there's a disagreement between Gordon Lindsay and his wife on the correct water baptism but it seems from this letter that Mrs Lindsay disagreed with the Lord Jesus Christ baptism that would mean she was a trinitarian and of course trinitarianism is of the devil it adds to the Bible thus sayith the Lord God's Prophet brother Braham told us that now here's a letter that seems to be from Gordon Lindsay and there's three statements Lindsay makes about his disagreements with brother brandham first he disagreed brother brandham was anointed with the spirit of Elijah now I have videos that plainly teach that brother brandham was anointed with the spirit of Elijah undoubtedly he has the five or six characteristics of the spirit of Elijah second it seems Gordon Lindsay didn't believe brother Ram was a messenger of the Covenant as a forerunner but of course I believe in many many people believe he was according to Malachi 4:5 and6 and Revelation 10 1-7 Christ The Mighty angel came down with a rainbow that represents a covenant John the Baptist was a messenger a forerunner of the Covenant to the first coming of Christ and we believe that's what brother Ram did he was a messenger restoring the Covenant finishing the mystery of God restoring the hearts of the people back to the Covenant of the original Apostolic fathers the Pentecostal fathers Paul James Peter and all the Bible authors then thirdly seems Gordon Lindsay said brother Ram had other doctrines and others around him greatly hindered him so of course I disagree with that I don't think anybody hindered brother brandham I think brother Bram was like any other man his own mistakes may have hindered him a little but truly God got the glory and brother Ram's Ministry he finished the mysteries of God he turned our hearts back to the apostolic fathers preached the seven Church ages revealed the Seven Seals with thus say the Lord with 38 differences from Clarence Larin and Charles T Russell gave us thus say the Lord on marriage divorce through the revelation of the Holy Spirit made the Bible a brand new Bible in closing friends I look forward to getting your comments or you can email me with any other Insight you have on why Gordon Lindsay might have separated himself from brother brandham it's always interesting to see people who lived around the time of brother brandham what they thought of him so here we see Derek Prince and no doubt even Gordon Lindsay he wrote a man sent from God he wrote that book they recognized a mighty gift of the Holy Ghost in brother bram's life but it seems they disagreed on Doctrine and were turned away by those who had heirs around the ministry of brother brandham like those that worship brother brandham brother Bram tried to rebuke those people of course we know that in 1961 he dealt with that even left the ministry for a little while until those people repented but of course that Spirit didn't die it anointed other people and it's still alive today but brother R's Focus was truly on the Lord Jesus Christ undoubtedly brother BR never glorified himself never magnified himself he humbly served the Lord Jesus Christ until the day God took him home so perhaps we'll have a second part on this we'll see by God's grace I remain so thankful to God for sending his Prophet brother William brandham his ministry from the Bible has transformed my life transformed the Bible to me I've met two people that new brother brandham Tom Brown and sister Florence Humes both have passed away they spoke very highly of brother brandham and to them God showed to them that undoubtedly brother Brown was a genuine prophet of God no doubt about it so we're thankful for God's prophet we're thankful for God's mercy to us we Rejoice that God has finished the mystery of God in this day and we're eating the book by the grace of God if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
