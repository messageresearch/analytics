TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] the Antichrist refuses the true bride Doctrine and therefore he takes his own bride now and builds her up under a Creed of his own and a genuine Faith Of God will believe in God and God is the word it'll never add nothing to [Music] it greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to record a part two of our podcast series on Bible versions and here in part two we're going to discuss five message doctrines that are attacked and changed by other Bible versions other than the King James version specifically the Amplified and NIV versions hi friends I'm Jesse Smith pastor bride of Christ Fellowship here in akan Ohio USA and I defend the original Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ that he revealed to St Paul then had to restore through Martin Luther John Wesley and the late Prophet William brandham who lived from 1909 to 1965 and also defend brother Ram's Godly Christian character I want to briefly review part one of our podcast series on Bible versions We Looked at brother Cam's testimony and his awareness of how the NIV deleted verses out of the King James Bible brother cam showed how Satan's been twisting scripture from the Garden of Eden and then also in Jeremiah 8:8 Satan was twisting or changing scripture in the days of Jeremiah and we know the Pharisees were adding traditions of men in Matthew chapter 15 then of course revelation 22 said people would take away and add to the word of God and awful repercussions would be given to them and a genuine Faith Of God will believe in God and God is the word it'll never add nothing to it the Bible tells us if we add one word or take one word away our part will be taken from The Book of Life Revelations 22:18 the last closing chapter in The First beginning the first book of the Bible God told them not to break one word of that every word must be kept they must live by that word Jesus in the middle of the book come along and said that in his age and said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that in it comes out of the mouth of God and in the closing age of Revelations for told to us that whosoever shall take one word out of the book or add one word to it his part will be taken from the book of life we saw the trend that some message churches and of course many other churches are no longer using the King James version only a sad Trend then we saw there's only two families of manuscripts that all bibles are translated from of course the King James used the Texas receptus from the bisane family all other Bible translations use the false westcot and Hort texts the West Scott and Hort manuscripts then we saw there's over 30,000 changes in the West Scott and Hort manuscripts but thankfully God promised to preserve his pure words in Psalm 12: 6 and 7 then brother cam brought up a great Point how one of the goals of the Counter Reformation is to change the Bible which they're doing but true believers will not change the truth of God's word they'll use the true translation the King James version then we finished by showing all recent revivals use the King James version of the Bible and that's the version God's Prophet brother brandom used for his restoration Ministry to finish the mystery of God according to Revelation 10:7 so here in part two of the podcast I believe you'll be blessed by the grace of God the focus of part two will be to show that the false Bible versions have attacked and changed at least five message doctrines that's what we're going to cover in this podcast hopefully in the next recording we'll do more examples but brother cam has studied and found that five message doctrines are being attacked the first is we must live by every word of God according to Matthew 4:4 second is they're attacking Revelation 10:7 Third they're attacking or changing the serpent seed fourth they're attacking the believer's equality with God how the Holy Ghost is in the soul of the believer and Fifth and finally they're attacking men and women's hair links from 1 Corinthians 11 1-16 now I want to play a striking statement brother Cam said in part one brother Cam said we can lay two Bible versions side by side and see if the new versions affect what a god-sent seventh angel William brandham gave us it was a striking beautiful statement the Holy Spirit Led brother cam to say why would we want to take a new Bible version that changes what the seventh Church age messenger gave us from the original word of God the truth is we wouldn't want to use a Bible version that changes the seven Church age messenger gave to us by the grace of God of course what he gave to us brother Ram gave to us was already in the scripture why would messageer Believers today want to use a Bible that denies what their messenger taught so let's listen to that quote from Brother cam but really what we would need to do at some point in time is is to actually look at the evidence especially from a message perspective which is what we're looking at and see if this affects what a godsent seventh Angel William brandham gave us now before getting into the podcast I want to make two statements first I want to apologize for certain portions of the podcast that don't have very good sound quality that's my fault I think I forgot to plug in the external microphone when brother Cam and I recorded this second part so please pardon that if you have any questions on what brother cam or myself said please reach out and let me know I tried to edit it so everything that was said could be understood this the second statement is I want to show some Bible verses about the equality with God you know there are some people that would get so upset if you said there was inequality with God between God and the Believers it's so misunderstood especially by many people outside the message one side completely rejects any teaching that brings an equality between God and man and of course this group would deny the truth in 1 John 3:9 which says the seed of God in The Believer makes it so The Believer cannot sin and so we see when a Believer receives the baptism of the Holy Ghost in his or her soul they have a small measure of equality with God they have a portion or a measure of equality with God because God's spirit is inside him or her that measure of the holy spirit is part of God's Own eternal spirit it's a portion of God's Own Spirit or it's a measure as the Bible says in Romans 12:3 we have a Measure of Faith then Ephesians 4:13 says we have a measure of the fullness of the stature of Christ inside of us and this measure is the same quality of God's Own spirit because it is God's spirit and Romans 8:11 says if the spirit of God dwells in you it will Quicken your mortal body just as it quickened Jesus's mortal body so Believers like brother Cam and myself and others who Faithfully preach the message that God gave to brother brandham we're not exalting ourselves saying we're equal with God what we're saying is we have a measure of God's Own spirit in us and that measure of God's spirit is equal in quality as God's spirit but of course Jesus had the fullness of the Holy Ghost a larger quantity of the Holy Ghost the fullness of the godhead dwelt in Christ bodily as Colossians 1:9 says the Bible said the fullness of the godhead dwelt in Christ Colossians 2:9 as well Jesus had the holy ghost without measure as John 3:34 says so message Believers are not saying we have the same amount of holy ghost that Jesus had we're not saying that we're just saying we have a small measure or portion of the Holy Ghost but as 1 John 39 said that same quality of the holy spirit makes us so we cannot sin that spirit of God in us cannot sin so there's two camps around this thought on the equality of God the first Camp rejects any teaching on equality with God and the other Camp overemphasizes it such as in the NRA movement the Kenneth Copeland movement the Bill Johnson movement the Joyce Meyer movement the Prosperity Gospel Movement that names it and claims it they have what they call the little Gods teaching and of course they overemphasize it connecting it with their false Prosperity Gospel and they falsely believe God wants every believer healthy wealthy and they can speak whatever they want they name it and claim it that's a false gospel brother man plainly taught when a Christian speaks the word of God it's only by the permission of God a real Christian can only speak name and claim what God wants them to name and claim you are believing because of the spoken words and things like that that he said about and all of you here Witnesses squirrels and all these other things that's been done but did you notice that was sovereignly given I never asked him Lord let me do this speak these things in like that do these things there I never asked him that he by his own Divine will came to me and said you go do this see I wasn't asking one thing about it Moses never asked to go down in Egypt but was God that sent him down to Egypt see so if you have any questions on the equality with God teaching please let me know again it's the equality in the soul of the believer not the body and not the human Spirit or mind brother Cam and I hope to do another recording soon by God's grace and we'll go over other numerous Bible doctrines that are attacked or changed or completely taken out of the new Bible translations they're false Bible translations of course a few examples are prayer and fasting to cast out Devils that teaching is taken out of numerous new Bible translations also new Bible translations take out the word fornication as a sin that causes one to not inherit the kingdom of God so in other words they're giving a license for immorality as Jude 1:3 says the Bible said these men were ordained to this condemnation they turned the grace of God into lusciousness or lawlessness they're allowing people to commit fornication and say it's not a sin we don't believe a true message believer would want to use a Bible that denies what their seventh Church age messenger taught and denies what Jesus taught so again these podcasts and videos are made in the love of God to help people stay with the true word of God the King James version Bible with that being said here is part two of Bible [Music] translations God bless you and welcome to the defending the message podcast I'm your host Pastor Jesse Smith in today's podcast we're going to do part two on the Bible versions topic we're again joined by my brother in the natural and spiritual Pastor Cameron Smith from Napoleon Ohio and in this podcast we're going to look at five message doctrines that are changed or attacked by the new Bible translations this was recorded back in July I believe so it took me a while to get this edited and ready for publication but I'm excited to get this out now and we'll jump right into this topic with our precious brother so hope you enjoy part two yes so I think a key point to start right off with is that there are many many many different es uh which not only destroy what we call message Doctrine but also fundamental doctrines from all Protestants of course from our standpoint this right here will uh going through these will will show you not just little things but rather large changes that they made you know what they they always say the proof is in the pudding so you know you can have somebody reason and reason you to a spot okay I'm with that critical text but once you see what the critical text produces that might give you another thought now I would like to start first off uh with Luke 4:4 because of course what we're talking about we're talking about the word of God Luke 4:4 the King James version says and Jesus answered him in saying it is written that man shall not live by bread alone but by every word of God now what we find when we we start looking at the critical text and the new versions is that it will actually take this out NIV it says Jesus answered it is written man shall not live on bread alone period notice what they take out they take out Jesus's own words and they say man shall not live on bread alone but they take out but by every word of God that's what solar script tour is we live by the word it's our only infallibility now we could go through the the ESV the message bible NLT but they basically all say the same same thing but for the sake of of those U message Believers starting to look at the Amplified Bible perhaps having interest in using that the Amplified Bible says and Jesus replied to him it is written man shall not live and be sustained on bread alone brackets a but by every word and expression of God so it actually adds to it so now it doesn't just say live but it says but now we must be sustained by every word and expression of God so what's an expression of God that could mean almost anything that could mean uh a do game you know flew and landed on my window s it means God has his holy ghost for me good enough you know I'm gonna live on that now which I mean I'm I'm not taking down what God can manifest but notice now we're we're adding but you'll find it's going to get a little bit more severe now I started right there because that affects everybody okay of course that's from the Old Testament but one that will go from for us message Believers is Revelations 10:7 which is very critical the King James version says but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as Heath declared to his servants the prophets so we see right there a seventh angel but what Angel we see is we see that it is the Angel to the Church of leoda the seventh Church age Angel which is why it says says as he declared to his servants the prophets because he was a prophet but I want you to see this uh look at what the Amplified says it says but when it is time for the trumpet call of the seventh angel when he is about to sound then the mystery of God that is his hidden purpose and plan is finished as he announced the gospel to his servants the prophets so look at what he says here now why is this relevant and why is this really important because if you look in the Bible you'll find in Revelations 8 and9 you'll find six trumpet Angels but the seventh trumpet angel is not denoted but if I take a new version for Revelation 10:7 what Angel do I have I have when it's time for the trumpet call of the seventh angel so they are saying that the seventh angel and the King James is actually the seventh trumpet angel to the Jews okay well if we get into the Bible where does it talk about in the King James the seventh angel trumpet angel coming at the end of Revelations 11 which is the two prophets come out that finishes and then the seventh trumpet angel sounds so now what are we going to do with that brother Jesse so you see what I'm saying now watch the NIV Bible it says but in the days when the the seventh angel is about to sound his trumpet and it continues on so one of our main doctrines which shows that we will receive the mystery of God in this hour which ties in with Matthew 17 the days uh of the restoration is right here but they the new versions are saying this is no longer the seven Church Angel like he told us it is actually the seventh angel to the Jews very important wow brother I'd never seen that before but you're right yeah if they make that a trumpet angel it's connected to the angel of judgment during the Great Tribulation period and not the seventh Church age messenger huge it's huge so you know as a message believer why would I even want to partake in this you see what I'm saying so uh some very major changes because now now we're having issues with our revelation of Revelations 2 and 3 very important okay let's do another one I'm going to read uh King James Bible uh Genesis 41 and 2 it says and Adam knew as Eve's wife and she conceived and bear Cain and said I have gotten a man from the Lord now watch it says and she again bear his brother Abel and Abel was a keeper of the sheep but Cain was a tiller of the ground all right are you ready for this yes sir the Amplified Bible says now the man Adam knew Eve as his wife and she conceived and gave birth to Cain and she said I have obtained a man parentheses baby boy son with the help of the Lord verse two and brackets later she gave birth to his brother Abel okay now let's read again because they say the same thing because it's it's written with a different text uh NIV it says Adam made love to his wife Eve and she became pregnant and gave birth to Cain uh she said with the help of the Lord I have brought forth a man second verse later she gave birth to his brother Abel so this destroys one of our main tenant doctrines of serpent seed because Genesis 41 and2 in the King James version we can see the absolute and even the commentators talk about that this could be a twins okay uh which is what we believe we believe that the serpent impregnated Eve and then Adam shortly after partook in the same fruit and right there we have two children born from two act but the amplifi NIV say and later she gave birth to his brother Abel so what was that 5 years two years and and the commentators make note of that and they say it was two separate at Birth and this one came later so if you destroy twins at the beginning you destroy the whole doctrine of message Believers and you can do that with the Catholic version Bibles that's right and that's what Satan doesn't like to do he doesn't like to be exposed right so the King James version exposes what he did in the garden his fruit was adultery and It produced uh a separate seed line and so the King James version preserves that truth and that is crazy what versions did you read There Brother what two versions I first read the Amplified and then I read the NIV most of these I'm going to read are from the Amplified then NIV right because those are the ones most used by people right yep and uh you'll see that uh it's very interesting because they're actually very close to each other well why is that because they use a different Greek text right and then the Bible in uh Genesis 3 already says there's two seeds when God said I'll put enity between thee and the woman between thy seed and her seed and then the Bible already says in Genesis 3 that Eve is already a mother of all living so the King James sets up there's already two seeds in Genesis 3 and then King James makes it look like there's twins in Genesis 41 and2 but then the other versions destroy that foundation and even the testimony of Genesis chapter 3 right so the whole different idea but that's the point of it that's why it was sent it was sent to deceive you know if I can interject something just for a moment if you think about it why if they're saying that the vaticanus and the cicus are more reliable on their right why are these critical text acceptors why at every opportunity are they trying to make something very close to the King James version you see what I'm saying if they're going to take Mark 16 out why wouldn't you just put a Bible without Mark 16 at the end of it the Great Commission but you see what they're doing they're they're actually trying to deceive saying that their version has it even though it doesn't right deceiving on purpose probably for financial gain but also for the corruption and deception of the One World Church 100% so if if there's a better why in the world don't we all just get pushed right over to it so a very good point a very valid point so let's do this one next this is the equality that you and I have with God us Believers have with God Philippians 2:5 it says uh let this mind be in you uh which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God so we look at in the New Testament we find that we're the bride of Christ uh the message teaches us that that we are actually the feminine attribute of God uh so the Bible tells us here that let us Think Like Jesus Christ let this mind be in you he thought it not robbery to be equal with God so you and I uh we should be with this mind of Jesus that we think it's not robbery to be equal with God okay now let's hit it Amplified verse five and there's a lot of brackets and parentheses in the in the amplifi because they're trying to amplify everything but uh it says have this same attitude in yourselves which was in Christ Jesus uh brackets look to him as your example in selfless humility verse six uh who although he existed in the form and unchanging essence of God brackets as one with him possessing the fullness of all the Divine attributes the entire nature of deity and of brackets did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped or assert it as if he did not already possess it or is afraid of losing it okay so that's in the brackets so now they're I want you to see this of course all these amplifications they're just giving you what you're what they want you to believe but notice they said they did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped or asserted okay which can apply to us so it's completely opposite now if those brackets weren't there it would be just like NIV the NIV says in your relationships with one another have the same mindset as Christ Jesus who being in the very nature of God did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own Advantage it's completely opposite so where the King James tells us that we should begin to start thinking like Christ let Christ mind bring this forth from us that thought it not robbery to be equal with God the other two versions say one that he did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped or asserted and that's the way way people act you know they they don't believe they can do the same works as Jesus they don't think they can grasp that um It also says in the NIV and they're all different when they when they come against this but uh and bring it a contrary idea but they they also say uh he didn't think it was something to be used as his own Advantage I don't know about you the holy ghost in the day of Pentecost was given for an advantage right exactly right yeah Jesus said it's power to be Witnesses and then Paul said we don't want to let Satan get advantage on us because we know his devices we're not ignorant of his devices right so then we work with uh the equality we see that we have we have issues with the belief of the equality of God that we have now obviously in some of these and if you think about it you know they can change one of them completely opposite way and then you can have you can still have John 14:12 there uh but but if you watch it actually starts putting the scripture against itself well which one do I believe which one do I believe so what does that say you know once again then it just makes confusion and how you going to have faith uh in the aspect of confusion right brother good verse for that with equality with God is uh first John 3:9 for whosever is born of God do not commit sin now here's the same man two chapters earlier said if you say you don't sin you're a liar uh but then he explains it for his seed remaineth in him he cannot sin because he's born of God so when Christians say you know there's this element of equality with God that's what we mean it's God's spirit living in our soul it's the spirit of God that's quickened our soul here John catches the Revelation and says it's the seed of God we have God's Own seed we're God's own children acts 17 says we're his offspring and that's the reality of what we're talking about when it refers to equality of uh with God it's a part of God is inside of us and if it's a part of God it's just as Eternal as God and that goes back to Ephesians 1 where it says we were chosen in Christ before the foundational world and that tells us we were in the thoughts of almighty God and that thought in God's mind has become manifested and then he put his life his equal life in inside of us so the part of us that's equal with God is the soul because the soul has the anointing of the Holy Ghost right amen amen and that puts the nature of God on the inside of us well what does the nature of God do it makes you like God excellent yes that's what Peter said Peter said we're partakers of the divine nature in second Peter chapter 1 so that's the part of us that's equal with God is the soul that's filled with the Holy Ghost right right amen I'd also like to play two quotes from God's Prophet brother brandham about the equality the believer has with God the first is from 1954 questions and answers May 15th brother Bram said man is almost on the equal with God and that's what we're talking about when we talk about the teaching of equality with God man is never fully equal with God but God shares a measure of his spirit with him so here's the quote from questions and answers 54 almost une equal with God but a man is in flesh like a brute but he's got a soul of God anymore it makes him Immortal amen and he can invent look what he can do he's on almost on equal with God because he's a Son of God even in his fall in the faith he's wonderful look at him see that's it and here's the second quote I'd like to share this quote from brother brandom says it even more plainly he refers to the soul of of The Believer from the sermon called the token September 1963 a beautiful quote brother Brams talking about a Believer has passed from Death unto life and of course that must mean eternal life God's own life Zoe life brother R quotes 1 John 3:9 The Believer cannot sin for the seed of God remains in him brother R is referring to the Token or the baptism of the Holy Ghost the blood of Jesus Christ has covered his sins it can't display nothing but the token so a believer's life can only display the eternal life that God shares with him let's listen to the quote September 1st morning 1963 the token there it is it cannot perish now a life lays over it's a token lays over that little body lays over that soul that person there's a token over there the holy spirit that it belongs to God it say when I see the token I'll pass over you a POS postive token the holy spirit is our token therefore when you receive the Holy Ghost you pass from Death to life that's all because life is in you you can no more perish the Bible said he that's formed of God does not commit sin for he cannot sin for the seed of God the seed of God remains in him and how can he sin when the sin God is in him when he's in a sinless God how can he sin no matter what he's done the blood's covered him he's a new creature now his desires and Ambitions is of Heaven because he's changed from a cuckle be to a wheat his desires ain't the same as he once was and he displays it you so I believe that and still sin it ah you're deceived that's right it can't display nothing but the token let's jump to another one brother and uh I I want I want to focus on the Amplified this time because of all the uh little brackets and so forth but uh in 1 Corinthians 11 and I'm just going to read a little bit of the King James but I'm going to read most of it from the Amplified uh and then maybe we can highlight some of those things in 1 Corinthians 11:4 of course this whole half of the chapter is working with hair it's working with covering you know we we believe that a woman should not cut her hair amen um in 1 Corinthians 11:4 it says every man uh praying or prophesying having his head covered dishonor his head but every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonor her head for that is even all one as if she were shaven for if the woman be not covered let her also be Shor but if it be a shame for a woman to be Shor or shaven let her be covered uh of course if you move down to the 15th verse it says that the covering is the hair said a woman's covering is her hair uh this is something we we've been taught of the seventh angel something the Bible and right there it all makes perfect sense because it's saying that a man should not let his hair grow and never cut it it's saying that a woman should always uh let her hair grow so if we look at the Amplified let's pick this up here so in the fourth verse in the Amplified it says every man who prays or prophesies with something on his head it's completely different so now they're saying that the covering is actually something that I'm putting on my head this is a covering it's not the hair anymore I want you to see this because what you're finding is they're actually beginning to put their Doctrine in with doing this uh anyone who prays or prophesies with something on his head dishonors his head brackets and the one who is the head and every woman who prays or prophesies when she has her head uncovered disgraces her head so it's already bringing on the idea that a covering is something that you would put on your head it's not your hair it's something you put on your head uh for she is one and the same as the woman who whose head is shaved brackets in disgrace if a woman does not cover her head she should have her hair cut off and if it is disgraceful for a woman to have her hair cut off or her head shaped she should cover her head okay then it continues so it's still bringing the same idea I don't know what you're picking up with this but when you just start off with something on the head now the whole thing talks about I got to wear a hoodie I got to we a some sort of a hat so seventh verse picks up and it says a man ought not to have his head covered brackets during worship where do they get that from I can 100% say that is not in the Greek they're putting their own interpretation on this so you know a lot of the message brothers that will say and the Amplified says that you have to be very careful because you can see right here these people are absolutely making something up that only during worship which implies what brother Jesse it implies that it's putting something on right and then that helps them form their well this is just a cultural thing argument rather than no this was Paul's command as he preached everywhere in every church as he said in 1 Corinthians 4 if I'm not mistaken verse 17 and you're right yeah brother you can go back and we can use the Greek Lexicon and we can click every one of those Greek words and it will never say anything about wearing something in the worship right like wearing a hat or wearing a head covering in worship it never says that in the Greek they injected their own false idea into the text yes exactly and that's why you'll find many traditions in churches the women will have to wear hats in church and the men you know when they walk in they'll take their hat off so the women keep their hats on well what is that that's old traditions that they've made off misunderstanding this but we're going to jump down a little bit for time s to the 13th verse so it goes through and says why but now it says in the 13th verse judge for yourselves is it proper for a woman to offer prayer to God brackets publicly with her head uncovered so you see they're they're giving you their Doctrine because now they're injecting in there that this head uncovered is publicly so does not common sense itself teach you that if a man has long hair it is a dishonor to him but if a woman has long hair it is her ornament and glory for her long hair is given to her as a covering well the whole thing is a confused mess now now we're talking about hats now we're back to hair so he says now if anyone is inclined to be contentious brackets about this which I don't know about you I'm feeling a little contentious about this myself right now uh we have no other practice brackets in worship So This only affects this whole thing that they're saying it only affects worship than this brackets nor do the Churches of God in Brackets in general so you see how this is the version I'm hearing several message ministers using nowadays is uh this Amplified trying to get and I and God bless them you know they want to be deeper they want they want to be able to give a more profound understanding but if they're already doing this uh what are we looking at right those are excellent examples you know I just looked in 1 Corinthians 11 in the King James it doesn't say anything about public worship again they added their own thoughts in there so brother these are five amazing areas you know living by every word of God that gets back to you know perfect faith and even love for Jesus Jesus said if you love me keep my commands other words live by the word uh the second was Revelation 10:7 these Bible versions attack our seventh Church age Messengers why would we want to use them uh the serpent seed brother Bram said that doesn't pertain to salvation but it does shine more light on the truth that we're all trying to see and it is a mystery of course it's part of the mystery of iniquity so brother B had to come and finish the mystery of God that was one of them and then our equality with God as far as the Holy Ghost being in us that's attacked by the false Bible translations and then this Fifth and final example for this podcast hair links and remember the Bible says in the King James it's a shame which means a repulse for a woman to cut her hair and it has nothing to do with the the man-made coverings of the hat or the cloth or anything like that Paul is clear this is a disgrace this is a repuls which means a disgusting thing when a woman cuts her hair or a man grows his hair out uncut like a woman so we see how the King James protects the Gospel of Jesus Christ that Christ revealed to Paul and then had to restore through Luther Wesley and then finish the mystery of God with brother brandom Hallelujah exactly right brother so we've come to the conclusion of part two on this podcast series of Bible versions hopefully this series is beginning to prove to everybody that the King James version is the only fully accurate infallible version of the Bible by the grace of God we've only scratched the surface we look forward to having further podcasts that discuss all the changes sadly that new Bible versions are making to God's holy word so we want to thank brother cam for being on this podcast and we're going to invite him back for another recording again very soon by the grace of God so we'll let brother cam say a final few words here and share a little more about some of the resources he'd recommend if you're interested in studying this topic all right thank you brother Jesse it's been a real blessing to be here and we're glad uh that the Lord has anointed you in such a way to try to help the people of God uh with answers uh and to better the relationship with Jesus Christ I would say in in closing uh if anyone would be interested there's a few places you can go there's actually many places you could go uh but I would recommend it especially because we're in the 21st century a man a filmmaker named Chris Pinto uh has done numerous films but uh regarding the Bible and the Bible version say he has three very very filling Works he has a lamp in the darkness he has bridge to Babylon and then tears among the wheat that's the name of it those those are very good uh documentaries they're almost three hours long a piece but they're just jam-packed full of very good evidence quotes and so forth um that's a real good one uh another resource would be um ww. bs. net and then you could look up books uh David souron has some really good books on the subject so do Floyd Jones uh which version is the Bible that was a very good one Dr Samuel Gip has the understandable history of King James Bible very good Jack Mormon he has forever settled uh a few other books I have and then David Daniels has very good readable resources like what's missing in my Bible did Jesus use the septu aant uh which is the Greek New Testament there's a lot of resources that he has and he's at chick.com so there's so much there to prove that you're on the right track uh because what we're dealing with here is we're dealing with a Protestant versus Catholic uh idea two lines that's where we're at so that's where I'm at brother Jesse amen well we appreciate that brother cam thanks for all the studying you've done may God richly bless you as you continue to study we appreciate your stand for the truth brother and we just love the word of God I think of these former saints that gave their lives for the word of God and we live in such a blessed age we don't suffer anything that they did as far as imprisonment yet or martyrdom and so we must remember the sacrifices that these men made to give the perfect word of God uh brother cam did mention that book look what's missing cam gave me a copy of that by David W Daniels it's an amazing book easy to read I used it to preach a few sermons about this to my church and Floyd Nolan Jones's book what version is the Bible I use parts of that in my 2021 book so these are awesome resources and as our brother said the proof is right there in front of you the proof is in the pudding it's plain to see and we have to be on guard because s is trying to attack the true Revelation brother Bram calls it bride Doctrine Satan is against uh the bride Doctrine right as we saw five awesome examples the Lord showed our brother cam so we're very grateful for that the Antichrist refuses the true bride Doctrine and therefore he takes his own bride now and builds her up under a Creed of his own thank you so much brother Cam and we look forward to the next podcast by the grace of God so that brings this podcast to a conclusion friends thank you for your downloads and if you feel led of the Holy Spirit to share this with someone please do in prayer God bless you and may Jesus Christ anoint you to defend the message good afternoon friends very happy to be here this afternoon and again in a defense of the Gospel of Jesus Christ to bring the Good Tidings the good news that Jesus raised from the dead living among men today his church the same Jesus that was yesterday will be today and forever is never failed [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
