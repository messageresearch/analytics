[0:03] I know what that is. Even my tabernacle
[0:06] today of which my foundation now the
[0:10] people who does send donations to this
[0:12] foundation has a government number comes
[0:15] back to you to give you tax resent from
[0:18] all that you send to this foundation.
[0:20] It's a a nonprofit foundation called
[0:24] Bram Tabernacle.
[0:26] Greetings friends in the mattress name
[0:28] of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of
[0:31] this video is to answer a viewer's
[0:33] question about churches being registered
[0:36] with the government. This is an
[0:38] excellent question and there's numerous
[0:40] quotes from God's prophet brother
[0:41] Brandham that help answer this question.
[0:43] By the grace of God, the book of Acts
[0:45] says we ought to obey God rather than
[0:47] men. So any commandment of man that goes
[0:50] against the word of God should be
[0:52] rejected. But if the commandments of men
[0:54] do not go against the word of God, then
[0:56] we should keep them as well. As the Lord
[0:57] Jesus Christ said, "Give unto Caesar
[0:59] what is Caesars's." So that's the
[1:01] balance that we take as holy ghostfilled
[1:03] Christians. We obey all the laws of the
[1:04] land as long as they do not transgress
[1:06] the laws of God. So I'll read this
[1:08] specific question. It says, "Did Brother
[1:11] Brandham register the Brandom Tabernacle
[1:12] with the state of Indiana?" Yes, he did.
[1:16] Now, the brother request copies of that,
[1:19] but I don't have those copies. So, if
[1:20] anybody does have the copies, please
[1:23] share them with me and I'll make another
[1:24] video and then I can leave a link in the
[1:26] description to those documents by God's
[1:28] grace. And then I was asked, did you
[1:29] register the bride of Christ fellowship
[1:31] with the state of Ohio? And the answer
[1:32] is yes, I did. Then the brother said,
[1:34] there are certain message believers in
[1:37] his African country where they don't
[1:40] believe in registering their churches
[1:41] through the state required registration.
[1:44] So, I would say this is a Christian
[1:45] liberty. There's no mandate in the Bible
[1:48] that you have to register your church
[1:49] with the government. But there's nothing
[1:51] sinful about registering your church
[1:53] with the government unless the
[1:55] government is asking you to deny your
[1:57] faith somehow and then you wouldn't want
[1:58] to do that. But in my case and the case
[2:01] of brother Brandham, there was no sin in
[2:03] registering your church organization or
[2:06] organism is the better Bible word with
[2:08] the state as long as the state does not
[2:12] make you deny the faith, the Christian
[2:14] faith in any manner. Also, I'll say
[2:16] before we registered our church, we
[2:19] talked to an accountant and the
[2:20] accountant said there are religious
[2:22] exemptions from registering your church
[2:24] with the state. But in order to take
[2:26] that religious exemption, you have to
[2:29] say that you don't believe in the role
[2:31] of the government. And so I could not
[2:34] take that religious exemption because
[2:36] when I was growing up, my family
[2:38] received food stamps. When I was a
[2:40] child, of course, my mom and father
[2:43] received food stamps. And I'm grateful
[2:45] we had food stamps because it helped
[2:46] feed our family. And then even after I
[2:49] got married, I was in the lowincome
[2:51] classification. So we did receive a
[2:53] little bit of government assistance. I
[2:55] believe it was through wick, women,
[2:57] infants, and children. And so I
[2:59] benefited from that as well. So I'm
[3:01] grateful for that. And so it is not
[3:03] against my faith for governments to help
[3:05] feed people if there's a true need for
[3:08] food. So again, the Bible foundation is
[3:10] Jesus's words about give to Caesar
[3:12] what's Caesars's. And also the entire
[3:14] chapter of Romans 13 speaks about how
[3:17] God gives earthly governments authority
[3:20] and we should follow their authority as
[3:22] long as they do not transgress the word
[3:24] of God. Now look at these quotes from
[3:26] God's prophet brother Brandham here in
[3:28] chronological order. So in 1950
[3:31] August 24th to whom is the arm of the
[3:33] Lord revealed in Cleveland Ohio. Brother
[3:36] Ram says how Voice of Healing was a
[3:38] nonprofit organization. And notice
[3:39] Brother Ram never criticized the Voice
[3:42] of Healing for being a nonprofit
[3:44] organization. He said, quote, "Always
[3:46] the nonprofit organization, the voice of
[3:48] healing. Brother Lindsay is the editor
[3:49] and brother Moore is the co-editor and
[3:52] sister Anna Gene Moore is the
[3:54] circulating editor."
[3:56] In the second quote, Brother Brandham
[3:58] said in 1951, July 29th am the
[4:02] resurrection of Lazarus in Erie,
[4:05] Pennsylvania, Brother Brandham said,
[4:07] "The missionary Baptist church gave me a
[4:09] local exorter license, giving me the
[4:12] right to marry, bury, baptize, or so
[4:15] forth in the state of Indiana." So
[4:17] there, Brother Brandham states he had a
[4:20] license to preach, marry, Barry, etc.
[4:22] through the state of Indiana. and I have
[4:25] the same through the state of Ohio by
[4:26] God's grace.
[4:29] Thirdly, in 1958, the placing of
[4:30] deacons, brother Random said the
[4:32] Brandham tabernacle had bylaws or
[4:34] written rules for how the church was
[4:36] governed and ran. He said, "The old
[4:38] bylaws were destroyed in the 1937 flood,
[4:41] but brother was able to recopy them and
[4:44] hang them in the Breham tabernacle." He
[4:46] said, quote, "The old set of bylaws was
[4:48] destroyed in the 1937 flood. We have
[4:50] recopied those and will be hung on the
[4:52] wall here soon. the duties of trustees,
[4:55] deacons, treasures, and so forth,
[4:56] pastor, associates, and so forth. End
[4:58] quote. Now, I have a copy of these
[5:02] bylaws if you like them. I don't know if
[5:04] Brandham Tabernacle was the one that
[5:05] printed these out or somebody else typed
[5:07] them out and printed them out and shared
[5:09] them with me. I got them from Bible
[5:11] Believers Church in the early 2000s when
[5:14] I was a member there. I was a member
[5:16] there from about 2004 to 2006, but I
[5:19] visited there from 2001 to 2004 before I
[5:23] became a member by God's grace. So, let
[5:26] me know if you'd like a copy. I can put
[5:28] the copy of bylaws from Adam Tabernacle
[5:30] in a PDF. If you like them, just let me
[5:32] know. Please email me.
[5:34] jesse.smith1icloud.com.
[5:37] Fourth from let us see God, November
[5:39] 29th, 1959, San Jose, California.
[5:42] Brother Ram said, quote, "Even my
[5:44] tabernacle today, of which my
[5:46] foundation, now the people who does send
[5:49] donations to this foundation has a
[5:50] government number comes back to you to
[5:53] give you tax exempt from all that you
[5:56] send to this foundation. It's a a
[5:59] nonprofit foundation called Brandom
[6:01] Tabernacle." End quote. So there,
[6:04] Brother Ram says his church was
[6:06] registered with the government and they
[6:07] had a government number and so does our
[6:10] church. We have a tax exempt status
[6:12] number, a tax ID number with the state
[6:14] of Ohio. So in this quote, we see
[6:17] brother Brandham set up the Brandom
[6:18] Tabernacle as a foundation with the
[6:20] state of Indiana. It was a nonprofit
[6:23] foundation with the state of Indiana.
[6:25] And he also permitted financial
[6:27] donations to be taxexempt, which we do
[6:29] as well here in the state of Ohio. And
[6:31] fifth and finally in all things November
[6:33] 24th evening service 1962 brother
[6:36] Brandham again says Brandham Tabernacle
[6:39] was a nonprofit foundation quote and
[6:41] it'll all been deposited was on deposit
[6:45] in the church and so forth which we were
[6:47] using as a nonprofit foundation end
[6:49] quote. So brother Ram's talking about
[6:52] his tax case where he owed back taxes
[6:54] and he calls his church Brandham
[6:56] Tabernacle a nonprofit foundation.
[6:59] In closing, friends, I hope this video
[7:01] was a blessing by the grace of God. I
[7:03] kind of want to use this video as a
[7:04] reference. Over the years, I've been
[7:06] asked numerous times about these quotes.
[7:08] I want to put them in one place, one
[7:10] video here, and Lord willing, I'll be
[7:12] able to use this video to answer the
[7:14] question. Did Brother Random register
[7:16] Brandon Tabernacle with the state of
[7:17] Indiana? And the answer is yes. And he
[7:19] had a minister's license through the
[7:21] state of Indiana. So again, it's awesome
[7:23] to see how humble brother Rand was, how
[7:24] much he obeyed the laws of the land. We
[7:27] should do the same by the grace of God.
[7:29] There are other quotes where brother Ram
[7:30] talks about we should obey the big boss
[7:32] and he's speaking of the federal
[7:33] government and no doubt he obeyed the
[7:35] state government and local governments
[7:37] as well by the grace of God because he
[7:39] was a holy ghost Christian. So please
[7:42] share this video with anyone who has
[7:43] questions about taxes, registering with
[7:46] the government, preaching licenses and
[7:48] so forth by the grace of God.

[8:04] again in defense of the gospel of Jesus
[8:06] Christ [music] to bring the good
[8:08] tidings, the good news that Jesus raised
[8:11] from the dead, living among man today,
[8:13] his church. [music]

[8:17] be today and forever
[8:20] is never failed.
