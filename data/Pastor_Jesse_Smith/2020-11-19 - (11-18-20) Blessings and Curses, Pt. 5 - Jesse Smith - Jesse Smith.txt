right well he's wanting to build you that guy uh also if you'd like to do the thanksgiving dinner let us know um i'm gonna ask i'm gonna text the saints and if you want to do a get-together we'll probably do it at our house just because we have a stove there it's just a little bit easier you know but i'll ask the saints i'll text them and we need to know it we need no pride by this sunday by god's grace also um let's remember uh sister wendy and prayer she's on vacation i guess so she's out in arizona let's pray for her she said they have a high uh she's now they have a high rate of coronavirus cases so she said pray that they don't get too high where she would have to quarantine when she gets back i guess if it's high enough ohio would make him quarantine or something like that so she asked for our prayers so let's pray for her tonight let's remember my father in prayer my brother simon and i were talking yesterday he's going to go talk to my dad and try to witness to him about curses and blessings so let's remember my dad in prayer anybody else have any other needs tonight anything on their hearts anyone that needs prayer ready okay okay so three of our family members are still unable to smell all females right hopefully that's strange okay so let's remember uh some family members in prayer how many know that jesus said if any two or three agree on anything on earth that he'll hear it in heaven praise god how we know that let's uh agree tonight and let's uh let's touch the throne of god he said he can be touched by the feeling of our infirmity so let's touch the throne of god tonight uh and he can feel our concerns here so let's bow our heads as we pray here heavenly father grateful for your mercy [Music] grace [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] lord in jesus name [Music] is [Music] this is [Music] back i just didn't get a chance so forgive me that was great singing i couldn't think of anything sweeter to get on my birthday so thank you girls god bless you richly we just watched that over and over that was a real blessing so thank you girls hallelujah uh let's see a couple more by god's grace i've been trying to really limit my preaching that my voice really hurts it kind of hurts on the inside so and god to help me tonight so let's sing a song here and praise the lord [Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] man [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] do [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] do [Music] just came to my heart there i thought we'd take it tonight praise god thank the lord let's take our bibles i'd like to uh look at blessings and cursings again tonight by god's grace and go a little bit further here though simon i had a good talk last night and it's kind of got some thoughts going so lord willing uh let's open up with a familiar one let's go to deuteronomy 29 you're driving me 29 now here uh deuteronomy 29 look at verse 16 i'd like to uh just bring to your members this scripture is using the church age book regarding idolatry and names being removed out of the book of life so deuteronomy 29 16 to verse verses 16 to 20. all right jeremy 29 16 through 20. this is a little bit lengthy reading but i thought it'd be helpful you know brother graham felt led of the lord to put in the church age book so i'd like to read it here uh all of it tonight uh maybe we'll all read the last verse together because it's so well four verses five verses long so let me read the first few verses alone and then we'll read that last verse 20 together verse 16 for ye know how ye have dwelt in the land of egypt and how we came through the nations which passed by which he passed by rather and ye have seen their abominations and their idols wooden stones silver and gold which were among them lest there should be any among you man or woman or family or tribe bless you whose heart turneth away this day from the lord our god to go and serve the gods of these nations lest there should be among you a root that beareth gall and wormwood and it came to pass when he heareth the words of this curse that he bless himself in his heart saying i shall have peace though i walk in the imagination of mine heart to add drunkenness to thirst okay so that the scripture is speaking of a man who in israel who hears the curse but he blesses himself and said oh ah that's not going to happen i'm not going to be cursed let's read verse 20 together here uh let's read him three one two three the lord will not spare him but then the anger of the lord and his jealousy jealousy sorry shall smoke against that man and all the curses that are written in this book shall lie upon him and the lord shall blot out his name from under heaven let's have a word of prayer tonight by god's grace that's the holy spirit to guide us and help us heavenly father god we're gathered in your house uh it's a privilege to be on the battlefield for the lord and lord we promise you we'll serve you until we die or until we have the body change preferably lord the body change lord as all of us don't want to die but lord we want to live to see the coming of the lord but lord nevertheless not our will but thy will be done so lord take this night lord guide me lord help the people feed them lord god may they pull and may i pull on you and lord may you speak to us by the holy spirit as we desire to experience your blessings father god and lord enjoy them to the fullest capacity lord where we're fully surrendered minds fully surrendered wills and our souls lord have your nature inside of them by the holy spirit seal of god so lord speak to us here tonight and help us lord help those physically that press their way out to the house of god bless them lord abundantly those live streaming and lord also those on the archive may your spirit help them in jesus christ's name and the saint said amen praise god god bless you as being seated praise god and i think i might as well just thank everybody i want to thank thank naomi and uh beatrice and wesley for the nice card there thank you i i sure appreciated that that really made me made me feel good i guess everybody you know i appreciate all the cards i haven't had time to get back to it you know we're we had guests to like 10 30 last night and had to get ready for work and i had to work we had a meeting this morning at 8 10 and i didn't really have any time to get back to anything so lord willing i like to get back to thanking everybody but i appreciate that i literally went to bed last night with a big old smile on my face so i just told my wife i said honey how do you do it how are you so smart to plan this out i just couldn't stop smiling i don't think i could ever pull something off like that but we need to try children you need to help me so well we'll have to do something like that one of these days lord willing so yeah i really appreciate everybody's love and i just really felt like i could hardly contain my happiness last night so i i just thank you and and thank the lord for his grace i guess they say 40 is the new 30 right is that they say [Music] 40 is the new 30 like like 50 50 is the new uh i'm sorry 50 is the new 40 right so in other words uh whatever age you are it's like you're 10 years younger so i guess that's a new saying you can switch over here i got some slides here tonight by god's grace i just thank the lord and um you know god is rich in mercy so we give god all the praise and thankful for another year to serve the lord so we just read this tonight church and brother ram uses this scripture to show why are two tribes deleted so tribes are deleted because of pride because they they say oh i'm okay uh well they say i'm blessed by god so god considers this a literal curse when when you know this is iniquity when you know what to do you know right but instead you try to avoid the curse or the punishment of god and people take upon themselves or they try to bless themselves but ultimately they'll be cursed because they're into idolatry remember they have idols wood stone silver gold now we don't see a lot of that in america we see the idols of money right we see the idols of uh popularity uh pride and all these idols in america we just see them all over the place but the cause uh or sorry the curse rather against idolatry is names blotted out i think the closest thing for us would be those who worship brother branham as we've labored on that you know 14 20 services whatever we've labored on that so i'm not going to spend much time on that but i think that's the closest ones we have to be careful of but remember brother said you can make a piano a idol all right malcolm you can make uh a car right brother jess yeah you can make uh your husband your wife brother you can make a pastor you can make a preacher you can make anything an idol right so we don't want to make anything an idol uh we want to recognize god's curses and his blessings and we want to obey god's word and we don't want to be prideful and think well we're we're close enough with god where we don't have to keep god's word remember the promise is if you diligently hearken in the word of god you'll be blessed praise god but it's diligent hearkening unto god now i want to finish the quote brother brahman gives us the next part of the quote hearing is pronounced the curse against idolatry or spiritual fornication the tribe that turned to idolatry was to have its name blotted out and the history of the two tribes whose names were brought out because of idolatry is found in the first king so we're not dead and ephraim we we're familiar with that right dead and ephraim we know their names are blotted out just under heaven not in heaven just under heaven which is another strange mystery i don't know anything about and i don't know anybody that does how your name can be blotted out from under heaven but not in heaven i'm not sure how that works must be a temporary judgment or something like that okay now i want to take this service tonight in the next uh 30 let me do 40 minutes here and i want to go through my remaining quotes that i had found from brother branham and then i want to go uh to back to this preacher that simon and i and cam and i've actually been listening to the pentecostal preacher who first we we heard talk about curses and blessings so i want to get to that and then i want to close with how jesus allows us to go through punishments or temporary curses in order to teach us right in order to humble us so i want to just close with that so that's where you know i'm going by god's grace so i tried to put it all together uh where it seemed like it would fit together so may god help me by god's grace now roman says sometimes sickness is a curse and that's deuteronomy 28 22. i'm going to read that just for uh your sake and my sake deuteronomy 28 22 remember we read through this chapter a couple weeks ago and uh lord willing it was just a beautiful beautiful chapter of blessings curses are are just such a powerful warning against unbelief so deuteronomy 28 22. the lord shall smite thee with a consumption and with a fever and with an inflammation and with an extreme burning and with the sword and with blessing and with mildew and they shall pursue thee until thou perish now church when i was sick with covet i don't know why i was sick i sought god i didn't know if there was anything i need to repent of you know i had my daily battles my mind battles and you know i fall short of god's glory sometimes i get discouraged sometimes i feel sorry for myself maybe i'll battle pride or you know different things i battle but when i was laying in the bed for that two days or a day and a half or two and a half days i i can't get i can't remember i couldn't i could just confess everything and i didn't know why i was sick but i just kept saying it's lying vanity so i personally i don't i didn't feel like i had anything that i'd done wrong maybe it was just a test uh and again uh there was many blessings that came out of it you know brother randy being here brother amen got the fellowship with him quite a bit and but amnesty was really encouraged everybody amen i told him i said brother i said you gotta we gotta find the blessing and everything even though i wasn't here all those four services i said look you got the fellowship with brother randy you probably wouldn't have had that if i was here because i would have been with the preacher right and so he got he was so encouraged you should have saw amen he was he was like lighting up like a light bulb you know uh so i said all things work together for good to them that love the lord and then he said he got the fellowship with brother nathaniel after service you know um so i thought well that's at least one blessing that i can see to come out plus i got to rest at home for a while i got to make that video at home the one about how to receive the holy ghost i got to make that recovering from coven and i got numerous good testimonies back from that people really enjoy that so uh you know i don't know why i search my heart i'm not quite sure but that's one of the curses if you don't obey god is fever consumption right inflammation burning the swords you're getting cut with the sword battle mildew all these things now here's where broadband says it now i know it's really small i wonder i wanted to make this i want to cut what i do is i cut them in half and then i expand the the font size so i'm sorry so i hate to hurt your eyes but i'll read it if his children will only take his word so he can prove it by you so god god needs somebody to prove his word by so he chooses you so if he's going to prove he's a healer who's got to get sick me right you we got to get sick he needs somebody to prove his word by right somebody had to be lost so they could be saved right amen somebody had to be drunken so god can sober him up praise god someone had to be an addict so they could be set free praise god he said that's the only way he can prove his word he doesn't prove it to unbelievers because he says because they can't be proved they're unbelievers but it's not to unbelievers it's not for them believers it's to him that believe and if you can find somebody who believe his work he will prove his word by you amen praise god sometimes sickness and these happen to us that way that god can prove himself how many can say lord help me to humble myself that when i get sick i'll be thankful in it praise god and i can and lord help me to remember that it may be you just trying to get uh or to me to prove your word is true you're just using me as someone who can be a testimony that believes the word is true and you can use me in other words lord borrow my body to do a miracle how many trust god that much praise the lord our brother donnie reagan said i really like that line lord you can borrow my body if you want to fulfill your word i thought wow what a what a humble word that is what a humble attitude that is do you remember the blind man that jesus found they said who sinned he or his father mother in other words who cursed this man right who curses blind men he said in this case neither huh blindness isn't a curse not always but that the works of god might be made known see it happened to the boy so that jesus could be glorified oh god help us to see our trials amen help us to see our difficulties our discouragements our frustrations as an opportunity that christ could be glorified he said this this is the line i love he said sometimes sickness now look at this church this is in 1965 this is uh eight months before he passed sometimes sickness is not a curse it's a blessing yeah i know it takes a lot of faith to say amen to that that's why i didn't hear that many amens right you're bad we're having that mind battle right not the soul battle the soul wants to say amen but it's that mind i don't know about that it's hard to be sick right that's what i say it's hard it's hard to be sick sometimes it's a blessing that we can stick our faith out there and call those things which are not as though they were right like lying vanities like bang taught me that good lesson there god said so and he'll prove it so if you'll just not weaken under the test wow in all of our trials god just wants to be strong under the test to handle and carry the heavy load amen god just wants us to carry the cross praise god to bear the cross he's just asking us to bear the cross a little longer and just hold up with faith i know god's going to bring me up i know god's going to bring me up and then when he does he gets all the glory because church you and i know in our humanity we can't do anything of ourselves right we can't i couldn't make the covet leave any sooner i tried to rebuke it i tried to speak against it of course maybe that helped maybe did bring it out sooner but none of us can do it of our own power we don't have the power to divide healing within ourselves in all resting god but god is fighting and wanting to find somebody he can prove his word on divine healing as the truth praise god boy it's hot in here tonight man i turned up to 70. i shouldn't turn up so high he said he could prove job look he could test job one time that he wouldn't curse him to his face look at the trial that joe went through but down in the very jaws of death yet he said the lord gave the lord take away blessed be the name of the lord he certainly believed that god proved his word to joke he approved it to abraham he proved it so how many want god to prove his word to them amen i do praise god now it's hard to say lord do whatever you want to prove your word to me but i want to say that tonight lord by your grace from my soul do whatever you have to do to prove your word to me and that i can be used to glorify your name amen praise god this next thought is on curses for disobeying the word yeah i think i read this one sunday but let me just read it again deuteronomy 28 14 and 15 if thou shalt not go aside from any of the words which i command thee this day look at that yet obey every word just like jesus said live by some words no live by every word he said to the right hand or to the left to go after other gods to serve them see that's the only reason god says people leave the narrow path is to serve other gods right or to serve their lusts of their flesh or or to serve their their own desires their own will that's the only reason you turn off the narrow way verse 15 but it shall come to pass if thou will not hearken unto the voice of the lord thy god to observe to do all of his commandments and his statutes which i command thee this day that all these curses shall come upon thee and overtake thee now look at that so see in other words uh in other words if you and i if we disobey god and we go off in the wrong path we've got we've got the consequences chasing us right they're gonna overtake us they're gonna hunt us down we're gonna be hunted down i don't think anybody here likes to be hunted down right amen amen but the bible says if we don't obey god diligently those curses are going to overtake us and hunt us down they're going to be like haunting us right we're always going to have that like we know that feeling when we do wrong right and we haven't made it right and we know oh it's going to happen when is it going to happen when am i going to get punished for it you know right children know that especially right children look at my yeah they know right we know as adults we know god doesn't play uh god's gonna correct his children praise god he's not gonna let them get by there's a quote i don't have it here i saw it last week but man said god don't let his children or brother said god's not going to let me get by with any sin i forget which message that was i heard brother say that he said god i think it was restoration of the bride bride tree 62 uh easter lebron said god's not going to let me get by with any sin and so so we cannot turn to the left to the right or to the left we must stay on the narrow road or else those consequences are going to hunt us down right haven consequences are going to hunt us down right now if we if we go outside the path of god the consequences are going to hunt us down we can try to run as much as we want but there's no running from god he uh we know this bible says the sins will find this out right so the scriptural now here's here's the quote i read it on sunday i believe i did this the first bride i think i remember that in the arena on sunday but i just wanted to give you a scripture for it it was uh the one we just read deuteronomy 28 14 15. now the first bride of the human race before husband came to her she fell from grace by listening to satan's life after god had her fortified behind his word if she'd have stayed behind the word she never fell now that's in the natural notice the natural woman and what's the curse the actual curse of coming out from behind god's word so anytime we stray from the path there's going to be a curse overtake us so what's the best suggestion should we keep running uh carrich should we keep running from the curse or should we repent and get back on the narrow road what do you think hon give it a round of applause [Laughter] yeah instead of running from our problems why don't we run to god amen and that's what we as adults that's what we've learned to do that's what children young in the faith that's what they've learned to do rather than running from the problems and having this haunting feeling like they're good stuff is going to get me something rather that let's confess our wrongs and come clean before god and david said he'll restore the joy of my salvation that's why i was telling amen that's why some people they can't smile at church right you know you see some people come in and out or sometimes they're here sometimes they're not you know they come and they never smile why aren't they smiling because their life is curved why aren't they happy because their life is cursed they know they're off the narrow the narrow road they know a punishment's coming down the road so how can they be happy and praise god they can't right if you know trouble's gonna get you are you gonna be happy praising god but if you know you there's nothing between you and the lord and you're expecting the blessing and the protection of god you can be happy in the lord i don't know about you i'd rather be happy coming to church i'd rather confess my sin and don't feel like something there's a dog after me or there's a bounty on my name or something like that i'd rather have the joy of god and the love of christ in my heart to know that there's something that's chasing me it's god's blessings amen like the bible said the blessings will overtake you if you diligently hearken to the voice of god praise god okay so as you see there's always a curse but it tells there's always a curse for stepping off the path of god now we know this is very familiar but it applies to us like it did to israel we saw on sunday when balaam tried to curse him you cannot curse what god is blessed as far as a permanent curse right and anyone who's outside of god's leadership cannot curse who god has blessed right because remember we know rachel right rachel was saved right we believe that with our hearts she produces joseph and benjamin but yet temporarily she was cursed because jacob pronounced it but it was by the leadership of the lord it wasn't jacob's idea it wasn't jacob trying to get back at his wife for you know laban's you know holding withholding it for seven years it wasn't that it was it was god correcting his daughter rachel i know that's hard to say but that's god chastening his daughter that he loves who stole the idols right but what did god pronounce in his word don't take idols right don't hide idols it's that secret sin church is that right it's a secret sin that god despises why hold it in we should take it out before the lord said god purge me and cleanse me make me clean help me to have the joy of the lord help me to stay in your presence help your blessing to remain upon my life but see god didn't curse adam and eve in the beginning right god didn't curse adam he might have done the same thing but he cursed the earth of thorns and thistles look look how gracious god is to adam now i believe the way the scripture says it i believe adam was a negligent and is watching over eve and he let eve walk away to the tree of life that's that's what i think happened and there are some quotes on that where adam wasn't there but then when adam gets back after the fruit's already been eaten he sees her in the condition because the bible puts the blame on adam right in romans the bible puts the blame on adam so i think adam wasn't uh a diligent like he should have been his wife wandered off she got the begow deceived and defiled uh got the wrong seed well he comes back and he sees the condition and then he has to he knows well she's gonna die she's part of me i'll i'll partake in that so i can be with her because he loves her that's the type of christ right taking upon our sin upon him to redeem us okay but notice adam wasn't cursed the ground was cursed amen you and i are not cursed praise god this ground may get cursed amen but not the real you the soul praise god because the real use the soul he didn't curse eve but he said adam would be her ruler look at that she committed such a we would think such an awful act right yet god didn't curse her from now on she ain't trying any preaching or anything adam is a ruler and all the days of your life and sorrow you'll bring your life into the earth and he said but i'll put entity between your seat now she didn't have any seeds she never did have so she had to receive a seed from some way god gave her seed not by uh relation but by creation can't you blind people see that's the sea the serpent oh my satan got there before adam that was the seed but she received a seed what was it god himself he was the beginning of the creation of god amen beautiful scriptures sir quoting them now this was a this was also a curse uh from deuteronomy 8 or 28 18 not being able to have children cursing shall be the fruit of thy body and the fruit of thy land the increase of i kind and the flocks of thy sheep now the church we got to remember not every woman who struggled with bringing forth children was cursed like sarah because it wasn't for that it wasn't for a curse it was for a testimony now there are some women like mike mccow i don't know how to say i know it's not michael because that's michael the archangel i don't actually know the pronunciation for that one mitchell machow mike child i'm not sure but anyways david's wife from saul from saul's uh daughters she was cursed and couldn't have children but that doesn't mean it's every child right remember that remember that story um i believe it was elijah or it's not elijah elijah elijah had he had this he had this route he kept walking well there's a woman there that had a husband she's like hubby can we build on a house for this this prophet of god he's like sure i'll build it you know he built it and then elijah had a little stop a little hotel between his is his preaching locations yeah a little place to stop and one day he got so happy elijah he's like lord i'm going to bless that woman what can i bless her with and the servant gaheza says well she don't have any children right and what does he do he says this time next year you're going to embrace a son thus saith the lord and she did right because it was thus saith the lord now we're not told anything in the scripture that she was cursed now what did she act like did she act like she was cursed or did she act like she was blessed i know about you but anybody that would want to bless a holy ghost preacher you're blessed right a cursed person wouldn't want to do that right so it seems no i'm not saying it's absolute but it seems this woman wasn't cursed it just seemed it was for the glory of god now after the child died remember what the woman said she ran up to elijah go through gahey's and said did i ask for this child so it doesn't even look like she was cursed she's like i didn't even ask for this child so maybe it wasn't the plan of god you know or maybe it wasn't the curse of god but she said this was i didn't even ask for this child elijah and so remember what he did he went in there he laid on him and breathed on him knocked him out face to face talking about mouth-to-mouth resuscitation there and he sneezed seven times and the boy came back to life and he presented his son here's your here's your void mom right what a powerful testimony that is but see there's an example where we don't get anything from the scripture where she's cursed so the reason i'm saying that is let's not jump to conclusions with curses and blessings now i shared some a few weeks ago and i need to clarify that like different people i've known that have fallen away from the message i didn't know for sure it was curse it just looks like a curse so the reason i share that is to give a warning because the bible says i'm to warn all men and a lot of those same uh the same things you see in these lives of these preachers that fall it's the same thing we read in deuteronomy 28 with curses and that's the same thing got trouble you know all this uh all kinds of trouble physical trouble spiritual trouble and it's just it's all kinds of trouble all because they start compromising on the word of god and they almost they basically blaspheme brother branham are they they say such evil words that would never come out of a a real saints mouth right they marry people two or three times they enjoy rock and roll they listen to rock and roll you know now and they used to be in the message i mean some of these things just they don't add up so what i'm saying is that uh we got to be careful not to jump to conclusions but with mchow or my child we know god did curse her okay brother man says it like this in part and he said saul's daughter seemed to be very much embarrassed at that man's action her husband her young handsome husband had cut up and misbehaved himself in her presence see to her it was misbehavior but to david he's like i was before god i wasn't dancing for you darling i was dancing for god hallelujah praise god he said uh the king's daughter david said if you don't like that watch this a little while i love that and around and around the arky went again dancing the spear and she was embarrassed and god cursed that woman with the curse because she was embarrassed about her hubby dancing around the church oh the victory through the blood of jesus christ the token of the resurrection of christ his life lives within his church there's no other way of fellowship under but under that blood our denominations will separate us one will say that's nonsense one will say this one will say the other aren't you glad that we can be happy in the lord and we can rejoice in the holy spirit praise god don't be ever be embarrassed if somebody's trying to worship god from the depths of their soul amen i always pray that constantly god help our church to be more free in the spirit i think every pastor would pray that don't you any real pastor with a heart for the people i we don't we don't want to be bound up we want to be free we know everybody expresses it different though you know we understand that but we don't want we don't ever want to be embarrassed if somebody does get a little free or a lot free right we're not going to be embarrassed by that we want to be encouraged by that praise god because the bible says god will curse people if they're embarrassed by holy ghost worship oh my god help us god help the message churches right including us god help all of us is what i'm saying because we don't want to get so stiff and starchy where we couldn't want to rejoice in the holy spirit praise god glory now uh believers have power to curse and bless right so deuteronomy 28 18. you know what i think i forgot to i that that shouldn't be there so i'm sorry i forgot to i copied i duplicated the slide i forgot to delete that scripture because that scripture says cursed me the fruit of thy body the fruit thy land the increase of thy kind and the flocks thy sheep yes i just i forgot to leave that forgive me so here's where jesus says verily i say unto you whatsoever ye shall bind on earth now bind means to tie up so jesus said you can tie things up in prayer and by speaking the word or throw into chains you can chain things up isn't that something your prayers can chain up the enemy right the enemy wants to hop and jump on your family right he wants to hop and jump on you then he wants to spread and create division of church you and i church we have power to bind the enemy to tie him up right whatever you bind whatever you cast into chains on earth will be bound in heaven whatsoever he shall loose and that means to loosen dissolve or unbind shall be loose in heaven praise god so whatever you tie up whatever you limit whatever you hinder will be stopped but whatever you lose will be let go and let free now these preachers on tv they always release anointing they release a blessing right they release this they release that they release so many things on them i'm not even sure if they can remember how many things they released uh but i guess in one way church i do that in one way i always pray a blessing over you right at the end of the service i pray bless the saints of god strengthen them answer their prayers help them what am i trying to do i'm trying to loose the blessings of god on you praise god if you'll obey and if i'll obey but see church we got the power to bind and stop things from moving now for us it might be like with sickness right we want to stop a sickness before it gets to our family i know my wife and i would probably say amen on that one right because then it goes from one child to the next and then yeah yeah everybody's sick uh but that that would be one example where you want to bind you want to stop something and uh make sure it doesn't impact other people you know i've i've preached this before i've you know when i've gone other places jesus said uh jesus told that evil spirit to to leave go to dry places and never return so i've encouraged people to do that especially people that are addicted like cigarettes or alcohol or something like that i've encouraged them when you rebuke that spirit bind it tie it up and send it away so it can't come back praise god amen and that's the kind of faith we've got to have right in other words i'll never go back to that i'll never do that again i bind that spirit in jesus christ's name that's real faith right that's what he's talking about here binding it or with healing i loose this person from their infirmity in jesus christ's name in other words i cast out that spirit in jesus christ's name and again i say to you that if two of you that's why i read this earlier i quoted earlier if two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask it shall be done for them of my father which is in heaven now of course remember this has to be according to god's will right everything we always got to remember that it always has to be according to god's will okay and let me read a quote from uh works as faith expressed he said if you can't believe it it just won't happen now i can't make you believe neither can you make yourself believe so church give yourself license not to give yourself a hard time okay well i just don't have enough faith well brown said you can't make yourself believe he said god has to give it to you it's a gift of god to believe now if you're turning down god's gift that's a different story right now he said not your faith it's god's faith your intellectual faith might believe it fine but unless the faith of god is down in your heart see and just keep believing it with all your heart until god does reveal it to you keep believing it until god does reveal it amen so see don't get down on yourself if you don't have the faith yet now if you've got sin in your life and that's the reason you don't have faith yeah get rid of the sin but if your life is clean your life is pure you don't see any curses on your life and you confess everything's under the blood and you don't have you feel you feel like the gift of faith to believe it yet he said keep believing it with all your heart until god gives you that gift amen praise god the wrath says no matter how religious you are or how good or bad you are unless the grace of god drops into your heart you'll never get well so i i told that to brother matt lightner last time he was here i said he said i'm stuck on divine healing you've got any suggestions i said yes listen to work is faith expressed that is brother rams pinnacle message on divine healing you just learn more and more and more and that's the pinnacle revelation on divine healing you can't force yourself to believe don't get down on yourself if the revelation hasn't dropped yet it's got to be a gift from god it has to be a gift from god right and it's if you've got to get the divine healing then even then you still got to wait for god to tell you to believe to or to god to drop it down your heart to to believe it and know that it's going to happen you have to wait on god it's a constant waiting on god it's waiting for god's inspiration now look at this peter called to remembrance and said behold master behold the fig tree which thou cursest is withered away and jesus answering saith on him have faith in god wow so it takes faith to curse something now faith what is faith faith is a revelation of the will of god so you have to have a gift right a gift or a revelation from god to know god's will before you curse something right and i'm still looking at the curses i remember a few week months ago i cursed the spirits that were battling my dad and mom i'm still waiting on that i'm still waiting on that because i didn't feel i didn't plan to do that church either i was off in the flesh or just emotional or that was god so i'm still waiting but program teaches us if you can't wait a week then you really don't have faith if you can't wait a month you don't have faith if you can't wait a year you really don't have faith because abraham waited 25 years so see i'm just waiting on that i didn't plan to say it i had no idea i was going to say that and so i'm just waiting to see if god is going to bring the victory in this season right because we had to wait what we had to wait april may wait wait two months for van's dad to get well but the very the very morning the very morning after he died and they brought him back i said he's going to be well and he's going to come out of the hospital in the name of jesus christ well it took two months to manifest they took vang raising in faith right and going and getting the prayer cloth it took jose bringing that prayer call from brother branham it took all these things had to work together in order to receive god's blessing and who is glorified in all that jesus christ jesus christ he does all this for his glory he said so look he connects cursing and faith they're so close together faith to curse in other words faith to bind right faith to mind or faith to lose that's connected together for verily i said to you whatsoever you shall say this mountain be thou removed okay so now we're starting to see what curses are it's speaking to it right or blessing something speaking to it or cursing it so when when we speak to the mountain to move we're cursing that mountain right we're removing that mountain and be thou cast in the sea and shall not doubt in his heart and shall believe that those things which he says shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he said but don't forget the other quote my man said you can believe all day but until it drops down as god's will it ain't gonna happen let's finish the scripture yeah now look how he connects it look how forgiveness right look how forgiveness is connected to faith and curses and blessings therefore i say to you whatsoever things you desire when you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them so you gotta have faith you gotta have a revelation it's god's will to do it and when you stand praying forgive if you have ought against any that your father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses but if you do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses so see brother tell us how can you have faith when you've got sin in your heart against somebody first john talks about that right if my heart condemns me i'm not going to get what i asked for but if my heart condemned me not then god hears me so jesus connects it together when you're blessing when you're cursing when you're binding when you're losing we got to have the right heart attitude about it and our lives must be in diligent obedience to the word of god all right now i love this scripture here and when he called on him his twelve disciples he gave them power against unclean spirits to cast them out and to heal how many diseases oh so church we should pray about every disease every sickness we can pray about it and all how many diseases all manner of diseases all sickness all diseases he gave his disciples power over that and we have the same today by god's grace right like other man said just believe it speak it until the grace drops down praise the lord little children let no man deceive you he that does does righteous is righteous even as he is righteous he that committed sinners of the devil for the devil sinner from the beginning for this purpose was the son of god manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil okay so christ was meant christ became unveiled to destroy satan's works and not just the sin debt right but also the sickness right the mental trouble the insanity right all these curses the addictions jesus was manifested to destroy all those things and he does it by speaking the word amen by binding by loosing he uh pronounces a blessing instead of a curse and he curses what is cursed wow look at that jesus curses what is cursed those demons are cursed right so he curses them and he commands them to leave he curses the curse whosoever is born of god does not commit sin for his seed remains in him he cannot sin because he's born of god amen what encouragement jesus purpose was to destroy satan's works right and our soul is remaining anointed by god and we can have confidence if we confess all of our sins then the word of god will flow out of our soul right and he'll speak god's word and accomplish god's purpose in our lives amen now i read this a few no i'm sorry i didn't read this one so brother is preaching the token he's in the prayer line lord jesus i'm walking off this platform down here to identify myself with these brothers i'm identifying myself with them as we're all holding our tokens in our hands and in our hearts that's the holy ghost as we obey your command to lay hands on the sick they shall recover may every person passing through here present their token that they have received the holy ghost that they are born again child of god that they believe it with all their heart and as they pass through may they he didn't say i may they curse that disease and affliction of their body may everybody bring your token in your hand i got a token up here not really but i guess the oil is a good example may every person bring their token and as they get prayed for may they curse the disease that's on them in other words may they speak to the mountain that it moves or may you bind it and tie it up i i curse this coven right i bind this and i cast it away in jesus christ's name or whatever it is you got to have your token you got to know that you're a child of god that god doesn't have anything against me because i'm forgiven praise god i'm a child of god yes i am praise god i am who you god says i am i have a seed of god within me and it cannot sin i'm a child of god amen he said bring your token and curse that disease that's on you curse it command it to go bind it up i'd stop the movement of this sickness i stop the movement and i curse it in jesus christ's name and i'm going to believe it with all my heart until it manifests amen praise god not i curse it they curse it the church we got power to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease isn't that what the third pole is to do is to operate in the bride right the bride to speak the word of god the bride to have uh the mountains move praise god here's another one i know you'd like to see it that's why i got it i know you like to see it's okay bring the lady how do you do a pretty little girl she's awful little to have female trouble do you believe jesus will make you well that dear god this little girl i curse this enemy while in the presence of jesus christ may i leave her may she be well in jesus name amen bless you honey you'll be all right now look what a short prayer that was sometimes we think we got to pray for an hour right brother and just simply had the gift of divine healing get to discernment he just simply curse i curse this female trouble in jesus christ and god bless you honey i was a texan with a sister from alabama one who's uh one who's editing my next book and uh one of the saints in the church passed away this week and she was in brother ramsey's meetings and brother brandon discerned her out of the audience and told her you've got the stomach trouble all these things thus saith the lord and god healed her i thought my we're just is it awesome to hear about the witnesses and testimonies then that now these soldiers are going off so we need god to move in our lives so we can say i wasn't there but the same holy spirit that was there healed me too praise god i just was so encouraged by that because this makes me think of that like look at all all of the faith in god's servant his prophet do you believe now a dark shadow moves up death a cancer is not god can you kill cancer make it well you bleed out with all your heart do you believe he's going to make you well for in jesus in the name of jesus christ i curse this cursed thing he curses the cursed thing under that crossed fishes may the cross of christ take it away may it go in jesus name so he's he's binding it and then loosing it from her right loosing it may go in jesus name don't doubt go believe with all your heart amen if thou can't believe all things are possible was that a long hour prayer meeting or anything there's nothing against that church we need more of that praise god but look at this look how simple curse you know binding and loosing is look how simple it is just go and do what just go and believe just go and believe just believe i honor the word the word says lay hands on the sicker they shall recover i believe i believe there's about 40 minutes i just got a few more slides though that's my famous last words ryan that's right no i really only got a few more i think yeah i got more than a few okay now these are reviewed remember the blood of jesus christ already set us free from every curse in other words it already paid the price already paid for our freedom in other words he took every curse so we can be free from it now just remember the scripture now remember it's uh it's galatians three curses is everyone that continueth not right and jesus christ has redeemed us we are bought from the curse in other words church we are taken away from the curse we're not living in the land of the curse we're living in the land of the blessed praise god he has redeemed us out of the pawnshop praise god i'm not for sale right the devil wants to jump on us i'll use him we're not even in the pawn shop praise god we're at the master's table hallelujah he's redeeming out of the shop and i'm sitting at the master's table come and dine the master caller come and die so jesus went to the pawn shop for us praise god he went to the pawn shop to be sold right and killed and he was made a curse that what that what might come upon you the blessing hallelujah might come on us through jesus christ that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith praise god i only have faith in christ tonight how many have faith that christ took your curse that you might be blessed if you believe that's that's your your inheritance now i read this one on in part one i read this one in part one so i'll skip down here you have assurance that uh you have everything you need of in this journey is providing that token of his suffering at calvary where he met the price of every curse that could be put on you that token speaks peace so in other words you come up for prayer you've got the holy ghost token not not oil the real spiritual oil but you come up holding that i've got peace i've got peace i'm a child of god the blessing of god is on me i jesus paid for my healing jesus paid for my healing and then he says now you believe it and you curse your sickness right buying that up i'm buying i i tie up that uh whatever it is i type the coven i type the cancer i tie up uh tuberculosis i tied up and i said i cast it away i sent it away in the name of jesus christ and i'm leaving here i'm believing with all my heart so when i get in the car i'm not doubting i'm still believing in the car i'm still believing when i get home even if i'm hurting right or even if i'm hurting wherever you're hurting i'm still with all my heart he said go and be happy go go and sing going rejoicing and praise the lord i'm healed of cancer just by somebody praying for you and you holding your token there because jesus took the curse jesus took the curse of cancer for me so i don't have to have cancer anymore talk about faith that's real faith okay now i'm going to skip past some of these here because of time i told myself oh yeah 35 minutes i'll be done yeah definitely and now i'm at 45. so i can say let me uh skip ahead i just kind of want to get to this yeah i this was really special scripture look how close i think i've preached something on this line before look how close paul put the blessings and the curses now this is to the corinthians remember they were they a book of acts church yeah did they have a lot of trouble yes they had a lot of trouble did they have a lot of blessings yeah they had a lot of gifts of the holy spirit too but look all the brother and greet you greet you another with a holy kiss the salutation of me paul with my own head if any man love not the lord jesus christ let him be an anathema which is a curse any man oh we don't believe in curses in the new testament though jess you don't paul cursed anybody who didn't love christ in other words anybody that doesn't love the truth he cursed him well that's because that's what god said in the old testament right god had already said it so he's just repeating what god already said that continues in the new testament if any man love not our lord jesus christ let him be cursed cursive maranatha our lord cometh so see they're cursed because our lord is coming and looking and blessed the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you my love be with you all in christ jesus amen this is uh you know he's ending the letter so he ends it curse anybody that doesn't believe in christ and bless all the rest you with peace see god god god's not a dirty grandpa right everybody should believe in jesus christ is that right the bible said god searches all the earth his eyes run to and fro around the earth looking for those who believe in him looking for those that will put their confidence in so paul clearly he just simply says cursed me anybody that doesn't love this truth but god's peace upon those that do aren't you glad you can have peace tonight i'm glad i got paul's blessing tonight and not paul's curse because i love the lord jesus christ let's all say that let's all say i love the lord jesus christ ready i love the lord jesus christ his blessing is peace is upon us if we don't love him his curse is upon us and the best part is he's coming again by god's grace and all these wrongs are going to be made right now i'm going to close with this so i've read this gentleman's book now he passed away back in i think 2004 2005. he's a pentecostal preacher uh but i read his book it was a beautiful book his praying uh changing nations through praying and fasting and he had some powerful testimonies where he prayed for nations and god he would pray he would pray curses off of nations and there were some african nations he named in there and he listed the dates they prayed and the dates the government changed uh he also prayed for the united kingdom as well in great britain and just great victories that came about through his prayer and fasting now here's another one he said there was a curse he found a curse on u.s presence that's why so many were assassinated and he said he went to ronald reagan and he said they prayed for ronald reagan that the curses would leave the curse of assassination would leave the presidents and he got shot i think a week later but he didn't die and he said since then and then he lived what that was other than 20 20 years later he lived 25 years later and no presents had been assassinated since so i thought wow that was pretty powerful now this this this man i've listened to many times i sense a really good spirit he's got a good spirit course he didn't believe the message but he has a really good spirit and so he said he said thousands of people would be set free when he would preach on blessings and cursings and so i want to show you this is his prayer that he got uh he got inspired by the holy spirit to have the people speak out loud at the end of these services where he deal with them and he said thousands of people were set free from curses now we're going to read through it but just look how simple it is in other words all you have to do is confess any any sin that you have confess any sin that you have right anybody you have anything against get any evil thing out of your house right which to us would be what common sense but because these denominational people had didn't have the message teaching it was like new to them it was like fresh revelation oh wow i shouldn't play the ouija board oh you mean i got to forgive my wife i got to forgive my husband i mean i can't speak badly against my mom or dad no you can't you can't do that and be blessed and so look at this prayer that apparently thousands of people oh i must have did it on two days ago okay i wrote just go here's the prayer look at this prayer church lord jesus i believe you're the son of god the only way to god that you die on the cross for my sins and rose again from the dead kind of sounds like the sinner's prayer and church when i listen to it i hear people shouting rejoicing in his meetings i think a lot of those people are just getting saved for the first time because i don't think a lot of they went to church but i don't even think many of them are saved but he leads them in this prayer to get saved and get the curses off them he said i renounce all my sins and i turn to you lord jesus for mercy and for forgiveness i believe you do forgive me from now on i want to live for you i want to hear your voice and do what you tell me isn't this diligently obeying all the word of god in order to receive your blessing lord and to be released from any curse over my life first i confess all known sin committed by me or by any of my ancestors i don't know if you have to go that far i honestly don't know if you have to go that far or others related to me confess those specific sins but one thing that just came to mind was daniel remember when daniel before he met the angel he confessed all the sins of israel he said our fathers and our leaders and everybody now that might be different because it's the old testament i don't know and then he said then he gives them a pause he says now confess those in a whisper to the holy spirit confess all your sins lord i thank you and i believe you have forgiven everything i've confessed and lord now i want to say i also forgive all others who have harmed me or wronged me now look so if you haven't forgive somebody you have a spirit of bitterness you have a demon in your mind right the bible said neither give place to the devil if you can't forgive anybody you've got a demon influencing you you've got a curse on your life but what is he saying he's showing you you have to forgive everybody then god forgives you just like we read tonight what jesus said and these should be common sense to christians right remember when nathaniel was here what do you say a little leaven leavens the hole up right and when all the leavens out what do you get the fullness of the godhead bowling is that right that things we hear we hear the message right year after year after year but these people may not have heard it but we should know better in the message right we do that should be common sense for a lot of these people we're just church members they're proud to study their bible but i'll tell you these will work too for you tonight amen i believe they have all my heart they'll work for the listeners i look they'll work for anybody if you really pray a prayer like this and you mean it and get down to business with god god will hear you i forgive them all now as i would have god forgive me in particular i forgive and he says name those specific people my dad my mom my brother my uncle my grandpa specifically name the people you need to forgive say it out loud furthermore lord i renounce any contact by myself or any related to me with satan right or the occult power in any form or any kind of secret society also lord i commit myself to remove from my house any kind of occult objects that honor satan and dishonor jesus christ with your help lord i will remove them all and now lord jesus i thank you further that on the cross you were made a curse that i might be redeemed from a curse and receive the blessing and because of what you did for me on the cross i now release myself i don't know if you can do that but i think what it means is like i now bind or i now loose myself from every curse and every evil influence and every dark shadow over me or my family from any source whatever i release myself now in the name of jesus christ amen let's end our feet saints in church i've listened to numerous of his sermons and when he says that the people just they just shout and rejoice it's like a happy shout and clap he said he would he would see people pray that he said their faces would literally transform right before his eyes to happiness and joy the blessing would start so fast when people just forgive when they just can forgive those who sinned against them but church isn't that the daily prayer right didn't jesus say help me to forgive others as you forgive me isn't that the daily prayer the lord's prayer see so these people that you know god thank god they're getting victory but for some reason they must have not known the lord's prayer we and if they did they they didn't know it they were living in iniquity right but every day we should pray that father forgive them for they don't know what they're doing and forgive me if i have any debts against anybody forgive me lord musicians you can come so this is the prayer we want to you know simon i talked about last night we're hoping that he can pray with my father so i know my father has he he can probably list he can probably list this many people that he needs to forgive that have hurt him but let's not just leave this message for my dad let's apply it to our lives as well so let's buy our heads here see if you better hear me o lord and i'll be healed save me and i'll be saved the church is just closing down tonight [Music] to me this is [Music] this contains it all i believe jesus christ everything you've done died raised renounce all my sin and i let you forgive
