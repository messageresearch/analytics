[0:13] the third Bible guideline is where
[0:16] clothing that pertains to your gender if
[0:19] you're a man you should wear men's
[0:20] clothing if you're a woman you should
[0:22] wear women's clothing the following
[0:24] scriptures teach on this guideline
[0:27] Deuteronomy 225 and Hebrews 4
[0:32] 15 the woman shall not wear that which
[0:34] pertaineth unto a man neither shall a
[0:37] man put on a woman's garment for all
[0:39] though that do so are an Abomination
[0:41] unto the Lord thy
[0:44] God this is an Old Testament scripture
[0:47] but you must recall that Jesus never
[0:48] crossdressed like a woman we come to
[0:51] this conclusion because the Bible
[0:52] teaches Jesus never broke one
[0:55] commandment in the Old Testament and
[0:57] crossdressing was strictly forbidden in
[0:59] the law of Moses in the Old
[1:01] Testament for we have not an high priest
[1:04] which cannot be touched with the feeling
[1:05] of our infirmities but was in all points
[1:08] tempted like as we are yet without
[1:11] sin furthermore this means Jesus
[1:14] instituted the New Testament and the
[1:16] kingdom of God upon this Earth while
[1:19] upholding the truth that men and women
[1:21] should dress different with separate
[1:23] clothing separate clothing for men and
[1:25] women is a teaching we must follow in
[1:28] the New Testament because Jesus modeled
[1:30] and lived this standard before us when
[1:32] he brought out the New
[1:34] Testament these scriptures prove that
[1:37] God-fearing obedient Jewish men and
[1:39] women had separate inner and outer
[1:41] garments in the days of Jesus Jesus was
[1:44] one of those God-fearing obedient
[1:46] followers of the law of Moses in the
[1:49] days of Jesus men and women could be
[1:51] easily differentiated visually just by
[1:54] looking at their outer clothing this is
[1:56] the way God wanted his Society to
[1:58] operate a society with defined god-given
[2:01] roles easily determined by gender and
[2:04] outer
[2:06] clothing when gender and clothing
[2:08] becomes hard to determine a state of
[2:10] confusion occurs which is a state of
[2:12] Babble and God is not the author of
[2:15] confusion according to 1 Corinthians
[2:18] 14:33 this obvious confusion was
[2:21] recently manifested in 2015 when Bruce
[2:24] Jenner publicly came out as being
[2:26] transgender and changed his name to
[2:28] Caitlyn this act was both widely praised
[2:31] and heavily
[2:32] scrutinized according to the Bible in
[2:34] Deuteronomy 22:5 we believe God
[2:37] considers this act an Abomination
[2:40] because a man Bruce Jenner is wearing
[2:42] the clothes of a woman what most people
[2:44] do not realize though is that this same
[2:47] public scrutiny that Bruce Jenner
[2:49] received partly for his crossdressing as
[2:51] a woman was the same public scrutiny
[2:53] that women such as Marlene Dietrich and
[2:56] Katherine hebburn receed for wearing
[2:58] pants and dressing as men in the 1930s
[3:01] and 1940s which was not even a 100 years
[3:04] ago the undeniable history of the
[3:06] scrutiny of women crossdressing by
[3:08] wearing pants has been fully documented
[3:10] by many resources one of which includes
[3:13] the book women in pants by Katherine
[3:15] Smith and Cynthia grig here is a simple
[3:18] visual to show what modern-day modesty
[3:20] should look like according to the Bible
[3:23] in society today we believe men should
[3:25] wear shirts and pants and women should
[3:27] wear long dresses or blouses and long
[3:31] skirts today's American society is
[3:34] quickly becoming a complete and total
[3:36] perversion of God standard for separate
[3:38] clothing for the entire history of our
[3:41] country the majority of men and women
[3:43] obeyed the Bible guideline of separate
[3:45] clothing for men and
[3:48] women it wasn't until the 1970s that it
[3:51] became socially acceptable for women to
[3:53] wear
[3:58] pants please watch the video long
[4:00] dresses in the Bible for an in-depth
[4:03] study into these
[4:06] facts the fourth and final Bible
[4:08] guideline is we should wear clothes on
[4:11] earth like Jesus wears in heaven which
[4:14] are loose long and flowing
[4:18] clothes the following scriptures that
[4:20] teach this guideline are Revelation 1113
[4:24] Revelation 79 and14 and Luke
[4:28] 11:2 as stated earlier scripture teaches
[4:31] we should at least cover the area from
[4:32] the chest or breast all the way down to
[4:35] the thighs for those body parts are
[4:37] nakedness in the sight of God while God
[4:40] is well pleased when we cover those body
[4:41] parts as seen in this visual we also
[4:44] feel the Heavenly example of Jesus
[4:46] covering his body down to the feet
[4:48] should be taken into consideration by
[4:50] Spirit-filled Christians today true
[4:53] Christians desire to stay as far away
[4:55] from sin as possible in an effort to
[4:57] keep anyone from stumbling this is why
[5:00] we encourage all Christians to pray and
[5:02] seek God's face to see whether God would
[5:04] have them to cover more of their legs
[5:06] even down to their feet as to follow the
[5:09] Heavenly example of the Lord Jesus
[5:12] Christ in Revelation 1:3 St John the
[5:16] disciple whom Jesus loved saw a vision
[5:19] of Jesus in his glorified body as
[5:21] Supreme deity Jesus was clothed in a
[5:24] garment down to the
[5:27] foot and in the midst of the seven
[5:29] candles sticks one like unto the son of
[5:31] man clothed with a garment down to the
[5:33] foot and gir about the paps with a
[5:36] golden
[5:37] girdle notice that Jesus was not showing
[5:40] off toned muscular arms abs legs and
[5:44] thighs like many people do today he was
[5:47] not showing off any body part Jesus was
[5:50] clothed in a modest
[5:52] way if Jesus Christ chooses to gladly
[5:55] wear modest clothing in heaven that
[5:57] covers his body all the way down to his
[5:59] ankles then we want to lovingly follow
[6:02] his example here on Earth and wear
[6:04] clothes down to our feet
[6:07] today Jesus taught us to pray and say
[6:10] let it be done on Earth as it is in
[6:12] heaven when we wear modest clothes that
[6:15] cover our bodies even down to our ankles
[6:18] we are letting the clothing style of
[6:19] Heaven come down to
[6:24] earth Jesus is the great Shepherd
[6:27] according to Hebrews 13: 20 he leads the
[6:31] way for the sheep to follow Jesus as a
[6:33] man models complete modesty and Holiness
[6:36] in the clothing he wears this means that
[6:39] all men and women today should follow in
[6:41] the example Jesus left and wear modest
[6:44] clothing at all times in our opinion
[6:47] that's the real Measure of a Man he
[6:49] leads the way for modesty for Holiness
[6:52] in every aspect of his life he does not
[6:55] ask the women to do something that he
[6:57] does not do himself if we read further
[7:00] in the Book of Revelation we find that
[7:02] all Christians that are washed in the
[7:04] blood of Jesus will wear white robes in
[7:06] heaven and these robes extend to the
[7:09] feet and I said unto him sir thou
[7:11] knowest and he said to me these are they
[7:14] which came out of Great Tribulation and
[7:16] have washed their robes and made them
[7:18] white in the blood of the
[7:21] Lamb if we are going to spend all
[7:23] eternity with modest robes that cover
[7:26] our bodies according to the command and
[7:28] design of God God himself then we're
[7:31] happy to start wearing the same type of
[7:32] modest clothing right now the Greek word
[7:35] for robes means a loose outer garment
[7:38] for men extending to the
[7:41] feet so this scripture provides yet
[7:43] another witness that we must seek to
[7:45] cover as much of our bodies as possible
[7:48] whether we are male or
[7:50] female in closing we pray that your
[7:53] prayer will be something like this Lord
[7:56] help me to dress modestly since it is
[7:58] your new testament Bible command forgive
[8:01] me of dressing immodestly I want to
[8:03] change my life completely I want to
[8:05] please you in everything making my body
[8:08] a living sacrifice for you perfecting
[8:10] Holiness in the fear of God I love you
[8:13] dear Jesus and I know that without
[8:15] Holiness no man shall see you because
[8:17] you're the Lord I want your Bible to be
[8:20] my guideline for how I dress I will not
[8:23] look to Hollywood or anyone else for my
[8:25] standard I will look to Jesus and his
[8:27] example as taught through the Holy Bible
[8:31] if you would like more Bible teaching
[8:32] about modest clothing and also more
[8:34] historical references about the changes
[8:37] in clothing in the United States please
[8:39] contact
[8:40] us God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[8:44] the desire of your
[8:45] [Music]
[8:56] heart
