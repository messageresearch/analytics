[0:02] God expects his children to trust him
[0:04] for everything that they
[0:07] have but we want to trust the hand of
[0:11] man I'd rather have my hopes built in
[0:15] Christ taking my solemn stand upon on
[0:18] his grace and
[0:19] mercy than any educated group of people
[0:23] who would form an organization say this
[0:25] is the way Christ said I am the way
[0:31] the truth and the light amen and no man
[0:33] cometh through the father except he
[0:36] comes by
[0:39] Me Jesus said he was the truth amen so
[0:44] you cannot have truth till you have
[0:47] Jesus how do you get him by being borned
[0:50] again but you can't have truth till you
[0:53] have Jesus you can't have be in the way
[0:55] until you're in Jesus how do you get
[0:57] into him by one Spirit we're all bap
[1:00] ties into one body then you're in Jesus
[1:03] then you're in the way then you're in
[1:05] the
[1:05] truth Jesus said I am the way the truth
[1:09] and another thing the third thing Jesus
[1:12] we have come to him he's the only light
[1:14] there is it's right all we want to
[1:17] differ with that but it's true Jesus is
[1:21] the only light there is you say I'm a
[1:24] russellite camelite whatever you might
[1:26] be it's a false
[1:28] light you might be in the russellite
[1:31] church you might be in the camelite
[1:32] church or some other light church but
[1:34] until you get in Jesus you're not in
[1:36] light you're still in darkness amen you
[1:39] don't have light till you come to him
[1:41] for he is the way the truth and the
[1:43] light and the only way to God no man
[1:47] cometh to the father except by me so you
[1:49] can't go to God you can't go to heaven
[1:51] you have to get in the way and Jesus is
[1:53] that way he is the only truth that there
[1:56] is and he's the only light the only true
[1:59] light
[2:00] the only true manifested light is Jesus
[2:03] Christ amen we have Marmon light we have
[2:05] Methodist light we have Baptist light we
[2:07] have Pentecostal light we have all kinds
[2:09] of lights but Jesus is the True Light
[2:12] amen he's the only
[2:16] light now we read in St John the 10th
[2:19] chapter Jesus said I am the door to the
[2:26] Sheepfold I am the door amen
[2:30] not a door the door am the only
[2:36] door I am the way amen the only way the
[2:42] truth and the life and no man cometh
[2:45] unto the father but by
[2:47] me amen I am the door to the Sheepfold
[2:53] and all that comes before me is enemies
[2:57] thieves and
[2:58] robbers he is the
[3:02] door to the
[3:04] Sheepfold he is the door to
[3:08] Salvation there's not another name given
[3:11] under heaven whereby you must be saved
[3:15] only through the name of Jesus Christ
[3:18] Hallelujah no church no denomination no
[3:21] Creed no doctrines of anything only
[3:24] through Jesus name Hallelujah that is
[3:29] the that is is the
[3:30] key amen no wonder if Peter could use
[3:34] one of them on the day of Pentecost they
[3:37] wanted to know how to get into that door
[3:40] he used the key and there's only one
[3:45] key because there's just one
[3:48] door I am the
[3:51] door and Peter had the key to it and he
[3:54] said repent every one of you and be
[3:58] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[4:00] the remission of your sin and you shall
[4:03] receive the treasures of God
[4:06] Amen it's the key to the door in Jesus
[4:10] is the
[4:11] door there's only one door to healing
[4:16] and Jesus is that door
[4:20] Peace my peace I give unto you he's only
[4:25] one door to genuine peace Hallelujah you
[4:29] might think you got peace you might
[4:32] accumulate enough money to buy your home
[4:35] you might accumulate enough money to get
[4:38] your children clothes have food to eat
[4:42] but you might have uh accumulate enough
[4:44] popularity to be popular amongst people
[4:48] but when you slip off your shoes at
[4:52] night am and get ready to lay down
[4:57] there's only one thing can give you
[5:00] peace that is if you know you were dying
[5:03] that night there's only one peace and
[5:07] that's Jesus is the peace oh
[5:11] Hallelujah he is our
[5:14] peace
