[0:03] for Apostles prophets teachers pastors
[0:05] evangelists for the perfecting of the
[0:07] church then pastors and teachers and so
[0:10] forth will be so with the word until the
[0:13] whole thing will work right up to the
[0:14] coming of the
[0:17] Lord greetings friends in the matchless
[0:19] name of the Lord Jesus Christ did God's
[0:22] Prophet William brandham have all five
[0:24] preaching gifts I believe the answer is
[0:26] yes by the grace of God this video will
[0:28] show the quotes that prove that
[0:30] just as St Paul had all five preaching
[0:32] gifts hi friends I'm Jesse Smith pastor
[0:35] Bri of Christ Fellowship here in akan
[0:37] Ohio USA and I defend the original
[0:39] Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ that he
[0:41] revealed to St Paul and then had to
[0:43] restore through Martin Luther John
[0:45] Wesley and the late Prophet William
[0:47] Marin brandham who lived from 1909 to
[0:50] 1965 let's begin with the life of St
[0:52] Paul and again prove how he had all five
[0:55] preaching gifts and he just was led by
[0:57] the spirit to move into each gift or
[1:01] preaching Channel as the Holy Ghost
[1:02] directed him it seems by God's grace
[1:05] that the Holy Ghost would lead a man
[1:06] like St Paul and brother brandham to
[1:08] transition into different gifts when the
[1:11] Holy Ghost wanted to use that man in
[1:13] that particular Ministry so St Paul was
[1:16] no doubt an apostle Romans 1 ver1 tells
[1:19] us that Paul a servant of Jesus Christ
[1:21] called to be an apostle separated un the
[1:23] gospel of God St Paul was a prophet in 1
[1:27] Thessalonians 4:1
[1:28] 15-17 he says for this we say unto you
[1:32] by the word of the Lord so Paul
[1:34] prophesied of the catching up or the
[1:36] Rapture the pre-tribulation Rapture of
[1:39] the Bride of Jesus Christ Paul was the
[1:41] first pastor at Ephesus according to
[1:43] acts
[1:44] 20:31 Paul said he taught them the full
[1:47] counsel of God in Acts chapter 20 and
[1:48] then ceased not to warn everyone Night
[1:51] and Day With Tears by the space of three
[1:53] years so Paul was the pastor 3 years in
[1:56] Ephesus Paul was a teacher in 1 Timothy
[1:59] 2 s he said a teacher of the Gentiles in
[2:03] faith and Varity and Paul also did
[2:06] evangelism acts
[2:08] 15:36 Paul said unto Barnabas let us go
[2:11] again and visit our brethren in every
[2:12] city where we have preached the word of
[2:14] the Lord and see how they do so now we
[2:17] can see a Biblical precedent for a man
[2:19] having all five preaching gifts let's
[2:20] look at the life of brother brandham and
[2:22] I tried to put these gifts in order that
[2:25] they happen in his life and so if I'm
[2:26] wrong in anything please forgive me and
[2:28] please share a quote with me that would
[2:30] help correct me by the grace of God the
[2:32] first preaching gift brother BR had was
[2:34] a pastor in this first quote from
[2:37] 1964 brother Ram said he was ordained as
[2:40] one of the local Pastors in the
[2:42] Missionary Baptist Church so his first
[2:44] preaching gift would have been a
[2:45] pastoral gift let's listen to the quote
[2:49] then about 17 years after
[2:53] that I was had become a minister a
[2:56] Baptist preacher of the Missionary
[2:58] Baptist Church Dr Roy E Davis ordain me
[3:02] as one of the local pastors give me ride
[3:05] sand the state Mary Berry baptize so
[3:08] forth and uh the missionary baptist
[3:10] church burned down which I was assistant
[3:13] pastor at the time and Mr Davis come
[3:15] back to Texas which was of Davis
[3:17] Mountains and and U Down near Van harn
[3:20] Texas that's where they come from and so
[3:22] while he was gone I started to take over
[3:25] the congregation got a tent and I be to
[3:27] preach in the city just a boy preacher
[3:30] the next three gifts show how brother
[3:31] Bram was a prophet of God and of course
[3:34] I mean by this is speaking with thus
[3:36] sayith the Lord Brother Bram speaking
[3:38] with thus sayith the Lord we know he had
[3:39] Visions as a young boy but I think
[3:42] there's a difference when a man is a
[3:45] ordained preacher and he begins to share
[3:47] Visions with us sayith the Lord so we'll
[3:49] start in Shalom 1964 brother Ram said
[3:53] since 1933 when the Holy Spirit gave me
[3:55] that visions and showed me the end time
[3:57] seven things that I spoke of and five of
[3:59] them has already happened perfectly
[4:01] right on and then in Souls that are in
[4:03] prison 1963 brother Ram said just
[4:06] exactly what's wrote on my book of
[4:08] Prophecy in
[4:09] 1933 and then a third quote about the
[4:12] seven major Visions showing brother
[4:13] brandham was a prophet was from
[4:15] conference November 25th 1960 the seven
[4:18] major Visions came to brother brandham
[4:20] in June of
[4:21] 1933 on his way to Sunday school let's
[4:24] listen to the
[4:25] quotes and is it not a strange thing
[4:34] that in this day that when we have come
[4:38] through all these things and the message
[4:41] has crossed the Earth against
[4:43] organization it's blasted it from right
[4:46] to left amen that in this hour that's
[4:50] been told since 1933 when the Holy
[4:52] Spirit gave me that visions and show me
[4:54] the end
[4:55] time seven things that I spoke of and
[4:58] five of them has already happened
[5:00] perfectly right on like Germany and and
[5:03] Italy and all the wars and the national
[5:05] things s speaks to me on those things
[5:08] but they happened just exactly the way
[5:10] he said it happened yeah I know that see
[5:13] just exactly what's wrote on my book of
[5:15] Prophecy in 1933 that would take place
[5:18] amen I picked up a prophecy I didn't I
[5:21] was a pastor of the Baptist Church there
[5:24] I didn't even know what a vision meant
[5:27] and now D things would happen i' call it
[5:29] falling into a
[5:31] trance I didn't know to call it a vision
[5:33] at that time I was just a boy
[5:37] 1933 on June I was on my way to Sunday
[5:41] school and while I was getting my Bible
[5:44] a vision came before me and I was
[5:46] stopped in the floor and here was what
[5:48] it's
[5:49] said it's on yellow paper will be
[5:52] printed in the herald of Faith right
[5:55] away because most all of it is fulfilled
[5:58] 19 and3 33 think of this
[6:01] now many many years ago about 28 years
[6:06] ago it it taken place watch how accurate
[6:09] his word is the third preaching gift
[6:12] that seemed to manifest in the life of
[6:13] William Brenham was the teacher and as a
[6:17] pastor brother BR would take time and
[6:19] teach the word of God so here's a quote
[6:21] from the seven Church ages 1954 brother
[6:23] Ram said he spent a year and 6 months in
[6:26] the Book of Revelation in teaching he
[6:29] said I just love teaching it gives the
[6:31] basis and settles the church let's
[6:33] listen to the quote I remember seeing a
[6:37] year in six months in This Book of
[6:39] Revelation and and the Tabernacle here
[6:43] that's what I like and and teaching I
[6:47] just love teaching oh
[6:49] my I I think it's wonderful it gives the
[6:53] bases and settles the
[6:56] church the fourth gift seem to manifest
[6:58] in brother Ram's Ministry in 1946 it was
[7:01] the gift of evangelism brother Ram said
[7:03] in 1946 he left the Tabernacle and went
[7:06] into the Evangelistic campaigns of
[7:08] healing Services first quote's from
[7:10] Israel and the church part 3
[7:13] 1953 second quote is from wi are people
[7:15] so tossed about
[7:17] 1956 he said he left in 1946 when I left
[7:21] the Tabernacle let's listen to the
[7:23] quotes and now in the healing
[7:27] campaigns and this is the first time
[7:29] I've had a Revival in 7 years of this
[7:32] type 7 years this coming week I left the
[7:37] Tabernacle and went out into the
[7:40] Evangelistic campaigns of healing
[7:42] services and I've committed to managers
[7:44] who's done the preaching mostly and I
[7:47] would only speak on the subject of
[7:49] Divine Healing because we were a mixed
[7:52] audience now a few weeks ago I had
[7:57] promised the Lord a or about 10 years
[8:00] ago when I left in 1946 when I left the
[8:04] Tabernacle that I would serve him with
[8:07] all my heart in these campaigns knowing
[8:09] that it was going to be a great
[8:12] disturbance out
[8:13] there Fifth and finally the gift that
[8:16] manifested was the Apostle the fifth and
[8:19] final preaching gift of the fightful
[8:21] ministry it seems and I could be wrong
[8:23] that brother Ram's trip to Finland in
[8:27] 1950 was his first missionary trip and I
[8:29] could be wrong on that so please correct
[8:31] me if I'm wrong but here in 1952 brother
[8:34] Ram said going overseas brother baxer
[8:36] the first time I said I was led to go to
[8:38] Finland of course we know that's where
[8:40] the little boy was raised from the dead
[8:42] just as the vision was showed to brother
[8:44] Brandon by the Holy Ghost let's listen
[8:46] to the quote from Get the people to
[8:47] believe
[8:48] 1952 going overseas brother Banker the
[8:51] first time I said I was led to go to
[8:54] Finland is that right finland's where
[8:56] the real meeting was the best of
[8:59] meetings
[8:59] leading to what I'm talking about thank
[9:01] you brother back so again here's my
[9:03] order of the five preaching gifts
[9:06] manifesting in the life of brother
[9:07] brandham around 1932 he was ordained as
[9:10] one of the pastors it seems in 1933 he
[9:14] gave his first Prophecy of the seven
[9:16] major visions and then his teaching gift
[9:19] manifested sometime after
[9:21] 1933 and before 1946 cuz in 1946 he went
[9:25] into
[9:26] evangelism and then his first Apostle
[9:29] trip missionary trip seemed to be
[9:33] 1950 in
[9:35] closing friends hope this video was a
[9:37] blessing by the grace of God it's
[9:38] wonderful to look into the scripture and
[9:39] see a Bible precedent St Paul having
[9:42] five preaching gifts and then God
[9:43] sending us the seven Church age
[9:45] messenger brother brandham also with
[9:47] five preaching gifts so it's neat to see
[9:48] the alpha St Paul and the Omega Church
[9:51] age messenger brother William brandham
[9:53] both having five preaching gifts I'll
[9:55] just play one quote from Brother
[9:56] brandham perseverance 1962 he said I
[9:59] believe there's a church coming into
[10:00] that Perfection or maturity with the
[10:03] offices the five full ministry will be
[10:05] so with the word until the whole thing
[10:07] will work right up unto the coming of
[10:08] the Lord I believe that I believe we're
[10:10] nearing that time now I believe it's so
[10:12] and I do as well Friends by the grace of
[10:14] God let's listen to the quote now I
[10:16] believe that there's a church coming
[10:18] into that
[10:20] Perfection that Ministry of perfection
[10:25] where the offices where Apostles
[10:28] prophets teachers pastors evangelist for
[10:30] the perfecting of the church then
[10:32] pastors and teachers and so forth will
[10:34] be so with the word until the whole
[10:37] thing will work right up to the coming
[10:39] of the Lord I believe that and I believe
[10:41] we're nearing that time
[10:44] now I believe it so so we thank the Lord
[10:47] Jesus Christ for giving St Paul brother
[10:49] brandom and so many other preachers
[10:51] gifts in the fivefold ministry they
[10:53] unite the faith of the Believers they
[10:54] bring us to Perfection or maturity the
[10:57] fullness of the stature of Christ for
[10:58] each one of our Lives please pray for
[11:01] those preachers in the fful ministry
[11:03] that you're associated with ask God to
[11:05] reveal more of his truth to them so we
[11:07] can all be ready for the coming of the
[11:08] Lord Jesus
[11:10] Christ if you have any questions
[11:11] concerns or testimonies about this video
[11:13] please contact me God bless you and may
[11:16] Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
