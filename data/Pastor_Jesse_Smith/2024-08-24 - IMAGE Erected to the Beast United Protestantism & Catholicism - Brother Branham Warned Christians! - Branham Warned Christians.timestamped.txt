[0:02] don't you never try to fight communism
[0:04] fight
[0:07] romanism that's thus sayth the
[0:10] Lord hallelujah the Lord said romanism
[0:14] is go to rule not
[0:18] communism greetings friends in the
[0:20] matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[0:22] the purpose of this video is to look at
[0:24] the image of the Beast spoken of in
[0:26] Revelation 13: 11-18
[0:30] this image unto the Beast is a World
[0:33] Council of churches it's Protestant
[0:35] churches United with Catholicism as
[0:38] taught by God's Prophet The Late William
[0:40] Brenham 1909 to
[0:42] 1965 this video is the fifth video in a
[0:45] series of videos on the mark of the
[0:48] beast the series was started in July
[0:51] 2024 with the mark of the beast from
[0:53] Cain to the present time and then the
[0:55] mark of the beast during the Great
[0:56] Tribulation period and then we looked at
[0:59] the mark of his name
[1:01] and then most recently we looked at the
[1:02] number of the Beast
[1:04] 666 hi friends I'm Jesse Smith pastor
[1:07] bride of Christ Fellowship here in akan
[1:09] Ohio USA and I defend the original
[1:11] Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ that he
[1:13] first revealed to St Paul and then had
[1:15] to restore through Martin Luther John
[1:17] Wesley and the late Prophet William
[1:19] brandham also defend William branham's
[1:22] Godly Christian character I'm going to
[1:24] begin by reading a little portion from
[1:25] my 2021 book The 12 New Testament
[1:28] Mysteries revealed it's on pages is
[1:31] 595 and
[1:33] 596 Revelation 13: 14- 15 unveils the
[1:37] beast's plan for Humanity to make an
[1:40] image to the Beast which had the wound
[1:42] by a sword and did
[1:45] live remember the wound By The Sword was
[1:49] the fall of the Pagan Imperial Roman
[1:52] Empire but then the Beast continued to
[1:55] live through the paple Empire or the
[1:58] Roman Catholic Church since the Beast or
[2:01] Spirit of Rome is invisible it seeks an
[2:03] image for itself which will be a
[2:06] worldwide ecunemical Council all these
[2:09] false Protestant churches will get
[2:11] together in a union with the Roman
[2:13] Catholic Church it seems likely that the
[2:16] World Council of churches will be the
[2:17] main component of this worldwide image
[2:20] unto the Beast because this organization
[2:23] currently represents nearly 500 million
[2:25] Christians and literally seeks visible
[2:28] Unity or an image for Christians and you
[2:30] can find that on their website it's on
[2:33] the about us page they're seeking a
[2:35] visible Unity they're seeking an image
[2:38] of unity so that's why God's Prophet
[2:40] brother brandom recognized it's probably
[2:42] the World Council of churches that will
[2:44] be the image unto the Beast because
[2:46] they're seeking visible Unity this
[2:49] council is a false Unity of course for
[2:51] any Union without Union upon true
[2:54] Doctrine is erroneous the World Council
[2:57] of churches has member churches who hold
[2:59] false doctrines that allow homosexuality
[3:01] adultery lusciousness just a name a few
[3:05] these churches do not have Unity like
[3:07] Jesus's Unity with the father for Jesus
[3:10] always did those things that please the
[3:12] father according to John
[3:14] 8:29 the World Council churches allow
[3:18] sins that displease the father or grieve
[3:21] the heavenly father or the holy spirit
[3:23] so the world counsil of churches cannot
[3:25] have true Unity with Jesus while Jesus
[3:27] did pray for Christians to have unity
[3:29] and John 17:11 he said that they may be
[3:32] one as we are the Bible teaches true
[3:35] Unity only comes through adherence to
[3:37] the one Faith remember Ephesians 4:5
[3:40] says there's only one faith and then
[3:43] Jude 1:3 says we earnestly contend for
[3:45] the faith that was once delivered to the
[3:47] Saints and false churches will turn
[3:49] God's grace into lusciousness false
[3:52] churches turn God's grace into
[3:55] lawlessness or iniquity which means
[3:57] churches will say oh it's okay if you
[3:59] sin it's it's okay if you commit
[4:00] adultery it's okay if you're homosexual
[4:03] it's okay if you're trans lies such as
[4:06] those are the epitome of turning Grace
[4:08] into
[4:09] theous in the Bible St John States
[4:12] Christians should have no Unity with
[4:14] teachers of false Doctrine saying
[4:16] whosoever transgresseth and abideth not
[4:18] in the doctrine of Christ hath not God
[4:21] he that abideth in the doctrine of
[4:22] Christ he hath both the father and the
[4:24] son if there come any unto you and bring
[4:27] not this Doctrine receive him not into
[4:29] your house neither bid him godp speed
[4:31] for he that bth him godp speed is
[4:33] partaker of his evil Deeds 2 John 1:
[4:38] 99-1 I love this scripture because it
[4:40] says in order to have Christ and the
[4:42] father you have to have the right
[4:44] Doctrine and it's so sad many message
[4:46] churches are blasting preachers who
[4:48] teach Doctrine and so forth shame on
[4:50] them they don't even know what they're
[4:51] saying they're likely very immature
[4:54] probably not born again if they don't
[4:55] understand the importance of Doctrine in
[4:57] fact Jesus's first Doctrine according to
[4:59] brother brandham was John 3 you must be
[5:02] born again I want to take the subject
[5:04] this morning of Jesus first
[5:07] Doctrine the first doctrine of Jesus was
[5:10] you must be born again that was his
[5:14] first Doctrine and without being born
[5:16] again you can't even go in the Rapture
[5:18] so all these message preachers blasting
[5:20] Doctrine they're blasting the only way
[5:23] to go in the Rapture which is the
[5:24] doctrine of the baptism of the Holy
[5:26] Ghost receiving the baptism of the Holy
[5:28] Ghost moving on all churches who reject
[5:31] true Bible Doctrine and join the World
[5:33] Council of churches in a false Unity
[5:35] manifest that they are true Daughters of
[5:37] the mother Harlot and the mother Harlot
[5:39] of course is the Roman Catholic Church
[5:41] the image of the Beast or world or World
[5:44] Council of churches would play a major
[5:45] role in the future Great Tribulation
[5:48] helping lay down the mark of the beast
[5:50] Revelation 13:15 says the Beast gives
[5:52] life unto the image of the Beast that
[5:55] the image of the Beast should both speak
[5:57] and cause that as many as would not
[5:58] worship the image of the Beast should be
[6:01] killed and God's Prophet brother brandom
[6:04] taught us The ecumenical move will
[6:05] become so strong politically that
[6:07] governments will enact laws forcing all
[6:09] churches to come under Dominion of the
[6:11] World Council which is basically Rome's
[6:14] Dominion great pressure to join will be
[6:16] placed upon everyone for this unionized
[6:19] church and state system controls
[6:21] finances and will have power to kill
[6:22] anyone who
[6:24] descend friends no matter what the
[6:26] current Pope says or any Pope says or
[6:28] any Catholic says
[6:30] the Catholic councils declared that any
[6:32] Protestant receiving the revelation of
[6:34] justification by faith is cursed this is
[6:37] from the Council of Trent took place
[6:39] from 1545 to
[6:42] 1563 you can find this on britannica.com
[6:45] says indeed both of the either or
[6:48] doctrines of the Protestant reformers
[6:50] justification by faith alone the
[6:52] authority of scriptures alone were aniz
[6:55] or cursed in the name of a both and
[6:58] doctrine of justification by both faith
[7:00] and works on the basis of the authority
[7:02] of both scripture and tradition so back
[7:05] in the 1500s the Catholic Church cursed
[7:07] Protestant teaching on justification by
[7:10] faith saying they're cursed that means
[7:12] they can't be saved so no matter what
[7:14] current Catholics say or anyone says the
[7:16] Council of Trent cursed Protestants who
[7:19] believe in justification by faith only
[7:21] so any Protestant who unites with a
[7:23] Catholic is being deceived because the
[7:25] Catholics have cursed justification by
[7:28] faith they've never corrected that
[7:30] Council they never changed the words
[7:31] from that Council it's still in effect
[7:34] and as you know there's been a great
[7:35] move of ecumenism Pope Francis actually
[7:39] went to the World Council of churches
[7:40] back in 2018 I found a website on that I
[7:44] just thought it was interesting the
[7:45] Catholic church is not part of the World
[7:47] Council of churches but has participated
[7:49] as an observer and has collaborated at
[7:51] various levels since
[7:53] 1965 I thought that was very fitting
[7:55] that was the Year brother brand went off
[7:56] the scene and again that was the same
[7:58] year Catholicism started actively
[8:00] participating with the World Council of
[8:02] churches the same year God took his
[8:04] Prophet off the scene you probably
[8:06] remember 2014 when Word of Faith false
[8:10] prophet Kenneth Copeland United with the
[8:12] Pope here's a screenshot of that in this
[8:15] picture you can see the late Bishop Tony
[8:18] Palmer sadly he passed away just months
[8:20] after this meeting with Kenneth copelan
[8:22] and the pope it's very sad of course for
[8:25] his family with his loss but friends he
[8:28] said that he went to this meeting with
[8:31] Copeland and the Pope in the spirit of
[8:32] Elijah to unite Catholics and
[8:35] Protestants that's a very dangerous
[8:37] statement I don't know if that's why
[8:39] Tony Palmer passed away so recently or
[8:42] so soon after that statement but that
[8:45] had have been a lie because brother
[8:46] brandham already spoke with thus sayith
[8:48] the Lord that the spirit of Elijah was
[8:50] upon him fighting against the Roman
[8:53] Catholic Church not uniting Protestants
[8:55] with the Catholic church but the Bible
[8:58] said
[9:00] and he promised in the last days he
[9:02] would send the spirit of Elijah and
[9:05] would call the people the children of
[9:07] God back to the original Faith like it
[9:09] was in the beginning of the world now
[9:12] remember it's thus sayth the Lord
[9:14] that'll come to pass in this day now
[9:17] search over the world take every cult
[9:21] take every Clan take every man take
[9:23] every church I charge you in Christ's
[9:26] name to do this you preachers
[9:29] I charge you to read the newspapers or
[9:32] take consideration anywhere you want to
[9:34] go and see if it isn't on the Earth
[9:36] right
[9:39] now don't you never try to fight
[9:41] communism fight
[9:44] romanism that's right that's thus sayth
[9:47] the
[9:48] Lord hallelujah the Lord said romanism
[9:51] is going to rule not communism it's just
[9:55] a
[9:56] puppet and then in 2017 I'm sure you
[9:58] might know know or maybe it's new to you
[10:00] that a pastor from Atlanta Georgia named
[10:02] Lou Giglio kissed the pope so there's
[10:05] lots of videos you can find on that on
[10:07] YouTube as well again showing a
[10:09] prominent Protestant preacher showing
[10:12] love and affection for the pope of Rome
[10:14] the mother Harlot and Lou giglio's
[10:16] passion conferences have ministered to
[10:18] thousands of people thousands of
[10:20] Protestants but of course it's a false
[10:22] worship a false religion because they're
[10:24] uniting with the Roman Catholic church
[10:26] and lastly I'll just remind you of the
[10:28] Republican National Convention from July
[10:32] 2024 the convention was opened up with a
[10:35] prayer to the one true God of the Hindu
[10:37] religion a religionnews.com article says
[10:40] this at RNC an uneven awkward Embrace of
[10:45] religious pluralism as a republican
[10:47] official let a seek prayer images of
[10:50] Christian crosses flash behind her the
[10:53] prayer was led by a woman named harit
[10:56] cower Dylan a National Committee woman
[10:59] of the Republican National Convention
[11:00] for
[11:02] California the prayer said dear why guro
[11:05] our one true God we thank you for
[11:08] creating America as unique Heaven on
[11:10] this earth end quote friends this is so
[11:13] sad the name of God is not wahi guro the
[11:16] name of God is the Lord Jesus Christ and
[11:19] I just read this morning in Revelation
[11:21] 13 how the Beast will blaspheme the name
[11:24] of God and so Catholics blasphemed the
[11:27] name of God by ignoring the the Lord
[11:29] Jesus Christ's name and giving God
[11:31] titles father son Holy Ghost calling him
[11:33] a Holy Trinity that's blasphemy changing
[11:36] the name of God and here it's blasphemy
[11:38] to say the one name of God is wahi Guru
[11:42] and of course this is blasphemy but you
[11:44] can see the efforts of all these
[11:47] so-called religious people these
[11:49] Protestants trying to unite with
[11:51] Catholicism and Christianity creating a
[11:53] one world religion three times in
[11:55] brother brenham's Church age book he
[11:57] mentioned this image erected to the
[11:59] Beast he said the world ecunemical
[12:01] movement which is the image erected unto
[12:03] the Beast that was on page 274 and then
[12:06] on page 314 he said the elect will not
[12:09] only be kept but as this move becomes
[12:11] the image erected to the Beast the
[12:13] Saints will be gone in the Rapture
[12:15] praise the Lord for that brother Ram
[12:17] said the church system of the Roman
[12:18] Catholic and the Protestant is coming
[12:20] together and it will control the whole
[12:22] wealth of the world system and force the
[12:24] whole world into its religious trap or
[12:26] will kill them by refusing them the
[12:28] privilege of buying and selling whereby
[12:30] they would make a living brother Ram
[12:33] said this will be accomplished simply
[12:34] for the harlot's daughters are all but
[12:35] gone back to her and I also share with
[12:37] my church recently a very famous
[12:39] conservative Candace Owens has now gone
[12:42] back to the Roman Catholic Church here's
[12:44] a screenshot of that again this is no
[12:46] surprise we know the Protestants must
[12:48] Unite with the Catholics whether they do
[12:49] it by converting to Catholicism or
[12:52] uniting with the Pope kissing the pope
[12:54] meeting with the Pope it's sad but
[12:56] that's prophecy being fulfilled we to be
[12:59] the elect that do not Unite with
[13:01] protestantism and Catholicism and we are
[13:04] by the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ by
[13:06] the warnings of thus sayth the Lord from
[13:08] God's Prophet brother William brandham
[13:10] Brother Bram said the false Church
[13:11] groups will come together in a world
[13:13] Council of churches This World Council
[13:14] of churches is the image erected to the
[13:17] Beast one final quote is from Shalom
[13:21] 1964 brother brandham said I know it's
[13:24] unpopular to speak against organization
[13:26] but that's the mark of the beast it's
[13:28] making an image unto the Beast he says
[13:30] you'll know that was thus sayith the
[13:32] Lord someday and we're seeing this
[13:34] greater move of Protestants uniting with
[13:36] Catholics today so we can see brother
[13:38] Ram's prophecy is being fulfilled right
[13:40] before our eyes let's listen to the
[13:41] quote and here he comes down and
[13:44] vindicates it on the moon just at the
[13:46] time that all the churches are going
[13:48] together in a consolidation of the
[13:51] Federation of churches Hallelujah no
[13:53] wonder Isaiah said Gross darknesses upon
[13:56] the Earth upon this people
[14:01] I know it's unproper to speak against
[14:03] organization but that's the mark of the
[14:05] beast that's the thing that's carrying
[14:06] us right into there making an image unto
[14:08] the Beast I don't say that for to be
[14:12] angry I say that because it's truth
[14:14] Brethren the day will come when Phoenix
[14:17] will raise up and maybe I'm gone on but
[14:19] you'll know that that was thus said the
[14:22] Lord it is true how that the great Holy
[14:26] Spirit has Vindicated those messages and
[14:29] for toll of things never to fail one
[14:33] time in
[14:35] closing friends hope this video was a
[14:37] blessing by the grace of God as time
[14:39] keeps moving on we see more and more
[14:41] Protestants uniting with Catholicism
[14:43] more people converting into Catholicism
[14:46] saying they're going back to the
[14:47] original church and of course they're
[14:49] the original Harlot church but thank God
[14:51] for the truth of God that sets us free
[14:54] thank God for the holy ghost that cleans
[14:56] out our lives seals our souls into the
[14:58] day day of redemption and even keeps us
[15:01] from any Deeds of the nicians these
[15:03] original sins that God hates these
[15:06] sayings or traditions of man that
[15:08] eventually become false doctrines thank
[15:10] God that the Holy Ghost convicts us of
[15:12] any sin or any false tradition and keeps
[15:15] us clean it takes all the leaven out of
[15:16] the church so we rejoice in that that we
[15:18] can be the True Church of God the Blood
[15:21] Washed blood Sanctified blood Justified
[15:24] Blood Bought Church and Bride of the
[15:27] Lord Jesus Christ and by God's Grace we
[15:29] have the baptism of the Holy Ghost in
[15:30] our souls and we will be ready to meet
[15:32] the Lord in the air at the
[15:34] pre-tribulation
[15:36] Rapture if you have any questions
[15:38] concerns or testimonies about this video
[15:39] please contact
[15:40] me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[15:43] the desire of your heart
