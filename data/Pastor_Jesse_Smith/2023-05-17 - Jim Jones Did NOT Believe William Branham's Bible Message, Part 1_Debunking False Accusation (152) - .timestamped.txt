[0:00] [Music]
[0:02] happy to see today is our first Pastor
[0:06] brother James Jones from Indianapolis
[0:08] back there
[0:10] and the pastor was weakling enough to
[0:12] let him get by with it
[0:15] shame on the pastors that fails his hand
[0:17] out in their Church
[0:27] greetings friends in the mattress name
[0:29] of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of
[0:32] this video is to begin a short series
[0:34] proving that Jim Jones did not believe
[0:37] the bible-based message that God gave to
[0:41] his Prophet brother William Branham in
[0:44] March of 2023 one of Brothers accusers
[0:47] started a series on his podcast claiming
[0:49] that brother Branham is responsible for
[0:52] the acts of the evil con man and mass
[0:55] murder Jim Jones and of course this is a
[0:58] lie this is an awful false accusation it
[1:01] proves the cognitive dissonance of
[1:03] brother brahm's accuser and so by God's
[1:06] grace I'm starting a short series on
[1:07] this subject to prove hopefully once and
[1:10] for all that Jim Jones ultimately
[1:12] rejected the message the bible-based
[1:15] message that God gave to his Prophet
[1:17] brother William Branham and it was Jim
[1:19] Jones rejection of the Bible in his own
[1:22] lust of the Flesh and lust of the eyes
[1:24] and pride of life that led him down the
[1:27] path of self-destruction and ultimately
[1:29] mass murder
[1:30] let me also add a disclaimer about this
[1:33] series there's a lot of sensitive
[1:36] information that young children
[1:38] shouldn't hear on this series so I
[1:40] encourage everyone who listens just to
[1:42] make sure adults listen to these
[1:44] episodes about Jim Jones and brother
[1:46] Branham
[1:47] here's the outline for this short video
[1:49] series first we'll start with the
[1:51] accusation against brother Branham and
[1:53] also look at the character of brother
[1:55] Brown's accusers
[1:57] second we'll look at the one brother
[1:59] random quote about Jim Jones and their
[2:02] short Association
[2:05] third we'll look at brother branham's
[2:06] eight or nine warnings to Jim Jones and
[2:10] the Pastors in Jim Jones's church that
[2:13] Jim Jones failed to heed
[2:16] fourth we'll look at some historical
[2:17] facts about Jim Jones
[2:20] and Fifth and finally we'll have a
[2:22] summary a stark contrast between Jim
[2:25] Jones and brother Branham
[2:28] friends brother William Branham was a
[2:31] holy ghost filled anointed prophet of
[2:33] God who lived a Godly holy life Jim
[2:37] Jones is exactly the opposite as any
[2:40] honest person already knows who has
[2:42] honestly studied the life of Jim Jones
[2:45] Jim Jones was a mass murderer he was a
[2:48] drug addict he was a con man who amassed
[2:51] millions of dollars through swindling
[2:53] and deception he was a false prophet he
[2:57] was a whoremonger a bisexual he
[3:01] terrorized the people in his church
[3:03] torturing them depriving them of sleep
[3:06] he forced everyone to call him father or
[3:09] dad
[3:10] Jim Jones believed he was God Jim Jones
[3:13] believed in reincarnation he allowed his
[3:16] congregation to commit fornication and
[3:19] adultery openly he destroyed the nuclear
[3:21] family
[3:22] he let women cut their hair
[3:24] wear makeup and wear pants he was
[3:27] arrested for lewd sexual misconduct
[3:30] and claimed socialism was the real hero
[3:33] an answer for society so in short Jim
[3:37] Jones was a demon-possessed man
[3:39] the complete opposite of brother Branham
[3:41] who was filled with the Holy Ghost
[3:44] accusation and character of brother
[3:46] Brown's accusers
[3:49] according to one website of one of
[3:51] brother Ram's accusers he says quote
[3:53] William Branham preached a three-day
[3:55] campaign in June 1956 at the Catal
[3:58] Tabernacle in Indianapolis Indiana with
[4:00] Jim Jones this three-day campaign was
[4:03] attended by over 11 000 people and
[4:05] skyrocketed Jim Jones to Fame by
[4:08] following on the coattails of William
[4:10] Branham end quote
[4:11] while his true brother Ram did preach at
[4:14] Jim Jones's Church in 1956 Jim Jones
[4:17] rejected by the Rams bible-based
[4:19] teaching shortly after these meetings
[4:21] the accuser's website says brother
[4:24] Branham and Jim Jones worked together
[4:25] for two years if that's true which I
[4:28] don't know it's true then brother random
[4:30] lived eight years afterwards and never
[4:33] exalted praised or even recognized Jim
[4:35] Jones
[4:36] and again anyone who honestly studies
[4:38] Jim Jones teachings
[4:40] knows Jim Jones was not a bible message
[4:42] believer he was not a follower of
[4:45] William Branham in the least
[4:47] now let's look at the character of three
[4:50] of brother Ram's accusers that claim
[4:52] brother Branham is Guilty by association
[4:55] with Jim Jones how can we trust these
[4:58] three men these accusers of brother
[4:59] Branham that have such corrupt fruits
[5:02] such as the following list first these
[5:04] accusers claim brother Branham
[5:05] plagiarized the Seven Seals yet I have
[5:08] videos and podcasts that show that's a
[5:10] lie and brother random has over 38
[5:13] differences between Clarence Larkin and
[5:15] Charles Taze Russell on the Seven Seals
[5:17] if brother and accusers won't do honest
[5:20] research about the Seven Seals how can
[5:22] they do honest research about Jim Jones
[5:25] second brother Ram's accusers claim God
[5:27] is three persons and they add to the
[5:29] Bible without any Scripture saying God
[5:31] is three persons so if they'll add to
[5:33] the Bible so freely how can we trust
[5:36] their research about Jim Jones
[5:37] third so my brother Brandon's accusers
[5:40] describe their podcasts and videos about
[5:42] brother Branham as being juicy which is
[5:45] gossip-like terminology how can we have
[5:47] confidence in men that engage in gossip
[5:50] and distort the truth so freely like
[5:52] these men fourth one of brother Brown's
[5:54] accusers says Halloween is fun and he
[5:57] watches Dracula movies and dresses up
[5:59] like Dracula and lets his children watch
[6:02] Dracula movies and Dracula is a
[6:04] blood-sucking abominable demonic
[6:07] fornicator and murderer how can we trust
[6:10] an accuser's research who rejoices in
[6:13] such a demonic character and dresses up
[6:15] like a demonic character like Dracula
[6:18] fifth some of Brothers accusers admit
[6:22] they watch filthy Hollywood movies with
[6:24] cuss words sex scenes murder scenes and
[6:27] more they also enjoy reading murder
[6:29] mystery books how can we trust the
[6:31] research of people that enjoy lust of
[6:33] the eyes and lust of the Flesh and
[6:36] failed to abstain from it like the Bible
[6:37] tells us to abstain from all appearances
[6:40] of evil
[6:42] six how can we trust researchers that
[6:44] grossly misinterpret quotes from Brother
[6:46] Branham in order to slander him on many
[6:48] occasions and this Jim Jones accusation
[6:51] is just one of the many
[6:52] misinterpretations
[6:53] [Music]
[6:54] seventh how can we trust men that allow
[6:57] women to cut their hair despite Paul
[6:58] forbidding it in First Corinthians 11
[7:00] 1-16
[7:03] also how can we trust men that say
[7:04] there's only one work of Grace rather
[7:07] than three works of Grace as brother I'm
[7:09] taught and this one work of Grace
[7:10] essentially teaches that even a child is
[7:12] filled with the Holy Ghost after saying
[7:15] a scripted sinner's prayer which of
[7:17] course we know is not true
[7:18] next how can we trust men and accusers
[7:21] that allow their children to be married
[7:23] a second and third time some of brother
[7:25] Ram's accusers openly support adultery
[7:28] in other words
[7:30] alas how can we believe brothers
[7:31] accusers when they allow women to wear
[7:33] makeup and wear pants yet the Bible
[7:35] forbids both
[7:37] of course all these facts prove we
[7:39] cannot trust Brothers accusers
[7:41] so this accusation that brother Branham
[7:43] is somehow Guilty by association with
[7:45] Jim Jones is a major obvious sign of the
[7:48] cognitive dissonance on the part of
[7:51] brother Brown's accusers brother Ram's
[7:53] accusers are under a strong delusion
[7:55] they fail to recognize that Jim Jones is
[7:58] the same as the 70 preachers who left
[8:00] Jesus
[8:01] Jim Jones left the bible-based teachings
[8:03] of brother Branham just like the 70
[8:05] preachers left Jesus in John chapter 6.
[8:08] Jesus was not guilty by association with
[8:10] these 70 preachers who left him nor
[8:12] would Judas Iscariot who left Jesus if
[8:15] Judas is Garrett was the son of
[8:16] perdition and was so incredibly evil
[8:18] then what title could be given to Jim
[8:20] Jones who is even more evil it seems
[8:23] this accusation against brother Branham
[8:25] is nearly all presumption on the part of
[8:28] brother Brown's accusers this attack of
[8:30] being Guilty By Association on brother
[8:32] Branham is the equivalent to saying that
[8:35] Jesus is responsible for the Catholic
[8:37] Crusades we know the Catholic Crusades
[8:40] killed millions of people during the
[8:42] Dark Ages in the name of Jesus the fact
[8:45] is the Catholic Crusades were not led by
[8:47] Jesus's Spirit the Catholics were not
[8:50] listening to Jesus the Same is true with
[8:52] Jim Jones Jim Jones did not listen to
[8:54] the preaching of brother Branham and as
[8:56] you'll see later even Jim Jones's own
[8:59] words prove he was an enemy of brother
[9:01] Branham Jim Jones was not trying to
[9:03] follow the bible-based teachings of
[9:04] brother Branham in the least bit
[9:07] next let's look at the brother random
[9:09] quote about Jim Jones and a little bit
[9:10] more on their Association
[9:13] so I want to first play the quote from
[9:14] other Branham where he names Jim Jones
[9:16] it's from 1956 October 2nd in Chicago
[9:20] Illinois around said he's happy to see
[9:23] brother James Jones and it was a
[9:25] privilege to speak to him and their
[9:27] people and brother Adam expected to live
[9:29] in eternity with them in glory now
[9:32] friends it's my belief that at this
[9:33] point perhaps Jim Jones was an honest
[9:36] person no one knows for sure but this is
[9:38] brother Brandon being a gracious person
[9:40] just like Jesus was gracious to Judas
[9:42] even on the night of Jesus's arrest he
[9:45] called Judas a friend yet Jesus knew he
[9:47] was the son of perdition and Christ knew
[9:49] Judas would betray him now we don't know
[9:51] brother random knew that Jim Jones would
[9:54] turn out to be the person he was but it
[9:55] doesn't matter because brother Brandon
[9:57] warned Jim Jones and brother Ram lived a
[9:59] holy ghost-filled life whereas Jim Jones
[10:01] lived a demon-possessed life let's
[10:03] listen to the quote
[10:06] thank you
[10:10] happy to see today is our host Pastor
[10:13] brother James Jones from Indianapolis
[10:15] back there for having the brother from
[10:18] Spindale also brother Winston hair from
[10:21] California I'll be just as looking on
[10:24] seeing brother Scotland here with black
[10:26] from from up in Canada where we just had
[10:29] the great meeting up there and many
[10:32] other friends that sitting around it
[10:34] certainly is a privilege today to speak
[10:37] to such a host of people who are am
[10:40] expecting to
[10:42] live an eternity with in glory and have
[10:46] the privilege today to be standing to
[10:48] speak to you and fellowship with you
[10:51] around the word of God
[10:53] it certainly is a privilege to do this
[10:59] now friends Brothers accusers mock
[11:01] brother Branham and say why didn't
[11:03] brother Branham discern Jim Jones that
[11:05] he would fall away well the fact is we
[11:07] don't know maybe brother Branham did I
[11:09] believe in the sermon brother brand did
[11:11] discern Jim Jones as we'll see soon but
[11:14] the fact is God doesn't always tell us
[11:16] and help us discern who's going to fall
[11:18] away and who's not
[11:20] for example why didn't Paul discern
[11:22] Demas falling away in Colossians 4 verse
[11:25] 14. Colossians 4 14 says Luke the
[11:27] Beloved Physician and Demas greet you so
[11:30] Paul says that Demus sent a greeting to
[11:33] the Colossians why didn't Paul discern
[11:35] this greeting and say Demas is going to
[11:37] fall away he's going to leave me and go
[11:40] to the present world
[11:41] well the reason is because God doesn't
[11:43] tell us always who's going to fall away
[11:45] we can only know what God tells us and
[11:48] each one of us as Believers have been
[11:50] associated with people that we thought
[11:51] were Believers but eventually they fell
[11:54] away
[11:54] so it's ridiculous to criticize brother
[11:57] Brown for not Discerning Jim Jones
[11:59] because there's no one that can discern
[12:01] every single person except the Lord
[12:03] Jesus and we can only discern when God
[12:05] gives us the ability to discern the
[12:07] truth is Jim Jones heard the prophet of
[12:10] God brother Branham and rejected his
[12:12] teachings
[12:14] next in part three let's look at brother
[12:16] randoms eight or nine warnings to Jim
[12:18] Jones in this sermon from October 2nd
[12:20] 1956.
[12:22] friends to me this is amazing to see how
[12:25] God called out Jim Jones he's eight or
[12:27] nine times
[12:28] and then all this Oracle proof proves
[12:30] that Jim Jones did not accept brother
[12:32] Ram's message and taught the exact
[12:34] opposite
[12:35] and Jim Jones became an evil man a
[12:38] demon-possessed man a mass murderer
[12:40] whereas brother Brandon stayed true to
[12:42] the word of God and brother Brown was a
[12:43] genuine Holy Ghost filled prophet and
[12:45] notice as we listen to These Warnings
[12:47] from Brother Branham these quotes from
[12:49] Brother Branham proved brother Brown did
[12:50] not know Jim Jones well at all for
[12:52] example brother Ann rebukes women for
[12:54] having bobbed hair and yet all the
[12:56] pictures of Jim Jones and his followers
[12:59] all have women with Bob Terror and they
[13:01] have women in pants in the pictures with
[13:03] Jim Jones and women in bikinis and all
[13:05] kinds of filthy attire
[13:08] so the more you study the history of Jim
[13:10] Jones the more you realize he rejected
[13:12] the bible-based message of brother
[13:14] Branham
[13:15] the first warning is brother Brown said
[13:17] weak pastors let people get away with
[13:19] sin and that's exactly what Jim Jones
[13:21] was a weak Pastor who let his people get
[13:24] away with sin and Jim Jones of course
[13:25] indulged the most in sin among all of
[13:28] his people and his followers let's
[13:30] listen to the quote
[13:35] [Applause]
[13:40] we're not garrisoned against those
[13:43] things
[13:50] the whole church in one big United Army
[13:53] that would have ceased a long time ago
[13:56] time ago we've got it now which is so
[13:58] different they just do anything they
[14:00] won't do liberation of women they wear
[14:02] these little dirty looking throw her
[14:04] clothes and go out on the street and let
[14:07] me say something right here
[14:10] second warning is brother random gave a
[14:12] direct warning to the pastors about the
[14:15] congregation dressing holy and the guilt
[14:17] on women who dressed Unholy for causing
[14:21] men to lust after them let's listen to
[14:23] the warning
[14:30] adultery with her already in his heart
[14:33] does anybody know that uh and if you
[14:37] dress yourself
[14:46] you at the Judgment for you being guilty
[14:50] of committing adultery with that man
[14:52] when he answers for it
[14:54] where is it it was you was the one done
[14:57] it you presented yourself that way so
[14:59] you are the guilty one
[15:01] and you no matter how it's virgin and
[15:04] pure you've lived he'll be guilty before
[15:06] God of committing adultery with a sinner
[15:09] just as soon as you went through the ACT
[15:11] Jesus said so
[15:13] that's not skilled milk brother that's
[15:16] the truth
[15:19] that's what God's word is the customers
[15:26] and I don't know where your parents will
[15:28] appreciate that or not but I'm telling
[15:30] you my sister at the Judgment for her
[15:32] all they have to answer for it and if I
[15:34] don't say these things I don't care how
[15:37] many people say to liberation of women
[15:39] that's a doctrine of the devil and it's
[15:42] not in this Bible that's right right
[15:46] in the third warning brother Brown warns
[15:48] the pastor that the pastor should teach
[15:50] real history and Bible truths to the
[15:53] people and Jim Jones failed to do this
[15:55] let's listen to the quote
[15:58] you see what happens
[16:04] [Music]
[16:06] to acting like the world you know
[16:09] history or your pastor should teach it
[16:11] to you and you see in every age what
[16:13] happens to that cross
[16:15] and you see exactly where it is right
[16:17] now in the Pentecostal church so it's
[16:19] time to go online and make it together
[16:21] and it preach the truth
[16:23] the fourth warning to Jim
[16:26] Joe warning to the pastors shame on the
[16:28] pastors if they don't preach about
[16:29] makeup of course Jim Jones rejected this
[16:32] teaching let's listen to the quote
[16:35] a new man you
[16:38] ready the same way you shouldn't do that
[16:42] [Applause]
[16:44] same older pastors that fail to stand
[16:46] out in their Church
[16:57] the fifth warning was brother Brandon
[16:58] warning the pastor again and brother Ram
[17:00] Compares a weak compromising Pastor to
[17:04] ahab's false prophets who told him to go
[17:06] up to rameth Gilead to his death friends
[17:08] this is a shocking warning that God gave
[17:11] to brother Brenham for Jim Jones because
[17:13] Jim Jones influenced over 900 people to
[17:16] go down to South America to their deaths
[17:19] so again notice this fifth warning
[17:21] brother random said ahab's false
[17:23] prophets led to ahab's death this was a
[17:26] genuine warning from the spirit of God
[17:27] warning the people that Jim Jones would
[17:30] lead the people to their death let's
[17:32] listen to the quote
[17:34] foreign
[18:03] [Music]
[18:17] [Applause]
[18:21] he's with you
[18:23] the sixth warning is again a warning to
[18:26] a pastor to stay with the word and warn
[18:28] the people not to stay with your pastor
[18:30] if he's wrong so in the sixth warning
[18:32] Jim Jones was warned and also his
[18:34] congregation was warned but yet we know
[18:36] many of the congregation continue to
[18:38] follow Jim Jones sadly let's listen to
[18:40] the quote
[18:47] a piece of the weakness of the Christian
[18:49] church
[18:54] sure
[18:56] the words against it I don't care what
[19:00] the pastor says the word Santa let's say
[19:03] on the word
[19:04] 400 was giving one consent
[19:10] the seventh warning is again to pastors
[19:12] but the Rams said we shouldn't care if
[19:14] the word of God hurts the pastor just
[19:17] preach the word let's listen to the
[19:19] quote
[19:21] there is such an evangelism
[19:39] a preaching of it we must tell the truth
[19:43] I don't care
[19:45] [Applause]
[19:48] the eighth warning is again to pastors
[19:50] warning them about being carnal minded
[19:52] pastors and worrying about millions of
[19:54] dollars and of course Jim Jones was both
[19:56] he was a carnal-minded pastor and he had
[19:59] millions of dollars let's listen to the
[20:01] warning
[20:02] [Applause]
[20:09] Earth and everything and decorate his
[20:11] own or any worship God a true picture of
[20:15] a cruel church member today and a glory
[20:19] minded Pastor who was the Church of the
[20:22] cloud and the rest of the city and we'll
[20:24] see some of course them million dollar
[20:27] pipe organ God don't care that for that
[20:31] right don't have a thing you build all
[20:33] those 50 places like that and cram your
[20:36] people until they're just about to pull
[20:38] up Harpers and everything else along
[20:40] you're supposed to put in the church and
[20:42] thousands of healing and buried
[20:49] disgrace to Christianity
[20:52] the ninth and final warning is that
[20:54] brother Branham rebuked denominations
[20:56] and we know around 1960 just four years
[21:00] after this Jim Jones joined another
[21:02] denomination the Disciples of Christ so
[21:04] Jim Jones was United to the domination
[21:06] and not to Christ these are undeniable
[21:10] facts friends it was the Holy Ghost
[21:12] warning Jim Jones and his congregation
[21:14] through the prophet brother Branham and
[21:16] they failed to take heed to These
[21:17] Warnings let's listen to the quote
[21:20] there notice but what we got off is on
[21:24] our theology oh my you know Dr so and so
[21:28] he's such a classic man oh do you know
[21:30] he speaks in two or three different
[21:31] languages
[21:41] oh man it's the most beautiful I read a
[21:44] piece of paper a day about that long
[21:47] where it said that a certain Bishop of a
[21:49] certain Church played the prettiest
[21:51] prayer to their certain denomination
[21:53] that was ever prayed a tree page is a
[21:56] denomination
[21:58] that's right that's about a half a piece
