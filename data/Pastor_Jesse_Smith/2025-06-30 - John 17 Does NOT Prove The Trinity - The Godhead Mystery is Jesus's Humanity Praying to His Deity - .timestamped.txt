[0:03] Now you say, "How could he be God and be
[0:04] man?" See, there's the mystery. See, in
[0:08] body he was man, in spirit he was God.
[0:14] Someone asked me said, "Then how did who
[0:16] did he pray to in the garden of
[0:18] Gethsemane?"
[0:20] Greetings, friends, in the matchless
[0:22] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The
[0:24] purpose of this video is to answer a
[0:26] viewer's question about the Godhead. The
[0:28] question was, trinitarians often use
[0:32] Jesus's high priestly prayer in John 17
[0:35] to prove the Trinity. So, does John 17
[0:38] prove the Trinity? The answer is no.
[0:40] There's not two separate persons talking
[0:42] there. And I know that's mysterious, but
[0:44] the Bible calls the Godhead a mystery in
[0:47] Colossians 2:2. It's not two persons
[0:50] talking in John 17. It's the humanity of
[0:53] Jesus praying to the deity of Jesus. The
[0:57] deity of God can be in heaven and earth
[0:59] at the same time. The deity of God is
[1:01] limitless, infinite, eternal, and God
[1:04] can be in as many persons as he wants,
[1:07] as he proved on the day of Pentecost,
[1:10] 120 licks of fire. God was both in those
[1:13] licks of fire and in the souls of the
[1:15] Holy Ghost fil believers. So that's 240
[1:18] manifestations right there on the day of
[1:20] Pentecost. So the one great invisible
[1:23] eternal infinite person of God could be
[1:26] in Jesus as he prayed in John 17 and
[1:30] also in heaven. And so this video will
[1:32] help to answer that question by the
[1:33] grace of God. Let's start with some
[1:35] Bible foundation here. Colossians 2:2
[1:38] calls the Godhead a mystery. The Bible
[1:40] says to the acknowledgment of the
[1:42] mystery of God and of the father and of
[1:45] Christ. So notice Paul doesn't identify
[1:49] the Holy Spirit because to Paul the Holy
[1:52] Spirit was not a third person of a
[1:54] so-called trinity. The word trinity is
[1:56] not in the Bible. It was coined by
[1:59] Theophilles around 180 AD and then
[2:02] Tertullian shortly thereafter. So think
[2:05] of that friends. The word trinity is not
[2:06] in the Bible and it didn't come into
[2:08] usage until about 80 years after the
[2:11] last Bible author St. John had passed
[2:13] away. That proves it's an addition to
[2:16] the Bible and the Bible authors which
[2:19] some people call the giants of the
[2:20] faith. The giants of the faith so-called
[2:23] never chose to use the word trinity.
[2:25] Therefore, Holy Ghost fil believers
[2:27] won't use that word. Now, as I put on a
[2:30] recent video, we might say the trinity
[2:32] of manifestations, the trinity of
[2:35] offices, trinity of attributes, but it
[2:38] is not a trinity of persons. A trinity
[2:40] of persons makes tritheism or the
[2:43] worship of three separate co-equal
[2:46] distinct persons or gods and that's
[2:48] heathenism. So real holy ghost fil
[2:51] Christians are not heathens and they
[2:53] won't accept any addition to the word of
[2:55] God. Let's go to the high priestly
[2:57] prayer of Jesus. We're not going to read
[2:58] all this but I'm going to hit the
[2:59] highlights here from John 17. The main
[3:02] verse trinitarians try to use to prove
[3:04] the trinity is verse 5. And now, oh
[3:06] father, glorify thou me with thine own
[3:08] self with the glory which I had with
[3:10] thee, before the world was. So before
[3:13] the world came into existence, the son
[3:16] was with the father in glory. And then
[3:19] we also see the use of plural pronouns
[3:21] later on in this chapter down in verse
[3:23] 22. And the glory which thou gavest me,
[3:26] I have given them that they may be one
[3:29] even as we are one. So trinitarians try
[3:32] to use the argument that Jesus used
[3:35] plural pronouns like we, us, and our and
[3:39] that proves three persons. That does not
[3:41] prove three persons as we'll get to here
[3:43] by God's grace. Another one is John
[3:46] 14:23
[3:47] which says, "If a man love me, he will
[3:49] keep my words and my father will love
[3:51] him and we will come unto him and make
[3:53] our abode with him." And of course, this
[3:55] is speaking of the Holy Ghost because
[3:57] God the Father is the Holy Ghost and the
[4:00] Holy Ghost is the spirit of the Son. So
[4:03] the Holy Ghost, Christ in you, the hope
[4:04] of glory. That's the baptism of the Holy
[4:07] Ghost according to Colossians 1 26 27
[4:10] and 28. And notice it's Christ. Christ
[4:12] is the anointing. Christ is the logos.
[4:15] Christ is the son. So that is the abode
[4:17] of the father and son. The baptism of
[4:20] the Holy Ghost dwelling in the
[4:21] believer's soul. Just real quick, I want
[4:23] to review the eight problems with the
[4:24] Trinity Dogma. I wrote about this in my
[4:27] 2021 book, pages 23 to 32. The first
[4:33] problem is the Trinity Dogma adds to the
[4:36] Bible. The second problem is Jesus and
[4:38] his apostles taught and affirmed pure
[4:40] monotheism rather than trinitarianism.
[4:44] The third proof is the Aanian creed or
[4:46] sixth century trinitarian confessional
[4:48] contains multiple contradictions to
[4:50] biblical teaching on the godhead and
[4:53] there are six examples in my book. The
[4:54] fourth problem is major Bible
[4:56] contradictions and inconsistencies exist
[4:59] among trinitarians. They can't even
[5:01] agree on what they believe. Fifth, the
[5:04] early trinitarians did not affirm the
[5:05] Holy Spirit was divine until the council
[5:07] of Constantinople in 381 AD. Six,
[5:11] trinitarian images and artwork are often
[5:13] deceptive, creating false
[5:15] representations of the godhead. Seventh,
[5:17] some Trinitarians use two fear tactics
[5:19] to persuade others to believe in the
[5:21] Trinity, heresy, and hell. Eighth, and
[5:24] finally, God send a prophet named
[5:25] William Brandham to warn Christians
[5:27] about the false trinity doctrine with
[5:29] thus sayith the Lord. Next, for a good
[5:31] understanding on the Godhead, I would
[5:33] recommend people listening to the sermon
[5:35] from brother Brandham from 1953,
[5:37] questions and answers on Genesis, July
[5:39] 29th. And if you just type in these
[5:42] words into the table app, you can start
[5:44] listening to it right at paragraph 23.
[5:47] Oh, I got a beautiful picture in my mind
[5:48] now. If you could take a little trip
[5:51] with me. And then he talks about how a
[5:54] visible light came out of the invisible
[5:55] God, which we're going to go over today.
[5:57] But that's a great sermon if you want to
[5:58] listen to Brother explain it. Also, I
[6:00] wrote about the Godhead in my 2021 book.
[6:02] It's chapter one after the introduction
[6:05] chapter. So, it's the second chapter
[6:08] into the book, but it's called chapter 1
[6:10] because I didn't name the introduction
[6:12] as chapter 1. So, let's give some
[6:14] visuals here and a scriptural answer
[6:16] about John 17. Again, in order to
[6:20] understand John 17, you got to go back
[6:21] to the beginning. In the beginning was
[6:23] just the invisible father. Notice
[6:25] there's nothing on the screen other than
[6:26] those words. And then you move on to
[6:28] this visual.
[6:30] Brother Ram tells us and the Bible's
[6:32] clear about it as well. Out of the
[6:33] invisible father came a visible
[6:35] spiritual image of God. And now that
[6:38] something came out of God, now God's a
[6:40] father and now he has a son. The son is
[6:43] also called the logos or the word.
[6:48] And this son, logos, or word has
[6:50] numerous attributes. Here's just six
[6:52] attributes. Again, it's the logos of the
[6:54] word. This is a manifestation of the
[6:56] invisible God. This is the anointing of
[6:58] God. This is the theophony of God
[7:01] because it's a spirit body. This is the
[7:03] son of God because he came out of the
[7:05] father. And this is a visible form of
[7:08] the Holy Spirit in the spiritual realm,
[7:10] a celestial body. So here's the next
[7:12] visual. Now I have three steps which
[7:14] actually could be about four steps as
[7:15] you'll see at the end. But here's a
[7:17] visual to help explain this. First you
[7:19] had the invisible father. He has never
[7:21] been seen and never can be seen at any
[7:25] time in the future. It's according to
[7:26] John 1:18, 1 Timothy 1:17, and 1 Timothy
[7:31] 6:16. No man has seen God at any time,
[7:34] the only begotten son, which is in the
[7:36] bosom of the father. He hath declared
[7:38] him. Now unto the king, eternal,
[7:40] immortal, invisible. That's the key word
[7:42] there, invisible. The only wise God be
[7:44] glory, be honor, and glory forever and
[7:47] ever. Amen. And this scripture is key. 1
[7:49] Timothy 6:16, who only hath immortality.
[7:52] So only one person has immortality.
[7:54] That's God. God dwelling in the light
[7:57] which no man can approach unto. Whom no
[8:00] man hath seen nor can see. To whom be
[8:03] honor and power everlasting. Amen. So
[8:07] notice God dwells in the light. So if we
[8:09] go back to our visual here, this light,
[8:11] this amber light, this yellowish green
[8:14] amber light, the invisible father dwells
[8:17] inside of that light. But the
[8:19] manifestation of it is called the sun or
[8:22] the word or the logos.
[8:25] And this is what Jesus was talking about
[8:26] in John 17. This is the glory they
[8:29] shared before the foundation of the
[8:30] world. Because when this sun logos or
[8:33] word came into creation because Jesus is
[8:36] the beginning of the creation of God,
[8:38] this manifestation was a creation. There
[8:41] were no planets. There were no stars.
[8:44] There was no universe yet. God's first
[8:47] creation was a manifestation of himself,
[8:50] the word. Now, God used this logos to
[8:55] create all things according to numerous
[8:57] Bible verses to prove this. Let's go to
[9:00] Ephesians 3:9. The Bible said, "To make
[9:03] all men see what is the fellowship of
[9:05] the mystery which from the beginning of
[9:06] the world hath been hid in God who
[9:08] created all things by Jesus Christ." So,
[9:12] God first created a manifestation of
[9:15] himself. that was his son. And then
[9:17] through that word logos or through his
[9:20] son he created all things. We also see
[9:22] this in Colossians 1:15 who is the image
[9:25] of the invisible God. So the son the
[9:27] logos the word is the visible image of
[9:30] the invisible God the firstborn of every
[9:33] creature. So that proves right there
[9:34] that the logos was the first creature
[9:37] created. As Revelation said Jesus is the
[9:40] beginning of the creation of God. Verse
[9:42] 16. For by him were all things created
[9:44] that are in heaven and that are on
[9:45] earth, visible and invisible, whether
[9:48] they be thrones or dominions or
[9:49] principalities or powers. All things
[9:51] were created by him and for him. Notice,
[9:54] all things were created by the Son,
[9:56] Jesus. And he is before all things, and
[9:58] by him all things consist. And he is the
[10:01] head of the body, the church, who is the
[10:03] beginning, the firstborn from the dead,
[10:04] that in all things he might have the
[10:07] preeminence. Verse 19. And it pleased
[10:09] the father that in him should all
[10:11] fullness dwell. So God put all of his
[10:13] power, all of his authority in his son,
[10:16] the word, the logos. And then Colossians
[10:18] 2:9 again repeats this fullness of the
[10:21] Godhead truth. For in him dwelleth all
[10:23] the fullness of the Godhead bodily.
[10:26] Now we can understand Genesis 1:26.
[10:30] And God said, "Let us make man in our
[10:31] image, after our likeness, and let them
[10:33] have dominion over the fish of the sea."
[10:35] And so forth. But the phrase, "Let us"
[10:38] does not prove two persons. It's God
[10:40] speaking through the logos. God speaking
[10:44] through the word. God speaking through
[10:46] his son. So friends, this light, this
[10:48] logos, this pillar of fire, we'd say,
[10:51] has to have its own noun because it's a
[10:54] thing. It's a manifestation. It's the
[10:56] same person, but it's two
[10:58] manifestations, but it's a living
[10:59] manifestation.
[11:01] Another great scripture is John 1 1, 2,
[11:05] and 3. In the beginning was the word or
[11:07] logos and the word was with God and the
[11:10] word was God. See because God created
[11:12] that visible light and then God lived in
[11:15] that light. God dwells in that light.
[11:17] According to 1 Timothy 6:16, the same
[11:20] was in the beginning with God. All
[11:22] things were made by him and without him
[11:24] was not anything made that was made.
[11:27] Again, God used his word, his son, the
[11:29] logos, to create all things. And another
[11:32] beautiful scripture, Proverbs 8:12
[11:34] speaks of wisdom, which is the spirit of
[11:37] God before the foundation of the world.
[11:40] I wisdom dwell with prudence and find
[11:41] out knowledge of witty inventions. If
[11:44] you skip down to verses 22 through31, we
[11:48] find what wisdom did before the
[11:50] foundation of the world. In other words,
[11:52] wisdom is the logos. Wisdom is the word.
[11:55] Wisdom is the son of God. The Lord
[11:58] possessed me in the beginning of his way
[12:00] before his works of old. I was set up
[12:02] from everlasting from the beginning
[12:03] orever the earth was. When there were no
[12:06] depths, I was brought forth. When there
[12:08] were no fountains abounding with water,
[12:10] before the mountains were settled,
[12:11] before the hills, I was brought forth.
[12:13] While as yet he had not made the earth,
[12:15] nor the fields, nor the highest part of
[12:17] the dust of the world. When he prepared
[12:19] the heavens, I was there. When he set up
[12:20] a compass upon the face of the depth,
[12:22] when he established the clouds above,
[12:24] when he strengthened the fountains of
[12:25] the deep. when he gave to the sea his
[12:27] decree that the wat should not pass his
[12:29] commandment when he appointed the
[12:31] foundations of the earth. Then I was by
[12:33] him as one brought up with him and I was
[12:36] daily his delight rejoicing always
[12:38] before him rejoicing in the habitable
[12:41] part of his earth and my delights were
[12:43] with the sons of men. As a side note I
[12:46] use Proverbs 8:30 when I preached the
[12:48] dancing series. The Bible said the logos
[12:50] was rejoicing always before him. And one
[12:52] of those definitions is to play, which
[12:55] means instrumental music, singing and
[12:58] dancing. And that's how brother Brandham
[12:59] described it as well, the son playing
[13:02] before the father. And now the Bible
[13:05] teaches us that the logos went out of
[13:08] God or I might say all of the the God
[13:12] become in his first body form. When the
[13:15] logos went out of God, let's look what
[13:17] it looked like. No one has seen the
[13:18] father at any time.
[13:20] Nowhere. Never did and never will.
[13:24] But then the log go that went out of him
[13:27] become like a little halo of light.
[13:30] Let's see it playing yonder like a child
[13:32] before the doorstep of the father.
[13:36] And now
[13:39] I can see him as he moves over here and
[13:41] he draws into his his memory or his mind
[13:46] a picture of what the world should be.
[13:48] Now he's not a star or nothing. Now by
[13:51] God's grace the next step is the word
[13:53] becoming flesh. John 1 verse14. So this
[13:58] nature of the logos was made into a
[14:01] flesh body. The nature of it. And the
[14:05] word was made flesh and dwelt among us.
[14:07] And we beheld his glory, the glory as of
[14:09] the only begotten of the father, full of
[14:11] grace and truth. So the logos became
[14:14] flesh. In other words, the logos created
[14:17] a human body to come dwell in. Of
[14:19] course, that anointing came at the river
[14:22] Jordan when Jesus was baptized. And
[14:24] next, just like the logos, the body of
[14:26] Jesus was a manifestation of God. 1
[14:29] Timothy 3:16, for God was manifest in
[14:33] the flesh. The word manifestation also
[14:35] means appearing. God appeared in the
[14:37] flesh. Or we might call it a veiling.
[14:39] God was veiled in the flesh. And then
[14:42] after Jesus died, he rose again. He was
[14:44] given a glorified body according to John
[14:46] 7:39 and John 12:16.
[14:50] So now here's a visual of plural
[14:52] pronouns. Jesus uses we, us, our. That's
[14:55] because the spirit that was in Jesus was
[14:58] with the father before the foundation of
[15:00] the world. And this is the last
[15:02] remaining mystery of the godhead. Why
[15:05] does the father and son use plural
[15:08] pronouns? Remember friends, I was
[15:10] talking with a uh trinitarian preacher
[15:12] recently and I said with trinitarians I
[15:15] can start with your three persons and
[15:17] easily take it down to two because the
[15:19] father and the holy ghost are the
[15:21] self-same person. Jesus was conceived of
[15:23] the holy ghost yet he prayed to the
[15:25] heavenly father. So if you make the
[15:27] father and the holy ghost two separate
[15:29] persons then Jesus has two fathers and
[15:32] that's a lie. That's nonsense. So the
[15:34] father and the holy ghost are the
[15:35] self-same person. Jesus said in John 4
[15:38] that God is a spirit and then called his
[15:40] father. He prayed to his father and
[15:42] called him holy father. So he's a holy
[15:44] father spirit. God is a spirit. God's a
[15:47] holy spirit. So the father and the holy
[15:49] ghost are not two separate persons. They
[15:51] are one person. They're the same spirit.
[15:54] So now I told the trinitarian man
[15:55] recently I was talking to now you're
[15:57] down to two persons and I said I can
[15:59] show you in the Bible where Jesus said
[16:00] he is the I am that met Abraham and
[16:04] Philip asked Jesus in John 14 show us
[16:06] the father and he said have I been so
[16:08] long with you yet thou has not known me
[16:10] Philillip. So that takes your two
[16:12] persons and brings it down to one and
[16:15] the only remaining mystery is with the
[16:17] plural pronouns. I have this on pages 37
[16:20] through 40 of my 2021 book if you'd like
[16:24] to read more about this. Now, just to
[16:26] summarize, the best biblical answer is
[16:28] that Jesus had to use plural pronouns
[16:30] because he was both fully human and
[16:33] fully divine. Yet, his human side was
[16:36] not divine. Therefore, Jesus had to use
[16:38] a separate pronoun for himself because
[16:40] he was mortal unlike the immortal
[16:43] father. Remember friends, Jesus even
[16:46] said the father is greater than I. Jesus
[16:48] was referring to his flesh body. His
[16:50] flesh body was not God, the invisible
[16:53] spirit. His flesh body had a word nature
[16:56] and his flesh body was sinless like God.
[16:59] But his flesh body could die. Whereas
[17:02] God, the father, the invisible almighty
[17:04] spirit could never die. So I wrote Jesus
[17:07] experienced temptation in his human will
[17:09] or his human side. But the father cannot
[17:11] be tempted. Jesus died, but the father
[17:14] can never die. Jesus is a human, but the
[17:16] father is an eternal spirit.
[17:18] Consequently, a separate pronoun was
[17:20] needed for Jesus's body. Yet, he was not
[17:23] a co-equal distinct person from the
[17:25] father. He was the express image of the
[17:28] father according to Hebrews 1:3. That
[17:31] word express image means a faximile or
[17:34] an exact reproduction and that's the
[17:37] nature. And Jesus had the exact nature
[17:40] of the father. But his flesh body did
[17:42] not have the divine quality until after
[17:44] the resurrection. Then his body became
[17:46] glorified. So using plural pronouns like
[17:50] we, us, our is both scriptural and so
[17:53] much safer, reverent, and ultimately
[17:55] pleasing to God compared to the sin of
[17:57] adding uninspired words to God's
[18:00] eternal, inspired, inherent word. Like
[18:02] Proverbs 30:5 and 6 says, God's going to
[18:05] call people liars who add to the word of
[18:07] God. And like I told my friend that I
[18:10] debated on the Trinity. He's a
[18:12] Trinitarian pastor. I said, 'Look at the
[18:14] fruits of the Trinity. It came out, of
[18:16] course, before the Catholic Church
[18:18] officially denominated, but it's been
[18:20] one of their main doctrines throughout
[18:22] the history of the Catholic Church. And
[18:23] look at all the clergy abuse, scandals,
[18:25] both with clergy, priests, and with
[18:28] nuns. It's undeniable, friends. Any
[18:31] false doctrine, any addition to the word
[18:33] of God is leaven. If it's not cleaned
[18:35] out, it's only going to grow. and look
[18:37] at the extreme amount of false doctrines
[18:40] in the Roman Catholic Church. I have
[18:42] multiple videos about that if you'd like
[18:43] to watch that. I wrote a chapter about
[18:45] that in my 2021 book. Most Bible
[18:47] reformers believed the Roman Catholic
[18:49] Church was the mother harla of
[18:51] Revelation 17 and 18. And they believe
[18:53] the Pope would be the future antichrist.
[18:55] So the we, us, our is one person but one
[18:59] person with a living manifestation.
[19:02] Because remember friends, a noun is a
[19:03] person, place or thing. And the logos
[19:06] and even Jesus' human body were not a
[19:08] separate person, but they were a
[19:10] manifestation which is a thing. And God
[19:12] dwelt in that manifestation. So when you
[19:15] have more than one noun, you have to use
[19:16] plural pronouns like we, us, our. In
[19:20] closing, friends, I hope this video was
[19:21] a blessing by the grace of God. I'll
[19:23] share that in the final discussion I had
[19:25] with this trinitarian pastor. It boiled
[19:27] down to this. Both of us said we
[19:28] believed everything in the word of God.
[19:30] But it boiled down to this. He was
[19:32] adding to the word of God. And I said,
[19:34] "My dear precious friend, I don't want
[19:36] to be guilty of adding to the word of
[19:37] God. And the way you're going right now,
[19:39] you're adding to the word of God. So you
[19:41] need to be careful with that." And
[19:43] that's how I left it by the grace of
[19:44] God. But even in that impromptu debate
[19:46] we had sitting at a dinner table for
[19:48] about an hour, I didn't know it was
[19:49] going to happen. And it was kind of
[19:50] surprising and quite enjoyable because I
[19:52] don't often get to debate about the
[19:54] Godhead. I could answer all of his
[19:56] questions, but he couldn't answer my
[19:57] questions. And here's one example. I
[20:00] said, "Here's why the Trinity is so
[20:01] illogical. Why did Jesus need to be
[20:05] filled with two other persons?" I said,
[20:07] "Because your Trinity dogma says Jesus
[20:10] and the Holy Ghost and the Father are
[20:12] co-equal, co-eternal persons." So why
[20:15] does the Bible say in John 14:10 that
[20:18] the father dwelt in Jesus? Why would
[20:20] Jesus need a second person to come and
[20:23] dwell in him when he's already co-equal
[20:26] with that person? See how this is a
[20:28] total contradiction? See how it actually
[20:29] sets up tritheism. And then Luke 4:1
[20:32] says Jesus was full of the Holy Ghost.
[20:35] John 1:30 through33 shows how the spirit
[20:38] of God descended and then remained on
[20:40] Jesus. So the Holy Ghost came to dwell
[20:42] in Jesus. So now according to
[20:44] trinitarians, Jesus has two co-equal,
[20:47] co-eternal, all powerful other persons
[20:50] dwelling in his person. That's
[20:53] illogical. That's nonsense. Any honest
[20:56] person would not accept that false
[20:58] teaching. But that's what trinitarians
[20:59] have to accept according to their own
[21:02] creeds, their own definitions. And so
[21:04] the trinitarian preacher could not
[21:06] answer that along with my other
[21:07] questions. Did Jesus have two fathers?
[21:08] He couldn't answer that. He couldn't
[21:10] answer why he believed in adding to the
[21:12] word of God. the words trinity, three
[21:14] persons. So friends, we're in a much
[21:16] safer space by just believing the word
[21:17] of God, the Godhead is a mystery. But if
[21:21] you look at all these scriptures and
[21:22] visuals we had on this video, it should
[21:24] be plain that God is one person and that
[21:26] Jesus' flesh was praying to the spirit
[21:28] that was both inside him and also in
[21:31] heaven. Now you say, "How could he be
[21:33] God and be man?" See, there's the
[21:35] mystery. See, in body he was man. In
[21:40] spirit he was God.
[21:43] Someone asked me said, "Then how do who
[21:45] did he pray to in the garden of
[21:47] Gethsemane?" I said, "I'll answer you
[21:49] that when you answer this. Do you
[21:51] believe you have the Holy Ghost?" "Yes."
[21:53] I said, "Then who do you pray to?
[21:56] Where's he at when you're praying to
[21:57] him?" When you claim you have him and
[21:59] yet you're praying to him.
[22:01] See, people just they just get some
[22:04] little idea and run wild with it. You
[22:06] see, that's the way it goes. Now, in
[22:09] spirit, he was God.
[22:12] Jesus said in St. John 3, see, when the
[22:17] son of man which now is in heaven is
[22:20] standing here on earth,
[22:23] when the son of man which now is in
[22:26] heaven, how would you answer that?
[22:30] See, he said he was in heaven and here
[22:32] he was standing on earth.
[22:35] Oh my. You see that he had to be God
[22:40] ominate present.
[22:43] Sure he's present everywhere. He knows
[22:45] every thought by being omnant mission
[22:47] knowing all things he can be ominate
[22:49] present. See and that's what brother Ram
[22:51] said that's what happens with us as
[22:52] well. God is both in us by the baptism
[22:54] of the Holy Ghost. We the Bible says we
[22:56] have a measure of the Holy Ghost in us.
[22:58] A measure of the eternal God. And yet we
[22:59] look up to heaven and pray to the
[23:01] eternal father almighty God because God
[23:03] is both in us and above us. Now, we're
[23:05] not equal to Jesus. Jesus had the
[23:07] fullness of the Godhead. Jesus had the
[23:10] Holy Ghost without measure according to
[23:11] the book of John. We have it with
[23:13] measure. So, we're not making ourselves
[23:15] equal to Jesus by any means at all. We
[23:17] are sinners saved by grace. Jesus never
[23:19] sinned. Jesus is the masterpiece of God.
[23:22] Jesus is God's own son. So, hopefully
[23:24] this was helpful by the grace of God.
[23:26] Excellent question. So, I appreciate
[23:28] that brother reaching out. Appreciate
[23:29] his patience as well. Thank God for the
[23:31] revelation of the Godhead. Thank God
[23:33] that we know we can have confidence when
[23:35] we go before God. We can say we never
[23:37] added to the word of God. We never took
[23:39] away from the word of God. We believed
[23:41] everything that God said about himself
[23:43] in his holy Bible.
[23:46] If you have any questions, concerns, or
[23:47] testimonies about this video, please

[23:51] God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[23:53] the desire of your heart. Very happy to
[23:57] be here this afternoon and again in
[23:59] defense of the gospel of Jesus Christ to
[24:02] bring the good tidings, the good news
[24:04] that Jesus raised from the dead, living
[24:06] among man today, his church. The same
[24:09] Jesus that was yesterday will be today
[24:12] and forever. He has never failed.
