TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] that's good but that is just that's just being able to read [Music] the spirit has never Quicken you to either follow the word of God these people claim to believe every word that you say to be true but they don't they do believe that their own actions prove that they don't greetings friends in the mattress name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to show the fourth lie coming out of Branham Tabernacle which is a false vision of a denominational mandate to play tapes Brenham Tabernacles leadership has basically become a denomination and they want every church that calls himself a message Church who believes the end time message of God's Prophet brother William Branham to play tapes as the main part of their worship Services rather than having living men preach the Living Word of God of course we know this is a false vision recall the first lie is that every word on brother Brown's tapes are thus say the Lord the second lie is all answers are on brother branham's tapes and brother branham's words cannot fail and the third lie was that people can unquestionably believe every word on brother branham's tapes even if he lied and people don't have to have their guard up or be careful when listening to brother Branham because every word is thus say the Lord and of course these lies if believed open someone up to receiving the spirit of idolatry and other evil spirits which is why as I've said in the past the most harsh comments I've ever gotten on YouTube are not from Sinners or denominational people they're from the tape Church movement people and also recently they've stopped making comments on my videos likely because random Tabernacle leadership controls them and tells them don't listen to anything except random Tabernacles pastor and brother Branham so friends they are in a very sad State it's a cult-like denomination so we got to keep praying for them as we will in this video before playing the audio of Brenham Tabernacles leadership speaking their false Vision I want to reference my 77th video called tape boys are not part of Jesus's fivefold Ministry it's a 41 minute long video and if you want a more thorough teaching on this subject I would encourage you to go listen to that video or watch that video so now let's listen to the audio of random tabernacle's false Vision which is a denominational mandate that all churches should play tapes rather than have living preachers and just so you know I've heard Brenham Tabernacle leadership say it's okay for preachers to preach but the main emphasis has to be pressing play well of course you never find that in the Bible you never find brother Branham saying that either in this audio you'll hear Brandon Tabernacles Pastor say the message or the tapes are the absolute I'll address this lie in a future video by God's grace so let's listen to the quote there has to be a true faithful Ministry there's men of God that have true callings of God on their lives that believe this message with all their heart they preach this message with all their heart they believe it they believe this message is the absolute amen now you've got a true faithful Minister's got to believe this message is an absolute this end time message he just said it was the token which is the holy spirit it is this message so it has to be your absolute but there is got to catch the vision you got to play the tapes you've got to amen praise the Lord now that we've heard Brandon Tabernacles lie let's play that and then right after that we'll play brother random's vision for the future in 1962 taking sides with Jesus brother Brown told us his vision for the future his vision was for young ministers to be trained up in the message so that when heeded missionary work and gain new converts overseas he could send up trained ministers to go to these people and preach the message to them he said he wanted to place them worldwide but in order to do that they'd have to have ministers meetings where the Elder ministers Could Teach the younger ministers the preachers of the gospel and so brother Branham said the younger ministers could have the gospel straight and they would Influence People the right way brother random called it God's system so brother branham's Vision was centered around the fivefold ministry working together Training Up Young ministers in order to place them in new churches that would be formed from Brother branham's missionary work let's listen to the quotes but they've got to catch the vision you got to play the tapes you've got to now we're going to start off with the early church and just bring it for about five minutes now down to what they did and then I can show you the vision that I have for the future little churches and uh you want to you're doing no work gonna reward you for that go out there preach do everything you can let all of you get together you bunch of men are having meetings and popcorn deep things in the scripture and pray [Music] other ministers and that you see that that has a calling in their life for the ministry treat them young man bring them in here to the Elder already set together in a ministerial meeting and there teach the deeper things of God don't worry the one who is a leader for you and then there are churches can go here and training up a group of men and right there there's places I can place the world now what if I had a group of men young man I needed a message okay say now wait a minute before I leave here we're gonna set in our these churches we're on the road here right now to take over this a good man is two or three young men with him who will be his helpers and assistants and a church of this day who's who's in Germany oh around the Nations where I've been defends another from another comes another see what I mean if you get the preacher straight and him going right look what he's going to do he's going to enfusa it will take care of those hundreds of these things that's it we'll just be beaten system uh Jethro said the universes why you can't beat out all of them and God put counters out there saved him and took the tuck that was all Moses and put them up almost 70 hours and they probably it strengthened him you know just as much prophecy and they didn't want to cut the spirit off of the prophesied it just separated this is a major thing you come in with them at her change and I believe it's God's way now foreign let's notice the contrast between brother Branham and current Branham Tabernacle leadership in regards to their Visions brother branham's Vision was to train preachers with answers in contrast current Brenham Tabernacle leadership's vision is to ignore preachers and instead train tape boys to push play giving the people no answers to their questions like is Billy Paul the promise Joseph or not as brother Branham said in 1951 also brother Brandon's Vision was to send preachers to new converts to his bible-based message contrast that with current Branham Tabernacle leaderships false Vision to send Tate boys into established faithful Ministry churches to infiltrate them and persuade them to preach less which breaks the word of God and to tell them to just press play and Obey so who are we going to believe which Vision are we going to catch brother branham's Vision or the current false vision of Branham Tabernacle leadership let's catch brother branham's Vision because it's a bible-based vision friends I hope this was helpful notice Bram Tabernacle saying you have to copy our way of false worship it's a it's a denominational mandate they're saying you have to see the fivefold ministry the exact same way we do you've got to do it so sad they should be saying you've got to do what the Bible says like Saint Paul said and like brother Branham said brother Branham never had Brenham tabernacle's false Vision Brotherhood never had his son's false vision of the fivefold ministry that essentially exalts Tate boys above the fivefold ministry and now let's play a few quotes from Brother Branham where he tells the fivefold ministry I'm right behind you brother Adam said he's not the only one that should preach brother Ram's saying we need preachers and he says don't change a thing in regarding to evangelists continue on the field and of course current Brenham Tabernacle leadership has contradicted all these quotes from other Branham proving they do not believe brother Branham and so we know if brother Brandon was here he'd be right behind the true five full ministry living men preaching the Living Word of God as the Bible commands in Ephesians 4 verses 8-16 and in Romans 10 verses 14 and 15 the Bible said how shall they preach except they be sent notice it's they God wants they a group of men to preach the word of God just like Ephesians 4 8-16 says the fivefold ministry today brand of Tabernacle says we need one man to preach William Branham they say him one man but the Bible says they a group of men in the fivefold ministry Apostles prophets pastors teachers and evangelists let's listen to the quotes the gospel or is the time behind you but they've got to catch the vision you got to play the tapes you've got to you and just bring it for about five minutes now down to what they did and then I can show you the vision that I have for the future now brother brother one should you we have seen your we have seen you are Dean man don't believe you would do that if there were not that they were not to preach Mercy Mercy brother sister told you that nobody's preached for me you're not sure if you have four subjects with all that no don't worry imagine I'm just one little Pebble on the beach among many people uh there's this many is more eligible more worthy more of anything to preach than me I'm just one loyal you know what I mean you should preach the gospel but they've got to catch the vision you got to play the tapes you've got to go down to what they did and then I can I can show you the vision that I have for the future should evangelists continue on the field in this hour of course what they mean certainly by all means don't change a thing if Jesus is coming in the morning Preach Today and I could be it will be 10 years someday but live life's gonna be in this hour don't don't get scribbled up now that's why I'm trying to warn you about see just don't be a black recruiter don't change that but if you're doing something wrong or you're doing evil repent okay come back you're going to continue on your Evangelistic service just as you always did in closing I hope this video has been a blessing let's pray for the leadership in random Tabernacle father God in the name of Jesus Christ I come humbly and I ask God that you'd help the leadership to repent of their lies Lord God may your spirit expose the lies and false doctrines in their lives so they can be set free from these evil spirits I pray for your mercy I pray for your grace over these Souls these millions of individuals who are deceived Lord I pray you could save out of there what can be saved for your glory Lord I know you do it Lord God for the scripture says all that the father has given me will come to me and him that cometh to me in no wise will I cast out so father use these videos For Your Glory that the truth of Jesus Christ may be proclaimed we thank you in advance for your mercy in Jesus Christ's name amen foreign concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
