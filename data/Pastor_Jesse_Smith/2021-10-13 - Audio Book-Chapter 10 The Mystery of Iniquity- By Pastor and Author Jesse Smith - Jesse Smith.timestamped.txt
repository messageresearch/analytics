[0:00] chapter 10 the mystery of iniquity
[0:03] chapter 10 contains footnotes numbers
[0:05] 1602
[0:08] to 1692
[0:11] for the mystery of iniquity doth already
[0:13] work only he who now letteth will let
[0:16] until he be taken out of the way
[0:19] 2 thessalonians 2 verse 7
[0:23] knowing rome is mystery babylon the
[0:26] false mother church
[0:27] and most protestant churches are her
[0:29] daughters lead you to investigate how
[0:32] the mother-daughter team attracts nearly
[0:34] 2 billion members the bible says their
[0:37] congregations
[0:38] thrive through the deceitfulness of
[0:40] iniquity
[0:41] thus the roman catholic church is the
[0:44] mother of and propagator of iniquity
[0:48] in the greek lexicon iniquity means
[0:50] contempt and violation of the law
[0:53] wickedness
[0:54] iniquity or lawlessness is purposely
[0:57] sinning despite knowing god's will
[1:00] it's a well-covered subject in scripture
[1:02] with over 300 mentions
[1:04] paul says iniquity was already working
[1:07] at the time he was writing ii
[1:09] thessalonians around 50 a.d
[1:12] iniquities been living in and
[1:14] controlling the hearts of unrepentant
[1:16] church members for nearly 2000 years
[1:19] but it will head up in the false prophet
[1:22] the pope antichrist
[1:25] multiple examples show a lifestyle of
[1:27] iniquity or habitual sin
[1:29] brings god's wrath and judgment upon the
[1:32] guilty
[1:33] god used the joshua-led israeli army to
[1:36] drive out the amorites when their cup of
[1:38] iniquity was full in god's eyes
[1:41] interestingly god pronounced the
[1:43] amorites doomed to abraham 400 years
[1:46] prior to joshua but showed divine
[1:49] patience for their cup of iniquity to
[1:51] fill lot and his two daughters narrowly
[1:53] escaped god's fire and brimstone wrath
[1:56] upon sodom poured out due to the
[1:59] iniquity of the city
[2:00] judas iscariot's destiny was hell and
[2:04] the thirty pieces of silver he received
[2:06] for betraying christ was his reward of
[2:08] iniquity
[2:10] as the previous chapter showed mystery
[2:12] babylon is destroyed in one hour because
[2:15] her iniquities are remembered in heaven
[2:18] genuine believers will commit single
[2:20] acts of iniquity despite knowing better
[2:23] but they will always repent and change
[2:25] their future behaviors
[2:27] joseph's brothers committed iniquity by
[2:30] selling him into slavery but they
[2:32] repented and revelation shows they are
[2:34] saved crowned and seated with the twelve
[2:37] apostles around jesus's heavenly throne
[2:40] david committed iniquity by unlawfully
[2:43] taking bathsheba and numbering israel
[2:46] but repented and never repeated those
[2:48] sins
[2:49] the apostle paul admits to doing evil
[2:51] sinful acts he hated but assures
[2:54] believers jesus blood forgives all their
[2:57] trespasses
[2:58] john assures the same teaching
[3:00] confession of sins allows the faithful
[3:03] and just christ to forgive our sins and
[3:06] to cleanse us from all unrighteousness
[3:10] the universal iniquity problem was so
[3:12] great god sent his dear innocent sinless
[3:15] son jesus to die for past present and
[3:19] future iniquities
[3:21] isaiah 53 verses 5 6 and 11 say jesus
[3:25] was bruised for our iniquities and the
[3:27] lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us
[3:30] all and he justify many by bearing their
[3:33] iniquities
[3:34] this precious gift was not given in vain
[3:37] though and god now requires everyone to
[3:40] accept his son's power to purge their
[3:42] iniquities
[3:44] acts 3 verse 26 says god raised jesus
[3:47] from the dead to bless us in turning
[3:49] away every one of you from his
[3:51] iniquities
[3:53] if you truly believe in jesus you'll
[3:55] gladly accept his blessing of spiritual
[3:57] power to turn from your iniquities
[4:01] to believe in jesus means you stop
[4:03] committing iniquity mark 16 verse 16
[4:06] proclaims he that believeth and is
[4:08] baptized shall be saved but he that
[4:11] believeth not shall be damned
[4:13] sounds like everyone would believe in
[4:15] jesus and be saved right
[4:17] unfortunately all nations are going to
[4:19] be guilty of rejecting christ through
[4:21] mystery babylon's deceptive sin-loving
[4:24] religion now you'll see how this happens
[4:29] the confusion about the mystery of
[4:30] iniquity
[4:32] the confusion about iniquity centers
[4:34] around which actions lead to habitual
[4:37] iniquity and the appropriate damnable
[4:40] title of worker of iniquity which
[4:42] scripture alludes to over 30 times
[4:44] how does someone become a worker of
[4:46] iniquity and therefore worthy of the
[4:48] lake of fire
[4:49] you've probably heard church members
[4:51] attempt to condone their habitual sins
[4:54] by saying we all have our demons
[4:57] but holy ghost-filled christians should
[4:58] not be bound by demons as servants of
[5:01] satan
[5:03] the revelation of the mystery of
[5:04] iniquity is the antichrist spirit fills
[5:07] and deceives the hellbound majority
[5:10] into blaspheming god's truth under the
[5:13] guise of a sin-loving religious
[5:15] experience
[5:17] workers of iniquity are led by false
[5:19] preachers
[5:20] filled with satan's demons who appear as
[5:22] religious messengers of light but spread
[5:25] spiritual darkness
[5:26] second corinthians 11 verses 13 and 14
[5:30] described them saying for such are false
[5:32] apostles deceitful workers transforming
[5:35] themselves into the apostles of christ
[5:38] and no marvel for satan himself is
[5:40] transformed into an angel of light
[5:43] these false ones are destined for and
[5:46] worthy of hell because after knowing the
[5:48] truth they hate blaspheme and fight
[5:50] against it they are more willing to
[5:52] believe lies than bible truth
[5:56] as the specific acts of iniquity are
[5:58] identified in this chapter you'll
[6:00] conclude which groups contain a majority
[6:02] of workers of iniquity and god's wisdom
[6:05] will help you flee from them following
[6:07] after righteousness faith charity peace
[6:10] with them that call on the lord out of a
[6:12] pure heart
[6:15] biblical evidence for the revelation of
[6:17] the mystery of iniquity
[6:20] evidence abounds in support of
[6:22] iniquity's revelation and there's no
[6:24] better place to begin than with satan
[6:26] the father of iniquity
[6:28] as jesus is the epitome of godliness
[6:31] leading believers into it satan is the
[6:33] opposite the epitome of iniquity leading
[6:36] billions into it
[6:38] in satan the father of lies you see the
[6:41] same characteristics his children bear
[6:43] today
[6:46] satan the father of iniquity
[6:49] satan's given name from god is lucifer
[6:51] which means lightbearer in hebrew
[6:54] paul says satan often transforms himself
[6:57] into an angel of light but his lying
[6:59] messages enslaved souls in darkness
[7:03] ezekiel 28 verses 11 through 19 says
[7:07] lucifer began as the most bright
[7:09] beautiful angel and was equipped for
[7:11] music ministry in heaven
[7:14] he was an anointed cherub set by god to
[7:16] be a covering around his throne
[7:18] it's likely michael was the other cherub
[7:21] at god's throne as moses's ark of the
[7:23] covenant included two cherubs covering
[7:26] the mercy seat where god's presence
[7:28] dwelt
[7:30] lucifer was perfect in every way until
[7:32] iniquity was found in him as his heart
[7:35] was lifted up because of his brightness
[7:37] and beauty
[7:38] god says his iniquity willful
[7:40] disobedience corrupted his wisdom isaiah
[7:44] 14 verses 13 and 14 reveals his wicked
[7:48] thoughts to exalt himself to be like god
[7:51] for thou has said in thine heart i will
[7:54] ascend into heaven i will exalt my
[7:56] throne above the stars of god
[7:58] i will sit also upon the mount of the
[8:00] congregation in the sides of the north i
[8:03] will ascend above the heights of the
[8:05] clouds i will be like the most high
[8:09] satan infamously said i will six times
[8:13] in iniquity providing a stark contrast
[8:15] to jesus's thy will gethsemane prayer in
[8:19] godliness
[8:21] jesus directly rebukes satan for
[8:24] regarding only his will rather than gods
[8:27] in matthew 16 23
[8:29] get thee behind me satan for thou art an
[8:32] offense unto me for thou savers not the
[8:34] things that be of god but those that be
[8:37] of men
[8:38] satan and his workers are not interested
[8:40] in god's will
[8:43] revelation 12 verses 3 and 4
[8:46] and verses 7 through 11 explain
[8:49] lucifer's heavenly rebellion as he led
[8:51] the first church split
[8:53] accordingly he's given the titles great
[8:56] red dragon old serpent devil
[8:59] satan and accuser of the brethren in
[9:01] this text
[9:03] lucifer a liar and the father of lies
[9:06] convinced a third of the angels to join
[9:08] his war against michael and the holy
[9:11] angels
[9:12] michael's mighty army prevailed casting
[9:15] lucifer's army out of heaven down to
[9:17] earth and his next act mentioned is
[9:20] beguiling and deceiving a virgin named
[9:23] eve
[9:25] in summary satan's characteristics
[9:28] passed on to his children
[9:29] include disregarding and rejecting god's
[9:31] will for his own a prideful heart
[9:35] accusing others
[9:36] violent and desiring promotion worship
[9:39] and position
[9:42] satan the serpent and eve
[9:45] genesis 3 opens with the subtle sly
[9:48] serpent questioning eve on god's command
[9:51] about which trees she can eat from
[9:54] satan a spirit being had possessed the
[9:58] beast serpent some time before this
[10:00] conversation
[10:01] because all beasts were created sin free
[10:03] and good on the sixth day of creation
[10:07] once cast to earth satan came to eden
[10:10] and found adam and eve as ezekiel 28 13
[10:13] confirms
[10:14] thou hast been in eden the garden of god
[10:19] knowing he cannot be god of heaven satan
[10:21] observes adam's dominion and connives to
[10:24] take his authority and rule over the
[10:26] earth
[10:27] 2 peter 2 verse 19 reads
[10:30] for of whom a man has overcome of the
[10:32] same as he brought in bondage
[10:34] you know satan succeeded and overcame
[10:37] adam which is why paul calls him the god
[10:39] of this world satan is so shrewd and
[10:42] scripture implores you to be aware of
[10:44] his devices that ye may be able to stand
[10:47] against the wiles of the devil
[10:50] back to genesis 3 eve correctly quotes
[10:53] god's fruit command in reply to the
[10:55] serpent but you find satan doing the
[10:58] same tactic he used in heaven
[11:00] lying and accusing
[11:02] genesis 3 verses 4 through 5 record
[11:05] satan's lie she won't die by touching
[11:08] and eating the forbidden fruit and his
[11:10] accusing god of keeping her from an
[11:13] exalted state of wisdom and existence
[11:16] verse 6 says deceived eve believed the
[11:19] serpent and ate the fruit deciding it
[11:21] was good to eat pleasant looking and
[11:24] able to make her wise
[11:26] you're aware eve then gives the fruit to
[11:29] adam and he eats but read first timothy
[11:32] 2 14 to gain an important truth
[11:34] and adam was not deceived but the woman
[11:37] being deceived was in the transgression
[11:40] adam not present at eve's eating finds
[11:43] her and knows she's defiled and destined
[11:45] for death his only choices are to
[11:47] abstain from eating and let her die
[11:50] alone
[11:51] or eat and die with her in hope of god's
[11:54] forgiveness
[11:55] knowing she was part of him taken from
[11:57] his rib he loves her and becomes a type
[11:59] of christ taking her sin upon him eating
[12:03] the fruit
[12:04] christ purposely chose to take his bride
[12:06] sin upon himself
[12:08] and die to redeem her
[12:11] notice satan stealing killing and
[12:13] destroying in eden like jesus warns us
[12:17] in john 10 verse 10
[12:18] the thief cometh not but for to steal
[12:22] and to kill and to destroy i am come
[12:24] that they might have life and that they
[12:27] may have it more abundantly satan first
[12:30] stole adam's place in eve's heart as
[12:32] genesis 3 verse 16 says eve's desire or
[12:36] longing will be to adam after the fall
[12:40] this means eve longed for the serpent
[12:41] instead of adam then satan killed adam
[12:44] and eve as death literally entered their
[12:47] bodies and eventually took their lives
[12:50] lastly the tempter destroyed their holy
[12:52] sinless state and marital unity
[12:57] the original sin the forbidden fruit and
[13:00] the seed of the serpent
[13:02] you might be wondering how could one
[13:04] apple cause all sin and trouble in the
[13:07] world
[13:08] eve didn't eat an apple because second
[13:10] peter 1 verse 4 says corruption is in
[13:13] the world through lust
[13:15] the forbidden fruit that caused the
[13:17] original sin was a lustful sexual act of
[13:20] adultery between eve and the serpent
[13:23] according to the following nine
[13:24] evidences but first here's a bible-based
[13:27] summary
[13:28] as you'll soon see eve's sexual
[13:31] immorality reveals the mystery of why
[13:33] jesus christ had to be born of a virgin
[13:38] eve's adultery with the serpent is often
[13:40] called the serpent seed doctrine based
[13:42] upon god's own words in genesis 3 verse
[13:45] 15
[13:46] in which he is speaking directly to the
[13:48] serpent
[13:49] and i will put enmity between thee and
[13:51] the woman and between thy seed and her
[13:53] seed it shall bruise thy head and thou
[13:56] shalt bruise his heel
[13:58] notice your god says the serpent has
[14:00] seed or offspring
[14:02] descendants children in the hebrew
[14:04] lexicon and this is immediately after
[14:07] the fall
[14:08] the fruit eve partook of and shared with
[14:10] adam created two seeds or sets of
[14:13] children
[14:15] the forbidden fruit and two trees
[14:18] tree of life entry of knowledge of good
[14:21] and evil have symbolic not literal
[14:24] meanings
[14:25] the forbidden fruit symbolizes adultery
[14:27] because proverbs 30 verse 20 and song of
[14:30] solomon 4 verses 12 through chapter 5
[14:33] verse 1
[14:34] teach eating can represent sexual
[14:36] relations
[14:38] proverbs 30 verse 20 says such is the
[14:40] way of an adulterous woman she eateth
[14:43] and wipeth her mouth and saith i have
[14:46] done no wickedness
[14:47] this explains exactly what eve did she
[14:50] was deceived into committing adultery
[14:52] with the serpent thinking she had done
[14:54] no wrong when adam found her defiled
[14:58] some believe song of solomon chapter 4
[15:01] verse 12 through chapter 5 verse 1
[15:04] records the wedding night of solomon and
[15:06] the shulamite but it's undeniable eating
[15:09] represents sexual relations in this
[15:11] passage
[15:12] solomon calls her a garden and she
[15:14] invites him to come into his garden and
[15:17] eat his pleasant fruits
[15:19] he says one of her plants is the
[15:20] pomegranate comparing it to her
[15:22] beautiful head within her locks of hair
[15:25] and she says she's going to bring him
[15:27] into her mother's house and cause him to
[15:30] drink of spiced wine of the juice of my
[15:33] pomegranate
[15:35] e first committed adultery with the
[15:37] serpent lost her virginity and conceived
[15:40] the serpent's seed as paul alludes to in
[15:43] second corinthians 11 verses 2 and 3.
[15:46] for i am jealous over you with godly
[15:47] jealousy for i have espoused you to one
[15:50] husband that i may present you as a
[15:52] chaste virgin to christ but i fear lest
[15:55] by any means as the serpent beguiled eve
[15:58] through his subtilty so your mind should
[16:00] be corrupted from the simplicity that is
[16:03] in christ
[16:05] adam then found her fallen in sin and
[16:08] partook in sexual relations with her
[16:10] causing her to conceive of his seed
[16:13] cain was the seed of the serpent and
[16:15] abel was adam's seed
[16:17] twins conceived of two separate fathers
[16:19] is called
[16:20] superfecundation according to the
[16:22] journal of forensic sciences
[16:26] nine evidences support the revelation of
[16:28] the serpency doctrine
[16:30] evidence one the bible supports the
[16:33] serpent seed doctrine from genesis to
[16:35] revelation
[16:36] moses jesus paul peter and john all
[16:40] support the serpent seed doctrine
[16:42] through their teachings
[16:45] moses is the author of genesis and
[16:46] recorded genesis 3 verse 15
[16:49] in which god himself begins the
[16:51] serpent's seed doctrine saying the
[16:53] serpent has a seed or offspring which
[16:56] proved to be cain for he was of that
[16:58] wicked one
[17:00] our lord jesus teaches the serpent seed
[17:02] in matthew 13 verses 24-30 and verses
[17:07] 36-43
[17:09] in this parable jesus describes the
[17:11] children of god as good seed while the
[17:14] children of the wicked one satan are the
[17:16] tares or bad seed
[17:18] the parable which has numerous
[17:20] applications
[17:22] teaches two different men or sowers
[17:24] planted two different seeds in one field
[17:27] in one application the two men are
[17:29] represented as jesus the son of man
[17:32] and satan the enemy and the field
[17:34] represents the world
[17:36] in another application this parable
[17:38] helps reveal the origin from eden of the
[17:41] two kinds of children the children of
[17:43] god and the children of the devil
[17:45] two males the serpent and adam planted
[17:48] their seeds in one field or one woman
[17:51] eve the seeds or offspring grew and
[17:54] manifested their different natures cain
[17:57] the son of the serpent slew righteous
[17:59] abel for cain was of the cursed seed
[18:03] paul supports the serpent's seed in
[18:05] second corinthians 11 verses 2 and 3 by
[18:08] directly comparing the virginity of the
[18:10] church in corinth to ease virginity when
[18:13] she was presented to adam
[18:15] paul said it was his desire to present
[18:17] the corinthians as a chaste virgin or
[18:20] spiritual virgin to christ
[18:22] then paul says he feared the minds of
[18:25] the corinthians would be corrupted and
[18:27] they would lose their spiritual
[18:28] virginity just as the serpent corrupted
[18:31] the mind of eve causing her to lose her
[18:33] spiritual virginity before losing her
[18:36] physical virginity
[18:38] peter supports the servant seed in
[18:40] second peter 1 verse 4 stating
[18:43] corruption is in the world through lust
[18:45] or a desire for what is forbidden
[18:48] genesis 3 verse 6 says eve thought the
[18:51] tree was pleasant looking and good for
[18:53] food meaning she was physically
[18:55] attracted to the serpent
[18:57] then god declares one consequence for
[18:59] eve's sin is that her desire will be to
[19:01] her husband from henceforth
[19:04] this means her desire was not to her
[19:06] husband when she fell in sin to her
[19:08] lustful desire to the serpent who gave
[19:11] her his seed
[19:14] john teaches the serpent seed in 1st
[19:16] john chapter 3 verses 6 through 15.
[19:20] verse 12 records the holy spirit saying
[19:22] cain was of that wicked one and adam was
[19:25] not the wicked one for this phrase
[19:27] always refers to satan
[19:29] jesus calls satan the wicked one twice
[19:32] in matthew 13 verses 19 and 38
[19:36] john mentions the wicked one three other
[19:37] times in his same letter and each time
[19:40] it means satan not adam
[19:44] cain even has a separate genealogy from
[19:46] adams in genesis 4 verses 17 through 24
[19:50] as adams is found in genesis 5 verses
[19:53] 1-32
[19:55] seth was a son in his adam's own
[19:58] likeness after his image but the bible
[20:01] never says this about cain
[20:03] furthermore the bible states that eve
[20:06] was the mother of all living in genesis
[20:08] 3 verse 20 but scripture never says adam
[20:11] was the father of all living because he
[20:13] was not
[20:14] the serpent was the father of cain and
[20:16] eve was his mother
[20:19] john in revelation 12 9 calls satan that
[20:23] old serpent because he entered and
[20:25] possessed the beast serpent in eden
[20:28] the title old refers to satan as the
[20:30] father of lies and murder from the
[20:33] beginning according to our lord jesus in
[20:36] john 8 44.
[20:38] his wickedness is seen in genesis and
[20:40] continues to revelation but thankfully
[20:43] that old serpent comes to his fiery end
[20:46] through the justice and wrath of
[20:47] almighty god at the battle of gog and
[20:50] magog
[20:52] evidence number two
[20:54] the two trees in the midst of the garden
[20:55] were not literal trees because the tree
[20:58] of knowledge of good and evil was not
[21:00] good for food
[21:02] the two trees tree of life entry of
[21:05] knowledge of good and evil
[21:07] symbolized jesus and satan or the holy
[21:10] spirit and satan's spirit
[21:12] these two trees were different from all
[21:14] other trees in eden genesis 2 verse 9
[21:17] says every tree out of the ground was
[21:18] good for food
[21:20] proving the tree of knowledge of good
[21:22] and evil was not a regular tree
[21:24] because when eve partook of its fruit
[21:27] sin and death occurred
[21:28] two truths about this evil tree are
[21:30] evident it didn't come from the ground
[21:33] and its fruit was not good for food
[21:36] any tree whose fruit will kill you isn't
[21:38] good for food
[21:40] notice genesis 3 verse 6 says eve
[21:43] believed the fruit was good for food so
[21:45] this is symbolic of her eating the fruit
[21:47] of adultery
[21:49] any sinful act is a fruit of satan just
[21:51] as god's prophet rebuked israel for
[21:53] eating the fruit of lies in hosea
[21:56] chapter 10 verse 13
[21:59] evidence number three the tree of life
[22:02] was jesus spirit because there is only
[22:04] one way to eternal life
[22:06] if the tree of life was a normal tree
[22:08] like a pear tree it would mean god had a
[22:11] second
[22:12] works-based way to inherit eternal life
[22:15] eating physical food never has and never
[22:18] could give eternal life since eating
[22:20] cannot pardon sin
[22:22] but there has always been and always
[22:23] will be one way to eternal life by faith
[22:26] in god the holy spirit
[22:29] hebrews 11 shows all believers from the
[22:32] beginning are saved by faith as abel was
[22:34] righteous because of his faith
[22:37] similarly hebrews 11 26 says moses
[22:41] followed christ or the holy spirit
[22:44] so salvation by faith was the same in
[22:46] the old testament as in the new
[22:48] jesus claims he is the way
[22:50] the life the bread of life
[22:53] with the words of eternal life
[22:55] he's the only way to eternal life and
[22:57] it's only found in him according to john
[23:00] 5 40 and 1st john 5 verses 11 and 12.
[23:05] evidence number 4 the serpent seed
[23:08] explains the purpose of the virgin birth
[23:10] of jesus
[23:11] the revelation of jesus's mysterious
[23:13] virgin birth is found in this doctrine
[23:16] since mankind's fall into sin came by
[23:19] sex god had to redeem man without sex
[23:22] and then give him divine power over the
[23:24] sin nature
[23:27] the original human race was corrupted
[23:28] through the serpent's seat as the sin
[23:30] nature was passed down to every person
[23:33] from their parents
[23:34] job 14 verse 1 says
[23:36] man that is born of a woman is of a few
[23:39] days and full of trouble
[23:41] the same truth is found in psalms 51
[23:43] verse 5.
[23:45] behold i was shaping in iniquity and in
[23:48] sin did my mother conceive me
[23:51] god's lamb his son jesus christ had to
[23:54] come to earth through virgin birth to
[23:56] bypass the way sin came into the world
[24:00] sexual reproduction
[24:02] since the sin nature wasn't passed down
[24:04] to jesus he could live a sinless life
[24:06] instead of a sin nature jesus had a word
[24:09] nature in his body because he was
[24:11] conceived of the holy ghost
[24:13] jesus was the word made flesh
[24:16] the purpose of the virgin birth was
[24:18] twofold
[24:19] prepare a sinless lamb sacrifice to pay
[24:22] for all sins and begin a new human race
[24:26] the first fold is magnified in
[24:28] revelation 5 verses 1 through 10 in
[24:31] which no man in heaven or on earth was
[24:33] found worthy to lose the seven seals
[24:36] until the virgin-born lamb of god came
[24:38] forward to take the book
[24:40] our redeemer had to be virgin born
[24:42] without the serpent's sin nature inside
[24:44] him
[24:46] jesus's virgin birth allowed for a new
[24:48] human race to begin
[24:50] in revelation 3 verse 14 jesus says he
[24:53] is the beginning of the creation of god
[24:55] and paul says jesus is the firstborn
[24:58] among many brethren
[24:59] meaning jesus was the first among many
[25:02] to experience the new birth
[25:04] every born-again believer today has
[25:06] mighty holy ghost power in their souls
[25:09] like jesus said
[25:11] after jesus received the indwelling
[25:12] power of the holy ghost at his river
[25:15] jordan baptism he was led into the
[25:17] wilderness to be tempted of the devil
[25:20] jesus's new soul power was going to be
[25:22] tested in jesus's threefold temptation
[25:25] he defeated the same spirit who defeated
[25:28] eve by simply quoting and obeying the
[25:30] word god was proving his gift of the
[25:32] holy ghost baptism could withstand
[25:35] satan's strongest attacks
[25:37] even though eve first sinned in a garden
[25:39] her seed foretold in genesis 3 verse 15
[25:43] through the power of the holy ghost
[25:44] baptism would eventually crush the head
[25:47] of the serpent in another garden
[25:49] gethsemane
[25:51] jesus preached about the new birth and
[25:54] urged his disciples to receive it
[25:56] because it would be their inward power
[25:57] to become a new creature from the inside
[26:00] out
[26:01] spirit-filled christians still battle
[26:03] the sin nature in their members
[26:05] but the word nature in their souls is a
[26:07] greater overcoming power according to
[26:10] first john 4 verse 4
[26:12] ye are of god little children and have
[26:14] overcome them because greater is he that
[26:17] is in you than he that is in the world
[26:20] evidence number five
[26:22] adam and eve covered their loins after
[26:24] eating of the forbidden fruit
[26:26] genesis 3 verses 6 and 7 says adam and
[26:30] eve knew they were naked after eating
[26:31] the forbidden fruit and sowed fig leaves
[26:34] to make aprons or loin coverings in
[26:37] hebrew
[26:38] the loins are the area of the human
[26:40] reproductive parts and they covered
[26:42] their private parts because those were
[26:44] the body parts used in their sinful
[26:46] downfall
[26:49] if the forbidden fruit was an apple they
[26:51] would have covered their mouths with
[26:52] figs or soda hood to cover their heads
[26:55] but it was not a literal fruit
[26:58] also if eating apples caused adam and
[27:00] eve to know they were naked why can't we
[27:02] pass out apples to nearly naked women on
[27:05] beaches so they'll know they're near
[27:07] nakedness and put on modest clothes
[27:10] understand eating a natural apple never
[27:13] has and never will bring awareness of
[27:16] sin and evil
[27:18] just like it did for adam and eve sexual
[27:20] sin always produces feelings of shame in
[27:23] nakedness as ezekiel 16 verses 35
[27:27] through 41 teaches
[27:29] verses 35 and 36 say
[27:31] wherefore o harlot hear the word of the
[27:33] lord
[27:34] thus saith the lord god because thy
[27:36] filthiness was poured out and thy
[27:39] nakedness discovered through thy
[27:40] whoredoms with thy lovers
[27:43] nahum 3 verse 5 agrees
[27:46] behold i am against thee saith the lord
[27:48] of hosts and i will discover thy skirts
[27:50] upon thy face and i will show the
[27:52] nations thy nakedness and the kingdoms
[27:55] thy shame
[27:56] jeremiah 13 26 is another witness saying
[27:59] therefore will i discover thy skirts
[28:01] upon thy face that thy shame may appear
[28:06] evidence number six
[28:07] god's punishments for eve's sin centered
[28:10] on her sexual reproduction and longing
[28:13] for adam
[28:15] in genesis 3 verse 16 god issues a
[28:18] two-fold punishment on eve because she
[28:20] was deceived by the serpent
[28:22] unto the woman he said i will greatly
[28:24] multiply thy sorrow and thy conception
[28:27] in sorrow thou shalt bring forth
[28:29] children and thy desire shall be to thy
[28:31] husband and he shall rule over thee
[28:35] the first fold of god's punishment was
[28:37] she would experience multiplied or
[28:39] increased sorrow from the conception of
[28:42] to the delivery of children the first
[28:44] consequence of eve's sin focused on her
[28:47] sexual reproduction of seed or offspring
[28:50] recognized throughout the bible god's
[28:52] punishments or consequences always fit
[28:54] the crimes
[28:56] for example exodus 21 verse 24 says an
[28:59] eye for an eye tooth for a tooth hand
[29:02] for hand foot for foot
[29:04] a second example is david's sin of
[29:06] adultery with bathsheba both punishments
[29:08] fit his crime
[29:10] first the sword of blood would never
[29:12] depart his house because he had uriah's
[29:14] innocent bloodshed
[29:16] second david's wives were taken from him
[29:19] and absalom laid with them publicly
[29:22] because david laid with bathsheba
[29:24] privately
[29:26] in eve's case god was no different than
[29:28] he was with israel and david
[29:31] all women experienced the pain and
[29:32] suffering in bringing forth seed or
[29:35] offspring as a constant universal
[29:38] reminder from god to all of eve's
[29:40] daughters that she willingly received or
[29:43] accepted the wrong seed in the beginning
[29:45] from the serpent
[29:47] since eve broke her marriage covenant
[29:49] and received the wrong seed she would
[29:51] experience suffering bringing forth
[29:53] annie and all seed
[29:54] because e failed in the area of sexual
[29:56] reproduction all women have increased
[29:59] suffering and sexual reproduction
[30:03] if eve ate a literal apple why didn't
[30:05] god punish her mouth and all apple trees
[30:08] god's punishments focused on human
[30:10] reproduction and the body parts of the
[30:13] loins used for that process
[30:16] the second vote of god's punishment upon
[30:19] eve was her desire
[30:21] or longing and craving would be to her
[30:23] own husband
[30:25] as god's punishments fit the crimes he
[30:27] commands eve to desire crave and long
[30:30] for her own husband which means that
[30:32] before god's command eve desired or
[30:35] longed for someone else other than adam
[30:37] you know it was the serpent and the
[30:39] fruit of adultery eve longed for as she
[30:41] was guilty of lust
[30:43] 2 peter 1 verse 4 declares sin entered
[30:46] the world through lust
[30:49] notice adam in genesis 3 verse 20
[30:51] recognizing eve is pregnant a mother
[30:55] he names her eve because her name means
[30:58] life and he knew she was the mother of
[31:00] all living
[31:01] adam listened to god's words in genesis
[31:03] 3 verse 15
[31:05] and knew two separate seeds were already
[31:07] living and growing inside of eve's womb
[31:10] and she would be the mother of all
[31:11] living persons whether they were good or
[31:14] evil
[31:15] when eve received the wrong seed the
[31:17] serpent's seed she became a mother the
[31:19] mother denomination the roman catholic
[31:21] church did the same she became the blind
[31:24] mother church by receiving satan's lies
[31:27] his seed of discrepancy
[31:30] most readers think genesis 4 verse 1 is
[31:32] the first mention of sexual reproduction
[31:35] but adam's naming eve as a mother in
[31:38] genesis 3 verse 20 proof genesis 3 verse
[31:41] 6 is the first mention of intercourse
[31:43] spoken figuratively
[31:46] previous to adam naming her eve had no
[31:49] individual name for god called both adam
[31:51] and his wife adam according to genesis 5
[31:54] verse 2
[31:55] male and female created he them and
[31:58] blessed them and called their name adam
[32:00] in the day when they were created
[32:03] eve's fall from her united name with
[32:05] adam shows how false churches make their
[32:07] own names catholic methodist baptists
[32:11] etc but the true bride church is
[32:13] restored back to sharing a name with her
[32:15] husband jesus
[32:17] for this cause i bow my knees unto the
[32:19] father of our lord jesus christ of whom
[32:22] the whole family in heaven and earth is
[32:24] named
[32:26] evidence number seven the serpent was
[32:28] human-like before the fall
[32:31] careful bible study about the serpent in
[32:33] genesis 3 reveals he was very different
[32:36] than snakes today so different in fact
[32:39] he had three human-like attributes first
[32:42] verse 1 says the serpent was more subtle
[32:45] meaning shrewd sly or crafty than any
[32:48] other beast of the field that the lord
[32:50] had made
[32:51] he was the only beast god made with the
[32:53] ability to talk with intellectual
[32:55] reasoning
[32:56] observing those human-like
[32:57] characteristics satan selected the
[33:00] serpent to possess
[33:02] so he could deceive eve as he was
[33:04] present in eden satan and his demons
[33:06] often possess animals or beasts as
[33:09] matthew 8 verses 31-32 teaches
[33:14] second the serpent was an upright
[33:16] creature before the fall because after
[33:18] the fall in verse 14 god curses the
[33:21] serpent to go on his belly the rest of
[33:23] his days
[33:24] originally the serpent was likely in
[33:26] between a chimpanzee and a man but
[33:29] closer to a man standing upright and
[33:32] able to carry an intellectual
[33:34] conversation with the deceived eve
[33:38] third the serpent had seed that united
[33:40] with eve's egg cell causing her to
[33:43] conceive the serpent's own seed
[33:45] according to god in genesis 3 verse 15.
[33:49] because of this god cursed the serpent
[33:51] he changed every bone in the serpent's
[33:53] body so that he had to crawl on the
[33:55] ground but left genetic information in
[33:58] the serpent as proof of his punishment
[34:01] in october 2015 the university of
[34:04] georgia discovered snakes once had legs
[34:07] researchers reported snakes have dna
[34:09] that controls the development and growth
[34:12] of limbs
[34:13] two years later my children read about
[34:15] this finding in a national geographic
[34:17] kids magazine which said snakes once had
[34:20] legs
[34:21] friend god's word and its revelation
[34:23] even in regards to snakes and the
[34:25] serpent seed is eternally true
[34:29] evidence number eight cain was the
[34:31] serpent's son and not adams according to
[34:34] the holy spirit in 1st john 3 verse 12
[34:37] cain was not the son of adam
[34:40] not his cain who was of that wicked one
[34:42] and slew his brother and wherefore slew
[34:44] he him because his own works were evil
[34:47] and his brothers righteous
[34:49] as shown earlier the wicked one refers
[34:51] to satan not adam since adam is called a
[34:54] son of god in luke 3 verse 38.
[34:58] here you find the truth of two separate
[34:59] seed lines atoms and the serpents
[35:03] eve's womb carried two different seeds
[35:06] or sons from separate impregnations
[35:09] she carried twins with cain's conception
[35:12] sometime previous to abel's
[35:14] to those who think that this is
[35:16] impossible you need only study super
[35:18] fecundation
[35:20] as mentioned in the july 1994 journal of
[35:23] forensic sciences article
[35:26] these two separate seeds had separate
[35:28] characteristics
[35:30] adam's seed was blessed in genesis 5
[35:32] verse 2 and matthew 25 34
[35:36] while the serpent seed was cursed in
[35:39] genesis 4 verse 11 and matthew 25 41
[35:43] concerning curses god himself cursed
[35:46] both the serpent and cain and all lost
[35:48] humanity who are sent to the lake of
[35:51] fire are called the cursed
[35:53] note god did not curse adam and eve
[35:55] because he cannot both curse and bless
[35:58] his children according to numbers 22
[36:01] verse 12.
[36:02] instead the ground was cursed for adam's
[36:04] sake in genesis 3 verse 17.
[36:09] cain's seed life bore the full spiritual
[36:12] characteristics of satan for he was a
[36:14] liar and murder just like his daddy in
[36:17] genesis 4 verses 8 and 9 and john 8
[36:20] verse 44.
[36:22] due to their opposite characteristics
[36:24] god gave cain a separate lineage from
[36:26] atoms
[36:28] one crucial point of emphasis is the two
[36:31] physical genetic seed lines of adam and
[36:34] cain are no longer separate in the days
[36:36] of noah the literal seed of the serpent
[36:39] passed through the ark through the
[36:40] marriages of noah's sons and has now
[36:43] intermingled with the godly seed all
[36:46] mankind are currently affected by the
[36:48] genetic pollution of the serpent seed
[36:50] since the generations after the flood
[36:52] until today god's seed is known by the
[36:55] reception of spiritual seed faith in
[36:58] their souls and not a natural genetic
[37:00] seed
[37:01] abraham and lot had righteous souls when
[37:04] receiving the seed word of god's promise
[37:06] by faith in the new testament god's
[37:09] blessed seed are recognized by the fact
[37:12] they are born again of the incorruptible
[37:14] seed the word of god the holy ghost seal
[37:17] in their souls
[37:19] evidence number nine the seed of the
[37:21] woman was a literal man jesus
[37:24] and so was the seed of the serpent a
[37:26] literal man cain
[37:29] nearly all believers agree the seed of
[37:31] the woman spoken in genesis 3 verse 15
[37:34] was jesus christ a literal man who
[37:37] bruised the serpent's head through his
[37:39] death and resurrection victory over sin
[37:41] and death
[37:42] if the woman seed jesus was a man child
[37:45] born apart from human male
[37:47] instrumentality the seed of the serpent
[37:50] would have to come in the same pattern
[37:52] kane fits this pattern as he was a
[37:54] literal man who came into the world
[37:57] apart from human male instrumentality he
[37:59] came through the male serpent seed
[38:03] as the seed of the woman jesus was god's
[38:05] way to produce his word nature in the
[38:08] human race
[38:09] since satan does not have creative power
[38:11] like god genesis 3 shows how he injected
[38:14] his wicked sin nature into the human
[38:17] race through cain the serpent's seed
[38:21] genesis 4 verse 1 is the literal
[38:24] interpretation of the symbolism in
[38:26] genesis 3 verse 6.
[38:29] genesis 4 verse 1 is often used to try
[38:31] to disprove the serpent's seed but god's
[38:34] revelation shows how it fits into the
[38:36] truth of original sin
[38:38] it reads and adam knew eve his wife and
[38:42] she conceived and bear cain and said i
[38:45] have gotten a man from the lord
[38:48] everyone understands the word new means
[38:50] sexual relations but this verse is only
[38:53] a repeat of genesis 3 verse 6 where an
[38:56] eve shares the fruit with adam the
[38:58] previous nine evidences support this for
[39:01] the fruit of adultery and eve sexual
[39:04] relations with adam produced two seeds
[39:08] genesis 4 verse 1 repeats genesis 3
[39:11] verse 6 with a literal interpretation
[39:14] along with further information about the
[39:16] act including cain's name and gender
[39:19] simply put genesis 3 verse 6 is symbolic
[39:23] and genesis 4 verse 1 is literal the
[39:25] bible often switches from symbolic to
[39:27] literal interpretation
[39:29] as easily seen in revelation chapters 17
[39:32] and 18.
[39:33] chapter 17 verses 3 and 4 symbolically
[39:36] describe a seven-headed beast and an
[39:39] evil woman but their literal
[39:41] interpretations are found in chapter 17
[39:44] verse 9 and chapter 18 verse 10 as the
[39:47] seven heads mean seven mountains and the
[39:50] woman represents a city
[39:53] additionally genesis has multiple events
[39:55] repeated in succeeding chapters with
[39:58] additional information provided such as
[40:01] in chapters 1 and 2.
[40:02] genesis 1 verses 26-31 records mankind's
[40:07] creation on day 6 but genesis 2 verse 7
[40:11] and verses 21-22
[40:13] gives more information about the same
[40:15] event by detailing how god created adam
[40:18] and eve's bodies from the dust of the
[40:21] earth and breathe life into them
[40:24] before moving on believers do not need
[40:26] to accept the serpent-seed doctrine to
[40:29] be saved since it does not pertain to
[40:31] salvation
[40:32] justification by faith is the doctrine
[40:34] needed for salvation
[40:37] but the servancy doctrine shines more
[40:39] light upon the gospel story taking away
[40:42] the confusion about original sin
[40:44] knowing the forbidden fruit was adultery
[40:47] not an apple helps you understand why
[40:49] god sent jesus christ via virgin birth
[40:52] sin came into the world through sex so
[40:55] our deliver from sin's curse had to be
[40:57] virgin born and free from the sin nature
[41:00] in order to take all our iniquities upon
[41:03] him and pay our sin debt
[41:06] iniquity's attributes in satan and kane
[41:10] having found iniquity starting place in
[41:12] lucifer's heart and his injection of his
[41:15] nature into the human race in cain
[41:17] you witness iniquity's six attributes
[41:20] although there could be more
[41:21] armed with this knowledge you must
[41:23] discern and withstand the wicked one his
[41:25] demons and his human children while
[41:28] diligently doing opposite works
[41:31] first the lawless go through vain
[41:34] beautiful religious acts and create
[41:36] their own traditions
[41:38] it's uncertain how long lucifer helped
[41:40] lead heaven's worship while having
[41:43] iniquity in his heart but it's certain
[41:45] he went through some acts in vain
[41:47] his words from isaiah 14 verse 14 prove
[41:50] he wanted the religious worship to
[41:52] continue but with him as the object and
[41:55] recipient
[41:57] cain in a religious act brought a
[42:00] beautiful colorful offering of fruits
[42:03] fully aware it was not what god required
[42:05] to onlookers his fruit may have looked
[42:08] more classy pious and beautiful than
[42:10] abel's bloody lamb offering but god
[42:13] rejected it
[42:14] satan always hides behind worldly beauty
[42:17] while god hides in simplicity
[42:19] jesus had no beauty that we should
[42:21] desire him
[42:23] genesis 4 verses 6 and 7 show the lord
[42:26] questioning cain about his anger
[42:28] regarding his rejected offering
[42:31] saying he'd accept him if he only
[42:33] offered the correct sacrifice
[42:35] cain went through his religious act
[42:37] willingly and stubbornly disobedient
[42:42] religious acts are often masks
[42:44] the wicked hide behind
[42:46] the serpent hid his agenda behind a
[42:48] religious promise for eve to become like
[42:51] god
[42:52] recall jesus saying false doctrine is
[42:54] hidden among truth like yeast is mixed
[42:57] in dough in his parable on the leaven
[42:59] hid in three measures of meal
[43:01] more will be taught on the religion mask
[43:04] later in this chapter
[43:07] paul teaches workers of iniquity have a
[43:09] form of godliness or outward resemblance
[43:12] of godliness in second timothy 3 verses
[43:15] 1-7 outwardly they look holy but are
[43:18] void of inward holiness never coming to
[43:20] believe all the truth
[43:22] the apostle says they slowly corrupt
[43:24] themselves and others like leavens slow
[43:27] spreading by creeping into houses and
[43:30] leading families into lustful
[43:31] indulgences
[43:34] iniquity-filled worshipers like kane
[43:37] create their own traditions to teach and
[43:38] live by rather than adhering to gods
[43:41] matthew 15 captures jesus christ
[43:44] rebuking the scribes and pharisees for
[43:46] transgressing god's commands by their
[43:49] traditions
[43:50] he says their worship is vain because
[43:52] they teach man-made commands instead of
[43:54] scripture
[43:55] jewish leaders in jesus day were using
[43:58] the oral law
[43:59] later organized and called the mishnah
[44:01] in 3rd century a.d to interpret the
[44:04] written law of moses
[44:06] nearly all modern churches create their
[44:08] own mishnas called bylaws and creeds
[44:11] being equally guilty of transgressing
[44:14] god's word by their sinful traditions
[44:17] thus you can say all bible denying
[44:19] man-made religions and denominations
[44:22] started in genesis through cain's
[44:24] example
[44:26] no matter how religious a person seems
[44:28] discern his heart to see if he believes
[44:31] the truth which leads to the next
[44:33] attribute
[44:36] iniquity workers do not abide in the
[44:38] truth and therefore despise it
[44:40] jesus describes satan accordingly saying
[44:43] he abode not in the truth
[44:45] lucifer left his original heavenly
[44:47] position and cain left his family after
[44:50] murdering abel cain was marked by god
[44:52] and went out from the presence of the
[44:54] lord
[44:55] first john 2 verses 18 and 19 says
[44:58] antichrists iniquity workers leave
[45:01] groups of true worshipers saying they
[45:03] went out from us but they were not of us
[45:06] for if they had been of us they would no
[45:08] doubt have continued with us but they
[45:10] went out that they might be made
[45:12] manifest that they were not all of us
[45:16] concerning cain's mark you already
[45:18] learned the mark of the beast is
[45:20] received when a person rejects god's
[45:22] mark the baptism of the holy ghost for
[45:25] the final time
[45:26] paul calls this a reprobate mind in
[45:29] three instances
[45:32] cain despised the truth about offerings
[45:34] being wroth because god required blood
[45:36] rather than his fruit offering
[45:38] paul says the perishing unrighteous ones
[45:41] despise the truth that could save them
[45:44] in 2 thessalonians 2 verse 10
[45:46] and with all deceivableness of
[45:48] unrighteousness in them that perish
[45:50] because they receive not the love of the
[45:52] truth that they might be saved you must
[45:55] love the truth and abide in it
[45:58] third the lawless deny the full power of
[46:01] the holy spirit
[46:02] god's spirit urged cain to repent while
[46:05] reminding him the spirit could empower
[46:07] him to rule over his brother if he only
[46:09] obeyed but cain denied the spirit's work
[46:13] jesus explains in matthew 7 verses 21-27
[46:17] workers of iniquity accept temporary
[46:19] power to perform miracles in his name
[46:22] but reject god's power to help them do
[46:25] his will in their daily habits
[46:27] acts 7 51 shows stephen rebuking the
[46:30] israeli high priest and jewish council
[46:33] because they always resisted the holy
[46:35] ghost despite their religious acts
[46:39] paul says they're guilty of denying the
[46:40] power of godliness despite having its
[46:43] outward resemblance christianity's power
[46:46] is faith in jesus blood as hebrews 13
[46:49] verses 20 21 says the blood of the
[46:52] everlasting covenant
[46:54] makes you perfect in every good work to
[46:56] do his will working in you that which is
[46:59] well pleasing in his sight through jesus
[47:01] christ the holy spirit is the life of
[47:04] jesus blood so when you obey the spirit
[47:07] you're accepting the power of the blood
[47:10] fourth satan's children lie
[47:13] jesus says satan is a liar and the
[47:15] father of lies in john 8 44
[47:19] cain lied to our holy god in genesis 4
[47:21] verse 9 claiming he didn't know where
[47:24] abel was after murdering him in a field
[47:27] second peter 2 verse 19 declares false
[47:29] preachers promise hears blessings they
[47:32] themselves never attain
[47:34] revelation 21 verse 8 teaches
[47:37] unrepentant liars are cast alive into
[47:39] the lake of fire
[47:42] fifth the wicked persecute and kill the
[47:44] righteous
[47:45] lucifer verbally accused heaven's
[47:47] leadership before waging his losing
[47:50] campaign to persecute angels and
[47:52] overthrow heaven
[47:53] his accusations against believers
[47:56] continue without ceasing day and night
[47:58] according to revelation 12 verse 10.
[48:02] kane committed the first murder rising
[48:04] up against his brother abel and slaying
[48:06] him in a field in matthew 23 verses 34
[48:10] and 35 jesus distinguishes the act of
[48:13] murder as a key trait when recognizing
[48:15] the serpent seed saying that upon you
[48:18] may come all the righteous bloodshed
[48:20] upon the earth from the blood of
[48:22] righteous abel unto the blood of
[48:24] zacharias son of barackias whom he slew
[48:28] between the temple and altar
[48:30] christ says the pharisees are guilty of
[48:32] all the bloodshed from abel to zacharias
[48:35] that's compounded guilt from four
[48:37] thousand years worth of martyrs
[48:41] while unrepentant murderers will surely
[48:43] perish jesus says many are in danger of
[48:46] hell fire for harboring unjust anger
[48:49] against others even if they never hurt
[48:51] anyone this shows a sinner can murder
[48:54] someone in their heart even without
[48:56] committing the violent act
[48:59] worldly sorrow versus godly sorrow or
[49:02] true repentance
[49:04] sixth satan's seed sorrows over their
[49:07] sins but never repents
[49:10] paul calls this worldly sorrow and it
[49:12] needs its own section
[49:14] workers of iniquity feel bad after
[49:16] sinning but never repent and change
[49:18] their behavior
[49:20] there's no record of wicked cain
[49:22] expressing godly sorrow for murdering
[49:24] abel but he does express worldly sorrow
[49:27] after god curses him from the earth
[49:30] sentencing him to become a fugitive and
[49:32] vagabond
[49:33] the pitiful lying wretched cain is only
[49:36] sorry for himself
[49:38] complaining about his punishment for
[49:40] murder having no remorse for his dead
[49:42] brother
[49:43] serpent seed only care for themselves
[49:47] in his second letter to the corinthians
[49:49] paul rejoices that his first letter made
[49:51] them sorrowful unto repentance
[49:54] the apostle distinguishes between two
[49:56] kinds of sorrow worldly and godly
[49:59] now i rejoice not that ye were made
[50:01] sorry but that ye sorrowed to repentance
[50:04] for ye were made sorry after a godly
[50:06] manner that ye might receive damage by
[50:08] us in nothing
[50:10] for godly sorrow worketh repentance to
[50:12] salvation
[50:13] not to be repented of but the sorrow of
[50:16] the world worketh death
[50:19] sorrow is emotional pain or grief
[50:22] both sinners and saints experience after
[50:24] sinning god builds this painful
[50:27] conviction into every human spirit
[50:29] called conscience
[50:31] along with a soul thirst and no god so
[50:33] there are no excuses on judgment day
[50:36] souls who choose hell are worthy of its
[50:38] torment because they refused to respond
[50:40] correctly to their sorrow rather than
[50:42] forsaking their sin and accepting our
[50:44] loving god's forgiveness they chose to
[50:47] hate holiness fight against and
[50:49] blaspheme it god strives with man
[50:52] sometimes for decades but if a man won't
[50:54] repent the lord gives him over to
[50:56] believe the lies he loves
[50:59] paul writes and for this cause god shall
[51:01] send them strong delusion that they
[51:03] should believe a lie
[51:05] that they all might be damned who
[51:06] believe not the truth but had pleasure
[51:08] in unrighteousness
[51:10] repentance is the goal of painful
[51:12] emotional sorrow
[51:14] true repentance is threefold a change of
[51:16] mind and behavior
[51:18] making amends for sin and hating sin
[51:21] the first son in jesus's parable of two
[51:24] sons asked to work in their father's
[51:26] vineyard displays a change of mind and
[51:28] behavior
[51:29] initially the first son refused his
[51:31] father's command to work but repented
[51:34] and did the work zacchaeus models making
[51:37] amends for sins
[51:39] as he pledges to restore fourfold the
[51:41] amount he'd gain by false accusation
[51:44] paul saved and born again admits hating
[51:47] his sins he sometimes committed jude 1
[51:50] verse 23 says to hate any sin defilement
[51:53] in our lives
[51:54] hating even the garment spotted by the
[51:56] flesh
[51:58] worldly sorrow is deceiving because a
[52:01] sinner exudes emotion feeling awful for
[52:03] a sins but the threefold requirement for
[52:06] repentance or the fruits meat for
[52:08] repentance is never visible in his life
[52:12] sadly i've witnessed worldly sorrow
[52:14] firsthand twice praying at an altar with
[52:16] an emotional man for a combined three
[52:18] hours only to see him immediately return
[52:21] to his wickedness
[52:22] bible examples of worldly sorrow include
[52:25] pharaoh called a vessel unto destruction
[52:28] admitted his sin against the lord on
[52:30] multiple occasions even asking moses to
[52:33] bless him but continually harden his
[52:35] heart after each admission of guilt
[52:38] exodus 8 verse 15 chapter 9 verse 27
[52:42] chapter 10 verse 26
[52:44] chapter 12 32
[52:46] and romans 9 verses 14 through 27.
[52:51] balaam admitted his sin in going to
[52:53] balak when he talked with the angel of
[52:54] the lord yet was permitted to go on
[52:57] account of his love for money and was
[52:59] later slain by israel numbers 22 34
[53:03] chapter 31
[53:04] verse 8 2 peter 2 verses 12 through 22
[53:10] aiken acknowledged his sin against the
[53:12] lord but in his fierce anger was stoned
[53:15] and burnt by israel joshua 7 verses
[53:18] 16-26
[53:21] king saul admitted his sins of rebellion
[53:23] and stubbornness against god to the
[53:25] prophet samuel
[53:27] yet spent years hunting david's life
[53:29] until his repentance shortly before his
[53:32] death and salvation first samuel 15
[53:35] verses 10 through 31
[53:37] chapter 26 verse 21 and chapter 28 verse
[53:41] 19.
[53:43] ahab upon hearing god's assessment of
[53:45] his abominable idolatrous and wicked
[53:48] life temporarily humbled himself with
[53:50] fasting and rent clothes but soon
[53:53] returned to his hatred for holiness and
[53:55] died in shame first kings 21 verses
[53:58] 28-29
[54:00] chapter 22 verse 8 and verses 29-38
[54:05] judas iscariot repented and returned the
[54:08] 30 pieces of silver he earned for
[54:10] betraying jesus but went and hung
[54:12] himself sealing his doom matthew 27
[54:15] verses 3 through 10 acts chapter 1 verse
[54:18] 25
[54:21] how iniquity originates in and fills
[54:24] human minds
[54:26] as lucifer's example teaches iniquity
[54:29] originates in the heart or mind your
[54:31] mind is your conscience state wherein
[54:33] thinking occurs and decisions are made
[54:36] while your soul is your conscience
[54:38] nature
[54:40] every soul begins with a god-given holy
[54:42] thirst to know god and long for his
[54:45] fellowship so men are without excuse on
[54:47] judgment day
[54:49] like a man ignoring his need to get help
[54:51] from a doctor iniquity begins when a
[54:53] mind ignores its soul's need to know god
[54:57] iniquity workers fill their minds with
[54:59] evil instead of good purposely starving
[55:02] their souls hunger and thirst for
[55:04] holiness
[55:05] when an iniquity-filled sinner makes a
[55:08] final determination he will never submit
[55:10] to his thirst for god's fellowship god
[55:13] gives him over to a reprobate mind
[55:15] also known as the mark of the beast
[55:19] luke 12 verses 16 through 21 records a
[55:22] rich man's decision to silence his
[55:24] soul's thirst for god his crop harvest
[55:27] was so great he had to decide to store
[55:29] up treasure for himself or god
[55:32] sadly he chose personal treasures
[55:34] his mind said to his soul
[55:36] soul thou hast much goods laid up for
[55:39] many years take thine ease eat drink and
[55:42] be merry
[55:44] jesus calls him a fool because he should
[55:46] have given his extra food to others
[55:48] which would have resulted in heavenly
[55:50] treasure rather than selfishly saving it
[55:52] for himself
[55:54] all acts of disobedience are done by
[55:57] evil spirits influencing human minds
[56:00] eve is the first human example of
[56:02] disobeying god's word after letting her
[56:04] mind be influenced by the serpent's lie
[56:07] paul supports this in ephesians 2 verse
[56:09] 2 saying sinners walk according to
[56:11] satan's fallen angels or spirits that
[56:15] now work in the children of disobedience
[56:17] evil spirits cause humans to do evil
[56:19] works
[56:20] as a believer your spirit works by love
[56:23] and faith according to galatians 5 6.
[56:27] ephesians 2 verse 3 says we are all
[56:29] guilty at one point of fulfilling the
[56:32] desires of the flesh and of the mind and
[56:34] were by nature the children of wrath
[56:36] even as others
[56:38] your body mind and soul all have desires
[56:41] you know the body and mind only have
[56:43] evil desires so god's children crucify
[56:46] the desires of the body and mind and
[56:48] bring them into subjection to the holy
[56:50] desires of their souls
[56:52] galatians 5 24 reads and they that are
[56:55] christs have crucified the flesh with
[56:58] the affections and lusts
[57:01] people commit sins after yielding their
[57:03] minds to harbor and accept evil thoughts
[57:06] devils annoy and live in their minds
[57:09] indeed their minds become a home for
[57:11] devils which paul warns us of in
[57:14] ephesians 4 verse 27 saying neither give
[57:17] place to the devil
[57:18] then paul calls demon-controlled minds
[57:21] strongholds in second corinthians 10
[57:23] verse 4
[57:25] for the weapons of our warfare are not
[57:26] carnal but mighty through god to the
[57:29] pulling down of strongholds the wicked
[57:31] have spiritual castles or fortresses set
[57:34] up by demons in their minds
[57:37] sinners willingly let fallen angels live
[57:39] in and control their minds they are
[57:42] guilty of thinking the bible has errors
[57:44] god doesn't heal anymore sexual sins
[57:47] have no consequences or god doesn't
[57:49] exist
[57:50] the mighty weapon of god's word is the
[57:52] only power that can bring down these
[57:54] fortresses
[57:57] after a person sins once it's easier to
[57:59] commit the same sin the next time
[58:02] sinning becomes a habit evil habits are
[58:04] from evil spirits just as the opposite
[58:07] is true godly habits are from the holy
[58:09] spirit
[58:11] matthew 12 verses 25 through 30
[58:14] illustrates godly habits being spoiled
[58:17] or ruined by devils entering once strong
[58:20] minds
[58:21] the lord likens a believer to a man
[58:23] dwelling in his house stocked with goods
[58:25] demons then enter the house and steal
[58:27] the goods christ is saying a strong
[58:29] believer can possess goods or habits of
[58:32] his kingdom but have those habits stolen
[58:35] by opening the door of his mind to lies
[58:37] and deceitful thoughts paul urges us not
[58:41] to give heed or open the door to
[58:43] seducing spirits and doctrines of devils
[58:46] don't allow yourself to think evil
[58:48] thoughts
[58:50] jesus teaches the strong man or faith is
[58:53] bound by a devil and then the house is
[58:55] plundered a devil who constantly robs
[58:57] believers today is the evil spirit of
[59:00] fear second timothy 1 verse 7 teaches us
[59:03] fear causes weakness hatred and mind
[59:06] trouble because god's spirit gives the
[59:09] opposite power love and a sound mind the
[59:13] fear demon paralyzes faith robbing your
[59:16] confidence in god like israel's fear of
[59:18] the giants while at kadesh barnia
[59:21] numbers chapter 14 shows the evil report
[59:24] of the ten spies caused fear to spread
[59:26] like wildfire among the israelis despite
[59:29] caleb and joshua's valiant attempt to
[59:32] raise faith
[59:33] it was too late fear demons had already
[59:36] spoiled israel's spiritual goods
[59:38] friend don't allow satan to steal your
[59:41] confidence joy strength song victory or
[59:45] faith
[59:47] imagine every evil thought satan brings
[59:49] you as a box of poisonous snakes a
[59:51] delivery man wants you to sign for in
[59:54] the natural it's your american right to
[59:56] deny any package sent to your door
[59:59] just because someone sent you death
[1:00:00] doesn't mean you have to accept it if
[1:00:02] the box is left at your door don't bring
[1:00:05] it inside take it to the burn pile and
[1:00:07] ignite it in jesus name just as paul
[1:00:10] shook the serpent off himself and cast
[1:00:12] it into the fire
[1:00:14] satan is sending lies to billions today
[1:00:17] and when he sends you death turn him
[1:00:19] down by quoting god's word resist the
[1:00:21] devil and he will flee
[1:00:24] keep your mind free from corruption or
[1:00:26] defilement as paul says in second
[1:00:28] corinthians 11 verse 3
[1:00:31] give your mind over completely to jesus
[1:00:33] and his words
[1:00:34] speak the truth in love and season your
[1:00:36] words with grace rather than bitterness
[1:00:39] he says men of corrupt minds are
[1:00:41] destitute of truth
[1:00:43] specifically resist truth and hold
[1:00:45] perverted disputes
[1:00:47] renewing your mind is the way to keep
[1:00:49] corrupt thoughts from ruling your mind
[1:00:52] you can't help from thinking evil
[1:00:54] thoughts but you can cast them away like
[1:00:57] a farmer you can't keep birds from
[1:00:59] nesting in your barn but you can drive
[1:01:01] them out once you're aware of their
[1:01:02] presence
[1:01:03] second corinthians 10 verses 5 and 6
[1:01:06] teaches your god-given control over
[1:01:08] thoughts will lead to obedience
[1:01:10] casting down imaginations and every high
[1:01:13] thing that exalteth itself against the
[1:01:15] knowledge of god and bringing into
[1:01:17] captivity every thought to the obedience
[1:01:19] of christ
[1:01:20] and having in a readiness to revenge all
[1:01:23] disobedience when your obedience is
[1:01:25] fulfilled
[1:01:27] revelation 12 verses 10 and 11 teaches
[1:01:30] you overcome satan by two things
[1:01:33] jesus's blood and your verbal testimony
[1:01:36] jesus blood provides redemption and
[1:01:38] total forgiveness when you confess your
[1:01:40] sins
[1:01:41] your verbal testimony is speaking or
[1:01:43] swinging god's word sword against satan
[1:01:47] and his demons like jesus cutting down
[1:01:49] satan's temptations in matthew 4 by
[1:01:51] saying it is written you cut down
[1:01:54] satan's traps by obeying the word and
[1:01:56] rebuking satan he failed in this the
[1:01:59] battlefield of the mind but you can
[1:02:01] overcome
[1:02:02] the only way you know you're an
[1:02:03] overcomer is by overcoming so daily
[1:02:06] confess your sins and defeat satan by
[1:02:08] speaking god's word and casting down his
[1:02:11] deceitful lies
[1:02:12] it doesn't matter what you have to
[1:02:14] overcome as long as you know how to
[1:02:16] overcome because god's word is the
[1:02:18] greatest power in the universe
[1:02:21] stockpiles of scriptures say the evil
[1:02:24] are full of darkness meaning their minds
[1:02:26] are totally full of evil thoughts
[1:02:28] peter condemns these beastly-minded
[1:02:30] sinners saying they have eyes full of
[1:02:32] adultery and that cannot cease from sin
[1:02:35] beguiling unstable souls and heart they
[1:02:38] have exercised with covetous practices
[1:02:41] cursed children they fill their minds
[1:02:43] with debauchery and habitually sin
[1:02:46] if you are filled with a love for god's
[1:02:48] word you'll serve him but if you hate
[1:02:50] truth you'll be full of darkness and
[1:02:52] serve the world according to jesus but
[1:02:55] if thine i be evil thy whole body shall
[1:02:57] be full of darkness if therefore the
[1:02:59] light that is in thee be darkness how
[1:03:01] great is that darkness
[1:03:03] no man can serve two masters for either
[1:03:05] he will hate the one and love the other
[1:03:08] or else he will hold to the one and
[1:03:09] despise the other ye cannot serve god
[1:03:12] and mammon
[1:03:14] paul describes the minds of homosexuals
[1:03:16] in a similar manner saying their minds
[1:03:19] knew god's word but refused to retain it
[1:03:22] therefore god gave them over to a
[1:03:23] rejected or reprobate mind being filled
[1:03:26] with all unrighteousness for this cause
[1:03:29] god gave them up unto vile affections
[1:03:32] for even their women did change the
[1:03:34] natural use into that which is against
[1:03:36] nature and likewise also the men leaving
[1:03:39] the natural use of the woman burned in
[1:03:41] their lust one toward another men with
[1:03:44] men working that which is unseemly and
[1:03:47] receiving in themselves that recompense
[1:03:49] of their heir which was meat
[1:03:51] and even as they did not like to retain
[1:03:53] god in their knowledge god gave them
[1:03:56] over to a reprobate mind to do those
[1:03:58] things which are not convenient being
[1:04:00] filled with all unrighteousness
[1:04:02] fornication wickedness covetousness
[1:04:05] maliciousness
[1:04:07] full of envy murder debate deceit
[1:04:10] malignity
[1:04:11] whisperers backbiters haters of god
[1:04:14] deceitful proud boasters inventors of
[1:04:17] evil things disobedient to parents
[1:04:20] without understanding covenant breakers
[1:04:23] without natural affection implacable
[1:04:26] unmerciful who knowing the judgment of
[1:04:28] god
[1:04:29] that they which commit such things are
[1:04:31] worthy of death not only do the same but
[1:04:34] have pleasure in them that do them
[1:04:37] the iniquity-filled scribes pharisees
[1:04:40] and sadducees
[1:04:42] lucifer and cain were religious but
[1:04:44] their acts were eventually meaningless
[1:04:47] their iniquity-filled hearts hid behind
[1:04:49] religious masks until their true colors
[1:04:51] were manifest
[1:04:53] fast forward to jesus's earthly ministry
[1:04:55] and the scribes pharisees and sadducees
[1:04:58] repeat the same religious vanity
[1:05:01] two portions of scripture highlight the
[1:05:03] depths of iniquity in these groups
[1:05:05] jesus sermon on the mount and his eight
[1:05:08] woes discourse against them in the week
[1:05:11] leading up to his crucifixion
[1:05:14] matthew chapters 5 through 7 contained
[1:05:16] the most details on jesus sermon on the
[1:05:19] mount partially taught in private to his
[1:05:21] disciples but also to a great audience
[1:05:24] in chapter 5 jesus's beatitudes
[1:05:27] emphasized blessings upon spiritual
[1:05:29] purity his disciples were to keep and
[1:05:32] teach his commands
[1:05:34] in sincerity and their righteousness was
[1:05:36] to exceed that of the pharisees the
[1:05:38] legalist popular religious party of the
[1:05:41] day
[1:05:42] our lord magnifies moses law giving
[1:05:45] insight on anger mental lust adultery
[1:05:48] swearing resisting not evil giving and
[1:05:52] loving enemies
[1:05:54] matthew chapter 6 records jesus's three
[1:05:56] attacks on religious hypocrites residing
[1:05:59] in jewish synagogues which would include
[1:06:01] the aforementioned pharisees messiah
[1:06:04] blasts hypocritical almsgiving praying
[1:06:07] and fasting urging believers to do more
[1:06:09] secret service in god's sight instead of
[1:06:12] public service in man's sight
[1:06:14] public worship reformed for man's praise
[1:06:17] yields no heavenly reward
[1:06:19] jesus shows the religious hypocrites
[1:06:21] really serve mammon or riches and not
[1:06:24] god
[1:06:26] true worshipers seek first jesus kingdom
[1:06:28] rather than basic human needs
[1:06:32] in matthew chapter 7 jesus's fourth
[1:06:34] hypocritical charge is on those who
[1:06:37] judge others despite being guilty of the
[1:06:39] same sins
[1:06:40] our lord promises to hear our prayers
[1:06:42] and proclaims the golden rule fulfills
[1:06:45] the law and the prophets
[1:06:48] chapter 7 ends with a sobering concise
[1:06:51] contrast between true and false religion
[1:06:54] jesus says there are two gates two ways
[1:06:57] two kinds of prophets two trees with
[1:06:59] separate fruits and two kinds of
[1:07:01] builders using two different foundations
[1:07:04] the two builders
[1:07:05] workers of iniquity and wise workers
[1:07:08] express the difference between sayers
[1:07:10] versus doers
[1:07:11] iniquity-filled builders give god lip
[1:07:14] service saying lord lord but fail to do
[1:07:17] god's will
[1:07:18] wise workers perform god's will as
[1:07:20] chapter 11 of this book pursues in depth
[1:07:24] the few wise workers seek find and enter
[1:07:28] the straight or narrow gate leading to
[1:07:31] eternal life
[1:07:32] most people choose the easy to find
[1:07:34] broad way as workers of iniquity whose
[1:07:37] end is destruction in the lake of fire
[1:07:40] both types of prophets look like sheep
[1:07:42] but the workers of iniquity are greedy
[1:07:44] wolves inwardly they're also likened to
[1:07:47] corrupt trees known by their corrupt
[1:07:49] fruits or sinful deeds
[1:07:52] verses 21-23
[1:07:54] revealed a shocking truth that wolf
[1:07:56] preachers temporarily have god's genuine
[1:07:59] anointing for legitimate miracles and
[1:08:01] signs but spend most of their lives in
[1:08:04] disobedience and habitual sin
[1:08:07] jesus specifically denounces their works
[1:08:09] as they did not keep god's laws
[1:08:12] proof of knowing jesus is obeying him
[1:08:15] and working righteousness
[1:08:17] in verses 24 through 27 jesus says you
[1:08:21] build your life upon a solid rock by
[1:08:23] hearing and doing his commands
[1:08:25] chapter 5 of this book identifies this
[1:08:27] rock as genuine divine faith
[1:08:30] wisely listening to jesus helps you add
[1:08:33] virtue to your faith then knowledge
[1:08:35] temperance patience godliness brotherly
[1:08:38] kindness and charity
[1:08:40] spiritual rains and floods cannot
[1:08:42] destroy this kind of life in contrast a
[1:08:45] life built on loose sinful sandy living
[1:08:48] comes to desolation in the storms of
[1:08:50] life
[1:08:50] great is the fall of the lying
[1:08:52] testimonies of religious wolves
[1:08:54] matching the great falling away
[1:08:56] predicted in the end days when the
[1:08:58] antichrist is revealed
[1:09:01] moving on to matthew 23 you read jesus's
[1:09:04] scathing discourse of eight woes against
[1:09:07] the scribes and pharisees one chapter
[1:09:10] after he silenced their foolish
[1:09:11] questions
[1:09:12] observe jesus in verse 28 saying they
[1:09:15] are full of hypocrisy and iniquity
[1:09:17] that said messiah calls them children of
[1:09:20] hell serpents and a generation of vipers
[1:09:23] they are the demon-possessed spiritual
[1:09:25] seed of the serpent
[1:09:28] a woe is an exclamation of grief in the
[1:09:30] greek and jesus eight woes for their
[1:09:33] hypocrisy include
[1:09:35] woe for not entering jesus's kingdom and
[1:09:38] keeping others out chapter 23 verse 13
[1:09:42] woe for devouring widows money and
[1:09:45] offering long pretend prayers chapter 23
[1:09:48] verse 14
[1:09:50] woe for worldwide travel to make doubly
[1:09:52] wicked hell-bound converts
[1:09:54] chapter 23 verse 15
[1:09:57] woe for swearing or making invalid oaths
[1:10:00] while exalting religious gifts for
[1:10:02] selfish gain chapter 23 verses 16-22
[1:10:07] woe for straining over or
[1:10:09] over-emphasizing details of commands
[1:10:12] while omitting the weightier matters of
[1:10:14] the law
[1:10:15] judgment mercy and faith chapter 23
[1:10:19] verses 23 and 24
[1:10:21] woe for dressing clean and holy while
[1:10:24] being inwardly dirty full of robbery and
[1:10:27] incontinence
[1:10:28] chapter 23 verse 25
[1:10:31] woe for being like cleaned whited
[1:10:33] gravestones yet being full of death
[1:10:36] uncleanness hypocrisy and iniquity
[1:10:40] woe for honoring dead prophets yet
[1:10:42] disobeying them and being children of
[1:10:44] their murderers chapter 23 verses 29-33
[1:10:50] jesus ends this discourse by promising
[1:10:53] to send his true servants prophets wise
[1:10:55] men and scribes
[1:10:57] to these hypocrites some of whom they
[1:10:59] will kill
[1:11:00] as always the guilt of bloodshed would
[1:11:02] be upon the workers of iniquity our lord
[1:11:05] laments for the entire city of jerusalem
[1:11:08] whom god tried to bring close to him but
[1:11:10] they would not love him back
[1:11:14] there they crucified him and crucifying
[1:11:17] jesus afresh
[1:11:19] four words in luke 23 33
[1:11:22] there they crucified him
[1:11:24] hold depths of meaning to the mystery of
[1:11:26] iniquity in context the words reveal the
[1:11:29] extreme wickedness workers of iniquity
[1:11:32] stoop to
[1:11:34] there in jerusalem the city of god the
[1:11:36] most holy place on earth
[1:11:39] they the world's most powerful
[1:11:41] government rome in agreement with
[1:11:43] israelis the most holy people on earth
[1:11:46] crucified the world's most gruesome
[1:11:49] tortuous painful death
[1:11:51] him the world's most holy innocent
[1:11:54] perfect person
[1:11:55] jesus
[1:11:57] you read it right the most religious
[1:11:59] people commit the most wicked crimes
[1:12:02] against the most holy person they claim
[1:12:04] to love
[1:12:05] israel god's own people came to this
[1:12:08] truth-hating condition by sins slow
[1:12:11] spreading and all-encompassing effects
[1:12:14] pride covetousness and complete
[1:12:16] spiritual corruption overcame israel's
[1:12:19] leaders and people
[1:12:22] shockingly the hebrews author teaches
[1:12:24] christ is constantly crucified afresh
[1:12:27] by individuals who publicly disgrace
[1:12:30] jesus
[1:12:31] did you know jesus is crucified daily
[1:12:33] not physically but spiritually because
[1:12:36] workers of iniquity disobey truth and
[1:12:39] teach others to do the same
[1:12:42] hebrews 6 verses 1 through 8 explains
[1:12:45] christ is presently crucified by ones
[1:12:47] who temporarily experience god's
[1:12:49] blessings
[1:12:50] only to publicly disobey jesus's
[1:12:52] teachings at a later time
[1:12:55] verse 6 says apostates crucify to
[1:12:57] themselves the son of god afresh and put
[1:13:00] him to an open shame
[1:13:02] in god's eyes these rebellious ones are
[1:13:05] like thorn bushes who rejoice in
[1:13:07] receiving rain but produce sharp prickly
[1:13:10] thorns
[1:13:11] likewise the religious lawless enjoy the
[1:13:13] blessings and feelings of god's spirit
[1:13:16] but commit sharp despicable iniquities
[1:13:18] they are like judas publicly kissing
[1:13:21] jesus in betrayal for selfish benefit
[1:13:25] hebrews 10 verse 29 describes their
[1:13:27] crucifixion of truth as smashing it
[1:13:29] under their feet
[1:13:31] of how much sore punishment suppose ye
[1:13:33] shall he be thought worthy who hath
[1:13:35] trodden underfoot the son of god and
[1:13:38] hath counted the blood of the covenant
[1:13:40] wherewith he was sanctified an unholy
[1:13:42] thing and hath done despite unto the
[1:13:44] spirit of grace sore punishments await
[1:13:47] those who deny the spirit's work of
[1:13:49] continuous sanctification
[1:13:51] god's gracious holy spirit leads us to a
[1:13:54] sanctified life not a sinful disobedient
[1:13:57] life
[1:13:59] this proves one can temporarily receive
[1:14:01] god's grace but then fail to let it
[1:14:03] continue its cleansing work
[1:14:05] grace never fails believers but workers
[1:14:08] of iniquity can fail grace by rejecting
[1:14:10] it
[1:14:11] follow peace with all men and holiness
[1:14:14] without which no man shall see the lord
[1:14:16] looking diligently lest any man fail of
[1:14:19] the grace of god lest any root of
[1:14:21] bitterness springing up trouble you and
[1:14:23] thereby many be defiled
[1:14:27] multitudes of preachers currently
[1:14:29] crucify the effects of the holy spirit
[1:14:31] by denying the true interpretation of
[1:14:33] god's word
[1:14:35] yes the ones who mention the cross are
[1:14:37] often the enemies of the cross for their
[1:14:39] god is their belly and wallet they deny
[1:14:42] the power needed to live a holy life
[1:14:44] giving license for immorality while
[1:14:47] presenting an outwardly clean wealthy
[1:14:49] appearance
[1:14:51] jude 1 verse 4 foretold the wicked would
[1:14:54] turn grace into lawlessness paul says
[1:14:57] from such turn away
[1:15:00] real christians do experience daily
[1:15:01] crucifixion
[1:15:03] dying daily like paul to their selfish
[1:15:05] desires
[1:15:06] jesus urgently requires daily cross
[1:15:09] caring in luke 9 23
[1:15:12] paul says proof of you belonging to
[1:15:14] christ is that you crucify and mortify
[1:15:17] the deeds and lust of the flesh and the
[1:15:19] world
[1:15:20] you'll either crucify god's word or
[1:15:22] crucify your selfish lusts with god's
[1:15:25] word
[1:15:26] christians kill their own sinful wills
[1:15:28] so they can perform god's will
[1:15:32] the mystery of iniquity continued
[1:15:33] working in paul's day through many
[1:15:36] antichrists
[1:15:38] jesus's iniquity-filled religious
[1:15:40] opponents succeeded in killing him but
[1:15:43] he resurrected and filled his followers
[1:15:45] with the holy ghost in power
[1:15:47] christ's followers have battled the
[1:15:49] workers of iniquity ever since
[1:15:52] paul says the mystery of iniquity a
[1:15:54] sin-loving religious guise was already
[1:15:57] working at the time he wrote second
[1:15:59] thessalonians around 51 a.d
[1:16:02] he said it would continue until heading
[1:16:04] up in that wicked person the antichrist
[1:16:07] as second thessalonians 2 verses 7 and 8
[1:16:10] proclaims for the mystery of iniquity
[1:16:12] doth already work only he who now
[1:16:14] letteth will let until he be taken out
[1:16:17] of the way
[1:16:18] and then shall that wicked be revealed
[1:16:20] whom the lord shall consume with the
[1:16:22] spirit of his mouth and shall destroy
[1:16:24] with the brightness of his coming
[1:16:27] a few antichrist doctrines paul rebuked
[1:16:30] include a legalistic requirement for
[1:16:33] circumcision
[1:16:34] declaring the rapture already occurred
[1:16:36] required abstinence from marriage and
[1:16:38] meat eating paul goes as far as saying
[1:16:41] the iniquity-filled church-goers hate
[1:16:43] sound doctrine keeping to themselves
[1:16:46] false teachers who tickle their ears and
[1:16:48] turn them from truth to believe fables
[1:16:52] nearly 50 years later in 100 a.d the
[1:16:55] apostle john gave the workers of
[1:16:56] iniquity a new label antichrists
[1:17:00] first john 2 verse 18 declares little
[1:17:02] children it is the last time and as ye
[1:17:05] have heard that antichrist shall come
[1:17:07] even now are there many antichrists
[1:17:10] whereby we know that it is the last time
[1:17:13] in the greek lexicon antichrists means
[1:17:16] adversaries of the messiah
[1:17:19] john continues describing antichrists
[1:17:22] saying they eventually leave true
[1:17:23] churches deny jesus as the christ
[1:17:26] deny the father and son and fail to
[1:17:29] confess jesus christ has come in the
[1:17:30] flesh
[1:17:31] the world's 1.5 billion muslims one
[1:17:34] billion hindus
[1:17:36] and millions of buddhists atheists and
[1:17:38] agnostics all deny jesus as the christ
[1:17:41] proving they are antichrists but more
[1:17:44] scripture needs examined to see how many
[1:17:46] of the 2 billion professing christians
[1:17:48] are antichrists as well
[1:17:52] recognizing antichrists by their
[1:17:54] hell-deserving and non-kingdom works
[1:17:59] antichrists abound today as paul
[1:18:01] foretold their drastic increase waxing
[1:18:04] worse and worse but promised the holy
[1:18:06] scriptures would make us wise unto
[1:18:08] salvation in second timothy 3 verses
[1:18:11] 13-15
[1:18:14] in addition to jesus's previously
[1:18:15] mentioned descriptions of the lawless
[1:18:18] you recognize modern antichrists by
[1:18:20] their hell-deserving and non-kingdom
[1:18:23] works
[1:18:24] revelation 21 verses 7 and 8 2 peter 2
[1:18:28] verses 9 through 22
[1:18:30] and jude 1 verses 1 through 25 lists
[1:18:33] specific sins of hellbound souls you'll
[1:18:36] see some overlap in the list and i'm
[1:18:38] leaving repeats for emphasis of course
[1:18:41] all these sins can be repented of so
[1:18:43] souls can be saved but jesus says few
[1:18:46] will choose the narrow way leading to
[1:18:48] life
[1:18:50] in revelation 21 john says the fearful
[1:18:53] and unbelieving and the abominable and
[1:18:55] murders and whoremongers and sorcerers
[1:18:58] and idolaters and all liars shall have
[1:19:00] their part in the lake which burneth
[1:19:02] with fire and brimstone
[1:19:05] peter's second epistle lists the
[1:19:07] following hell deserving acts
[1:19:09] walking in fleshly lusts despising
[1:19:12] government being self-willed speaking
[1:19:15] evil of good adultery sin addiction
[1:19:18] coveting loving money forsaking the
[1:19:21] right way serving corruption unbridled
[1:19:24] lusts and other pollutions of the world
[1:19:28] jude's powerful chapter tallies these
[1:19:30] damning acts
[1:19:32] turning grace into lawlessness
[1:19:34] fornication
[1:19:35] sinfully defiling one's flesh despising
[1:19:38] dominion speaking evil of dignities
[1:19:41] corrupting oneself greed not fearing god
[1:19:45] shameful violence wandering ungodly
[1:19:48] deeds hard speeches murmuring
[1:19:51] complaining walking after one's own
[1:19:54] lusts and mocking
[1:19:57] antichrists act in opposition to the
[1:19:59] kingdom of god and paul provides three
[1:20:02] texts to identify their non-kingdom
[1:20:04] works to eliminate any confusion about
[1:20:06] who is in jesus kingdom and who isn't
[1:20:09] first corinthians 6 verses 9 through 11
[1:20:12] galatians 5 verses 19 through 26 and
[1:20:16] ephesians 5 verses 1 through 8. greek
[1:20:19] definitions in parentheses follow
[1:20:21] unfamiliar words for understanding
[1:20:25] in the corinthians text paul says be not
[1:20:27] deceived the following unrighteous works
[1:20:30] of iniquity will not inherit the kingdom
[1:20:32] of god
[1:20:33] fornicators sex before marriage
[1:20:36] idolaters adulterers
[1:20:39] sex with someone other than your first
[1:20:41] spouse effeminate child molesters
[1:20:45] abusers of themselves with mankind
[1:20:47] homosexuals
[1:20:49] thieves covetous drunkards revilers
[1:20:52] or complainers
[1:20:54] and extortioners or robbers
[1:20:57] verse 11 rejoices believers hearts
[1:20:59] though as it magnifies jesus's cleansing
[1:21:02] power from guilt of these sins
[1:21:05] and such were some of you but ye are
[1:21:07] washed but ye are sanctified but ye are
[1:21:10] justified in the name of the lord jesus
[1:21:12] and by the spirit of our god
[1:21:15] in galatians 5 paul says people who
[1:21:17] commit the following without repentance
[1:21:20] shall not inherit the kingdom of god
[1:21:22] adultery fornication
[1:21:24] uncleanness or lustful luxurious living
[1:21:28] leschiviousness or unbridled lust
[1:21:31] idolatry witchcraft which includes drug
[1:21:34] use
[1:21:36] hatred
[1:21:37] variance or contention
[1:21:39] emulations or rivalry jealousy
[1:21:44] wrath
[1:21:45] strife or electioneering for office
[1:21:48] seditions or divisions
[1:21:50] heresies man-made tenets
[1:21:53] envyings
[1:21:54] murders drunkenness
[1:21:56] revelings
[1:21:58] or late night parties and such like
[1:22:01] paul's ephesians letter warns the
[1:22:04] following acts give one no inheritance
[1:22:07] in the kingdom of christ and of god
[1:22:10] fornication
[1:22:11] uncleanness or lustful luxurious living
[1:22:14] covetousness or greedy desire to have
[1:22:17] more
[1:22:18] filthiness or immoralities
[1:22:21] foolish talking
[1:22:22] jesting or evil humor whoremongering or
[1:22:26] all unlawful sex
[1:22:28] unclean persons or evil thoughts and
[1:22:31] acts
[1:22:32] idolaters and speakers of vain words or
[1:22:35] those devoid of truth
[1:22:38] the reality is most church members are
[1:22:40] antichrist following antichrist
[1:22:42] preachers who legalize and commit the
[1:22:45] preceding list of sins
[1:22:47] many antichrist preachers flaunt their
[1:22:49] greed adulteries and sins publicly
[1:22:52] putting christ to an open shame flee
[1:22:54] from any preacher and church that
[1:22:56] condones any of the sins you just read
[1:22:59] just as jesus attacked every aspect of
[1:23:01] worship of the pharisees and scribes the
[1:23:04] holy spirit rebukes every worship aspect
[1:23:06] of modern workers of iniquity because
[1:23:08] they are demon influenced
[1:23:10] only evil works flow from their evil
[1:23:13] hearts
[1:23:13] corrupt trees only produce corrupt fruit
[1:23:17] antichrist preachers build their own
[1:23:19] self-serving kingdoms and ultimately
[1:23:22] destroy men's souls
[1:23:24] recall chapter 7's teaching about the
[1:23:26] four horse riders in the first four
[1:23:28] seals of revelation chapter 6 verses 1
[1:23:31] through 8.
[1:23:32] the horse riders are the self-same
[1:23:34] person the antichrist spirit
[1:23:37] his four-step process for kingdom
[1:23:38] building and dominion is conquering
[1:23:41] through deception killing money
[1:23:43] capturing and worldwide soul destruction
[1:23:46] demon-filled preachers build their
[1:23:48] kingdoms through the same steps
[1:23:50] first they deceive with false doctrine
[1:23:52] allowing listeners to indulge in their
[1:23:54] sinful lusts
[1:23:56] second they kill the reputations of true
[1:23:58] preachers and christians
[1:24:00] third they elicit millions of dollars in
[1:24:02] financial support from their blind
[1:24:04] followers
[1:24:05] megachurches and mega bank accounts soon
[1:24:07] come afterwards
[1:24:09] fourth they lead their worshipers into
[1:24:11] the unredeemable condition of having
[1:24:13] reprobate minds
[1:24:15] all blind preachers will lead their
[1:24:17] blind followers into union with the
[1:24:19] mother harlot the roman catholic church
[1:24:23] remember god has saved preachers and
[1:24:26] church members in every organization but
[1:24:28] they are few and far between
[1:24:30] of the saved most are foolish denying
[1:24:33] the full revelation of scripture as
[1:24:35] chapter 4 details 15 of paul's simple
[1:24:38] sound doctrines most churches deny in
[1:24:41] the section
[1:24:43] judging christian groups and
[1:24:44] denominations by their fruits
[1:24:46] look how religious catholics are and how
[1:24:48] beautiful their churches stand
[1:24:50] in architectural majesty yet many of
[1:24:53] their teachings are abominable
[1:24:55] the same can be applied to many
[1:24:56] lutherans methodists baptists
[1:24:58] pentecostals and independents
[1:25:01] only a small wise group will believe and
[1:25:03] live all jesus's new testament commands
[1:25:08] abounding iniquity in the end times
[1:25:11] in the years leading up to jesus's
[1:25:13] return in the rapture iniquity will
[1:25:15] abound to its greatest measure in the
[1:25:17] antichrist groups causing genuine love
[1:25:20] for god to be extremely rare
[1:25:23] jesus announces this in matthew 24
[1:25:25] verses 11-13
[1:25:27] and many false prophets shall rise and
[1:25:29] shall deceive many and because iniquity
[1:25:31] shall abound the love of many shall wax
[1:25:34] cold but he that shall endure unto the
[1:25:36] end the same shall be saved
[1:25:39] paul gives the same warning in second
[1:25:40] timothy 3 verse 13
[1:25:43] but evil men and seducers shall act
[1:25:45] worse and worse deceiving and being
[1:25:48] deceived
[1:25:49] america's churches work the worst
[1:25:51] iniquity as revelation chapter 13 verses
[1:25:54] 11 through 18 shows their future union
[1:25:57] with the government in issuing the
[1:25:59] official mark of the beast which will
[1:26:01] unleash massive death upon the whole
[1:26:03] world
[1:26:05] ezekiel 16
[1:26:07] 49 and revelation 3 verses 14 through 19
[1:26:11] show israel and modern christians
[1:26:13] falling into iniquity by the same means
[1:26:16] pride abundance of goods and idleness
[1:26:19] laodiceans are lukewarm and prideful
[1:26:22] saying they have no more need of god due
[1:26:24] to their riches and increased goods
[1:26:27] let us be hungry and thirsty for more
[1:26:29] divine righteousness while busily
[1:26:31] working for the kingdom of god
[1:26:34] chapter 12 section called the conditions
[1:26:36] or times and seasons of the rapture
[1:26:39] provides further description of the
[1:26:41] times we are living in so you can know
[1:26:43] how to escape antichrists
[1:26:47] the trail of the serpent and spiritual
[1:26:49] twins
[1:26:50] you can trace the trail of the serpent a
[1:26:53] phrase used by larkin
[1:26:55] from eden in genesis all the way to gog
[1:26:58] and magog in revelation
[1:27:00] satan's spirit the antichrist spirit
[1:27:02] closely observes then insincerely
[1:27:05] imitates the true believer's behavior in
[1:27:08] order to deceive the masses
[1:27:10] spiritual twins emerge off the pages of
[1:27:13] the bible one is god's child and the
[1:27:15] other is satan's
[1:27:18] the lord jesus christ provides two
[1:27:20] proofs of this battle of the twins
[1:27:22] beginning in matthew 13 verses 24
[1:27:25] through 30 and verses 36 through 43 with
[1:27:29] his wheat and tares parable tares
[1:27:32] poisonous to eat closely resemble wheat
[1:27:35] and are only distinguished by their
[1:27:37] failure to bow at harvest time
[1:27:39] this signifies their defiance against
[1:27:42] and failure to obey god's word tares
[1:27:44] live among the wheat like the wicked can
[1:27:46] worship right alongside the righteous
[1:27:50] jesus second mention of spiritual twins
[1:27:53] is matthew 24 24
[1:27:55] for there shall rise false christs and
[1:27:57] false prophets and shall show great
[1:28:00] signs and wonders in so much that if it
[1:28:03] were possible they shall deceive the
[1:28:05] very elect false christs are temporarily
[1:28:08] anointed by the genuine holy spirit but
[1:28:10] their heretical teachings and sin-loving
[1:28:13] lives reveal their true seed of
[1:28:15] discrepancy
[1:28:17] paul says the reason god allows evil men
[1:28:19] to spread heresies is to reveal the two
[1:28:22] distinct groups of the twins in first
[1:28:24] corinthians 11 verse 19.
[1:28:27] for there must be also heresies among
[1:28:29] you that they which are approved may be
[1:28:31] made manifest among you
[1:28:34] only the elect children of god will not
[1:28:36] be deceived by the antichrist because
[1:28:38] they are born again of the spirit of
[1:28:40] truth the holy ghost
[1:28:43] the evil twins always exhibit the six
[1:28:45] iniquity attributes vain religion
[1:28:48] rejecting and despising the truth
[1:28:50] denying the full power of the holy
[1:28:51] spirit
[1:28:52] lying persecuting and killing the
[1:28:54] righteous and worldly sorrow
[1:28:57] jesus uses the evil twins fifth
[1:28:59] attribute murderous to trace the
[1:29:02] serpent's trail from cain's murder of
[1:29:04] abel to the pharisees of his lifetime
[1:29:07] wherefore behold i send unto you
[1:29:09] prophets and wise men and scribes and
[1:29:12] some of them ye shall kill and crucify
[1:29:14] and some of them shall ye scourge in
[1:29:16] your synagogues and persecute them from
[1:29:18] city to city that upon you may come all
[1:29:20] the righteous blood shed upon the earth
[1:29:23] from the blood of righteous abel unto
[1:29:25] the blood of zacharias son of barackias
[1:29:28] whom he slew between the temple and the
[1:29:30] altar
[1:29:32] notice christ assuring us the serpent
[1:29:35] seed would keep murdering even after his
[1:29:37] ascension to heaven thus throughout
[1:29:39] mankind's six thousand year history the
[1:29:42] trail of the serpent is forever stained
[1:29:44] with the blood of jewish and christian
[1:29:46] martyrs
[1:29:48] watch the serpent silently slither
[1:29:50] through history beginning in heaven and
[1:29:52] then moving to earth
[1:29:54] the first set of twins were lucifer and
[1:29:56] michael both were exalted holy angels
[1:29:59] until iniquity caused lucifer to battle
[1:30:01] against his twin in a losing effort
[1:30:04] on earth the first set of twins was the
[1:30:06] tree of life jesus spirit and the tree
[1:30:09] of knowledge of good and evil satan the
[1:30:12] serpent adam were the next twins but
[1:30:14] eve's sin in longing for the serpent
[1:30:16] rather than her own husband began
[1:30:18] mankind's sin slavery
[1:30:21] next came cain and abel both offering
[1:30:23] worship to god but in jealousy cain
[1:30:25] killed his twin
[1:30:28] cain's tare children multiply with such
[1:30:30] abundance that god destroys nearly all
[1:30:33] living things with the flood
[1:30:35] shem and ham noah's sons are the next
[1:30:38] set of spiritual twins as ham was cursed
[1:30:40] by his father
[1:30:42] but shem's descendant was abraham the
[1:30:44] father of the faith
[1:30:46] abraham was separated out of the remnant
[1:30:48] of tares from the tower of babel
[1:30:50] movement and you see twins rise again in
[1:30:52] his grandchildren esau and jacob
[1:30:56] esau like cain profanes god by forsaking
[1:30:59] his firstborn rights to spiritual
[1:31:01] leadership while jacob eagerly snatches
[1:31:04] the birthright blessing and connection
[1:31:06] to the messiah god's true prophet moses
[1:31:10] next battled multiple tares including
[1:31:12] janus jambras balaam korah and dathan
[1:31:16] balaam despite accurately prophesying
[1:31:19] through his knowledge on how to contact
[1:31:21] god
[1:31:22] proved he was a terror when he lured
[1:31:24] thousands of israelis into sexual
[1:31:27] immorality at bail pior
[1:31:29] aiken joshua's twin showed his tare
[1:31:32] nature by lustfully harboring forbidden
[1:31:34] treasures while dwelling with israel's
[1:31:37] victorious army
[1:31:39] the serpent's trail leads to the days of
[1:31:41] israel's kings
[1:31:43] micaiah god's true prophet stood upon
[1:31:46] truth against 400 tare prophets anointed
[1:31:49] with a lying spirit
[1:31:50] the same lying spirit anointed the false
[1:31:53] prophet hananiah in the days of israel's
[1:31:55] final king zedekiah whom the wheat
[1:31:58] prophet jeremiah withstood
[1:32:01] the new testament opens with the serpent
[1:32:03] slithering into its pages as john the
[1:32:05] baptist identifies and rebukes the
[1:32:08] generation of vipers pharisees and
[1:32:10] sadducees who attended his services but
[1:32:13] refused his baptism unto repentance
[1:32:16] in like manner jesus chides the same
[1:32:18] religious impersonating tares calling
[1:32:21] them ye serpents e generation of vipers
[1:32:24] in matthew 23 33
[1:32:28] as a prefigure to the future final
[1:32:30] person of the pope antichrist judas
[1:32:33] iscariot is jesus's twin temporarily
[1:32:35] serving with christ in the power of the
[1:32:37] spirit for over three years until his
[1:32:40] satan-filled heart of iniquity betrays
[1:32:43] christ for thirty pieces of silver
[1:32:45] observe satan silently slithering into
[1:32:48] jesus's inner circle
[1:32:50] jesus was incarnate god and judas became
[1:32:53] incarnate satan
[1:32:55] both peter and paul contended with evil
[1:32:57] spiritual twins
[1:32:59] god's spirit helped peter discern
[1:33:01] ananias satan-filled heart that sprang
[1:33:03] up shortly after the outpouring of the
[1:33:05] holy ghost baptism in acts 5 3
[1:33:09] paul like christ and judas was betrayed
[1:33:12] and forsaken by demas who loved this
[1:33:14] present world as proof god's love was
[1:33:16] not in his heart the apostle john was
[1:33:19] falsely accused and rejected
[1:33:21] by prideful diotriphes who loveth to
[1:33:24] have the preeminence among them
[1:33:28] finally you reach the prophesied end of
[1:33:30] the serpent in the book of revelation
[1:33:32] chapter 7 in this book shows how the
[1:33:35] serpent morphed into an antichrist horse
[1:33:38] rider violently writing through the
[1:33:40] times of the gentiles or seven church
[1:33:42] ages
[1:33:43] revelation chapters 19 and 20 show
[1:33:46] satan's final two attempts at conquering
[1:33:48] jesus's kingdom in the battles of
[1:33:50] armageddon and gog and magog
[1:33:52] respectively
[1:33:55] revelation 19 finds satan possessing the
[1:33:57] pope's body and reigning as the world
[1:34:00] flattering and world ruling antichrist
[1:34:03] during the tribulation
[1:34:04] he gathers nations kings and captains
[1:34:07] for the battle of armageddon as a sort
[1:34:09] of rematch between satan's army and
[1:34:11] michaels but this time christ leads
[1:34:14] heaven's invasion of earth
[1:34:16] jesus army of white horse riders breaks
[1:34:18] through the skies and the sword word
[1:34:21] from jesus's mouth destroys the pope
[1:34:23] antichrist's armies
[1:34:25] birds eat until full with the flesh of
[1:34:28] these reprobates the beast spirit of
[1:34:31] rome and false prophet antichrist pope
[1:34:34] are both cast alive into the lake of
[1:34:36] fire
[1:34:38] revelation 20 shows satan's final
[1:34:41] climatic attempt at defeating heaven's
[1:34:43] king
[1:34:44] king jesus after one thousand years of
[1:34:47] confinement the old serpent is loose
[1:34:49] from the bottomless pit deceiving and
[1:34:51] gathering all nations whose number is as
[1:34:54] the sand of the sea
[1:34:56] christ's jerusalem dwelling bride finds
[1:34:58] herself completely surrounded and
[1:35:00] outnumbered but her help comes from
[1:35:02] above
[1:35:04] heavenly fire descends and burns the
[1:35:06] wicked
[1:35:07] psalms 57 3 rings true he shall send
[1:35:11] from heaven and save me from the
[1:35:12] reproach of him that would swallow me up
[1:35:15] see la
[1:35:16] god shall send forth his mercy and his
[1:35:18] truth
[1:35:20] satan is tossed into the lake of fire to
[1:35:22] be continually tormented day and night
[1:35:24] with satan tormented in the lake of fire
[1:35:26] the mystery of iniquity is defeated and
[1:35:28] brought to an end
[1:35:30] all accounts will be settled with the
[1:35:32] impossibility to lie or deny truth in
[1:35:35] iniquity at the white throne judgment
[1:35:39] the rewards for receiving the revelation
[1:35:41] of iniquity
[1:35:43] those who receive the revelation of the
[1:35:44] mystery of iniquity enjoy three closely
[1:35:47] related rewards
[1:35:48] the first is the blessing of your
[1:35:50] iniquities being forgiven through
[1:35:52] confessions of sins with faith in christ
[1:35:55] cleansing blood
[1:35:56] god graciously revealed to you the
[1:35:58] dangers of iniquity and you've repented
[1:36:00] romans 4 verse 7 excites believers
[1:36:03] saying blessed are they whose iniquities
[1:36:05] are forgiven and whose sins are covered
[1:36:08] david knew this blessedness
[1:36:10] expressing it in psalm 32 verse 5.
[1:36:13] i acknowledge my sin unto thee and my
[1:36:16] iniquity have i not hid i said i will
[1:36:18] confess my transgressions unto the lord
[1:36:21] and thou forgave us the iniquity of my
[1:36:23] sin silah
[1:36:26] christians know how to genuinely repent
[1:36:28] from sins admitting their sins while
[1:36:31] confessing them to the father who
[1:36:32] guarantees pardon if we confess our sins
[1:36:35] he is faithful and just to forgive us
[1:36:37] our sins and to cleanse us from all
[1:36:39] unrighteousness
[1:36:41] for certain jesus was sent to bless you
[1:36:43] in turning you away from your iniquities
[1:36:46] according to acts 3 verse 26
[1:36:49] unto you first god having raised up his
[1:36:51] son jesus sent him to bless you in
[1:36:54] turning away every one of you from his
[1:36:56] iniquities
[1:36:58] secondly you have the reward of a
[1:37:00] purified soul after obeying god's
[1:37:02] commands
[1:37:03] iniquity makes one forever disobey but
[1:37:06] you obey god and feel cleaned out in
[1:37:08] your soul as first peter 1 verse 22
[1:37:11] expresses
[1:37:12] seeing ye have purified your souls and
[1:37:14] obeying the truth through the spirit
[1:37:16] unto unfeigned love of the brethren see
[1:37:19] that you love one another with a pure
[1:37:20] heart fervently
[1:37:23] a final reward is having the testimony
[1:37:25] of forever departing from iniquity as an
[1:37:28] overcomer
[1:37:29] paul says departing from iniquity is
[1:37:31] god's foundational seal for his children
[1:37:33] in second timothy 2 verse 19.
[1:37:36] nevertheless the foundation of god
[1:37:38] standeth sure having this seal the lord
[1:37:41] knoweth them that are his and let
[1:37:43] everyone that nameth the name of christ
[1:37:45] depart from iniquity
[1:37:47] everyone has two choices either depart
[1:37:50] from iniquity or depart from jesus
[1:37:52] christians choose to depart from all
[1:37:54] iniquity not some
[1:37:56] jesus gave himself for us that he might
[1:37:59] redeem us from all iniquity and purify
[1:38:02] unto himself a peculiar people zealous
[1:38:05] of good works
[1:38:07] the key to the revelation of the mystery
[1:38:09] of iniquity is christians are constantly
[1:38:11] conformed to a holier life
[1:38:13] being guided into all truth by the
[1:38:15] inward dwelling of the holy ghost
[1:38:18] this is the law of the holy spirit
[1:38:20] making you progressively live more holy
[1:38:23] like christ did
[1:38:24] workers of iniquity are lawless becoming
[1:38:27] progressively more wicked as romans 6 19
[1:38:30] tells
[1:38:32] i speak after the manner of men because
[1:38:33] of the infirmity of your flesh for as ye
[1:38:36] have yielded your members servants to
[1:38:38] uncleanness and to iniquity unto
[1:38:40] iniquity even so now yield your members
[1:38:43] servants to righteousness unto holiness
[1:38:48] the consequences for rejecting the
[1:38:50] revelation of iniquity
[1:38:52] there are at least four consequences for
[1:38:54] rejecting the revelation of the mystery
[1:38:56] of iniquity a first consequence for
[1:38:58] condoning iniquity is suffering loss of
[1:39:01] spiritual positions and blessings during
[1:39:04] life on earth
[1:39:05] first samuel chapters 2 and 3 record god
[1:39:08] judging eli's house for his iniquity eli
[1:39:11] was a priest a descendant of ithamar one
[1:39:13] of aaron's two remaining sons along with
[1:39:16] eliezer
[1:39:17] rather than removing his disobedient and
[1:39:19] lustful sons from priestly work eli let
[1:39:22] them continue ministering honoring his
[1:39:24] sons above god the priestly duties
[1:39:27] eventually moved solely to eliezer's
[1:39:29] descendants rather than elise just look
[1:39:32] around you to see scores of men and
[1:39:34] women who've fallen from spiritual
[1:39:35] leadership positions due to unconfessed
[1:39:38] iniquities
[1:39:40] israel's unconfessed iniquity caused her
[1:39:43] slow violent and painful remove from the
[1:39:45] promised land
[1:39:47] lamentations details this as chapter 4
[1:39:50] verses 6 through 10 shows iniquity
[1:39:53] brought the removal of god's blessings
[1:39:56] iniquity brought death by sword
[1:39:58] starvation and more verse 6 reads for
[1:40:01] the punishment of the iniquity of the
[1:40:03] daughter of my people
[1:40:04] is greater than the punishment of the
[1:40:06] sin of sodom that was overthrown as in a
[1:40:08] moment and no hand stayed on her
[1:40:12] just as the saved thief on the cross in
[1:40:14] jesus day there are many today who
[1:40:16] commit iniquity but can repent and be
[1:40:18] saved moments before death
[1:40:20] they'll have no reward other than being
[1:40:22] granted eternal life at the white throne
[1:40:26] god's longsuffering kept these saved
[1:40:28] from never accepting a reprobate mind
[1:40:30] thereby keeping them from blaspheming
[1:40:32] the holy ghost
[1:40:34] like the saved thief they admit their
[1:40:35] sin and confess the purity of god's word
[1:40:38] in their dying moments and will join the
[1:40:40] surprised saved sheep on jesus's right
[1:40:43] hand spoken of in matthew 25 verses
[1:40:46] 31-46
[1:40:49] second rejecting this revelation leads a
[1:40:51] reprobate mind to speak blasphemy
[1:40:53] against the holy ghost
[1:40:55] in the greek blasphemy means to speak
[1:40:57] reproachfully rail at revile
[1:41:00] jesus says blasphemy or criticism of the
[1:41:02] holy spirit is an unforgivable sin
[1:41:05] wherefore i say unto you all manner of
[1:41:08] sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto
[1:41:10] men but the blasphemy against the holy
[1:41:12] ghost shall not be forgiven unto men and
[1:41:15] whosoever speaketh the word against the
[1:41:17] son of man
[1:41:18] it shall be forgiven him but whosoever
[1:41:20] speaketh against the holy ghost it shall
[1:41:23] not be forgiven him neither in this
[1:41:25] world neither in the world to come
[1:41:29] paul witnessed envy and hate-filled jews
[1:41:32] in antioch blaspheme his preaching in
[1:41:34] acts 13 verses 44 through 48. the
[1:41:38] apostle said the jews blasphemous words
[1:41:40] judged themselves unworthy of
[1:41:42] everlasting life
[1:41:44] causing him to focus on preaching
[1:41:46] solely to gentiles
[1:41:49] angry vile criticizers of full gospel
[1:41:52] holy ghost preaching likewise blasphemed
[1:41:55] god's spirit today sealing their eternal
[1:41:58] judgments while living on earth
[1:42:00] no doubt they'll continue to live in
[1:42:01] lustful luxurious pleasures but their
[1:42:04] souls remain dead while alive
[1:42:06] first timothy chapter 5 verse 6
[1:42:09] describes this consequence of being
[1:42:11] alive naturally but dead to the holy
[1:42:13] spirit
[1:42:14] but she that liveth in pleasure is dead
[1:42:17] while she liveth
[1:42:19] a third consequence is torment in the
[1:42:21] tribulation for workers of iniquity who
[1:42:24] live past the day and hour of the
[1:42:25] rapture
[1:42:26] once the tribulation period begins
[1:42:29] they'll suffer god's wrath for rejecting
[1:42:31] and crucifying the spiritual effects of
[1:42:33] jesus's blood
[1:42:35] disobeying the gospel yields the flaming
[1:42:37] fire of god's vengeance
[1:42:39] 2 thessalonians 1 verse 8 says in
[1:42:42] flaming fire taking vengeance on them
[1:42:44] that know not god
[1:42:46] and that obey not the gospel of our lord
[1:42:48] jesus christ
[1:42:50] finally a fourth consequence is the most
[1:42:53] dreadful of all the greatest damnation
[1:42:55] in the lake of fire
[1:42:57] before the indescribable damnation
[1:42:59] though
[1:42:59] is the shock workers of iniquity will
[1:43:02] experience at the day of judgment the
[1:43:04] white throne
[1:43:05] matthew chapter 7 verses
[1:43:07] 21-23
[1:43:09] and chapter 25 verses 41-46 detail this
[1:43:13] shock as the first text says many will
[1:43:16] plead with jesus for salvation by
[1:43:18] reminding him of the miracles they
[1:43:20] worked in his name during their lives
[1:43:22] but jesus will say i never knew you
[1:43:25] depart from me ye that work iniquity
[1:43:27] you learn jesus sees through their
[1:43:29] hypocrisy of knowing enough about god to
[1:43:32] perform miracles but failing to simply
[1:43:34] repent from sins and lovingly obey jesus
[1:43:38] the second text reveals how workers of
[1:43:40] iniquity focused on satisfying their own
[1:43:43] sinful lusts rather than serving the
[1:43:45] needy through six acts
[1:43:48] feeding the hungry giving drink to the
[1:43:50] thirsty housing strangers clothing the
[1:43:52] naked visiting the sick and visiting
[1:43:55] prisoners
[1:43:56] the simplest acts of service would have
[1:43:58] been enough to gain eternal bliss but
[1:44:00] the self-centered lawless despised the
[1:44:02] needy and exalted self
[1:44:05] the lord jesus warns the religious
[1:44:07] leaders who worked iniquity will receive
[1:44:09] the greatest damnation in matthew 23
[1:44:12] verse 14.
[1:44:13] woe unto you scribes and pharisees
[1:44:15] hypocrites free devour widows houses
[1:44:19] and for a pretense make long prayer
[1:44:21] therefore ye shall receive the greater
[1:44:23] damnation
[1:44:24] the lake of fire's worst punishments are
[1:44:26] reserved for religious deceivers who
[1:44:29] failed to enter into salvation
[1:44:31] kept others out and failed to warn
[1:44:33] others
[1:44:34] as ezekiel 33 verses 6 through 9 and
[1:44:38] james 3 verse 1 echo
[1:44:41] the congregations and other hearers who
[1:44:43] heard but rejected righteousness will
[1:44:46] also suffer worse than others
[1:44:48] in matthew 10 verses 13 through 15 jesus
[1:44:51] says those cities who rejected his
[1:44:53] disciples preaching will suffer worse
[1:44:56] than the violent homosexual gang bangers
[1:44:59] from sodom and gomorrah
[1:45:02] it's a saddening sobering thought to
[1:45:04] picture billions upon billions of souls
[1:45:06] tormented in the lake of fire and
[1:45:08] brimstone day and night forever and ever
[1:45:11] in the prince of the holy angels in the
[1:45:13] lamb all because of their unconfessed
[1:45:16] iniquity how easily torment could have
[1:45:19] been avoided by simple humble repentance
[1:45:23] take this opportunity to bow in prayer
[1:45:25] confessing any and all iniquities
[1:45:28] jesus only asks you to acknowledge your
[1:45:30] sin and depart from them
[1:45:32] be like jesus love righteousness and
[1:45:34] hate iniquity
[1:45:35] then his anointing and power will come
[1:45:38] upon you and you'll finally feel alive
[1:45:40] hebrews 1 verse 9 reads thou hast love
[1:45:43] righteousness and hate iniquity
[1:45:46] therefore god even thy god hath anointed
[1:45:49] thee with the oil of gladness above thy
[1:45:51] fellows
[1:45:53] conclusion
[1:45:55] the mystery of iniquity begins and ends
[1:45:57] with satan
[1:45:58] the father of iniquity but obedience
[1:46:00] begins and ends with jesus the son of
[1:46:02] righteousness and the mystery of
[1:46:04] godliness
[1:46:05] christ is author and finisher of our
[1:46:07] faith
[1:46:08] indeed satan is a worthy adversary
[1:46:11] tempter and accuser who comes to steal
[1:46:13] kill and destroy but jesus is the way
[1:46:17] truth and the life
[1:46:19] though all nations and churches work
[1:46:21] iniquity under the guise of religion
[1:46:23] your love for the holy spirit the spirit
[1:46:25] of truth
[1:46:26] helps you discern imposters and keeps
[1:46:28] your spirit sincere pure and unmasked
[1:46:31] without guile in service to jesus
[1:46:34] psalm 34 verse 2 records this blessed
[1:46:37] state saying
[1:46:38] blessed is the man unto whom the lord
[1:46:40] imputeth not iniquity and in whose
[1:46:43] spirit there is no guile
[1:46:46] lost souls rejoice in iniquity stubborn
[1:46:48] rebellion against god but you love obey
[1:46:51] and rejoice in truth because the love of
[1:46:54] god is shed in your heart by the holy
[1:46:56] ghost
[1:46:58] action steps
[1:47:00] step 1 purge your heart from all
[1:47:02] iniquity through confession and faith in
[1:47:05] jesus blood
[1:47:07] and ask him for strength to obey all his
[1:47:09] commands
[1:47:11] step 2 discern and forsake all
[1:47:13] association with workers of iniquity
[1:47:16] following faith charity and peace with
[1:47:19] them that call on god out of a pure
[1:47:21] heart
[1:47:23] step 3 continually examine your
[1:47:25] spiritual state to ensure sincere growth
[1:47:28] in grace and knowledge of the lord by
[1:47:30] letting the spirit guide you into all
[1:47:32] bible truth
