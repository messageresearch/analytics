[0:04] greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:06] of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of
[0:09] this video is to share the Bible
[0:11] revelations about the mysterious endtime
[0:13] event known as the rapture st. Paul
[0:16] specifically called the rapture a
[0:18] mystery in 1st Corinthians 15 verse 51
[0:21] and reveal a part of the mystery saying
[0:24] behold I show you a mystery we shall not
[0:26] all sleep but we shall all be changed
[0:31] thankfully the Bible promised that all
[0:33] the mysteries of God would be revealed
[0:36] in the end times which includes the
[0:38] rapture mystery as revelation 10 verse 7
[0:41] said that the mystery of God would be
[0:43] finished or revealed and then the
[0:45] revelation will be taken and prophesied
[0:47] before many peoples and nations and
[0:50] tongues and kings according to
[0:52] revelation 10 verse 11
[0:56] the word rapture and it's to Bible names
[1:00] the literal word rapture is not used in
[1:03] the King James Version of the Bible but
[1:05] many Christians still use the word we
[1:07] choose to use the word rapture because
[1:09] it's definition is fully supported in
[1:11] Scripture and it gives us a common term
[1:13] to use with believers and unbelievers in
[1:16] the Bible the rapture is called two
[1:18] things first the caught up experience to
[1:22] meet the Lord Jesus in the air second
[1:24] the first resurrection we will briefly
[1:27] teach about these two names first the
[1:30] rapture is called the caught up
[1:32] experience which comes from st. Paul who
[1:34] use the words caught up to meet the Lord
[1:37] in the air in 1st Thessalonians 4 verse
[1:39] 17 and that is what we mean when we say
[1:42] rapture for it is the catching up or
[1:44] caught up experience or ascension of the
[1:48] Dead and living Christians into heaven
[1:50] right before the Great Tribulation
[1:52] Period and the end of the world
[1:55] second the rapture is called the first
[1:57] resurrection in Revelation chapter 20
[2:00] verse 5 because there is also a second
[2:03] resurrection according to Christ Jesus
[2:05] and Scripture
[2:10] erection or rapture is Christ seizing
[2:13] away his bride her wife the Holy Ghost
[2:15] field Saints before worldwide
[2:17] destruction and then Christ allows them
[2:19] to live and reign with him for a
[2:21] thousand years in the Millennium the
[2:23] Bride of Christ includes the dead in
[2:26] Christ or those Holy Ghost field
[2:28] Christians who died and slept in Christ
[2:30] over the past 2,000 years and it
[2:33] includes the living
[2:34] Holy Ghost fill Christians who will
[2:36] never have to taste death the dead in
[2:39] Christ will be resurrected in
[2:40] incorruptible or perfect bodies and the
[2:43] living Saints will experience a body
[2:45] change into incorruptible bodies and
[2:48] live eternally without end with Christ
[2:50] the rest of the entire world population
[2:54] who denied Christ as unbelievers along
[2:57] with those foolish virgin Christians who
[3:00] did not receive the baptism of the Holy
[3:02] Ghost will have to die during the
[3:03] tribulation period or Battle of
[3:05] Armageddon and they will miss the
[3:07] thousand year millennial reign with
[3:09] Christ they will not live during the
[3:11] 1,000 year millennial reign because the
[3:14] lives they chose to live during their
[3:15] time on earth were not fit to rule and
[3:18] reign with Christ this is true because
[3:20] revelation 20 verse 5 said the rest of
[3:23] the Dead lived not again until the
[3:25] thousand years were finished the rest of
[3:28] the world population and foolish virgin
[3:30] Christian will remain in the graves
[3:32] according to Jesus in John 5 verse 28
[3:35] and will be resurrected for their day of
[3:37] judgement at the great white throne
[3:39] which is called the second resurrection
[3:41] and was spoken of by Christ in Matthew
[3:44] 25 verses 31 to 46 in Revelation chapter
[3:48] 20 verses 11 through 15
[3:53] understanding the rapture in order to
[3:57] understand the rapture and fully share
[3:58] the revelations about the rapture
[4:00] mystery we will answer the following
[4:02] questions briefly and then teach these
[4:04] scriptural truths more in depth than
[4:06] Vina Lee afterwards what is the rapture
[4:09] who is the rapture for when will the
[4:12] rapture occur where will the rapture
[4:14] take place at why will the rapture occur
[4:17] how will the rapture be done what is the
[4:22] rapture the rapture is the resurrection
[4:25] and ascension of the dead in Christ
[4:27] first the Christians who have died
[4:29] during the last 2000 years followed by
[4:32] the body change and ascension of the
[4:34] Living Holy Ghost vil Christians into
[4:37] the sky to meet Jesus at a secret return
[4:39] to cease away his people from the earth
[4:42] before the Great Tribulation Period who
[4:46] is the rapture for the rapture is for
[4:49] jesus' bride or wife which are the Holy
[4:52] Ghost field Christians who have loved
[4:54] and faithfully served Jesus Christ over
[4:56] the past 2,000 years including the dead
[4:59] and the living Jesus called this group
[5:02] the wise virgin in Matthew 25 verses 1
[5:05] to 13 all sinners and foolish virgin
[5:08] Christians Christians who are not born
[5:10] again of the Holy Ghost will be left
[5:12] behind and going to the Great
[5:13] Tribulation Period or Jacob's trouble
[5:16] when will the rapture occur the rapture
[5:20] will occur at an unknown day an hour but
[5:23] the Bible and Jesus described the
[5:24] conditions times and seasons that must
[5:27] be met before the rapture can occur the
[5:30] bible teaches the rapture will occur
[5:31] before the Great Tribulation Period true
[5:34] Christians will love his appearing
[5:35] according to 2nd Timothy 4 verse 8 true
[5:38] Christians will watch and pray as Jesus
[5:41] commanded and be ready for the rapture
[5:43] where will the rapture take place at the
[5:47] rapture will be a universal event
[5:48] meaning it will take place on a global
[5:50] scale and believers will not have to be
[5:53] in one physical location in order to be
[5:55] a part of the rapture Holy Ghost filled
[5:58] believers might be working at the time
[6:00] of the rapture or sleeping in their beds
[6:02] on the other side of the world but it
[6:04] doesn't matter
[6:05] if they have the oil of the baptism of
[6:07] the Holy Ghost or the wedding garment of
[6:09] the baptism of the Holy Ghost they will
[6:11] be ready for the rapture and Jesus will
[6:13] call them to the air to meet the rest of
[6:15] the Saints in the sky why will the
[6:19] rapture occur the rapture will occur
[6:22] because Jesus Christ desires to take his
[6:24] Gentile bride to their wedding in the
[6:27] sky and then to their wedding supper in
[6:29] heaven Christ wants to receive his
[6:31] people unto himself and rescue his wife
[6:33] from the great tribulation period that
[6:35] is coming upon the earth to judge and
[6:37] torment the unbelievers as pilgrims and
[6:40] strangers on this earth the Holy Ghost
[6:42] field bride wants to leave this world
[6:43] and ever be with the Lord according to
[6:46] 1st Thessalonians 4 verse 17 how will
[6:51] the rapture be done the rapture will be
[6:53] done by the power and authority of Jesus
[6:55] Christ himself
[6:56] through his own shout voice and Trump
[6:59] the same Holy Spirit that quickened
[7:01] Jesus's own body and his resurrection
[7:03] from the dead and raptured his body
[7:06] twice will come upon the dead in Christ
[7:08] and the living Saints and translate them
[7:11] in a moment in the twinkling eye to the
