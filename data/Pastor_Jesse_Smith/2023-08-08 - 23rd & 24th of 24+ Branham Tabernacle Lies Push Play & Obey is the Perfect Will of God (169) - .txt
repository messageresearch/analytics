TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] to either follow the word of God don't forget this Tabernacle will lose extreme to leave that you say to be true but they don't believe that their own actions I can't interpret his work [Applause] Machinery mechanical devices greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to finish the series on the 24 plus Lies coming out of Branham Tabernacle located in Jeffersonville Indiana USA please see the previous videos for a review of the first 22 lies but here's the 23rd lie the 23rd lie is that press or push play and Obey is the perfect will of God the evidence of this lie comes from a song Special recorded at a Branham Tabernacle service a couple years ago there's a couple who sings a song special and as you'll see in this song special they claim Joshua's mission was to play the tapes to Rahab and they say just press play Push Play and Obey for its God's provided way they say put brother Branham back in the pulpit and they can safely say it's the perfect will of God when they press play they say the bride's Perfection is through the tapes and the tapes are all they need they claim brother Branham showed us what to do at two o'clock on Sunday they press play sadly they claim in God's Big Sky someday God himself will still be pressing play they claim in every age the laity and clergy goes astray and they claim Ephesians 4 is not enough to bring this Bride In Shape among other lies on the song and friends at the end of the song special you can see Branham tabernacle's leadership their pastor and associate pastor standing up clapping and rejoicing in the lies that are in this song of course they're not worshiping the holy spirit because the Holy Spirit disagrees with this song because the Holy Bible disagrees with this song so now I'll just play a few of those portions from the song I'm not going to play the whole song but just the portions I mentioned let's listen to the song God's prophet into the promised land the very mission was to play the tapes for that was his commandment that's why we push forever before we can safely say it's the perfect will of God when we press police it is the bride's Perfection the tapes are all we need and brother Branham showed us what to do with the voice in this last day [Music] on Sunday the press play that and that voice is so important that in God's Big Sky someday God himself will still be pressing please so we must always have our filter on in this deceiving day for in every age the laity and the clergy goes astray so Ephesians 4 is not enough to bring this bride in shape so now that we've heard this ridiculous sinful song Let's go through some Bible proofs about why it's wrong first regarding Joshua and Joshua sending tape boys into Rahab there is a quote from Brother Branham on that but in one of the quotes brother Ram laughs after he makes the statement because it's not a Biblical mandate to send Tate boys Tate boys are not part of the fivefold ministry and I have a video on this topic if you'd like to watch that let me know I can put the link in the description or I can put the link in the comments so the first sin is that they're creating a Doctrine based upon a quote from Brother Branham with no scripture and that is adding to the word of God and that breaks the word of Galatians 1 verse 6 through 12 which says anyone who adds to Paul's gospel is cursed Paul never taught Tate boys replaced the living preaching Fievel Ministry also Romans 2 verse 16 says will be judged by Paul's gospel so these tape worshipers will be judged as guilty if they don't repent of changing Paul's gospel also they'll be guilty of revelation 22 18-19 because they're adding to the Bible by making tape boys part of the fightful ministry and they're taking away the other four-folds of the fivefold ministry and only focusing on the prophet Ministry of brother Branham and really since brother Ram's dead he's not part of the living five-fold Ministry so they're really taking all five gifts of the fivefold ministry away and the Bible says if they don't repent God will call them a liar it's from proverbs 30 verses 5 and 6 add thou not to God's words lest thou be found a liar and Friends remember tapes did not even exist in Joshua's day so it's ridiculous to say Joshua's mission was for the spies to play tapes and friends the tape worshipers always forget there was a priesthood in Joshua's day it was the aaronic priesthood high priest and other priests the levitical priesthood and they're exalting these imaginary Tate boys they're exalting the spies above the aaronic priesthood which is heresy but through this series that's what we've seen they're just accustomed to making heresy after heresy I noticed they said Ephesians 4 is not enough so see they've got to add to the scripture because the scripture is not enough so if they don't repent it's likely plagues will be added to them as the Bible says in revelation 22 18-19 the Bible said in Ephesians 4 8 through 16 that the gifts will bring the church to Unity and Perfection and lastly friends God doesn't have cassette tapes or reel-to-reel tapes in heaven the Bible says God has books in heaven and he will open the books and judge every man according to his Works based upon what's recorded in the books not tapes next I want to look at a few quotes from Brother Branham that might help listeners understand the heresy of the push play and Obey being the perfect will of God lie friends where did Brother random say push play and obey of course he never said that where did Brother Branham say the perfect will of God is to press play and not Ephesians 4. brother REM never said that where did Brother Branham say that tapes are all you need you don't need preachers you don't need Bibles brother Ram never said that where did Brother random show everyone to press play at two o'clock every Sunday that's right again brother Brown never said that so these people who claim to only say what the tapes say are most often not saying what the tapes say but here's what the tapes say in that heretical song They're basically citing a quote from brother Brandon from the church age book chapter seven brother random says quote for in each age the church goes astray and it is not just the laity but the clergy group shepherds are wrong as well as sheep then God brings himself on the scene as the chief Shepherd in the ministries of these seven men to lead his people back to the truth and the Abundant power of God end quote so as always Branham Tabernacle only focuses on one quote they don't focus on other quotes first they're misapplying this quote this quote does not say every single lady member and every single clergy member goes astray in fact the quotes of brother Branham say the opposite and here's about five or six quotes all saying the same thing that God always has a witness on the earth someone who has not compromised on the word of God so these quotes prove not every lady member not every clergy member goes astray the first one is from expectations 1950 brother Randolph said there's always been somebody somewhere that God could put his hand on and say Here's my servant he's always it's gotten down to sometimes just about one left but God has always had a witness and he said in the resurrection of Lazarus 1950 but God has always had a witness here on Earth for him so no matter what clergy or lady went astray in each age God always had a witness on the earth for the truth that's according to brother Branham so why isn't Branham Tabernacle saying what brother Branham said another quote was from God's preparation 1954 he says sometimes it's got down to one man but he's never been without a witness on Earth I love this quote from making the valley full of ditches 1956 brother Rams said but God has always had someone he could lay his finger on and say this is my servant in all ages so notice in all ages that means in laodicea God always has someone that he can put his finger on and say this is my servant God has never left himself without a witness that's according to the Bible and brother Branham acts 14 17 says nevertheless he left not himself without a witness so who's right Branham Tabernacle or the Bible and brother Branham of course the Bible and brother Branham are correct and Branham Tabernacle is lying they're wrong again he said in 1957 God manifesting his gifts now God in all ages at all times has never been without a witness God's always had a witness God's always had a witness to see friends in all ages at all times God's always had a faithful witness sometimes just one man but there's never been a time when all the laity or all the clergy went astray God has always had a faithful Witness and then he says it again greater than Solomon is here 1963 quote now God in all ages has never been without a witness God has some time got down to only one man I love what he says next quote somebody who could believe God just the way it's written and just what he is end quote now God in all ages has never been without a witness God has sometimes got down to only one man but he's always had a witness somebody who believe him somebody who could believe in the Supernatural somebody who could believe God just the way it's written and just what he is and he referred to them here as we find out in all ages he had his witness everywhere I love that God always has a witness who will believe God just the way it's written in the Bible and that's what Branham Tabernacle is distorting they're taking away they're adding to the Bible that's what they will not fully believe and fully preach they will not fully obey the Bible but God always has a witness in all ages at all times that will believe God just the way it's written in Ephesians chapter 4 that the five full ministry the living faithful ministry will bring the bride to Unity and perfection the Bible said for the perfecting of the Saints till we all come in the unity of the faith the reality is that Branham Tabernacle has rejected the true five-fold Ministry so they are talked about in Ephesians 4 14 they are children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the slight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie and wait to deceive the 24th and final lie is that we've got to put brother Branham back in the pulpit and his ministry is the livest ministry there is so I'm going to play some audio from a brand new Tabernacle preliminary service you'll hear random Tabernacles pastors say brother random doesn't have a Pulpit Brothers Ministry is the livest ministry there is and he accuses the preachers that they shut that Prophet out of the pulpit calls them Demus and they don't want him behind the pulpit of course these are lies these are false accusations the fact is the true five-fold Ministry led by the Holy Ghost knows that only living men are in the faithful Ministry and have a right to preach behind the pulpit dead men were never commissioned by God to preach behind any pulpit in fact I believe it's Ezra that is first mentioned as having a Pulpit he was a living man not a dead man he never said let's pretend like Moses is back in the Pulpit know what he did he used his own voice to preach Moses's message and that's what preachers are doing today obedient preachers to the fivefold ministry were preaching the message of brother Branham and it's the Bible restoration message and yes as preachers we have to rightly divide the quotes of brother Branham and only bring through the pulpit what brother random said that agrees with the Bible most of what brother random says agrees with the Bible but not all of it he was a man he told us this he told us to be careful how we're listening and there's so much of it that's the human side but he said prove All Things by the Bible he told us to test him by the word and he told us to only teach things that we can teach Genesis to Revelation Through the Bible so you'll never find Saint Paul or any new testament preacher saying put dead men back in the Pulpit let's listen to the LIE but so is it now today that in this message it's the same thing that's right it is the same thing in this message amen if you try to encourage a minister to play the tape in the church you are so misunderstood you're against the fivefold ministry you're against the ministry it's not against the ministry it's but brother Branham doesn't have a Pulpit he doesn't have a place he wanted to speak just people like this the word comes to speak to his bride of Jesus Christ but he's now welcome no more into doing it it's your boycotted and you say you hear that you know well we can play the tapes anytime we need a live Ministry now don't get me wrong I'm all about but guess what this is the lightest Ministry there is glory to the Lord [Applause] praise the Lord [Applause] beautiful [Applause] praise the lord it's just the way that it is amen and when you shut that Prophet out of that pulpit and you say that that's not a live Ministry I got something to tell you Dimas [Music] [Applause] [Music] I know I'm going to get it for that oh that's all right so when I hear that message today when I heard it it just breaks my heart and give it to Jesus and get into God's Prophet they do it now they don't want him behind the pulpit they don't want him to bring it it's like well I'll just give him a few minutes here and there it's back so friends the Bible proof that this is a lie is very similar to a previous video the Bible never teaches dead men take the pulpits of living men remember the word Pastor is used nine times in the King James version and never speaks of a dead man being a pastor or a prophet or anything in the Bible Ministry six times the word Bishop is used and it never talks about a dead Bishop still having the authority of a living Bishop every time one of God's servants died he raised up another one like in the case of when Moses died God raised up Joshua again according to Joshua 1 verses 1 and 2 Deuteronomy 31 14 numbers 27 15-21 and second Timothy 2 verse 2. friends where did Saint Paul ever say put only the seventh Church age messenger back in the Pulpit Paul never said that so Branham Tabernacle was adding to the Bible and taking away from the Bible which has severe repercussions if they don't repent and remember brother Brandon told us in the church age book the seventh Church age messenger could not add one word or one iota to the gospel of Saint Paul and that's how we would know that he was the seventh Church age messenger Paul's solution to preachers dying was teach other Faithful Men like II Timothy 2 verse 2 says and that fulfills God's promise that he will always have a witness a living witness on the Earth who looks at the written word believes it believes in the Supernatural believes in the Holy Ghost and will manifest to his generation let's look at a few brother random quotes first brother Ram never said when I'm gone the preachers will kick me out of their pulpits and you'll need to put me back in that is so ridiculous where do the tapes of brother Ramsay put me back in the Pulpit after I'm dead and friends I wish Brenham Tabernacle would answer this question where is Saint Paul's Pulpit since we'll be judged by Paul's Gospel according to Romans 2 verse 16 and the numerous quotes brother Adam said his converts were resting on the fact that we'll be judged by Paul's gospel so Branham Tabernacle needs to put Paul back in the pulpit and what about Jesus so this again shows Brown Tabernacle is exalting brother Branham to being equal to God because they're saying the tapes Can't Fail prophets never make mistakes every word is thus say the lord they're worshiping brother Branham in the tapes and making him equal with Jesus and friends I want to bring out a few more thoughts in that recording of Branham tabernacle's Pastor they were going to play the tape from 1965 what house will you Bill me brother random preached this right before brother Perry green preached and why didn't Branham Tabernacles Pastor mentioned that brother Branham said Tucson Tabernacle was now his home Church brother Ram said quote this is my church let's listen to the quote they need Sunday school teachers they're going to need a stand and I want to say this so that you thoroughly understand this is my church I've been here three years and I've had one door open to me that was brother Mackie asked me come preach God bless him and now that brother green God has sent him in here and opened us up at church of like Precious faith that we believe in we are to be very grateful to God you can't ever service take every place that we can and if we're asked to call on to pray to seek to do let's be soldiers not at the it's anxious to do it keep the message honorable then brother random said he didn't have to go back to Jeffersonville to record any more tapes he could also do a Tucson Tabernacle brother random made Tucson Tabernacle equal to Branham Tabernacle why isn't Branham Tabernacle saying that today why aren't they saying what the tapes say let's listen to brother Ram say we don't have to do that no more I usually I had to drive all the way to Jeffersonville Indiana to give a message that God gave me Amen to bring it to the people go all the way to Jeffersonville Indiana and each one of you stringing across the country and hooking up the wires and things to get the message because that's what we're living on that's what we're here for well we don't have to do that no more God gives me a message I can walk right here to pulpit and preaching I feel free when I Believe by that God Almighty will bless you if you will just stand by this church this group of people also here's another quote Brandon Tabernacle often misinterprets it's from the smyrnan church age chapter four in the church age book mother Ram said quote but of course all those who go out don't always learn how necessary it is to speak only what the messenger has spoken end quote and so Branham Tabernacle will say you can only say what the tapes say only speak what the messenger is spoken again they've misunderstood this quote this quote does not mean be a parrot and say everything brother Branham said and that's all you can say if that's the case does Branham Tabernacle want me to say what brother Brandon said in 1952 that the third person of the trinity dwelled in brother random's heart and now should dwell in our hearts is that what I'm supposed to say as a preacher of course not brother random grune is revelation just random Tabernacle want me to say that women have sperm as brother Brandon said in 1965 does Branham Tabernacle want me to say Rebecca married her bride as brothers said in numerous cases he just had a slip of the tongue Branham Tabernacle want me to say that the United States and the world will go through total Annihilation by 1977. is that what Brandon Tabernacle wants me to say and Friends remember I believe brother branham's a genuine Prophet I use his quotes scriptures principles doctrines revelations in every sermon that I preach I've done that for over 19 years but it is utter Insanity it's an evil spirit to say every word on tape is thus saith the Lord and that's what this Series has aimed to do show the ridiculous lies the sinful Lies coming out of bread and Tabernacle getting back to the what house will you build me sermon why didn't Branham Tabernacles Pastor read these quotes where brother Brandon said he didn't want to take up Perry Green's time Perry green was the pastor and brother Brown didn't want to take the pastor's time notice brother Brown never said brother Perry you should sit down and put me back in the Pulpit that's a lie from Brenham Tabernacle but let's listen to the quote brother Ram didn't want to take the pastor's time I don't want to take brother Green's time here because I heard brother green several times speak and uh certainly was influenced unless he brought the word of the Lord to us there's a few more quotes brother Branham said Perry green preaches the message that brother Branham believed he didn't play the tapes he preached it and brother Branham commended him for that brother Branham told the people it was their duty to back up the preacher back up brother Perry green why didn't random Tabernacles Pastor read those quotes see leadership at Brenham Tabernacle they just pick and choose the quotes that meet their propaganda that agree with their lies they avoid all these other quotes that are so easy to hear so easy to acknowledge and believe but they don't want to believe the truth so they ignore these quotes when will Branham Tabernacle say what these tapes say brother green preaches the same thing I believe in amen he's left his home he's left his people he's left his church he doesn't I'll say I believe it's a not only should be in our hearts it should be our duty to back him up everything that we can pretend the services that come here to worship and to make this a place where God can reveal to us the things that he has for us to reveal and as his word says and lastly brother Brandon prays a prayer for Perry green he's a preacher of the message he's not a tape player of the message brother Ram said may he carry this message Lord into the City and wherever you'll call him brother bran prayed that God would let him have the hearts of the people that he might teach them and lead them and direct them in the path that we all desire to walk Granite Lord blessed brother green dear God who are blessed in Jesus name may he care this message Lord into this city and wherever you have called maybe loyal fill with the spirit living a life above reproach God let him have the hearts of the people that he might teach them and lead them and direct them in the past that we all desire to walk granted Lord bless his faithful wife with little children bless our efforts here together as Christian Brothers here on Earth that we even care this gospel to the ends of the world send your spirit upon him God we pray in Jesus Christ's name as we get into you amen God bless you brother Perry brother so brother Graham never prays for brother Perry to put him back in the pulpit but instead he prays brother Perry will find his place in the fightful ministry and carry the gospel all around the world which he did Brother Peregrine fulfilled brother Ram's prayer God heard brother in his prayer and fulfilled it in brother Perry Green's life in closing friends we've come to the end of this video series I hope it's been a blessing remember there are six sins at least that Brenham Tabernacle is constantly guilty of and I share this in part one of the video series they're guilty of causing preachers to neglect their gifts they're guilty of neglecting Gathering physically more as we see that day approaching they're guilty of adding to the Bible they're guilty of taking away from the Bible they're guilty of idolatry by worshiping brother Branham and the tapes by making his every word thus saith the Lord six they're guilty of name-calling calling faithful preachers Demas unbeliever make-believer there's actually a seventh they're guilty of saying preachers are anointed by Satan when rightly dividing the word of Truth as Branham Tabernacles blog post expressed and remember friends from part one I've emailed Branham Tabernacle repeatedly with five simple questions they will not answer this shows they're breaking other scriptures like first Peter 3 15 they're supposed to have an answer for every one of the hope that they have within them and they won't even answer these five simple questions the Brenham Tabernacle people and leadership are guilty of not saying what the tapes say and adding to what the tapes say of course this proves their leader is not a prophet he does not meet all the qualifications of a prophet as I have expressed in other videos if you want links to those let me know and friends this series could go on but I'm going to try to stop now nearly every week on Brenham tabernacle's blog post there are lies so it's almost as if there's new lies every single week or the same lie told in a different way every single week so let's pray for them father God as we close this series have mercy Lord God please bring the elect to repentance that they can leave this denominational system that's been built up in Jeffersonville with these seven Commandments from the Bible they're breaking in these 24 plus lies God please have mercy and may the spirit of Truth guide the elect Believers out of this false movement I ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
