[0:07] having a church family every Christian
[0:10] needs a church family today we have the
[0:12] convenience of automobiles that allow us
[0:14] to travel almost any distance necessary
[0:17] in order to have a home church but in
[0:20] Bible days there was very limited
[0:21] freedom in travel their home church was
[0:24] often the closest Church believers had
[0:26] home churches in every city with elders
[0:28] as leaders and gatherings took place in
[0:31] the homes of the believers in Titus 1:5
[0:35] Paul commanded Titus to ordain elders in
[0:37] every city for this cause left ivy and
[0:40] Crete that thou should have set in order
[0:42] the things that are wanting and ordain
[0:44] elders in every city as I had appointed
[0:47] thee the book of Romans and Colossians
[0:50] records that Aquila and Priscilla had a
[0:52] church in their house and so did
[0:54] nymphets
[0:55] Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in
[0:58] Christ Jesus
[0:59] likewise greet the church that is in
[1:01] their house salute the Brethren which
[1:04] are in Laodicea and nymph as' and the
[1:07] church which is in his house the reasons
[1:11] for a church family are numerous first
[1:13] you need to feel God's love from others
[1:15] and express God's love to others
[1:17] according to John 13:35 by this shall
[1:21] all men know that ye are my disciples if
[1:23] you have love one to another second you
[1:27] need to be provoked or receive
[1:29] inspiration from others and then provide
[1:32] inspiration to others according to
[1:34] Hebrews 10 24 and 25 and first
[1:36] corinthians 14 verse 6 third you need
[1:41] exhorted or comforted by other believers
[1:43] according to Hebrews 10:25 fourth you
[1:48] need to be happy or joyful which jesus
[1:50] said comes through taking communion and
[1:52] washing the Saints feet in John 13 14 to
[1:56] 17 and haxe to 42 to 46 if you know
[2:01] these things happy are ye if you do them
[2:05] fifth you need to limit the number of
[2:07] voices you hear focusing on the faithful
[2:10] God sent voice of your pastor and the
[2:12] four other
[2:13] gifts God sends into your church John 10
[2:16] 4 and 5 and when he put it forth his own
[2:19] sheep he goes before them and the Sheep
[2:21] follow him for they know his voice and a
[2:24] stranger will they not follow but will
[2:26] flee from him for they know not the
[2:28] voice of strangers John 10:27 my sheep
[2:33] hear my voice and I know them and they
[2:35] follow me
[2:37] sixth you need to learn proper judgment
[2:40] in church family situations how to judge
[2:43] yourself and fellow church family
[2:45] members Peter says judgment begins at
[2:48] the house of God with those that obey
[2:50] God first Peter 4:17 for the time has
[2:53] come the judgment must begin at the
[2:55] house of God and if it begins first at
[2:57] us what shall be the end of them that
[2:59] obey not the gospel Paul states this
[3:03] even more clearly in 1st Corinthians 6
[3:05] verses 2 through 4 do you not know that
[3:08] the Saints should judge the world and if
[3:10] the world should be judged by you are ye
[3:12] unworthy to judge the smallest matters
[3:14] know ye not that we shall judge angels
[3:17] how much more things that pertain to
[3:20] this life if then you have judgments of
[3:22] things pertaining to this life set them
[3:25] to judge who are least esteemed in the
[3:27] church 7th you need to learn to forgive
[3:31] and love like Christ within your church
[3:33] family Ephesians 4:32 32 and grieve not
[3:38] the Holy Spirit of God whereby ye are
[3:41] sealed unto the day of redemption let
[3:43] all bitterness and wrath and anger and
[3:45] clamor and evil speaking be put away
[3:48] from you with all malice and be kind one
[3:51] to another tender-hearted forgiving one
[3:54] another even as God for Christ's sake
[3:56] hath forgiven you financially supporting
[4:00] your home church as a Christian you
[4:03] should financially support your home
[4:05] church with tithes and offerings I have
[4:08] a two-part series explaining New
[4:09] Testament Christians should pay tithes
[4:11] to their pastor so he can live with the
[4:13] gospel as he focuses on prayer and
[4:15] preaching Christians pay offerings to
[4:17] promote the welfare of the physical
[4:19] church building paul ordained that the
[4:23] corinthian christians should bring their
[4:24] financial support on the first day of
[4:26] the
[4:27] which was Sunday in first Corinthians 16
[4:29] verses 1 & 2
[4:33] the final gathering as you've learned
[4:36] the local home church gathering
[4:38] represents God's sheep willingly
[4:40] gathering as a flock to be fed taught
[4:42] corrected comforted and cared for but
[4:46] God has one final mandatory gathering
[4:48] that all men and women will attend like
[4:51] sheep and goats gathered unto a shepherd
[4:53] this is called the great white throne
[4:55] judgment according to Revelation chapter
[4:57] 20 verses 11 to 15 Christ will judge
[5:01] each person by their works recorded in
[5:04] the heavenly books names found in the
[5:06] book of life will be granted eternal
[5:08] life and those names missing will be
[5:11] cast in the lake of fire Matthew 25
[5:14] verses 31 to 46 is a second text about
[5:17] the great white throne as Christ likens
[5:20] this event as he himself the chief
[5:22] Shepherd separating sheep the saved from
[5:25] goats the lost if you've studied your
[5:28] Bible carefully though you will know
[5:30] that the true sheep who heard Christ's
[5:32] voice and followed him during their
[5:34] earthly lives were not being judged in
[5:37] this event but were seated in judgment
[5:40] upon Thrones next to Christ as his bride
[5:43] just as he promised the overcomers
[5:46] revelation 3:21
[5:48] to him that overcometh will I grant to
[5:50] sit with me in my throne even as I also
[5:53] overcame and then sat down with my
[5:56] father in his throne paul promised the
[5:59] same reward for faithful earthly service
[6:02] to the lord jesus christ saying do you
[6:05] not know that the saints should judge
[6:07] the world and if the world should be
[6:09] judged by you are ye unworthy to judge
[6:11] the smallest matters know ye not that we
[6:15] shall judge angels how much more things
[6:17] that pertain to this life yes the true
[6:21] Holy Ghost field sheep will be sitting
[6:23] down with Christ in his throne at the
[6:26] great white throne but the multitude
[6:28] group who is granted eternal life are
[6:31] only symbolized as sheep proven by the
[6:34] fact they are surprised to be given
[6:36] eternal life by Christ for they say Lord
[6:39] when saw we thee an hungred and fed thee
[6:42] or thirsty and gave thee drink when saw
[6:45] we thee a stranger
[6:46] took the in or naked and clothed thee or
[6:49] when saw we thee sick or in prison and
[6:51] came unto thee and the King shall answer
[6:54] and say to them verily I say unto you
[6:55] inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of
[6:58] the least of these my brethren ye have
[7:00] done it unto me
[7:03] true Holy Ghost field Christians already
[7:06] have the assurance of their salvation
[7:07] while on earth and won't be surprised on
[7:11] Judgment Day as Paul says 2nd Timothy 4
[7:14] 6 through 8 for I am now ready to be
[7:16] offered and the time of my departure is
[7:19] at hand I have fought a good fight I
[7:21] have finished my course I have kept the
[7:24] faith henceforth there is laid up for me
[7:27] a crown of righteousness which the Lord
[7:29] the righteous judge shall give me at
[7:31] that day and not to me only but unto all
[7:35] them also that love his appearing
[7:38] in conclusion I trust the Holy Ghost has
[7:42] illuminated your eyes to see the
[7:43] necessity of a home church one of my
[7:46] main purposes in having a youtube
[7:48] ministry is to point you and all of my
[7:50] viewers to Jesus Christ that you may
[7:52] find God's position for you in your
[7:55] local church I am NOT and have never
[7:58] considered myself to be the pastor of
[8:00] YouTube nor the pastor of other men's
[8:02] sheep but I am seeking to point sheep to
[8:05] God's truth that they may be led of the
[8:07] Holy Spirit to a local flock or a home
[8:09] church if you do not have a home church
[8:12] I trust that the Holy Ghost now will
[8:14] lead you to that place if you have any
[8:17] questions about having a home Church
[8:18] please contact us god bless you and may
[8:23] Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
