TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] the natural man ramisis was growing the natural man the Antichrist is growing now through politics he's already got to The Wine House greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to react to a few recent videos of President Donald Trump that caused me to wonder if he is a forerunner of the Antichrist which I believe will be a future pope of the Roman Catholic church so the origin of this video was that a couple days ago I saw two videos on the same day one involved the name of Jesus in prayer and the other one involved idolatry sexual morality and so forth both coming from the president of the United States so wanted to make a video about this because I've never seen such a blatant expression of idolatry before and I brought to mind all these scriptures and quotes that will go through through in this video by the grace of God I do want to say that I appreciate the positive things about Donald Trump I voted for him in 2020 and in this last election 2024 I do believe he is the lesser of two evils I'm thankful that he won the 2016 election even though I didn't vote for him I did not vote for Hillary Clinton I voted for a little known candidate in 2016 I also appreciate Donald Trump's support for Israel and all the positive things he did for our economy but after seeing these vide videos this week I was alarmed with the blatant idolatry so that led me to make this video by the grace of God now friends I do consistant watch United States politics because of what brother Ram said in the church age book that the United States government would change laws in order to persecute true Christians and it would be right around the time of the Rapture the Temptation will come as follows The ecumenical move that has started on what seems such a beautiful and blessed principle fulfilling Christ's prayer that we all might be one becomes so strong politically that she Bears pressure upon the government to cause all to join with her either directly or through adherence to principles enacted into law so that no people will be recognized as actual churches unless under direct or indirect domination of this Council furthermore the elect will not only be kept but as this move becomes the image Ed to the Beast the Saints will be gone in the Rapture and brother R also used revelation 13:16 to say that the true bride would be forced to stop preaching and I've always believed that when the true bride would be forced to stop preaching such as message preachers myself and many others here in the United States that that would be a great sign that the Rapture would be eminent or close at hand by the grace of God I believe someday the real bride of Christ will be forced to stop preaching the word of God the Bible proph prophesies of it in Revelations 13:16 if you want to put it down the nominations will force it to stop or take its Mark then when the lamb will take his bride and judge the for this and so this video is a bit of a followup to the November 20th 2024 video I made about Trump and Vance's presidential election win and as I said on that video it seems like with the win of the conservative movement with Trump Advance it seems now that the religious power of the Beast out of the earth is becoming more manifest remember the beasts out of the Earth has two horns brother Ram said they're civil and ecclesiastical but in Revelations 13 when this land came up he came up out of the earth no people the United States but then after he had two little horns civil and ecclesiastical powers and then he received power and spoke like the Dragon did before him well you just got to mark it down we are coming into a religious persecution with the same things that they did in Pagan Rome many years ago for it's thus sayeth the Lord so the United States has always been a great civil power but now it seems like Trump is able to Garner a lot of the ecclesiastical support of the people and since it seems the previous administration under Joe Biden was weaponized against Christianity it seems like now this is a rest time for Christians perhaps and so that would mean the enemy would be trying to unite Christians in the false Unity of the false ecclesiastical system which will eventually combine with the World Council of churches and then that would be the ecclesiastical Horn of the Beast because it has civil and ecclesiastical power now I want to begin with some scriptures here about forerunners because it seems like Trump is a forerunner of the Antichrist the pope Antichrist according to acts 536 and 37 we can see that the enemy seems to know when God is going to do something so he'll produce an imitation or a copycat of the true I'm just thinking of it now and another example is Janice and jambre as Paul says in 2 Timothy 3:8 now as Janice and jambers with stood Moses so see just about the time God raised up a deliverer Satan raised up impersonators let's read acts 5 36 and 37 I believe this is Gia and he said a man named thus or thetus raised up he boasted himself to be somebody had a small movement but it was brought to not and then Judas of Galilee Drew away much people after him and he also perished and the people were dispersed so this shows there was two impersonators at least when the Lord Jesus raised up as Messiah so Satan again tried to impersonate a raising up of a messiah Messiah so we can see in the days of Moses and we saw in the days of Jesus even the days of brother brandham there was two forerunners that tried to impersonate brother Brandon with the spirit of Elijah one was Charles Tas Russell and the other was Alexander Dai DOI passed away in 1907 claimed to have the spirit of Elijah and Charles Tes Russell passed away in 1916 claimed to have the role of Elijah and notice those years 1907 and 1916 brother randam became a pastor in either 1932 or 19 33 and so see the enemy must have known that so the enemy anointed these false prophets or false teachers to raise up as forerunners and it drew people away from the truth but thank God God had a true Prophet named William Mar and brandham and of course we follow his bible-based teachings today the seventh Church age messenger of Revelation 3 he had a son of man Ministry according to Luke 17:30 he had the spirit of Elijah to turn our hearts back to the apostolic fathers according to Malachi 45 and6 he was Elijah to restore all things that Paul taught us Peter James John according to Matthew 17:1 and he finished the mysteries of God as Revelation 10:7 says by the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ so it seems president Trump is a forerunner to the Antichrist now when Barack Obama raised up in the US some of my friends thought he was going to be the Antichrist and I didn't know much about it so I I didn't know for sure but his popularity dissolved very quickly but Donald Trump is different Donald Trump his popularity has only grown since he announced his candidacy to be a president in 2015 and as we'll show in this video it seems like the whole world is kind of catching on to this but before we look at that uh let's look at this quote from brother brandham it's a quote from the Third Exodus June 30th morning service 1963 and brother Ram's talking about how the Antichrist power was growing even then in the United States and he typed The Exodus of Israel out of Egypt with the Gentile Rapture both Powers had to be growing in order for there to be Exodus in the days of Moses and he typed that to today in order for us to have an exodus into the skies into a Rapture the powers have to be growing both sides the power of darkness and the power of God so in this quote it's very similar to quotes from uniting times and signs that brother B preached but I like this quote because he talks about the Protestants and Catholics uniting and the Antichrist he said is growing now through politics he's already got the White House so he had it back there in ' 63 of course under JFK the Catholic church and then Joe Biden was a Catholic President and now Donald Trump he says he's a presbyterian but it seems like he doesn't have a real faith in God brother says they're all uniting together it makes a power a beast just like the first one and then remember we have thus sayith the Lord Brother Bram said this nation United States will exercise the same persecution power that Rome exercised and it's with thus sayith the Lord so we know at some point the United States will turn against true Christianity and persecute true Christians but thank God the bride won't be here we we believe the foolish virgin will be here but we don't believe the bride will go through that the bride will not go through the wrath of God now getting back to this Third Exodus quote brother Ram said there's a persecution coming upon all those who won't Unite with it a boycott so this is what brother Bram would also call The Squeeze then he says they're both growing again it'll be a showdown one of these days the Antichrist power is growing in the United States government but the holy spirit's coming down the mysteries of God being revealed and set in order in the church the Bride of Jesus Christ let's listen to the quote but they're raised up a pharaoh who didn't know Joseph the same thing today a man's raised up and took oath in the in the White House that will not swear to his oath will not take his oath that he believes in freedom of religion what's this new pope saying one four things that he has one of them is to unite the Protestant and the Catholic together and to any intellectual person that's the thing to do but according to the Bible it's a wrong thing to do and the Bible said they would do that let's go a little forward at this time ramises in Egypt was growing his power is growing the natural man ramisis was growing the natural man the Antichrist is growing now through politics he's already got to the White House in religion he's got all the people so scrupled up that actually they'd fall right for it and the denominational leaders practically every church that there is in the nation is already in the confederation of churches amen ramises is growing and they're all uniting together amen and that's what they'll have and what does it do it makes a power of Beast just like the first one then there's a persecution coming upon all those who want Unite with it and the boycott it'll be too late then you've already tucked the mark I say I'll do it then you better do it now ramises was growing but remember while rameses was growing into power in Egypt God had Moses in the wilderness he was growing too ramises had a political system God had a spiritual system under a prophet ready to come down to speak to the people they're both growing again it'll be a showdown one of these days the time ain't far off when there will come a showdown as a natural as the scripture says a natural type the spiritual you can't get away from it there it is it's right before your eyes it's truth look at the church now calling out coming into Power the Holy Spirit coming down the mysteries of God being revealed and set in order see right here she's all already in the White House and the church is pulling itself together amen not a denomination out of the bondage of iniquities away from the amorites a people that's free oh now let's get to that first video I saw the other day it was Donald Trump's first cabinet meeting and he opened it up with prayer there's a Cabinet member I guess who used to be a pastor so he opened up with prayer and he closed the prayer in jesus' name and he even quoted Psalm 33 12 blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord so I was a little encouraged when I saw this video but then I saw the next video as we get to in a little bit and of course was discouraged by that but also knowing that everyone must fall under one anointing or the other the Antichrist anointing or the Holy Ghost anointing let's watch that video of the cabinet meeting prayer let's pray father we thank you uh for this awesome privilege father to be in your presence God thank thank you that you've allowed us to see this day the Bible says that your mercies are new every morning and father God we give you the glory and the honor thank you God for president Trump father for appointing us father God thank you for anointing us to do this job father we pray uh you'll give the president the vice president wisdom father God as they lead father I pray for all of my colleagues that are here around the table and in this room Lord God we pray that uh we would lead with a righteous clarity father God as we serve the people of this country in every prospective agency every job that we have father we would humble ourselves before you and we would lead in the manner that you've called us to lead and to serve father the Bible says that blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord but father we today honor you and in your rightful place father thank you for giving us this opportunity to restore faith in this country and be a blessing to the people of America and Lord God today in our meeting we pray that you will be glorified our conversation in Jesus name amen now let's look at the second video I'm actually not going to play the video I'm just going to show screenshots from the video so here's a screenshot the beginning of the video and it starts with this rap music saying that Donald Trump is to set you free bringing the light for all to see and of course this is Blasphemous the Bible said in John 8:36 that the son therefore shall make you free you shall be free indeed and Jesus is the light of the world according to John 8:12 I am the light of the world he that follow me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life to set you free bringing the light for all to see to set you free bringing the light for all to see so the music is already exalting Trump as this Messianic figure and this is a video looks like an AI generated video Donald Trump posted on all his social media accounts I use telegram so that's where I saw it now of course Donald Trump might be just trying to troll the left like he always does but a spiritual person if you had a spiritual mind would see all the blatant idolatry sexual Morality In this video and would abhor it so that's the first thing it's just Blasphemous lyrics to the rap song second thing is there's exotic dancers that are transgender they have women's bodies but men's beards so that's a state of confusion as the Bible said God's not the author of confusion as the Bible says in 1 Corinthians 14 and of course we're not to put any wicked thing before our eyes according to Psalm 101:3 then the video shows this golden image of Donald Trump which is blatant idolatry it reminds us of Daniel 3:1 when Nebuchadnezzar built this golden image that Shadrach meach and Abednego refused to bow down to this is the most blatant idolatry and Antichrist imagery I've ever seen of United States President so that was a huge red flag of course as you can see in the picture and then there's little statues of Donald Trump it looks like for sale apparently in what they propos to be a new Gaza a rebuilt Gaza so there's two images there a blatant idolatry making Donald Trump this golden image which we know God hates even in the Great Tribulation according to Revelation chapter 9 God will be destroying all the nations who still have idols and of course they can be natural Idols or spiritual idols and then there's a video of Donald Trump With a Stripper or exotic dancer and of course he's been married three times he's already an adulterer and looks like he's enjoying this conversation with a stripper or something very Wicked and then there's money being thrown around there's money everywhere so of course Jesus said you cannot serve God in manmon so this video exalts Donald Trump exalts sexual morality exalts riches and Jesus said you either love one or the other so it seems to be like Donald Trump loves riches and all those who follow Donald Trump love riches and friends as Christians we cannot be a part of that we cannot love money we have to love the Lord Jesus Christ no matter what he allows us to go through no matter how poor we become or Rich we become the love of money is the root of all evil so after seeing this video of course reminds me of 1 Corinthians 10:21 and that day that I saw this video I had already listened to 1 Corinthians 10 where it says you cannot drink the cup of devils and of the Lord so this applies to Donald Trump or me or you or anyone else it applies to all of us we cannot try to partake of the of God and also partake of idolatry sexual immorality Love of Money remember friends Proverbs 16:18 says Pride goes before a false this is a very prideful video it's exalting a man is like a savior it looks like Trump is the savior of the world he's bringing in sexual morality sexual pleasures riches prosperity and Friends another scripture is Matthew 7:18 Jesus said a tree is known by its fruit a good tree can only bring forth good fruit and a crup tree can only bring forth corrupt fruit so we see a lot of corrupt fruit coming out of Donald Trump's life so that proves he's not a True Believer and I never have believed he was a True Believer but I did always respect how he supported Israel thank God for that whoever blesses Israel will be blessed but that doesn't mean his soul is blessed it doesn't mean his soul is repented and that leads right into the next video I found this video from numerous years ago I think it's 2015 if I'm not mistaken almost 10 years ago where Donald Trump is asked if he's ever asked God for forgiveness and he says no he said he just tries to do better now he does say he takes communion at the Presbyterian church and so forth like that but again it ties in with 1 Corinthians 10:21 you cannot partake of both cups you can't enjoy strippers you can't enjoy idolatry can't enjoy cursing people saying evil words you can't enjoy that cup and then try to enjoy the cup of the Lord so communion with the Lord is in vain if you're partaking of other sins like sexual IM morality idolatry and Love of Money so let's watch that video where Donald Trump says he's never asked for forgiveness have you ever asked God for forgiveness that's a tough question I I don't think in terms of I have I'm I'm a religious person shockingly because people are so shocked when they find this out uh I'm Protestant I'm Presbyterian and I go to church and I love God and I love my church and Norman Vincent Peele the great Norman Vincent Peele was my pastor the power of positive thinking everybody's heard of Norman Vincent P he was so great he would give a sermon you never wanted to leave sometimes we have sermons and every once in a while we think about leaving a little early right even though we're Christian Dr Norman Vincent pfrank would give a survey would give a sermon I'm telling you I still remember his sermons it was unbelievable and what he would do is he'd bring real life situations modern-day situations into the sermon and you could listen to him all day long when you left the church you were disappointed that it was over he was the greatest guy and then you know he passed away but he was a great the he wrote The Power of Positive Thinking which is a great book but have you ever asked God for forgiveness I'm not sure I have I just go and try and do a better job from there I don't think so I think I if I if I do something wrong I think I just try and make it right I don't bring God into that picture I don't now when I take you know when we go and church and and when I drink my little wine which is about the only wine I drink and have my little cracker I guess that's a form of asking for forgiveness and I do that as often as possible because I feel cleansed okay but uh you know to me that's important I do that but in terms of officially I should I see I could say absolutely and everybody I don't think in terms of that I I think in terms of let's go on and let's make and here's the third video this wasn't what I saw the other day but I'd seen a few weeks ago another red flag uh Donald Trump appointed Paula White as the head of a White House Council or committee or group to promote religion and of course Paula White is a woman preacher that breaks the Bible First of all on top of that she's an adulterer she's been married I think three times if I'm not mistaken maybe more so this is another sign of crup fruit coming from Donald Trump promoting a woman preacher as the head of a religious Department of his this week I'm also creating the White House Faith office led by Pastor Paula White who is so amazing so Paula White is a woman preacher that breaks the word she's an adulter her that breaks the word she's a Prosperity preacher she constantly asks for money that breaks the word of God Bible said they can't be guilty of filthy lucer Greed for filthy lucer and a few more examples uh she said Jesus isn't the only begotten son I can now come into a Priestly anointing Jesus is not the only begotten Son of God he is not I'm a Son of God you're this he's the first fruit he's the first born of many Jesus is not the only begotten son and then she let her third husband I believe or fourth husband say it's okay for couples to watch porn that is one of the filthiest false teachings that could ever come across the pulpit I've seen porn destroy marriages porn is an invitation to be possessed with demons and yet it's laughed about in Paula White's services so we're going to play those video clips so you can see it show the sad state that Donald Trump must be in in order to put this woman in a place of leadership of any Department in his administration so friends my conclusion is that Donald Trump must have a partial fear of the Lord but not a true fear of the Lord I preached a sermon on this um last year in 2024 was October 13th in the pm I'll leave a link to it in the description if you're interested in this topic this was a great subject I never thought about before from the Lord not from me but from the Lord I'd never really thought about that I'd preached on numerous sermons about the fear of the Lord Jesus had the anointing of the fear of the Lord according to the book of Isaiah but then I saw a partial fear of the Lord in 2 Kings 17: 24- 41 this is an amazing story here in the history of Israel it was around the time of the Exile when Israel was exiled because of their idolatry God kicked them out of the land the king of Assyria had taken out a lot of the Jews but then he brought in Babylonians just to maintain the land and they kept doing their idolatrous ways so God sent in Lions to kill them so the Babylonians had to figure out how do we stop these lions from killing us in this land and so they learned some of the ways of God in order to keep the lions from slaying them so the Bible said they developed a partial fear of the Lord so verse 32 says they feared the Lord and made them unto themselves of the lowest of of the priests of the high places verse 33 they fear the lord and serve their own God so they found kind of an in between lifestyle like a lukewarm lifestyle there it is of honoring some of God's Commandments and then disobeying some of them also now reminds me of Herod how Herod observed many of the things John the Baptist said but then of course he lived in adultery and so forth so wow that's a thought that's breaking forth right now you know comparing Herod with Donald Trump so they feared some of the Lord's commands but they also kept doing some of their own idolatry they did not have a reverential trust in the Lord and they did not have a hatred for evil so they did not have a true fear of the Lord because the true fear of the Lord hates evil as Psalm 19:9 says the fear of the Lord is clean it doesn't produce a dirty life life of sin it produces a life of Holiness and righteousness by the grace of God so again friends it seems to be that Trump is a forerunner to the Future Pope Antichrist just in my humble opinion I could be wrong but I just say that because I've never seen so much proof of it I've never seen a political figure so admired so idolized and of course Trump is supporting this he's the one sharing these AI generated videos he probably didn't make the video somebody probably made it for him but he's still sharing it and not able to recognize the blatant idolatry so friends let's do what Jesus said Watch and Pray Mark 13:31 through 37 Heaven Earth shall pass away but my word shall not pass away but of that day and that hour knoweth no man no not the Angels which are in heaven neither the son but the father take take ye heed watch and pray for ye know not when the time is for the son of man is as a man taking a far Journey who left his house and gave authority to his servants and to every man his work and commanded the porter to watch watch ye therefore for you know not when the Master of the House cometh at even or at midnight or at the crowing or in the morning lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping and what I say unto you all I say unto all watch so friends let's watch and pray for the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ he is the way the truth and the life and no man comes into the father except through Jesus Christ of course let's pray for Donald Trump to repent and all the people that might be deceived by this that some of them will be saved Jesus said few there be that find it and of course we're supposed to make prayers intercession for all Kings and leaders according to what Paul said in 1 Timothy chapter 2 verse one said I exhort therefore that first of all supplications prayers intercessions and giving of thanks be made for all men 1 Timothy 2:2 for kings and for all that are in Authority that we may lead a quiet and peaceful life in all godliness and honesty for this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our savior who will have all men to be saved and come unto the knowledge of the truth so let's keep praying for our leaders let's keep praying for people to come to the knowledge of the truth that they can be repent of their sins trust in the blood of Jesus Christ for forgiveness of sins and be saved and hopefully obey as far as acts 238 to repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ Christ for the remission of sins and then receive the gift of the Holy Ghost the baptism of the Holy Ghost the three works of Grace justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
