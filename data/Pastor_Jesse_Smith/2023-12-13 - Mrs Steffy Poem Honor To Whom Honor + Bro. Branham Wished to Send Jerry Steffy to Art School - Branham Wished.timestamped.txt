[0:00] and bless this little church and help me
[0:03] Lord as I go to bring the message to
[0:04] other people and may we together like
[0:07] one person one family stick together and
[0:11] pray together and live together in holy
[0:14] Unity of the Holy Spirit until Jesus
[0:18] receives us into the kingdom or we ask
[0:21] it in his name and for his glory
[0:25] amen time to interrupt you you sure can
[0:28] brother
[0:30] as a token of our
[0:33] appreciation and by the the work of a
[0:36] young man in our
[0:38] midst we present this picture to you
[0:41] brother Brandon with the full expression
[0:44] of our love and appreciation thank you
[0:46] brother nille Jerry stey that painted
[0:49] that
[0:50] picture brother Jerry
[0:54] stey painted that
[0:56] picture God bless that
[0:58] boy Hallelujah that's very fine Jerry if
[1:01] you're here this morning hallelujah it's
[1:04] too bad I wish I had the means to let
[1:07] that boy go to school for an artist I
[1:10] believe God is an art don't you God is
[1:12] in music God is in art God is in this
[1:15] and it's too bad to see a talent like
[1:17] that wouldn't be uh uh developed more he
[1:21] does the more developing it'll be and I
[1:24] I pray that God will bless you Jerry and
[1:27] thank you brother Neville into this
[1:29] church for this fine uh picture and for
[1:34] the verse that goes under it I'll read
[1:38] it
[1:39] Lou you want me to read it all right sir
[1:42] brother devil will read the
[1:44] verse
[1:46] amen I had an idea what he's not a man
[1:49] of stature tall nor lofty in his way he
[1:53] sounds himself no trumpet as he goes
[1:56] from day to day has no desire for wealth
[2:00] nor Fame but none his place could fail
[2:04] he's just the way we want him our own
[2:07] dear brother
[2:08] B he teaches us with faithfulness the
[2:12] undiluted word no fancy ways no love for
[2:16] praise just following the Lord amen his
[2:19] speech is soft and gentle he raises not
[2:22] his voice except to cry against the
[2:25] wrong and then he has no
[2:28] choice never got a lot of learning from
[2:32] Colleges and Schools but he knows what
[2:36] is important and he sure nobody's food
[2:40] for the knowledge he has given is
[2:42] eternal from above he has no Creed
[2:46] except our Christ no law but Sovereign
[2:50] Love there was no great announcement to
[2:52] his lowly humble birth but to us he's
[2:56] the greatest man who lives upon the
[2:58] Earth we count it more than privileged
[3:01] to know him as a friend we cherish all
[3:04] he stands for and will right to the end
[3:08] amen he says he's not a preacher he's
[3:10] modest as can be but get him in the
[3:13] pulpit and it isn't hard to see he was
[3:16] foreordained a Propet let men call it
[3:19] what they will God granted us great
[3:22] favor when he gave us brother
[3:26] Bill sign a little flock amen
[3:35] thank thank you for your
[3:40] thoughts who compose that I think his
[3:43] mother
[3:46] did that's I'm not worthy of those
[3:49] things of saying that but that's more to
[3:52] me than all the money in the world see s
[3:55] somebody regard you as his servant God
[3:59] may I ever live true to that is my
[4:02] prayer God ever bless you my thoughts
[4:05] will always be far you and I expressly
[4:09] love you
[4:10] too
