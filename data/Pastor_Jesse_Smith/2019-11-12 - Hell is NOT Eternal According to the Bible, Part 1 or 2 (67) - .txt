Description:
The Bible teaches hell is NOT eternal for three reasons. First, God is too merciful to punish sinners for an eternity. Second, sinners do not possess eternal life, so they cannot live and burn eternally. Third, hell is cast into the lake of fire to be destroyed after the White Throne Judgment.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] greetings friends in the Mattress name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to prove by the Bible that hell is not eternal and unbelievers will not burn eternally without end in hell or in the lake of fire because those are two different things to summarize unbelievers cannot burn or suffer torment for eternity because they do not possess eternal life which is God's Spirit eternal life is a person or God and God is a spirit according to Jesus in John 4:24 God's Spirit is the only eternal unending life unbelievers may suffer torment in Hell which is a prison house for many thousands of years but it will not last eternally after the white throne judgment unbelievers may be tormented in the lake of fire and burned for many years but at some point they will be annihilated and done away with because they rejected the person of eternal life Jesus Christ God is too merciful and loving to require unbelievers to suffer an eternal number of years without end for only disbelieving one lifetime on earth here's logical proof of these claims if a sinner is going to the lake of fire and suffer for the same amount of time as you are going to heaven and enjoy its blessings then the sinner has the same kind of life you have already as a believer but that's not true sinners do not possess eternal life which is God's Spirit now may the Bible fully convinced you and I on this subject let's begin with hell is not the same as the lake of fire hell and the lake of fire are not the same hell is the current holding place for unbelievers where they go after death while they are waiting their final judgement at the white throne judgment hell's located in the heart of the earth also called prison by Peter in 1st Peter 3:18 through 20 Peter says Jesus after he was crucified went down into hell in his spirit body or form also called a theophany and preached to the spirits in prison who disobeyed Noah's warning for Christ also hath once suffered for sins the just for the unjust that he might bring us to God being put to death in the flesh but quickened by the spirit by which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison which sometimes were disobedient when once the long-suffering of God waited the days of Noah while the ark was a preparing wherein few that is eight souls were saved by water the Bible tells us what Jesus's spirit was doing on the Saturday following Good Friday his Spirit descended to the heart of the earth or hell Matthew 12:40 supports this saying for as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whales belly so shall the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth Paul recorded Jesus's dissention as well saying now that he ascended what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth Ephesians 4:9 while in Hell Jesus took the keys of hell and death from Satan according to revelation 1:18 and then led many of the Old Testament Saints who were in Abraham's bosom in the heart of the earth back up to Jerusalem and they were seen by many following Jesus's resurrection on Easter morning revelation 1:18 I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I am Alive for evermore amen and have the keys of hell and of death matthew 27:51 253 and behold the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom and the earth did quake and the rocks rent and the graves were opened and many bodies of the saints which slept arose and came out of the graves after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared unto many Jesus's parable of the rich man and Lazarus the beggar provides more detail about Hell and also Abraham's bosom the rich man died and in hell he lifted up his eyes being in torments all unbelievers in Hell are currently suffering a level of torment just as prisoners today suffer torment when locked up in prison notice that Jesus led captivity captive or led many of the faithful Old Testament Saints out of Abraham's bosom and resurrected them fulfilling Psalms 68 18 as Paul taught in Ephesians 4:8 Ephesians 4:8 wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men revelation 20 verses 13 and 14 begin to show how hell is not eternal for it is cast into the lake of fire along with death and the sea gave up the Dead which were in it and death and he'll delivered up the Dead which were in them and they were judged every man according to their works and death and he'll were cast into the lake of fire this is the second death the lake of fire is the second death the place where unbelievers are sentenced to after the final judgment at the white throne judgment according to Revelation 20 verse 14 and revelation 2:11 he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches he that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death next hell had a beginning God and his children did not how was prepared and had a beginning and now we know that it has an ending in the lake of fire all things with the beginning have an ending Matthew 25:41 says how was prepared or had a begin then shall he say also unto them on the left hand depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels now if it was prepared then it wasn't without a beginning if it had a beginning then it can't be eternal before moving on note that Melchizedek who was God acting as Abraham's priest in a flesh body in Genesis 14 was without beginning of days so God is without a beginning Hebrews 7 3 without father without mother without descent having neither beginning of days nor end of life but made like unto the Son of God abideth a priest continually notice also in first Timothy 6:15 paul says god only has immortality or eternal life which in his times he shall show who is the blessed and only potentate the king of kings and Lord of lords who only hath immortality dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto whom no man hath seen nor can see to whom be honor and power everlasting amen quoting william branham there is only one kind of eternal life God has it if we have God we have eternal life in and through him so you see the word eternal or everlasting can be applied in various ways but when it applies to God he being what he is it has one meaning it is the duration of God you can't apply it like that to any other thing God alone is eternal and because he lives we live with him now you might say brother Jesse you had a beginning so you're not eternal while it's true my humanity had a beginning my soul did not because the Bible says I was in Christ or in the mind of God before the foundation of the world this means God's thought about me and every believer is eternal Ephesians 1:3 2:5 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places Christ according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will every Christian is eternal because they are eternal thoughts of God then when we are born on this earth and later become believers we receive eternal life in our souls when we're born again by the baptism of the Holy Ghost all born-again Christians already possess eternal life this is true because first John 5 11 through 13 says and this is the record that God hath given to us eternal life and this life is in his son he that hath the son hath life and he that hath not the son of God hath not life these things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the son of God that you may know that ye have eternal life and that you may believe on the name of the Son of God yes Holy Ghost field Christians were in the mind of God before the world was founded they are part of the eternal God who had no beginning revelation 13:8 and 17:8 say overcomers of the Beast had their names written in the book of life of the Lamb before the foundation of the world again proving true Christians have an eternal quality about them thanks to God's amazing grace revelation 13:8 and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world revelation 17:8 the Beast that thou sawest was and is not and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit and go into perdition and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world when they behold the Beast that was and is not and yet is the next truth is that unbelievers will be destroyed with an ending point neither hell nor the lake of fire are eternal or unending because scripture says Satan how and unbelievers will be destroyed or brought to an ending point 2nd Peter 2:12 says sinners are made to be taken and destroyed not tormented eternally but come to destruction but these as natural brute beasts made to be taken and destroyed speak evil of the things that they understand not and shall utterly perish in their own corruption Jesus teaches the same destruction for sinners in Matthew 10:28 saying and fear not them which kill the body but are not able to kill the soul but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell Satan will have an ending point when he is no more or doesn't exist according to Ezekiel 28 1900 the among the people shall be astonished at thee thou shalt be a terror and never shalt thou be anymore Malachi 4:1 - 3 describes the judgment of sinners following the Battle of Armageddon and burning of the Earth's surface leaving them neither root nor branch as ashes under the soles of believers feet at the beginning of the millennium Malachi 4 1 2 3 4 behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven and all the proud yea and all that do wickedly shall be stubble and the day that cometh shall burn them up saith the Lord of Hosts that it shall leave them neither root nor branch but unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings and he shall go forth and grow up as calves of the stall and ye shall tread down the wicked for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do this saith the Lord of hosts lastly let's look at four commonly misunderstood scriptures the first misunderstood scripture is marked 329 which says but he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never forgiveness but is in danger of eternal damnation this verse does not teach unbelievers are tormented eternally without end in hell or the lake of fire notice the wording eternal damnation in the Greek damnation means separation judgment or decision the separation of unbelievers will be eternal but not their torment God's judgment or decision upon unbelievers will be eternal but not their torment in other words God's decree against unbelievers will be eternally true and righteous even after their souls are annihilated destroyed and done away with souls of unbelievers will not live eternally because they do not possess Christ eternal life next mark 9 verses 43 and 44 are commonly misunderstood which say and if thy right hand offend thee cut it off it is better for thee to enter into life maimed than having two hands to go into hell into the fire that never shall be quenched where their worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched people often misunderstand two things here fire that never shall be quenched and the worm that dieth not first concerning the fire the fire may be eternal because it may be a manifestation of God's power and presence for Hebrews 12 29 says for our God is a consuming fire this fire may never be quenched as an eternal memorial of God's holiness impurity but that doesn't mean the souls of unbelievers will not be annihilated as 2nd Peter 2:12 has already proven unbelievers are going to be taken and destroyed or annihilated they will be done away with second concerning the worm that dies not there are two options about this statement it may be teaching that the worms will only be living for hundreds or thousands of years because eternal life only comes from faith in Christ or it may mean the worms do indeed have a form of eternal life just like other animals will have such as the army of white heavenly horses mentioned in Revelation 19 verses 11 and 14 it seems all nature including plants animals and insects will return to the Garden of Eden conditions and exists in perfection for eternity for God's glory the tree of life will produce fruit every month so plants will have a form of eternal life according to revelation 22 verse 2 Hebrews 6 2 is a third commonly misunderstood scripture it says of the doctrine of baptisms and of laying on of hands and of resurrection of the Dead and of eternal judgment many stumble over the phrase eternal judgment but this scripture has the same meaning as mark 3 29 which says eternal damnation in Hebrews 6 to eternal judgment means God's judgment decree sentence or decision is going to stand for eternity meaning he will never change it it does not say eternal torment or torture God's pure righteous judgment about each person's destiny will be upheld for eternity unbelievers will cease to exist at some point after their torment and will never live again proving God's judgment is eternal Jude 1 verse 7 is the for scripture commonly misunderstood which says even as Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities about them in like manner giving themselves over to fornication and going after strange flesh are set forth for an example suffering the Vengeance of eternal fire in Genesis 19 sodom and gomorrah suffered the Vengeance of eternal fire historically speaking sodom and gomorrah stop burning shortly after its destruction as it is not burning today so eternal fire refers to the fiery manifestation of God's presence just like Mark 943 speaks of when it says the fire that shall never be quenched our God is a consuming fire and he manifests as a holy fire to display his holiness and power Hebrews 12:28 and 29 wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have grace whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear for our God is a consuming fire in closing I hope you can now see that hell is not eternal because it's cast into the lake of fire after the white throne judgment also hopefully you see torment of sinners or unbelievers in the lake of fire is not eternal because they do not possess the Spirit of Jesus Christ which is eternal life the supernatural eternal fire is eternal because it is a manifestation of God's presence but the punishment and torment for unbelievers will not last eternally if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me god bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
