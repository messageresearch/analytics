TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] and the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him the spirit of wisdom of understanding the spirit of counsel might the spirit of knowledge and the fear of the Lord and shall make him of quick understanding and the fear of the Lord greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to do a bible study on the necessity and power of the fear of the Lord as taught plainly throughout the Old and New Testaments hi friends I'm Jesse Smith pastor bride of Christ Fellowship here in akan Ohio USA and I defend the original Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ that he revealed to St Paul then had to restore through Martin Luther John Wesley and the late Prophet brother William brandham who live from 1909 to 1965 and also defend brother Ram's Godly Christian character so here's the outline for the video we'll look at first Old Testament verses then we'll look at New Testament verses followed by Brother Ram's quotes and then the conclusion this may be a two-part Series so we'll see how it goes by the grace of God so let's begin with Old Testament verses before getting into those verses let's look at the Hebrew definition of the word fear it means moral reverence and reverence means honor or in Integrity or honesty according to Webster's Dictionary or profound adoration so the way I'm going to define fear is profound honor and it's profound honor that honors Holiness let's begin with Proverbs 1: 29 the Bible says for that they hated knowledge and did not choose the fear of the Lord so the first point I want to make about the fear of the Lord is that it's a choice it's everyone's choice to love good it's every One's Choice to fear the lord or have profound honor for God's holiness next the fear of the Lord is profound honor for God and hatred for sin this is Proverbs 8:13 the Bible says the fear of the Lord is to hate evil pride and arrogancy and the evil way and the froward mouth do I hate it is our choice to have the fear of the Lord or profound honor and love for God's holiness which will cause us to hate sin third verse is Proverbs 9:10 we learn that the fear of the Lord is the prerequisite for the beginning of wisdom so God wants us to develop a deep wisdom over the entire course of our Christian lives but the fear of the Lord will bring you to the beginning of that wisdom but then of course you're supposed to grow in that wisdom over time Proverbs 9:10 says the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom and the knowledge of the Holy is understanding next the Bible says the fear of the Lord is your strong confidence in God or your place of Refuge or safety Proverbs 1426 tells us this the Bible says in the fear of the Lord is strong confidence and his children have a place of Refuge although we live in a world of doubt and uncertainty and we feel danger sometimes can feel all around us the fear of the Lord is our place of confidence it's our place of Refuge the verse right after this Proverbs 14:27 gives us the next understanding of the fear of the Lord It's Your Fountain of Life the fear of the Lord is a Fountain of Life to depart from the snares of death just as a fountain is a constant stream of life to our natural life so is the fear of the Lord a constant stream of life for our spiritual life next Proverbs 28:14 says the fear of the Lord is your source of happiness happy is the man that fearth always but he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into Mischief so true happiness comes from the fear of the Lord and it also is contrasted with a hard heart so that means the fear of the Lord must be a soft-hearted kind-hearted Christian next the fear of the Lord is your path to praise or future reward proverbs 31:30 of course this is the Proverbs 31 Woman chapter verse 30 says favor is deceitful and beauty is vain but a woman that fearth the Lord she shall be praised we know the Lord Jesus will have a great reward for us if we choose to fear the lord next moving to the Book of Psalms the fear of the Lord is your lasting Purity or cleanliness Psalms 199 the fear of the Lord is clean which means Purity or pure enduring forever the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous alog together so fearing the Lord leads to a lasting purity of heart and life before for the Lord constantly confessing our sins hating evil overcoming evil the fear of the Lord is also a lesson to be learned we see this in Deuteronomy 49 and 10 the Bible says only take heed to thyself and keep thy Soul diligently lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life but teach them thy sons and thy Sons Sons especially the day that thou stood before the Lord thy God in Horeb when the Lord said unto me gather me the people together and I'll make them hear my words that they may learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the Earth and that they may teach their children Moses tells us when the people of God stand before the Lord and before his prophet and hear the words of God it teaches them to fear the lord it's a lesson they must be learned that's why Church attendance is so important so powerful so life-changing next in Ecclesiastes 12: 13- 14 the fear of the Lord is your conclusion about life's purpose so many people wonder what their life's purposes and it really is to fear the lord and keep God's commands of course we know this is with love Jesus says three times in John 14 if you love me keep my commands let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter fear God and keep his Commandments for this is the whole duty of man for God shall bring every work into judgment with every secret thing whether it be good or whether it be evil and the final verse one of the most powerful verses about the fear of the Lord is that the fear of the Lord is your anointing to be like Christ this is from Isaiah 11 1-3 verse one says and there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse and a branch shall grow out of his roots and the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him the spirit of wisdom and understanding the spirit of counsel might the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord and shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the Lord and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes neither reprove after the hearing of his ears but with righteousness shall he judge the poor and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth and he shall Smite the Earth with the rod of his mouth and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked to close out this first section on Old Testament scripture let's look at how to obtain the fear of the Lord three simple passages of scripture the first step to obtain the fear of the Lord is to hate evil Proverbs 8:13 tells us this the Bible says the fear of the Lord is to hate evil now the reason this is the first step is because we know a lot of people can hate evil but they don't depart from Evil which is the second step the Bible speaks of this in 2 Corinthians where it speaks of two different kinds of Sorrow you have Godly sorrow which leads to repentance and taking vengeance upon the Devil and obeying God's word but you also have worldly sorrow and I've seen that many times people get worldly sorrow they feel bad they hate their sin but they don't overcome it they don't obey the word of God they remain stuck addicted to sin or in their evil complexes or evil habits so the first step is hate evil the second step is to depart from Evil Proverbs 3:7 be not wise in thine own eyes fear the lord and depart from Evil so the fear of the Lord hates evil the fear of the Lord helps you depart from Evil then thirdly you must seek God's will to understand the fear of the Lord this is Proverbs 2: 1-1 this is all in the pursuit of wisdom of course which comes after the fear of the Lord verse three says y if Thou criest after knowledge and liftest up thy voice for understanding if thou seekest her as silver and searches for her as for his treasure then Thou shalt understand the fear of the Lord and find the knowledge of God for the lord giveth wisdom out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding he layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous he's a buckler to them that walk uprightly he keepeth the path of judgment and preserveth the way of his Saints so the Bible's plain we must hate evil depart from that evil and seek God's will to understand the fear of the Lord and then he will direct our paths friends we come to the end of part one I hope this was a blessing stay tuned for part two we'll look at New Testament verses about the fear of the Lord then quotes from God's Prophet brother William brandham if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about
