[0:03] then the Bible didn't call him a pope
[0:05] the Bible called him a false
[0:09] prophet greetings friends in the
[0:11] matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[0:14] the purpose of this video is to explain
[0:16] who the future Antichrist will be I
[0:18] believe it'll be the pope of Rome and so
[0:21] by God's grace I'll make a short video
[0:23] here to explain why and if you like more
[0:25] reading on this topic you can look into
[0:27] my book The 12 New Testament Mysteries
[0:28] revealed I'm not a book salesman so if
[0:31] you can't afford it please email me and
[0:33] I'll email you a free pdf of the book
[0:36] friends I'm Jesse Smith pastor Bri of
[0:38] Christ Fellowship here in akaran Ohio
[0:40] USA for the past 18 years and I defend
[0:42] the Gospel of Jesus Christ that Christ
[0:44] revealed to St Paul and now has restored
[0:47] through the late Prophet brother William
[0:48] brandham 1909 to
[0:50] 1965 before getting into the issue of
[0:52] the Pope I wrote an entire chapter on
[0:55] mystery Babylon in my 12 New Testament
[0:57] Mysteries book there are 11 proofs that
[1:00] the Roman Catholic Church is the mother
[1:01] Harlot mystery Babylon of Revelation 17
[1:04] and 18 and many of the church fathers
[1:06] believed that the Roman Catholic Church
[1:09] was mystery Babylon including tertullian
[1:12] irenius and Jerome along with recent
[1:16] reformers Martin Luther John Knox John
[1:19] Calvin William Tindale and John
[1:20] Wickliffe to name a few here's the 11
[1:23] proofs I'm just going to read the titles
[1:24] of them so you're aware of these 11
[1:27] proofs and of course I have videos on
[1:29] the mother harlot as
[1:33] well proof one the Catholic church is a
[1:35] woman proof two the Catholic church is
[1:38] the modern-day
[1:39] Babylon proof number three the Catholic
[1:41] church is a mother of harlots like
[1:44] Jezebel proof number four the Catholic
[1:46] Church sits on many Waters proof number
[1:49] five the Catholic Church sits on seven
[1:50] mountains or Hills proof number six the
[1:53] Catholic church is a harlot or to
[1:56] Christ proof number seven the Catholic
[1:59] Church uses the scarlet and purple
[2:01] apparel proof number eight the Catholic
[2:03] church is wealthy proof number nine the
[2:06] Catholic church is drunken with the
[2:07] blood of the Saints proof number 10 the
[2:10] Catholic Church's headquarters is a
[2:11] great City and the 11th proof is the
[2:14] Catholic Church rides the Beast the
[2:17] spirit of ancient
[2:18] Rome so the first point I want to make
[2:20] is that there are many antichrists out
[2:22] in the world they are actually false
[2:24] teachers and this has been going on the
[2:27] last 2,000 years 1 John 2 vers 18 says
[2:31] little children it is the last time and
[2:33] as you have heard that the Antichrist
[2:34] shall come even now there are many
[2:37] antichrists whereby we know that it is
[2:39] the last time so I read the scripture to
[2:42] explain that you might hear preachers
[2:44] say there are antichrists and that's
[2:47] acurate any false teacher who's
[2:49] supporting the false religious system is
[2:51] an antichrist but there's coming one
[2:53] final Antichrist he'll be revealed after
[2:57] the Rapture at the beginning of the
[2:58] seven-year Great Tribulation period and
[3:00] his reign will be only about 3 and 1/2
[3:03] years I believe it's quite simple to
[3:05] prove that the pope is the future
[3:08] Antichrist because the woman of
[3:10] Revelation 17 the mother Harlot rides
[3:13] the Beast and we've already proved that
[3:15] Roman Catholic Church is the woman that
[3:17] rides the Beast so if the Roman Catholic
[3:19] Church rides the beast power then the
[3:22] leader of the Roman Catholic Church
[3:23] would be the false prophet or Antichrist
[3:27] that's according to Revelation
[3:28] 17:3 mystery Babylon is to sit upon a
[3:31] Scarlet colored Beast full of names of
[3:33] blasphemy having seven heads and 10
[3:36] horns so the woman Roman Catholic Church
[3:39] rides the beast power and God's Prophet
[3:42] The Late William brandom did say the
[3:44] pope would be the future Antichrist and
[3:45] also said he's the same person as the
[3:48] false prophet that the Book of
[3:50] Revelation speaks of the false prophet
[3:53] is mentioned in Revelation
[3:55] 163 Revelation
[3:58] 19:20 and revelation
[4:01] 20:10 a prophet is one who speaks for
[4:04] God so who is the false prophet who
[4:06] claims to speak for God but teaches the
[4:08] false Doctrine and is closely related to
[4:11] Rome it can be none other than the pope
[4:14] of Rome let's listen to the third seal
[4:16] where God's Prophet William brandham
[4:18] said the Bible doesn't call the
[4:19] Antichrist a pope it calls him the false
[4:22] prophet let's listen to the
[4:24] quote and they crowned a man a Superman
[4:28] see crowned him and then the Bible
[4:31] didn't call him a pope the Bible called
[4:34] him a false prophet why yeah of course
[4:38] he was be a false prophet by his
[4:40] Antichrist spirit that taught Antichrist
[4:43] against the original
[4:45] word because if you taught against the
[4:47] original word it was Antichrist and the
[4:49] word is God see Christ here comes the
[4:53] Pope the head to the woman the false
[4:55] Antichrist to the false bride of science
[4:58] which our world had our American Eastern
[5:01] World here Western world has led the
[5:03] world in science comes to her in his
[5:05] scientific church and now the whole
[5:07] Protestant is bound to
[5:09] him on
[5:11] 13 Now by God's grace let's go through
[5:13] this section I wrote in my book it's on
[5:15] pages
[5:16] 597 through 599 the Catholic catechism
[5:20] teaches the pope has the authority of
[5:22] Christ and has an infallibility in
[5:24] virtue of his office when he teaches on
[5:27] matters of faith and morals so notice
[5:30] the Catholic Church elevates the pope to
[5:32] infallibility at times yet we know the
[5:35] pope and his church are filled with
[5:36] false doctrines recently we've seen Pope
[5:38] Francis in the last few years accept
[5:41] homosexuality and even bless homosexual
[5:43] marriages so of course the pope of Rome
[5:46] cannot be infallible if he's blessing an
[5:49] abominable act also the pope is assigned
[5:52] the title Holy Father that's blasphemy
[5:55] Jesus said there's only one Holy Father
[5:57] in John 17:1 and Jesus said call no man
[6:01] father on this Earth Jesus said that in
[6:03] Matthew
[6:04] 23:9 and yet billions of people call the
[6:07] pope Holy Father only the heavenly
[6:10] father has the title of Holy Father now
[6:13] first portion of the scripture we want
[6:14] to look at is second
[6:15] thessalonians: 3-13 here's a detailed
[6:19] description of the Pope and his
[6:20] Blasphemous
[6:22] actions in verse two he's called the man
[6:24] of sin in verse two he's also called the
[6:28] son of predition or destruction very
[6:30] similar to Judas es scariot then he's
[6:33] called that Wicked in verse 8 so the
[6:36] pope is a sinful destructive and wicked
[6:39] man now in verse four he will sit in
[6:42] Jerusalem's future rebuilt Temple
[6:46] opposing and exalting himself above all
[6:48] that's called God or that's worshiped so
[6:51] that he sits in the temple of God
[6:52] showing himself that he is
[6:55] God so one day the future Pope will sit
[6:57] in the Jewish temp Temple the Third
[7:00] Temple a newly rebuilt Temple and make
[7:03] himself God next in verse 9 the Bible
[7:08] said his coming is after the working of
[7:09] Satan with all power and signs and lying
[7:13] wonders so the future Antichrist will
[7:15] have lying wonders they won't be true
[7:18] wonders they'll be lying wonders and
[7:20] he'll have satanic power to do signs and
[7:23] lying wonders and this matches
[7:26] Revelation 19:20 which says the false
[7:29] prophet Prophet is able to do Miracles
[7:31] now it seems like most of these signs
[7:33] Miracles and wonders will be lying
[7:35] Miracles and wonders but we know
[7:37] Hellbound preachers can even do genuine
[7:39] Miracles but if they break the word of
[7:41] God they're a false anointed one that's
[7:43] according to Matthew
[7:45] 7: 21- 23 the workers of iniquity said
[7:50] Lord do we not cast out Devils speak in
[7:52] tongues prophesy in your name and Jesus
[7:54] said I never knew you Jesus never denied
[7:57] that they did genuine miracles denied
[8:00] they knew Christ because they were
[8:01] workers of iniquity they did not live a
[8:03] holy
[8:05] life and then in verses
[8:08] 10-2 the pope deceives with
[8:10] unrighteousness and lies allowing his
[8:13] followers to live in the pleasures of
[8:15] sin and of course Catholicism does that
[8:18] Catholicism lets people commit sins live
[8:20] in sins as long as they confess their
[8:22] sins to their local priest they do not
[8:26] preach a sanctification message they
[8:28] don't even preach really a justification
[8:30] message most of them Catholics are known
[8:32] for teaching Faith plus works of course
[8:35] that's why God anointed Martin Luther to
[8:36] say we're justified by faith alone and
[8:39] then the final portion of that scripture
[8:41] 2 Thessalonians 2: 10-
[8:43] 13 those who overcome him the Antichrist
[8:46] will be Believers and lovers of the
[8:49] truth and Jesus said in John 17:17 Thy
[8:52] word is truth so the word of God is
[8:54] truth True Believers will love the word
[8:56] of God and not a man-made religion not
[8:59] not the Roman Catholic Church religion I
[9:01] want to go through four more portions of
[9:03] scripture from Daniel about the pope
[9:06] Antichrist to kind of get an idea what
[9:08] he's going to do around the time of the
[9:11] Rapture right after the Rapture during
[9:13] the tribulation of course there might be
[9:15] a carryover or overlap before the
[9:18] rapture we might see the pope taking his
[9:20] place and here's what he's going to do
[9:22] on the world stage in Daniel 8:23
[9:25] through2 it's a compound prophecy it was
[9:28] fulfilled first by Antiochus i 4 from
[9:31] 175 to 164 BC but has a future
[9:35] fulfillment in the future false prophet
[9:38] Pope for he shall stand up against the
[9:41] prince of princes Jesus Christ so the
[9:44] pope will oppose the true Jesus Christ
[9:47] of the word of
[9:48] God and he will have political policy to
[9:51] cause Financial craft to prosper so the
[9:56] pope Antichrist will be involved in
[9:58] politics and will make Financial craft
[10:01] to prosper so
[10:02] manufacturing and he will magnify
[10:04] himself in his heart all the nations
[10:07] will support the false prophet Pope
[10:09] because of his successful political and
[10:11] Financial
[10:12] Solutions and we can see how that's
[10:14] forming right now especially with
[10:16] inflation and with all the destruction
[10:19] to the financial system that Co has
[10:21] caused then in Daniel 9:27 it states
[10:24] that he the Antichrist Pope will make a
[10:27] onewe or 7-year Covenant with many but
[10:29] will break it after 3 and 1/2 years in
[10:32] the midst of the week the pope will
[10:34] cause Orthodox Jews to cease offering
[10:37] their animal sacrifices and oblations in
[10:40] their newly rebuilt
[10:41] Temple this 3 and 1/2 year period in the
[10:44] Great Tribulation is the same period
[10:46] that Israel's two anointed Witnesses or
[10:48] prophets are prophesying and manifesting
[10:51] God's power according to Revelation 11:
[10:53] 2 and
[10:55] 3 the third portion of scripture is
[10:57] Daniel 11: 21 through 31 it's another
[11:01] compound prophecy fulfilled by Antiochus
[11:03] IV but has a future fulfillment in the
[11:06] Antichrist Pope the pope is called a vow
[11:09] person and he'll make a peaceful League
[11:12] or Covenant with Israel through deceit
[11:14] and
[11:15] flatteries his deceitful heart though
[11:17] will be against the Holy Covenant of
[11:19] course that's the Old Testament Ten
[11:21] Commandments and the law of Moses and
[11:23] the pope will pollute the newly built
[11:25] Israeli Sanctuary by taking away the
[11:27] daily sacrifice of course that's in the
[11:29] middle of the week as well after three
[11:31] and a half
[11:33] years the final portion of scripture is
[11:35] Daniel 11:
[11:38] 36-45 Daniel 11 connects to 2
[11:41] Thessalonians 2:4 as the pope will speak
[11:43] against God exalting and magnifying
[11:45] himself above everyone and everything
[11:49] the Antichrist Pope will enter into the
[11:51] Glorious land or Jerusalem and try to
[11:53] set up his own Tabernacle in the
[11:55] glorious holy mountain but God will let
[11:58] him swiftly come to his end though and
[12:01] None Shall help
[12:04] him there was an interesting Uh current
[12:07] event recently where the pope attended a
[12:09] G7
[12:11] Summit right around June 14th
[12:14] 2024 and during this meeting President
[12:18] Joe Biden embraced Pope Francis with a
[12:21] forehead to forehead hug here's a
[12:23] picture of
[12:25] it notice this is the first pope to ever
[12:28] attend a G7 Gathering so we can see the
[12:30] pope starting to get more involved in
[12:33] worldwide politics apparently the pope
[12:35] was there to discuss issues about
[12:37] artificial intelligence energy and the
[12:40] Africa Mediterranean region then
[12:42] according to this article uh Joe Biden
[12:44] met with the Pope in individual meeting
[12:47] it says they met privately with Francis
[12:49] later
[12:51] Friday in
[12:53] closing friends hope this video was a
[12:55] blessing by the grace of God a young
[12:58] believer asked me about this topic last
[13:00] week so I thought I'd make a video on it
[13:01] by the grace of God I already had the
[13:02] notes there in the 2021 book the Bible
[13:06] is totally clear that the false prophet
[13:09] or Antichrist will be the pope it's
[13:11] undeniable so we thank the Lord that God
[13:14] has shown us the revelation of who the
[13:16] mother Harlot is the Roman Catholic
[13:18] Church we're so thankful the Bible said
[13:20] in Revelation 18:4 come out of her my
[13:23] people that you be not partakers of her
[13:25] sins and plagues so the Lord Jesus
[13:27] Christ is still calling his people out
[13:29] of the Roman Catholic church and all
[13:31] denominations that join in with the
[13:32] Roman Catholic Church the daughter
[13:34] churches of the mother Harlot this topic
[13:37] reminds me of Luke 21:36 watch ye
[13:40] therefore and pray always that ye may be
[13:42] accounted worthy to escape all these
[13:44] things that should come to pass and to
[13:46] stand before the son of man a few verses
[13:48] earlier Jesus said behold the Fig Tree
[13:50] and all the trees so the fig trees
[13:52] Israel the other trees are all the
[13:54] nations when they now shoot forth you
[13:56] see and know of your own selves that
[13:58] summer is now nigh at hand so when we
[14:01] see the pope going to a worldwide Summit
[14:04] for the first time ever and we see
[14:07] Israel having defend themselves and all
[14:09] the anger of all the nations coming
[14:11] against Israel we know these trees are
[14:13] putting forth their branches they're
[14:15] coming to maturity and so we know the
[14:17] Rapture is near by the grace of God
[14:19] perhaps In Our Lifetime maybe the next
[14:21] one we don't know no man knows the day
[14:23] or the hour but we can do what Jesus
[14:25] said take heed to ourselves do not be
[14:27] overcharged with
[14:29] with surfeiting drunkenness cares of
[14:32] this life so that day come upon you
[14:34] unawares Jesus is here to help us watch
[14:37] and pray always so we'll keep watching
[14:40] for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ
[14:42] and praying Always by the grace of
[14:44] God if you have any questions concerns
[14:47] or testimonies about this video please
[14:48] contact me God bless you and may Jesus
[14:51] Christ be the desire of your heart
