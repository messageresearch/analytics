TRANSCRIPT
========================================
so something said to me maybe you're a ratting on God's job so I prayed for a vision and media just got me a new Bible and brother uh brother Brown from up Ohio got me a new Bible both of them at the same time at Christmas I went and got one of the new Bibles I said Lord in the days going by you had a year of aunder now listen let me say this of course they're not this is not taping this meeting I'm P standing let me say this don't do this not good thing but I said Lord used to be on a dreamer dreamed a dream that they took it down to the yundum and told it and if the if the yundum flash the lights back a supernatural light the dream was true I said but that priesthood at year in the thund done away with your Bible is the year of a thunder now Lord may I never do this again I've asked you and prayed to you to give me a vision speak to me about why am I dreaming these dreams what have I done if I've harmed if I've done anything to any person in the world let me know I'll I I'll go make it right if I ow the Public Service Company if I've done something wrong to them or any other person if I done something wrong to you let me know I I want to make it right let's make it right now don't wait tillor maybe too late let's do it now now I said surely there's something in this word of God from Genesis and Revelations that some character in there that you dealt with would be on the same basis that would be my question if somebody done something and and you got to ask him about it now let me turn to that place in the Bible and if somebody whatever they' done and lean my way where I've done wrong or something you want me to do or haven't done let me see some character in The Bible like can I close my eyes just let the Bible fall off and put my finger on the scripture Genesis 24:7 El EA are Abraham's faithful servant the model servant of the Bible being sent to hunt the bride for Isaac chills run over me sure that's my that's right with the rest of my message pulling out the bride he said swear that you will not take a bride out of these but go to my own people he said what if the woman won't come with me said then you're free of this old he said and the god well of heaven will send his Angel before you to direct you he went right straight out begin praying and he met the beautiful Rebecca that become the Bride of Isaac just a perfect message back to the word go get that bride that's a duty that's what I'm here for that's what I'm trying to do is call out a bride remember in California there that interview of the Bride preview I haded here how that Bride come up first and Sen Her Go by then here come Miss America this Asia and all all the H looking thing and then the same bride passed by again one of them got out step and I was getting her back and step two of them it was that's what I was supposed to do keep that ride and step hunt that man I said God I'm going back home renew my bows again and start out a new so that's what we're planning on doing that's what I'm here for I think it'd be a good thing if we did this started on the 18th next we next Sunday morning next Sunday night the following Sunday in the following Sunday how many thinks that' be a good thing thank you now I want you to do something F me if you've notified any people that they there's going to be a meeting on the 28th will you R notify them again that we couldn't do it tell write them a letter or something that we don't want the people come and be disappointed but we could not get the auditorium we couldn't get it and so uh uh the calls the last meeting I think we had so many up there and everything they just you know how the public is and there well well we're just living in the last days that's all and um they claim that the people come in and disturb the school and they were there too early and they did this or that or something the place is too jammed up and the Fire Marshall does this and that and um you know so we will set up those files and those trumpets I want to place them in I told you it would they come under another thing so does the vials come over sounding the trumpets but we want to take that entire course right straight through and bring it tied in together how many's read any of brother Veil on rewriting that and fixing it up and grammaring it for me have you read any of it two or three of it I think you done a real job brother Bale real job you I think sister Bale did it and you just uh wrote see she was a see I'm not always against the women am a sister V so now let us for the next 15 20 minutes read a scripture here I and uh I got little book here I told I believe was it brother Vil or who was it I believe it's Roy borders brother Veil bought me the book I want to make a little textbook but if anybody ever looked at what I call notes I can want us preach about the Morning Star I'll draw a star and if I preach something I make it all in symbol your scratches nobody ever know what it was but I'm out and I think of anything I got a on a riding on the road sometimes a car jumping up and down and I'll jop this down say this and that and make little signs and Crossing Bridges and and all kinds of things like uh want to preach on the descending of the star and I'll put the pyramid draw out here put the five point star David coming down on it I know where I'm going in the scriptures like that Moses certain things he done just make little turkey tracks like I got several of them in here and I thought this morning back there when I thought I'd speak on this subject for a few minutes here on a note maybe take me 20 minutes and then I ain't going to take brother ne's service tonight uh uh I'm going to rest tonight listen to him and then the Lord willing next Sunday morning we'll start the service now y'all help me and we'll pray because it's in my heart to try they said well we could go to Louisville or we could go down to new ory but the meeting was supposed to be for Jeffersonville I'll go to L new all different times but this is supposed to be here at Jeffersonville now let's bow our head just a minute while we've been I've been talking to you here for about 30 minutes let's speak to him a moment Lord Jesus we are we are certainly a blessed people above our thinking above our understanding for if there was a noble among us such as uh some uh Personnel from some other country or Diplomat of some sort we think it was great to have such a noble person among us but today we have the god of Heaven not only among us but in US dwelling living his life through us and we're so thankful far this Lord is beyond our understanding of course but now speaking on what the services and going to Africa and the things that we tried to arrange for these few days here in the Indiana and somehow or another Lord maybe you're driving us to that tent to make that Vision fulfilled so thy will be done we've committed this way the best of our understanding so we pray Lord if there's anything contrary to your will you'll make it known to us that we might know to do your perfect will now bless us in these next few minutes speak to us through Thy word Lord for Thy word is true we ask it in Jesus name amen let's
