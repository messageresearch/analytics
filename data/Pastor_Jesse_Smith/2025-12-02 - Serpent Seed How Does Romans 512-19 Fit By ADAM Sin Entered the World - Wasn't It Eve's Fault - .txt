TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and the seed of the serpent, that's the killer. Many people don't believe that, but if you'll just read in Genesis, the Bible said that the serpent had a seed. &gt;&gt; Greetings, friends, in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ. [music] The purpose of this video is to answer a viewer's question about how Romans 5 12-19 [music] fit in with the serpent seed revelation. This is an excellent [music] question, one I've had myself before and one I addressed a couple years ago when I preached through the entire book of Romans by the grace of [music] Almighty God. So, let's get into this question here. by the grace of God. I'm not going to read all of Romans 5 [music] 12-19, but I'm going to focus on four phrases just to save some time. The Bible said, quote, "By one man sin entered." End quote. The second phrase is sinned, Adam's transgression. End quote. Third, one man's offense. And fourth, one man's disobedience. So these four phrases put the burden of sin upon Adam. So someone who believes in the serpent seed who's new to it might wonder, well why does God place the blame on Adam when we know Eve was deceived first in the beginning? In other words, she sinned first. So this is a great question. It deals with the mystery of iniquity as I wrote in my 2021 book about the 12 New Testament mysteries. And for your reference, the mystery of iniquity was in 2 Thessalonians 2:7, speaking of the future Antichrist, but Paul said it was already working over 2,000 years ago. And of course, we can trace back iniquity all the way back to the Garden of Eden. The 12 New Testament mysteries that God had, brother Random, finish according to Revelation 10:7. And the mystery of iniquity, of course, deals with the antichrist spirit from the beginning all the way to the end. Another way to put it is, as brother Brandham put it, the trail of the serpent. So the serpent seed shows how iniquity came into the world, into humanity. Of course, in Genesis chapter 3, we know iniquity started in heaven when Satan split the first church of God. Of course, he deceived a third of the angels, but then Satan was kicked out of heaven after the war with Michael. And Satan came down to the garden of God as the Bible says in Isaiah 14 and Ezekiel chapter 28. And then Satan possessed the beast serpent and seduced Eve, beguiled her, and deceived her into sinning. So there's at least four points we want to make here to show how Romans 5:12-19 fits perfectly in with the serpent seed revelation. Remember, God started the serpent seed teaching and revelation in Genesis 3:1 15. When God said he was going to put emnity or hatred between thy seed, the serpent's seed, and the woman's seed, which would be her offspring received from Adam, and then of course through Christ, who was the true seed of the woman, the seed given to Mary, of course. So, let's go back to those four phrases real quick. Quote, "By one man, sin entered." End quote. Sin entered because Adam was given dominion. He let sin enter the human race. So, we'll get to that in just a moment. The second phrase, quote, sinned, Adam's transgression, end quote. Adam purposely sinned. Eve did not purposely sin. Third, quote, one man's offense. End quote. And this word offense in Greek means a lapse or a deviation. Adam had a lapse. Adam deviated from the word of God which he knew. Again, Eve did not. She was deceived. And fourth, quote, one man's disobedience. End quote. Adam disobeyed the word of God that he knew and also the word that was forever settled in heaven. So let's get into these four points here I want to make about this and show how Romans 5:12-19 fits perfectly with the serpent seed revelation. First, Adam bears responsibility because he was given dominion by the Lord over the garden and everything in the garden in Genesis 1 26-28. So because Adam was given responsibility, he failed. Eve was not protected enough. it seems. And so that was Adam's fault. Adam was given dominion. And so we would say sin happened on Adam's watch or Adam's dominion. Second, perhaps Adam's neglect was because he was sleeping. Now, this is only presuming here, but but it is an interesting thought from Matthew chapter 13. Matthew 13:25 says, "But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tears among the wheat and went his way." So this is Jesus's parable, but it relates to the garden of Eden. There was two sewers in one field, just as there were two males that had seed and Eve was the one garden. Of course, Adam was one and then the beast was the other. So this is a possibility. Adam could have been sleeping and again that would have been neglectful because it was his job to take dominion over the Garden of Eden. Third, Adam purposely sinned. Eve did not because the Bible said Eve was deceived in 1 Timothy chapter 2 verse 14 says Adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression. So Eve did not know what she was doing necessarily. Adam knew what he was doing when he sinned when he saw Eve in her defiled state. He knew what he was doing when he parttook of the fruit or in that case sexual relations. But again this is the reason women are not allowed to preach because Eve was deceived with the word of God. That's spoken of in two places in the scripture. 1 Timothy 2 and then 1 Corinthians chapter 14 where Paul says women are not allowed to speak in the church concerning preaching the word of God. And then all the commentators that I've read from the 1800s such as Albert Barnes, Matthew Henry, John Wesley, they all point back to Genesis 3:16 where Adam was given rulership over Eve. He would rule over her. And so therefore, she was not allowed to preach and teach him. She was not allowed to rule over him. And fourth and finally, the blame is placed on Adam because Adam should not have taken Eve back based upon the word that was already settled in heaven. Brother Ram talks about this in the church age book. Now Psalm 119 says the word of God is forever settled in heaven. And brother Ram states that how even though Adam was on earth, the word of God was already settled in heaven. God already had a written record in heaven of his word and how to carry out his word. So the eternal word would have already said that a defiled wife with another man or beast in this case should have been stoned according to Leviticus 20 10. So that word of course wasn't written yet because Moses wrote it, but it was already written in [clears throat] heaven. And so that was God's decision on what should have happened. But we know Adam loved his wife just as Christ loved the church. So Adam purposely took on Eve's sin in order to be with her because he loved her. She was part of him. Christ willingly took on our sin because we were part of him. We were chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world. Ephesians 1:4. Now something Deuteronomy 24:es 1-4 was the word of God that was forever settled in heaven that Adam broke. But I personally don't see that because if you read all four verses, it seems that this refers to a man who has divorced his wife, sent her away. She's already married another man, and then the Bible said in verse four that he can't take her back because it's an abomination. She's defiled. But Adam didn't do this. Adam didn't divorce Eve first, send her away, and then she had adultery with the serpent, and then she came back to Adam. So, some have used those verses, Deuteronomy 24, but I think Leviticus 20:10 is the more appropriate verse. Brother Ram wrote about this question in the third chapter of the church age book, the Ephesian church age. It was page 104 in the old blue book. Brother Ram wrote, quote, "If Eve fell that way, what did Adam do for God? Lays the blame on Adam. That is simple. The word of God is forever settled in heaven before one speck of stardust was made. That word, God's law was there exactly as it is written in our Bible. Now, the word teaches us that if a woman leaves her husband and goes with another man, she is an adulteress and is no longer married and the husband is not to take her back. That word was true in Eden, as it was true when Moses wrote it in the law. The word can't change. Adam took her back. He knew exactly what he was doing, but he did it anyway. He knew exactly what would happen to the human race. And he sold the human race into sin that he might have Eve, for he loved her. End quote. So, I hope this was helpful, friends, by God's grace. And in closing, let's remember those nine evidences that we've compiled by God's grace through brother Bram's sermons. Nine evidences or proofs of the serpent seed revelation. And here's the evidences in the order of their appearance. The first evidence of the serpent seed, the two trees in the midst were not literal trees because the Bible said they were good for food and any tree that will kill you is not good for food. That's Genesis 2:9. Second, the tree of life in the garden was the spirit of Jesus according to Genesis 2:9. Because there's only one way to eternal life. Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life. Eating literal fruit could never give eternal life. Eternal life only comes by grace through faith in the word of God. Third, the serpent was humanlike before the fall according to Genesis 3:es 1-5 and verse 14. The fourth proof is pretty powerful. After their sin, whatever sin they committed, Adam and Eve realized they were naked and then sewed aprons or loin coverings together. In Genesis 3:7, we know God's punishments always fit the crime. And so if they sinned with their mouth and ate fruit, they would have covered their mouth. But they didn't cover their mouth. They covered their private parts, their loins, and they knew they were naked. Fifth, the seed of the woman was a literal man, Jesus. So the seed of the serpent must be a literal man as well. And that was Cain. Six, Cain was the serpent's son, not Adam's son. According to 1 John 3:12, not as Cain who was of that wicked one and slew his brother. Cain was not of Adam because Adam was blessed and righteous. Cain was of the serpent, that wicked one. Adam was not the wicked one. Seventh, God's punishments for Eve centered on her sexual reproduction and longing for Adam. So again, God's punishments always fit the crime. Because Eve received the wrong seed, she was punished in bringing forth seed and had pain in bringing forth seed. and her longing was for the serpent beforehand. So God changed it and said, "Your longing is going to be for Adam." Eighth, this is super powerful. The serpent seed explains the virgin birth. Why did Jesus have to come by virgin birth? Because sin entered the world through a sexual act of adultery. So God had to bypass that in order to start a new creation in order to redeem his people. It took a virgin birth to bring forth redemption. man fell through sexual sin. So it took a virgin birth to restore mankind. And ninth and last, the doctrine of the serpent seed runs from Genesis to Revelation. So I want to thank that brother who emailed about this months ago. I'm finally getting to it now. I felt led to address this. So we rejoice in the revelations God has revealed to us. Remember, Brother Bam told us marriage and divorce and serpent seed were revelations along with the seven seals that were thus sayith the Lord. And truly they are because they line up with the holy scriptures. And we can clearly see how Romans 5 12-19 fits in with the revelation of the serpent seed. Friends, we should rejoice. Serpent seed doesn't save us, but it shines more light on the truth we're all trying to see. &gt;&gt; And if you do not understand it, I'm I'm available anytime to do my very best to help you by letter or by or by personal interview or anything that I could do to help you. Of course, we realize that that doesn't save a man. Neither does it condemn a man. But it only brings light upon the subject that we're all trying so hard to get the people to see. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It only brings light. &gt;&gt; Thank God for the truth of the word of God. Thank God that our eyes have been open and enlightened to the revelation of the Holy Spirit. It is only the Holy Spirit that gives light. As I read this morning in the church age book, the oil from the candlestick help produce light. And so the Holy Spirit will produce light and revelation in our lives. Thank God for the light of the Holy Ghost. If you have [music] any questions, concerns or testimonies about this video, please contact me.
