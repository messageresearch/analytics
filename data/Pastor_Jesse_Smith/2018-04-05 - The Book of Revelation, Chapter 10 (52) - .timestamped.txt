[0:03] Revelation chapter 10 the theme of this
[0:09] chapter is the open book coming to the
[0:11] earth to finish the mystery of God and
[0:13] to be prophesied to the entire world
[0:18] this open book was the same book that
[0:20] was formerly sealed with seven seals as
[0:22] described earlier in chapters five six
[0:25] and eight
[0:27] the symbols and key revelations include
[0:30] the mighty angel the little open book
[0:33] the cry with a loud voice as a lion's
[0:36] roar the seven thunders the seventh
[0:39] angel the eating of The Little Book and
[0:42] the command for John to prophesy again
[0:45] to the entire world the mighty angel is
[0:50] a symbol of Christ Jesus coming down to
[0:52] earth as verse 1 gives descriptions of
[0:55] Christ that matched previous
[0:57] descriptions of Christ in chapter 1
[0:59] verses 15 and 16
[1:05] the little open book is
[1:08] that the mysteries of all seven seals
[1:10] are now to be revealed upon the earth
[1:12] Christ has come down to reveal the
[1:15] identity of the four horse riders
[1:18] the souls under the altar the day of
[1:22] wrath
[1:24] and the silence in heaven at the moment
[1:27] of the rapture
[1:30] the cry with a loud voice as a lion's
[1:33] roar is a symbol of God speaking through
[1:35] a prophet as seen in Amos chapter 3
[1:38] verses 7 and 8 so the Bible foretold
[1:41] that Christ would reveal the mystery of
[1:43] the seven seals to a prophet on the
[1:45] earth
[1:47] Amos 3:7 surely the Lord God will do
[1:50] nothing but he revealeth his secret unto
[1:53] his servants the prophets the lion hath
[1:56] roared who will not fear the Lord God
[1:59] hath spoken who can but prophesy the
[2:02] seven thunders are symbols of the voice
[2:05] of God as taught in Psalms 18 verse 13
[2:08] Psalms 29 verses three to eleven and
[2:11] John 12 verses 28 and 29 we can see that
[2:16] Christ would speak through a prophet and
[2:18] that a prophets teaching on the seven
[2:21] seals from the open book would be thus
[2:23] saith the Lord the voice of God spoken
[2:26] on the earth
[2:29] the seventh angel is a symbol of an
[2:31] earthly man as taught in Galatians 4:14
[2:34] First Samuel 29 verse 9
[2:37] second Samuel 1927 and Revelation
[2:40] chapter 22 verses 8 and 9 so this
[2:43] seventh angel is both the seventh angel
[2:46] of the Laodicean Church H revelation
[2:49] 3:14 and he is the Prophet Christ spoke
[2:52] through as a lion in Revelation 10 verse
[2:55] 3
[2:57] we believe this profit and seventh angel
[3:01] was william branham whose Bible
[3:03] teachings from the Holy Spirit finished
[3:05] the mystery of God
[3:09] the eating of this little book is a
[3:11] symbol of believing and obeying the
[3:13] truths that Christ spoke in his
[3:15] revelations on the seven seals according
[3:18] to first Peter 2:2 and Matthew 4:4
[3:21] and Matthew 5 verse 6 the command for
[3:25] John to prophesy again to the entire
[3:28] world is a symbol of the New Testament
[3:30] church or Bride of Christ taking the
[3:33] open book and it's revelations and
[3:35] spreading the truth around the world
[3:37] finishing the Great Commission that
[3:39] Jesus spoke of in Matthew 28 verses 19
[3:42] and 20
[3:44] John symbolizes the New Testament church
[3:47] because he was called to come up hither
[3:49] into heaven in Revelation 4 verse 1
[3:52] immediately after the 7 Church Ages of
[3:55] Revelation chapters 2 and 3 which is
[3:59] exactly what will happen to the Bride of
[4:00] Christ at the rapture as spoken of by
[4:03] Saint Paul in 1st Thessalonians chapter
[4:05] 4 verses 13 through 18
[4:11] the timing of events in this chapter is
[4:13] as follows our conviction is that Christ
[4:17] came down to earth utter the seven
[4:20] thunders or revelations of the seven
[4:23] seals through his prophet William
[4:25] Branham in 1963
[4:31] william branham preached these
[4:32] revelations with thus sayeth the Lord
[4:35] in March of 1963 so we believe
[4:38] revelation 10 verses one to seven is
[4:41] fulfilled and in the past we believe
[4:44] verses eight through eleven which is the
[4:46] command for John to prophesy the open
[4:49] book of the revealed seven seals is
[4:51] being fulfilled right now in the present
[4:53] time
[4:55] this is because John represents the true
[4:57] New Testament church and her preachers
[5:00] are prophesying again or sharing the
[5:02] prophecies that God gave to William
[5:04] Branham in regards to the seven seals
[5:06] and the Bible to many people's nations
[5:09] tongues and kings if you'd like more
[5:14] bible scriptures quotations or if you
[5:16] have any questions about the book of
[5:18] Revelation please contact us god bless
[5:22] you and may Jesus Christ be the desire
[5:24] of your heart
