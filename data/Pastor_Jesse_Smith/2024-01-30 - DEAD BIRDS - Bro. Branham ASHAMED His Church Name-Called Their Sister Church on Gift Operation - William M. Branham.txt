TRANSCRIPT
========================================
now also in here I might bring this out I see my I don't think my brother's here tonight but somebody made fun of somebody leaving the Tabernacle and went down to brother Junior Jackson's for a church said they went down amongst the dead birds aren't you ashamed to make a remark like that ever who you are if you're my kid here in Christ I'm ashamed of you don't do a thing like that Junior Jackson is my brother Don rutle is my brother well the reason of it because when I set the church here in a certain order when I come back to see if I could get the manifestation of the gifts half of them pulled away from it because when you would start to speak or preach or something it got it was getting in such a place that you could hardly preach unless there was somebody spoke in Tong somebody somebody give interpretation and half of it never even come to pass now I believe in speaking in tongues I believe in interpretation but it must be something directly to the church not the Lord is coming soon or something which is all right but don't use vain repetitions Jesus said as heathens do it must be something go tell brother so and so a certain thing he done and and get well go tell brother sister so and so when she did a certain thing down there other day she transgressed the laws of her husband's the vow to her husband unless she makes this lot right the holy spirit will cut her off there you've got thus sayith the Lord then bring that sin in amen that's when we got a Church like it was when aniz 5 come in Lord then we got a church to stand solid oh you say brother Bram one guy told him that he said well you put us too much on the spot I said ain't I on the spot up there amen The Strangers will never seen in my life but I got faith and confidence in my God who sent me to do this and never one time has it been wrong or never will be as long as it's God right not speaking in tongues and things like that I believe it those tongues and people got them gifts if they're real genuwine Christians and interested in it they'll meet themselves together because and give the tongues and interpretations and see what they can do to further the kingdom of God they got a Ministry of their own but it don't belong here in the middle of the audience where the Sinners are being dealt with and so forth the Bible said they say you're unlearned sometimes it get so irreverent with it and and so forth not our gang haton but I let him go ahead a while I said watch it now I told the brethen his Witnesses here to know this I said let it alone own after a while I'll we'll find out whether it's of God or not if it cannot stand chastisement then it's a bastard child exactly what the Bible said and when the chastisement come what happened did I tell you that long ago asked the pastor here he said what about this and that I said just let it alone they're babies we can't judge it but watch when it really comes to pin down to the word now brother Junior Jackson had a right to disagree with that he wants his church the people all want to speak with tongues and things in the audience that's brother Junior's uh troubl that's that's up to him but Junior Jackson believes this message the same as and the rest of us does he's one of us and it's not a dead bird to go there Junior Jackson is a man of God that I love with all my heart amen it's not here tonight so I can really pour it on the way I want to and and Don rutle I don't think Don's here tonight because they got church of their own but if I seen every person come to this Tabernacle walk out and go to Don rutle or or brother JT Parnell or brother any of these brothers here that's our brothers here and fellow citizens of the Kingdom I'd be so happy I wouldn't know what to do I'd say Lord fill this one back up again let's pour it out and fill up another one I'd love it I'd love to see those boys they're my they're my children now JT or or any of the rest of them don't have to believe just like I do they don't have to do that as I told you this morning I don't even agree with my wife or she don't agree with with me what if I went to table and Junior got apple pie and I got cherry pie brother we're both eating pie we'd agree that but and we both preach the same gospel his church discipline you know Peter and Paul had differences not in their doctrines but the way Peter was behaving himself they had a little difference in it but it never separated them they were brothers well sure we're going to have differences not differences I disagree with Assemblies of God I disagree with their systems but there's a many Assembly of God man is a precious brother I disagree with the Wess Doctrine but there's a many of those men are precious man I agree disagree with the Baptist with the Presbyterians in their systems but in there there's genuine Christians amen somehow other afternoon I picked up a telegram I missed it a brother a Baptist preacher said he been seeking for a long time to come to a place or get to a place where man respected God and instead of respecting one another and a precious brother comes to this church said I'll take you to such a place he was long to get here a Baptist you see they're scattered everywhere I wouldn't agree with their system but I certainly love the party so don't say that about the brother now in here these gifts are got to be watched no gift had to watch it Satan can impersonate any gift look at these Beatles now go to impersonate Divine Healing filthy dirty rotten borned Out of Hell amen see all right
