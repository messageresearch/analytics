[0:02] revelation chapter 15.
[0:07] the themes of this chapter include the
[0:09] seven last plagues
[0:11] the victors over the beast and the seven
[0:14] golden vials
[0:17] verse one introduces us to seven angels
[0:20] who have the seven last plagues
[0:23] verses two through four speak of a group
[0:26] of victors who got victory
[0:28] over the beast standing on the sea of
[0:30] glass in heaven
[0:31] who sing the song of moses and of the
[0:33] lamb jesus christ
[0:37] this group seems to be the 144 thousand
[0:39] israeli believers
[0:41] who receive jesus christ as their
[0:43] messiah during the tribulation period
[0:45] we could be wrong on this point but two
[0:47] details seem to connect this group
[0:49] to the 144 thousand which are
[0:53] first harps and second the song of moses
[0:57] concerning harps
[0:59] when christ stands with the 144 thousand
[1:01] jews on mount
[1:02] zion in revelation 14 verses 1 through 5
[1:05] the voice of harpers harping with their
[1:07] harps is heard
[1:09] so in the book of revelation harps are
[1:11] connected to the jews
[1:14] second concerning the song of moses the
[1:17] city of jerusalem which will be home to
[1:19] the remnant of believing jews
[1:20] according to revelation 11 15 and 12
[1:24] 17 will receive two witnesses one of
[1:27] which is described as having the same
[1:28] ministry as
[1:29] moses in revelation 11 verse 6
[1:33] and have power over waters to turn them
[1:35] to blood and to smite the earth with all
[1:37] plagues
[1:38] as often as they will verses five
[1:41] through eight concludes the chapter by
[1:43] showing the open temple
[1:45] of the tabernacle in heaven one of the
[1:47] four beasts gives the seven vowels or
[1:49] bulls
[1:50] to the seven angels and these vowels or
[1:53] bowls
[1:53] are full of the wrath of god
[1:58] the symbols in key revelations include
[2:00] the sea of glass mingled with fire
[2:03] the beast the image of the beast the
[2:06] mark of the beast
[2:07] the number of the beast's name and the
[2:09] temple of the tabernacle of the
[2:11] testimony
[2:12] in heaven the sea of glass mingle with
[2:16] fire is twice mentioned in revelation 4
[2:18] verse 6
[2:19] and 15 verse 2. it's located near
[2:22] jesus's throne and represents the old
[2:24] testament labor
[2:26] used by priests to wash themselves
[2:28] before coming closer to god
[2:30] in the holy place the heavenly sea of
[2:33] glass seems to represent god's plan to
[2:35] purge
[2:36] or wash his covenant people israel
[2:39] psalm 77 verse 19 says thy way is in the
[2:43] sea
[2:44] and thy path in the great waters
[2:48] in the case of revelation 15 verse 2
[2:50] it's the 144 000 holy ghost-filled jews
[2:54] who are washed by jesus's blood the
[2:56] blood of the lamb
[2:57] when they accepted him on earth but are
[3:00] now in heaven
[3:01] they were victorious over the mark of
[3:02] the beast the fiery sea of glass in
[3:04] heaven means they endured
[3:06] the fiery tribulation period yet were
[3:09] victorious
[3:11] the beast is the antichrist or spirit of
[3:14] rome
[3:15] the spirit in the roman catholic church
[3:16] currently operating through
[3:18] and veil behind the united states
[3:21] according to revelation
[3:22] 13 verses 11 through 18.
[3:25] the 144 thousand faithful jews will get
[3:28] victory over the roman catholic church
[3:30] beast
[3:30] for they will not take the mark of the
[3:32] beast
[3:35] the image of the beast is a world
[3:36] council of false christian churches
[3:38] that will be granted great political
[3:40] power to cause anyone to be killed who
[3:43] will not worship and obey
[3:44] their unionized religious group
[3:48] the mark of the beast enforced by the
[3:50] ecumenical image of the beast
[3:52] is twofold either in the hand or on the
[3:55] forehead
[3:56] people cannot buy or sell without the
[3:58] mark the mark in the right
[4:00] hand represents doing the will of the
[4:01] religious council and the mark in the
[4:03] forehead represents believing the false
[4:05] doctrine
[4:06] of the false religious system
[4:10] the number of the beast is a number of a
[4:11] man which is 666
[4:14] there have been many guesses as to the
[4:16] meaning of this number
[4:17] but there is only one man to be revealed
[4:19] in the near future
[4:20] who is closely associated with rome and
[4:23] has a connection to the number 666
[4:27] that is the pope of the roman catholic
[4:29] church
[4:30] we come to this conclusion because the
[4:32] pope has been given the title
[4:34] vicarius philia day or vicar of gods
[4:38] the roman numerals for vicarius philia
[4:41] day
[4:42] add up to the exact number of 666
[4:45] furthermore the second proof that the
[4:47] office of the pope will be the office of
[4:49] the person of the antichrist
[4:51] comes from revelation 17 which states
[4:54] that the woman
[4:55] who sits on seven mountains or hills the
[4:57] roman catholic church
[4:59] sits upon or rides the beast or demonic
[5:02] spirit of rome
[5:03] if the roman catholic church is the one
[5:05] controlling the fourth and final kingdom
[5:07] of rome
[5:08] then the pope who's the head of their
[5:10] false church
[5:11] is the only person who could rule the
[5:13] entire world as the person
[5:15] of the antichrist
[5:19] the open temple of the tabernacle of the
[5:21] testimony in heaven
[5:22] gives us more insight into the design of
[5:25] heaven's sanctuary
[5:26] just as revelation chapters 4 5 6 7 8
[5:30] 14 and 16 do
[5:34] recall moses built his earthly
[5:35] tabernacle based upon the pattern of
[5:37] heaven's temple
[5:39] of the tabernacle of the testimony
[5:41] according to exodus 25 verse 40.
[5:44] based upon moses pattern we'd begin from
[5:47] the outside and work our way in
[5:52] it seems the sea of glass like under
[5:53] crystal was before the throne
[5:55] just as the laver was in the outer court
[5:57] in moses's tabernacle
[5:59] next we'd see the seven golden
[6:01] candlesticks revelation 1 verses 12 and
[6:04] 13
[6:05] followed by the golden altar of incense
[6:07] revelation 8 verse 3
[6:09] to represent the second court or holy
[6:12] place
[6:13] hebrews 6 verses 19 and 20 seem to teach
[6:16] the third core
[6:17] in heaven the holiest of holies has a
[6:20] veil like moses's tabernacle had
[6:22] thankfully for all sinners jesus has
[6:25] entered beyond this veil with his blood
[6:27] according to hebrews 7 verses 25 through
[6:30] 27
[6:31] and hebrews 9 verse 12.
[6:34] jesus entered beyond the veil to the
[6:37] throne of god as high priest
[6:38] to always make intercession for you and
[6:40] i praise god for jesus blood
[6:43] speaking mercy for us in heaven
[6:45] according to hebrews 12
[6:47] 24 revelation 5 verse 6 and revelation
[6:50] 19 verse 13.
[6:53] jesus sits on his throne in the holiest
[6:55] of holies
[6:56] and there's four living creatures
[6:58] worshiping him just as ezekiel 1
[7:00] verses 1 through 28 and revelation 4
[7:04] verses 6 through 9 teach
[7:07] based upon revelation 15 verse 8 no man
[7:10] was able to enter the heavenly temple
[7:12] due to it being filled
[7:13] with the smoke from the glory of god the
[7:16] seven plagues or seven vows were soon to
[7:18] be poured out
[7:19] and the saved men in heaven would not
[7:21] have access to the temple
[7:22] as god's wrath was being poured out upon
[7:24] the earth
[7:26] it seems men did have access to the
[7:28] heavenly temple prior
[7:29] to the vows being poured out
[7:33] the timing of events is as follows
[7:37] the victors over the beast worshiping in
[7:39] heaven would have to take place sometime
[7:41] after revelation 14 verses 1 through 5
[7:45] when they had been fully redeemed by
[7:46] christ marked by the holy ghost in their
[7:48] foreheads
[7:49] and literally standing on mount zion in
[7:51] jerusalem
[7:52] their heavenly worship seems to take
[7:54] place before the millennium
[7:55] since they speak in future tents of all
[7:58] nations coming to worship god
[8:00] revelation 15 verse 4 who shall not fear
[8:03] thee o lord and glorify thy name
[8:05] for thou only art holy for all nations
[8:08] shall come and worship before thee
[8:10] for thy judgments are made manifest
[8:15] isaiah chapter 2 verses 1 through 4
[8:17] beautifully describe all nations
[8:19] worshiping jesus
[8:21] in the millennium the end of verse 1
[8:24] says
[8:24] and all nations shall flow unto it
[8:28] the preparation of the seven vows would
[8:30] have to take place sometime after the
[8:32] seventh trumpets
[8:33] but before the battle of armageddon for
[8:36] the battle of armageddon is the last
[8:37] battle that slays
[8:38] nearly all men and women of the earth
[8:41] according to revelation 19 verses 18
[8:44] and 19.
