Description:
Part 3 focuses on "WHEN" the Rapture will occur. Jesus taught us that the literal day and hour of the rapture was unknown in Mark 13:32-33. St. Paul then taught us that the rapture and "Day of the Lord" would come as a "thief" in the night - as a sudden surprise to sinners -  and assured Christians that they would not be overtaken as a thief, but would rather be appointed unto salvation through the Lord Jesus Christ (1 Thess. 5:1-10). The video concludes with a summary of the 5 reasons why the rapture will occur before the Great Tribulation period. To view a separate video with more detail about the 5 reasons, please see the link below.
