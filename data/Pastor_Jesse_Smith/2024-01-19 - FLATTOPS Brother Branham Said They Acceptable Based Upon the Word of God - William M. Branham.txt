TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] is it wrong to have a flat top haircut no brother I just say that see I don't I don't think God cares how a man cuts his hair as long as he cuts it greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to answer a viewer's question I received by email he asked our flat top haircuts wrong this brother is from an overseas country in Africa and he said this topic is dividing the Brethren the truth is that flat top haircuts are not sinful according to brother brandham as this video will show but first i'm Pastor Jesse Smith I pastored bride of Christ Fellowship here in akan Ohio USA for 17 years and I defend the Bible revelations that Jesus Christ revealed to his humble genuine Prophet brother William Branham and also defend brother bram's Godly character against the accus accusers of brother brandham who are often foolishly slandering brother brandham and my often prayer is that they will repent and ask God for forgiveness for slander friends it's sad to hear about the division in this African country but it is understandable in one way especially if the Brethren don't have access to all of brother Ram's quotes on a particular topic it's also understandable because from 1959 to 1963 brother brandham spoke negatively about Flatt tops eight times and never spoke positively between that 5-year time period but what a lot of people may not know is that the final two mentions of flattop from Brother brandom were 1964 and he said they were not sinful in 1964 and you'll see brother BR was asked directly were Flatt Toops wrong and he said no before getting this quote I just want to share a few of the negative quotes from Brother Brenham I'm not going to play them I'm just going to read them I personally don't feel like I need to go through all the eight negative quotes but you can understand the context in one quote brother brandom said an old man wants to be a teenager again so he'll get a flat top haircut with a duck tail in the back he wants to be like one of these rock and roll Kings well the ram said it's a sin and disgrace now it's a sin and disgrace for a man to be like a rock and roll king to do the sins of rock and roll Kings but as brother R will tell us later the Bible doesn't condemn flat top haircuts in a second quote brother R said a bunch of Flatt top haircuts Ricky who run around with women with bobbed hair so brother random Associates Flatt top haircut boys with Bob teed women now of course Bob tear is sinful that's 1 Corinthians 11 1-16 any honest Bible reader knows that in another quote brother random was basically rebuking JFK but he said the Americans wanted a flat top Ricky a modern Elvis of the day smart educated politician with a genius brain you got it he said now of course JFK did not have a Flatt top haircut but it seems brother brandham is saying the worldly men and women got what they wanted a modern politician who is no doubt a sinful man hopefully he repented before he was assassinated but we don't know but it's the association brother Brandon is making with with a modern trendy politician who is a sinner and one more quote brother was talking about popular sex Queens he said don't identify yourself with one of these flat Elvis Presley and I'm not even sure if Elvis Presley ever had a flat top I'm not sure and then he mentioned Pat Boon he said let Christ reflect himself in you so we can see from these quotes brother Ram was basically associating modern sinful men like Elvis Pat Boon and JFK with the Modern Trend of that day the modern haircut for men the popular trendy haircut was Flatt tops but of course some of these men did not even have Flatt tops now let's get to the main quote where brother random says Flatt top haircuts are not sinful this quote is from questions and answers part 2 1964 August 23rd evening service so let's listen to the question brother BR has directly asked a question about flat top haircuts let's listen to the quote brother BR is it wrong to have a flat top haircut now friends right after this question brother Ram tells a story of a woman he slapped on a leg I think on a bus after they laughed at a joke together because he didn't know she was a woman because she was dressed like a man which is an Abomination according to Deuteronomy 22:5 and Friends remember my 63rd video is called Abominations in the Bible please go watch that video if you don't understand how some of the Old Testament Abominations carry over to the New Testament I'll leave a link to that video in the description a related video is my 62nd video do the Ten Commandments apply to Christians so please rather than criticizing me if you disagree please humbly go watch the video humbly read your Bible pray and I believe if you do that you'll see that God carries over many moral Commandments from the Old Testament into the New Testament it's undeniable so I plead with you especially if you're an accuser brother brandom or an accuser of me please humbly go watch the video and look at the Bible verses that I used the Bible is my absolute the Bible was brother brandom's absolute so please go humbly study the script scripture if you are a Berean before you put negative comments on this video and as I've told a person in the comments recently yes I will delete comments and I will block people if they no longer debate with respect if they troll me if they name call me unjustly I'm here to help people but I'm also here to warn people as Colossians 1 says and after I've warned them if they continue to act disrespectful I'll block them and then of course I'll pray for their repentance brother Ram told this story about accidentally slapping this woman on the leg because he said Sometimes women get haircuts like men and that's true I see a lot of elderly women in my area they get haircuts just like men my wife and I were just talking it's so sad you see elderly couples and you can't tell really who's the man or woman sometimes because they have the same haircut same pants same shoes it's a really sad disgrace anyways I thought I would play this story brother Ram tells right after being asked about Flatt tops it is a funny story in one way and sad of course in another way that a woman would be so abominable that she would dress and act and sound just like a man let's listen to the quote I I suppose this is a man I I hope it is well now some women do that sure I was going up on a bus one time I State game warden here going up here I sit there and a man was talking like that had a welder's cap on Isis talking to him and he was going ahead smoking a cigarette had a welder glasses pushed up like that was right up here around sellers bird and I sitting there talking to that fell he said something and we all got laugh and I hit him on the leg I said boy that that really Takes the Cake doesn't it and I sitting there like that and directly some a woman sitting across there said say Ruth are you going to had on overhauls great big burle just like a man sitting there smoking a cigarette and blowing it out her nose I thought it was a man sound about dropping a sulene torch and doing something hit on somebody's head and knocked the watch called off and start laughing I laughed to and slapped her right on the leg thinking it was a man I didn't know the difference you can't tell him and the Bible said any woman that puts on a garment pertaining to a man it's an Abomination there we are then friends after this story brother answered the question and said no flat tops are not wrong to have because he didn't think God cares how a man cuts his hair as long as he cuts it of course he goes back to the Bible 1 Corinthians 11 1-16 I love brother Ram's answer because it again shows how he was a word Prophet going back to the Bible because his absolute was the Bible he goes to the Bible for the answer I love that about brother brandham and remember friends brother brandham wasn't Perfect by any means he never said that anyone that says that is a liar and a deceiver and has an antichrist Spirit but on brother ROM's major doctrines from the Bible as I've stated on many of my videos he was exactly right by the help of the Holy Ghost and brother even gave us thus sayith the Lord on numerous doctrines and Mysteries I wrote about that in my 2021 book The 12 New Testament Mysteries so now in this quote you'll hear brother brandom say I just say that regarding Flatt top haircuts so eight times brother brandom just Associated Flatt tops with other sinful actions of his day but that did not mean Flatt tops were sinful themselves so it just seems Flatt tops were just a trendy popular haircut that people were talking about maybe in the news but there was nothing sinful about the flat top haircut let's listen to the quote no brother if you want a flat top hair tiut I tell you you just wait to get about my age you'll have one it's all right I didn't mean that like that buddy bless your heart if you believe brother Braham tell you the truth I don't think God says anything about man his his covering is just long as he cuts his hair if he lets his hair go down long like a woman the Bible says it's a shame for a man to do that but now if as long as you got your hair and you're a little boy and I know I've said a whole lot about it you Ricky with that plat top haircut and all like that and things like that but I I just say that see I don't I don't think God cares how a man cuts his hair as long as he cuts it because his head is God but a woman's head is a man so this short quote ends with brother BR giving a Stern warning to women who cut their hair and this of course relates to the video I made about why did brother brandom say a man could divorce his wife if she cut her hair it's video number 129 if you want to watch that I'll leave that in the description as well in closing friends it's a joy to defend the Bible revelations God gave to brother brandham as as Philippians 1:7 And1 17 say Paul said in the defense and confirmation of the gospel and then he says knowing that I am set for the defense of the gospel and even this week I was thinking of how we have to defend the gospel there's a beautiful type of that in the oldest Testament Israel had to fight to possess the promised land but then after that once they were in the land they had to fight to defend the promised land and so by God's grace we do that we defend the Bible revelations of this hour the end time message that God has revealed to his servant his Prophet brother William brandham I want to end though with a prayer for Unity in this African country as St Paul prayed endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit endeavoring means giving diligence to keep Unity it means exerting oneself giving effort to keep the unity and to end the division or stop the division it's in Ephesians 4 veres 2-6 with all loneliness and meekness with long suffering forbearing one another in love endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of Peace so I pray for these African brothers that they'll have the bond of Peace they'll choose to love rather than criticize one another and divide from each other there's one calling one Spirit even as you are called in one hope of your calling one Lord One Faith one baptism one God and Father of all who's above all and through all and in you all so let's have a word of prayer father God I pray your great Holy Spirit Lord will use this video to help the Brethren there in Africa lord it's understandable how there could be a little bit of confusion here especially if the Brethren haven't heard all the quotes So Lord we just ask that the holy spirit will bring Unity forgiveness if people have hurt one another I pray they will endeavor or give diligence give effort to bring the unity of the Holy Spirit May the churches be unified for the glory of God may they take every question back to the absolute the word of God and I pray God you'll do a great work of the Holy Spirit of healing and unity and love of the Holy Ghost In Jesus Christ's name amen if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your [Music] heart
