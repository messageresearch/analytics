[0:11] god bless you and welcome to the
[0:13] defending the message podcast i'm your
[0:16] co-host pastor jesse smith and here's
[0:18] our other co-host
[0:19] um i'm amen god bless you everyone we
[0:22] just want to thank you guys for coming
[0:23] and joining us today for our podcast
[0:25] today and we're here to defend the faith
[0:28] and defend the message today we're going
[0:30] to do two topics the first topic will be
[0:32] the four kinds of grounds from jesus's
[0:34] parable from matthew chapter 13 and our
[0:37] second topic will be the fact that more
[0:39] prophets were to come after jesus
[0:42] and before we get started lord willing
[0:44] in future podcasts will be covering
[0:46] topics and questions related to the two
[0:47] extremes
[0:49] around the bible-based message god gave
[0:51] to his prophet brother william branham
[0:53] one extreme falsely accuses and attacks
[0:56] brother branham calling him a false
[0:57] prophet in charlatan and the other
[0:59] extreme worships william branham by
[1:01] exalting his tapes to infallibility
[1:04] claiming every word he spoke on tape was
[1:06] thus say the lord which is heresy today
[1:08] though we're covering these two subjects
[1:10] jesus's foregrounds parable and the fact
[1:12] that prophets came after jesus as
[1:15] promised in our first podcast we're
[1:17] going to start with the foregrounds
[1:19] in jesus's parable of the four grounds
[1:21] found in matthew 13 verses 3 through 9
[1:24] and then 18-23
[1:26] he gives us four kinds of grounds that
[1:28] the word of god falls upon the first is
[1:30] called the wayside ground the second is
[1:33] stoney the third is thorny and the last
[1:36] is a good ground and then jesus
[1:38] interprets these for us the first kind
[1:40] is the wayside the wayside hears the
[1:42] word of god the seed falls on the ground
[1:44] but then satan immediately snatches away
[1:46] the second kind is a stony ground where
[1:48] the word of god is received at first
[1:50] with joy but then in times of temptation
[1:52] and doesn't grow and he had no deep root
[1:54] within himself
[1:56] the third kind is the thorny ground
[1:58] where the seed falls down and begins to
[2:00] grow but it's choked out by all the
[2:02] cares of the world and the last ground
[2:04] is the good ground which jesus calls a
[2:06] good honest heart and this kind of seed
[2:09] produces of its own kind and brings
[2:11] forth fruit
[2:12] this parable helps us understand the
[2:14] classification of where every person
[2:17] falls in the entire world they either
[2:20] fall on a good one which is the wise
[2:22] virgin
[2:23] a thorny heart which is the foolish
[2:25] virgin the stony heart which is the
[2:27] workers of iniquity
[2:29] who at one time might have been sincere
[2:31] but sold out the faith and fell away or
[2:34] the wayside ground those who
[2:36] never really believed and never even
[2:38] tried really to follow god but they did
[2:40] hear the word of god and they were
[2:41] accountable for it so that's why this is
[2:43] a great revelation it's part of the
[2:45] mystery of the kingdom of heaven as
[2:46] jesus said and remember he promised to
[2:48] finish all the mysteries of god so
[2:50] that's why we're so thankful that god
[2:52] has restored this revelation in this
[2:54] time
[2:55] this parable proves there are two kinds
[2:56] of hearts that are saved and two kinds
[2:59] of hearts that are lost
[3:01] the two saved hearts are the wise and
[3:03] foolish virgins jesus mentioned in
[3:05] matthew 25
[3:06] verses 1-13
[3:08] and the two lost hearts are the
[3:10] make-believers a judas iscariot who was
[3:12] the son of perdition and eventually lost
[3:15] and unbelievers
[3:16] this subject is a progressive revelation
[3:18] that god revealed to brother branham
[3:20] over the course of his ministry and then
[3:22] just before he went off the scene he
[3:24] clearly taught this revelation in the
[3:25] church age book saying there were four
[3:27] classes of people on page 279 and it's
[3:30] in chapter 7 while writing the section
[3:33] on the book of life
[3:39] there are two different kinds of
[3:40] christians
[3:41] i remember i had a topic with my dad
[3:43] once
[3:44] where he kind of argued and disputed
[3:46] that oh all christians are the same
[3:48] which is not true
[3:50] and that oh we all believe in the same
[3:52] god we'll all go to heaven if we all
[3:54] believe in him but in the bible it
[3:56] clearly states that there are two
[3:58] different kinds of christians let's go
[4:00] through something some common examples
[4:02] in the bible of of a holy man and of a
[4:05] righteous man but a good example would
[4:07] be abraham and lot and a big very
[4:10] important scripture is first peter 4 18
[4:12] and it says and if the righteous
[4:15] scarcely be saved where shall the
[4:17] ungodly and sinner appear
[4:19] saying that there are righteous
[4:20] christians but they are barely saved
[4:23] also in the tribulation there would be
[4:25] righteous christians that are very safe
[4:27] that would have to die for their faith
[4:30] and if you look at abraham lot's example
[4:32] lot barely escapes solomon gomorrah
[4:35] you know with noah he barely escaped the
[4:37] flood which enoch was a perfect type of
[4:40] the wise virgin and we go back to the
[4:42] parable of the wise and foolish virgins
[4:44] kali states that there's wise christians
[4:46] and foolish christians but both of them
[4:48] were
[4:49] both sanctified unto god
[4:51] but one didn't have the holy ghost
[4:53] yeah brother amen that's a great example
[4:54] of lot he's a great example of a foolish
[4:57] virgin notice he was scarcely saved out
[4:59] of sodom he and his daughters which is a
[5:01] type of the foolish virgin being spared
[5:03] from the wrath of the tribulation period
[5:05] they'll suffer and die as martyrs as
[5:07] brother adam said during the first half
[5:09] of the tribulation period but they will
[5:10] not suffer the second half of the
[5:13] tribulation where the trumpets and vials
[5:15] are sounded and poured out but notice
[5:18] abraham the type of the wise virgin was
[5:19] far away from sodom he wasn't even close
[5:22] to it and we're to be the anti-type of
[5:24] abraham where we stay away from
[5:25] denominationalism and we live a humble
[5:28] holy ghost-filled separated life away
[5:30] from those who don't have the same
[5:32] revelation we have of the message of the
[5:34] hour
[5:34] you want to go to what brother bram said
[5:37] about there's always three kinds of
[5:38] grounds within every church
[5:40] yeah brother that quotes from three
[5:42] kinds of believers 1963 november 24th
[5:45] brother branham preached three kinds of
[5:47] believers quote the first is believers
[5:50] make believers and unbelievers now this
[5:52] is quite a subject he said but as sure
[5:54] as we sit here tonight that group is
[5:56] always gathered together wherever the
[5:58] people gather we find this group and
[6:00] always have found them and we probably
[6:02] always will have them until the coming
[6:04] of the lord and i want us tonight to
[6:06] picture ourselves as i speak of these
[6:09] three groups and see what group that we
[6:11] are in end quote
[6:13] so notice brother brahms said we've
[6:14] always had these three kinds of
[6:15] believers
[6:16] now again you can make the three
[6:18] believers fit into the four classes
[6:20] because wise and foolish virgins are
[6:22] both believers the make-believers would
[6:24] be the judas escara type that believed
[6:26] for a while also the workers of iniquity
[6:28] that fall away and the unbelievers will
[6:30] be the kind that never professed faith
[6:32] in god such as pharaoh from the days of
[6:34] moses the sodomites from the days of lot
[6:37] and any other bible person who never had
[6:39] faith in god
[6:40] i mean i'll go back to some of my
[6:42] experiences
[6:44] where i've met plenty of different
[6:45] people from churches and you can always
[6:49] see like some people love god some
[6:51] people
[6:52] they don't want to be there some people
[6:53] go there because their family goes there
[6:56] you kind of see like oh
[6:58] this person doesn't really believe in
[7:00] god so what kind of what kind of ground
[7:03] is he on you know or this person really
[7:04] loves god
[7:06] but yet he still compromises in this
[7:08] area yeah brother amen that's a great
[7:10] example you can discern what kind of
[7:12] heart reaction they have to the gospel
[7:14] i remember back back going to my old
[7:16] church it's we were always saying oh you
[7:19] guys don't want to be like judas so i
[7:21] will always have that thought like maybe
[7:23] i'm a judas because i compromise on this
[7:25] part but i still saving god you know and
[7:28] they try to put that on you and i'm glad
[7:30] i came to this message where i don't
[7:31] actually feel like that no more it's you
[7:33] have freedom from the fear of being of a
[7:35] judas which you know you won't betray
[7:37] god in the end
[7:39] but that's something they come up with
[7:41] when they have when you're in a
[7:43] denomination that's what you battle are
[7:44] you am i a judas am i going to sell out
[7:47] god at the end of my life or anything
[7:49] yeah that's a beautiful thought and i
[7:51] think any honest christian would admit
[7:53] that they battle that at some point am i
[7:54] going to sell out the lord am i going to
[7:56] betray christ am i going to be a judas
[7:59] but jesus's revelation shows us how
[8:01] there's four kinds of grounds and we can
[8:03] just look at our lives like paul said we
[8:05] can examine ourselves whether we're in
[8:07] the faith or not and the bible says make
[8:09] your calling election sure so each day
[8:11] we choose to overcome each day we choose
[8:13] to repent of our sins
[8:15] and more faithfully serve jesus christ
[8:18] and our life is what proves which
[8:20] classification we're in
[8:21] and brother i just had a fresh thought
[8:23] about judas's spirit in relation to the
[8:24] foregrounds of course he was the stony
[8:27] ground that rejoiced in the ministry of
[8:28] jesus for a while until offenses came
[8:31] and he had no deep root within himself
[8:33] the bible says we should be rooted and
[8:34] grounded in love so judas didn't have a
[8:37] real deep love for christ and the word
[8:39] and the gospel
[8:40] and i just thought of this too the best
[8:42] kind of ground the good ground was good
[8:44] and honest so judas was not that good
[8:46] ground he was not the thorny ground he
[8:48] was the stony ground and this scripture
[8:50] just came to me from john chapter 12
[8:52] where the bible said judas didn't even
[8:54] care for the poor remember when the
[8:56] expensive ointment was used to anoint
[8:58] jesus's head and feet judas complained
[9:00] about it and said it should have been
[9:02] sold and given to the poor but he was
[9:03] not being honest he did not have a good
[9:06] and honest heart look how easy it would
[9:08] have been
[9:09] for him to go confess to jesus or one of
[9:12] the 11 other apostles and say i just
[9:14] need to be honest i don't care for the
[9:16] poor can you pray for me can you help me
[9:18] i need to repent of my selfishness i
[9:20] need to repent of my greediness so i
[9:22] hope that's a help to somebody by god's
[9:24] grace because it really shows the
[9:25] importance of having a good and honest
[9:27] heart
[9:32] brother amen gave some great examples
[9:34] here i want to go through a couple more
[9:36] brother amen mentioned how there were
[9:38] four kinds of believers in the days of
[9:39] enoch you had enoch noah and then
[9:42] borderline believers that maybe listened
[9:44] to noah for a while but then fell away
[9:47] but then you had the unbelievers and the
[9:48] mockers that were lost so four kinds in
[9:50] enoch's day and noah's day then you had
[9:52] four kinds in abraham's day you had
[9:54] abraham the wise virgin type lot the
[9:57] foolish virgin type he was saved the
[9:59] bible said that in second peter chapter
[10:00] two
[10:01] mrs lott was lost or she was the
[10:04] make-believer or the borderline believer
[10:06] then you had the sodomites who never
[10:07] believed in the first place that were
[10:09] totally lost
[10:10] brother brahm said when jesus died there
[10:12] was not three crosses but four
[10:14] so in 1953 brother brown was already
[10:16] telling us about this revelation
[10:19] although it didn't really come to a
[10:20] fruition to the end of his ministry when
[10:22] he had the church age book written and
[10:23] put those words in there on page 279
[10:26] about there's a fourth class or another
[10:28] class of believers so here's an example
[10:31] brother branham growing in progressive
[10:32] revelation jesus had a cross he was the
[10:35] type of the wise virgin the saved thief
[10:38] who was saved right at the end is a type
[10:39] of the foolish virgin who didn't live
[10:41] the same type of life as jesus lived but
[10:44] he was still saved then you had judas
[10:46] who hung on for a while judas the
[10:47] make-believer hung around for a while
[10:50] but sold out christ and was lost and
[10:52] then you had the lost thief who never
[10:53] believed in jesus to begin with another
[10:55] one i found today was in the days of
[10:57] micaiah he was the wise virgin he stayed
[10:59] with what elijah said you had
[11:01] jehoshaphat who kind of compromised with
[11:03] ahab a little bit and didn't really live
[11:06] the life he should have lived he's a
[11:07] type of the foolish virgin you had ahab
[11:10] who would repent a little bit
[11:12] and kind of believe for a while but then
[11:14] of course ended up being lost married to
[11:16] jezebel and then you had jezebel who
[11:17] never did believe it all so again there
[11:19] you have the four classes of believers
[11:21] where do you think nicodemus and joseph
[11:24] lands that's a good question about
[11:26] nicodemus and joseph of arimathea in
[11:27] fact that'd be a good subject for a
[11:29] future podcast
[11:30] because we could research their history
[11:32] and see
[11:33] what does history say about their life
[11:35] and did their life produce a genuine
[11:38] repentance and following of christ for
[11:40] example did they
[11:41] repent of following the jewish sanhedrin
[11:45] and then get saved sanctified baptized
[11:48] filled with the holy ghost or not so
[11:49] that'd be a good subject i think brother
[11:51] branham to the best that he knew in the
[11:53] church age book he said perhaps
[11:55] nicodemus would be saved
[11:57] because brother ann must have not
[11:59] studied his history of course i haven't
[12:00] either
[12:01] but yeah that'd be a good subject to
[12:02] study out and see what was the fruits of
[12:05] their life did they did their hearts end
[12:07] up being a good heart
[12:08] well here's another scripture that
[12:10] supports the four kinds of ground which
[12:11] is revelation 22 11 he that is unjust
[12:15] let him be unjust still he that is
[12:16] filthy let him be filthy still he that
[12:19] is righteous let him be righteous still
[12:20] and he that is holy let them be holy
[12:22] still so it clearly sees that there's a
[12:24] holy christian there's a righteous
[12:26] christian there are filthy people who's
[12:28] pretty much as a judas and the unjust or
[12:31] the people that never believed in the
[12:32] first place
[12:33] and notice this is in revelation 22
[12:35] right this is the end of the bible this
[12:38] is the the final prophecy before the
[12:40] book is finished and jesus is letting us
[12:43] know there's always been four kinds of
[12:44] people since the beginning of time even
[12:47] we can see it like in the days of enoch
[12:49] and days of abraham and there's going to
[12:50] be these four kinds all the way up to
[12:52] the end of human history and we're
[12:54] approaching that very quickly here as
[12:56] we're closing in on the times of the
[12:58] gentiles as jesus said in luke 21 verse
[13:01] 24 and after the rapture of the bride of
[13:03] christ then god is going to leave the
[13:05] gentiles and go back to the jews
[13:07] so we're talking about the ending with
[13:10] the white throne judgment a good point
[13:12] is that the holy christians or the ones
[13:14] that believed in the full word they were
[13:16] already been judged so they would be
[13:17] judging with jesus and says in
[13:19] revelations 3 21 to him that overcometh
[13:22] will i grant to sit with me in my throne
[13:25] even as i overcome and sat down with my
[13:27] father in his throne just hearing that
[13:29] makes me joyful knowing that we get to
[13:32] sit with christ and that we get to we're
[13:36] able to judge with him and we'll be in
[13:37] one accord with him so we're already
[13:40] judged here and we've already made our
[13:42] path straight and those who didn't are
[13:44] those who loved god but didn't go with
[13:46] him all the way and everyone else who
[13:48] didn't believe
[13:50] right the foolish virgins are going to
[13:51] have to be judged at the white throne
[13:52] judgment because they live foolishly
[13:54] during their time all here on earth and
[13:56] remember paul told the corinthians in
[13:58] 1st corinthians chapter 6 he said do ye
[14:01] not know that the saints shall judge the
[14:03] world
[14:04] now paul also said every man must stand
[14:06] before the judgment seat of christ
[14:08] so we understand that to mean the holy
[14:09] ghost-filled raptured saints they'll go
[14:11] up to the marriage supper of the lamb
[14:13] and sometime up there in heaven while
[14:15] the earth is experiencing the awful
[14:16] tribulation period the holy ghost filled
[14:18] believers will all stand before christ
[14:20] and their lives will be judged but they
[14:21] will be receiving rewards during that
[14:23] judgment because their lives were
[14:25] already judged by the word they were
[14:26] washed by the waters of the word here
[14:29] during this lifetime
[14:30] and then after the thousand-year
[14:31] millennium the battle of gog and magog
[14:33] at the white throne judgment the holy
[14:35] ghost-filled saints sit with jesus on
[14:38] the throne as jesus promised there was
[14:40] brother amen read in revelation 3 21 of
[14:42] course that promise goes not just to
[14:44] today's holy ghost filled believers but
[14:46] all the believers down through all the
[14:48] seven church ages because the bible says
[14:50] he that overcomes inherits all things
[14:53] let's talk a little bit about the
[14:54] millennium that's a good topic to talk
[14:57] about
[14:58] i believe the millennium is only for
[15:00] those who have the holy ghost who who
[15:02] are the wise virgins and the foolish
[15:04] christians would not be able to go to
[15:06] the millennium
[15:08] as i believe the millennium is the
[15:10] honeymoon period for the bride of jesus
[15:12] christ and for jesus and that's when
[15:14] he'll be ruling for a thousand years in
[15:16] revelations 25 through 6 it says but the
[15:19] rest of the dead lived not again until
[15:21] the thousand years were finished this is
[15:24] the first resurrection blessed and holy
[15:26] is he that have part in the first
[15:28] resurrection on such the second death
[15:30] have no power but they shall be priests
[15:33] of god and of christ and still reign
[15:35] with him a thousand years
[15:37] in the millennium you're spending a
[15:38] thousand years of christ i don't think
[15:40] you'll be judged at the right time
[15:41] judgment if you're already reigning with
[15:43] christ that's exactly right the bible
[15:45] says we live for a thousand years we
[15:48] reign with him because as verse 4 says
[15:51] in revelation 20 these believers did not
[15:53] worship the beast which is the spirit of
[15:55] rome today
[15:56] nor their image and then paul said in
[15:58] the book of romans as well we reign in
[16:00] this life by jesus christ so we rule
[16:03] over sin the flesh the devil the world
[16:06] and we do that by yielding to the holy
[16:08] spirit and then we live like paul said
[16:10] we don't live by our faith but we live
[16:12] by the faith of the son of god and so
[16:14] that's where we'd say foolish virgins
[16:15] they're virgin to the word they're
[16:17] virgin to all the word that they believe
[16:19] but they've been foolish not to redeem
[16:21] their time and get the oil which is the
[16:23] baptism of the holy ghost but they're
[16:25] still virgin they never had intercourse
[16:28] or spiritual fornication with idols but
[16:30] they were foolish they failed to believe
[16:32] all the promises of god that the wise
[16:34] virgin received and prepared for so
[16:37] because of that they cannot live the
[16:39] bible said the rest of the dead live not
[16:41] again so the rest of the dead includes
[16:43] all the sinners it includes the foolish
[16:46] virgin that were not born again of the
[16:47] holy ghost and the jews who are blinded
[16:50] to the messiah but are still saved as
[16:52] god's prophet brother i'm taught in the
[16:53] fifth seal as well
[16:55] so it's only the holy ghost-filled
[16:57] saints down through the ages that live
[16:59] and reign with christ during the
[17:00] thousand years and it's a reward because
[17:02] jesus said if you invest in your talents
[17:04] if you have five talents invest in the
[17:06] five you get ten he said because you've
[17:08] done this i'll make your ruler over ten
[17:10] cities or so we see the rewards of
[17:12] christ when you're faithful and reign
[17:14] over sin in this life he allows you to
[17:16] rule and reign during the millennium i
[17:18] have a lot of friends and denominations
[17:20] that obey the word but they don't obey
[17:22] every single thing
[17:23] because their denominational beliefs or
[17:26] their pastor says oh no we don't believe
[17:27] that or an example would be like oh we
[17:29] don't believe in days and miracles
[17:31] anymore because we think it's past which
[17:33] is not true but what does the bible say
[17:35] you would believe your pastor or would
[17:37] you believe what the word of god says
[17:39] that really separates who is a wise
[17:41] virgin and a foolish virgin is someone
[17:43] who believes the word all the way no
[17:45] matter what it says oh really good
[17:47] scripture is jesus christ is the same
[17:49] yesterday today and forever
[17:51] i mean so many people just overlooked
[17:53] that if jesus healed people in the past
[17:56] that jesus saved people in the past
[17:58] jesus said you will be able to do this
[18:00] and that according to scripture
[18:02] it still applies to today and the future
[18:05] that's a misconception with
[18:07] denominations we're saying the days of
[18:09] miracle is past but don't you believe
[18:11] jesus jesus said it's not passage that
[18:13] he's the same yesterday forever and
[18:16] these signs shall follow them that
[18:17] believe
[18:18] and god's prophet brother brahm said
[18:20] jesus and paul ordained the gifts in the
[18:22] bible and they never took him out
[18:25] so how can a church take them out how
[18:27] can a church deny the word of god like
[18:28] that so
[18:29] exactly right he's the same yesterday
[18:31] today and forever when you have that
[18:32] principle from hebrews 13 8 and also
[18:35] from the book of malachi where he says i
[18:36] am the lord and i change not
[18:38] if you're really in love with god if you
[18:40] really hear what the spirit is saying to
[18:42] the churches you'll hear the fact that
[18:44] the holy spirit is saying i still
[18:46] send signs these signs still follow them
[18:49] that believe because they're born again
[18:50] they have the life of jesus christ
[18:52] inside their souls
[18:54] and you see in denominations where
[18:55] there's not a lot of miracles it's
[18:57] because they don't believe in the first
[18:58] place
[19:00] remember jesus said i can't perform many
[19:02] miracles because of their unbelief
[19:04] and that's the same thing with
[19:05] denominations if you don't believe that
[19:06] god can do this then you won't see it
[19:09] happening
[19:10] amen and that shows the denominational
[19:12] system is dead like revelation 3 1 says
[19:14] they have a name that they live but
[19:16] they're dead they call themselves
[19:17] lutherans methodist church of christ
[19:19] they have a name they're trying to live
[19:21] but they're spiritually dead to the
[19:23] things of god so within those
[19:24] denominations you have a few that are
[19:27] saved because jesus said in matthew 7 14
[19:30] few will find the narrow road to
[19:32] salvation it's a dead system the
[19:34] denominational system is dead but
[19:36] there's a few in there that will find it
[19:38] and they'll be the foolish virgins
[19:40] they're foolish because they should have
[19:42] came out of there they should have left
[19:44] that they should have believed more of
[19:46] the word and got born again but at the
[19:48] same time god is merciful to them just
[19:49] like he was merciful to lot down there
[19:51] in sodom lot didn't partake in the
[19:53] homosexuality he called it wickedness
[19:55] well the same is true today you have
[19:57] christians in denominational systems
[19:59] that they condemn wicked sins and
[20:01] abominations but they're foolish and
[20:03] they don't leave the system but the
[20:04] bible still calls a lot of righteous man
[20:06] that's why we can look at denominations
[20:08] and in in love say there's some
[20:10] righteous in there and we pray for them
[20:11] to come out just like abraham prayed for
[20:13] lot it's really sad to see when you ask
[20:16] them like are you a christian and they
[20:18] say no i'm a methodist i'm a baptist
[20:21] what's that god do with being a
[20:23] christian a christian is someone who
[20:25] follows the word of god and believes the
[20:26] bible and we don't see that nowadays
[20:29] where there's so many few christians
[20:31] that actually
[20:32] genuinely believe the word of god and
[20:34] it's getting smaller and smaller every
[20:36] day the denomination has really pretty
[20:38] much taken over the whole world where
[20:40] everything's just a system now it's just
[20:42] you go to church and you'll be saved
[20:44] which is false yeah that's exactly
[20:46] scriptural you know jesus said few there
[20:48] be that find it then paul gave us
[20:50] prophecy and said the last days will be
[20:52] perilous or troublesome times he said
[20:55] before the antichrist is revealed
[20:56] there's a great falling away so in order
[20:58] to fall away from christianity you have
[21:00] to be gathered around christianity in
[21:01] order to fall away and that's what we're
[21:02] seeing today a great falling away and
[21:04] paul also prophesied in 2nd timothy
[21:06] chapter 3 that evil men and seducers
[21:09] will wax worse and worse deceived and
[21:11] being deceived so we know less and less
[21:13] people will be saved and times are
[21:14] getting spiritually darker all the time
[21:16] but that just means the light and truth
[21:17] of jesus christ will shine brighter and
[21:19] brighter and we shouldn't be discouraged
[21:21] to keep praying for our friends and our
[21:22] families hoping that they'll come into
[21:24] the word of god
[21:26] you know the greatest gift is to be
[21:28] saved and to have salvation in jesus
[21:31] exactly and god reminded our church of
[21:33] that recently right we had a brother who
[21:34] was with us five years ago his name is
[21:36] brother austin
[21:37] he left the church he got discouraged
[21:39] the enemy got a short-term victory over
[21:41] him but we kept praying and week after
[21:43] week month after month year after year
[21:45] for five years request after request was
[21:47] made that god would bring him back
[21:50] and then in december 2021 after five
[21:53] years god brought our brother back and
[21:55] god has done sign after wonder after
[21:57] miracle proving that god is the one that
[22:00] brought him back and god is the one
[22:01] that's going to sanctify him so again
[22:03] that should be our heart just like
[22:04] abraham's heart abraham's heart was to
[22:06] pray for lot right to pray for the
[22:08] foolish virgin so that's our desire we
[22:10] want to pray for the foolish virgin as
[22:11] well and by grace we're believing austin
[22:14] is a wise virgin just like we believe
[22:15] for ourselves but this is an example to
[22:18] never give up praying for our friends
[22:20] and family
[22:21] sometimes it takes a long time for the
[22:22] prayer to come to pass but know that god
[22:25] always keeps his word and god will give
[22:27] them the opportunity to come back to the
[22:29] word of god and do time in season
[22:36] now i kind of want to look at this
[22:37] thought about how a lot of people don't
[22:39] understand the four kinds of grounds
[22:42] because they don't believe the church
[22:43] age book or haven't read the church age
[22:45] book but i'd like to deal with some of
[22:46] these thoughts here for a few moments
[22:48] most people who follow the message of
[22:50] william branham have heard him say
[22:51] there's always three kinds of believers
[22:53] and that's true but as brother branham
[22:54] went on in his revelation
[22:56] as we said in the church age book he
[22:58] says there's a fourth class but both
[23:00] statements can still work with scripture
[23:02] so what i mean by this if you say
[23:04] there's three kinds of believers brother
[23:05] branham said there was believers there
[23:07] was make-believers and unbelievers well
[23:09] that still fits with the four classes as
[23:11] long as you put the two kinds of
[23:13] believers the wise and the foolish
[23:15] inside the believer's class and then the
[23:17] make-believers would be the ones that
[23:18] were lost like judas or mrs lott then
[23:21] you have the unbelievers who were never
[23:23] saved like the sodomites or even pharaoh
[23:26] from moses's day who never believed and
[23:28] again as i mentioned earlier brother
[23:30] branham talked about the four crosses in
[23:32] 1953 so 12 years before he passed away
[23:35] god had given him insight into these
[23:37] four kinds of believers and then it's
[23:39] laid out beautifully in the church age
[23:41] book where he's in the section on the
[23:43] book of life
[23:44] and he says there's a section called the
[23:46] lamb's book of life those names can
[23:47] never be removed those were the ones
[23:49] that were predestinated before the
[23:51] foundation world that's the wise virgin
[23:54] he said but in that foolish virgin group
[23:56] god records the names of believers and
[23:58] some of them will remain but some can
[24:00] also be blotted out like we saw with
[24:02] judas brother branham said judas's name
[24:04] was blotted out because he believed for
[24:05] a while but then in the hour temptation
[24:08] he sold out christ and jesus said those
[24:10] who don't overcome their names will be
[24:11] blotted out of the book of life
[24:13] yeah that just proves that the
[24:15] there's a false doctrine of once they've
[24:17] always saved which is clearly not
[24:20] scriptural or not supported in scripture
[24:22] and we see it in the old testament and
[24:23] the new testament because in the book of
[24:25] exodus moses stands in the gap for
[24:27] israel says blot my name out and let
[24:29] israel be saved and god said no moses he
[24:32] said i'll only blot out those who sinned
[24:34] against me so we see again jesus christ
[24:36] is the same yesterday today and forever
[24:38] in the old testament names had to be
[24:40] blotted out if people refused god's
[24:42] covenant and the same is true in the new
[24:43] testament names are blotted out if
[24:45] people sell out the blood covenant of
[24:47] jesus christ some people say there's not
[24:50] four kinds of classes but i think we
[24:51] prove by the scripture there are
[24:53] revelation 22 11 second timothy 2 20
[24:56] matthew 13. those are three clear
[24:58] examples and we see four kinds of
[25:00] believers in four different time periods
[25:02] jesus's time enoch's time abraham's time
[25:04] and makai's time
[25:06] and i must apologize i now realize i
[25:08] didn't mention paul's bible teaching
[25:11] of the four kinds of vessels that
[25:12] supports jesus's four grounds parable
[25:15] and it's found in second timothy two
[25:17] verse twenty
[25:18] it says but in the great house there are
[25:20] not only vessels of golden of silver but
[25:23] also of wood and of earth
[25:25] and some to honor and some to dishonor
[25:28] again this is a beautiful scripture
[25:30] showing four kinds of vessels perfectly
[25:32] supporting jesus's foregrounds parables
[25:35] so in this case the gold and the silver
[25:37] would be the two kinds of saved
[25:39] believers the gold would be the wise
[25:41] virgin and the silver would be the
[25:43] foolish virgin the other two kinds would
[25:45] be the two kinds of lost people the wood
[25:47] and earth the wood would be the
[25:50] make-believers like judas iscariot and
[25:52] the earth would be the unbelievers like
[25:54] pharaoh the sodomites and others from
[25:56] bible examples and notice the bible says
[25:58] some to honor the gold and silver
[26:00] vessels were honorable vessels very
[26:02] useful vessels and then the wood and
[26:04] earth vessels would be dishonorable
[26:06] vessels and of course these four kind of
[26:08] vessels go along with the four
[26:10] conditions every soul finds themselves
[26:12] in according to revelation chapter 22
[26:14] verse 11 the holy and righteous would be
[26:17] the wise and foolish and the filthy and
[26:19] unjust the filthy would be the
[26:21] make-believer the unjust would be the
[26:23] unbeliever
[26:24] so some people might wonder about the
[26:26] jews the blinded jews that brother
[26:28] branham preaches about in the fifth seal
[26:30] brother branham said these blinded jews
[26:32] are still saved and that's scriptural
[26:34] the bible says they're under the throne
[26:36] in heaven they're not in hell they're in
[26:38] heaven and they're crying out how long o
[26:41] lord holy and true dost thou not avenge
[26:43] our blood upon those that dwell upon the
[26:45] earth and then the lord graciously
[26:47] answers back and says more brother need
[26:49] to fulfill the number of martyrs and of
[26:52] course we know that to be the remaining
[26:54] jews that need to die for their faith in
[26:56] order for the blood curse that israel
[26:58] put upon themselves at jesus cross to be
[27:00] fulfilled and then brother ram taught us
[27:02] in the church age book that these jews
[27:04] get their white robes at the great white
[27:05] throne judgment so based upon all this
[27:07] bible truth in bible revelation the jews
[27:10] have to be foolish virgin they're not
[27:12] born again because they deny christ but
[27:14] they are saved because they're virgin to
[27:16] all that they believe they're doing all
[27:18] the commands under the mosaic law and
[27:21] this is scriptural it's a scriptural
[27:22] principle that god will honor all of his
[27:25] previous covenants you find that in
[27:27] leviticus 26 verses 41 and 42 god
[27:30] promised israel that if they're
[27:32] scattered he would remember the covenant
[27:34] of abraham now that's amazing jews that
[27:36] are under the most recent covenant
[27:38] mosaic if they're disobedient to that
[27:40] one god will still honor his previous
[27:42] covenants
[27:43] so according to the thus saith the lord
[27:45] revelation god gave to brother branham
[27:46] regarding the seven seals if you look at
[27:48] the fifth seal the blinded jews who were
[27:51] faithful to the testimony of the word of
[27:53] god will be saved they did not have the
[27:55] testimony of jesus christ so you have to
[27:58] read revelation chapter 1 and revelation
[28:00] chapter 5 and you'll see how john
[28:01] differentiated between the testimony of
[28:03] jesus christ new testament testimony and
[28:06] the testimony of the word of god which
[28:07] was the old testament testimony and so
[28:09] we see god in his loving gracious heart
[28:12] he's able to save the blinded jews of
[28:14] the new testament and give them a place
[28:16] in heaven under the altar in the sixth
[28:18] dimension and then promise them white
[28:20] robes at the great white throne judgment
[28:23] so the blinded jews will not be sitting
[28:25] on the throne with christ because they
[28:26] were blinded to christ during their
[28:27] lifetime but jesus in his mercy will
[28:30] give them white robes because they were
[28:31] faithful to the word of god that they
[28:33] knew
[28:38] let's go quick through the prophets
[28:40] after jesus
[28:41] so when i first came to this message i
[28:43] did not know that there's prophets after
[28:44] jesus
[28:45] but it's clearly supported in the bible
[28:48] there's a really good scripture that i
[28:50] think we all hear as beware of false
[28:52] prophets clearly states in the new
[28:55] testament there are false prophets that
[28:56] we should be aware of and they're saying
[28:58] there's prophets then there has to be a
[29:00] true prophet too exactly great point
[29:02] brother in ephesians 4
[29:04] verses 8 through 16 the bible says jesus
[29:06] when he ascended to heaven he sent down
[29:08] gifts and these gifts would bring the
[29:11] church to maturity to completion to a
[29:14] unity of faith and one of those gifts is
[29:16] a prophet so that's a great point
[29:18] there's going to be a lot of false
[29:19] prophets trying to imitate the true
[29:22] prophets and we're so thankful we have
[29:24] the fivefold ministry gifts apostle
[29:27] prophet teacher pastor evangelist jesus
[29:30] christ then established the gift of a
[29:32] prophet he gave gifts unto men and
[29:35] they're never taken away in the rest of
[29:37] the scripture and then 30 years after
[29:39] jesus went to heaven and sent these
[29:41] gifts jesus spirit had paul write the
[29:45] bible and ordain the gifts when he wrote
[29:47] the letter to the ephesians and the
[29:49] letter to the corinthians
[29:51] and this fulfills what jesus said in
[29:53] john 16 verse 13 the holy ghost will
[29:55] tell you things to come how is the holy
[29:57] ghost going to tell us things to come
[29:59] unless there's a prophet to tell us that
[30:01] and that lines up with amos 3 verse 7
[30:03] surely the lord god will do nothing but
[30:05] he reveals his secret unto his servants
[30:07] the prophets there's also in revelations
[30:10] where jesus has the seven stars in his
[30:12] hand which represents the seven prophets
[30:14] the seven messengers in each church age
[30:17] and we already have our seventh one
[30:18] which is brother branham
[30:20] and he already died and passed away and
[30:22] we're still living through his ministry
[30:23] and his message very good seven eyes
[30:26] represent seven seers in the bible
[30:28] prophets are called seers so we can
[30:30] clearly see how paul and brother branham
[30:32] were genuine prophets and so that means
[30:34] the other five iranius martin columba
[30:38] luther wesley
[30:40] the other five must have had prophetic
[30:42] gifts as well now of course we need to
[30:44] do more research on them but they
[30:45] clearly were stars in the hand of jesus
[30:48] and they're also called jesus's eyes
[30:51] according to revelation 5 6
[30:53] so that understanding of the prophetic
[30:55] times they were living in and able to
[30:57] identify the word of god for their age
[30:59] preach it and then that word was spread
[31:01] out to the rest of their generation or
[31:03] their church age another point is that
[31:05] there are also many prophets too not
[31:08] major prophets like the seven messengers
[31:10] but also the many prophets a good
[31:12] example that is paul and agabus we can
[31:15] clearly see how paul was a prophet paul
[31:17] prophesied of perilous times in second
[31:19] timothy 3 1 the times when the church
[31:21] would not endure sound doctrine in
[31:23] second timothy 4 3 the rapture in first
[31:26] thessalonians chapter 4 the falling away
[31:28] the church before the antichrist in
[31:30] second thessalonians 2 verse 3 no doubt
[31:32] a major prophet wrote most of the new
[31:34] testament and said all men would be
[31:37] judged by his gospel so that's a major
[31:39] prophet you can't add one word or take
[31:42] one word away from paul but then you
[31:44] have agabus who no doubt was a mighty
[31:46] man of god but we'd call him a minor
[31:48] prophet there's two examples where
[31:50] agaves foretold the future acts 11 28 he
[31:53] foretold the great dearth or famine that
[31:55] was to come upon the land and that
[31:57] prepared the saints to gather up food
[31:59] and send it to the saints who had need
[32:01] it was thus saith the lord and it came
[32:03] to pass second he told paul in acts 21
[32:06] verse 10 that paul would be delivered to
[32:08] the gentiles now of course paul knew
[32:10] that but god used agabus to give another
[32:13] word because in the mouth of two or
[32:14] three witnesses let every word be
[32:15] established and agabus thus saith the
[32:18] lord came to pass
[32:19] yeah so as we're showing there's lots of
[32:21] examples of prophets after jesus we
[32:24] showed paul was a prophet agabus was a
[32:26] prophet now let's look at a few more
[32:28] saint john the divine was a prophet 60
[32:31] years after jesus ascended to heaven
[32:33] jesus christ by the holy ghost visited
[32:35] john john saw him in his supreme deity
[32:38] as revelation chapter 1 records and he
[32:40] went on to write 22 chapters of prophecy
[32:43] some of which have come to pass but not
[32:44] all so clearly saint john was a prophet
[32:47] and as another vindication john was with
[32:49] peter and james on mount transfiguration
[32:51] and saw the vision of jesus moses and
[32:54] elijah so again prophets see visions
[32:56] they foretell the future peter's another
[32:59] example he saw mount transfiguration he
[33:01] also saw the vision in acts 10
[33:03] of the sheep coming down with beasts and
[33:05] god said do not call unclean what i've
[33:08] cleansed
[33:09] and then in second peter chapter three
[33:11] he prophesied of scoffers in the last
[33:12] days and he also prophesied of the day
[33:15] of the lord coming with fervent heat now
[33:17] it might help our listeners too to hear
[33:19] a more recent example of prophecy before
[33:23] we get into brother branham's prophetic
[33:25] ministry in 2011 i'd already been
[33:27] pastoring here in akron for five years
[33:30] but we were at some special meetings in
[33:32] napoleon ohio they were highly anointed
[33:34] meetings god was healing people setting
[33:37] them free delivering them but after the
[33:39] meetings a pastor whose name i'm not
[33:41] going to mention out of respect because
[33:42] i haven't asked him if i have his
[33:44] permission to share this came up and
[33:45] told me the holy ghost told me numerous
[33:48] well-known message preachers are going
[33:50] to die in 2012.
[33:52] now of course i was shocked to hear that
[33:54] very rarely do we get a prophecy or thus
[33:56] saith the lord whether it's in church or
[33:59] between others and that's fine because
[34:00] we shouldn't be trying to impersonate
[34:02] them and try to make ourselves profits
[34:04] but this is one time i can definitely
[34:06] say that god gave us a genuine prophecy
[34:09] in those meetings in 2011 and sure
[34:11] enough as 2012 came three of the most
[34:14] well-known preachers around the message
[34:16] passed away in that year and then there
[34:18] were numerous other ministers that
[34:20] passed away during that year but it was
[34:22] god showing us that the gift of prophecy
[34:24] this case would be a gift of minor
[34:26] prophecy we're still in operation we've
[34:29] had a few dreams that were prophetic in
[34:31] nature over the years and two of them i
[34:33] can think of now were warnings and seem
[34:35] to be prophetic the first one is a dream
[34:38] i had about a friend who was at the time
[34:40] in the message believing everything but
[34:42] i dream about him and he was playing
[34:44] tennis in all pink it was a skin tight
[34:48] very feminine type of tennis outfit and
[34:51] in my dream i saw his wife longing to be
[34:54] like him standing at a fence surrounding
[34:56] the tennis court just staring at him
[34:58] well i went and shared this with the
[35:00] brother and he kind of brushed it off it
[35:02] didn't mean anything to him a number of
[35:04] years later this couple left the message
[35:06] and we were still friends on social
[35:08] media and they put up a post of both of
[35:10] them playing tennis and the brother had
[35:12] his shirt off which we believe is a very
[35:14] immodest thing to do because he was a
[35:16] pretty muscular brother and that might
[35:17] cause sisters to lust after him but then
[35:19] his wife of course had shorts on a tight
[35:22] tennis outfit in a very seductive outfit
[35:25] and so to me it appears my dream was
[35:27] prophetic because it gave the brother a
[35:29] warning that if he didn't live closer to
[35:31] the lord he would fall away from the
[35:33] truth of the gospel and that came to
[35:35] pass
[35:36] second my wife had another dream about a
[35:38] warning which she gave to his sister in
[35:40] the dream the sister had fallen away
[35:42] from the faith and was wearing pants
[35:44] when my wife was burdened she went to
[35:45] the sister and shared it the sister
[35:48] laughed it off which was a very sad
[35:50] thing and then a couple years later the
[35:52] sister had fallen away she left the
[35:54] message and has now worn pants for
[35:56] probably 15 or 20 years
[35:58] so again this dream seemed very
[35:59] prophetic in nature as well those are
[36:02] just two humble examples but any holy
[36:04] ghost-filled christian or any christian
[36:05] in general who respects the supernatural
[36:07] knows that god still prophesies today
[36:10] now there's no major prophet today
[36:11] because brother branham went off the
[36:13] scene 56 years ago in 1965 but we still
[36:16] have minor gifts of prophecy and that
[36:18] lines up with the scripture as well from
[36:20] first corinthians 12 where there's a
[36:22] gift of prophecy in the church still
[36:24] what do you think about some of these
[36:26] churches like bethel and hillsongs
[36:28] saying or teaching their people you can
[36:30] prophesy this over your life what do you
[36:32] think about that that's a great question
[36:34] but it seems like they're taking an old
[36:35] testament idea about schools of the
[36:37] prophets because there were school of
[36:38] the prophets in the old testament
[36:40] but from what i've seen on the youtube
[36:42] videos it seems they're trying to
[36:43] manufacture prophecies and of course if
[36:45] you look at all their doctrine some of
[36:47] it might be true but a lot of it
[36:49] contains leaven or heresies and that
[36:52] reminds us of balaam who who did have
[36:54] genuine prophecies that came to pass but
[36:56] in his doctrine he taught fornication
[36:58] and idolatry and therefore was called a
[37:01] false prophet so again that lines up
[37:02] with what you said about jesus jesus
[37:04] said many false prophets will come well
[37:06] here here's schools of many people
[37:08] claiming to be prophets but they have no
[37:10] real bible vindication of it what amazes
[37:13] me is that they're teaching people how
[37:15] to prophesy and the bible clearly states
[37:17] not everyone is a prophet
[37:19] yeah paul said do all prophesy do all of
[37:21] gifts of healings do all speak with
[37:23] tongues and the sad part is or their
[37:25] schools making a lot of money off these
[37:26] people that are that are being taught by
[37:28] man to prophesy but the bible clearly
[37:31] says a prophet is born
[37:33] a prophet is not taught how to be a
[37:34] prophet like god told jeremiah before
[37:37] you were born i ordained you a prophet
[37:39] so this shows a denominational spirit is
[37:42] working in that movement trying to
[37:43] create man-made prophets rather than god
[37:46] sent prophets these modern so-called
[37:48] prophets from bethel or hillsong they
[37:50] generally prophesy about revivals in
[37:52] foreign countries i've heard they
[37:54] prophesy over people's lives and who
[37:56] knows if they ever come to pass it's
[37:57] likely they don't but jesus said by
[37:59] their fruits you'll know them and what
[38:01] do these people teach they teach the
[38:02] prosperity gospel god wants you rich and
[38:05] always wants you healthy and wealthy and
[38:07] some of them like the bethel people they
[38:09] do grave soaking so they lay on the
[38:11] graves of dead believers
[38:13] thinking that the anointing that was on
[38:15] the dead person is going to come on them
[38:17] and of course they have no modesty
[38:18] standards the women cut their hair they
[38:20] wear makeup they cross dress they allow
[38:23] women preachers which the bible forbids
[38:25] in first timothy chapter 2 and so again
[38:27] you look at their fruits jesus said you
[38:29] would know the false prophets by their
[38:31] fruits their corrupt fruits so it's
[38:33] likely many of these bethel or hillsong
[38:36] so-called prophets are not prophets
[38:38] although some of them could be minor
[38:39] prophets they could have genuine gifts
[38:41] of prophecy as again i haven't listened
[38:43] to every single one of their prophecies
[38:45] but if they teach false doctrine even
[38:47] after prophesying correctly then we
[38:49] would call them false prophets
[38:51] some people point to hebrews chapter 1
[38:53] verses 1 and 2 and say there's no more
[38:55] prophets the bible says god spake in
[38:58] times past unto the fathers by prophets
[39:00] but hath in these last days spoken unto
[39:02] us by his son so some people say god is
[39:05] not speaking by prophets anymore and
[39:07] they would say we wouldn't need a
[39:08] william branham today or we wouldn't
[39:10] need any prophecy gifts today of course
[39:12] this is a huge misunderstanding it's a
[39:14] huge false doctrine that we would not
[39:16] need prophets anymore now the main proof
[39:19] that they misinterpreted this text is
[39:21] because this book of hebrews was written
[39:23] between 60 a d and 80 a.d
[39:26] if this meant there was no more prophets
[39:28] then why did jesus go to john and give
[39:30] him the entire book of revelation in 80
[39:32] 90 or 80 95 or some people say 100 a.d
[39:35] so it doesn't mean that that's proof
[39:37] right there that all this is saying is
[39:39] that god used jesus christ to fulfill
[39:42] all the prophets and also to fulfill the
[39:45] law and to preach that the kingdom of
[39:47] god is at hand and of course the kingdom
[39:48] of god fell on the day of pentecost
[39:50] through the keys that jesus had given to
[39:52] peter and peter opened the door of faith
[39:54] to the jews and the gentiles and the
[39:56] samaritans and then god sent paul to
[39:58] finish the whole council of god and then
[40:01] you throw john in there as well another
[40:03] prophet and jesus was using all of these
[40:05] prophets to speak to his people so again
[40:07] you've got to understand hebrews 1 in
[40:09] the light of the rest of the scripture
[40:11] you had agabus you had paul you had
[40:14] peter john there's four more prophets at
[40:16] least that came after jesus and we can
[40:18] look back through history and see other
[40:20] prophets as well and of course a more
[40:22] modern day prophet brother branham in
[40:24] this day so we're thankful that jesus
[40:26] christ is still alive he's the same
[40:28] yesterday today and forever and we're
[40:30] thankful that the spirit of jesus christ
[40:32] is the spirit of prophecy
[40:38] well let's look at a real prophet
[40:39] brother branno when i first came this
[40:41] message i didn't know who brother
[40:42] branham was or i didn't know there was
[40:44] prophets after jesus and i was really
[40:47] skeptical about brother brown when i
[40:49] first came in but then the more i
[40:50] listened to it the more he pointed back
[40:52] to the bible and to the word of god
[40:55] and it really made me believe that wow
[40:56] this man is a genuine prophet he had
[40:59] miracles signs and wonders and
[41:01] everything he did pointed back to the
[41:03] bible and that's where a lot of people
[41:05] that knew brother branham or like
[41:07] churches that didn't like brother brown
[41:09] because they didn't line up with their
[41:12] thinking or their doctrines brother
[41:14] braham said a lot of things that were
[41:16] contradictory to
[41:18] a lot of teachings from the churches
[41:20] like serpent seed and like water baptism
[41:23] but when you look in the scripture you
[41:25] find out that he was telling the truth
[41:27] if you do your homework and if you
[41:28] really want to know the truth and you
[41:30] you go through it
[41:32] then you'll find the truth that he was
[41:33] he was telling he wasn't lying he was
[41:36] telling the truth on the word of god and
[41:38] restoring it back to the original yeah
[41:40] that's a great testimony brother that's
[41:41] a lot like mine too when i first came
[41:43] the message i just was introduced to
[41:45] bible studies and i could see all these
[41:46] revelations were right serpent seed
[41:48] godhead water baptism non-eternal hell
[41:51] the seven church ages all these things
[41:53] and we finally asked where'd you get it
[41:55] from and they said william branham well
[41:57] like any person we went online that was
[41:59] back in 2001 or 2002 well most of the
[42:01] sites were against brother branham they
[42:03] still are but as brother amen said when
[42:06] you seek god with all your heart soul
[42:08] mind and strength holy ghost will guide
[42:10] you into all truth as we started testing
[42:12] the things brother branham said we found
[42:14] so many of them back in the scripture
[42:16] now what i mean by that is not every
[42:18] word on his tapes is thus saith the lord
[42:20] there are some human mistakes he made
[42:21] there's some human thoughts and opinions
[42:23] that time has showed we're not right but
[42:25] those things were not spoken in the name
[42:27] of the lord so brother brahm is still a
[42:29] true prophet of god but what vindicated
[42:31] him were numerous things but especially
[42:34] that thus saith the lords that came to
[42:35] pass and all that thus saith the lord
[42:37] bible teachings that he gave us you know
[42:40] in my 2021 book i listed at least 30
[42:42] thus saith the lord statements from
[42:44] brother branham in that final chapter to
[42:46] try to prove to everyone afresh that god
[42:48] had sent a prophet to this generation
[42:50] and we should listen to brother branham
[42:52] as he points us back to the word of god
[42:55] six thus saith the lords were about the
[42:57] 12 new testament mysteries in other
[42:59] words 12 of those new testament
[43:00] mysteries were spoken with thus saith
[43:02] the lord brother braham gave us eight
[43:04] doctrines spoken with us saith the lord
[43:06] brother branham has three prophecies
[43:08] that were thus saith the lord that are
[43:09] in the process of coming to pass first
[43:12] there will be no greater gift to the
[43:13] gentiles than brother branham's gift
[43:16] second the immoral condition of the
[43:18] united states churches and third there
[43:20] will be no return to the apostolic
[43:22] ministry from denominations they will
[43:24] not repent and return back to the word
[43:26] of god and then we listed 11 future
[43:28] prophecies brother brahm gave us about
[43:30] united states rome russia vatican mark
[43:33] of the beast and advances in science
[43:36] some people forget about prophecies that
[43:38] were related to healing or perhaps
[43:40] passing away in 1955 brother branham
[43:42] told florence humes that she would be
[43:45] healed of her tuberculosis in the name
[43:47] of jesus christ he condemned satan and
[43:49] it's on tape and you can hear it he said
[43:51] to prove to you that this is right go
[43:52] away yourself the next two mondays and
[43:54] you'll gain weight well she did that was
[43:56] a prophecy of healing in the name of
[43:58] jesus christ well she went and did that
[44:00] she already had three kids she ended up
[44:01] having five more she had 25
[44:03] grandchildren over 40
[44:05] great-grandchildren by god's grace i had
[44:07] a chance to meet her around 2010 about
[44:09] five years before she passed away second
[44:12] in 1958 brother branham gave marilyn
[44:14] hickey a prophecy that she would have a
[44:16] baby when she couldn't have any brother
[44:18] ram didn't even know that the holy ghost
[44:20] had to show him a vision that she
[44:21] couldn't have children and she was 26
[44:23] years old and said thus saith the lord
[44:25] if you'll believe you're going to have a
[44:27] baby well she had to believe she had to
[44:28] believe 10 years but then she finally
[44:30] had a child so god was faithful another
[44:33] thus saith the lord spoken and came to
[44:35] pass a third one was where brother
[44:37] bannon prophesied of sister shakarian's
[44:39] death i know accusers of brother branham
[44:41] don't really think that's a prophecy but
[44:42] it's actually scriptural in second kings
[44:44] chapter 1 verses 1 through 17 elijah
[44:47] foretold king ahaziah's death and that's
[44:50] what brother branham did in 1965 he
[44:53] foretold florence shakarian's death now
[44:56] the reason that was so powerful was
[44:57] because all the full gospel pentecostal
[44:59] people were prophesying of her healing
[45:02] but brother branham saw a vision of her
[45:03] passing so brother branham had to stand
[45:05] against all these false prophecies and
[45:08] proclaim the true prophecy and it came
[45:10] to pass so again we see brother branham
[45:11] had the spirit of elijah brother brandon
[45:13] predicted the future for healings and
[45:15] also answers to people's prayers he gave
[45:17] us an interpretation of the bible with
[45:19] us saith the lord and at times he had to
[45:21] predict people's passing as well all
[45:23] these are proofs that god sent brother
[45:25] branham as a genuine prophet to this day
[45:27] and a great scripture that validates it
[45:28] is revelation 10 verse 7 in the days of
[45:31] the seventh angel when he shall begin to
[45:32] sound the mystery of god should be
[45:34] finished this seventh angel has to be a
[45:36] gentile prophet because when he receives
[45:38] the open book from jesus christ the
[45:40] bible says in the next verses in verses
[45:42] 8 through 11 in revelation 10 that john
[45:46] or the bride or the church must eat
[45:48] those revelations and then go prophesy
[45:50] again to every people nation kindred
[45:52] tongue in other words god sends his open
[45:54] book revelation to a gentile prophet who
[45:57] preaches it on the earth and then the
[45:59] bride of jesus christ receives that and
[46:01] finishes the great commission and takes
[46:04] it to all the gentile nations just as
[46:05] jesus said in matthew 24 the gospel must
[46:07] be preached to every nation and then the
[46:10] end will come and also fulfills luke 21
[46:12] verse 24 where jesus said jerusalem will
[46:15] be trodden under until the times of the
[46:17] gentiles are finished so we can clearly
[46:19] see there has to be a gentile prophet
[46:21] who finishes the mystery of god brother
[46:22] branham finished all the mysteries of
[46:24] god that are called mysteries in the
[46:25] bible he's left the scene he's done his
[46:27] part and now we're like john we're
[46:29] eating those revelations and prophesying
[46:31] them again until the times of the
[46:32] gentiles is fulfilled
[46:34] this is a video that we that you saw
[46:36] that church one time where this guy was
[46:39] saying i am elijah son from god you can
[46:42] see that there are people
[46:44] that are looking for the coming of
[46:45] elijah but they don't know that he
[46:47] already came yeah brother that was tony
[46:49] palmer now was very sad he passed away
[46:51] in 2014 just a few months after he said
[46:55] he had the spirit of elijah upon it so
[46:57] again here's an example of people
[46:58] claiming to be prophets and i even put
[47:00] this in my 2021 book that numerous
[47:03] people have claimed to have the spirit
[47:04] of elijah but if we just look at that
[47:05] tony palmer example and brother branham
[47:08] both claim to have the spirit of elijah
[47:10] but which one really had the spirit of
[47:11] elijah tony palmer was saying he had the
[47:13] spirit of elijah to unite all the word
[47:15] of faith and denominational churches
[47:17] back with the mother harlot rome so
[47:20] clearly by his fruits and by his
[47:22] association with all those wolves and
[47:24] false prophets we knew he was not
[47:27] telling the truth while we are so sad
[47:29] for his family and we pray for them that
[47:31] they'll be saved we can recognize he did
[47:33] not have the true spirit of elijah on
[47:35] the other hand brother branham had
[47:37] numerous thus saith the lords for
[47:38] healing that came to pass we see three
[47:40] prophecies that are coming to pass today
[47:43] and of course there's probably hundreds
[47:44] more healing prophecies that came to
[47:46] pass than what we're aware of but then
[47:48] we can see all of us thus saith the lord
[47:49] from the bible on doctrine being right
[47:52] and we can see how he finished the
[47:53] mysteries of god we can see how he had
[47:55] the spirit of elijah he foretold things
[47:57] in the name of the lord he was a man of
[47:59] the wilderness like elijah was he
[48:00] preached against immoral women like
[48:02] elijah did against jezebel and john the
[48:04] baptist did against herodias so brother
[48:06] branham had all the attributes of the
[48:08] spirit of elijah plus he had the
[48:10] supernatural vindication of thus saith
[48:12] the lord with prophecies coming to pass
[48:14] and his major bible doctrines being
[48:16] vindicated by thus saith the lord and
[48:18] then being able to be found right in the
[48:20] bible yeah it was in 1954 when brother
[48:23] branham said quote and then finally she
[48:25] the roman catholic church was the mother
[48:28] of harlots she gave birth unto churches
[48:30] after her because they couldn't have
[48:31] been boys they had to be girls and we
[48:34] find out that the protestant church is
[48:35] the product of the catholic church by
[48:37] searching the scriptures and looking at
[48:39] your history book we see that the
[48:41] protestant church is the product and the
[48:43] protestant can't holler at the catholic
[48:45] because the both says they are harlots
[48:47] and that's flat but that's thus
[48:50] saith the lord end quote so again tony
[48:53] palmer could not be anointed with the
[48:54] spirit of elijah because the spirit of
[48:56] elijah had already come upon brother
[48:58] branham with thus saith the lord to warn
[49:00] the people not to unite with the roman
[49:03] catholic church and the protestant
[49:04] churches that hold the roman catholic
[49:06] church doctrine like the trinity
[49:08] doctrine and that was just like elijah
[49:10] in the days of ahab and jezebel elijah
[49:13] preached against jezebel just like
[49:14] brother branham preached against the
[49:16] roman catholic church the roman catholic
[49:18] church is the modern day jezebel
[49:20] according to revelation 2 verse 20 so
[49:22] it's a clear scriptural type again
[49:24] showing how the spirit of elijah was
[49:26] upon brother branham in truth
[49:33] so in summary it's been a great podcast
[49:35] here hope you enjoyed learning about the
[49:37] four heart reactions to the gospel and
[49:40] also it's clear there were more prophets
[49:42] to come after jesus christ four examples
