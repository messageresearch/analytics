about him this evening with the help of god or two or more gathered in his name there isn't a myth i preached two or three and i preached five or six hundred maybe more than that overseas large numbers even in africa even larger very large congregation i've seen them dance in the spirit while they're singing the uh congregational songs with babies on the front dancing in the aisles you know and when you're that kind of atmosphere when i'm in africa i'm an african when i'm in the philippines i'm a filipino but the trouble is sometimes when i'm in america i become an american again you know you know i've been to canada several times i know we thought canada and canadians were starchy but i found out there's quite a few filipinos where i go so they're not so starchy in canada amen praise the lord so uh i've got some things to say and i got some things to say tomorrow i got some things to say that might be very interesting to you and it's about some history of a man 300 years ago and you'd be interested in this i believe so uh by the help of god this morning would just like to pray first heavenly father as we are going to open your word look into the pages of your word and lord that you might speak to us in a special way and give us a clear utterance of speech anoint these words give me the right words to speak lord as your prophet said if if we can just say the right words i pray lord they would be pleasing to you and i can just say many times lord i know you you liked it when i would say something i pray that you like it tonight and i can feel your presence and those that are here would be blessed in a special way for you give you all the praise and the honor for we ask it in jesus name amen first turn in your bibles i wasn't going to read this but i think i need to micah chapter 7 and i want to read a couple verses this is not my text tonight but i want to read this first in verse 18 and 19 micah chapter 7 verse 18 and 19. i have this in my notes so a beautiful couple of beautiful verses here because if you've experienced this you know peter said freely i have freely i give it you know who is a god like unto thee that pardoneth iniquity and passes by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage he retaineth not his anger forever because he delighteth in mercy amen he will turn again he will have compassion upon us he will subdue our iniquities and that will cast all their sins into the depths of the sea don't you like that all right now turn with me to jude chapter one and we're going to be again reading in uh verse 17. i want to read this we're talking about it's going to be about some compassion and different things tonight but maybe in a little different way you know we're going to talk about casting out your net i'll go i might read that tonight i might read it again in the morning not very many here but now listen but remember ye the words which were spoken before the apostles of our lord jesus christ how that they told you there should be mockers in the last time who should walk after their own ungodly lust these be they who separate themselves central having not the spirit but ye beloved building up yourselves on your most holy faith praying in the holy ghost keep yourselves in the love of god looking for the mercy of our lord jesus christ unto eternal life now listen enough some have compassion making a difference and others save with fear pulling them out of the fire hating even the garment spotted by the flesh now unto him but is able to keep you from falling into birth sent you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy to the only wise god our savior be glory and majesty dominion and power both now and forever amen now i want to read this verse here again verse 21 uh keep yourselves in the love of god looking for the mercy of our lord jesus christ unto eternal life and some having compassion making a difference you may be seated may god add his blessings to the reading of his word i want to just title this having compassion making a difference now first of all the word difference here you think well making a difference it is to discern its discernment it's to make a distinction you know now i have a gift you all have gifts it's just not the preacher it's just not the five-fold ministry everybody has a part you know so we all have brother brother jesse i have and we have different fields that we work in but here we're talking about the love of god first we talk about the love now we're not talking about filio between a man and a woman like brother banner said one time you know if if a man insulted your wife you'd like to kill me you know that's filial love i guess i'd be the same way now i have to admit if one was doing wife to my harm i'm not so sure what i would do you know i remember i i can remember when i when i got out of the service when i was in the service i thought i was the toughest guy in the world when i was in the server out of basic training and i was stationed in korea i mean i thought i was a tough guy i thought i could just beat any and there was this one big black off-duty mp and next thing i know i was on the ground i was seeing star he had knocked me up uppercut me and flipped me backwards and you know my buddy said to me let's get out of here we weren't stupid you know they're bigger than we are but you know what the devil may look big sometimes but if we have the strength of the armor of god we will not back down the love of god is agapeo it's affection but like i like this word it's benevolence you know what benevolence is it's the disposition to do good and act of kindness of a generous gift like peter said freely i give i've received freely i give making the difference some having making a difference you know that's what i i want to do is make a difference wherever i go i want to make a difference i i can't win everybody it's not my calling and you know we all have a field we all should be in the field working but here's compassion it's here to have and show mercy or pity know brother man said i know a friend that will stick closer than no matter no matter if i haven't got a penny whatever i got a friend that just stick closer than a brother he gave his life for me he died amen he went into the grave and said i am he that was dead i'm alive forevermore and have the keys of death and hell don't you like that you know why i had the keys he went into the middle of earth and stripped the devil of the king amen scripture you know i like to put it this way what power that the devil has is what you give him you know he's just like an old guy that got false teeth he gum you to death because he ain't got no teeth he lost his stinger at calvary he ain't got no power the power he has was what we let him have amen amen see godly love is to make a difference to judge and make a distinction and you know we've got one of the not god we seem like we've got one of the awfulest funny times that we ever went through now you i got my opinions on the situation you know i have my opinions and my opinions may not mean a lot but you're going to hear some opinions in the morning i'll save them for in the morning you'll go right along with what i'm going to preach okay now now compassion torah media let me turn let's just read this in hebrews hebrews the fifth chapter it's talking about our lord uh and uh verse one we'll start with verse one now uh for every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men and things pertaining to god that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins who can have compassion on the ignorant and on them that are out of the way for that he himself also accompassed with infirmity and by reason hereof he all asked for the people so also for himself to offer for sins and no man taketh this honor upon himself but he that is called of god as was aaron so also christ glorified not himself to be made a high priest but he said unto him thou art my son today i have begotten him and he said to now thou art a priest forever after the order of melchizedek who in the days of his flesh when he had offered up prayers and suffocation with strong crying and tears in him that was able to save him from death was heard in that he feared though he were a son yet he learned he obedient by the things he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation unto them that obey him call of god as a high priest after the order of mecca dick now listen the word compassion changes just a little bit here that he has compassion and i hope i could have the same compassion the bible said the lord is merciful gracious slow to angle anger plenteous in mercy compassion here is to be affected moderately or in due measure to preserve moderation in the past especially in anger or grief one who is not unduly disturbed by the heirs and faults and sin of others but bears them gently ignorant not knowing or understanding or out of the wrangle or out of the way you know i said there's a couple quotes that just struck me brother man said it it changes kind of my attitude you know you can backslide and have the holy ghost brother brad said in the friends token ever was healed if you live long enough you're going to get sick again if you one time take that token you had it forever grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby you're sealed unto the day of your redemption not till the next revival you wasn't sealed you got emotionally worked up but you are dead and your life is hitting god through christ and you're sealed by the holy ghost if you are once baptized into the holy spirit now you can backslide that it's true but you can't get away from that ceiling you were sealed into it now listen you know this changed my mind you know uh oh my i got a bunch of stuff wrote down we're not we're just a few people here ah here you know that's okay i'm gonna i'm gonna i have it i might have left it back back at the uh uh motel hotel but you know brother branham said you could be completely insane completely insane and still have the holy ghost that has not got anything to do with your soul i got the quote i don't know what ever happened to it it's disappeared oh yeah many times you can see a person maybe of insanity they may not yet be that they may not get converted filled with the holy ghost yet totally insane that's right but has no one that has nothing to do with the soul it's a torment something that torments i'm going to read again now they may yet they may yet converted they may yet converted filled with the holy ghost they'd be converted and filled with the holy ghost but totally insane i used to think a man's totally insane how could he have the holy ghost but it happens it happens especially in this hour i remember reading one time there was a man called dr mercola in fact uh my wife was having uh thyroid problems going to the doctor and this guy's a renegade you know he he he told about uh the armor you know used to treat thyroid by armor you know what that is pigsty relay you know and uh remember the armor man brother ram talked about you know i must that says something for it don't it and i remember and i told my wife about it and she got that and she got all straightened out you know instead of taking the synthetic you know and all that but you know but he said one time there was like i forget like 90 of the american people have some form of mental illness depression whatever it is but we're in that hour we're in that hour evil men and seduce yourself works wax worse worse you know now now my notes are all out of whack but that's okay well i got some things to say yet you know i think can you think i may have told this story before but i'm gonna tell some stories here because having compassion and some making a difference yes and you know what other men said you could you can be you could be led in the spirit and you don't even know it you don't know it you just go ahead i mean you can be feeling down as can be and you haven't heard from god being led to the spirit but god knows and god will take you to the right place that's right you know i think so many people that i have met in fact there was a sister sent my wife uh a video of a scientist talking about implants you know those things you know and she said could that be that brain scientist that you flew with that time i flew with the brain scientist talked to him for about six hours told him everything that a hillbilly in kentucky told me you know he said i'm a baptist i'm not an atheist and i looked at that picture of that guy that guy was a stocky guy but he got converted it looked just it looked like him his voice sounded like it of a mind i believe it was him through a witness on a delta flight the hit stop was japan mine was the philippines you know you don't know what god is doing you don't know how god is leading and you see people so down and out and you feel like there's no hope there's no help you better be careful there's always a hope and there's always a way we throw people out the door we push them off the bus so to speak like there's no hope they're so steeped in sin they did this and did that what about the woman at the well had all them husbands what about rahab the harlot think about rahab the harlot she was converted and put out that scarlet thread and everybody got in that house and come from rehab you know rehab married salmon and salmon black got boaz and boaz begat david then came the line of jesus christ don't count nobody out think about david when he committed adultery and there come a man named solomon which said was the wisest man at that time don't count nobody else i know we're in the arab grace but still don't count nobody out god has corrected me he has corrected me many times i have a i i travel i don't know if i can say this or not about getting in trouble i'll try to not name names for to to protect that guilty you know i say that many times but you know i found out that many times i remember i remember flying to the philippines and i had just met brother clement orenz and he said greet brother jesse for me [Music] i was getting ready to leave and i visited his church and meeting in a motel 2005 i believe it was and i was telling about the problems i was facing when i got there because i had come against a certain group of men an organization that under the name of the message that picked up every kind of fly by night there was and there was over there causing problems in and i was telling him about it and and uh and i i couldn't believe it after this so i had never met him but there brother clem gave me a hundred dollar mission offering and i didn't even know the man we become very we're very close that's i could say that's my best friend there's no doubt about it but uh we've traveled many miles and the brother needs prayer for his body you know he's homesick for the philippines because he's got a filipino wife there and she's stuck by colby 19. we're going to talk about that and she can't get here you know but paper everything's hung up nobody can come he can't go nobody can't come they can only converse you know he's loved sick you would be too yeah yeah she would be too but see and i remember i told this many times i've told it many times but not many times but i i that's what this was not what i was going to say but just come out yeah i don't know and leading this way and and when i got believe it or not on the airplane on that trip over there i was so troubled in here i sat down by two men i got me an exit door seated and i said i called my wife oh i'm so glad there was first come first serve now you gotta pay for it and i got me an exit door seat and and i sat down and here come these two big guys sat down next to me and i was overheating i'm trying to catch what i'm hearing you know all the noise of the plane and i heard somebody say you can buy all your duty-free alcohol you know on here and then i heard them talking about the message you know and so i made a mistake i pulled out my book and that was it man we were in a turmoil the rest of the trip i won't go into detail i will not go into detail what i heard but i heard things like no man ought to hear and when i got there my brothers were waiting for me to confront me about what i've been preaching against this group and so and when i got to baguio city one brother was with me i said i'm getting out of here my i'm getting my i was there of my closest companion and i separated from him separated from him making his distinction now i made a distinction i had to and i separated for two or three trips and one time on my way to bag on my way we were headed up to mountains to visit a brother to dedicate his house and his ministry and my closest companion i won't even mention his name called the driver and symbol gone said well brother keith come and have coffee at the church and i told him no i said will he meet me at a restaurant and have coffee i told him no because i had a dream in that house that that brother came to that house with a certain colored shirt on and finally he said i'm coming to the house he's at when we got back to the house i don't know when it was he came to the house i told the brothers you watch and see when he comes in what color shirt he'll have on and when he got in there he began to weep like a baby he said what have i done what have i done what have i done now you know sometimes you have to make a distinction that's the kind of compassion true compassion is to do the will of god brother baby said elijah when he was on mount carmel with those uh witch doctors what do you want to call them he was doing the will of god when he made fun of him he was that was the will that was compassion i was showing compassion now work closer since 2007 probably than we ever been because we started traveling together in 1993 you know so you know that's to separate make a distinction see that's why the bible said and be not conformed to this world but be you transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god did you ever know what the renewing means you know what it means you know what it is what it is it means it's so easy if i was going to renew this building his room i would take every single thing out of here i'd rip the carpet i'd rip the eye i would rip everything out it well there would be nothing left at all by the renewing of our mind because our mind is a garbage disposal in this hour politics and everything i got now i'm i believe in voting voted for donald trump and i'll vote for him again if you don't vote for him you're a christian you don't vote for him it's a sin he either knows if you're gonna do it but not to tell me it's a sin my brother-in-law told me one time about he said one time about this preacher that was a tv he's got in houston texas got this big thing you know and he said he told me he said harry i love to hear him my brother's dead now in fact he married me and my wife you know he said he said he's oh he's just nothing but positive oh he's so positive i said troy you know it you know he loved cars you know it takes a positive and a negative cable to start that car you're gonna have the negative as well as the positive or you ain't going nowhere that's right you ain't going nowhere that's why i said prove all things hold fast that which is good see hold fast oh that which is good you know somebody told me one time now i i believe in the five-fold ministry and i believe in the tapes you know i believe in the message of the hour i had a supernatural experience yes i believe that but one brother told me one time montreal i know him real good one time but several years ago he wanted to call my daughter and he came and it didn't work out we've been friends ever since even his wife died and married a filipino wife and he said you know sagada if you never if you've ever been to sagada mountain up in the mountain province up in the mountains it's a little village up there and it's a it's a beautiful little village but not there's there's headhunters not too far from it you know and and there's uh europeans that go through that place all the time and i couldn't figure it out for a long time who are these europeans you know can almost tell a german or a swede from an american the way they look the way they dress and talk with a you know foreign you know and uh and so i have had a two-night crusade last trip last april great response wonderful time in the lord and praying for people giving their heart to the lord and the man told me he said what don't you think you ought to play a tape while you're up there i said they're coming to see an ugly american you know you know they'll come to that i'm a show i'm like going to the movies you know you know i mean you wouldn't believe that you'll have a crowd here here here and you see him up in their houses on their porches listening they're everywhere and there's pictures being taken even those europeans was in the meeting too see i said man i i'm up there to preach i'm a preacher of the gospel of jesus christ i can't stop preaching god called me to preach to be instant in season and out of season to reprove and rebuke all along suffering and doctrine i can't help it i've got to preach that's why i'm mad you'll find out tomorrow why i'm mad and why i'm angry you know i had a ticket to leave march 31st i didn't cancel it they canceled it now i've got it in escrow whenever i need it to use and i'm just itching to use that ticket so you know so that's the way it is you know you know we need to prove all things know you don't know like brother branham the little little he called the little ancient woman you know and the plane stopped can you imagine he got off that plane and just started walking he didn't know why he was doing you know he didn't know why he kept walking and that plane there he didn't know why but he kept walking and there she was parson she had been praying how do you know i'm a person because i was praying i got a sick boy in her you know what he had he had a social disease i love this what what humility they begin to pray you know who brother branham asked to pray first their little aunt jemima and when she prayed brother ben talked about man what a prayer but you know it was some time after that he was somewhere and all of a sudden somebody said i don't know what they called him parson person person he looked around that was that boy god had healed him god had saved him god had set him free amen that's the way it is when i was on the plane one time i sat down next to these two boys filipino boys dressed to the hills man they had all kind i mean they they they're called their clothes had to be expensive for the filipinos you know and so they asked i asked him where are you going boys we're going to japan we got a nightclub and i said to myself lord why did you sit me now next to these guys or god will correct you real fast ask me where you been and i began to tell them and i began to witness to them and tell them before i knew it one of those boys was hugging on me and hugging on me wouldn't let go they wanted to hear more and more and more and more sometimes god gets you to play god's leading you and you don't even know you're being led but he's being leading you when i sit next to that brain scientist and we talked about i forget you know he told me he said he he said it was four ordained he believed must have believed in predestination we were for ordained to fly together yeah you know right i'll probably see him again one of these days in another another another world a better world a much better world and can you imagine i probably told these more because that's what i'm trying to say with making a making a distinction making a difference what i can do what i can do i can't be everywhere i can't do everything that's why the laborers are few the harvest is right why are not we in the harvest field yes sir and subongan been there many times sister bernadette now if you knew the church there and the facilities of the church it ain't very good so sister bernadette takes me in and brother clinton i've known her for years being before brother clinton and takes us into his her house and was sitting outside before going to service and she was talking to me and here comes her son talking to me and her mother left because she knew her son wants to say something said i believe i have a call in my life and i'm helping out in the church now i didn't condemn him see he said but my wife's not a believer i didn't say anything and she's roman catholic she was right there i said i talked to him for long i told him i told him about my experience my wife was a believer 12 years before i was i told him all about that trying to build it build his faith so that night my message was about rome in the catholic church a lot of it was and you know the old devil says this you better water it down i never watered it down a bit and when i give the altar call they were lined up and i was praying for these and i couldn't wait because his wife he was at the altar and his wife i took her by the hand would you like to receive jesus christ as your lord and savior and she said yes you know sister bernadette took us into our home the last trip her husband was always offish even when we were in the home and we were having an outdoor meeting and there he was a big smile on his face just as friendly as could be sister god honored sister bernadette i believe because she took us in and not only her daughter-in-law got added and her pop her husband got added to the phone you don't even know you don't know [Applause] you don't know what a difference you can make through discernment just like the the good samaritan you're the man you're the man where did he leave he left jericho you know what jericho the greek means alluring fragrance jericho he was left he left he left jerusalem i mean headed to jericho jerusalem was his place of safety and he was headed to jericho which was an alluring fragrance he was backslid you know and the robbers came and got him and just worked him over it's probably took everything he had here come you know the levites and the priests just passed on by they didn't want to get their hands dirty i don't want that i have preached in the leper colony i have hugged a pastor which has live leprosy whereas if knuckles would burst i've been there i've seen it if god is leading you there is nothing to fear amen but the good samaritan you know what he was half jew half gentile he was looked down upon but he showed mercy he gave him two pens you know what was it just wait now i'll come and make recompense for the rest jesus has been gone 2 000 years but he's coming back again one day and he's going to reward everything that everything every little every little but he's gonna also judge every idol word and everything that you did that you shouldn't do but when love god's mercies are new every morning i saw that picture in the men's restroom and i thought that's a good confirmation you know trying to decide what to preach tonight you know his mercies are new every morning every time i wake up in the morning you know i died and you know where i was at uh september 8th i was in the hospital having nuclear stress tests and so you know because i was having trouble breathing in different things dizzy and uh i went to the doctor he gave me a a physical and took a chest x-ray and he found a seven millimeter nodule on my right lung but he said don't worry about that it's no problem i'll take his word for it but he said i'm gonna give give you i got i can't run anymore i've got bad feet and knees so they give you a nuclear one where they inject this stuff in you and your heart races like you were on the treadmill and so i did that and you know then they took pictures before and after that took a bunch of pictures and they came out with the pictures and they would i think they were being nice he said to me he said now we know men have a different thing on one of their heart places and it showed black like it was uh you know it said uh we're going to take some more pictures and on your stomach you have to go in and think oh man i draw me crazy the third time one after another and you know the thing when it came back there was nothing my wife said god just took it away my breathing is back all right because the prayers of the saints and the prayers of my wife amen i mean i ain't finished i'm not finished when god takes my card out of the file when i'm gone ain't no way no prayer gonna stop it or anything i'll be gone and and i i ain't gonna be so sad about it i you know i don't mind going you know you know i try to make sure my wife be taken care of and everything but when love is projected with the right motive behind it divine grace has to step in divine love is projected in its object sovereign grace steps in and produces what it projected if we can just jesus said the son can do nothing himself but what he sees the father doing and see that's compassion when he walked through the pool of bethesda and you men they were sick i don't know how that mean they were probably really sick people but he walked past all those sick people to get one man why god was leading him to the jesus to that one man and brother branham said he might have had just prostate trouble you know and had it for years but he got in that because when those waters were troubled if you got in that pool you'd be healed but he went for that one man one man that's divine love is projected i think that's what we need to think about you know not what he sees not hears but what he sees the father doing do it that do it the son likewise and if you're a son and daughter of god you need to listen to your father papa god amen amen papa god yes amen you know i like that papa god he my daddy you know god is my father amen i'm begotten of the holy ghost being born again out of a corruptable seed but an incorruptible seed which is the word of god which liveth and endure forever amen amen you cannot confuse human sympathy with godly compassion or you know i i see people i feel sorry for them and you know if i could help i might help them but see god might use me for one thing you for another people don't know what compassion is it's the love is the will of god you cannot exercise that unless god gives it now turn on me i'm going to close but i want to read this i just added that to this message probably back in the in the hotel but i want you i want to read this in luke the fifth chapter this is what i feel you know i've got a message is our labor in vain and i haven't preached it yet but it seems like all we do is bicker and fight disagreements you know that's true sometimes i wonder if is our labor in vain one brother cannot cast his net out with the other brother because i i just don't see it and it came to pass that as the people pat pressed upon him to hear the word of god he stood by the the lake of genocide and he saw two ships standing by the lake but the fishermen were gone out of them and were washing their nets and he entered into one of the ships which was simon's and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land and he sat down and taught the people other now when he had left speaking he said unto simon launch out into the deep and let down your net for a drought and simon answered and said unto master we have toiled all night and have taken nothing nevertheless that thy word i will let down the net but when they had this done they enclosed a great multitude of fishes in their net break and they beckoned unto their partners partners which were in the other ship that they should come and help them and they came and filled both the sheds so they they that they began to sink still there man it was so great because they began to cast their nets together in obedience to what the lord jesus said when simon peter saw it he fell down at jesus this thing depart from me for i am a sinful man o lord for he was astonished and all that were with him as the drought of the fishes what they had taken so was also james and john the sum of zebedee which were partners with simon jesus said in simon fear not from henceforth thou shalt catch men listen that fear not from henceforth thou shalt catch amen amen and when they had brought their ships to land they forsook all and followed him i believe we could just cast their nets out together draw draw draw in the fishes sure we'll get some turtles and snakes and all kinds of things and ugly little things to draw them in there's all kinds of things in the sea all kinds of weird creatures but there's also fish amen there's also fish when they brought the fishes you know the little boy brought his fishes and loaves and jesus began to bless it and the they they were just fishings and loaves until they took their hand over and gave it to jesus and it began to get multiplied because a little boy took his hands off it couldn't be multiplied until his hands went off but what it was when his hands is off it begin to get multiple if we could just take our hands and let god's hands take over but our lord or to god full of compassion gracious long suffering plenteous and mercy and truth compassion might be healing it might be of rebuke precious or the wounds of a friend but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful you ever been rebuked we don't always like it but it you know that's a sweet kind of rebuke you know uh not like an enemy's the kiss of an enemy which is deceitful see love doesn't fear it's waiting on grace perfect love has no fear perfect love casteth out fear he that fear has not been made perfect with love amen amen we could say a whole lot more tonight but we'll save it for tomorrow morning by the help of god amen isn't it good and it good that god has given us the bible i believe god will give us the perfect interpretation of the word with divine vindication you know man i fought against this for years i mean i got whooped i had the flesh not literally whipped off of me but it felt like it i had so much trouble and trials because it was all in the leading of god and i didn't know it if i'd have just surrendered man i could have caused myself but save myself a lot of trouble because the peace of god that passive understanding will keep your hearts and minds is it to keep your hearts and your minds in christ jesus see people go insane backslide because they do not keep their hearts and minds in tune with god's perfect will with god's perfect word his authority it does not fail god cannot fail god doesn't make any mistakes he's the same yesterday today and forever his word is settled in heaven cannot train lord he doesn't move you know it didn't move for this side or that side you know i'm trying to think of the scripture i can't think of it i'll think of it back in my room you know when you get old you know i found out it ain't only old people that have senior moments young people haven't seen your mom did you ever notice something i'm going to close in this what we do we must do it quickly you ever notice how time is flying how the months fly by they didn't seem to used to go that fast the days would be shortened for the election we're going to get out here because the days are evil they're getting eviler and eviler and evil who would ever thought the things that you read whoever thought what is going on the evil and that's the days are just getting so short you know that's the reason why i'm angry you'll find out if i can say it in the right way tomorrow you know i want my i want my passage and i know brother clinton i mean we talk back and forth from messenger but i know who he's talking to the most time the sister whose best the orens you know i was there i was best man and i preached the wedding ceremony i can't perform it because that's another country but i have a preacher preached and i remember true love now i'm going to tell on him when closing okay i'm i'm still being serious this is true love he was so happy he'd been so sick and he's still sick you need to pray for him when brother danner i pronounce you husband and wife everybody there didn't know what to expect i don't ever told this but he took her like this and went over like that and gave her the big kiss like that and brought her up he said we got to take a picture that you got to do it again i thought he was going to drop her and sister lou said i think y'all thought he was he was going to drop me also but that's true love that's true filial love how much more that our heavenly father loves us our lord jesus loves us and he wants to put that heavenly kiss on us amen amen hallelujah hey man hallelujah amen amen i'm in love with my wife but i'm more so in love with the lord jesus christ amen amen i believe we'll just stand now he'll stand with me and i'm going to pray i know we're small in number but uh gracious heavenly father lord as uh i've been dared to speak what was on my heart maybe not maybe leaving things over gone a little bit but speaking like i believe sometimes we shoot
