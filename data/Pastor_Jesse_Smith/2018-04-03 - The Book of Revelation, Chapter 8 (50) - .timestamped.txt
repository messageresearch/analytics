[0:03] Revelation chapter 8 the themes of this
[0:08] chapter are the opening of the Seventh
[0:10] Seal and the sounding of the first four
[0:13] trumpets of judgment upon the earth and
[0:15] its inhabitants
[0:19] the opening of the seventh and final
[0:21] seal causes silence in heaven for the
[0:23] space of half an hour after the silence
[0:26] ends all the prayers of the Saints are
[0:29] made ready to be answered and
[0:30] preparations are made for the sounding
[0:33] of the seven trumpets a great earthquake
[0:36] also takes place upon the earth before
[0:38] the trumpets begin sounding the first
[0:41] trumpet sends hail and a mixture of fire
[0:44] and blood upon the earth the second
[0:46] trumpet causes the sea to become blood
[0:48] during the third trumpet the star named
[0:51] wormwood falls upon the rivers and
[0:53] fountains of waters causing much death
[0:56] the fourth trumpet sounds and a third
[0:59] part of all light is lost and there is
[1:02] no day for eight hours an angel then
[1:05] warns the inhabitants of the earth that
[1:07] three woes will be coming upon the earth
[1:09] through the last three trumpets
[1:13] the timing of these events are as
[1:16] follows our conviction although we could
[1:19] be wrong is that the opening of the
[1:21] Seventh Seal is the rapture of the New
[1:23] Testament Bride of Christ and takes
[1:25] place at the unknown Day an hour
[1:28] that Jesus foretold in Matthew 24 verse
[1:31] 36 and mark 13 verse 32 the rapture is
[1:36] the next major Bible event that is to
[1:38] take place and will be immediately
[1:40] followed by the Tribulation Period so we
[1:43] are watching and praying for that moment
[1:45] as Jesus commanded the timing of the
[1:48] sounding of the first four trumpets is
[1:50] also something that we could be wrong
[1:52] about but here is our conviction it
[1:54] seems these first four trumpets sound
[1:57] after the rapture during the last three
[2:00] and a half years of Daniels 70th week
[2:02] and also after the hundred forty-four
[2:05] thousand Jews are sealed by the Spirit
[2:07] of God we come to this conclusion
[2:09] because revelation 7 verse 1 says that
[2:12] no tree can be hurt until after the
[2:16] 144,000 are sealed in the first trumpet
[2:19] we see a third of the trees burn up so
[2:22] this is why we believe the trumpets
[2:23] sound after the 144,000 Israelites are
[2:27] sealed with the Holy Ghost notice that
[2:31] the first four trumpets are pronounced
[2:33] or initiated by the two witnesses of
[2:35] Revelation 11 as they will be given
[2:37] power over nature according to
[2:39] revelation 11 verse 6 and the effects of
[2:42] the first four trumpets are an
[2:44] interruption of nature which also
[2:46] enlightens us to know that all seven of
[2:48] the trumpets sound under the sixth seal
[2:51] which we're taught in Revelation chapter
[2:53] 6 verses 12 to 17 the symbols and key
[2:58] revelations in this chapter are the
[3:00] seven seal and the silence in heaven for
[3:03] half an hour what is remarkable about
[3:06] the seventh seal is that there are no
[3:08] symbols given which is different than
[3:11] the six previous seals there are no
[3:13] symbols for the seventh seal or rapture
[3:15] because if there were Satan could use
[3:18] those symbols and try to do damage to
[3:20] the bride of Jesus Christ the rapture is
[3:23] such an important and secretive event
[3:25] that the father would not even a
[3:27] the Sun to know the day or hour of his
[3:30] own return for his bride mark 13:32 but
[3:35] of that day and that hour knoweth no man
[3:37] no not the angels which are in heaven
[3:40] neither the son but the father we
[3:44] believe the phrase silence in heaven for
[3:46] half an hour contains a key revelation
[3:48] because silence in heaven would mean
[3:50] that the four beasts who worship Christ
[3:52] without ceasing day or night according
[3:54] to Revelation 4 verse 8 finally stop
[3:58] worshiping Christ we believe this is
[4:00] because Christ the object of their
[4:02] worship will leave heaven to go down to
[4:05] the air or sky to rapture the dead in
[4:08] Christ first and then change the bodies
[4:10] of the living Saints according to 1st
[4:12] Thessalonians 4 verses 16 and 17 and
[4:15] first Corinthians 15 verse 52 which is
[4:19] the rapture or caught up experience of
[4:21] the Gentile bride

[4:35] Christ be the desire of your heart
