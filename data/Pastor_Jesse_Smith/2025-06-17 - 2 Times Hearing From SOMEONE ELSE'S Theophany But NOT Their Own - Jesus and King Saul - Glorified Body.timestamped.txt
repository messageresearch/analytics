[0:03] You have then been formed into the
[0:06] living image of the living God. You've
[0:09] heard from your theophony. If this
[0:11] earthly body be dissolved, we have one
[0:14] waiting.
[0:16] Greetings, friends, in the matchless
[0:18] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The
[0:20] purpose of this video is to show how
[0:22] there are times in the Bible when
[0:24] believers heard from someone else's
[0:26] theophony. They did not hear from their
[0:29] own theophony, but they heard from
[0:31] someone else's. So, this video is a
[0:33] followup to yesterday's video by the
[0:35] grace of God. And again, friends, this
[0:37] is a great opportunity to rightly divide
[0:39] the word of truth to search the
[0:41] scriptures daily whether these things be
[0:43] so. The question we're looking at is,
[0:45] can someone hear from their own
[0:47] theophony? God's prophet, brother
[0:49] Brandham, said this in who is this?
[0:50] Melzdc, February 21st, 1965.
[0:55] Looking at the whole quote, he said,
[0:56] "Then after you recognized the very word
[0:58] of God was eagle food, then you left the
[1:01] other thing. You have then been formed
[1:03] into the living image of the living
[1:05] God." You heard from your theophony, "If
[1:09] this earthly body be dissolved, we have
[1:12] one waiting." So the Bible verse,
[1:14] Brother quotes is 2 Corinthians 5:1. So
[1:17] let's look at that here briefly by God's
[1:19] grace. We'll start with verse one. For
[1:21] we know that if our earthly house of
[1:23] this tabernacle were dissolved, we have
[1:25] a building of God and house not made
[1:28] with hands, eternal in the heavens.
[1:30] Verse two, for in this we grown
[1:33] earnestly desiring to be clothed upon
[1:36] with our house which is from heaven.
[1:39] Let's read verse three and four as well.
[1:41] If so be that being clothed, we shall
[1:43] not be found naked.
[1:45] So that means believers will have a
[1:47] theophony that's eternal. Unbelievers
[1:51] will not have an eternal theophony.
[1:53] They'll have a theophony. They have to
[1:55] have some spiritual body they go in when
[1:57] their flesh body is dead and is buried
[1:59] here on the earth. But the Bible makes
[2:01] it seem like they have a naked theophony
[2:04] that is not eternal. The believer's
[2:07] theophony would be a white robe most
[2:09] likely. The Bible speaks of that in
[2:11] numerous occasions. Even the Jewish
[2:13] souls under the altar are given white
[2:15] robes. And the white robe is the
[2:17] righteousness of Christ according to
[2:19] Revelation chapter 19. Let's look at 2
[2:22] Corinthians 5:4. For we that are in this
[2:25] tabernacle do grown being burdened, not
[2:27] for that we would be unclothed, but
[2:30] clothed upon that mortality might be
[2:32] swallowed up of life.
[2:35] So brother Brandon makes this statement,
[2:37] you heard from your theophony. But if we
[2:40] go back to the scripture, there's
[2:41] nothing in this passage that says we
[2:43] heard from our theophony. From this
[2:45] passage, it seems we are groaning for
[2:47] our theophony. So, we're longing for
[2:50] heaven. We're homesick for heaven, for
[2:52] our theophony body, our eternal body.
[2:56] But again, I just put this on the shelf.
[2:57] If brother A said it, then I want to
[2:59] search it out. I want to give him the
[3:01] benefit of doubt as a true prophet of
[3:03] God, which he was and is. But for this
[3:06] video again, I thought I'd show two
[3:08] cases where people heard from other
[3:10] theophonyies, someone else's theophony.
[3:12] And then we could look at a third case
[3:14] where people saw others in their
[3:16] theophony. And these would be very
[3:18] familiar by God's grace. So the first
[3:20] one is Jesus on Mount Transfiguration.
[3:24] He saw and heard from two other
[3:26] theophanes. The theophony of Moses and
[3:28] the Theophony of Elijah. This is in
[3:31] Matthew 17. Also Luke chapter 9. And I'm
[3:33] going to read out of Luke 9 in verse 29.
[3:37] Jesus as he prayed, his countenance was
[3:39] changed. He was given white and
[3:42] glistening garments. And then there
[3:44] talked with him two men which were Moses
[3:46] and Elias who appeared in glory and
[3:50] spake of his decease which he should
[3:52] accomplish at Jerusalem. So here's Jesus
[3:56] hearing from the theophanes of Moses and
[3:58] Elijah. They were talking about his
[4:01] crucifixion that he would have to endure
[4:03] for the joy that was set before him. And
[4:05] brother Ram also said this was a
[4:07] foreshadowing of the rapture. Moses
[4:10] represents the dead in Christ that will
[4:12] rise first. And then Elijah represents
[4:14] the believers that are alive and remain
[4:17] and will go to meet the Lord in the air
[4:20] as spoken of in 1 Thessalonians chapter
[4:22] 4 and 1 Corinthians chapter 15. So
[4:26] that's the first case of someone hearing
[4:28] from other theophanes. And as far as I
[4:31] can find, there's only two cases in the
[4:33] Bible. The second one is in the Old
[4:34] Testament. 1st Samuel 28 7 through 20.
[4:39] This is when King Saul goes to the witch
[4:41] of Endor and requests to speak to Samuel
[4:44] and Samuel's theophony is brought up and
[4:46] he looks like an old man, the Bible
[4:48] says, and he's able to give Saul
[4:51] information about what's going to happen
[4:53] to him. In 1st Samuel 28:14, the Bible
[4:56] said, "An old man cometh up covered with
[5:00] a mantle." So Samuel had a spiritual
[5:04] theophony that looked like an old man in
[5:06] a mantle. And then Samuel prophesies to
[5:09] King Saul because that's what prophets
[5:11] do. They prophesy. And brother Ram said,
[5:13] "Whatever you are on this earth, you'll
[5:16] be that in the next life as well." And
[5:18] so Samuel is still a prophet. That's why
[5:21] I said earlier, brother Random is still
[5:23] a prophet just like St. Paul, St. John,
[5:25] St. Peter, Agabus, many other prophets.
[5:29] But Samuel prophesies in verse 19,
[5:31] tomorrow shalt thou and thy sons be with
[5:33] me. Of course, that would have been in
[5:35] the bosom of Abraham as Jesus talked
[5:37] about in the book of Luke. So those are
[5:40] the two cases where a person hears from
[5:43] other theophanes, but they did not hear
[5:45] from their own theophony. Then Matthew
[5:48] 27:52 and 53 is where Jesus resurrected
[5:52] and many of the graves were open and
[5:56] many of the Old Testament saints rose
[5:58] from the dead. And some people think
[6:00] these resurrected saints were in
[6:02] theophanes or perhaps they were already
[6:04] in glorified bodies. I don't know. In
[6:06] fact, I'm just thinking about that right
[6:08] now. I'm not sure what type of body they
[6:09] were in, whether it was theophony or
[6:11] glorified because Jesus no doubt would
[6:13] have raised with a glorified body. And
[6:15] the Bible said the graves were open and
[6:17] many bodies of the saints which slept
[6:19] arose. So there it mentions bodies. So
[6:20] it looks like it's perhaps the dead
[6:23] bodies were resurrected into a glorified
[6:25] condition and came out of the graves
[6:27] after his resurrection and went into the
[6:29] holy city and appeared unto many. So
[6:32] we're not told that there was any
[6:34] communication between these resurrected
[6:36] saints and the living believers or any
[6:40] living person there in Jerusalem. We're
[6:42] not told that there's any communication.
[6:44] But the people that were still alive in
[6:46] Jerusalem did see the resurrected
[6:48] saints. And again, I'm not sure which
[6:50] bodies they were in. Perhaps they were
[6:52] in all three bodies. The original flesh
[6:55] body, but that was now in a glorified
[6:57] condition and their theophony was inside
[6:59] of that glorified body. I'm not sure.
[7:02] But I just wanted to show those three
[7:04] cases today. Two cases where people
[7:06] actually talked to other Theophies, but
[7:09] not their own. And then a case where
[7:12] people living on earth saw resurrected
[7:15] bodies perhaps theophanes or perhaps
[7:18] glorified bodies. So in closing friends,
[7:20] I hope this video was a blessing by the
[7:21] grace of God. I really appreciate the
[7:23] comments there. Perhaps tomorrow I'll do
[7:25] a video where I can go through some of
[7:27] the comments. So let's keep searching
[7:29] the scriptures daily whether these
[7:30] things be so. As Acts 17:1 says about
[7:33] the Bereans, they were more noble than
[7:36] those in Thessalonica because every day
[7:38] they searched the scriptures. Let's
[7:40] continue to do that. The Holy Ghost will
[7:42] guide us into all truth. And friends,
[7:44] perhaps I should do this more, but if
[7:45] you are not saved, you need to repent of
[7:48] your sins, confess all your sins to the
[7:51] Lord Jesus Christ, accept the pardoning
[7:53] mercy of the blood of Jesus Christ, and
[7:56] be baptized in the name of the Lord
[7:58] Jesus Christ, and then you will receive
[8:00] the gift of the Holy Ghost. There's no
[8:03] reason to wait. Today can be the day of
[8:06] salvation. So we rejoice in the power of
[8:09] the cross of Jesus Christ. And now the
[8:11] resurrected Lord Jesus has sent his Holy
[8:14] Ghost to the earth today and his spirit
[8:17] is seeking souls that want to be saved
[8:19] that want to be forgiven of all their
[8:21] sins and have a promise of eternal life.
[8:24] If you have any questions, concerns or
[8:26] testimonies about this video, please
[8:27] contact me.
[8:30] God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[8:32] the desire of your heart. Very happy to
[8:36] be here this afternoon and again in
[8:38] defense of the gospel of Jesus Christ to
[8:41] bring the good tidings, the good news
[8:44] that Jesus raised from the dead, living
[8:46] among man today, his church. The same
[8:49] Jesus that was yesterday will be today
[8:52] and forever
[8:54] is never failed.
