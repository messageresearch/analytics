Description:
The Bible and Brother Branham teach the Token is the seal of the Holy Ghost baptism (Acts 1:5, 2:38, Eph. 4:30, 1 Cor. 12:13, Mark 16:17-18, 1 John 3:9). In love and respect, the Tape Church Movement is wrong to say the Token is the tapes and the state of being a tape church. Their vision, to play tapes to limit or replace preachers, contradicts Brother Branham's vision to continue God's apostolic system Paul modeled: preachers training and ordaining more preachers.
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to show that William Branham taught the token was the Holy Ghost and not his tapes I humbly have to disagree with the tape church movement that says the token is two things it is not they falsely claimed brother branham's tapes are the token and the state of being a tape Church is the token here's the outline for this video first gratitude to God for the token and reminder that I've reached out in love to leadership in jeffersonville second will define the token which is the sea of the Holy Ghost by the Bible and a few brother random quotes third we'll look at three of the tape churches false teachings and misinterpretations about the token fourth we'll look at more brother random quotes on the token being the holy ghost and not his tapes gratitude as I did in the absolute video I also want to express my gratitude to the Lord Jesus Christ for the token the baptism of the Holy Ghost I was not raised in brother branham's message but as soon as I heard it I rejoiced believed it and saw Jesus Christ transform my life by his literal life I'm grateful for brother branham's role as a genuine prophet to preach on the token and point us to the token as he said truly as we listen to his tapes we can see brother branham's life displayed God's token the baptism of the Holy Ghost but the tapes are not the token nor are the tapes the absolute the Holy Ghost baptism is the token and Jesus Christ is the absolute so again just like the two previous videos have proven the tape church movement is saying numerous false teachings that brother Branham never said brother Branham never said his every word was the saith the Lord brother random never said that tapes were the absolute and brother branham never said the tapes were the token again I believe brother Branham was a genuine prophet of God whose ministry fulfilled revelation 10 7 Malachi 4 5 & 6 Luke 17 30 Matthew 17 11 acts 3 21 and revelation 3:14 this video is the fourth in a series aimed at rightly dividing the word of truth regarding 7 false teachings coming from the Jeffersonville Indiana Tape church movement you can view the other videos on my youtube channel they're called overview video the 7 false teachings of Jeffersonville tape church movement the 2nd one is called not every word William Branham said was thus saith the Lord and the third one is called William branham's absolute was Jesus Christ not his tapes again I've reached out to Jeffersonville in love and humility sending them letters emails free copies of my book and even made a private youtube video just for them I received two letters back and recently I received another email but it seems they're not willing to receive my Bible base correction nor the correction from brother branham's own tapes so I will pray for them and hope for a speedy repentance in which they will publicly acknowledge their false teachings and teach only the truth of God's Holy Word let's define the token by the Bible and God's prophet brother Branham here the scriptures brother Adam cites for the token and please notice he never says my tapes are the token the scriptures are acts 1 verse 5 and acts 2:38 Ephesians 4:30 1st Corinthians 12 verse 13 mark 16 17 and 18 and first John 3:9 acts 1 verse 5 for John truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence acts 2:38 then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost listen as these quotes prove brother Adam taught these scriptures spoke of the token the baptism of the Holy Ghost [Music] that was a theme of ever apostle that was I have you receive the Holy Father in this your sins and you shall receive this gift of the Holy Ghost more as a token next brother branham uses Ephesians 4:32 say the token is the sea of the Holy Ghost and grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption we accept his sacrificed blood that he gave his life the token seal of the Holy Ghost is our promise Ephesians 4:30 Siegfried not the Holy Spirit of God or by your seal until the day of your Redemption brother branham uses first Corinthians 12:13 to say the token is the baptism of the one Holy Spirit for by one spirit are we all baptized into one body whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be bond or free and have been all made to drink into one spirit one spirit all baptized into one body and made for takers of his glory or are left home march down to the promised land brother branham uses mark 16 verses 17 and 18 to call the token the seal and then it manifests its life through supernatural works in the life of the worshiper and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover [Music] [Music] preach the gospel to every creature he believeth and is baptized shall be saved even believeth not shall be damned and that God has accepted the worshiper or the spirit of life that was in Christ comes upon the worshiper lastly brother random quotes first John 3:9 to say the token is the spiritual seed of God whosoever's born of God does not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of God Selah promise Ephesians 4:30 says greed not the Holy Ghost of God for by your sealed until the day of your redemption not to the next revival until the day of your redemption being baptized into the court in first Corinthians 12 and in him is the fullest and no sin is recognized in him is born of God doesn't commit sins see the God remains in it he cannot sin how can he one of their tokens their their token is a sign he's been accepted where is the token as part of the definition of the token we must know where the token is what's the location of the token friends is the token in jeffersonville is it inside my phone as my mp3 files is it on my bookshelf or my desk in the form of brother randoms sermon books no all these are false teachings the token is located in the soul of the Holy Ghost filled Christian as brother Branham taught friends the token is inside a true believer not outside a believer listen to brother Branham explain it through these quotes Peters to the word brings God that were eternal in you and that is the token when the word is in you it's Christ in you that is it cannot perish sadly a lot of plays over it's a token days or that's not a body these or that soul that person there's a token or they're the Holy Spirit that is longs to God three misinterpretations or false doctrines of the Jeffersonville tape church movement here are three exact quotes from the leadership at Branham Tabernacle making these false claims which I have audio copies of and I quote they referring to preachers got to catch the vision you got to play the tapes you've got to Amen they're the token friends with all due respect this statement is wrong on multiple levels based upon brother Graham's quotes you've already heard the tapes cannot be the token because first the token is inside you and the tapes are outside you second the token is a spirit the Holy Spirit so the token is spiritual while the tapes are natural and third brother Branham said you can believe all of his words on tape and still not have the token according to these quotes the very life that was in Christ friends brother Branham says you can listen to his tapes and not have the token doesn't have the quickening power in you the sun is shining off you set this Tabernacle you listen to tape and yet the spirit is never quitting you so you can follow the Word of God thank you winning humans could obey every word that he's written the fourth point is very important brother branham's vision for the future was not playing tapes to replace preachers as the tape church movement teaches the jeffersonville movement is wrong about their vision because it does not match brother branham's vision you'll soon hear brother branham's own words about his vision for preachers to preach and teach new converts from his sermon taking sides with Jesus in June of 1962 friend's brother random told us his vision but jeffersonville is working against brother branham's vision by shutting down or limiting preachers telling them to preach less or not at all but brother Branham said we need more preachers listen as brother Branham tells us his true vision for the future was to continue the Apostolic pattern or early church pattern of preachers gaining new converts and then sending in pastors and teachers to teach the new converts just as Paul gave the same example in the book of Acts now we're going to start off with the early church and just bring it for about five minutes now down to what they did and then I can show you the vision that I have for the future the churches of those days like in Asia Minor all throughout Europe they didn't believe that message and when he had preached the message and many was converted to it then there was no one if the less of people in that condition did wonder right back out into their pagan gods and into Judaism and whatever more because that people had no one to teach them the converse they had no place to go so Paul established churches in different parts of the country each one of these churches he left someone who was an order or man that was trustworthy a man was known as a pastor Shepard are then actory this church then become other little churches come out of it young man and old man raised up and become churches out of that the man that was over the first church was called the bishop and then his that went out from him his children was called Shepherds our pastors and then this group of little churches all would come back to this Bishop like in the time of Arminius he carried on the same thing Martin Carroll on the same thing Polycarp Carolyn the same thing right on down to the age they had that and then the apostle of the church the Apostle that was the Paul and when Paul death John took over the church and when John left Polycarp take it over when Pollock heart left Irene has taken over and long down on Martin and so forth notice brother branham's vision is a scriptural vision because it lines up with acts 14:23 Titus 1:5 and 2nd Timothy 2:2 and when they had ordained them elders in every Church and had prayed with fasting they commended them to the Lord on whom they believed for this cause left IV and Crete that thou should have set in order the things that are wanting and ordain elders in every city as I had appointed thee and the things that thou has heard of me among many witnesses the same commit thou to faithful men who shall be able to teach others also then brother branham explains the same early church pattern for his own ministry with this message these people maybe you have thousands of them stay there for a week or two and they see the ministry they love it they believe it's a truth that come out of heathenism what if I had a group of name young man trained in the message this say now wait a minute before I leave here we're going to set an order these churches had already telegram and they got the money they're on the road here right now to take over this our good name is two or three young men living we will be his helpers and assistants and a church of this faith can be sit there which will be a post in India a post in Germany outpost in Switzerland well right now we should had an all around the nations where I've been and I'm this event from there comes another from another comes another so according to these quotes from taking sides with Jesus you can clearly see God's system according to brother Branham was established by Paul starting churches and ordaining preachers over those churches brother Branham said that's God's system it was God's Way back there and it's God's Way now you got to get it a system god system like Jethro said to Moses why you can't beat out all of them or and God put elders out there that's the way that was God's way back there that was God's Way in the in the early church eh and I believe it's God's Way back brother branham said to train the young ministers in the deeper teachings of God so they will be prepared to preach and teach others later and then in their get training in your own groups other ministers man that you see that has a calling in their life for the ministry dream them young man bring him in here to the elder all that is set together in a ministerial meeting and their teach the deeper things for God don't go on the bat in if you get the preacher straight to him going right look what he's going to do he's going to influenza it would take care of the hundreds of these things that's it we're just beating that you see you got to get it a system God's system so the tape church movement has the wrong vision it does not match brother branham's vision and then brother Branham says to carry on his vision which is continuing Paul's apostolic pattern of preachers overseeing churches and preachers training younger preachers until Jesus comes he never said to stop preaching and play the tapes so the tape church movement is trying to change brother branham's vision or ignore it that's carry this on just as we have that's just the way it is I'm grateful for these young ministers see I see at the day of judgment or this entire valleys to your there'll be no excuse because we've got little churches setting out everywhere outpost listening post waiting and I think that's the thing to do keep on carrying on until Jesus comes and that's what I wanted to say in that matter nine months later after he preached taking sides with Jesus in March of 1963 brother Branham said to continue preaching and evangelizing in the same apostolic pattern brother Branham never taught them to play the tapes and stop or limit preaching notice now the next question should evangelist continue on the field in this hour of course what to mean certainly by all means don't change the thing if Jesus is coming in the morning preach today like of his Bobby tenure someday but live life's go be a design don't don't get screwed up now that's what I'm trying to warn you about see just don't be odd for cure don't change daily but if you're doing something wrong or doing evil repent come back to God and continue on your evangelistic service just as you always did then again in August of 1964 brother branham support of this same apostolic pattern in questions and answers part three brother Branham is it true that no one should preach but you we have seen your we have seen you our Dane man we do don't believe you would do that if there were not that they were not to preach mercy brother sister who told you - no boys preached for the hot sure via four subjects Agathon's with all that no every man feels the call of God upon his life get into the ministry start preaching we need them man of God are anointed all over the world to preach the gospel I'm just one little pebble on the beach among many big stones so there's this many this more eligible more worthy more of anything to preach than me I'm just one little humble person laying here on one grain of wheat in a hole garner see so it's just you know what I mean any man it's cold or God needs to preach the gospel friends listen how highly brother branham esteemed preachers who could rightly divide the word of truth it's so sad many in the tape church movement disagree with brother Branham on this point anything the preachers a man who knew rightly divide the word of God the most wonderful gift in the world is to be a minister which is a which was the New Testament modern-day prophet a preacher and notice Paul says the same thing about giving preachers double honor especially those who labor in the word and in doctrine first Timothy 5 7 says let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honor especially they who labor in the word and doctrine a second false teaching from the leadership at Branham tabernacle is and I quote she speaking of Rahab had to show her token she said I'm a tape church that's the token I'd say it's real important to say that were taped church again this cannot be the token because the token is inside one individual believer in their soul the token is not a building where people gather or a home where people gather friend just because a person says I'm part of a tape church doesn't mean they are born-again remember brother Branham said you can believe every word on his tapes and still not be born again just through these first two misinterpretations from the tape church movement you can see that they have essentially committed the same mistake as Pentecostals who make speaking in tongues the evidence of the Holy Ghost baptism which is a carnal evidence that can be easily impersonated catch this friends instead of tongues as the evidence now tapes are the evidence according to this false teaching from the tape church movement owning brother randoms tapes as a collection of mp3 files and playing brother Rams tapes in your sunday church gathering is not the evidence of being born again these are two fleshly carnal evidences for being born-again that can be easily impersonated proving they're not the token thirdly leadership at jeffersonville uses the following quote to say the tapes are the token because brother Branham says the token is the message of the hour but again they failed to catch brother branham statement a few paragraphs beforehand when he says the token is the Covenant of the Holy Spirit so again the tape church movement is misinterpreting the quotes of brother Branham so according to this quote the message of the hour is not every word he said on the tapes but it's receiving the Covenant of the baptism of the holy ghost friends this is what Jeffersonville is failing to do they do not rightly divide the quotes of brother Branham nor God's Word it's true we won't know everything in this life but on simple questions like what is the token or what is the absolute surely God wants us to know the truth about it and he has clearly showed it to us and it is not what Jeffersonville says it is God has let us know the true meaning behind the token we just have to press play and when you do you find the tapes are not the absolute because Jesus is nor our tapes the token because the Holy Ghost is and when you press play you find brother Branham saying we need more preachers like all their false doctrines around the message they always start with groups who major too much on one or two quotes as they fail to rightly divide the quotes with other quotes and with the Word of God more brother random quotes on the token the baptism of the Holy Ghost please listen to the following statements and you'll see what brother Branham meant by the token it is the Holy Ghost we are living in the shadows and the wrath is ready to strike God's requiring a token that you yourself have received his token the Holy Ghost it's the only way and the only sign that God never passed a call it is the literal life of Jesus Christ returned back into the believer that's the way it has to be with every believer today feel with the Holy Ghost a token that the shed blood of the Lamb that life that was in the lamb has returned back and is publicly sealed in there but everybody passing by talking to you has any associates when you see that the blood has been applied and a token of the life that was in that blood is upon you and the substitute a life of Jesus Christ has to come into you which is the Holy Ghost God's token that you have accepted the blood of His Son Jesus Christ that come from the body of our Lord Jesus Christ water blood and light and the whole church the bride together has been made up to justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost which is the token is Hebrews 11 says there's going to be there all because they're going to be there each one of them one with the other the water veins the blood age and now the token age of the Holy Ghost now the very spirited self as a token the Holy Spirit itself is the token not the blood the tokens got to be displayed when I see the Blood I will pass over you nothing else would work it must be the blood now the Holy Ghost is our token from God a little while in the world would see me tomorrow Jericho Egypt they won't see me no more yet you shall see me for ah ah the personal pronouns always referred to be with you I am the Tolkien my resurrection is the token I works that I do will identify you well identify me in you without being in that we become part of the word and I take the token the spirit over the promise and they they be filled with the holy spirit and display the token of the life of Jesus Christ in his resurrection as long as they remain your own branded Lord and the substitute a life of Jesus Christ has to come into you which is the Holy Ghost God's token that you have accepted the blood of His Son Jesus Christ each house of God must be covered by the token all it's inside of it must be covered by the token and the house of God is the body of Jesus Christ and not one spirit we're all baptized and you'll just token and become part of it that God said when I see this token displayed I'll pass over we cannot feel safe until this token is this plain dying you must come under this token God's holy spirit and it displays to you Jesus Christ because it comes and lives in you God lets everlasting eternal token it's eternal life by the eternal God and anything that had a beginning has an end and everything had a beginning besides God and God is the only form of eternal life there is and when God places his Holy Spirit in you which is God and when God places his self within you yours eternally as God is that cause you're part of him because you become a son or a daughter of God and you're displaying his word oh I feel religious that's true God in a positive self you've got eternal life that's God in you and this word is gone and that word lives and produces itself just exactly what God has ordained for this age you have a man the Holy Ghost the Holy Spirit been displayed yes sir what is it the Holy Spirit the word has been quickened to you by the Holy Spirit to have indicate this age that you have passed from death into life and now you are his in closing it is my humble prayer that you can now see that the token is the inward baptism of the Holy Ghost in a real Christian soul the token is not a physical set of books or tapes or electronic mp3 files the token is what the Bible and brother Branham said it was the baptism of the Holy Ghost friends this video is produced in love and I can truly say that I love our friends in Jeffersonville and around the world who are part of the tape church movement if you carefully listen to this entire video you're aware I never spoke evil against the people in the tape church movement I never named called them or predicted where their souls would end up I'm praying for their salvation and correction I've made this video series following the leadership of the Holy Ghost to bring correction to the false teachings coming out of the tape church movement not speaking evil but speaking the truth I haven't called names but I could have I don't feel led to do that but please know brother Branham did in fact call names on tape to bring correction he did it with kindness to the brothers such as Billy Graham brother Brock brother Gilmour and brother David du Plessis the tape church movement is vast influencing millions since I believe their movement is teaching false doctrine I feel led of the Holy Ghost of brain correction and speak the truth in love as a witness against it as 1st Peter 3:15 and Ephesians 4:15 command me along with proving all things trying every spirit to see whether they are of God and I'm commissioned by God to rightly divide the word of truth according to 2nd Timothy 2:15 I'm thankful for those who have reached out to express their appreciation for this video series may God richly bless you as you stand for the true revelation of God's endtime message I'm also thankful for those who have disagreed in brotherly kindness I always want to show love and respect even when brothers disagree I tried really hard to make this video without calling names to fulfill the quote brother Branham said about not speaking evil against one another we are together in this with God we are brothers and sisters daughters of God live like sons of God they have sweet kind humble let no evil come in your mind and your thinking is given knocks on the door taken away you just save your joke please contact me if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video god bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
