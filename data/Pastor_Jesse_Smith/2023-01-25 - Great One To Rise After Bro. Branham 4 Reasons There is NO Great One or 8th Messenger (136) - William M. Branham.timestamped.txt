[0:02] when I have been under anticipation and
[0:05] believe that some great one was coming
[0:07] someday or maybe a great prophet that a
[0:10] speak will come of the Elijah
[0:15] greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:17] of the Lord Jesus Christ was there a
[0:21] great one to come after brother
[0:22] Brandon's ministry as brother Branham
[0:25] said in 1962
[0:27] I believe the answer is no for at least
[0:30] four reasons
[0:32] recently a viewer emailed me this
[0:35] question and I wanted to make a short
[0:36] quick video with a solid answer by the
[0:39] grace of God
[0:41] let's begin by looking at three quotes
[0:43] where brother Brandon mentions a great
[0:44] one to come after him
[0:47] and also the idea that he was laying a
[0:49] foundation for someone to follow him
[0:53] so the first quote is from taking sides
[0:55] with Jesus in 1962. this is the quote
[0:58] where brother Branham calls this person
[0:59] a great one and said this one would have
[1:02] the spirit of Elisha which I think
[1:04] brother Brandon meant Spirit of Elijah
[1:06] but let's listen to the quote
[1:08] well if I thought that there was a
[1:12] denomination or any other group of
[1:15] Believers that had anything better than
[1:18] we had here
[1:20] brethren how would I want to emerge this
[1:23] little body with it right quick
[1:25] I've waited I have longed I have been
[1:29] under anticipation and believed that
[1:32] some great one was coming someday
[1:34] or maybe a great prophet that a speak
[1:36] will come of the Elijah I've always
[1:40] believed and thought maybe that maybe
[1:42] I've lived to see the day that when I
[1:44] could change when I'd see that person
[1:47] rise on the scene then I could take my
[1:50] little church and say rather
[1:52] this is the man we have looked for
[1:54] this man he is the one I've waited for
[1:57] that
[2:01] a second quote is from a sermon from
[2:05] December 1963 Look Away to Jesus brother
[2:08] Bram said if he's laying a foundation
[2:11] for another to stand upon
[2:14] let's listen to the quote
[2:16] if I'm laying a foundation that another
[2:19] stand upon Grant Lord that soon it'll
[2:22] happen
[2:23] that the word might be fulfilled our
[2:26] harsh desire is to see your word
[2:28] fulfilled
[2:31] the third quote is from the laodicean
[2:34] church age sermon from December 11 1960
[2:37] in this quote brother random speaks of a
[2:39] man coming with the spirit of Elijah at
[2:41] the end of the laodicean church age and
[2:43] he calls this man Anointed with the
[2:45] spirit of Elijah the great one that's to
[2:48] come
[2:48] and in this quote brother random says
[2:50] this Elijah anointed man will fulfill
[2:52] Malachi chapter 4 verses 5 and 6.
[2:56] turning the hearts of the children back
[2:58] to the father's message
[3:00] or the day of Pentecost message let's
[3:02] listen to the quote
[3:14] Elijah Elijah after he had give his
[3:18] prophecy Elijah did not have to die
[3:22] he was translated and was taken up into
[3:25] heaven a type of a church at the end of
[3:30] this Elijah that will come at the end of
[3:33] his time the church will go in the
[3:35] Rapture without going through the
[3:37] shadows of death it'll be the Rapture I
[3:40] believe the great Elijah the great the
[3:42] one that succumbed will be the anointed
[3:44] Elijah that's prophesied for the last
[3:46] days amen
[3:49] I think he will be when he comes the
[3:52] angel or the messenger to the church in
[3:55] the last days are rejected degraded
[3:58] people as this church will get into and
[4:01] is already
[4:02] it I think Elijah is Promised in the
[4:05] Bible I think we can understand that
[4:07] that Elijah was the one that was
[4:09] promised in the Bible to come in this
[4:10] state do you believe that
[4:13] we'll be looking for that great wander
[4:15] around us you might come in my day he
[4:18] might come in the younger days
[4:20] I don't know he might be right Among Us
[4:22] now we can't tell the holy spirit is
[4:24] here to lead us to that time now when
[4:26] this leader will take his order he'll
[4:27] still be anointed of the Holy Ghost
[4:31] that will come but he will be a the
[4:33] leader that will turn the hearts of the
[4:35] children or the hearts of the children
[4:38] back to the father's message back to our
[4:42] Heavenly father's message on the day of
[4:43] Pentecost one report I dispute which
[4:45] that little line of Rises the coaches
[4:47] the Good by the history Bible and show
[4:49] that that thing has come right down
[4:51] through the church ages and that's it
[4:53] today
[4:54] also friends here's a fourth quote I
[4:57] found When I Was preparing this video
[4:58] where brother Brandon said he believed a
[5:01] man
[5:02] somebody would come after him and it was
[5:04] from questions and answers 1961.
[5:07] and I love this quote because brother
[5:09] Brandon makes the preachers of this
[5:10] message messengers of the same message
[5:13] and what I love about this quote is that
[5:16] it points us to Ephesians chapter 4
[5:18] verses 8 through 16 and the importance
[5:21] of all five preaching gifts and Paul
[5:24] said with us saith the scripture that
[5:26] the entire fivefold Ministry would bring
[5:28] the bride to a Unity of the faith and we
[5:30] know that has to be done before the
[5:31] Rapture of the Gentile Church let's
[5:34] listen to the quote I know there's
[5:36] something happening in my life and
[5:38] that's not that's beyond any question my
[5:40] brother thank you but let me say this
[5:45] that
[5:46] there will come
[5:49] terrible from admit
[5:51] and there will come an edge
[5:54] I believe that
[5:56] if it's to be a man it'll be somebody
[5:59] after me see It'll be uh but this
[6:04] message that I'm preaching
[6:08] uh
[6:10] is the true message of this day and it's
[6:13] the last message
[6:15] you see what I'm doing brother I'm
[6:17] putting you all the same place I am
[6:20] of course you're just as much into it as
[6:22] I am
[6:23] you are messengers of this same message
[6:29] it's upon these three quotes some people
[6:32] believe a great one was supposed to rise
[6:34] after brother Ram's Ministry
[6:36] of course I don't believe that I believe
[6:38] brother Branham was this servant of God
[6:41] who was anointed with the spirit of
[6:42] Elijah this prophet of God this seventh
[6:45] angel to the laodicean church age this
[6:49] Elijah anointed prophet of Malachi
[6:51] chapter 4 verses 5 and 6. so here's the
[6:54] Four Points I want to make that are the
[6:56] reasons I believe brother Branham was
[6:59] that great one he mentioned or that
[7:01] servant of God and that there is no
[7:03] great one to rise after brother Branham
[7:07] Point number one I believe brother
[7:09] Brandon was just being humble in these
[7:10] quotes saying he looked for another and
[7:13] the proof of this is that there are
[7:15] multiple quotes where brother Bram
[7:17] didn't even claim to be a prophet and
[7:19] then there are other quotes where he did
[7:21] claim to be a prophet I believe brother
[7:23] Branham was just speaking in humility or
[7:25] perhaps in a human mistake when he said
[7:28] he was looking for a great one to come
[7:29] after him
[7:31] of course as any honest person knows not
[7:34] every word on brother Ram's tapes was
[7:36] thus saith the Lord as Jeffersonville
[7:38] falsely claims today
[7:40] brother Brandon said there's mix up on
[7:41] the tapes and I have numerous videos
[7:43] about this he said he made mistakes on
[7:45] tapes all the time but they were just
[7:47] human mistakes he was still a genuine
[7:50] prophet of God
[7:51] friends there are nine times brother
[7:53] Branham says quote I'm no Prophet end
[7:55] quote and you can look those up in your
[7:57] free time but let's look at a few quotes
[7:59] here in 1962 taking sides with Jesus
[8:02] brother random said quote I do not
[8:05] regard myself to be a prophet of the
[8:07] Lord I I haven't that honor end quote
[8:10] and then brother random explained why he
[8:12] didn't call himself a prophet and
[8:14] basically said his ministry didn't match
[8:17] the same style or isolation Ministry of
[8:20] Old Testament prophets but of course we
[8:23] know our other brand learned later and
[8:25] standing in the Gap sermon 1963
[8:27] he couldn't think of himself as an Old
[8:29] Testament Prophet because he was a new
[8:31] testament prophet he could not be
[8:33] isolated out in the wilderness he had to
[8:34] be with the people as Paul commanded in
[8:37] Hebrews chapter 10 verses 24 and 25 that
[8:40] the Saints must gather more together as
[8:42] they see that day approaching but let's
[8:44] listen to the quote from taking sides
[8:45] with Jesus
[8:47] I cannot go on the way I've been going
[8:51] because I'm the people
[8:54] has believed me I I have to say this I
[8:57] said before man
[8:58] the people many times regard me as being
[9:02] a prophet
[9:03] uh do not regard myself that no sir I do
[9:07] not I have I don't say that to be humble
[9:09] I say I have to be truthful
[9:11] I do not regard myself to be a prophet
[9:14] of the Lord I I haven't that honor
[9:19] if he did call me to be his prophet then
[9:23] I'm certainly not holding the office of
[9:25] one
[9:26] prophets don't Evangeline
[9:28] a prophet hides himself
[9:31] in the wilderness alone with God
[9:34] until he gets exactly directly what God
[9:37] wants him doing his talks right out he
[9:39] gives his message and back into the
[9:40] Wilderness he goes again
[9:43] he's not an advantage
[9:45] holding meetings and getting
[9:47] cooperations and all these things like
[9:49] advances do
[9:51] you don't teach sack of answers yes the
[9:55] day of the Lord and that's it and that's
[9:57] all
[9:57] Jesus pours it out and let the chips
[10:00] fall work willing that way he goes again
[10:04] nobody knows where he's at he's in
[10:05] isolation somewhere
[10:07] a prophet stays back here until he
[10:09] Stomps not into the hospital wherever
[10:11] he's going with thus saith the Lord and
[10:13] saving
[10:15] no advances no you don't hold meetings
[10:18] and this
[10:19] he's got the world of art for whoever he
[10:22] sent him
[10:24] so I see brother that's reason I don't
[10:26] call myself a prophet
[10:28] I'm not even in the office of one
[10:31] okay that's how you understand what I
[10:33] mean
[10:35] notice brother Brandon said a prophet
[10:37] doesn't hold meetings and discuss things
[10:39] but friends if you look in the scripture
[10:41] in Acts chapter 15 The First Church age
[10:44] messenger the prophet of God Saint Paul
[10:47] held a meeting in Jerusalem with James
[10:49] and Peter
[10:50] and all the apostles to answer the
[10:52] question about the Holy Ghost going to
[10:54] the Gentiles
[10:55] so we know the scripture is always right
[10:57] and so in this case brother Branham had
[10:59] not considered Acts chapter 15 and so
[11:01] here we see The Human Side of brother
[11:03] Branham proving that not every quote on
[11:05] tape from Brother Branham is thus saith
[11:08] the Lord because thus saith the
[11:10] scripture Acts chapter 15 shows a
[11:12] prophet holding meetings and discussing
[11:14] things with the brethren
[11:18] here's another quote from the spoken
[11:19] word is Original Seed brother Ram said
[11:21] quote I don't call myself a prophet I'm
[11:24] no Prophet but you said so end quote
[11:27] let's listen to the quote
[11:29] the Bible say the word of the Lord came
[11:31] to the prophets
[11:34] I don't call myself a prophet I'm no
[11:36] Prophet but you said so I'm saying what
[11:38] you said
[11:41] also here's a quote from 1964 questions
[11:44] and answers part two brother Brandon
[11:46] said quote I don't claim to be his
[11:47] Prophet many times I've said it when I
[11:49] didn't think I said it catch myself on
[11:51] the tape end quote
[11:53] so here brother random plainly
[11:54] distinguishes
[11:56] between his human side and the gifted
[11:58] prophetic side of his life
[12:01] when he was under the anointing of the
[12:03] Holy Ghost using his gift of discernment
[12:05] and the prophetic gift he would call
[12:06] himself a prophet but when he was not
[12:08] under that anointing he said I don't
[12:10] call myself a prophet let's listen to
[12:12] the quote
[12:13] so I am not
[12:16] the the anointed son of man
[12:19] I don't claim to be his Prophet many
[12:22] times I've said it when I didn't think I
[12:24] said it gets myself on the tape
[12:28] and before moving on to point two I just
[12:30] want to play this quote from questions
[12:32] and answers 1961 again showing brother
[12:35] random's Humanity in this quote brother
[12:37] Branham said quote I'm going to be as
[12:39] honest as I can be I don't think I'd
[12:41] have anything to do with that messenger
[12:43] end quote
[12:44] and of course he was talking about the
[12:46] seventh Church age messenger now friends
[12:48] if this doesn't prove not every word on
[12:50] tape is thus say the Lord nothing will
[12:52] because in the quote brother Branham
[12:54] said he had nothing to do with the
[12:56] seventh Church age messenger but then
[12:58] all of the scriptures and other quotes
[13:00] from brother Brandon prove he was the
[13:02] seven Church age messenger so this is a
[13:04] quote the leadership at Jeffersonville
[13:06] will likely ignore and I've asked him
[13:08] about this quote and they won't respond
[13:10] to it because if they say every word is
[13:12] thus say the Lord for brother Branham
[13:14] then it would be thus say the Lord
[13:16] Brother Branham could not be the seventh
[13:17] Church age messenger so of course
[13:19] they'll never answer this question or at
[13:21] least never answer it directly or
[13:23] sincerely let's listen to the quote
[13:26] now if you'll notice and our little
[13:29] witty out there put my name on that star
[13:31] out there and that's the reason I passed
[13:33] it over you see because I I don't think
[13:35] I'm gonna be honest as I can be I don't
[13:38] think
[13:39] I'd have anything to do with that
[13:40] messenger see that's right I believe it
[13:43] um maybe be sent for a part of this
[13:45] church to help build that message up to
[13:47] a place to work wood on this Forerunner
[13:50] for comes that he will come but I
[13:53] believe me being what I am I am uh uh I
[13:57] believe but I have the message of the
[14:00] day I believe that this is the light of
[14:02] the day and I believe it's important to
[14:05] that time coming you see
[14:08] also I found another quote regarding
[14:11] this topic as I Was preparing this video
[14:13] it's from the token message 1964. and
[14:16] brother Branham said that he was not the
[14:18] messenger and that Jesus Christ is the
[14:21] messenger
[14:22] so we have at least two quotes where
[14:23] brother Brown was so humble and said he
[14:25] had nothing to do with the seventh
[14:27] Church AIDS messenger and directly said
[14:29] he is not the messenger
[14:32] and again I believe brother random was
[14:34] the seven Church age messenger but here
[14:36] in these quotes we see how humble he was
[14:38] trying not to draw attention to himself
[14:40] or magnify himself let's listen to the
[14:43] quote
[14:44] that same Jesus Christ is here he is the
[14:47] messenger
[14:48] he is here is the message and he is
[14:52] the matter to identify
[14:56] her
[14:57] he is the messenger and this is the
[14:59] message and if you've got a spirit that
[15:01] disagrees with that how can it be the
[15:03] messenger of the message
[15:06] only the token will identify
[15:10] so now that we can see brother Ram's
[15:12] human side and his humility let's move
[15:14] on to point two brother Brown said young
[15:16] men not one man would preach the coming
[15:19] of the Lord
[15:20] and things that are to be 1965 just
[15:23] weeks before he passed away brother
[15:25] Branham said quote young men can take
[15:27] this message and sweep it on to the
[15:29] coming of the Lord end quote let's
[15:31] listen to the quote
[15:33] but I am very thankful for these open
[15:35] doors that have had to go into and The
[15:38] Inspirations gives a young man like your
[15:40] pastor here that's calls them as I'm
[15:42] beginning to get old and know that my
[15:44] days are numbered and Noah
[15:47] man can take this message and sweep it
[15:49] on to the coming of the Lord if he
[15:51] doesn't come and my generation which I'm
[15:54] hoping to see I'll look daily for him
[15:57] watch keeping myself prepared for that
[16:00] hour
[16:02] notice brother Graham said not one great
[16:05] one or not one great prophet only would
[16:08] sweep the message on to the coming of
[16:10] the Lord he said a group of young men
[16:12] would in other words more than one man
[16:14] so we see how right before brother
[16:16] Graham's death he never emphasized a
[16:19] great one to come he was emphasizing the
[16:21] five-fold ministry as also Ephesians
[16:23] chapter 4 verses 8 through 16 emphasizes
[16:26] and proves with thus say the scripture
[16:28] that a group of men have to preach the
[16:30] message of the hour and they will sweep
[16:32] it on to the coming of the Lord or the
[16:34] Rapture of the New Testament Church
[16:37] it's also notable that in birth pains
[16:39] 1965 brother Braham said men could take
[16:43] his message and quote make more sense to
[16:46] it to bring it to a place you would I
[16:49] just want to lay this seed then hope
[16:50] they can make it come to life end quote
[16:52] let's listen to the quote
[17:07] so these two quotes show brother random
[17:09] said young men or a group of men would
[17:12] preach the coming of the Lord and of
[17:15] course these quotes line up with
[17:16] Ephesians chapter 4 verses 8-16 and
[17:19] there is nothing in Ephesians 4 verses 8
[17:21] through 16 about a great one rising up
[17:23] like many falsely claimed today it will
[17:27] be the Holy Ghost filled New Testament
[17:29] Church that will rise up and they'll be
[17:31] led by the preaching of the fivefold
[17:32] ministry according to Saint Paul and
[17:34] Paul said to change one word of his
[17:36] gospel would make that person accursed
[17:39] Point number three brother random said
[17:41] with thus saith the Lord the Elijah
[17:44] anointed prophet of Malachi 4 verses 5
[17:47] and 6 was already on the earth in July
[17:50] of 1965.
[17:52] so this quote takes precedent over the
[17:55] 1962 taking sides with Jesus quote about
[17:58] the great one to come so this third
[18:00] proof was spoken with thus saith the
[18:03] Lord from Brother Branham that Malachi
[18:05] chapter 4 verses 5 and 6 would be a
[18:08] restoration Prophet Anointed with the
[18:09] spirit of Elijah
[18:11] and this Prophet was already on the
[18:13] earth in July of 1965. so brother Brown
[18:16] was not referring to Joseph Branham or
[18:18] any other man because there were no
[18:20] newspapers written about Joseph Branham
[18:22] and his ministry in July of 1965
[18:26] notice in brother Ram's quote as we'll
[18:28] hear in a moment he said there was an
[18:29] Elijah anointed Ministry on the earth
[18:32] already in July of 1965 that had
[18:35] newspaper articles written about the
[18:37] signs wonders of Miracles done through
[18:39] that Ministry so this thus saith the
[18:42] Lord's statement had to refer to brother
[18:43] Branham as being the prophet Anointed
[18:46] with the spirit of Elijah who would
[18:47] fulfill Malachi chapter 4 verses 5 and
[18:50] 6. let's listen to the quote
[18:52] the Bible says
[18:55] and he promised in the last days he
[18:57] would
[19:01] say people the children of God
[19:07] were to confirm the son of man in the
[19:10] United States the same as it was the
[19:11] start of yesterday today and forever
[19:13] yeah but he promised to do it and
[19:16] it's God's
[19:18] prepare the Lord
[19:20] notice
[19:22] they did the same same thing
[19:24] the motor did until God got enough of us
[19:30] I remember against the saith the Lord
[19:32] it'll come to pass in this day
[19:38] take every Clan take every man take
[19:41] every Church
[19:43] you had Christ's name to do this you
[19:45] preachers
[19:49] the newspapers are take consideration
[19:51] anywhere you want to go
[19:53] and see if it isn't on the Earth right
[19:55] now
[19:59] fourth and finally Point number four
[20:01] brother random said thus saith the Lord
[20:04] his ministry was the last sign to the
[20:06] Gentiles
[20:07] so again I believe this thus say the
[20:09] Lord's statement takes precedent over
[20:11] the 1962 quote from taking sides with
[20:14] Jesus about a great one to come
[20:16] in fact here's four quotes with us say
[20:18] the Lord that brother Adam's Ministry
[20:20] was the last sign to the Gentile Church
[20:22] before the rapture
[20:24] so we know with thus say the Lord
[20:26] nothing is going to rise after brother
[20:28] Adam's Ministry that was greater than
[20:30] his own Ministry
[20:32] it's thus saith the Lord the church age
[20:34] will never see any greater sign than
[20:36] brother Ram's gift of discernment his
[20:38] prophetic gift let's listen to the
[20:40] quotes
[20:43] [Applause]
[20:50] [Music]
[20:52] [Applause]
[20:57] said the word of God
[21:00] saith the holy spirit that speaks that
[21:03] knows the secret of the heart the save
[21:06] the Lord you are repeating your last
[21:10] call
[21:12] foreign
[21:13] [Music]
[21:22] [Applause]
[21:35] this is your last song
[21:40] write it in your Bible
[21:42] if something Rises besides this and
[21:45] greater than this call me a false
[21:46] prophet
[21:51] is right you're among you you'll just
[21:55] remember it just Faith the Lord you will
[21:59] never in any or more Gentile Church age
[22:03] ever see any sign to succeed this
[22:07] go greater this is the last time to the
[22:10] church
[22:14] [Applause]
[22:17] gonna respond
[22:19] [Music]
[22:21] [Applause]
[22:25] ing to things like this
[22:28] [Applause]
[22:38] in closing
[22:40] friends I hope this video was a blessing
[22:42] to you and I hope it proves beyond a
[22:44] shadow of a doubt that there was no
[22:46] great one to come after brother Branham
[22:48] friends were not looking for an eighth
[22:49] messenger we're not even looking for
[22:52] another seven Church age messenger we
[22:54] are looking according to the Bible unto
[22:57] Jesus the author and finisher of our
[22:59] faith
[23:00] and as we look to Jesus
[23:02] the Bible says we're transformed from
[23:03] Glory unto Glory we're spiritually
[23:06] transformed in our hearts and lives in
[23:08] our minds in our character our souls are
[23:11] baptized with the Holy Ghost and so our
[23:13] lives line up with the word of God they
[23:15] line up with Ephesians chapter 4 verses
[23:17] 8-16 how the fivefold ministry will
[23:20] bring us to a Unity of the faith
[23:22] and of course we believe this is done
[23:24] through the preaching of the Holy Ghost
[23:26] through the five-pole ministry preaching
[23:28] the revelations that God revealed to his
[23:29] Prophet brother William Branham so I
[23:32] want to thank Brother Tyrone for this
[23:33] question and I hope this answer was
[23:35] sufficient by the grace of God
[23:37] if you have any questions concerns or
[23:39] testimonies about this video please
[23:41] contact me
[23:43] God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[23:46] the desire of your heart
