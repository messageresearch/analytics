TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] I believe one of these glorious days when this United Confederation Church goes together and the new pope is brought out of the United States and put their accordion of prophecy. Greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of this video is to answer two questions related to the death of Pope Francis and the next pope that will be elected. Will the next pope be from the United States? And the second question is about how we should express the destiny of Pope St. Francis. So I think I'll start with the easiest question to answer. Is it right for a believer to say a false prophet has died? Pope Francis has died. A new addition to hell. Is this expression right? Pastor Smith. This is a great question. I personally think this is a little bit harsh. Truly, the Pope is a false prophet. When the pope speaks from St. Peter's Basilica, it is believed that he's speaking from the Lord. So that would make him a prophet. But the Pope does not speak for God Almighty. So yes, I believe the Pope is a false prophet. Now, the words a new addition to hell, that's going a little too far in my humble opinion because no man really knows the final destination of a person. We don't know if the Pope repented before he passed away. If he didn't, it's likely that he wasn't saved. It's likely that he did go to hell because of all the false teachings and false doctrines that he propagated throughout his entire life. You can find lots of videos where the pope believed all religions lead to heaven. Of course, that's a lie. Jesus said he's the only way. He's the way, the truth, and the life. According to John 14:6, the Pope made a declaration about blessing same-sex marriages. We believe that's heresy. You cannot bless what God has cursed. God has called homosexuality an abomination. And God taught that in the Old Testament and the New Testament. You find that Romans chapter 1 and 1 Corinthians chapter 6 along with other verses. So I would just say yes, a false prophet has died and it's likely he went to hell unless he repented of his sins. We hope he repented of his sins. The Bible said God does not delight in the death of the wicked. I believe that's in the book of Ezekiel. It's Ezekiel 33:11. Say unto them, as I live, sayaeth the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live. Turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways, for why will you die, oh house of Israel? Next, we'll get to the second question. Since the pope died, brother Brandham said, "We will have one from the USA. Is it about to be fulfilled?" And I don't know the answer to this question. I've only found one quote about this. It's from 1954. Now, I did try to search a little bit for it. There's seven quotes on the new pope and this is the only one where brother talked about a new pope from the United States. There's five quotes on pope plus the word federation. And there's two quotes on thus sayith the lord and pope but neither of them say thus sayith the lord. There will be a pope from the United States of America. So we don't know for sure as far as we don't have the assurance of thus sayith the lord. But we do have this quote from 1954. It's from December acts of the holy spirit. It's an evening service. I listened to the whole sermon yesterday and brother Ram only mentioned the pope one time in this service. It was in paragraph 87. Brother Ram's talking about how all the stones Solomon used were scattered about and these are the stones Solomon used to build his temple and they're all brought together and pieced together perfectly. Brother Ram was using that as a type of how the bride of Jesus Christ would be from all nations and brought together before the rapture. He used that symbolism many times. Then brother Ram said,"I believe one of these glorious days when this united confederation of church goes together and the new pope is brought out of the United States and put over there according to prophecy. Then they'll form an image like unto the beast. I tell you the true church of God will be drove together." So brother Ram says there is some prophecy. Now I don't know that prophecy. If someone knows of that prophecy, please share it with me. I'll share with all the viewers here by the grace of God. My best guess is that brother Ram is referring just to the prophecy in the Bible. Daniel 2 shows us that Rome will rule at the end time. And brother Ram said, "Thus sayith the Lord." Rome will rule at the end time. Not Russia, not China. Rome will rule with thus sayith the Lord. And then we know Revelation 17:3 says, "This woman rides the beast and the beast is the spirit of Rome and the woman is the Roman Catholic Church." So the gentile power ruling will be the spirit of Rome at the end time and the Roman Catholic Church will have the power of this spirit of Rome. And who is the head of the Roman Catholic Church? It is of course the pope of Rome. And then Revelation 13 11-18 shows the United States of America laying down the mark. Brother Ram taught on numerous occasions that Revelation 13 11-18 is the spirit of Rome in the United States. And then brother Ram said in spoken word is the original seed in 1962 which he also repeats in the church age book when the Holy Spirit told him to pick up the pen and write. Brother Ram said according to Revelation 13:16 the bride will be forced to stop preaching. So that's one important sign I believe that the bride will know the squeeze is on. the raptures very near when the bride is forced to stop preaching by this ecumenical movement or the federation of churches with the Roman Catholic Church. So I think with these three scriptures, brother Ram was trying to show that he believes since the United States will be a major player in the end time, the spirit of Rome is now in the United States. Brother Ram said JFK and Jacle Kennedy was a move of the Roman Catholic Church to get power in the United States. That based upon these verses, a pope would have to come out of the United States. Now, that's just my best guess. I don't know for sure, but let's first listen to the quote from 1954, Acts of the Holy Spirit, the new pope is brought out of the United States according to prophecy. Let's listen to the quote. And when this cut this way and one that way, they couldn't understand. But when they went to put it together, the whole thing was laying on the ground. And they put it block on block on block and didn't have to cut no more. I believe one of these glorious days when this United Confederation Church goes together and the new pope is brought out of the United States and put on their accordion of prophecy. Then they'll form an image black into the beast. And I tell you, the true church about to be drawn together. the real true believers out of Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian, Pentecostals, Nazarene, Pilgrim, Holiness, whatever they'll be will go together, cemented by the love of God. That'll make the body of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. All the believers and agnostics and shallow mind. It'll be cast to one side. They'll go right away into the Confederation Churches. Here's another good quote I thought I'd share. It is a thus sayith the Lord from hearing, recognizing, acting on the word of God. February 21st, 1960, Brother Ram said, "The churches, though unite with Catholicism, thus saith the Lord." Let's listen to the quote. Now, the church life is at the end. The normal church, the church, now this may stick just a little bit, but the church carnal, the Esau church, she's come to her end. What's she doing? Heading up in the Federation of Churches, which will finally join with Romanism to fight Catholic. uh with Catholicism to fight communism. Pope John is calling for all the churches to come back and they will and they'll unite themselves together just exactly what thus sayeth the Lord. You say, "Wait a minute, Brother Bram, you're getting off the line. If I am, God wrote his Bible off the line." You have to be Michael on this case. Amen. So, friends, in closing, this is a great question. This question comes up every time there's a new pope since I've been in the message. It's happened twice. 2005 when Pope Benedict became the pope and then 2013 when Pope Francis was elected as the new pope. So we'll see who the new pope is. Perhaps it'll be Timothy Dolan, the Archbishop of New York. He came he became famous when Pope Francis visited him. I think it was in 2015 there in New York and he became more prominent during COVID doing a lot of media tours. So this is just my humble thought. He seems to be the most prominent American bishop or archbishop. So perhaps it'll be Timothy Dolan. But some reports say the pope has to be able to speak lots of languages. So I don't know how many languages Timothy Dolan knows. So I really don't know. That's just my best guess by the grace of God. So if you have other quotes from brother Bram that talk about prophecy regarding a American pope, please share with me. I'd love to see it and I'll share it by the grace of God. Friends, let's keep watching and praying for the coming of the Lord. He appears to all those that love his appearing. As St. Paul said, as the Lord Jesus told us, he said, "Watch and pray that you enter not into temptation." So, that's powerful advice for us in any time and season of our lives. Watch and pray. Prayer and the Holy Ghost will help us overcome temptation. If you have any questions, concerns, or testimonies about this video, please contact me. God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart. very happy to be here this afternoon and again in defense of the gospel of Jesus Christ to bring the good tidings, the good news that Jesus raised from the dead, living among man today, his church. The same Jesus that was yesterday will be today and forever. He is never failed. [Music]
