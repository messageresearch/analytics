just call this lesson uh lessons from angels so we'll look at that and we'll try to preach as much as we can about angels i think just a beautiful uh scripture maybe to start with is luke 15 let me just read that one by god's grace luke 15. luke 15 8-10 what a beautiful picture here of angels having joy over sinners that repent angels are very much like humans aren't they they're very much like it a lot of emotions uh fighting we'll see they're warriors uh and so a beautiful picture here uh jesus's parable of the lost coin and uh we just see a beautiful picture here of angels rejoicing over these uh souls that are saved praise god you always wonder what how many angels were shouting when i repented how many angels were shouting when you gave your life to love imagine a lot of them by god's grace let's read the luke 15. i'll read eight nine that one will read ten together luke 15 8 says either what woman having ten pieces of silver if she lose one piece doth not light a candle and sweep the house and seek diligently till she find it see how god is diligently seeking for you he sought us diligently until he found us verse nine and when she had found it she called her friends and her neighbors together saying rejoice with me for i found the peace which i'd lost likewise i say unto you there is joy in the presence of the angels of god over one sinner that repents praise the lord let's have a word of prayer if you haven't done your heart just let's make it known unto god here what a joy what a joy to think heaven rejoicing over us being saved what a privilege heavenly father we just come to you tonight lord we read your word we've sang your songs who are we lord we're nothing on our own god but with you lord we have christ in us the hope of glory and you've called us to be sons and daughters lord help us to live up to this high calling lord we're pressing on towards the mark of the high calling in christ jesus tonight bless your people in the house of the lord that could press up here lord god i pray give them some spiritual blessing here tonight let your angels minister to them i pray lord god and heavenly father we just ask you to be with those live streaming or those are watching on the archive to be blessed by the holy spirit father and we know lord god that we have need of this we need you more every hour uh we gather more as we see that day approaching so lord we're fulfilling that scripture tonight you know we remember last sunday lord as we had the communion we remember lord uh that we're partaking of you here tonight spiritually which is just as important as that natural one if not more so lord so i pray we'd partake of your your bread and your wine here tonight let's have communion and fellowship in jesus christ's name and saint said amen praise god god bless you again praise god all right so uh by god's grace i have numerous scriptures to go over i want to look up one real quick uh let's go to hebrews chapter one i think we'll start there hebrews 1 7. and i have a correction by the amen and wendy and hua i had yesterday i said something wrong so i'll correct it about the angel bodies so i just realized that as i was starting the scripture i made a little mistake so let's go to hebrews one and i looked and looked and looked on facebook for about five minutes i couldn't find that video of the angel but if i find it i'll share with you one of the saints from guyana posted it it must have been a couple weeks ago because i i looked and i couldn't find it and just uh neat to see the boy's leg lifted and moved over right on time our god is able praise god now who was it in the testimonies that said they thought they'd entertain an angel was that karen when she gave her testimony does anybody remember that okay she's not so i thought it was karen too that she answered a stranger and then looked away and then when she come back it was gone i think it was right outside of her house oh yeah that's right and her mom kind of corrected her i said and said i need to entertain angels next time so interesting very wonderful to see that hebrews 1 7. here's a good place to start defining uh angels uh in hebrews 1 verse 7. and i'm looking at another one now real quick let's read this one and we'll go to verse 4. i shouldn't say real quick i'm nervous i don't want to go too long so let me not be in such a hurry hebrews 1 7 and of the angels he saith who maketh his angels spirits and his ministers of flame of fire all right so we know in the in in the uh the bible their makeup is a spiritual being it's a celestial body right there's two kinds of body there's terrestrial natural bodies like we have and there's celestial spiritual bodies the glorified is a combination of both praise god but a theophany is as a celestial uh it's different so an angel has a theophany body and notice what they are they're ministers right they're ministers the actual word angel we know means messenger so there are ministers and messengers uh and they minister according to god's will and notice a flame of fire so sometimes you know the the chariots of fire right that took elijah home angels right we must been angel uh horses and chariots and bye what a what a beautiful picture that is praise god and so angels here are sent from god they're god's servants they can become they're fiery now go up to verse 4 hebrews 1 4 this just says just a good scripture about jesus jesus's human body angels were more powerful than jesus's human body remember jesus said he said without the father i can do nothing right so jesus human body was exactly that human it had no sin nature though that's what made it different from ours add word nature hebrews 1 4 being made so much better than the angels as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they all right it seems like i'm missing a scripture that doesn't seem like the one i wanted to read yeah yeah he has an excellent more excellent name than that one oh i'm sorry it's verse 14. there it is sorry i knew there was another one in chapter one let's go to hebrews 1 13 let's read 13 and 14. but to which of the angels said he at any time sit on my right hand until i make thine enemies thy footstool this is showing how no angel has ever been exalted to the place of christ right that's not reserved for them it was reserved for jesus verse 14 are they not all ministering spirits sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation praise god praise the lord so they're sent forth to minister so when god does something supernatural many times it will be an angel praise god we'll say the holy spirit and you know generally speaking it's the same spirit but scripturally many times it's an angel right it's an angel doing the will of god praise the lord uh so we started hebrews one it's a great chapter for angels now scripturally the first uh chronological angel appearance is revelation 12 as far as the first mentioned before you know human history so let's go to revelation 12 there are so many beautiful secrets in revelation 12. what a tremendous chapter of so much importance revelation 12. ram calls this uh the chapter about israel he said there's no there's nothing to do with the gentile bride chapter 12 has nothing to do with the gentile bride all right so uh we know the vision for the first two verses and then satan in verses uh three and four and then the christ child in verses five and six so verse seven is where we start with the origin of angels as far as the the first uh time of record i think that we have uh well now i'm thinking of another one i'm not thinking of job where the angels of god shouted for joy at the foundation of the world that might be the actual first one sorry there's uh 283 hits on angels in the bible so i didn't get through all of them um so just i'm just trying to do a review today so let's look at that one revelation 12 7 and there was war in heaven michael and his angels now see his angels so michael members called the arch archangel which it means chief angel so he's the chief michael was the chief angel uh and his angel so the chief had ones that belonged to him now we were talking about this yesterday there's there's a hierarchy and i think it's typed out beautifully in the days of david because david had captains over thousands and ten thousands and even hundreds so there was this order of hierarchy amongst the soldiers how much more the heavenly soldiers now we know demons have hierarchy right as well because the prince of persia right was over the persian kingdom uh then there was demons that just stayed in the in gattera right that they begged jesus they said don't make us leave the demons are territorial like the persian the demon the demon over persia territorial demon over gatherer territorial so they have territories right and brother ram says you go to one nation they have a certain spirit right he said some are really really military spirits fighters others are he said america's entertainment so entertainment demons and so you have all these different and they're territorial and so we've got to be aware of that and and church really like this the only way to get salvation is to break through some of those powers right to pray through until something somebody gets a breakthrough praise god hallelujah and so you see uh the order there's an order hierarchy with archangels uh now he fought angels thoughts or angels are fighters warriors uh and against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels and prevail not neither was there found any more place in heaven all right now then verse nine and the great dragon was cast out that old serpent which called the devil and satan which deceiveth the whole world was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him jesus said i saw like lightning fall from heaven imagine that lightning strikes and that was angels falling down to the earth adam and eve's earth imagine enjoying eden it's all beauty and all of a sudden lightning strikes and now demons are lurking everywhere you know because they're cast out of heaven down to earth so uh we see that now there's a scripture about okay now verse 10 and i heard a loud voice saying in heaven now has come salvation and strength and kingdom of our god and power and his christ for the accused of our brotherness cast down which accuses them before our god day and night so the man tells us like job there's demons constantly accusing us day and night but the blood of jesus christ is there to tell the devil that the the sins are put in the sea of forgetfulness praise god and he remembers them no more praise the lord now i want to look at the one the third part of heaven yeah verse four sorry i did skip over that there's look there's so much in this chapter about angels uh verse four and his tale drew the third part of the stars of heaven and did cast them to the earth and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be devoured to be delivered rather for to devour her child as soon as it was born so a third of the angels uh were demons now i'm looking for the scripture here yeah hebrews 12 22 honey can you pull that up there if you got your bible you can turn there hebrews 12 22. now we know um the bible uses hyperbole how many know what that is hyperbole is like an exaggeration right so the bible uses hyperbole so the bible says an innumerable company but like does god know the number yeah right does god know so that's hyperbole for us humans can't number it but god knows the number right uh the bible uses hyperbole all the time like uh when israel was getting uh surrounded the bible said there was uh there was chariots without number i think in the days of the judges uh the days of the kings and there were the number was the sand of the sea so the bible is using hyperbole it's a huge number right but god knows the number and so there's a large number of angels god knows the number right to us it's innumerable because we can't count that high but a third of them were deceived through lucifer right and so that's the beginning here of where we see angels all right now there's so many points here i didn't have time to really get them in order like i wanted to oh yeah let's go to job 38 then let's look at the actually the first one uh when the angels shouted at the foundation of the earth remember angels had to be created before the earth uh so if lucifer was cast to the earth the earth had to be there for lucifer to be cast down too so the earth had to be there i'm sorry the angels had to be there first now job 38 four i have seven as well thirty eight four the term job job 38 4. all right thank you hun where was thou when i laid the foundations of the earth declare if thou has understanding go go to verse 7 please who hath laid the measures thereof if thou knowest or who has stretched the line upon it you go to verse 7 please when the morning stars sang together and all the sons of god shouted for joy praise god now this is a good topic vang emailed me about this one time vang had a great question he said are these sons actual sons of god or are they angels well in this case i think they're angels okay uh and that's because of job so let's go to job the bible said the sons of god came to present themselves before the lord let me know what i'm talking about anybody okay is that new all right so job job one job one verse six so this is where god is hiding a mystery right the bible said the sons of god shouted for joy and people think that was actually humans but brother abraham says no you you were not you were just a thought of god before you came to the earth you didn't exist as a pre-existent soul i mean how many remember that from the church age book anybody remember that one you were not a pre-existent soul like talking in heaven and walking around in heaven you know flying around or whatever you were in the mind of god right i broke that said you weren't aware of it you were just in his mind just like a a natural child is in their father right right the seed is in the father and you're not aware of it you're not having fellowship with your dad you're just in your dad okay and so this is where a mystery lays because the sons of god saw the daughters of men that was human men but then the bible said when the sons of god shouted for joy at the foundation of the earth that was angels praise god so it's hidden now there was a day when the sons of god came to present themselves before the lord and satan uh came also among them so this has to be angels so you'll be really careful with the scripture right or else people get twisted up in their doctrine okay so thank god that the message came to us the brother man told us right after god you know made himself a light a theophany the logos he made angels next amen because he said the angels have to have something to worship they have to see something to worship right so they had to be able to see the light of god right the logos the body of god for god to dwell in all right so uh that's a good place to start oh here's another one i forgot hebrews 2 9. uh here's where men are a little lower than angels okay so this even goes back to jesus's body hebrews 2 9. remember church we are creators how many believe you're a creator right and brother man tells us that even the rap says even magicians can get so much into their mental powers that they can break glass remember that the babe talked about that he said that's just the human mind he said what about faith he said then you can move mountains and raise the dead and heal the sick and all those things like that he said so see humans have this access to this spiritual power praise god uh but they're not as high as angels okay but we see jesus who is made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death so angels can't die right they can't die physically because they don't have a physical body crown with glory and honor that he by the grace of god should taste death for every man so an angels doesn't have a physical body can't taste death can't die so god had to create himself a human body to dwell in take it to the cross to pay for our sins amen praise god so jesus a little lower we're a little lower as well but we have the spiritual s we have the spirit in us right which gives us access uh to the supernatural realm all right okay so now i got that got that um let's look at the strength of angels so psalms 103 20. can you pull it up there here we see the strength of angels i love this part about angels psalms 103 20. how many know angels like worshiping god too how do you know when we're worshiping today during service we weren't the only ones angels are worshipping too the bible said bless the lord me his angels the angels worship right that excel and strength that do his commandments hearkening unto the voice of his word you see that original two-thirds of the angels they had to make that decision right they had to make the decision i'm going to continue to keep the commandments i'm going to continue to do what god said very similar to us right we've got to decide every day we have to die daily to do god's commandments praise god to keep his charge to be his messengers how many want to be a messenger praise god and deliver god's message to your friends family co-workers praise god so there's a lot of similarities between us and messengers remember malachi means my messenger that's why i chose it uh because i like that of a man being the messenger for god and i'm one of god's messengers praise god so that's the next ones let's look at uh here's a good one psalm 63 9 psalm 63 9. psalm 63 9. this is what i was talking about earlier many times when there's supernatural things we'll just say it's the holy spirit but technically it could be an angel of god as well right but see the angel of god is anointed with the holy spirit that's what the bible says uh psalms i'm sorry it's isaiah 63 9 my father isaiah isaiah my phone so angels are anointed with god's spirit right how many remember the anointed cherub how do you remember that lucifer's called the anointed cherub anointed with what well at one time he was anointed with god's right spirit right at one time he was perfect nothing wrong in him but then pride was found in his heart okay so uh here we go in all their affliction he was afflicted and the ain't there it is the angel of his presence the messenger of his presence the angels minister the holy spirit praise god they minister god's spirit to us save them in his love and his pity he redeemed them and he bear them and he carried them all the days of old praise god see angels bring the presence of god the blessings of god to his people amen let's look at uh zechariah 5 9. here's one of the first videos i made against believe the sign to try to bring correction to them and i i thought about making it one of the questions but i i think it was as important as the other questions so i believe the sign says zechariah 5 9 is women angels but there's no such a thing zechariah 5 9 then i lifted up my eyes and looked and behold there came out two women and the wind was in their wings you have women with wings right or they had wings like the wings of a stork which is an unclean bird so it tells us right away these are unclean spirits okay and they lifted up the ifa now if it was a basket for bread between the earth and the heaven now go to verse 10. then said i to the angel that talked with me whither do these bear the ephod verse 11. and he said to me to build it and house in the land of china how many know what shinar was babylon and it shall be established and set there upon her own base her so this is israel this is a vision zechariah sees of israel being carried away to babylon by two women with wings which historically were babylon and assyria when they carried away israel and took him into captivity okay so now believe the sign will use that verse 9 and they'll say see women have angels william branham is wrong so women can preach you know no no no wrong wrong angels are only men praise god only men are because they're messengers of the word of god right now to prove that you've got to have proof right uh go back to revelation 12. this chapter is just chock full mind it's just loaded with revelation what would we do without the book of revelation it solves so many doctrinal issues uh it just gives us the it's the unveiling that's what the word means unveil it's the truth unveiled before us praise god revelation 12. all right now verse 13. and when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child now he's cast to the earth after the rapture this is when he persecutes israel verse 14. and to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle that she might fly into the wilderness into her place where she is nourished for a time times and half a time from the face of the serpent now a time is a year and i don't have the scripture on that but a time and times and a half three and a half so it's three and a half years so this woman has wings and she's carried away from the serpent right and it's israel being carried away for three and a half years spiritually and she's uniting to the two prophets because the next verse says she's fed for three and a half years who she's what is she fed and who's she fed by it's got to be somebody with the word of god right what feeds you the word of god right the word of god is your food verse 15 and the serpent cast out his mouth i'm sorry out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman that he might cause her to be carried away the flood and the earth helped the woman and the earth opened her her mouth and swallowed up the the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth and the dragon was wroth with the woman and went to make war with the remnant of her seed okay 144 000 is the remnant of israel which keep the commandments of god and have the testimony of jesus christ there it is when the 144 thousand receive jesus christ they're gonna make war against it right so that's when satan makes war against the 144 thousand okay you nourish yeah so nourish in verse 14 means fed okay and notice how many wings did she have two so this scripture uh revelation 12 14 proves that a nation is represented by a woman and a nation with wings just represents a nation on the move right so if we go back to zechariah the two women were two nations that were taken israel carrying her off to babylon there's no women angels some of us got to be careful on the message i've seen message people post memes and they got women angels on them or baby angels with wings you'd never see a thing in the scripture right it's like brother man said that what was the angel i think he said it was six foot two is that right the ramp said he's two i know he said he's 200 pounds right 200 pounds i thought he said he was six foot two two hundred pounds ram was like five was he five three or five four he was shorter man but strong in the word tremendously strong in the word seventh angel with the word but the the angel was six foot two two hundred pounds large and he said he had fierce eyes and you know hair down to the shoulder and so angels are always men all right now let's go to hebrews 13 1-2 and here's where we start getting into the bodies of angels hebrews 13 1-2 all right now look at look at the context here in chapter 12 he just said god is a consuming fire uh he's got god's gonna take he's gonna shake all the nations and then he jumps after this great warning he jumps into verse one let brotherly love continue i just love the bible writers right they they build up all this judgment and wrath and and then they go i love everybody now i love your brother like we saw with the philippians right paul will warn them and say these are a bunch of dogs i'm weeping with tears stay away from these dogs and then he gets back into be united in your minds love one another set your affections on things above they just as they're led by the holy spirit let bloody love continue be not forgetful to entertain strangers i don't know about you but i have a hard time sometimes with strangers because i'm just concerned about all the evil in this world right it's the days of noah and there's wickedness right everywhere um for thereby some have entertained angels unawares okay so the bible tells us church don't be for don't forget about that and in karen in karen's case you know she said she learned a lesson to entertain angels so you have to remember if they're strangers uh the bible said don't forget try to remember it might be an angel of god now that'd be something extremely tremendous wouldn't it now how many raise your hand how many think you have entertained angel anybody want to share it with anybody all right i guess brother van because brother man says when somebody repents angels visit your home so i was preaching years ago when acacia and lydia gave their heart to the lord i was preaching those months right before that about zechariah and elizabeth and living such a godly life until the angels visit your home so i was i was kind of presuming saying angels visited my home and led my girls to repent because i still remember the morning when you walked i was studying outside and she walked around and was weeping and gave her heart to the lord there acacia so i'm just presuming but i don't know you might know you might know a literal angel visited you but the bible tells us not not to be forgetful because when we entertain angels i'm sorry entertain strangers it may be angels now i looked up quotes on this and brother branham he uses this to reference genesis 18. so let's go to genesis 18 which is a type of our day right it's a type of the rapture the last visit thus saith the lord the last sign before the rapture genesis 18. okay so remember verse one the lord appeared unto him in the plane of mamrie and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day okay then he sees three men i'm just gonna skip down a little bit and so abraham gets so excited honey go kill the animal you know let's make some butter and bread and meats and this where brother said god's not a vegetarian god eats meat now you might be healthier in the long run right eating vegetables only but god was not a vegetarian so uh let's uh verse eight and he took the butter and milk and the calf quite a meal there which he addressed and said it before them and he stood by them under the tree and they they did eat so here's where i made the mistake yesterday sister when uh so angels have a celestial body but god can put a physical body like brother man said like a vacuum cleaner suck up the the molecules right the dust and create a physical body and they can eat okay so but ram said that was jesus's theophany the vampire was jesus logos he said the logos come down and picked up all the particles to make a flesh body and then ate so i was wrong so forgive me i was wrong yesterday it wasn't fresh on my mind uh but god see god because remember the two angels went down to sodom but god stayed with abraham amen god's saying with abraham seed praise god that's us hallelujah and so we have this uh idea here where angels can put on a fleshly body but here's the key they can't change into a physical body so they can't leave from being a theophany and leave that and become a full man okay and here's the quote brotherham says put it on the whole armor of god he said when the sons of god saw the daughters of men he said the historians thought the sons of god he said it was fallen angels that pressed themselves into human flesh and seen women and how appealing that woman was and these sons of god became flesh but the man said if you take it that way my precious brother you're smarter than i am if you do that you make the devil a creator so the devil cannot create he just perverts what god's created that was a good point i wouldn't i forgot about that satan cannot create he could only pervert right so angels cannot create their own bodies with human seed right because they'd have to create their own human body and human seed in order to mix with the human egg right they can't do that but angels can possess human bodies and make humans do things because that's what every demon is right a demon is a fallen angel and where do they possess people in their minds right they're human spirits so demons can get in people's spirits but they can't change from a spirit to a physical they can't create themselves their own physical body and get out of that theophany and then be in a human body because then they'd be a creator okay so quite a subject that's got some deep questions brother you guys he was asking about the millennium yesterday i'm like i don't know brother i'll give you my guess like i told you i'll give you my guess but i don't know some of these things are so mysterious that god has kept them to reveal to us later praise god all right so uh that's one example of an entertaining angel remember samson's parents remember samson's mom met the angel she went home and told her hubby hey come over here let's look go again the angel came again and they they made the cake and then the angel ascended and they knew god was god and angel let them know you're gonna have a son named samson uh god visited gideon he said mighty man of valor see the angel knew his potential praise god god knows your potential too praise god brother man i really appreciate that i'm gonna i was thinking about that all week brother bang lying vanities see brother that's where we can be mighty men of valor ever understand that in a situation where it looks like everything is lost just quote the word quote the word lying behind and brother that makes us that makes us conquer that makes us more than conquerors in christ jesus i've been thinking about that off and on all week any problem i've just had said i've just said lying vanity line vanity praise god because that's that's when we are mighty men of valor that's when we are the sons of god that we should be praise god when we're quoting god's word hallelujah that's where i think that we can see in our lives where wow we're more than human god has given us this supernatural ability as long as we as long as we abide in god's will and obey god's leading then we see his supernatural hand that's right okay i'm just going down through my notes here real quick okay so yeah um let's then go to genesis 6 1 and 2 just to read that since we're already here so angels can take on a physical body and eat uh but they can't create their own body and then have their own seed life they can't do that okay dennis so that's why genesis 6 1-2 is not fallen angels it's fallen believers men that have fallen short of the glory of god remember in those days church remember they could only be justified and sanctified how many remember that they couldn't get the baptism in the soul they could only be justified and sanctified so these were sons of god that were of the rights lineage but they made uh they made an awful mistake on the second biggest decision of their lives and god said this is awful this is causing all this unbelief and i'm going to flood the earth because of it see how important our marriages are by god's grace see how important that is genesis 6 1-2 and it came to pass when men began to multiply on the face of the earth and daughters were born unto them that the sons of god saw the daughters of men that they were fair and they took them wives of all which they chose now look even in verse three if you look at the context god's not saying uh my spirit shall not always drive with angels right he's saying my spirit shall not always strive with man so we gotta look at the context and where the verse four is the giants there were giants in the earth in those days uh and also after that when the sons of god came in unto the daughters of men and they bear children to them the same became men mighty men of which were of old men of renown so these uh these marriages between the sons of god and the serpent seed created this intellectual race that's what we got today right intellectualism instead of faith in god's word so we see so many parallels from there to today how much time we got okay again i've been going about half an hour okay so let me look at the next one here angel was present all right let's go to psalms about and camp the angel lord and camp about those that fear the lord so let me pull it up here uh psalms 34 7. okay so this word and camp means to decline or go down to to bend down uh to lay siege against to encamp okay so it's to come down and be with so psalms 34 7 the angel of the lord and campeth round about them that fear him and delivereth him okay so you would think of an unbeliever right what does the unbeliever have they're full filled with fallen demons right right they're called like the maniac of godera he's filled with demons right but because he didn't fear the lord but a man that fears the lord he's got the protection of the lord praise god okay so here's where that question came with guardian angels now there's just a few quotes wendy went through him thoroughly more thoroughly than i did yesterday brother ram says garden angels a couple of times uh but he never preaches a whole sermon on it like i was sharing yesterday we gotta be really careful uh what we make a major doctrine and what we just keep at a minor doctrine like brother branham did okay so the question is do we have a guardian angel i personally think we do um because of this the angel lord in camps around them that fear him uh and delivereth them and then remember they rejoice when you get saved so they're you know by god's four knowledge he knows you're going to repent eventually right so he has his angel there protecting just like oh just like moses in that ark all those crocodiles want to eat them but the angels of the lord are right there saying get back get back i'm protecting my holy seed praise god god only it was only four dollars right moses was a baby he wasn't saved yet but it was god by foreknowledge protecting that art praise god amen so the angel lord encampeth round about them that fear him and delivereth him uh let me uh type i'm looking for this one it's just coming to me now okay yeah go to matthew 18. this is this is the scripture where brother man uses it for a uh he uses it for a uh guardian angel and this may be now brother amen had a good question too is the angel always there not that i don't know that it could go back up and down i don't know um it would come down when you need it right it's it's sent to help uh so or it could be there the whole time i'm not really sure i can't really think of a scripture that would answer that for sure or not because if if this is if this is speaking of an angel um then the bible says they're always beholding the father's face in heaven if that would mean the father would say go down there protect wendy go down there protect jesse right if that's the right interpretation so matthew 18 10 take heed that you despise not one of these little ones for i say unto you that in heaven their angels do oh there it is they're angels they're angels theirs belongs to them right assigned to them their angels do always always behold the face of my father which is in heaven okay so i could be wrong on this but it looks like this is a guardian angel scripture because even the little ones have angels protecting them praise god thank god for that all right so beautiful scripture there beholding the face of my father which is in heaven now i've used i don't know if you remember this or not bang might remember but i use this scripture in the past with amen to possibly refer to theophanies because brother brown used it the theophanies it's in who is this melchizedek so brother brandon uses this in two different ways he uses it as you have a guardian angel but then he uses it and who's this melchizedek as your theophany's waiting there which paul says you have a body eternal the heavens now here's a little deeper then some people believe your theophany is your angel and it's just your body but i don't believe that i don't believe that i don't some people some people it may be but i don't believe that uh because see they put these two quotes together with these two scriptures and they say well my theophanies in heaven obama uses and then uh that's my angel my angel is my fiance i don't believe that i believe uh i believe angels are their own separate individual beings and i believe they're worshippers praise god i believe i believe they're rejoicers they're warriors praise god uh that's just my opinion i could be wrong but is that something that uh is that something to get upset about with your brother and say hey let's fight you know let's have a cold war is that something is that something to split a church over brotherhood no it's just so so minor like instead of worrying about that why don't we just get instead of fighting over that why don't we fight the devil in prayer i try to get somebody saved by god's grace you see so we got to be very careful especially in the message not to let satan exalt us in pride and say well i know more about it than this person and then argue and debate over minor things okay and i always want to have this attitude lord i can always learn more i can always grow in grace and knowledge of the lord all right you always want to have that a humble attitude okay so their angels all right so there so it really truly does look like each of us have a guardian angel from that scripture if it's applied in that way okay uh let's go all right there's just so many good ones here let's go to uh second king six fifteen and sixteen this is elisha i kept saying elijah this morning it's elisha elisha at gotham okay elisha second kings 6 15 and 16. can you put that up there casey when you got a chance and so this is where i don't know um how many angels we have assigned to us um and i'm not sure why there was such a huge multitude maybe it was all of israel's angels i don't know and when the servant of the man of god was risen early and gone forth behold and host compasses city both with horses and chariots and the servant said in them alas my master how shall we do and he answered fear not for they that be with us are more than they that be with them talk about seeing in the other dimension praise god the prophet by the way he's not even sweating a drop surrounded by enemies he's like don't worry about it there's more with us than with them next verse acacia verse 17 and elisha prayed and said lord i pray thee open his eyes that he may see and the lord opened the eyes the young man he saw and behold the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire around about elisha my how many are here tonight church amen glory how are you here tonight around god's people praise god i say this scripture comforted me when i first went to guyana it's my first time in a third world country we drove from the airport over then to georgetown but amen we drove by armed guards with uh ak-47s and ar-15s i'm like i'm gonna die here but i just but they just looked at the car you know and let it go and i realized later it's because god's angels are with us praise god and i'm reminded of that now that time i was really nervous but as you go on and learn you realize that if god before you who can be against you so angel armies that's what that song chris thomas sings the god of angel armies praise god he said open the eyes that our servant can see all the angels that surround us amen thank you jesus now there's three kinds of angels in scripture seraphim cherubim and archangel now there could be more because i didn't amen i didn't devote a lot of hours to this in fact i didn't devote any time to studying yesterday i never any time i just looked at it between services so there could be more but there's at least three kinds of angels uh the word archangel means the chief of the angels it's the highest rank okay cherubims um the definition is just cherubim and it looks like they're thrown guards okay that's what it looks like because they they always guard uh they always guard the presence of god right and there was cherubims on the mercy seat so you have archangel the chief angel then you have cherubims uh and then we know they surround the throne or around god's presence there and then their seraphims which are the word actually means fiery or burners and so these are angels that do the heavenly worship service so there's at least three kinds can anybody think of any other kinds of angels okay just those three i'm just curious if anybody can remember i just saw that like i like your help when you can give me some help and so every now and then i'll ask you for some help because i didn't get a lot of chance to study on that one um but yeah remember exodus 25 the cherubims faced each other had two wings and they were next to the mercy sea of uh the ark of god where god communed with the high priest okay so we've always thought michael and lucifer were the cherubims but then michael when lucifer got cast down then michael would have been the highest angel the archangel but i could be wrong on that there could be something else but that's just what we have uh as far as our understanding right now all right so let's look at the next one uh let's go to matthew 22. coming down to close i got about 15 minutes here let's uh finish up here by god's grace i appreciate everybody's attention tonight by god's grace and also different more like a teaching and not really rebuking sin or anything like that just trying to increase your faith and teach you the word of god here tonight matthew 22 25. matthew 22 25. while you're turning there i still think remember i told you that story when i was driving to football practice in college my my buddy was driving 90 miles per hour we spun across three you know four lanes if you include the exit lane and we stopped god's our witness uh got we stopped maybe three inches from that concrete barrier and he couldn't even get out because his window or his door was right up against there couldn't get out we both had to climb out and as soon as we came to a stop all the trucks came flying by now what was that church that's angels of god amen right ministering protecting god's seed amen god needed a pastor in akron praise god amen that's his grace that's his grace to me but how i mean what other awful things we didn't flip or anything we just went you're just like uh 180s uh sure what's the circle eights what are those called what is it three sixties yeah i'm thinking of the eight one figure eight there it is yeah thanks brother that's the one i was thinking but just figure eight across and the 360 until it came to a perfect stop right there no damage to any of us uh just amazing grace i'll say like this same by inches say by inches god's mercy so matthew 22 as i have on here 25 to 33 but we won't read all that uh for time's sake jesus is uh answering the sadducees questions who's this woman going to marry in the resurrection right she each of her husbands dies she's married seven different brothers who's she gonna marry in the resurrection verse 29 jesus answered and said unto them you ye do air not knowing the scriptures nor the power of god for in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage so there's gonna be no wedding ceremonies in heaven right we're not gonna have to go to any wedding ceremonies right the only wedding ceremony is ours amen with jesus hallelujah praise god and that's the rapture and then the reception is the merits up for the lamb praise god then the honeymoon amen and then the future hope praise god so see he said you not heir you air rather not knowing the scriptures nor the power of god so they thought which one is she going to be married to in heaven he said you don't know the power of god verse 30 from the resurrection they neither marry nor given in marriage but are as the angels of god in heaven so now let's put our learning together right they're all men right angels are all men they can't press in the flesh in mary right because this scripture says right so we don't we we can't uh we can't say there's going to be wedding ceremonies in heaven because the angels don't marry right and let me read you this quote from brother branham because this explains it the best i've ever heard this is a true sign that's overlooked 1961. he said oh i love that word jesus said you do always err not knowing the scriptures neither the power of god oh how he would blaze that out today if he was standing here you always err not knowing the scriptures the power of god's associated in the scripture you do air greatly then he went on to say in the resurrection they neither marry nor given in marriage but they're like angels so jesus was trying to tell these pharisees they're like angels he said he didn't say they'd be angels now but they'd be like angels he says sex glands would be out of them they don't marry nor give in marriage praise god that's what jesus is trying to say he says you don't know the power of god you're thinking this woman has to be married to all those seven men and they're going to reproduce in heaven that's a mormon thought right that's a mormon thought and jesus said they're not going to have any sex glands you don't know the power of god right he said they're not going to have sex glands they're not going there's going to be no marriage ceremonies there i believe it like this that woman who had the seven husbands should be married to one of them that's what i believe now with brother there could be two i don't know how that's going to work but they're not going to have any relations because there's no desires for that there's just pure holiness there's only holy desires not carnal desires amen like the brother a brother from overseas from australia was texting me last winter he's like what about this scripture are you going to be with your wife and glory i said absolutely he said well prove it to me i said okay i said do you think adam's going to have a different house than he you think they're going to live in a different mansion adam's going to live over here on the north and then he's going to live down in the south she came out of him she's a part of him and i said what about christ i said christ is it the bible says when we get raptured we shall ever be with the lord right that's the whole point the whole point of this gentile age is for jesus to get a bride amen someone he can live with forever praise god somebody can call his own remember he said i come to take a people out for my namesake that's what this whole story is about a marriage praise god remember that's his bride right there's there's thousands upon thousands that minister to him the jews but then there's the gentile bride praise god and then the other one was remember 1st peter 3 uh joint heirs together of the grace of god so let me let me read that first peter 3 that's the other scripture and it made him happy i said good john i kind of wiped my brow and said well thank god that because i didn't have any other scriptures after that either because there's not a whole lot in scripture joint heirs means together that means your husband your wife and husband you inherit things together right it belongs to both of you so that's scriptural if eve is a part of adam then god has uh it's not so much physical it's the spiritual part right because they were one spirit first so there's one person likely right unless you're paul or somebody i don't know there's one person likely that is kindred to your spirit and that's the one you're supposed to be with praise god i believe that in many cases now there's a whole other question on that but i won't get to that tonight here first peter 3 and uh yeah it's verse seven this is a good scripture on uh women honoring their husbands and then husbands loving their wives verse seven likewise the husbands dwell with them according to knowledge giving honor see brothers have to honor their wives unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel and as being heirs together of the grace of life that your prayers not be hindered okay so see that errors together of the graces of life the favors of life so your inheritors you and you get co-rewards right co-rewards okay so yeah is is matthew 22 a challenging scripture yeah i can't explain that but knowing what i know about all the other scriptures that causes me to say if a woman married seven men you know they all died one after another but that'd be a hard life uh perhaps one of them is her true husband okay perhaps one of them i don't know what you do with like brother brandon i don't know what you do with that remember brother had the dream though he said he went up to the white throne judgment and remember he said not white throne judgment the uh the judgment seat of christ for rewards but abraham said he said i'm not saying it's a vision he said it's a dream and he said i hope it will be so it wasn't thus saith the lord he had a dream he went up with hope and then he felt another hand touch it and it was mita he said i hope it's that way all right um okay so let's finish up here i got about eight minutes thanks for your patience all right a couple more we want to get to oh there's so many beautiful things here um let's go with um daniel 10 so daniel 10 so this is the story you read a little bit about this yesterday uh of daniel seeking god's face wanting to know what's going to happen to his nation they were in exile it was coming down to the end of the 70-year prophecy where they were kept out of the promised land and he was reading jeremiah's writings and then uh he prayed and asked god he confessed his sins the sins of everyone in his family and then an angel finally broke through after 21 days all right so daniel 10. so chapter nine he sets his face uh gets the vision of the daniel 70 weeks in chapter 10. he was in more he fasted three weeks just a little bit of eat a little bit to eat for three weeks after the daniel 70 weeks vision uh and then the angel came to him praise god and always love i always love what it said uh verse 11. my i just always love this here's what here's what angels think of your church here's what heaven thinks of you and he said unto me oh daniel a man greatly beloved what a message brother heaven loves me praise god oh that's what i want to hear praise god don't you heaven loves me jesus loves me the bible tells me so praise god but here an angel tells me so an angel tells me i'm greatly beloved in heaven understand the words that i speak unto thee now uh remember verse 13 but the prince of the kingdom of persia which stood me one in 21 days and lo michael one of the chief princes so one of the says here yeah this is a little tricky one of the chief princes so remember and judah calls him archangel here he says he's one of the princes so i don't know brother mystery at least for me right now uh came to help me and i remain there with the kings of persia now go to verse 20. then he said to me knowest thou wherefore i come unto thee and now i return to what to my picnic angels are fighting church and if they're fighting may we fight in prayer too they're fighting and wrestling against principalities and powers right with the prince of persia he's returning to the fight they're fighting and when i am gone forth lo the prince of greece shall come now let me say this i've been praying for years weeping and crying at this altar that god would rid this nation of abortion now if we get the victory if that happens i'm going to be just i'm going to be aware i'm going to believe that the angels of god broke through for my praying and fasting and crying because everybody says it's impossible and it may be but i've cried i've sighed and cried for the abominations done in this nation and i'm just going to see if god will do it by his grace and that would to me if that happens that will be an evidence everybody else thought it was impossible but god's angels stood up for our prayers amen i'm gonna that's what i'm believing and to me it's like that mountain's moving one rock at a time one rock at a time clarence thomas came out you see the article he come out and said we need to get rid of rogue versus wade it wasn't written the right way or it wasn't judged the right way clarence thomas said that i thought god blessed that man god bless that man and now trump's putting his third third justice up there and finally you know and you know the majority's been liberal since abortion since the 70s it's been a liberal uh supreme court justice for over what's that 40 50 years 50 years maybe more and now they're getting all upset because it might go conservative but one thing i know i've prayed before god i've asked god to do it i don't know if i'll do it but i have asked god and church god record god record my prayers just like he did daniel's praise god amen so this is where this is where the bible is real but amen this is where it's real i believe if we can get this victory it'll be absolute to me it'll be absolute vindication that angels have broke through the powers look think of the powers church over washington dc brother johnny now we're talking about that this deep state now there's a whole thing on that but you know these people are corrupt think of the demons that hover around there brother man said demons run every government satan's the one of everyone he's the head of every government think about that if he can break through and life can be saved that's nothing but god's grace but it had to be a wrestling fight against spiritual powers that's why we never give up praying amen because angels are fighting for us praise god i don't know you praise god amen where they're going to fight and so church where do we fight on our knees praise god and we plead with god we make our prayers and requests made known unto god and the peace of god which passes all understanding will keep your hearts and minds through christ jesus amen hallelujah okay so they're returning to fight angels are fighting then they rejoice praise god they rejoice when people get saved amen and they worship the lord they give god praise let me close here a couple more here i didn't have time to go through my order so i'm sorry i'm just kind of looking over making sure i get the most important ones uh we're not good well go and read it matthew 4 11 real quick just again how angels can come minister spiritual blessings to you like that's a perfect case with daniel the angel gives strength to daniel daniel's he's fast and he's weak after 21 days the angel come and strengthens him so matthew 4 11 jesus fasting 40 days and nights no food no water the devil leaves him and behold angels came and ministered unto him praise god hallelujah jesus received the blessings of the angels because they're ministers of god's spirit praise god now we know there's so many powers of angels like they delivered to three hebrew children jesus the angel delivered them one like the son of man in the flames and then the angels shut the mouth of lions praise god daniel and the lion's den so let's close with just a couple more scriptures i got a couple more here first corinthians 4 9 first corinthians 4 9. beautiful scripture our lives are a great theater how many know that our lives are like a theater this uh the world is like a stage and we are players on the stage and we know the one who wrote the story praise god we know who wrote the script praise god and we come to do our part when we realize oh i've got a part in this we come to do our part okay and god is really god is really and his angels are the only ones that know the will of god remember the bible said satan would not have crucified jesus had he known what was going to happen they would not have crucified the lord of glory because it's on a stage he does it all he's seeing it happen real real time like we are for i think that god has set forth us apostles last as it were appointed to death for we are made a spectacle that means theater we are made a theater unto the world and to angels and to men that's why brother ram said oh never call yourself weak in faith because those demons are watching us they're watching us on the stage oh that person said they're weak i'm gonna i know what they like i'm gonna bring this temptation i'm going to slip it in here see because they're they're watching don't ever confess you're a weak christian say i'm he said say i've got strong faith amen i'm more than a conqueror in christ jesus amen amen you start speaking the word the devil's got to flee anyway praise god resist him and he will flee praise god amen there's my hour so let me let me finish up here i'm just starting feeling good now here getting past all the all the tiredness and eating and everything like that it's a theater and so angels are watching and the evil ones when they uh the demons they watch and they respond but if we overcome them then we will judge them right first corinthians 6 3 know ye not we shall judge angels we were on the stage yet we were the ones being attacked we were the ones resisting them in the spiritual fight right the spiritual fight and so because we're able to resist them and drive them away then the bible says those will be the demons we judge at the white throne judgment if we can oh church if we can just overcome them now praise god can i say it like this if we can just judge that the word is right now we'll judge the fallen demons later praise god amen i'm talking about in everyday life right in our everyday lives uh in our church life and our family life if we can just judge that the word is right and not give in to fallen angels then we'll judge them later and condemn them for all their attacks on us to try to bring us down yet we overcame by the blood of jesus christ see we'll be a witness against those demons that tried to tear us down and separate our church and separate our families we'll be witnesses against them and we'll be overcomers because we've got the spiritual armor of god on amen glory all right last one i promise first peter 1 12. oh my we sing that song when the redeemed are gathering in washed like snow leave them all singing then the angels all will listen for they cannot join that song there's songs angels can't sing there's things angels don't know yet we know here it says it right here in the scripture unto whom it was revealed speaking of prophets now that not unto themselves but unto us they didn't minister these things so prophets wrote down the old testament scriptures and they didn't even understand it but we understand it now in the new testament praise god amen ezekiel probably didn't know what he was writing but amen a new heart new spirit and then my spirit praise god amen he didn't even probably know what he was talking about but we know it's god justifying us sanctifying us and filling us with the holy ghost praise god amen but they wrote it down maybe didn't understand it but unto us they did minister the things which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the holy ghost now see we gotta break what we need amen to preach with the holy ghost praise god amen i believe we are right i believe that that's what we need constantly preaching with the holy ghost set down from heaven which things the angels desire to look into lydia and i have talked about this at times we want to write like a a drama well i want to write one about angels and the angels in heaven you know kind of you know we know there's a book of life and the angels will try to look over there and sneak over there and god will say no get away no you're not allowed to look into these things these things are written for the redeemed of god they're written for us those of us here that are battling those of us in the human flesh thank god for angels praise god but we have a higher calling to sonship let's stand to our feet praise god we're redeemed by the blood purchased by the blood filled by the holy spirit we've fallen but they've been redeemed and angels the right ones have never fallen nor do they know about redemption musicians if you'll come by god's grace praise god they desire to look into this my desire to look into this new testament this new covenant let's bar heads here for a moment and have a word of prayer here tonight oh i didn't get to the one i want to get to uh i want to get to i want to end with the seraphim
