[0:02] Revelation chapter 21.
[0:05] the themes of this chapter include the
[0:08] new Heaven and Earth and the New
[0:10] Jerusalem
[0:13] the new Heaven and Earth have now come
[0:15] fulfilling the prophecy of Peter in
[0:17] second Peter 3 verses 7 through 10. the
[0:21] first heaven and first Earth have now
[0:23] passed away with the great noise and
[0:25] fervent Heat
[0:26] the earth and the works that were
[0:28] therein have been burned up there is no
[0:30] more sea no physical Temple no need for
[0:33] the light of the Sun and no nighttime
[0:35] for all things are new
[0:39] John who before had been invited to see
[0:41] the great or filthy woman in
[0:44] Revelation 17 verse 1 is now invited to
[0:47] come and see the great holy city the
[0:49] bride the Lamb's wife
[0:51] the New Jerusalem the great holy city is
[0:55] described in all of its beauty and
[0:56] Splendor and is likened unto a bride
[0:58] adorned for her husband
[1:00] this holy city has a glorious light
[1:02] clear as Crystal a great high wall with
[1:05] 12 foundations and 12 gates showing
[1:08] Christ's faithful dedication to his
[1:10] Covenant Promises to the 12 tribes of
[1:12] Israel and the 12 Apostles of Jesus
[1:15] Christ
[1:16] the measurements of this Four Square
[1:18] City prove it must be in the shape of a
[1:20] pyramid for a cube-shaped city would not
[1:23] allow for the light of the Lamb to reach
[1:25] every area in the city and the Nations
[1:27] that are outside the city
[1:30] the kingdom Jesus waited to rule has
[1:32] come
[1:33] we now see Jesus's Timeless wisdom and
[1:36] discernment fully Vindicated as all of
[1:39] Satan's kingdoms that he tempted Jesus
[1:41] with in Matthew 4 verse 8 have now been
[1:43] burned and destroyed the only Kingdom
[1:46] that remains is the kingdom of God
[1:47] Almighty and Jesus is the worthy proven
[1:51] and rightful ruler
[1:54] the symbols and key Revelations include
[1:56] The Descent of the New Jerusalem the
[1:59] Overcomers the kings of the earth and
[2:02] the gates of the city
[2:04] The Descent of the New Jerusalem coming
[2:07] down from God out of Heaven is a
[2:09] beautiful picture of God coming to
[2:11] physically and eternally dwell with his
[2:13] people
[2:15] this Descent of God was prefigured at
[2:18] Jesus's baptism at the River Jordan when
[2:20] God the father in the form of a dove
[2:22] descended to unite and dwell in the body
[2:25] of Jesus the son of God uniting Heaven
[2:28] and Earth
[2:29] the same spirit-filling experience is
[2:32] also experienced by every born-again
[2:34] child of God today as the baptism of the
[2:37] Holy Ghost unites the spirit of Christ
[2:38] from Heaven into the Earthly vessel of
[2:41] the True Believer in the believer's soul
[2:45] the Overcomers are said to inherit all
[2:47] things as the true sons of God
[2:50] these are the Overcomers from the seven
[2:52] Church ages found in Revelation chapters
[2:54] two and three having overcome all of
[2:57] Satan's Temptations and sins which
[2:59] included unbelief Abomination murder
[3:02] sorcery idolatry lying and all other
[3:06] defilements
[3:07] anyone guilty of not repenting of these
[3:10] evils will have already had their part
[3:12] in the Lake of Fire which is the second
[3:14] death
[3:15] the Overcomers made their calling and
[3:17] election sure during their lifetimes
[3:19] According to second Peter 1 verse 10 and
[3:21] their obedient lives proved their names
[3:24] were written on the Lamb's Book of Life
[3:27] the kings of the Earth are described in
[3:29] verses 24-26
[3:32] it seems God will have kings men given
[3:34] higher rewards and responsibilities
[3:36] ruling the entire population of the new
[3:39] Earth
[3:40] God will have different degrees of
[3:42] rewards given to those who inherit
[3:44] eternal life based upon the works and
[3:46] Faith they expressed during their
[3:48] Earthly lives before Christ's second
[3:50] coming as seen in Luke 16 verses 10
[3:53] through 12. First Corinthians 3 verses
[3:56] 8-15 and Matthew 25 verses 20 through
[4:00] 30.
[4:01] these Kings will bring their glory and
[4:03] honor of their own Nations into the holy
[4:06] city the New Jerusalem
[4:09] this City's Gates will never be shut
[4:11] according to verse 25. City Gates
[4:14] usually symbolize security and access so
[4:17] we learn that the New Jerusalem will
[4:18] have an abundant entrance to all at
[4:21] second Peter 1 verse 11 says for there
[4:24] is no sin and darkness in any heart
[4:26] Satan death and Hell have all been
[4:28] destroyed
[4:29] the great city is free from all
[4:31] defilement of sin God and men now dwell
[4:35] in perfect complete Harmony
[4:38] the fact that these Gates of the New
[4:39] Jerusalem are still standing are a
[4:42] testimony that Jesus words were true
[4:43] that the gates of hell would not Prevail
[4:45] against the Overcomers and now the
[4:47] Overcomers are living within the gates
[4:50] of the New Jerusalem
[4:54] the timing of events for this chapter
[4:55] seem to be chronological
[4:58] the New Jerusalem must first descend
[5:00] from heaven verse 2. and then the gates
[5:02] will open allowing entrance into this
[5:04] holy city and all the glory and honor
[5:07] from every nation will flow into her
[5:09] within her magnificent walls
