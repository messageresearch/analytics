[0:00] chapter 8 the perfect will of god
[0:04] includes footnotes numbers 416-476
[0:11] i beseech you therefore brethren by the
[0:13] mercies of god
[0:14] that ye present your bodies a living
[0:16] sacrifice
[0:18] holy acceptable unto god which is your
[0:21] reasonable service
[0:22] and be not conformed to this world but
[0:25] be transformed by the renewing of your
[0:27] mind
[0:28] that ye may prove what is that good and
[0:30] acceptable
[0:31] and perfect will of god romans 12 verses
[0:35] 1 and 2.
[0:39] at paul's conversion his trembling
[0:42] astonished being
[0:43] asked the lord jesus christ this humble
[0:45] question
[0:46] lord what will thou have me to do
[0:50] the gracious god answered him and told
[0:52] him to go into the city of damascus
[0:55] and he would be told more about what he
[0:57] must do
[0:58] every true sincere-hearted christian
[1:01] will ask the lord the same thing today
[1:03] what must i do in other words what is
[1:06] your will for my life lord
[1:08] what do you want me to do in the case of
[1:11] this book
[1:12] i hope you've asked yourself this
[1:14] question lord what is your will for my
[1:16] outward appearance
[1:18] hopefully you have been asking this
[1:19] question for years
[1:21] if you sincerely ask this question as a
[1:23] prayer god will give you his perfect
[1:25] will
[1:26] according to his holy bible
[1:30] proving the perfect will of god romans
[1:33] 12 verse 2 teaches that christians
[1:35] can not only know the will of god but
[1:38] prove what is the perfect will of god
[1:40] for their lives this is what children of
[1:43] the light do
[1:44] we walk in the light or will of god and
[1:47] prove
[1:47] what is acceptable unto the lord in fact
[1:51] every part of our lives should be proven
[1:53] to be pleasing to god
[1:54] paul taught once we know god's perfect
[1:57] will
[1:58] we must abide in it
[2:02] what will be your evidence or proof of
[2:04] the will of god
[2:05] it will be the actions that are
[2:06] acceptable to god based upon the
[2:09] scriptures
[2:10] the holy spirit anointed godly men to
[2:12] write for our admonition
[2:15] there is no other proof or evidence we
[2:17] need than the word of god
[2:18] for jesus christ said the word of god is
[2:21] truth
[2:23] in order to prove the perfect will of
[2:24] god paul wrote that we needed a
[2:26] transformed mind
[2:28] the greek word for transformed in romans
[2:31] 12 verse 2
[2:32] is the same word used to describe the
[2:34] transfigured presence
[2:36] of jesus christ on the mountain in
[2:38] matthew 17 verses
[2:40] 1 through 8. jesus's transfiguration
[2:43] included a face that shined like the sun
[2:46] and rayment bright as light paul said
[2:49] this is what should happen to our minds
[2:51] when we know the perfect will of god our
[2:54] minds are illuminated as the sun
[2:57] the day star has risen in our thoughts
[2:59] and mind
[3:01] darkness confusion and fear have all
[3:04] vanished
[3:05] the truth of god is present in our
[3:07] thoughts and shining in all its glory
[3:10] there is no confusion about what god
[3:12] once done in our lives
[3:13] when we know the perfect will of god
[3:15] through a transformed mind to the
[3:18] believer
[3:19] the truth of the word of god becomes a
[3:21] thus saith the lord
[3:22] an unquestioned authoritative love
[3:25] request
[3:26] from his savior the lord jesus christ
[3:30] today as in every generation satan will
[3:33] battle christians and try to move them
[3:35] out of walking
[3:36] in the perfect will of god those who
[3:39] reject the will of god
[3:40] and accept a sin-loving lifestyle are
[3:43] called workers of iniquity
[3:45] proving that there is no sin or
[3:47] disobedience in the perfect will of god
[3:52] two paths perfect versus permissive
[3:56] there are two paths we can walk either
[3:59] the perfect will of god
[4:00] or the permissive will of god the
[4:03] perfect will of god is the way of full
[4:05] obedience to the word of god
[4:06] while the permissive will of god is the
[4:08] path or way of disobedience
[4:11] and compromise the word of god is the
[4:14] light
[4:14] unto our path as david wrote if we lose
[4:18] our light
[4:18] or scriptural guidance we will walk in a
[4:21] permissive path
[4:22] rather than the perfect path and reap
[4:25] the consequences of disobeying the lord
[4:28] scripture gives us numerous examples of
[4:31] individuals who chose to walk in the
[4:33] permissive will of god
[4:34] rather than the perfect will of god the
[4:37] following four examples
[4:39] cain balaam saul and hezekiah
[4:43] prove there is great danger in choosing
[4:45] the permissive will of god
[4:46] but a person can still be saved despite
[4:48] walking away from the perfect will of
[4:50] god
[4:51] ultimately god is the righteous judge
[4:54] and will grant
[4:54] eternal life to all those he has
[4:57] foreknown
[5:00] cain was given the perfect will of god
[5:03] animal sacrifice
[5:04] by god himself this took place after
[5:07] cain witnessed his brother
[5:08] abel offer an animal sacrifice which
[5:11] please god
[5:12] the animal sacrifice was received by god
[5:15] as the perfect will of god
[5:17] instead of humbling himself and obeying
[5:19] the perfect will of god
[5:20] cain spurned the mercy of god changed
[5:23] his countenance
[5:24] murdered his brother and left the
[5:26] presence of god
[5:28] this proves god will accept nothing but
[5:30] true worship the perfect will of god
[5:32] according to his revealed will which is
[5:35] what jesus christ taught as well
[5:38] it seems likely that cain was lost
[5:41] balaam was a genuine prophet for telling
[5:44] the star of jacob
[5:45] that would lead the wise men to christ
[5:48] but balaam rejected god's perfect will
[5:50] which was against his joining forces
[5:52] with king balak
[5:54] after balaam heard god's perfect will
[5:56] telling him not to go see balak
[5:58] he prayed again to see if god would tell
[6:01] him different
[6:02] balaam did not need a second word from
[6:04] god because he was already given the
[6:06] perfect will of god
[6:09] because balaam's soul loved money more
[6:11] than god's perfect will
[6:13] he chose the wages of unrighteousness
[6:15] and prayed to see if god would let him
[6:17] go with the men
[6:19] god saw balaam's wickedness and let
[6:21] balaam have his permissive will
[6:23] once teamed up with balak balaam
[6:25] preached false doctrine
[6:27] and caused israel to commit acts of
[6:29] fornication
[6:30] that led to the death of thousands of
[6:32] people
[6:33] peter taught that balaam's destiny was
[6:35] hell
[6:36] the mist of darkness forever
[6:40] balaam stands as an example of a gifted
[6:42] individual
[6:43] who could hear from god but love money
[6:46] more than righteousness
[6:48] he ultimately rejected salvation
[6:51] israel's first king saul is an example
[6:54] of someone being saved
[6:56] despite choosing the permissive will of
[6:57] god for the majority of his adult life
[7:01] we know saul was saved because the
[7:03] spirit of samuel
[7:05] called up out of paradise by the witch
[7:06] of endor
[7:08] told saul that he would be with him in
[7:10] paradise the next day
[7:12] but saul's life will be remembered for
[7:14] walking in the permissive will
[7:16] of god as saul's pride and hatred
[7:19] caused him to rebel against the perfect
[7:21] will of god
[7:22] his sins caused him to lose out on god's
[7:25] establishing his kingdom forever
[7:28] what tremendous rewards saw lost because
[7:31] he chose the permissive will of god
[7:34] and guess who saw lost his kingdom and
[7:36] reward too
[7:37] david the man who is after the heart of
[7:40] god or the perfect will of god
[7:43] saul had a premature death as god
[7:45] himself took his life
[7:47] because of his awful transgressions of
[7:49] god's word
[7:51] king hezekiah's life was one of honor
[7:54] and obedience
[7:55] to the god of israel for the majority of
[7:57] his life
[7:58] at the end of his life though hezekiah
[8:00] chose to walk in the permissive will of
[8:02] god
[8:03] his first mistake was to ask god for
[8:06] more years
[8:07] to his life after the prophet isaiah had
[8:10] told him to set his house in order
[8:12] in preparation for his death scripture
[8:14] says
[8:15] it would have been better for hezekiah
[8:17] to die rather than live the extra 15
[8:20] years
[8:20] because after his healing he catered to
[8:23] the babylonian ambassadors
[8:25] and showed them all the treasures in the
[8:27] lord's house
[8:29] hezekiah remains a striking example of a
[8:31] post-mature death
[8:32] as he died at a later time than god had
[8:35] desired
[8:36] because he chose the permissive will of
[8:38] god
[8:41] now i will return to today a holy
[8:44] ghost-filled christian will have the
[8:45] same desire as christ
[8:47] to walk in the perfect will of god did
[8:50] you know that it was jesus's delight to
[8:52] obey the word of god we must have this
[8:54] same mindset as christ
[8:56] that it is a joy to do the will of god
[8:59] as revealed in the bible
[9:01] david wrote the following of christ then
[9:04] said i
[9:04] lo i come in the volume of the book
[9:08] it is written of me i delight to do thy
[9:10] will
[9:11] o my god yea thy law is within my heart
[9:17] when you are born again the commandments
[9:19] of god are not grievous
[9:21] obeying the word is not difficult when
[9:23] you are sealed with the baptism of the
[9:25] holy ghost
[9:26] in your being for you contain the
[9:28] quickening power
[9:29] of the risen christ in your soul
[9:33] by this we know that we love the
[9:35] children of god
[9:36] when we love god and keep his
[9:38] commandments
[9:39] for this is the love of god that we keep
[9:42] his commandments
[9:43] and his commandments are not grievous
[9:46] for whatsoever is born of god
[9:48] overcometh the world and this is the
[9:50] victory that overcometh the world
[9:52] even our faith paul says but if the
[9:56] spirit of him that raised up jesus from
[9:58] the dead dwell in you
[9:59] he that raised up christ from the dead
[10:01] shall also quicken your mortal bodies
[10:04] by his spirit that dwelleth in you
[10:10] if you want to do the perfect will of
[10:11] god you must have a teachable heart
[10:14] as david wrote teach me to do thy will
[10:17] for thou art my god thy spirit is good
[10:20] lead me into the land of uprightness
[10:24] jesus then explained how humble and
[10:26] sincere you must be
[10:27] if you want to learn from him saying
[10:30] come unto me all ye that labor
[10:32] and are heavy laden and i will give you
[10:34] rest
[10:35] take my yoke upon you and learn of me
[10:38] for i am meek and lowly in heart
[10:40] and ye shall find rest unto your souls
[10:43] for my yoke is easy
[10:44] and my burden is light
[10:50] you must come with a humble heart to
[10:52] learn from jesus christ
[10:54] you cannot come to christ and his bible
[10:56] with a prideful heart
[10:58] saying i can dress however i want and
[11:00] still go to heaven
[11:02] i don't have to submit to what the bible
[11:04] teaches about makeup
[11:05] my hair length or modest clothing
[11:08] if you want to learn from the meek one
[11:10] himself the lord jesus christ
[11:13] you must become meek like him meekly
[11:16] prayerfully pick up your bible and let
[11:19] god's word
[11:20] prove the perfect will of god for your
[11:22] outward appearance
[11:28] proving the perfect will of god for your
[11:29] outward appearance
[11:31] through the previous chapters you have
[11:33] been reading the perfect will of god
[11:35] for your outward appearance because the
[11:37] teachings were completely
[11:38] bible-based a brief review will help
[11:41] assure
[11:42] you that this is god's proven perfect
[11:44] will
[11:45] beginning with modest clothing recall
[11:48] the scriptures taught in chapter 3.
[11:50] the bible teaches we must cover all
[11:52] areas of nakedness
[11:53] which include the area from our
[11:55] shoulders down to past our knees
[11:58] according to the following scriptures
[12:00] genesis 3 verse 21
[12:02] isaiah 47 verses 1 through 3
[12:05] revelation 1 verse 13. first kings 18
[12:09] verse
[12:10] 46 proverbs 31 verse 17
[12:14] and matthew 5 verse 40. these scriptures
[12:17] prove
[12:18] that the perfect will of god is to cover
[12:20] our bodies from our shoulders to our
[12:22] shins
[12:23] by god's design not mine
[12:26] if we wear clothes that reveal any body
[12:28] parts within this range
[12:30] we have broken the perfect will of god
[12:32] and are living in the permissive will of
[12:34] god
[12:35] exposing shoulders bearing the navel
[12:38] exposing cleavage and exposing thighs
[12:41] are acts included in the permissive will
[12:43] of god
[12:44] can anyone prove this teaching wrong
[12:47] according to the bible
[12:48] i humbly offer the challenge to be
[12:50] proven wrong by the word of god
[12:53] i can find no scriptural witnesses of
[12:55] god being pleased
[12:56] when people present their uncovered
[12:58] shoulders cleavage
[13:00] navel and thighs
[13:04] our shoulder exposing tank tops halter
[13:07] or tube tops
[13:08] and spaghetti strap shirts the perfect
[13:11] will of god
[13:12] no those shirts expose the shoulders
[13:15] shoulders are nakedness in the sight of
[13:17] god for they are part of the breast and
[13:19] arms region can anyone prove this wrong
[13:22] by the bible

[13:27] skirts
[13:28] low-cut dresses short shorts and shorts
[13:32] on men or women the perfect will of god
[13:35] no as all of these garments expose the
[13:37] thigh area
[13:38] which god considers nakedness according
[13:41] to isaiah 47 verses 1-3
[13:44] can anyone prove this wrong by the bible
[13:48] modest clothing must also include
[13:49] multiple layers
[13:51] or be thick and opaque according to
[13:53] genesis 3
[13:54] 21 matthew 5 verse 40
[13:57] judges 3 verse 16 and john 21 verse 7.
[14:02] peter in john 21 verse 7 was wearing
[14:05] only his undergarment tunic and was
[14:07] considered naked
[14:08] in the sight of god like peter anyone
[14:11] who wears their undergarments on the
[14:13] outside
[14:14] such as underwear or bathing suits is
[14:17] guilty of walking in the permissive will
[14:19] of god
[14:19] can anyone prove this wrong by the bible
[14:25] are bikinis and skin tight one piece
[14:28] bathing suits the perfect will of god
[14:30] no these suits are one thin layer of
[14:33] clothing
[14:34] and are equal to the amount of fabric
[14:36] used for undergarments
[14:37] they also reveal breasts the navel
[14:40] thighs
[14:41] and all the leg bathing suits reveal
[14:44] nearly
[14:44] every area of nakedness can anyone prove
[14:47] this wrong by the bible
[14:49] are sheer blouses the perfect will of
[14:51] god

[14:55] through the outer garments and perceive
[14:57] undergarments god calls the exposing of
[15:00] undergarments nakedness can anyone prove
[15:03] this wrong by the bible
[15:07] modest clothing must be gender specific
[15:09] according to deuteronomy 22
[15:11] 5 even as the lord jesus obeyed this
[15:14] command of separate garments for men and
[15:16] women
[15:17] in our american culture any man who
[15:20] wears woman's clothing
[15:21] dresses bras etc is committing an
[15:25] abomination
[15:26] likewise any woman who wears pants is
[15:29] cross-dressing and walking in the
[15:30] permissive will of god
[15:32] can anyone prove this wrong by the bible
[15:36] modest clothing must also be loose
[15:38] according to first kings
[15:40] 19 13 mark 16 verse 5
[15:44] revelation 6 verse 11 revelation
[15:47] 7 verse 14 and proverbs 7 verse 10.
[15:51] anyone who wears skin tight clothing
[15:54] thus revealing the form of their bodies
[15:56] is walking in the permissive will of god
[15:58] can anyone prove this wrong by the bible
[16:02] are skinny jeans yoga pants and women's
[16:05] leggings the perfect will of god
[16:07] no for they reveal the literal shape of
[16:10] the human body
[16:11] which is a form of nakedness that can
[16:13] cause others
[16:14] to lust after their bodies and commit
[16:16] spiritual fornications and adulteries
[16:19] can anyone prove this wrong by the bible
[16:24] concerning our outward appearance recall
[16:26] the scriptures taught in chapters 4
[16:29] 5 and 6. we can prove the perfect will
[16:32] of god for our hair length
[16:33] jewelry and skin men's hair length must
[16:37] be short
[16:38] and women's must be as long as possible
[16:41] as women must never cut their hair
[16:43] any man who lets his hair grow uncut is
[16:45] bringing shame
[16:46] upon himself likewise a woman who cuts
[16:49] or trims her hair
[16:51] in any way is bringing herself shame
[16:54] along with her head
[16:55] her husband can anyone prove this wrong
[16:57] by the bible
[17:00] are uncut dreadlocks on a man the
[17:02] perfect will of god no
[17:04] for men are commanded to have short hair
[17:07] could anyone prove this wrong by the
[17:08] bible
[17:10] are bobbed haircuts or the trimming of
[17:12] split ends the perfect will of god for
[17:14] women
[17:15] no for godly women are never commanded
[17:18] to cut their hair in any way
[17:20] can anyone prove this wrong by the bible
[17:27] jewelry can be worn in moderation with a
[17:29] meek and quiet attitude
[17:31] as long as the jewelry is not extremely
[17:33] costly
[17:34] wearing jewelry such as rings bracelets
[17:37] and necklaces
[17:38] in this manner can be the perfect will
[17:40] of god can anyone prove this wrong by
[17:42] the bible
[17:45] jewelry that is extremely expensive is
[17:47] in the permissive will of god
[17:48] so is wearing any jewelry whether
[17:51] inexpensive or expensive
[17:52] with a prideful heart wearing large
[17:55] amounts of jewelry is also the
[17:57] permissive will of god
[17:58] can anyone prove this wrong by the bible
[18:02] makeup tattoos and high heels are not
[18:04] part of the perfect will of god
[18:06] according to the following scriptures 2
[18:09] kings 9
[18:10] 30 jeremiah 4 verse 30 ezekiel 23 verse
[18:14] 40
[18:15] leviticus 19 verse 28 and isaiah 3 verse
[18:19] 16.
[18:20] can anyone prove this wrong by the bible
[18:23] if all these statements cannot be proved
[18:25] wrong by the bible
[18:26] then these statements must be the
[18:28] perfect will of god for our outward
[18:30] appearance
[18:32] i am not guessing what is the perfect
[18:33] will of god concerning our outward
[18:35] appearances
[18:36] by the grace of god i have shown you
[18:38] much more than two or three witnesses
[18:41] as jesus and paul required to prove that
[18:43] these teachings are correct
[18:46] as jesus said i say humbly concerning
[18:48] these guidelines for a modest outward
[18:50] appearance
[18:51] which of you convinceth me of sin which
[18:55] scripture have i failed to teach
[18:56] properly
[18:57] who am i causing to stumble with these
[18:59] bible guidelines
[19:00] on modest clothing and outward
[19:03] appearance
[19:04] i am pointing you to present your body
[19:06] to god as a living sacrifice
[19:11] ask for and seek revelation
[19:14] perhaps you want a transformed mind in
[19:16] order to do the perfect will of god
[19:18] but you still may feel like you do not
[19:21] understand all the scripture i have
[19:22] presented thus far
[19:24] if the bible feels like a newspaper like
[19:27] a dead letter
[19:28] then it is time you ask and seek god for
[19:30] revelation
[19:31] revelation is an unveiling of god and
[19:34] his will
[19:35] revelation is more important to you than
[19:37] you know for the lord jesus christ
[19:39] said that the gates of hell cannot
[19:41] prevail against revelation
[19:43] and jesus answered and said unto him
[19:45] blessed art thou
[19:46] simon barjona for flesh and blood hath
[19:49] not revealed it unto thee
[19:51] but my father which is in heaven and i
[19:53] say also unto thee
[19:55] that thou art peter and upon this rock i
[19:58] will build my church
[19:59] and the gates of hell shall not prevail
[20:01] against it
[20:03] in context jesus was declaring to peter
[20:06] how blessed he was
[20:07] that god not man had revealed to him
[20:10] that jesus was the messiah
[20:12] or christ the revelation or unveiling
[20:16] of who jesus was would be the anchor
[20:18] that would keep peter
[20:20] grounded in god's love satan would try
[20:22] to overthrow peter's faith
[20:25] but the revelation peter received from
[20:27] father god would prevail over all of
[20:29] satan's counsel to destroy him
[20:34] the same is true about revelation for
[20:36] all of god's teachings
[20:38] you need revelation about a modest
[20:40] outward appearance
[20:41] forgiveness gifts and love you name the
[20:45] topic
[20:45] and you need revelation about it all
[20:48] revelation from god will empower his
[20:50] children
[20:51] to serve him and overcome the devil
[20:53] revelation was so crucial
[20:55] that paul prayed for believers to
[20:57] receive it
[20:58] wherefore i also after i heard of your
[21:01] faith in the lord jesus
[21:03] and love unto all the saints cease not
[21:05] to give thanks for you
[21:07] making mention of you in my prayers that
[21:10] the god of our lord jesus christ
[21:12] the father of glory may give unto you
[21:14] the spirit of wisdom
[21:16] and revelation in the knowledge of him
[21:18] the eyes of your understanding
[21:20] being enlightened that ye may know
[21:23] what is the hope of his calling and what
[21:25] the riches of the glory of his
[21:27] inheritance in the saints and what is
[21:30] the exceeding greatness of his power
[21:32] to us word who believe according to the
[21:35] working
[21:36] of his mighty power
[21:39] the power and importance of revelation
[21:41] was so great that even our lord jesus
[21:44] rejoiced over his disciples receiving
[21:46] his revelations
[21:48] in that hour jesus rejoiced in spirit
[21:51] and said
[21:52] i thank thee o father lord of heaven and
[21:54] earth
[21:55] that thou hast hid these things from the
[21:57] wise and prudent and has
[21:58] revealed them unto babes even so father
[22:02] for so it seemed good in thy sight
[22:05] all things are delivered to me of my
[22:07] father and no man knoweth who the son
[22:10] is but the father and who the father is
[22:12] but the son
[22:14] and he to whom the son will reveal him
[22:21] if you are struggling to understand the
[22:22] scriptures i have pointed out
[22:24] then i encourage you to continue seeking
[22:26] god's will for your outward appearance
[22:29] with all your heart ask seek and knock
[22:32] for revelation
[22:33] as jesus promised everyone that did this
[22:35] would receive of him
[22:38] ask and it shall be given you seek and
[22:40] ye shall find
[22:41] knock and it shall be opened unto you
[22:44] for everyone that asketh receiveth
[22:47] and he that seeketh findeth and to him
[22:49] that knocketh it shall be opened
[22:54] there is one very important passage
[22:56] about seeking god's will
[22:58] that has been pivotal in many of my
[23:00] times of seeking the will of god
[23:02] for my own life after you read proverbs
[23:05] 2 verses 3 through 9 below i hope you
[23:08] will be unashamed and confident
[23:10] when crying out to god for the
[23:12] revelation of his word
[23:15] yea if thou criest after knowledge and
[23:18] lift us
[23:18] up thy voice for understanding if thou
[23:21] seekest her as silver
[23:23] and searches for her as for hid
[23:24] treasures then shalt thou
[23:26] understand the fear of the lord and find
[23:28] the knowledge of god
[23:30] for the lord giveth wisdom out of his
[23:32] mouth cometh knowledge and understanding
[23:35] he layeth up sound wisdom for the
[23:37] righteous he is a buckler to them that
[23:39] walk uprightly
[23:41] he keepeth the paths of judgment and
[23:43] preserveth the way of his saints
[23:46] then shalt thou understand righteousness
[23:48] and judgment and equity
[23:50] yea every good path
[23:54] the source of my teachings after reading
[23:57] these nearly
[23:58] forty thousand words contained in eight
[24:00] chapters you may be wondering who is the
[24:02] source of my teachings
[24:04] to begin with i humbly state that i have
[24:06] no teachings of my own
[24:08] with the help of god i teach only the
[24:10] doctrine of our lord and savior jesus
[24:12] christ
[24:13] he is the ultimate divine source of my
[24:16] teachings
[24:17] for it is his bible that i have used to
[24:19] rightly divide these truths
[24:21] about a modest outward appearance
[24:24] but you are probably still wondering
[24:26] which human source
[24:27] meaning which man or ministry did i
[24:30] follow
[24:30] in order to gain these doctrines i am
[24:33] happy to share that i receive these
[24:34] bible doctrines
[24:36] from the ministry of the late reverend
[24:38] william branham
[24:39] 1909 to 1965.
[24:44] william branham's ministry is the human
[24:46] source of my teachings
[24:48] yet god was the divine source god
[24:51] revealed his bible truths to branham
[24:53] as the word of the lord always comes to
[24:55] the prophet
[24:56] the prophetic spirit of elijah anointed
[24:58] william branham
[25:00] fulfilling jesus's promise in matthew 17
[25:03] verse 11
[25:04] to restore all things including
[25:06] christian modesty
[25:08] in november of 2001 i was introduced to
[25:11] the ministry of
[25:12] brother branham as we lovingly call him
[25:15] and have followed his bible-based
[25:17] teachings
[25:17] ever since
[25:22] the simplest way to describe the
[25:23] ministry of brother branham is by
[25:25] calling him a prophet of god
[25:27] a new testament prophet is an official
[25:29] preaching
[25:30] office of god according to ephesians 4
[25:33] verse 11.
[25:34] the qualifications of a prophet include
[25:36] hearing from god
[25:38] foretelling the future in the name of
[25:39] the lord without fail
[25:41] and revealing secrets that were
[25:43] previously hidden
[25:44] by the leading of the holy spirit
[25:46] brother branham met these three
[25:48] qualifications
[25:52] brother branham heard from god
[25:54] throughout his entire life
[25:56] meeting the requirement of numbers 12 6.
[25:59] he shared many of his supernatural
[26:00] encounters with both the lord jesus
[26:03] and the angel of the lord during his
[26:05] entire ministry the angel lord followed
[26:07] him
[26:08] just as moses and paul had an angel with
[26:11] them during their lives
[26:13] in 1946 the angel of the lord visited
[26:16] brother branham
[26:17] and commissioned him to pray for the
[26:18] sick with a gift of divine healing
[26:21] after hearing from and obeying the angel
[26:23] of the lord
[26:24] the healing campaigns of brother branham
[26:26] were miraculous to say the least
[26:28] and led to a spiritual explosion in the
[26:31] pentecostal movement
[26:33] of the 1940s 1950s and 1960s
[26:37] brother branham's ministry spearheaded
[26:39] this worldwide movement
[26:43] a true prophet foretells future events
[26:46] without fail
[26:47] as moses taught in deuteronomy 18 verses
[26:50] 20 through 22
[26:52] brother branham met this prophetic
[26:54] requirement my youtube video titled
[26:57] three prophecies of william branham
[26:59] details three prophecies that have
[27:01] either come to pass
[27:02] already or are in the process of coming
[27:05] to pass
[27:06] which include the immoral condition of
[27:08] the churches in the united states
[27:10] no greater ministry rising to the
[27:12] gentile people than what god gave to
[27:14] brother branham
[27:15] and no return of christian denominations
[27:18] to an apostolic ministry
[27:20] along with these three prophecies there
[27:23] are many other future prophecies
[27:25] that i believe will come to pass as
[27:27] detailed in my youtube video
[27:29] titled thus saith the lord future
[27:32] prophecies of william
[27:33] branham
[27:36] because god is so gracious he has always
[27:39] sent a prophet to warn his people
[27:41] before times of judgment as seen in four
[27:44] clear examples
[27:46] first in the years before the flood of
[27:48] judgment in noah's day
[27:50] the merciful god sent at least two
[27:52] prophets to warn the people
[27:54] enoch and noah second before israel's
[27:57] babylonian and assyrian captivity
[27:59] god sent multiple prophets to warn the
[28:02] people
[28:03] such as jeremiah isaiah micah
[28:06] and habakkuk third god sent the prophet
[28:09] jonah to warn the ninevites before
[28:11] judgment
[28:12] and thankfully they repented and were
[28:14] spared from the wrath
[28:16] of god fourth god sent the prophet john
[28:19] the baptist and his son jesus
[28:22] to warn israel before the destruction of
[28:24] jerusalem
[28:25] at the coming of titus in 70 a.d
[28:28] finally at the end of the world the
[28:31] unchanging god was obligated to send a
[28:33] prophetic ministry
[28:34] to warn the people before the next
[28:36] judgment which will be the great
[28:38] tribulation period of the wrath of god
[28:40] spoken of in daniel 12 1 revelation
[28:44] 6 verses 12 through 17 revelation 11
[28:48] verse 18
[28:49] revelation 15 verse 1 and revelation 16
[28:53] verse 1
[28:54] to name a few the ministry of brother
[28:56] branham was god's prophetic voice of
[28:58] warning
[28:59] but also of deliverance
[29:03] one of the most exciting elements of a
[29:05] prophetic ministry
[29:06] is that prophets revealed god's secrets
[29:08] that were previously hidden
[29:10] according to amos 3 verse 7 surely the
[29:13] lord god will do nothing
[29:15] but he revealeth his secret unto his
[29:16] servants the prophets
[29:18] god revealed many secrets to brother
[29:20] branham which he in turn revealed to us
[29:23] including but not limited to
[29:26] the human identities of the seven stars
[29:29] or
[29:29] angel messengers to the seven churches
[29:31] in revelation 1 verse 20
[29:34] and chapters 2 and 3. the revelation of
[29:37] the seven seals of revelation chapters
[29:40] 6 and 8. the 12 new testament mysteries
[29:44] the restoration of the one faith of the
[29:47] apostolic fathers
[29:49] the visitation of the son of man jesus
[29:51] christ
[29:52] to the gentiles before worldwide
[29:54] judgment
[29:56] the last sign to the gentiles before
[29:58] worldwide judgment
[30:00] the identity of the final two gentile
[30:03] kingdoms
[30:03] greek and roman that followed the first
[30:06] two kingdoms
[30:07] babylon and the medes and persians
[30:10] described in nebuchadnezzar's dream in
[30:12] daniel chapter 2.
[30:14] the united states identity and position
[30:16] in revelation 13
[30:19] the mark of the beast his number and
[30:21] image
[30:23] if you seek to learn more about this
[30:25] amazing prophetic ministry of
[30:26] brother william branham please contact
[30:29] me through our church's website
[30:31] at www.brideofchristohio.org
[30:36] please do not neglect the god-ordained
[30:39] supernatural ministry of brother branham
[30:41] according to the holy spirit
[30:43] speaking prophetically through brother
[30:44] branham in 1961
[30:46] his supernatural ministry was the last
[30:49] sign to the gentile church before the
[30:51] rapture
[30:52] thus saith the word of god thus saith
[30:54] the holy spirit
[30:56] i am so thankful that i did not neglect
[30:58] this ministry
[30:59] and i will end this section by sharing
[31:01] how this ministry has impacted my life
[31:06] the ministry of brother william branham
[31:08] has established a true relationship
[31:09] between the lord jesus
[31:11] and myself while i am thankful for the
[31:13] charismatic church i was raised in
[31:15] it did not contain the pure
[31:17] unadulterated bible teachings that god
[31:20] gave to his servant
[31:21] brother branham while on my own during
[31:23] my college years
[31:25] i attended many different churches but
[31:27] their preaching could not produce
[31:28] victory in my life
[31:30] as i was still a slave addict to many
[31:32] sins
[31:33] and felt extremely helpless but shortly
[31:36] after i heard the bible-based
[31:37] revelations god gave to brother branham
[31:40] the presence of jesus christ became a
[31:42] reality to me
[31:43] and i was completely delivered of my
[31:45] sinful addictions
[31:46] not long after my deliverance i began to
[31:49] see the power of god
[31:50] move even more in my own life and
[31:52] preaching ministry
[31:54] one highlight was an evangelistic trip
[31:57] to guyana
[31:58] in 2011 where i saw god cast out devils
[32:02] in the exact same manner as the lord
[32:04] jesus modeled
[32:05] in mark 9 verses 25-27
[32:09] god so anointed and filled my body that
[32:12] i saw myself rebuking foul spirits
[32:14] who would cry out rend the one possessed
[32:17] and then leave the person the person
[32:20] would fall down as dead
[32:21] but then rise later in victory and
[32:23] deliverance from the foul spirit
[32:25] the highest compliment i can give to the
[32:27] ministry of brother branham
[32:29] is that he showed to me and millions
[32:31] more that jesus christ is the same
[32:34] yesterday
[32:34] and today and forever
[32:38] jesus's counsel to be clothed
[32:42] to conclude this book my final thoughts
[32:44] come from the words of the lord jesus
[32:46] christ
[32:47] from revelation chapters 2 and 3.
[32:49] christ's red letter words in revelation
[32:52] include some of the most inspiring
[32:54] prophetic specific
[32:56] and applicable words for us in the 21st
[32:58] century
[32:59] in these seven addresses to seven
[33:01] gentile cities
[33:03] the lord jesus offers counsel
[33:05] compliments
[33:06] rebukes consequences and even eternal
[33:09] rewards
[33:10] to those in the churches
[33:14] the final letter of these seven letters
[33:17] written to the church at laodicea
[33:19] has the most bitter denunciation
[33:21] recorded in scripture
[33:22] jesus offered no compliment to this
[33:25] blind miserable wretched
[33:26] and naked group due to their pride
[33:29] arrogance
[33:30] and avoidance of recognizing their true
[33:32] spiritual condition
[33:34] the laodiceans felt no need for more of
[33:36] god
[33:37] they had no physical persecution so
[33:39] their age was easier physically
[33:42] as they did not have to be slain for
[33:43] their faith but sadly
[33:45] they were slain by their own lusts as
[33:48] they let riches and worldly goods
[33:50] deceive them into a lukewarm nauseating
[33:53] spiritual condition any spiritually
[33:56] minded person
[33:57] should be able to see that we are living
[33:58] in a modern laodicean condition today
[34:02] most churches are richer than ever with
[34:04] bigger buildings and programs than ever
[34:06] before
[34:07] yet the supernatural power of the holy
[34:09] ghost is at its lowest ebb
[34:11] because they do not want more of the
[34:13] word of god
[34:14] instead they want material possessions
[34:19] for a moment focus on christ's words in
[34:21] revelation 3 verse 18.
[34:24] i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried
[34:26] in the fire
[34:27] that thou mayest be rich and white
[34:30] raiment
[34:30] that thou mayest be clothed and that the
[34:33] shame of thy
[34:34] nakedness do not appear and anoint thine
[34:36] eyes with i
[34:37] salve that thou mayest see jesus said
[34:40] that repentant faithful christians
[34:43] need three things gold white raiment
[34:46] and i salve first gold represents
[34:50] time-tested
[34:51] unwavering faith most church members do
[34:54] not live by faith
[34:56] which is assurance in the unseen
[34:57] promises of the invisible god
[35:00] church members often reject the commands
[35:03] of god creating a state of unbelief in
[35:05] their lives
[35:07] unbelief is the opposite of faith when
[35:09] trials come
[35:10] these unbelieving church members choose
[35:12] the path that leads to an easier life
[35:15] for they love money wealth soft living
[35:18] possessions and big church buildings
[35:21] more than the word of god
[35:23] their lives are lacking spiritual gold
[35:25] unwavering
[35:26] faith and trust in the divine promises
[35:29] of god
[35:30] your life can be different as you can
[35:32] obtain this unwavering
[35:33] mature faith in the midst of your
[35:35] hardships by obeying
[35:37] all of god's commands
[35:41] second i salve represents the anointing
[35:44] of the holy spirit
[35:45] to see or discern the absolute truth of
[35:47] god
[35:48] paul wrote that christians have received
[35:50] the i salve
[35:51] or enlightening eyes when they
[35:53] understood
[35:54] god's calling and inheritance for the
[35:56] saints
[35:58] most church members are blind following
[36:00] blind leaders
[36:01] according to jesus christ for he said
[36:04] that few will be saved
[36:06] modern laodiceans follow churches that
[36:08] itch their ears
[36:10] and tell them what they want to hear
[36:12] rather than what they need to hear
[36:14] most church members cannot see or
[36:16] understand the bible truths that apply
[36:18] to their lives
[36:20] they will quickly say that the commands
[36:22] of god do not apply to them
[36:24] and applied only to the believers who
[36:26] lived in the days of paul
[36:27] and other apostles the lord jesus christ
[36:31] said the blessing of god is upon the
[36:33] eyes of those who can see and hear
[36:35] the word repent and be converted last
[36:40] white raiment represents the
[36:42] righteousness of jesus christ
[36:44] which is a life of spiritual integrity
[36:46] that walks in obedience to the spirit
[36:48] and not the flesh jesus said that most
[36:51] laodicean church members were naked
[36:54] not clothed with a spirit-led life of
[36:57] integrity
[36:58] to the bible when true believers receive
[37:00] the baptism of the holy ghost
[37:02] they are being endued or clothed in
[37:05] power
[37:06] to live a life of integrity in obedience
[37:08] to the spirit
[37:10] here are a few examples to show whether
[37:12] churches have kept jesus's words with
[37:14] integrity
[37:17] churches publish how much food and money
[37:19] they give to the poor
[37:20] and yet jesus taught not to let anyone
[37:23] know
[37:24] about how much we give to others where
[37:26] is the integrity
[37:27] of secret giving church members
[37:31] frequently and willingly
[37:32] entertain lustful thoughts yet christ
[37:35] said those who lust in their hearts
[37:36] are guilty of committing adultery how
[37:39] many millions of church members attend
[37:41] movie theaters
[37:42] on saturday nights enjoying sinful
[37:45] love-making scenes
[37:46] murder scenes and more evil and then
[37:49] attend
[37:50] church on sunday mornings without
[37:51] repenting pretending they have christian
[37:54] integrity
[37:55] where is the integrity of a clean mind
[37:57] and thought life
[37:59] church members frequently use cuss words
[38:02] and even use god's name in vain
[38:04] where is the integrity of a bridal
[38:06] tongue james 1 verse 26 says
[38:09] if any man among you seem to be
[38:11] religious and bridleth not his tongue
[38:14] but deceiveth his own heart this man's
[38:16] religion
[38:17] is vain
[38:20] white raiment then has a deep spiritual
[38:22] meaning of godly integrity
[38:24] in obedience to the commands of jesus
[38:26] christ
[38:27] those without honest christian integrity
[38:30] are spiritually naked
[38:32] devoid of all christ's righteousness
[38:35] there is also a dual meaning for being
[38:37] clothed physically in god honoring
[38:40] raiment
[38:40] that directly relates to this book as
[38:43] jesus said these laodiceans
[38:44] were naked and unclothed it cannot be
[38:48] coincidental
[38:49] that our generation is both the most
[38:50] spiritually naked
[38:52] and physically naked generation of all
[38:54] time
[38:55] the history of american fashion
[38:57] contained in chapter 6
[38:58] fully proves this point never before in
[39:01] this nation's history
[39:02] have churches been full of members
[39:04] dressed in sexually revealing
[39:06] fashions churches are full of women who
[39:09] flaunt
[39:09] shameful bobbed haircuts churches are
[39:12] full of women
[39:13] lacking the shamefaceness that paul
[39:16] commanded
[39:16] and instead their faces are painted like
[39:19] that of jezebel
[39:20] the counsel or advice of jesus christ is
[39:23] to be clothed both
[39:24] naturally and spiritually with modest
[39:27] apparel
[39:28] and spiritual integrity
[39:32] the only hope to be an overcomer in your
[39:34] day is to genuinely repent after
[39:36] receiving
[39:37] a rebuke from jesus who is the word of
[39:40] god
[39:40] as a true christian you should expect
[39:43] correction to come from the word of god
[39:45] that you hear preached in god-fearing
