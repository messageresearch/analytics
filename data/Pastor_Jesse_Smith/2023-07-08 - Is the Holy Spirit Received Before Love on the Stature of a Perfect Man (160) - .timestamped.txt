[0:00] greetings friends in the mattress name
[0:02] of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of
[0:05] this video is to answer a viewer's
[0:07] question do I believe that a person
[0:09] receives the holy spirit before love on
[0:12] the stature of a perfect man
[0:14] this is an excellent question on the
[0:16] statute of a perfect man
[0:18] I wrote extensively on this subject
[0:20] using many Bible verses in chapter 5 of
[0:23] my 2021 book The 12 New Testament
[0:26] Mysteries revealed
[0:28] if you do an online image search about
[0:31] the Statue of a perfect man you'll find
[0:33] most images that look like this
[0:36] that add holy spirit before love
[0:40] also here's an image of a magnet I
[0:42] received from voice of God Recordings
[0:44] many years ago I love the magnet but it
[0:46] has the holy spirit before love
[0:49] So my answer to the question is no I do
[0:52] not believe the Holy Spirit baptism in
[0:54] the soul is received before love on the
[0:58] stature of a perfect man
[1:00] here's an image I use to teach the
[1:03] stature perfect man from the Bible
[1:05] it dovetails with brother Graham's
[1:07] teaching on the three works of Grace
[1:09] faith is justification virtue knowledge
[1:12] Temperance patience godliness and
[1:14] brotherly kindness are sanctification
[1:16] the third step is the baptism of the
[1:18] Holy Ghost which is the love of God or
[1:21] the holy spirit that seals a person's
[1:23] soul unto the day of redemption
[1:26] I believe each of the seven attributes
[1:29] of the stature of perfect man are a
[1:31] portion or measure of the Holy Ghost
[1:33] until love caps off the soul or seals
[1:37] the soul of the individual and love is
[1:40] the Holy Ghost according to the Bible
[1:43] and brother Branham so I believe brother
[1:45] Branham grew in his Revelation on this
[1:47] subject which proves he was Guided by
[1:50] the Holy Ghost into all truth as with
[1:53] numerous other subjects
[1:55] so I want to make two points first I
[1:59] want to point to the Bible we'll look at
[2:01] three verses second Peter 1 verses 5
[2:04] through 7. and beside this giving all
[2:07] diligence add to your faith virtue and
[2:09] to Virtue knowledge and to knowledge
[2:11] Temperance and to Temperance patience
[2:13] and to patience godliness and to
[2:15] Godliness brotherly kindness and to
[2:17] barely kindness charity
[2:19] notice according to the infallible word
[2:21] of God there is no holy spirit before
[2:23] charity in the Holy Bible
[2:26] random teaches us that the Holy Ghost
[2:27] will only point to the word of God and
[2:29] the word of God is always right
[2:32] also First Corinthians chapter 13 the
[2:35] entire chapter I'm not going to read the
[2:37] entire chapter but this chapter confirms
[2:39] charity is the last portion of the Holy
[2:41] Ghost to receive which agrees with
[2:43] second Peter 1 verse 7 and then thirdly
[2:46] first John 4 verse 8 proves God is
[2:48] charity for charity is love and first
[2:52] John 4 8 says for God is love
[2:55] before moving on to the second Point
[2:57] recall this church age Book quote from
[2:59] page 83 brother Brandon said when the
[3:02] prophet to the laodicean church age is
[3:05] come you will know him for he will be
[3:07] quote in that word exactly as God gave
[3:10] it to Paul he won't deviate from that
[3:12] word for a moment not by one iota end
[3:15] quote
[3:16] I'm sure you'll never forget the other
[3:18] scriptures like proverbs 30 verses 5 and
[3:21] 6 that says add thou not unto God's
[3:23] words lest God call you a liar and
[3:27] revelation 22 verses 18 and 19 that says
[3:30] if any man adds to the word of God
[3:32] plagues will be added to him or if any
[3:34] man takes away from the word of God
[3:36] his name will be taken out of the book
[3:38] of life so we know brother Branham
[3:39] pointed us to the true revelation of the
[3:41] word of God and so according to the word
[3:43] of God there is no holy spirit before
[3:46] love because love is the Holy Spirit
[3:51] second let's look at quotes from Brother
[3:53] Branham remember brother random preached
[3:55] stature perfect man on October 14 1962.
[4:01] one month later
[4:02] brother Ram did not mention holy spirit
[4:04] before charity or love in the sermon all
[4:07] things November 24 1962. brother Brandon
[4:11] said quote the faith that you've got in
[4:13] him add to that virtue and to that
[4:15] broadly kindness second Peter 1 verse 7
[4:17] until you're built in the full stature
[4:19] of Christ then the last thing is love
[4:21] which God the Holy Spirit seals you to
[4:24] your destination end quote
[4:27] other important quotes include
[4:28] demonology 1953 quote and the Holy
[4:31] Spirit is God and God is love end quote
[4:35] everlasting life and how to receive it
[4:37] in 1954 brother random said quote an
[4:40] everlasting life is God and God is the
[4:42] holy spirit is that right if God in the
[4:44] Holy Spirit isn't the same person Jesus
[4:46] had two fathers end quote
[4:49] so the quotes from Brother Branham are
[4:51] playing that God is love God is the holy
[4:54] spirit so the Holy Spirit and love are
[4:56] the self-same spirit
[4:58] I'll close by reminding our viewers that
[5:01] up until the seals were open brother
[5:03] Branham taught the new birth and the
[5:05] baptism of the Holy Ghost were two
[5:07] separate things there's numerous quotes
[5:08] on this uh the one I'll read is from
[5:11] countdown 1962 but the RAM said quote
[5:14] and the new birth as people talks that
[5:16] the baptism of the Holy Ghost is a new
[5:18] birth now that's wrong the baptism of
[5:20] the Holy Ghost is different from the New
[5:22] Birth the new birth is when you're born
[5:24] again but the Holy Ghost is when power
[5:26] comes into that birth for service end
[5:28] quote
[5:29] now friends after the opening of The
[5:31] Seven Seals we know God began finishing
[5:34] all the Mysteries and so when brother
[5:36] Brandon preached the token in November
[5:38] of 63 brother random used baptism of the
[5:41] Holy Ghost and New Birth interchangeably
[5:44] so a little over a year after that 62
[5:46] countdown quote brother random had
[5:49] received the Revelation from God that
[5:51] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the
[5:52] new birth were one in the same brother
[5:54] Ram's quote says quote it belongs to you
[5:56] when this token is upon you and God has
[5:58] sealed you now we want to check
[5:59] ourselves just for a moment when God has
[6:02] given you the true baptism of the Holy
[6:03] Spirit then the life of Jesus Christ is
[6:05] within you now that's true and every
[6:07] Theologian will have to admit that to be
[6:09] yes sir it's the new birth you're born
[6:11] to new of the Holy Ghost end quote
[6:14] and then the most clear quote on this is
[6:16] from the Sumerian Church age chapter
[6:18] four in the church age book page 154.
[6:21] brother Brown says quote what is the
[6:23] baptism of the Holy Ghost it is the
[6:26] spirit baptizing you into the body of
[6:27] Christ it is the new birth it is a
[6:30] spirit of God coming in and filling you
[6:31] after you have repented having heard his
[6:34] word and been baptized in water as an
[6:36] answer of a good conscience toward God
[6:38] end quote
[6:40] in closing I hope this answer was a
[6:43] blessing
[6:43] and may the Holy Ghost continue to guide
[6:45] you into all truth as Jesus Promised in
[6:48] John 16 verse 13 also friends I'm open
[6:51] to correction so I'll appreciate any
[6:53] feedback if I'm wrong but this is the
[6:55] best of my understanding up to this
[6:57] point by the grace of God and I always
[6:59] want to grow in Grace and knowledge of
[7:01] our Lord Jesus Christ as Peter commands
[7:03] Us in the scripture as always if you
[7:05] have any questions concerns or
[7:07] testimonies about this video please
[7:08] contact me
[7:10] God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[7:13] the desire of your heart
