[0:00] [Music]
[0:06] greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:09] of the lord jesus christ
[0:11] is revelation chapter 7 the bride or the
[0:14] foolish virgin
[0:16] i believe we can prove this great
[0:18] multitude of gentiles is the holy ghost
[0:21] filled bride of jesus christ
[0:24] through five bible proofs as well as six
[0:27] quotes from god's prophet william
[0:30] branham compared to only one quote in
[0:32] which brother branham says it's the
[0:34] foolish virgin
[0:36] and friends this is a minor doctrine not
[0:38] a major
[0:39] but i share these truths because i
[0:41] believe it will help people understand
[0:43] the scriptures better
[0:44] and as always if i'm wrong i'm open to
[0:46] correction
[0:48] we'll begin with the six bible proofs as
[0:50] an exercise and rightly dividing the
[0:52] word of truth as brother branham did
[0:54] many times but specifically when
[0:57] teaching the 24 elders were not angels
[1:00] but human beings
[1:02] he said to consider every detail of the
[1:04] scriptural text when deciding the
[1:06] interpretation
[1:07] let's listen to the quote
[1:10] you people ain't going gonna have time
[1:11] to catch this as you just write down if
[1:13] you want to know they were redeemed man
[1:14] think matthew 19 28.
[1:22] all right 19 28 matthew revelations 3 21
[1:28] then theodore revelations 20 and 4
[1:33] revelations 2 and 10.
[1:38] first peter
[1:39] five
[1:42] two and four
[1:44] second timothy
[1:46] four and eight
[1:50] that'll let you know that they are
[1:52] redeemed i want to go through that this
[1:53] morning and see you just comb it for
[1:55] weeks you see they were not
[1:57] they were not angelic beings they were
[2:00] not heavenly beings they were a redeemed
[2:02] man
[2:03] see you can consider their dress the way
[2:06] they were dressed you can consider their
[2:08] position what they had you consider
[2:10] their songs what they say and know that
[2:12] they were
[2:14] not angelic beings
[2:17] [Music]
[2:20] now beginning with five bible proofs
[2:23] it seems all believers are in agreement
[2:25] that this group are gentiles as verse 9
[2:29] in revelation chapter 7 says it was a
[2:31] great multitude without number of all
[2:33] nations and kindreds and peoples and
[2:36] tongues
[2:37] this group would not be the 144 thousand
[2:40] jews because they are mentioned earlier
[2:42] in the chapter
[2:43] in chapter seven verses one through
[2:46] eight and jews of course are only from
[2:48] one nation
[2:49] israel
[2:51] the first proof that this group is the
[2:53] holy ghost filled bride of jesus christ
[2:55] and not foolish virgins is
[2:58] they are clothed in white robes
[3:00] according to verses 9 and 13.
[3:03] holy ghost-filled christians also called
[3:06] the bride and wise virgins have white
[3:09] robes already in this life because the
[3:12] baptism of the holy ghost is eternal
[3:14] life abiding in their souls
[3:17] but the jews and foolish virgins do not
[3:19] get white robes until the white throne
[3:22] judgment as brother adam taught in
[3:24] chapter 7 in the church age book here's
[3:27] the quote
[3:28] and i quote it is the second
[3:29] resurrection that the souls under the
[3:31] altar as set forth in the fifth seal
[3:34] revelation chapter 6 verses 9 through 11
[3:37] are given white robes and of course
[3:39] eternal life or there would be no point
[3:41] of white robes
[3:43] end quote
[3:45] the bible evidence for this is in
[3:47] revelation chapter 3 verse 4 and the
[3:49] fifth seal of revelation chapter 6 verse
[3:52] 11. revelation 3 verse 4 reads thou hast
[3:55] a few names even in sardis which have
[3:58] not defiled their garments and they
[4:00] shall walk with me in white for they are
[4:03] worthy
[4:04] jesus promised the sardisian saints or
[4:07] saints of the reformation age like
[4:09] martin luther that they would walk with
[4:12] him in white garments jesus also said
[4:15] they had not defiled their garments
[4:17] showing they already had eternal life on
[4:19] the earth
[4:20] walking worthy of jesus is possible in
[4:22] this life as proven by multiple
[4:24] scriptures one of which is colossians 1
[4:27] verse 10
[4:28] that ye might walk worthy of the lord
[4:30] unto all pleasing being fruitful in
[4:32] every good work and increasing in the
[4:34] knowledge of god the fifth seal which
[4:37] reveals the heavenly placement of jews
[4:38] who are not born again
[4:40] shows they are without white robes
[4:42] because they were not born again
[4:44] revelation 6 verse 11 says and white
[4:47] robes were given unto every one of them
[4:49] and it was said unto them that they
[4:51] should rest yet for a little season
[4:53] until their fellow servants also and
[4:55] their brethren that should be killed as
[4:57] they were should be fulfilled
[5:00] the bible conclusion is that the foolish
[5:02] virgins are like jews in the sense their
[5:05] souls are not born again by the baptism
[5:07] of the holy ghost the second proof is
[5:11] their robes are white in the blood
[5:13] according to verse 14.
[5:15] verse 14 seems to connect their white
[5:17] robes to the great tribulations they
[5:19] overcame during their lives
[5:22] their washing took place during their
[5:24] lifetimes which differs from jews under
[5:26] the fist seal because they were promised
[5:28] to be given robes after their lives
[5:32] before looking more into the washing of
[5:33] robes it's necessary to state that there
[5:36] are two kinds of christians wise and
[5:38] foolish as taught by jesus christ
[5:40] himself in matthew 25 verses 1-13
[5:44] according to christ the difference
[5:46] between the wise and foolish was the
[5:48] amount of oil they possessed and we know
[5:50] oil represents the baptism of the holy
[5:52] ghost according to zechariah chapter 4
[5:55] luke 10 34 and revelation 6 verse 6 to
[6:00] name a few
[6:01] this shows wise christians have oil in
[6:03] their souls while foolish virgins are
[6:05] not born again in their souls but have
[6:07] the spirit's anointing in their human
[6:09] minds or human spirits
[6:11] jesus parable shows the wise virgins
[6:14] have extra oil
[6:15] or they have the holy ghost in an extra
[6:18] part of their beings because man is a
[6:20] three-part being
[6:22] so foolish virgins only have the
[6:23] anointing of the holy spirit in their
[6:24] human minds
[6:26] but wise virgins have it in their souls
[6:28] which is the seal of the baptism of the
[6:30] holy ghost
[6:32] for a full teaching on this subject see
[6:34] my video called two kinds of christians
[6:36] in two resurrections
[6:38] friend jesus called his own disciples
[6:40] fools before they were born again in
[6:42] luke 24 verse 25.
[6:45] and remember christ is the same
[6:47] yesterday today and forever
[6:50] paul also differentiates the wise virgin
[6:52] from the foolish in ephesians chapter 5
[6:55] verses 15-17
[6:57] saying the wise virgins redeem their
[6:59] time and understand the will of god see
[7:02] then that ye walk circumspectly not as
[7:04] fools but as wise redeeming the time
[7:07] because the days are evil wherefore be
[7:09] not unwise but understanding what the
[7:12] will of the lord is
[7:14] hebrews 13 verses 20 and 21 provide
[7:17] further support that a holy ghost-filled
[7:19] christian does god's perfect will
[7:22] because they are empowered by the blood
[7:23] of the everlasting covenant
[7:25] which the foolish virgin would not be
[7:27] influenced by as paul previously taught
[7:30] as well in the ephesians 5 verses 15-17
[7:34] scriptures
[7:35] hebrews 13 20-21 says now the god of
[7:38] peace that brought again from the dead
[7:40] our lord jesus that great shepherd of
[7:42] the sheep through the blood of the
[7:44] everlasting covenant make you perfect in
[7:47] every good work to do his will
[7:49] working in you that which is well
[7:50] pleasing in his sight through jesus
[7:52] christ to whom be glory for ever and
[7:55] ever amen
[7:56] we conclude a foolish virgin is not
[7:59] fully washed by the cleansing power of
[8:01] the blood
[8:02] hebrews 10 29 is the proof of this
[8:04] statement claiming believers can be
[8:06] sanctified by the blood but then count
[8:08] it an unholy thing
[8:10] eventually suffering sore punishment
[8:13] hebrews 10 29 says of how much sore
[8:15] punishment suppose ye shall he be
[8:18] thought worthy who hath trodden
[8:19] underfoot the son of god and hath
[8:21] counted the blood of the covenant
[8:23] wherewith he was sanctified an unholy
[8:25] thing and hath done despite unto the
[8:27] spirit of grace
[8:29] the bible gives us the principle that
[8:31] the life is in the blood in leviticus 17
[8:34] verse 11
[8:35] so applying this spiritually the life of
[8:38] jesus christ or his holy spirit comes
[8:42] into a believer's soul as the baptism of
[8:44] the holy ghost when he humbles himself
[8:47] and fully obeys the word of god
[8:49] according to acts chapter 5 verse 32
[8:53] and we are his witnesses of these things
[8:55] and so also is the holy ghost whom god
[8:58] hath given to them that obey him
[9:00] titus chapter 3 verses 5 and 6 speaks of
[9:04] this washing jesus's spirit performs in
[9:07] the believer
[9:08] during the believer's lifetime
[9:11] not by works of righteousness which we
[9:13] have done
[9:14] but according to his mercy he saved us
[9:16] by the washing of regeneration and
[9:18] renewing of the holy ghost
[9:20] which he shed on us abundantly through
[9:23] jesus christ our savior
[9:26] friends brother branham taught this
[9:28] principle as well in numerous places
[9:30] saying the foolish virgin rejected the
[9:32] full effects of the blood of jesus or
[9:35] spirit of god
[9:36] but for time's sake here's two quotes
[9:38] one from the token from november 63
[9:41] and one from questions and answers part
[9:44] two in 1964. let's listen to these two
[9:47] quotes
[9:48] god did the same and the remnant of the
[9:51] woman's seed that was left upon the
[9:53] earth the day is the calling out
[9:56] of the bride out of the church
[10:00] the exit is for the rapture for the
[10:03] church truly goes through the
[10:05] tribulation period as you pentecostal
[10:07] brothers has preached it i don't believe
[10:08] that the church goes to it but not the
[10:10] pride
[10:12] closer
[10:14] someone discussed that with me how all
[10:16] god said the church will have to go
[10:17] through the flower for purification i
[10:19] said that is true because she rejected
[10:22] the blood
[10:23] but if the tribulation period catches
[10:25] the bride his own wife in the
[10:27] tribulation no sir the blood of jesus
[10:30] christ has cleansed us from all sin and
[10:32] there's no more purifying than the blood
[10:35] of jesus christ and that token has
[10:37] identification that has been purified
[10:41] that's the token of the bride
[10:44] wearing the ring
[10:48] now just a minute
[10:50] will the polish virgin be safe no
[10:52] whatever happens she happens now after
[10:55] that time she's in the state now she
[10:57] will have to go through the tribulation
[10:59] period and the reason of it is is
[11:01] because she has rejected the atonement
[11:04] in its fullness she is a believer a
[11:07] professed believer but she will have to
[11:09] go through the tribulation period the
[11:10] bible says the rest of them the dragon
[11:13] spurted water out of his mouth they go
[11:15] and make war and what an hour that is
[11:19] regarding the questions and answers part
[11:21] 2 1964 quote notice that later in the
[11:24] sermon he said the foolish virgin are
[11:26] saved so brother graham's answer meant
[11:29] the foolish virgin would have to die
[11:31] during the tribulation period and
[11:33] wouldn't be spared from death during the
[11:34] tribulation
[11:36] now the church
[11:38] the the
[11:40] nominal believers like lot
[11:44] he's going through the tribulation
[11:46] period
[11:47] see and be saved as if it was before
[11:51] noah went through the tribulation period
[11:54] carried above it come out with ham who
[11:56] polluted the earth again
[11:58] see
[11:59] lot came out his own daughter slept with
[12:02] him and had children by his own
[12:03] daughters
[12:06] but abraham brought forth the royal seed
[12:10] brought forth the seed of the promise
[12:13] enoch went to glory in the rapture just
[12:16] took a walk and went home and never went
[12:18] through the tribulation period
[12:19] you see
[12:22] the third proof is the mention of great
[12:25] tribulation in verse 14.
[12:27] this does not seem to speak of the seven
[12:30] year tribulation period or jacob's
[12:32] trouble which is the last and 70th week
[12:35] of daniel's 70 weeks prophecy because
[12:38] this is a gentile group here in
[12:40] revelation chapter 7 and not a jewish
[12:42] group
[12:44] see my video called five reasons the
[12:46] rapture is pre-tribulation
[12:48] for a full teaching on this subject
[12:51] this great tribulation here in
[12:53] revelation 7 seems to speak of the
[12:55] lasting persecution upon christians over
[12:58] the past 2000 years
[13:01] even before paul's conversion acts
[13:03] chapter 8 verse 1 says there was great
[13:06] persecution against christians in
[13:08] jerusalem
[13:09] and saul was consenting unto his death
[13:12] and at that time there was a great
[13:13] persecution against the church which was
[13:16] at jerusalem
[13:17] the great christian persecution has
[13:19] never ceased
[13:20] theologian samuel schmucker estimated 68
[13:23] million christians were martyred from
[13:25] the time augustine gave his approval for
[13:28] persecution in the fifth century until
[13:31] schmucker's lifetime in the 19th century
[13:34] and i got this from rachel hasseltine's
[13:36] book how did it happen
[13:38] page 282 the book was written in 1958
[13:43] today the esther project estimates
[13:45] nearly 35 million christians were
[13:47] martyred during the 20th century alone
[13:50] at the hands of communistic and fascist
[13:53] governments
[13:54] numerous new testament passages speak of
[13:57] tribulation or persecution as an
[14:00] expected experience for holy
[14:01] ghost-filled christians here's four
[14:03] examples
[14:05] 2 timothy 2 verse 12 yes and all that
[14:08] live godly in christ jesus shall suffer
[14:11] persecution
[14:12] matthew 13 21 yet hath he not rooting
[14:16] himself but dearth for a while for when
[14:18] tribulation or persecution ariseth
[14:21] because of the word by and by he is
[14:23] offended
[14:25] romans 5 verse 3 and not only so but we
[14:28] glory in tribulation also knowing that
[14:31] tribulation worketh patience
[14:33] romans chapter 12 verse 12 rejoicing in
[14:36] hope patient and tribulation
[14:39] continuing instant in prayer
[14:41] god has not forgotten the millions upon
[14:44] millions of christian martyrs
[14:47] one reward for these courageous saints
[14:48] will be living and reigning during the
[14:50] one thousand year millennial time period
[14:53] according to revelation chapter 20
[14:55] verses four through six
[14:57] and i saw thrones and they sat upon them
[14:59] and judgment was given unto them
[15:02] and i saw the souls of them that were
[15:04] beheaded for the witness of jesus and
[15:06] for the word of god and which had not
[15:08] worshipped the beast neither his image
[15:10] neither had received his mark upon their
[15:12] foreheads or in their hands and they
[15:15] lived and reigned with christ a thousand
[15:17] years
[15:18] but the rest of the dead lived not again
[15:20] until the thousand years were finished
[15:22] this is the first resurrection
[15:24] blessed and holy is he that hath part in
[15:26] the first resurrection on such the
[15:28] second death hath no power but they
[15:31] shall be priests of god and of christ
[15:33] and shall reign with him a thousand
[15:34] years
[15:36] i trust you can now see how the
[15:37] revelation chapter 7 great multitude was
[15:40] the wise virgin saints because they
[15:43] washed their robes white with the blood
[15:45] of jesus christ as they endured great
[15:48] tribulation during their lifetimes
[15:51] the fourth proof is they serve in the
[15:53] temple according to verse 15.
[15:56] the great multitude is worshiping and
[15:58] serving day and night in his temple
[16:01] this group has to be the wise virgin or
[16:03] bride of jesus christ because they are
[16:06] actively serving in the temple as
[16:08] brother branham correctly taught who
[16:09] serves the husband but the wife
[16:12] the foolish virgins were just that
[16:14] foolish
[16:15] they were not the same quality of
[16:17] believer as a wise virgin
[16:19] as jesus twice called believers foolish
[16:22] in matthew 25 verse 2 and luke 24 verse
[16:25] 25
[16:27] the foolish virgins are likely resting
[16:30] or waiting under the altar
[16:32] like the blinded jews of the fifth seal
[16:34] because both groups are not born again
[16:37] revelation chapter 6 verse 11 says the
[16:40] blinded jews must rest yet for a little
[16:43] season
[16:44] so the fact that this gentile multitude
[16:46] will serve in the temple seems to make
[16:48] this scene a picture of the gentile
[16:51] bride of jesus christ who were saved
[16:53] during the 2000 year church ages as they
[16:56] worship and serve jesus christ in the
[16:58] heavenly temple after the rapture it's
[17:01] likely a scene from the marriage supper
[17:03] of the lamb or presentation of jesus's
[17:05] bride or perhaps the scene from the
[17:07] judgment seat of christ which all saints
[17:10] will stand before in order to receive
[17:12] rewards according to second corinthians
[17:14] 5 verse 10
[17:16] for we must all appear before the
[17:18] judgment seat of christ that everyone
[17:20] may receive the things done in his body
[17:22] according to that he hath done whether
[17:24] it be good or bad
[17:26] the foolish virgins would not be present
[17:28] at the marriage supper the next event
[17:31] they would attend would be the great
[17:33] white throne judgment which is after the
[17:35] 1000 year millennial reign of christ and
[17:38] his bride upon the earth
[17:40] the fifth proof is that the term the
[17:42] great multitude is only used for the
[17:45] bride in verse 9 and also in revelation
[17:48] chapter 19
[17:49] verses 6 8 and 14.
[17:52] this great multitude term is used twice
[17:55] in scripture revelation 7 verse 9 and
[17:58] revelation 19 verse 6.
[18:00] the context of revelation 19 verse 6 is
[18:03] the bride of jesus christ as seen in
[18:06] verses 6 through 8 and verse 14.
[18:09] notice in verse 14 that this bride group
[18:11] is again identified as wearing white
[18:13] robes the symbolism of eternal life
[18:16] and i heard as it were the voice of a
[18:18] great multitude and as the voice of many
[18:20] waters and as the voice of mighty
[18:22] thundering saying alleluia for the lord
[18:25] god omnipotent reigneth let us be glad
[18:27] and rejoice and give honor to him for
[18:30] the marriage of the lamb has come and
[18:31] his wife hath made herself ready
[18:34] and to her was granted that she should
[18:36] be a raid and find linen clean and white
[18:39] for the fine linen is the righteousness
[18:41] of saints and the armies which were in
[18:43] heaven followed him upon white horses
[18:45] clothed in fine linen white and clean
[18:48] it seems this scene from revelation
[18:50] chapter 19 verses 6 through 8 is again
[18:53] right after the rapture which also
[18:55] includes the bride presentation the
[18:57] marriage supper of the lamb communion
[19:00] and rewards at the judgment seat of
[19:02] christ
[19:03] the context of revelation chapter 19
[19:05] verse 14 is the battle of armageddon in
[19:08] which jesus defeats the false prophet or
[19:11] pope antichrist and the beast or
[19:14] antichrist spirit with a sword of his
[19:16] word from his mouth before the glorious
[19:18] one thousand-year millennial reign of
[19:20] christ and his bride
[19:23] next here's the six quotes versus the
[19:25] one quote from brother branham about
[19:27] this scene in revelation 7 verses 9
[19:30] through 17.
[19:32] remember friends six quotes claim
[19:34] revelation 7 verses 9 to 17 is the bride
[19:38] compared to the one quote brother random
[19:40] says it's the foolish virgin
[19:42] the quotes will now be heard in
[19:44] chronological order
[19:56] [Applause]
[19:59] that's what she says
[20:00] [Music]
[20:06] jesus they would come up by the great
[20:08] tribulation
[20:09] called holy lord made fun of persecuted
[20:12] right there
[20:14] come up by the great tribulation and our
[20:16] blessings
[20:17] and make them white in the blood of the
[20:18] lamb
[20:20] what they are before the throne of god
[20:23] where is the wise stage where's the
[20:25] queen saying that's the bride

[23:29] where he seemed 144 000 sealed and after
[23:32] that he saw coming up coming back was
[23:34] that great number which no man could
[23:36] number which was the bride it will have
[23:39] no
[23:39] malachi 4 will be finished and the bride
[23:43] taken up
[23:44] and
[23:46] then
[23:48] this group of elijah and elisha return
[23:51] back to the earth for the church to go
[23:54] through the tribulation period but
[23:56] elijah and elisha will not have anything
[23:58] to do with the sleeping virgin they're
[24:00] gentiles they'll be sent only to the
[24:02] jews
[24:05] god is talking about the bride here

[24:09] her
[24:10] it is over in revelation 7 4-17
[24:15] now
[24:16] will you find out
[24:17] also in this that the sixth uh seal now
[24:22] being open it was for a threefold
[24:24] purpose
[24:25] now
[24:26] here was the purposes the first thing
[24:29] was that his sleeping virgin had to go
[24:32] through
[24:33] the tribulation period for purification
[24:36] she had to be purged of her sins of
[24:39] unbelief and rejecting the message
[24:42] this she was done in the tribulation
[24:44] period we see they wind up over here in
[24:46] revelation 7 between the 6th and 7th uh
[24:50] chapter here that she had been purged
[24:53] and she had been given her robes now
[24:55] she's not the bride but it's a church
[25:05] in closing i hope this video has been a
[25:07] blessing and i hope it's been edifying
[25:09] to see both the scriptures the five
[25:11] scriptural proofs and the six quotes
[25:14] that point to this group being the wise
[25:16] virgin the bride of jesus christ again
[25:19] this is not a major doctrine but a minor
[25:22] because it relates to future events
[25:24] the main thing right now is to make sure
[25:26] your soul is baptized with the holy
[25:28] ghost
[25:29] i trust you were edified by these five
[25:31] bible proofs perhaps you've never heard
[25:33] them before along with the six quotes
[25:35] perhaps you didn't know there were six
[25:36] quotes from brother branham that said
[25:39] this group was the bride of jesus christ
[25:41] or the wise virgins please contact me
[25:43] with any questions concerns or
[25:45] testimonies about this video
[25:49] god bless you and may jesus christ be
[25:51] the desire of your heart
