TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] and just remember from the West will come a white horse rider amen we'll ride this Trail again it's a promise greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to answer a question I received from numerous viewers and brothers and the question is about the quote from brother Brandon where he says I'll ride this Trail again I want to give my best understanding on this question and I could be wrong of course but I'm just going to give my best understanding by the grace of God this is a subject I'd like feedback on I'd like thoughts from other believers who study the word of God the quotes and pray it's similar to that of the seven Thunders I'm open to further Revelation by the grace of God hi friends I'm Jesse Smith pastor bride of Christ Fellowship here in akan Ohio we're coming up on our 18th year anniversary by the grace of God and I defend the Bible revelations that Jesus Christ revealed to his true Prophet The Late William brandom 1909 and 1965 and I defend brother brandom's Godly Christian character here's the simple order of this video first I'll review the question that I've received and I'll State my general answer second we'll look at the timeline of quotes from God's Prophet brother brandham and play them and third we'll finish with two thus sayith the Lord's statements brother brandham spoke out west in the four or five sermons he preached before the Lord took him home and the reason I say four or five is if you call the last recording a full sermon or not communion from December 12th 1965 so let's begin let's look at the question from numerous people and my answer first question I got was from a brother in December 2021 will you please tell me your view on this subject of I'll ride this Trail again because the prophet told us with thus the Lord in the first quote and he's referring to a quote from the God of this evil age August 1st 1965 so here's my answer by God's grace it's one of three possibilities and of course there could be more possibilities it's either one brother brandham will come back from the dead and do a preaching tour or two brother bram's Ministry would continue in the bride through the Holy Ghost anointing upon other living men like Elisha continued Elijah's Ministry and fulfill Revelation 10: 8-1 or third brother Brighton was going to speak with authority out west before he died and the Lord took him to heaven so I personally think the second possibility is the most likely fulfillment of this statement arod this Trail again but it also could be a combination of the second and third it could have been brother bram's Ministry was going to continue through other anointed men and he was also going to speak with authority out west before he passed away and also friends there's about six quotes on this topic so if there's others please let me know five of the quotes say I'll ride this Trail once more or I'll ride this Trail again and then the six quote doesn't say I'll ride this Trail again but brother random does talk about two brothers who had the same dreams about him it was the quote the brother mentioned from from the God of this evil age 1965 where brother random said it's thus say the lord it's something coming forth from God it's also interesting to note friends that the last time brother Ram spoke about this subject of I'll ride this Trail again was the evening of November 28th 1965 so in the last month or so the last 27 or 28 days of brother Adam's life and in this final five recordings on tape he never mentioned I'll ride this Trail again during that final month or so of his life here on Earth by God's grace now let's do the timeline of quotes from brother brandom and play them so we can have a good understanding or general understanding of his statements about this subject the first quote is from God of this evil age August 1st the morning service 1965 brother Rand said something's just getting ready to happen I know it talks about Junior Jackson having a dream and another man from Oregon he says I don't know the interpretation that's important to to note he's waiting on the Lord but it is thus sayith the Lord something coming forth from God I don't know what it is and he says the holy spirit is withholding the interpretation thereof from me but I know God is fixing to do something it'll be glorious in our eyes let's listen to the quote now I want to say that there's something just getting ready to happen I know it many of you here remember when brother Junior Jackson come to me a little bit before going towards Arizona of a dream he had a strange thing how many remembers that and the lord gave us the interpretation and it happened to the letter now he just had another dream something and the strange thing a man was here the day from Argan doesn't hardly know me and was dream the same dream about the junior Jackson dream and and and come to me I don't know the interpretation I'm waiting for the Lord but I know it's going to be something from God just remember that thus sayeth the Lord it's something coming forth from God I don't know what it is really striking very striking frankly according to the the dreams that both man one of them he might be a Baptist Pres tan he might be sitting here this morning I don't know he's here of the day I don't know the man but he told the dream with tears in his eyes and shooking he come all the way from Argan here to express it brother Jackson come in like man this morning one man not knowing the other one thousands of miles from the other and both dreams just exactly on the same thing so the holy spirit is withholding the interpretation thereof from me I don't know what to tell the man but I know God is fixing to do something and it'll be glorious in our eyes the next quote is from August 15th and knoweth it not 1965 brother BR gives us more details about the dreams in the dreams brother Brandon is dressed in white riding a white horse he's dressed up like an Indian chief he's got Authority in his words he screamed I'll ride this Trail once more it seems like brother Brandon was also so withstanding another person a false prophet and again brother Brandon was asked what does it mean and he says I don't know so it seems like there's at least three dreams or statements about brother brandom being dressed in white on a white horse in this quote junior Jackson Leo Mercer and Roy borders so Junior Jackson's dream said brother Ram took to the skies and you were gone towards the West so this statement makes me think it it might mean brother Brandon was going to preach out west and then die the Lord was going to take him home uh Leo Mercer said he never heard such a command so again brother Brandon giving commands makes me think of thus sayith the Lord commands because there could be no greater Authority than saying thus sayith the Lord then Roy borderers says you were packed toward the west and then but I think this dream was more about brother random going out west to get meet the angels and then come back east and preach the Seven Seals but again I could be wrong let's listen to the quote from and knoweth it not then he started holding his heart to cry right there in the room he said Mr brandom I realize I got to stand before God he said I don't know whether I sleep or what happened he said I dreamed I'm going to say as asleep and I dream said said a Bo shook the whole earth said the Earth shook from my feet I said I after quit shaking I Heard a Voice and said brother BR was your voice said I know it just something said that to him said he said I'll ride this Trail once more instead I started looking up the rock like this looked on into past the clouds and way up there standing on a rock that reached from the East to the West in a porned shaped like that like a pyramid run back here to the East and said there you would stand there on a horse that I never seen anything like it in my life Great White Horse white man hanging down and said you dressed like an Indian chief with all the things the Indians use said he had a breastplate and Bangals on the arms and all down around like that said you had your hands up like that and said that horse standing there like a military horse with a prince like this walking he standing still and said you pulled on the Rings went riding off towards the West said I look down there and there's a whole lot of scientists and the next morning that was Saturday on the next morning I preached on scientist you know being of the devil and said scientist is there pouring things in tubes and mixing it said you stop the horse raised up your hands again and screamed I'll ride this Trail once more and so the whole earth Shook and people shook they looked up look one another like that looked up to you they just Shug their shoulders went on with their scientific research and said you started going on towards your West and when I did said I seen this man that called himself a prophet you know said he come up on a horse that was mixed with white and black together and said he got up behind this great big horse said it was said way up above the clouds in the road wasn't over about that whyne and said that horse just said the wind blowing the feathers and everything on on your Garb and said then the horse man and tail blowing Great Master big quiet horse walking right line and said and said this guy run up behind you come from towards Canada and the man lives in Canada and he said come back and said he took his little horse trying to knock your big horse off turn him around make his hips hit against the said never move the big horse he just kept walking said then all of a sudden said you turned around said that' be the third third time You' spoke but the second time you said all righted and said you didn't speak like you did you commanded said you turned around and call the man by name and said get off of here you know that no man can ride this road here without God beain him to do it get off of here and said the man turned around and said the man has wrote me letters and said across his horse's hips that black and gray and mixed up together said across his horse's hips was wrote his name signature just exactly he's on his letter and he rode off towards an AR said then you went on down that big horse turned around way as far west as you could said he stood and raised your hands up like that and he started crying said brother B see that hor stand all that war onet and everything like that and said that breastplate and everything shining said you held your hands up a little while and said he looked down again picked up the rain said I'll ride this Trail just once more so the whole earth Shook Back and Forth like that and said there was no more life in me I just fell down side The Rock and I woke up said what does it mean sir I said I don't know home next morning Junior Jackson Who dreamed about the pyamid you know when I went out west you remember that he called me a month or two before that he had a dream this Burning he had to tell me and I said Billy there's about 20 standing out there he said Junior Jackson there said he had to tell you that dream I said send him in just about 5 minutes he brought his wife in and he said it for a witness said it and I seen it coming and I watched it and what it was is a man on a horse and said he coming with lightning speed said I seen he going to come down in front of me and I stopped my car jumped out when it did said the car horse is stand Road a great white military horse walking in a prince that's the word of course you know walking in a prince said there's a man sitting on there said he he dressed in Western guard wasn't a cowboy but said look like a chief over Rangers or something see all of his chief Authority from the West Indians over the Indians Rangers or and said the man had his head pulled down and he was looking sideways and said when he turned sideways said it was you brother random said you never talk like you did he said Junior called him three times and said I'll tell you what to do and said then you pulled up on the ring this horse he made about three Lopes and Tuck to the skies you were gone towards the West he said just a minute I looked around and here come a horse smaller than that and of the same breed but smaller and stood so I walked around said he must sent this back for me said I got in Junior's done a little rideing T and he said you know how your saddle fits your brother Brandon stps and everything then day before yesterday 3 days ago come Leo Mercer coming down with exactly the same dream not knowing nothing about it about trying to breed a big white stallion to a black May and they couldn't do it nervous so I walked up there said Leo and told him what I did I don't want to say it here see I told him I did said don't you see not to know this I didn't know Ed Dalton had a son-in-law and a son-in-law had a dog with this name you'll know Leo as you're dreaming but when you wake up remember and said I never heard such a command about that time Roy Roberson come in and said brother BR you remember back there before you left the church the first time we I seen you sitting like in Palestine with all the board and everything sitting like the Lord's supper table and then you talking and you you wasn't sure what she talking about said a white cloud come down and got you packed away how many remembers the the dream of brother Roy and said the White Cloud packed you away and said then you was gone I walked through the streets screaming and crying when I come up out here and that little old arm crippled up like was reading this he dropped the r and started crying when he see me come up out there I had seen so he tell me the dream and he said and he was raking I said and and you went away said I walk the streets everywhere trying to find you I couldn't find you nowhere I screaming oh brother bam don't leave that a white cloud coming and got you and packed you away from us towards the West as before the PID or anything said pack you towards and I cried and I walk the streets and de while I went and set the table I had look up there at the head of the table said I can just see that much of you as Snow White said you stand there and said you spoke with authority there was no guessing to it that am man understood exactly what she was saying oh my brother sister now everyone of you conscious I know what that means just what stay close to Christ let me warn you now as a minister of the Gospel of this don't take any foolishness don't imagine anything stay right there until this inside of the inside is anchored to the word that you're writing Christ because that's the only thing that's going to because we're in the most deceiving age that we ever lived in it would see the very elected if it was possible because they have anointing they can do anything like the rest of them clean your lives up pay your debts oh no man Jesus said not I mean like your house Ren stuff you got to do it get all your things off your hands get everything right Make Ready Get Ready remember in the name of the Lord something's fixing to happen I'm going into the Hills this week not it's AC hun S course I like the hunt squirrel but I'm going out there for this purpose saying oh God I don't know which way to move and I don't want to miss this help me you pray for me will you do it I'll be praying for you I hope by the mercies of God that I meet every one of him we meet in a better land than this year next quote is from November 28th the morning service brother brand says I'll ride this Trail again is a promise apparently of a Revival but again there's no interpretation given and there's no thus sayith the Lord about any details regarding this dream or these dreams it's a very brief short statement brother random says will there be another Revival he says just remember from the West will come a white horse rider we'll ride this Trail again that's right soon as we get ready it's a promise and it's interesting brother brandom says we'll ride this Trail again so more than one person it seems like again this makes me think I ride this Trail again means a group of preachers and notice brother Ram says it's a promise in other words the dreams were thus sayith the Lord but he didn't have the interpretation and here in this quote he doesn't say he has the interpretation so we got to be careful how we interpret this let's listen to the quote now there's I was getting pretty old and I thought will I will there be another Revival I'll see another time and just remember from the West will come a white horse rider amen we'll ride this Trail again it's a [Music] promise and the last mention is again the same day November 28th in the evening service brother R says he's ready to ride the trail he's reporting for service of course this is after he tells the experience he had of God healing him from his stomach issue he said why me an old man suffered all my life would God heal me now I believe I ride this Trail again I got to bring a message Lord your servants reporting for service amen I'm ready and that's the final mention by God's grace why me an old man suffered all my life why did he heal me now I believe I'll ride this Trail [Music] again got to bring a message I say to my father tonight as Junior seen in a a dream the other night of the wings of this Dove moving in these wind this year Lord your servants reporting for service amen I'm ready remember friends brother random would pass away less than a month later December 24th 1965 I like to also give the scriptures of why I think these set of Dreams could mean that a Ministry of Brothers The Fold Ministry would preach brother Ram's message around the world I believe that would be the most likely interpretation of this dream you can find this in First Kings 19:15 through 17 Elijah was given three commands to anoint three people but he himself only fulfilled one of those commands in person he was commanded to anoint haziel King over Syria Elijah did not do this it seems Elisha did this in 2 Kings 81 13-15 second Elijah was to anoint juu King over Israel Elijah did not do this in person it looks like a son of a prophet anointed juu king in 2 Kings 91-113 and the third command Was Elijah to anoint Elisha a prophet in his room this is the one thing that he did do in person 2 Kings 29-15 the double portion of the Holy Ghost fell on Elisha so here we get the idea God told Elijah specific specifically you're going to anoint three people but he didn't he only did one and then God used other people to anoint the other two individuals so here we see how God can interpret his word any way he wants this story helps us understand why brother brandom could speak something in the name of the Lord and He himself may not have done it someone else could have done it so we have to leave that open as a possibility because that's a scriptural example and the scripture is the absolute also I want to say that I reject the teaching that brother brandham will rise from the dead and return for another worldwide preaching Ministry this is often called the return Ministry and I do not believe in that because we're supposed to look for Jesus's return and not brother brandom's return the Bible never tells us to look for any other return other than the Lord Jesus Christ of course we understand the dead in Christ will rise first before the Rapture and this will include brother brandom but we're not expecting brother brandham or anyone else to have any Revival Ministry so I believe this interpretation of other men preaching brother bram's message to be the best fulfilling of the I'll ride this Trail again set of dreams and I believe this will fulfill Revelation 10 vers 8- 11 because the revelation of the open book must be taken around the world and brother brandom even said himself he may not do it but the message will introduce Jesus Christ to the world so the message must go around the world before judgment can fall and then the Rapture can take place as Jesus said in Matthew 24:14 this gospel must be preached to every nation and then the end will come in Look Away to Jesus December 29th 1963 brother randam said I may not do it but this message will introduce Jesus Christ to the world let's listen to the quote and I want to say this I've never said it before but according to scripture according to what he said 30 years ago 33 years ago on the river down there in 19 and33 rather what he said everything has happened just exactly I may not do it but this message will introduce Jesus Christ to the world for as John the Baptist was sent to forerun the first coming so is the message to forerun the second coming and John said Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world so it's it paralleled it in every way and I know it will the message will go on and one final point the few churches that I've been in contact with or heard about that our return Ministry churches have all been surrounded with false Doctrine and sinful wickedness for example one return Ministry Church has adultery going on with the preachers and other people in the church that proves that this leaven of a false Doctrine if it's not taken out will spread to the entire church and another church has even worse sins I'm not going to mention but even worse sins abusive sins so Jesus said a tree is known by its fruit so this obvious corrupt sinful Wicked fruit in the return Ministry churches I believe proves again that's a false Doctrine we're not expecting brother Bram to come back and preach and have a Revival Ministry now for this final section here I want to look at two thus sayith the Lord's statements out west now the reason I'm sharing these is because the dreams about brother brandham riding this Trail again show that he spoke with authority and there could be no greater Authority than saying thus sayith the Lord and again brother random preached his last five sermons out west or four sermons depending on if you consider communion a sermon or not and he gave two thus sayith the Lord statements the first was he was reiterating the Los Angeles sinking prophecy seems like he was giving an authorative warning to the people out west this was in leadership 1965 December 7th brother brandom said Church unless you get right with God you're doomed thus sayith the Holy Spirit now I want to share something too it seems like God had mercy on these people out in California because they were not doomed in other words they probably got to live on the rest of their lives some of them still could be alive today but it seems like that generation must have repented because they were not doomed Los Angeles has not yet sunk into the ocean and that would make sense because brother BR said every generation gets a chance at the word of God and also God cannot judge the righteous with the wicked as Genesis 18- 19 show us God had to call all the foolish virgin out of Sodom before he destroyed Sodom and so it seems the same would apply today because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever it seems likely God would have to call all the foolish virgins out of Los Angeles before he destroys it but again I could be wrong on that but it's seems like because we've had all these years 59 years since brother brandom gave this prophecy that God is showing Mercy but again that's just my own thought that's my own personal opinion but let's listen to the statement thus sayith the Lord from leadership here's the quote look here do you know what the Lord says about Los Angeles and these places here she's gone you remember what I told you about two years ago how that earthquake of coming can up here in Alaska I also tell you that Hollywood in Los Angeles is sliding into the ocean California you're doomed not only California but you were you're doomed Church unless you get right with God you're doomed thus saith the Holy Spirit have you ever heard me use that name unless it come to pass asked you you've known me 20 years did I ever tell you anything in the name of the Lord but what come to pass if everything I've ever told you would happen happen say amen I tell you now's the hour you better be getting right all of us and the final thus say the statement is actually from that same sermon leadership 1965 December 7th brother Ram talks about how women wear sexy clothes and they have the spirit of a street prostitute brother Ram quotes Jesus from Matthew 5 whosoever lookth on a woman to lust after has already committed adultery with her in his heart brother Ram says that women say they don't make any other clothes but brother Ram says they got goods and sewing machines there's no excuse that's exactly I don't want to hurt you and this is not a joke this is thus say the Lord from the scripture brother Ram said I'm an old man I haven't got much longer to stay but I've got to tell the truth if this is my last message it's the truth see don't sister don't brother again this seems to be a very anointed statement because he speaks with thus sayith the Lord and this is the last full sermon brother Brandon preached cuz the next sermon was just a short statement brother brother random had about communion but this is his last full sermon and notice he said if this is my last message it's the truth so this seems to be an authorative thus sayi the Lord's statement that women have to make effort to wear modest clothing and men should not lust after women who are dressed immodestly so that's the second authoritative statement with thus say the Lord let's listen to the quote what kind of homes he going to have he takes a strip teas a burs off of the street out here a street prostitute oh say now wait a minute how does she dress herself amen wear shorts and they say street prostitute oh you say now brother one them little old tight skirts look like you're poured into street prostitute Jesus said whosoever lookth upon a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her in his heart then he's got to answer for that and what she do she present herself who's guilty amen think of it you say they don't make any other clothes they got goods and sewing machines no excuse exactly I I don't want to hurt you and this is not a joke this is thus sayeth the Lord from the scriptures it's exactly true friend I'm an old man I haven't got much longer to stay but I've got to tell you the truth if this is my last message it's the truth see don't sister don't brother in closing friends I hope this short video was a blessing by the grace of God again with every quote and statement from brother brandom we have to take it back to the scripture we have to rightly divide the word of Truth we have to prove all things and so I believe the scriptures on this video like First Kings 19 and all the Kings verses about Elijah and Elisha really help us understand this statement also Revelation 108-111 and Matthew 24:14 remember brother random says God can't give us anything outside the word everything that's spoken in the name of the Lord must have some scriptural bible-based Foundation by the grace of God I look forward to the comments or email me please if you have any other further quotes about this subject I'd really like to understand it better by God's grace I'm open to correction I'd like to get your thoughts on it as well but of course it's got to be scriptural Thoughts by the grace of God and again I appreciate the questions about this and hope this was a help by the grace of God if you have questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
