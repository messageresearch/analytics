[0:13] a harlot or
[0:15] [Music]
[0:17] in Revelation 17: 1 15 and 16 this
[0:22] church is called a great
[0:25] [Music]
[0:32] the Greek word for is the same
[0:34] word for Harlot both mean a woman that
[0:37] yields herself to defilement for the
[0:39] sake of gain metaphorically and
[0:42] idolatrous speaks of Babylon I.E Rome
[0:46] the chief seat of
[0:47] idolatry in Revelation 17:5 this church
[0:51] is called the mother of harlots and
[0:56] Abominations from these scriptures we
[0:58] see that the Roman Catholic Church as an
[1:00] Unfaithful woman or church has yielded
[1:03] herself to defilement for the sake of
[1:05] gain she has been untrue to her Lord and
[1:08] his Bible and has become the chief seat
[1:10] of idolatry through the worship or
[1:12] veneration of statues and
[1:15] images but the True Church of Christ is
[1:18] married to Christ in Romans 7:4 and
[1:21] therefore will not add or take away from
[1:23] the Bible according to Revelation 22: 18
[1:27] and 19 but this false Church Church the
[1:30] Roman Catholic Church claims to be the
[1:32] Church of Christ or married to Christ
[1:35] but is unfaithful to her husband and the
[1:37] Bible and receives and spreads false
[1:40] doctrines in order to get monetary gain
[1:44] the Roman Catholic Church is a harlot
[1:46] because she has received the seeds or
[1:48] false teachings of the devil and shared
[1:50] those lies with peoples from nearly
[1:52] every nation Revelation
[1:55] 17:2 and 18:3 said she committed
[1:59] fornication with the kings of the
[2:04] Earth the Roman Catholic church has
[2:06] shared her love with Kings and Nations
[2:09] pleasing governments and people rather
[2:11] than pleasing her husband Christ the
[2:15] [Music]
[2:16] word here is a very brief list of the
[2:19] false seed or false Doctrine the Roman
[2:22] Catholic church has received from evil
[2:24] spirits and then has shared and spread
[2:26] all over the world with Kings and
[2:28] Nations and multitudes and
[2:31] peoples mandatory clerical
[2:35] celibacy the Roman Catholic Church
[2:37] forces all priests to be
[2:40] [Music]
[2:42] celibate which contradicts the Bible
[2:45] truth that even St Peter was married
[2:47] whom they claimed to be their first pope
[2:49] although we know he wasn't the Bible
[2:51] plainly teaches that Jesus healed
[2:53] Peter's mother-in-law in Matthew 8: 14
[2:57] and 15 St Paul the celibate prophet of
[3:00] God even taught that St Peter was
[3:02] married in 1 Corinthians 9:5 St Paul
[3:05] also wrote that seducing spirits and
[3:08] doctrines of devils teach that marriage
[3:10] should be forbidden in 1 Timothy 4:
[3:15] 1-3
[3:17] transubstantiation this false Doctrine
[3:19] teaches that the Bread and Wine are
[3:21] changed into substance and not
[3:23] appearance into the literal body and
[3:26] blood of Jesus the change by which the
[3:28] substance the not the appearance of
[3:31] Bread and Wine in the Eucharist becomes
[3:33] Christ's real presence that is his body
[3:36] and blood this is a gross false teaching
[3:40] as the Bible teaches that our communion
[3:42] today is not with the literal blood and
[3:44] Body of Christ but with the Holy Ghost
[3:47] in 2 Corinthians
[3:49] 13:14 The Bread and Wine are just
[3:51] symbols of the body and blood of the
[3:52] Lord Jesus and not the literal body and
[3:55] blood St Paul taught that we do not know
[3:58] Jesus after the Flesh and blood anymore
[4:01] in 2 Corinthians
[4:05] 5:16 the catechism of the Catholic
[4:07] Church teaches that the literal presence
[4:09] of Jesus exists in those bodies of those
[4:13] who partake of their communion as long
[4:15] as the bread and wine is able to subsist
[4:18] in their system which would be only
[4:20] around 6 to 8 hours or so but the Bible
[4:23] teaches that the communion with the Holy
[4:25] Ghost the presence of the Holy Spirit as
[4:27] the Seal of God lasts until the day of
[4:30] our redemption in Ephesians
[4:32] 4:30 in our souls the Roman Catholic
[4:36] Church believes the presence of Christ
[4:38] is the Eucharist but the True Church of
[4:40] Christ believes the Holy Ghost is the
[4:42] presence of Christ in our
[4:44] midst transubstantiation is another form
[4:47] of idolatry which again breaks the first
[4:53] commandment the Holy Father the Pope the
[4:56] word Pope means father in the Greek
[4:59] Jesus specifically taught that we should
[5:01] call no man father in Matthew
[5:06] 23:9 the Bible never created an office
[5:09] of a pope the New Testament preaching
[5:11] offices are Apostle Prophet teacher
[5:14] pastor and evangelist according to
[5:16] Ephesians 4:1 the pope is also called
[5:19] Holy Father which is absolute heresy and
[5:22] man worship as the only time the title
[5:25] Holy Father was used in the Bible was
[5:28] when Jesus prayed to his father
[5:30] God Almighty and called him Holy Father
[5:32] in John
[5:36] 17:1 the pope is receiving worship and
[5:39] being called a title that was alone
[5:41] meant for God himself again breaking the
[5:43] first
[5:45] commandment kissing a Pope's hand or
[5:47] bowing to a pope or priest it is common
[5:51] to see people kissing the Pope's hand
[5:53] and even bowing to him the Bible teaches
[5:55] that we are not to bow to Any Man In
[5:57] Worship or kiss any man's hand
[6:00] this is man worship and breaks the first
[6:03] commandment veneration of statues and
[6:06] images pertaining to images the CCC
[6:10] states that the seventh ecumenical
[6:11] council at NAA in 1787 Justified the
[6:16] veneration of images of Christ the
[6:18] mother of God angels and all the saints
[6:21] while this Council may have Justified
[6:23] the veneration of images and statues the
[6:26] Bible never did Catholics worldwide Bow
[6:29] Down to images kiss them rub them weep
[6:32] on them and further exalt them in a way
[6:34] that God never commanded towards any
[6:37] image or man-made statue those behaviors
[6:40] like bowing kissing rubbing weeping all
[6:44] break the first commandment about having
[6:46] no other gods and making no graven image
[6:48] unto any likeness that is in heaven on
[6:51] the earth or in the
[6:53] water without a doubt due to the
[6:55] veneration of statues and images the
[6:57] spirit of idolatry lives in the Roman
[7:00] Catholic Church communion of the Saints
[7:04] the Roman Catholic Church teaches that
[7:05] there can be an exchange of spiritual
[7:07] goods between the disciples currently on
[7:09] Earth and those that are in heaven or in
[7:12] glory these exchanges are done through
[7:14] prayers to saints that have already died
[7:17] nowhere in scripture can we find Jesus
[7:19] teaching us to pray two and four
[7:21] believers who have already died and left
[7:23] the Earth so we conclude that praying to
[7:26] anyone other than God is a form of
[7:28] spiritualism and should should not be
[7:29] taught for if the living saints of God
[7:32] are not being contacted then it would
[7:34] mean that the evil spirits were being
[7:36] contacted by those misguided prayers the
[7:39] CCC teaches it is a holy and a wholesome
[7:42] thought to pray for the dead that they
[7:44] may be loose from their sins our prayer
[7:47] for them is capable not only of helping
[7:49] them but also of making their
[7:50] intercession for us
[7:53] effective but in Luke 16: 25 and 26
[7:57] Jesus taught that there is no passing
[7:59] between the places of comfort and
[8:01] torment after death so it is a vain act
[8:04] to pray for anyone who already died for
[8:06] we cannot loose the dead from their
[8:10] sins the Bible never tells us to pray to
[8:13] anyone other than God for the Lord Jesus
[8:16] taught us to pray our father in Matthew
[8:20] 6:9 Psalms 5:3 says my voice shalt thou
[8:24] hear in the morning oh Lord in the
[8:26] morning will I direct my prayer unto
[8:27] thee and will look up Psalm 65:2 says oh
[8:32] thou that hearest prayer unto thee shall
[8:34] All Flesh
[8:36] come the CCC specifically teaches to
[8:39] pray to Mary by asking Mary to pray for
[8:42] us we acknowledge ourselves to be poor
[8:44] Sinners and we address ourselves to the
[8:46] Mother of Mercy Mother of God to whose
[8:49] protection that faithful fly in all
[8:52] their dangers and
[8:53] needs but the Bible teaches that Jesus
[8:56] alone is able to save us with his
[8:58] intercession
[9:00] Hebrews
[9:01] 7:25 wherefore he is able also to save
[9:04] them to the uttermost that come unto God
[9:06] by him seeing he ever liveth to make
[9:09] intercession for
[9:11] them the worship of the Virgin
[9:14] Mary the CCC truly deifies Mary the
[9:17] mother of Jesus which is another form of
[9:20] idolatry the CCC states that Mary is the
[9:24] all holy one and was preserved free from
[9:27] all stain of original sin
[9:30] only Jesus was without sin according to
[9:32] Hebrews
[9:33] 4:15 and Romans 3:23 says that all have
[9:36] sinned and fallen short of the glory of
[9:39] God in Revelation 5: 1-5 only Jesus was
[9:43] found worthy to open the book and to
[9:45] loose the Seven Seals no man or woman
[9:48] was found in heaven or Earth who was
[9:50] worthy not Mary only the Lord
[9:54] Jesus the CCC exalts Mary above God for
[9:58] she is given the titles Mother of God
[10:01] and queen over all things she is also
[10:04] said to have a saving office and by her
[10:07] manifold intercession continues to bring
[10:10] us the gifts of Eternal salvation she is
[10:12] to be invoked under the titles of
[10:15] advocate Helper benefactress and
[10:18] mediatrix God is the only savior there
[10:21] is no scripture for Mary saving anyone
[10:23] at any time or any place Isaiah
[10:27] 43:1 I even I I am the Lord and beside
[10:31] me there is no
[10:32] savior in Hebrews 7:3 mzc was God in the
[10:38] form of a man acting as a human priest
[10:40] to Abraham and was described as being
[10:43] without father without mother without
[10:46] descent having neither beginning of days
[10:48] nor end of
[10:50] life the revelation of this hour tells
[10:52] us that MDC was God in flesh so God has
[10:56] no mother yet the Roman Catholic Church
[10:58] exalts Mary to this false position as
[11:01] Mother of
[11:03] God triple
[11:05] blasphemy a powerful Revelation that
[11:08] came to us through the prophetic
[11:10] Ministry of God's Prophet William
[11:12] brandham was that of Revelation 13: 6
[11:16] the scripture says that the Beast which
[11:18] we will soon see is the spirit of Rome
[11:20] blasphemed God and His word in three
[11:22] different ways they blasphemed God's
[11:25] name his Tabernacle and them that dwell
[11:27] in heaven
[11:29] Rome has blasphemed God's name which is
[11:32] the Lord Jesus Christ and changed it to
[11:34] the Holy Trinity with the titles Father
[11:36] Son and Holy Ghost the Bible teaches
[11:39] that the name of Jesus Christ is the
[11:40] name above all names according to
[11:42] Philippians 2: 9-1 and that the entire
[11:46] family of God in heaven and in Earth is
[11:49] named the Lord Jesus Christ according to
[11:51] Ephesians 4:14
[11:54] and5 secondly Rome has blasphemed God's
[11:58] Heavenly Tabernacle
[11:59] by calling itself the Eternal City and
[12:02] decking the Vatican with Priceless
[12:04] artwork gold and precious
[12:08] valuables the New Jerusalem is the true
[12:10] Eternal City that is coming to Earth
[12:12] from heaven and God is the Builder and
[12:14] maker of that glorious City according to
[12:17] Revelation 21 and
[12:20] 22 lastly Rome has blasing the saints
[12:23] that dwell in Heaven by teaching its
[12:25] followers to pray to them rather than to
[12:27] God himself which is is called the
[12:29] communion of saints as we discussed
[12:31] earlier Jesus Christ is the only
[12:33] mediator between God and man and Jesus
[12:35] never taught anyone to pray to Mary or
[12:38] any other believer
