[0:39] attached to the vine Lord I'm a branch
[0:41] so Lord let me abide in the vine here
[0:43] tonight that you could use me to help
[0:45] your blessed people Lord the people that
[0:47] sing about uh Holy Spirit riging down
[0:50] Hallelujah and uh bringing in the Sheep

[1:01] the Holy Spirit forgive us of any sin

[1:05] bitterness Lord or any unconfessed sin I
[1:07] just pray your people would confess them
[1:09] now Lord God that you might be glorified
[1:11] and magnified God as I said You'
[1:13] recently shown me again how how personal
[1:15] you can be and how much you care about
[1:17] correcting your children Lord God you
[1:19] want us to walk in obedience you don't
[1:21] want us to walk in besetting sins right
[1:23] you want us to obey the word of God so
[1:25] bless us here tonight they've made all
[1:27] these sacrifices to come to your house
[1:29] so I pray you'll bless bless them with
[1:30] your word tonight in Jesus Christ's name
[1:32] and the Saints said amen amen God bless
[1:34] you as you're being seated there praise
[1:37] God so again I want to preach on these
[1:39] two thoughts you know they kind of go
[1:40] together uh the message uh I'm sorry the
[1:43] absolute and the message here tonight um
[1:46] do you want that or do you want it
[1:48] doesn't matter to me what's ever better
[1:50] for you all it was kind of dark up here
[1:53] I didn't get to see uh Howard's face
[1:55] real real nicely like I'd like to
[1:58] but now whatever whatever you whatever
[2:01] you all like by God's grace so uh we
[2:05] want to look at uh you know and what I'm
[2:07] going to try to do too I'm going to try
[2:08] to show some some quotes from Brother
[2:10] brandom some scriptures I'm also going
[2:12] to try to play portions of a video I did
[2:14] uh I made on the absolute because it's
[2:19] the truth brother brandom's absolute was
[2:22] Jesus Christ there's many things uh
[2:26] there's variations he said of that he
[2:27] said the absolute is the Bible the ab
[2:29] absolute is Jesus Christ the absolute is
[2:32] the holy spirit Hallelujah the absolute
[2:34] is the pillar of fire brother man made
[2:37] many different similar statements like
[2:39] that but they're all pointing to the one
[2:41] fact the only absolute is God the only
[2:45] absolute is
[2:46] Jesus no man other than Jesus is the
[2:51] absolute okay everybody got that by
[2:53] God's grace so it's very simple to you
[2:55] you know because you've been taught
[2:56] right but I just want to kind of I
[2:58] thought you know this might be the last
[2:59] time I preach you for a little while I
[3:01] don't know it's kind up to our brothers
[3:02] you know uh I said well if this is the
[3:04] last time let me lay this in here real
[3:06] good uh so it brother Brown said you got
[3:08] to pound it and clinch it in there like
[3:09] a nail right you don't you don't leave a
[3:11] nail sticking out halfway you got to put
[3:13] it all the way in there so I'm going to
[3:15] clinch the nail tonight by God's grace I
[3:17] kind of like to slap my RI my palm like
[3:19] that to give it some uh some
[3:22] illustration I want to just nail that in
[3:24] there because I see as a pastor and you
[3:27] know listening to different things and
[3:28] and different visiting ministers and so
[3:30] forth I see that people get deceived
[3:32] from the middle of the road brother R
[3:34] said we got to stay in the middle of the
[3:35] road amen so like when you're driving
[3:37] our sisters and brothers you got to stay
[3:38] in the middle of your lane you get out
[3:40] of your lane a little bit oh my you
[3:41] start scaring people right or you
[3:44] getting towards uh you know the ditch
[3:46] that scares you
[3:48] right and I see a lot of churches
[3:50] getting towards the middle of lane or
[3:52] towards the ditch we got to stay right
[3:53] in the middle of the road praise God
[3:56] it's going to be uh it's going to be a
[3:58] challenge right but but that that's we
[4:00] we got to have something to overcome
[4:01] Hallelujah we got to overcome by the
[4:03] grace of God hallelujah and so uh that's
[4:06] what we see uh as you know brother
[4:09] Brand's family has gone into the ditch
[4:11] because they say every word on tape is
[4:13] thus sayith the Lord they say the tapes
[4:16] are the absolute that's heresy
[4:20] amen because if the tapes are the
[4:24] absolute now you've added on to the
[4:26] Bible and brother R says you can't add
[4:29] one word to the Bible
[4:31] amen I know that's a strong statement
[4:33] but I know what brother random said
[4:35] right and I know what the Bible says
[4:37] amen that's exactly
[4:39] Hallelujah and I've written to brother
[4:41] Ram's Sons both sons of course Billy
[4:43] Paul passed last year I've written to
[4:45] both sons and told them that I wouldn't
[4:47] say it unless I told them
[4:49] first Hallelujah so I know what I'm
[4:52] talking about and I've heard back from
[4:53] both of them I've got letters from both
[4:55] of them I'm sorry I left them at home I
[4:56] could have showed you I I told them the
[4:58] truth but they don't want the truth now
[5:00] I still love them I still love my
[5:02] brothers I still love brother an's
[5:04] family but I'm letting you know they
[5:07] have changed the
[5:08] absolute they say the absolute is the
[5:10] tapes they say the absolute uh they say
[5:14] the tapes are the token they say uh
[5:16] going to a tape church is the token no
[5:18] it's not the token is the baptism of the
[5:21] Holy Ghost amen that's the only token
[5:23] there is right there's only one absolute
[5:26] there's only one message that's Jesus
[5:27] Christ Hallelujah
[5:30] amen so I I know where I'm standing
[5:32] praise God I know what uh the Bible says
[5:35] I know what brother raham says
[5:37] hallelujah and that's how you know uh
[5:39] where you stand because you stay with
[5:40] the word of God hallelujah has anybody
[5:43] brother IR or brother John or anybody
[5:45] has anybody ever preached on just the
[5:47] absolute
[5:49] here or how about what the message is
[5:51] anybody ever preached that here yet to
[5:53] you okay well this would be good then
[5:55] amen Glory Hallelujah and I don't mind
[5:57] preaching a second time if you need it
[5:58] I'll preach it a second time
[6:00] I'll say if I need a sermon a second
[6:02] time Lord give me the sermon Amen Let Me
[6:04] preach it a second time or let me hear
[6:05] another sermon a second time anybody go
[6:07] back listen to the Future home anybody
[6:09] listen to that okay one or two okay all
[6:12] right praise God yeah all right two amen
[6:15] hallelujah I thought about preaching
[6:16] that tonight but you know as I as I got
[6:17] closer to this uh this meeting here
[6:20] tonight I'm like I want to preach this
[6:21] before I go to the the work you know
[6:23] before I leave for the
[6:24] summer all right now I'm going to have
[6:27] brother John brother John Galatians 1 6-
[6:29] 12 uh Sister Sarah can you get
[6:33] Revelation 2218 to 19 and sister Ruth
[6:37] would you get Proverbs 35 and 6 so I got
[6:41] John Sarah Ruth like God's John
[6:44] Galatians 61-12 now while they're
[6:46] turning there remember I'm going to play
[6:48] these quotes you get to hear Brother R's
[6:49] voice hopefully if it plays here tonight
[6:52] I Marvel that you are so soon removed
[6:54] from him that called you unto the grace
[6:57] into the grace of Christ unto another
[7:00] gospel which is not another but there be
[7:02] some that trouble you and would pervert
[7:04] the gospel of Christ but though we or an
[7:08] angel from heaven preach any other
[7:10] gospel unto you than that which we have
[7:13] preached unto you let him be a cursed as
[7:17] we said before so say I now again if any
[7:20] man preach any other gospel unto you
[7:23] than that you have received let him be a
[7:25] cursed for do I now persuade men or God
[7:30] or do I seek to please men for if I yet
[7:33] pleased men I should not be the servant
[7:35] of Christ but I certify you Brethren
[7:38] that the gospel which was preached of me
[7:40] is not after man for I neither received
[7:43] it of man neither was I taught it but by
[7:45] the revelation of Jesus Christ amen and
[7:47] the church said amen Paul said if you
[7:51] change one thing that the Jesus Christ
[7:53] revealed to me you're
[7:55] cursed right and just as another example
[7:57] Brenham Tabernacle said we need
[7:59] preachers anymore we need people to
[8:01] press play that has changed the gospel
[8:05] that's a
[8:06] curse because Paul never said well at
[8:08] the end time we won't need preachers
[8:10] anymore the preachers can stop preaching
[8:12] and just press play Paul never said
[8:15] that so that's the that's the route of
[8:17] going the route of being cursed because
[8:19] you changed one thing about the gospel
[8:21] that Paul preached now you're cursed
[8:23] amen hallelujah amen remember Ephesians
[8:27] 4: 8-16 says the preachers the fivefold
[8:30] ministry will preach until we all come
[8:32] in the unity of the faith hallelujah how
[8:35] many know we still got to come into the
[8:36] unity of the faith right we still need
[8:38] unified you you you all need to be
[8:40] unified with us we need to be unified
[8:42] with you we all need to grow in faith
[8:44] until the Bride of Jesus Christ is
[8:46] Unified in faith Hallelujah so we can
[8:49] see that we're not all unified so that
[8:50] means God's still going to use preachers
[8:52] to unify us hallelujah amen all right
[8:56] sister uh Sarah you want to get Proverbs
[8:58] 2218 tonight I'm sorry did I say it
[9:00] wrong reel I'm sorry revelation 22 I'm
[9:02] sorry you're ready to turn you're ready
[9:04] sorry good job for I testify to every
[9:07] man that hear the words of this book If
[9:10] any man shall add these things God shall
[9:12] addto him the ples that are written in
[9:14] this book and if any man shall take away
[9:16] from the words of the book of this
[9:17] prophecy God shall take away his part
[9:20] out of the book of life and out of the
[9:22] holy city and from the things which are
[9:23] written in this book amen we just
[9:25] preached on the holy city two weeks ago
[9:27] right John warned you if you take if you
[9:31] take anything out of the Bible and don't
[9:33] preach it or don't believe it you your
[9:35] name will get taken out of the book of
[9:37] life and you will your your part in the
[9:40] city will be taken out or if you add
[9:43] anything to the Bible that the Bible
[9:45] doesn't say you get the plagues added to
[9:47] you and brother random has quotes on all
[9:48] these he has quotes on Galatians one
[9:51] that John read quotes on this he has
[9:53] quotes on all these brother Ram is
[9:54] constantly saying these things right
[9:57] brother Ram was to turn our hearts back
[9:58] to what the apostolic fathers Amen
[10:01] brother Ram was to point us back to the
[10:03] Bible Hallelujah he wasn't pointing to
[10:05] himself he was pointing to Jesus Christ
[10:08] hallelujah amen and Jesus Christ reveals
[10:10] himself by the Holy Spirit but he also
[10:11] reveals himself by the word of God
[10:13] hallelujah amen amen all right now uh
[10:17] sister Ruth you want to read Proverbs 35
[10:19] and 6 every word of God is pure he is a
[10:22] shield to them that put their trust in
[10:24] him add thou not unto his words L he
[10:28] reprove the
[10:30] amen hallelujah every word of God is
[10:33] pure so you don't add one word to the
[10:35] Bible you don't take one word away the
[10:38] Bible says God will call people Liars if
[10:40] they add to the Bible that's what he's
[10:42] going to do with a lot of trinitarians
[10:43] they're going to say well uh my my my uh
[10:46] School taught me you're three persons
[10:48] and God's going to say you lied the
[10:50] Bible doesn't say he's three persons or
[10:53] the women preachers will say well well
[10:55] my my church told me I could preach and
[10:57] God's going to say you're a liar
[10:59] the Bible doesn't say women can preach
[11:01] now those are just two simple examples
[11:04] right the Bible says God will call them
[11:06] Liars on the day of judgment because
[11:09] they've added to the word of God so it's
[11:11] so important that we just stay with the
[11:13] word of God Allelujah all right good now
[11:18] I want to go through a few quotes here
[11:19] before uh I want to say this here now
[11:22] this is my
[11:23] summary so let me just read this slowly
[11:26] the message is the absolute only
[11:30] if you mean the message is the Bible
[11:34] verses that God is currently
[11:36] fulfilling so if a preacher came in our
[11:38] church and said the message is the
[11:40] absolute I'd wait to say Amen until I
[11:43] knew what he was talking about with the
[11:45] message because if he starts saying oh
[11:47] every word on the tape is Right
[11:49] everything brother R ever said was right
[11:51] I wouldn't say Amen because now he's now
[11:53] he's deifying brother
[11:55] brandom now he's adding to the Bible
[11:58] right
[11:59] Hallelujah but if I know that preacher
[12:02] is talking about well the message is
[12:03] revelation
[12:05] 10:7 re the message is uh Malachi 45
[12:08] and6 AM amen the message is Luke 17:30
[12:12] and the message is the absolute I'll say
[12:14] Amen because the Bible's the absolute
[12:17] Hallelujah but as I said it's heresy to
[12:20] say the message books and the tapes are
[12:22] the absolute because now you've added to
[12:25] the
[12:26] Bible right now you might know this
[12:29] might not but I have over a hundred
[12:30] examples of human mistakes brother
[12:33] random said that are on the tapes like
[12:35] brother random said women have sperm
[12:38] brother Bram said that he just mixed up
[12:40] his words right so see that quote can't
[12:44] be the absolute because that's not
[12:46] true brother R he said I now brother man
[12:49] had some calculations and he said well I
[12:51] think by 1977 the whole world will be
[12:55] annihilated with only tree stumps left
[12:58] he said that that's just my prediction
[13:00] based upon some numbers and I have a
[13:01] whole video about that if you want to
[13:02] watch that brother was he was just
[13:04] trying to get people ready he he said
[13:06] the Lord didn't tell me this this is
[13:08] just my thought
[13:10] right well if that's the absolute then
[13:12] the absolute's wrong because here we are
[13:14] and there we have a lot of trees that
[13:15] are not
[13:18] stumps and any man that would say every
[13:21] word on tape is the is absolute is thus
[13:23] say the Lord he's
[13:24] insane any woman that would say every
[13:27] word on tape is absolute is dece deed
[13:30] they're insane but thank God you and I
[13:33] have the spirit of truth hallelujah
[13:35] they've got a lying Spirit on them they'
[13:36] got a deceived Spirit on them but we
[13:38] don't we have the Holy Ghost and the
[13:40] Holy Ghost is the spirit of Truth it
[13:42] will only let us believe the truth
[13:44] amen hallelujah praise God I'm happy to
[13:47] be a Christian today amen starting to
[13:50] get happy hallelujah amen I should say
[13:52] Joyful Joyful is the word I want you to
[13:55] see that it all depends this statement
[13:57] the message is absolute it all depends
[13:59] what you mean by the
[14:00] message true if you mean every word on
[14:03] the tape then that's not true but if you
[14:05] mean the scriptures brother random gave
[14:08] us I'll say Amen to that right now I'm
[14:12] going to skip ahead just with this
[14:13] thought but I want you to show you I
[14:15] have a video like this too teaching it I
[14:16] teach it brother Bram used over 30 bible
[14:20] verses to define the message brother Ram
[14:23] never said you know my message is every
[14:25] word on the tapes brother R never said
[14:26] that that's what brandom Tabernacles uh
[14:29] propagating today as a lie that's a
[14:32] lie the message is the scriptures that
[14:35] God gave to brother brandham to point us
[14:37] back to right and I I just made a list I
[14:42] made a list of all I think I took 10
[14:44] hours and I and I went through every
[14:46] time brother Bram said what the message
[14:48] was and these are 30 verses he used so
[14:51] Hebrews 138 Jesus Christ the same
[14:53] yesterday today that today and forever
[14:55] that's the
[14:57] message acts 238 how many been baptized
[15:00] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I
[15:01] did a lot of them right by God's grace
[15:03] that's the message hallelujah amen but
[15:06] said that's the message acts
[15:07] 238 Malachi 45 and6 Elijah will turn our
[15:11] hearts back to the fathers that's the
[15:13] message Hallelujah and church I have
[15:15] quotes on all these I got a video on it
[15:17] like like this here's Hebrews 138 I know
[15:20] it's small but this one example in 1962
[15:24] brother man said and if I ever see you
[15:26] again this side of the river I'll see
[15:28] you on the other side believing in the
[15:29] same word with the same message that
[15:32] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[15:34] and forever Hallelujah Lord Glory so I
[15:38] mean I could go through this whole thing
[15:39] I go through all 30 I have quotes from
[15:42] brother Brandon for all
[15:44] 30 every time he said these verses were
[15:48] th were the message I'll just go to the
[15:50] last one I'll do the first and the last
[15:52] Alpha and Omega all right does that
[15:53] sound good I didn't plan that but it
[15:54] just worked out by God's gra we find out
[15:57] that in Revelation 3 at the Leo age
[15:59] which we're now living in to my
[16:01] interpretation of the scripture that
[16:03] when the message has come forth of the
[16:05] leoan age as it did in each age and each
[16:07] age had a messenger that we come forth
[16:09] in this last day and we find out that
[16:12] that church was very
[16:14] rich so see look what he said the
[16:16] message has come forth of the leoan age
[16:19] so what's the message the message is the
[16:21] leoan church age message right it starts
[16:24] in Revelation 3:14 to the end of the
[16:26] chapter that's the message
[16:30] right and uh here's the quote where
[16:32] brother says it plainly I want to read
[16:34] this one too so you got
[16:37] it right
[16:39] here less than a month before brother
[16:41] Ram died this is December 4th 1965
[16:45] brother Ram died December 24th 1965 he
[16:48] died the day before Christmas so 20 days
[16:52] before he died he said this many of you
[16:54] strangers perhaps hear about men get up
[16:56] and make these remarks about a message
[16:58] of this hour and so forth what they're
[17:00] getting at what are these people getting
[17:02] at when they say message of the hour he
[17:04] said what they're getting at is God's
[17:06] promise of this hour that he promised
[17:09] what he would do now where did he
[17:10] promise those things in the Bible amen
[17:13] hallelujah it's not in the Book of
[17:15] Mormon it's not in the
[17:17] Quran it's not in denomination it's in
[17:20] the Bible
[17:21] Hallelujah he said and we see him
[17:24] scripturally vindicating that's the key
[17:27] God's message is is what he's
[17:29] scripturally
[17:31] vindicating just exactly what he said he
[17:34] would do in the same manner it's
[17:37] foretold it's just exactly perfectly
[17:39] each time because it's God saying it
[17:43] amen hallelujah the Lord I love this
[17:45] quote brother says this is what the
[17:48] message is it's the scriptures God is
[17:50] fulfilling right now amen and as I
[17:53] showed
[17:54] you I just I just did maybe I think I I
[17:57] calculated 10 10 or 12 hours I just went
[17:59] through all these quotes these are the
[18:01] 30 verses brother ad uses to tell us he
[18:04] says this is my message and he uses each
[18:06] one of those this is my message John
[18:10] 5:24 1 Corinthians 6:11 acts: 15 you
[18:13] know all these he said these are my me
[18:15] this is my
[18:16] message it's not every human thought
[18:18] brother brand ever said that's not the
[18:20] message the message is the scriptures
[18:23] God is fulfilling right now
[18:25] Hallelujah all right now
[18:30] I want to read a few that are just so
[18:31] plain that that you'll uh you you you'll
[18:34] just have to remember by God's grace I
[18:36] believe the holy spirit will help you
[18:37] remember it prise the Lord now God's men
[18:40] will major on the
[18:42] word right because the word has life the
[18:45] word is what we're judged by we don't
[18:46] add to the word we don't take away from
[18:48] the word the true men of God will major
[18:50] and focus on the word of God Amen and
[18:53] brother R says the scriptures are the
[18:55] only absolute prise the Lord only he
[18:58] says no
[19:01] other this is from absolute 1963 now if
[19:05] he is our absolute who's the he is he
[19:07] talking about himself no he's talking
[19:09] about
[19:10] God if he's are absolute there can be no
[19:14] other everybody say those words say no
[19:16] other ready no there's no other if God's
[19:19] the absolute there can't be God in the
[19:21] tapes are the
[19:23] absolute it's either God or the tape and
[19:25] brother ad tells us it's God Hallelujah
[19:28] the tape point us to God just like if
[19:30] you're living in just like Martin Luther
[19:32] Martin Luther has all these books he's
[19:34] written so many books they still haven't
[19:36] translated all of them from German to
[19:37] English he wrote so many letters boy he
[19:39] was a writer boy he was a mastermind he
[19:41] was under that man anointing amen
[19:43] hallelujah but we're under the eagle
[19:45] anointing
[19:46] Hallelujah but see you know Luther was
[19:50] the messenger of his day but not
[19:52] everything he said was thus sayith the
[19:54] Lord and it has to be the same because
[19:56] Jesus is the same yesterday today and
[19:58] forever ever
[19:59] Hallelujah you can't make you can't make
[20:01] Martin Luther the
[20:03] absolute just like you can't make
[20:05] anybody else that that person themselves
[20:08] now Paul's a little different in one way
[20:09] you have to understand his letters were
[20:11] the absolute but he himself in his own
[20:14] human ideas and and maybe his sins he
[20:16] said he sinned every day he had to Die
[20:18] daily that part wasn't the absolute but
[20:20] it was the scripture that's the
[20:23] absolute all right there's no other
[20:27] absolute that's what brother R said he
[20:29] said you can't say well my church is my
[20:31] absolute this church is not the absolute
[20:34] my church is not the absolute Jesus is
[20:37] the
[20:38] absolute
[20:39] hallelujah amen glory you said you can't
[20:43] say my Creed is my
[20:45] absolute if Christ is your absolute you
[20:48] believe Christ's word amen there's no
[20:50] other way to do it
[20:52] Hallelujah there's no other absolute
[20:55] other than Jesus Christ how many can say
[20:56] Amen to
[20:57] thatall there you now I'm just add some
[21:00] scriptures you know Paul told Timothy
[21:02] preach the word I know not sure why I
[21:04] put all these oh yeah here's the here's
[21:05] the one brother R will use yeah when you
[21:08] read that Romans 3:4 let God be true but
[21:10] every man a liar I think we're going to
[21:11] get to that quote in a little bit
[21:14] here um Jesus said the words that I have
[21:17] spoken will judge him see the word is
[21:19] the judge Paul said God shall judge the
[21:22] secrets of men by Jesus Christ according
[21:25] to my gospel that just proves all of us
[21:27] are judged by the word of God right here
[21:30] we're not going to be judged by tapes
[21:32] that's for brother Ram we're not going
[21:33] to be judged by Martin Luther's books
[21:35] everybody understand we're going to be
[21:36] judged by the word of
[21:38] God hallelujah now do I respect what's
[21:41] on the tapes of course I preached it for
[21:43] over 20 years I preach brother br's
[21:45] message but as I listen to brother's
[21:47] message he tells me the Bible's the
[21:49] absolute
[21:51] amen and in the sermon he cares the you
[21:53] care 1963 brother said be very careful
[21:56] what you're listening to I've always
[21:57] asked you to be very careful what you're
[21:59] listening to he said so much of my
[22:01] sermons are just The Human
[22:03] Side everybody get this with a prophet
[22:06] you have a human side that's fallible
[22:08] that will make mistakes but you have a
[22:10] prophet side that's Divine and brother
[22:13] said here's how you know when God wants
[22:15] to speak something he'll speak it it'll
[22:17] say thus sayeth the Lord oh my church
[22:20] there's no doubt amen there's no doubt
[22:23] what God what God Said on the tapes is
[22:25] from God what God Said from on the tapes
[22:28] that is from God says thus sayeth the
[22:30] Lord Hallelujah Lord that's how it's
[22:32] always been prophets have always how do
[22:34] you know prophet's right or wrong when
[22:36] they speak in the name of the Lord and
[22:38] it comes to pass Hallelujah the Lord
[22:40] that's how you know right all right so
[22:43] when you listen to brother Ram like he
[22:44] said brother R said prove all things
[22:47] brother ramam said test me by the word
[22:49] that's what brother Ram said right
[22:51] brother R said test me by the word take
[22:53] everything I say back to the Bible right
[22:56] Hallelujah I'm just hoping that there's
[22:58] no William brandom worshippers in here
[23:00] cuz if if you are you're sure going to
[23:01] get burned tonight by God's grace I'm
[23:03] going to preach it till you repent
[23:05] Hallelujah and if you don't repent
[23:06] hopefully you repent later by God's
[23:08] grace we will not worship anything we
[23:10] will not worship anyone but Jesus Christ
[23:13] amen think of how ridiculous the people
[23:15] at brandom Tabernacle are they say the
[23:17] message is the is the absolute and it's
[23:20] the token the tapes are the token I have
[23:22] the quotes I got the recordings I
[23:24] recorded them saying
[23:25] it if if the if the if the record Wars
[23:28] are the token then my phone is born
[23:30] again because I have every sermon from
[23:32] Brother brandom on my phone is my phone
[23:35] Born Again Church no is see you all
[23:38] laugh it's ridiculous what they say and
[23:41] if you had all the books of brother
[23:42] random just up on your shelf let's say
[23:44] it was all these there say there shelves
[23:46] here does your shelf have the the token
[23:49] is your shelf born again because it has
[23:51] the message of course
[23:53] not but see what is it it's the devil
[23:56] deceiving people it's the devil getting
[23:58] people off the middle of the road right
[24:01] and that's why I tried to uh correct
[24:03] them privately before I went public with
[24:05] it right that's what every man even Paul
[24:08] had to call out names sometimes men of
[24:10] God they don't want to but they got to
[24:12] call out names to try to get people to
[24:14] repent the Bible tells us mark them that
[24:16] cause
[24:18] divisions and avoid them that's what the
[24:21] Bible says hallelujah so we must do
[24:24] these things we must tell the people the
[24:26] truth because the spirit of God is
[24:28] leading you into all truth hallelujah
[24:30] praise the Lord that's right brother
[24:32] raham said God's Own absolute is his
[24:34] word so brother Ram is talking about God
[24:36] okay let's just let's just pretend uh
[24:38] that my body is like God's theophany in
[24:41] heaven right brother said God and let's
[24:43] say Jesus sitting on his throne right
[24:45] brother said God's absolute is his
[24:50] word not not the
[24:53] tapes God's absolute God's Own absolute
[24:56] is his word right
[24:58] Glory
[25:01] Hallelujah brother manam said God is the
[25:05] absolute he said let every absolute
[25:08] other otherwise than mine be a lie mine
[25:11] is the truth hallelujah and what is that
[25:14] that's Romans 3:4 right he's quoting
[25:16] Romans 3:4 is just bringing it in a way
[25:18] that we can relate to it right let God
[25:21] be true but every man a liar amen
[25:26] hallelujah mine is the the truth so
[25:29] there is the absolute to Christianity
[25:32] there's the end of all arguments and the
[25:34] church said Hallelujah this is the end
[25:36] of every argument now people will if
[25:38] they have evil spirits on them they'll
[25:40] keep arguing that the tapes are the
[25:42] absolute or the the books are the
[25:43] absolute they'll keep arguing but a real
[25:45] Christian won't argue a real Christian
[25:47] knows God's absolute is the word of God
[25:52] hallelujah you'd be surprised how many
[25:54] preachers will call me a heretic for
[25:55] saying what I'm saying but I'm the one
[25:57] saying what brother br saying brother
[26:00] never said that my tapes are the
[26:01] absolute brother never said that he said
[26:04] you brethren in 1963 it's December 23rd
[26:07] questions and answers brother BR said
[26:08] you Brethren kind of look to me as your
[26:11] absolute he said but it's you follow me
[26:13] as I follow Christ he's using that
[26:16] scripture right he said kind of but
[26:19] right before that brother R said my
[26:21] absolute is the word of
[26:22] God lord I wish I would have put that
[26:26] quote up there but brother man says he
[26:28] says my absolute is the word of God he
[26:30] said I know you Brothers kind of looked
[26:31] at me to be the absolute that's because
[26:33] when he was going to preach there in
[26:34] questions and answers it was on the
[26:36] operation of the gifts and how can a
[26:38] local church have tongues and
[26:40] interpretations and deacons how does how
[26:42] do they take care of all those gifts
[26:44] operating and so brother R said take my
[26:46] teaching on it because you're kind of
[26:48] looking to me as the leader as Paul said
[26:50] follow me as I follow Christ brother
[26:53] Brandon wasn't saying I'm the absolute
[26:55] right he said I'm he was saying he said
[26:58] if if he said any person that has two
[27:00] heads is a monster he
[27:02] says in other words you can't have uh
[27:04] you can't have two leaders you can't
[27:06] have two pastors you got one Pastor
[27:08] because God wants one person uh all the
[27:11] all the questions have to be answered by
[27:12] one person and you do the best you can
[27:14] by the grace of God you understand what
[27:16] I'm talking about a pastor is doing the
[27:18] best he can a pastor is not God a pastor
[27:20] is not the absolute but there has to be
[27:22] someone where everything comes to
[27:24] someone has to answer all the questions
[27:25] right I get a lot of questions at my
[27:26] church right
[27:28] and and the pastor had the all the
[27:30] questions have to be answered by
[27:32] somebody and so God said a pastor a
[27:34] Shepherd over the head of the sheep does
[27:36] everybody
[27:37] understand Hallelujah but you have that
[27:41] quote God is his own
[27:44] absolute that that's why the Bible said
[27:47] when God made a promise to Abraham he
[27:48] couldn't swear by anybody else he had to
[27:51] swear by himself because he's he's
[27:53] infinite he's Eternal no one's greater
[27:55] than God hallelujah he can only swear by
[27:58] himself because he's the absolute
[28:00] Hallelujah right all
[28:05] right and here's where he says it yeah
[28:07] this is the full context I'm sorry ah
[28:09] yeah I'm
[28:10] sorry I wanted to make the uh the
[28:12] writing a little smaller he says that's
[28:14] the way it is in the Christian Life
[28:16] there's a stopping place and there's a
[28:17] going Place God's word is that absolute
[28:20] that's Christ so look God's word and
[28:23] Christ are the
[28:24] absolute if the tra if the traffic
[28:27] signals are not on on then we got a
[28:29] traffic jam well I've been to Guyana
[28:31] South America they don't have traffic
[28:33] likes there I felt like I was going to
[28:34] die every time I stepped into a car
[28:36] these people speed and they'll slam on
[28:37] their brakes at the last moment they're
[28:39] racing to get ahead there's all kinds of
[28:41] car accidents all the time they just
[28:42] move right on all their cars got bumped
[28:44] their buses got bumps and and dents all
[28:47] over them because there's no there's no
[28:49] absolute there's no traffic
[28:52] lights and I think that's what we got up
[28:54] here in the religious Pentagon today a
[28:57] traffic jam of make Believers and
[28:59] unbelievers and everything jammed
[29:01] together you just got a traffic jam why
[29:04] they don't have no absolute one say well
[29:06] we're this we're the absolute the other
[29:08] one said we're the absolute God is the
[29:11] absolute let every other absolute other
[29:13] than mine be a lie mine is the truth so
[29:16] there's the absolute to Christianity
[29:18] that's the end of all arguments the
[29:19] Bible said so that makes it right
[29:22] amen
[29:25] hallelujah now I love this one too this
[29:27] is beautiful now I believe that God can
[29:29] do things that's not written in this
[29:31] Bible I believe he can because he's God
[29:33] but just long as he does what he promise
[29:36] here is good enough for me I don't
[29:39] believe that anything should be added to
[29:41] this book or taken from it and the
[29:43] church
[29:44] said that's what sister Sarah read right
[29:47] Revelation 2218 to
[29:50] 19 I believe it's the complete
[29:52] revelation of Jesus Christ I believe
[29:55] that's what it is amen and all Doctrine
[29:57] Doctrine just means teaching so a lot of
[29:59] these preachers they say oh there's too
[30:01] much Doctrine you can't have too I mean
[30:04] you can't have too much true
[30:06] Doctrine Doctrine means instruction so
[30:09] when a preacher is preaching like maybe
[30:10] Simon Simon was instructing you on the
[30:12] statute of perfect man right and how how
[30:14] th those those those enemies uh for
[30:17] Joshua were a type for you because
[30:19] you're going to fight enemies once you
[30:20] get in the land right that's teaching
[30:22] you that's instructing you how to fight
[30:25] battles church amen if somebody comes
[30:27] and preaches here's how you pray or
[30:29] here's how you fast or here's how you uh
[30:32] here's how you operate the gifts of the
[30:33] holy spirit anytime or here's how you
[30:36] receive a miracle if anybody teaches you
[30:38] how to do something they just gave you
[30:40] Doctrine
[30:41] Hallelujah is that right and Paul said
[30:44] in second Timothy 1 he said teach no
[30:47] other Doctrine than the doctrine that
[30:49] Jesus revealed to
[30:50] him other words the bible teach no other
[30:54] doctrines than what the Bible says is
[30:56] everybody catching this tonight
[31:00] now look at this look how humble brother
[31:01] R says and if you catch me saying things
[31:04] and doing things that's not scripturally
[31:06] and promise scripture for this hour than
[31:08] the thing to do you owe it to me to see
[31:10] the manager and see that I'm
[31:12] straightened up for it see brother
[31:14] random said brother R was so humble he
[31:17] said if I'm wrong I Want to Be Right
[31:19] somebody come correct me by the Bible
[31:22] right that's how your attitude should be
[31:24] too amen right brother Irvin if I'm
[31:26] wrong brother Irvin then you come show
[31:28] me in the Bible I'll say praise the Lord
[31:29] I'm
[31:30] sorry Hallelujah that's what brother Ram
[31:34] said if you catch me saying and doing
[31:36] things that aren't in the Bible come
[31:37] show me because I want to be right
[31:40] that's because that's my absolute amen
[31:42] hallelujah amen
[31:44] glory because look because I'm a hard to
[31:47] see because I'm a human being too I want
[31:50] to go to heaven the same as the rest of
[31:52] you
[31:54] does brother brandom knew if we take
[31:56] away from the Bible our name could be
[31:58] taken out of the book of life that's why
[32:00] he's saying
[32:02] that
[32:06] glory and church just so you know maybe
[32:09] you don't know but let me tell you a lot
[32:11] of churches that claim to be message are
[32:13] not message because Satan has come in
[32:16] and he's taken something maybe on the
[32:17] tape that was just brother Ram's idea or
[32:19] something and they've made it into this
[32:20] big major Doctrine and it's a false
[32:23] Doctrine right that's Satan's job Satan
[32:27] attack the message harder than all the
[32:29] other churches cuz this is the word for
[32:31] our day right right I have a quote from
[32:34] Martin Luther I put it in my book yeah
[32:36] you got the book there Martin Luther
[32:38] said I hope 10% of the people that were
[32:41] baptized he said are still in the
[32:44] Lutheran Church in other words Martin
[32:46] Luther said I've seen 90% of the the
[32:48] message people fall away during my
[32:50] lifetime 90%
[32:53] brother and didn't Jesus say few there
[32:56] be that find the narrow road didn't he
[32:57] say that
[32:58] Matthew 7:14 so when we see people
[33:00] falling away from the message today it
[33:02] don't surprise me it's always been that
[33:06] way Jesus had what uh 82
[33:09] preachers 70 left him brother Daniel the
[33:13] most of his preachers left him and then
[33:15] Judas left
[33:16] amen most of them left that's how it
[33:19] always is thank God that you stayed true
[33:21] to God thank God that you got the right
[33:23] absolute the absolute is Jesus Christ
[33:25] the word of God hallelujah
[33:30] and then Jesus turned and looked at the
[33:31] 12 and said you want to go
[33:33] to you wern't scared to be in little
[33:35] church and the church said amen don't be
[33:38] scared of being a little church I've had
[33:39] a little little church for 18 years now
[33:41] I'd rather be a little church than a big
[33:43] church with a bunch of false
[33:45] doctrines adding to the Bible taking
[33:47] away from the Bible worshiping brother
[33:49] Bram that's sin that's
[33:51] heresy brother raham came to point us to
[33:53] the word of God right the Bible says you
[33:56] give double honor to the preacher that
[33:58] labor in the word of God brother Ram
[33:59] deserves our double honor the Bible said
[34:02] honor all men right so you give respect
[34:04] to everybody but you give double respect
[34:06] to preachers who labor in the word of
[34:08] God and study the word and preach the
[34:10] truth give them double honor the Bible
[34:13] says brother R said his his ministry the
[34:16] seven Church age messenger he said
[34:17] deserves no other honor than the honor
[34:19] that John the Baptist
[34:22] got Hallelujah see brother is not to be
[34:25] worshiped brother R is not to be an idol
[34:27] brother is not to be prayed to he said
[34:29] never baptize in my name now you all
[34:31] know that but you'd be surprised there's
[34:33] a lot of there's a lot of people around
[34:34] the world that believe nonsense like
[34:36] that because they're not born again if
[34:39] you get born again you get the holy
[34:41] spirit in your soul and brother said
[34:43] that holy spirit's a fire but it's also
[34:45] he said it's a buzzer so when you hear
[34:47] something wrong it goes up don't believe
[34:50] that it's a false preacher he's telling
[34:53] lies and said it's there to protect your
[34:56] life Hallelujah amen
[34:59] amen the Holy Ghost is a buzzer and when
[35:02] you hear a false Doctrine it goes off to
[35:05] protect your life so you don't fall into
[35:08] some false Doctrine like a polygamy
[35:11] Doctrine men can marry as many women as
[35:13] they want that's a lie from Hell
[35:15] Hallelujah the Bible said you stay one
[35:18] until death do you part
[35:19] Hallelujah they just misunderstand
[35:21] brother Ram they they don't even look at
[35:23] brother Ram's own life he only married
[35:24] one woman right after his first wife
[35:27] died he married one right they don't
[35:29] even they don't even look at him look at
[35:31] his example he Liv the example before us
[35:33] hallelujah thank God for a Godly example
[35:36] amen
[35:38] hallelujah so I'll say like that for all
[35:40] of you if you catch me saying things
[35:42] that aren't in the Bible you come
[35:43] straighten me out after service right
[35:45] but you be better be ready to be
[35:47] corrected if you're
[35:49] wrong cuz think about that if I'm wrong
[35:52] you're pulling a sword you're bringing a
[35:53] sword to me to try to correct me but if
[35:55] you're wrong I'm pulling out my sword
[35:57] too
[35:58] we're going to see who
[36:00] wins that's what the word of God is the
[36:02] word of God is the sword right I don't
[36:04] mind being corrected but you better make
[36:05] sure you're right
[36:07] right especially on topics like this
[36:10] because I got quotes and I got the Bible
[36:12] I got brother R quoting the Bible
[36:14] amen saying there's no other absolute he
[36:17] said the Bible God Jesus Christ the Holy
[36:20] Ghost is the absolute Hallelujah in
[36:22] other words God in every
[36:24] form God in every form is the absolute
[36:27] hallelujah amen this is God in paper
[36:29] form and the church
[36:32] said brother said the pillar of fire is
[36:34] the absolute that means god in the logos
[36:36] form or God in the theophany form is the
[36:38] absolute
[36:40] Hallelujah he said Jesus sitting on the
[36:42] throne of God is the absolute amen
[36:45] hallelujah God in every form is the
[36:47] absolute praise God hallelujah now I'm
[36:50] getting excited again here brother now
[36:53] here's here's that church order quote
[36:55] yes brother Bram said I expect you
[36:58] Brethren at any time you see me get away
[37:00] from this scripture No not not the tapes
[37:04] not my books if you get me away from the
[37:06] scripture to come to me privately and
[37:09] tell me where I'm
[37:11] wrong I don't care if you're one of the
[37:13] trustees or if you're the
[37:16] janitor so trustees would be a highly
[37:19] esteemed person in the church wow you're
[37:20] a trustee you're in charge of the
[37:21] grounds and you do all the legal
[37:23] documents well you're just the janitor
[37:26] you just you just clean the
[37:28] toilets brother said I don't care if
[37:30] you're the highest man or the lowest man
[37:32] come correct me if I'm off the word of
[37:35] God whoever you are you're Duty bound to
[37:39] me as a brother in Christ to tell me
[37:40] when I'm wrong
[37:42] scripturally if there's a question let's
[37:45] sit down and solve it out
[37:49] together
[37:52] Hallelujah because the Bible says if you
[37:54] bring uh against an elder receive an
[37:58] accusation but before two or three
[38:00] Witnesses now Elder can mean two things
[38:03] it can mean just a a man who has a lot
[38:06] more years of experience or brother said
[38:08] it also can mean a pastor because he's
[38:10] brother calls him the local Elder he's
[38:12] the head of the
[38:13] church okay so Elder can mean two things
[38:16] he says that in the church age book as
[38:17] well Elder can mean two
[38:19] things so brother R is even opening
[38:22] himself up to be corrected by one person
[38:25] if it's just a janitor or if it's
[38:27] trustee come to me privately and try to
[38:31] correct me let's sit down and try to
[38:33] solve it out together I have a whole
[38:35] video on how brother random was open to
[38:38] correction brother random would he'd
[38:40] receive correction from anybody as long
[38:42] as it was
[38:44] scriptural I got a whole video on it boy
[38:46] a lot of people didn't like that video
[38:48] I'm like how can you not like the video
[38:49] there's quotes from Brother brandom on
[38:50] the
[38:51] video oh you say you believe every quote
[38:53] from Brother brand but you don't like
[38:54] the quotes I use on this video oh it's
[38:56] cuz you don't really believe the
[38:58] message you don't you don't believe the
[39:01] Bible amen if you believe the Bible
[39:04] you'd agree with what I said because I
[39:06] use the Bible to explain it
[39:09] Hallelujah now I'm going to skip past
[39:11] that I'll go back to that here let's see
[39:14] yes in 1964 brother Bram said a man came
[39:17] up him to try to tempt him so this man
[39:19] was anointed with the devil and a man
[39:21] come up and Tred to tell brother brandom
[39:23] you prophesied you've had dreams and
[39:24] Visions surely you can write another
[39:27] book to the Bible that's what the devil
[39:29] did to Joseph
[39:31] Smith and Joseph Smith took a hookline
[39:33] and sinker because he's a false prophet
[39:36] right a man came up I'm going to read
[39:38] this quote it's a longer quote but I
[39:39] want you to hear it it's very important
[39:42] a man come up and said you ought to be
[39:43] able to write down what the seven
[39:44] Thunders uttered and it's going to be
[39:46] something outside the Bible he he he he
[39:49] he he puts it on him real thick there
[39:51] put it on real thing to try to get him
[39:52] to add to the word of God but brother
[39:54] Rand was a
[39:56] prophet and you're not going to you're
[39:58] not going to trick a genuine Prophet
[39:59] into adding on to the Bible Glory
[40:02] Hallelujah
[40:03] Amen brother said you cannot add one
[40:06] word to the
[40:08] Bible and we all know the tapes have
[40:10] comments and just words from we have
[40:12] they have words in them that aren't in
[40:13] the
[40:14] Bible so you can't make the tapes equal
[40:18] I've heard people hold up uh the Bible
[40:20] and brother's books and say if I had a
[40:23] choice between these two I'd take the
[40:25] books shame on you
[40:28] amen shame on you there's not two
[40:30] absolutes there's only one
[40:33] absolute and they say well I couldn't
[40:36] understand this Bible if I didn't have
[40:37] these tapes what a lie from the
[40:41] devil there's people in Iran right now
[40:44] in Iraq that never got a tape of brother
[40:46] randam but Jesus Christ is appearing to
[40:48] them and telling them the truth of the
[40:50] word of God hallelujah amen see how
[40:53] slick that devil is I couldn't
[40:56] understand this Bible without the I mean
[40:58] that's true to some
[40:59] degree but this book also has human
[41:02] thoughts in it like I told
[41:04] you right so see it's a lie said there's
[41:09] only one there's no other absolute God's
[41:11] word is the absolute
[41:15] Hallelujah all right now let's read this
[41:17] here so you can see it everyone has
[41:19] always come to me and said can you
[41:20] imagine brother BR them seven Thunders
[41:23] that the voice thundered and he said
[41:25] write it not but close it up and said
[41:26] there'll be seven Thunders that'll be
[41:28] revealed in the last days see seven
[41:30] Thunders that'll tell us now don't that
[41:31] sound real good see but watch what
[41:34] you're talking about when you say that
[41:37] he said see that you write it not John
[41:39] said that see these seven Thunders utter
[41:42] their voices see and he said don't write
[41:43] that see but it's to be sealed up in the
[41:45] book until the last
[41:47] days now someone has been many has been
[41:50] saying to me and theologians said
[41:53] brother brandham said if the Lord God
[41:55] with your experience that the Lord has
[41:58] given you for his people humb humbly
[42:00] saying this you would be eligible to
[42:02] write a Bible yourself your word if God
[42:05] has man
[42:06] manifested right brother Rand had
[42:08] remember the seven major Visions dream
[42:10] brother brand had or visions rather not
[42:12] dream brother had all these Visions from
[42:15] God and they were true and so the Devil
[42:17] comes up and said you might as well put
[42:19] those in a book because aren't they from
[42:21] God what a slick
[42:24] devil but let's leave let's see what
[42:26] brother random answered
[42:27] brother didn't say oh yeah let's let's
[42:29] add on to the Bible brother never said
[42:32] that he I said that might be true in
[42:34] other words those experiences were from
[42:36] God God manifested himself in my life
[42:39] see he was trying to catch
[42:42] me see the devil anointed another man to
[42:46] try to tempt brother Brenham to add on
[42:48] to the Bible
[42:50] Hallelujah but I said you see I couldn't
[42:54] do that why couldn't you you have all
[42:57] the qualifications to add onto the
[42:59] Bible I said but look one word cannot be
[43:03] added or taken away see and he said well
[43:06] then what about them seven Thunders and
[43:07] wouldn't them seven Thunders blasting
[43:09] out wouldn't that be a revelation be
[43:11] given to some man I said no sir it would
[43:14] be adding something to it or taking
[43:16] something from it brother said it's all
[43:18] revealed in there and the Seven Seals
[43:21] opened up the revelation of what that
[43:24] was the Thunders the Seven Seals opened
[43:26] up the revelation of the seven Thunders
[43:29] that's what it was see it's still in the
[43:32] word everybody say still in the word
[43:33] ready still in the word amen you see you
[43:37] can't get out of that word it won't
[43:39] leave the word God's spirit will never
[43:42] leave that word
[43:44] Hallelujah Lord it'll stay right with
[43:46] that word blinding some and Open the
[43:49] Eyes of others it'll always do that
[43:53] hallelujah amen I know where I'm
[43:55] standing today church amen I know where
[43:57] I'm standing I'm standing on the word of
[43:59] God the absolute praise God Lord
[44:05] amen see they tempted brother Brandon
[44:08] you just try to you just try to add
[44:10] something you just add your own
[44:11] experiences add it on to the Bible
[44:13] brother said I'd be cursed if I did
[44:16] that everybody understand that by God's
[44:18] grace right amen all right
[44:21] now brother said the Keystone or the
[44:24] foundation stone or the Cornerstone of
[44:26] the Bible is that God cannot change his
[44:29] word in other words this church you're a
[44:33] young church but your Cornerstone has to
[44:35] be these verses brother is going to tell
[44:37] us the Cornerstone of your church is
[44:40] that God cannot change right God won't
[44:43] change his word and say well now we
[44:45] don't need preachers just press play God
[44:47] won't
[44:49] change listen to taking sze with Jesus
[44:52] in 1962 brother R said I want to I want
[44:54] to train up ministers so when I go
[44:56] overseas and I leave I can send these
[44:59] brothers to go preach and they can start
[45:01] churches he didn't say when I leave I
[45:03] can send tape
[45:05] players he said I'm going to send
[45:07] preachers because God has always
[45:09] ordained preachers hallelujah it's
[45:11] always been that way amen God's not
[45:14] going to change his program and the
[45:15] church
[45:17] said God will not change his
[45:19] program that's the whole Cornerstone of
[45:23] the church right that God's word does
[45:26] not change oh it makes me happy brother
[45:28] irin amen makes me happy because for 20
[45:31] years I've stood I've preached for 20
[45:33] years and no man can deceive me because
[45:36] God showed me his foundation stone
[45:38] Hallelujah no man can knock over my
[45:40] building because I'm founded on the rock
[45:42] hallelujah I'm founded on the Bible
[45:45] everything we believe comes from the
[45:46] Bible and the Bible doesn't change Amen
[45:50] brother Daniel I just got to say God
[45:51] when I get questions about certain
[45:53] teachings and doctrines brother Daniel I
[45:55] just got to say God stir up my Mind by
[45:57] way of remembrance help me to remember
[46:00] the truth help me to remember the
[46:01] Keystone help me to go back to the
[46:03] foundation stone amen Lord because the
[46:07] devil will bring quotes from brother
[46:08] brandom and try to twist it and make it
[46:11] say something it don't say like this
[46:12] week somebody tried to uh bring a a a
[46:15] devil lie to me and said uh they said
[46:17] there's no more Redemption for the the
[46:19] there's no more Redemption for the world
[46:21] Jesus is done being the
[46:24] Redeemer I said sir you are dece Ed by
[46:27] an evil spirit and they took some quote
[46:30] out of the first seal where B said when
[46:32] Jesus Takes the book there's no more
[46:34] Redemption and they just cut it off
[46:36] right
[46:37] there I said you forgot to keep
[46:39] reading right
[46:43] hallelujah hallelujah and I I I showed
[46:46] him all these quotes uh uh a year later
[46:50] in questions and answer 64 they asked
[46:52] brother Ram is Mercy over and brother R
[46:54] said don't ever think that
[46:57] he said you keep flowing into Mercy he
[47:00] said uh with all that you've got he said
[47:03] he said God is still saving he said he
[47:05] said he said Mercy will be over when
[47:07] Jesus raptures the bride off the Earth
[47:11] Hallelujah so Mercy last until we leave
[47:14] so if I'm here there's still Mercy if
[47:16] you're here there's still Mercy when we
[47:19] leave that's when Mercy's over because
[47:21] God cuts off the Gentile branch and he
[47:24] puts back in the Jewish Branch how many
[47:25] Bible readers we got in here tonight
[47:27] that's in Romans
[47:29] 11 God cut off the Israel Branch when
[47:32] Jesus died right because they rejected
[47:34] Christ he grafted in the Gentile branch
[47:37] and then he says when the time of
[47:39] Gentiles is fulfilled I'm cutting the
[47:41] Gentile Branch off and I'm putting the
[47:43] Jews back in ah Lord then brother quotes
[47:47] uh Revelation 22:17 he that's righteous
[47:50] let him be righteous still he that's
[47:52] holy let him be holy still he that's
[47:53] filthy let him be filthy still he that's
[47:56] Unholy let him be Unholy still so Church
[47:58] let's be holy still hallelujah amen
[48:02] let's be holy now
[48:04] amen glory to
[48:06] God see they'll use a quote but they'll
[48:09] bring some devilish lie to come in and
[48:11] say oh there's no more Redemption and
[48:12] Jesus Is On The Mercy Seat I got news
[48:15] for it Jesus does a lot in
[48:18] heaven not only does he
[48:21] intercede that's what the Bible there's
[48:22] at least four things he does in heaven
[48:25] he intercedes I put them on the video
[48:27] this week I have to remember some of
[48:28] them here he intercedes uh the other one
[48:31] he do brother Ram said he oh yeah John
[48:33] 14 says I go to prepare a place for you
[48:35] I go to prepare a mansion for you prise
[48:38] the Lord Daniel you you prepared a
[48:40] really nice house for your wife Miriam
[48:42] and your family but Jesus is going to
[48:44] prepare an even better one for you buddy
[48:46] am so Jesus has to intercede then he has
[48:49] to hear all your prayers but Daniel now
[48:51] it is have to hear your prayers he's got
[48:53] to build your
[48:55] Mansion not only does have to do that he
[48:57] has to have all the all the demons and
[48:59] angels present themselves before him on
[49:01] a certain day in heaven remember that
[49:03] from Job chapter 1 the Bible said
[49:05] there's a Day in heaven when all the
[49:07] Angels got to present themselves even
[49:08] the devils and tell them where what
[49:10] they're doing now God knows but God
[49:12] reminds them I'm the God of this world
[49:14] I'm the God of this I'm sorry I'm the
[49:15] God of this universe amen I'm the God of
[49:17] this
[49:19] universe and then if you read your Bible
[49:22] Micaiah if you read about Micaiah
[49:24] Micaiah said I saw uh I saw heaven open
[49:27] and God was having a counsel in heaven
[49:29] with all the spirits he said who go down
[49:31] and deceive uh Ahab for me and remember
[49:34] one devil come up and said this one
[49:36] devil come up and said that and then the
[49:37] lying spirit said I'll go deceive him
[49:39] I'll be a lying spirit in all the mouth
[49:40] of His prophets and God said go do what
[49:42] you've got to do I've got to fulfill my
[49:44] word that I sent by Elijah oh God's
[49:47] going to fulfill what he said by Brother
[49:49] Ram that had thus sayth the Lord
[49:51] Hallelujah Lord God's going to fulfill
[49:53] the word of Elijah hallelujah amen so I
[49:56] just gave you four things Jesus does in
[49:58] heaven and brother said he can do that
[50:00] because heaven goes faster than this
[50:03] Dimension Heaven goes way faster than
[50:06] this
[50:06] Dimension everything's slow down here
[50:10] right slow to fix things slow to get
[50:11] things done when am I ever get my
[50:13] honeydew list done you know Welly I'll
[50:15] be struggling on that one for a long
[50:16] time but Jesus can go from interceding
[50:20] then he can go from Council and then he
[50:21] can go to to uh to build building uh the
[50:25] future home and then he can go to to
[50:27] meeting with having the demons check in
[50:29] that's what the Bible says how many
[50:31] believe the Bible praise
[50:33] God he has time to do that and the Bible
[50:37] said he ever lives he lives to make
[50:39] intercession for us hallelujah that's
[50:41] why he reigned that's why he conquered
[50:43] death so that he could be he could be
[50:45] touched by the feeling of your
[50:46] infirmities
[50:48] hallelujah
[50:51] amen he can do it all because he can't
[50:53] be limited is anything too hard for God
[50:55] and the church said
[50:57] is it too hard for God to be to Jesus be
[50:59] intercessor build a future home have
[51:01] Heavenly Council meetings is that too
[51:03] hard for God no there's nothing too hard
[51:05] for God but these people that got evil
[51:08] spirits they take one quote and they
[51:10] reject all the Bible you know what he he
[51:12] text it back brother Irvin he just said
[51:14] well you're you're deceived and all
[51:16] these things he didn't even give me a
[51:17] Bible verse that's called being a baby
[51:20] that's called being a
[51:22] child if he was a real man he tried to
[51:24] give me some scriptures to show where
[51:25] I'm wrong but see he had no scriptures
[51:27] that shows he doesn't have the truth
[51:29] hallelujah they'll name call me say oh
[51:32] you're intellectual uh you're a devil
[51:34] you're Satan all these things like that
[51:36] I'm a believer I'm a holy ghost filed
[51:38] Saint I'm a sinner saved by grace
[51:40] Hallelujah and my absolute is the Bible
[51:43] not some man who's trying to just oh
[51:45] yeah he's saying he said yeah I preached
[51:46] that back in 2003 and now you need to
[51:48] get all my tapes and you need to get my
[51:50] teaching on all this and stuff like that
[51:51] I don't want your teaching I want God's
[51:53] teaching
[51:54] Hallelujah I'm not mad I'm just
[51:57] I'm just being serious and Stern because
[51:59] it's a serious thing right one false
[52:03] Doctrine is called a doctrine of
[52:07] devils false Doctrine is called leav and
[52:11] leav puffs up the dough right right one
[52:14] false Doctrine then spreads if it's not
[52:16] corrected it'll spread to other
[52:18] doctrines and then pretty soon the
[52:19] church is full of false doctrines that's
[52:21] what happened at Brand
[52:22] Tabernacle recently I'm not talking
[52:24] about when brother R was here I'm
[52:25] talking about after brother
[52:28] left one false Doctrine if it's not
[52:31] corrected that leav will keep growing
[52:33] it'll impact the whole church doctrine
[52:35] that's what happened to the Roman
[52:36] Catholic Church they got the trinity in
[52:38] there look at them now they hardly even
[52:39] could recognize the Bible right
[52:42] everybody see that I've been keeping
[52:44] track of how long I've been preaching
[52:46] okay uh almost an hour all right okay
[52:48] been a good Audience by God's grace good
[52:50] audience now let's go let's go through
[52:52] these quotes here just briefly this is
[52:53] from the church age book the Keystone
[52:56] the Bible is
[52:58] God cannot change his word God cannot
[53:00] change his word that's the key Keystone
[53:02] of the whole
[53:03] Bible brother said the key given me of
[53:07] the Lord whereby I was able to determine
[53:09] the messenger for each age is a most
[53:11] scriptural one in fact it might be
[53:13] called the Keystone of the Bible it's
[53:15] the Revelation that God never changes
[53:18] and that his ways are as unchangeable as
[53:22] he isise the Lord and then he gives us
[53:25] some verses how many happy about that
[53:29] Hallelujah Jesus Christ the same
[53:31] yesterday and today and
[53:35] forever right oh yeah then somebody said
[53:37] uh oh brother Ram can be our pastor even
[53:40] though he's dead I said that's a
[53:42] lie brother Ram said in the future home
[53:45] I won't always be your
[53:48] pastor and then I took him back to uh
[53:50] numbers 27 in numbers 27 God told Moses
[53:54] Moses you've glorified yourself you're
[53:56] going to the way of all the Earth he
[53:58] said go get Joshua and anoint him before
[54:00] the people he's going to lead the people
[54:02] in and lead the people out because I
[54:04] don't want my sheep without a Shepherd
[54:06] Hallelujah the Lord Glory what am I
[54:09] saying Jesus Christ is the same
[54:10] yesterday today and forever when Moses
[54:12] went off the scene a prophet God raised
[54:14] up another
[54:15] man he didn't say Moses is still your
[54:18] still your uh Pastor now that he's dead
[54:20] he said Moses my servant is dead Joshua
[54:23] only be strong and very courageous
[54:25] Hallelujah amen glory everybody with
[54:29] me a dead man has never been a pastor to
[54:33] any true child of God hallelujah never
[54:37] when Moses died God raised up with
[54:38] Joshua Hallelujah when Paul died God
[54:41] raised up with Timothy brother irin
[54:43] hallelujah hallelujah when brother R
[54:46] died God raised up an Orman Neville
[54:48] Hallelujah brother Neville is a good man
[54:50] of God hallelujah he's a real man of
[54:53] God that's right now Ecclesiastes 3:14
[54:57] and 15 I know that whatsoever God doeth
[55:01] it shall be forever nothing can be put
[55:04] to it nor anything taken away from it
[55:07] and God doeth it that men should fear
[55:09] before him okay so those are the two
[55:11] verses brother and remember in the mouth
[55:13] of two or three Witnesses
[55:15] let every word be established brother
[55:18] gives us two verses to show that God is
[55:21] unchangeable and his ways are
[55:22] unchangeable that's how he chose the
[55:25] seven Church a messeng MERS he said
[55:27] which man was most like St Paul he's got
[55:30] to be really close to St Paul because
[55:32] God doesn't change his
[55:34] ways so Paul ireneus Martin Columba
[55:38] Luther Wesley brother brandham those are
[55:41] the men that were most like Paul because
[55:44] God doesn't change his ways
[55:48] hallelujah how many believe that by
[55:50] God's
[55:51] grace with all my
[55:54] heart Glory
[55:58] yeah I'm sorry there's still there's
[55:59] still more to this verse sorry that
[56:00] which hath been is now and that which is
[56:03] to be hath already been and God required
[56:05] that which is passed see all this LGB
[56:09] nonsense it already was it was in Sodom
[56:11] and Gomorrah except in s gomorah they
[56:13] had men gangs busting into the
[56:16] houses it was such lawlessness that the
[56:19] law allow them to break into people's
[56:21] houses and do
[56:24] sodomy that which has been or that which
[56:27] is has already
[56:29] been thank God that we're protected by
[56:31] the grace of
[56:33] God here it is brother says an
[56:36] unchanging God with unchanging ways what
[56:39] he did at the first he will have to keep
[56:41] on doing until it's done for the last
[56:44] time there will never be a change
[56:46] everybody Say Never Never apply that to
[56:49] the church ages the kind of man that God
[56:51] chose for the first age and how God
[56:53] manifested in that man's Ministry would
[56:55] be the example for all other ages what
[56:58] God did in the first church age is what
[57:00] he wants to do in all other ages Lord
[57:05] hallelujah all right now before I get to
[57:08] this let's see I want to play part of
[57:10] this
[57:14] video here's a video I made of this
[57:16] William bram's absolute was Jesus Christ
[57:18] not his tapes sorry I actually I want
[57:21] you to hear some of these this is a
[57:22] video I made years ago because I was so
[57:25] burdened how can these people saying
[57:27] their message Believers make brother
[57:28] Brandon the absolute and his tape's the
[57:30] absolute when brother BR said it's it
[57:32] wasn't Jesus Christ is the absolute
[57:33] there's no other
[57:35] absolute I guess it's what the Bible
[57:37] calls uh righteous
[57:41] indignation I guess this what the Bible
[57:43] calls Zeal and the church said anybody
[57:45] got any Zeal tonight for the word of God
[57:48] God loves Zeal brother now you got to
[57:50] make sure your Zeal don't eat up your
[57:51] wisdom
[57:52] though right don't be zealous over bad
[57:55] things be zealous over good
[57:58] that's why I got Zeal like I do because
[57:59] it's righteous Zeal I know what the
[58:00] Bible says I know what brother Ram said
[58:03] Hallelujah on this topic I don't know
[58:04] everything on every topic but I know
[58:06] what he said on this
[58:07] topic and so this is a 30 minute video
[58:10] guess it it's 30 minute video I can send
[58:12] the link to you just text me whatever uh
[58:14] just be careful on YouTube I know I you
[58:16] know but what what can you say brother
[58:18] brandom had radio Ministries during his
[58:19] life but you got to be careful on the
[58:20] radio too some people say you shouldn't
[58:22] be on YouTube well why is brother BR on
[58:24] the radio then it's the same thing right
[58:26] it's still getting messages out there
[58:28] you can still pick up good stuff and bad
[58:31] stuff Glory all right I'm going to try
[58:34] to
[58:35] go I'm speeding up a little bit William
[58:37] bram's absent was Jesus Christ name of
[58:40] the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of
[58:41] this video is to prove that William
[58:42] bram's absolute was the person of Jesus
[58:44] Christ and not his tapes yes you could
[58:46] say William bram's absolute was Jesus
[58:47] Christ the Holy Ghost the word of God
[58:49] and the Bible so I this video shows
[58:51] brother said all these are the absolute
[58:53] but they're only one they're God right
[58:56] Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost the word of
[58:58] God the Bible brother quotes all these
[59:00] are the absolute never once did he say
[59:02] I'm the
[59:03] absolute and not not the
[59:05] Bible
[59:07] nonsense brother Ram said I'm not
[59:10] infallible brother Ram said no Prophet
[59:12] was infallible in everything they ever
[59:14] said or
[59:15] did Hallelujah brother R said in one
[59:18] quote I got it on here he said to make
[59:20] me infallible is Tommy root you know
[59:23] what that is like rotten stuff
[59:27] right right to make me the infallible is
[59:30] Tommy
[59:32] Rod but yet when he said thus say to the
[59:34] Lord is that infallible yes because
[59:36] you're separating the prophet side from
[59:38] The Human Side and the church said I
[59:40] don't want you to fall asleep that's why
[59:41] I'm saying that I want to hear you say
[59:43] amen I tell you w't me be falling asleep
[59:45] if you're watching whatever your
[59:46] favorite thing
[59:47] is Right amen amen you be falling asleep
[59:50] on me right cuz it's not me preaching
[59:52] it's God's word hallelujah amen when I
[59:55] get tired I got to stand up too I when I
[59:57] get tired I stand up and say praise God
[59:59] glory you got to wake yourself up amen
[1:00:01] don't get tired on God
[1:00:04] hallelujah but he never said takes wor
[1:00:06] the absolute as the T Church
[1:00:08] Jeffersonville erroneously teaches I
[1:00:10] first want to express my gratitude to
[1:00:11] God
[1:00:12] bit I'm very
[1:00:16] thankful I've reached out to people in
[1:00:18] Jeffersonville uh they wouldn't accept
[1:00:21] uh correction that's fine but they're
[1:00:23] going to be uh oh thank you brother
[1:00:26] oh yeah so I start with first you have
[1:00:27] to Define an absolute the
[1:00:30] absolute
[1:00:33] sorry the
[1:00:36] absolute well I don't walk worthy no but
[1:00:40] Christ in me makes me walk worthy I love
[1:00:44] him I testify of him I'm not perfect
[1:00:46] never will be in this world you're not
[1:00:49] perfect never will be but my love to him
[1:00:53] so in that quote brother says I'm not
[1:00:54] perfect but an absolute is perfect
[1:00:57] according to brother Ram's own
[1:00:59] definition that's why it's important to
[1:01:01] Define things let me see if I can go
[1:01:02] back sorry I having a little trouble
[1:01:03] with the controls
[1:01:06] here oh yeah I skipped ah head way too
[1:01:10] much forgive me from his Webster's
[1:01:13] Dictionary was
[1:01:15] similar see Unlimited in its power
[1:01:19] perfect in itself and it really is an
[1:01:22] ultimate the word absolute okay so here
[1:01:26] brother bam reads out of a Webster
[1:01:28] dictionary how many got a Websters out
[1:01:30] there well I got on my phone now I can
[1:01:32] get on my phone that's a blessing in
[1:01:34] high school I couldn't do that I had to
[1:01:35] go look in the actual dictionary anybody
[1:01:37] remember that oh a you dated yourself
[1:01:41] see an absolute is Unlimited in its
[1:01:43] power brother said oh it's perfect in
[1:01:45] itself brother BR said I'm not perfect
[1:01:47] so that instantly shows he cannot be the
[1:01:49] absolute right only Jesus Christ can be
[1:01:52] the absolute
[1:01:54] am and it really is Ultimate the word
[1:01:58] absolute brother bram's own words
[1:02:01] disprove Jefferson Bill's beliefs that
[1:02:03] every word of brother Bram is the
[1:02:04] absolute as you'll soon see based upon
[1:02:05] these definitions only God or Jesus
[1:02:07] Christ can be the absolute scripture
[1:02:09] says the Lord God omnipotent reth which
[1:02:10] means Almighty ruler of all Revelation
[1:02:12] 196 and I okay so see omnipotent brother
[1:02:15] says brother said the absolute is all
[1:02:18] powerful that's what the word omnipotent
[1:02:20] means never said I'm I'm
[1:02:23] omnipotent right he said the Bible said
[1:02:26] Jesus is omnipotent everybody got that
[1:02:29] amen as it were the voice of a great
[1:02:31] multitude and as the voice of many
[1:02:33] Waters and as the voice of Mighty
[1:02:35] thunderings sing Allelujah for the Lord
[1:02:39] God omnipotent
[1:02:42] reth brother Brandon plainly says he is
[1:02:44] not perfect so that discludes him and
[1:02:47] every single word of his as being the
[1:02:52] absolute don't walk worthy no but
[1:02:57] Limited in Power and Jesus had all power
[1:03:01] Jesus had all power this proves Christ
[1:03:02] is the absolute Matthew
[1:03:05] 2818 and Jesus came and spake unto them
[1:03:07] saying all power is given unto me so
[1:03:10] he's the absolute he's got all
[1:03:12] power on the other hand brother brandham
[1:03:15] admits he has no power just like all of
[1:03:18] us
[1:03:19] have now when Jesus Christ heals the
[1:03:22] sick now I don't say they'll be healed I
[1:03:24] can't tell you that remember I have no
[1:03:27] power to heal I don't have power you
[1:03:30] don't have any power none of us does we
[1:03:32] have authority how many understands that
[1:03:35] and the church said amen see to be the
[1:03:38] absolute you have to have all you have
[1:03:39] to be omnipotent Almighty all power
[1:03:42] perfect but says I'm not perfect I have
[1:03:44] no power I'm sorry he's not the absolute
[1:03:47] right he can't be because only one
[1:03:49] person fits that qualification you know
[1:03:51] who he is amen hallelujah I'm glad I
[1:03:54] know him amen prise the Lord I know him
[1:03:56] in the power of his resurrection and the
[1:03:58] fellowship of his sufferings hallelujah
[1:04:01] amen I'm not going to play all this but
[1:04:03] I want to hit some
[1:04:04] highlights next God's absolute is
[1:04:07] himself and his word some of these
[1:04:09] already I went over here there is only
[1:04:11] one absolute and that is God himself and
[1:04:13] his word Romans 3:4 says God forbid be
[1:04:15] true but every man a
[1:04:17] liar okay so listen here's the
[1:04:20] quote brother Ram quotes Romans 3:4 I
[1:04:23] read this earlier absolute that we're
[1:04:25] the absolute
[1:04:26] God's the God's the absolute he said let
[1:04:29] every absolute otherwise than mine be a
[1:04:31] lie mine is the truth what he says
[1:04:35] absolute to Christianity that's the end
[1:04:38] of all arguments the Bible said so that
[1:04:41] makes it
[1:04:44] right Jesus says God's word is the
[1:04:47] absolute saying Heaven and Earth shall
[1:04:49] pass away but my word shall never pass
[1:04:52] away in Matthew
[1:04:54] 24:35 this this is the scripture brother
[1:04:56] brandom uses in reference to the
[1:04:59] absolute it's almost got to a place like
[1:05:02] it was in the days of Judges everybody
[1:05:04] has their own absolute let me just stop
[1:05:06] there a moment isn't that true seems
[1:05:07] like every church has their own absolute
[1:05:09] but brother said God only has one
[1:05:12] absolute that's his
[1:05:16] word it all fails like the Pharaohs and
[1:05:19] so forth but God's absolute is his word
[1:05:22] he gives it in heavens and earth will
[1:05:24] pass away but it shall never pass away I
[1:05:27] like that how many like that friends if
[1:05:31] God himself and his word is the absolute
[1:05:34] how can the words of a man be the
[1:05:36] absolute they cannot as brother random
[1:05:40] quoted Romans 34 as proof that God is
[1:05:44] the
[1:05:45] absolute God's the absolute someone just
[1:05:48] playing that again that's probably the
[1:05:49] fourth time you've seen that tonight I
[1:05:51] don't want you to forget it that is the
[1:05:54] truth is the absolute to
[1:05:58] Christianity now let's listen to four
[1:06:00] statements by brother brandham that
[1:06:02] prove his absolute was only Jesus CH
[1:06:05] Jesus Christ and there can be no other
[1:06:07] absolute and there is only one absolute
[1:06:11] always says there's only always one
[1:06:14] absolute how many other ways can you say
[1:06:16] it there's only one there's no other
[1:06:19] it's always just one he's saying Jesus
[1:06:21] Christ is our absolute
[1:06:23] Hallelujah but these people from
[1:06:24] Jeffersonville are saying the tapes are
[1:06:26] the absolute shame on them they're lying
[1:06:29] they're
[1:06:30] liars and God will make them uh God will
[1:06:33] hold them accountable if they don't
[1:06:35] repent does everybody
[1:06:37] understand I'm showing you the quotes
[1:06:39] you can hear them yourself you can read
[1:06:40] the Bible yourself and that's what God
[1:06:42] wants you to do God wants you to be so
[1:06:44] in love with the word of God till no man
[1:06:46] can deceive you amen God forbid but if I
[1:06:50] should fall away and try to bring in a
[1:06:51] false Doctrine here you would say no
[1:06:53] brother Jesse that's not the truth I'm
[1:06:54] staying with the Bible
[1:06:58] Hallelujah in the church age book
[1:06:59] brother man said you'll know the seven
[1:07:01] Church age messenger when he comes he
[1:07:03] said he said the seven Church age
[1:07:05] Messenger will be in the word exactly as
[1:07:08] Paul gave it right and the church
[1:07:12] said look it up he said exactly how Paul
[1:07:16] gave the word that's how you'll know
[1:07:18] he's the seven Church age
[1:07:20] messenger Paul never said press play on
[1:07:22] the tapes Paul never said that we don't
[1:07:24] need a fivefold Minister anymore that
[1:07:27] that's what the the pastor that's what
[1:07:28] Joseph brandom said and he said you've
[1:07:30] got to catch the vision you've got to
[1:07:32] play the tapes basically saying you've
[1:07:33] got to catch the vision preachers got to
[1:07:35] sit down and play brother random that's
[1:07:37] a
[1:07:37] lie and I called him out for it he
[1:07:40] didn't receive it but that's fine he
[1:07:42] don't have to he's got his own said
[1:07:44] you're an American citizen you got the
[1:07:45] right to do that but with God God has
[1:07:47] one absolute
[1:07:49] Hallelujah God has one absolute that's
[1:07:51] his word now listen to these I've
[1:07:52] already read two of them but I don't
[1:07:54] think two of them we haven't heard yet
[1:07:56] the absolute is a person an eternal
[1:07:59] person and not a collection of audio MP3
[1:08:04] files and if your absolute is in some
[1:08:06] organization or some sensation or
[1:08:09] something else besides person the person
[1:08:12] of Jesus Christ you come to the same
[1:08:15] potion of Shame only
[1:08:18] work if your absolute is not Christ
[1:08:21] everybody see that who's the ABS the
[1:08:23] absolute's a person now see not only is
[1:08:25] is it this is the person's word this is
[1:08:27] God's word but this is the word of the
[1:08:30] person Jesus Christ is the
[1:08:35] absolute that's the only spner post of
[1:08:38] the human life and Christ Christ is the
[1:08:41] word not your
[1:08:43] church upon this absolute then he quotes
[1:08:46] Matthew 16 upon Upon This Rock I'll
[1:08:49] build my church upon this absolute I'll
[1:08:50] build my church William never said his
[1:08:52] tapes were the absolute listen as
[1:08:55] brother brandom says there is only one
[1:08:58] absolute and there is no other absolute
[1:09:01] and it wasn't his tapes and cannot be
[1:09:04] his tapes because there are no other
[1:09:06] absolutes that's
[1:09:09] right when we got one absolute that's
[1:09:11] the word of the Living God that settles
[1:09:14] it forever no matter what anyone else
[1:09:17] says okay so there's not two there's not
[1:09:20] three absolutes there's one absolute
[1:09:22] right how many believe brother BR was a
[1:09:24] prophet
[1:09:26] yes amen me too Hallelujah that's why
[1:09:27] I'm preaching
[1:09:28] [Music]
[1:09:31] this now if he is our absolute there can
[1:09:35] be no other absolute you can't have say
[1:09:38] my my church is my absolute my Creed is
[1:09:41] my absolute if Christ is your absolute
[1:09:43] you believe Christ's word there no other
[1:09:45] way to do it amen every say no other
[1:09:48] again ready no other there's no other
[1:09:50] absolute there's only one that's Jesus
[1:09:52] Christ
[1:09:56] yes sir he is my absolute now making
[1:09:58] your absolute take in the a time of my
[1:10:03] trouble he's always
[1:10:05] asking always everybody say always ready
[1:10:08] always no other there's only one always
[1:10:12] it's Jesus Christ amen hallelujah do the
[1:10:15] tap tapes help us of course I love the
[1:10:17] tapes I just listened to a message of
[1:10:18] Grace yesterday 1961 I love the tapes
[1:10:21] that's where I get my inspiration for my
[1:10:22] sermons most of the time but I never put
[1:10:25] the tapes equal to the Bible because the
[1:10:27] tapes have human
[1:10:29] mistakes
[1:10:34] Hallelujah brother brandom's personal
[1:10:36] absolute was the word oh yeah I love
[1:10:38] this one the
[1:10:39] Bible my absolute is the word the Bible
[1:10:44] and as a pastor here of the church my
[1:10:47] absolute is the word now that's what I
[1:10:49] was telling you about earlier he said my
[1:10:52] absolute is the word of God he didn't
[1:10:54] say I'm the absolute
[1:10:55] he didn't say my tapes are the absolute
[1:10:57] he said the word of God is my absolute
[1:10:59] how many enjoying these quotes by God's
[1:11:00] grace I tell you I like to hear Brother
[1:11:02] Braham say it
[1:11:03] too he puts all that emphasis on there
[1:11:05] there's no other absolute you just that
[1:11:08] Stern prophet of God hallelujah there's
[1:11:11] no other there's only one Jesus Christ
[1:11:17] Hallelujah the truth is brother Brandon
[1:11:19] preached about the absolute Jesus Christ
[1:11:22] who is the word of God or the Holy Ghost
[1:11:26] next here's three false beliefs of the
[1:11:29] tape Church move we'll play these and
[1:11:31] then we'll we'll close up here
[1:11:33] leadership at brandham Tabernacle
[1:11:35] erroneously teaches and I quote I
[1:11:38] believe everything brother brandom says
[1:11:40] is thus sayeth the Lord this message has
[1:11:42] to be my absolute I'm going to pause
[1:11:44] right there that's what Joseph Brenham
[1:11:46] brother Ram son said he even wrote to
[1:11:48] that wrote that to me in a letter I have
[1:11:50] the letter at
[1:11:52] home everything he said was thus say the
[1:11:55] that's
[1:11:57] idolatry that's like brother R said
[1:11:59] remember Shadrach Meshach and abedo
[1:12:01] brother R said that that Idol they were
[1:12:02] going to bow to was Daniel do you know
[1:12:05] brother Bram said that because the the
[1:12:07] uh the the idol was called belto shazar
[1:12:10] that was Daniel's
[1:12:11] name and brother BR said that's what
[1:12:14] people are going to do at the end
[1:12:16] time they're trying to get people to bow
[1:12:18] down to brother Bram trying to make him
[1:12:20] God he's not God he was a servant of God
[1:12:22] he's a prophet of God hallelujah right
[1:12:27] end quote this statement makes every
[1:12:30] word and I have recordings of these as
[1:12:32] well plus the letters I have video
[1:12:33] recordings of these brother brandham
[1:12:36] thus sayith the Lord or
[1:12:40] infallible additionally they teach and I
[1:12:43] quote it must be all or nothing I have
[1:12:46] to believe that everything on tape is
[1:12:49] thus sayith the Lord and the absolute
[1:12:52] the token for our day and I must
[1:12:54] unquestion L believe every word of
[1:12:57] brother Bram on tape end quote that's
[1:13:00] what he wrote to me in the letter it's
[1:13:02] either all or nothing and brother Ram
[1:13:03] said that's not how it is brother Ram
[1:13:05] said you got to be careful some of it's
[1:13:06] human some of it's God the way you'll
[1:13:08] know is thus sayith the Lord that's
[1:13:12] God
[1:13:16] hallelujah this is a dangerous dangerous
[1:13:19] false do and I humbly believe it's the
[1:13:21] spirit of idolatry Spirit of idolatry
[1:13:23] the danger of these statements is
[1:13:25] deifying William brandham by making
[1:13:28] every word he said the absolute when not
[1:13:31] every word he said was from God as he
[1:13:34] admitted himself on numerous occasions
[1:13:37] so brother Braham admitted many times
[1:13:39] not every word I say is from God brother
[1:13:40] Braham said it many
[1:13:42] times I'm going to play it for you in
[1:13:44] 1958 by faith Moses brother brandom said
[1:13:47] in regards to his 1977 prediction it was
[1:13:51] not the Lord saying it which means it
[1:13:53] was not thus sayith the Lord
[1:13:56] and that I predict now this is not the
[1:13:58] Lord saying this the other about the
[1:14:00] woman in this is the Lord but I
[1:14:03] predicted in 19 and and 3 33 that the
[1:14:08] world would meet total Annihilation
[1:14:10] before 77 now this shows right here how
[1:14:13] insane brandham Tabernacle is they say
[1:14:16] every word is thus say the lord well if
[1:14:18] it is
[1:14:19] then how can this be thus say the lord
[1:14:22] it's not he this is not the Lord saying
[1:14:24] this it's a total
[1:14:25] contradiction brother saying this is not
[1:14:28] the Lord but Jeffersonville is saying
[1:14:29] this is the Lord that's a
[1:14:32] contradiction does everybody see that
[1:14:34] it's insan that's why I said they have a
[1:14:36] spirit of
[1:14:37] insanity if they say every word on the
[1:14:39] tape is thus say the Lord yeah brother
[1:14:41] said this is not the
[1:14:42] Lord You Know What It Takes brother irin
[1:14:44] is going to take some real mature
[1:14:45] Believers to really believe God in this
[1:14:47] day it's going to take that statue
[1:14:49] perfect man amen it's going to take some
[1:14:52] real Believers to stand up to the evil
[1:14:53] Giants of this day
[1:14:56] I'm almost done you been a great
[1:14:58] audience William random also said it was
[1:15:00] a very awful thing in Tommy rot to make
[1:15:03] him
[1:15:04] infallible they're claiming here that
[1:15:06] some Breen up there that said that I
[1:15:08] sent them up there and they're preaching
[1:15:10] that men should leave their wives and
[1:15:12] hunt for their spiritual mate and that
[1:15:15] um that I am perfectly infallible okay
[1:15:19] so brother talking about he said some
[1:15:21] people went up to Michigan and said
[1:15:22] brother R said you can leave your wife
[1:15:24] and go find a spirit ual wife that's
[1:15:26] adultery and then they were saying
[1:15:28] brother Rand is perfectly in Fable
[1:15:30] brother R said those are some of the
[1:15:31] awfulest things a person could say to
[1:15:34] make brother brandham infallible or
[1:15:36] every word he said is thus say the Lord
[1:15:39] and yet that's what the church in
[1:15:40] brandham Tabernacle that's what they say
[1:15:42] they say every word is infallible I got
[1:15:44] the letter I got the
[1:15:47] audio if there's nothing and some the aw
[1:15:51] some awest things you've ever heard this
[1:15:53] church knows that we don't stand for No
[1:15:55] Such Tommy Rod is that and I shared this
[1:15:58] with Joseph and Billy Paul it's Tommy
[1:15:59] Rod if you say every word's in Fable
[1:16:02] that's Tommy rot it's awful now they
[1:16:04] were nice in their replies but they
[1:16:06] wouldn't
[1:16:08] repent so who you going to stand with
[1:16:10] you got to stand with the truth amen
[1:16:12] don't stand with me stand with the
[1:16:13] absolute amen hallelujah because that's
[1:16:16] what I'm standing with that's what we
[1:16:17] all want to stand with is God's absolute
[1:16:19] the word of God hallelujah
[1:16:23] right thirdly Jeffersonville teaches
[1:16:26] only the true Seed of Abraham believe
[1:16:29] every word on brother bram's tapes or
[1:16:31] thus sayith the Lord which excludes
[1:16:34] everyone else from being the Royal Seed
[1:16:36] of Abraham and I quote but God's Prophet
[1:16:40] told us there would be a group of people
[1:16:42] that would believe every word they are
[1:16:44] the real living Seed of Abraham okay so
[1:16:48] Joseph brandham said this you have to
[1:16:49] believe every word on the tape or you're
[1:16:51] not this the spiritual Seed of Abraham
[1:16:53] look at the fear that creates in people
[1:16:56] oh well I believe brother is a prophet
[1:16:58] and there there's truth on the tapes
[1:17:00] well I better listen to his
[1:17:01] son that's an evil spirit because
[1:17:04] brother just said you can't make me imp
[1:17:06] perfectly
[1:17:07] infallible that's Tommy rot everybody
[1:17:12] understand
[1:17:14] quote friends notice the pressure of
[1:17:17] fear this movement is using oh yeah
[1:17:19] that's what brother said false prophets
[1:17:21] will always put fear on you to make you
[1:17:23] follow them right so that's what I
[1:17:25] believe I've told well I put out there
[1:17:26] to Joseph I shared the video with him I
[1:17:28] believe you're a false prophet brother
[1:17:30] I've told him that I've told I've
[1:17:32] emailed to Brand tabern about 30 times
[1:17:33] they never email back and I said I'll
[1:17:36] come up there and meet with you I said
[1:17:37] I'll I'll drive down there I'll meet
[1:17:38] with you and talk about these things but
[1:17:40] they ever want to meet with me
[1:17:43] no I said I made a 30 minute long video
[1:17:46] and just for Joseph and Milly Paul just
[1:17:48] pleading with them to hear me meet with
[1:17:50] me they would they watch it well at
[1:17:51] least somebody ran up Tabernacle watch
[1:17:53] it it's got like eight views on it
[1:17:54] somebody somebody watch it but they want
[1:17:56] to meet with me brother uran cuz who am
[1:17:59] I I'm nobody that's fine I want to be a
[1:18:01] nobody but I want to know somebody named
[1:18:04] Jesus I want to know the absolute praise
[1:18:07] God say falsely if you don't believe
[1:18:11] every word of brother brandom on tape as
[1:18:13] thus sayith the Lord you are not the
[1:18:15] real Royal Seed of
[1:18:18] Abraham the truth is real Believers the
[1:18:21] real Seed of Abraham do not exalt every
[1:18:23] word of William Brandon to be infallible
[1:18:26] or thus sayith the
[1:18:28] Lord this is because they know brother
[1:18:30] brandham says a true prophet and true
[1:18:32] leaders won't hold you to their own
[1:18:35] words in fear but will point you to the
[1:18:37] word of
[1:18:39] God Church age book chapter n leoan
[1:18:42] Church age have you ever noticed how the
[1:18:45] people who lead others astray B words
[1:18:48] themselves by fear I'm reading a qu they
[1:18:51] say that if the people don't do what
[1:18:52] they say or if they leave then
[1:18:54] destruction will follow they are false
[1:18:57] prophets for a true Prophet will always
[1:18:59] lead one to the word a true Prophet will
[1:19:02] always lead you to the word and the
[1:19:03] church
[1:19:04] said I know you're get tired Jesus
[1:19:07] Christ and he won't tell the people to
[1:19:09] fear Him or what he says but to fear
[1:19:12] what the word says brother said a real
[1:19:14] Prophet will say fear what the word says
[1:19:17] Don't Fear a man fear the word sound
[1:19:20] sound to anybody like the fear of the
[1:19:21] Lord is the beginning of wisdom that
[1:19:22] that sound scriptural right
[1:19:27] thankfully as you listen to more of
[1:19:29] brother brandom's tapes you find the
[1:19:31] truth that he made human mistakes yet he
[1:19:34] was a genuine
[1:19:35] Prophet brother brandom said he was not
[1:19:38] infallible okay now listen to this
[1:19:39] brother brand said I'm not in Fable but
[1:19:41] yeah I just showed you brother br's son
[1:19:43] says every word on the tape is thus
[1:19:45] sayith the
[1:19:46] Lord who's right brother brandom or a
[1:19:48] son brother rand's
[1:19:51] right make mistakes you pray for me I'm
[1:19:54] not
[1:19:55] I'm your not
[1:19:57] infallible brother brandom said prophets
[1:20:00] are not infallible
[1:20:02] people prophets are not people prophets
[1:20:06] are
[1:20:09] not brother brandom said there were
[1:20:11] Mix-Ups on his tapes see look at this
[1:20:13] brother said there's mixup there's
[1:20:15] mistakes on the tapes yet brandom
[1:20:17] Tabernacle says every word is thus
[1:20:18] sayith the Lord I'm sorry God Don't Make
[1:20:21] Mistakes
[1:20:22] church has God ever made a mistake
[1:20:25] no so if there's mistakes on the tapes
[1:20:27] then they can't be infallible that's
[1:20:29] right they can't be the
[1:20:32] absolute about like other day I got
[1:20:34] something mixed up I happen to hear it I
[1:20:36] called it right there and it's on the
[1:20:38] tape and I I probably hear from it but
[1:20:40] if you Haven to catch that on your tape
[1:20:42] remember look in the Bible I love that
[1:20:43] brother R says there's mistakes on the
[1:20:45] tape so if you catch a mistake he said
[1:20:47] look in the Bible can we all say amen
[1:20:50] amen if you hear something on tape and
[1:20:52] it's not exactly right brother R said
[1:20:54] look in the Bible
[1:20:56] Hallelujah and he was talking about the
[1:20:58] feasts the seven feasts of Israel in
[1:21:00] that particular
[1:21:02] quote brother brandom said prophets make
[1:21:05] mistakes and every Prophet made their
[1:21:07] mistakes said every Prophet makes
[1:21:10] mistakes now all I can say I'm a man my
[1:21:13] words can just fail it's like any other
[1:21:15] man all of us I prove to you tonight
[1:21:16] that every Prophet everything else they
[1:21:18] made their mistakes but God makes no
[1:21:21] mistakes his word is
[1:21:26] brother random said he made thousands of
[1:21:28] mistakes each
[1:21:29] year I make thousands of mistakes each
[1:21:32] month and each year Sur I do but when I
[1:21:35] see him wrong I said God I didn't mean
[1:21:37] to do that you know my heart I didn't
[1:21:39] mean to do that I was trapped into that
[1:21:42] I didn't mean to do you forgive me
[1:21:45] Lord Brother brandom said every Prophet
[1:21:47] must be tested by the word have test we
[1:21:50] must test and prove all things that's in
[1:21:53] Acts 17 remember the ible said those in
[1:21:56] uh uh Berea were more noble than those
[1:21:58] in thessalonica because they took the
[1:22:00] word of God what Paul said and they
[1:22:02] search the scriptures every day how many
[1:22:04] reading your Bible every day you better
[1:22:07] if not you're going to get deceived if
[1:22:08] you don't read your Bible every
[1:22:13] day the word comes to the
[1:22:17] prophets how do you test the prophet to
[1:22:19] find out whether it is according to the
[1:22:23] word
[1:22:25] if it's according to the word then God's
[1:22:27] word becomes a
[1:22:30] lie we all speak the same
[1:22:34] thing then we must speak not contrary
[1:22:37] but exactly with this everybody say
[1:22:40] exactly ready exactly with this word we
[1:22:43] have to speak exactly what the Bible
[1:22:45] says that's how a true Prophet is tested
[1:22:49] word that's how a true Prophet is tested
[1:22:52] whether he's got the word the Bible say
[1:22:54] if their testimony is not according to
[1:22:56] the law and Prophets there's no light in
[1:22:58] them it's got to be according to the
[1:23:02] word
[1:23:04] amen now here is the time okay now I'm
[1:23:07] going to skip ahead I got to close
[1:23:08] because there's so many I I didn't
[1:23:09] realize brother said yeah brother said
[1:23:11] we must prove All Things by the
[1:23:14] scripture see everything on tape you got
[1:23:16] to take it back to the Bible he said
[1:23:19] that but let me go check that by the
[1:23:20] Bible I got to prove All Things by now
[1:23:22] look brother said look brother said if
[1:23:24] it's contrary to my faith and yet the
[1:23:26] scripture says so then the scripture is
[1:23:28] right and I'm wrong look how humble
[1:23:31] brother irin brother brah
[1:23:33] was if I say something on my tapes
[1:23:35] there's a mixup he said look in the
[1:23:37] Bible if the and if I say something
[1:23:39] that's not in the Bible then I'm wrong
[1:23:41] the Bible's right hallelujah amen

[1:23:55] the end you need to watch this video if
[1:23:57] you if you have any questions about the
[1:23:58] absolute it'll help
[1:24:04] you I'm going to close with this
[1:24:09] quote brother said that's where we point
[1:24:11] to Jesus Christ the son of God so that's
[1:24:13] what the tapes do the tapes point us to
[1:24:15] Jesus Christ don't they right we see
[1:24:17] brother R discern people in the prayer
[1:24:19] lines we we hear Miracles all these
[1:24:20] stories what does that do it makes us go
[1:24:22] read our Bible right

[1:24:39] name and he will become he will become
[1:24:41] not brother brand brother said brother
[1:24:43] never said I'll become the absolute he
[1:24:45] said that Jesus will become the absolute
[1:24:48] of the entire congregation we ask it in
[1:24:52] Jesus name and the church said let's
[1:24:54] stand to our feet I'm going to close
[1:24:58] here they sing I love him I love him
[1:25:01] then brother Ram said how many feels
[1:25:03] he's your absolute the word he is the
[1:25:05] word do you believe that he's the word
[1:25:07] and the Holy Spirit dramatized that word
[1:25:09] to make that light living you of the
[1:25:11] word the Vindication of the word put the
[1:25:14] word in your heart put Let the Holy
[1:25:16] Spirit come in and watch the word move
[1:25:18] believe be humble don't desire to be a
[1:25:20] great somebody be a nobody that God can
[1:25:22] make you a somebody amen God bless you
[1:25:25] let's have a let's bow our hearts for
[1:25:27] just a moment I know I preach a hard
[1:25:29] thing I know I preach where I have to
[1:25:32] call names but Paul called names brother
[1:25:34] brandham called names sometimes my name
[1:25:37] has been called people call people can
[1:25:38] call whatever they want but I'm trying
[1:25:41] to get you to see who the absolute is
[1:25:43] and I got to call names to do it because
[1:25:45] they've spread false Doctrine to
[1:25:46] millions of people around the world and
[1:25:48] I'm just one voice there's a few voices
[1:25:50] there's some voices crying out against
[1:25:52] these lies
[1:25:54] and I want to put my voice in there they
[1:25:57] told Brother r one time brother Ram
[1:25:58] that's the pastor's job to teach about
[1:26:00] women not cutting their hair and not
[1:26:02] wearing makeup and brother Bram said but
[1:26:04] if they're not doing it someone's got to
[1:26:05] do it right so if all these preachers
[1:26:08] won't call out Bram Tabernacle I'll call
[1:26:10] it
[1:26:11] out it's their job to call it out if
[1:26:14] they don't I'll make Jesus Christ the
[1:26:16] absolute amen I'll preach it Sister
[1:26:18] Sarah if nobody else will preach it I'll
[1:26:20] preach it sister Lydia right brother
[1:26:22] Irvin if nobody else will say it nobody
[1:26:24] else call out these these people
[1:26:25] spreading lies and worshiping brother
[1:26:27] brandom I'll call it out because I
[1:26:29] believe Jesus Christ is the absolute
[1:26:31] Hallelujah let's bow our
[1:26:33] hearts father God we thank you for
[1:26:35] tonight Lord God thank you for the
[1:26:36] patience of your people Lord it was like
[1:26:37] an hour and 26 minute sermon there Lord
[1:26:40] God bless them Lord I didn't think it'd
[1:26:42] be that long but Lord I just trust Lord
[1:26:44] that this nail was clinched Lord God
[1:26:46] that the truth was so uh securely
[1:26:49] planted in their hearts that this church
[1:26:52] will never receive false teachings
[1:26:54] that worship your servant brother
[1:26:56] Brandon and they'll never make a tape or
[1:26:59] a book an absolute when Jesus Christ is
[1:27:02] the absolute and Lord I joined brother
[1:27:04] brandom in that prayer Lord God lord may
[1:27:06] Jesus Christ become the absolute to this
[1:27:08] entire congregation even these little
[1:27:10] children Lord God Hallelujah to every
[1:27:13] adult from the youngest to the oldest
[1:27:15] may Jesus Christ be the absolute to each
[1:27:17] and every one Lord God Amen and may we
[1:27:20] take everything brother Ram said as he
[1:27:22] said may we take everything he said back
[1:27:24] to the Bible may we prove All Things by
[1:27:28] the word of God Amen Hallelujah for we
[1:27:31] know Lord God you are the only
[1:27:32] infallible one you're always the
[1:27:34] absolute you're the only absolute Hall
[1:27:36] there can be no other hallelujah thank
[1:27:38] you God for your truth Lord Jesus father
[1:27:41] let your blessings be upon this people
[1:27:43] Lord God lord knowing this was maybe one
[1:27:45] of my final times for a little bit to
[1:27:47] preach to them Lord I just wanted to lay
[1:27:48] this in there so they knew Jesus Christ
[1:27:51] was the absolute and the message is the
[1:27:53] Bible verses
[1:27:54] that God is giving us right now that
[1:27:56] God's fulfilling right now Hallelujah
[1:27:58] Grant it Lord God and in that case the
[1:28:00] message is the absolute the Bible
[1:28:03] scriptures being fulfilled today are the
[1:28:05] absolute because it's the word of God
[1:28:07] hallelujah bless your people with a
[1:28:09] simple understanding may they receive
[1:28:11] the truth of the Holy Spirit I ask it by
[1:28:13] the spirit of truth I ask it in the name
