[0:02] but shun profane and Fain B for they
[0:07] will increase unto more
[0:11] ungodliness God will make you give an
[0:13] account for Every Idle Word that you
[0:17] speak greetings friends in the matchless
[0:20] name of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[0:23] purpose of this video is to go through
[0:24] the scriptures from St Paul about
[0:26] knowing when to avoid vain babblings
[0:30] endless questions and fables in order to
[0:33] rightly defend the Gospel of Jesus
[0:35] Christ hi friends I'm Jesse Smith pastor
[0:38] brde of Christ Fellowship here in akan
[0:40] Ohio USA and I defend the Gospel of
[0:43] Jesus Christ that Christ revealed to St
[0:45] Paul then had to restore through Martin
[0:47] Luther John Wesley and the late William
[0:49] brandom 1909 to 1965 I also defend
[0:53] brother am's Godly Christian character
[0:55] here's the outline of the video first I
[0:57] want to look at a balance on question
[1:00] asking and then I want to go through
[1:02] numerous portions of scripture where St
[1:05] Paul talks about avoiding vain babblings
[1:08] fables and so forth then we'll close
[1:11] with accusers of the
[1:12] Brethren so let's begin with balance on
[1:15] question
[1:16] asking friends I'm sure you agree with
[1:19] me that we should answer questions
[1:21] people have about the Gospel of Jesus
[1:23] Christ and of course in the context of
[1:25] our lives and our Generations questions
[1:27] people have about God's true Prophet the
[1:29] late William brandham this is according
[1:31] to 1 Peter 3:15 always have an answer to
[1:34] those who have a question about your
[1:36] faith an answer in meekness and fear
[1:39] then 1 Thessalonians 5 says prove all
[1:41] things I love these scriptures I believe
[1:44] these scriptures and I certainly applied
[1:46] them to my life since I started
[1:48] preaching back in 2004 recently this
[1:51] week though I was reading through St
[1:53] Paul's letters to the Thessalonians and
[1:55] to Timothy and I was just again
[1:58] surprised and refreshed to see how many
[1:59] times Paul told Timothy and the
[2:02] Believers to avoid vain babblings fables
[2:04] endless genealogies and so forth so I
[2:07] feel like the Holy Spirit has given me a
[2:09] fresh understanding of this so that's
[2:12] why I felt inspired to make this video
[2:14] so friends we're told always to have an
[2:16] answer and prove all things yet by the
[2:18] same man by the Holy Spirit through Paul
[2:21] who said prove all things he also told
[2:23] us to avoid certain types of questions
[2:26] this then proves that some questions are
[2:28] sincere and other questions are
[2:30] insincere so we need the Holy Spirit and
[2:33] we need God's grace to help us discern
[2:35] who's really interested in learning
[2:37] about Jesus Christ and on the opposite
[2:40] end who's trying to attack Jesus Christ
[2:42] and the true Servants of Jesus Christ
[2:45] This reminds us of the Lord Jesus who
[2:47] said let the blind lead the blind cast
[2:50] not your Pearls Before Swine and we know
[2:52] the Lord Jesus answered all the
[2:54] questions of the Pharisees and Sadducees
[2:57] until that they didn't want to ask any
[2:59] more questions
[3:00] that was during the Lord's Ministry but
[3:02] then when he was arrested there were
[3:05] times during his trials where he did not
[3:07] say a word he did not defend himself at
[3:09] all he didn't answer questions so we
[3:12] know the Holy Ghost will lead and guide
[3:14] us on what to say and when to say it we
[3:17] thank the Lord for the balance on the
[3:19] word of God how we're to prove all
[3:21] things but then also be careful about
[3:23] going down endless rabbit Trails as we
[3:25] might say or fruitless or frivolous
[3:29] conversation s that don't lead us into
[3:31] godliness as we'll begin to see now
[3:34] through the scriptures so let's look at
[3:36] our first passage it's first Timothy 1:3
[3:39] Paul says to Timothy thou mightest
[3:42] charge some that they teach no other
[3:44] Doctrine so for us as message Believers
[3:47] our Doctrine is the Bible we have no
[3:49] Creed but Christ no book but the Bible
[3:51] so for us we have to remember we teach
[3:54] no other Doctrine except what's in the
[3:56] scripture that Paul told us like women
[3:58] and men's hair length there's no women
[4:00] preachers the Lord Jesus Christ water
[4:02] baptism the three works of Grace and
[4:05] there's numerous other Pauline doctrines
[4:07] that most churches reject and especially
[4:09] accusers of brother brandham they reject
[4:11] the Bible doctrines that Paul gave us 1
[4:14] Timothy 1:4 says neither give heed to
[4:16] fables and endless genealogies which
[4:19] minister questions rather than Godly
[4:21] edifying which is in faith so do very
[4:24] important scripture right here Paul
[4:26] tells Timothy focus on the doctrine
[4:28] don't spend your time on fa
[4:30] endless genealogies because these
[4:32] Minister questions rather than Godly
[4:35] edifying and edifying means stewardship
[4:38] other places it means building up or
[4:40] equipping so here we can see a tactic of
[4:43] Satan Satan's tactic is to get people
[4:46] believing fables or lies and also
[4:50] investing their time in Endless studies
[4:52] which only create more questions and
[4:54] don't build up people's faith I would
[4:57] say many of brother Ram's accusers are
[4:59] guilty of this they've created many
[5:01] fables false assumptions about brother
[5:04] brandom and then they want to ask
[5:06] endless questions some about
[5:08] genealogies but many questions are about
[5:11] the people around brother brandom as
[5:13] I've said before they're trying to get
[5:15] our attention off the word of God that
[5:17] the Lord Jesus revealed to brother
[5:18] brandom so friends let's remember let's
[5:20] be a source of edification a source of
[5:23] stewardship equipping building people up
[5:26] in the doctrine Paul said no other
[5:28] Doctrine so we have to to spend our time
[5:30] on the doctrine not to create more
[5:33] questions but to give them faith-based
[5:35] answers so do Paul told Timothy then in
[5:39] verse 5 the end of the Commandment is
[5:40] Charity of a pure heart and of a good
[5:42] conscience and of Faith unfeigned so
[5:44] that's what the message of the hour
[5:45] produces it produces a pure heart
[5:47] because we only believe the pure word of
[5:49] God from Paul's gospels of course the
[5:51] New Testament and Old Testament as well
[5:54] but it's denominations and Creeds of men
[5:56] that create fables like the Fable that
[5:58] God is three persons that's a complete
[6:00] Fable Paul never taught it Peter never
[6:02] taught it the Bible never taught it and
[6:05] so people that believe these fables or
[6:07] false doctrines something is off in
[6:10] their life we'll get to more about that
[6:12] later by God's grace and also I made a
[6:14] video about that recently 110 proofs
[6:18] from Bible doctrine that the message of
[6:20] the hour is the true Revelation and
[6:22] understanding of the scripture it's
[6:24] proof we are the Bride of Jesus Christ
[6:25] who follow brother Ram's bible-based
[6:27] message 1 Timothy 1 says from which some
[6:31] have swerved have turned aside unto vain
[6:34] jangling so there's people that claim to
[6:37] be Christians but their hearts are no
[6:39] longer pure they don't have genuine
[6:41] Faith anymore and they've swerved aside
[6:43] and they focus on Vain jangling and vain
[6:47] means useless and jangling means Babble
[6:50] or just random talk so instead of
[6:52] spending time on Doctrine these accusers
[6:55] who have the wrong Spirit spend their
[6:57] time on useless Babble as Paul said
[7:01] Babble about fables they've made up
[7:04] endless genealogies endless questions
[7:07] some of these people that have left the
[7:08] message they're the very personification
[7:11] of vanity all the content they produce
[7:14] on social media or any other public
[7:17] platform is useless it doesn't lead
[7:20] people back to the Scripture it leads
[7:23] them to more and more questions in order
[7:25] to slander and defame in many cases
[7:27] brother Brandon but also the current
[7:29] preachers of the message of the hour the
[7:32] second passage is in the same book 1
[7:34] Timothy 4 we'll start at verse 6 read 67
[7:37] and 16 Paul says nourish up the Saints
[7:41] in the words of faith and good Doctrine
[7:44] but refuse profane and old wives fables
[7:48] and exercise thyself rather unto
[7:50] godliness so profane means Wicked in the
[7:54] Greek so there are some group of
[7:56] Christians they don't focus on faith and
[7:59] good Doctrine they just tell Wicked
[8:01] fables or Wicked madeup stories and
[8:04] here's my humble opinion of some of
[8:06] these profane
[8:08] fables it is a profane Fable of some of
[8:12] the accusers of brother brandham that
[8:13] say brother brandham is responsible for
[8:15] Jim Jones's wickedness that's a profane
[8:19] Fable shortly after brother random and
[8:22] Jim Jones went separate ways Jim Jones
[8:25] started exalting himself as God I have
[8:27] three videos on this so I'll leave links
[8:29] to that in the description and by the
[8:31] end of his life Jim Jones was a complete
[8:34] Wicked heretic not even preaching the
[8:36] Bible so shame on those people who
[8:39] slander brother brandom and create this
[8:41] profane Fable and try to make brother
[8:44] Bram responsible for the wicked sins of
[8:46] Jim Jones another Fable is that brother
[8:49] Brandon was in cahoots with the KKK
[8:52] that's a fable where brother Brandon was
[8:53] in cahoots with Roy Davis that's a fable
[8:56] and there's so many other Wicked fables
[8:58] people have made made up about brother
[9:00] Brenham and they're spending their time
[9:02] on the fables rather than faith and good
[9:05] Doctrine like the doctrine of the Lord
[9:07] Jesus Christ water baptism like the
[9:10] doctrine of women should have long uncut
[9:12] hair and never cut it and it's a shame
[9:15] if they do it's a shame if men grow
[9:17] their hair long and uncut notice what
[9:20] Paul says about this good Doctrine in
[9:21] verse 16 take heed unto thyself and to
[9:24] the doctrine continue in them for in
[9:26] doing this Thou shalt both save thyself
[9:29] and them that hear thee so this is
[9:30] doctrine that saves of course Doctrine
[9:32] is instruction so instructing people how
[9:35] to repent have faith in Jesus Christ and
[9:37] the blood of Jesus Christ saved by grace
[9:40] through faith and then as Ephesians 2:10
[9:42] says do good works that God has created
[9:45] us for we are God's workmanship created
[9:48] unto good works the third passage is 1
[9:51] Timothy 620 and 21 Paul told Timothy
[9:54] avoid profane and vain babblings then in
[9:57] verse 21 which some profan blessing have
[10:00] aired concerning the faith so Paul said
[10:03] some Christians AED in their faith by
[10:04] giving too much time to babbling again
[10:07] fruitless talk fruitless discussions
[10:11] empty discussions that do not build
[10:14] faith and cause more questions than
[10:17] answers so we can clearly see those
[10:19] people who are attacking brother brandom
[10:21] due to their cognitive dissonance and
[10:23] falsely accusing brother brandom of
[10:25] things he's not guilty of this proves
[10:27] they've aired in their faith and those
[10:29] people the Bible says we should avoid a
[10:32] fourth passage is 2 Timothy 2:1
[10:35] 15-19 Paul tells Timothy to study
[10:37] himself approved says very similar words
[10:39] to the first letter of Timothy verse 16
[10:42] but shun profane and vain babblings for
[10:44] they will increase unto more ungodliness
[10:47] here's a major point about when we know
[10:50] someone is involved in profane and vain
[10:52] babblings we must observe is their life
[10:54] getting more Godly or ungodly if they're
[10:57] allowing more sin in their life Liv then
[11:00] they're clearly guilty of profane and
[11:02] vain babblings so remember people that
[11:04] ask questions about brother brandom it's
[11:06] okay to ask questions if a person is
[11:08] humbly wanting to know but if they're
[11:10] asking endless questions and then their
[11:12] lives are not being cleaned up they're
[11:14] actually being more degraded in sin then
[11:17] you know you don't have to talk to them
[11:19] anymore you don't have to answer their
[11:20] questions anymore cuz we're told to shun
[11:22] them we're told to avoid them and notice
[11:25] all their wicked and vain babblings it
[11:27] eats like a canker and second Timothy
[11:29] 2:17 and then in verse 19 2 Timothy 2:19
[11:33] here's how we know let everyone that
[11:35] nameth the name of Christ depart from
[11:36] iniquity so again the true Servants of
[11:39] God will help people depart from
[11:41] iniquity depart from sin I think now
[11:43] might be a good time to go over those 14
[11:45] Pauline doctrines that most churches
[11:48] reject Paul was against homosexual
[11:50] relationships he was against adulterous
[11:53] relationships he was against fornication
[11:55] he was against murder which of course
[11:58] relates to birth control control today
[12:00] he was against women preachers he was
[12:02] against substance abuse smoking
[12:03] cigarettes drunkenness so forth CU they
[12:06] defile the body the Temple of the Holy
[12:08] Ghost he was against viewing sinful
[12:10] movies and television shows according to
[12:12] 1 Thessalonians 5:22 avoid all
[12:14] appearance of evil Paul was against
[12:16] shameful or repulsive hair lengths 1
[12:19] Corinthians
[12:20] 111-116 he was against false conversions
[12:23] and taught you get the Holy Ghost
[12:24] sometime after you believe not when you
[12:27] believe he was against immodest clothing
[12:30] he taught women to wear modest clothing
[12:32] of course men as well then he taught the
[12:34] water baptism full immersion in water in
[12:37] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he
[12:39] taught Believers to receive the baptism
[12:41] of the Holy Ghost in their souls he
[12:43] taught that the godhead is a mystery
[12:45] Colossians 2:2 but he never taught Jesus
[12:48] was a second person he taught Jesus was
[12:51] the express image of the person of God
[12:54] Hebrews 1:3 Paul never said God was
[12:57] three persons so person who has the holy
[13:00] ghost or is moving towards the baptism
[13:02] of the Holy Ghost in justification and
[13:03] sanctification will strive with all
[13:05] their hearts to obey these commands from
[13:07] St Paul and that's just a short list of
[13:10] commands that lead us unto Holiness all
[13:12] because of the love of God Jesus said if
[13:15] you love me keep my commands the fifth
[13:17] and final passage is 2 Timothy 4: 2-5
[13:21] Paul tells Timothy preach the word
[13:23] exhort with all longsuffering and
[13:25] Doctrine and here's where we are today
[13:26] verse three the time will come when they
[13:28] will not endure sound Doctrine but after
[13:31] their own lust they shall Heap to
[13:33] themselves teachers having itching ears
[13:35] verse four and they shall turn away
[13:37] their ears from the truth and shall be
[13:38] turned unto fables so a lot of people
[13:41] that leave the message they don't want
[13:42] sound Doctrine anymore they don't want
[13:44] those doctrines I just listed there from
[13:46] St Paul and they're turned unto fables
[13:49] madeup stories Fable in the Greek means
[13:52] fiction myth or tales and that's what
[13:55] they spend their time on fables like
[13:57] fables about Jim Jones fables that
[13:59] question brother ROM's marriage
[14:02] relationship questions about the KKK
[14:05] questions about the Freemasons all these
[14:08] false accusations are simply fables Paul
[14:11] says make full proof of thy Ministry and
[14:13] of course if you make full proof of your
[14:15] ministry it's through the word of God
[14:16] the sound Doctrine we see here in this
[14:19] passage those that spend their time on
[14:21] endless questions endless genealogies
[14:24] profane fables they're really living a
[14:27] life of lust see because their teachers
[14:30] allow them to live in their own lust 2
[14:32] Timothy 4:3 Paul also said they're
[14:35] lovers of Pleasures more than lovers of
[14:36] God and these are the people that deny
[14:38] the sound doctrine of the Lord Jesus
[14:41] Christ water baptism the three works of
[14:43] Grace the godhead is one person modest
[14:46] clothing for women and men uncut hair on
[14:49] women all these are backed up by
[14:51] perfecting Holiness in the fear of God
[14:53] as Paul said in 2 Corinthians 7:1
[14:56] perfecting Holiness in the fear of God
[14:59] let us cleanse ourselves let's move on
[15:01] to the final section here accusers of
[15:03] the
[15:04] Brethren friends it's really sad some of
[15:06] these accusers of brother brandham and
[15:08] of course the fful ministry that's still
[15:09] alive today it seems they spend a lot of
[15:11] their free time listening to message
[15:13] preachers and brother brandham just to
[15:15] find fault with brother brandham and the
[15:17] preachers that are Al today think of
[15:19] what sad lives they're living they're
[15:22] fulfilling the scriptures that we just
[15:24] went through from 1 Timothy from second
[15:26] Timothy they're not fulfilling the holy
[15:29] scriptures they're fulfilling the
[15:30] scriptures about vain babblings endless
[15:33] genealogies and their lives are getting
[15:35] increasingly more ungodly this desire to
[15:39] accuse the real Brethren is a critical
[15:41] spirit it's an evil spirit Proverbs
[15:43] 17:20 here's how you know someone has an
[15:46] evil spirit he that hath a frower heart
[15:48] a critical spirit findeth no good so
[15:52] people with critical Spirits find
[15:53] nothing good about the one they're
[15:55] criticizing and then he that hath a
[15:57] perverse tongue Proverbs 7 20 falls into
[16:00] Mischief those people's sins will
[16:01] eventually find them out these people
[16:03] only want to criticize brother brandham
[16:05] and living preachers most of their
[16:07] accusations are false or presumption
[16:10] jumping to false conclusions brother Ram
[16:13] is always Guilty By Association they
[16:15] don't say anything good about brother
[16:16] bram's preaching his teaching his
[16:18] prophecies I have a video with six
[16:20] prophecies that have come to pass from
[16:22] Brother brandham with us sayith the Lord
[16:24] and many of the accusers are either
[16:25] ignorant of it or they just don't know
[16:27] about it the Pharisees and and herodians
[16:29] would only try to catch Jesus in his
[16:31] words to find fault with him Mark 12:13
[16:34] just like the presidents and princes in
[16:36] Daniel's time in Daniel 6:4 they spent
[16:38] all their time trying to find an
[16:40] occasion or fault against Daniel that's
[16:42] the same thing same Spirit people have
[16:44] today trying to accuse brother brandom
[16:46] remember the Bible said in Revelation
[16:48] Satan is the accuser of the Brethren
[16:49] right so a critical spirit is one of
[16:52] Satan's demons that he deceived and
[16:54] anoints people to criticize the true
[16:56] Servants of God one more verse here 2
[16:59] Chronicles
[17:00] 36: 12 and then 15 and 16 zedekiah is
[17:04] king of Israel at this time and the
[17:06] Bible said he did evil in the sight of
[17:08] the Lord he humbled not himself before
[17:10] Jeremiah the prophet speaking from the
[17:13] mouth of the Lord so I'm going to apply
[17:15] this of course to our day people today
[17:17] will not humble themselves to the
[17:18] prophet of God brother William brandham
[17:21] who spoke from the mouth of the Lord
[17:22] when brother Bram said thus sayith the
[17:23] Lord it came to pass and they did the
[17:25] same thing to St Paul in one way the
[17:28] same thing to Timothy they didn't humble
[17:29] themselves to the word of God that Paul
[17:31] had taught Timothy 2 Chronicles 36:15
[17:34] says God sent them the prophets because
[17:36] he had compassion on his people so
[17:38] that's why God sent brother brandom he
[17:40] had compassion on the churches trying to
[17:41] get them to turn and of course all the
[17:44] elect that would be saved fulfilled
[17:46] Revelation 18:4 come out of her my
[17:48] people here's the sad part in verse 16
[17:51] but they mocked The Messengers of God
[17:53] and despise his words and misuse His
[17:55] prophets until the Wrath of the Lord
[17:57] arose against his people till there was
[17:59] no remedy that's what we have today
[18:01] friends many accusers of brother
[18:02] brandham they won't recognize the over
[18:04] 110 differences between the bride and
[18:07] all of their churches I'll leave a link
[18:09] to that video in the description they
[18:11] won't humble themselves to God's
[18:13] teaching on there's one person the
[18:15] godhead women should not cut their hair
[18:17] the Lord Jesus Christ water baptism and
[18:19] so many more they mock brother brandom
[18:21] they despise brother bram's Bible
[18:23] preaching and they misuse brother ROM's
[18:25] Words which means they cheat or they
[18:28] deceive using Brother braham's words
[18:30] they make brother Braham say something
[18:32] he didn't mean they misuse his words
[18:35] I've seen that many times one simple
[18:37] example is on the Jim Jones video and
[18:40] also the false accusation of racism
[18:43] video there's clear examples on those
[18:45] videos if you want to go watch those
[18:46] these accusers of brother brandham they
[18:48] listen to brother brandham and they
[18:49] can't even understand his words because
[18:51] they have cognitive dissonance evil
[18:53] spirits and so they misuse the prophet's
[18:57] words in closing
[19:00] friends I hope this video was a blessing
[19:02] by the grace of God it was refreshing to
