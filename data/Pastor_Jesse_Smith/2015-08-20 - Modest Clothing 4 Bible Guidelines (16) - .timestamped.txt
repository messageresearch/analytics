[0:13] greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:15] of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of
[0:18] this video is to show the four Bible
[0:20] guidelines for modest clothing the
[0:23] clothing you wear is very important to
[0:25] God in the Holy Bible St Paul commanded
[0:29] Christian women in the New Testament to
[0:31] wear modest clothing in 1 Timothy
[0:35] 2:9 in like manner also that women Adorn
[0:38] themselves in modest apparel with
[0:40] shamefacedness and
[0:43] sobriety modest clothing is not a
[0:45] suggestion it is a Bible command for
[0:48] both men and women as we'll see later in
[0:50] this
[0:51] video the dictionary definition of
[0:54] modest can be expressed as not revealing
[0:57] or emphasizing the figure and dress ing
[1:00] to avoid indecency especially to avoid
[1:03] sexual
[1:06] attention to summarize modest clothing
[1:09] that God desires based upon the Bible We
[1:12] Believe Christians today should wear
[1:14] clothes that fully cover the breasts
[1:17] belly loins thighs and legs at all times
[1:22] the breasts belly loins thighs and legs
[1:25] are all body areas considered nakedness
[1:28] in the sight of God according to Isaiah
[1:30] 47 1-3 and Genesis 3: 71 and
[1:39] 21 the four Bible guidelines we will
[1:42] present help ensure that Christians will
[1:45] be modestly dressed covering all
[1:47] nakedness if they obey the Bible's
[1:55] teaching the four Bible
[1:58] guidelines
[2:01] the first Bible guideline is we should
[2:03] wear clothes that cover areas that God
[2:06] considers
[2:07] nakedness the following scriptures teach
[2:10] this guideline Genesis 37 and 21 Isaiah
[2:14] 47: 1
[2:17] through3 the Bible teaches that Adam and
[2:19] Eve were both naked without clothes
[2:22] before sin entered the world as soon as
[2:25] they partook of the forbidden fruit it
[2:27] caused them to sew fig leaves together
[2:29] to to make aprons which were loin
[2:32] coverings the loins refer to the
[2:35] reproductive parts around the area of
[2:37] the hips loins are
[2:40] nakedness in Hebrew the word apron means
[2:43] loin
[2:46] covering Genesis 3:7 and the eyes of
[2:49] them both were opened and they knew that
[2:52] they were naked and they sowed fig
[2:53] leaves together and made themselves
[2:58] aprons but once the voice of God came
[3:00] walking in the garden and acknowledged
[3:02] Adam and Eve's sin God made coats of
[3:05] skins to fully cover more of their
[3:08] nakedness Genesis 3: 21 unto Adam also
[3:12] and to his wife did the Lord God make
[3:14] coats of skins and clothe
[3:17] them we learn that God covered the
[3:20] nakedness of Adam and Eve with more
[3:22] clothing than Adam and Eve have chosen
[3:24] for themselves God's ideas about modesty
[3:27] are always better than man's ideas as we
[3:30] will see God usually asks humans to wear
[3:32] more clothing than they think they need
[3:36] we know this because the word coat means
[3:38] a long shirt-like garment like a tunic
[3:42] that covers from the breast down to
[3:44] nearly the feet Adam and Eve at first
[3:47] chose to cover only the loins the hip
[3:49] area with the reproductive parts but God
[3:52] chose to cover nearly the entire body
[3:55] including the breasts belly or abdomen
[3:58] thighs and legs
[4:00] in Isaiah 47: 1-3 Isaiah told the virgin
[4:05] daughter of Babylon or the people in the
[4:07] city of Babylon that God would allow
[4:09] their nakedness to be uncovered which
[4:11] included bare legs and uncovered thighs
[4:15] legs and thighs are
[4:19] nakedness so we learn from God's holy
[4:22] word that men and women should cover
[4:24] their breasts belly or abdomen loins
[4:27] thighs and legs with clothes
[4:30] because any of these body areas left
[4:32] uncovered are nakedness in the eyes of
[4:35] God the second Bible guideline is wear
[4:39] one layer of thick clothing material or
[4:42] wear multiple layers of clothing the
[4:44] following scriptures teach this
[4:46] guideline Genesis 3:21 Matthew 5:40 and
[4:50] John
[4:54] 21:7 in Genesis 3: 21 we learn that God
[4:58] clothed Adam and Eve with coats of skins
[5:01] these skins were probably lamb skins
[5:03] because we believe the first animal
[5:05] sacrifices on Earth which were done by
[5:07] God himself would have most likely been
[5:10] Lambs as a foreshadowing of the
[5:12] crucifixion of Jesus Christ who is the
[5:14] Lamb of God who takes away the sin of
[5:17] the world according to John 1:
[5:20] 29 lambskin clothing would be very thick
[5:24] this clothing would not reveal the form
[5:26] of the body making it very modest
[5:28] clothing an easy example of the
[5:30] thickness of this type of clothing is to
[5:33] picture in your mind shearling or sheep
[5:35] skin boots God wanted thick clothing
[5:37] that did not reveal the form of the
[5:40] body as you read later in the Bible you
[5:42] will find Jesus talking about layers of
[5:44] clothing in Matthew 5:40 as he spoke
[5:48] about coats and
[5:50] cloaks Matthew 5:40 shows that God
[5:54] desired either one thick layer of
[5:55] clothing or multiple layers of thin
[5:58] clothing probably to accommodate the
[6:00] different weather patterns on the earth
[6:03] the Greek word for coat means a tunic an
[6:06] undergarment usually worn next to the
[6:09] skin the coats Jesus spoke of were thin
[6:12] shirt-like garments like tunics worn
[6:15] next to the skin these coats were the
[6:17] undergarment layer like underwear today
[6:20] but with much more cloth or material
[6:22] than our modern day underwear because it
[6:24] was like a very long
[6:27] t-shirt the cloak was the outer garment
[6:29] or outside garment worn on top of the
[6:32] tunic or coat
[6:34] undergarment another word for cloak is
[6:36] robe which is like the Scarlet robe the
[6:38] Roman soldiers put on Jesus in Matthew
[6:41] 27:28 this robe or cloak was an outer
[6:44] garment usually worn over the tunic the
[6:47] Greek word for cloak means the upper
[6:49] garment the cloak or
[6:51] mantle it is important to note here that
[6:54] God considered a person to be naked when
[6:56] they took off their outer garment or
[6:58] their cloak or Robee
[7:00] if the outer garment was taken off then
[7:01] the person would be viewed in only their
[7:03] thin undergarment clothing this
[7:06] guideline is seen in numerous places in
[7:08] the Bible but most easily seen in John
[7:13] 21:7 therefore that disciple whom Jesus
[7:16] loves saith unto Peter it is the Lord
[7:19] now when Simon Peter heard that it was
[7:20] the Lord he GED his father's coat unto
[7:23] him for he was naked and did cast
[7:25] himself into the
[7:28] sea
[7:30] the Greek word for coat means an upper
[7:32] garment a frock which fishermen use to
[7:35] wear at their work the Greek word for
[7:38] naked means clad in undergarments only
[7:42] the outer garments or cloak being laid
[7:44] aside notice that Peter had his outer
[7:47] garment off the Fisher's coat and the
[7:50] Bible recorded Peter as being naked the
[7:53] way to apply this today is for us to be
[7:55] sure we have at least two layers of
[7:57] clothing on or have one thick layer of
[8:00] clothing on and abstain from walking
[8:02] around in our underwear in
[8:04] public this would include not walking
[8:06] around in public or even appearing in
[8:09] public beaches in bathing suits as most
[8:12] bathing suits and shorts only have one
[8:14] layer of thin clothing which is
[8:16] certainly immodest according to the
[8:18] Bible swimsuits almost always reveal the
[8:21] form of the body which is immodest and
[8:23] almost always expose areas of the body
[8:26] that God considers
[8:28] nakedness
[8:29] the third Bible guideline is wear
[8:32] clothing that pertains to your gender if
[8:35] you're a man you should wear men's
[8:37] clothing if you're a woman you should
[8:38] wear women's clothing the following
[8:41] scriptures teach on this guideline
[8:43] Deuteronomy 22:5 and Hebrews
[8:48] 4:15 the woman shall not wear that which
[8:51] pertaineth unto a man neither shall a
[8:53] man put on a woman's garment for all
[8:56] though that do so are an Abomination
[8:58] unto the Lord thy God
[9:00] God this is an Old Testament scripture
[9:03] but you must recall that Jesus never
[9:05] crossdressed like a woman we come to
[9:07] this conclusion because the Bible
[9:09] teaches Jesus never broke one
[9:11] commandment in the Old Testament and
[9:13] crossdressing was strictly forbidden in
[9:15] the law of Moses in the Old
[9:18] Testament for we have not an high priest
[9:20] which cannot be touched with the feeling
[9:22] of our infirmities but was in all points
[9:24] tempted like as we are yet without
[9:28] sin furthermore this means Jesus
[9:30] instituted the New Testament and the
[9:33] kingdom of God upon this Earth while
[9:36] upholding the truth that men and women
[9:38] should dress different with separate
[9:40] clothing separate clothing for men and
[9:42] women is a teaching we must follow in
[9:44] the New Testament because Jesus modeled
[9:47] and lived this standard before us when
[9:49] he brought out the New
[9:51] Testament these scriptures prove that
[9:53] God-fearing obedient Jewish men and
[9:56] women had separate inner and outer
[9:58] garments in the day days of Jesus Jesus
[10:00] was one of those God-fearing obedient
[10:03] followers of the law of
[10:05] Moses in the days of Jesus men and women
[10:08] could be easily differentiated visually
[10:11] just by looking at their outer clothing
[10:13] this is the way God wanted his Society
[10:15] to operate a society with defined
[10:18] god-given roles easily determined by
[10:21] gender and outer
[10:24] clothing when gender and clothing
[10:27] becomes hard to determine a state of
[10:29] confusion occurs which is a state of
[10:31] Babel and God is not the author of
[10:33] confusion according to 1 Corinthians
[10:37] 14:33 in society today we believe men
[10:40] should wear shirts and pants and women
[10:42] should wear long dresses or blouses and
[10:45] long
[10:52] skirts today's American society is
[10:55] quickly becoming a complete and total
[10:57] perversion of God God's standard for
[10:59] separate clothing for the entire history
[11:02] of our country the majority of men and
[11:04] women obeyed the Bible guideline of
[11:06] separate clothing for men and
[11:09] women it wasn't until the 1970s that it
[11:13] became socially acceptable for women to
[11:15] wear
[11:20] pants please watch the video long
[11:22] dresses in the Bible for an in-depth
[11:24] study into these
[11:27] facts the fourth and final Bible
[11:30] guideline is we should wear clothes on
[11:33] earth like Jesus wears in heaven which
[11:36] are loose long and flowing
[11:39] clothes the following scriptures that
[11:42] teach this guideline are Revelation 13
[11:45] Revelation 79 and14 and Luke
[11:51] 11:2 in Revelation chapter 1: 13 St John
[11:55] the disciple whom Jesus loved saw a
[11:57] vision of Jesus in his glorified body as
[12:00] Supreme deity Jesus was clothed in a
[12:03] garment down to the
[12:06] foot and in the midst of the seven
[12:08] candlesticks one like unto the son of
[12:10] man clothed with a garment down to the
[12:12] foot and gir about the paps with a
[12:15] golden
[12:16] girdle notice that Jesus was not showing
[12:19] off toned muscular arms abs legs and
[12:23] thighs like many people do today he was
[12:26] not showing off any body part Jesus was
[12:29] clothed in a modest
[12:31] way if Jesus Christ chooses to gladly
[12:34] wear modest clothing in heaven that
[12:36] covers his body all the way down to his
[12:38] ankles then we want to lovingly follow
[12:40] his example here on Earth and wear
[12:43] clothes down to our feet
[12:46] today Jesus taught us to pray and say
[12:49] let it be done on Earth as it is in
[12:51] heaven when we wear modest clothes that
[12:54] cover our bodies even down to our ankles
[12:57] we are letting the clothing style of
[12:58] Heaven come down to
[13:03] earth Jesus is the great Shepherd
[13:06] according to Hebrews 13: 20 he leads the
[13:09] way for the sheep to follow Jesus as a
[13:12] man models complete modesty and Holiness
[13:15] in the clothing he wears this means that
[13:18] all men and women today should follow in
[13:20] the example Jesus left and we modest
[13:23] clothing at all times in our opinion
[13:27] that's the real Measure of a Man he
[13:29] leads the way for modesty for Holiness
[13:32] in every aspect of his life he does not
[13:34] ask the women to do something that he
[13:36] does not do
[13:37] himself if we read further in the Book
[13:40] of Revelation we find that all
[13:42] Christians that are washed in the blood
[13:43] of Jesus will wear white robes in heaven
[13:46] and these robes extend to the feet and I
[13:49] said unto him sir thou knowest and he
[13:52] said to me these are they which came out
[13:54] of Great Tribulation and have washed
[13:56] their robes and made them white in in
[13:58] the blood of the
[14:00] Lamb if we are going to spend all
[14:02] eternity with modest robes that cover
[14:05] our bodies according to the command and
[14:08] design of God himself then we're happy
[14:10] to start wearing the same type of modest
[14:12] clothing right
[14:14] now the Greek word for robes means a
[14:17] loose outer garment for men extending to
[14:20] the
[14:21] feet so this scripture provides yet
[14:23] another witness that we must seek to
[14:25] cover as much of our bodies as possible
[14:28] whether we are male or
[14:30] female in closing we pray that your
[14:33] prayer will be something like this Lord
[14:36] help me to dress modestly since it is
[14:38] your New Testament Bible command forgive
[14:41] me of dressing immodestly I want to
[14:43] change my life completely I want to
[14:45] please you in everything making my body
[14:48] a living sacrifice for you perfecting
[14:50] Holiness in the fear of God I love you
[14:53] dear Jesus and I know that without
[14:55] Holiness no man shall see you because
[14:57] you're the Lord
[14:59] I want your Bible to be my guideline for
[15:01] how I dress I will not look to Hollywood
[15:04] or anyone else for my standard I will
[15:06] look to Jesus and his example as taught
[15:09] through the Holy
[15:10] Bible if you would like more Bible
[15:12] teaching about modest clothing and also
[15:15] more historical references about the
[15:17] changes in clothing in the United States
[15:19] please contact
[15:24] us God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[15:27] the desire of your
[15:28] [Music]
[15:40] heart
