TRANSCRIPT
========================================
chapter 12 the mystery of the rapture chapter 12 contains footnotes numbers 1793-1897 behold i show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptable and we shall be changed first corinthians 15 verses 51 and 52 it is only fitting that the final mystery is the rapture of jesus christ bride the new testament church because the rapture will be the final event of the times of the gentiles immediately after the rapture of the gentile bride god will graft israel back into the holy tree and send her the two prophets mentioned in revelation 11 verses 3 through 13. the rapture is the unknown day and hour jesus christ secretly and physically comes back to earth christ will stop in the air not touching the sin soaked earth to eagerly receive his bride for their wedding day before returning to heaven with her for the wedding reception the marriage supper the lamb as recorded in the epigraph paul specifically calls this event a mystery thankfully the bible promised that all the mysteries of god including the rapture mystery would be revealed in the end times revelation 10 verse 7 says the mystery of god would be finished or revealed and then the revelation would be taken and prophesied before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings god is currently fulfilling this prophecy by anointing and sending apostles and evangelists to prophesy again all the revelations of the new testament mysteries the word rapture is not in the king james bible but many christians use it because it gives us a common term referring to this momentous future event however the bible also gives other names for the rapture the caught up meeting or the first resurrection some may argue that christians should not use the word rapture because like the trinity it is not found in the bible the difference is that the definition of the rapture is fully scriptural while the definition of the trinity god in three persons is completely absent from god's word it's completely acceptable to use the term rapture the holy spirit will perform six raptures with four already occurring and two upcoming enoch in genesis 5 24 elijah in second kings 2 verse 11 jesus ascending to the father alone in john 20 17. jesus ascending with the old testament saints leading captivity captive to heaven in mark 16 verse 19 and ephesians 4 verse 8 the gentile bride rapture first thessalonians 4 verses 15-17 and the rapture of the two witnesses in revelation 11 verses 11 and 12. the confusion about the rapture the confusion about the rapture centers around when it will occur bible students believe the rapture will take place in one of three different future times centering around the major event of the great tribulation will the rapture take place before during or after the great tribulation the revelation of the rapture mystery is jesus uses a shout voice and trump to secretly and suddenly snatch away his holy spirit filled bride off the earth as the last climatic culminating event of the times of the gentiles before the wrathful tribulation a fourth and smaller group believes the rapture has already taken place thankfully we can know surely that the rapture has not yet happened and is a future event paul's last letter before his martyrdom condemned those who said the rapture or resurrection was passed already saying their false doctrine was overthrowing the faith of some the apostle also wrote to titus saying that christians should deny worldly lusts in this present world looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great god and our savior jesus christ the rapture is the future event all christians are still looking for 2 000 years later the appearing of our lord jesus christ in the air there is also confusion about who will be in the rapture is it for everyone on earth all those who call themselves christians or just a small faithful spirit-filled remnant of christians biblical proof for the revelation about the rapture to begin with the bible defines the rapture mystery as the caught up experience paul teaches about in first corinthians 15 verses 51-54 and first thessalonians 4 verses 15-18 respectively behold i show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed for this corruptible must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality so when this corruptible shall put on incorruption and this mortal shall put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in victory for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord wherefore comfort one another with these words the question as to who will be in the rapture can now be answered these texts teach two groups of christians will have their bodies changed at the moment of the rapture so they can be caught up to meet jesus in the air the dead in christ and the living christians the dead in christ are the holy ghost-filled christians who have died over the past 2000 years this group will be resurrected in immortal bodies first as paul says the dead shall be raised incorruptible and shall rise first john correctly describes the rapture as the first resurrection because the dead in christ are being resurrected the living christians the second group will be changed from mortal bodies to immortal and will be like enoch and elijah who never had to taste death paul says their mortal bodies will be swallowed up in victory this group of christians which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord receive the oil of the baptism of the holy ghost or eternal life during their lives being called wise virgins by jesus christ in matthew 25 verses 1 through 13. the rest of the entire world population who denied christ as unbelievers along with those foolish virgin christians who did not receive the oil or baptism of the holy ghost will have to die during the tribulation period or the battle of armageddon and will miss the one thousand-year millennial reign with christ the foolish virgins missed the millennium because they foolishly chose to live lives void of the holy ghost baptism on earth being unfit to rule and reign with christ revelation 20 verse 5 explains the rest of the dead live not again until the thousand years were finished the bodies of the rest of the world population and foolish virgin christians will remain in the graves according to jesus and will be resurrected for their day of judgment at the great white throne which is called the second resurrection detailed in matthew 25 verses 31-46 and revelation 20 verses 11-15 the souls of the foolish virgin likely go to a heavenly dimension to peacefully wait for the second resurrection just like the faithful yet blinded to christ jews who had a heavenly waiting place under the altar of god in heaven according to the fifth seal of revelation 6 verses 9-11 the souls of unbelievers will undoubtedly go down to the heart of the earth hell's prison house to await judgment it's crucial to understand how the greek word for caught up in first thessalonians 4 17 supports a pre-tribulation rapture in the greek lexicon caught up is harpazo meaning to seize carry off by force to seize on claim for oneself eagerly to snatch out or away the rapture is jesus eagerly seizing or snatching away his bride his wife so that he may take these christians to heaven or the father's kingdom with him for a wedding in the sky followed by a marriage supper simultaneously the inhabitants of the earth are being judged and tormented for their sins in the tribulation for rejecting the gospel six reasons the rapture is pre-tribulation six reasons prove the rapture is before the great tribulation not during nor afterwards reason number one the great tribulation is described as trouble for israel the foolish virgins and sinners but not for the holy ghost-filled christians the spirit sealed christians are already washed in the blood of jesus christ and are not in need of purifying purging or trouble during the great tribulation daniel 12 1 and jeremiah 30 verse 7 refer to the season of unparalleled trouble by similar names time of trouble and jacob's trouble both clearly reference israel the foolish virgins or christians without the baptism of the holy ghost will experience some degree of trouble in the tribulation because two of jesus's parables describe it first jesus describes these foolish christians as being locked out obvious trouble of the marriage in matthew 25 verses 10 through 12. this corresponds to missing the marriage supper in heaven mentioned revelation 19 verse 7 despite living virgin or pure lives because they had no oil or the holy ghost baptism another parable from christ in matthew 22 verses 10 through 13 describes those without the wedding garment which represents the holy ghost baptism cast into outer darkness with weeping and gnashing of teeth notice god's repeating pattern that despite making great human effort to be part of the supper or rapture only those who are born again of the holy ghost will qualify for this holy gathering sinners will face the worst trouble during the great tribulation for god is going to execute judgment upon all and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against jesus christ and his bride reason number two there is no mention of christ bride or church in the tribulation texts in the book of revelation the word church appears 19 times in revelation but is absent from chapter 3 verse 22 to chapter 22 verse 16. the reason christ bride or wife is not mentioned during the great tribulation taking place on the earth is because she will be with jesus at the heavenly marriage supper of the lamb christ will rapture his bride at the end of the laodicean church age see chapter 7 and the next time she is seen near earth is when she returns to the earth from heaven with jesus christ for the battle of armageddon in revelation 19 verses 5 through 21 which takes place at the very end of the great tribulation the true church is not mentioned in revelation chapter 8 during the first four trumpets nor in revelation chapter 9 in the fifth and sixth trumpets and when the first woe passes revelation chapter 10 deals with the completion of the gentile bride's great commission so it's not a tribulation text when the second will passes in revelation 11 the bride is still not mentioned israel is the theme of revelation 12 and doesn't deal with jesus jesus's gentile bride in revelation 13 you see the beast's transition to papal rome her influence in the united states and her war with the jewish saints in the tribulation but there's no mention of jesus's church during the final harvest of the 144 thousand israeli believers in revelation 14 there is again no mention of the bride of christ jesus's wife is not mentioned in revelation chapter 15 and 16 when the seven last plagues and seven vials are poured out upon the earth revelation chapters 17 and 18 reveal mystery babylon's union with earth's kings as well as her day of destruction in the tribulation some wrongly point to revelation 14 verses 6 through 10 and revelation 16 verse 15 to prove jesus's bride goes through the tribulation these scriptures are simply warnings for jesus church to be rapture ready as she reads through the book of revelation during the 2000 year time period of the times of the gentiles before the tribulation revelation 18 verse 4 is another plea for bible readers to come out of babylon before it's too late reason number three the bride or true church is specifically promised a pardon from god's divine wrath the following seven scriptures speak of god's gracious promise beginning with paul's two records of pardon in context directly after the caught up description from first thessalonians but ye brethren are not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a thief first thessalonians 5 verse 4 for god hath not appointed us to wrath but to obtain salvation by our lord jesus christ first thessalonians 5 verse 9 and to wait for his son from heaven whom he raised from the dead even jesus which delivered us from the wrath to come first thessalonians 1 verse 10 much more than being now justified by his blood we shall be saved from wrath through him romans 5 verse 9 because thou has kept the word of my patience i will also keep thee from the hour of temptation which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the earth revelation 3 verse 10 watch ye therefore and pray always that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass and to stand before the son of man luke 21 36 for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up upon a rock psalm 27 verse 5. in the seventh scripture take notice that david mentions being hidden from trouble so this prophecy can only pertain to the bride of christ for the three other groups specifically israel in daniel 12 1 endure trouble during the great tribulation the word wrath is used 13 times in revelation and refers to god's wrath upon the religious system of mystery babylon and those who align themselves with her during the tribulation the final mention of wrath in revelation 19 15 is jesus treading out god's wrath against satan and the ungodly at armageddon consider christ's affection for his wife the new testament bride and compare it with a natural husband preparing to marry his wife would a loving husband purposely allow his espoused wife to endure his wrath before their wedding no a godly husband would have no wrath towards his future wife because she has already found favor in his sight on the contrary he would do everything in his power to keep his wife from wrath and suffering how much more will jesus christ keep his espoused wife from his wrath listen to scripture's testimony about jesus's wife she's a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing bride members are blameless and harmless without rebuke jesus blood has forgiven all her trespasses christ's wife has no condemnation and no man shall lay anything to the charge of god's elect for it is god that justifieth undoubtedly jesus christ will not allow his wife to endure his wrath because she is the wife of his choosing already justified in his eyes revelation 3 verse 10 and chapter 13 verses 16 and 17 seem to suggest that the true church will experience a great trial just before the rapture but surely this will be a light affliction compared to the divine wrath reserved for the wicked jesus promised christians would be kept from living through the worldwide mark of the beast temptation called the hour of temptation in revelation 3 verse 10. it seems inevitable that true believers will feel some of the mounting political ecclesiastical and financial pressure moments before revelation 13 verses 16 and 17 is fulfilled and he calls us all both small and great rich and poor free and bond to receive a mark in their right hand or in their foreheads and that no man might buy or sell save he that had the mark or the name of the beast or the number of his name but just as one in the form like the son of god speedily stepped into the fiery furnace milliseconds before the three hebrew children were burned so will the true son of god snatch us away his bride the church moments before the tribulation is unleashed reason number four the bride or true church is foreshadowed to receive a pardon from god's divine wrath three historical old testament events and two of jesus's parables foreshadow the bride's pardon from divine wrath enoch whose name means dedicated in hebrew foreshadowed the true church because he was raptured not tasting death and enoch walked with god and he was not for god took him being the seventh generation from adam enoch typed the current seventh gentile church age the laodicean age which will escape the wrath of the tribulation noah the tenth generation from adam was spared from the wrath of god because he found grace in god's sight ii peter 2 verse 5 says noah was a preacher of righteousness and was spared from the worldwide destruction of the flood jesus validated that the end times would resemble noah's day in matthew 24 verses 37-39 and luke 17 verses 26 and 27 thus noah types the foolish virgin group of christians who miss the enoch-like rapture before judgment and thereby experience the great temptation to take the mark of the beast revelation 13 verses 15-17 seems to point to all foolish virgins being martyred due to their rejection of the mark of the beast their deaths would mean being spared from the wrath of the seven trumpets seven vows and three woes righteous lot nephew of abraham was spared from god's wrath poured out on sodom and gomorrah in genesis 19 verses 1-29 abraham's merciful intercession for lot and all righteous people in the wicked cities was remembered by god and proved he would not destroy the righteous with the wicked lot like noah types the foolish virgin group of christians who will not be raptured but will escape the indescribable wrath of the trumpets vows and three woes herein we see god's faithful principle he will not destroy the righteous with the wicked the two kinds of believers holy and righteous always escape god's wrath upon the wicked as jesus's sower and the foreground's parable denotes continuing on lot's story jesus said his second coming would occur when world conditions resembled the days of lot in luke 17 verses 28-30 we are living in a modern sodom as the growing global acceptance of homosexuality and the lgbt movement shows the fulfillment of jesus's prophetic words jesus is the king's son parable in matthew 22 verses 1 through 14 foreshadows true christians escaping god's wrath christ tells of a king making a marriage for his son typing god the father preparing the true church for their marriage to his son jesus christ at the caught up rapture when the king came in to see the guests gathered for the wedding he found a man that did not have the wedding garment he was bound and cast into outer darkness where there was weeping and gnashing of teeth outer darkness symbolizes the great tribulation since the wedding represents the rapture wedding garments represent the spiritual power or clothing from on high of the holy ghost baptism because endude means clothed with any person who's not born again of god's spirit will not partake of jesus christ's wedding and will have to give his life by denying the mark of the beast in the tribulation jesus tells a second parable about a wedding or the future rapture in matthew 25 verses 1-13 two groups of virgins hear the cry to attend the wedding but only one group has the oil or the baptism of the holy ghost as described in zechariah 4 verses 1-6 wise virgins have oil meaning they are born again foolish virgins have no oil and are therefore shut out of the marriage rapture those shut out of the rapture will endure the tribulation being forced to give up their lives rather than take the mark of the beast reason number five jesus and paul taught the rapture was imminent at an unknown day as an approaching thief while other views can number or count to the day jesus taught this truth on four occasions and paul twice first jesus says but of that day and hour knoweth no man no not the angels of heaven but my father only later in the same chapter christ says but know this that if the good man of the house had known in what watch the thief would come he would have watched and would not have suffered his house to be broken up therefore be also ready for in such an hour as you think not the son of man cometh the third reference is in the succeeding chapter when our lord says watch therefore for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the son of man cometh revelation 3 verse 3 is the fourth witness as jesus says remember therefore how thou hast received and heard and hold fast and repent if therefore thou shalt not watch i will come on thee as a thief and thou shalt not know what hour i will come upon thee in first thessalonians 5 verses 2 through 4 paul twice describes christ's coming as a thief saying christians will escape the great tribulations sudden secret destruction time for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the lord so cometh as a thief in the night for when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not escape but ye brethren are not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a thief the two other erroneous views and timelines of the rapture mid-tribulation and post-tribulation could potentially calculate the day of christ coming mid-tribulation supporters could count three and a half years or 1260 days after israel's two prophets appear and calculate the day they believe jesus will return likewise post-tribulation supporters could count seven years or 2520 days after the two prophets appear and pinpoint the day of christ's return the pre-tribulation rapture is the only teaching that allows christ to return at an unknown day and hour before the worldwide great tribulation the rapture must remain a secret for two reasons first satan could do great damage if he knew the timing of jesus second coming the rapture satan and a third of his angels did awful damage at jesus's first coming when they anointed herod and his soldiers to slay all the children that were in bethlehem and in all the coasts thereof from 2 years old and under what type of killing spree would satan inspire if he knew jesus was going to come and take away his people this year or the next second a secret rapture reveals both good and evil hearts according to jesus christ's parable in matthew 24 verses 45-51 a good-hearted faithful and wise servant will be ready for the rapture while serving spiritual meat in due season to his fellow servants the evil servant will behave as though the rapture is delayed smiting his fellow servants in his drunken state peter explains that love motivates true christians to endure trials of faith in anticipation of jesus's appearance reason number six the rapture is removal of the grace of god for gentiles in preparation for the antichrist public revelation and god's return to the jewish people gentiles are now receiving salvation by the grace of god and will retain this privilege until the fullness of the gentiles become in god has blinded israel from recognizing christ as their messiah that we the gentiles might know christ and be saved jesus defines this current time period as the times of the gentiles in luke 21 24. once the last gentile christian has come in been saved and sealed by the holy ghost into the kingdom of god the rest of the unbelieving gentiles will be cut off from the mercy of god and israel be grafted back into fellowship with god their own olive tree in 2 thessalonians 2 verses 2 through 13 paul labels the person of the antichrist as the man of sin and son of perdition who has not yet been revealed but will be revealed after a great falling away or apostasy occurs by churches as apostasy increases verses 7 and 8 further declares the antichrist will be revealed after god takes his holy spirit out of the way the rapture is god taking holy spirit-filled christians out of the antichrist way to jerusalem where he will sit in the jewish temple of god showing himself that he is god christians need not fear the apostasy movement nor the antichrist paul identifies their characteristics declaring they will exalt themselves above god's word not love the truth of god's word have pleasure in doing unrighteous acts and believe lies if you believe god's word is truth love the truth and do righteousness god's grace will remove you from the earth in the rapture before the antichrist is revealed god's perfect love casts out all fear about the antichrist's appearance the conditions or times and seasons of the rapture having proved the rapture's pre-tribulation god's grace has also revealed even more about the world's conditions at the time of the rapture jesus clearly taught the rapture takes place at an unknown day and hour but many people fail to recognize paul's bold claim that christians will know the times and seasons of jesus's coming immediately after teaching on the caught up event in 1st thessalonians chapter 4 paul follows up in the proceeding chapter by assuring christians they'll be ready for jesus's return but of the times and the seasons brethren ye have no need that i write unto you for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the lord so cometh as a thief in the night for when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not escape but ye brethren are not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a thief ye are all the children of light and the children of the day we are not of the night nor of darkness therefore let us not sleep as others do but let us watch and be sober for they that sleep sleep in the night and they that be drunk and are drunken in the night but let us who are of the day be sober putting on the breastplate of faith and love and foreign helmet the hope of salvation for god hath not appointed us to wrath but to obtain salvation by our lord jesus christ who died for us that whether we wake or sleep we should live together with him the apostle describes the times and seasons of the rapture with two descriptors first sinners will be unaware of the rapture just as drunken sleeping robbery victims are caught off guard by a nighttime thief jesus teaches the same idea when he likens the day of the lord as the days of noah in which the lost kept eating drinking and marrying right up until the flood came and took them all away paul compares the sinners to sleeping drunks second paul proclaims the world's mantra will be peace and safety at the time of christ's sudden rapture event it's striking to imagine how contrary the thoughts and plans of sinners will be compared to those of god as god is planning worldwide war armageddon and destruction with earth's sinless holy restoration in mind the world is planning albeit in vain world peace and safety are christians living in a world that matches these descriptions partially no doubt and each day we're closer to seeing the full rapture conditions building upon these two descriptions the bible provides further proofs that we are near the time and season of jesus's return scoffers will be mocking jesus's second coming second peter 3 verses 3 and 4. the conditions of noah's time will be repeated violence lust-based marriages continually evil thoughts luke 17 verses 26 through 30 genesis 6 1-13 the sodomite conditions of lot's time will be repeated luke 17 verses 28-30 evil men and deceivers will grow more evil with greater deceptions second timothy 3 13. many churches will commit a great falling away from god's truth second thessalonians 2 verse 3. few will have genuine faith expressed through regular prayer luke 18 verses 1 through 8. pestilences swine flu coronavirus etc and earthquakes will increase as sorrows before the tribulation matthew 24 verses 7 and 8 men will love themselves more than god and be covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful unholy without natural affection truce breakers false accusers incontinent fierce despisers of those that are good traitors heady high-minded and having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof second timothy 3 verses 1-7 the new testament gospel will have been preached to all the world matthew 24 14. through unified efforts of false churches and politicians new laws will stop true churches from preaching and pressure them to join the evil ecumenical move but jesus anoints with the latter rain and rescues them in the rapture psalm 27 verse 5 revelation 3 verse 10 revelation 13 verse 16 israelis will be physically returning to live in the holy land and seeking to rebuild a new temple deuteronomy 30 verses 1 through 10 luke 21 24 revelation 11 verses 1 and 2. nominal churches will be in a laodicean lukewarm condition concerned with riches and goods having no need of more truth and unwilling to repent revelation 3 verses 15-19 fully armored in the rapture season paul says a christian's only hope for being spiritually awake and soberly watching for christ's return is by putting on the full armor of god in 1st thessalonians chapter 5 paul describes two of the six pieces of armor fully detailed in ephesians 6 verses 10 through 18. it behooves christians to understand and put on each piece of armor that we may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand here's a brief summary of your spiritual armor breastplate of faith love and righteousness first thessalonians 5 verse 8 ephesians 6 14 a physical breastplate protects the heart and other vital organs from the chest down to the waist just as a righteous obedient christian life of integrity protects our heart from satan's attacks on our character christians trust in christ's righteousness imputed to us and not our own helmet of salvation first thessalonians 5 verse 8 ephesians 6 verse 17 a physical helmet protects the head the command center and most complex organ in the human body just as the hope of salvation the assurance that we are saved and forgiven by jesus's sacrifice protects us from satan's attempts to make us doubt our salvation jesus's helmet makes us victorious in the battlefield of the mind the greatest battle ever fought as we cast down every imagination that exalts itself against the word of god loins gird about with truth ephesians 6 14. girded loins meant a man could tuck his long flowing robe into his belt enabling him to travel run or work in the same way a christian's mind is gird up in bible truth calmly prepared to be victorious in spiritual mind battles and successful in his ministry's work feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace ephesians 6 15 soldiers feet and lower legs were protected by sandals and greaves to ensure their protection in traveling or war in the same way the christian's daily travels and decisions are made only after prayerful preparation produces god's peace in his heart shield of faith ephesians 6 verse 16 just as a soldier's shield protected all the aforementioned pieces of armor from fiery arrows faith in christ completely protects a christian's armor by extinguishing or stifling every falsehood satan shoots from the bow of his lying tongue sword of the spirit ephesians 6 verse 17 just as a soldier's sword was his main offensive and lethal weapon the word of god spoken through a christian's mouth will resist wound even bruise the devil eventually putting to flight his evil forces jesus used the spoken word three times during satan's temptation in the wilderness causing the devil to flee him for a season at christ's physical return to the earth after the great tribulation a sword of judgment comes from his mouth smiting all his enemies it is no wonder paul admonishes us to be alert soldiers of the daytime if we want to go to heaven in the rapture if you want to be ready for the rapture you must be willing to fight for this privilege god's most successful soldier jesus christ says the kingdom of god is experienced when soldiers take it by force amazingly the greek word for force is the same word paul uses for caught up meaning christians must actively snatch away their spiritual victories from satan as jesus is going to snatch away his bride from satan's great tribulation satan the god of this world system has laid many traps and snares around us the devil's angels have been and will continually be sent to war against our cause but we are fully equipped and more than conquerors fighting the good fight of faith with our divine armor where will the rapture take place the rapture will be a universal event meaning it will take place on a global scale and believers will not have to be in one physical location in order to be part of the rapture in matthew 24 verses 23 23-28 jesus plainly teaches us not to be deceived by men who claim to be christ and call us out to the desert or secret chambers christ's coming will be as fast as lightning in a moment in the twinkling of an eye so there is no need to gather physically for the exact moment of the rapture at the precise moment of the rapture wise virgin christians might be working or sleeping in their beds on the other side of the world according to christ's teachings in luke 17 verses 34 through 36 and matthew 24 verses 40 through 42 jesus says i tell you in that night there shall be two men in one bed the one shall be taken and the other shall be left two women shall be grinding together the one shall be taken and the other left two men shall be in the field the one shall be taken and the other left you are admonished to be ready watching for christ's return whether you are sleeping or working let us pray sincerely before bed and before the work day begins each morning for our savior is coming back as quick as lightning it will not matter where a true believer is physically located at the moment of the rapture as long as he possesses the oil or the wedding garment of the baptism of the holy ghost wise virgins will be ready for the rapture and jesus will call them to the air to meet the rest of the saints in the sky don't miss this there is one spiritual location not physical a christian must be concerned about for the rapture for a true christian must be located in christ according to romans 8 verse 1 there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit believers are spiritually in christ when christ is in them by the baptism of the holy ghost according to colossians 1 verse 27 to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory galatians 3 27 says christians have been baptized into christ meeting christ's direct command to be baptized with the holy ghost paul announces that if the holy spirit that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you jesus foretold his disciples about his desire to dwell in them by his spirit in john 14 17 saying even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwelt with you and shall be in you a few verses later in john 14 20 messiah revealed a most glorious truth about those he would dwell in he revealed that those believers were already in him in his mind and plan before the foundation of the world at that day ye shall know that i am in my father and ye and me and i in you paul elaborates on this fact teaching according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love praise god for the revelation of where christians need to be for the rapture we must be in christ meaning that christ's spirit is dwelling in our souls by the baptism of the holy ghost jesus does though give us a clue about where christians will be frequently gathering physically as the rapture draws closer matthew 24 28 says holy ghost-filled christians will be gathered together like eagles feasting on a carcass representing constant increasing church attendance in which believers feast on the preaching of god's word paul validates that five preaching gifts will perfect edify and bring total unity to the body of christ god likens himself to an eagle and so we as his children must be eaglets just as eagles are carnivores christians feast on the meat or deeply spiritual insights that help us to discern good and evil in our daily lives believers cannot remain on a milk diet and expect to go in the rapture just as eagles cannot expect to soar in the heavens without a steady meat diet why will the rapture occur the caught up rapture occurs because christ is snatching away his wife from the earth rescuing her from the awful wrath of god meant to purge the earth before the millennium our lord says because thou has kept the word of my patience i will also keep thee from the hour of temptation which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the earth what amazing grace christ offers us being now justified by his blood we shall be saved from wrath through him according to john 14 verses 1 through 3 christ desires to be married with his eternal companion the holy separated many-membered bride church christ wants to receive his people his bride unto himself and take her to the place he has prepared for her to live eternally as pilgrims and strangers on this earth the holy ghost-filled bride shares the same desires as her husband and wants to leave this world to be with christ just as paul desired to depart and to be with christ the rapture is the moment we shall ever be with the lord because we were ready to go in with him to the marriage truly the lamb's wife is blessed to be able to make herself ready for her marriage to christ god's rich marvelous and long-suffering grace gives every man and woman opportunity to repent before the rapture the perfectly just and fair savior offers space to repent to every generation even as christ announced to the gentile city of thyrotira in revelation 2 verse 21 and i gave her space to repent of her fornication and she repented not nearly 4 000 years ago god's grace was equally offered to the amorites possessors of canaan in abraham's lifetime the lord told abraham he would give the amorites a space of 400 years to repent until their iniquity would be full of course the omniscient god knew the amorites would not repent and thus ordained for joshua to lead israel into canaan as a possession for abraham's seed today god's grace is extending to mystery babylon the roman catholic church and her daughters the denominational and non-denominational churches who practice iniquity harboring every unclean and hateful spirit but there will come a day when their iniquity will be full and like the amorites they will be destroyed for their unbelief and hard unrepentant hearts god's word says come out of her my people that ye be not partakers of her sins and that you receive not of her plagues for her sins have reached into heaven and god hath remembered her iniquities reward her even as she rewarded you and double under her double according to her works in the cup which she have filled fill to her double if you are christ's bride you will come out of sin loving churches and into christ by the baptism of the holy ghost how will the rapture occur the rapture will occur by the power and authority of jesus christ's spirit through a shout voice and trump for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first first the word shout in the greek means the order command stimulating cry from jesus christ to get his people ready for the wedding or rapture this shouter cry must be the same midnight cry described in matthew 25 verse 6 because both texts deal with jesus's wedding to his bride which is the rapture the cry that awoke the ten virgins both wise and foolish caused them to trim their lamps sanctification but only the wise filled their lamps with oil baptism of the holy ghost in order to go meet the bridegroom history witnesses that god's ministry through the late william branham was the shout or cry that awakened the christian church worldwide the supernatural preaching and healing ministry of branham was introduced in chapter 7 and is fully developed in chapter 13 but for now you can rejoice that the first of the three steps in the rapture plan is in progress god's bible message preached through branham is still being preached by ministers being taken around the world awakening both wise and foolish christians as you've read this book you've been made aware of this worldwide shout and now it's your responsibility to obey it second the voice of the archangel is a future event that will be the voice of the resurrection for the dead in christ group mentioned in first thessalonians 4 16 the voice of the archangel is the same voice that resurrected lazarus in john 11 43 and will one day resurrect all the dead in christ who faithfully serve the lord jesus christ during the past two thousand years the literal bodies of the dead in christ will rise first being united with glorified bodies and then sometime afterwards at the last trump we which are alive and remain on the earth will receive our body change it's possible that wise virgin christians who are alive and remain may see the glorified bodies of the resurrected dead in christ saints for a short period of time before the rapture immediately following jesus resurrection the bible says and the graves were opened and many bodies of the saints which slept arose and came out of the graves after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared unto many if the future rapture resurrection is patterned the same as jesus's resurrection from the grave in matthew chapter 27 then we may see paul peter james and john in their glorified bodies for a short time before our bodies are changed what a faith building experience it would be to see with our own eyes the saints we read about in the holy bible all of our lives oh how exciting it is to be a holy ghost-filled christian and imagine the wonderful things god has in store for his son's bride third the trump of god or last trump will sound to finish the three-step rapture plan which will change the bodies of the living saints and call for the gathering of the dead and living in christ to the sky to meet jesus in the air at the wedding ceremony paul writes then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord the apostle continues behold i show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed for this corruptable must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality just as the bride's processional music signals for the bride to come forward to meet her waiting bridegroom during an earthly wedding so the last trump signals for the union in the sky of jesus christ and his bride the last trump is also known as the seventh seal recall chapter seven's teaching that the book of revelation seven seals are seven revelations the new testament church needs to understand the bible the last and seventh seal was the unknown day and hour of the rapture known only to the father according to mark 13 32 making the last trump and the seventh seal identical the shout voice and trump are all performed by the holy ghost which is the same spirit that quickened jesus's own body at his resurrection from the dead but if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you the last sign before the rapture genesis 18 verses 9 through 15 powerfully foreshadows god's last sign before the rapture before referencing the last sign observe the context of this story in genesis 18 verses 1 through 8 god and two angels visit abraham and sarah appearing in flesh bodies and eating butter milk and veal verses 9-15 detail god confirming to abraham that he will have a son through sarah standing behind them sarah overhears this and laughs within herself instantly god discerns her doubt and questions abraham about sarah's laughter asking is anything too hard for the lord sarah hears god and proceeds to lie to him saying she did not laugh but god says nay but thou didst laugh genesis 19 describes lot's escape as sodom and gomorrah is destroyed genesis 20 shows abraham's second lapse in lying about sarah being his wife to abimelech and also god's graceful restoration of sarah to abraham god keeps his word and visits sarah in genesis 21 allowing isaac to be born to the 100 year old abraham and 90 year old sarah foreshadowing is seen in the arrival of the promised son isaac who represents jesus the promised son arriving for the rapture before isaac arrived though abraham and sarah's bodies needed changed because his ability to reproduce was dead and the deadness of sarah's womb wouldn't permit a pregnancy their body change from infertility to fertility foreshadows the body change at the rapture for we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptable and we should be changed what was god's last sign to abraham and sarah before each experienced a body change genesis 18 verses 9 through 15 reveals god's last sign to abraham and sarah before the promised son arrived was a man god discerning sarah's doubtful heart through a supernatural gift of discernment since god is the word john 1 verse 1 he was a discerner of the thoughts and intents of sarah's heart despite the fact that she was standing behind him and made no noise with her voice notice this biblical pattern god in a flesh body discerning the thoughts and intents of the heart this same pattern repeated in the son of man ministry of jesus christ during his earthly ministry a son of man is simply a prophet as ezekiel was given this title over 90 times and the lord jesus the only god prophet bore this title over 80 times as son of man jesus twice used his discernment to reveal the thoughts and intents of believers hearts in john 1 christ discerned nathanael's thoughts telling him that he saw him under a fig tree when philip called him aware that only christ could have known his previous whereabouts and conversation with philip nathanael instantly identified jesus as the son of god the king of israel jesus's supernatural discernment proved he was god's prophet later in john 4 christ discerned the thoughts and intents of the samaritan woman at jacob's well she told jesus she had no husband to which christ agreed but then told her she had had five husbands and the current man she was living with was not her husband convinced of the supernatural gift of discernment she uttered sir i perceive that thou art a prophet notice jesus used his gift of discernment among the jewish people in john 1 and then among the samaritans in john 4. the gospels often differentiate three races jews samaritans half jew and half gentile and gentiles jesus then used his discernment gift with two races jew and samaritan but never with the gentiles wouldn't the ethical and just god be obligated to manifest jesus discernment gift to the gentiles in luke 17 30 the lord promised that the son of man would be revealed in the day when societal conditions mirrored the days of noah and lot this was one of the 14 conditions for the rapture previously listed in this chapter this son of man ministry must be intended for the gentiles because god is currently dealing with the gentiles having blinded the jews to their messiah thankfully tape recorders from the 1940s through 1960s have preserved evidence that the gentiles have already received this final gentile son of man discernment ministry yes you read that correctly the gentiles have already received the son of man ministry as it came and went in god's ordained time and season the prophetic supernatural ministry of the late william branham 1909-1965 fulfilled jesus promise from luke 17 30 to send a son of man ministry to the gentiles branham's ministry is fully explained in chapter 13 but know that the holy spirit vindicated his ministry with the same gift of discernment jesus used in john chapters 1 and 4. in a 1954 prayer line branham told a female patient 15 secrets by god's discernment power including her name address and many details about her sicknesses discernments like these were commonplace in branham's ministry as tape recordings of his sermons contain hundreds of these same amazing occurrences branham's discernment ministry was not done in a corner just as paul testified before most noble festus of his obedience to the heavenly vision hundreds even thousands were beneficiaries of branham's obedience to his heavenly commission furthermore on six occasions the spirit of god prompted branham to publicly declare that his discernment gift was the last sign the gentile church would receive before the rapture all six declarations can be read or listened to online not only was the last sign declared but it was stamped with thus saith the lord the authoritative phrase signaling god's literal self-revelation on april 11 1961 in bloomington illinois branham said remember let me tell you thus saith the spirit of god that's all me this is the last sign to the gentile church before the rapture three days later in bloomington branham added remember thus saith the holy spirit this is your last sign write it in your bible and if something rises besides this and greater than this call me a false prophet on may 19 1961 in dawson creek british columbia branham announced just remember thus saith the lord you will never in any no more gentile church age ever see any sign to succeed this go greater this is the last sign of the church on july 7 1962 in grass valley california branham declared you'll never receive another sign this is it thus saith the lord would a prophet of god make a statement like that if it wasn't true you're receiving your greatest sign and your last sign before the appearing of christ on april 11 1964 in birmingham alabama branham charged the believers this is the last sign remember thus saith the lord did you ever hear me say that but what it was true you are seeing your last sign that's scriptural you've seen your last sign pentecost on april 26 1965 in los angeles california branham prophesied and remember abraham and his group never received one more sign from god until the promised son arrived how many know that's true that sign of discernment and the royal seat of abraham let me hear you let me tell you thus saith the lord you're receiving your last sign that's according to the scriptures and the revelation of god that's in my heart that speaks that this is the truth a few years back i had the pleasure of meeting two people unfortunately both are now deceased who experienced branham's discernment gift in very personal ways my first meeting was with tom brown a lima ohio resident who attended branham's home church in jeffersonville indiana for nearly five years 1960 through 1965. brown described multiple instances in which branham would discern his questions and provide answers before tom even asked the questions a second witness i met of branham's son of man ministry was florence humes healed of tuberculosis after branham prayed for her on august 6 1965. this supernatural interaction is recorded on tape and available to read or listen to online god's spirit led branham to foretell florence's healing saying that she would gain weight on two consecutive mondays as a sign of her healing florence's healing took place exactly as foretold by god's prophet florence who already had three daughters before the tuberculosis lived to birth another daughter and four sons leading to 25 grandchildren and over 40 great-grandchildren branham's discernment gift appeared at the correct time chronologically just as god in flesh appeared to abraham and sarah at the right time god and flesh appeared before both the destruction of sodom and gomorrah and isaac's birth the son of man ministry of branham appeared before the rapture and great tribulation even though you like me probably missed experiencing the gentile son of man ministry firsthand it is no cause for discouragement most prophetic gifts are rejected by the ones god intends should receive them for instance jesus taught that both his ministry and that of john the baptist were sent to the jews but rejected by the majority be encouraged that you now have the chance to receive god's last sign to the gentiles just before the rapture you can listen to branham sermons and discernments online and then see god do similar things through the living bride church today blessed are your eyes if they can see god's last sign to abraham's seed and receive the bible instructions preached by god's prophet rewards for receiving the revelation of the rapture the eternal rewards for receiving the revelation of the rapture are perfectly beautiful you'll need an active imagination in your attempt to fathom the immensity of christ's rewards for his bride previously in this chapter you read a few rewards worth recalling such as escaping the wrath of god during the great tribulation period and knowing when the times and seasons the rapture occurs accepting god's truth right now ensures you'll be prayerfully prepared for jesus return and miss the global destruction and torment of the seven trumpets seven vows and three woes there are at least four more rewards for receiving this revelation first you'll have much assurance in knowing you are part of christ's bride or true church scripture refers to this assurance as a seal which in the greek means security from satan and a mark upon by the impress of a seal or a stamp the seal is the baptism of the holy ghost so it's even more apparent that our gospel comes not in word only but also in power and in the holy ghost and in much assurance another way scripture describes this seal of assurance is a token old testament examples of tokens include the rainbow circumcision the passover lamb's blood upon the doorposts aaron's rod and the scarlet cord given to rahab in particular it behooves you and me to meditate on two tokens the blood of the passover lamb and rahab scarlet cord the public display of the passover lamb's blood was required for israel's exodus out of egypt in fact without the blood publicly displayed the death angel destroyed the firstborn of every family similarly the blood or life of jesus christ must be publicly displayed in the lives of christians in order for them to make an exodus from this world to the rapture in the air and escape the oncoming great tribulation rahab's scarlet cord was publicly displayed so she and her house would be spared from jericho's destruction through her observable token she and her family made an exodus from god's wrath again the red cord represents a public testimony of the red blood of jesus christ since the bible teaches the life is in the blood these old testament symbols represent the life of jesus christ which is the holy spirit baptism must be publicly displayed by christians because the spirit is life just as your boarding pass is the assurance you'll have a seat on a flight the baptism of the holy ghost is your seal token or assurance you'll have a ticket for the rapture a second reward is escaping death for those who are alive and remain will not die but will instead have their vile mortal bodies changed into immortal ones though countless funerals have been observed for thousands of years there will be a small group of christians that will not need funeral services the rapture is a one-time worldwide death pass this miraculous event will be the first and only time a large group of saints will escape death this has never ever happened in world history up to the current time only two individuals have had the high calling of missing death only elijah and enoch all their saints have had to die think of it we may be that fortunate blessed privileged generation to join elijah and enoch as raptured saints if not us it will certainly be a generation in the near future because the signs of the rapture are evident a third reward is experiencing two glorious events in heavenly places while the earth is being plagued during the great tribulation the meeting in the air and the wedding supper of the lamb imagine meeting paul peter mary the mother of jesus tabitha and the rest of the saints in the sky at the rapture picture in your mind shaking hands with and instantly recognizing martin luther and john wesley how will you feel seeing your loved ones who have died but now you're reunited with them in young youthful new bodies this event includes the greatest reward finally seeing jesus christ god's only begotten son the risen lord of glory face to face oh how my heart races and tears begin forming in my eyes when i think of this moment when i shall not see through a glass darkly but shall see christ face to face not only will we see him but he shall change our vile body that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body our eyes shall behold the desire of nations the bright morning star the fairest of ten thousand the root and offspring of david the holy one of israel and the faithful bridegroom your faith will become sight at the rapture no longer will we be able to say peter's words having not seen ye love i have seen my jesus the one i have loved the wedding supper takes place in heaven after the meeting in the air while scripture does not offer many details about this wedding reception it for sure entails both a bride presentation and communion service paul reveals the bride presentation in second corinthians 11 verse 2. for i am jealous over you with godly jealousy for i've espoused you to one husband that i may present you as a chaste virgin to christ the corinthian church was supernaturally birthed under paul's ministry in acts 18 verses 1 through 17 by christ's divine direction the apostle writes about his duty to present the corinthian believers as chaste virgins to christ and the only logical time this could occur would be at the wedding supper of the lamb no doubt the believers died one by one after paul left their city leaving paul no chance to present them to christ but every faithful corinthian who receive paul's preaching about the baptism of the holy ghost will be resurrected for the rapture and will be gathered in heaven at the wedding supper this is when paul can present the bride members from corinth to their husband jesus christ it seems possible that all seven stars or human messengers to the seven churches will present the bride of his church age to jesus christ following the bride's presentation raptured saints will partake in the heavenly communion service just as jesus desired with desire to have communion with his disciples before his crucifixion and ascension to heaven the bishop of our souls will desire sweet communion with his bride after the gentile church ages have finished christ held communion with his disciples to signal the end of their intimate earthly communion but promised the next communion service would signal renewed intimate eternal fellowship melchizedek's communion with abram foreshadowed this communion in genesis 14 verses 14-20 how entirely appropriate for christ to conduct communion after the trials of life are finished abram having defeated four kings with his trained army and restoring his nephew lot was met with bread wine and blessings by melchizedek communion at the wedding supper will also express that blessings and fellowship follow victorious battle christ the great promise keeper will fulfill the promise he gave to his disciples but i say unto you i will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine until that day when i drink it new with you in my father's kingdom experiencing christ's one thousand-year millennial reign as kings and priests is the fourth reward this millennial period represents the honeymoon period for christ and his bride naturally following the wedding ceremony rapture and reception marriage supper the lamb only a select group of people will enjoy this blessed sinless one thousand year day for one day is with the lord as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day revelation 20 verses 4 through 6 states exactly who will reign on the earth for one thousand peaceful years and i saw thrones and they sat upon them and judgment was given unto them and i saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of jesus and for the word of god and which had not worshipped the beast neither his image neither had received his mark upon their foreheads or in their hands and they lived and reigned with christ a thousand years but the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished this is the first resurrection blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection on such the second death hath no power but they shall be priests of god and of christ and shall reign with him a thousand years catch the fact that the rest of the dead do not live during the millennium only faithful christians who worship jesus in spirit and truth will live and reign with christ the foolish virgin will miss the millennium because she foolishly neglected the oil the baptism of the holy ghost christians are warned and admonished to not neglect the powerful holy ghost gospel additionally untold billions of believers will not experience the glory and beauty of a one thousand year period without sin imagine a millennium without the devil temptation lust greed murder destruction and politics for 365 000 straight days you'll enjoy only pure peace grace victory beauty and joy some christians will even reign over nations while others over small regions of the earth for jesus promised good faithful servants would have authority over ten cities submitting only to christ's spirit in this life as a cross-caring follower of jesus entitles you to lead cities perhaps even nations in the next life christ's words remain true he that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much a christian faithful over a few things will be made ruler over many things branham writes and now he jesus says that he who keeps doing his works faithfully until the end will be given power over nations and will be a strong capable unbending ruler who can cope so powerfully with any situation that even the most desperate enemy will be broken if need be his demonstration of rule by power will be like unto the very sons this is very amazing consequences for rejecting the revelation of the rapture the main consequence for rejecting the revelation of the rapture is unpreparedness for christ's return learn from jesus's teaching on stewardship to be prepared for the rapture by honoring those in your care being sober and doing christ's will god's shout has sounded and is now sounding in your ears neglecting this divine shout or bible-based message god sent through william branham produces a spiritual state of slumber paul says most people will be overtaken when jesus returns likewise the apostle admonishes christians to not let this opportunity to be baptized with the holy ghost and exit the earth in the rapture slip away from our minds god's mercy is placed in end time exodus right in our laps foolish is the only word suitable for describing those who reject this christ indwelling experience that was hid from ages and from generations but now is made manifest to his saints believers who reject the rapture revelation but die before the rapture will not have to experience the awful great tribulation period their consequences for rejection include being absent from the rapture the marriage supper the lamb and millennium believers who reject the rapture revelation but live long enough to physically miss the rapture will have to die in the tribulation being righteous yet not filled with the holy ghost god will not let them suffer the worst torments with the wicked before death jesus teaches that the foolish virgins will ask for an opening into the rapture after it has happened but christ's voice will answer back in their heart saying verily i say unto you i know you not the way to know jesus is to possess oil the baptism of the holy ghost indescribable torments of hail fire brimstone and inescapable demonic oppression contained in the seven trumpets and seven vowels await unbelievers the bible rejecting group sudden destruction and travail is determined upon them a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time conclusion clearly defined by pause a mystery the rapture or caught up experience is now revealed as a secret sudden going away of christ's bride with her beloved bridegroom to their marriage supper just before the great tribulation sets in upon the rest of humanity knowing the six reasons that prove the rapture occurs before the tribulation is a great blessing and should inspire christians to be awake and alert daily wearing and utilizing the full armor of god by god's amazing grace we'll accept his invitation and be prepared for this once in history event the privilege of skipping death with a small group of christians as jesus spirit changes our bodies for the meeting in the air now that all 12 mysteries are revealed chapter 13 shows how they were foretold to be revealed or finished nearly 2 000 years ago in revelation 10 verse 7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets just as jesus identified the fulfillment of scripture at his first coming in luke 4 21 we too can echo his declaration of another scripture being fulfilled this day this scripture revelation 10 7 is fulfilled action steps to be in the rapture step 1 be sure you are baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and fill with the holy ghost baptism step 2 find grow in and remain in your position in your family local church and ministries step 3 daily watch and pray for the imminent return of jesus christ and you'll be prepared because all that love him will see his appearing 2 timothy 4 verse 8.
