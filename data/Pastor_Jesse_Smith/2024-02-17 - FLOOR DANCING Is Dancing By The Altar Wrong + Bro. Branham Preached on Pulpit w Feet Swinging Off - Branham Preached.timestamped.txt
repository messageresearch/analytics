[0:03] what makes the difference the sensation
[0:05] that's reason I don't believe in dancing
[0:06] on the
[0:08] floor greetings friends in the matchless
[0:11] name of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[0:13] purpose of this video is to answer a
[0:15] question from a brother from Africa he
[0:17] asked me is it sinful to Floor dance and
[0:20] he defined floor dancing as dancing at
[0:23] the alter first I want to say I
[0:25] appreciate all questions you know
[0:27] brother brandham did questions and
[0:28] answer Services of course and every
[0:30] Sunday night when I'm preaching at my
[0:32] home church I take questions and answers
[0:34] and also teach a lesson as well so we
[0:36] never want to be afraid of questions
[0:38] it's okay if we don't have all the
[0:39] answers but we know the Holy Ghost will
[0:41] guide us into all Truth by the grace of
[0:43] God if I'm not mistaken this brother or
[0:46] a brother in his same country recently
[0:48] asked about Flatt tops so I made a video
[0:50] about that as well and friends my name
[0:52] is Pastor Jesse Smith I've been
[0:54] pastoring here in akan Ohio at bride of
[0:56] Christ Fellowship for 17 years and I
[0:59] defend the Bible revelations that Jesus
[1:01] Christ revealed to his Prophet brother
[1:03] William brandham 1909 to 1965 I also
[1:06] defend brother bram's Godly Christian
[1:08] character so let's start with the
[1:10] question here's the question from an
[1:12] email we don't allow the people to dance
[1:15] at the altar everyone must stand at
[1:16] their sitting position without coming
[1:18] forward to dance when you come near the
[1:20] altar we call it floor dancing here's
[1:22] the quote from the prophet so let's
[1:23] listen to the quote from the prophet
[1:25] brother random says the following in
[1:28] God's only provided place of worship
[1:30] November
[1:31] 2865 let's listen to the quote all the
[1:34] same what makes the difference the
[1:35] sensation that's the reason I don't
[1:37] believe in dancing on the floor no man
[1:40] so my initial answer is no there's
[1:42] nothing wrong with dancing by the altar
[1:46] I could not find any Bible scriptures
[1:47] that would forbid this and of course I
[1:49] could not find any quotes from God's
[1:51] Prophet brother brandham either that
[1:52] would forbid dancing near The Altar and
[1:55] on a personal note every time I dance
[1:57] before the Lord or nearly every time
[1:59] it's right by the alar cuz I'm usually
[2:00] preaching by God's grace but I want to
[2:02] make a few points here as well the first
[2:04] point is that I think this group of
[2:06] churches has misunderstood the quote
[2:08] from God's only provided place of
[2:10] worship and this is what I emailed the
[2:12] brother a few days ago if you look at
[2:14] the context of the quote you'll see
[2:16] brother Bram is talking about a man
[2:17] hugging up a woman while they're dancing
[2:20] so in brother bram's terminology in this
[2:23] case floor dancing was men and women
[2:24] dancing together hugging each other up
[2:27] and the man brother R said would get
[2:29] sensation when he hugged up a woman
[2:31] let's listen to the
[2:33] quote I looked around then all the hard
[2:36] nights the trials passed away and I
[2:39] could see their faces and a young woman
[2:41] run up there one of the most beautiful
[2:43] women and she just threw her arms around
[2:45] me and said precious
[2:47] brother and when she passed by now she
[2:49] was
[2:50] woman so but in there there'll never be
[2:54] sin our glands are changed there we
[2:57] won't raise children no more there see
[3:00] all the same what makes the difference
[3:02] the sensation that's the reason I don't
[3:03] believe in dancing on the floor no man
[3:06] uh before God in my Bible I've lived
[3:09] clean as that way through my life when I
[3:11] was a little boy all through my Young
[3:13] Manhood any girl I ever went out with I
[3:15] can walk right back to the Judgment with
[3:17] her see but there's no man I don't care
[3:20] who you are can let a woman in the make
[3:22] of a woman hug herself up close to you
[3:24] if you're a true healthy man it's a
[3:27] sensation but it wasn't there there's no
[3:30] glands you're all the same glands just
[3:33] pure
[3:34] unadulterated sisterly and brotherly
[3:37] love more than it would be for your even
[3:39] for you hug your own little daughter see
[3:42] your own daughter said she's male she's
[3:44] female and you're male see it could
[3:47] create something but there it can't sin
[3:49] is done it's all
[3:52] over real just real holy
[3:56] love so that's the first point I want to
[3:58] make I believe the churches here have
[4:00] misunderstood the quote and I'm not
[4:01] condemning them I'm just saying that's
[4:03] the first observation I see about this
[4:05] brother brandom is not condemning
[4:07] dancing by the altar a second point I
[4:09] want to make is that every church is
[4:10] Sovereign of itself brother Ram said
[4:12] that many times I'm not going to play
[4:13] the quotes here on this video but you
[4:15] can look at up and so perhaps you know
[4:17] this Sovereign Church wants to make that
[4:19] requirement that nobody Dance by the
[4:21] altar will they have the freedom to do
[4:23] that by God's grace as long as people
[4:24] can dance and praise the Lord and Psalm
[4:27] 149 and Psalm 150 the Bible says pray
[4:29] praise His name in The Dance Let Them
[4:31] praise the name of Jesus in the dance
[4:34] perhaps they've had selfish prideful
[4:36] people trying to get attention by
[4:37] dancing in front of the whole church I
[4:39] don't know maybe they just have a large
[4:41] church with limited space I don't know
[4:43] so we got to let them have their freedom
[4:45] as a sovereign church so as long as they
[4:47] allow them to dance that's okay by God's
[4:48] grace as far as I'm concerned and
[4:50] somebody can correct me if I'm wrong by
[4:52] God's grace with a quote and also a
[4:54] Bible scripture the third point I want
[4:56] to make is that David danced right in
[4:58] the presence of God the Prince of God of
[5:00] course was dwelling in the Ark of the
[5:01] Covenant at that time so we know that's
[5:03] scriptural David danced right in the
[5:05] presence of God and another examples
[5:07] from Proverbs 8 the logos was playing in
[5:10] the presence of God brother Ram also
[5:11] says this in 1953 the pillar of fire
[5:14] brother ramam says the logos was playing
[5:16] Yonder like a little child before the
[5:19] doorstep of the father so there the
[5:21] logos is dancing right in the presence
[5:23] of the invisible father let's listen to
[5:25] the quote but then the Loos that went
[5:28] out of him become like a little Halo of
[5:31] light let's see it playing Yonder like a
[5:34] child before the doorstep of the
[5:38] father and
[5:40] now I can see him as he moves over here
[5:43] and he draws into his his memory or his
[5:47] mind a picture of what the world should
[5:50] be now there's not a star or nothing
[5:53] another point I'd like to make is that
[5:54] brother random got so filled with the
[5:56] spirit so lost in the spirit that one
[5:58] time and perhaps perhaps others I don't
[6:00] know but at least one time he was so
[6:02] lost in the spirit he was sitting up on
[6:04] the pulpit with his feet swinging off
[6:06] preaching as hard as he could go and he
[6:08] said I'd like to stay there a while and
[6:11] he said he lived off that for several
[6:13] days afterwards getting so lost in the
[6:16] spirit remember the pulpit is a sacred
[6:18] desk right it's a sacred place so here
[6:20] brother Brandon was preaching as hard as
[6:21] he can sitting on top of the pulpit and
[6:24] he said he wished he could have stayed
[6:25] there a while so here we see the freedom
[6:27] of the Holy Ghost here we see the the
[6:29] power of the Holy Ghost and of course
[6:31] Church sovereignty as well by God's
[6:33] grace let's listen to the quote it's
[6:34] from Redemption and completeness in Joy
[6:38] 1954 here some time ago I was preaching
[6:41] in a little church and and I was just oh
[6:45] I haven't got very many fullfit manners
[6:47] according to the I guess the Theology of
[6:51] the day so I guess I got a little unruly
[6:53] and I think I jumped up on the plat on
[6:54] the pull pit like that and grabbed the
[6:56] microphone my hand and sat there my feet
[6:57] swinging off preaching it's hard as they
[6:59] could I come to myself I didn't know
[7:01] what I was doing and few minutes I got
[7:03] lost again I found myself down the
[7:05] middle of the aisle rolling up my trous
[7:08] away I don't know why but I was really
[7:11] I'd like to stay there a while one thing
[7:14] I'd like to say it was somewhere that I
[7:15] sure was enjoying myself I just lived
[7:18] off of it for several days
[7:20] afterwards it's by God's grace I think
[7:22] I'll play one more quote brother R said
[7:24] the first time he danced in the spirit
[7:26] was at a New Year's Eve service at his
[7:28] church there inff Ville and after
[7:31] condemning the dancing he thought about
[7:33] it for a while the Holy Spirit directed
[7:34] him to the word and then he said it
[7:36] wasn't very long after he started
[7:37] patting his feet that he was out there
[7:39] with that girl dancing I got the victory
[7:42] he said so we don't know where brother
[7:44] brandham was dancing I've been to the
[7:46] brandom Tabernacle a few times I'm not
[7:48] quite sure if it was in the aisle or
[7:50] right up there in front by the altar but
[7:52] I just thought I'd play this quote to
[7:53] show how brother random so freely danc
[7:56] in the spirit perhaps in front of the
[7:57] altar perhaps in the eye
[8:00] I can't tell from this quote but I just
[8:01] want everyone to see the freedom of the
[8:03] Holy Ghost brother brandom preaching
[8:05] while sitting on top of the pulpit and
[8:07] then brother brandom out there dancing
[8:08] right around females of course not
[8:11] dancing with them necessarily but
[8:12] dancing in the Holy Ghost enjoying the
[8:14] freedom of the Holy Ghost let's listen
[8:15] to the
[8:17] quote hey I got feel pretty good got Pat
[8:20] my foot with that girl W well you know I
[8:23] thought well maybe that's just my method
[8:26] is put anyhow so I started patting a you
[8:30] you know wasn't very long I thought
[8:33] there with that girl
[8:40] D I got the
[8:42] [Music]
[8:45] victory in
[8:47] closing friends I hope this video was a
[8:49] blessing Again by the grace of God I
[8:51] love these questions I love that
[8:53] Christians want to please the Holy Ghost
[8:55] and we have such a wonderful promise in
[8:57] John 16:14 the Holy Ghost will guide us
[8:59] into all truth brother Ram told us many
[9:01] times prove all things test me by the
[9:04] word and so this question like many
[9:06] other questions we just take it back to
[9:07] the word and we also want to balance it
[9:09] with the quotes from brother brandom
[9:10] because they align with the word of God
[9:12] and we can plainly see that every church
[9:14] is Sovereign of itself God loves dancing
[9:17] in the spirit there's freedom in the
[9:19] Holy Ghost and we can dance right in the
[9:21] presence of Jesus Christ Our Lord if you
[9:24] have any questions concerns or
[9:25] testimonies about this video please
[9:26] contact
[9:28] me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[9:31] the desire of your
[9:34] heart
