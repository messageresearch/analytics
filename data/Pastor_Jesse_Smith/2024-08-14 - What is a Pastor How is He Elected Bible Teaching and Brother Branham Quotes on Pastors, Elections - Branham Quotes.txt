TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] but the full and complete authority of the church is the pastor read that in the Bible see if that's not Bible order greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to answer a viewer's question about what a pastor is and how a pastor is elected this is an excellent question so hope this video is a help to many people by God's grace hi friends I'm Jesse Smith pastor bride of Christ Fellowship here in Ohio USA and I defend the original Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ that he revealed to St Paul and then had to restore through Martin Luther John Wesley and the late Prophet William brandham who lived from 1909 to 1965 and I also defend brother M's Godly Christian character so let's go right to the question here I had an email and this is most of the question here it says good morning I'm wondering if you ever made a detailed video on what a pastor is what a pastor should do how to elect a pastor and even details on what an associate pastor is I'm looking for verses in the Bible and quotes on William brandham that support it as well so it seems like there's four questions in here but then there's sub questions within the original questions so we'll go through these first question is what is a pastor according to the Greek Lexicon a pastor means Shepherd so a pastor is a spiritual Shepherd over God's people this is an office that St Paul ordained in Ephesians 4:1 there was Apostles prophets teachers pastors and evangelists so the pastor is one office in the five-fold ministry but it's actually the office that has the most constant influence on the people of God an apostle as a missionary will make new converts in a certain area and then ordain elders and then leave those Elders that the missionary ordains will be the Pastors in a certain area but of course each individual church has only one Pastor now there are cases of associate pastors but you don't find the word associate pastor in the Bible prophets are men who speak with thus sayi the Lord they foretell things they reveal Mysteries according to numerous Bible scriptures like Amos 3:7 prophets also have dreams and visions that come to pass according to Numbers Chapter 12 the pastor is the shepherd he stays with the congregation and feeds them the word of God the Evangelist often travels around like Philip the Evangelist when he went to Samaria in Acts chapter 8 they preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ it stirs the people up and they move on to another church the teacher often stays in the local church but the teacher can also travel a little bit like a evangelist they teach the word of God in a very deep way they give instruction very thorough instruction into the deep things of God in order to help the people be more established and rooted in the Gospel of Jesus Christ so the first sub question within that first question is what age do you have to be you just have to be old enough to be married and have children children that's according to 1 Timothy 3 it's verse 4 one that ruleth well his own house having his children in subjection with all gravity he also has to be old enough not to be a novice that's 1 Timothy 3:6 not a novice lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil novice means a newly planted believer or a young convert so the age of a person when they're beyond a novice all depends on their gift in their life or their Devotion to the Lord Jesus Christ I'll just use myself as an example I heard the message in late 2001 but by 2006 I was pastoring and I pastored ever since the last 18 years by God's grace So within four years of being in the message I'd received the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'd been preaching I was a deacon and then four years later I was ordained as a pastor so finishing that question what is a pastor the pastor is the preacher who stays with the local congregation to feed them the word of God the pastor is like the overseer we see this in Acts 20:28 take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock over which the Holy Ghost has made you overseers to feed the Church of God which he has purchased with his own blood so that kind of gets into the next question second question is what should a pastor do so basically according to scripture there's numerous things a pastor should do but he should feed the flock that's acts 20:28 this feeding the flock will build the people up that's in Acts 20:32 the word of his grace which is able to build you up Pastor also to be an example to the people not a lord over the people that's in 1 Peter 5: 2-4 feed the flock of God which is among you taking the oversight thereof so there's the overseeing not by constraint but willingly not for filthy lucer but of a ready mind neither is being Lords over God's Heritage but being amples to the flock so the pastor is an example of a Christian to the flock the pastor is supposed to pray and study the word of God according to acts 6 2-4 they need time to be devoted to study and prayer a pastor can do a job as well like I do not all pastors have two jobs but I'm a VI bivocational Pastor uh St Paul did this acts 18:3 he was a Tent Maker so not only did he preach and teach and do a missionary work Apostle work but he also was a tent maker to have an income as well so the pastor also ruled by the word of God or he has the final say or final Authority in a local church that's Hebrews 13:7 and8 remember them which have the rule over you who has spoken unto you the word of God whose Faith follow so again the church is supposed to follow the faith of the pastor because he's the example considering the end of their conversation so they should see the fruits of the pastor's life they should see the end of his conduct the fruit of his choices the fruit of his ministry Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever so here we see Jesus Christ has always done this he's always had one man lead the people and he's the example and people follow him we can think of Noah we can think of Moses we can think of Joshua God has always set this up Old Testament and New Testament and then Hebrews 13:17 obbey them that have the rule over you and submit yourselves for they watch for your souls so there we see the role of the pastor to watch over the Sheep the shepherd watches over the Sheep as they must give an account so that's something people don't realize the pastors have given give an account for his congregation that they may do it with joy so all pastors want to give an account to Jesus with joy that the congregations had Souls that were obedient to the word of God that followed the word of God but the Bible said there will be some that have to give an account with grief the Bible says and not with grief for it is unprofitable for you also answering the question what a pastor must do we can see the pastor requirements in Titus 1 5-9 Paul said he left Titus to set things in order Elders in every city of course Elder has two definitions it can be the pastor CU he's the local elder or it can be uh those men that have the most spiritual experience in the church so verse 6 Titus 1:6 if any be blameless the husband of one wife having faithful children not accused of Riot or unruly for a bishop so the bishop is another name for a pastor so you have Pastor Shepherd Bishop Elder those are all synonymous as the steward of God God not self-willed not soon angry not given to whine no Striker not given to Filthy luer but a lover of hospitality a lover of Good Men sober just holy temperate holding fast the faithful word as he has been taught that he may be able by sound Doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers so Titus has a long list of Pastor requirements then 1 Timothy 3 1-7 has an even longer list the Bible said if a man desire the office of a bishop he desires a good work the bishop must be blameless husband of one wife Vigilant sober of good behavior given Hospitality apt to teach so pastors should have the ability to teach the word of God as well although they may not be gifted the same way as someone who just has the gift of teaching not given to Wine no Striker not greedy a filthy ler but patient not a brawler not Covetous one that ruleth well his own house having his children in subjection with all gravity for if a man know not how to rule his own house how shall he take care of the Church of God not a novice lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the comination of the devil moreover he must have a good report of them which are without lest he fall into reproach and a snare of the devil moving on to question number three how do you elect a new pastor how does the election work how many candidates so those three questions can all be answered uh based upon the bylaws of the church brother brandham ran his church based upon bylaws which were approved of rules that the congregation had approved of and also the Board of Trustees and the pastor so there can be as many candidates to be the pastor as the church allows it all depends on the bylaws of the church and the election is set up the way the church wants it to be and every church can be Sovereign of itself brother Ram tells us every church is Sovereign of itself I'll play two quotes about bylaws it's from the placing of deacons 1958 brother Brandon was ordaining deacons and he said they must be ordained according to the bylaws of the church every year the deacons or trustees automatically fill their time if they want to come back they can or they can resign then brother Ram said his bylaws and the job descriptions of each Office of the church were hanging up in the Tabernacle that way everybody knew the duties of the trustees the deacons the treasurer the pastor and so forth let's listen to the quotes and ever so often according to the bylaws of the church every year the deacons are trustees automatically uh fill their time and if they want to come back all right if they do not want to come back then they can place some in their places at this board had resigned it's the sovereignty and the law of the church by the word of God therefore that it just can't say that I think this man would be a right man that isn't it brother Neville thinks this man be a right man are the trustee board think this man to be a right man it has to be by the church no one does anything within himself here it's the boat of the church it's a sovereign Church the old set of bylaws was destroyed in the 1937 flood we have recopied those and will be hung on the wall here soon the duties of Trustees deacons treasures and so forth pastors Associates and so forth it's important to know that before men in the Bible were ordained as pastors or Deacons that they first had to be proven so the people first had to see the gift of God operating in their life in order so they could be a candidate for that position so that's found in 1 Timothy 3:10 and let these also first be proved then let them use the office of a deacon being found blameless so in order for someone to be a candidate to be a pastor or associate pastor or Deacon the believer should witness beforehand that this man actually has the gift and the ability to do the office that he may go for or that he may be a candidate for and that would go for the pastor as well because he has to rule over his own house well first 1 Timothy 3:4 so before the man's a pastor people recognize wow he rules his house well he takes care of his own house he has all these attributes all these characteristics Paul laid out through Titus and Timothy's letters so he's first proven he's first tested before he's even considered a candidate okay Also regarding the third question what if a pastor dies can a dead man still be Pastor well I think scripturally we can say no a dead man cannot be the pastor of a church if a church has a dead man as the pastor they're breaking the word of God even if they're bylaws say that I think that's what's happening in brandom Tabernacle of course they call Brother brandham their Pastor they also call Joseph the pastor and then they have an associate pastor I believe but a dead man cannot Pastor a church there's no Bible example of that remember Hebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever so in MO mooses was going off the scene God did not tell the people Moses will be the pastor even though he's going to be dead or Moses is still going to be the leader even though he's dead no God said the opposite God told Moses get Joshua ready he's going to lead the people in and out because God wants a living man Leading the People think about it a dead Shepherd cannot be the pastor of living sheep it doesn't work in the natural and it certainly doesn't work in the spiritual this is in numbers 2715 through 23 God tells Moses he's going the way of all the Earth so he said set a man over the congregation that's numbers 27:16 so that man Joshua would go out before them go in before them and may lead them out because God said the congregation of the Lord shall not be as sheep which have no Shepherd so here it is thus saith the Bible there's always a living man as a Shepherd over the people and the Lord said unto Moses in verse 18 take thee Joshua the son of nun lay thine hand upon him do it before all the congregation in verse 19 give him a charge in the sight of all the people and verse 20 thou shalt put some of thine honor upon him that all the congregation of children of Israel may be obedient brother Braham even said in taking sides with Jesus 1962 he said he's getting old brother Neville's getting old if time rolls on you've got to fill our shoes so brother Ram knew if time went on he'd die brother Neville would die someone have to fill his shoes and preach the gospel let's listen to the quote you can stand and know the message and study to prove yourself you feel a call in your life I see two three young man four or five sitting another roll back here and and like that you're a young man I'm getting old brother Neville's is getting old we're middle-aged man if time rolls on we're going to walk off the scene after while you've got to fill our shoes see and so you seeing that maybe in that day even it'll be growing greater if there is a tomorrow you brother not with your little churches and you want to you're doing a work God will reward you for that go out there preach do everything you can that all of you get together you bunch of man and have meetings and talk on deep things of the scripture so I hope that answers that third question and all the sub questions underneath it brother Ram tells us every person in the church gets one vote as long as they're an official member and they're an official member if they meet the requirements of of the bylaws of the church so it all goes back to the bylaws as far as this third question about how to elect a pastor how does the election work how many candidates and what to do when a pastor dies also remember brother Ram said I won't always be your pastor that's from the future home 1964 let's listen to the quote I know it's been long and hot but people we won't always be standing here I won't always be your pastor let's make it sure brother bam even tells us in 1957 that the doctrine of brandham Tabernacle was between brother Neville and the church not even brother brandham because brother brandham wasn't elected as the pastor at that time brother Ram said the full complete Authority was in the pastor he said there's no one above the Elder he says I have nothing to do with what brother Neville does here that's up to you and brother Neville brother Ram said the only thing I do is just own the property and then brother Ram says you just can't remove brother Neville you need it in the mouth of two or three witnesses to bring an accusation against the elder brother R was quoting 1 Timothy 59 against an elder receive not an accusation but before two or three Witnesses then brother Ram said the congregation needs to vote and each person has one vote and the majority of the people is the authority of the Holy Ghost it's the vote of the Holy Ghost let's listen to the quote brother Ram said there's nobody got Authority here but the Holy Ghost that's right he does the moving and we take him as the majority of the people the way the people go let's listen to the quote but the full and complete authority of the church is the pastor read that in the Bible see if that's not Bible order that's exactly right there's no one above the Elder I have nothing to do with what brother Neville does here that's up to you and brother Neville if brother Neville wanted to preach Jehovah Witness Doctrine that's up to him and you see if he wanted to preach anything he wanted to that's between you and him and that's all if the congregation votes for him in there to preach that that's all right that's up to him the only thing that I do just is owning the property and if something another comes by that it's like moving the pastor and they want to take a vot on that you couldn't ask the Deacon to do that you'd come ask me I'd come down and say if you want to move the pastor tell me why has he done anything yes we called him drunk or we called him doing this or doing something wasn't right have you got three Witnesses of it yes we have that witness must first be tried don't receive an acquisation against the Elder L It Be by two or threee witness and let them first be proved against an elder then you have to swear to it that you saw it and prove it that you saw it and then if you did then that sins rebuked openly that it's wrong then say congregation do you want to change your pastor if the congregation votes forgive him and let him go on yet that's the way it has to stand see that isn't that fair that the way to run a church that's what the Bible said we have no Bishops and overseers and boards and so forth moves this and in and got a lot of authority there's nobody got Authority here but the Holy Ghost that's right he does the movement and we take him as the majority of the people the way the people go and the fourth and final question is what is an associate pastor so again the answer to this is it's based upon the bylaws of each sovereign individual Church having an associate pastor in the church can be a wonderful thing especially if the original Pastor is getting older it really helps a congregation from what I've heard from other pastors to know that there is a man who could take over if something happened to the original Pastor or the current Pastor one thing you'd want to be is faithful uh 2 Timothy 2:2 says and the things that thou has heard of me among many witnesses the same commit thou to Faithful Men Who should be able to teach others also so remember a pastor must be apt to teach and Paul tells us here commit the truth to Faithful Men Who can teach others as well so the associate should be someone who's faithful to the word of God it can teach others the word of God here's another quote brother brandom said when he first started brandom Tabernacle he was fulfilling most of the offices so some churches are big they have lots of brothers that can fill in the elected offices but other churches are small and so brother braham's church was small when he first started so he had to fulfill many of the offices he said he was Pastor Deacon trustee and everything else let's listen to the quotes from church order December 26 1963 look way we used to do it years ago sister gy wasn't The Pianist when I pastored here I would I had to be Pastor Deacon trustee everything else at once see but I I had to do it now you don't have to do it that way see because you got man to carry this out here's a good quote from Brother brandham Where it says the preacher should be a servant the preacher should never think he's greater than the people he should be lesser than the people brother R tells us this in why Christ speak uh October 4th 1959 the minister should be a public servant brother Ram says the preacher isn't any more than the man who just got saved this morning the preacher is a servant he's a brother let's listen to the quote and I I say this that I believe that this great spirit that's Among Us is the holy spirit I believe that he called me for this purpose doesn't make me any more than the man that got saved this morning just your servant your brother makes me less than you because I'm sent to serve you I'm a servant to the public a public service is a minister to serve the public to be the underdog to take this knocks and bl of the public whatever it is stand there and if you haven't got Grace enough to smile and take it then you ought to go back to Calvary and reconfirm your commission that's what you're supposed to do in closing friends hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God hopefully it answer some questions out there now there's numerous other scriptures and quotes I could have used but this is like a beginning video Perhaps Perhaps I'll do a part two if I get more questions on this but I want to give this wonderful brother a quick answer with scriptures and quotes so I'm hoping it's a help by the grace of God we're so thankful for the fivefold ministry all five gifts we need all five gifts they bring us to Unity they bring us to Perfection and they work the ministry by the grace of God according to Ephesians 4 8-16 at my house there's one morning every week where we pray just for the five full ministry we pray for all the ministers that we know and can think of and ask God to guide them help them strength them help them to rightly divide the word of truth it's so important these leaders these servants God will anoint them to bring us to the unity of the faith before the Rapture so we're thankful for that we're looking for the coming of the Lord by the grace of God if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
