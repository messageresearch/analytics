[0:00] [Music]
[0:02] now here's the IM that has wisdom draw
[0:05] write that out byas ailia and then when
[0:08] you draw a line on here and add the
[0:10] numbers and you got exactly what God
[0:12] Said the mark of the beast was
[0:16] [Music]
[0:17] 666 greetings friends in the matchless
[0:20] name of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[0:22] purpose of this video is to tell the
[0:23] number of the beast from Revelation 13:1
[0:28] 17 says or the number of his name and
[0:31] the Bible says for it is a number of a
[0:33] man so the Beast has a number that is a
[0:36] name of a man friends this number of
[0:39] course is 666 and in this video I'll
[0:42] explain why we believe God's Prophet
[0:44] brother William brandham taught this is
[0:45] the number of a future Pope that will be
[0:48] the person of the Antichrist hi friends
[0:50] I'm Jesse Smith pastor bride of Christ
[0:52] Fellowship here in akan Ohio USA and I
[0:55] defend the original Gospel of Jesus
[0:57] Christ that Christ revealed to St Paul
[0:59] then had to store through Martin Luther
[1:01] John Wesley and the late William
[1:02] brandham a true prophet of God 1909 to
[1:05] 1965 and also defend brother am's Godly
[1:08] Christian character so yes friends the
[1:10] number 666 is the number of the Pope
[1:12] we'll prove that very simply by the
[1:14] grace of God but first let's go over the
[1:17] three previous videos in this short
[1:19] little Series in the first video we
[1:20] looked at the mark of the beast from
[1:21] Cain to the present time Cain had the
[1:23] mark of the beast first it was a
[1:26] spiritual Mark first he left the
[1:27] presence of God with a reprobate mind
[1:29] God marked him physically but as far as
[1:31] I know he's the only one physically
[1:33] marked with the mark of the beast now
[1:34] during the Great Tribulation the second
[1:36] video showed that the mark can be taken
[1:38] in the right hand or the forehead it'll
[1:40] be a spiritual Mark first a mark in the
[1:42] right hand means to do the will of the
[1:45] Beast system the One World church and
[1:48] state system the mark in the forehead
[1:50] will be believing the doctrine of the
[1:53] false church or false Beast system which
[1:55] would be trinitarianism
[1:57] universalism we saw it recently at the
[2:00] Republican National Convention where one
[2:02] of the representatives from California
[2:04] prayed to the one true God the Hindu god
[2:07] I believe that's blasphemy but there you
[2:09] can see the unity of all the religions
[2:11] saying they all worship the same one
[2:13] true God of course that's wrong there's
[2:15] only one true God that's the Lord Jesus
[2:18] Christ the next video was about the mark
[2:20] of his name the Bible said the mark of
[2:23] the beast has a name of a man and of
[2:25] course that's the bishop of Rome the
[2:27] pope there were over 11 Idol for the
[2:30] pope listed in the catechism of the
[2:32] Catholic Church the Bible said you can
[2:34] take the mark of his name so taking any
[2:36] of those names of the Pope as your
[2:39] leader will be taken the mark of the
[2:41] beast there's also another element to it
[2:43] you can just take your church name of
[2:46] course real Holy Ghost filled Saints
[2:47] won't do that they won't live by a
[2:48] church name or the name of a pope they
[2:51] only live and do every word and deed in
[2:53] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:55] according to Colossians 3:17 the Bible
[2:57] called though the many names of the
[2:59] Beast system names of blasphemy the
[3:02] Beast was full of names of blasphemy we
[3:04] saw those are the names of any
[3:06] denomination that unites with the Roman
[3:08] Catholic church now for today's video
[3:10] we're looking at the number of the
[3:11] beast's name this portion is from my
[3:14] 2021 book as well Pages 594 and
[3:18] 595 let's start by looking at Revelation
[3:20] 13:1
[3:21] 16-17 and he causeth all both small and
[3:24] great rich and poor free and bond to
[3:26] receive a mark in their right hand or in
[3:27] their foreheads and that no man might
[3:30] buy or sell say that he had the Mark or
[3:32] the name of the Beast or the number of
[3:34] his name so this video is about that
[3:35] third and final description the number
[3:38] of his
[3:39] name Verse 18 here is wisdom let him
[3:41] that hath understanding count the number
[3:43] of the Beast for it is the number of a
[3:45] man and his number is 603 score
[3:49] and6 the third and final way of buying
[3:52] and selling during the Great Tribulation
[3:54] is through the number of the Beast the
[3:56] name of the Beast has a number for it's
[3:58] a number of a man and
[4:01] 666 many have guessed as to what the
[4:03] number 666 represents but there is one
[4:06] clear answer in
[4:07] Revelation since the Beast is the spirit
[4:10] of Rome the single man who is the head
[4:12] of the Roman Spirit seeking to unite all
[4:15] people under his leadership can be none
[4:17] other than the pope of the Roman
[4:19] Catholic
[4:21] Church some might ask how does a pope
[4:24] name equal
[4:25] 666 the title vicarius fili day not I
[4:29] could be saying that wrong I don't know
[4:31] Latin or as it means in Latin vicer of
[4:34] gods is added up using Roman numerals
[4:39] when the Roman numerals to Vicarious
[4:40] filet day is added up the sum is 666 as
[4:45] seen in this figure I call it figure 25
[4:47] in my book here's a screenshot of it
[4:49] note that u and v were used
[4:51] interchangeably during the Middle Ages
[4:54] while some contest the validity of the
[4:56] title vicaris fil Day saying its
[4:59] earliest appearance is found in a
[5:00] forgery and that's from the encyclopedia
[5:03] branica it's incontestable that the
[5:05] catechism of the Catholic Church exalts
[5:07] the Pope's office as Vicor of Christ
[5:10] even to this day so the Pope's title
[5:13] today is vicer of Christ that's very
[5:15] close to Vicor of gods Vicor translates
[5:18] to vicarius in Latin so that's the first
[5:21] proof the similarity to Vicor of Christ
[5:24] to vicer of gods the second proof is
[5:28] what we saw earlier if the Beast is the
[5:30] spirit of Rome the single man who's the
[5:32] head of the Roman Spirit has to be the
[5:34] Roman Catholic Church Pope and the third
[5:37] proof is that the pope has to be the
[5:39] Antichrist because there's 11 proofs
[5:42] that Rome is Mystery Babylon now there's
[5:44] at least 11 there's probably more I just
[5:45] did 11 in my 2021 book So based upon
[5:48] these three proofs it's very probable
[5:50] that the pope at some point in the past
[5:52] held the title vieras filet day Vicor of
[5:54] gods because it's nearly synonymous to
[5:57] the current title Vicor of Christ God
[5:59] Prophet brother randam taught this Roman
[6:01] numeral Edition numerous times he taught
[6:04] it 1960 and
[6:05] 1963 let's listen to a quote from the
[6:07] sardian church age brother Bram said
[6:10] vicaris f Day means instead of the Son
[6:12] of God and that's true that's what the
[6:14] word vicer means the word vicer means
[6:16] substitute or representative so the
[6:19] vicer of Christ means the substitute of
[6:21] Christ the representative of Christ or
[6:24] the representative of God and we know
[6:25] the pope is not the representative of
[6:27] God because he breaks most of God's word
[6:29] he breaks a lot of God's word let's
[6:32] listen to the quote VI or the vi vicaros
[6:37] AI adeli means instead of the Son of God
[6:42] now here's the IM it has wisdom draw
[6:44] write that out by caras ailia and then
[6:47] when you draw a line on here and add the
[6:49] numbers and you got exactly what God
[6:52] Said the mark of the beast was
[6:55] 666 car AIA now I've been in had been in
[7:00] the Vatican and the Triple Crown
[7:02] jurisdiction of hell heaven and
[7:05] Purgatory see seen the crown seen the
[7:08] vest SE right
[7:09] there here's another quote from the 10
[7:12] virgins and the 144,000 Jews in December
[7:15] 11th 1960 brother R again talks about
[7:18] the Vicor of the Son of God and the love
[7:20] brother R brings out this scripture
[7:22] Revelation
[7:23] 1317 brother R said it takes one of the
[7:26] gifts of the Holy Ghost wisdom to
[7:27] recognize that 66 six is the number of
[7:30] the Pope let's listen to the quote here
[7:32] is wisdom let him that has understanding
[7:35] count the numbers of the Beast for his
[7:37] number of a man and his number is 63
[7:40] score and6 which you know who that is
[7:43] it's a hierarchy of Rome Pope been right
[7:45] there see it myself know up over his uh
[7:48] place his throne as it was like to set
[7:51] the first bonfice up the third up at the
[7:53] beginning of the Catholic age here and
[7:55] up over there is bararia ailia dilia
[7:58] which means a B ER of the Son of God de
[8:01] did De see see the biker of the Son of
[8:06] God other words just like the Son of God
[8:08] sitting here on Earth all powers to
[8:10] change the Bible change anything he
[8:12] wants to therefore say hey oh Mary
[8:14] what's the pope say we'll have hail Mary
[8:16] that's
[8:17] said well we'll do so and so what the
[8:20] pop says that's it that's it a biker
[8:23] instead of the Son of God just recently
[8:25] he had that dog out that Mary was not
[8:27] buried and he got her grave and
[8:28] everything marked where she said no she
[8:30] rose again and resurrected the pope said
[8:32] that's it that's it that's infallible
[8:34] see the pope said so see bik her of the
[8:37] Son of God and said now anybody wants to
[8:40] know who the Beast is where this power
[8:42] comes from it said count the numbers of
[8:44] let them it has wisdom that's one of the
[8:46] gifts of the Holy Ghost is wisdom and he
[8:49] that has wisdom count the numbers man
[8:51] for it count the numbers of the Beast
[8:52] for it's the number of men and his
[8:53] number is 666 now you take the uh uh and
[8:58] spell that name out VI the and and just
[9:00] according to the words and draw a line
[9:02] out here and add up the Roman numerals
[9:05] and you'll find here you got
[9:09] 666 that's so we thank God for the
[9:12] wisdom of the Holy Ghost the wisdom of
[9:14] the holy ghost shows us what 666 means
[9:17] it means the Vicor of Christ the person
[9:20] who's apparently in the stad of Christ
[9:22] or in this case trying to take the place
[9:24] of Christ and is actually the Antichrist
[9:26] he has to come out of Rome because Rome
[9:28] is the Beast that Daniel Saul would rule
[9:31] at the end Rome is the iron the
[9:33] Protestants are the clay as brother Ram
[9:35] taught us in the church age book Rome
[9:37] was the legs and feet and Toes of
[9:40] Nebuchadnezzar's dream in Daniel chapter
[9:42] 2 Daniel interpreted the dream of
[9:45] Nebuchadnezzar the gold was Babylon
[9:48] silver was Ms and Persians the brass was
[9:51] the grecians and then the legs of iron
[9:54] and feet of iron and Clay was Rome and
[9:57] then the clay was Protestant
[10:00] ISM wisdom it's the first gift of the
[10:03] holy spirit in 1 Corinthians CH 12
[10:05] brother Ram said since it's listed first
[10:07] it's the most important of the gifts and
[10:08] here we see why it's so important it's
[10:10] the first gift and it helps people
[10:12] recognize who the Antichrist is if
[10:14] you're in a war you have to know who
[10:15] your enemy is so we see how God exalts
[10:18] wisdom as the first thing the first gift
[10:21] that we need and it recognize the
[10:23] Antichrist movement and that way we can
[10:25] overcome it by the word of God remember
[10:27] Proverbs 4:7 says wisdom is the the
[10:29] principal thing therefore get wisdom
[10:31] with all thy getting get understanding
[10:34] wisdom is the principal thing the Hebrew
[10:36] means the best thing the chief thing so
[10:38] wisdom is like the mind of Christ as
[10:40] Philippians chapter 2 tells us if we
[10:42] have the mind of Christ we'll cast down
[10:44] doctrines of devils and all the false
[10:46] teachings from the Beast system in
[10:49] closing friends hope this video is a
[10:51] Blessing by the grace of God I'll
[10:53] probably do one more video on this topic
[10:55] perhaps the image of the Beast by the
[10:57] grace of God or maybe another one about
[10:58] brother thus say the Lord's statements
[11:00] on the mark of the beast also want to
[11:02] say a few things if some people think
[11:04] Jerusalem is Mystery Babylon they're
[11:06] greatly mistaken I wrote about that also
[11:08] on page 569 and 570 in my book Jerusalem
[11:12] doesn't sit on many Waters as Rome does
[11:15] Jerusalem is never called Babylon in
[11:17] scripture whereas Peter refers to Rome
[11:19] as Babylon in 1 Peter 5113 third
[11:22] Revelation 183 requires mystery Babylon
[11:24] to have strong relationships to the
[11:26] kings of the earth and ties with all
[11:28] nations but Israel is despised by many
[11:30] nations and often suffers from bias and
[11:33] discrimination at the United Nations
[11:35] finally Myst Babylon is condemned a
[11:37] revelation 18:21 with prophecy that she
[11:39] will never be found or rebuilt after
[11:42] God's Wrath destroys her mystery Babylon
[11:44] has a expiration date but of course
[11:46] Jerusalem does not Jerusalem will be
[11:48] restored Jerusalem will be the center of
[11:50] the world during the Millennium and also
[11:52] the New Jerusalem from heaven will come
[11:54] down and sit right upon the current
[11:56] Earthly Jerusalem by God's grace many
[11:59] many Church fathers recognize mystery
[12:01] Babylon as the Roman Catholic Church as
[12:03] well and the pope as a future Antichrist
[12:05] such as tulan ireneus and Jerome along
[12:08] with Martin Luther John Knox John Calvin
[12:10] William Tindale and John Wickliffe to
[12:12] name a few remember the Bible gives us a
[12:14] great promise in James 1: 5 if any of
[12:17] you lack wisdom let him ask God that
[12:18] giveth to all men liberally and upth not
[12:21] and it shall be given him all God ask
[12:23] for in exchange for his wisdom is an
[12:26] honest selfless prayer requesting wisdom
[12:28] with the right motive so please share
[12:30] this video with someone if you know that
[12:32] they're seeking the wisdom of God in
[12:34] relation to the end times or the Beast
[12:36] or the number of the Beast the number
[12:38] 666 and so forth hopefully this video
[12:40] can be used as encouragement or a
[12:42] catalyst so the person can receive the
[12:44] wisdom of God and therefore recognize
[12:46] the number of his beast and come out of
[12:48] the Beast system according to Revelation
[12:50] 18:4 come out of her my people that you
[12:53] be not partakers of our sins and plagues
[12:55] our desire is to see people saved by the
[12:57] blood of our Lord Jesus Christ and come
[12:59] out of the Beast
[13:01] system if you have any questions
[13:02] concerns or testimonies about this video
[13:04] please contact
[13:06] me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[13:09] the desire of your heart
