TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] There's three stages of their journey. They left Egypt under justification believing the word. They separate themselves from the Egyptians and come out. They cross the Red Sea and kill the things behind them which was sanctification &gt;&gt; through the blood that kills all human desires and evil. But the third stage was when they cross Jordan. into the promised land where their inheritance laid. &gt;&gt; Greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of this video is to show eight Old Testament types of the three works of grace and specifically we'll look at the lives of seven individuals from the Old Testament and we'll look at Israel as an eighth example. God's prophet, brother William Miriam Brandom spent a lot of time with this thought in 1961. There's over 30 quotes where brother Brandham placed justification, sanctification, and the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the life of Abraham. So, let's make a few points here by the grace of God as we get started. The first point is that the three works of grace is a very biblical teaching. It's part of the mystery of Christ in you, the hope of glory. God's presence grows into your life, into your soul in three steps. Justification, sanctification, and the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Notice it is grace that does the work. This is an important point because accusers of brother Brandham and those who reject the three works of grace are not listening or they're not paying attention or they're not really understanding what we're saying. It is God's grace, God's favor, God's unmmerited favor that works in our life to bring more of his spirit and presence into our lives until our soul is completely baptized with the Holy Ghost. 1 Corinthians 15 speaks of this. Paul says, "It wasn't I that worked, but it was the grace of God which was with me." Paul said, "He labored more than all the apostles." He said, "Not I, but the grace of God that was with me." So grace causes people to labor. Philippians 2:13 says the same where Paul said, "It's God who works in you mightily." So the three works of grace are God's working. We're just yielding. The Bible says in Romans chapter 6, I believe we just yield to the Holy Spirit. We must yield our members. God is doing the work. St. Paul also showed the three works of grace in 1 Corinthians 6:9-11. He gave numerous sins that cause people to not inherit the kingdom of God, such as fornication, homosexuality, adultery, and others. But Paul said, "You're washed. You're justified. You're sanctified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the spirit of our God." So the truth is hiding in that scripture. justified, sanctified, and then baptized with the spirit of God. And it is the spirit of God doing each step. The spirit of God justifies you. The spirit of God sanctifies you, and the spirit of God baptizes your soul with the Holy Ghost. Even as Jesus said in Acts 1 verse 5, he said, "Wait in Jerusalem until you're endued with power from on high and receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost." Jesus also taught a parable of the kingdom of God coming into the believer in three steps in Mark 4 26- 29. It's the three stages of the wheat plant which brother Ram considered his masterpiece as we recently showed a video about that by God's grace. Notice the kingdom comes in three stages and man doesn't understand how. We don't understand how God does it but God justifies us. God sanctifies us. Then God fills us with the Holy Ghost. We just yield to him. We just love him. We just worship him. and we just repent of our sins and God does it. We don't know how God does it by his grace. And then Jesus said in Luke 17:21, "The kingdom of God is within you." So the kingdom has three stages, three works of grace. The kingdom of God is within you. And then Paul said, "We have received this kingdom which cannot be moved in Hebrews 12:28." So it's undeniable the Bible teaches the three works of grace in the New Testament. Here's a chart I have in my 2021 book. It's on page 301. It shows the three processes of eight different processes. Three steps to natural birth, three steps to your spiritual birth, Israel's exodus, the tabernacle's cleansing had three courts to cleanse, the earth's cleansing, Ezekiel prophesied of the three works of grace in Ezekiel 36:26, and 27. Jesus' parable, the wheat plant, and Jesus said he's the way, the truth, and the life. Notice three stages, three steps. The second point is that this relates to the recent video on the spirit of burning. Remember, Old Testament saints could never get the third work of grace, the baptism of the Holy Ghost in their soul. So, as that video on the spirit of burning showed, Old Testament believers could experience two works, justification and sanctification. John 7:37-39 says, "The Holy Ghost could not be given until Jesus was glorified. But yet, we saw Bezale was filled with the spirit of God. That's that can only mean in his human spirit, not in his soul. And remember, in this video, we're showing the three works of grace foreshadowed in the lives of Old Testament saints. That third work is just a foreshadowing. That third work is not the filling of the soul for the Old Testament saints with the seven examples we'll look at here in a moment. Third point I want to make is that you can find lots of other videos I have about this topic. The video on people saved but not born again. I have a short series on the three works of grace. The 12 terms for the baptism of the Holy Ghost is helpful as well. And then the entire audio book for chapter 6 of my 2021 book would be helpful as well. And the final point is that accusers of brother Brandham despise this teaching in particular because it shows they're not sanctified and they don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost. We don't know how these accusers can believe they're filled with the Holy Ghost at justification when their habits haven't even been cleaned out. My question has always been, how can these people who freshly get saved or get saved for the first time, how can they be filled with the spirit of God and yet disagree on so many things the spirit of God teaches in his holy word? Like women preachers, like women cutting their hair, like women wearing pants, like men being married two or three or four times. And like brother Ram said, how you going to be part of a kingdom and disagree with the king? And the Lord Jesus Christ is the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords. And the Lord Jesus Christ's will is in the Holy Bible. So how can they be part of a kingdom and disagree with the king? &gt;&gt; How do you get into this kingdom? You're born into it. &gt;&gt; How do you know you keep How would you belong into a kingdom and disagree with the king? &gt;&gt; You be and the king is the word. In the beginning was the word and the word is with God and the word was God and the word is made flesh and dwelt among us. The same yesterday, today and forever. &gt;&gt; Remember friends, brother Ram said the three works of grace was his message. He said it in the rising of the sun 1965 Easter morning or resurrection morning by the grace of God. So we know this is a very important topic to God's prophet brother Brandham and it is for the bride of Jesus Christ as well. Let's listen to the quote. &gt;&gt; She dreamed a dream that I was standing here by the side of a three step and I was standing preaching to everybody that they must walk up these three steps before they hit the highway. And on the highways, a little pearly like white line runs right into the the the doors of heaven to the pearly gates. And that pearl had been stretched out to the top of these steps. If that ain't my message exactly today, justification, sanctification, baptism, and I would think that a person has to come by these three steps to be able to walk that highway. &gt;&gt; So the first example we use is Israel as a nation. Brother Ram taught in As I Was with Moses that Israel's exodus out of Egypt was in three stages. First, the Exodus parting through the Red Sea, which also typed water baptism. The journey in the wilderness was the second stage, and the third stage was Joshua taking Israel into Canaan when they're crossing Jordan. So, the first work is Exodus 14, crossing the Red Sea. The second work is the wilderness. So everything from Exodus 15 all the way to Joshua 3:5 where Joshua said, "Sanctify yourself cuz tomorrow we're going over over Jordan." It's also helpful to see Deuteronomy 8:2. God had Moses tell the people he took them in the wilderness to humble them and to test them and to try them. And that's exactly what sanctification is all about. causing us to be humble, giving us a new spirit, new way of thinking, testing us and showing us what's in our hearts so that we can repent of it in order to be filled with the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And crossing Jordan into Canaan was also in Joshua chapter 3 at the end of the chapter by God's grace. So let's listen to the quote from as I was with Moses. &gt;&gt; Justification they left Egypt. There's three stages of their journey. They left Egypt under justification believing the word. They separated themselves from the Egyptians and come out. They cross the Red Sea and kill the things behind them which was sanctification &gt;&gt; through the blood that kills all human desires of evil. &gt;&gt; Second stage of the journey. But the third stage was when they crossed Jordan into the promised land &gt;&gt; where their inheritance laid &gt;&gt; their inheritance severe in Egypt. So God blessed them in Egypt. &gt;&gt; Second example is the first individual. Look at the life of Abraham. Brother Ram taught he went through the three works of grace in type in numerous messages. I think it's most clear in Abraham's grace covenant from Middletown March 17th 1961. So the first work of grace is Abraham responding to God's call in Genesis 12. You can see he left of Chaldis. So that shows he had a change of heart. He had repentance. He left his place of origin to obey the word of God. The second work is the purification all the way from Genesis 12 to Genesis 16 or the beginning of Genesis 17. We'd say brother Ram highlights though Genesis 15 because there's a blood sacrifice. God renews the covenant with Abraham. And so that kind of goes with the scripture about water, blood, spirit from the book of first John. But since we know sanctification is an entire process, I would take Genesis 12:6 all the way to the beginning of Genesis 17 as Abraham's sanctification. And then the third work of grace would be Abraham circumcised because it's called a token. The circumcision in his flesh was called a token in Genesis 17:9-14. Also, we see that there's a spiritual principle to this in Romans 2:29 about the circumcision of the heart. So, let's listen to these two quotes. We'll listen to Abraham's grace covenant where he talks about three works of grace and then we'll talk about how Abraham's circumcision in his flesh was a foreshadowing of the token in our souls, the baptism of the Holy Ghost, the seal of the Holy Ghost according to Ephesians 4:30. Let's listen to the quotes. Justification Abraham justification Genesis 12 Martin Luther to the seed of Abraham sanctification Genesis 15 confirmation of the covenant his seed of Abraham John Wesley sanctification Abraham had an outlet to draw from his weak condition strength. God's own strength. Do you see it? &gt;&gt; How many sees say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God's own strength nursed through a promise. [Music] &gt;&gt; He give it to the Pentecostals. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost drawing God's own life right out into them as he did it naturally there. as a spirit shall hear. &gt;&gt; See, to Abraham and his seed after him. You get what I mean? Now, now remember, the church is still advancing. Long come Pentecost with the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Exactly right. But now we want to stop the Pentecostal church just a minute. Each of those organized and died in their tracks. Now I want you to look use the scripture the fourth and fifth verse after he had called him justification sanctified him through the blood of the covenant give him his own life in 17th chapter the baptism of the holy ghost. Now, what comes next in Israel? Some of you Bible scholars, the placing of a son. And God had Abraham circumcised and confirmation obviously. And what was it? What is the Holy Ghost? Somebody tell me what the Holy Ghost is for. It's a sign. Is that right? What was circumcision? A sign. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A sign. God give a sign that he had accepted Abraham for circumcision. And when you say, "I believe God. I believe Jesus Christ." Then God gives you the baptism of the Holy Ghost as a sign that he's accepted your faith. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And then you're sealed in the kingdom of God. Not till the next revival, but until the day of your redemption. &gt;&gt; Ephesians 4:30. Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby you're sealed until the day of your redemption. &gt;&gt; There you are. &gt;&gt; The third example is the life of Jacob. I don't have specific quotes from brother Ara where he says that Jacob went through the three works of grace. I'm using Abraham as my foundation and then I'm looking by the help of the Holy Spirit to rightly divide the word of God and see these three steps or three experiences in other believers lives in the Old Testament. But I do have a quote from 1958 where brother Ram said when Jacob wrestled the angel that was like how we received the baptism of the Holy Ghost. So I'm starting with that. I started with that as that was Jacob's baptism of the Holy Ghost experience in type. Of course he didn't receive it in the soul. So then with the liberty I have as a minister of the gospel trying to rightly divide the word of truth. The first work of grace I see in Jacob's life is when he sees the Lord, he receives the covenant, makes a vow in Genesis 28:es 10- 22. It's a story of Jacob's latter. The second work of grace would likely be his dream from God telling him return to Canaan in Genesis 31:10-13. And also you see that continuation of sanctification until he humbles himself and prays for victory over fear of Esau in Genesis 32:9-23. I love that prayer. Jacob says, "I'm not worthy of the least of your mercy." So here he gets so humble he realizes he's nothing. So he's getting totally sanctified. And then we'd say the third work of grace is Jacob wrestling with the angel given a new walk. The limping prince we'd say. And the Bible said anyone that's in Christ is a new creature. Genesis 32:24-32. Let's listen to the quote. &gt;&gt; And of Jacob on his way with his wife and his children, he heard a message coming that Esau with a great army was coming to meet him. And he began to think on his ways of way he had done. Esau cheated him and it drove him to prayer all night long. He wrestled with the angel of the Lord. I trust tonight that man and women, boys and girls, who's neglected the baptism of the Holy Ghost, you don't know how near you are to home. &gt;&gt; I trust that you'll put purpose in your heart that you'll wrestle with the angel of the Lord and not let him go until you're blessed. &gt;&gt; Fourth example is Joseph from the book of Genesis. Again, I don't have a quote on this as far as Joseph having three works of grace, but I can see it just like I can see it in Abraham's life and Jacob's life. I wrote about this in my 2021 book on pages 307 308. I believe the first work of grace where we can see Joseph is obeying the Lord is his faith. Joseph's faith trusted God's way for his life as he unashamedly shared his dreams with his family in Genesis 37:es 5-11. I believe Joseph is a special example of how you can see the eight steps in the stature perfect man in Joseph's life. This is on page 307 308 of my book. You can see faith in his life, then virtue, then knowledge, then temperance, then patience, then godliness, then brotherly kindness. So I would say all those steps are sanctification, virtue, all the way down to brotherly kindness. So my choice as Joseph receiving the Holy Ghost in type would be when Joseph lovingly embraced his father Jacob when he came to abide with him in Egypt in Genesis 46:29. This is a father-son embrace that foreshadow Christians uniting with their loving father their father God because God is love according to book of first John. God is love and love is charity. The fifth example is the life of Moses. And again, I don't have a quote from brother Brandham on the three works of grace, but I'm rightly dividing the word of God. I do have a quote where brother Brandham says his burning bush experience was like the baptism of the Holy Ghost. So, I started with the third work. If I know that's the third work, then I got to go find the scripture where he had two other works of grace. So, I'd say the first work was corded in Acts 7:23 about Moses's life in Exodus where it said it came into his heart to visit his brethren at 40 years old. So seems like Moses started feeling God's pull at about 40 years old and he visited his brethren but of course he only had education from Egypt. So he smoked an Egyptian. He had faith to stand up for his people but he didn't have the character. So the first work of grace would be when he went to his brethren and tried to tell them he would be the deliverer but then failed. The second work of grace is the whole time he fled from Egypt and spent all the time in the wilderness of Midian as a shepherd. had a wife and two children, two sons. Then the third work would be the burning bush. He's put into service at 80 years old according to Exodus 7:7. Let's listen to the quote. Oh, that little sacred place that where man can meet God as Moses had on the back side of the desert after 40 years of good schooling, the highest degrees that be could be given, knowing his position as a deliverer and as a Hebrew, and know that God called him for the commission. And yet he knowed more about God in five minutes in the presence of that burning bush than all of his 40 years of theology taught him. He was in the presence of God. And every man that goes to the field to preach the gospel should never leave until he had that back of the desert experience. No one could explain that out of your mind. No matter how much they twist the scriptures and say this, that or the other. If you've ever met God face to face in the true baptism of the Holy Spirit, there's not enough theologians in the world to ever erase it from your memory. &gt;&gt; Something happened. &gt;&gt; You were there. &gt;&gt; When a man gets that place, there is no one can explain it away from him. The sixth example is Joshua. Again, I don't have a quote on this. I'm just doing my best here to rightly divide the word of truth. I would say the first work of grace, the first sign we get that he's moved by God into relationship with God is Exodus 33:11. The Bible said Joshua stayed in the tabernacle. And it looks like he stayed in the tabernacle to spend time with God and worship God. So here we see he has a hunger for the Lord. So I could be wrong, but that's my guess on that was his justification. So then all the time after that until Joshua chapter 5 would be his sanctification. We can clearly see a sanctification happening in Joshua 3:5 where he commands all the people to be sanctified before crossing over Jordan. So we can see that's the finalization of his sanctification process. Now the third work of grace is in Joshua 5 and it could be one of two things. It could be the circumcision where Joshua 5:8 says all the males were circumcised aresh. Or if Joshua was already circumcised, then perhaps it was him meeting the captain of the host of the Lord because it's very similar to the burning bush experience Moses had in Joshua 5:14-15. So I would lean toward Joshua meeting the captain of the host as his third work of grace in type because brother Ram said that was Moses's Pentecostal experience. we'd say meeting God at the burning bush. He knew more about God in 5 minutes than all the 40 years in Egypt. The seventh example is Gideon. I preached a series on Gideon, I think around 2014. And again, I don't have quotes from Brother Brandon on this, so I'm just rightly dividing the word of truth. The first work of grace where Gideon seems drawn to God, it seems like, is when an angel comes to him in Judges 6 1- 24. He's called a mighty man of valor. Then he made a and then he made a sacrifice unto God and worshiped God with the angel being present. So now it seems Gideon has a real faith in God. The second work of grace is all the time from then till verse 33. But the main display of his sanctification is him breaking down his father's altars or personal purification or we'd say the purification of his home, his habits in his home. Judges 6:25-32. So Gideon's father had a habit of worshiping these idols. Well, he destroyed all the habits in his house. He cleaned out his house. Seems similar to getting all the leaven out of a house, cleaning it out. So, we can see sanctification going in Gideon's life. And then the third work of grace is very clear. We'd say Judges 6:34, "The spirit of the Lord comes on him and he blows a trumpet for the people gathering unto him to be a part of God's army." Beautiful type. And the eighth and final example is King David from the Old Testament. Again, I'm doing my best here to rightly divide the word of truth. There's certainly three times David was anointed. The first is when he's anointed among his brethren with the promise that would he would be king in 1st Samuel 16:13. And then I would believe that the second work of grace when he was anointed Judah's king only in 2 Samuel 2:4 and he was king over Judah only, only one tribe for about 7 years. And then the third work of grace was when he was anointed king over all Israel in 2 Samuel 5:3 all 12 tribes. So when someone receives the baptism of the Holy Ghost, they're put into service, full service by the power of God as we see on the day of Pentecost. So it seems like David being given power over all the tribes of Israel is a foreshadowing of the believer who receives the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he brings all enemies under his feet and gets into service for the Lord Jesus Christ. In closing, hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God. I was inspired by that quote from Abraham's grace covenant 1961 about Abraham's three works of grace. And then over the years of preaching, pastoring for over 19 years now, I've come across these other Bible characters and noticed three stages in their life. Praise God that he justifies us. He declares us righteous as we wish to be. He sanctifies us, cleans out our heart, our mind, our daily habits, and then he fills us with his Holy Ghost in our souls. It's a tremendous blessing. Jesus said, "You'll be witnesses unto me, unto Jerusalem, Judea, and the uttermost parts of the world when you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost." So, thank God that we're witnesses of the truth of God Almighty, the baptism of the Holy Ghost, the power of God, this end time message in which the mysteries of God are finished. Praise God that Elijah has come and restored all things according to Matthew 17:1. Friends, keep searching the scriptures, for in them we have eternal life, and they are they that testify of our Lord Jesus Christ. God's true Bible doctrine, such as the three works of grace, the Godhead, water, baptism, serpent, seed, marriage, and divorce. They can withstand all the attacks of Brother Ram's accusers, or any accuser of the Bible who denies the truth of the message of the hour. Thank God for the message of the hour. We're standing on solid rock. If you have any questions, concerns, or testimonies about this video, please contact me. God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart. Very happy to be here this afternoon. And again, in defense of the gospel of Jesus Christ to bring the good tidings, the good news that Jesus raised from the dead, living among man today, his church. The same Jesus that was yesterday will be today and forever. He never failed. [Music]
