TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] the first thing comes when he starts descending from the heaven there's a shout what is it is a message to get the people together a message comes forth first now L trimming time rise and trim your lamp greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to show four Bible verses that God's Prophet brother William Mar and brandham used to support his teaching that his ministry was the shout of 1 Thessalonians 4:16 the three steps in the Rapture order the shout voice Trump so by the grace of God we'll cover those verses in this video hi friends I'm Jesse Smith pastor bride of Christ Fellowship here in akan Ohio USA and I defend the original Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ that he revealed to St Paul then had to restore through Martin Luther John Wesley and the late Prophet brother William Marian brandham and also defend brother bram's Godly Christian character this video is sort of a follow-up to last week's video called is revelation 10 1- 7 fulfilled it was released November 23rd 2024 and as you might recall I made that video based upon a request from a saint and that was my humble opinion about Revelation 10 1-7 being fulfilled that's what I believe by the grace of God I'm open to correction though as always and so I thought this would be a good follow-up video to show the four Bible verses that brother RAM used to tell the saints that his ministry was the shout of the shout voice Trump all four of these verses come from the same sermon the Rapture brother BR preached it December 4th 1965 so let's begin with the first quote it's from paragraphs 1030 through 132 brother Ram said what is a shout it's the message going forth the living bread of life bringing forth the bride then he said in Amos 3:7 he would do nothing on Earth until he first revealed it to his servants the prophets so the first Bible verse is Amos 3:7 it says surely the Lord God will do nothing but he reveal his secret unto his servants the prophets and we know brother R used this verse many times to describe his ministry and of course the secrets brother random revealed were the revelations of the Seven Seals let's listen to the quote about Amos 3:7 three things happens a voice a shout a voice a trumpet has to happen before Jesus appears now a shout Jesus does all three of them when he's he's he's descending shout what is the shout it's the message amen going forth first the living bread of life bringing forth the bride now God has a way of doing things and he never changes his policy right he never changes his he's an unchanging God and Amos 3:7 he said he would do nothing on the earth until first he revealed it to his servants the prophets and just as certain as he promised it he will do it then in paragraph 132 brother R lists the second scripture Malachi 4 of course he's referring to Malachi 4:5 and6 he said but we're promised in the last days according to Malachi 4 that there should be a return again a prophet in the land Malachi 4:5 and6 says behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children that phrase is John the Baptist according to Luke 1:17 he turned the hearts of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers that phrase is the ministry of God's Prophet brother brandom he's turning our hearts back to the apostolic fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse let's listen to the quote from paragraph 132 according to Malachi 4 now we've come through the church ages but we're promised in the last days according to Malachi 4 that there would be a return again a prophet in the land that's right that's right the third verse brother I'm us is in paragraph 142 he says a shout what is it it is is a message to get the people together now lamp trimming time rise and trim your lamps so his third verse is Matthew 25:7 let's read that it says then all those virgins arose and trim their lamps of course trimming the lamp refers to sanctification and the oil of course is the baptism of the Holy Ghost oil represents the Holy Ghost according to Zechariah 4 now let's listen to the quote about lamp triming time the first thing comes when he starts descending from the heaven there's a shout what is it is a message to get the people together a message comes forth first now lamp trimming time rise and trim your lamps what watch was that the seven amen not the six to seven behold the bridegroom cometh rise and trim your lamps and they did some of them found they didn't even have any or in their L the fourth and final scripture is Luke 17 and we believe brother r referring to Luke 17:30 so let's read Luke 17:30 even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed brother RAM used this verse to explain that the Lord Jesus Christ was using him as a prophet to give the sign of discernment the Messiah sign the prophetic sign of Discerning the thoughts and intents of the heart just as the Lord Jesus discern the thoughts and intents of the heart in John chapter 1 and John chapter 4 Jesus told the woman at the well The Secret of how many husbands she'd had and then she knew Jesus was the prophet the Messiah the same was true with brother branam brother Bram would reveal the thoughts and intents of and secrets of people's hearts and then they would know he was a prophet sent from God brother Bram of course is just a man a son of man but the Lord Jesus Christ was the son of man the god man brother Ram was just a sinner saved by grace but he had the gift to be a prophet who could discern the thoughts and Tents of the Heart by the power of the Holy Ghost so here's the the quote brother Ram said it's Malachi 4 time what he promised is Luke 17 it's all those prophecy that it can be perfectly set in order for this day in the scripture we see it living right there let's listen to the quote about Luke 17 well it's lamp treaming time it's Malachi 4 time what you it's Luke 17 it's it's eyes all those prophecy that's it can perfectly set in order for this day in the scripture we see it living right there amen so friends those are the four Bible verses brother RAM used for his teaching on the shout that his ministry was the shout going forth to get the people ready for the Rapture so when people ask me what I believe about the shout these are the four Bible verses I would give to support that based upon what brother Bram said by the grace of God one more thing I want to share is that there are two other quotes where brother Ram talks about the shout voice Trump and he gives some other details in 1965 on November 27th I have heard but now I see one week before he preached the Rapture sermon he said there's going to be a clap of Thunder someday and the Son of God shall descend from heaven with a shout and the voice of an archangel and the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise this is an interesting quote because he says a clap of Thunder but brother Ram doesn't give any Bible scripture and so then about a week later brother Ram gave the four Bible verses that we've gone over regarding the shout so it's interesting quote but again no Bible verses and so we're doing our best to understand Bible verses that refer to the shout that explain the shout of the shout voice Trump dear G in this solemn moment it's going to be a time like this when there really will be a clap of Thunder someday and the Son of God shall descend from the heavens with the Shout with the voice of the Archangel and the Trump of God the dead in Christ shall rise and then there's one other scripture brother random uses with the shout voice Trump it's Matthew 24:40 it says then shall two be in the field and the one should be taken and the other left brother R quotes the scripture in 1958 the sudden secret going away the church so a sermon about the Rapture the pre-tribulation Rapture so brother R spoke this about 7 years before he preached the Rapture sermon from 1965 so it's very interesting to see this now personally I believe Matthew 24:40 is for the Trump of God the third and final step of the shout voice Trump but that's just my humble opinion but it's interesting to see how brother Ram uses scripture in connection with the shout voice Trump let's listen to the quote one will be in the field working daytime the other in the bed sleeping on the other side of the world it'll be a universal Rapture and it will come with the Shout with the voice of the Archangel and the Trump of God shall sound in the dead and Christ shall rise and Shall be Called away secretly oh I love that in closing friends hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God again it was on my heart just to show those Bible verses that support why I believe the shout is is brother Ram's Ministry brother RAM used those four verses those are all familiar verses to us to those who follow the ministry of God's Prophet brother brandom so with all of our teaching and all of our beliefs we want to go back to the scripture for it so I thought this video would be helpful to show people the scriptures we would use when teaching about the shout voice Trump if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
