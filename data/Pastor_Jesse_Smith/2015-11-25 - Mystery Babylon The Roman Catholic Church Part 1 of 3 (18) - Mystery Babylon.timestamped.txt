[0:13] Greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:16] of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of
[0:18] this video is to answer the question, is
[0:20] mystery Babylon the Roman Catholic
[0:22] Church?
[0:24] Our answer is yes. We believe the Bible
[0:26] and history teach that the Roman
[0:28] Catholic Church is mystery Babylon as
[0:31] thoroughly detailed throughout the
[0:32] Bible. But specifically taught in
[0:35] Revelation chapters 17 and 18.
[0:39] But first, we want to clearly state that
[0:40] we are not against the people that are
[0:42] trapped inside the Roman Catholic Church
[0:44] system. We have friends and family
[0:46] members that are Roman Catholic. We are
[0:48] against the system, power, and numerous
[0:51] false teachings of the Roman Catholic
[0:53] Church. And this video was made with a
[0:55] pure and loving desire to resound
[0:57] Revelation 18:es 4 and 5 and call God's
[1:01] people out of the Roman Catholic Church
[1:03] system and into the true church, the
[1:06] Holy Ghostfilled bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:09] And I heard another voice from heaven,
[1:11] saying, "Come out of her, my people,
[1:13] that ye be not partakers of her sins,
[1:16] and that ye receive not of her plagues.
[1:18] For her sins have reached unto heaven,
[1:20] and God hath remembered her iniquities.
[1:23] [Music]
[1:25] As we begin, please know that the Roman
[1:27] Catholic Church is the only church that
[1:29] meets all 14 of the Bible descriptions
[1:32] for Mystery Babylon that we will cover
[1:34] on this video. No other person, church,
[1:38] or institution even comes close to
[1:41] meeting all these 14 Bible requirements
[1:43] that we'll cover on this video for being
[1:46] Mystery Babylon.
[1:48] May the Holy Spirit grant you wisdom to
[1:50] recognize beyond a shadow of a doubt who
[1:53] this mysterious mother church is that
[1:56] you might get victory over her false
[1:58] doctrines, over her idolatries and man
[2:01] worship like the saints described in
[2:03] Revelation 15:es 1-3.
[2:12] Mystery
[2:15] [Music]
[2:18] Babylon.
[2:22] We begin at Revelation 17:5, which tells
[2:25] us the name of this woman, Mystery
[2:27] Babylon. The Roman Catholic Church is
[2:30] the modern-day Babylon because it
[2:32] presents a false path to heaven that is
[2:35] contrary to the Bible and brings great
[2:37] confusion to what exactly is the truth
[2:39] of God as we will soon show through
[2:42] their false doctrines. Just as the city
[2:44] of Babylon in Genesis 11:es 1-9 was a
[2:49] man-made way to try to get to heaven.
[2:53] The word Babylon means confusion. And
[2:56] God is not the author of confusion
[2:58] according to 1 Corinthians 14:33.
[3:01] The only way to not be confused is to
[3:03] know the truth. And Jesus said the Bible
[3:06] is the truth according to John 17:17.
[3:09] And this truth sets us free from all
[3:12] error according to John 8:32.
[3:15] Babylon began in the book of Genesis.
[3:18] And the spirit of Babylon is seen
[3:19] throughout the entire Bible and ends up
[3:22] in the book of Revelation. Most
[3:24] specifically described in chapters 17
[3:26] and 18 which deal with this church,
[3:29] Mystery Babylon.
[3:31] Mystery Babylon as a woman and a mother.
[3:35] Revelation 17:es 3 and 5 describe
[3:39] mystery Babylon as a woman and a mother.
[3:42] Let's first discuss the woman
[3:44] description. The wisdom of God teaches
[3:46] Bible readers that a woman is symbolic
[3:48] of a church in scripture. This symbolism
[3:51] is seen through two examples, the people
[3:53] of Israel and the New Testament church,
[3:56] referred to as the bride or wife of
[3:58] Christ. Israel was called the church in
[4:01] the wilderness in Acts 7:38 and was
[4:03] likened unto a woman in many cases, but
[4:06] most easily seen in the entire chapter
[4:08] of Ezekiel 16. In this chapter, God
[4:12] called Israel harlot unto him, and
[4:14] Israel's sister Samaria had also been
[4:17] involved in abominations and whoredoms
[4:19] just as Israel had.
[4:22] The second example is a New Testament
[4:24] church referred to as the bride or wife
[4:27] of Christ in Revelation 21:9 and
[4:30] Revelation 19:7.
[4:32] This New Testament church is also
[4:34] symbolized as a woman and is most easily
[4:37] seen in Ephesians 5:es 22-33
[4:41] as St. Paul teaches that a husband is to
[4:43] represent Christ and that a wife is to
[4:46] represent the New Testament church.
[4:49] Next, this woman or church in Revelation
[4:51] 17 was called a mother and clearly
[4:54] represents the original or first church
[4:56] as the word mother signifies. In this
[4:59] case, it would be the first organized
[5:01] Christian church, which was the Roman
[5:03] Catholic Church. The Roman Catholic
[5:05] Church unashamedly claims to be the
[5:07] mother church. The church from which
[5:09] every church took its start.
[5:14] The Roman Catholic Church very well may
[5:16] be the first or mother church, but only
[5:19] by the fact that is the first to
[5:21] organize and be led by man rather than
[5:24] by God. We believe the true church of
[5:26] the living God, never denominated or
[5:29] organized like the Roman Catholic Church
[5:31] did. Every Holy Ghostfilled believer can
[5:34] belong to the true original church today
[5:37] that actually started on the day of
[5:38] Pentecost in Acts chapter 2. The Roman
[5:41] Catholic Church is not that true Acts 2
[5:44] church. Instead, they are the mother of
[5:46] denominationalism and tradition-based
[5:49] worship, which ultimately was called
[5:51] vain worship according to Jesus in
[5:53] Matthew 15:9.
[5:58] In Revelation 23, the Bible also teaches
[6:02] that the mother church, the Roman
[6:04] Catholic Church, has daughters. All
[6:06] churches that follow denomination or
[6:08] those that teach traditional creeds of
[6:10] men, such as the three-person Trinity
[6:12] doctrine, for one example, are daughters
[6:15] of the mother because they behave just
[6:17] like their mother, denying the plain
[6:19] truth of the scripture, and both add and
[6:22] take away from the Holy Bible.
[6:25] Since most churches confess faith in a
[6:28] supposed trinity, a threeperson God,
[6:30] which is completely unscriptural and
[6:33] ultimately promotes polytheism, most
[6:35] churches today are partaking in the
[6:37] false doctrine of the mother church and
[6:40] are thus daughter churches because they
[6:42] have also added to the word of God like
[6:44] the mother church. Please view our video
[6:47] on the seven reasons why the trinity
[6:49] doctrine is wrong.
[6:53] Truly, most churches have fulfilled the
[6:55] scripture of Ezekiel 16:44.
[6:59] As the mother is, so is her daughter.
[7:04] Just as the Roman Catholic Church added
[7:06] to the Bible and created a threeperson
[7:09] God with a false triune baptism in the
[7:12] titles father, Son, Holy Ghost instead
[7:15] of the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. So
[7:17] have most churches, whether
[7:18] denominational or non-denominational,
[7:21] also partaken of the same false
[7:23] doctrines, and thus are daughters of the
[7:26] mother harlot,
[7:28] sits on many waters.
[7:32] According to Revelation 17 1-15, the
[7:36] Roman Catholic Church sits on many
[7:38] waters, which the Bible interprets for
[7:40] us as being people, multitudes, nations,
[7:44] and tongues.
[7:46] The Roman Catholic Church sits on or has
[7:48] influence upon many peoples, multitudes,
[7:51] nations, and tongues. Here are the facts
[7:53] about the Roman Catholic Church. 17% of
[7:57] the world population consider themselves
[7:59] Catholic, over 1.2 billion people. The
[8:03] Roman Catholic Church has over 222,000
[8:05] parishes worldwide. And there are
[8:08] parishes in nearly every country on
[8:10] Earth.
[8:12] Nearly every nation has either
[8:13] diplomatic or other political relations
[8:16] with the Holy Sea.
[8:18] Sits on seven mountains or hills.
[8:23] Revelation 17:9 teaches that this church
[8:26] or woman sits on seven mountains or
[8:29] hills. The city of Rome, which is the
[8:31] home of the Vatican, is famous for
[8:33] having seven hills on which the ancient
[8:35] city of Rome was built.
[8:43] Seven hills of Rome. Group of hills on
[8:45] or about which the ancient city of Rome
[8:47] was built.
[8:52] Some people say that the seven hills
[8:53] reference from Revelation 17:9 could
[8:57] refer to a different location and not
[8:59] Rome. While it is true that other cities
[9:01] may have seven hills, such as Istanbul,
[9:04] Turkey, no other city than Rome, can
[9:06] meet all the other 13 requirements
[9:08] needed to be considered mystery Babylon,
[9:11] the mother of harlots.
