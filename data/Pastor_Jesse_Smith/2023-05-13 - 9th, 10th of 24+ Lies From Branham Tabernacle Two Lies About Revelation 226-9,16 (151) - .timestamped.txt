[0:00] [Music]
[0:05] that's good but that is just that's just
[0:08] being able to read
[0:09] the Tabernacle because
[0:22] these people claim to believe every word
[0:24] that you say to be true but they don't
[0:27] I don't believe that their own actions
[0:29] prove that they don't
[0:33] greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:36] of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of
[0:39] this video is to continue the series on
[0:41] the 24 or more lies coming out of
[0:45] Branham Tabernacle located in
[0:46] Jeffersonville
[0:47] first let's review the first eight lies
[0:50] before moving on to the ninth and tenth
[0:53] lies
[0:54] the first lie is every word on brother
[0:56] bram's tapes is thus saith the Lord the
[0:59] second lie is all the answers are on
[1:01] brother Rams tapes
[1:03] the third Lie Is We must unquestionably
[1:06] believe every word on brother branham's
[1:08] tapes even if brother random lied
[1:11] the fourth lie is that preachers have to
[1:14] catch a false Vision that is also a
[1:17] denominational mandate that preachers
[1:19] have to play the tapes as the primary
[1:21] event in the worship service
[1:24] the fifth lie is that the tapes are the
[1:27] token and being part of a tape church is
[1:30] the evidence of having the token
[1:33] the sixth lie is that Tate boys are the
[1:36] true five-fold Ministry and playing
[1:38] tapes is number one in the fivefold
[1:40] ministry
[1:42] the seventh lie is that brother
[1:44] branham's human spirit and mind and soul
[1:47] are identical to the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:50] Spirit mind and soul
[1:52] the eighth lie is that brother Branham
[1:55] has a living Ministry today and anyone
[1:58] who doesn't believe that is a Demas
[2:01] so now let's move on to the 9th and
[2:04] tenth lie
[2:05] both these lies come from the same
[2:07] statement made by the leadership at
[2:09] Branham Tabernacle and also there's a
[2:12] moment where Branham Tabernacles Pastor
[2:15] again does name-calling to anyone who
[2:17] disagrees with his lies
[2:20] so the ninth lie is that revelation 22
[2:24] verse 16 is Jesus telling us to be taped
[2:27] churches and of course this is a lie so
[2:31] let's listen to the full quote in
[2:32] context
[2:33] praise the Lord you know many critics
[2:37] I hate to go in that direction after
[2:38] saying that but without Revelation say
[2:41] brother Branham never said play tapes in
[2:44] church
[2:46] that's called ears but can't hear
[2:50] that's what it's called others say we
[2:53] just believe the Bible and it don't say
[2:56] it in the Bible neither
[2:58] well I've got news for both of you it
[3:01] does say it in the Bible
[3:04] Jesus himself said play tapes in your
[3:08] local churches
[3:10] [Applause]
[3:16] [Music]
[3:25] [Music]
[3:27] [Applause]
[3:29] [Music]
[3:36] so maybe if they won't hear Brother
[3:38] random maybe they'll hear the word
[3:40] praise the Lord
[3:43] here it is
[3:45] the last thing Jesus is telling his
[3:48] bride
[3:49] in his word listen
[3:53] s
[3:55] my angel
[3:58] now we've been talking about this angel
[4:01] is Malachi 4 5 this Luke 17 30. we've
[4:05] been talking about him he's the he's
[4:07] this angel that told John all the
[4:09] secrets that's that angel
[4:11] to do what to testify unto you these
[4:16] things
[4:18] things all the Mysteries all the seals
[4:21] oh everything all the Mysteries
[4:24] where is he supposed to do it in the
[4:26] churches
[4:32] [Applause]
[4:36] [Music]
[4:51] [Music]
[4:51] [Applause]
[4:55] [Music]
[4:56] [Applause]
[4:59] praise the name of the Lord remain
[5:01] standing
[5:02] isn't that wonderful there it is right
[5:05] there in the word
[5:07] you got a Scofield bible and if you
[5:09] haven't done it
[5:10] read in your Scofield bible on your
[5:12] churches
[5:14] and read down in the column and see what
[5:16] those churches are this is local
[5:19] [Music]
[5:20] [Applause]
[5:22] churches
[5:24] he sent his Angel to preach in the
[5:28] churches
[5:29] and the only way you can do that is by
[5:32] pressing play playing this message
[5:35] this is the will of the Lord
[5:39] it's the perfect
[5:40] [Applause]
[5:42] with this word
[5:49] now that we've heard the LIE here's a
[5:52] few points I want to make
[5:53] first the Bible never said to play tapes
[5:56] in every Church
[5:58] the Bible supports living men who are
[6:00] currently alive on the Earth are to
[6:03] preach God's Living Word of course this
[6:05] is found in Ephesians 4 verses 8-16 and
[6:09] also Romans 10 verses 13 through 17 and
[6:13] II Timothy 4 verse 2 and 2nd Timothy 2
[6:16] verse 2.
[6:18] notice how incredibly sad it is to see
[6:20] Branham tabernacle's leadership saying
[6:23] something Jesus never said
[6:25] now I want to be gracious here because
[6:27] as a minister I've made mistakes and all
[6:30] ministers make mistakes
[6:32] so I'm asking God for Mercy to have
[6:35] mercy on Brandon tabernacle's leadership
[6:37] because all preachers make mistakes even
[6:39] me even brother Branham every preacher
[6:42] makes mistakes but when a preacher is
[6:44] shown his mistake he should repent and
[6:47] then make it right publicly if he
[6:49] preached something wrong publicly which
[6:51] I've had to do numerous times and I'll
[6:53] continue to do by the grace of God
[6:56] the second point is brother Graham never
[6:58] said every church has to play tapes as
[7:01] their primary event in the worship
[7:02] service
[7:04] there are no quotes that say every
[7:06] church should play brother Rams tapes
[7:08] first above living preachers
[7:10] I think if my memory serves me correct
[7:13] there's only two quotes or brother
[7:14] random encourages people to play tapes I
[7:16] think it's in questions and answers 1964
[7:19] and in those cases the Believers had no
[7:22] living preachers to preach to them so
[7:24] brother random allowed them to play
[7:25] tapes
[7:27] brother Brown we have no preacher where
[7:30] we live that we have tape service on
[7:34] Sunday night only should we take our
[7:38] children to another church for Sunday
[7:40] school are the tape Services sufficient
[7:44] well let that be according to where your
[7:46] children are going see now if you get
[7:49] your children that are young and you get
[7:51] them out into some kind of a group out
[7:53] there that'll just pound the stuff into
[7:55] them at the if they they shouldn't know
[7:57] I wouldn't do it if they if they seem to
[7:59] learn enough from the tapes and things
[8:01] and you say you put them over in a
[8:03] Catholic Church take them over to
[8:04] Catholic Church
[8:05] more or something like that I wouldn't
[8:07] advise that the if they uh but now if
[8:10] you got a nice little church or that
[8:11] maybe disagree to other things with you
[8:13] and your children want to go to Sunday
[8:14] school they're full gospel people or
[8:15] something like that's perfectly all
[8:16] right but see when you come to a place
[8:18] where it depends on how your children
[8:19] take it so you watch what your children
[8:21] does on how they react to it and see if
[8:24] you don't have a church to go to should
[8:27] you just listen to the tapes yes that's
[8:30] uh that'd be fine do
[8:33] but anyone who's listening to brother
[8:35] Branham knows the majority of the quotes
[8:37] from Brother Branham say that the
[8:39] fivefold ministry will perfect the Bride
[8:41] of Jesus Christ because that's what the
[8:43] Bible says
[8:44] and brother Rand tells preachers he's
[8:46] right behind them preach as hard as you
[8:48] can don't change a thing about the
[8:49] Evangelical fivefold Ministry
[8:52] and yet Branham Tabernacle has changed
[8:54] everything by putting tape playing above
[8:56] living preachers
[8:58] Also regarding the two quotes where
[9:01] brother Branham says it's okay to stay
[9:03] at home and play tapes you've got to
[9:05] take that into context because two
[9:07] sermons earlier and questions and
[9:08] answers part one brother random gave a
[9:11] Stern warning to people that filed his
[9:13] message to go to church brother Brown
[9:15] said if you can't come here to the
[9:16] Tabernacle get some church somewhere go
[9:19] to it he said sure you go to church
[9:21] wherever the church doors open you take
[9:23] off as hard as you can go and then
[9:25] brother Brown tells a story about some
[9:27] ministers who tried to get followers of
[9:29] brother Branham to go to church and they
[9:31] would not go to church and brother
[9:33] Branham rebuked them but the RAM said if
[9:36] they stayed at home they dishonor the
[9:37] resurrection of Christ but the RAM said
[9:40] quote you go to church somewhere end
[9:41] quote brother Ram said he would go to
[9:43] church at a church if they only believe
[9:45] one thing that he believed that Jesus
[9:47] was the son of God let's listen to the
[9:49] quotes
[9:57] you don't have to take all they do what
[9:59] part of bread they're serving you serve
[10:00] the bread well they got the garlic while
[10:02] you just leave it alone see
[10:05] Brian I can't make them you know that's
[10:07] the time sure you go to church wherever
[10:09] the church door opens you take off as
[10:10] hard as you can go that's if they don't
[10:12] believe what now you don't have to
[10:13] protect don't join them don't join in
[10:15] them churches but go to and fellowship
[10:18] with them how do you know it's not the
[10:19] Lord he said to make everything work
[10:20] together for the good and maybe there's
[10:22] soul in her ought to be saved and you
[10:24] can Shine the ride to them
[10:27] should we go to the other churches even
[10:30] when they disagree with you
[10:33] sure
[10:35] yep
[10:36] just did when they disagree with him
[10:38] go ahead
[10:41] uh we know to Sharon
[10:44] said uh it should we go to another
[10:46] church that disagrees with you sure I
[10:48] know I'm not the only people on the
[10:50] beach you know there's this other a
[10:51] godly man everywhere I hope I'm one of
[10:54] them but don't never get down here I was
[10:56] called in on something like this uh the
[10:58] other day a group in Arizona called my
[11:02] attention to that see administer a group
[11:04] said the only thing that we have against
[11:05] you brother Graham is one of the things
[11:07] the people that's come down here with
[11:09] you we can't get them to go to church
[11:10] anywhere so they got children and
[11:12] everything they won't go to church and
[11:13] said well we told me welcome down come
[11:15] to our church I know they put a pressure
[11:17] on you I want you to join but you don't
[11:18] have to join but but damn kids in Sunday
[11:21] school somewhere
[11:23] and you're going to church don't sit at
[11:24] home go fishing hunting and things like
[11:26] that on Sunday
[11:27] you said well I'm not a legalism well
[11:30] you better be in that manner for a while
[11:31] dishonoring the resurrection of Christ
[11:33] you go to church somewhere if I if I
[11:37] went if I couldn't get if I went to a
[11:39] certain church I know there's only one
[11:40] thing that people ever said that I
[11:41] believe they said they believed Jesus
[11:43] was Son of God they said it I doubt it
[11:45] but I go hear him say that
[11:47] maybe say that's this church May the
[11:49] next Church would be something like the
[11:51] Baptist they say yeah
[11:53] yeah I experience I'll go with them that
[11:54] then I believe Jesus Christ the son of
[11:56] God I believe you have to have an
[11:57] experience all right then maybe there's
[11:59] Assemblies of God now they believe uh
[12:01] see all right now I can hear about three
[12:02] or four slices of bread with them see
[12:05] so friends it's a shame most people that
[12:08] follow Brenham Tabernacle do not even
[12:09] physically attend a home church I know
[12:12] there's construction going on regarding
[12:14] a new Branham Tabernacle but that
[12:16] doesn't do away with a command from
[12:18] Hebrews 10 24 and 25 that every believer
[12:22] should attend a physical church and
[12:24] gather with Believers somewhere and do
[12:26] it more as the day approaches and of
[12:28] course we'll have a separate video on
[12:29] this later by God's grace
[12:32] the third point is that the word
[12:33] churches in revelation 22 verse 16
[12:36] refers to the seven Gentile churches
[12:39] mentioned earlier in the Book of
[12:41] Revelation Revelation 1 verse 11.
[12:43] revelation 22 verse 16 says I Jesus have
[12:46] sent mine Angel to testify unto you
[12:49] these things in the churches I am the
[12:51] root and offspring of David and the
[12:52] bright and Morning Star
[12:54] so Branham Tabernacle falsely interprets
[12:56] the word churches here as meaning every
[12:58] local church
[13:00] in the seventh Church age revelation 22
[13:03] verse 16 never says in the churches in
[13:06] laodicea so again Branham Tabernacle is
[13:09] adding to the word of God of course in
[13:12] this scripture Jesus means he sent his
[13:14] Angel to testify to John these things in
[13:18] the seven churches
[13:20] and of course that aligns with
[13:22] Revelation 1 verse 11 which says saying
[13:25] I am Alpha and Omega the first and the
[13:27] last and what thou seeest write in a
[13:29] book and send it unto the seven churches
[13:31] which are in Asia unto Ephesus and unto
[13:34] Smyrna and unto pergamos and unto
[13:36] thyatira and unto Sardis and unto
[13:38] Philadelphia and unto laodicea
[13:41] now of course the Book of Revelation has
[13:44] at least three applications
[13:46] it applied to the literal seven churches
[13:49] the Gentile churches in Asia that
[13:52] received these letters around 90 or 100
[13:54] A.D
[13:55] but second they also had a prophetic
[13:57] meaning to the Future seven Church ages
[14:00] and then third of course they apply to
[14:02] the individual every individual knows
[14:04] what it's like to leave their first love
[14:06] like it says in the letter to Ephesus
[14:08] and then every believer understands the
[14:11] importance of being hot for Jesus and
[14:14] not being lukewarm or cold as a letter
[14:16] to the lay of the decisions speaks of so
[14:19] there's at least three applications to
[14:21] the letters to the seven churches
[14:23] so finishing up on this ninth lie Jesus
[14:27] is not telling the laodicean church age
[14:29] to be taped churches in revelation 22
[14:32] verse 16. Jesus is reiterating before
[14:35] the end of this book that he sent his
[14:37] Angel whether it's a Heavenly angel or a
[14:40] theophany of a past Prophet to testify
[14:44] unto John the entire Book of Revelation
[14:46] 2 the seven Gentile churches mentioned
[14:50] Revelation 1 verse 11.
[14:52] moving on to the tenth lie Branham
[14:55] Tabernacle said that the angel of
[14:56] revelation 22 verses 6 through 9 and
[15:01] 2216 is brother Branham
[15:04] and I believe this is a lie for at least
[15:06] two reasons before going over the two
[15:08] reasons let's listen to this lie again
[15:10] so you can understand the context
[15:16] the last thing Jesus is telling his
[15:19] bride
[15:20] in his word listen
[15:24] Jesus
[15:26] hi
[15:30] now we've been talking about this angel
[15:32] is Malachi 4 5 this Luke 17 30. we've
[15:36] been talking about him he's the he's
[15:38] this angel that told John all the
[15:40] secrets that's that angel
[15:42] to do what to testify unto you these
[15:47] things
[15:48] what things all the Mysteries all the
[15:52] seals oh everything all the Mysteries
[15:56] so Point number one proving This Is A
[15:58] Lie Is that brother Brandon himself
[16:00] taught on numerous occasions that there
[16:03] is no pre-existence of souls brother
[16:06] random cannot be the angel of revelation
[16:08] 22 and really of the entire Book of
[16:11] Revelation
[16:12] so the proof of this is found in who is
[16:14] this Melchizedek 1965 and also in the
[16:17] church age book so let's listen to these
[16:19] two quotes you'll see brother random
[16:21] said every man started in the mind of
[16:24] God and then came to flesh
[16:26] brother Rayner said only Jesus went from
[16:29] the mind of God to theophany to flesh
[16:32] and who is this Melchizedek 1965 brother
[16:35] Ram taught that Jesus came down the
[16:37] regular line
[16:39] and the regular line was four parts the
[16:42] first part was attribute in the mind of
[16:44] God
[16:45] the second part was theophany the third
[16:48] part was flesh body and the fourth part
[16:51] was a glorified body
[16:53] so Jesus came from attribute theophany
[16:56] flesh glorified but brother Graham said
[16:59] we bypassed that second stage theophany
[17:02] so our order is different than Jesus's
[17:05] order we went from attribute in the mind
[17:07] of God to a flesh body
[17:09] so in other words we did not pre-exist
[17:13] our souls did not pre-exist before we
[17:15] came in these bodies of Flesh
[17:18] each human's order of existence goes
[17:20] attribute one
[17:22] number two flesh number three theophany
[17:25] and fourth glorified
[17:28] So based on this brother random could
[17:30] not have been the angel or Prophet that
[17:33] revealed The Book of Revelation to Saint
[17:35] John that's because there's no
[17:37] pre-existence of souls brother Bram did
[17:40] not pre-exist in a theophany body before
[17:42] he came to the Earth because no one does
[17:45] except the Lord Jesus Christ
[17:48] so let's listen to the quotes from who's
[17:49] this Melchizedek and the quotes from the
[17:51] church age book
[17:59] s
[18:02] [Music]
[18:06] that could appear disappear and then he
[18:09] become fresh
[18:11] and return back again
[18:14] resurrected that same body in a very bad
[18:17] condition
[18:18] that your dad passed the theophany and
[18:21] become flesh man to be tempted
[18:25] and sin and then if this Earthly
[18:29] Tabernacle is dissolved we have one
[18:31] already waiting amen we have not yet the
[18:34] batteries but now
[18:37] before I close this subject I know there
[18:40] is a question in your minds you will
[18:42] want to know if I believe in the
[18:44] doctrine of pre-existence
[18:46] I don't believe in that Mormon doctrine
[18:48] of the pre-existence of souls any more
[18:50] than I believe in reincarnation or the
[18:52] transmigration of Souls
[18:54] be careful here and see this
[18:56] it is not the person that comes
[18:58] predestinated eternally from God it is
[19:01] the word or seed that is it
[19:04] way back there too far back for the
[19:07] human mind to grasp the Eternal god with
[19:09] eternal thoughts thought and decreed
[19:12] Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated
[19:15] Romans 9 13.
[19:18] and neither was born and neither had
[19:20] done good or evil
[19:22] see it was the thought and then that
[19:25] thought became expressed and God bought
[19:27] back Jacob because Jacob alone was seed
[19:31] Jacob alone had the seed
[19:33] that is why he had respect to the
[19:35] birthright and Covenant of God
[19:38] now the second point is that the angel
[19:40] of revelation 22 was likely a Heavenly
[19:44] Angel and not a theophany of a human
[19:46] being or prophet
[19:48] so the U in revelation 22 16 is not
[19:51] Branham Tabernacle and it is not the
[19:54] Believers of the laodicean church age
[19:55] I'll read it again I Jesus have sent
[19:58] mine Angel to testify unto you the you
[20:01] is Saint John
[20:04] Jesus is saying I have sent mine Angel
[20:06] my heavenly Angel most likely to testify
[20:09] unto you Saint John these things in the
[20:11] churches meaning John was going to get
[20:14] the Revelation from Jesus's Angel and
[20:17] then share it with the seven churches
[20:19] now let's prove this by Brother Rams
[20:21] quotes even there's numerous quotes
[20:23] where brother Ram says this angel that
[20:26] was sent to John to give the Book of
[20:27] Revelation was a Heavenly Angel here's
[20:30] one from the manifestation of the spirit
[20:32] 1951.
[20:33] and notice brother Branham said it was a
[20:36] prophetic spirit that was an anointing
[20:38] this heavenly Angel let's listen to the
[20:40] quote
[20:47] testify these things is that right and
[20:50] the whole book of Revelations we showed
[20:52] John and the angel of the Lord is that
[20:55] right and John fell down to worship the
[20:58] angel angel said see that you do it not
[20:59] is that right for I am a godfellow
[21:02] servants the prophet is that true the
[21:04] prophetic spirits that have been on the
[21:06] prophet down to the age will share a
[21:08] prophesying through John's showing him
[21:10] by an Angel
[21:11] that same spirit is in the building
[21:14] tonight
[21:16] here's a second quote from the presence
[21:17] of the Lord Jesus 1955 brother Ram says
[21:21] it again he says we do not know who the
[21:23] angel was
[21:24] in the context he's talking how God
[21:26] sends Heavenly angels to the Believers
[21:28] such as Gabriel
[21:30] so let's listen to the quote
[21:37] Jesus has set my angel to signify these
[21:40] things which will shortly come to pass
[21:42] now a true angel you're going to throw
[21:44] back Jules of Smith and so forth to me
[21:46] but Lance it don't work with the
[21:49] scripture a real true angel will come
[21:51] and vindicate this scripture to the
[21:53] dance that's it
[22:01] now the prophets worship God a true
[22:04] Angel won't be worshiped it's not
[22:06] worship of Angel it's a it's a Ministry
[22:08] of angels that comes from God now these
[22:11] Niner Angels comes perhaps this Angel's
[22:13] with us or come see your your Rumble
[22:16] servant if that's probably a minor Angel
[22:18] but when Gabriel comes granted there's
[22:21] something really on the road
[22:25] me Gabriel announced the first coming of
[22:28] the Lord Jesus and Gabriel will announce
[22:31] the second coming of the Lord Jesus
[22:33] amen
[22:37] and lastly to show the balance brother
[22:39] Brown said this Angel could have been
[22:40] Elijah he said this in the revelation of
[22:43] Jesus Christ 1960. so again we have
[22:46] quotes on both sides
[22:48] we have quotes that brother Brown says
[22:49] this Angel sent to John was a Heavenly
[22:52] Angel and then we have quotes from
[22:53] Brother Brown said it could have been a
[22:54] theophany of a human Prophet so again
[22:57] this proves not every word brother
[22:59] Branham said is thus saith the Lord if
[23:02] you make every word of brother Branham
[23:03] thus saith the Lord then this is a
[23:04] contradiction because in one place he
[23:06] said it's a Heavenly Angel and another
[23:08] place he said it could be Elijah so
[23:11] we're thankful that real Believers have
[23:12] the right balance they can rightly
[23:14] divide the word of God by the Holy Ghost
[23:16] so let's listen to this quote from the
[23:18] revelation of Jesus Christ 1960.
[23:32] the Bible doesn't say who the angel was
[23:35] but we know that it was a problem
[23:38] what the Bible later said Jesus has set
[23:42] my angel to testify these things which
[23:44] surely come to pass
[23:47] then we find out that when John started
[23:51] to worship the angel the angel said see
[23:54] that you do it now Revelations 22 I
[23:56] believe it is and then he says for I am
[23:59] about fellow servants and as the
[24:01] presence
[24:03] live in America
[24:07] the castle but this planet was sent and
[24:11] John being the careful look at the
[24:13] nature of the rest of his Epistles prove
[24:16] that was John wrote it
[24:20] before closing I want to add another lie
[24:23] coming out of random Tabernacle if you
[24:24] noticed earlier in the quote random
[24:26] Tabernacles leadership name called again
[24:28] and said anyone who doesn't agree with
[24:30] these ninth and tenth lies is fulfilling
[24:33] the scripture about unbelievers found in
[24:35] Matthew 13 verses 10 through 16 and also
[24:39] acts 22 verses 27-29 and Romans 11
[24:43] verses 7 through 11. so let's again
[24:46] listen to this lie coming from Branham
[24:48] tabernacle's leadership that says anyone
[24:50] that disagrees with them has ears that
[24:53] cannot hear
[24:55] the Lord you know many critics
[24:57] I hate to go in that direction after
[24:59] saying that but without Revelation say
[25:02] brother Branham never said play tapes in
[25:05] church
[25:06] that's called ears but can't hear
[25:12] you that's what it's called others say
[25:14] we just believe the Bible and it don't
[25:16] say it in the Bible neither
[25:19] so friends notice Branham Tabernacles
[25:21] leadership are exalting themselves as
[25:23] the ones who are the Blessed because
[25:26] they have ears that can hear that Jesus
[25:28] said we're all supposed to play tapes in
[25:30] our churches which is a lie it's not
[25:32] found in the Bible and Bram Tabernacle
[25:34] leadership is making the group who's in
[25:37] the right Believers like you and I who
[25:39] believe in living preachers as God's
[25:41] provided way to lead the church today
[25:43] random Tabernacle is making the true
[25:45] group out to be the group that does not
[25:48] have the ears to hear the mysteries of
[25:50] the kingdom of heaven and as usual
[25:51] Brenham Tabernacle is guilty of what
[25:54] they're accusing others of random
[25:57] Tabernacle is saying our hearts are wax
[25:59] gross because we cannot hear with our
[26:01] ears and wax gross in the Greek means to
[26:04] make thick to make stupid to render the
[26:07] soul Dole or callous Supreme Tabernacle
[26:11] is saying we have dull or calloused ears
[26:13] because we don't play tapes in our
[26:16] churches as the main event of the
[26:18] worship service and of course Branham
[26:20] Tabernacle is wrong
[26:22] and notice friends this is one of the
[26:23] most severe accusations someone can give
[26:25] to another because Jesus used this
[26:28] against the blinded Jews who rejected
[26:30] his ministry Paul used it against the
[26:32] Jews who rejected his ministry to the
[26:34] Gentiles and Paul used it about Jews who
[26:37] were blinded to the Messiah in the
[26:39] previous scriptures mentioned
[26:40] and the sad part is again Branham
[26:43] tabernacle's leadership is
[26:45] misinterpreting revelation 22 16 because
[26:47] the Bible never places Tate boys above
[26:50] Apostles prophets evangelists teachers
[26:52] and pastors from Ephesians 4 verses 8
[26:54] through 16. they're ignoring the fact
[26:57] that only living preachers preach the
[26:59] gospel according to Romans 10 verses
[27:01] 13-17 they're ignoring where Paul said
[27:04] preach the word he didn't say play the
[27:07] word Paul said preach the word in second
[27:10] Timothy 4 verse 2 right before he was
[27:12] martyred Paul never changes gospel and
[27:15] then Paul said also in second Timothy 2
[27:17] verse 2 commit the gospel to Faithful
[27:20] Men not faithful tape players or not
[27:22] faithful tape boys because Faithful Men
[27:25] would teach others also he never said
[27:27] Faithful Men would play the word to
[27:29] others also so friends who is the group
[27:32] that is changing Paul's gospel it's
[27:34] Branham Tabernacle who is the group
[27:37] that's keeping every iota of Paul's
[27:39] gospel well by God's grace that's those
[27:41] of us who believe in the true faithful
[27:44] Ministry and do not add tape voice to
[27:46] the fivefold ministry
[27:48] in closing let's close with another word
[27:50] of Prayer in hopes that at least one or
[27:53] more of the people caught in the Trap of
[27:56] the state Church movement will repent
[27:59] father God I come in the name of the
[28:01] Lord Jesus Christ and I humbly ask God
[28:03] that these truths the Lord could be
[28:05] shared with those who are deceived and
[28:06] caught in the snare of this man-made
[28:08] denominational system of the tape
[28:10] Ministry Lord Jesus May those in the
[28:13] tape church ministry have ears to hear
[28:15] may they understand that their
[28:18] leadership is adding to the Bible and
[28:20] even adding to brother Ram's tapes as
[28:22] they worship brother Ram's tapes so God
[28:25] be merciful Lord your word will not
[28:27] return void I know you'll take videos
[28:29] like this and other videos of other
[28:31] ministers who believe the truth and
[28:33] you'll direct them to all those who are
[28:35] predestinated and elected and chosen and
[28:39] foreknown to eternal life father I pray
[28:41] you do this in your mercy by Your Grace
[28:42] by your Holy Spirit we know all things
[28:45] are possible to them that believe we
[28:47] know all that the father has given to
[28:49] you will come
[28:50] we thank you God for your grace and
[28:52] mercy and may the Holy Ghost Minister
[28:53] true to those who want to hear it I ask
[28:56] all this in Jesus Christ's name amen
[29:00] if you have any questions concerns or
[29:02] testimonies about this video please
[29:04] contact me God bless you and may Jesus
[29:07] Christ be the desire of your heart
