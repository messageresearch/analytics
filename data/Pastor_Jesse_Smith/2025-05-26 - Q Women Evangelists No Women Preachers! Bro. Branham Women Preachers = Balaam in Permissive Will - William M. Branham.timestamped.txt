[0:03] She shall not teach or serve any
[0:05] authority but to be in silence. Well,
[0:08] you say, "The Lord told me to do it." I
[0:10] don't doubt that one bit. Did you hear
[0:13] my message the other night about Balum?
[0:15] Balam got the first straight cut
[0:18] decision of God. Don't do it. But he
[0:20] kept on fooling around and finally God
[0:22] told him to go do it. God might permit
[0:24] you to preach. I don't say anything, but
[0:27] it's not according to his original word
[0:29] and plan. For she's to be under
[0:31] obedience as also saith the law.
[0:34] Greetings friends in the mattress name
[0:36] of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of
[0:39] this video is to answer a viewer's
[0:40] question who is new to the message. Can
[0:43] women evangelize? So, this viewer has
[0:47] been visiting our church recently. He's
[0:48] a wonderful blessing to our service.
[0:50] He's new to the ministry of William
[0:52] Brandham. and he has a friend who
[0:55] believes women are not allowed to lead a
[0:57] congregation as far as being a pastor,
[1:00] but his friend had the question, can
[1:02] women evangelize? So, excellent
[1:04] question, especially from a person who's
[1:06] unfamiliar with brother Bram's message
[1:08] of the hour, the apostolic faith
[1:10] restored here in the end time. So, first
[1:13] I want to reference a video I put out
[1:15] October 5th, 2014. It's called Women
[1:18] Angels and Women Preachers. It's the
[1:20] eighth video I put out. It's only 13
[1:22] minutes long, so it' be well worth your
[1:23] time if you haven't seen this video. The
[1:25] origin of that video was I had seen how
[1:27] some of the accusers of brother Brandham
[1:29] had said that Zechariah 5:9 was a proof
[1:33] of women angels. And that's a lie. Of
[1:35] course, they're wrong. Again, it's
[1:37] another proof that they're trying to
[1:38] slander brother Brandham, and they're
[1:40] not called to rightly divide the word of
[1:42] God. Anyone who studies that passage and
[1:45] even the writings of some of the
[1:47] commentators will know that those two
[1:49] women are not angels. They're nations
[1:53] likely Assyria and Babylon because they
[1:56] have stork wings. Why would the holy God
[1:58] of heaven allow his angels to have
[2:01] abominable wings because stors were an
[2:04] abomination to Israel? Makes no sense.
[2:07] and it shows these accusers make no
[2:09] sense when they're trying to discredit
[2:11] Brother Brandham. So anyways, that was
[2:13] the kind of origin of that video, but I
[2:16] also showed how there's no such thing as
[2:18] women preachers in the entire Bible. So
[2:20] before we answer this question about
[2:22] evangelizing, let's hit a few of those
[2:24] main points from that video. There's no
[2:27] women angels in the entire Bible. All
[2:29] the angels in the Bible are referenced
[2:31] as men. And the word angel means
[2:34] messenger. So, an angel is a messenger
[2:36] of the word of God, showing how women
[2:39] are not to carry the word of God with
[2:42] any authority over a
[2:44] man. Second, the Old Testament never had
[2:47] women priests. I think it's Leviticus 21
[2:50] that goes through the requirements of
[2:51] priests and they were always men. So,
[2:54] the spiritual leadership of Israel was
[2:56] always men only, no women.
[3:00] Some people think Deborah was a
[3:02] preacher, but no, she just had the gift
[3:03] to prophesy, which means foretell future
[3:06] events in the name of the Lord. And she
[3:08] was a judge, which is equivalent to a
[3:10] judge today, who would sit in a
[3:12] courthouse and judge cases. And that's
[3:15] because the leadership of Israel was
[3:17] really low at that time. So Deborah was
[3:19] not a priest. She could not be because
[3:22] God's law refused women to be priests.
[3:25] And then the New Testament, there was
[3:27] never women apostles. Jesus never called
[3:30] a woman to go preach. So we see the same
[3:33] principle in the Old and New Testaments.
[3:36] In fact, one of those verses is Mark
[3:38] 3:14. And he Jesus ordained 12 that they
[3:42] should be with him and that he might
[3:44] send them forth to preach. Jesus only
[3:47] ordained men to preach the gospel.
[3:51] Romans 10:14-15 says, "How shall they
[3:54] hear without a preacher?" So God is only
[3:56] going to use preachers. And how shall
[3:58] they preach except they be sent? If
[4:00] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday,
[4:02] today, and forever, which he is
[4:03] according to Hebrews 13:8, if he only
[4:06] sent men yesterday, then he'll only send
[4:08] men today by the grace of God. And I
[4:10] challenge anyone look up that word
[4:12] preach in the Greek lexicon. It's used
[4:14] 60 times. I went through everyone today,
[4:16] this morning. Not one of them mentions a
[4:19] woman preaching. Another word for that
[4:21] is publishing. God never asked a woman
[4:24] or sent a woman or ordained a woman to
[4:26] preach or publish the gospel of Jesus
[4:28] Christ. And just a few more quick
[4:30] verses. Uh Paul in Galatians 1:es 6-12
[4:35] said, "If anyone preaches a different
[4:37] gospel, they're cursed." And so Paul
[4:39] never ordained a woman preacher. Of
[4:42] course, people know this if they read 1
[4:44] Timothy 2 11-15.
[4:46] Paul said, "I did not suffer a woman to
[4:49] teach or assert any authority over a
[4:51] man." Because Adam was formed first,
[4:54] then Eve, and Eve was the one being
[4:56] deceived in the
[4:58] transgression. So that was Paul's
[5:00] reasoning. He went back to the
[5:01] beginning, Genesis, and the woman was
[5:03] deceived with the word of God. So
[5:05] therefore, she's not allowed to preach
[5:07] the word of God. And then 1 Corinthians
[5:09] 14:es
[5:11] 34-4, Paul says, "Women are to be silent
[5:14] in the church." And of course that has
[5:15] to refer only to being preachers because
[5:18] we know women can sing in the church.
[5:20] Women can operate in the nine gifts of
[5:23] the Holy Spirit. But it's not from the
[5:25] platform. It's not in the place of
[5:26] authority or leadership. It would be out
[5:29] in the
[5:29] congregation. They're not called to be
[5:32] leaders in any capacity in the house of
[5:35] God. Spiritual leadership is male only
[5:38] according to the Old Testament and the
[5:40] New Testament. And then Paul said,
[5:42] "We'll all be judged by his gospel." the
[5:44] secrets of men's hearts will be judged
[5:45] by Paul's gospel according to Romans
[5:48] 2:16. So there's no other gospel than
[5:50] Paul's and we're all judged by Paul's
[5:52] gospel. So if Paul did not suffer or
[5:55] allow a woman to teach men or to have
[5:57] any authority over men, then we'll all
[5:59] be judged by that and women will be
[6:01] judged by that who claim that they're
[6:03] called to preach. Okay, that's a summary
[6:06] there. Now let's go to this question.
[6:07] Can women evangelize? And as I was
[6:09] meditating on that, the thought came
[6:11] that the word evangelize is only used
[6:14] three times in the entire Bible. It's
[6:16] Acts
[6:17] 21:8, Ephesians 4:1, and 2 Timothy
[6:21] 4:5. So, we have to speak where the
[6:23] Bible speaks, right? And be silent where
[6:25] the Bible's silent. So, the Bible speaks
[6:27] on evangelists three times, and it's
[6:29] never referring to women. Acts 21:8
[6:32] refers to Philip the Evangelist, male.
[6:35] And then 2 Timothy 4:5 refers to Timothy
[6:39] doing the work of an evangelist. Timothy
[6:41] is a man male. So those two witnesses
[6:44] are male only evangelists. And then
[6:46] Ephesians 4:1 goes through the five New
[6:50] Testament preaching gifts. Apostle,
[6:52] prophet, teacher, pastor, evangelist. So
[6:56] there's only five preaching gifts in the
[6:58] New Testament. And there's no Bible
[7:00] witness of a woman having any of those
[7:03] five gifts in the New Testament. Look up
[7:05] apostle. Every time it's used in the New
[7:07] Testament, it will never mention a woman
[7:08] as an apostle and so forth with pastor,
[7:11] teacher, evangelist, and prophet.
[7:14] There's never a woman prophet who led
[7:18] with spiritual leadership in the church
[7:20] of God. Not in the New Testament and not
[7:22] in the Old Testament. So with those
[7:24] three verses, there's never a woman
[7:26] evangelist. So women cannot evangelize
[7:29] in a service and have authority over men
[7:33] because it's against the word of God. I
[7:36] think it's interesting to point out in 1
[7:38] Corinthians 14 34-40 Paul said women
[7:42] have to be silent which also saith the
[7:44] law. So Paul recognized there's this
[7:46] continuity or harmony between the old
[7:49] and new testaments that women are not to
[7:51] have spiritual leadership. And I read a
[7:53] few of the commentators like John Gil
[7:55] and Albert Barnes, Matthew Henry, and
[7:58] they take that phrase as also sayith the
[8:01] law of St. Paul and they reference
[8:03] Genesis
[8:04] 3:16 where God told Eve, "Your desire
[8:08] will be to your husband, and he shall
[8:10] rule over you." So those commentators
[8:12] believe Paul was referring back to
[8:14] Genesis 3:16 as proof women are not
[8:17] called to have authority in a spiritual
[8:19] assembly. And that aligns perfectly what
[8:22] Paul wrote in 1 Timothy 2:es
[8:24] 11-15. Eve was deceived, therefore she
[8:27] cannot teach or preach or have any
[8:29] authority in the house of God. Now,
[8:32] here's some verses I believe that will
[8:34] help women know their place better.
[8:36] Women can testify. That's in John
[8:39] 4:39. The woman at the well was
[8:42] discerned by the Lord Jesus with the
[8:43] Messiah sign, which God used in Brother
[8:45] Bram's life as well. Brother Ran was not
[8:47] the Messiah, but he pointed us to the
[8:49] Messiah. And the Bible said she
[8:51] testified to the men in the city and
[8:53] everybody all the things the Lord had
[8:55] told her and discerned in her life. So
[8:57] testify means to give a report. It's
[8:59] like a reporter. A reporter is supposed
[9:01] to just tell what he or she saw or
[9:04] heard. And that's what women can do.
[9:05] They can just tell the facts, testify of
[9:08] what happened. But they're not to
[9:09] rightly divide the word of truth.
[9:11] They're not to teach and herald and
[9:13] proclaim the gospel with spiritual
[9:16] authority in a public setting, but they
[9:19] can testify or report as a witness of
[9:22] what they saw and heard. Older women can
[9:25] also teach the younger women, but not in
[9:27] a church service, not with spiritual
[9:29] authority. That's in Titus 2:es 3-5. The
[9:33] older women can teach the younger women
[9:35] how to love their husbands, love their
[9:37] children, that the word of God not be
[9:39] blasphemed, but that is not behind a
[9:40] pulpit. It's not in a place of public
[9:43] authority. There's no implication in
[9:45] John 4:39 or Titus 2:es 3-5 that women
[9:50] can teach men or evangelize to men. They
[9:52] cannot do it. They can only testify and
[9:55] give a witness or recollection or an
[9:58] account of what they saw and heard.
[10:01] Another important scripture is Acts
[10:03] 18:26. Some think this scripture allows
[10:05] women to teach men because it says
[10:08] Aquilla and Priscilla expounded unto
[10:10] Apollos the more excellent way, which
[10:12] would have been the baptism of the Holy
[10:14] Ghost. But again, we can't make this
[10:16] verse allow women to teach men because
[10:19] you don't have two or three witnesses.
[10:20] The Bible said, "Let every word be
[10:22] established in the mouth of two or three
[10:24] witnesses." So you have no other verses
[10:26] in the entire Bible allowing women
[10:28] spiritual authority in the Old Testament
[10:31] priesthood or the New Testament
[10:32] five-fold preaching gifts. So it seems
[10:35] Priscilla was simply just testifying of
[10:38] the further revelation she had seen and
[10:40] heard that Apollos had not seen or
[10:43] heard. And of course her husband Aquilla
[10:45] was present. The Bible doesn't say
[10:48] Aquilla said, "Oh, I'd like my wife
[10:50] Priscilla to preach to Apollos." The
[10:52] Bible doesn't say that. So, it seems
[10:54] like Priscilla just testified, which
[10:56] would line up with John 4:39, the woman
[10:59] at the well. Or she could have used one
[11:01] of the nine gifts of the spirit. And of
[11:03] course, you have word of wisdom, word of
[11:04] knowledge, gift of faith, gift of
[11:07] miracles, tongues, interpretation, gift
[11:10] of discernment, all the nine gifts of
[11:12] the Holy Spirit. The women can be used
[11:14] of those, but not in the public setting
[11:17] where it's a service, where there's
[11:18] spiritual authority behind a pulpit or
[11:21] behind a platform. So women can have
[11:24] words of wisdom. They can have words of
[11:25] knowledge. But it's through their
[11:27] testimony. It's not through rightly
[11:29] dividing the word of truth in a public
[11:32] place of authority behind a pulpit. And
[11:35] those nine gifts are not preaching
[11:37] gifts. They're just simply gifts of the
[11:39] Holy Spirit used in a minor way. They're
[11:42] not leadership gifts as also saith the
[11:45] law as Paul says. I think I'll close
[11:48] with one quote from brother Brandham. I
[11:49] love this quote. It's from the choosing
[11:51] of a bride 1965. I've always shared this
[11:54] with people. Brother Bram said, "Many
[11:56] sisters told him, "The Lord called me to
[11:58] preach." And I love what brother Bram
[11:59] said. He said, "I'm not going to argue
[12:00] with you, but I'm going to tell you the
[12:03] word says you not to do it." And the
[12:05] woman would still say, "Well, the Lord
[12:07] told me to do it." Brother Ram said, "I
[12:09] don't doubt that one bit." Now, that's
[12:10] quite a statement. When I first heard
[12:11] this back in probably 2001 or 2002, I
[12:14] was shocked and surprised to hear him
[12:16] say that. But then brother Ram said,
[12:18] "Did you hear my message the other night
[12:20] on Balum?" Balam got the first straight
[12:22] cut decision of God. Don't do it. But he
[12:24] kept on fooling around till finally God
[12:27] told him to go do it. And then he tells
[12:28] the women, "God might permit you to
[12:31] preach. I don't say he didn't, but it's
[12:32] not according to the original word and
[12:34] plan." So this was such a wise answer.
[12:37] Brother Ram, again showing the
[12:38] difference between the perfect will of
[12:39] God and the permissive will of God.
[12:42] Women might be called to preach, but it
[12:44] wasn't God's first word. And women ought
[12:47] to fear God to know that if they are
[12:49] called to preach, it was God's
[12:51] permissive will and they're in the same
[12:53] shoes of Balum. So may God have mercy on
[12:56] those women who continue to preach, yet
[12:58] it would be in God's permissive will.
[13:00] And this also reminds me of a few years
[13:02] ago, Joseph Brandham said he had the
[13:03] word of the Lord that they're in the
[13:05] will of God by pressing play. And I said
[13:09] on my video, I don't doubt that. But it
[13:11] wasn't God's first word because pressing
[13:14] play and obey and sitting all the
[13:16] preachers down cannot be the perfect
[13:18] will of God because it goes against the
[13:20] Bible. God always had living men
[13:22] preaching the living word of God. And
[13:25] what the tape church ministry is doing
[13:27] is similar to what's found in Matthew
[13:29] 25. They're telling preachers to go bury
[13:32] your preaching gift in the ground. And
[13:36] that's a lazy and slothful servant. And
[13:39] of course, there's, you know, 23 other
[13:40] sins that the Brandom Tabernacle is
[13:43] guilty of propagating, which I have a
[13:45] video series on that if you're
[13:46] interested in that. But I don't doubt
[13:48] God told Joseph Brandham he's in his
[13:50] will for pressing play and obey. But it
[13:52] wasn't the first word of God because you
[13:54] never see that in the entire Bible. And
[13:57] if any man changes one thing Paul
[13:59] preached, they're curse according to the
[14:01] Bible and according to what brother
[14:02] Brandham reiterated from the Bible. So,
[14:05] the brand tabernacle has changed so many
[14:07] things about the gospel and preaching
[14:09] and the five-fold ministry. They will
[14:11] answer to God for that. But let's listen
[14:13] to this quote from the choosing of a
[14:14] bride.
[14:16] She persuaded him out of the will of God
[14:19] and caused him to do something that he
[14:21] should not have done and by it caused
[14:24] death to the whole human race.
[14:27] That's why the Bible forbids her to
[14:29] teach or to preach or to handle God's
[14:32] word. Amen. Amen. I know sisters, many
[14:37] of you say, "The Lord called me to
[14:40] preach." I'm not going to argue with
[14:42] you, but I'm going to tell you the word
[14:45] says you not to do it.
[14:48] She shall not teach or serve any
[14:50] authority, but to be in silence.
[14:53] Well, you say, "The Lord told me to do
[14:55] it." I don't doubt that one bit. Did you
[14:58] hear my message the other night about
[15:00] Balum? Amen. Balam got the first
[15:02] straight cut decision of God. Don't do
[15:05] it. But he kept on fooling around and
[15:08] finally God told him to go do it. God
[15:10] might permit you to preach. I don't say
[15:12] he didn't. But it's not according to his
[15:14] original word and plan. For she's to be
[15:17] under obedience as also sayeth the law.
[15:20] It's true. Therefore, she's not supposed
[15:23] to do it.
[15:25] In closing, friends, hope this video was
[15:26] a blessing by the grace of God. I love
[15:28] revisiting some of these topics. It'
[15:30] been a long time since I put out a video
[15:31] about women preachers. So hopefully this
[15:33] was a help by the grace of God. We
[15:35] should be so thankful that we have the
[15:38] New Testament faith, the faith of the
[15:40] apostles restored to us through the
[15:42] ministry of the seven church age
[15:44] messenger, the seventh angel, God's
[15:47] prophet, brother William Brandham. It's
[15:48] such a privilege. God help us to stand
[15:50] with it, stay with it by the grace of
[15:52] God, not add to it, not take away from
[15:55] it by the grace of God. If you have any
[15:57] questions, concerns or testimonies about
[15:59] this video, please contact
[16:01] me. God bless you and may Jesus Christ
[16:04] be the desire of your
[16:06] heart. Very happy to be here this
[16:08] afternoon and again in defense of the
[16:10] gospel of Jesus Christ to bring the good
[16:14] tidings, the good news that Jesus raised
[16:16] from the dead, living among man today,
[16:18] his church. The same Jesus that was
[16:21] yesterday will be today and
[16:24] forever. It never failed.
