[0:00] [Music]
[0:05] greetings friends
[0:06] in the mattress name of the lord jesus
[0:08] christ my name is jesse smith
[0:10] and i was asked to give my testimony so
[0:13] i always want to have a testimony
[0:14] prepared
[0:15] the bible says we overcome by the blood
[0:18] of the lamb
[0:18] and the word of our testimony i just
[0:21] like to start in my childhood
[0:23] you know growing up i had a wonderful
[0:24] childhood i had three older brothers
[0:27] what more could i ask for to play with
[0:30] my
[0:30] wonderful brothers later on the lord
[0:32] gave me a younger sister betsy and then
[0:34] a
[0:34] baby brother paul i had
[0:38] two loving parents my mom and dad were
[0:41] so loving
[0:42] i just have so many great memories from
[0:44] my childhood
[0:50] growing up the first time i started to
[0:52] realize how real
[0:54] jesus was was about second grade
[0:57] i didn't know it you know it was 1988
[1:00] but my mom had been praying for a
[1:01] miracle
[1:02] and i didn't know that but
[1:06] eventually she came down sick and
[1:09] she went to the doctor they found out
[1:10] she had liver cancer which was
[1:12] uncurable at the time and i still
[1:14] remember this
[1:16] in the winter of 1988 driving in my
[1:19] grandmother's car
[1:20] to visit my mom in the hospital and i
[1:23] remember
[1:24] being told that my mom had six months to
[1:26] live
[1:27] and it was a very sad time one of my
[1:30] mom's friends was
[1:32] praying you know for my mom's healing
[1:35] and one morning she woke up and the holy
[1:37] spirit took my mom's friend to a
[1:39] scripture
[1:40] in psalms 118 verse 17
[1:43] which says i shall not die but live
[1:46] and declare the works of the lord my mom
[1:49] told me that her friend was so inspired
[1:51] that she came right to the hospital
[1:53] where my mom was sitting in the hospital
[1:55] bed and
[1:56] told her this scripture and my mom said
[1:59] she just accepted it
[2:00] that god was going to heal her of this
[2:02] incurable cancer
[2:04] i'm not sure how much time passed but my
[2:07] mom told me later that the doctors
[2:09] wanted to have a little surgery to go
[2:10] inside and
[2:11] and look at the cancer and see if they
[2:13] could remove any of it
[2:15] according to my dad's testimony the
[2:17] night before the surgery
[2:19] and my dad went up to my mom while she's
[2:21] sleeping in the hospital bed and
[2:23] laid his hand on the location of the
[2:26] cancer
[2:27] and my dad prayed and said in the name
[2:29] of jesus christ i rebuked this cancer
[2:32] and i commanded to leave according to my
[2:36] mom's testimony the next day the doctors
[2:38] took her into surgery opened her up
[2:40] and they found that the cancer had
[2:41] vanished and
[2:43] my dad says that you know once my mom
[2:45] got home
[2:46] from the hospital with a full complete
[2:50] bill of health completely made well my
[2:53] dad says that he remembers my mom
[2:55] skipping and dancing and running out
[2:57] just to get the mail
[2:59] out at the mailbox and so the miracle my
[3:02] mom had prayed for
[3:04] god had fulfilled it and i remember you
[3:07] know in the next few years after that
[3:09] healing my mom would take all of us
[3:12] children
[3:12] at that time i believe she had six
[3:14] children and
[3:15] would take all of us to different
[3:17] churches around the toledo area
[3:19] testifying about the healing power of
[3:22] jesus christ
[3:24] so from that moment on i knew jesus
[3:26] christ was alive and well
[3:28] now my mom of course had taken us to
[3:30] church every sunday religiously
[3:32] and i'm so thankful she did it we had a
[3:35] wonderful supportive home church
[3:37] delta assembly of god the leadership
[3:40] there
[3:40] pastor randy and his wife kathy were so
[3:44] kind to us they were so supportive and i
[3:46] thank god
[3:48] that i grew up in that church and i was
[3:50] able
[3:51] to learn about god and i truly felt the
[3:54] love of god
[3:55] because of all their support
[4:02] a year or two later i was uh swimming
[4:05] with my brothers at my grandma smith's
[4:07] pond
[4:08] and i was you know getting older by that
[4:09] time i was probably third or fourth
[4:11] grade and i thought
[4:12] well i'm a big guy now i can swim across
[4:14] the pond and it was a pretty big pond
[4:16] uh and so i decided okay i'm gonna swim
[4:19] with all the big boys and i'm gonna try
[4:20] to go across the pond
[4:22] and i started off pretty good i was
[4:24] going pretty fast and
[4:25] as i got towards the the end of the pond
[4:30] i started getting really tired and i
[4:32] started getting scared
[4:34] and with all the boys splashing around
[4:36] me i got some water in my mouth i
[4:37] started choking
[4:39] and i remember this i remember choking
[4:42] on the water
[4:43] and i started sinking because i was
[4:45] running out of
[4:46] strength i was running out of just
[4:48] energy
[4:50] and i remember looking up and you know
[4:53] the water was now above me i remember
[4:54] seeing the sun and i remember thinking
[4:57] i'm going to drown i remember thinking
[4:59] this is it
[5:01] and it was a really scary moment
[5:04] i no energy left and i was just going
[5:06] down and all of a sudden out of nowhere
[5:09] my cousin matt demaline i don't know how
[5:13] he did this but he must have swam ahead
[5:14] of everybody
[5:15] he was of course older and stronger he
[5:18] must have saw me
[5:20] sinking down in the water because all of
[5:21] a sudden it was like too
[5:23] two strong arms reached down the water
[5:25] and just
[5:26] lifted me up and uh i remember getting
[5:29] up on shore and i was just
[5:31] kind of shocked and recovering but now i
[5:33] can look back and see that
[5:35] you know god saved my life through my
[5:37] cousin matt
[5:39] and i thank the lord that he did that
[5:40] and i'll always be grateful to matt for
[5:42] saving my life
[5:49] my dad during this time taught me the
[5:51] greatest lesson i ever learned in my
[5:53] life
[5:54] you know i was a sports fanatic i loved
[5:56] at that time i really loved baseball and
[5:58] so i was a big fan of the oakland a's
[6:00] you know mark maguire and jose conseco
[6:03] but my dad
[6:03] of course you know he'd seen the miracle
[6:05] when he prayed for my mom
[6:07] my dad was constantly reading the bible
[6:10] and
[6:10] one day he just taught me the greatest
[6:12] lesson i ever learned he took one of my
[6:14] jose canseco baseball cards and
[6:16] my dad knew how religious i was about my
[6:19] sports
[6:20] so my dad took the jose canseco baseball
[6:23] card and he said jesse did you know last
[6:24] year
[6:25] jose canseco hit 42 home runs and i was
[6:27] like that's right dad
[6:28] yep and then my dad started teaching me
[6:32] this lesson he said did you know jose
[6:33] conseco
[6:34] doesn't like sports cars i said well dad
[6:37] he does i
[6:38] i read a sports illustrated article uh
[6:41] recently that said he does like sports
[6:43] cars
[6:43] and then my dad went on and uh was
[6:45] giving me more questions that were that
[6:48] were wrong about jose canseco
[6:50] and i was a little bit confused and i
[6:52] said dad
[6:54] dad why are you asking me these
[6:55] questions and he said
[6:57] son he said i want to let you know he
[7:00] said the reason i can't deceive you
[7:01] about jose canseco
[7:03] is because you know him so well you've
[7:06] studied him
[7:07] you read about him all the time and he
[7:09] said jesse that's how you have to be
[7:11] with jesus christ he said you have to
[7:13] know jesus christ so well
[7:16] that no man can deceive you and to this
[7:19] day
[7:20] i still consider that the greatest
[7:21] lesson i ever learned
[7:23] was that you and i need to know jesus
[7:25] christ
[7:26] so well that no man can deceive us
[7:29] and later i found out reading scripture
[7:31] that jesus christ said
[7:33] let no man deceive you
[7:44] after all these great lessons i learned
[7:46] and seen god heal my mom
[7:48] in the fifth grade i actually tried to
[7:50] start serving the lord
[7:51] i had a friend named eric and he invited
[7:53] me to
[7:54] his word of life club and i really
[7:57] enjoyed it they gave you a three-ring
[7:59] binder
[7:59] i started memorizing the scriptures and
[8:02] and i really was trying
[8:03] to serve the lord but a little later i
[8:07] got involved with some friends in school
[8:10] and i started listening to worldly music
[8:14] and i still remember it very distinctly
[8:16] when i bought my first
[8:18] non-christian music cd
[8:21] i started listening to that that was
[8:23] actually the moment
[8:25] that i stepped away from walking on
[8:28] god's path
[8:30] i mean i still wasn't saved i had not
[8:32] repented of all my sins but i was
[8:34] just trying to serve the lord and i
[8:36] enjoyed memorizing the scripture
[8:38] but it was through music i fell away but
[8:41] then later
[8:42] around 1999 when i just started college
[8:46] i saw music bring me back to the lord
[8:50] and i i found it was scriptural that
[8:52] wherever you leave the lord
[8:54] you've got to go back to where you left
[8:57] him in order to find him
[8:59] and the example was with abraham and in
[9:01] genesis
[9:02] abraham left the promised land to go
[9:05] down to egypt in a time of famine
[9:07] but later when he returned to the
[9:09] promised land the bible said he had to
[9:11] come back to the very same altar he
[9:14] first set up
[9:15] so abraham to get right with god he had
[9:18] to come back
[9:18] to his original altar and worship there
[9:21] once he got to the promised land
[9:23] so i saw looking back in my life that
[9:26] music was where i left god
[9:28] but then music would be god's tool
[9:32] to bring me back to him
[9:39] after fifth grade uh went to middle
[9:41] school and as i said the music had kind
[9:44] of drawn me away from the lord i started
[9:45] listening to worse and worse music all
[9:47] the time and
[9:48] using worse and worse language and the
[9:50] whole time i knew it was wrong
[9:54] and then one of the saddest moments of
[9:55] my life was when my parents divorced
[9:58] when i was in seventh grade but i know
[10:01] all things work together for good to
[10:03] them that love the lord
[10:05] but later through the divorce i learned
[10:06] that god would show me the truth that
[10:08] no matter what happens no matter what we
[10:10] may seem to lack
[10:12] god allows trials and and
[10:16] difficult situations that he might
[10:18] manifest
[10:19] his power in order to give your
[10:21] testimony a certain ring
[10:23] to it so with my dad's absence god put
[10:27] godly men and godly influences in my
[10:29] life
[10:30] and it also taught me that even though i
[10:33] was left as a child
[10:35] it taught me that i should never leave
[10:37] my children as well
[10:39] and i don't fault my dad and mom for
[10:42] their divorce that's between them and
[10:44] god
[10:44] but i just realized god can use any
[10:47] situation
[10:48] to bring glory to himself and god said
[10:51] he will never leave us or forsake us and
[10:54] so even though
[10:55] my parents were divorced and i felt
[10:56] forsaken god never forsook me
[10:59] he always provided for me he always took
[11:01] care of me and he gave me wonderful
[11:03] male role models as well as i was
[11:05] growing up like teachers and coaches
[11:07] and even family friends one of them was
[11:10] bruce flory he was my
[11:12] friend's dad and he would take brian his
[11:16] son and i and we'd go play basketball
[11:17] and
[11:19] there'd be many times we'd take a break
[11:21] and
[11:22] he would kind of lecture me and and uh
[11:24] teach me about
[11:25] god and he would hold me accountable and
[11:28] it wasn't very easy when i was younger
[11:30] but now i can look back and i thank the
[11:32] lord uh for his influence in my life
[11:34] because he got he
[11:36] he always told me uh to honor god and
[11:39] obey god's word
[11:40] and do what was right also we had a high
[11:42] school football coach named tim spiess
[11:44] and
[11:45] every thursday before the games on
[11:47] friday
[11:49] he would print off bible devotionals
[11:53] and ask us to read them and those
[11:55] devotionals were always helpful because
[11:57] they always got me thinking
[11:59] about god and all i can do is look back
[12:02] now and thank god
[12:03] that he had placed different men in my
[12:05] life to hold me accountable
[12:07] and try to influence me to serve god
[12:10] rather than myself
[12:16] and as i grew up you know we went to
[12:18] high school and
[12:20] had a great high school experience and
[12:23] my whole focus was sports at that time
[12:25] so and that kind of goes with my theme
[12:27] of running the race for christ
[12:30] i was just a sports fanatic i loved
[12:32] everything about sports
[12:35] i played football basketball and ran
[12:38] track
[12:39] but i always remembered you know what
[12:40] god did for my mom and going to church
[12:43] every week
[12:43] hearing preaching and seeing the holy
[12:46] spirit move you know even at our home
[12:48] church
[12:49] there was many times i would hear
[12:50] tongues and interpretation and
[12:52] people would be healed and so the power
[12:55] of god
[12:57] was constantly moving you know in our
[12:59] church services and so i was always
[13:01] convicted about the holy spirit
[13:02] there were so many times in high school
[13:04] i wanted to surrender
[13:06] and give my heart to god and go up to
[13:08] the altar but i never could because i
[13:10] was afraid
[13:11] i love the things of the world too much
[13:14] you know one time when i was 16 i
[13:15] actually finally surrendered i went to
[13:17] a baptismal class and i got baptized
[13:21] and i was so happy i felt so good uh
[13:25] repenting but right afterwards i
[13:27] realized it wasn't a full repentance
[13:29] because as soon as i got into the car
[13:31] i turned on worldly music and that
[13:34] worldly music you know
[13:35] directed my thoughts towards evil things
[13:37] my words
[13:38] so i never really had the change i
[13:40] really wanted to experience
[13:42] but god knows my heart and god was
[13:44] working on me and he was
[13:46] he was dealing with me but by god's
[13:48] grace
[13:50] just a few years later i would finally
[13:51] repent and surrender
[13:53] so in high school i just fully devoted
[13:55] myself to running you know sports
[13:57] and god gave us a lot of success in high
[14:00] school
[14:01] in football we were state champions in
[14:03] 1997
[14:05] and football was actually going to be a
[14:06] vehicle god was going to use
[14:08] to bring me to akron to fulfill my
[14:11] destiny i'd say
[14:13] you know one particular event was the
[14:14] state championship game in 1997
[14:17] i caught a touchdown pass and
[14:20] it's just so strange looking back now i
[14:21] wasn't even trying to serve the lord
[14:23] but after i caught that touchdown pass i
[14:25] got on a knee
[14:27] and i gave thanks to jesus for just
[14:29] letting me
[14:30] catch that touchdown pass i didn't know
[14:33] it but there were scouts from the
[14:34] university of akron
[14:35] at the game watching me of course they
[14:37] were watching all the players
[14:39] but it was through that state
[14:40] championship that the coaches got my
[14:42] name they got my information
[14:44] and then the next year i signed a letter
[14:46] of intent
[14:47] for a full college scholarship to play
[14:49] football at akron university
[14:52] but again i see how god used football
[14:55] and sports
[14:56] to direct me to akron to fulfill my
[14:59] destiny as a christian
[15:06] one other sort of spiritual event from
[15:08] high school was my senior year was my
[15:09] last race
[15:10] at the state championship in dayton and
[15:13] our first day at the state championship
[15:15] didn't go so well
[15:16] we were disappointed and the second day
[15:19] didn't start very well either and so my
[15:21] brother cam
[15:22] walked up to me and he gave me some
[15:25] really inspiring words
[15:27] and after cam's kind of like pep talk i
[15:30] went out and won the state championship
[15:32] in the long jump
[15:33] and the 100 meter and the 200 meter dash
[15:38] and i went back and looked at the video
[15:39] and i remember in the 200 dash i would
[15:42] always get really tired at the end
[15:43] but i prayed i had my head down and i
[15:46] prayed before the race and asked the
[15:47] lord to help me to win the race
[15:49] i didn't think i was going to win it but
[15:51] after praying i ran the race
[15:53] and after i won the race i remember i
[15:55] lifted my hands and i just shouted out
[15:57] and i thank god
[15:58] for letting me win the race and i'm not
[16:00] even a christian yet
[16:02] but i recognize god's power in my
[16:04] mother's life and
[16:05] the power of the holy spirit moving in
[16:07] our home church
[16:09] and i still gave god praise because i
[16:12] knew
[16:12] everything was by god's grace because i
[16:15] learned later
[16:16] sports records really aren't important
[16:18] to god records are made
[16:20] records fall no one really cares anymore
[16:22] i don't really care anymore
[16:24] but i saw how god was using it to teach
[16:26] me that he wanted me to run for him
[16:29] god was teaching me parallels between an
[16:31] athletic life
[16:33] and the christian life and i found out
[16:35] later that paul said
[16:36] know ye not that they which run in a
[16:38] race run all
[16:39] but one receiveth the prize so run
[16:43] that ye may obtain and every man that
[16:46] striveth for the mastery is temper in
[16:48] all things
[16:48] now they do it to obtain a corruptable
[16:50] crown but we
[16:52] an incorruptible crown so looking back
[16:55] now i can see how i
[16:56] devoted my entire life to running and to
[16:59] win
[17:00] the state championship to win the medal
[17:03] or the crown
[17:04] and god was showing me i have to be even
[17:07] more dedicated
[17:08] in order to win the incorruptible crown
[17:11] or the
[17:11] incorruptible medal eternal life through
[17:14] jesus christ our lord
[17:21] so in the fall of 1999 i went off to
[17:23] college and
[17:25] when i got there the doctors found out i
[17:27] had a fracture in my fifth lumbar i
[17:29] believe
[17:30] and so i had to sit out the whole fall
[17:32] season i couldn't play football
[17:34] i had to wear a brace but it was a time
[17:36] where i got to make some friends and
[17:38] god sent christian friends into my life
[17:41] like zach durr
[17:42] and then pastor mike arnold
[17:45] and since i had all this free time i was
[17:48] able to
[17:48] meet with mike and just get thinking
[17:51] about the things of god
[17:58] so in my freshman year i had this back
[18:00] brace on and
[18:01] um i was injured so
[18:04] i would have lots of weekends where i
[18:06] could drive home and see my girlfriend
[18:08] kristen and when i would go home my
[18:10] brother cam would let me borrow his car
[18:12] now cam had just become a christian he
[18:14] was the first one in our family
[18:16] to give his heart to the lord and so he
[18:19] was the answer to my mom's prayers all
[18:21] those years of
[18:22] taking her kids to church and wanting to
[18:24] see them save cam was the first one and
[18:26] then
[18:27] simon gave his heart to lord and i
[18:29] believe i was third
[18:30] when i finally gave my heart to the lord
[18:32] but driving cam's car
[18:34] he had his christian music in his car
[18:36] and one of the songs
[18:37] was called one of these days by ffh
[18:42] and i just remember the lyrics and they
[18:43] were saying one of these days i'm going
[18:46] to see the hands
[18:47] that took the nails for me and even as a
[18:51] sinner you know i was cussing and
[18:52] swearing i was addicted
[18:54] to tobacco watching all kinds of evil
[18:57] things
[18:58] but even as a sinner with a desire to
[19:00] serve god that music
[19:01] started softening my heart i could feel
[19:03] my heart of stone
[19:06] slowly breaking and through that music
[19:09] i started listening i started asking cam
[19:11] for to borrow his music and listen to
[19:13] his christian music
[19:14] it was through that music that god was
[19:17] bringing me back to him
[19:19] because i left god by listening to the
[19:21] wrong music
[19:22] and now listening to the right music was
[19:24] bringing me back to the lord
[19:27] and around the new year around 2000
[19:29] there was an athletes in action
[19:31] conference
[19:32] and i was invited to go when i got there
[19:34] i was just nervous you know around
[19:35] people
[19:36] but i saw a football player named tim
[19:39] anderson i'd known
[19:40] and he was sitting in the row in front
[19:43] of me and
[19:44] and i saw tim raise his hands and praise
[19:46] god
[19:47] at that moment i was so ashamed of my
[19:50] sin
[19:51] i was so ashamed of running from god and
[19:53] not living a real christian life
[19:55] that i started crying and i repented of
[19:57] my sin
[19:59] that very night and i was determined
[20:01] from this moment on
[20:02] i'm going to serve jesus christ with all
[20:04] my heart
[20:06] i didn't know this but on the very same
[20:08] night three hours away
[20:11] my girlfriend who's my wife now kristen
[20:14] went to a sanctus
[20:15] real concert and she had been to
[20:18] numerous concerts before but they kind
[20:19] of gave an
[20:20] altar call and she gave her heart to the
[20:23] lord
[20:23] on the very same night and so we can see
[20:27] god's supernatural hand
[20:29] she and i were just dating at the time
[20:30] we weren't christians
[20:32] but i can see god's hand to save us on
[20:35] the very same night
[20:36] three hours apart without any plans
[20:39] without any talk
[20:40] previously about christianity at all and
[20:43] so god was saving my future wife and i
[20:45] on the very same night getting us in one
[20:48] accord and in one mind
[20:50] and later we would get married and have
[20:52] children
[20:53] and serve the lord as the pastor and
[20:56] pastor's wife
[20:57] at the church in akron after the
[21:00] conference ended i remember specifically
[21:02] going back into my dorm
[21:03] and i was determined to serve jesus
[21:05] christ and i remember pulling down all
[21:07] my pictures off the wall of
[21:09] uh immorally dressed women and throwing
[21:12] them in the trash and i remember
[21:14] taking all my music you know i'd snoop
[21:16] dogg metallica nirvana
[21:18] i had country music i took all my
[21:20] worldly music
[21:22] and i threw it out in the trash can
[21:23] right outside our door
[21:25] and i started living a life the life god
[21:28] has always wanted me to live a
[21:30] real christian life he started cleaning
[21:32] me out
[21:33] he filled me with joy gladness happiness
[21:36] and i was so i was finally
[21:38] doing what i was called to do serve
[21:40] jesus christ
[21:47] college was a great experience after i
[21:49] was saved i was finally saved i
[21:51] finally got to go to church and raise my
[21:53] hands and read the bible for myself
[21:56] it was a wonderful time i felt like a
[21:58] transformed person
[21:59] i tried to witness to all my high school
[22:01] friends and give them sermons and
[22:04] try to influence anyone i could towards
[22:07] jesus christ
[22:08] i was also playing football and had some
[22:10] great experiences i got to play
[22:12] at the horseshoe in columbus i played
[22:15] against michael vick
[22:16] at virginia tech i played against ben
[22:19] rossberger
[22:21] at miami and while playing football
[22:24] i still had a desire uh to go to the nfl
[22:27] and i was working out and getting
[22:28] stronger i was up to about 190 pounds
[22:30] and
[22:30] i'd set two records uh there at akron
[22:33] for defensive backs with speed in the 40
[22:36] and then vertical jump but before the
[22:38] beginning of my sophomore season
[22:40] in the summer time we were playing seven
[22:43] on seven and i was number one on the
[22:45] depth chart in other words i was going
[22:46] to be the starting corner
[22:48] uh going into the next season i remember
[22:50] i deflected a pass when we're playing
[22:52] seven on seven and i landed on my
[22:54] and i landed on my left shoulder and
[22:56] separated my ac joint
[22:58] so that caused me to miss almost the
[23:00] whole season
[23:02] uh my sophomore year and after that i
[23:05] could never get as strong
[23:06] i could never get as fast no matter what
[23:08] i tried and i really look back now and
[23:11] i see it was god kind of shutting down
[23:13] my plans and my desires
[23:15] to try to become a professional football
[23:17] player and getting me more focused on
[23:20] him
[23:26] another life-changing event from college
[23:28] happened on
[23:29] thanksgiving night 2001. we were
[23:32] gathered at my family's house
[23:34] in wadsworth and my brother simon had
[23:37] recently given his heart to the lord
[23:39] and i really started studying the
[23:41] scripture and he said jess you've got to
[23:43] listen to this sermon it's called two
[23:45] seeds
[23:46] you gotta listen to it i said okay buddy
[23:48] okay so later that night we drove
[23:50] back to akron where i was living on the
[23:51] college campus
[23:53] and we listened to this sermon called
[23:54] two seeds and my eyes
[23:56] were totally opened uh the bible became
[23:59] a new bible
[24:01] and so at that time i started believing
[24:03] what we call
[24:04] the message of the hour which is god's
[24:07] revelation
[24:08] for today the whole bible restored the
[24:11] same power
[24:12] uh the same truth the same doctrine and
[24:15] that's according to prophecy jesus said
[24:17] in matthew 17
[24:18] 11 that elias would come and restore all
[24:21] things
[24:22] and acts 3 20-21 says that heaven will
[24:25] receive jesus
[24:26] until the restitution of all things so
[24:29] now in college the bible that i've loved
[24:31] now for a couple years has become a
[24:33] brand new bible
[24:34] and god begins revealing himself to me
[24:37] in ways that i never knew before
[24:39] there was times before i knew the
[24:41] message of the hour that i would just
[24:42] kind of scratch my head and what does
[24:43] that mean in the scripture
[24:45] but then after simon brought me these
[24:47] revelations and showed me the the truth
[24:49] from scripture
[24:50] the bible finally started to make sense
[24:53] and it was as jesus said he said the
[24:54] holy spirit will guide you
[24:56] into all truth and that's what i wanted
[24:59] all i wanted was truth as a christian
[25:02] i didn't care which group i had to
[25:03] belong to all i wanted to do was know
[25:05] the truth
[25:06] believe the truth and live the truth
[25:15] in june of 2003 my wife and i were
[25:18] married it was a wonderful day
[25:20] but the day after we went to church and
[25:23] that was the day
[25:24] where the holy spirit filled me i
[25:27] remember we got there a little late
[25:29] but brother brooks was preaching the
[25:30] word of god in power and he was
[25:33] he was focusing on how the blood of
[25:34] jesus christ
[25:36] separates you from all your sins
[25:39] and it will cleanse you and it keeps you
[25:42] and it will
[25:43] guide you into every good work according
[25:45] to hebrews 13.
[25:46] and i remember he was just preaching
[25:48] under the anointing i got so
[25:50] emotional and loving god i just stood up
[25:53] and it was at that moment
[25:54] it's the only time it happened it felt
[25:56] like i had a vision in my mind and
[25:58] i saw i saw jesus on the cross and i saw
[26:01] them
[26:01] nailing the nails into his hands and i
[26:04] started weeping and
[26:06] i could feel the vibrations of the nail
[26:09] pounds
[26:10] and i just after he was nailed to the
[26:11] cross i just started worshiping him and
[26:14] praising him and asking god to
[26:16] forgive me and and i just was just
[26:19] praising him and magnifying the name of
[26:21] the lord
[26:23] and as i left that church i felt like
[26:26] i've never felt before i was so full of
[26:28] love
[26:29] i remember shaking people's hands and
[26:30] just thinking i just want to love people
[26:33] i just want to share god's love with
[26:36] everyone and so i realized that was the
[26:39] moment i was born again
[26:40] because the bible says the love of god
[26:43] is shed in your hearts
[26:44] by the holy ghost i'd been seeking the
[26:47] holy ghost for
[26:48] a couple years at that point and i never
[26:51] really
[26:52] felt like i had a real experience where
[26:54] heaven came down
[26:56] to dwell in my soul but i believe on
[26:58] that day the day after i was married
[27:00] i believe god came down and filled my
[27:02] soul with his holy ghost
[27:04] his seal with the love of god
[27:12] so during my senior year of college
[27:14] after the football season
[27:15] ended my friend tim myers kept urging me
[27:19] to preach and i knew i
[27:21] i knew i needed to i always after i
[27:23] became a follower of the message of the
[27:25] hour
[27:25] i just always felt a pull to the pulpit
[27:28] and
[27:29] tim was praying of course working on me
[27:31] and so in january of 2004 i finally
[27:33] started preaching the gospel
[27:35] i just started there in akron ohio and
[27:38] then i got an invitation from my
[27:40] future pastor isaiah brooks to preach in
[27:42] lima
[27:43] and i really want to know if god wanted
[27:45] me to preach so i fasted a couple days
[27:47] before preaching
[27:48] and i just said god please prove to me
[27:51] that you want me to preach your gospel
[27:54] and even before i preach there was a
[27:56] sister named karen sanders and
[27:58] she gave like a word of knowledge right
[28:01] before i started speaking and it was
[28:02] almost prophetic
[28:04] uh for telling what i was going to
[28:05] preach on and after i preached god's
[28:07] word the altar was full of people
[28:09] repenting crying weeping uh
[28:13] rededicating their lives to the lord i
[28:15] know one brother in particular came up
[28:16] and told me he got delivered
[28:18] from an addiction after that service
[28:22] and so the lord had proven to me that i
[28:24] was to preach the gospel and i thank the
[28:25] lord for that
[28:26] i just want to serve the lord in any
[28:28] capacity that i can
[28:31] after preaching for a few months brother
[28:32] brooks ordained me in august of 2004
[28:36] as a minister of the gospel
[28:43] about two years later um the lord kind
[28:46] of put it on our hearts
[28:47] to start a church in akron and so we
[28:50] prayed beforehand we talked with our
[28:51] pastor
[28:52] isaiah brooks and in june of 2006
[28:57] we started a church in akron and i
[28:59] remember i was
[29:00] before we decided i remember i was just
[29:02] you know praying about it and
[29:04] meditating on the things of god and i
[29:05] was i was up sitting
[29:07] uh in my upstairs in chicago falls and i
[29:09] said lord if you want me
[29:11] to be a pastor please show me
[29:14] and i've never done this before and i've
[29:16] never done it since
[29:19] but i just said lord i'm going to open
[29:21] up the bible and and please
[29:23] just speak to me through your bible if
[29:25] you really want me to be a pastor or not
[29:28] i've already i'd already been preaching
[29:30] about two years but i didn't know if i
[29:31] had it
[29:32] i didn't know if i should pass or not so
[29:35] i just close my bible and i open it up
[29:38] and i put my finger down on a page and i
[29:41] pointed to first timothy 4
[29:42] 12 and it said let no man despise thy
[29:45] youth
[29:46] be thou an example of the believers in
[29:48] word and conversation
[29:49] in charity and spirit in faith and in
[29:52] purity
[29:53] so anyone that knows this passage uh
[29:55] knows that paul was encouraging a young
[29:57] preacher named timothy
[29:59] uh to preach god's word despite how
[30:02] young he was
[30:04] and so i took that as my final
[30:05] vindication that god wanted me to pastor
[30:08] and so i started pastoring at 25 years
[30:10] old
[30:11] in akron ohio we started a church with
[30:13] seven
[30:14] wonderful faithful members
[30:22] so the next few years saw my wife and i
[30:24] grow our family god blessed us with
[30:27] uh multiple children we're so grateful
[30:29] for all of them
[30:31] around 2009 i started getting a desire
[30:34] to preach overseas and so from 2009 to
[30:38] 2013 i made uh
[30:39] four trips to south america and trinidad
[30:43] and preached the word of god there
[30:45] and it was during this time that god
[30:46] really showed me the power
[30:48] of the gospel of jesus christ one trip
[30:51] in particular
[30:52] i saw so much supernatural for about 13
[30:56] days it just felt like i was just
[30:58] constantly walking in the presence of
[31:00] god
[31:02] one night in particular we just finished
[31:04] up a series of meetings
[31:05] and i was doing my my journaling at the
[31:08] end of the day as i normally did when i
[31:09] traveled and someone knocked on my door
[31:11] and
[31:12] and they said you need to come out and
[31:13] pray for this young lady she's got a
[31:15] demon on her
[31:16] and i'll be honest i was very nervous i
[31:18] never cast out a demon before
[31:20] and so i went out there and talked with
[31:22] her
[31:23] and there was all this crowd of young
[31:25] people gathered around maybe 10 or 12
[31:27] people and
[31:28] and this girl was just staring ahead and
[31:31] she'd barely talk and and you could tell
[31:33] something was wrong with her
[31:36] i didn't know what to do i know they
[31:37] wanted me to pray for her but all of a
[31:38] sudden
[31:39] uh the words of a minister brother troy
[31:42] swadey
[31:43] his words i'd heard him say a few days
[31:45] earlier it felt like they dropped down
[31:46] from heaven
[31:48] and the words came to my mind it said
[31:50] perfect love
[31:51] casts out demons and once that anointing
[31:55] dropped down
[31:57] i knew god was going to drive the demons
[31:59] out of this
[32:00] young lady and then the scripture came
[32:02] to me before jesus
[32:04] did a miracle many times he would put
[32:06] out all the unbelievers
[32:08] and so we were out in just a kind of
[32:10] public setting so i said well
[32:12] i called a few pastors and preachers i
[32:14] said hey let's go pray for this girl i
[32:16] said would you come with me
[32:17] so i knew we had to get away from any of
[32:19] the unbelief and all the commotion so
[32:21] that god could deliver this woman
[32:23] so we took her over far away from the
[32:26] crowd and we just
[32:27] joined hands and i was so confident
[32:30] because that anointing dropped down
[32:31] we joined hands and i asked her i said
[32:33] do you want to be delivered from this
[32:34] demon
[32:35] you know and she's staring ahead and she
[32:37] said yes she just nod her head and said
[32:39] yes
[32:40] and i close my eyes and i said in the
[32:42] name of jesus christ i said
[32:44] by the blood of jesus christ satan
[32:47] the holy spirit is against you and as
[32:50] soon as i said that
[32:51] this woman who i was holding her hand
[32:52] started shaking and fighting me but i
[32:56] was
[32:56] i was totally calm because of the holy
[32:58] spirit and i just kept praying and i
[33:00] started rebuking the devil
[33:02] in the name of jesus christ and pretty
[33:04] soon she let out this loud scream
[33:07] and just fell down to the ground and was
[33:09] passed out
[33:10] and we stood there for a few moments uh
[33:13] and then
[33:14] we tried to wake her up eventually she
[33:15] woke up and she stood up and
[33:17] her face had totally changed and i said
[33:19] let's stand here
[33:20] let's give god praise for god delivering
[33:23] you from this
[33:24] uh evil spirit and later i found out in
[33:27] the scripture in mark chapter 9
[33:29] that the same thing happened when jesus
[33:31] cast out devils in
[33:33] mark 9 26 the bible said the spirit
[33:35] cried
[33:36] and rent him sore and came out of him
[33:39] and he was as one dead in so much that
[33:41] many said he is dead
[33:43] but jesus took him by the hand and
[33:45] lifted him up and he arose
[33:48] on that trip there was probably four or
[33:49] five more times that we cast
[33:51] demons out of people one time
[33:54] one of the women even bit me but you
[33:56] know no blood was shed
[33:58] and i thank the lord for that one time
[34:00] the demon fought
[34:01] so hard at the girl that the girl's
[34:04] glasses flew off her
[34:06] they were stomped on but by god's grace
[34:08] we had enough money there we gave her
[34:10] some money to pay for the glasses
[34:12] so that satan wouldn't get the victory
[34:14] but god would get the victory
[34:16] and even returning home to united states
[34:18] there's been a couple of times i've seen
[34:21] uh the same power of god to cast out
[34:23] demons out of people
[34:25] and each time it has been the same where
[34:27] they'll cry out
[34:28] and then it looks like they passed out
[34:31] but then they come back and they feel
[34:32] better
[34:33] and they rejoice and so it's beautiful
[34:36] to see that
[34:36] jesus christ is the same yesterday today
[34:39] and forever he still drives out demons
[34:42] when people want to be free from demons
[34:44] and may god get all the glory for each
[34:46] time this happens
[34:49] there were a couple more really powerful
[34:51] testimonies from
[34:52] guyana before the final service on one
[34:55] of the trips i fasted the whole day
[34:57] prayed studied all day and i preached
[35:00] through god's anointing for about two
[35:02] hours maybe more
[35:04] and the power of the holy ghost was so
[35:06] strong in that place
[35:08] there was a long prayer line maybe 10 or
[35:10] 20 people come up for prayer for
[35:11] different needs
[35:13] one man in particular was an older man
[35:15] and he came up and he said he had
[35:16] trouble with arthritis
[35:17] we prayed for him and he kind of went to
[35:19] the back of the line we prayed for
[35:21] people to get the holy ghost and they
[35:22] were screaming and crying and praising
[35:24] the lord
[35:25] it was a wonderful time after i sat down
[35:28] the gentleman the older gentleman came
[35:29] up and tapped me said brother jesse he
[35:31] said
[35:32] god has healed me of my arthritis and i
[35:34] was just so tired but i was sweating but
[35:36] i said praise the lord i said brother
[35:37] you go up there and testify so he you
[35:40] know
[35:40] gently asked for a chance to testify he
[35:43] got the microphone and
[35:45] he shared what god did and so he marched
[35:47] up and down
[35:48] uh the front of the church back and
[35:50] forth just rejoicing and declaring
[35:52] how god had held him of arthritis
[35:55] there's another great testimony
[35:59] where we were preaching at a different
[36:00] church and it was a hot day i remember
[36:03] as a wednesday morning we had a morning
[36:04] service
[36:05] and it was the only sermon i ever
[36:07] preached without looking at my notes one
[36:09] time
[36:10] i preached on astronaut faith which is
[36:12] basically a message about how
[36:14] um as science has progressed so god's
[36:17] word has
[36:18] progressed the revelation of it and
[36:21] there was so many people that were just
[36:23] paying attention and listening
[36:25] but one in particular was a young mother
[36:26] and she was holding a baby
[36:29] throughout the whole service and she
[36:31] came up for prayer
[36:32] and she said she had a kidney stone and
[36:34] she would like prayer for that
[36:36] i said of course sister we'll pray for
[36:37] you and it was a
[36:40] more quiet service but after the service
[36:42] we sang we prayed
[36:44] i just went outside the church building
[36:46] and sat on a little bench and i was just
[36:47] wiping the sweat off my brow
[36:49] and all of a sudden this young mother
[36:50] comes up and she's she's so filled with
[36:53] joy you can see the joy on her face
[36:55] and she said brother jesse i just want
[36:57] to share with you
[36:59] after you prayed for me for the kidney
[37:00] stone she said i went back to my seat
[37:02] and i held my baby there and i was just
[37:04] praising the lord and she said
[37:06] as i was singing i felt the power of god
[37:10] calm down really warm upon my kidney
[37:13] stone and she said she didn't know what
[37:15] it was
[37:17] but it got really warm and then she said
[37:19] she felt that
[37:20] kidney stone leave down her leg and go
[37:23] out of her body
[37:24] and she said i just want to tell you
[37:26] that god has healed me of the kidney
[37:27] stone
[37:28] and we just i just sat there rejoicing
[37:30] and praising the lord
[37:33] and so those trips to guyana really
[37:35] showed me the power of god
[37:37] and how if we come with faith jesus said
[37:40] all things are possible
[37:42] to them that believe
[37:49] over the years we've continued to pastor
[37:50] in akron we just passed our 14th
[37:52] anniversary
[37:53] we've had many great highlights over the
[37:55] years i'll just share a couple to
[37:57] encourage you
[37:58] you know one morning i woke up and i was
[38:00] really led of the holy spirit on a
[38:01] sunday morning to preach and
[38:03] i preached a sermon called five
[38:04] identifications of her true church
[38:07] a wonderful message originally preached
[38:09] by brother branham
[38:11] and i came to church and i preached it
[38:14] and a sister came up i'm going to try
[38:15] not to use names
[38:16] came up for prayer and said she had
[38:18] bleeding kind of like female trouble
[38:21] and we just prayed for her and she said
[38:24] as soon as we prayed
[38:25] she felt the blood dry up she said as we
[38:28] prayed the blood dried up
[38:30] and then she and her husband called me
[38:32] the next day on a monday night and just
[38:33] were rejoicing
[38:35] telling me how god had healed her
[38:38] and reminded me of the scripture when
[38:40] the woman with the blood issue
[38:41] you know by faith she had to come and
[38:43] press through the crowd and when she
[38:45] touched jesus
[38:47] the virtue and power of christ flowed
[38:49] out of him into her
[38:51] and she felt the bleeding dry up in her
[38:53] body and god had given the victory
[38:56] and her faith had brought about the
[38:59] healing
[39:01] so that was another moment where the
[39:03] power of god from the bible
[39:05] was proven to be the same here in our
[39:07] day and i believe that was 2015 if i'm
[39:09] not mistaken
[39:11] recently we've seen god move through the
[39:13] power of the speaking of the word
[39:15] you know jesus said if you speak to the
[39:17] mountain and if you
[39:19] say move he said if you doubt not
[39:23] he said you'll have what you asked for
[39:25] and the mountain will move
[39:27] recently we've seen this in about four
[39:28] cases and i'm going to try not to use
[39:30] names
[39:30] just for people's uh privacy but the
[39:33] first time we saw it was
[39:35] with the brother from our church named
[39:36] jose we went and visited one of his
[39:38] family members
[39:39] and it was a couple that couldn't have
[39:41] children and so
[39:43] jose said they wanted prayer so we just
[39:45] went over there
[39:46] i remember jose had his guitar we just
[39:48] sang a few songs and i really felt the
[39:50] anointing of god there
[39:52] and we said we're going to pray for you
[39:54] that you can have a baby
[39:56] and we prayed and people were weeping
[39:57] and crying just praising the lord in a
[39:59] real simple humble
[40:00] atmosphere and jose looked at them and
[40:02] he said you're going to have a baby
[40:04] now i was a little nervous at that time
[40:06] i was enjoying the anointing
[40:08] but god had spoken through our brother
[40:11] that god had heard our prayers and they
[40:14] were going to have a baby
[40:16] i'd forgotten about it but fast forward
[40:19] to the
[40:20] the next november i got a text from
[40:23] brother jose saying that
[40:25] this couple had had a baby boy and it
[40:28] was born
[40:29] on my birthday and so that was a great
[40:31] moment where god was showing me his
[40:33] power
[40:34] and i believe he was just showing me his
[40:36] grace that when we follow his leadership
[40:39] when we minister to other people
[40:41] when we speak his word in faith god
[40:43] hears us and god answers
[40:45] and god moves in his time and season
[40:48] not long after that there was a
[40:49] co-worker i had and she and her husband
[40:52] couldn't have children and so i was
[40:54] trying to encourage her i did a bible
[40:56] study with her went over to her house
[40:57] and met with her and her husband
[40:59] i was just really burdened for this this
[41:02] co-worker and
[41:03] you know just like any of us she would
[41:05] battle and say well i don't know we will
[41:07] probably never have a child or anything
[41:09] like that
[41:10] and i was just really impressed and one
[41:12] saturday morning i was just in
[41:14] i was just in prayer and i got on my
[41:17] knees and
[41:18] the anointing of god just came over me i
[41:21] remember there i was just looking out my
[41:22] back window
[41:24] and i said in the name of jesus christ i
[41:26] speak
[41:27] to that mountain of barrenness i speak
[41:30] to that mountain of infertility
[41:32] and i command commanded to move in the
[41:34] name of jesus christ
[41:36] now i'm weeping i'm crying i knew
[41:38] something
[41:39] supernatural had happened after i
[41:41] studied i went upstairs and told my wife
[41:43] i said i think i
[41:45] prophesied or i think i foretold in the
[41:48] name of the lord that this couple's
[41:49] gonna
[41:50] have a baby and it was just a few days
[41:53] or weeks after that i couldn't quite
[41:55] remember what it was
[41:56] i got a text from that co-worker and
[42:00] she and her husband sent me a picture of
[42:02] their pregnancy test that they were
[42:04] pregnant
[42:05] and then nine months later they had a
[42:06] little baby girl so that was just a
[42:08] beautiful moment when there was a lot of
[42:10] doubt and
[42:11] everybody was battling doubt we speak
[42:13] god's word
[42:14] and mountains have to move when they're
[42:17] commanded to move
[42:18] through the name of jesus christ the
[42:21] last one i'll share was just something
[42:22] that happened
[42:23] this past year there's a brother in our
[42:25] church and his dad
[42:27] had a heart attack and uh he had
[42:30] actually died and his daughter gave him
[42:32] mouth-to-mouth cpr
[42:34] but then thankfully the paramedics were
[42:36] able to shock his heart and bring him
[42:38] back to life
[42:39] and that happened on a tuesday night i
[42:41] remember
[42:42] and i didn't know anything about it well
[42:44] that night i had trouble sleeping and i
[42:46] woke up for some reason at 4 15 a.m
[42:48] and there was just three scriptures on
[42:50] my heart and one of them was
[42:52] there's power of life and death in the
[42:56] tongue
[42:58] well later that morning i was working
[43:00] and i got a call from a brother in our
[43:02] church brother amen
[43:03] and he let me know about the heart
[43:05] attack and he said can you pray
[43:07] and i just again felt the presence of
[43:09] the holy spirit and so i said yeah let's
[43:11] pray
[43:12] i left my office and i went out to our
[43:15] deck and i had the phone here
[43:17] and i was looking out you know at the
[43:19] morning sky
[43:20] and as we prayed let's i said let's just
[43:22] agree
[43:24] and i said i speak to the mountain of
[43:26] that heart trouble
[43:27] in the name of jesus christ and i
[43:29] command it to leave
[43:31] and we just agreed we just agreed by
[43:34] faith
[43:35] uh now two weeks went by and nothing
[43:38] seemed to get better uh because of coven
[43:40] 19
[43:41] uh the family wasn't even allowed to see
[43:43] him but the following sunday
[43:45] the brother in our church his son came
[43:47] up and uh
[43:48] we prayed with a prayer cloth and just
[43:51] believed god was going to do something
[43:53] and we would just keep encouraging
[43:55] ourselves just speak life
[43:56] speak life he's going to be well just
[43:58] speak life
[44:00] and so the brother in our church went to
[44:03] see his dad
[44:04] and the nurses or doctor tried to say or
[44:08] tried to convince him
[44:09] to pull the plug because he wasn't even
[44:11] breathing on his own
[44:13] and the brother in our church wouldn't
[44:15] accept that he wouldn't take that for an
[44:16] answer
[44:17] and we just kept praying and believing
[44:19] speaking the word well two days later
[44:21] after that
[44:22] visit his dad woke up
[44:25] and then not long after that he started
[44:27] talking and it didn't make sense at
[44:28] first but it
[44:30] pretty soon it started making sense and
[44:32] then just a few days after he woke up
[44:34] he went home just as the holy spirit
[44:36] spoke
[44:37] and now this is a month or two later uh
[44:40] he's back to his normal life i guess he
[44:42] goes out in the garage works
[44:44] and just as it was spoken by the holy
[44:46] spirit
[44:47] uh the mountain of the heart trouble
[44:49] left and now he's back home he's well
[44:52] even though the doctor said
[44:54] uh he was going to die and there was no
[44:55] hope for him the spoken word
[44:58] of the holy spirit moved in a great way
[45:01] and it will always operate to give god
[45:04] glory
[45:05] jesus christ is the same yesterday today
[45:08] and forever
[45:10] and just wait for his anointing wait for
[45:12] his leadership because jesus said apart
[45:14] from me
[45:14] you can do nothing we don't have any
[45:17] power of ourselves
[45:18] to do anything supernatural but if we
[45:21] speak god's word
[45:22] when god tells us to do it and believe
[45:24] it and stay with it
[45:26] god will move and god will be glorified
[45:29] in your life and you'll see the
[45:30] supernatural power
[45:31] of jesus christ operate for his glory
[45:40] so in closing i just want to encourage
[45:42] you to run the race for jesus christ
[45:45] running and athletic events was a big
[45:47] part of my life
[45:48] that's how i met a lot of people you
[45:50] know through high school
[45:52] sporting events and college sporting
[45:54] events but those were great lessons i
[45:56] learned a lot of great lessons through
[45:58] sports
[45:59] eating right sleeping right taking care
[46:02] of your body
[46:03] being fully devoted to sports
[46:07] and god used all those sporting events
[46:10] to show me how he wanted me to serve him
[46:14] just as i had worked so hard in sports
[46:16] and been so dedicated
[46:18] god was showing me i need to show that
[46:20] same dedication
[46:21] to being a christian and in high school
[46:24] i love sprinting events but
[46:26] now god has shown me the christian life
[46:29] is a distance event and the bible says
[46:32] run the race for jesus christ like you
[46:34] will be the one
[46:35] that will win the race take care of your
[46:38] body take care of your mind
[46:40] and so i've learned with sports i could
[46:41] have a few days off
[46:43] running for athletic events and for
[46:46] athletic purposes
[46:47] but with jesus christ i've learned i
[46:49] don't want to take any days off
[46:51] i want to run every day for jesus christ
[46:53] i want to be fully devoted for jesus
[46:55] christ
[46:56] i want to discipline my body my mind
[47:00] my spirit my thinking i want to love the
[47:03] lord my god
[47:05] with all my heart soul mind and strength
[47:08] so i want to encourage all the listeners
[47:10] if you're not running for jesus christ i
[47:12] would encourage you
[47:13] start running the race it is the only
[47:16] race that really matters
[47:18] to run the christian race follow acts 2
[47:21] 38
[47:22] then peter said unto them repent and be
[47:24] baptized every one of you
[47:26] in the name of jesus christ for the
[47:28] remission of sins
[47:29] and ye shall receive the gift of the
[47:32] holy ghost
[47:34] true repentance is changing your mind
[47:36] and actions
[47:38] heartily making amends for past wrongs
[47:40] and hating
[47:41] sin god bless you
[47:45] and may jesus christ be the desire of
[47:47] your heart
