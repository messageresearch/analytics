TRANSCRIPT
========================================
through my [Music] sickness darkness jesus you got me through my addiction depression [Music] i am grateful that you thought of me and if right where i am is right where you are then i'm right where i'm supposed to be [Music] god bless you and welcome to defending the message podcast i'm your co-host pastor jesse smith and i am eamon lee we're excited to bring you part three the conclusion to our brother austin laramie's testimony about him receiving the message of the hour at our last podcast we left off where barrow austin went to arizona and that's where we're planning to start on this one can you explain in detail um what happened when you went to arizona and how the lord worked with you in that area yes when i got to arizona it was like a a new beginning for real and uh i just remember getting there and just it's the first time i had been sober for a long time and i just remember like sitting and replaying in my head the last year the actions and everything that i went through and that happened and it was like i just ended up you know being in a very bad depression when i was staying with my grandma and grandpa it was cool you know the first couple days were exciting you know this new start fresh start and i've never been out west before so you know you got the beautiful mountains you know all the palm trees it's a super nice city but then you know i just started thinking really deeply on what happened you know just really messing with me i was just i just gave up everything you know just left everything on a dime so it was like pretty traumatizing so i started my first few weeks out there pretty you know uh optimistic but then uh as everything started to set in you know i just got real depressed and i would uh i would sit in my room literally all day long for hours at a time like i mean days at a time i'll just stay in my room i wouldn't even go out to the living room and talk to my grandparents or nothing you know i just had very bad anxiety too was like just sit in my room and just listen to music instrumentals and try to write lyrics and i would play guitar for hours at a time so my grandma and grandpa they're old school they don't really claim depression and all that they're like you know if you talk about depression like man like you're not depressed like what's depressing like you know you sound corny or whatever you know that's that's the attitude they had towards it so my grandma didn't really get it so i remember we were always getting arguments because she thought i was just being rude you know she's like you came out here you know but you're not even hanging out with us talking to us and i'll just try to explain to her that i was depressed but she wasn't feeling it she's like no you're just you're just rude and you don't really care about us and you know you're just using us you know and and my room would be messy because i literally wouldn't even shower i wouldn't clean my room sometimes i mean it wasn't that messy but for her one jacket on the ground is a wreck i mean but it was more than that though it was kind of messy but but so she would like you know call me lazy so you don't even clean you know nothing you know and and it really wasn't laziness i was just mad if anybody ever went through depression they understand what i'm talking about so it's like you're not yourself so and you have no motivation to do anything like i had no will to live at this point in my life i didn't really care what happened in my life anymore so i remember always bumping heads on my grandma getting really bad arguments at first because she you know she just didn't understand my grandpa kind of did understand he would always tell me i'm not depressed i don't have anxiety that i don't claim it but he understood though he was more compassionate so we we were cool but uh so i just stayed like that pretty much the first year they just stayed in my room and wrote music but then um i got a job ended up getting a job at dollar general you know i started branching out that was like the third month i was there and through that job uh this lady that worked there you know we were talking and she figured out i do music and uh she knew this kid named johnny and he just so happened to make really good music she was telling me his music he was really good he's really talented and he so happened to have a studio so you know i had some songs ready i met him and i started going to the studio a lot just recording music and then like the first time first day i met him we became like instantly cool he was such a cool dude we're still cool to this day so i just we just started recording songs together and just i just spent all my spare time in the studio so that i learned a lot by him i learned how to you know audio engineer you know mixed vocals and all that so it's like you know ordained my god so but i was still depressed through all of this so i was out there probably almost four years in that same state i mean a whole the first whole year i stayed in my room for hours if i wasn't at the studio at work out as soon as i got home and went to my room laid down went to sleep or just writing music all day all day long yelled at by my grandma like you don't care about us you know that it wasn't the case but and then eventually i came back to akron for a couple months i got my friend matt to move out there with me and he started staying at my grandma's with me too and then shortly after we got back my grandpa got diagnosed with hip cancer so that was pretty crazy and i was pretty much in denial of that and he did hospice he he didn't want any treatment he was like i don't even care you know he's like i lived a great life i'm ready to go my grandma's trying to get him to go get treatment he don't want it he's like let me just die so and i was still depressed so i really the sadness didn't really hit me with that too lord i was like just like oh okay you know it's just in denial and we i just i just watched him get weaker and weaker every day you know he used to be so funny and then he just got weaker and weaker and silly until he eventually passed away so that was like a eye-opener you know and it's like i realized you know if i didn't actually go crazy and move to arizona then i probably wouldn't have been able to have a relationship with them because growing up i didn't really see them that much so i didn't really you know last time i saw them before i moved out to the first time was probably when i was still a kid and i moved out there when i was 19 or 20 maybe so you know so i didn't know he's gonna get cancer you know uh two years after i moved out there so you know it's i got to get a relationship with him you know and so yeah that happened and then um this was like the the flat line of my whole journey was just pretty stagnant and growth uh i stayed out there once matt was out there with me you know i i was still depressed but i started to at least branch out a little bit more you know i started getting used to my surroundings went to johnny's a lot more i had a couple friends out there and uh yeah and then um i remember like another year goes by you know not much changes i'm still depressed anxious not thinking mind you every day every day i was thinking about the message still felt guilty i'm like oh oh this is pointless i'm doing all this music disappointment i had this dream to be in you know hollywood so i was like this is all pointless every day that's where my anxiety was spawning from because every day i tell myself i'm going to hell i'm like oh man i'm on my way to hell i'm on my way to hell i'm like why am i what is wrong like you know i it's like the message marked me it left a permanent mark inside of me so i was like oh like no matter what i did i couldn't get satisfied so i was just so depressed and anxious i'm like all this is pointless but my goal you know is to get rich and then repent you know but it doesn't work like that and then you know eventually move out and then and then we go out and get his cousin to live with us bring him out here that was december 2019 we got his cousin in so and so 2020 comes you know it's march it's spring break it's like the height of lake havasu i mean everybody's partying so we're out there i remember you know it's like a huge spring break town out this city like all colleges go out there for spring break and a little back story when i was a dollar general like the very first year i worked out there is where i met my current girlfriend lina she would always walk in so dollar general all the time she was new out there like me and i always thought she was really pretty so i was like oh i was like cool i was like finally someone she always used to look at me like me mugged me she was like i didn't think she was into me so i didn't really press the issue at all all i really got was her name that's it her name and that's really it but so i remember she stopped coming in one day and then i'm like huh you know i started thinking like i don't see her anymore and then uh that's when i went back to akron around that time too and then came back out so now we're here we are in 2020 march and i'm walking with matt at spring break you know just in the big crowd and then i see this girl waving at me this this random girl and and i look in matt and i'm like i don't know if this girl is waving at me or not but i don't want to look stupid and and go walk up to her so i'm just going to stand here and she walks up to me so she was like hey my friend is here something like that and now look so she takes me and it's actually lena it's the girl that you know i didn't see any more dollars generally this is like a year and a half later so i see lena finally oh i was like hey what's up you know i said hi and stuff i was like cool to see you know i haven't seen you in a while you know so finally got her number and all that you know after that day you know we just started talking really heavily you know and just really became pretty close and then uh eventually i started working at a resort around this time and that was the job i kept all the way till i came back to akron where i am now but and uh ever since the first time we hung out we hung out every single day since too so it was cool and we eventually started dating and i remember when the pandemic started my grandma i was back at my grandma's at this time and my grandma didn't want me living with her no more because she's in bed she has like a lot of respiratory problems so and we didn't know what it was you know nobody it was when nobody knew what kobe was so i was like i understand so i was homeless but i was just living in hotels or austin when did you feel that to come back while you're over there i remember one day i don't know what spawned it i don't i mean it was probably the pandemic that definitely spawned it because i hate health epidemics like i literally don't like sicknesses but uh you know through dating lena lina showed me that there's still traditional and loyal women out here and like she kind of shocked me and through dating her i kind of like i was still depressed but i started thinking about my future i started wanting a family started wanting kids you know started thinking about being a better person you know elevating myself you know so after coming to this realization that i really like lena i'm like oh man like she's a really really uh a good person you know i was like man she's making me think about all my flaws now you know which i never thought about improving myself sounds like the only way this is going to work is if i introduce her to the message you know so i started thinking about god again at this point i'm literally prepared to break up with her i'm like all right i got to go back to i got to go back to akron eventually i just had this epiphany i need to go back to god i need to go back to akron i've been out here at this point probably three years at this point and it was still stagnant super depressed still sometimes had suicidal thoughts but never once i wanted to act on it no more didn't do drugs anymore i mean i still smoked but i wasn't doing any hard drugs anymore you know it was nothing crazy doing a lot of music like just fell in love with music even more and so i tell her about the message i spent like a whole hour just telling the whole story of what i just told you on the last two podcasts and everything how i met brother jesse and all that and and then at the end of it i'm like what are you thinking she literally just says and i remind you i'm like all right you know she's never left her family before you know she's never even left california she's from california we're in arizona she's never left the state before you know or even let alone been to the east side of the united states and ohio and so i'm you know i'm telling her yeah we got to move we got to go out here you know to this church where she does not gonna know you know this is me telling her about a whole bunch of people she's not gonna know in a place that she's never been and all she says is all right let's do it and i was like what i said that's it that's all you got to say about that so i was like that's cool and she's like yeah let's do it you know she's like i'm down i was like all right cool i was like i was like i was prepared to break up with you if you said no you know i was like i gotta go back i think the things are getting crazy in the world you know i'm tired of being depressed and anxious about dying all the time and going to hell so told her about that shortly after i told lena about the message as anybody was she was wondering if this was the right move i mean this is a big move you know she's gonna leave everything i'm everything behind she's she has no connection out here except for me literally so it's like she was she was wondering you know if this was the right move she was praying and i remember like we were talking about some of my rants about god i probably was mentioning how you know everything this life is really just temporary and this isn't even real life like you know life begins after we're out of our flesh like it's it's really hard to think about but as humans you know it's just that's like a divine thought like that's hard to think about so i remember she was working at goodwill one day she told me this ladies while her she was just working just randomly came up to her that she didn't know at all and the lady was like hey uh god told me to tell you that everything in his life is temporary just live for god you know just you need to live for god and then she was just like god bless you have a good day and then you know that was it and then she said lina told me after she told me that she said that was like the vindicator that this was the right move to make so that was you know that was pretty supernatural so that was a good thing so ever since that time she was fully convinced on this move and obviously the the fruit of this move has been nothing but blessings so it's the right move and a little side note the same time my grandpa died of cancer was the same time her grandma died of cancer as well so that's also another way we bonded and it was it was like supernatural it was so weird because our both our grandparents died of cancer the same like within like the same three months yeah so that was pretty weird too we're both going through the same things also we want to i want you to share about kathy and then um probably a month before we moved to akron i remember i would take these shuttles to work they're like this company that you would pay five bucks because lake havasu is kind of a small city and you pay five bucks and they'll just give you a ride anywhere you know it's called day and night shuttle i would i took them so much i was cool with like everybody that worked there they all knew me you know so i remember the the owner her name was kathy the owner of it she came down with kovid and uh within literally her first week of getting coveted she was already in the hospital because she's had kidney transplants so she has underlying problems and uh within a week she was already in a coma and within two to three weeks she was in total organ failure and they were literally the doctors were already literally basically telling the family yeah you guys need to pull the plug on her you know she's not going to live you know there's no way she's going to live anymore she's in total organ failure you know everything's failed there's there's no chance of life anymore at this point so and carol was like her best friend she works for the shuttle and i remember lena and i were getting a ride home one night from carol and we get in our driveway and she just starts breaking down crying you know like breaking down and she just starts apologizing you know she's like i'm so sorry you know i'm just this has really been a lot on me and i'm like you know it's okay and like now that i thought about it you know since i had left akron i probably haven't prayed one time like i didn't pray one time the whole four years i was in arizona not once i didn't pray one time there wasn't a single time i prayed but all of a sudden like while she was crying i just felt this like overwhelming sense or need to need i needed to pray like i like like it was like a i don't know how to explain it it was like i just needed to pray like it was like pray pray right now pray right now you need to pray right now like in my head so so i looked up at carol with this boldness i was like do you believe in god and she was like yeah i was like all right well let's pray and i just prayed this crazy strong prayer for kathy i don't even remember what i said but i just know it was a strong super sincere prayer i was just praying like i haven't played prayed in four years you know like and then that was that we i said amen you know she's like thank you i needed that i was like you're welcome you know i was like it's gonna be all right and then uh i don't know how long it was maybe it was the next morning but i had a dream a crazy dream one of the most vivid dreams i've ever had in my life like it was like i was really there like it was like how if you if you're looking with your eyes it was that real like the the the world we see right now is as real as that i don't know how to describe it never had a dream that real and after i woke up i forgot that dream and what the dream was was uh it was like everything was all black and it was lit up all i saw was kathy in the hospital bed and i saw carol standing over her and it was like i was looking at them in real time i don't know how to describe it it was like real time and i was just with them and carol just looked over at me and she said austin it's all right kathy's gonna be healed she's gonna be all right and then that was the dream that was a dream and i it was like i was really there i could literally see them i could hear the monitors of the the hospital you know machines i could hear her breathing i could i could i could see it all like it was so vivid like i was literally with them then i woke up i forgot the dream though so i woke up went about my day and you know me knowing i'm about to make this move and start going to church i started watching sermons again you know on youtube you could watch all brothers yesterday's sermons all our churches sermons on youtube and i was watching it it was about joshua it was uh the sermon was about the particular one i was watching he had said something like sometimes god will use us as a vessel and speak through us it was something like that you know god will just use us to say something in a time of need or pray or something you know so he'll use us like that and as soon as he said that the dream came back to me and i remember the dream i was like oh and as soon as i remember the dream i stopped the sermon i went straight to lean all day leaning i was like you gotta listen to this i had this dream this morning that i forgot i had and i told her the dream and she was like wow okay you know i was like i was like i wonder if this is god you know what if it's god so you know the next and then i went to sleep on that the next morning you know i woke up i had to work later that day so i was or i called day and night i asked for a ride to work like usual and then um i was watching a sermon like 30 minutes prior to that and then i and then i prayed i was like all right god i was like if this is you if this if that dream was true and it was you i was like send me a sign and the way god speaks to me he always uses my surroundings i don't i don't know how to explain it i'll go into it another time but he uses my surroundings to speak to me i mean it make it but it's so obvious it's not like oh that's a coincidence i mean it's something so obvious that it's like you can't deny it and then um so i'm just asking him for a sign i'm like lord just give me a sign you know day night comes i get in the car it is carol you know carol's the driver i was like yes so we're driving you know you know i told her about the dream you know and she's like oh wow that's pretty cool you know and she didn't really you know take anything of it though she's like wow you know she was like that'd be great but she you know i mean the doctors are saying you know pull the plug there's no more chance she's she's dead she's done so you know you got that in your ear and then you got some random kids saying oh i had a dream about kathy being all right so then i remember she was talking and we were on the highway and in the middle of her talking i was like wait carol hold on hold on wait i was like i was like uh uh i was like don't talk for a second i was like i said turn up the song so she turned up the song and there was a song playing and the song was literally like it was the chorus or something i don't know but it was literally saying send me a sweet dream like it was like send me a dream like over and over it was just saying that over and over send me a sweet dream like over and over and i just got chills i'm like oh i was like carol what were we just talking about she was a dream i was like do you hear this song right now and she was like oh she started laughing she's like wow she was like that's crazy and from that moment i told her i was like carol i was like kathy's gonna be all right she's gonna come out of this and she was like i really hope so you know and then it was like three weeks later i'm talking to carol and carol was talking she's like hey uh kathy you know her organs are starting to function again and you know and then another week later hey kathy came out of a coma and she can't really talk right now but she's you know she's sewing signs of progression and then like uh two months later she was fully healed out the hospital walking and that was that and then so that i don't that was crazy you know and then carol was just shocked because she told me she was like you know when you when you prayed and when you when you told me about that dream she was like i didn't believe you she was i i didn't believe you but she was like i can't explain that she was like that's crazy that that happened i was like man and she was like you were just so confident that she was gonna be all right i was like yeah it was a god you know god gave me a dream told me she was gonna be healed so that's what happened right before i came out to akron i was like a month before i came out to akron yeah so that was crazy i've never that's never happened to me before see that dream's almost like prophetic right it foretold something that was gonna happen and that's kind of how we look at dreams as well you know we would say minor gifts of prophecy today or when god gives us dreams and then they come to pass so this looks like a minor prophecy given to our brother and then also the same time some people might even say it was a miracle because she was so close to death doctors were saying pull the plug in a coma and then yet somehow god brings her back to complete health and now she's completely well uh no doubt it's a case of divine healing as well uh some people you might say it's a it's a word of faith you know to overcome this obstacle so there's different different thoughts about it you know as far as which gifts of the holy spirit this was but you can clearly see how god foretold the healing and then that raised your faith and you shared it with others and then god brought it to pass so it's just wonderful to see god move supernaturally in your life and this this will give you guidance about you know what god may want to do with you in the future or it may have been a one-time thing a one-time gift of the holy spirit but clearly you can see god used it as a great encouragement to you while you were even in a backstage condition god was using it to help encourage you as you were on your way back to finally coming back to the house of god repenting overcoming the depression overcome the guilt all those things god uses as a huge encouragement to let you know he was still with you that's exactly what happened at that point i was like oh yeah there's no denial i was like yeah i'm ready to come back you know at that point i was like yeah it's never happened to me before i never had anything like that happening it was so uh it was crazy man it felt really good to know that god was still working so it was an awesome thing but it took about a year and a half for us to actually move out and then uh towards the end you know we were getting ready to go to akron you know and it just seemed like we couldn't get enough money to come and we couldn't it would never work like i was just continually broke like and every time we had enough i had to pay for something else or another bill and lena one day we were just getting ready to pack i mean this is the night before we were gonna leave and we packed up we decided to take a train because i wanted to make sure we made it to akron and i was like look i was like i'm not repented if we take a plan it could crash out of that you know just fear i'm like i want to make sure i get there and repent you know i'm not trying you know so it was like that so one night we were we were literally finally about to leave and uh we had an apartment set up here in akron by by the grace of brother jesse and god helped us out and uh this one night you know it just seemed like it wasn't gonna work you know i didn't have enough money or something and and i was just like you know what lena i was like i don't want to go let's not do this you know i was just like i'm just gonna work with matt doing construction for like a month and we'll just stack up a month's worth of money it'll be 25 an hour there and i'll just i'll just stack up real quick and but that's what i've been saying the last three months i'm like i'm just gonna stack up one more month you know i just gotta stack up but each time i said that at the end we only had like four or five hundred dollars but nothing like the same amount that i started with you know because it was just i was so financially suppressed i had a lot of debt so she's just like you know what nah she's let's just go with what we have you know she's like let's just go who cares and mind you i didn't i felt pressured because i didn't want to i promised her i wouldn't bring her to akron unless we i knew for sure we were going to be good so i didn't want to bring her out here just a struggle because you know i knew the truth about everybody in the church and the love and she would feel but she didn't know it i wanted to make sure she was comfortable and felt good so i felt burdened to be like okay we got to me i make i got to make sure i'm financially stable we have enough to get a car when we got out there we got to make sure we don't struggle i don't want to bring her to a place where she's going to be more miserable than here but she was just like no let's just go with what we have so we literally we took a lift to needles california was like an hour away we got dropped off and we literally had to wait all night at this super sketchy train station in the middle of this tiny weird town in the middle of nowhere in california weird train station i mean it's so dangerous it was weird it was such a weird vibe we had to wait like what five six seven hours or something like that five hours for the train to come middle of the night like all the way to midnight one am two am and the train finally comes we get on the train you know and then boom it was like a three three four day ride on that train eating nothing but like snack food you know and drinking bottles of water and uncomfortable just sitting in a chair the whole time trying to sleep in tears we slept terribly ate terribly but we finally got home and we end up in cleveland you know and and then brother jesse comes pulling up and it was like man it's like you know finally back you know so we got back and that was this december 20 2021 december and we got back and brother jesse just gets out the car and it was like you know i was like i never left i was like what's up brother you know we just we met again introduced him to lena you know and i think lena already felt the vibe he hit me in the head with the trunk you know we were closing the that was crazy but you know so you know that was probably for leaving for so long so you know that's all right and then uh yeah i didn't text them or nothing so as you're telling your story especially regarding lena like you can see how she was ordained as a child of god so for example her whole life she grows up she knows something about god you know some of her siblings are spiritual and things like that but the very first time she hears the message from you maybe an hour long sermon you preach to her maybe we'd say right or whatever it was she's like okay let's do it like there was nothing in here to disagree with the word of god that you were sharing and then you know build it up to when you're about ready to leave arizona who's the one that really is the motivating force to go it's her and it reminds me a lot of you know rebecca how rebecca was willing to leave her family you know to go get married uh to isaac she left everything you know and and she didn't say give me some more time with my family she said i'm ready to go and so i just see that faith in sister lena you know that that whole time even though you didn't even she never knew about the message you know and but that whole time there there was a seed of god laying in her soul right and then as soon as you speak the word of god to her share it she receives it and then she has this desire to go out to this church where they believe the word and they want to be a family and they want to be a real example of christianity and there she's the she's one of the driving forces behind that i just thought i'd put that in there we get all settled in at home he gives us a love offering you know just a little bit of financial gain the trials start literally on day like two is crazy we got a weird apartment but you know everybody started getting covered kobe was so bad out here and i was i was trying to look for jobs you know and i wasn't having any luck and i finally got a lead i got hired i just had to give him my background check and and i was literally banking on this job because i i'm at this point i just started running out of finances and our first month payment of rent was going to be coming up soon you know and i was like if i didn't get this job and have my first check i'm not going to be able to pay rent so i was banking everything on this job so you know and i already got hired though you know i was like okay my first rent my first check will be in like two weeks for my higher date you know and i'll have enough for rent that'll line up perfectly and my background check comes back and and they call me back and say uh actually we can't hire we don't want to hire you anymore and i was wondering why and they mentioned the felony you know i gave them all the papers all the proof and they still said no you know i was like i was destroyed i'm like man that just killed me i'm like i don't know what i'm gonna do now like i was like there's no way we're gonna pay rent like i was kind of freaking out plus i had all my other bills my loan payment all this you know so and at this time you know this was like a month in literally just a month in and i was already struggling with like if god you know really cares about me still or if you know i'm too far if i was too far gone because i didn't really feel god i mean as soon as i came back though and i went to our first church service which was the first one in four or five years my depression and anxiety instantly went away though i'll do i will say that no more depression it's been gone ever since like i haven't felt anxious or depressed since i came back like it's amazing so that was great got cured instantly of that and it was like like i was reborn again man and you know i'll never forget that first sermon when you were back brother almost the whole church was sick with covid so i think we had three people here other than me austin lena and stephen almost everybody was sick with covet or something i preached on joshua in the cities of refuge and you know just if you're in trouble run to christ if you're in trouble run to jesus jesus is our city of refuge and you just came up for prayer and maybe you can just tell a little bit about this but as as we prayed you know we were both weeping and crying it was such a special moment to see you back in the house of god almost surreal oh wow this is really happening you know i told you i was so proud of you for crossing the country you know in an act of faith to step out on the word of god and then you know you can tell about how you felt the presence of god in you and then later that week you can share how you notice a difference in your life yeah so yeah that first sermon definitely uh yeah that was a great it was a great thing it felt so good to be back i was like man this is so unreal so like i was i went up for prayer you know and i was dealing with a lot of anger you know i had a lot of anger built up man i just i was like an angry person i would lash out i still battle sometimes sometimes that spirit wants to come back but it never i always catch it now like it's nothing it's not like the same how it used to be like i used to be an angry angry individual that would just scream and lash out and then i couldn't control once i was at that point it couldn't be controlling nobody could say anything to me like i would not calm down it was just i had to ride it out you know so it was so bad my mom and i were getting bad arguments all the time and i still had a lot of deep feelings about my childhood so my mom and i would still be in arguments when i got back but uh that sermon but i remember as i was being prayed for i just felt like this insane heat like i mean like this completely crazy warrant like heat build up on my back and all through my body and it was like super super hot and it felt like a hand was on my back almost just hot like a heating pad like if you've ever sat on a heating pad like it felt like a heating pad literally and it was just like super crazy like it was just all on my back all on my body and i was just like man what is this heat you know and i just kind of you know i was like okay that must have been god you know i'm just that uh you know it's god but then uh when i want to prepare it was right after a really bad argument with my mom too it was a really bad one and then after that day i noticed anytime my mom and i would go at it i just didn't get to that complete furious anger anymore it was just like it was controlled at this point i would just uh i don't know it was weird it was just i was different for like it was it was a change in me like i don't get to that insane anger anymore like i get mad like a normal person i get angry and sometimes i have my little moments but i can catch it now and i just put it under subjection i've never been able to do that in my whole life but i just i don't know it just like changed ever since that day i don't have that anymore it's just gone and it doesn't build up and also ever since that day i've just completely forgotten about all my ill feelings if anybody that's ever did me wrong i just i don't feel it no more it's like it used to hold me and now i just don't feel them like i could care less of what happened in my childhood i'm at peace with it now i used to think about my childhood and get sad but now i'm at peace with everything and that it doesn't bother me anymore it is what it is you know like built me who i am so yeah it's been a change since that day i just i'm past it now you know i don't it's not i'm not imprisoned by that or a slave to that anymore it's just that anger's gone and that that pain and sorrow that's all gone anybody that's ever done me wrong you know it's like hey i still love you i don't care anymore i'm not mad angry sad i could care less you know i don't i don't even remember like we don't even got to talk about it i'll just pretend you didn't even do it you know like it doesn't matter to me anymore like it just matters that we're here now and i'm growing from that so it's like amazing that god gave me a second chance you know so that's all i got to say about that it was supernatural day god i think took that from me and that was him just vindicating and showing me that you know he's there and that was the change whatever that heat was it took it with it because i've been like i still get angry i still get uppity a little bit every now and then but it's nothing like it used to be like i can control it now and you know now it's just like a battle i can fight it's way different i used to get like that with everything you know he's like it just doesn't happen anymore i don't know so that's a good example of how the holy spirit comes on people like a holy fire so our brother said he felt like a heat the prince of god god is called a consuming fire and when the holy ghost comes upon someone to anoint them or deliver them sometimes people will feel that and so that this presence of god came on you in such a great way that it actually delivered you from anger or just like extreme anger wrath or bitterness so you got delivered that day just for coming up for a simple prayer the holy ghost anointed you that day and gave you deliverance which is a beautiful testimony by god's grace but you want to share when you got the holy ghost how you felt like it was warmth on the back i thought that might be kind of good to tie in remember when simon prayed for you maybe you could share how that kind of connects um when i got the holy ghost it was a little bit similar feeling when brother simon put his hand on my back and i was just praying not thinking of anything but of god and i felt this huge warmth like a hand that was like three times bigger than mine upon my back and that's when i got the holy ghost right there it was like a warm feeling like how you were describing it very similar but you could just feel the presence of god so strong on you yeah i just saw a connection there between when you got delivered of maybe the anger issue and then when he got the holy ghost and then that's when when my dad prayed for my mom for divine healing uh or the miraculous healing rather of the cancer he said he felt a warm sensation of the holy spirit so i've heard different people say sometimes they feel a cooling sensation some people warm sensation but the fact is when god moves many times he does manifest some type of a feeling or sensation so i just thought i'd share that that's a nice connection there so uh and i was really struggling already a month in satan's battling me i'm like man just got this god still caring about me did i go too far or something you know i didn't really feel his presence like i used to i felt guilty still and that and then i didn't get the job so i'm like man i was just discouraged and i'm like i don't even think god cares about me anymore you know and then on this one wednesday night you know it was crazy you know we're talking about uh the apostle john and how he calls him except the one whom god loves and i really like that uh service too because i'm like man i was really dealing with that i'm like man this is weird i need this service is like weird because i was literally just battling with this and then uh brother jesse at the end you know he looks at me and he says austin the god loves you and then uh he starts explaining that uh this this guy from england random guy that none of us knew uh sent a love offering and said that the holy ghost told him that there's a couple in brother jesse's church that needs financial help and uh he's put on the screen in our church and said that he sent 12 998 dollars to uh get us out of debt and to help us out financially and i just and and it was exactly what i needed i mean i started breaking down i'm like because i was i was really wondering if god still cared about me or if i was like you know too far gone and then from that point on i was like okay i'm never gonna doubt you know i was like that was the most beautiful thing that's ever happened so i mean i took that and i got to pay off all my debts all my debts were paid spiritually and physically so all my debts were paid i got to pay rent i got to pay off my bank loans all the all the debts everything everything was paid and i'm still debt free from that day i decided to get re-baptized shortly after that i got re-baptized with lena we both got baptized and lena and i have just been experiencing blessing after blessing like and it's only what been almost eight months now is my life's already completely i'm a completely different person i mean so it's like the perfect cap to everything you know as i went through all that all that in arizona and it feels like i had to break down and go crazy out in action just so i can go out to arizona and meet lina and bring her back because i mean the the the fruits of her life has shown that she's really one of god's seeds you know she's one of god's children she has been nothing but a blessing here you know and it's been awesome seeing her life change so much she's just decided to completely go fully into the faith and is is completely happy here you know feels like one of the families so is is exactly how i thought it was going to play out yeah so now we're here you know and uh still battling but like i'm nothing like i used to be i mean i don't smoke anymore i stopped smoking in december stop drinking it's the first time in my life where i've been completely sober now 100 gave up cigarettes gave up everything you know so now we're just living for god and uh it's complete change i mean if god can help somebody like me and still do this for me he could help anybody to look because i was at the lowest to the lows man like i was down down down deep down in the gutter so he definitely helped me out man so i mean i'm i'm completely changed i can't believe i even came from the place i was at so it's amazing so this has been a wonderful testimony brother maybe last question uh can you tell me some of the highlights of how the message has changed your life and brought you out of darkness into light yeah definitely um well the way the message changed my life is um god took me from the deepest depths of like depression drug addiction jail you know the street life all everything bad you can think of in life and he's completely changed my mind healed me from depression took me from my past paid my debts and uh you know my license was suspended the whole time i was in arizona and now i just got my license back um i'm debt free i just started a new job at a place called mustard seed which is funny so you know faith like a mustard seed and um i've been there for about a month and uh i just got promoted to being a supervisor literally last week you know and that's they told me that i'm the least experienced supervisor they've ever hired and they usually make people wait about a year to even get this position if they work there so i mean it's a big position it's salary and i have to run a whole cafe you know god has been giving me complete blessings and grace in my life i'm on my way to buying a car and i got my happiness back i got a sense of security stability even got my relationship back with my mom so like we've been closer than we've ever been the last six years uh i got a really good good woman by my side i got all got all my church family back you know and uh i'm healthy i'm eating right you know i've gotten my health back my health is in perfect shape despite all the drugs i did and yeah it's just i got a lot of support system behind me i'm just seeing blessing after blessing now i mean it's like been great so it's it's affected me in a positive way and it's completely changed my life supernaturally and i'm really reaping the benefits of you know believing in the full bible gospel so it's really good you know it's like a new beginning it feels like and you know like i said if i can go from on death's door in the death of drug addiction to being a supervisor at a upbeat cafe with face tattoos mind you i have face tattoos tattoos all over my body and i'm in a boss position that you know there's no limit to what god can do for somebody and change them i mean it's like black and white looking at me you know so that's just some of the minor ways it's changed my life majorly though it's given me my soul and my spirit back you know and i have life in me now so that's the major thing like i hadn't where i had no will to live i now see a a good future i'm making a plan to build that future and uh yeah i see myself with a family you know and just everything that i never really cared for back in the day so yeah god god really god really works you know he really he really will bless you if you just believe in all you gotta do is believe you know that's all i that's all i did was believe i didn't really work for it he kind of i believed and everything else fell into place now now i'm actively working to improve my spiritual walk with god but it started on just faith of a mustard seed man just believing so yeah that's all i got to say about that it's just been a huge change you know i'm a completely different person than i was even six months ago let alone four years ago so this is i'm better than i've ever been in my life actually like my whole entire life i'm 25 this is the best shape i've ever been so it's really good you know it's amazing now there's not a lot of people that get a chance second chance when it comes to drug addiction really bad toxic things that should kill a person you know or just very bad so very thankful that i got a second chance and i'm using my time wisely you know and i'm here to spread the message about jesus christ and how real he really is and i feel like a lot of people just hear about jesus and they just think he's just uh that the bible is just a fantasy book here for you know just to control or maybe just for good a positive attitude but it's so much more than just being a good person like it's real life supernatural divine healings and blessings that can happen to anybody that just believes in it you know so and i'm just a perfect example of that i mean it's it's it's pretty obvious at this point that god is definitely has everything to do with what's happened to me in my life and i hope that this testimony can really affect some people positively and wherever they're at in their battles whether it be major or minor battles that they can find some blessing in this and and they can increase their faith in god because that's mainly why i'm sharing it you know so i hope this is a blessing to anybody that's listening and uh god bless you amen what a beautiful testimony the lord has given our brother austin you know i want to point out a couple things first notice that the message always stayed with brother austin from the first time he heard it back in 2016 austin could never get away from the bible truce that we taught him and of course we got them from god's prophet brother william branham he always knew the message was right for the year and a half he was with us and then for the five years he was not with us whether he was in akron or arizona he had heard the truth and he was convicted of that truth the entire time and that's the reality of the gospel the gospel and the message of jesus christ makes a permanent mark on every person's conscience we rejoice in the long-suffering of god he's rich in mercy to each one of us striving with us until we humble ourselves and repent and come into the faith a final thought is that we can clearly see the contrast of the kingdom of darkness versus the kingdom of light or the kingdom of god satan influenced austin to destroy his health but jesus christ has restored his health satan's influence caused him to have fractured relationships but jesus has restored his relationships satan influenced austin into financial debt but jesus christ supernaturally got him out of debt satan discouraged brother austin but jesus christ encouraged him this is the beauty of the gospel satan comes that he might steal kill and destroy but jesus comes that we might have life and have it more abundantly and just like brother austin each one of us can enjoy the abundant life of the lord jesus christ we finally reached the conclusion of this testimony and i hope you have been very blessed by brad austin and we have been blessed by him by his presence being here at our church and we sure love him and his girlfriend and we hope the best for them that they'll continue to serve the lord and everything and hope you guys are also blessed by listening to this podcast yeah austin and lena have been a wonderful blessing here at the church and we're so grateful for their faith god has answered so many more of their prayers and testimonies i know god will continue to do so so we're just thankful that the prodigal has come home by god's grace and also brought with him a wonderful woman of faith by god's grace so we're very grateful for that so may the lord jesus christ anoint you to defend the message god bless you okay cool cool hey god bless you god bless you guys hey um so i'm the lord gave me this song um actually last week so i wanted to sing it in hopes that it's a blessing um i've never done it yesterday was my first song special so i'm just doing this for the lord the bible says to share our gifts with the congregation to bless others that it's not our own so i'm getting past my nervousness and i'm sharing it with you guys um and this is a song about my testimony so it's a little different than yesterday so i hope it's a blessing thank you i was [Music] [Applause] was
