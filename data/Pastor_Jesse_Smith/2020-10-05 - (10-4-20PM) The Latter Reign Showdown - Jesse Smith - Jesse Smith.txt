book of james here tonight i'd like to look at the latter rain and the showdown a little bit tonight i've preached a few things in the past about it i'd like to go a little deeper here tonight about god's grace book of james chapter 5 verse 7 james 5 verse 7. what a blessing to be a christian in this hour what a blessing uh the world through the lens of the word we have an eternal perspective we have a holy perspective and it's the greatest blessing that we have is to know jesus christ and see the world events world history everything through the lens of god's word praise god so james 5 7. it's uh just so beautiful that uh the new testament also validates that the latter rain is what we are waiting for we know the old testament says it brother ram tells us it would thus say the lord in the church age book but it's beautiful to see it go genesis to revelation it didn't have to go in the new testament but god inspired james to write it down for us so we're grateful for that james 5 7 through 9. if we look at this scripture we'll see also that the main thing church in this hour is just divine love right because that's the baptism of the holy ghost yes it's the way people know you're a disciple of christ right brother man said you got to have divine love thus saith the lord to make it to the other side so everything all boils down to that there's so many wonderful things we can preach in the message because the mysteries are open we still have some questions but as far as doctrinally everything doctrinally laid out we got questions about the future but it all really boils down to this do we have the love of jesus christ in our hearts and if we do we are the true disciples of jesus christ james 5 7 through 9. let's read uh seven together why we read seven and eight together and i'll read verse nine myself so let's read seven and eight together let's begin on three one two three be patient therefore brethren unto the coming of the lord behold the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth and hath long patience for it until he received the early and latter rain be ye also patient establish your hearts for the coming of the lord draw nine now i'll read verse eight or verse nine myself grudge not so see how he gets in divine love he's talking about the latter rain the last rain before the harvest he said but don't grudge amongst yourselves grudge not one against another brethren lest ye be condemned look at that behold the judge standeth before the door let's have a word of prayer if you have any on your heart let's make it known to god and let's ask for god to give us more of his divine love and let us surrender to his divine love heavenly father we raise our hands of the lord and we bow our heads father some of us and father we just express ourselves to you bless this reading of your word anoint me god i just pray lord in jesus name father that you'll speak through me help me lord god guide me i've prepared i've done all i know how to do uh lord just use me for your glory in jesus christ's name and the saint said amen god bless you as being seated praise god i'd like to start uh just by reviewing what i preached on the three showdowns back in 2016 karen probably remember aaron probably remembers rather i remember preaching over there in the other sanctuary so if you can switch over acacia i'm gonna go quickly through it i promise questions say promise but yeah my word i'm going to go quickly through it i'm not going to take up too much time because i want to get to the latter rain part of this okay so i just want to review it uh just to kind of give us something to start with as far as a rehearsal or a review of uh of the truth of god and let me open up these files okay these messages all right so um that's actually mount zion right there so that's mount zion i know don't look very tall as far as to us but that is mount zion that's the highest mountain there in jerusalem and uh we know there's three showdowns right uh i was listening that again last night um i'm just gonna go quickly brother braham was told uh he said here's where the spirit said pick up the pen and this is in 62. so he's preaching this in march of 62 about the spoken word original seed and he begins writing but brother man says i never wrote it he did and it is quite a beautiful eloquent section it's in the church age book as well but if you listen to the end it's a six hour sermon uh the spoken word original seed if you listen to the last hour of it he reads what the holy spirit told him to write okay this is where we get the idea of the three showdowns it's where we get some words about the latter rain we even get words where brother branham says the messenger will sow for the latter rain so that's quite a statement that last seven church age messenger will plant seeds for the latter rain to bring forth because as you saw in genesis there was three messengers that came down to abraham's seed before sodom was destroyed so brother graham says brother brown basically says his ministry was god's ministry right which we believe that how many believe that that was god's ministry god himself was with brother branham but then there was two other seeds right or two other messengers that went down to sodom the man said that was a modern billy graham modern oral roberts okay and brother ram said the gospel blinded the the uh the sodomites right you know uh billy graham believed uh that was wrong sodomite was wrong billy graham believed that he didn't preach about it but uh too much from what i recall from what i've heard from him same thing with oral roberts uh but they they they weren't they didn't stay or they went down to the world right they went down to the foolish virgin but god stayed with abraham seed and he discerned abraham's seed right abra or sarah right abraham's wife sarah he discerned her with that discernment gift right and so those are all ideas we get from the pick up the pen section it's a big long section it's beautiful brother branham said it's it's about what the spirit uh and the word is going to do in the bride it's about the word and the bride and how they are one okay so i was just out uh there's just too much here i told i told you i gotta go quick he basically parallels ahab and uh elijah to our day okay and i'll just read this uh then in the latter rain will come a mount carmel showdown watch this carefully now to see it in the word now he gives the word the second forerunner of christ will sow for the latter reigns these are some of those ideas in there right some of those uh scriptures in there uh jesus will be the showdown between the denominations and creeds where he will come to back up his word aren't you glad amen and take his bride in the rapture jesus is always going to back up his word praise god now i i had this you probably remember this there's three uh showdowns carmel transfiguration zion it's a physical mountain physical mountain this has to be a spiritual mountain but church this will be a physical mountain for the 144 thousand how many know that that's in revelation 14. they actually received christ on the physical mount zion praise god but we are a type of that we're a type of that okay because mount zion is the highest elevation in jerusalem so we have our messengers john the baptist william branham um yeah elijah i'm sorry yeah we have four runners and we have four runners with uh these two uh mount transfigure i'm sorry these two showdowns so it's really deep uh you know the both of them rebuke organizations it's a showdown with denominations or baal spirits uh ours is showdown against the denominations and creeds praise god okay so just quickly going through that um he said be ready for the mount zion showdown i'm not gonna like i said i'm not gonna go through all this just kind of bring a little bit to uh memory and i just wanted to show uh you know again mount zion so mount moriah was where christ was crucified and then mount zion of course is the highest mountain here's a modern-day picture there's a dome of the rock so mount zion is actually the tallest uh mountain there temple mount you know that's where solomon's temple was and so this is this is literally so if i i told you this before if i was a jew i'd be hanging out right there because jesus is going to come back and meet the 144 000 on mount zion uh but for us it's spiritual praise god spiritual okay so uh now here's here's where the rapture is typed as mount zion psalm 24 who shall ascend into the hill of the lord who shall stand in this holy place he that have clean hands and a pure heart praise god who hath not lifted up his soul into vanity right you hear all the people cheering over there isn't that funny they're cheering for the browns we're cheering for jesus in here shouting praising hallelujah thank you lord clap in and ours is not in vain theirs is in vain but ours is sincere praise god ours is eternal praise the lord who hath not lifted up his soul and of any nor sworn deceitfully see that christian keeps their word he should receive the blessing from the lord and the righteousness from the god of his salvation this is the generation of them that seek him that seek thy face o god i'm saying o jacob say lie praise god this is where we get it the hill of the lord all right and then the bible conditions uh there may be a minor persecution brother branham calls it physically bereft in the church age book uh the ecumenical move will end with rome at the head even though the people did not vision that way like it doesn't look like that way right now that is so because revelation 17 3 through 6 it states that the mystery babylon is seated on the beast she's seated on the beast okay uh here's where brother said the church systems will persecute the true bride the image will try to keep the bride from preaching and teaching and that's why i said jeffersonville's on the wrong way because they're trying to shut down preachers now they're going the wrong way uh and he says her ministers will be forbidden to give comfort and truth to the people who need it but before the antichrist in person takes over the true church will be taken away from this world to be with the lord god will catch away his bride from the for the marriage supper of the lamb okay so brother bam says when and pick up your pen the boycott is scriptural this is what i was talking this morning brother amen he said uh do you believe this has been six hours or six hours i've never i've never felt led to do that but brother brand did and good thing he did there's much more could be said but surely the holy spirit by this time has sunk it deep in you that you know what i'm talking about we're at the end time the seeds are so down now the latter rain is fixing to come forth he didn't say it already was he said it's fixing right remember there'll be such a denominational gathering pretty soon it'll be terrific now not good terrific it'll just be it'll be bad right but he's saying it'll be terrific they will bring themselves together in this federation of churches and then this kind of a church will be put out of operation as far as they know but we'll keep going on praise god amen because it doesn't matter wherever we're two or three are gathered that's where the church is praise god it's at that time jesus will appear that's what brother man thought okay that when we are scattered all about or whatever we're not allowed to gather here jesus will come at that time a church if that's scriptural then brother amen that would have to happen before the rapture so our churches would have to get shut down i'm not saying it is but it sure looks like it right because i don't have a thus saith the lord on this particular statement but then it looks like it because he said pick up the pen and write and probably said that wasn't me so it looks like a prophecy so that's we just do the best we can he said remember christian friends i'm a man i can make mistakes but god being god cannot make a mistake all the words has been written must be fulfilled jesus said so we've got things here in the scripture that must be fulfilled and that is one of the things this boycott to come they'll boycott our churches i believe someday the real bride of christ will be forced to stop preaching the word of god the bible prophesies it in revelation 13 16 if you want to put it down okay that's where they start laying down the mark okay so there's the boycott scriptures are familiar with those that's the uh they're laying out their mark and then that's because you kept the word of my patience i'll keep you from the hour temptation that will come upon the earth that was the philadelphian church age okay now real quick again um let me see anything really important else in there yeah brother man talks about the tears must be gathered first we'll look at that again like i said i want to spend too much time on this one she's yeah she's cut from the hour temptation that comes upon the whole world uh i just want to go this kind of fast here so baby even says it's not a declaration that the true church will go through and into the tribulation okay uh the temptation right before the rapture will be very inviting uh but it'll be in direct opposition to god's commanded word yet from the standpoint of human reasoning it will be so very right so enlightening and life-giving as to fool the world he said it comes as follows politically they change the laws with pressure and enacting the loss that no people will be recognized as actual churches unless under direct or indirect domination of the council so little groups will lose their charters all their property spiritual rights with the people all right and the pressure as it increases it'll be harder to resist for the resistance to lose privilege but we they we can never go along with the the laws of the land then it becomes the mark of the beast as they gather together and then they call in the money system and that's when the the church or that's when the nation surrenders to rome because rome has all the gold i guess rome had rome has all the the catholics that control this world and they got all the art and everything they got it all the man says we need sanctification for the third poll uh yep he says we're coming to this third poll and we need to be sanctified so yeah i'm just skipping that real quick yeah he says the third poll means a lot of shaving down for me for you but together we'll make it by the grace of god okay so walk in the spirit you won't fulfill the lust of the flesh yeah here's the rapture harvest matthew 13 brother says binding time now so they're being bound together now the ecumenical churches harvest reign or rapturing faith uh so here's where it's thus saith the lord the prophet messenger who was sent to teach the people and turn the hearts of the children back to the pentacles pentecostal fathers had not yet come to azusa street so here it is the latter rather rain is harvest rain and let me get to the thor okay so twice for the lamb says thus saith lord so to me there's no question in the bride will be the fullness of pentecost for the spirit will bring the people right back to the where where they were at the beginning that's thus saith the lord because of joel 2 23 uh and then next will come the harvest rain or rapturing faith so the latter rain is clearly rapturing faith can anybody say amen to that all right so let me uh let me just stop right there and i'm going to start teaching on the latter rain now so this will all be new so the former rain i believe is william branham's teaching that's what i believe because that word former means teaching so there had to come a teaching reign first and then the latter reign where the brahm tells us is rapturing faith so it makes sense that people gotta have the blessing of the teaching in order to raise their faith amen praise god amen now a few months ago over the summer i wrote uh i wrote my best understanding of the former latter reign and it goes with uh the feast of weeks how many remember the feast of weeks from the jewish feasts there are seven feasts right you had uh i have to i might have to read them off here because i don't have them all fresh on my mind here passover was the first feast unleavened bread the second first fruits the third and those type jesus death burial resurrection and then the feast of weeks that's the fourth feast that's what we're in right now okay now after the rapture goes the trumpets right and that's actually the season where right now of israel actually lit in their literal uh spiritual year right now they're trumpets atonement i think they're in tabernacles now so the in god's calendar the trumpets don't take place until after the gentile rapture after the gentile rapture the two prophets starts trumpeting gather the 144 000 together amen and then the day of atonement is when those 144 thousand meet jesus and the bible said they go from house to house so sorry they crucified their own messiah but the bible said a nation will be born in one day praise god they'll be born again the holy ghost they'll be forgiven all everything will be atoned and israel be restored praise god by the baptism of the holy ghost and then that leads into the tabernacles which is the millennium praise god so we know that's the prophetic calendar brother ram taught that plainly okay now let's go real slow here with this ladder rain give me uh give me about 30 minutes here i'll try to read through this here we'll be teaching us have your bible handy we got numerous scriptures here okay so the former and latter rain before the harvest now this was a great study i learned a lot so bear with me this is the deepest i've ever gone on the former ladder rain okay so reaping the wheat harvest was the main task of the feast of weeks okay so israel i think barley was first because that was time ruth came back uh the last the last harvest was wheat amen i'm glad to be a wheat seed of god amen the wheat plant of god just as jesus's great commission emphasizes saving souls in the field of the world's nations right that's what jesus said in mark 16 and matthew 24 and 28 talked about go into all the world go into all the field and preach the gospel and harvest souls for my kingdom praise god but no harvest is possible in the natural church without the former and latter rain you've got to have both okay you can't have a harvest unless you have those rains okay so let's deal with let's first deal with rain's spiritual meaning and we'll look up former and latter reign okay i got some readers there back there lydia malachi can you read from me got a bible there sorry lydia can you get hosea 6 1-3 malachi can you get joel 2 28. so these two scriptures we're going to read hosea 6 and then joel 2 are evidences here that on the day of pentecost peter declares the falling of the holy spirit fulfilled joel's prophecy okay so uh joel 2 28 is what peter quotes so malachi when you got joel 228 can you read that afterward that buddy will pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughter shall prophesize your own shall be in jesus name okay so peter quotes that on the day of pentecost pouring out so it's pouring out it's a symbolism of rain okay now hosea 6 1-3 is another evidence that his spirit is symbolized as rain so lydia can you read hosea 6 1-3 amen praise god that's speaking of israel right yeah and he says notice you have three days to get together all the way justification sanctification baptism with the holy ghost he said we'll do two days then he comes on the third day if we want to return to the book of acts we got to be justified sanctified and filled with the holy ghost amen praise god so see spirit represents rain is going forth is as the morning he shall come unto us as how does god come as the rain praise god the refreshing of the rain hallelujah now look there's two rains necessary for the harvest former ladder the purpose of the former were to water the seeds at the beginning of the autumn growing season so in israel's time right now is the time to plant to harvest it next summer because their weather is more mild okay so the former rain was arraigned in the autumn and let me just uh state that here so the former rain was the first rain to give the seed life the latter rain was the last rain to bring it to maturity praise god israel had a sacred year and a civil year as you know the sacred year was from march or april depending on the year to september or october so they're finishing their sacred year now their civil year was from october or november to february march okay so they're finishing up their their sacred year right now with tabernacles but then they're going to get into their civil year okay so the former reigns fell around november and its latter rains fell in the first month of the sacred year around march or april and we'll get to the scriptures on these in just a little bit so church logically the latter rain has to fall shortly before the first month just in time for israel to harvest the barley first fruits to be waived by the priests on the feast of first fruits okay so you have barley and you have wheat barley gets harvested right there in march or april now the wheat though was later on in the summer but both of them got the latter rain there right at the beginning of march right at the end of february okay so it's it's a little bit to digest there so we must apply the former latter reign to the times of the gentiles or from 30 a.d to the present so we are in the spiritual feast of weeks this long harvest season before god returns to the jews at the feast of the trumpets okay so peter was clear that the rain was coming on all flesh remember say all flesh all flesh now that represents gentiles so on the day of pentecost he said he said i'm quoting joel 2 pour out the spirit on all flesh is it fulfilled yes yeah you see uh asians get the can you have the holy ghost on them uh you can have europeans north americans everybody the holy spirit can fall on anybody praise god all flesh and so forth throughout the 2000 years of the church ages the rain has been falling holy ghost rain showers have fallen on every age and its leaders from john the divine to arrhenius to colombo to luther to wesley to wigglesworth and now to brother branham praise god but jesus and other uh prophets foretold end time conditions in the church ages before the final harvest and alt and it would ultimately mirror a spiritual famine due to disobedience so now let's bring in this idea of famine right so we need former ladder rain but there's an idea of famine before the rain okay so this is a thought we have to see here jesus said nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth so that looks like famine right there's not much faith paul calls it a falling away from the faith right and he says this is a time of seducing teachers who grow increasingly more deceptive let's read amos 11 and 12 8 11 and 12. i'll read it amos 8 11 and 12. behold the days come saith the lord that i will send a famine in the land not a famine of bread nor a thirst for water but of the hearing of the words of the lord and they shall wander from sea to sea and from the north even to the east they shall run to and fro to seek the word of lord and shall not find it praise god so can we see it church this is a spiritual famine time right the former rain fell right but now we're waiting for the latter rain to fall i say like this i still think the former rain's falling myself because i think it goes to every generation because i could be wrong but you know the the generation that liver and brother branham they're all dying out right we got a new generation people that didn't know brother they never met him but yet we met jesus praise god that's the most important one to me praise god jesus so see all those scriptures from paul and jesus they paint this picture of a famine time and we need rain amen we need rain jesus describes the final wheat harvest in matthew 13 24. so let's go there matthew 13 24 through 30. this is a beautiful type of it 13 34. i'm sorry 13 24. my phone ether 13 24 through 30. well for time's sake let's go to 36 because most of us know this parable pretty familiar matthew 13 36-43 then jesus sent the multitude away and went into the house and his disciples came unto him saying declare unto us the parable the terrorists of the field he answered and said unto them he that soweth the good seed is the son of man the field is the world the good seed are the children of the kingdom but the tares are the children of the wicked one the enemy that sowed them is the devil the harvest is the end of the world and the reapers are the angels we looked at angels last week right as therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire so shall it be in the end of this world the son of man shall send forth his angels and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend and them which do iniquity and shall cast them into a furnace of fire there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their father who hath ears to hear let him hear specifically the end time is called a wheat harvest amen but there's a lot of tares growing up praise god so christians are labeled wheat right and that matches israel's feast of weeks because they were going to harvest wheat and they're gathered into christ's barn praise god the tares are gathered and burned up now jesus final harvest is required before the wrath and judgment of the great tribulation because the former latter reigns are necessary to bring the wheat to maturity and we read john i'm sorry james 5 7 to 8 to support this this gives the promise of one more former and latter rain before the last gentile harvest did you catch that he says he hath long patience for it so he waited what two thousand years until you receive the early and the latter rain be also patient establish your hearts from the coming of the lord drawth night so we are told church we need patience in this hour and we need hearts that are established in other words unmovable right this thing's pretty movable i don't want to break any wires that bang or amen set up but this is pretty movable right but the bible said let your heart be unmovable praise god if we are going to receive the latter rain our hearts must be unmovable nothing can shake us i'm built on christ the solid rock and i stand on the solid rock of christ now the holy spirit gives more inspiration from joel 2 23-26 as we read uh we've read it numerous times now the word former i'm just going to look off joel 2 28 i'm sorry joel 2 23-26 uh be then glad you children of zion and rejoice in the lord your god for hath given you the former rain moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month okay so the word former means teacher that's what it actually means teacher so a teacher reign praise god a teacher reign so christians must expect a great teaching anointing to come in preparation for the rapture harvest let me share let me i'll show you where brother ma'am said that so i'm getting back to this quote i mentioned this morning about put the word first brother ram said jesus warned us of such things coming he said in matthew 24 there'll be two spirits very close they'll deceive the very elected if they were possible but man said how can you tell them so how can we tell the false the tares from the wheat brotherhood says give them the word test how can you know it speak the word see what they say about it if they don't believe the word they have no seed germ in them they are of the evil one and deceive you as the first bride was deceived he's speaking of eve the second bride was the seed now he's speaking of uh those make believers after pentecost because you can't deceive the jew brad right uh he says they are deceivers of the third bride he said it's all at the end end time right by hydrating the word or trying to god never placed signs ahead of his word he said amen that's a scorcher anybody feel scorched out there i hope not you've probably heard this before so it doesn't scorch you so this is for people that say we gotta you know uh we gotta have the greatest miracles if we don't have the miracles we're not the bride well brother that's a scorcher he said god never places signs and miracles above his word the word comes first he said he said god never placed signs ahead of his word they were added for the proof of the word but the word is first so see that's why the teaching reign has to come first it has to prove it now look what happened church look what can i say like this look what happened to azusa they had the signs and miracles first and then they got off the word see they should have the word first there's tongues or no evidence but but god can restore the gifts so he said god always places the word first he said to prove it elijah said to the woman bring me a cake first then watch the miracle happen he said come to the word first and then watch the miracle the seed word itself is what the holy spirit energizes amen amen so see the word's got to come first the true word the true teaching and then the water comes to anoint that praise god and gives it energizes that seed word he said how can a messenger sent from god just believe some of the scriptures and not all the word how can he deny part of it the true prophet of god will proclaim the word in the last days denominations will hate him yeah they sure do but we love him he will not pull any punches on them he'll be like it was when he come at the first coming of christ you generation of vipers but the predestinator will hear and will make ready for the countdown the royal seat of abraham's faith like him holding to the word of god regardless for he was predestinated okay so i want to give you the idea how the teaching has to come first the teaching must come first okay now with that laid down um after the former reign then god sends a latter rain anointing or we call it rapturing faith because the church recognizes the conditions the times and seasons of the rapture a church she'll begin seeking god for the latter reign through prayer according to zechariah 10 1. so if you've got your bibles we're already matthew let's just flip a few pages zechariah 10 1. now remember church god moved israel to cry out for the first exodus and then in the upper room they cried out for the second exodus amen do you think we're going to get out of crying out to god for the third exodus i don't think so i think it's going to be our prayers that bring it down praise god because we have to get in obedience with what the prophecy says we've got to want it we've got to want the rain and that's what this scripture says right here you have to want we have to want the rain look at this man it's beautiful ascii of the lord reign in the time of the latter rain so see if we have to recognize it's time for the rapture praise god i see the spirit will get us there amen yeah like i said we've guessed people we people around us have guests for years and years and years well one of these times is going to be right there'll be no guessing because the spirit will guide us to ask at the right time just like at pentecost so the lord shall make bright clouds and give them showers of rain to everyone grass in the field so see look at this the bible clearly teaches that when we when we recognize it's time for the latter rain we've got to cry out for and then we see the effects of it praise god you see the grass grow up and then you can harvest praise god so it's a great uh it's a great lesson it's a lot of great scriptures in here now that's i'm getting towards the end of this teaching here now as far as in the the book lord willing jesus will send his spirit in the same measure as the day of pentecost producing the same results the divine reign will restore back to the final church everything the early church possessed remember what joel said we need the wheat which is the word we need the wine which is joy and we need the oil the baptism of the holy ghost amen how many how many believe we need that in our messenger churches amen absolutely we need the word joy and the actual feeling of the holy spirit praise god we need all that and that's what joel 2 23-26 it promises we'll rejoice and be glad and we won't be ashamed of this gospel praise god amen thank the lord before the rapture harvest christ church will have the same power same truth same miracles and faith of the apostolic saints jesus promises to bring the last church right back to where she started at pentecost in acts chapter 2. this is true because joel 2 23 says the latter rain is it in the first month now this always stumbled me till i studied this this summer did you ever notice that the bible said the early and that rain come in the first month well if you look in hebrew this means formerly so in the former or the at first month so in other words shortly before the rapture the latter rain falls on the gentiles as it did formally at first on the day of pentecost so to me that's what that means uh some people say well see the holy ghost the rapture has to be in march or april i don't believe that because the first month of uh the feast of weeks was march or april it just was okay but me i believe it's prophetic i believe it's a spiritual the first month when we receive it i believe will be the first condition of the apostolic church the book of acts who knows when the rapture be nobody knows nobody knows uh but it might be in the spring it might be right god works according to calendars right it might be we don't know it may be but it may be in the fall too right and maybe right before israel starts to feast the trumpets it may be that if god wants to do that it's up to god but we got to be ready how many want to be ready praise god all right go to matthew 24 i got a few more things i want to lay down there now that was as deep as i've ever gone into it so i hope that was a help by god's grace naturally the former rain was in november uh to water the seed and give it life and then the latter rain was in march or april okay but there was rain that rain fell on uh the barley and the wheat so the barley would have typed the jews right and then the wheat would have been the gentiles praise god okay so matthew 24. i'd have some more notes i want to look over here okay matthew 24. i want to read the scripture about the field there'll be some in the field and some uh yeah okay now let's go down to uh 37 matthew 24 37 but as the days of noah were remember they all laughed at noah that's what they're doing laughing today about the rapture so shall also the coming of the son of man be remember they're all uh interested in uh immorally dressed women right they're all interested in marrying outside the faith uh violence eating drinking giving you marriage totally fits today for as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking marrying given in marriage until the day that noah entered into the ark and knew not until the flood came and took them all away so shall also the coming of the son of man be here it is this one look at this for a moment then shall two be in the field the one shall be taken and the other left okay two women shall be grinding at the mill the one shall be taken the other left watch therefore for ye know not what our your lord doth come praise god uh yeah let me actually go a little bit further verse 43 but know this that if the good man of the house had known and what watch the thief would have come he would have watched and would not have suffered his house to be broken up therefore be also ready for in such hour as you think not the son of man cometh who then is a faithful you know we need church we need faithfulness today he said who is that faithful and wise servant whom his lord hath made ruler over his household to give them their meat in due season blessed is that servant whom his lord when he cometh shall find doing so verily i send you that he shall make him ruler over all of his goods but and if that evil servant shall say in his heart my lord delayeth is coming and shall begin to smite his fellow servants and to eat and drink with the drunken the lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him and an hour that he's not aware of and shall cut him asunder and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites there shall be weeping and gnashing of cheese look at that church we'll be in one of two groups right either we'll be getting the meat for our season or we'll be getting beat up by preachers and i don't want to beat anybody up i want to i want to want to change i want i want the word of god to chasten us correct us but i don't want to beat us up praise god i want to i want to see people leaving here with a full spiritual stomach praise god that they got the meat of god's word amen and i believe that i'm giving everybody the best i got by god's grace that's the best understanding i have of the former and latter rain that the teaching rain has to come first and then the latter rain comes at the end to quicken that right to quicken that seed that's been planted by the messenger now i want to just note there too in verse 40. we're familiar with this but notice the rapture comes when people are just working out in the field in other words going to work praise god so in other words church we've got to be ready for the rapture before we go to work right we got you got to be ready before you head out to the field i think about that wow one of these days you may go to work and that's the last day you're going to work praise god amen it's the last day you have to go to the grinder last day i got to go to the classroom there may come a day right because they go out to the field but one of them is ready one of them is not ready in other words one of them received that ladder rain my look think about that they're walking and the brotherhood said you know we'll see our loved ones for a month can you imagine that we might have to go to work praise god but we've seen jesus receiving jesus people praise god think about that we'll be we'll be going to work and so you know the christians here this tells us we don't quit work when we see the coming of the lord we say faithful at work praise god we're faithful in the natural and we're faithful in the spiritual because they go out to the field to work and look now look at this church and with these we see this too this idea where you know the person who's born again filled with the holy ghost they can't convince their co-worker to go with them right there'll be people that and you can be think about that you can be born again filled with the holy ghost have rapturing faith in your soul but it won't be enough to take away the foolish version as well so let me say like this we'll be so we'll be so salty praise god can you imagine if we see our loved ones raised again how salty we would be but yet it won't be enough for the foolish virgin it won't be enough it'll just be enough for us praise god because remember the pressure of the churches and politics right now at this point have they taken away our churches have they stopped our preaching possibly right i would think so if brother man thought that had to happen but see one of them is in a condition to be taken away and the other one's going to be left jesus is going to take the one that made themselves ready the one that received that latter reign the one that had faith for the rapture they they went to they went to work knowing god could change my body today praise god they went to work with that kind of mindset or for our sisters grinding out the middle i love how he does men and women here aren't sisters don't you appreciate that verse 41. two women there it is shall be grinding at the mill just making bread right we got a little we got a a a seed grinder at our house we got a grinder i poured when i made communion bread a few weeks ago i'd put my i think my daughter actually poured it in there and i got the flour out that's just a common everyday thing right for them so women will be doing their common everyday bread making bacon or whatever they're doing teaching right with cobin you might be teaching your children in your home one will be taken and the other left because one of those women had rapturing faith while she's making bread picture that praise god amen you can have rapturing faith while you're working the job while you're baking bread i imagine you got a sweetheart uh singing there's gonna be a meeting in the air and that's sweet oh i want to see jesus look upon his face there to sing forever i'm a saving grace blood is working in the field labor he's dripping sweat but yet he's got the joy of the lord in his heart another mother she's sweating there you know getting the bread ready getting ready to get kneading the bread getting it ready and one minute they're looking over talking about the things you know the next minute look over they're gone so this is the condition and this also goes to show there won't be like a a big financial collapse right because they're still doing out in the field making bread remember he's got to come when they're not expecting it they've got to come at a time when they're saying peace and safety peace and safety he said watch therefore for you know not what hour your lord doth come so while they're sweat while the men are sweating out there in the field or sweating out there on the job right they're still watching spiritually they're watching for the coming of the lord they're ready with rapturing faith for the coming of the lord they're making bread they're they're getting food ready for their kids with rapturing faith in their souls praise god that's beautiful church she will likely be doing regular work when that latter rain or maybe however long it falls we'll just be going about the regular day but i believe we'll have like the bible said we'll have that joy of the lord we'll have that wine praise god amen amen i believe that now brother amen had a good question he said will the rain or the latter rain fall on everyone now my thought is likely because of jesus's parable you have we and tares right you have we end tears well when the rain falls in judea i mean it hits both right i mean it hits the tear and the wheat but depending on the seed it produces that that life inside right in other words they will have some rejoicing in their churches right now they won't get rapture in faith because that's not what's inside of them that's what's inside of us praise god but it's not inside of them so like like brother bam said he said the the tares will shout praise the lord praise so they'll be having good services though he's saying peace and safety god's gonna right god's gonna give us peace and safety and we're gonna say god's gonna take us off the earth amen amen god's gonna harvest the bride off the earth praise the lord amen they're gonna be saying oh we're gonna be safe but we're gonna have a peaceful life and we're gonna have all these uh privileges and we still get to keep our money in our bank accounts and we'll be saying we want to go up to heaven and see the spiritual heavenly bank accounts praise god we want to see we want to be in heaven praise the lord we don't we don't be tied down to this earth so she's made herself ready she's going to go to she's going to go to the bread she's going to make her bread with rapturing faith hallelujah brother bang we're going to go to work with rapture and faith at least somebody will on this earth at least somebody will because jesus said so so see they both got to grow together and brother says uniting time right it's uniting time for each one now i want to just look at uh a few thoughts here about the showdown just briefly so if you go to uh first go to first kings here 18 if you would i just want to look at a few thoughts on this i just had a few thoughts on this i want to share first kings 18. now one of the reasons i felt led to preach on this was because yesterday i was this was my chapter to read about the showdown and then uh i also was listening another sermon and they mentioned the showdown so i thought well they mentioned a lot of rain i thought i'd like to preach on that a little bit then amen said something about today too and i was like okay that's three i think i'll preach on that tonight uh so i think it's uh very scriptural and church as i as amen and i were talking we're just trying to be ready praise god we're trying to be ready with divine love and god will pour out a rain a ladder rain of just more of that more of that love right more of a spirit and that will be that will give us the rapturing faith that we need and we might take it to work and we might take it to the kitchen to feed the babies right feed the kids so first kings 18. all right i'm trying to close up here by god's grace i just wanted to pull out just a few thoughts here now brother branham says uh in each showdown it's the truth against denominations i just want you to get an idea here about let's look at these denominations here a little bit uh in verses 17 to 24 uh elijah sets the stage for the the showdown he said you sacrifice calling your god i'll sacrifice call my god and whoever answers by fire that's the real god amen now i want to look here go down to uh verse 26. and they took the bullock which was given them and they dressed it and called on the name of baal from morning even until noon saying oh baal hear us but there was no voice nor any that answered and they leaped upon the altar which was made and it came to pass at noon that elijah mocked them let me stop right there so apparently they were worshiping from 9 00 a.m because that was the time of the morning sacrifice till noon three hours three hours and i just heard this week that uh one of the brothers who believed brother branham was going to raise from the dead uh at his funeral there in jeffersonville when they laid his body they sang only believe for about two or three hours expecting him to rise but he didn't rise and look at that same spirit right denominational spirit same thing you imagine seeing an only belief maybe good if it's glorious but with a false hope look how close they are and these are this is a burnt offering this is that's what god loves when you give a burnt offering that's god take all of me praise god i'm fully devoted to you because everything's being burned i'm not keeping anything for myself i am fully sold out to you and so the nominations look really sold out to god but they're not they're not really sold out to god because they break his word so and look they they shout they leap they got all the emotion you want and it came to pass at noon that elijah mocked them and said cry aloud for he's a god either he's talking or pursuing or he's in a journey per adventure he's sleeping he must be awake and they cried aloud so they actually tried to prove elijah wrong and they cried louder and cut themselves after the manor with knives and lancets till the blood gushed out of them and it came to pass when midday was passed and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening that was 3 p.m so the evening sacrifice was 3 p.m so this is six hours church six hours call upon god call them on their gods rather and this is the showdown because remember 6 p.m was the end of that day and it went at sundown was the next day so evening sacrifice had to be at three because you got to kill it dress it wash it present it burn it gotta get done before six because that's the next day so six hours brother bang shout and jumping screaming prophesied cutting themselves calling upon god at the showdown they don't get nothing from god amen praise god glory because god is going to vindicate who's on the lord's side praise god and then there was no voice nothing that regarded oh see they don't have a voice but we have a shout voice and trump praise god amen hallelujah they don't have the shot voice trump we've got it to shout the voice and the trump praise god verse 30. elijah said all the people come near to me and all the people came near and repaired the altar of the lord that was broken down now see this is where we see in this showdown the altar or their worship had to be repaired and that's what brother ram came to do repair our worship right prepare it down so see we pray the right way we sing the right songs we preach the right word everything is fixed about our worship praise god it's all fixed it's not too much emphasis on the you know speaking in tongues or too much emphasis on uh on the music right it is it's the right emphasis and it's all orderly just the way god likes it amen i like verse 31 and elijah took 12 stones according to the number of the tribes of the sons of jacob unto whom the word lord came saying israel shall be thy name and with the stones he built an altar in the name of the lord and he made a trench about the altar as great as would contain two measures of seed and he put the wood in order see god's got to order he likes the word right like it is praise god can't be all broken up it's got to be rightly divided put in the right order and he caught the bullock on pieces and laid him on the wood and said fill four barrels with water and pour it on the burnt sacrifice on the wood he said do it the second time and then the second time he said do it the third time did the third time and the water ran about the altar and he filled the trench also with water and it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that elijah the prophet came near and said lord god of abraham isaac and of israel let it be known this day that thou art god in israel and that i am thy servant and that i have done all these things at thy word i love that elijah saw it all by vision that's why he could mock the devil now you and i church shouldn't mock the devil unless we know what's going to happen so i've seen people mock the devil and then their families fall apart i've seen preachers most recent one was a preacher went around saying uh dumb devil dumb devil and his wife a few months after that started out in the message left the message divorced him and now she's with another man a preacher in the message i thought oh we don't we don't do we don't mock the devil right because he'll the bible said even michael the archangel doesn't bring a railing accusation against satan he just says the lord rebukes thee so see it's different if you've got a vision you can go ahead and knock satan all you want if you've got a prophecy knock them all you want that's what elijah did but if not we don't want to uh we don't want to get satan uh all upset and stir him up right because that's foolishness that's foolish to do that because church we're nothing without that's exalt when we do that we're we're exalting ourselves like we have power we have no power we're trusting in the living god in his power so it's pride that would do that pride when even an angel won't rebuke satan and he's got way more power than we got so see we gotta he did all these things at thy word now look at verse 37 i love this hear me o lord hear me that this people may know that thou art the lord god and that thou hast turn their heart back again there it is that's malachi 4. hear me because i'm turning the hearts back to you praise god amen elijah is at the showdown turning the hearts back well in our day it's elijah's message that's turning our hearts back praise god see it's it's beautiful it's just uh perfectly put in there and then verse 41 skip down there elijah said ahab get the up eat and drink for there is the sound of the abundance of rain amen let's stay under our feet i'll stop right there by god's grace i just wanted you to see some of those things about the showdown some of those attributes church the denominational and remember brother that's jezebel religion right that's baal that's the doctrine of balaam like the church ages talks about they will way outwork us and don't they they do i've known all these denominational people they do marathons to raise money to dig uh wells in africa and all over and that's a great thing i don't know i don't know how they find the time to do that actually but they they labor it but did they but then they're half naked then they're running around in bikinis basically now how does that glorify god said you've got to look at the nature of it what's the what's the desire behind it is it to glorify man or glorify god well running around in a marathon in a bikini that don't glorify god so it shows the motivations wrong you see how they see how they worship for six hours and elijah comes around he kills he kills the animal right he pours water on it elijah's was much shorter because it was all directed by the word of the lord i want you to see that church that elijah was a restorer before the fire fell and before the rain came praise god he was a restorer of the hearts the hearts were turned back and so i want to just encourage you church let's uh let's use our time let's use our uh let's not waste our time look at these bail the bail religion they waste their time in things right they're it's all human ideas let's invest our time in restoring the faith of christ let's make sure our lives are restored back to the faith of the fathers that's what i want to say it's good to help the poor like i said i do we do you know we we do that but let's make sure our lives and our worship is restored by the word of the lord and then when that rain falls we'll take it to work we'll take it in the kitchen we'll be ready for the coming of the lord how many of you how many want to be one of those that gets taken off the earth that's what i want to be musicians if you'll come i want to be taken because i've taken christ in my heart that the word is restored in my heart my worship is restored uh my expectations on the lord and i've received the meat in due season tonight hallelujah let's have a word of prayer here let's ask the lord to give us grace and my prayer is going to be that the lord will help us here to manage our time and that god will feed us the meat and due season because we surely need it how many need god's meat in new season amen hallelujah heavenly father lord we've read your word we've preached your word lord this is the best i know about the latter rain this great time that we're told thus say the lord is coming a true prophecy father i've labored
