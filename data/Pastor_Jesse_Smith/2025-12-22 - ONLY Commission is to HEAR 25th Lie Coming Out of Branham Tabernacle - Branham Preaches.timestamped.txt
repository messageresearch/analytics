[0:02] He doesn't change. If he's still got a
[0:05] disciple, that's the same commission. Go
[0:07] ye into all the world, preach the
[0:08] gospel, these signs shall follow them
[0:10] that believe. It's never change. He
[0:12] can't change. [music] He said IN
[0:13] REVELATIONS THE 22ND CHAPTER, WHOSOEVER
[0:16] shall take one word out of this book or
[0:19] add one word to it, his part will be
[0:22] taken out of the book of life. We are
[0:25] not to take from the Bible or add to it.
[0:28] Just say what it says.
[0:31] &gt;&gt; Greetings friends [music] in the
[0:32] matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[0:35] The purpose of this video is to look at
[0:37] a recent blog post from the Brandom
[0:39] Tabernacle which claimed that our only
[0:42] commission is to hear the tapes and not
[0:45] preach. So by God's grace, we'll rightly
[0:47] divide this latest blog post from
[0:50] Brandom Tabernacle. It was posted
[0:52] Saturday, December 20th, 2025.
[0:56] So, that was just two days ago cuz today
[0:58] is Monday, December 22nd. As I've said
[1:01] before, friends, I could look at every
[1:04] blog post from Brandon Tabernacle that
[1:06] comes out every Saturday and find more
[1:08] and more false doctrines if I wanted to,
[1:10] just because this group is greatly
[1:12] deceived. They are way off the word of
[1:15] God. They have added to the Bible and
[1:18] taken away from the Bible in many sad
[1:21] ways. I have a series of videos that
[1:23] show 24 false doctrines coming out of
[1:25] Brandham Tabernacle. And so I could make
[1:28] this subject the 25th. And this is the
[1:31] lie that we're only commissioned to hear
[1:33] and not to preach. Another lie. It's
[1:36] just lie after lie after lie. It's so
[1:38] sad. But that's what an evil spirit
[1:40] does, friends. When someone takes an
[1:42] evil spirit, if it's not repented of, it
[1:44] only grows. Jesus called it like
[1:46] leavenan. A false doctrine is like
[1:48] leaven. It will only grow and puff up
[1:50] until the entire thing is corrupted.
[1:53] Until the entire doctrine is corrupted.
[1:55] And this is done with a spirit of love
[1:57] incorrection. Brother Ram said love is
[1:58] corrective. Brother Bram said if
[2:01] something needs criticized then we need
[2:02] to criticize it. And of course do it in
[2:05] love. The Bible says speak the truth in
[2:06] love. So me making this video again
[2:08] shows my love for Brandon Tabernacle.
[2:11] And Lord willing, I'll try to remember
[2:12] to pray at the end of this video for
[2:14] these deceived people because the blind
[2:16] are leading the blind into more tape
[2:18] worship, into more denying the Bible,
[2:21] into more rejection of the Holy Bible.
[2:24] Sad to say, but that's what's happening.
[2:25] So, by God's grace, let's look at this
[2:27] blog post from a couple days ago.
[2:29] Apparently, they listened to Going
[2:30] Beyond the Camp. It says, "Dear beloved,
[2:33] God does not change. His word does not
[2:34] change. His program does not change and
[2:36] his bride does not change. We will stay
[2:38] with the word. It is more than life to
[2:40] us. It is the fountain of living waters.
[2:43] So far, that's all true. But the bride
[2:45] does not press, play, and obey and deny
[2:48] preachers from preaching because that
[2:49] was Jesus's commission. So, here's the
[2:52] statement in question. Quote, "The only
[2:53] thing we are commissioned to do is to
[2:54] hear the word, which is the vindicated
[2:56] voice of God that has been recorded and
[2:58] placed on the tapes. The only thing we
[3:01] see is not a creed, not a group of men.
[3:03] We see nothing else but Jesus, and he is
[3:05] the word made flesh in our day." End
[3:07] quote.
[3:09] Now I wondered where did our brother get
[3:10] this idea about the only commission we
[3:13] have to do is hear the word of God. I
[3:15] went back in going beyond the camp and
[3:17] brother Bram said this in paragraph 44
[3:20] and notice brother Ram said quote and we
[3:22] find on this little camp up on the
[3:24] mountain transfiguration when they were
[3:27] commissioned to hear the only thing they
[3:29] was commissioned to do was to hear the
[3:30] word. Only thing they seen was not a
[3:34] creed. They never seen nothing else but
[3:35] Jesus and he is the word made flesh. end
[3:37] quote. So the pastor Brandham Tabernacle
[3:41] is using this quote to say that we only
[3:43] listen to brother Brandham. But friends,
[3:46] if you're honest, you can clearly see
[3:48] that's not what brother Brandham was
[3:49] saying. Brother Brandham was saying on
[3:51] Mount Transfiguration, Peter, James, and
[3:53] John were told to only hear the Lord
[3:56] Jesus Christ. They weren't to hear
[3:59] Peter's idea about building tabernacles.
[4:01] So the pastor Brandom Tabernacle is
[4:03] taking this quote out of context, out of
[4:06] biblical context, and also out of the
[4:08] context in which brother Brandham was
[4:10] speaking. And it's so sad. The followers
[4:12] of Brandom Tabernacle will eat that up.
[4:14] They'll think that their pastor is right
[4:15] with the word when in reality he's a
[4:18] million miles off the word of God. I
[4:21] also went back into going beyond the
[4:22] camp and brother Random actually
[4:24] preached the real great commission. So
[4:27] the pastor of bridem tabernacles taken
[4:29] away Jesus's great commission from Mark
[4:32] 16:15. Jesus said go and preach to all
[4:35] nations. He did not say go and press
[4:37] play to all nations and sit down
[4:39] preachers don't preach the gospel. Jesus
[4:42] said the exact opposite. Go and preach.
[4:45] So which commission do we want? Do we
[4:47] want Jesus's commission or the brand
[4:49] tabernacle's commission? I'll take
[4:51] Jesus's commission cuz I know Jesus
[4:52] Christ is the same yesterday, today, and
[4:54] forever. And I know the brand of
[4:56] tabernacle is deceived and they have
[4:58] many false doctrines and levan has
[5:00] filled their church. But notice what
[5:02] brother Ram says. Brother Ram says,
[5:04] quote, "The God that sent Jesus went in
[5:06] Jesus and and the Jesus that sends you
[5:09] goes in you. He that believeth in me.
[5:12] The works that I do shall he do also. Go
[5:15] into all the world and preach the gospel
[5:17] to every creature, black, yellow, white,
[5:20] brown, whatever he might be. These signs
[5:22] shall follow them that believe. how far
[5:24] all the world and to every creature. End
[5:26] quote. So, Brother Ram says this many
[5:28] times throughout the message. We need to
[5:29] keep preaching because the gospel has
[5:31] not gone to all the world yet. Not every
[5:33] creature has heard the gospel. So, I
[5:36] love to find these examples of how
[5:38] worshippers of brother Brandham
[5:39] completely contradict brother Brandham
[5:41] in his own sermons. Brandom tabernacle
[5:44] is using going beyond the camp to try to
[5:47] make the sermon say something that it
[5:48] doesn't. But in the very same sermon,
[5:50] brother Ram is supporting the great
[5:52] commission, Jesus's great commission to
[5:54] go and preach to every creature unto the
[5:56] end of the world. We also see that in
[5:58] Matthew [clears throat] 28:1 19 and 20,
[6:00] which is a parallel text to Mark 16.
[6:04] It's the great commission text. And
[6:06] Jesus said, "Go ye therefore and teach
[6:08] all nations, teaching them to observe
[6:10] all things whatsoever I have commanded
[6:12] you." And Jesus said, "Lo, I am with
[6:14] you. I'm with you preachers, even to the
[6:17] end of the world." world. So, we're not
[6:18] at the end of the world. So, Jesus'
[6:19] preachers are still preaching. They're
[6:21] not pressing play. That's a deceived man
[6:23] who would press play and obey. That's a
[6:25] deceived man who would deny Jesus's
[6:28] great commission. And and that's what
[6:29] Brandham Tabernacle is doing. They are
[6:31] denying and cancelling Jesus's great
[6:33] commission. They've changed Jesus's
[6:35] commission and they will answer to God
[6:38] for that. But let's pray for them to
[6:39] repent. The sad part is Brandham
[6:41] Tabernacle won't even open their Bibles
[6:44] to study their Bibles. In Mark 9:2, we
[6:48] find the story of the mount
[6:50] transfiguration where God said, "Hear ye
[6:52] him." So, we're commissioned to only
[6:55] hear Jesus. But in two places prior to
[6:58] that, in Mark 3:14, Jesus ordained the
[7:00] 12 to preach. And then in Mark 6:12,
[7:04] Jesus sent them out two by two to preach
[7:07] in the cities. So, two times before the
[7:10] Mount Transfiguration, Jesus sent them
[7:12] out to preach. The mount transfiguration
[7:14] was telling the preachers only hear the
[7:16] word of God from Jesus and then preach
[7:19] what Jesus teaches you and what Jesus
[7:22] says to you. And then twice after the
[7:24] mount transfiguration Jesus talks about
[7:27] preaching. In Mark 14:9, Jesus said the
[7:30] woman who washed Jesus' feet would be
[7:32] preached in all the world. So Jesus
[7:35] again supports preaching after the mount
[7:37] transfiguration experience. And then of
[7:39] course Mark 16:15 Jesus gives the great
[7:41] commission. Go and preach to all
[7:43] nations. So random tabernacle tape
[7:46] worshippers have no idea what the Bible
[7:48] says. They don't even care about the
[7:49] Bible really. Their actions prove that.
[7:53] It doesn't matter what their words say.
[7:54] Their actions prove that. They claim the
[7:57] Mount Transfiguration says we're only to
[7:59] hear. But they deny the other four
[8:02] verses. two verses before that where
[8:04] Jesus commisss preachers and two verses
[8:06] after that where Jesus commissioned
[8:08] preachers. These people are blind
[8:11] leaders of the blind. It's so sad. I'll
[8:14] skip down on the blog post here to the
[8:16] paragraph that starts with a man can
[8:18] say. Quote, "A man can say, I know and
[8:20] believe. Brother Brandham was a prophet.
[8:21] He was the seventh angel. He was the
[8:23] Elijah. We believe this message." then
[8:25] make some kind of excuse be whatever it
[8:28] is not to play the only vindicated voice
[8:31] of God in their church. There's
[8:33] something wrong somewhere now. Why? They
[8:36] had made their own camp. End quote. So
[8:38] the pastor random tabernacle with this
[8:40] paragraph is basically saying that
[8:43] living preachers are making excuses to
[8:45] not press play and obey. And of course
[8:49] that's not true. The Bible never tells
[8:51] preachers to press play and obey. Nor
[8:53] did brother Brandham ever tell people to
[8:55] just press play and obey. The sad part
[8:57] is Brandham Tabernacle is making excuses
[8:59] to not preach. They're making excuses to
[9:02] deny the Bible commission from Jesus
[9:04] Christ to preach the gospel. Living men
[9:07] preaching the living word of God. And
[9:10] he's right. Something is wrong
[9:11] somewhere. And the thing that's wrong is
[9:13] the false doctrines coming out of
[9:15] Brandham Tabernacle. Now the 25 false
[9:17] doctrines coming out of there. And
[9:19] they're the ones who made their own
[9:20] camp. Brother Brandham never set up a
[9:22] camp to just say press, play, and obey.
[9:25] All the preachers, stop preaching. Just
[9:26] sit down and let Brother Brandham
[9:28] preach. Brother Brham said he's just one
[9:30] pebble on the beach. Brother Random
[9:32] specifically said he wasn't the only one
[9:34] to preach. And I put a video out earlier
[9:37] this year how brother Brandham said,
[9:38] "Preach until Jesus returns." I'll leave
[9:40] a link to that in the description. So,
[9:43] Brandham Tabernacle is denying all these
[9:44] quotes where Brother Ram talks about
[9:46] preach until Jesus returns. And they do
[9:49] that to their own shame.
[9:52] Next, the Pastor Brandham Tabernacle
[9:54] says he's not trying to divide, but
[9:56] unite. But of course, he is dividing.
[9:58] And it's so sad. This shows him his
[10:00] motives. He wants everyone united around
[10:02] him, which is a denominational camp.
[10:04] He's made his own camp, his own
[10:06] denomination, and gone away from the
[10:08] word of God. His ministry looks nothing
[10:10] like Brother Brandham's ministry. He
[10:13] says, quote, I say these things not to
[10:15] separate the church. God's word does
[10:16] that. I want us to unite together, be
[10:18] one unit with each other and with him.
[10:20] But there's only one way to do that
[10:22] around the voice of God on the tapes.
[10:24] That's God's only thus sayith the Lord.
[10:26] End quote. And that's a lie. Brother
[10:28] Ram's words are not the only thus sayith
[10:30] the Lord. Brother Brandham said the
[10:32] Bible is thus sayith the Lord. Brother
[10:34] Ram said every word in the Bible is thus
[10:36] sayith the Lord. From 1953 resurrection
[10:39] of Lazarus. Brother Ram said, "That's
[10:41] the only book there is in existence is
[10:43] that Bible and I believe every word of
[10:45] it. Just I believe it just like it's
[10:47] just written there. I just ready to hang
[10:50] my soul on any phase and say it's thus
[10:53] sayeth the Lord. Yes, sir." End quote.
[10:56] Every phrase of the Bible is thus sayeth
[10:59] the Lord. And the bride has a voice. So
[11:01] here Brandham Tabernacle is trying to
[11:03] get rid of the voice of the bride which
[11:06] brother Ram said the bride has a voice
[11:07] in the church age book. Oh, God still
[11:10] has a voice for the people of the world
[11:11] even as he has given a voice to the
[11:13] bride. That voice is in the bride as we
[11:16] have said and we'll talk more on that
[11:18] later. So, who gave the bride a voice?
[11:20] It was God. So, Brandham tabernacle
[11:22] cannot take away the voice of the bride
[11:25] and say there's only one voice. Brother
[11:27] Brandham and the Bible say that the
[11:29] bride has a voice. The Bible says that
[11:31] in Revelation 22:17, the spirit and the
[11:34] bride say come. And brother Brandham
[11:35] said, "Yes, listen to the authenticated
[11:37] prophet of God who appears in this last
[11:39] age." Yes, we will, Brother Brandham.
[11:41] Because Brother Brandham said, "Preach
[11:42] until Jesus returns." Brother Ram said,
[11:44] "Don't change a thing about evangelism
[11:46] or the five-fold ministry." Brother Ram
[11:48] said, "Just say what the Bible says."
[11:51] And I just found a quote today from
[11:53] October 30th, ' 62. And brother Bram had
[11:55] a vision. He said in the vision, he
[11:57] screamed out, "I am commissioned to
[12:00] preach only the Bible." But the
[12:02] congregation walked on. Maybe I'll make
[12:05] a separate video about that. By God's
[12:07] grace, brother Rand was commissioned to
[12:09] only preach the Bible. And that's what
[12:11] Brandham Tabernacle is not doing.
[12:13] They're adding to the Bible. They're
[12:15] taking away from the Bible in at least
[12:16] 25 ways. And then, Brother Ram said,
[12:19] "What he says from God, the
[12:21] authenticated prophet of God, the bride
[12:23] will say." And that's exactly right.
[12:25] Brother Random never said, "Press, play,
[12:26] and obey." Brother Ram never said, "Sit
[12:28] at home for training for the rapture.
[12:31] Don't physically gather at church.
[12:32] Brother Ram never said that. Brandham
[12:34] Tabernacle saying many things the Bible
[12:36] doesn't say. And what they say the bride
[12:38] and what they will say will have already
[12:41] been said in the word. Oh, how
[12:42] comforting for the bride of Jesus
[12:43] Christ. We just have to say what the
[12:46] Bible says. Breadom Tabernacle is not
[12:49] saying what the Bible says. But the
[12:50] bride of Jesus Christ is saying what the
[12:52] Bible says. Now later on in the blog
[12:55] post they list a quote from going beyond
[12:57] the camp where brother Brandham said
[12:59] even this tape would meet in their homes
[13:02] or or their churches. And yes, brother
[13:05] Brandham acknowledge that maybe this
[13:06] tape of going beyond the camp would be
[13:08] played in homes or churches. But then
[13:10] Brandon Tabernacle's pastor uses that
[13:13] one quote and makes that quote thus
[13:15] sayeth the Lord. He says it in this
[13:17] paragraph. Quote, "Glory to God. Hear
[13:19] it. Read it. It's thus sayith the Lord."
[13:21] And not only did he say it, but by
[13:23] playing the tapes in your homes and
[13:24] churches, the great God of heaven will
[13:26] honor the sincerity of our hearts and
[13:28] heal the needy and give us whatever we
[13:30] have need of. End quote. How sad that
[13:34] Brandham Tabernacles pastor makes this
[13:36] quote, "Thus sayith the Lord." There is
[13:38] no thus sayith the Lord in this quote.
[13:40] Brother Ram said, "The way you know a
[13:42] quote is thus sayeth the Lord is if
[13:43] brother Bram says thus sayith the Lord."
[13:45] Of course, that's from He Cares Do You
[13:47] Care. Any honest message believer knows
[13:49] that from 1963.
[13:52] But I would ask the Brandham tabernacle
[13:53] pastor, what about all the other quotes
[13:55] here in going beyond the camp where
[13:56] brother Ram supports the great
[13:57] commission of preachers? Isn't that thus
[14:00] sayith the Lord? But no, only his select
[14:02] quotes that he likes are thus sayith the
[14:04] lord. So it shows the level of deception
[14:07] and delusion, the spirit of delusion, a
[14:10] strong delusion that this church is
[14:11] under, which is a great rebuke on them.
[14:14] The blog post goes on to say, quote,
[14:16] "This one quote proves the people are
[14:18] listening to their pastors are not
[14:20] hearing the word or they would challenge
[14:23] them and prove them by the word. We are
[14:25] in his perfect will and it is his
[14:27] perfect will to play the tapes in our
[14:29] churches." End quote. Know that one
[14:31] quote about playing tapes in going
[14:34] beyond the camp does not prove preachers
[14:36] are to sit down and just press play.
[14:39] Remember in going beyond the camp,
[14:40] brother Bram supported Jesus's great
[14:42] commission. quote, "Go ye into all the
[14:44] world and preach the gospel to every
[14:46] creature, black, yellow, white, brown,
[14:48] whatever he might be." How far to all
[14:52] the world and to every creature. End
[14:53] quote.
[14:55] In the same sermon, you have brother Ram
[14:57] supporting preaching and then just being
[14:59] thankful people are playing the tapes in
[15:01] churches and homes. Brother Ram was not
[15:03] trying to get rid of preaching because
[15:05] there's quotes inside the sermon where
[15:06] brother Random says, "Preach to all the
[15:08] world, to every creature." And this goes
[15:11] back to the lie that the Brandom
[15:13] Tabernacle pastor said. He said, "Yeah,
[15:15] thus sayith the Lord there in the
[15:16] perfect will of God to press play and
[15:19] disobey." And again, friends, I believe
[15:21] that's proof that this man is not a
[15:23] prophet and he would be a false prophet
[15:26] for saying, "Thus sayith the Lord,
[15:28] they're in the perfect will of God by
[15:30] denying Jesus's great commission to go
[15:33] and preach." Jesus never said, "Go and
[15:35] press play." Jesus said, "Go and
[15:37] preach." You cannot be in the perfect
[15:39] will of God by denying the perfect word
[15:41] of God, the Holy Bible. Romans 12:1 and2
[15:44] says you can prove the perfect will of
[15:46] God. Brandom Tabernacle cannot prove
[15:49] preachers are to stop preaching and
[15:51] they're to sit down and just press play
[15:54] and bury their preaching talents in the
[15:56] ground like Matthew 25 says. And then
[15:58] everyone's to sit at home and not
[16:00] physically gather more as we see that
[16:02] day approaching and break Hebrews 10:24
[16:05] and 25. They are deceived. Then the
[16:07] Brandom Tabernacle pastor says, quote,
[16:09] I'm not misplacing or misquoting the
[16:11] word like so many say. I do. Hear it and
[16:13] read it for yourself. End quote. No,
[16:16] he's deceived. He is misplacing and
[16:18] misquing the word of God. He can hear
[16:20] and read for himself earlier in the
[16:22] sermon when brother Ram said, "Go ye
[16:24] into all the world and preach the gospel
[16:26] to every creature." How far? All the
[16:29] world and to every creature. He's taking
[16:31] one quote about listening to tapes and
[16:34] deleting all the other quotes about
[16:36] preaching. That is a strong delusion.
[16:38] That's the very definition of a strong
[16:40] delusion. Picking and choosing, picking
[16:43] one quote about tape playing and
[16:45] deleting all the quotes about preaching.
[16:47] And the final quote we'll look at says,
[16:49] quote, "It's so easy and so perfect.
[16:51] Just press play and hear the voice of
[16:52] God speak to you. Say amen to every word
[16:55] you hear. You don't even have to
[16:57] understand it. You just have to believe
[16:59] it." End quote.
[17:00] Yes, it is easy to just press play
[17:03] because you don't have to labor as the
[17:06] Bible says as a workman needeth not
[17:08] being ashamed rightly dividing the word
[17:10] of truth. Yes, it's easier to deny your
[17:13] gift and to bury your gift in the
[17:15] ground. But a true child of God will not
[17:17] bury their gift in the ground. A child
[17:19] of God will take the harder way just
[17:20] like brother Ram took the harder way.
[17:22] And there's a great reward for him
[17:23] because he chose the harder way like
[17:26] Danny Henry's thus sayith the Lord
[17:28] prophecy about brother Brandham. And
[17:29] every true man of God will choose the
[17:31] harder way to preach the word of God, to
[17:33] study, to labor, to fast and preach
[17:36] God's living word behind a pulpit and
[17:38] not sit down and press play and disobey
[17:40] the word of God. And no, you can't say
[17:42] amen to every word you hear from brother
[17:44] Brandham. Brother Ram said women have
[17:46] sperm. Would Brandham Tabernacle say
[17:48] amen to that? Brother Ram said total
[17:50] annihilation to all the world by 1977.
[17:54] Would Brandham Tabernacle say amen to
[17:55] that? Brother Ram said Billy Paul was
[17:58] his promised Joseph in 1951.
[18:01] Does Brandham Tabernacle say amen to
[18:03] that? Brother Random said the third
[18:05] person of the Trinity burned in his
[18:06] heart in 1952. Does Random Tabernacle
[18:09] say amen to that? Do they have the third
[18:10] person of the Trinity in their heart as
[18:12] well? This proves press play and obey
[18:15] false preachers are lazy. They just want
[18:18] the easy way out. And Satan always
[18:20] offers the easy way out. But God's
[18:22] people will not take the easy way out.
[18:24] God's people will take the way with the
[18:26] Lord's despised few. And just like
[18:28] brother Random said, it's the big
[18:30] churches that are off the word of God.
[18:32] Look at this big movement. Look at the
[18:33] millions following Brandham Tabernacle
[18:35] today. The easy way attracts all the
[18:38] people. It's the broad way. It's not the
[18:41] narrow way that leads to life. It's not
[18:42] the hard way. Jesus said, "Few there be
[18:44] that find the narrow road that leads to
[18:46] life.
[18:47] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[18:47] &gt;&gt; It's the big churches with all the
[18:48] millions of dollars, the brand new
[18:51] buildings which Brennham Tabernacle
[18:53] renovated and made a brand new building.
[18:55] They're the ones who get off the word of
[18:57] God. And we should say amen to every
[18:59] word of the Bible that we hear from
[19:02] living men preaching the living word of
[19:03] God. Brother Ram said there's only two
[19:05] seeds. There's the seed of God and the
[19:08] seed of the devil. Brother Ram said,
[19:10] quote, "One tree is for the word of God
[19:12] exactly as God gave it and loves it and
[19:15] obeys it. The other tree is from the
[19:17] seed that is antitheord of God and
[19:20] changes it where it wants to. End quote.
[19:23] So which seed today is trying to believe
[19:26] the Bible to love and obey the Bible
[19:28] exactly as God gave it? Where is tape
[19:31] playing and silencing preachers in the
[19:34] Holy Bible? It's not in there. So their
[19:36] movement is of the wrong seed. I hope
[19:38] they can be saved. I hope they can
[19:40] repent of their false doctrines. But
[19:42] they do not believe the Bible exactly as
[19:44] God gave it. and they don't love the
[19:47] five-fold ministry the way Paul gave it
[19:49] through the direction of the Lord Jesus
[19:51] Christ and they do not obey that. They
[19:52] make tape boys the true five-fold
[19:54] ministry. That's a lie. That's false
[19:56] doctrine. That's heresy. Tape boys are
[19:58] not in the Bible. They're not part of
[19:59] the five-fold ministry.
[20:02] In closing, friends, hope this video was
[20:04] a blessing by the grace of God. Friends,
[20:06] God never gave Brandom Tabernacle any
[20:08] right to change the great commission.
[20:09] They cannot change what Jesus gave us in
[20:12] Mark 16 and Matthew 28. The brand of
[20:15] tabernacles is ruling their people by
[20:17] the rulership of man and not the rule of
[20:19] the Holy Ghost. Brother Bram said he
[20:21] believed in the rule of the word of God
[20:24] according to Hebrews 13:7. Remember them
[20:26] which have the rule over you whose who
[20:28] have spoken unto you the word of God
[20:29] whose faith follow considering the end
[20:31] of their conversation. Jesus Christ the
[20:33] same yesterday, today, and forever.
[20:35] Brother Ram said the Holy Ghost fililled
[20:37] men of God rule by the word of God. And
[20:39] that rule is found, of course, in
[20:41] Ephesians 4 with the five-fold ministry.
[20:44] The true five-fold ministry does not
[20:45] change one word of the Bible. They only
[20:47] say what the Bible says. But Brandham
[20:50] tabernacle is ruled by man because they
[20:52] break the word of God as Mark 10:42-44
[20:56] warns us about. The Lord Jesus warned us
[20:58] about this rule of man who made their
[21:01] own camp, their own camp of creeds about
[21:03] press, play, and obey, sit at home, no
[21:06] living preachers. Every word on tape is
[21:08] thus sayith the Lord which is heresy.
[21:10] That's a rule by man. But Jesus called
[21:13] them to him and saith unto them ye know
[21:16] that they which are counted to rule over
[21:18] the Gentiles exercise lordship over
[21:21] them. And their great ones exercise
[21:23] authority upon them. And that's exactly
[21:24] what Brandham Tabernacle has done. They
[21:27] lord over the people. They exercise
[21:29] authority on them outside the word of
[21:30] God. They tell them don't go to church.
[21:32] They say make your home a church. But
[21:34] that's not what the Bible says. The
[21:36] Bible says gather more as you see that
[21:38] day approaching. Now in the Bible days,
[21:39] of course, they had to have home
[21:40] churches. That's because they didn't
[21:42] have enough money to build their own
[21:43] churches and have a public place of
[21:45] worship. But now we have that ability by
[21:47] the grace of God. Just like brother
[21:49] Brandham had that ability and brother
[21:50] Brandham did not set at home. He went
[21:52] physically to church and he ordained
[21:54] everyone to do that. And I'll end with
[21:56] this quote from Christ's mystery of God
[21:58] revealed. Brother Ram said, quote, "If
[21:59] God is in your heart, you can't hardly
[22:01] wait for them doors to open out yonder,
[22:03] to get in here to fellowship with your
[22:05] brothers. If you don't don't feel that
[22:08] way, then I tell you, it's time you got
[22:10] to praying." And then he quotes Hebrews
[22:12] 10:24 and2, a Bible-based prophet. Thank
[22:15] God for Brother Bram's ministry cuz
[22:18] we're in the last days where the Bible
[22:20] exalted or exhorted us to to much more
[22:22] as we see that day approaching to love
[22:24] one another with Christian love and
[22:26] divine love to assemble ourselves
[22:27] together in heavenly places and Christ
[22:30] Jesus and love one another. This will
[22:32] all men know you are my disciples when
[22:34] you have love for the other. That's
[22:36] right. Stay right together. End quote.
[22:38] So this proves random tabernacle does
[22:40] not have the love of God because they
[22:41] sit at home and they neglect the
[22:43] assembling of the saints together where
[22:45] we're where we are to provoke one
[22:47] another unto good works as Hebrews 10
[22:49] says preach the word of God bring us to
[22:52] a unity of the faith as Ephesians 4 8-16
[22:55] says and bring us into the fullness of
[22:56] the stature of Jesus Christ that's only
[22:58] done through living preachers that's not
[23:00] done by pressing play and obey that's
[23:02] disobedient to the word of God so we can
[23:05] thank God if God is in our heart we
[23:06] still go to church we still here. Living
[23:09] preachers, we do not change Jesus's
[23:10] great commission. Thank God for the Holy
[23:13] Ghost that's here to help us obey
[23:15] Jesus's great commission. We can't wait
[23:18] for the church doors to open to obey
[23:20] Jesus's great commission. But let's pray
[23:22] for the tape worshippers. Father God, I
[23:24] pray you'd bring these tape worshippers
[23:26] to repentance. May they see all the
[23:28] times they've broken the word of God.
[23:30] They've made their own man-made
[23:32] denominational camp. I pray they would
[23:34] repent of their sins. open their eyes
[23:36] from their blindness, dear God.
[23:39] And may they only say what the Bible
[23:41] says. May they stop adding to Brother
[23:43] Ram's quotes. May they stop misapplying
[23:45] Brother Ram's quotes, misinterpreting
[23:47] Brother Ram's quotes. Help them to
[23:49] repent of their sins. Give them eyes of
[23:53] enlightenment to the word of God. May
[23:55] they believe every word of God is thus,
[23:57] sayith the Lord. and may they reject the
[24:00] deity spirit that idolizes brother
[24:02] Brandham and every word on his tapes.
[24:05] Lord have mercy on them. I pray you draw
[24:08] them to repentance in Jesus Christ's
[24:10] name. Amen.
