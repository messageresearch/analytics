[0:00] [Music]
[0:06] greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:08] of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of
[0:10] this video is to teach nine proofs of
[0:13] the serpent Seed doctrine we want to
[0:15] give a disclaimer that this video series
[0:17] contains mature subjects like adultery
[0:20] human reproduction and so forth Parental
[0:23] Guidance is certainly
[0:25] encouraged before we teach the nine
[0:27] proofs we want to summarize the doctrine
[0:29] of the serpent seed for those unfamiliar
[0:31] with it the word serpent seed come from
[0:35] God's own words in Genesis 3:15 so God
[0:38] is the one who originated this truth
[0:40] that the serpent had seed or offspring
[0:43] or children here's how God's words about
[0:46] the serpent having seed or offspring
[0:48] should be
[0:49] understood the forbidden fruit that Eve
[0:51] partook of in Genesis 3:6 was an act of
[0:55] sexual adultery with the serpent not a
[0:58] literal apple as many erroneously
[1:01] believe Proverbs 30:20 and Song of
[1:04] Solomon 51 clearly teach that eating can
[1:07] be symbolic of sexual relations such is
[1:11] the way of an adulterous woman she
[1:12] eateth and wipeth her mouth and saith I
[1:15] have done no
[1:16] wickedness I am come into my garden my
[1:19] sister my spouse I have gathered my
[1:22] myrrh with my spice I have eaten my
[1:25] honeycomb with my honey I have drunk my
[1:27] wine with my milk eat oh friends drink
[1:31] yay abundantly oh
[1:35] beloved after partaking of the fruit of
[1:37] adultery with the serpent Eve conceived
[1:39] a child from the seed of the serpent
[1:41] which is why God later recognized that
[1:43] the serpent had seedar Offspring in
[1:46] Genesis 3:15 Genesis 3:6 stated that
[1:50] after Eve partook of the fruit she went
[1:52] and shared that fruit with Adam meaning
[1:54] she had sexual relations with Adam after
[1:57] she had relations with the serpent Eve
[1:59] then received CE the seed of Adam and
[2:01] conceived again now Eve had two
[2:03] different seeds growing inside her from
[2:05] these two sex acts the seed of The
[2:08] Serpent and the seed of Adam which two
[2:10] seeds God himself recognized and later
[2:13] the two seeds resulted in two sons Cain
[2:16] and Abel from two different fathers
[2:18] Cain's father was The Serpent and Abel's
[2:21] father was Adam so the story of the fall
[2:24] of mankind by the first and original sin
[2:26] in Genesis 3: 1-6 has two symbols that
[2:30] are not to be understood literally which
[2:33] are the eating of fruit and the two
[2:36] trees the eating of fruit was symbolic
[2:38] of sexual intercourse according to
[2:40] Proverbs 30:20 2 Corinthians 11: 2 and 3
[2:44] Song of Solomon 4: 12 all the way to
[2:48] chapter 5: 1 and Romans 7: 1: 5 a fruit
[2:54] is the end result of a seed and the
[2:56] serpents lie to Eve that she would not
[2:59] surely die if she partook of the fruit
[3:01] was a spiritual seed or thought that was
[3:04] planted in her mind that liar seed that
[3:06] was planted in her mind eventually came
[3:09] into fruition and produced the fruit of
[3:12] an adulterous act with the serpent which
[3:14] God recognized by stating that the
[3:16] Serpent's Seed would have hatred against
[3:18] the woman's seed Eve partook of this
[3:21] fruit with the serpent and then shared
[3:22] it with Adam who also partook of the
[3:24] fruit as mentioned
[3:26] earlier the two trees in the midst of
[3:29] the garden known as the tree of life and
[3:31] the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil
[3:33] were symbolic of the two spirits of
[3:36] Jesus and Satan these two trees were not
[3:39] literal trees like all the other trees
[3:41] in the garden as we will explain soon in
[3:43] this video we will now teach on nine
[3:45] proofs of the serpent Seed
[3:47] doctrine proof number one of the serpent
[3:50] seed is the Bible supports the serpent
[3:53] Seed doctrine from Genesis to
[3:55] Revelation Moses Jesus St Paul St Peter
[4:00] and St John all supported the serpent
[4:02] Seed doctrine through their teachings
[4:05] Moses of course was the author of the
[4:07] book of Genesis and recorded Genesis
[4:09] 3:15 in which God himself said that the
[4:12] serpent had a seed or offspring which we
[4:14] can prove to be Cain for he was of that
[4:17] Wicked one according to 1 John
[4:20] 3:12 the Lord Jesus himself taught the
[4:23] serpent Seed doctrine in Matthew 13:
[4:27] 24-30 and: 36-4 3 in this Parable Jesus
[4:32] described the children of God as good
[4:34] seed while the children of the wicked
[4:35] one Satan were tears or bad seed
[4:39] according to verse 38 the parable which
[4:41] has numerous applications teaches that
[4:44] two different men or sers planted two
[4:47] different seeds in one field the two men
[4:50] then represent God and Satan and the
[4:52] field represents the world this Parable
[4:56] also helps reveal the origin from the
[4:58] Garden of Eden of the two two kinds of
[5:00] children the children of God and the
[5:02] children of the devil two men Adam and
[5:05] the serpent planted their seeds in one
[5:07] field or one woman Eve the seeds or
[5:11] offspring grew up and manifested their
[5:13] different Natures Cain the son of the
[5:15] serpent slew righteous Abel for Cain was
[5:18] of the cursed
[5:19] Seed St Paul supported the serpent Seed
[5:22] doctrine in 2 Corinthians 11 veres 2 and
[5:24] 3 by directly comparing the virginity of
[5:27] the church in Corinth to ease virginity
[5:30] when she was presented to Adam Paul said
[5:33] it was his desire to present the
[5:34] Corinthians as a Chase virgin or
[5:37] spiritual virgin to Christ then Paul
[5:40] went on to say that he feared the minds
[5:42] of the Corinthians would be corrupted
[5:44] and they would lose their spiritual
[5:46] virginity just as the serpent corrupted
[5:49] the mind of Eve and she lost her
[5:51] spiritual virginity and also her
[5:53] physical virginity for God said she had
[5:55] two different seeds immediately after
[5:58] she partook of the fruit and shared it
[6:00] with
[6:01] Adam St Peter supported the serpent Seed
[6:04] doctrine in second Peter 1:4 stating
[6:07] that corruption was in the world through
[6:09] lust which is a desire for that which is
[6:12] forbidden we see the Bible teaches that
[6:15] Eve lusted after the fruit of adultery
[6:17] as also taught by Genesis 3:16 in which
[6:20] God declares the consequences of Eve sin
[6:23] one of which was that Eve's desire would
[6:25] now be to her husband this means that
[6:28] Eve's desire was not to her husband Adam
[6:31] before God gave this consequence but her
[6:33] lustful desire was to the serpent who
[6:36] gave Eve of his own
[6:37] Seed St John supported the serpent Seed
[6:40] doctrine in 1 John 3: 6-15 we have
[6:44] already mentioned verse 12 in this video
[6:47] but we will again point out that the
[6:49] holy spirit said Cain was of the wicked
[6:52] one and we know Adam was not the wicked
[6:54] one for the phrase Wicked one always
[6:57] refers to Satan as Jesus called Satan
[6:59] the wicked one twice in Matthew 13: 19-
[7:03] 38 and St John mentioned the wicked one
[7:06] three other times in his same letter
[7:09] chapter 2: 13- 14 and chapter 5: 18 and
[7:13] each time it meant Satan not Adam Cain
[7:17] even had his own separate genealogy that
[7:19] is separate from Adams in Genesis 4:1
[7:22] 17- 24 as Adam's genealogy is in Genesis
[7:27] 5:
[7:28] 1-32 Adam Adam's genealogy stated that
[7:31] Seth was in the image and likeness of
[7:33] Adam but the Bible never says that Cain
[7:36] was in the image and likeness of Adam
[7:38] furthermore the Bible states that Eve
[7:40] was the mother of all living in Genesis
[7:42] 3:20 but scripture never says that Adam
[7:44] was the father of all living because he
[7:47] was not the serpent was the father of
[7:49] Cain and Eve was indeed the mother of
[7:53] Cain proof number two of the serpent
[7:55] seed is the two trees in the midst of
[7:58] the Garden of Eden were not literal
[8:00] trees because the tree of knowledge of
[8:02] Good and Evil was not good for food in
[8:05] Genesis 2:9 the Bible said that every
[8:08] tree out of the ground was good for food
[8:11] this proves that the tree of knowledge
[8:12] of Good and Evil was not a regular tree
[8:15] because when Eve partook of it it caused
[8:17] sin and death the tree of knowledge and
[8:20] good and evil was not good for food like
[8:22] every other tree of the garden and out
[8:24] of the ground made the Lord God to grow
[8:26] every tree that is Pleasant to the sight
[8:28] and good for food the tree of life also
[8:30] in the midst of the garden and the tree
[8:32] of knowledge of Good and
[8:34] Evil since sin and death came from the
[8:36] Tree of knowledge of Good and Evil it
[8:38] could not have been good by any means
[8:41] any tree that will kill you is not good
[8:43] for food thus we can say two things
[8:46] about the tree of knowledge of Good and
[8:47] Evil first it did not come from the
[8:50] ground second its fruit was not good for
[8:53] food this proves that the tree of
[8:55] knowledge of Good and Evil was not a
[8:57] physical tree but a spiritual tree the
[9:00] evil spirit of
[9:03] Satan the two trees in the midst of the
[9:05] garden were symbolic of the two spirits
[9:08] of Jesus and
[9:10] Satan in fact we believe these two trees
[9:13] are still available today both the
[9:15] spirit of Jesus and the spirit of Satan
[9:17] offer fruits or human actions that can
[9:20] be experienced by humans just as Adam
[9:23] and Eve experienced in the Garden of
[9:24] Eden Eve was deceived into eating the
[9:27] fruit of adultery off the tree of the
[9:29] the spirit of Satan just as Hosea
[9:32] rebuked Israel for eating the fruit of
[9:34] lies from Satan's spirit in Hosea
[9:37] chapter 10: 13 any sinful Act is a fruit
[9:40] of Satan on the contrary any Act of
[9:43] Godly obedience and righteousness is a
[9:46] fruit of the Holy Spirit or the spirit
[9:48] of Jesus
[9:49] Christ so we now see that we may choose
[9:52] to eat of either spiritual tree worldly
[9:54] knowledge or words of eternal life which
[9:57] leads to our third proof
