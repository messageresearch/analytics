TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] I'll stand like a weather vein. I'll do anything you want me to do. Only I want the Holy Ghost. I'm determined to get it. When you surrender fully, he'll come in fully. But until you surrender, he can't come in fully. Greetings, friends, in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of this video is to answer a question I received recently. Do believers have to work for the Holy Ghost baptism or the filling of the Holy Ghost? And the answer is yes. The Bible teaches this, but it's speaking of a different kind of work. It's speaking of the work of each Christian to learn to obey the Holy Spirit instead of the flesh. This is certainly a deeper subject, but that's expected because the baptism of the Holy Ghost is called a mystery in Colossians 1:26 and 27. The mystery that was hid from ages, but is now revealed Christ in you, the hope of glory. So, how does Christ get in you? He must be born in you. And every birth requires labor in the natural and the spiritual. A pregnant mother must labor to give birth. And so in the spiritual, each believer must go through a time of laboring in order to bring forth new life. As Jesus said in John 3, you must be born again. There's two points that I want to address as far as foundational points. The first is Ephesians 2 8-10. I believe this. We are saved by grace through faith, not of works, lest any man should boast. All my videos prove this. This is what brother Brandon preached as well. God's true prophet. We're only saved by grace. After you're saved, though, the Bible speaks that there are two more works of grace for a total of three works of grace. Justification is being saved. It's God declaring you righteous by faith in the blood of Jesus Christ. But then grace keeps working. Grace then sanctifies you or purifies your vessel, purifies your daily habits. And then third, and finally, grace allows you to be filled with the Holy Ghost or baptized with the Holy Ghost or born again, receive the new birth, Christ in you, the hope of glory. I'll be mentioning numerous videos that will help you if you go watch them. I think the first one I'll mention is that the new birth and the baptism of the Holy Ghost are one and the same as God's prophet, Brother Ram, taught. Also, here's a visual for the three works of grace. This is a visual from my 2021 book. I have an entire chapter on Christ in you, the hope of glory, the mystery of the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Man's natural birth has three works. Man's spiritual birth has three works. As you can see, the Old Testament tabernacle was cleansed through three courts. Outer court, holy place, holiest of holies. Ezekiel prophesied of the three works of grace. He said there you have a new heart, new spirit, and then God's spirit. Jesus taught the three works of grace in Mark 4:28, the blade, the ear, and the full corn. And then Jesus said he would take us through these three works because he's the way, the truth, and the life. I have two videos also about the three works of grace. So, I'll leave a link to those in the description as well. And friends, remember, brother Ram said his message was the three works of grace. He told a story about his mother having a dream. There was three steps leading up to the path that would take a person to heaven. And a woman said she could walk on this path in high heels. And brother Ram tried to warn her, but she did it anyway and she fell off. In other words, you can't receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost and live a worldly life. My old mother, she's gone on now and she was a very odd woman and she's, you know, Indian and she was odd. But in there, she was a person that didn't dream. But I don't think she only had four or five dreams all of her life. But every time she dreamed a dream, it was true. She had a dream, it was true. I remember one time I first started preaching many years ago. We living right up here on the road right above here. I was preaching right here at this church and she dreamed a dream that I was standing here by the side of a three steps. And I was standing preaching to everybody that they must walk up these three steps before they hit the highway. And on the highways, a little pearly like white line run right into the the the doors of heaven to the pearly gates. And that pearl had been stretched out to the top of these steps. If that ain't my message exactly today, justification, sanctification, baptism. And I was saying that a person has to come by these three steps to be able to walk that highway and said that there was a lady came by. Now you know what kind of shoes people wore 35 years ago. There's a lady come by had on a great big pair of like they wear today spiky shoes and she come by and I said wait a minute sister you can't walk that highway is that and I said you you can't do it. And she said uh she said she looked around and said, "Don't believe him. He's a mad man. Don't believe him. I'll show you I can be justified, sanctified, and filled with the Holy Ghost still walking." And she I just let her go. Couldn't do no more about it. Couldn't stop her. And she jumped up on the highway, looked back at the sister, said, "Yeah, I told you." She started run up and she You know what the Bible said in Isaiah 5th chapter that they have outstretched necks. They have to to pitch over. Amen. see mincing as it has to it has to twist mincing as they go making a tingling with her heels the daughters of Zion in the last days and she started up that highway just as hard as she could run and as well that throw got narrow and narrow she started reeling mincing like that and off she went mother said the harvest screams that I ever heard in my life was that woman falling into those flames and smoke going down down like that I turn around and said see she just obeyed Everything but one word. See, everything but one word. Sure, Pentecostal women can be saved, sanctified, and filled with the Holy Ghost. And then failed. Absolutely. Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word. See, see, and she failed it. And as I said, see, she should have went on in. All right. But see, she failed to listen. Tell her what was ahead. and he's wrote the gospel by the disciples, apostles, the doctrine of the apostles and prophets and so forth and they won't listen. The three works of grace were also foreshadowed when Israel left Egypt and made its way to the promised land. There was three stages of their journey. The first stage was leaving Egypt. The second stage was the wilderness and the third stage was crossing Jordan. So, it took three stages to enter into the promise. And that's what we'll see in the New Testament as well. Before getting to these four important Bible points, I've interacted with numerous people out of denominations and friends, it's so sad. They teach that you are filled with the Holy Ghost the moment you get saved. And that is an awful lie. That's a great deception. Think of it. You know, some people get saved when they're four, five, six, seven years old. And do they look like they're filled with the Holy Ghost after they say a prayer of repentance? No. Certainly not. And then think about adults that are really worldly. Will they get saved in denominational churches and people tell them they're filled with the Holy Ghost? Are they filled with the Holy Ghost? Certainly not. A lot of them continue in their sins, their dirty habits. So, it's an awful, awful, false doctrine to tell people they are filled with the Holy Ghost as soon as they're saved. Do they have the Holy Ghost working in their life? Of course. It's called the new heart as Ezekiel taught in Ezekiel 36. You get a new heart, but then you need a new spirit. You need a transformed mind and then you get God's spirit to dwell in your soul. Let's start looking at these four Bible proofs. The first proof is the main Bible text that says you must labor to enter into the promise of God. It's Hebrews 4 1-12. I'm just going to summarize this. But verse one says, "Let us therefore fear lest a promise being left us of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it." Verse two says we must mix faith with the word preached. Then verses 8 and N say if Joshua or Jesus had given them rest then he would not afterward have spoken of of another day. So this tells us the rest Hebrews 4 is talking about is not Sunday or Saturday. It's not a Sabbath day of physical rest. It's spiritual rest. Verse 9, there remainth therefore a rest of the people of God. And verse 10 tells us what it is. The rest is you ceasing from your sinful works and then living or obeying and doing the works of the Holy Ghost. Verse 10, for he that has entered into his rest, he also has ceased from his own works as God did from his. So someone who's filled with the Holy Ghost now does the works of God very frequently. They cease from their old sinful works. And notice back to verse one, Hebrews 4:1 speaks of a promise we must enter into. This is the same promise Jesus spoke of in Acts 1:4. He told them to wait for the promise of the father. They should not depart from Jerusalem. And then Acts 15 tells us what the promise is. Ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence. So it's undeniable. The promise to enter into in the new covenant is the baptism of the Holy Ghost. This is also seen in Galatians 3:14. That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith. So it's undeniable we must labor to enter into that rest. We must labor to enter into the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Remember friends, in the Old Testament, they could not receive the Holy Ghost in the soul. There's three parts to man according to 1 Thessalonians 5:23. body, spirit, soul. Soul is the deepest inner part of your being. In the Old Testament, they couldn't receive the Holy Ghost in the soul because their sins were only covered over by the blood of bulls and goats. Jesus says this plainly in John 7:38 and 39. He talks about living water. But then in verse 39 it says, "But this spake he of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because that Jesus was not yet glorified." So this tells us the Holy Ghost could not come into the soul of the believer until after Jesus died and raised with a glorified body. And that's what they received on the day of Pentecost. That was the promise of the father. It's undeniable Bible truth. So that's the main text. Hebrews 4:1-12. We have to enter into the promise through laboring. Now, we'll see a little later that labor doesn't mean what it means in other places. It means diligence. Let's next look at the rest for the soul. Now, in Hebrews 4 1 3 4 5 8 9 10 and 11, it speaks of this rest. And it's the rest for the soul. It's not a physical day of rest like Saturday or Sunday again. And to prove that, we're going to look at two other portions of scripture. Isaiah 28:11 and 12. For with stammering lips in another tongue will he speak to this people to whom he said, "This is the rest." So what is the rest? It's the speaking in tongues that came on the day of Pentecost. Now we know tongues is not the evidence of the Holy Ghost today. But God used it on the day of Pentecost as a supernatural sign and wonder to the 17 nations that were gathered there in Jerusalem in Acts chapter 2. He said, "This is the rest wherewith you may cause the weary to rest, and this is the refreshing, yet they would not hear." So the rest, the baptism of the Holy Ghost was going to fall on the day of Pentecost on these Jews that were in the upper room, and they were going to have stammering lips and another tongue. It's undeniable. This is the rest that God promised. Jesus told them in Acts 14 to go wait for this rest. Go wait for the promise. And then Paul says that this verse Isaiah 28:11-2 was about the day of Pentecost. He says that in 1 Corinthians 14:21 in the law it is written with men of other tongues and other lips will I speak unto this people. And yet for all this they will not hear me sayeth the Lord. So God even foretold that most of Israel would reject the baptism of the Holy Ghost. So Isaiah 28 11-12 spoke of the rest of the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the soul. And when Jesus was on the earth preaching, he said he was going to send a rest for the soul, not a rest for the body. So not Saturday Sabbath or Sunday Sabbath, not rest for the mind, but rest for the soul. This is in Matthew 11:28 and 29. Come unto me all you that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. In other words, to the people that are tired of going on in their sinful life with bad sinful habits. Stop doing your own works as Hebrews 4 said, "But do the works of God." Matthew 11:29, "Take my yoke upon you and learn of me, for I meek and lowly in heart, and ye shall find rest unto your souls." So, it's undeniable. You must labor to enter into this rest. And that rest is in the soul. Let me read 1 Thessalonians 5:23 again to show how there are three parts. And I pray your whole spirit, that's your mind, and your soul, that's the innermost part of you, your nature, the nature of your being, and your body. So there's three parts, spirit, soul, body. Be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. Now, this third point is very important. The word labor in Hebrews chapter 4 means diligence. So here's a screenshot of that. It means to hasten, to exert oneself, to give diligence. So this is speaking of you must give human effort. You must, in other words, do the will of God. Die to your own will and do the will of God. Just as Jesus prayed in the garden of Gethsemane, not my will, but thine be done. So we must give diligence. We must exert our effort to obey the word of God. We're not earning the Holy Ghost. We're dying out to our human will to receive the Holy Ghost. So again, let us labor or let us give diligence therefore to enter into the rest. This is the same diligence 2 Peter 1:10 speaks of. Give diligence to make your calling and election sure. And what is Peter talking about? Give diligence to what? Give diligence to add more anointing of the Holy Ghost to you. Add faith, virtue, add knowledge, add temperance, add patience, add godliness, add brotherly kindness, and add charity. So see, we must give diligence. We must obey the Holy Spirit. And then God gives us more anointing. That's what this means. To work for the Holy Ghost, we must obey the Holy Ghost. We must bring our bodies and minds into obedience to the Holy Ghost. Paul calls it a war in Romans chapter 7. I preached on that recently. He said, 'I see the law of my members warning against the law of my mind. I want to do good, but evil's right there with me. That's what this is referring to, laboring or waring against the sinful nature of the flesh in order to obey the Holy Spirit. And this is scriptural, giving diligence to obey. This is part of the greatest command. Mark 12:30, "Thou shalt love the Lord your God with all thy heart, with all thy soul, with all thy mind, and with all thy strength." That word strength is very important. That's being diligent. When you give God your strength, you're being diligent. You're working against the temptations of the flesh. You're working against the sin nature. You're working against your fleshly will in order to do the will of God. So the word diligence is a synonym or means the same as work in Hebrews chapter 4. Labor to enter into this rest. So this can be stated four different ways. We work for the Holy Ghost according to Hebrews 4:11. Labor for the promise. Labor to enter into rest. Work for the Holy Ghost. Another way to say it is be diligent for the Holy Ghost. That's according to second Peter 1 5-10. And then he said, "If you do these things, you shall never fail." So again, doing, in other words, obeying, submitting to the Holy Ghost. We must submit to the Holy Ghost if we want to be filled with the Holy Ghost. God will not force his spirit on anybody. So now we have three words that mean the same. Work for the Holy Ghost. Labor for the Holy Ghost, be diligent for the Holy Ghost. Here's a fourth one. Yield for the Holy Ghost. That's according to Romans 6 12-4. The Bible said, "Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body that you should obey it in the lust thereof." So again, it's dealing with obedience. Neither yield your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin, but yield yourselves unto God. For sin shall not have dominion over you, for you're not under the law, but under grace. So this is how we overcome sin. We've got to yield. We've got to work. We've got to be diligent. We've got to labor against the sin nature. It's undeniable Bible proof, friends. And then I love this one. Acts 5:32, God gives the Holy Ghost to them that obey him. So, do we have to work for the Holy Ghost? Yes. Work against your sinful nature. Do we have to obey for the Holy Ghost? Yes. It's thus sayith the scripture, Acts 5:32. There's other ways to explain this as well. Jesus said, "Take up your cross daily." And what is a cross? It's crucifixion. And you have to crucify your own sinful will every single day. Luke 9:23. We're talking about crucifying the sinful desires of the flesh in order to obey more of the word of God. Paul said this in 1 Corinthians 15:31. I die daily. He's speaking of the same thing Jesus was talking about. Dying to the sinful nature of the flesh. That's the work. That's the labor. That's the yielding. Paul says it plainly in Romans 8:13. If I live through the spirit, I mortify the deeds of the body. That mortify means to kill. That's the work. That's the labor. Killing out the sinful desires and doing God's desire. And then he says Romans 8:14, for as many are as led by the spirit of God, they are the sons of God. What does the spirit of God lead us to do? Kill our sinful desires. labor to obey the word of God. Be diligent to obey the Holy Ghost. Yield to the Holy Ghost. Obey the Holy Ghost. But it takes a death and its work to die. It's hard to die out to the daily sinful desires. I also want you to see this important scripture. It's 1 Corinthians 15:10. Paul said, "I labored more abundantly than they all." He's talking about all the other apostles, the 11 other apostles that were faithful. yet not I, but the grace of God which was given unto me. So Paul says he labored and did more missionary work than any of the 11 apostles. He said, "But it wasn't me. It was the grace of God." So now we see a another truth to this. When we work for God, it's actually God's spirit strengthening us to do the work. We're not working of our own works. We're working God's works. And that's what Hebrews 4 is about. ceasing from your works and doing the works of God through the power of the Holy Spirit. Paul calls it grace that caused him to work harder than anybody else. It wasn't his human efforts. It was the spirit of God motivating him to do the works of God. So, we're working for the Holy Ghost. In other words, we're working to die out to our sinful nature. We're working against the sinful flesh. We're working to die out. We're working to crucify daily the lust of the flesh, lust of the eyes, pride of life, so we can be led by the Holy Spirit. So we can do the works of the Holy Spirit, not our own works. The fourth point I want to make is that love is the motivation for all godly works. And you could make it interchangeable, love or grace. You could say either one. And we get this again from 1 Corinthians 15:10. Paul said, "I labored more than everybody because the grace of God that was in me." So we could say grace is the motivation for works or we could say love is the motivation for works as Galatians 5:6 says faith which workketh by love. So we can make like a flowchart. How do we do the works of God? Well, it starts with love. You have to have the love of God in your heart or you could replace that with the grace of God in your heart. Love motivates faith because it says faith works by love. So everything starts with love of God. And again that's the greatest commandment according to Jesus. loving God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength. So if you love God, that will motivate your faith and then the faith will go to work. Faith works by love. So we have to have these three components. This is when you've entered into God's rest. The love of God is motivating your faith and faith is going to work. We also see this in Titus 2:14. Jesus gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto himself a peculiar people zealous of good works. So that's what the Holy Spirit does. It creates a zeal in us to be purified to crucify the sinful desires of the flesh every day so we can be zealous for good works. And any seasoned Christian knows this. Every day I got to crucify the sinful desires of my flesh to make videos to study for preaching to do any labor for the kingdom of God. Just like Paul said, it was the grace of God motivating him. Every Christian knows that it's God's love that motivates us to do the works of Jesus and works for Jesus. There's a few quotes from brother Brandham I'd like to play. The first one is from 1957. Brother Random connects Isaiah 28, the rest that God promised through stammering lips. He connects that with Hebrews chapter 4, labor to enter into that rest. And then he connects that with Matthew 11 where Jesus said, "I'll give you rest for your souls." Beautiful quote. Ties all these things together. The rest of God is the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Let's listen to the quotes. Watch what Paul said. If Jesus would have given them rest, he would have spoke of another day. But he limited a day, saying, David, after so long a time, when you hear his voice, harden not your heart. And there remainth, listen now, ninth verse, there remainth therefore, a rest, a Sabbath to the people of God. For he, the man or woman, that has entered into his rest, come unto me all you labor and heavy laden, and I'll give you rest, has ceased from his works as God did from his. Say, brother Benham, what happens? You get the Holy Ghost. Amen. Christ comes into you. Is that right? Turn with me to Isaiah the 28th chapter. For with stammer lips, and with other tongues will I speak to this people, to whom it is said, this is the Sabbath, wherein ye shall cause the weary to rest. This is the refreshments. Yet they would not hear. For the word of the Lord came unto them. Somebody preached it. Precept upon precept upon precept, line upon line upon line, here a little and there a little, that they might go and fall backward and be broken and snared and taken. Amen. What is the rest? When did the rest come? when people spoke with other tongues and had stammered lips. Stammerred lips. They didn't speak nothing. They stammered. When did that happen? On the day of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost come. That is the rest. The Holy Ghost. Jesus said, "Come unto me all you wear and heavy laden. And I'll give you rest. I'll give you life. Eternal life." Zoe, God's own life. God will come into you and be a part of you. He'll give you a birth and make you a son and daughter. The next quote is from Albuquerque, New Mexico. God hiding himself in simplicity right after the preaching of the seven seals, April 12th evening, 1963. Brother Ram's leading people to the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And if you want a good recording of that, listen to that sermon. In fact, the last 45 minutes, Brother Ram's leading people to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And he's basically showing them how to labor to be born again. In other words, how to be diligent to die out to the sinful nature and be filled with the Holy Spirit. Brother Ram says, "When you surrender fully, he'll come in fully." I thought that's a good way to say it. Working for the Holy Ghost is working to surrender. Working against the fleshly desires, the sin nature, and surrendering to God's will. Brother Ram said, "Surrender your thoughts, surrender your thinking, surrender your life, surrender your all, surrender your prestige, surrender everything to him. He'll come in and fill you with the Holy Ghost. Beautiful quote. Let's listen to the quote. Stay right with it. Stay right with it. Just stay right there. You haven't been standing there five minutes yet. Stay right there. You promised it, God. I'm here to receive it. All right. There it is. Reach right out. Say, "I receive it. Here it is, Lord. I want it. I I stood up here. I'm sincere. I mean it. You promised it to me." Amen. Glory. Hallelujah. Just keep believing. Keep you said you believe me. The Holy Spirit, that light just keeps moving around over the building. What is it? It's hunting somebody that'll open up. I tell the truth. Amen. [Music] Kyle, raised up your hands and praised him, saying, "Lord, I thank you. You give me the promise. I'm going to hold you the promise. Thank you, Lord. Thank you. I I'm looking right at it. [Music] Stay right with us. Stay there, Lord. I'm going to stay right here. I don't care if it's in the morning. I'll be standing right here praising you. I know you're going to send it. This convention's ending tonight. And I'm here without the Holy Ghost. I'm going away from here filled with the Holy Ghost. So help me. You promise it. I'll stand like a weather vein. I'll do anything you want me to do. only I want the Holy Ghost and I'm determined to get it. When you surrender fully, he'll come in fully. But until you surrender, he can't come in fully. Surrender. Surrender your thoughts, surrender your thinking, surrender your life, surrender your all, surrender your prestige, surrender everything to him now. And he'll come in and fill you with the Holy Ghost. That's what he's sure to do. It already struck you a three year in the building. It's more than that. in the Holy Ghost. Just keep believing. [Music] Glory to God. [Music] Humble your own thinking. Humble your own ways. And friends, I have a lot more helpful videos if you'd like. I'll leave a link to this audio book of chapter 6 of my 2021 book, Christ in You, the Baptism of the Holy Ghost. It's a Mystery. This chapter, by God's grace, fully explains this mystery. It'd be very helpful for you to listen to that by the grace of God. Also, another video is you can be saved but yet not born again in the soul. So, this shows how there's three parts to man. And it gives five Bible examples in the New Testament of people that were saved but yet not born again. A great example is Cornelius in Acts chapter 10. He was saved because he was fasting, praying, giving alms, but he had not received the baptism of the Holy Ghost until Peter came and preached to him. It's a beautiful story. I'd recommend anybody reading that. Acts chapter 10. The next video is what I mentioned earlier. New birth and baptism of the Holy Ghost are one and the same. Brother Ram's quotes and scriptures. Another good one is 12 terms for the baptism of the Holy Ghost. The Bible uses at least 12 different terms in order to define the one self-same event, the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Very important. Hope you'll watch that by God's grace. And last one, how to receive the Holy Ghost and how you'll act when he comes. I think I made the statement daily read, Bible, pray. So if you look at the scriptures from the Lord Jesus Christ and Paul, basically every day we have to read our Bibles, pray, and then obey. If we do that, we will be filled with the Holy Ghost. It's a Bible promise. It's undeniable. In closing, friends, hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God. Excellent question. It's a deep understanding. It's a deep revelation that God gave to brother Brandham. And then we prophesy it again. As Revelation 10 8-11 says, we're eating this book and then we can prophesy it again. We can foretell it again by the grace of God. Yes, we must labor against the flesh. We must labor to be diligent. We must labor to obey the Holy Ghost and then we'll be filled with the Holy Ghost. It's undeniable. It is Bible truth. It's Bible revelation. I trust you've been blessed today. If you feel led, share this with a person that might be seeking the baptism of the Holy Ghost. I think it'll be a great help to them by the grace of God. If you have any questions, concerns or testimonies about this video, please contact me. God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart. Very happy to be here this afternoon and again in defense of the gospel of Jesus Christ to bring the good tidings, the good news that Jesus raised from the dead, living among man today, his church. The same Jesus that was yesterday will be today and forever. He's never failed. [Music]
