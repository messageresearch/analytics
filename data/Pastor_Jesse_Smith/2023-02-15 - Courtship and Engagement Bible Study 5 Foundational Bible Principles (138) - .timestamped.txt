[0:08] s in the mattress name of the Lord Jesus
[0:12] Christ the purpose of this video is to
[0:15] give a simple basic teaching on
[0:17] courtship and engagement
[0:19] I felt impressed by the Holy Spirit to
[0:22] recently teach this at my local church
[0:25] and now I'd like to share it with the
[0:26] Saints by the grace of God
[0:28] the outline of this video is simple
[0:30] we'll start with five fundamental
[0:33] principles about courtship and
[0:35] engagement
[0:36] and then look at the three stages in a
[0:38] relationship
[0:40] and before we get started I do want to
[0:42] say I'm thankful for all the youth
[0:44] conferences and youth meetings that the
[0:46] ministers have held over the years where
[0:48] they focused on courtship and engagement
[0:50] I've never attended one but I'm thankful
[0:53] for all the efforts to help the youth in
[0:55] this message and the efforts to help any
[0:58] Christian Youth prepare for marriage
[1:00] because again marriage is the second
[1:01] greatest decision outside of salvation
[1:04] by God's grace I've only married three
[1:06] couples and I'll likely marry a fourth
[1:09] couple in the near future so I don't
[1:11] have a lot of experience with these
[1:13] subjects but I believe the Holy Ghost
[1:15] has equipped me through the seasons of
[1:17] life where I've needed the Bible truths
[1:19] on these subjects and of course I have
[1:21] eight children so my oldest is 18. it
[1:25] seems at some point in the future I'll
[1:27] likely be dealing with courtship and
[1:29] engagement topics more frequently and
[1:31] Friends lastly I know there's variables
[1:33] in each courtship situation I know it's
[1:36] likely that each experience is different
[1:38] for every couple that's courting or
[1:40] engaged for example it could be that a
[1:43] single sister's dad has passed away and
[1:45] so she doesn't have the headship of her
[1:47] father or a single sister's parents are
[1:50] not Believers and yet she's a Holy Ghost
[1:52] Field Christian she's a message believer
[1:54] and so that situation would be different
[1:56] than other situations
[1:58] of course if you have any questions
[2:00] contact your local Pastor if you don't
[2:01] have a local Pastor you can text me your
[2:04] questions as well by God's grace
[2:07] so let's begin with five fundamental
[2:09] principles for courtship and engagement
[2:14] the first principle is honor the
[2:17] god-ordained headship in First
[2:19] Corinthians 11 verses 1 through 3 Paul
[2:22] gives the headship for the entire
[2:24] universe so it begins with the invisible
[2:27] Spirit god holds the highest preeminence
[2:29] he's on top of all headship under God
[2:33] the invisible spirit is Christ the human
[2:35] body of Jesus Christ which is of course
[2:38] filled with the fullness of the godhead
[2:39] bodily that body being in subjection to
[2:42] the invisible spirit inside of it under
[2:45] Christ you have man and under Christ you
[2:47] have woman
[2:48] and then of course First Corinthians 11
[2:50] verses 4 through 16 show how that
[2:53] headship is connected through physical
[2:55] hair all Christian women and really all
[2:57] women in general should grow long uncut
[3:00] hair that is a sign they're under the
[3:02] headship of their husband or if they're
[3:04] not married yet their father and that
[3:07] means they're to follow the Holy Ghost
[3:08] leadership of their husband or their
[3:11] father
[3:12] the next verse is First Corinthians 7
[3:14] verses 36-38 here Paul talks about
[3:17] fathers would be able to give their
[3:20] daughters in marriage now of course
[3:22] remember the Bible is an Eastern book
[3:24] and we're westerners here in the United
[3:26] States
[3:27] so in the Eastern customs and Eastern
[3:30] family traditions the father has much
[3:31] more control over the marriage of his
[3:33] children than Western families and
[3:36] Western traditions
[3:38] so in this text First Corinthians 7
[3:40] 36-38 Paul says some fathers can choose
[3:43] to give their daughters a marriage or
[3:45] not give their daughters in marriage so
[3:47] in Paul's time in the Eastern tradition
[3:49] fathers had a lot of control over their
[3:52] daughters and could refuse giving them
[3:54] in marriage now in the western culture
[3:56] that usually isn't the case once a girl
[3:58] reaches 18 years old she can choose
[4:01] whether to be married or not she doesn't
[4:03] have to have the approval of her father
[4:05] but again we're speaking best case
[4:07] scenario a Holy ghost-filled Father and
[4:09] a holy ghost-filled daughter would be in
[4:12] one Accord by the leadership of the Holy
[4:14] Ghost on whether that daughter should be
[4:16] married to a certain man or not
[4:18] and also with this thought we see how
[4:20] there's Christian Liberties allowed
[4:22] within Eastern culture and Western
[4:25] culture
[4:26] Eastern culture is my exercise more
[4:29] influence and control over marriage
[4:31] choices whereas Western cultures might
[4:34] have less control and less influence
[4:36] over marriage choices
[4:38] but each one needs to find the middle of
[4:40] the road the balance of the Holy Ghost
[4:42] In other words each father and daughter
[4:45] must pray fast and seek God for the
[4:49] perfect will of God for the daughter's
[4:51] marriage
[4:53] in Numbers Chapter 30 the entire chapter
[4:55] verses 1 through 16 we see the Old
[4:58] Testament shadow of this truth this
[5:01] chapter speaks of the finality of a vow
[5:04] in this chapter you'll see if you read
[5:06] it by God's grace that in Moses day and
[5:09] going forward in the Old Testament any
[5:11] vow a woman made had to be approved by
[5:13] her father if she wasn't married and
[5:16] also any married woman any vow she made
[5:18] had to be approved by her husband so in
[5:21] this context we see again that God
[5:23] ordained headship that God set in place
[5:26] every vow a woman made had to be
[5:28] approved by her headship either a
[5:30] husband or her father if she wasn't
[5:32] married yet
[5:34] so with this first foundational
[5:35] principle we understand that single
[5:38] sisters are under the headship of a Holy
[5:40] ghost-filled Father and they should
[5:42] honor the leadership of that Holy
[5:44] ghost-filled Father
[5:45] now again I know there are situations
[5:47] where maybe a father isn't filled with
[5:49] the Holy Ghost and so that's a subject
[5:51] for a different video
[5:53] but I hope you understand by God's grace
[5:54] the point of these verses from First
[5:57] Corinthians 11 First Corinthians 7 and
[5:59] numbers 30 verses 1 through 16.
[6:03] the second foundational principle is the
[6:05] finality of the vow or the promise to be
[6:07] married this is found in Matthew 1 verse
[6:10] 20 and of course this goes along with
[6:12] Numbers Chapter 30 1-16 so in Matthew 1
[6:15] verse 20 the angel Lord appeared unto
[6:18] Joseph and said fear not to take Mary
[6:21] thy wife when we understand the context
[6:24] of this verse Joseph and Mary were only
[6:26] engaged and yet the angel of the Lord
[6:28] already recognized that they were
[6:30] married the promise to be married is
[6:33] final and it cannot be broken
[6:35] so before that decision is made before
[6:37] the vow to marry someone is made it
[6:40] should be done with much prayer fasting
[6:42] seeking the Lord and godly counsel
[6:44] between a father her mother and the
[6:46] daughter
[6:48] the third foundational principle is
[6:50] complete physical Purity in the courting
[6:53] and engagement process
[6:55] this is found in First Corinthians 7 1-9
[6:57] the main verse I want to emphasize is
[7:00] verse 1 it is good for a man not to
[7:03] touch a woman so when a young man is
[7:05] interested in marrying a woman he should
[7:07] not touch her outside of just shaking
[7:09] hands and the reason is because it will
[7:11] lead to Temptation and of course for the
[7:13] world it always leads to fornication
[7:15] that's what First Corinthians 7 verse 2
[7:18] says a man shouldn't touch her to avoid
[7:20] fornication verse 9 says because young
[7:24] people have a burning desire for
[7:27] intimate relations and so it's good for
[7:29] a man not to touch a woman so friends I
[7:32] believe when a young single man and
[7:34] single woman are courting they should
[7:36] only shake hands they should never hold
[7:38] hands but I believe once a couple is
[7:42] engaged I believe holding hands is okay
[7:44] and perhaps a side hug but I do not
[7:46] encourage frontal hugs because the
[7:48] woman's reproductive parts and the man's
[7:51] reproductive parts are touching and a
[7:54] couple should save their first kiss to
[7:56] the wedding day I believe those
[7:58] guidelines would honor Paul's words in
[8:02] First Corinthians 7 verse 1 for a
[8:04] complete physical purity
[8:07] guideline number four is guard your
[8:09] emotions this is found in proverbs 4
[8:11] verse 23 which says keep thy heart with
[8:14] all diligence for out of it are the
[8:16] issues of life this verse means guard
[8:18] your emotions a couple that's courting
[8:21] should not get carried away in their
[8:23] emotions their lustful desires or their
[8:25] lustful imaginations because it could
[8:28] lead to fornication
[8:29] if they don't guard their emotions or
[8:31] realize the person they're recording
[8:32] could be someone else's husband or
[8:34] someone else's wife they could get too
[8:36] fixated on the person and rush into the
[8:39] marriage before praying and fasting
[8:41] enough to see if it's the perfect will
[8:43] of God it's better for couples to go
[8:45] through numerous courtships staying
[8:47] physically pure and not giving away
[8:49] their emotions than to just jump into
[8:51] the first courtship and give all their
[8:54] emotions away to someone and get married
[8:55] too quickly without seeking the will of
[8:57] God first
[8:59] and Fifth and finally the fifth
[9:00] foundational guideline is never court or
[9:03] married an unbeliever this is found in
[9:05] second Corinthians 6 verses 14 through
[9:07] 18 and then also any widow or widower is
[9:11] told to remarry only a Christian in
[9:13] First Corinthians 7 verse 39. God's
[9:16] Prophet told us to never marry an
[9:18] unbeliever
[9:20] and no believer should every marry an
[9:23] unbeliever under no circumstance
[9:27] always marry believers
[9:32] court and eventually get engaged to only
[9:34] a Christian and the best case scenario
[9:37] is a holy ghost-filled Christian again I
[9:39] know God has different testimonies for
[9:41] different people but for the sake of
[9:42] this video I'm speaking of the best case
[9:44] scenario one holy ghost-filled person
[9:46] should only choose to marry a holy
[9:48] ghost-filled person
[9:51] three stages in a relationship
[9:56] years ago I heard a preacher say there
[9:58] were three stages in any potential
[10:00] marriage relationship and I thought that
[10:01] was a good teaching the first stage is
[10:04] friendship in this stage the single man
[10:07] and woman are just friends maybe they
[10:10] see each other at church or they talk at
[10:12] youth Banquets but this relationship is
[10:15] friendship only I personally believe
[10:18] there should be no texting going on
[10:19] between the single man the single woman
[10:22] and of course just handshakes and
[10:24] pleasant conversations
[10:26] the second stage is courtship and
[10:29] counseling stage
[10:31] in this stage if a young man is
[10:33] interested in courting a woman that
[10:35] young man should have a full-time job he
[10:37] should have income he should be ready to
[10:40] be married and to have a family and this
[10:43] young man who's interested in a young
[10:44] woman should then approach that young
[10:47] lady's father first according to the
[10:49] scripture and see if the father believes
[10:52] his daughter is mature enough to begin a
[10:54] courtship for potential marriage because
[10:56] with real Holy Ghost Field Christians
[10:58] there should be no dating only courtship
[11:00] if the single young lady's father agrees
[11:03] to a courtship and that young man should
[11:05] start spending time with the entire
[11:07] family of the single lady he's
[11:09] interested in that way he can see the
[11:12] family Dynamic he can see how the lady's
[11:15] interested in is treating her parents
[11:18] her siblings he can see her true
[11:20] character and of course spend time with
[11:22] her at church see how she worships see
[11:23] how she loves the Lord and of course all
[11:26] physical Purity is kept during this
[11:29] stage if the young man feels LED of the
[11:31] Holy Ghost to continue pursuing this
[11:34] single young lady for marriage then they
[11:36] should do counseling with one of their
[11:38] pastors now in my church I do seven
[11:41] counseling sessions the seventh is just
[11:43] questions and answers but I'll list the
[11:45] six counseling sessions that I do with
[11:47] courting couples
[11:49] the first is courtship boundaries
[11:52] the second is marriage expectations and
[11:55] Ministry the third is money and finances
[11:57] the fourth is Family Planning and the
[12:00] physical relationship
[12:02] the fifth is communication and conflict
[12:04] management the six is Bible beliefs and
[12:07] the seventh is questions and answers
[12:11] and then throughout the counseling
[12:12] process as a pastor I've asked the
[12:15] couple to consider whether they want to
[12:17] continue the courtship or not and then
[12:19] the young man has to make the decision
[12:21] am I going to continue courting this
[12:23] young lady or do I stop the courtship
[12:25] and if all the physical boundaries and
[12:28] spiritual boundaries were kept and the
[12:30] couple decides to depart and there's no
[12:32] harm done and both families can remain
[12:34] Christian Friends by the grace of God
[12:36] but if the young man feels led to marry
[12:38] her then he must ask for permission to
[12:42] propose to her from her father and
[12:44] mother by God's grace
[12:46] the third stage is engagement of course
[12:49] this is when the man proposes his love
[12:51] for the single sister and if she accepts
[12:54] and Promises to marry the young man and
[12:57] both parents agree and the couple is
[12:59] married at that time spiritually by The
[13:03] Vow they made just like Matthew 1 verse
[13:05] 20 says now at that point then I do
[13:07] believe the married couple can hold
[13:09] hands and give side hugs but of course
[13:11] not too much because the more physical
[13:13] touch they allow the more Temptation
[13:16] they would allow as well so they got to
[13:19] use wisdom they got to use Temperance
[13:20] self-control and they have to keep the
[13:23] guidelines for physical Purity all the
[13:24] way to their wedding day by God's grace
[13:27] now of course in the Bible days after
[13:30] the engagement was made according to
[13:32] Jewish history the Jewish man who's
[13:34] going to get married would take one year
[13:36] and he would build his own house or
[13:38] prepare his own house for his future
[13:40] wife that he's espoused to or engaged to
[13:42] and also friends before I forget I do
[13:45] have numerous videos about marriage and
[13:47] divorce if you have any questions about
[13:48] that you can reach out to me for those
[13:50] links or you can find them on my YouTube
[13:52] channel those would be a great help to
[13:54] you by God's grace
[13:55] we see this idea of the man preparing a
[13:59] future home for his wife in Matthew
[14:00] chapter 25 in the parable of the wise of
[14:03] foolish virgins in the context the
[14:05] bridegroom has prepared his home and
[14:07] then he's coming at an unknown hour to
[14:10] fetch his bride and take her to the
[14:12] marriage supper as Matthew 25 verse 10
[14:15] says and they that were ready went in
[14:17] with him to the marriage and the door
[14:19] was shut
[14:20] so the engagement phase lasts as long as
[14:23] it takes for the single man who's
[14:26] engaged now to prepare a home and
[14:28] prepare all the details of the wedding
[14:30] with his future wife it lasts all the
[14:33] way up till they get married and then by
[14:35] God's grace they have their wedding day
[14:37] and perhaps a honeymoon by the grace of
[14:39] the Lord
[14:41] in closing
[14:43] friends I hope this video was a help and
[14:45] a blessing I thought about this subject
[14:47] over the years and wanted to make a
[14:49] video on it before but I felt now would
[14:51] be a good time to make the video since I
[14:53] just taught on it in our local church
[14:55] last Sunday night by God's grace we got
[14:58] some good feedback and it seemed to have
[15:00] helped the single Saints in our
[15:01] congregation and also the teenagers and
[15:04] young adults so I know it's a very basic
[15:07] and general Bible study but if you're in
[15:09] this situation where you're courting or
[15:12] thinking about courting then I would
[15:14] highly advise you to read through all
[15:16] those scriptures presented on this video
[15:18] and to reach out to leadership your
[15:21] headship whether it's father and mother
[15:23] or just father or just mother and of
[15:25] course These Are Holy ghost-filled
[15:26] Saints a holy ghost-filled Pastor by the
[15:29] grace of God
[15:30] friends I know there's a lot more detail
[15:32] a lot more scriptures and of course
[15:33] quotes from God's Prophet brother
[15:34] Branham that could be added to this
[15:36] video but I just want to get out a
[15:38] courtship and engagement Bible study to
[15:40] help those who may need it and of course
[15:42] we can do a part two or three later on
[15:44] by the grace of God
[15:47] if you have any questions concerns or
[15:49] testimonies about this video please
[15:51] contact me
[15:53] God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[15:56] the desire of your heart
