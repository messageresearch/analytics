[0:02] I've married many couples but it always
[0:05] reminds me of Christ and his
[0:08] bride one of the weddings that I
[0:11] performed here some time ago it it was
[0:13] quite an outstanding thing in my life
[0:15] it's been several years ago when I was
[0:18] just a young Minister my brother was
[0:20] working on the uh pwa I don't where
[0:23] anybody over here remembers that yet or
[0:25] not anybody as old as me um and that was
[0:29] um uh project that the government had
[0:32] and my brother worked up about 30 miles
[0:35] they were digging U out some Lakes a
[0:39] project for the
[0:40] conservation and there's a boy who
[0:43] worked up there with him from
[0:44] Indianapolis about oh about a 100 miles
[0:47] above Jeffersonville where I I live or
[0:51] live and there was um e said to my
[0:54] brother one day he said doc he said I I
[0:59] I'm going to get married if I just had
[1:01] enough money to pay the preacher he said
[1:03] I got enough money to get my license but
[1:05] said I haven't got enough money to pay
[1:07] the preacher doc said well my brother's
[1:10] a preacher and and he he may marry you
[1:13] he said he never charges people for
[1:15] things like that he said well you asked
[1:18] him if he'll marry me well that night my
[1:21] brother asked me I said if he's never
[1:23] been married before either one of them
[1:24] and there everything's all right he said
[1:27] well he asked him and I said if it is
[1:29] tell him come on down so when Saturday
[1:33] come along and the boy came down it's
[1:35] been a great thing for me to always look
[1:38] back upon
[1:40] this i' had
[1:42] U rainy afternoon in an old
[1:46] chevret car with the headlights wired on
[1:50] with a bailing wire I drove up out front
[1:54] just a while after I'd lost my wife and
[1:56] I was batching two little rooms and and
[2:00] Doc was up there with me waiting for
[2:02] them and and a boy got out of the car
[2:05] and it certainly didn't look like a
[2:06] groom to me or wood to anybody I guess
[2:10] yeah I could bear buy a pretty good pair
[2:12] of shoes for a dollar and a half and he
[2:16] had on a pair was run over and his
[2:18] trousers that was real baggy and it had
[2:22] on a one of these old mle skinn jackets
[2:25] I don't guess some of you older people
[2:27] would remember it looked like it run
[2:28] through a washing machine without being
[2:30] wrenched and it was streaking tied up
[2:33] like this the corner up and uh a little
[2:37] lady got out on the side with a little
[2:40] oh some I'm little checky look dress I
[2:42] don't know I made a mistake on calling
[2:44] that kind of goods one time Gangham I
[2:46] believe it's called and um so um it was
[2:49] um I said it wrong again
[2:53] I and I said uh she got out of the car
[2:57] and they come up the steps and and when
[3:00] they walked in the poor little thing she
[3:04] I guess she just about all she had on

[3:09] hardly on she hit hike from Indianapolis
[3:11] down had a little hair hanging down back
[3:14] and along kind of a plat down her back

[5:00] wondered where he Tak her a few days I
[5:03] asked my brother doc where he is said go
[5:05] down to new AUB a little city blow us
[5:07] and down on the River where I had some
[5:09] tin laying up where I went every day
[5:11] when I was I was a lineman so when the
[5:13] rest of the fellas they all sat around
[5:14] told jokes and things I'd get in the
[5:16] truck and run down on the River and Pray
[5:18] doing that men uh and read my Bible
[5:20] under a big piece of 10 where an old
[5:23] Armon Works used to be there's a bunch
[5:25] of old box cars sitting down there and
[5:28] this fell had went down there and got
[5:29] one of them box cars and sought him a
[5:31] door in it and had taken a newspaper and
[5:35] tacky buttons how many knows what a
[5:37] tacky button is there's no kyans here
[5:40] then it's take a piece of cardboard put
[5:43] a thumb tack in a little spring and then
[5:45] push it in the that's a tacky button so
[5:48] they had put it all over and he went up
[5:49] there to the Ironworks and got him uh
[5:52] some stuff and made a step to come up
[5:56] and got some old boxes and had him a
[5:57] table and I thought one day I'll go down
[6:00] and see how they're getting
[6:03] along about 6 months before that I
[6:05] married e Knight's daughter the E slider
[6:09] son even night one of the richest man
[6:12] there is on the high river and um you
[6:15] all runs the great factories through
[6:17] there making these prefab houses and so
[6:20] forth and and slider is ET slider is a
[6:25] sand and gravel company millionaires
[6:27] children and um had married him and I
[6:31] went back in a place practiced it for
[6:33] about two weeks and going back in a
[6:36] booth and leading on a pillow and all
[6:38] the pump and everything I ever went
[6:40] through nearly had to go through to
[6:42] marry that couple and when come out
[6:45] while they were this other little couple
[6:47] just stood there in a little old room
[6:48] where we had a a little couch and a
[6:50] folded bed but they both was married by
[6:53] the same
[6:54] ceremony and then one day I thought I'd
[6:56] go down and visit this Rich couple they
[6:59] didn't have to work their fathers are
[7:01] millionaires they build them a nice home
[7:03] frankly this eeve night up there on the
[7:05] hill is door knobs are 14 karat on his
[7:08] big Palace so uh you can imagine what
[7:11] kind of home they live in they didn't
[7:13] have to work they had a nice Cadillac
[7:14] give to them every year and just only
[7:17] children and they had just everything
[7:19] they wanted when I walked up one day and
[7:21] now how I got acquainted with them one
[7:23] of their friends was a good friend of
[7:25] mine we all kind of chum together and
[7:27] that's how I got acquainted when they
[7:28] wanted me to marry him so um I went up
[7:31] to visit him and I got outside old Ford
[7:35] outside walked up the steps and and I
[7:39] got up a little bit too close and I
[7:41] heard them and they were really
[7:44] fussing they were jealous of one another
[7:47] they'd been to a dance she was a very
[7:49] pretty
[7:50] girl and she was kind of one of these uh
[7:55] beauty queens she Tu many prizes around
[7:58] there and won some cars and things for
[8:00] being beauty queen and I looked at him
[8:03] and one was sitting in one corner and
[8:05] one the other fussing about some boy she
[8:08] had danced with her some girl something
[8:11] when I come up they jumped up real quick
[8:13] and grabbed one another across the floor
[8:15] and their hands across the floor come
[8:16] walk nor towards your door said but
[8:18] hello there brother Brandon how are you
[8:21] getting along I said all right how you
[8:24] all getting long and oh he said I we're
[8:29] very happy aren't we honey and she said
[8:32] yes de now I see you're putting on
[8:36] something that isn't real now you can't
[8:39] get warmed by a painted fire like some
[8:42] of these churches trying to paint
[8:43] Pentecost or something happened a
[8:45] thousand years ago or 2,000 years ago
[8:47] you can't get warmed by a painted
[8:49] fire a Pentecost is just as real today
[8:52] as it was then the fire is still falling
[8:55] it ain't a painted fire it's a real fire
[8:58] so uh they just there they was see I I
[9:01] wouldn't want to live like that well I
[9:03] thought you know just down over the
[9:05] cliff there and over on the river and
[9:08] there's where this other couple wound up
[9:12] I thought one Saturday afternoon I'd
[9:13] slip down there and see how they is
[9:15] getting along so I'm dirty on the face
[9:18] and dirty overhauls on my tools on I
[9:21] thought I slip up on them and I slipped
[9:24] along like I was watching for insulators
[9:26] being cracked by the lightning or
[9:27] something as I walked along side of the
[9:30] telephone wire the electric cables along
[9:33] the
[9:33] river and there the old chevret was
[9:36] setting out front about a year later
[9:39] after I'd married him and there was uh
[9:42] uh the door was open and I could hear
[9:44] him talking so this sound sounds like a
[9:47] hypocrite but I walked up close enough
[9:49] that I could listen see what they saying
[9:52] St there and I just want to know for
[9:54] myself I like to find out be sure I know
[9:56] what I'm talking about that's what I do
[9:58] about God's word word is it the truth or
[10:00] isn't it the truth will he keep his word
[10:02] or doesn't he keep his word if he
[10:04] doesn't keep his word then he's not God
[10:06] see he does keep his word he's
[10:08] God and so I wanted to see how they was
[10:11] getting long and I slipped along the
[10:13] side real easy I heard him say Well
[10:16] honey I wanted to get that for you so
[10:19] bad she said now look sweetheart she
[10:22] said this dress is all right she said
[10:25] Well I this is just fine said I
[10:27] appreciate that but you see I slipped
[10:29] around so I could look at through the
[10:30] crack where the door been shoved open
[10:33] there in the Box Car and there he was
[10:36] sitting in there and her on his
[10:40] lap and his arm around her and her arm
[10:44] around him and he had one of these old
[10:47] slouch hats and and put a little hole
[10:50] mashed it down the top and poured out
[10:52] his paycheck and that he he was laying
[10:55] it out on the table said so much for
[10:57] groceries so much for ins insurance and
[11:00] so much uh on the car and they couldn't
[11:03] make their ends meet come to find out
[11:05] he'd seen a little dress up there in the
[11:07] window he' been looking at it for a
[11:08] couple weeks that cost a dollar and
[11:10] something he wanted to get he said well
[11:12] honey it looks so pretty in it and he
[11:15] said she said but honey I I got a dress
[11:17] I I don't really need it see and that
[11:20] little
[11:21] queen and I backed off and looked back I
[11:26] could see the the steeple on top of the
[11:28] other house
[11:30] I stood there and looked a few
[11:33] minutes I thought who is the rich
[11:37] man I thought if Bill brandom if you
[11:41] want to take which place where would you
[11:44] go for me I take not the that pretty
[11:48] thing up on top the hill but I take this
[11:50] character down here as a real
[11:53] homaker somebody that loved me and
[11:56] stayed with me somebody tried to make a
[11:59] home and not bleeding for everything for
[12:01] fine reasons somebody that was with you
[12:05] part of you that's always stuck with me
[12:08] of how that was one chose a beautiful
[12:11] girl the other chose
[12:14] character now that's the only way you
[12:16] can choose first look for character and
[12:19] then if you love her
