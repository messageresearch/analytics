[1:42] bunch of people off the river and around
[1:44] like
[1:44] that I said that right said yes said God
[1:49] sent that Ministry to hit the nerve
[1:50] spots the big spots the highlights I
[1:53] seen the devil talking right then I
[1:55] thought
[1:57] yeah jump out off this mountain and show
[1:59] you know Office
[2:00] Buildings I thought this lead him out a
[2:02] little far my old mother used to say
[2:04] give the cow enough rope she'll hang her
[2:06] on S I said is that right yes said it's
[2:09] a shame but what you do said what are
[2:11] you today you can hardly buy yourself a
[2:14] meal and said look at Oral Roberts them
[2:17] stepped in and got out there with the
[2:20] 100th of the ministry you got and look

[2:25] see and he said my group will take you
[2:28] we'll take you right in as as one of our
[2:30] Brethren they'll all give you the right
[2:31] hand of fellowship and we'll Charter a
[2:33] plane and give you wages of 500 a week
[2:36] or more if you want it and we'll send
[2:38] you to every major city in the country
[2:39] this happened right in Phoenix Arizona
[2:41] right across the table and he said and
[2:43] we'll pay your said then let the world
[2:46] the outside
[2:47] world let the dignitaries the big guys
[2:50] the up and up so you're always talking
[2:52] about the down and out the got the up
[2:54] and outs so let them see the hand of the
[2:56] Lord and I take my wife along and others
[2:59] can prove Pro that those things that you
[3:00] say comes to pass I said yes sir that'
[3:03] be great I see the man in the position
[3:06] of a DL LD a writer of Books see doctor
[3:11] of literature fine writer fine man see
[3:15] he didn't know the scripture did you
[3:18] know that angel that performed them kind
[3:20] of works never did go to Sodom he stayed
[3:23] with the called out group
[3:25] Abraham he just didn't know it I just
[3:28] let him alone sat there a little bit I
[3:31] just wanted to see what the catch was
[3:33] now I said well uh uh what would I have
[3:36] to do said well brother brand just the
[3:38] only thing they said we discussed it a
[3:40] few things little petty things that you
[3:42] teach it you just lay them aside I said
[3:45] for instance what
[3:48] brother all he said you're baptism you
[3:50] know you know you kind of baptized like
[3:52] the one that's something like that and
[3:53] said little things like that I said oh I
[3:56] went ahead and he said the initial
[3:58] evidence when preachers and just a few
[4:01] little things like that I said
[4:03] uhhuh I said you know I'm surprised that
[4:06] one servant of God would ask another
[4:08] servant of God after paying the tribute
[4:10] to me you did and calling me a
[4:12] prophet and knowing that the word of the
[4:15] lord of the revelation of the word comes
[4:17] to the prophet and you turn around Dr
[4:20] pulp it don't speak of your good
[4:22] intelligence and would say and ask one
[4:25] servant of God you asked another servant
[4:27] of God to compromise on the thing that
[4:29] it means more to him in life
[4:33] itself I said no sir brother po by no
[4:38] means what I do it no sir what is it
[4:41] there a grain of eternal life live or
[4:44] die whether you're a great guy or not a
[4:46] great guy I passed by other day no
[4:47] disregards to these two men I looked
[4:49] over there and there was a great picture
[4:51] there at Tulsa Oklahoma old Roberts new

[5:00] Caren brother Carl Williams and them
[5:01] that are on the Board of Trustees of $50
[5:05] million with a three million dollar
[5:08] billing a Pentecostal boy that's a great
[5:10] lot that God has done for him I think me
[5:13] with the Seminary I'm against it to
[5:16] begin with and I said the future home of
[5:19] or Roberts great Seminary went on down
[5:22] the road there was a great modern thing
[5:25] and old Roberts in a little ragged tent
