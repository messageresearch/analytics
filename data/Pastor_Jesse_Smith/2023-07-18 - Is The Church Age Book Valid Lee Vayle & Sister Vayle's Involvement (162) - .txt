TRANSCRIPT
========================================
greetings friends in the mattress name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to answer the question is the church age book valid should followers of William branham's bible-based message read preach from and Trust the exposition of the seven Church ages published in December 1965. my answer to this question is yes followers of William branham's bible-based message should use appreciate and glean Bible revelations from the Holy Spirit through reading the church age book this video contains three reasons why I believe the church age book is valid and I'll also cover Lee Vale and sister veil's involvement with the church age book according to brother Ram's own words so we'll begin with the three reasons I believe the church age book is valid reason number one brother Branham called The Church age book his own book at least nine times and he said he wrote it by the leading of the Lord I'm going to give the quotes for these reasons in chronological order the first quote is from the revelation of Jesus Christ December 4th 1960 well the brand said we're going to write a commentary to send to all the world brother Brown said after the last election when JFK was elected he said the Holy Spirit began to reveal to him to warn the people and to place this book so notice the Holy Spirit revealed to him to warn the People by making a book about the seven Church ages let's listen to the quote behind us from the Magnetic Tape we're going to write a commentary on the seven Church ages to stand to all the world that we can because we are in the last day we are at the end time never dawned upon my heart so much until the the last election and then I seen where we were at and the Holy Spirit began to reveal to me to to warn the people and to place this and I cannot do it in a church like this sufficiently and then if I sit down and just wrote the book I feel that if I got to the pulpit and the inspiration of the Holy Spirit amongst the Christians came up on me to help me then I would be more sufficient to write the book then after I took it off the tape because there we'd get the inspiration of it the next quote is from the laodicean church age December 11 1960 brother Ram said he felt led of the Lord to do two things one of them was go to Jeffersonville and write the church age book he said quote then I said I must go to Jeffersonville and write this book end quote and he said in the name of the Lord he did not know the inspiration of the seven Church ages until he sat down and studied it and preached it let's listen to the quote then I said I must go to Jeffersonville and write this book because I don't know how much longer I've got to be here but if I express this and it goes on writing After I'm Gone the words will live on yes I've got the history roll down which I'll go in the book and I'll come here to bring it before the church to find the inspiration of the holy spirit because I didn't know these things myself that's true that's in the name of the Lord that's true I did not notice third quote is from the Third Exodus June 30th 1960 brother random said I'm trying now to get it proofread and make books out of it of the church ages so notice he said I'm trying to get the church age book proofread and make books of it and brother Branham again validates the church age book by saying quote then if the Lord tarries and I move on you'll see that the things I've said in the name of the Lord will be come to pass just as it was said never has failed yet and some of it has to happen later end quote of course this statement goes along with the seven major Visions from 1933 and also the thus saith the Lord's statement brother Brandon said about Joel 2 verses 23-26 which says the fullness of Pentecost will be in the bride right before the time of the Rapture let's listen to the quote and then besides that I'm trying now to get it proof read and make books out of it uh Church ages seven books of the church age seven tapes and make it in sets we get it done just as cheap as we possibly can so everybody can get it then if the Lord tarries and move on you'll see that the things I've said in the name of the Lord will be come to pass just as it was said never has failed yet and some of it has to happen later the next quote is from Harvest Time December 12 1964. brother Branham said I'm writing a book and notice he calls it my commentary that's a literal quote now I'm writing a book my commentary now friends it's sad some preachers will say brother branham's Church age book or brother random sermons are not commentary and yet brother Branham says the opposite he says his sermons and writing about the church Ages was his commentary so there's nothing wrong with saying the church age book is brother Adam's commentary because the beautiful part is a lot of it we know was spoken with thus saith the Lord a lot of the symbols and meanings from Revelation chapters one two and three were given to us from Brother Branham with thus saith the Lord let's listen to the quote I'm Ronnie Roddy Kerry on the large oh no I have a brochure of each Church age next from why I had to be Shepherds 1964 December 21st brother Ram said I am writing a book of it let's listen to the quote those seven Mysteries back through those seven Church ages there were seven hidden mysteries I'm writing a book of it in a great Theologian said to me now August said brother Branham see how Satan will try to jerky off a road he said brother random you know what I believe the Lord will reveal to you what we're to do next is to you'll be some great secret is here and there are these Seven Seals the next quote is from who do you say this is December 27 1964 brother Branham calls the church age book a special book and he said I got a special book coming out let's listen to the quote this lady will see a church age would be I got a special book coming out on it pretty soon the Lord willing see this lady you see it is show that it's already over she's already sealed in there and she Christ is on the outside the next quote was from birth pains January 24th 65. brother Ram said I've got coming a book the commentary of the first four chapters of Revelation so again he says I've got a book coming out and the second time he calls it a commentary so it's sad preachers say the church age book or brother bam sermons were not commentaries of course they were brother Ram sermons were not scripture they were a prophet's commentary on the scripture and many of those comments were spoken with thus saith the Lord which we rejoice in let's listen to the quote from birth pains I've got coming to book out on that the commentary of the first four chapters of Revelations read it as soon as we get it all prayers and it proves the honors shattered doubt what Luther's message was justification one uh sanctification is the next process in the natural birth and then come to Pentecostals exactly the next quote is from in knoweth and not 1965 August 15th brother Ram said I've got the church age coming forth now in the books so again he says it's his church age book let's listen to the quote of course I've got the church age for now in the in the ladies see on Church age that we're in let's just look at the conditions the next quote was from November 27 1965. brother bran said Gordon Lindsay was printing my book so here he calls it my book just one week before the book came out let's listen to the quote doing a great job printing he's printing my book now the uh the seven Church ages and the last quote is from leadership December 7th 1965. if I'm not mistaken this is the second to last sermon brother Branham ever preached I believe communion was his last sermon and brother random called it quote my writing of the church Ages end quote so here's the ninth time brother Branham called the book his writing let's listen to the quote about my writing of the church ages moving on to the second reason I believe the church age book is valid the reason is because nearly all of the content in the book is biblically accurate and very important and for that reason I made a quick reference sheet on the important doctrinal teachings brother Branham gave us in the church age book as some of you may know who follow my channel I recently put out a video called The Church age book two mistakes I found and three additions to brother Rams tapes it's video number 158 and this addresses the few mistakes and additions to the church age book and yet it's a very special book as brother Brandon said so the church age book in my opinion is the same as brother Branham sermons brother random said there's Mix-Ups on the tapes brother Brandon said sometimes there are seeds in the Cherry Pie he says if you ever hit a seed in the Cherry Pie just spit out the seed but keep eating cherry pie that's what any True Believer will do they'll enjoy all the wonderful Bible revelations brother random preached and when brother Branham makes human mistakes or makes human opinions that are not in the Bible we just spit those out and we accept all the great cherry pie all the great Bible teachings brother Adam gave us the Bible way to describe this is not Cherry Pie and cherry pits or cherry seeds the Bible way to describes this the Bible way to describe this is called rightly dividing the word of truth that's found in second Timothy 2 verse 15. study to shoe thyself approved unto God a Workman that needeth not to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of Truth here's a screenshot of my church age book quick reference topical sheet it's got 13 references to 13 important doctrines or sections from the church age book the first is on the importance of receiving genuine Revelation from God begins on page 12 ends on page 17. the second is the true Sabbath and the Lord's Day from Pages 43 to 48 the third section is the godhead and water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ there's actually six sections in the book that talk about these two important subjects the next subject is Christ is the Tree of Life followed by the serpent seed teaching from Pages 97 to 107. the next section is torment in the Lake of Fire does not last eternally since Sinners do not possess eternal life so the non-eternal hell teaching is found on pages 131 to 139 the true baptism of the Holy Ghost and the fact tongues are not the initial evidence of receiving the Holy Ghost are found in three sections in the book the next section is God's election of each True Believer and the elected members of the Bride of Jesus Christ from Pages 148 to 157 the seven spirits of God refers to the holy spirit's continuous Ministry in the lives of seven men The Book of Life the seven major visions of 1933 the end time Prophet sent to this laodicean church age and lastly a resume of all the church ages a brief overview of each age two quotes about the important content of this book are both from 1965 the first quotes from trying to do God of service without it being God's Will from November 27 1965 brother random said you all seen in my book it'll all be drawed out in the seven Church Ages which he told me which I stand by as a witness to God to be judged at the day of judgment for it it come from God not from my thinking end quote so friends this is a powerful statement brother I'm speaking of the drawing of the seven Church ages now each age had a certain portion of truth that brother Brandon Drew on the chalkboard and then the Holy Spirit made those light and shadows those same seven circles of the church ages and manifested those lights on the back wall of random Tabernacle and there were numerous Witnesses of this event and some of them made testimonies about it but notice again brother Brandon said I'll be judged by God for the teaching that had come from God that's a powerful statement to make and so that's one more reason we can trust the content in the church age book let's listen to the quote which he told me which I stand by as a witness to God to be judges to their judgment for it it come from God not from my thinking the second quote is from the Rapture December 4th 1965. brother Ram said the church Ages were drawn by the Holy Spirit and now we're drawn in his book so again this quote shows how God himself validated the scriptural truce and content in the church age book by coming down himself in the form of the pillar fire and putting the lights and shadows on the back wall of random Tabernacle and of course there's a recording on that as well so let's listen to the quote from the Rapture and then we'll hear the recording from the pillar Fire coming down in 1961. I had him drawn out on the board up there Church Ages which we draw it out in the book and if that Holy Spirit didn't come down in a big pillar afar and went right back on that wall and draw them out himself uh three or four hundred people sitting looking at it now look this way y'all now that's just like it is when it comes on the glory here Steve [Music] it's just it's just a reflection just a reflection that is it's not the right here's the light hanging right here I hear this woman I just had to catch it I thought it was over somebody [Music] now you're seeing what I'm seeing too one of them is the natural the other is the supernatural there's a man sitting on the outside here on the list nine looking over towards that light struck him he's from Seymour Indiana and he's got I had a stroke if you'll believe sir God will heal you that's broken amen the third reason I believe the church age book is valid is that brother Brandon put a lot of emphasis on the book and I want to share two quotes about that the first quote is from scriptural signs of the time April 10th 1964. brother random calls the picture of the seven Church ages an astounding picture and again testified about the moment when the pillar fire came down in the Branham Tabernacle to vindicate that that drawing was from god let's listen to the quote you have astounding picture there tonight's going in that book uh three years how the Lord be drawn out on a Blackboard and show just how the church ages of failed and when and how they would go up and down and as soon as that was finished that great Angel of the Lord that light before practice many people sit here come right on the side of the wall or stand there at people fainting and draw it right out with itself on the wall and the second quote was from the anointed ones at the end time July 25th 1965 brother Brandon makes an astounding statement here he said wait till you get the book The Church age book you'll understand it if you just got any light in you and he was referring to the topic or the doctrine of the book of life I just think that's an important statement a tremendous statement brother Brandon said if you have any light of God in you you'll understand the Book of Life After reading the church age book and all message believers who are born again or have any light of God in them can say a wonderful Amen to that let's listen to the quote moving on to the final section let's look at Lee Veil and sister vale's involvement in the book and this also includes proof brother Branham reviewed Lee vale's work at least a couple of times meaning brother Branham knew the content that was in the book the first quotes from the future home August 2nd 1964. brother Brandon said brother Vale and those are working upon those now Faithfully to get them in book form let's listen to the quote the veil and those are working upon those now Faithfully to get them in book form the next quote is from questions and answers part two August 23 1964 this is one of two quotes where brother Brandon mentioned sister Vale involved in the church age book he just says oh God help brother Vale and sister Veil let's listen to the quote you're riding putting every word that I say down try oh God help brother Vale and sister avail here's the second quote about sister Vale it's from a shame 1965 July 11th brother Brandon was asking his congregation if any had read brother vale's rewriting or grammarizing of the church age book two or three of them did in the congregation and brother Brown compliments Lee Bailey said I think you've done a real job brother Vale a real job and then he said sister Vail I think sister Vale did it and you just wrote it down and she done it let's listen to the quote for me have you read any of it yeah I think you've done a real job brother Bill real job dude I think sister Vale did it you just uh wrote an answer regarding sister vale's involvement a wonderful Minister asked me a couple years ago about sister avails involvement in the church age book and this lovely Minister this wonderful brother does not use the church age book and my reply was yes I see there's two quotes about sister Veil doing some work related to the church age book but I have nine quotes of brother Brandon saying it was his book and there are two quotes after this sister Veil quote where brother random calls the book his own and that's where brother Brown said Gordon Lindsay's printing my book and he said quote my writing of the church Ages end quote so my conclusion is that brother Branham considered the book his own because he preached it and he got the Revelation and inspiration from the Holy Spirit to preach the series on the seven Church ages but then somehow brother and sister Vale were doing some sort of work on it nothing doctrinal it seems it seems brother random said brother Vale and sister Vale were just adding grammar to it which is evident there's words in the church age book that we never hear Brother random sang so I think most people will come to the conclusion that brother Vale and sister Vale did not write the church age book next let's look at a quote from doors indoor from February 6 1965. brother Brandon said quote my tapes end quote were sent to brother Vale to grammarize them and then here's where brother Branham says it went through a few revisions back and forth a couple times I love this quote because brother random says himself he revised the church age book a couple times he looked at leeville's work at least a couple times and revised it and then approved that it would be sent to the printer for printing and it even came out during his lifetime let's listen to the quote am I types of the seven Church ages I sent them to him to grammarize him because My Old Kentucky hit hate and Toten carry and fetched that don't go good for people who read this book so he was going to grammarize it for I mean then after he got through sent it back a couple times for more statements but your book is going to press now after about three four years next from Christ is revealed in his own word August 22nd 1965 regarding Lee Vale brother Brandon said levale is the writer of the books Lauren said he's getting the book ready now the seven Church ages and working with the Seven Seals now of course we don't want to misunderstand this quote and give leave ale the credit for the church age book because then we'd have to do away the nine other quotes where Bella Graham said this was his book so of course brother Branham is referring to leevail editing the books and fixing the grammar let's listen to the quote well Bale is our brother here a writer of the books and he's getting the book ready now the seven Church ages and working with the Seven Seals and we'll soon hope to have him out pretty soon the final quote is from a man running from the presence of the Lord February 17 1965. brother Brown said the seven Church age book has answers to a lot of questions that's been in the people's hearts and he said brother Vale kind of helped him with this and would glamorize to keep the line of the same thought and give him help with grammar so again I think this is proof that brother Lee Vale and sister Vale did not write the church age book they grammarized the book they edited the book and they did their best to keep the same line of thought the same Revelation that God had revealed to brother Branham during the seven Church age sermons let's listen to the quote so I got brother Vale to kind of help me with this and keep the line of the same thought and give it grammar and I'm sure I might remember it would be a mystery to him sure enough so uh the brother of veil is really good on that so he's as a in closing friends I hope this video was a help to prove to you the validity of the seven Church age book again I love this book since I became a message believer it's the first book I read after I came in the message it's laid the foundation for my teaching and pastoring Ministry I love the church age book if you want a free copy of the PDF of my church age book quick reference sheet please let me know I'll be happy to share that with you as always friends if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me by email God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
