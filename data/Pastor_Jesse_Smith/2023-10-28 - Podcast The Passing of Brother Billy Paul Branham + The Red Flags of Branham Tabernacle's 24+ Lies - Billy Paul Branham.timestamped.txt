[0:08] God bless you and welcome to the
[0:10] defending the message podcast I'm your
[0:12] host Pastor Jesse Smith in today's
[0:14] podcast I'm going to answer a question I
[0:17] received from a viewer from El Salvador
[0:21] who asked me about the recent passing of
[0:24] brother Billy Paul Branham and my goal
[0:27] is to answer this brother's question and
[0:29] talk about brother Billy Paul's life
[0:30] with as much grace and brotherly
[0:32] kindness as possible and as anyone who
[0:35] follows my Ministry knows I've had to
[0:37] take a stance against brandham
[0:39] Tabernacle because of the 24 plus lies
[0:42] that they are propagating and sharing
[0:44] worldwide with millions of people
[0:47] promoting a false message and I believe
[0:50] preaching another Jesus and so to answer
[0:52] the brother's question I have to share
[0:55] where I differ with my precious brother
[0:57] the late brother Billy Paul brandham and
[1:00] I use that same terminology that brother
[1:01] brandham used brother brandham said
[1:03] here's where I differ with my precious
[1:05] brother Uriah Smith who had already
[1:08] passed away that's the terminology
[1:10] brother brandom used in the fist seal in
[1:12] 1963 regarding his differences with URI
[1:15] Smith so by God's grace we'll look at
[1:17] the positives with the late brother
[1:20] Billy Paul brandham and then we'll look
[1:22] at the red flags or the concerns
[1:23] surrounding brandham Tabernacle and of
[1:26] course Billy Paul brandham and Joseph
[1:28] Brenham remember remember friends we are
[1:30] commanded to try every Spirit according
[1:32] to 1 John 4:1 we're called to prove all
[1:36] things according to 1 Thessalonians 521
[1:39] and we're told to be ready always to
[1:40] give an answer for the hope within us
[1:42] according to 1 Peter
[1:49] 3:15 so let's begin with the positives
[1:51] here by God's grace uh we're thankful
[1:54] that brother Billy Paul helped brother
[1:56] brandom in the prayer lines in many many
[1:58] meetings and over the years I've heard
[2:02] some people say that they had
[2:04] testimonies of healings after brother
[2:06] Billy Paul had prayed for them so if
[2:09] those are genuine then I rejoice in that
[2:12] it seems brother Billy Paul wrote many
[2:14] kind letters to people and tried to
[2:17] answer lots of questions and he seemed
[2:19] to pray for the prayer requests that
[2:20] people sent to him whether through
[2:22] letter or email and when I wrote to
[2:24] Billy Paul in
[2:26] 2020 I thanked him for the help he had
[2:28] in spreading brother bram's bible
[2:30] message and I specifically pointed out
[2:33] bible message because the Bible was
[2:35] brother brandom's absolute the tapes
[2:38] were not brother brandom's absolute so
[2:40] to whatever small degree brother Billy
[2:42] Paul helped spread the bible message I
[2:45] thanked him for that and of course Billy
[2:47] Paul testified to seeing the angel of
[2:49] the Lord which seeing the angel of the
[2:51] Lord is a wonderful testimony but we got
[2:53] to be careful not to take that too far
[2:55] friends as we know balum also saw the
[2:58] angel of the Lord Judas es scariot lived
[3:01] and ministered with the Lord Jesus for
[3:03] three and a half years and Cain talked
[3:07] plainly with God heard the voice of God
[3:09] and yet left the presence of God but
[3:11] again we are thankful for brother Billy
[3:13] Paul helping brother brandham in the
[3:14] meetings and then he was privileged to
[3:16] see the angel of the
[3:22] Lord now getting into the concerns or
[3:25] red flags is another way I describe it
[3:28] the red flag surrounding br Tabernacle
[3:30] and of course the late Billy Paul
[3:32] brandham and the current Pastor Joseph
[3:34] brandham you know over the years for
[3:36] each person that I've had doctrinal
[3:39] concerns with I've just made a list of
[3:42] red flags or concerns with them uh
[3:45] Wikipedia says a red flag is like a
[3:48] warning like you'll see red flags at
[3:50] beaches when there's dangerous weather
[3:52] conditions in auto racing they put up a
[3:55] red flag when a race has been stopped so
[3:58] over the years I've used that
[3:59] terminology
[4:00] I have red flags about certain people's
[4:02] Ministries and one example is when I
[4:05] just come in the message I was attending
[4:08] a church in Lima
[4:10] Ohio and there was another church in the
[4:13] city that was much larger much more
[4:15] popular but I had many red flags about
[4:18] that Pastor I think I had written down
[4:21] five or six red flags for example the
[4:24] pastor allowed the women to cut their
[4:25] hair to trim them to wear makeup but not
[4:28] make it very noticeable he had told the
[4:31] parents they could let their children
[4:32] listen to rock and roll as long as they
[4:34] had headphones on he had the false
[4:36] Doctrine about the baptism of the Holy
[4:38] Ghost saying you could have the Holy
[4:40] Ghost just by reading a paper and trying
[4:43] to become saved which is basically
[4:46] misinterpreting the quote about baptism
[4:48] of the Holy Ghost without
[4:50] sensation then friend sure enough after
[4:52] all these five or six red flags this
[4:54] pastor left the message and now attacks
[4:56] brother brandham and that situation
[4:58] taught me to make a list of red flags
[5:00] about Ministries and so that's what I've
[5:03] done of course with brandom Tabernacle
[5:04] so as you've saw this year if you follow
[5:07] my Ministry we have over 24 red flags
[5:09] about brandham Tabernacle and friends
[5:12] again we're commanded to do this it's
[5:14] not an easy thing to do it's not a fun
[5:16] thing to do uh but remember 1
[5:18] Corinthians 11: 19 there must also be
[5:21] heresies among you that they which are
[5:23] approved may be made manifest among you
[5:26] I try to encourage people when there's
[5:27] problems in the church try try not to be
[5:30] discouraged but just try to stand with
[5:32] the truth with as much love as possible
[5:34] these heresies must happen so that the
[5:36] True Believers can be manifested so
[5:39] let's look at some concerns of red flags
[5:40] I had about brother Billy Paul and of
[5:43] course brandham Tabernacle so back in
[5:45] 2020 I sent a letter the same letter to
[5:48] Joseph brandham and Billy Paul and in
[5:50] the letter I thank them for their
[5:52] service to try to spread the bible
[5:54] message of their father but I said I
[5:58] felt they had at least five false
[5:59] doctrines now of course this number has
[6:01] grown to 24 but in that letter I brought
[6:04] out five uh Billy Paul wrote me right
[6:07] back so did Joseph um but Billy Paul was
[6:10] very kind but he did not address any of
[6:12] the five false doctrines he just said he
[6:13] was going on vacation and he would pray
[6:16] for me and he appreciated my Christian
[6:19] Spirit if anybody wants a copy of that
[6:22] letter let me know I can email it to you
[6:24] um Joseph wrote me right back and gave
[6:27] me all these quotes to show where he
[6:29] stood so he basically doubled down on
[6:30] his false doctrines and never repented
[6:33] of anything so I also even made them a
[6:35] private YouTube video was about 18
[6:37] minutes long I think and there was views
[6:40] on it I shared the links with them but
[6:42] again they never showed any repentance
[6:44] for these false
[6:46] doctrines also back in March of this
[6:48] year 2023 I made a video when will Los
[6:51] Angeles sink at the end of that video I
[6:54] addressed the story that Billy Paul
[6:55] brandham often told about how he said he
[6:58] was standing with his father in Los
[7:00] Angeles and supposedly brother brandom
[7:02] said you'll not be an old man when
[7:03] sharks will be swimming here and of
[7:06] course this quote is not on tape but
[7:08] Billy Paul has shared that around the
[7:09] world since his father's passing and it
[7:12] has caused many people to look at Billy
[7:14] Paul as a sign of when the Rapture might
[7:16] take place and now that Billy Paul's
[7:18] dead some people that believe that story
[7:21] from Billy Paul or put a lot of weight
[7:22] on that story from Billy Paul are maybe
[7:24] now concerned or trying to make a new
[7:26] meaning for what brother Brandon may
[7:28] have meant but in that video I put out
[7:30] in March I said I do not put a lot of
[7:33] weight on Billy Paul's testimony because
[7:35] of all the red flags in his life and
[7:37] because the story is not on tape so as I
[7:40] told our home Church we've been proven
[7:42] true now that Billy Paul's passed and
[7:44] Los Angeles still hasn't sunk and I
[7:47] remember even from that video brother
[7:48] brandom called himself an old man when
[7:50] he was 55 and 56 so Billy Paul was Far
[7:52] Beyond an old man at least according to
[7:55] brother bram's own definition of an old
[7:56] man Billy Paul was 88 if I'm not
[7:58] mistaken when he passed last week so I
[8:01] want to share a few more red flags I've
[8:03] had about Billy Paul's testimony
[8:05] remember friends uh Billy Paul was
[8:07] married twice which means he was an
[8:09] adulterer and brother Bram said this
[8:10] repeatedly on the tapes I'm not
[8:12] condemning him for being an adulterer
[8:15] but I'm reminding some people who may
[8:16] have forgotten of the choices that Billy
[8:19] Paul made when he was a young man and in
[8:21] 1964 questions and answers part two
[8:24] brother Brandon was asked if adulterers
[8:26] could go in the Rapture and he said
[8:27] quote there might be a chance end quote
[8:30] of them quote getting in end quote in
[8:34] that same series of course brother
[8:35] Brandon mentioned how Billy Paul was an
[8:38] adulterer so we know this would apply to
[8:40] him so even in brother Ram's own words
[8:43] he didn't know if there was a chance of
[8:44] adulterers going in the Rapture he was
[8:46] just hopeful that there could be a
[8:48] chance so we got to keep that in mind
[8:51] brother Brandon if a man has been
[8:53] married and divorced isn't that awful
[8:56] see so many I'm not saying nothing
[8:58] against the people just that's on the
[9:00] people's mind sure they're troubled
[9:03] the're Rapture people used not think so
[9:04] much about that it wasn't so much of it
[9:07] but now it's just plastered the world
[9:09] how can both or one of them be in the
[9:13] Rapture I don't
[9:15] know I couldn't tell you the question is
[9:18] can they be in the Rapture divorced each
[9:21] one of them divorced each one of them
[9:22] has a living companion then they married
[9:24] again both of them married again and now
[9:26] one this woman has a living husband this
[9:28] man has a living wife and now they've
[9:30] got children and so forth and want to
[9:32] come to God can they go in the Rapture
[9:34] that'll be up to the heavenly father I
[9:36] couldn't answer that see I I saw one
[9:39] thing the Bible said that they shall be
[9:41] called an adulterer and the Bible said
[9:43] also an adulterer will not enter the
[9:45] Kingdom of Heaven that's all I can say I
[9:48] I know that just kills me to say that
[9:49] but I can't say but what the word say
[9:52] I'm going stay with that I hope that
[9:53] it's all wrong let's see there might be
[9:56] a chance of you getting in don't make
[9:59] two wrongs will never right in one just
[10:01] go to live the way you are if you're if
[10:03] you're happy together you might had the
[10:05] wrong companion I'll say this one thing
[10:08] if you got the wrong companion in this
[10:09] wife this life you'll never have it in
[10:12] the other one all wrongs will be made
[10:15] right I don't the question is asked the
[10:17] other day was a a norment a
[10:21] norment a norment the same as a
[10:26] divorce see when you ask me those
[10:28] questions friends you don't know what
[10:30] that does to me I've got many friends
[10:32] sitting here married two or three times
[10:35] did you realize I'm talking to my own
[10:37] son Billy Paul but I spare Billy Paul no
[10:41] indeed Billy Paul got married to some
[10:44] little girl and he come up and said
[10:45] Daddy I'm going to get married I was
[10:47] wash my car I said butt your head
[10:48] against the wall just kept on uh washing
[10:50] my car like that he said I'm going to
[10:51] get married I said oh go on just kept on
[10:53] like that he goes around tell his mother
[10:55] and his mother laughed at him you know
[10:56] what he done run off with some little
[10:58] kid still in common school and got
[11:00] married we an knowed the wedding the
[11:03] Father the girl and myself we an knowed
[11:05] the wedding but he was married just the
[11:07] same he's my boy s you're listening at
[11:09] me now that's exactly he come to me with
[11:11] the girl he lives with now my
[11:14] daughter-in-law my little grandson he
[11:16] said Daddy will you marry me I said by
[11:17] no means that's my own son you think
[11:20] that don't cut me to the core when I
[11:22] packed him in my arms and done
[11:24] everything I could do and I've been both
[11:25] father and mother to him you think that
[11:26] don't kill me to say that but it's the
[11:28] truth
[11:31] certainly my boy sitting here listening
[11:33] at my daughter-in-law and my little
[11:35] grandson sitting right here now but I
[11:37] tell him it's
[11:39] wrong because I've got to I'm Duty bound
[11:41] to that
[11:43] word not be a hypocrit if I stood here
[11:46] because my own son sitting here that was
[11:48] promised to a girl I said if he never
[11:50] even had the ceremony set over him no
[11:52] matter if he ever lived with the woman
[11:53] or slept with the girl or whatever it
[11:55] was when he made that bow he's married
[11:58] amen Billy Paul or no Billy Paul that's
[12:01] exactly the truth he's married when he
[12:03] made that promise it's me it's the
[12:06] same we've got to be
[12:08] honest if I can't be honest with my boy
[12:11] I can't be honest with you if I ain't
[12:13] honest with you I won't be honest with
[12:15] God and I want you to believe what I
[12:18] tell you to be my honest to goodness
[12:20] opinion don't make anything else out of
[12:22] it just say it the way I said it see CU
[12:24] I'm going tell you the
[12:26] truth secondly I don't know how God will
[12:29] judge these people like Billy Paul and
[12:31] Joseph who promote or promoted idolatry
[12:34] by saying every word on tape is thus say
[12:37] the Lord they also say there's no
[12:39] mistakes on the tapes and of course
[12:40] brother B has quotes on the other side
[12:43] of both of these
[12:45] statements I hope Billy Paul repented
[12:48] before he passed we prayed for that at
[12:50] our church actually I want Mercy for
[12:53] Billy Paul and Joseph as we know God is
[12:56] a god of Mercy but friends we have to
[12:58] think
[12:59] sincerely about this about the mistake
[13:01] of saying every word a man said was thus
[13:03] sayi the Lord what if someone said every
[13:06] word Peter who was a prophet or Paul
[13:08] said was thus sayi the Lord any sensible
[13:11] person would say you're crazy for saying
[13:13] that now of course the word of God the
[13:16] Epistles that they wrote were thus
[13:17] sayith the Lord but not every single
[13:19] word they ever said was thus sayith the
[13:21] Lord I've told people as well remember
[13:23] in the Old Testament the tribe of Dan
[13:26] and Ephraim were blotted out of the Book
[13:29] of Life under Heaven because of their
[13:31] idolatry so all I know is there's great
[13:33] dangers in idolizing every word on
[13:35] brother braham's tapes as Billy Paul and
[13:37] Joseph and their movement so freely does
[13:41] and I've said this before idolators are
[13:44] either lost or perhaps in God's mercy
[13:47] God could save them as foolish virgins
[13:50] and yet God in his Mercy would allow
[13:51] them to have these awful complexes of
[13:54] idolatry and tape worship but again I'm
[13:57] not sure I cannot see how a holy ghost
[14:00] filled person can promote blatant
[14:03] idolatry because idolatry is heresy
[14:06] idolatry is false Doctrine the Bible
[14:09] says only those with sound Doctrine are
[14:11] born again it's 2 John
[14:14] 1:9 the Bible says Those Who abide in
[14:16] the doctrine of Christ have both Father
[14:18] and Son and the doctrine of Christ is to
[14:21] worship only God and never idolize
[14:24] anything the Bible says in 1 Corinthians
[14:27] 10 that we're to flee idolatry
[14:29] John says it in his Epistle of First
[14:31] John keep yourselves from idols and that
[14:35] applies to me that applies to every
[14:36] person we must keep ourselves from idols
[14:38] and if I have Idols then I want God to
[14:41] convict me of those Idols so I'll repent
[14:42] of those idols and I'll be pure in his
[14:45] sight but see friends I've tried so many
[14:47] times to help Billy Paul and Joseph see
[14:50] their Idols in their lives as far as I
[14:52] know they haven't repented but I hope
[14:54] Billy Paul did repent before he passed
[14:56] on and I keep praying for for Joseph to
[14:59] repent of course and Friends one
[15:01] perspective or one red flag is that I
[15:04] see Billy Paul and Joseph as rich men
[15:06] and they're most likely living off the
[15:08] ties which should be going to local
[15:10] pastors who preach the word of God and
[15:13] feed people's souls and in their system
[15:16] Billy Paul and Joseph really had no real
[15:19] accountability like there is in a local
[15:21] church who has a pastor who preaches and
[15:24] strengthens the people feeds the people
[15:26] but also has to get the leaven out of
[15:27] his congregation
[15:29] over the years I was burdened by the red
[15:31] flags or the words that Billy Paul would
[15:33] say he would say brother Brown's
[15:35] Ministry was a oneman message which was
[15:37] basically rejecting the five full
[15:39] ministry so it was a red flag when Billy
[15:42] Paul would say one man message but then
[15:44] when he would give testimonies he would
[15:46] act like a preacher anyone who's watched
[15:48] him give his testimony would agree to
[15:50] that he looks like he's preaching he's
[15:52] acting like he's preaching and yet then
[15:54] he'll say it's a one-man message so
[15:57] that's a very sad inconsistency that I
[16:00] saw and then brother brandom even said
[16:02] Billy Paul wasn't a preacher and yet
[16:04] Billy Paul would teach false doctrines
[16:06] as I've showed one of them I showed on
[16:09] my video called the seventh and eth of
[16:11] 24 lies coming out of brandom Tabernacle
[16:13] it was video 150 where Billy Paul said
[16:17] brother Brandon was identical to Jesus
[16:19] all but the Corporal body and that was a
[16:22] great hery so you can go watch that
[16:24] video or listen to that podcast if you
[16:26] like to better understand the that awful
[16:29] seat of discrepancy that awful false
[16:32] doctrine that came out of brandom
[16:34] Tabernacle and finally friends there
[16:36] were other red flags as well our
[16:38] precious brother Billy Paul would say
[16:40] just press play and Obey and yet the
[16:42] Bible doesn't say that brother brandom
[16:44] never said that and he would also say
[16:46] this God thought it brother random said
[16:47] it I believe it that settles it these
[16:50] statements have always been red flags
[16:53] because they seemingly idolize every
[16:55] word on brother bram's tapes they take
[16:57] out discernment they take out prayer
[17:00] they take out preaching they take out
[17:02] the fivefold ministry they take out
[17:04] words of wisdom they take out words of
[17:07] knowledge all the focus is on brother
[17:09] brandham and the tapes because that was
[17:11] the source of their income that was the
[17:13] source of their Authority and as brother
[17:15] random said the way a tree leans is the
[17:18] way a tree falls so I look at all these
[17:20] red flags I look at all these false
[17:22] doctrines over 24 false doctrines coming
[17:24] out of brandham Tabernacle I've just got
[17:26] to pray for them I've just got to ask
[17:28] God have mercy on
[17:35] them so that brings this podcast to a
[17:37] conclusion friends hope it was a
