[0:15] bride of christ ministries incorporated
[0:20] introduction the introduction contains
[0:23] footnotes
[0:24] one through three are long dresses part
[0:27] of your religion
[0:28] i see all of your daughters are wearing
[0:30] them a sales associate asked me recently
[0:34] i was so happy to receive her respectful
[0:36] question about our personal convictions
[0:39] yes we believe men and women should wear
[0:41] separate garments
[0:42] as god taught israel in deuteronomy 22
[0:45] verse 5.
[0:47] thinking on this exchange i really
[0:48] appreciated the manner in which this
[0:50] person
[0:50] asked about our clothing choices in my
[0:53] 16 years of following the bible's
[0:55] standard of separate garments for men
[0:57] and women
[0:58] i have had very few people ask why i
[1:00] hold this conviction
[1:02] most people including myself and my own
[1:04] family and friends
[1:05] seem to be uncomfortable addressing
[1:07] others faith-based convictions
[1:10] especially out in public not long after
[1:13] this friendly encounter
[1:14] i felt a great burden to write this book
[1:17] so i could clearly and fully explain
[1:19] what god's word teaches about a modest
[1:21] outward appearance
[1:23] i have approached this book in the same
[1:25] manner as the sales associate approached
[1:27] me
[1:28] with kindness and respect i realize that
[1:31] most people have been raised
[1:32] unaware of god's standards for a
[1:34] sanctified life
[1:36] when a person watches one of my teaching
[1:38] videos on youtube
[1:39] or reads this book it is likely that he
[1:42] or she is hearing this truth of god
[1:44] for the first time therefore i take the
[1:46] responsibility of presenting god's
[1:48] unchanging truth
[1:50] very seriously if you can receive god's
[1:53] requirements for
[1:54] holiness as taught in this book major
[1:56] changes will certainly take place in
[1:58] your life
[1:59] the changes will not be as difficult if
[2:00] you can sense the goodness of god
[2:02] that has brought you to the knowledge of
[2:04] holiness for it is god's goodness that
[2:07] leads us to repentance
[2:09] i want to present god's standards for
[2:11] our outward appearance with a biblical
[2:13] and historical foundation so you have
[2:16] assurance of the perfect will of god for
[2:18] your life
[2:19] jesus is the word of god and our rock
[2:22] when you believe god's words about
[2:23] living a holy life
[2:25] and apply them to your life you can be
[2:27] certain you are pleasing god
[2:29] and building your life upon the rock the
[2:31] eternal
[2:32] infallible unchanging word of god
[2:36] keep your bible handy as you read
[2:38] through this book as i will reference
[2:40] hundreds of scriptures you will be
[2:42] delighted to read with your own eyes
[2:44] all that god's word teaches about this
[2:46] subject
[2:47] i desire that you'll know and obey god's
[2:49] perfect will
[2:50] for your outward appearance at the
[2:52] conclusion of this book
[2:54] may you be a willing participant in
[2:56] god's restoration of christian modesty
[2:59] i plan to revisit the sales associate so
[3:02] i can hand her a free copy
[3:04] of this finished book you are holding in
[3:06] your hands
[3:10] chapter 1 a biblical foundation for your
[3:13] outward appearance
[3:16] chapter 1 contains footnotes numbers 4
[3:19] through 89 but as he which hath called
[3:23] you is holy
[3:24] so be ye holy in all manner of
[3:26] conversation
[3:27] first peter 1 verse 15
[3:31] the word of god is our foundation
[3:34] the biblical foundation for the doctrine
[3:36] of holiness in appearance
[3:37] begins with the word of god forever
[3:40] settled in heaven
[3:41] it is so enduring that heaven and earth
[3:43] will pass away
[3:44] while god's words can never pass away
[3:47] jesus christ taught that every detail of
[3:49] the word
[3:50] would be fulfilled scriptural knowledge
[3:53] makes us wise unto salvation
[3:55] and is profitable for doctrine reproof
[3:58] correction
[3:58] and instruction in righteousness
[4:02] when we read the bible with a hungry
[4:03] heart the holy spirit reveals god's
[4:06] perfect will
[4:07] for every area of our lives even our
[4:09] outward appearance
[4:12] the word delivers a standard of truth
[4:14] that transcends ages
[4:15] generations and societies because god's
[4:18] holy nature is always the same
[4:20] and does not change god's standards or
[4:23] rules for outward appearance have
[4:25] remained
[4:25] unchanged from genesis 3 verse 21
[4:29] to revelation 22 verse 21
[4:32] you and i can have confidence that this
[4:34] standard is the same today
[4:35] as it was for adam and eve the new
[4:38] testament gospel that christ gave to
[4:40] paul will be used to judge the secrets
[4:42] of men's hearts
[4:43] on the day of judgment humanity will not
[4:46] be judged by any denomination's
[4:48] understanding but rather by god's own
[4:50] revelation of his word
[4:52] since the word of god is the standard
[4:54] for judgment you must diligently seek
[4:56] god until he reveals this true
[4:58] interpretation of the bible
[5:00] to your heart you must also apply the
[5:03] many thoughts in the bible correctly to
[5:05] your life
[5:06] recall that even satan quoted the word
[5:08] of god to jesus at his three temptations
[5:10] in the wilderness but satan's
[5:13] applications were always rooted in
[5:14] idolatry
[5:16] unbelief or pride you should study every
[5:19] word in the bible and pray for god's
[5:21] understanding of scripture
[5:23] and its application to your life
[5:26] the rightly divided word of truth the
[5:29] savior taught that you are to live by
[5:31] every word that proceeds out of the
[5:32] mouth of god
[5:34] if you must live by every word of god
[5:36] you must know how
[5:37] portions of scripture pertain to you
[5:39] thankfully god promised to send men who
[5:41] are gifted with five different
[5:43] but complementary preaching gifts to
[5:46] bring unity to the faith and bring
[5:48] believers
[5:49] to a state of spiritual completion
[5:52] additionally paul stated that gifted
[5:54] preachers would be able to rightly
[5:55] divide
[5:56] god's word to his people true gospel
[5:59] preaching and teaching will save the
[6:00] preacher
[6:01] and those that believe him i pray that
[6:04] the lord jesus would use my teaching
[6:06] gift to rightly divide god's truth to
[6:08] you
[6:08] in this often misunderstood area of
[6:11] outward appearance
[6:12] i am simply teaching what the holy
[6:14] spirit has taught me privately
[6:16] and what faithful men have taught me
[6:18] over the years in accordance with second
[6:20] timothy 2 verse 2
[6:22] and the things that thou has heard of me
[6:24] among many witnesses
[6:26] the same commit thou to faithful men who
[6:29] shall be able to teach
[6:30] others also knowing the rightly divided
[6:33] word of god
[6:34] isn't enough we need obedience to it in
[6:37] matthew 7 verses 24 through 29
[6:40] our lord jesus taught that obedience to
[6:42] the word of god
[6:43] is the foundation on which our lives
[6:46] should rest
[6:47] those who do the commands of god will
[6:49] have a life able to withstand
[6:51] any trial in contrast jesus then
[6:54] revealed that those who disobey god's
[6:56] word
[6:57] are in danger of falling from truth when
[6:59] the storms came
[7:02] the predicted falling away the bible
[7:05] actually predicted a global falling away
[7:07] from obedience to the word of god before
[7:10] the antichrist would be revealed in the
[7:12] end days
[7:13] other portions of scripture support this
[7:15] prophecy that obedience to the word of
[7:17] god
[7:17] would continually decrease and obedient
[7:20] christians would become a very small
[7:22] minority
[7:23] based upon these prophecies you would
[7:25] expect the majority of those claiming to
[7:27] be christians
[7:28] would not honor god's word in many areas
[7:30] of biblical doctrine
[7:32] but would fall away from the truth of
[7:33] the bible in relation to modest clothing
[7:36] holiness and appearance and hair length
[7:39] among other things
[7:41] you cannot call your creator lord if you
[7:43] do not obey his word
[7:45] though there are many who will honor god
[7:47] with their lips
[7:48] and yet their hearts will be far from
[7:50] him
[7:51] run from that group and join the
[7:53] faithful obedient
[7:54] and diligent followers of the holy
[7:56] scripture
[7:57] our lord jesus christ asked a very
[7:59] pointed question
[8:00] in luke 6 46 that you must ask yourself
[8:04] today
[8:05] and why call ye me lord lord and do not
[8:08] the things which i say
[8:10] your heart should answer this question
[8:12] by saying dear jesus
[8:14] my obedience to your commands proves you
[8:17] are truly my lord
[8:19] what is holiness a life of holiness is a
[8:23] state of constant obedience to god's
[8:25] word
[8:26] the greek lexicon describes holiness as
[8:28] consecration
[8:30] purification sanctification of heart and
[8:32] life
[8:34] scripture describes a holy life as
[8:36] living without any sin or filthiness in
[8:38] body
[8:38] and mind your calling from god is to
[8:41] perfect holiness
[8:42] in reverential fear or respect of
[8:45] almighty god
[8:47] in broad terms holiness includes every
[8:49] action in life
[8:51] the focus of this book is conforming
[8:53] your outward appearance to god's
[8:54] standard for holiness
[8:56] chapter 3 covers god's four guidelines
[8:59] for modest clothing
[9:00] chapter 4 teaches you how long hair
[9:02] should be if you want to live a life of
[9:04] holiness unto god
[9:06] chapter 5 examines whether makeup
[9:08] tattoos
[9:09] jewelry high heels and earrings are holy
[9:12] in the sight of god
[9:15] god requires holiness god requires his
[9:18] new testament followers to be holy
[9:21] or set apart from sinful behaviors and
[9:23] lifestyles
[9:25] our entire lives should be wholly
[9:26] devoted to serving and pleasing our god
[9:29] scripture literally states our purpose
[9:31] that we should be holy and without blame
[9:33] before him
[9:35] our god required holiness or a separated
[9:38] lifestyle
[9:39] in the old testament and also requires
[9:41] it today in the new testament
[9:43] first peter 1 verses 15 and 16
[9:46] instructs us to be holy in all manner of
[9:48] conversation
[9:50] which in the greek means manner of life
[9:52] conduct
[9:53] and behavior peter was quoting the old
[9:55] testament scriptures from leviticus 11
[9:57] verses 44 and 45
[10:00] and 20 verse 7 making us aware that many
[10:03] of god's principles
[10:04] of the old testament are still in effect
[10:06] today
[10:07] chapter 2 explores this concept in depth
[10:11] god requires holiness because he
[10:13] purchased us with the precious blood of
[10:15] his son
[10:16] jesus christ he is the god of the living
[10:19] and dead
[10:19] and earned the right to be our lord or
[10:22] ruler over
[10:23] every soul through the sacrifice of his
[10:25] son on the cross of calvary
[10:28] paul said we are holy temples or
[10:30] tabernacles
[10:31] if you will not submit to your creator
[10:33] and become holy
[10:34] god will destroy you living a holy life
[10:37] is an important issue
[10:39] and should be on the minds of anyone
[10:40] serious about loving and serving a holy
[10:43] god
[10:44] every man and woman has been given a
[10:46] conscience for the purpose of moral
[10:47] perception
[10:49] which is to understand if something is
[10:51] right or wrong
[10:52] when you truly believe in and accept the
[10:54] sacrifice of jesus christ in your life
[10:57] you can now experience a clean pure
[10:59] conscience
[11:00] that is free from corruption and fully
[11:02] devoted to the service of god
[11:04] thereby you can perceive you are
[11:06] justified from your sins
[11:08] and living right before your creator
[11:12] how we become holy the process of
[11:14] becoming holy or separated from the
[11:16] world is plainly taught in numerous new
[11:18] testament passages
[11:20] paul wrote that jesus sanctifies and
[11:23] cleanses his church
[11:24] with the washing of water by the word
[11:27] followers of christ are washed by the
[11:29] word as they lay apart
[11:30] all filthiness and receive the word of
[11:33] god
[11:34] the key to your washing is to
[11:36] voluntarily lay aside
[11:37] all sin and do the will of god peter
[11:40] wrote that we purify
[11:42] our souls through obedience to the word
[11:43] of god
[11:45] obedience can only occur when you die to
[11:47] your own will
[11:48] and do the will of god as taught by
[11:50] jesus's submission
[11:51] in gethsemane conversely a soul that
[11:55] will not obey the spirit of god
[11:57] is known as subverted unstable and
[11:59] ultimately
[12:00] lost being sanctified unto god
[12:04] completely and holy is the absolute will
[12:06] of god for all believers
[12:08] to do the will of god is god working in
[12:11] us to do his good pleasure
[12:13] to reject the will of god is to become a
[12:15] worker of iniquity
[12:17] without holiness no man shall see the
[12:19] lord
[12:21] holiness is beautiful psalm 96 verse 9
[12:25] teaches that we should worship the lord
[12:27] in the beauty of holiness
[12:29] o worship the lord in the beauty of
[12:31] holiness fear before him
[12:33] all the earth it is strengthening to
[12:35] know that god sees holy living as
[12:37] beautiful
[12:38] and as an act of true worship
[12:41] hollywood false religions and the world
[12:44] will never see god's holiness
[12:46] standards as attractive or beautiful so
[12:49] we do not expect the world to fall in
[12:51] love with modesty
[12:52] but we can rest assured that the same
[12:55] god who called us to be holy
[12:57] is the same god who looks down upon his
[12:59] obedient children
[13:00] and sees their character conduct and
[13:03] clothing
[13:03] as beautiful in his sight jesus christ
[13:07] is the very epitome of beauty not
[13:09] because of his attractive appearance or
[13:11] clothing
[13:12] but because of his holy sinless
[13:14] lifestyle and character
[13:16] some artists represent jesus as having
[13:18] an attractive face shiny hair
[13:20] and elegant robes but this idea is
[13:23] completely contrary to isaiah's
[13:25] description of christ
[13:26] when he said there is no beauty that we
[13:29] should desire him
[13:30] jesus's character was beautiful because
[13:33] he always did
[13:34] that which pleased the father christians
[13:36] who live holy
[13:37] have the same attitude for paul wrote
[13:39] that we have the same mind of christ
[13:42] your life is beautiful in god's sight
[13:44] when you apply christ's attitude to your
[13:46] life
[13:47] satan often disguises his temptations by
[13:50] using beauty
[13:51] satan's own beauty lifted up his heart
[13:53] and pride against god
[13:54] and led to his being cast out of heaven
[13:57] cain tried to offer a more beautiful
[13:59] sacrifice than abel's
[14:00] but his offering was rejected those who
[14:03] want to appear beautiful to the world
[14:05] standards today
[14:06] must take heed that they do not repeat
[14:08] the same prideful
[14:10] and devilish mistake as satan promoting
[14:13] your beauty has a strong tendency to
[14:15] lead you away
[14:16] from god's standard of beauty proverbs
[14:19] 31 verse 30 tells us that
[14:21] beauty is vain and the most valuable
[14:23] possession we can have
[14:25] is the fear of the lord which causes us
[14:27] to hate evil
[14:29] when you hate evil and abstain from it
[14:31] you are holy and beautiful
[14:32] in god's sight love is the greatest
[14:36] motivator
[14:38] many people consider standards for holy
[14:40] living as legalism
[14:42] however a true understanding of legalism
[14:44] will help you know the difference
[14:46] between an unhealthy legalistic attitude
[14:49] driven by fear
[14:50] versus a healthy obedient attitude
[14:53] driven by love
[14:54] love is the greatest and only motivation
[14:57] needed for the believer
[14:58] to meet god's requirement for a holy
[15:00] life
[15:01] obedience is accepted by god when love
[15:04] is its motivation
[15:05] first corinthians chapter 13 teaches
[15:08] that love is the greatest of all gifts
[15:10] miracles knowledge and understanding all
[15:13] mysteries
[15:14] do not profit believers unless they have
[15:16] the love of god in their hearts
[15:18] as their motivation for every action or
[15:20] work
[15:22] love empowers faith which then produces
[15:24] works
[15:25] always obey god in the correct order
[15:28] love
[15:28] faith works in saint john chapter 14
[15:33] the lord jesus teaches that love is the
[15:35] only accepted motivation for obedience
[15:38] in the sight of god in four separate
[15:40] verses
[15:41] jesus teaches that love will cause a
[15:43] true believer to keep the commands of
[15:45] god
[15:46] you are known as a lover of god if you
[15:48] keep the sayings of jesus
[15:51] the earthly life of the lord jesus
[15:53] christ epitomized obeying the
[15:55] commandments of god
[15:56] based upon love jesus loved the father
[15:59] and knew he always pleased him
[16:01] because he never disobeyed one command
[16:04] despite being tempted in every way
[16:06] jesus's love for the father empowered
[16:09] him to love his neighbors as
[16:10] himself fulfilling all the law of god
[16:15] legalism one definition of legalism is
[16:18] excessive adherence to law or formula
[16:21] meaning that the legalist standard is
[16:23] more than necessary
[16:25] legalism then in christianity is adding
[16:28] some requirement to the bible
[16:30] that god does not require there are
[16:32] grave consequences to adding
[16:34] requirements to the bible
[16:36] proverbs says add thou not unto his
[16:38] words
[16:39] lest he reprove thee and thou be found a
[16:42] liar
[16:43] revelation says plagues will be added to
[16:45] those who add to the book
[16:46] and those who take away will have their
[16:48] heavenly inheritance taken away
[16:51] god's pure words are sufficient for our
[16:53] complete earthly journey
[16:55] god's standards for holiness are not
[16:57] legalism since no requirements have been
[16:59] added to the bible
[17:02] paul specifically denounced legalism
[17:03] concerning the doctrine of circumcision
[17:06] teaching that requiring circumcision in
[17:08] the new testament
[17:09] would be a fall from grace paul's
[17:12] encounter with men who taught
[17:13] circumcision
[17:14] was required for salvation led the
[17:16] apostles to have a counsel about the
[17:18] matter
[17:19] concluding that gentiles were not
[17:21] required to be circumcised
[17:23] this pattern should be followed today
[17:25] when believers sense a legalistic
[17:27] teaching
[17:28] may be creeping into the body of christ
[17:30] elders or leaders of the church
[17:32] should gather together to pray and
[17:34] search the scripture
[17:35] in order to provide a clear concise
[17:38] biblical answer
[17:39] to the teaching in question they should
[17:41] also prayerfully seek out wisdom from
[17:43] other seasoned ministers
[17:45] and come to a bible-based conclusion
[17:48] modesty the term modesty will show up
[17:51] often in this book
[17:52] and is a command of god i use this word
[17:55] to focus on the clothing that we wear on
[17:57] our bodies
[17:58] the context of this term comes from a
[18:00] scripture about apparel
[18:02] in 1st timothy 2 9. in like manner also
[18:05] that women
[18:06] adorn themselves in modest apparel with
[18:09] shamefaceness
[18:10] and sobriety the greek definition of
[18:13] modesty is
[18:14] well arranged to clarify modesty a
[18:16] modern definition is showing regard
[18:19] for the decencies of behavior speech
[18:21] dress
[18:22] when you dress modestly you are not
[18:24] drawing attention to your own body
[18:26] instead you redirect attention away from
[18:28] your body
[18:29] by wearing clothes which cover areas of
[18:31] nakedness
[18:32] chapter 3 thoroughly explains the four
[18:35] bible guidelines for covering the parts
[18:36] of the body
[18:37] that god considers nakedness
[18:40] the beginning and ending of modest
[18:42] clothing genesis the book of beginnings
[18:45] is where we see the beginning of modest
[18:47] clothing
[18:49] before their fall unto sin adam and eve
[18:51] were both naked and unashamed
[18:53] immediately after eve was deceived into
[18:55] sinning by the serpent
[18:57] she gave the forbidden fruit to adam and
[18:59] he willingly sinned by partaking of it
[19:01] with her
[19:03] sensing the shame of their nakedness for
[19:05] the first time adam and eve sewed fig
[19:07] leaves together to cover their nakedness
[19:09] with
[19:09] aprons the hebrew lexicon defines apron
[19:12] as a loin covering
[19:14] loincloth loins refer to the
[19:17] reproductive parts
[19:18] around the area of the hips it is
[19:21] crucial to observe that adam and eve
[19:23] covered only their private parts
[19:24] or loins later god himself visited adam
[19:28] and eve and gave them coats of skins
[19:30] the hebrew lexicon defines a co as a
[19:33] long shirt-like garment
[19:35] like a tunic that covers from the breast
[19:37] down nearly to the feet
[19:39] here we see god as the originator of
[19:41] modest clothing
[19:42] and adam and eve as the originators of
[19:45] immodest clothing
[19:46] adam and eve at first chose to cover
[19:48] only the loins
[19:50] but god chose to cover nearly the entire
[19:52] body
[19:53] including the breasts abdomen and thighs
[19:56] god's choice of clothing required more
[19:58] covering than adam and eve's choice
[20:00] proving that god will always require
[20:02] more than the sinful
[20:04] human mind thinks that god requires
[20:07] the ending of modest clothing or last
[20:09] reference to it
[20:10] is found in the book of revelation white
[20:13] robes are the clothing that god chooses
[20:15] for his believers
[20:16] as they worship the lamb around the
[20:18] throne of god
[20:19] in revelation 7 verses 9 to 17.
[20:23] the greek lexicon defines these white
[20:25] robes as
[20:26] a loose outer garment extending to the
[20:29] feet
[20:30] what a beautiful picture of god's people
[20:32] worshiping him
[20:33] in the beauty of holiness wearing modest
[20:35] white robes that extend to their feet
[20:38] you can rest assured that god's unending
[20:40] eternal plan for your outward appearance
[20:42] is modest clothing today is like the
[20:46] days of noah
[20:48] it has become fashionable for women to
[20:49] dress immodestly
[20:51] or like harlots jesus christ prophesied
[20:54] of these immoral conditions when he said
[20:56] that the days of his second coming
[20:58] would be like the days of noah in noah's
[21:00] day
[21:01] the beautiful daughters of men were so
[21:03] attractive that the sons of god
[21:05] men in the godly lineage of adam and
[21:07] seth were intermarrying with these
[21:09] unbelieving women solely upon the basis
[21:12] of their beauty
[21:14] the daughters of men were unbelievers or
[21:17] they would have been called the
[21:18] daughters of god
[21:19] these weak compromising sons of god were
[21:22] just one more reason god said his spirit
[21:24] would not always strive with man
[21:26] and their failures helped usher in the
[21:29] judgment of the worldwide flood
[21:31] history is truly repeating itself young
[21:34] men and women who are raised in godly
[21:35] homes
[21:36] are stumbling over prospective
[21:38] unbelieving spouses
[21:40] who are immodestly dressed and marrying
[21:42] outside the faith of jesus christ
[21:45] the results of these ungodly unions are
[21:47] generations of disobedient
[21:49] faithless families our spiritual eyes
[21:52] should see that the same evil spirits
[21:54] which caused
[21:55] the beautiful daughters of men to draw
[21:57] away the sons of god in the days of noah
[21:59] are the same evil spirits causing men
[22:01] and women to stumble today
[22:03] because spirits do not die they just
[22:06] move from one believer to the next
[22:08] we are living in the days of the second
[22:10] coming of the son of man
[22:11] which mirror the days of noah
[22:15] the root of immodesty immodesty is
[22:18] caused by the power of darkness
[22:20] or the influence of evil spirits that
[22:22] cause women and men to
[22:23] unclothe their bodies and present
[22:25] themselves immodestly before the public
[22:28] as clearly written in scripture two
[22:31] notable bible examples demonstrate that
[22:33] evil spirits strip people of their
[22:35] clothing
[22:36] first evil spirits were credited with
[22:38] unclothing the man from gadara
[22:40] in luke 8 verses 26-35
[22:44] after jesus had cast the legion of
[22:45] demons out of the delivered man
[22:47] he was then clothed and sat at the feet
[22:50] of jesus in his right mind
[22:52] a legion of demons stripped this poor
[22:54] man of his clothing
[22:56] but once those demons left he was soon
[22:58] fully clothed
[22:59] this illustrates that someone who
[23:01] dresses in modestly
[23:02] and reveals parts of their body that god
[23:04] considers nakedness
[23:06] is not in his or her right mind
[23:09] a second example is found in acts 19
[23:12] verses
[23:12] 14 to 16. seven jewish sons of skiva
[23:16] were trying to cast out an evil spirit
[23:18] in the name of jesus
[23:20] but they were not believers in christ or
[23:22] did not have genuine faith in christ
[23:25] the evil spirit from the possessed man
[23:27] leaped on the sons
[23:28] overcame them and prevailed against them
[23:30] so much so
[23:32] that the seven sons fled out of the
[23:34] house naked and wounded
[23:35] the lesson is that evil spirits strip
[23:38] off clothing
[23:39] the power of the holy spirit causes us
[23:41] to dress modestly and keep the
[23:43] commandments of god
[23:44] scripture says the holy spirit quickens
[23:46] or makes alive
[23:48] the word of god to the believer and
[23:50] causes him to keep god's commands
[23:54] outward nakedness signals spiritual
[23:56] nakedness
[23:57] outward nakedness indicates spiritual
[24:00] nakedness
[24:01] when a woman yields to the influence of
[24:02] evil spirits and presents her body in a
[24:04] sexually attractive way
[24:06] before the public it is one outward sign
[24:09] of the inward nakedness of her soul
[24:12] this means that person is not born again
[24:14] she does not possess the spirit of jesus
[24:16] christ
[24:17] her soul is naked or absent of the
[24:20] spirit's abiding presence
[24:22] the bible calls this presence the seal
[24:24] of the holy ghost
[24:25] a believer who is truly born again of
[24:27] the holy ghost possesses the spirit of
[24:29] christ and his righteousness and is
[24:32] thereby clothed or endued with the power
[24:34] of god
[24:35] the soul of the born-again christian is
[24:37] clothed or dressed with power
[24:40] the holy ghost has written the word of
[24:41] god upon her heart
[24:44] the soul's clothing is an extremely
[24:46] important concept
[24:47] jesus christ's words to the church in
[24:49] laodicea pronounced the most harsh
[24:52] denunciation
[24:53] to any people in human history because
[24:55] of their naked souls
[24:57] those in laodicea were rich increased of
[24:59] goods
[25:00] had need of nothing but were naked and
[25:02] did not know it
[25:04] the laodiceans did not have to combat
[25:06] persecution
[25:07] poverty or any other life-threatening
[25:09] enemy
[25:10] they had only to battle riches and
[25:12] increase of goods and
[25:14] prosperity and yet they could not
[25:16] crucify the lust of the flesh
[25:18] lust of the eyes and pride of life
[25:21] therefore these laodiceans deserve the
[25:23] greatest rebuke of all time
[25:25] due to their love of the world this
[25:27] misplaced
[25:28] love proved their souls were not clothed
[25:30] with christ's righteousness
[25:33] we live in the exact same state as the
[25:35] laodiceans today
[25:36] having increased goods prosperity and
[25:39] riches
[25:39] but lacking spiritual power thankfully
[25:42] the lord jesus gave us the prescription
[25:44] on how to overcome the spirit of
[25:46] laodicea
[25:47] zealous repentance through communion
[25:49] with christ
[25:50] to zealously repent means to eagerly
[25:52] destroy any sinful habits
[25:55] with an intense motivation to obey jesus
[25:57] christ
[25:58] if you zealously repent christ will call
[26:01] you an overcomer and grant you a seat or
[26:03] throne
[26:04] near his own after genuine repentance
[26:07] your soul will be clothed with jesus's
[26:09] own righteousness
[26:11] the dangers of immodesty the dangers of
[26:15] immodesty include causing others to
[26:17] stumble
[26:17] and being taken captive to the will of
[26:20] evil spirits
[26:21] any individual who dresses immodestly
[26:23] and leads others to lust after his or
[26:25] her body
[26:26] is guilty of sinning against christ by
[26:29] leading others to stumble into sin
[26:32] scripture is clear about our
[26:33] responsibility to present our bodies in
[26:35] modest apparel
[26:37] for our bodies are living sacrifices
[26:39] unto god
[26:40] and temples of the holy ghost two
[26:42] important new testament texts
[26:44] teach us a great deal about our
[26:46] responsibility not to set a stumbling
[26:48] block in
[26:49] anyone's way romans 14 verses 12 through
[26:52] 23 and 1st corinthians 8
[26:55] verses 7 through 13. in context of these
[26:59] scriptures the examples of the sins
[27:01] that cause others to stumble include
[27:03] eating meat sacrificed to idols and
[27:06] drinking wine
[27:07] while the sin of immodest clothing is
[27:09] not listed in these two particular texts
[27:11] it is listed in the following passages
[27:14] proverbs 7 verse 10
[27:16] proverbs 6 verse 25 and matthew 5 verse
[27:20] 28 proverbs 7 verse 10 mentions the
[27:23] attire
[27:24] or clothing of a harlot this passage
[27:27] brings us to the obvious conclusion
[27:29] that harlots or prostitutes dress in a
[27:31] specific
[27:32] immodest way in order to tempt men to
[27:35] pay them for sexual sin
[27:37] the harlot's clothing or any woman's
[27:39] immodest clothing
[27:41] ignites a man's sexual passions like a
[27:44] lit
[27:44] match ignites spilled gasoline
[27:47] additionally
[27:48] consider the pure selfishness in a
[27:49] harlot or woman's heart
[27:51] to present herself immodestly for her
[27:54] own gain
[27:55] knowing she is weakening men's spiritual
[27:57] conditions and their marriages
[28:00] this level of selfishness is the
[28:01] complete opposite of the golden rule
[28:04] which encourages living for the benefit
[28:06] of others and putting their needs first
[28:09] therefore all things whatsoever ye would
[28:12] that men should do to you
[28:14] do ye even so to them leading others to
[28:17] stumble through sinful thoughts of lust
[28:20] is a serious danger proverbs warns that
[28:22] men must not lust after women in their
[28:25] minds
[28:25] and that women seduce men with seductive
[28:28] looks
[28:29] our lord jesus teaches that lusting in
[28:31] the heart is the same as committing the
[28:33] very act of adultery
[28:35] jesus's command to avoid lusting in our
[28:38] hearts is part of the gospel or good
[28:39] news
[28:40] those who do not hearken in repentance
[28:42] unto all of christ's words
[28:44] including his words about our thought
[28:46] lives will be destroyed on the day of
[28:48] judgment
[28:49] proverbs 7 verse 27 supports jesus's
[28:52] teaching
[28:53] as we read about harlots leading men to
[28:55] hell whether a man stumbles at the
[28:57] harlot's immodest clothing
[28:59] committing adultery in his heart or
[29:02] fulfills the act in the flesh
[29:03] he's in danger of destroying his soul
[29:06] clearly there may be times a woman
[29:08] cannot keep a lustful man from having
[29:10] evil thoughts
[29:11] about her even though she has dressed
[29:13] modestly
[29:14] in this case the woman is innocent if
[29:17] she follow god's command for modest
[29:18] clothing
[29:19] the person lusting is the only guilty
[29:21] one
[29:22] many men are so addicted to lust that
[29:25] they will fulfill their evil thoughts
[29:27] about a modestly dressed woman
[29:29] despite her efforts to honor god in our
[29:32] hyper-sexualized culture
[29:34] women are now becoming as lustful as men
[29:36] so it is increasingly important for both
[29:39] sexes
[29:40] to avoid inciting sexual passions by
[29:42] dressing modestly
[29:44] titus 1 verse 15 states that the pure
[29:47] and heart are not guilty
[29:49] of someone else's sin saying unto the
[29:52] pure
[29:52] all things are pure but unto them that
[29:54] are defiled and unbelieving is nothing
[29:57] pure
[29:58] but even their mind and conscience is
[30:00] defiled
[30:02] god's principle from genesis 18 verse 23
[30:05] declares that he will not destroy the
[30:07] righteous with the wicked
[30:08] so you can rest assured that god will
[30:10] not hold you responsible
[30:12] for another person's lust if you are
[30:14] dressed modestly
[30:16] being taken captive by an evil spirit or
[30:19] trapped in addiction
[30:21] is another danger of immodest clothing
[30:23] addiction can take place
[30:25] only when a person willingly submits to
[30:27] the evil spirit
[30:28] by his or her own free will since the
[30:31] devil cannot make us do
[30:32] evil an addict is in a slave-like
[30:36] condition
[30:37] where he or she is under such a strong
[30:38] demonic influence
[30:40] that he or she regularly obeys an evil
[30:42] spirit
[30:43] and does not have the power or faith to
[30:46] obey christ's word
[30:48] jesus described this condition as being
[30:50] bound by a greater power
[30:51] and being spoiled from all godly
[30:54] possessions
[30:55] including joy faith hope love
[30:58] and other godly blessings being trapped
[31:01] in an addiction
[31:02] is commonly called captivity in
[31:04] scripture
[31:06] lust addicts live completely contrary to
[31:08] god's calling to be his children
[31:10] obeying fleshly sexual lust makes men
[31:13] and women resemble beasts
[31:15] rather than children of god beastly
[31:17] lustful behavior is responsible for many
[31:20] evils in society
[31:21] such as divorces pornography sexual
[31:24] violence
[31:25] and sexually transmitted diseases a
[31:28] sensual carnal lifestyle is proof
[31:30] that the holy spirit is absent from a
[31:32] person's life
[31:34] the only hope for an addicted individual
[31:36] is repentance
[31:37] which starts with confessing his sin and
[31:40] exposing the evil spirit in his life
[31:43] once the sin is confessed and forgiven
[31:45] by the blood of jesus christ
[31:47] satan's evil spirit no longer has the
[31:49] power or influence it once had
[31:52] the individual can now resist the devil
[31:54] or evil spirit
[31:55] with a righteous vengeance if a believer
[31:58] continually resists the temptation
[32:01] and stands faithful in obedience to
[32:03] god's word the evil spirit must flee
[32:05] from him
[32:06] according to the promise of god my
[32:09] experience with
[32:10] immodesty modest clothing holiness and
[32:14] appearance and god honoring hair length
[32:16] were certainly not a big part of my
[32:18] background
[32:19] while i have many reasons to be thankful
[32:21] for being raised in a home that attended
[32:22] a charismatic
[32:23] denominational church my siblings and i
[32:26] learned very little about modesty and
[32:28] holiness
[32:29] perhaps because my parents were not
[32:30] taught god's standards in these areas
[32:33] in the fall of 2001 as a 21 year old
[32:36] college student
[32:37] i first learned about god's standards
[32:39] for a holy appearance
[32:41] i quickly changed churches so i could
[32:43] hear more truth preached
[32:44] every service upon hearing and reading
[32:46] the bible truth about these subjects
[32:48] the bible felt like a new book to me by
[32:51] worshiping with new believers in a
[32:53] church that believed in god's modesty
[32:55] and holiness standards i quickly gained
[32:57] the understanding that god wanted all
[32:59] believers
[33:00] to walk according to the same rule or
[33:03] standard of investigating
[33:04] judging living and acting as i witnessed
[33:08] firsthand a group of spirit-led
[33:10] believers
[33:11] who wore modest clothes and kept
[33:13] holiness standards
[33:14] i immediately felt the presence of the
[33:16] holy ghost in a greater way than i'd
[33:18] ever felt before
[33:20] seeing other believers obey this higher
[33:22] level of modesty and holiness
[33:24] made me hunger to duplicate this same
[33:26] degree of dedication in my own life
[33:29] which jesus called a hunger and thirst
[33:31] for righteousness
[33:32] after months of persistent prayer and
[33:34] study the lord led me to make two major
[33:37] changes
[33:38] first i began to dress modestly at all
[33:40] times
[33:41] i stopped taking off my shirt to
[33:42] pridefully show off my upper body
[33:45] in the past i'd enjoyed undressing in
[33:47] order to get compliments
[33:49] and even heard females do the wolf
[33:51] whistle at me
[33:52] second the holy spirit led me to cut my
[33:55] hair which at the time resembled the
[33:57] mullet look
[33:58] as i wanted to honor the lord with my
[34:00] hair by making it look
[34:01] undoubtedly masculine i'd like to share
[34:04] a personal story from my childhood about
[34:06] the devastating effects
[34:08] that immodesty had upon my young mind
[34:10] which led to years of addiction to the
[34:12] spirit of lust
[34:14] as a child in sunday school i remember
[34:16] singing be careful little lies what you
[34:18] see
[34:19] but it seems i was almost powerless to
[34:21] overcome the temptation of immodestly
[34:23] dressed women
[34:24] when first presented with a temptation
[34:27] for certain i was unaware that the bible
[34:29] taught temptation
[34:30] would always come in three channels lust
[34:33] of the eyes lust of the flesh
[34:35] and pride of life my story begins when i
[34:39] was in grade school
[34:40] and one of my friends invited me to
[34:41] spend the night at his house
[34:43] while there we traded baseball cards but
[34:46] late into the night we started watching
[34:47] mtv with his older brother
[34:50] my eyes were glued to the screen as i
[34:52] witnessed music
[34:53] clothing and dancing i had never seen
[34:55] before
[34:56] those few moments had a lasting effect
[34:58] upon my mind
[35:00] when i returned home the next day those
[35:02] images of immodestly dressed women
[35:04] remained in my mind
[35:06] along with the explicitly sexual lyrics
[35:09] after a short time past our family was
[35:11] sitting down to enjoy
[35:12] our weekly ritual of watching the cosby
[35:15] show
[35:16] normally i was front and center of the
[35:18] television
[35:19] sure not to miss one second of the show
[35:21] i thought was the funniest of all
[35:23] but this night was different because of
[35:26] the immodest clothing and dancing i'd
[35:28] witnessed at my friend's house i was off
[35:30] in my bedroom
[35:31] all alone drawing women in bikinis on
[35:34] baseball cards
[35:35] the music dancing and immodest clothing
[35:38] of mtv
[35:39] had so captured my mind that i combined
[35:41] the new lustful images in my mind
[35:44] sexy clothing with my childhood hobby
[35:47] baseball card trading my mind was
[35:49] officially addicted to the spirit of
[35:51] lust
[35:52] at some point during the cosby show my
[35:54] mother walked into the room
[35:56] and asked me what i was doing instantly
[35:58] i felt ashamed and embarrassed
[36:00] and my mother confiscated my homemade
[36:02] baseball cards
[36:04] my mother was not one to purposely
[36:05] embarrass me but she would try to
[36:07] separate me from evil
[36:09] i have never forgotten this moment and
[36:11] now that i have a greater understanding
[36:13] of the bible and spiritual matters
[36:15] i can easily see how the spirit of lust
[36:17] entered and filled my mind
[36:19] through seeing immodestly dressed women
[36:21] on mtv
[36:23] as the years passed i would jump upon
[36:25] every opportunity
[36:26] to watch tv shows commercials or movies
[36:29] with immodestly dressed women
[36:31] the lustful images fill my mind and i
[36:34] let the stronger spirit of lust
[36:36] spoil the spiritual blessings from my
[36:38] mind and heart
[36:40] when i was in my late teens another
[36:42] friend introduced me to free
[36:43] pornographic material
[36:45] on the internet and i spent the next few
[36:48] years under a greater bondage to the
[36:50] lust of the eyes
[36:51] this addiction continued into my college
[36:53] years and i remember renting the
[36:55] library's laptops to write papers
[36:57] but spent substantial time on lustful
[37:00] websites
[37:02] by the grace of almighty god through
[37:03] much prayer bible study
[37:05] and hearing the preaching of the word of
[37:07] god i was given complete victory over
[37:10] the pornographic
[37:11] empire around 2002 and have never gone
[37:14] back
[37:15] the goodness of god brought me to true
[37:16] repentance and i confess my sin and
[37:19] shame to my heavenly father
[37:21] i remain ever grateful to god that he
[37:23] delivered me from this evil spirit of
[37:25] lust
[37:26] before i entered into my marriage
[37:28] covenant with my darling wife
[37:31] these memories of my childhood have
[37:33] created a strong desire my heart and
[37:35] soul
[37:35] to protect myself and my children from
[37:38] the evil spirits that promote
[37:39] immodest clothing and ultimately a sin
[37:43] slaved ungodly life while i am ashamed
[37:46] that i became addicted to the spirit of
[37:47] lust at eight years old
[37:49] i am eternally thankful that god has
[37:51] delivered me from this evil spirit
[37:53] and has given me the scriptures i needed
[37:56] to personally overcome this spirit
[37:58] and help others to do the same
[38:03] conclusion the word of god is the one
[38:06] and only foundation we need for our
[38:07] lives
[38:08] god wants us to live in a way that
[38:10] fulfills the holy purpose
[38:12] spelled out in scripture modesty matters
[38:15] to god's people because
[38:16] it is commanded christians recognize the
[38:19] short and long-term effects of
[38:21] immodesty and choose to cast down any
[38:23] and all of satan's lustful temptations
[38:26] that contradict the word of god although
[38:29] satan constantly exalts in modesty
[38:32] through the addictive spirit of lust
[38:34] god's promises provide every single
[38:36] spiritual blessing we need
[38:38] for our journey christians obtain these
[38:40] blessings
[38:41] by christ's own gift of faith using his
[38:45] faith
[38:45] we obey god's holy calling for a
[38:48] god-honoring outward appearance
[38:50] our consciences rest assured that god
[38:53] sees our lives
[38:54] as obedient and beautiful with the
[38:57] understanding that the eternal word of
[38:58] god is our sure foundation
[39:00] we can now learn how to apply scripture
[39:03] to our lives
