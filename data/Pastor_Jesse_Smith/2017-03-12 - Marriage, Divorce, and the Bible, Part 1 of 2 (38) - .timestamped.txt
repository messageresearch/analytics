[0:06] greetings friends in the majesty of the
[0:09] Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this
[0:11] video is to teach the truth about
[0:12] marriage and divorce contrary to popular
[0:15] opinion the truth our marriage and
[0:17] divorce is quite straightforward in the
[0:19] Bible this is an extremely personal
[0:21] subject but yet it is a Bible subject
[0:24] with such importance for today that just
[0:27] as in the days of Moses and st. Paul God
[0:29] had to send a vindicated prophet named
[0:32] William Branham to reveal the truth
[0:34] about marriage and divorce marriage
[0:38] terminology to fully understand the
[0:40] Bible truths about marriage and divorce
[0:42] understanding the King James Version
[0:44] terminology is of the utmost importance
[0:47] here are important Bible terms and
[0:49] phrases we must understand
[0:51] with support from Scripture we begin
[0:54] with the word espouse which means to be
[0:57] pledged to or promised in marriage to
[1:00] another by a vow an engagement to be
[1:02] married to be betrothed this term is
[1:06] found in matthew chapter 1 verse 18 now
[1:08] the birth of Jesus Christ was on this
[1:10] wise when as his mother Mary was
[1:13] espoused to Joseph before they came
[1:15] together she was found with child of the
[1:18] Holy Ghost the Greek definition is to
[1:21] woo her and ask her in marriage to be
[1:24] promised in marriage be betrothed Mary
[1:29] was espoused to Joseph Joseph had asked
[1:31] her hand in marriage and she and it's
[1:33] likely her father had agreed Joseph and
[1:36] Mary promised or vowed to be married to
[1:38] each other it is crucial to understand
[1:40] that in God's eyes this is spousal or
[1:43] engagement vow is what literally marries
[1:45] the couple and guy recognizes a couple
[1:47] is married once this espousal or
[1:50] engagement has taken place as seen by
[1:53] matthew 1 verse 20 the angel alert told
[1:56] Joseph to fear not to take unto thee
[1:58] Mary thy wife God had already considered
[2:02] Mary as Joseph's wife even though they
[2:05] were not physically living together and
[2:06] had not had any sexual relations yet we
[2:10] then understand that God takes
[2:12] engagements and vows very seriously even
[2:15] though most people do not today
[2:18] the second term is bound which is
[2:21] directly connected to the first word of
[2:23] spouse for bound means to be under more
[2:26] legal obligation to remain faithfully
[2:28] married to one spouse until one spouse
[2:30] dies once the couple vows to be married
[2:34] and become espoused they're bound for
[2:36] their entire lives as Romans 7 1 through
[2:39] 3 teaches though he not brethren for I
[2:42] speak to them that know the law how that
[2:44] their law has dominion over man as long
[2:46] as he liveth for the woman which
[2:48] happened husband is bound by the law to
[2:50] her husband so long as he liveth but if
[2:54] the husband be dead she is loosed from
[2:56] the law of her husband so then if while
[2:59] her husband liveth she be married to
[3:00] another man she shall be called an
[3:02] adulteress but if her husband be dead
[3:04] she is free from that law so that she is
[3:06] no adulteress though she be married to
[3:09] another man a married couple is bound to
[3:12] one another until death the life is
[3:14] under the law of a husband in the New
[3:17] Testament a divorce does not free or
[3:19] loose a person from being bound to their
[3:22] first spouse Jesus thought this truth
[3:25] when he said what therefore God hath
[3:27] joined together let not man put asunder
[3:29] in Matthew 19 verse 6 anyone who
[3:33] divorces their first spouse and marries
[3:35] another is living in the sin of adultery
[3:37] because they are bound to the law of
[3:40] their first spouse they're under moral
[3:42] obligation to remain married to that
[3:44] person until death
[3:47] this truth of married couples being
[3:50] bound until death was clearly seen in
[3:52] the life of Herod Antipas and Herodias
[3:55] during the Ministry of John the Baptist
[3:57] and the Lord Jesus John the Baptist was
[4:00] put in prison by Herod because John the
[4:02] Baptist told him it was not lawful for
[4:05] her to be married to Herodias for
[4:07] Herodias had a living husband already
[4:09] which was Herod's stepbrother Philip
[4:13] Mark 6 17 through 18 for Herod himself
[4:17] had sent forth and laid hold upon John
[4:20] and bound him in prison for Herodias
[4:22] sake his brother Philips wife for he had
[4:25] married her for John had sent unto Herod
[4:28] it is not lawful for thee to have thy
[4:30] brother's wife this leads into our third
[4:34] term which is adultery adultery is
[4:37] defined as voluntary sexual intercourse
[4:39] between a married man and someone other
[4:42] than his first wife or between a married
[4:44] woman and someone other than her first
[4:46] husband adultery includes anyone who is
[4:50] living with a second third or more
[4:52] husband or wife and yet already has a
[4:54] living spouse from a first marriage they
[4:56] no longer live with as plainly taught by
[4:58] Christ Jesus in Matthew chapter 5 verse
[5:01] 32 when I say unto you that whosoever
[5:04] shall put away his wife saving for the
[5:06] cause of fornication causes her to
[5:08] commit adultery and whosoever shall
[5:10] marry her that is divorced committeth
[5:12] adultery this was the situation of Herod
[5:16] Antipas and Herodias who were living in
[5:19] adultery and rebuked by the Prophet John
[5:21] the Baptist for their unlawful marriage
[5:23] because Herodias was already bound by
[5:25] the law of God to her first husband
[5:27] Phillip but she failed to remain
[5:29] faithfully married to him which made her
[5:31] inherit Antipas adulterers in the sight
[5:34] of God
[5:37] the fourth term is fornication which is
[5:40] any voluntary sexual act committed
[5:42] between two unmarried people any sexual
[5:45] activity before marriage this term can
[5:48] be understood by reading 1st Corinthians
[5:50] 7 verse 2 nevertheless to avoid
[5:52] fornication let every man have his own
[5:55] wife and let every woman have her own
[5:57] husband a fifth term is divorce which is
[6:01] the act of legally ending a marriage and
[6:03] is mentioned in Matthew 19 verse 7 the
[6:06] New Testament also uses the words put
[6:08] away to mean divorce Matthew 19 verse 7
[6:12] they say in the end why did Moses then
[6:14] command to give a writing of divorcement
[6:15] and to put her away
[6:17] he served unto them Moses because of the
[6:20] hardness of your hearts suffered you to
[6:22] put away your wives but from the
[6:24] beginning it was not so today a divorce
[6:28] may dissolve a marriage in the eyes of
[6:30] the law but not in the eyes of God for
[6:32] every couples bound to their first
[6:34] spouse until death according to Romans 7
[6:37] 1 through 3 Jesus himself taught that
[6:40] there is only one situation in which
[6:42] divorce and remarriage is permitted and
[6:44] we will teach on that soon in this video
[6:46] series Jesus taught that God permitted
[6:50] divorce and remarriage in the Old
[6:51] Testament but now in the New Testament
[6:53] God was requiring that married couples
[6:56] go back to the standard of the beginning
[6:58] when one man married one woman and were
[7:01] never divorced or put asunder Jesus is
[7:03] teaching then condemns anyone engaging
[7:06] in polygamy which is a marriage in which
[7:08] a spouse of either sex may have more
[7:10] than one mate at the same time a sixth
[7:15] term is depart or separate which is to
[7:18] cease from living together as a married
[7:20] couple but not yet legally divorced as
[7:22] taught in 1st Corinthians 7 verses 10
[7:24] through 11 and unto the married I
[7:27] command yet not i but the Lord let not
[7:30] the wife depart from her husband Beth
[7:32] and if she depart let her remain
[7:34] unmarried or be reconciled to her
[7:36] husband and let not the husband put away
[7:38] his wife notice the st. Paul taught that
[7:42] the Lord permitted married couples to
[7:43] depart or separate from one another for
[7:46] serious reasons but never permitted
[7:48] remarriage to a different person
[7:50] to departing or leaving for that would
[7:52] be adultery after a separation the
[7:56] couple has only two options if they want
[7:58] to honor God either remain separated and
[8:01] unmarried to anyone else or reconcile
[8:04] and get back together resuming their
[8:06] marriage if a couple cannot get along
[8:08] through the serious reasons the couple
[8:10] may separate and not live together but
[8:13] the couple cannot marry someone else or
[8:15] they will be living in a battery
[8:16] according to Jesus in Matthew 19 verse 9
[8:20] whosoever shall put away his wife except
[8:22] it be for fornication and shall marry
[8:24] another committeth adultery and whoso
[8:27] marrieth her which is put away doth
[8:29] commit adultery
[8:32] a seventh and final term is the word
[8:36] whoremonger or whoremonger is a
[8:39] male is a female these words can
[8:44] mean a man or woman who prostitutes his
[8:46] or her body to another's lust for hire
[8:49] or a male/female prostitute or a man or
[8:52] woman who indulges in unlawful sexual
[8:55] intercourse for gain or lust
[8:59] whoremongers those who indulge in
[9:01] unlawful sexual relationships without
[9:04] repenting and changing their lives which
[9:06] can also be considered either adopters
[9:08] or fornicators will be condemned by God
[9:11] and burned the lake of fire according to
[9:13] Revelation 21 verse 8 but the fearful
[9:16] and unbelieving and the abominable and
[9:19] murderers and whoremongers and sorcerers
[9:21] and idolaters and all Liars shall have
[9:25] their part in the lake which burneth
[9:27] with fire and brimstone which is the
[9:29] second death
