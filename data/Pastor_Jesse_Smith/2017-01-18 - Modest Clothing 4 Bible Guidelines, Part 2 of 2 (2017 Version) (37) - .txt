In this updated version of our video from 2015, Part 2 now covers the third and fourth Bible guidelines for modest clothing, which are (3) wear clothes that are gender-specific and (4) wear clothes that are loose, long, and flowing. We added a short portion about the disobedience of Bruce Jenner and his defiance of Deuteronomy 22:5. Lastly, we also added a request for Spirit-filled Christians to pray and see if God would lead them into more modesty, especially with covering up more of their legs (from the knee down to the foot).
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] the third Bible guideline is where clothing that pertains to your gender if you're a man you should wear men's clothing if you're a woman you should wear women's clothing the following scriptures teach on this guideline Deuteronomy 225 and Hebrews 4 15 the woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man neither shall a man put on a woman's garment for all though that do so are an Abomination unto the Lord thy God this is an Old Testament scripture but you must recall that Jesus never crossdressed like a woman we come to this conclusion because the Bible teaches Jesus never broke one commandment in the Old Testament and crossdressing was strictly forbidden in the law of Moses in the Old Testament for we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin furthermore this means Jesus instituted the New Testament and the kingdom of God upon this Earth while upholding the truth that men and women should dress different with separate clothing separate clothing for men and women is a teaching we must follow in the New Testament because Jesus modeled and lived this standard before us when he brought out the New Testament these scriptures prove that God-fearing obedient Jewish men and women had separate inner and outer garments in the days of Jesus Jesus was one of those God-fearing obedient followers of the law of Moses in the days of Jesus men and women could be easily differentiated visually just by looking at their outer clothing this is the way God wanted his Society to operate a society with defined god-given roles easily determined by gender and outer clothing when gender and clothing becomes hard to determine a state of confusion occurs which is a state of Babble and God is not the author of confusion according to 1 Corinthians 14:33 this obvious confusion was recently manifested in 2015 when Bruce Jenner publicly came out as being transgender and changed his name to Caitlyn this act was both widely praised and heavily scrutinized according to the Bible in Deuteronomy 22:5 we believe God considers this act an Abomination because a man Bruce Jenner is wearing the clothes of a woman what most people do not realize though is that this same public scrutiny that Bruce Jenner received partly for his crossdressing as a woman was the same public scrutiny that women such as Marlene Dietrich and Katherine hebburn receed for wearing pants and dressing as men in the 1930s and 1940s which was not even a 100 years ago the undeniable history of the scrutiny of women crossdressing by wearing pants has been fully documented by many resources one of which includes the book women in pants by Katherine Smith and Cynthia grig here is a simple visual to show what modern-day modesty should look like according to the Bible in society today we believe men should wear shirts and pants and women should wear long dresses or blouses and long skirts today's American society is quickly becoming a complete and total perversion of God standard for separate clothing for the entire history of our country the majority of men and women obeyed the Bible guideline of separate clothing for men and women it wasn't until the 1970s that it became socially acceptable for women to wear pants please watch the video long dresses in the Bible for an in-depth study into these facts the fourth and final Bible guideline is we should wear clothes on earth like Jesus wears in heaven which are loose long and flowing clothes the following scriptures that teach this guideline are Revelation 1113 Revelation 79 and14 and Luke 11:2 as stated earlier scripture teaches we should at least cover the area from the chest or breast all the way down to the thighs for those body parts are nakedness in the sight of God while God is well pleased when we cover those body parts as seen in this visual we also feel the Heavenly example of Jesus covering his body down to the feet should be taken into consideration by Spirit-filled Christians today true Christians desire to stay as far away from sin as possible in an effort to keep anyone from stumbling this is why we encourage all Christians to pray and seek God's face to see whether God would have them to cover more of their legs even down to their feet as to follow the Heavenly example of the Lord Jesus Christ in Revelation 1:3 St John the disciple whom Jesus loved saw a vision of Jesus in his glorified body as Supreme deity Jesus was clothed in a garment down to the foot and in the midst of the seven candles sticks one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and gir about the paps with a golden girdle notice that Jesus was not showing off toned muscular arms abs legs and thighs like many people do today he was not showing off any body part Jesus was clothed in a modest way if Jesus Christ chooses to gladly wear modest clothing in heaven that covers his body all the way down to his ankles then we want to lovingly follow his example here on Earth and wear clothes down to our feet today Jesus taught us to pray and say let it be done on Earth as it is in heaven when we wear modest clothes that cover our bodies even down to our ankles we are letting the clothing style of Heaven come down to earth Jesus is the great Shepherd according to Hebrews 13: 20 he leads the way for the sheep to follow Jesus as a man models complete modesty and Holiness in the clothing he wears this means that all men and women today should follow in the example Jesus left and wear modest clothing at all times in our opinion that's the real Measure of a Man he leads the way for modesty for Holiness in every aspect of his life he does not ask the women to do something that he does not do himself if we read further in the Book of Revelation we find that all Christians that are washed in the blood of Jesus will wear white robes in heaven and these robes extend to the feet and I said unto him sir thou knowest and he said to me these are they which came out of Great Tribulation and have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb if we are going to spend all eternity with modest robes that cover our bodies according to the command and design of God God himself then we're happy to start wearing the same type of modest clothing right now the Greek word for robes means a loose outer garment for men extending to the feet so this scripture provides yet another witness that we must seek to cover as much of our bodies as possible whether we are male or female in closing we pray that your prayer will be something like this Lord help me to dress modestly since it is your new testament Bible command forgive me of dressing immodestly I want to change my life completely I want to please you in everything making my body a living sacrifice for you perfecting Holiness in the fear of God I love you dear Jesus and I know that without Holiness no man shall see you because you're the Lord I want your Bible to be my guideline for how I dress I will not look to Hollywood or anyone else for my standard I will look to Jesus and his example as taught through the Holy Bible if you would like more Bible teaching about modest clothing and also more historical references about the changes in clothing in the United States please contact us God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your [Music] heart
