TRANSCRIPT
========================================
the bible has laid out the order in how repentance happens first god sends us a messenger or preacher so we can hear the gospel or good news preached to us romans 10 13 for whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord shall be saved how then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without a preacher and how shall they preach except they be sent as it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring glad tidings of good things first corinthians 1 verse 18 for the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness but unto us which are saved it is the power of god second we must listen to the preacher and hear the bad news and the good news the bad news is that we are sinners that love sin more than god living under the power of satan the power of darkness if we do not repent of our sins we will surely be judged and sent to the lake of fire as part of the eternal judgment of god according to revelation chapter 20 verse 13 and hebrews 6 verse 2. the good news is that jesus can deliver us from the power of satan and turn us to the power of god that we may receive forgiveness of sins and an eternal inheritance to open their eyes and to turn them from darkness to light and from the power of satan unto god that they may receive forgiveness of sins and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me now after that john was put in prison jesus came into galilee preaching the gospel the kingdom of god and saying the time is fulfilled and the kingdom of god is at hand repent ye and believe the gospel luke 24 46 and said unto them thus it is written and thus it behooved christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations beginning at jerusalem the only way to have the power of god is for us to repent change our minds our actions make amends for our sins and hate or abhor our sins after listening to the preacher the third step is to truly repent each of us must decide to change our minds and actions make amends for our sins and hate our sins we must confess our sins to jesus and call upon the name of the lord who is jesus christ this experience of true repentance is the moment we recognize and experience our salvation our deliverance from our sins by grace through faith in the good news or the gospel you are saved romans 10 13 for whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord shall be saved shortly after genuinely repenting the bible and jesus commanded us to be baptized just like the ethiopian eunuch in acts 8 verses 26-40 he was immediately baptized after hearing philip preach christ to him please see the video on water baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ when you're ready for this wonderful step fourthly after repenting new christians are then to follow jesus by learning to observe all his commands according to matthew 28 verse 20. this is called being a disciple or learner of jesus as you grow as a christian you will learn to die out more and more to your fleshly desires which is what jesus taught in mark 10 verses 17 through 29 in verse 21 jesus said come take up the cross and follow me a cross represents a slow cruel death following jesus means slowly dying to your own desires and wants jesus said he that taketh not his cross and fileth after me is not worthy of me in matthew 10 38. once you have obeyed and grown in the gospel taking up your cross of slow death to the lust of your flesh at some point jesus will baptize you with the holy ghost as acts chapter 2 verse 38 and chapter 5 verse 32 teaches then peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost and we are his witnesses of these things and so is also the holy ghost whom god has given to them that obey him we believe it is a tragedy that most christian ministries do not teach believers to receive the baptism of the holy ghost after they repent most ministries today teach that when a person repents they are already baptized with the holy ghost at that moment but that is not the case in the bible acts 8 verses 5-17 teaches that philip went into samaria and baptized men and women but they were not yet filled with the holy ghost peter and john came to samaria and prayed for them that they might receive the holy ghost and then the holy ghost fell on them acts chapter 10 teaches how cornelius and his house were all filled with the holy ghost while peter preached the word to them beforehand cornelius already knew about jesus according to verses 37 and 38 and participated in humble acts of godliness like constant prayers and alms giving but what he needed was the baptism or filling of the holy ghost which god gave to him through the preaching of peter acts 18 verses 24 through chapter 19 verse 7 also teaches that believers can believe that jesus is the christ or messiah and yet still not be baptized with the holy ghost saint paul came to these christians who had believed yet they had not been filled or baptized with the holy ghost after he prayed for them they were born again as the holy ghost came upon them ephesians 1 verse 13 gives more proof of this as it says after that ye believed you were sealed with that holy spirit of promise recall also that 11 out of the 12 apostles that jesus called believed he was the christ from matthew 16 verses 15 through and john chapter 6 verse 69 all of these apostles were a part of his ministry for about three and a half years and yet none of them were filled with a holy ghost until fifty days after his resurrection on the day of pentecost in acts chapter 2 verse 4 and they were all filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance what a gross heir it would be for us to tell people they are filled with the holy ghost and power when they are not especially when their lives do not manifest this power of holiness this is why so many people make a decision to be a christian but later fall away they never receive the holy ghost and power to keep them on fire for jesus all the days of their lives like peter and paul and all the apostles had god will help each one of us to understand the order of repentance that we might continue serving and loving god until we receive the baptism of the holy ghost sometime after we believe since jesus taught few would be saved and able to walk the narrow road that leads to eternal life it must be true that many christian preachers today are not telling the people what they need to repent of so what do you and i need to repent of a faithful preacher may begin with jesus's words and then move to saint paul's words and preach to you about the sins that defile you if the following sins are not repented of the person will be guilty on judgment day and they will not inherit the kingdom of god and will be sent to the lake of fire as condemnation for their love of sin and refusal to be delivered by the power of jesus christ in matthew chapter 15 verses 16 through 20 jesus names seven sins in the new testament not the old testament that defile men and women today evil thoughts which is thinking anything that is not holy murders which is ending someone's life but jesus also said having the spirit of murder is the same as doing the literal act in matthew 5 verses 21-22 adulteries which are sexual acts which a married person commits with anyone else other than their legal spouse fornications which are sexual acts committed before two people are legally married it is critical that we point out that fornication and adultery can be committed in people's hearts and minds and god will hold them responsible on the day of judgment if they don't change their ways jesus taught this in matthew 5 verses 27 and 28 believers should stop watching movies that have sex scenes then and tv shows they should stop looking at pornography and abstain from daydreaming about sexual encounters true repentance is to change your mind and then hate any and all sexual sin whether it is committed physically or spiritually in your mind thefts or extortion which are stealing and robbing false witness which is lying blasphemies which are slanders of speech that injure or hurt god's name using the name of the lord in vain the recent movie called the wolf on wall street used the name of jesus and god in vain over 70 times christians should not pay money or support any movie that blasphemes the holy name of jesus christ as saint paul taught us to put off blasphemy in colossians 3 verse 8. it is only the spirit of the devil that will blaspheme the holy name of jesus as revelation chapter 13 verses 4 through 6 teaches next we will quote saint paul who added 16 more new testament sins for a total of 23 we will share on this video these sins are found in first corinthians chapter 6 verses 9 and 10 and galatians 5 verses 19 through 21 all those who commit these sins without repenting shall not inherit the kingdom of god idolatry which is the worship or reverence of anything other than god many people today worship their cars american idols athletes money and so forth anything that receives the praise and adoration that god deserves is an idol effeminate which is child molestation abusers of themselves with mankind which are sodomites and homosexuals covetousness and envy which is being greedy of gain eager to have more of what belongs to others drunkards which is becoming intoxicated by any form of alcohol revilers or railers those who complain or protest rashly against god uncleanness lustful or luxurious living which is unbridled excess lust without any sense of shame lawlessness witchcraft which is sorcery magical satanic arts poisoning administering of drugs hatred which is enmity intense dislike or ill will variance which is contention heated disagreements maintained in arguments emulation fierce jealousy rivalry that's pursued wrath passionate anger a boiling up strife a desire to put oneself forward in front of others electioneering for some position seditions dissensions and divisions heresies teaching your own tenants opinions to your own followers revelings nocturnal riotous frolicksome loud parties that go late into the night that was quite a list of sins but that is what the bible and jesus teach us these are the sins jesus taught himself and preached in the new testament not the old testament these are the sins that defile mankind and separate him from god if you are honest with yourself you are probably guilty of many of these sins your list of sins is probably a mile long without a true repentance from your sins you will face eternal judgment and separation from god almighty like those in matthew 7 verses 21 through 23 these people did works in the name of jesus you might do works in the name of jesus but their lives were still filled with sin and wickedness and iniquity may god help us to get all the sin wickedness and iniquity out of our lives thankfully the cross of jesus christ is the answer for all of us you
