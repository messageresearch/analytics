[34:32] what
[34:36] [Music]
[34:41] before our
[34:48] we find us
[35:04] [Music]
[35:15] reporter was reporting how they they
[35:17] thought there's gonna be a lot of travel
[35:18] this weekend because
[35:19] all the lockdowns i think that's true
[35:22] for us don't you
[35:24] a lot of people traveling yeah just kind
[35:26] of tired of being inside you know being
[35:28] at the same place so
[35:30] we're thankful for god's amazing grace
[35:32] amen
[35:33] i remember nights on wednesday nights at
[35:35] the waterloo place where i think it
[35:36] would just be
[35:36] malachi and myself and lydia a couple
[35:39] services
[35:40] and we just have a couple people on the
[35:42] phone hookup
[35:43] you know at one time there was one
[35:45] service where i was preaching just to
[35:46] the phone
[35:47] it was empty it was an empty
[35:49] congregation because i think they were
[35:50] using the restroom so
[35:52] never discouraged us because we know the
[35:53] angels are encamped around those that
[35:55] fear the lord
[35:56] you know there's angels here and they're
[35:58] hearing our needs they're ministering to
[36:00] our needs
[36:00] and so we're thankful for the holy
[36:02] spirit praise god let's go to uh
[36:04] philippians chapter three we'd like to
[36:05] continue on this
[36:06] uh book of philippians
[36:12] part 11 and we'll continue looking at
[36:15] this thought
[36:19] so philippians 3
[36:22] i want to pick up where we left off you
[36:24] know we kind of left off on verse nine
[36:26] so i like to read
[36:27] nine and ten philippians three nine and
[36:38] ten
[36:46] praise the lord
[36:49] what a great uh testimony paul gives us
[36:52] and
[36:52] what an attitude that we can all mimic
[36:54] right we can all imitate this
[36:56] and ask the holy spirit to uh let this
[36:58] mind that was in paul
[37:00] be in us because we know it was the mind
[37:02] of christ
[37:03] so let's read nine and ten together then
[37:04] we got memory verse
[37:06] uh philippians 3 9-10
[37:10] on 3 1 2 3 and being found
[37:14] in him not having mine own righteousness
[37:17] which is of the law but that which is
[37:20] through the faith of christ
[37:22] the righteousness which is of god by
[37:25] faith
[37:26] that i may know him and the power of his
[37:29] resurrection
[37:30] and the fellowship of his sufferings
[37:33] being made conformable
[37:34] unto his death let's go to matthew 6
[37:38] 30.
[37:49] matthew 6 30 down to 34.
[37:56] let's begin on three one two three
[37:59] wherefore
[38:00] if god so clothed the grass of the field
[38:03] which today
[38:04] is and tomorrow is cast into the oven
[38:07] shall he not much more clothe you o ye
[38:11] of little faith therefore take no
[38:14] thought
[38:14] saying what shall we eat or what shall
[38:17] we drink
[38:18] or wherewithal shall we be clothed for
[38:21] after
[38:21] all these things do the gentiles seek
[38:24] for your heavenly father
[38:25] knoweth that ye have need of all these
[38:28] things
[38:28] but seek ye first the kingdom of god and
[38:31] his righteousness
[38:33] and all these things shall be added unto
[38:35] you
[38:36] take therefore no thought for the morrow
[38:39] for the morrow shall take thought for
[38:40] the things of itself
[38:42] sufficient unto the day is the evil
[38:45] thereof let's have one more word of
[38:46] prayer if we can
[38:47] that's it if you have a need on your
[38:48] heart let's just make it known unto god
[38:49] here
[38:50] god sees all of our needs here heavenly
[38:52] father god we love you we love singing
[38:54] to you lord you are good and gracious

[39:19] let us rejoice in your word lord we pray
[39:21] today

[39:38] being seated praise god
[39:44] have some slides already i can switch
[39:46] over whenever you're ready
[39:52] so lord willing we'll try to labor on
[39:54] this thought by god's grace we'll keep
[39:56] going and continue on we might even
[39:59] finish on wednesday we'll see how
[40:01] how we go today by the grace of the lord
[40:05] all right great now there's one thing uh
[40:10] just wanna update you on uh we had uh
[40:15] well a couple things you know i'm almost
[40:16] done with that last chapter 13.
[40:18] um right now i'm writing about how
[40:20] people have falsely claimed to be elijah
[40:23] so john alexander dowie in 1901
[40:26] claimed to be elijah and then he died in
[40:28] 1906. now look at look at that
[40:30] right before brother brown was born in
[40:32] 1909 and so that's scriptural people
[40:35] will catch
[40:36] people will catch the the prophecy
[40:38] that's supposed to be fulfilled brother
[40:39] man said
[40:40] they live under that there's prophecy
[40:42] going on but if they don't wait on the
[40:44] lord
[40:45] then they'll get all mixed up so he was
[40:48] a genuine preacher which had
[40:49] a lot of genuine uh healings history
[40:52] said he had he won a hundred
[40:53] lawsuits over um
[40:57] corrupt clergymen and also doctors that
[41:01] said
[41:01] all of his healings weren't real but
[41:03] they took him to court and he won
[41:06] but he kind of got mixed up and he was
[41:07] like building an empire over there in
[41:09] illinois you probably
[41:10] it's actually called the city of zion in
[41:12] illinois
[41:13] he's the one who founded that um
[41:17] and so it was a it was a just quite a
[41:19] thing there to see that he caught that
[41:21] anointing right before the real one came
[41:24] and that's scripture
[41:26] uh right like uh jesus
[41:29] you know remember gamalia told uh peter
[41:31] and all them he
[41:32] he said remember theodis rose up right
[41:35] before
[41:36] this group rose up and then he said
[41:37] judas of galilee rose up and they
[41:39] they boasted that they were someone
[41:41] right and he said they
[41:43] they pulled men after themselves making
[41:45] themselves great but they came to naught
[41:48] they perished and uh and that's what
[41:50] gamea was saying he said let these
[41:51] christians alone
[41:52] if it's not of god it'll come to naught
[41:55] like it'll
[41:55] it'll come out to nothing he said but if
[41:57] it's of god you're fighting against god
[42:00] and so see their church and remember
[42:02] then jesus repeats it remember matthew
[42:04] 24 24 he said false christ
[42:06] many false christs and prophets will
[42:08] arise saying lo
[42:10] he's in the wilderness right so we see
[42:12] the same thing is going to increase
[42:13] today
[42:14] there's going to be people that
[42:15] recognize my the rapture soon
[42:17] and they're going to exalt themselves as
[42:19] as being some messiah or some
[42:21] some great one but but jesus said you'll
[42:24] know them by their fruits
[42:26] you know them by their lifestyle watch
[42:28] how they live if their life doesn't
[42:30] imitate christ or imitate paul it's the
[42:33] wrong fruit it's corrupt fruit praise
[42:35] god
[42:36] and so i just want to remind you of that
[42:37] that that's what we're seeing now today
[42:40] people rising up and saying they're
[42:42] especially around the message they say
[42:43] they're the eighth messenger or they say
[42:45] uh they're the they're the they're the
[42:47] prophet they're the prophet that was to
[42:49] come
[42:49] a lot of people rise up and say that a
[42:51] lot of people are
[42:52] you know following brother man's son and
[42:54] believe he's the last prophet to the age
[42:56] he doesn't make himself out to be that
[42:58] as far as i know but people make that
[43:00] out but see it's just they're living
[43:02] under this
[43:03] uh this prophecy and we've got to make
[43:05] sure church we stay right between the
[43:07] middle of the road praise god
[43:08] god is going to help us do that by god's
[43:10] grace so i'm working on that
[43:12] and then lord willing this week i'll
[43:13] have my next video out tape boys are not
[43:15] in jesus's five full ministry
[43:17] so it's about 40 minutes long right now
[43:19] i was working on this morning i'm almost
[43:21] done
[43:21] hopefully this week it'll come out so
[43:23] looking forward to that
[43:24] uh by god's grace brother cam's reading
[43:28] the book so far he says he's really
[43:29] enjoying it so
[43:30] uh i appreciate brother km doing that
[43:32] for us he really helped me the most on
[43:34] the last book
[43:35] and so i'm trusting that god will use
[43:37] him to help me out on this one as well
[43:39] by god's grace okay so let's look here
[43:42] uh to this uh this text what a beautiful
[43:45] text
[43:45] philippians three uh beautiful book the
[43:48] whole thing has been
[43:49] uh but let's pick up where we left off
[43:51] on wednesday we
[43:52] preached now through galatians ephesians
[43:55] and now we're almost through philippians
[43:58] praise god so we looked at uh let's
[44:01] review here briefly by god's grace
[44:03] uh we preached wednesday where paul says
[44:05] we're to rejoice
[44:07] and then immediately after he tells him
[44:09] to rejoice he said beware of dogs
[44:11] and her brother branham say it yesterday
[44:13] he said how a dog will return to its
[44:15] vomit
[44:15] and then brother brahm said how come
[44:17] these preachers don't know the very
[44:19] false doctrines that made him sick
[44:21] don't they know if they go back it's
[44:22] going to make him sick again
[44:24] he said that on once more lord from 63
[44:28] and and that's what that's what a lot of
[44:31] that's a lot of the clue that people are
[44:33] preachers are dogs when they they they
[44:36] say they leave revelation
[44:38] i'm sorry they leave the worldly habits
[44:39] behind but then they go back to it
[44:42] we've got to make sure i thank god we
[44:43] have honest saints here if amen or hula
[44:45] or my wife or
[44:46] anybody ever bang if they ever see us go
[44:49] back to things we left in the world
[44:50] they have they're about duty bound to
[44:52] come tell me about it
[44:53] right because we have to we're
[44:55] responsible for our own church we're not
[44:56] responsible for any other church
[44:58] we're responsible for our church and
[45:00] paul said beware the dogs
[45:02] the dogs that they may look good for a
[45:05] while
[45:06] but they'll they'll take you back to sin
[45:09] and remember dogs like wolves remember
[45:10] we have had dreams of wolves beware of
[45:13] wolves
[45:14] beware of those who want to defile your
[45:17] spiritual life
[45:19] who want to uh destroy you hurt your
[45:22] influence right
[45:23] that's okay if they destroy your
[45:25] influence to other people god will raise
[45:26] up other people you can influence amen
[45:29] i'm a witness of it praise god god might
[45:32] shut off a channel there but he'll open
[45:33] up another channel praise god
[45:35] yeah if he closes one door he'll open
[45:38] another praise god
[45:39] in a real church we have this confidence
[45:42] you can't deceive
[45:43] god's elect praise god if somebody's
[45:45] telling a lie on you or someone's trying
[45:46] to bite you or something like that that
[45:48] hurt you
[45:48] don't be discouraged the elect cannot be
[45:50] deceived praise god
[45:52] god won't let these true people be
[45:53] deceived because he knows they want
[45:55] truth
[45:56] and he's obligated to show them truth
[45:59] so see we and then he says in verse uh
[46:02] uh he says we must worship in the spirit
[46:04] i believe it's verse
[46:07] uh sorry where am i yeah verse three
[46:10] he says we're the circumcision which
[46:12] worship god in the spirit
[46:14] and rejoice in christ jesus so the
[46:17] happiest times are not when we build a
[46:19] new church
[46:20] or not when we uh we get special
[46:22] donations
[46:23] our happiest times is when the presence
[46:25] of jesus christ
[46:26] is felt amongst us amen think about our
[46:30] happiest services when are they
[46:32] when people are at the altar people
[46:33] getting healed people coming for the
[46:35] holy ghost right
[46:36] god's word made alive when you recognize
[46:39] god's presence
[46:40] that's what real believers rejoice in
[46:42] the most praise god
[46:44] i remember i told you that you know
[46:45] steve algenate i went to that apostolic
[46:47] church there
[46:48] over in talmadge a few years ago and i
[46:50] watched during
[46:51] worship service those boys and girls
[46:54] they were in their teens
[46:55] they took turns running around the
[46:56] church and they're all clapping the
[46:57] children you remember when we went there
[46:59] lydia does i don't know if anybody in
[47:00] case she does
[47:02] but the biggest shout wasn't during that
[47:04] time the biggest shot was when they said
[47:06] we raised 50 000 for the new church and
[47:09] it went that was the loudest shout in
[47:10] the church
[47:11] and i thought i instantly just caught
[47:13] that i said that's not right
[47:14] and now the scripture becomes a reality
[47:16] to me our our
[47:18] our most rejoicing our happiest times
[47:21] is when we feel god's presence amen
[47:23] praise god
[47:24] not for natural things right that's to
[47:27] me that's confidence in the flesh right
[47:29] we don't we don't want to have any
[47:31] confidence in the flesh or things are
[47:32] our flesh can do we want to have
[47:34] confidence in the holy spirit praise god
[47:37] amen and so we thank god for his mercy
[47:39] i'm sorry i forgot to tap that
[47:41] and he and then he tells us do not trust
[47:43] in the flesh
[47:44] have no confidence in what you can do
[47:48] right and then he gives examples like
[47:51] your
[47:52] who are you who's your family members
[47:54] who your local church is right because
[47:56] he talks about the jews and
[47:57] he was circumcised the eighth day and
[47:59] things that he could trust in in his
[48:01] flesh now i got a list of them here
[48:03] we'll go over in just a moment paul lost
[48:06] everything church
[48:07] he lost his fleshly benefits right his
[48:09] his denominational benefits
[48:11] his reputation he lost all of it for
[48:14] christ
[48:15] he went from everybody's favorite to the
[48:17] one they were hunting down
[48:20] remember and then he said at the
[48:21] beginning remember in chapter one in
[48:22] this book he said a lot of people didn't
[48:24] receive me and they got angry when they
[48:26] heard i went in jail
[48:27] and they preached against me but he said
[48:29] that's okay as long as jesus is being
[48:31] preached amen
[48:32] see he didn't worry when people talk bad
[48:34] about him he didn't worry
[48:36] he he realized that jesus christ is
[48:38] fighting for me
[48:39] if i'm standing with him jesus will
[48:41] stand with me please god
[48:43] amen that's the confidence we have
[48:45] paul's only desire
[48:47] was to be found in christ amen
[48:50] in christ's righteousness praise god a
[48:52] partaker of his holiness amen
[48:55] and he knew he couldn't be done by
[48:56] trusting in his
[48:58] past uh where he was raised his as past
[49:02] his original denomination he knew he
[49:04] couldn't trust in that
[49:05] the flesh he had to trust in the holy
[49:07] spirit praise god
[49:09] now here are some examples i was
[49:10] thinking of some examples here's some
[49:13] flesh legalistic ideas people trust in
[49:17] today around the message
[49:19] i'm sure there's more so let's go
[49:20] through these real briefly by god's
[49:22] grace
[49:23] i just thought i'd give you some
[49:24] examples people believe just because
[49:27] they're born in the message
[49:29] or because they have a last name that
[49:31] they are somehow saved
[49:34] now that doesn't save you now church
[49:35] doesn't give you does it give you a
[49:37] close
[49:37] or i'm sorry a close proximity to
[49:39] blessings yes
[49:41] right it gives you a close proximity to
[49:44] hear the word of god
[49:46] that's a blessing praise god remember
[49:48] you know
[49:49] it's a great testimony as we said this a
[49:51] few weeks ago when we had our brother
[49:52] here
[49:53] preaching it's a great testimony to
[49:55] never leave the word and never go out in
[49:57] the world
[49:58] but that's a great testimony but i want
[50:00] to balance that jesus said
[50:02] those that love me the most are those
[50:04] who are forgiven the most praise god
[50:06] so see you can be raised in the message
[50:08] but as long as you know
[50:10] you have much to be forgiven and you
[50:12] love god
[50:13] then you'll be happy praise god amen but
[50:16] if you leave the message and you go on
[50:18] the world
[50:18] but then you come back and repent in
[50:20] tears and thank god
[50:22] for pulling you out of the mirey clay
[50:24] you can love jesus just
[50:26] as much amen because it's based upon
[50:29] your under your gratitude for how much
[50:32] god's forgiven you praise god
[50:34] amen i want to make sure i say that i
[50:37] agree
[50:38] jesus had the greatest testimony that he
[50:40] never left
[50:41] of course no one's ever going to get
[50:42] close to his testimony right but for
[50:45] us we can still have a great testimony
[50:48] no matter
[50:48] whether we leave the message or come
[50:50] back or we stay the whole time
[50:52] it's all based upon our recognition of
[50:55] the power of the cross amen
[50:57] as long as we're trusting in the power
[50:59] of the cross and realize
[51:00] the effects that the cross has had upon
[51:03] our once
[51:04] sinful lives to make us uh uh
[51:07] got holy lovers rather than sin lovers
[51:10] praise god
[51:10] as long as we have that understanding
[51:12] that we can love god in a great way and
[51:15] god will certainly love us
[51:17] glory now i know a church in the message
[51:21] i think they believe
[51:22] all brothers have to wear beards
[51:26] uh and they have to avoid pork they kind
[51:28] of go together because
[51:29] they they keep a lot of the jewish
[51:31] feasts
[51:32] yet they preach brother branham and uh i
[51:35] wrote one about it one time i said well
[51:36] brother branham ain't squirrel
[51:39] and they said yeah we disagree with that
[51:40] we don't think brother ramsay should
[51:41] have ate squirrel
[51:43] like it matters you know but now i don't
[51:47] know if they're in legalism but
[51:48] whenever people go too far it's likely
[51:51] some people in the church
[51:53] feel like they're holier because they
[51:55] don't eat meat
[51:56] right so i i don't know exactly if the
[51:59] leadership
[52:00] uh is making it legalism like if you eat
[52:02] meat and if you brothers don't grow your
[52:04] beards
[52:05] you're backslidden now that's wrong
[52:07] that's wrong because there's nothing in
[52:09] scripture
[52:09] that would tell us that now go to
[52:12] colossians 2 we'll get there lord
[52:13] willing in a couple weeks here
[52:14] but this the next book over colossians 2
[52:22] and uh if you go down to verse
[52:25] 16 this is beautiful i can't wait to
[52:26] preach this in a little bit but uh
[52:30] paul just finished in verse 14 just
[52:32] saying jesus
[52:33] blotted out all the ordinances the
[52:34] jewish ordinances against us
[52:36] nailed them to his cross so in other
[52:39] words the curse the requirement of
[52:41] the requirement if you don't keep 666
[52:44] laws you're guilty of all of them you
[52:47] could keep
[52:47] you could keep 615 but if you break one
[52:50] you're guilty of all of them jesus took
[52:53] that curse
[52:54] and he nailed it to the cross amen and
[52:56] then he says this he said verse 16
[52:58] let no man therefore judge you in meat
[53:01] but yet
[53:02] people that look down upon us if we eat
[53:04] pork now is it probably the healthiest
[53:06] meat probably not
[53:08] right because of what pigs eat my wife
[53:10] and i have talked a little bit about
[53:11] that i can't remember our exact
[53:12] conversations but
[53:14] uh that we know they're not the most
[53:15] cleanest animals
[53:17] uh but they if if any man judge you in
[53:19] meat or in
[53:20] drink or in respect of a holy day
[53:24] or of the new moon or of the sabbath
[53:27] days
[53:28] which are shadow of things to come
[53:31] but the body is christ so all those
[53:34] things are not the body of christ
[53:37] right sabbath days keeping sabbath days
[53:40] and not eating meats and
[53:41] that's not christ right all those things
[53:44] were
[53:45] shadows all those things point to christ
[53:48] amen
[53:48] amen they point to christ how christ
[53:51] cleansed everything that was uncommon
[53:53] praise god
[53:54] everything that was unclean christ
[53:55] cleansed it amen
[53:57] hallelujah and keeping a day doesn't
[54:00] make you holy
[54:00] but keeping christ makes you holy
[54:03] keeping christ
[54:04] letting christ come into your soul and
[54:06] him staying in your soul that keeps you
[54:08] holy praise god
[54:10] how do they not keep it a certain day
[54:14] so see i just want to bring that then he
[54:16] says
[54:17] verse 18 let no man begow you of your
[54:19] reward
[54:20] see of these liberties and we you know
[54:23] like i said we won't go into that now
[54:24] but he just gets done
[54:26] saying jesus did away with all these
[54:29] shadows and you don't have to keep them
[54:31] anymore
[54:32] but yet people around the message they
[54:34] want to do that and that's fine
[54:35] our job is to love all our job is to
[54:38] correct all
[54:39] love all we're supposed to love our
[54:40] friends and our
[54:42] enemies right and if someone makes us an
[54:45] enemy that's okay they're still my
[54:46] friend
[54:47] right that's our desire now here's one
[54:50] that came a couple years ago i don't
[54:51] remember this but amen
[54:53] i wasn't here but brother brian hawkins
[54:54] was preaching over in that sanctuary
[54:56] and two brothers from canada came to our
[54:59] church
[55:00] and uh said we can only play songs
[55:03] in the church that brother branham said
[55:05] and they went around the whole country
[55:07] with amen they got kicked out they got
[55:08] arrested and different not in tennessee
[55:10] they got arrested
[55:11] because they were causing so much chaos
[55:12] and they were trying to use quotes to
[55:14] make it say that
[55:16] that church that's nothing but plain
[55:17] legalism
[55:19] right there's nothing but plain legalism
[55:23] uh and that that is that is so limiting
[55:25] the holy spirit
[55:26] that's like saying the holy spirit you
[55:28] can't write any new songs
[55:30] but yet the bible says sing a new song
[55:32] praise god and pretty soon if you listen
[55:34] to all broadband songs you're going to
[55:35] learn all the songs
[55:36] i mean there will be no more new songs
[55:39] after a while
[55:39] but the holy spirit says sing a new song
[55:42] praise god
[55:44] and the holy spirit is constantly
[55:45] inspiring worship but yet
[55:47] in the cam especially cam especially
[55:49] these men really hurt cam's family as
[55:51] far as with their words
[55:52] uh they attacked him on a wednesday
[55:54] night and they they kind of attacked
[55:56] cam's family with their words
[55:58] so cam bought back he said he fought
[56:00] back and um
[56:02] and cast them away told commanded them
[56:04] to leave
[56:06] so uh that's one i see they have
[56:08] confidence or
[56:09] if they only sing certain songs remember
[56:12] when simon is here we talked a little
[56:13] bit about that
[56:14] and there may there's no doubt some
[56:16] songs that are wrong right there's no
[56:17] songs that are not scriptural and so we
[56:20] can change the lyrics or we cannot sing
[56:22] them at all
[56:23] we have that liberty in christ but see
[56:26] people will clearly
[56:27] uh make themselves holier because their
[56:31] flesh can do that
[56:32] that's something the flesh can do right
[56:34] i can grow my beard
[56:36] i cannot eat meat pork i can just sing
[56:38] brother brand of songs in the
[56:40] there's a song book called the believers
[56:41] or only believe songbook
[56:43] jeffersonville printed it years ago by
[56:45] the amen sisterhood and so people say oh
[56:47] you only can use that songbook
[56:48] brother i've never said that but see see
[56:51] how people
[56:53] see how paul is trying to say don't
[56:54] trust in anything
[56:56] anything your flesh can do don't trust
[56:58] in that trust in jesus's righteousness
[57:02] because remember when you're really
[57:03] walking in the spirit you're walking in
[57:05] gratitude
[57:06] now i'm holy because of what i can do
[57:09] but i'm holy because jesus is in me
[57:10] praise god and then it's it's all
[57:12] thankful it's all gratitude
[57:14] well you don't single songs that's
[57:15] that's fine oh you don't uh
[57:17] you don't shave your face that's fine
[57:19] that we're we're still brothers you know
[57:22] i can still love them praise god and so
[57:24] can you right we can still
[57:26] have the spirit of christ and not have
[57:30] confidence
[57:31] in our flesh now this is one recently uh
[57:37] jeffersonville says you have to have uh
[57:40] i'm sorry they said if you
[57:41] if you're a tape church you that that's
[57:42] a sign of the token
[57:44] so that that's a you know that's a false
[57:46] doctrine
[57:47] if you do that you break ephesians four
[57:49] praise god
[57:50] you can't break a scripture like that
[57:52] now pastor worship is something
[57:54] where especially big name messages
[57:56] preachers
[57:57] not them but many people in their
[57:59] churches they think just because i sit
[58:01] under this
[58:02] well-known preacher i'm saved i've got
[58:04] the holy ghost
[58:06] i just seen a good testimony from a
[58:07] message church a brother who was in his
[58:09] 60s
[58:10] said uh he just got re-baptized he said
[58:12] because i realized
[58:14] for 40 years i've been going to this
[58:15] pastor's church and i was never born
[58:17] again
[58:18] and he said i had an intellectual
[58:19] religious spirit and he was up there
[58:21] weeping and crying
[58:22] now church that's sincerity right there
[58:24] when you realize
[58:25] wow i was i i just got ahead now so see
[58:28] how do you know the difference
[58:29] because you once you leave here you
[58:31] don't live the word
[58:33] amen but when you really love god and
[58:35] really love jesus
[58:36] then you live by every word not just
[58:38] here but especially out there praise god
[58:41] and he realized i haven't been living it
[58:43] i thought what a beautiful testimony
[58:45] they re-baptized him and they the church
[58:47] praised god and
[58:48] i just thought he was praising the lord
[58:50] what a blessing to be free now look
[58:52] that's
[58:52] that's being demons cast out there too
[58:55] because my man said the worst
[58:56] demonic spirit is the religious spirit
[58:59] like the pharisees and sadducees had
[59:02] so see that's one thing we that that
[59:04] becomes a legalistic thing we'll see i
[59:05] go to the bigger church
[59:07] or for us well we go to the smaller
[59:09] church that don't make us anything
[59:11] i know jesus said a little flock but
[59:13] that don't mean us i don't mean it
[59:14] it's just us or any small church that's
[59:17] not what it means
[59:19] uh so people whatever whatever condition
[59:22] people are in satan's trying to get them
[59:24] uh to to have confidence in what they
[59:26] can do rather than what christ does in
[59:28] them
[59:29] amen and then that last one we talked
[59:31] about that short sleeves now i haven't
[59:33] heard that one since probably
[59:35] right when we first came in the message
[59:36] around 2001
[59:38] or 2002 i haven't seen it since then but
[59:40] it's a clear example if a man wears
[59:42] short sleeves
[59:43] he's backslidden is what people have
[59:44] said okay
[59:46] i'll tell you another one too we don't
[59:47] preach on very much but ministers
[59:49] ministers have to marry virgins that's
[59:51] another confidence in the flesh
[59:54] because that's not taught in the bible
[59:55] that's taught in the old testament
[59:57] but that can't come over to the new
[59:59] right because if you take
[1:00:00] because there's so many requirements for
[1:00:02] priests one of them
[1:00:04] is you can't have a blemish in your eye
[1:00:07] well what about paul
[1:00:08] paul was constantly battling eye
[1:00:10] problems well then he's out of
[1:00:11] if he's out we're all out because he
[1:00:13] said
[1:00:15] he said uh he he was made righteous he
[1:00:17] said if you change
[1:00:18] one thing of this word you're cursed
[1:00:22] so if he's if he can't even make it how
[1:00:24] we gonna make it praise god
[1:00:25] he met jesus the spirit you know
[1:00:27] theophany to face i'll say it like that
[1:00:30] not face to face with it but theophany
[1:00:32] jesus's face as a theophany
[1:00:33] to his face he met them or he met jesus
[1:00:36] rather not them
[1:00:37] he met jesus as theophany and so that's
[1:00:40] another one now a lot of people will
[1:00:41] put me on the message for that that's
[1:00:43] fine in their eyes i probably never was
[1:00:45] in the message
[1:00:46] but i know the message is in me that's
[1:00:49] what matters praise god
[1:00:50] i don't have to be in their message
[1:00:52] because i know the message the word of
[1:00:53] god
[1:00:54] is in me amen praise god so kick me out
[1:00:56] do whatever you want
[1:00:57] i'm a holy ghost-filled saint praise god
[1:00:59] i'm going to keep following jesus
[1:01:01] i'm going to keep trying to help them
[1:01:02] out by god's grace
[1:01:04] now so see church what we get then
[1:01:07] paul's talking about when you have
[1:01:08] confidence in the flesh
[1:01:09] you you're you're preaching legalism
[1:01:12] right
[1:01:12] it's something you can do on your own
[1:01:16] right and that's adding to the word
[1:01:18] short sleeves beards
[1:01:19] no pork adding to the word right and if
[1:01:22] you make that like you're
[1:01:24] holier because of that that's added now
[1:01:26] lasciviousness is the opposite
[1:01:28] which is where most churches will get
[1:01:30] caught up here because lasciviousness is
[1:01:32] lawlessness
[1:01:33] look at that lawlessness people say
[1:01:35] we're not under the law
[1:01:37] but lascivious this means lawlessness
[1:01:40] no law so we know we are under the law
[1:01:44] of the holy spirit
[1:01:45] the holy spirit gives us his word and
[1:01:47] we've got to pack out the orders amen
[1:01:50] right that's the law of the holy spirit
[1:01:52] in other words always please the holy
[1:01:54] spirit
[1:01:55] amen so it's not legalism
[1:01:58] but it's it's it's it's plea it's
[1:02:00] obeying the holy spirit
[1:02:02] and doing what he commands us to do
[1:02:06] so see like today they'll take it away
[1:02:08] like women can wear high heels
[1:02:09] or you know it's easiest to understand
[1:02:11] those because it's the most noticeable
[1:02:13] right
[1:02:14] uh
[1:02:17] you know also his families can skip
[1:02:19] church
[1:02:21] and they can be just and they can be
[1:02:22] just as good off that's impossible
[1:02:24] brother
[1:02:25] said you'll never be as good of a
[1:02:26] christian unless you come to the house
[1:02:27] of god
[1:02:29] right because you're gathered with
[1:02:30] saints of like precious faith
[1:02:32] i've heard have you heard preachers
[1:02:33] around the message that they couldn't
[1:02:35] wait till they got back
[1:02:36] in the congregation after coven because
[1:02:39] they felt the people
[1:02:40] we just knew they're getting weaker
[1:02:42] right with because you're not
[1:02:43] with the other people and the bible says
[1:02:45] gather more as you see that day
[1:02:47] approaching very sky
[1:02:49] so we we knew we had to do it for a
[1:02:51] little bit or at least you know try to
[1:02:53] honor
[1:02:53] them but we we believe at some point we
[1:02:56] come back and so
[1:02:57] people are grateful to be back amen
[1:02:59] they're great see they're
[1:03:01] they're grateful to be back following
[1:03:02] the word of god praise god
[1:03:04] now here let's go move on here
[1:03:08] now verse nine sorry
[1:03:11] uh philippians 3 9.
[1:03:18] it says and be found in him so paul
[1:03:21] suffered the loss of all things verse 9
[1:03:23] to be found in him
[1:03:24] not having his own righteousness which
[1:03:26] is of the law
[1:03:27] but that which is through the faith of
[1:03:29] christ
[1:03:30] the righteousness which is of god by
[1:03:33] faith so
[1:03:34] when we have faith in jesus christ and
[1:03:36] truly believe jesus christ
[1:03:38] that faith means trust and have blessed
[1:03:40] assurance when we are assured of jesus's
[1:03:43] word
[1:03:44] it makes us righteous because whatever
[1:03:46] we believe about christ
[1:03:47] impacts our actions whatever you put in
[1:03:50] is going to come out in fact i just
[1:03:52] heard on the radio yesterday
[1:03:54] uh where they were saying music will
[1:03:57] program your
[1:03:58] actions and i thought glory i thought
[1:04:00] that's our good music is programming my
[1:04:02] obedience to jesus amen like that's why
[1:04:05] they crank up
[1:04:06] like the louder the music and uh the
[1:04:08] more it impacts your
[1:04:10] your actions i thought well praise god
[1:04:11] not that we're trying to be too loud
[1:04:13] but what i'm saying is that uh we need
[1:04:15] to worship god
[1:04:16] with our voice the bible said lift your
[1:04:18] voice amen
[1:04:19] amen play loud on the tambourine and the
[1:04:22] symbols amen
[1:04:23] amen and so the holy spirit gets in the
[1:04:26] worship
[1:04:27] and when we worship god it changes our
[1:04:30] behavior that's why a lot of people
[1:04:31] their behavior don't change because they
[1:04:33] don't sing along but amen
[1:04:35] they they don't lift their voice right
[1:04:36] sister they don't raise their hands
[1:04:38] enough
[1:04:39] we you got to get in the spirit of the
[1:04:42] worship and then you'll get in the
[1:04:43] spirit of the word amen
[1:04:46] it's so clear it's so it's so plain
[1:04:48] praise god
[1:04:49] you have we have to get in the spirit
[1:04:52] and then when we get under that worship
[1:04:54] then we receive the word and we live the
[1:04:56] word
[1:04:57] it produces action and behavior in our
[1:05:00] lives praise god
[1:05:03] now he said i know jesus in the power
[1:05:06] of his resurrection see because paul
[1:05:10] had a resurrected life like we have we
[1:05:12] knew we were dead in sins
[1:05:14] we we knew we were lost like that song
[1:05:16] says right
[1:05:17] we knew our loss but jesus raised us up
[1:05:20] out of that life
[1:05:21] so we know him in the power of his
[1:05:24] resurrection
[1:05:25] i've never seen physically dead people
[1:05:27] race a life
[1:05:28] i believe it i know it happens my
[1:05:30] grandpa
[1:05:32] saw it they prayed for it but i know my
[1:05:34] life has been raised
[1:05:36] from a sinful habitual life of sin to a
[1:05:39] life of godly
[1:05:40] fear and obedience to the word of god
[1:05:42] amen
[1:05:43] in other words i've seen resurrection
[1:05:45] power praise god
[1:05:47] amen and then of course with my mom
[1:05:50] being healed of cancer and
[1:05:52] you know and ones that have been close
[1:05:53] to death god brings them back
[1:05:55] because he has the power of resurrection
[1:05:57] amen amen
[1:05:59] yes so paul said that i may know him
[1:06:02] i'll lose everything
[1:06:03] that i can know the power of the
[1:06:05] resurrection and the fellowship of his
[1:06:07] sufferings
[1:06:08] being made conformable unto his death
[1:06:11] so jesus's power and second
[1:06:14] his sufferings make us conformable
[1:06:18] to his death
[1:06:21] how many know that there's a purpose
[1:06:23] behind you dying how many know
[1:06:24] if the rapture don't come you're going
[1:06:26] to die someday well
[1:06:28] jesus's plan is that as you get closer
[1:06:30] to death you become more like him
[1:06:33] and he uses these two things
[1:06:35] resurrection power
[1:06:37] these signs shall follow them that
[1:06:38] believe and he uses sufferings amen
[1:06:42] in order to make you conformable to die
[1:06:45] like christ
[1:06:47] so he'll use supernatural signs miracles
[1:06:49] and wonders but he'll also use suffering
[1:06:51] that you and i must go through
[1:06:53] in order to make us uh be able to live a
[1:06:56] life like christ
[1:06:57] to accept the trials that come our way
[1:07:00] in order to have
[1:07:01] obedience like christ
[1:07:05] okay so let's look at this one here so
[1:07:08] conform means
[1:07:09] receive the same form as so resurrection
[1:07:12] power and suffering
[1:07:14] makes you receive the same death that
[1:07:16] christ received
[1:07:18] like that's why he said take up your
[1:07:19] cross daily and follow him right
[1:07:21] amen it's going to be hard there's going
[1:07:24] to be hard times praise god
[1:07:26] the cross is not going to be easy to
[1:07:27] carry right but god has to allow
[1:07:30] suffering
[1:07:30] to help us die out to all selfishness
[1:07:34] so as time goes on i'll say like this as
[1:07:36] we get closer to the light you've heard
[1:07:37] it said
[1:07:38] we should have we should see more of our
[1:07:40] imperfections displayed
[1:07:43] and that is god's plan if we don't
[1:07:45] something's wrong right
[1:07:47] because as you get closer you you suffer
[1:07:49] more
[1:07:50] right but you also see god's power more
[1:07:53] praise
[1:07:55] hallelujah god where you see it many
[1:07:56] times is in your own life
[1:07:59] you see god change your habits or change
[1:08:01] your mindset or change your attitudes
[1:08:03] praise god
[1:08:05] right although you suffer you're able to
[1:08:08] endure
[1:08:10] now look this reminded me of jesus in
[1:08:12] the days of his flesh remember we have
[1:08:14] to be conformed
[1:08:15] or receive the same death that he did
[1:08:17] well that means
[1:08:18] if he offered up prayers and
[1:08:20] supplications with strong trying
[1:08:22] or strong crying rather in tears
[1:08:25] and was heard then we must do the same
[1:08:28] thing
[1:08:28] he learned obedience by the things he
[1:08:31] suffered
[1:08:32] so all the times he was rejected
[1:08:33] remember his disciples let's call fire
[1:08:35] down from heaven and jesus said you
[1:08:37] don't know what spirit you are of
[1:08:38] but yet he had to suffer rejection he
[1:08:41] had to suffer
[1:08:42] everybody uh saying crucify him crucify
[1:08:45] him
[1:08:46] he had to suffer uh
[1:08:49] just the worst uh the worst evil that
[1:08:52] you could imagine against him
[1:08:54] how'd he get through it he prayed with
[1:08:56] tears
[1:08:58] amen in other words he just had to pray
[1:09:00] about it praise god
[1:09:02] when people come against you and and uh
[1:09:05] times get tough
[1:09:07] all you can do is just pray sometimes
[1:09:10] amen
[1:09:11] god didn't deliver jesus from every
[1:09:13] suffering god let him go through
[1:09:15] through prayers uh and strong crime and
[1:09:18] he just had to endure
[1:09:20] he just had to go another mile praise
[1:09:22] god amen
[1:09:24] remember he never overcame the devil by
[1:09:26] a miracle but yet jesus saw many
[1:09:28] miracles
[1:09:29] but in some of his greatest trials and
[1:09:31] temptations was lucifer himself
[1:09:34] he just had to endure by speaking the
[1:09:36] word
[1:09:37] and he just had to overcome he just had
[1:09:39] to suffer and and
[1:09:41] obey the word of god and then refreshing
[1:09:43] would come after satan left him amen
[1:09:46] satan would leave him for a season and
[1:09:48] the angels of god would minister to him
[1:09:50] praise god
[1:09:53] and then he is the author unto all that
[1:09:56] obey him
[1:09:57] so if jesus had to go through suffering
[1:09:59] and the only thing he could do is pray
[1:10:01] about it and cry about it
[1:10:03] you ever had that ever felt like a cry
[1:10:04] baby always taken your crying to god
[1:10:07] nobody else wants to listen to you maybe
[1:10:10] well you're a lot like jesus then
[1:10:12] because there's some things he just had
[1:10:14] to cry about
[1:10:15] pray about amen and then he would suffer
[1:10:18] through it and keep carrying on amen
[1:10:20] amen
[1:10:22] hallelujah and paul says this is what
[1:10:25] i'm being conformed to
[1:10:26] i'm going to receive the same death
[1:10:29] jesus received
[1:10:30] which they were both martyrs but i'm
[1:10:34] i'm being made ready so i can receive
[1:10:37] that
[1:10:37] through the power of the resurrection
[1:10:40] and the fellowship of his sufferings
[1:10:45] now look he's the author so he wrote the
[1:10:47] book on how to be delivered
[1:10:50] so if he wrote it then he's going to
[1:10:52] make sure it's carried out the same way
[1:10:53] and he's going to make sure it's carried
[1:10:55] out in our lives
[1:10:56] praise god you know many times people
[1:10:59] brother amen many times people don't
[1:11:00] know at the end of service when i cry
[1:11:02] many times i'm crying over the battles i
[1:11:03] go through
[1:11:05] yeah i'm enjoying worshiping god i love
[1:11:06] that but many times i'm just saying god
[1:11:08] give me strength
[1:11:10] help me to help me to love when i get
[1:11:12] slapped or not
[1:11:13] slap physically but uh when i get
[1:11:15] rejected or something like that
[1:11:17] when people say evil things about me
[1:11:18] many times i'm just saying god
[1:11:20] give me grace give me grace to love them
[1:11:22] back
[1:11:25] and that's scripture i'm going to be
[1:11:27] that scripture
[1:11:28] this is how jesus overcome go pray about
[1:11:31] it
[1:11:32] right sometimes you want to run to
[1:11:33] brother sister can you can you help me
[1:11:36] and but really the thing is go pray
[1:11:38] about it that's right your brother
[1:11:40] sister might not be able to help you
[1:11:42] right now sometimes they can right and
[1:11:43] some and i do want your prayers i want
[1:11:45] everybody's prayers
[1:11:46] you want my prayers right but there's
[1:11:48] gonna be times where god is gonna ask
[1:11:50] you
[1:11:50] and just draw your magnet would go over
[1:11:52] all the shavings
[1:11:54] and help clean up the mesh shavings off
[1:11:56] the floor
[1:11:57] between the shifts i remember the story
[1:12:01] uh he said i want to ask you something
[1:12:03] why didn't all them shavings go up he
[1:12:05] said well you see reverend branham
[1:12:06] some of them that magnet won't take said
[1:12:09] it can't go to the magnet because it's
[1:12:10] not magnetized to it
[1:12:12] they're aluminum them aluminum shavings
[1:12:14] won't pick up the magnet i said
[1:12:16] hallelujah
[1:12:16] he said what's the matter with you
[1:12:19] you're in a steel mill
[1:12:20] saying hallelujah what's the matter with
[1:12:22] you i said what's the matter
[1:12:24] that's some iron laying there why didn't
[1:12:26] go up bolt it down
[1:12:28] i said glory to god he said what's the
[1:12:29] matter with you so there's things that
[1:12:32] should have gone up but couldn't
[1:12:34] because they were tied down there's
[1:12:36] things that could have gone up
[1:12:37] but wouldn't because they weren't the
[1:12:39] right quality praise god
[1:12:42] and he said i'm thinking a way back into
[1:12:44] the heavens there's a big magnet called
[1:12:46] the son of god
[1:12:48] there's people being magnetized down
[1:12:50] here oh you might be a shaving or a
[1:12:52] church member
[1:12:53] but brother unless you're magnetized
[1:12:57] through the power of the resurrection
[1:12:59] and conform
[1:13:00] to his power of the son of god
[1:13:04] that one of these days god will press
[1:13:06] the button
[1:13:07] and some of these shackled down people
[1:13:08] with the worldly lusts and pleasures
[1:13:10] will be left here
[1:13:11] with cold formal church members will lay
[1:13:14] there
[1:13:16] so he says if if if if cold church
[1:13:18] members don't go in the rapture it's
[1:13:20] because they didn't
[1:13:21] have the right material praise god in
[1:13:23] other words they weren't made of the
[1:13:25] same material
[1:13:26] they weren't made of the word amen they
[1:13:29] weren't born again
[1:13:30] they didn't have eternal life inside
[1:13:32] them praise god
[1:13:34] he said but them who are born again them
[1:13:36] that are in christ god will bring with
[1:13:38] him in the resurrection going in yonder
[1:13:39] in a big molding pot
[1:13:41] these old frail bodies be molded in it
[1:13:43] and made into his own glorious likeness
[1:13:47] so see we can't let the things of the
[1:13:48] world bolt us down right
[1:13:50] we can't be in other words we can't be
[1:13:52] too closely connected to the world
[1:13:54] we got to be free from the cares of the
[1:13:56] world we got to take care of it i say
[1:13:58] like this i got to take that 30 minutes
[1:14:00] in the morning brother amen pay the
[1:14:01] bills
[1:14:02] i got to email back the the insurance i
[1:14:04] got to email back the the bank person
[1:14:06] but after that i'm not tied to that the
[1:14:09] rest of the day i'm back serving jesus
[1:14:11] amen amen
[1:14:11] i'm back praising god trusting in the
[1:14:13] lord god you're going to take care of
[1:14:15] that business
[1:14:16] deal you're going to take care of this
[1:14:17] you're going to take care of that i'm
[1:14:19] not tied to that
[1:14:20] i'm tied to jesus christ amen so he said
[1:14:23] you're either tied down to the cares of
[1:14:24] the world or you're not the right
[1:14:26] quality
[1:14:26] i want to be free from the things of the
[1:14:28] world and i want to be a real holy
[1:14:29] ghost-filled saint
[1:14:31] amen thank the lord verse 11
[1:14:36] if by any means i might attain unto the
[1:14:38] resurrection of the dead
[1:14:40] my brother adam says this is quite a
[1:14:44] statement any means
[1:14:47] now remember paul goes through remember
[1:14:50] his resume of suffering this is a
[1:14:51] beautiful passage
[1:14:54] he was whipped uh five times
[1:14:57] often in jail being with rods you
[1:15:00] remember this right
[1:15:01] this was his resume of suffering he said
[1:15:03] this is how
[1:15:04] i'm going to know christ through the
[1:15:08] sufferings
[1:15:10] he says i was beaten thrice uh and then
[1:15:12] he says
[1:15:13] i had many journeys perils perils of
[1:15:16] robbers he was robbed many times
[1:15:19] uh in the wilderness perils in the sea
[1:15:22] among false brethren
[1:15:23] in other words any time he could have
[1:15:25] trouble he had trouble
[1:15:28] but he realized all these troubles are
[1:15:30] making me trust
[1:15:31] in christ more amen oh
[1:15:34] if god can just help us to see that this
[1:15:36] morning praise god all of our troubles
[1:15:38] are i'll say like this
[1:15:39] all the looming troubles through the
[1:15:40] government right
[1:15:42] all the looming troubles and all the the
[1:15:44] looming rioting and the evil
[1:15:46] uh riots that are going on and all the
[1:15:48] trouble that's looming around and we
[1:15:50] know is just going to increase
[1:15:52] at some point right all this looming all
[1:15:55] of it will be used
[1:15:56] in order to prepare us for the coming of
[1:15:58] the lord amen
[1:15:59] that's right and paul said it's by any
[1:16:02] means
[1:16:03] he said lord if by any means i want to
[1:16:05] obtain
[1:16:06] unto the resurrection of the dead in
[1:16:09] other words i will suffer
[1:16:11] whatever i have to suffer so i can be at
[1:16:13] the first resurrection
[1:16:18] and this is what brother bam says in the
[1:16:19] church age book he says
[1:16:21] we must not discredit the words of jesus
[1:16:23] who says for summer found the book of
[1:16:25] life
[1:16:26] who will either receive eternal life
[1:16:27] before the general resurrection or after
[1:16:29] it
[1:16:30] paul does not obey this truth because he
[1:16:32] says ephesians philippians 3 11.
[1:16:34] if by any means i might obtain to the
[1:16:36] resurrection of the dead
[1:16:37] now this statement is most peculiar
[1:16:39] isn't it we all know that we're all
[1:16:41] going to
[1:16:42] a resurrection whether we want to or not
[1:16:44] all will be resurrected
[1:16:46] right we know everybody's going to the
[1:16:47] resurrection
[1:16:50] he says this so paul could hardly be
[1:16:52] saying if by any means i might attain
[1:16:54] to a resurrection of the dead the truth
[1:16:57] of the matter he's not saying that
[1:16:58] the literal me reading is if by any
[1:17:01] means i might attain to the out
[1:17:03] resurrection from among the dead
[1:17:05] this is not the attaining to the general
[1:17:07] or second resurrection the white throne
[1:17:09] but attaining to the first resurrection
[1:17:11] which is the rapture praise god
[1:17:14] so paul is saying i'm going to skip
[1:17:15] reading all that because you're pretty
[1:17:16] probably familiar with that
[1:17:19] paul's saying and by any means i might
[1:17:22] obtain
[1:17:23] to the rapture praise god in other words
[1:17:25] jesus help me to suffer whenever i have
[1:17:27] to suffer
[1:17:28] so i will be in the first resurrection
[1:17:31] all right look at this all the
[1:17:32] paul knew all the saints knew there was
[1:17:34] going to be two resurrections
[1:17:36] a resurrection for the holy uh the real
[1:17:39] church of god and then a resurrection
[1:17:40] for everybody else
[1:17:41] oh that's my prayer i've just got a few
[1:17:43] more decades left in life i'll say it
[1:17:45] like that you know if i'm 40.
[1:17:48] i got i got a handful of decades left
[1:17:49] with the lord terry's
[1:17:51] lord by any means i want to make the
[1:17:53] rapture praise god
[1:17:54] amen that should be our prayer that was
[1:17:56] paul's prayer i've suffered shipwrecked
[1:17:58] i've been beaten i've been robbed i've
[1:18:00] been mugged i've been cursed
[1:18:02] remember those men want to do a vow on
[1:18:05] paul's life to curse him
[1:18:08] even jewish brothers try to they won't
[1:18:10] eat until they kill
[1:18:12] paul but yet god gave him the victory
[1:18:14] look at all that he endured
[1:18:17] all for the sake of christ and to have
[1:18:20] christ righteousness
[1:18:23] that's a real example to me praise god
[1:18:25] and so my prayers god let me suffer
[1:18:27] anything
[1:18:28] that i'll obtain to that same
[1:18:29] resurrection where paul's going to be
[1:18:31] praise god
[1:18:32] verse 12 not as though i had already
[1:18:34] obtained
[1:18:36] see paul was saying i have not obtained
[1:18:37] this this great state of maturity
[1:18:40] either we're already perfect now that
[1:18:42] actual word actually means uh
[1:18:44] the word perfect does mean mature but i
[1:18:47] follow after if that i may
[1:18:49] apprehend that wit for which also i am
[1:18:52] apprehended of of christ jesus
[1:18:56] so paul admits he's not perfect but he's
[1:18:59] following
[1:18:59] after christ that he might seize or lay
[1:19:02] a hold
[1:19:03] of him who seized him that's quite a
[1:19:06] picture
[1:19:07] paul is like in jesus's hand but yet
[1:19:09] he's saying i'm trying to hold jesus
[1:19:11] interesting i thought there i he said i
[1:19:14] want to apprehend
[1:19:15] the person who's apprehending me praise
[1:19:17] god
[1:19:18] amen my i'll say that's kind of how we
[1:19:20] feel right we know jesus
[1:19:22] is in our heart but how many want to hug
[1:19:23] jesus i know haven't's going to say amen
[1:19:24] on that one right
[1:19:26] right you want to sit in his lap but
[1:19:28] isn't that the reality like
[1:19:29] don't we just like want to just grab
[1:19:30] this and just
[1:19:32] hold him we just want to we want to look
[1:19:34] at his
[1:19:35] nails nail scars in his hands and we
[1:19:38] want to see him and paul saying
[1:19:40] that's what paul's saying he said i want
[1:19:42] to obtain
[1:19:43] i'm going to apprehend that which has
[1:19:45] got a hold of me praise god
[1:19:46] amen in other words i want my faith to
[1:19:49] become
[1:19:50] sight praise god amen i want to see the
[1:19:52] rapture amen
[1:19:53] i want to meet him in the air i want to
[1:19:55] meet brother brahem and john wesley and
[1:19:56] martin luther
[1:19:58] all these men of god i want to see them
[1:20:00] i want to know it's real but even more
[1:20:01] so praise god
[1:20:03] i want to see it with these eyes then
[1:20:06] i'll get new eyes i won't need my
[1:20:07] glasses anymore
[1:20:08] that's what he's saying i'm gonna follow
[1:20:12] hard he says
[1:20:14] i follow after now here's the next
[1:20:17] here's some greek definitions right
[1:20:20] follow after is the same greek word
[1:20:22] where he said press toward the mark in
[1:20:24] jesus name we press
[1:20:25] on we sang it what a good song perfect
[1:20:28] it's the same word it means to run
[1:20:29] swiftly seek after
[1:20:32] eagerly now anybody that knows these
[1:20:34] days sports were really popular in the
[1:20:36] bible days
[1:20:37] right that's what the greeks were all
[1:20:39] about right romans
[1:20:40] so paul purposely used his sports over
[1:20:44] and over again
[1:20:45] he's saying you've got you see all these
[1:20:46] guys training right they train all
[1:20:48] around rome
[1:20:49] they train all over corinth they're
[1:20:50] getting ready for the the olympic games
[1:20:53] you know i don't know if they're called
[1:20:54] olympic gets that time
[1:20:55] but they were getting ready and paul is
[1:20:57] saying look you see him out there
[1:20:59] he said we have to follow after the and
[1:21:02] press toward the mark
[1:21:04] of the high calling you need to run
[1:21:05] swiftly can you imagine they're sitting
[1:21:07] maybe in caves and
[1:21:08] or maybe they're in somebody's house
[1:21:10] like aquila priscilla
[1:21:11] and they see runners right it's the
[1:21:13] lord's day you know they're worshipping
[1:21:14] in the house
[1:21:15] paul's preaching and yet they see
[1:21:17] athletes out there we probably could too
[1:21:18] right we could probably look out of the
[1:21:19] road
[1:21:20] see people sweating it was something
[1:21:22] very common
[1:21:23] and paul's saying take a lesson from
[1:21:25] those runners spiritually amen
[1:21:28] keep running for jesus don't let your
[1:21:31] life go to waste amen
[1:21:33] be active follow hard after the high
[1:21:36] calling in christ jesus
[1:21:37] amen in other words don't sit still
[1:21:39] praise god
[1:21:40] run towards the goal try to finish the
[1:21:43] race amen
[1:21:45] they're getting ready for this akron
[1:21:46] marathon pretty soon well little did
[1:21:48] they know i've been running the marathon
[1:21:49] all these years in akron and they just
[1:21:51] got the wrong one
[1:21:53] here this is the right acronym right
[1:21:56] here praise god
[1:21:57] because we've been running for 14 years
[1:22:00] preaching the message for 14 years in
[1:22:02] akron amen
[1:22:03] here am i running with a message saying
[1:22:05] come come to the message come to the
[1:22:07] word of god
[1:22:08] that god's word is true the mysteries
[1:22:11] are finished praise god come and run
[1:22:13] the gospel race praise god
[1:22:16] i'll keep running my marathon they
[1:22:19] i saw some of them again practicing
[1:22:21] their their 14 miles today they're 15
[1:22:23] miles today
[1:22:25] praise god but we got we're gaining our
[1:22:27] spiritual miles right amen
[1:22:30] glory praise god
[1:22:33] paul's saying i i'm not acting like won
[1:22:35] the race
[1:22:37] he said i'm running after and i'm trying
[1:22:39] to apprehend the next
[1:22:41] this has even more definitions he said
[1:22:44] verse
[1:22:46] now this is 14 i press toward the mark
[1:22:49] for the prize of the high calling of god
[1:22:52] in christ jesus oh i press i run towards
[1:22:55] the goal
[1:22:56] the finish line for the prize the award
[1:23:00] the rewards amen of jesus
[1:23:03] for the high which means heavenly i
[1:23:07] i'm running spiritually to the goal to
[1:23:10] get my reward
[1:23:11] for the for the heavenly calling the
[1:23:14] heavenly invitation
[1:23:16] which is in christ jesus because jesus
[1:23:19] invited us to the marriage supper praise
[1:23:21] god
[1:23:22] just like he invited his disciples he
[1:23:24] said i'll drink no more the fruit of the
[1:23:25] vine
[1:23:26] until we drink it anew in my father's
[1:23:28] kingdom praise god
[1:23:29] amen this is the high calling this is
[1:23:32] the
[1:23:33] heavenly feast the heavenly invitation
[1:23:35] he said
[1:23:36] run towards the heavenly feasts i know
[1:23:39] there's a lot of people gonna run to
[1:23:40] chipotle right
[1:23:42] they're gonna run to the next feast for
[1:23:43] lunch like we might even do
[1:23:45] and we might not run but there's people
[1:23:47] that got drunk last night and they're
[1:23:48] going to run to bob evans today to get
[1:23:50] their feast
[1:23:52] we know we have to eat but our lives
[1:23:55] should have a spiritual
[1:23:56] urgency like we're running for jesus
[1:23:59] christ praise god amen
[1:24:00] and we're running for a different kind
[1:24:02] of feast
[1:24:05] most people don't even know what it's
[1:24:06] like to fast right most people don't
[1:24:08] even know
[1:24:09] uh but we got to be willing to do that
[1:24:11] by god's grace to keep our
[1:24:13] walk pure with the lord right to humble
[1:24:16] ourselves
[1:24:17] to be refreshed praise god
[1:24:20] that was verse 14. let me go to verse 13
[1:24:22] now
[1:24:23] because i didn't read 13. look at 13.
[1:24:25] brethren i can't
[1:24:26] i count not myself to have apprehended
[1:24:29] so he's saying i haven't i haven't
[1:24:30] seized on christ on my reward yet right
[1:24:34] but this one thing i do i forget those
[1:24:36] things which are behind
[1:24:38] and reaching forth unto those things
[1:24:41] which are before
[1:24:43] remember what was something before what
[1:24:44] was something before paul he wanted to
[1:24:46] visit them again remember
[1:24:48] that was one thing oh perhaps the lord
[1:24:49] will open a door i'll get to go to
[1:24:51] philippi
[1:24:53] he was reaching for remember he remember
[1:24:55] he believed in chapter one
[1:24:56] i'm gonna get out of this prison
[1:24:57] remember he said that through your
[1:24:58] prayers
[1:25:00] he was reason there was always something
[1:25:01] he was reaching for praise god
[1:25:04] now for me i always got to keep
[1:25:05] something i got to keep the next book or
[1:25:06] the next video
[1:25:08] or the next opportunity i can witness
[1:25:10] always got to keep something before me
[1:25:11] right
[1:25:12] like the bible says reaching forth
[1:25:15] to those things which are before like oh
[1:25:17] i can't wait if simon gets going back to
[1:25:18] thailand or
[1:25:19] oh just pray let's pray god open up more
[1:25:21] doors for a missionary to get into every
[1:25:23] country praise god
[1:25:25] we can send them praise god we can give
[1:25:26] a little offering and help them on their
[1:25:28] way
[1:25:29] we always have to constantly be running
[1:25:31] but reaching for the next
[1:25:32] the next step praise god we're going to
[1:25:34] reach for the next goal hallelujah
[1:25:36] there's one final goal we know that
[1:25:38] that's death or the rapture
[1:25:40] that's the final goal but there's things
[1:25:42] we're reaching for there's
[1:25:44] rewards we're trying to reach in this
[1:25:46] life
[1:25:48] now look true humility forgets the past
[1:25:52] and reaches forward
[1:25:54] see churches mispreach us all the time
[1:25:56] they say just forget about your past but
[1:25:58] church our past haunts us if we don't
[1:26:00] repent of it
[1:26:02] right who wants to be haunted by their
[1:26:04] past well the way to do that is like
[1:26:06] jesus said
[1:26:07] i'm sorry i forgot this come over here
[1:26:09] true humility forgets the past and
[1:26:11] reaches forward
[1:26:12] we only forget and move on from the past
[1:26:14] when we thoroughly repent
[1:26:17] that's the only way we can ever forget
[1:26:19] the things that's the way i can forget
[1:26:21] my sinful life is remember
[1:26:22] i confess that i said forgive me jesus
[1:26:25] and i made it right
[1:26:26] amen then i can press on then i can move
[1:26:30] on
[1:26:31] and i can run for because i've left it
[1:26:34] behind
[1:26:35] and i've done it the right way right i'm
[1:26:37] not haunted by my past
[1:26:41] how many believe christians should be
[1:26:42] free from your past sins amen
[1:26:44] absolutely if he's faithful to forgive
[1:26:47] us of all unrighteousness
[1:26:50] right do you remember jesus's
[1:26:53] statement how many people will be
[1:26:54] willing to do this if you come to bring
[1:26:56] your gift to the altar
[1:26:58] and remember your brother hath ought
[1:26:59] against thee
[1:27:01] leave your gift before the altar and go
[1:27:03] thy way first be reconciled to thy
[1:27:05] brother then coming after thy gift
[1:27:08] now i've seen it in good ways i've seen
[1:27:09] people call i've seen people
[1:27:11] at our church over on waterloo there was
[1:27:14] something wrong before church they had
[1:27:15] to get on the phone and call to make
[1:27:16] something right then they came into
[1:27:18] church
[1:27:18] i know that's a good idea but then i've
[1:27:21] seen people take it the wrong way where
[1:27:22] people won't come and have communion
[1:27:25] because something's not right well then
[1:27:26] why don't you make it right
[1:27:29] if you knew we're gonna have communion a
[1:27:30] week ago how come you didn't take this
[1:27:32] week and make it right
[1:27:33] you see see there there's an
[1:27:36] understanding where
[1:27:37] paul says the only way i can press on is
[1:27:39] forget those things
[1:27:41] and if i forget him the only way i can
[1:27:42] forget him is this jesus puts him under
[1:27:44] the sea of forgetfulness amen
[1:27:47] praise god i don't know that's the only
[1:27:48] way i can forget him is that the blood
[1:27:50] blots them out amen
[1:27:55] that's real christianity
[1:27:59] not forgetting what is for getting not
[1:28:01] caring for it
[1:28:02] i don't care about those things that
[1:28:03] i've done anymore my sins i i
[1:28:06] i forget them i don't care about it that
[1:28:08] anymore i'm pressing on
[1:28:11] right i don't care to think about that's
[1:28:13] what that's the way we got to get we got
[1:28:15] to forgive ourselves sometimes right
[1:28:17] i don't care i don't care about that i
[1:28:19] know jesus forgave me that right
[1:28:21] i'm not going to take time to worry
[1:28:22] about i'm not going to worry about that
[1:28:24] jesus took care of that praise god
[1:28:25] i tried to make it right with that
[1:28:27] brother i tried to make it right with
[1:28:28] that sister i did my part praise god
[1:28:30] i'm pressing all and i'm forgetting
[1:28:32] about those things
[1:28:34] praise god now i want to also bring the
[1:28:38] other thought
[1:28:39] we're supposed to neglect our sins that
[1:28:41] are under the blood but then paul says
[1:28:43] don't neglect the gospel don't forget
[1:28:45] about that
[1:28:47] right so we must we must neglect our
[1:28:50] past sins don't bring them up anymore
[1:28:52] right
[1:28:52] leave them under the blood we must
[1:28:54] neglect those but we must
[1:28:56] focus on the supernatural power of god
[1:29:00] he says therefore we ought to give more
[1:29:01] earnest heed to the things which we have
[1:29:03] heard
[1:29:03] lest at any time we should let them slip
[1:29:05] now slip means
[1:29:07] slip your mind so again we got to be
[1:29:10] careful what are we meditating on
[1:29:12] right what are we made at meditating on
[1:29:13] i'm going to go back
[1:29:15] for if the word spoken by angels was
[1:29:17] steadfast and every transgression
[1:29:19] disobedience received a just recompense
[1:29:21] of reward
[1:29:24] so see we cannot let the gospel slip
[1:29:28] paul said how shall we escape if we
[1:29:29] neglect so great salvation
[1:29:32] so we can't let the delivering power of
[1:29:34] jesus christ
[1:29:35] slip our minds in other words when we
[1:29:37] hear about prayer requests
[1:29:38] of people that are struggling we've got
[1:29:40] to have faith we've got to get our
[1:29:42] mustard seed of faith and say i'll pray
[1:29:44] for you
[1:29:44] i'll skip this lunch meal i'll skip
[1:29:46] supper just to pray for you
[1:29:48] church we got how many want to be
[1:29:49] willing to do that i want to be willing
[1:29:51] to do that
[1:29:52] praise god we cannot neglect
[1:29:55] or let the power of god slip our minds
[1:29:58] because that's what it says which at
[1:30:00] first began to be spoken by the lord
[1:30:02] and was confirmed unto us by them that
[1:30:04] hurt him
[1:30:05] god also bearing witness both with signs
[1:30:08] and wonders and with diverse miracles
[1:30:09] and gifts of the holy ghost
[1:30:11] according to his own will see we're to
[1:30:14] neglect the flesh
[1:30:15] and our past sins and not the holy ghost
[1:30:19] see a lot of message people they'll
[1:30:21] they'll confess their sins but then they
[1:30:22] won't focus on the supernatural of god
[1:30:25] the power of god right lord keep
[1:30:28] sanctifying me
[1:30:29] prepare me for the next miracle you'll
[1:30:31] help me to run forward help me to run
[1:30:32] the race with perseverance amen
[1:30:35] they're not reaching towards anything
[1:30:37] right they don't want to see their gifts
[1:30:38] grow they're not really reaching that
[1:30:40] realm and
[1:30:41] they don't want to see more people save
[1:30:43] they're not reaching forward but we've
[1:30:44] got to run
[1:30:45] to reach the next goal praise god
[1:30:48] hallelujah
[1:30:49] amen i don't know if you love this holy
[1:30:51] word of god right here
[1:30:52] don't you love it god knew this would
[1:30:54] feed us for 2 000 years
[1:30:56] amen he knew the church would feed on
[1:30:58] this revelation
[1:30:59] that this is the attitude we have and
[1:31:02] this was his this is his final remember
[1:31:04] finally this is what he said this is how
[1:31:05] i'm ending the letter
[1:31:07] that takes another chapter to end it
[1:31:10] but this is how he's reminding the
[1:31:12] saints to remember the things of god
[1:31:19] now church believe the sign now i don't
[1:31:23] know if the debate the debate is
[1:31:24] scheduled for the saturday
[1:31:25] i emailed the brother the questions a
[1:31:27] month ago and i still haven't got my
[1:31:28] questions i'm supposed to answer
[1:31:31] so i don't know if we're going to debate
[1:31:32] this saturday or not it's not really
[1:31:34] fair if i give him
[1:31:35] a whole month with his questions and i
[1:31:37] don't have any or my questions and he's
[1:31:39] never given me his question so
[1:31:40] i emailed the brother yesterday i
[1:31:41] haven't heard back from him anyways
[1:31:44] i've been listening to some of them
[1:31:45] together kind of get ready for their
[1:31:46] their their mindset
[1:31:47] you know and the scriptures that they
[1:31:49] they try to use
[1:31:51] but they rebuke brother branham because
[1:31:53] he said god took hope in sharon rose
[1:31:55] when he disobeyed the word of god
[1:31:58] now how wrong is that
[1:32:02] the bible says every transgression
[1:32:06] reaps some type of consequence right
[1:32:10] everyone reaps some kind of some kind of
[1:32:12] consequence
[1:32:14] not that god is like eternally angry
[1:32:16] with us
[1:32:18] but we have to learn our lesson right we
[1:32:20] have to learn from the things we suffer
[1:32:22] and sometimes
[1:32:23] as we learn and suffer because it's our
[1:32:25] mistake
[1:32:26] what about this how many people ever
[1:32:28] thought about this hebrew says he
[1:32:30] chastens that means spanx every son
[1:32:32] that he loves jesus said as many as i
[1:32:35] love i rebuke and chasten
[1:32:37] david's sin because of david's sin the
[1:32:39] sword never left his house
[1:32:42] did you know absalon not only came
[1:32:44] against him but also
[1:32:45] a mesa another son
[1:32:49] both and then i just read that a mesa
[1:32:50] one this morning he had to go out with
[1:32:53] uh
[1:32:54] thousands of soldiers and like basically
[1:32:57] just
[1:32:57] overthrow uh their uh their army
[1:33:01] a mesa and then blew the trumpet said a
[1:33:03] mace is the king let's all run away from
[1:33:05] david
[1:33:06] you know david got taken over by absalom
[1:33:08] constantly in and out of struggles now
[1:33:10] talk about church splits
[1:33:13] your own son and then david got in the
[1:33:16] flesh and he was
[1:33:17] with absalom he was crying over absalom
[1:33:20] and the people are like
[1:33:21] david we just won a victory we just got
[1:33:23] you this kingdom back and you're crying
[1:33:25] about it
[1:33:26] he said if you don't cry if he said if
[1:33:28] you don't go out there and rejoice
[1:33:29] they're going to rebel against you
[1:33:30] because you'd rather that your son was
[1:33:32] alive and we were all dead
[1:33:34] and david said you're right and he went
[1:33:36] out there and went we met with the
[1:33:37] people and worshiped
[1:33:39] my church all right we've got to be
[1:33:42] careful what kind of attitude we have
[1:33:43] right
[1:33:44] we got to walk in the holy spirit praise
[1:33:47] god but the sword never left his house
[1:33:49] because of his sin
[1:33:50] yet we heard it he's a man after the
[1:33:52] heart of god
[1:33:53] yeah we would think oh well he's a man
[1:33:56] for god's own heart well surely god
[1:33:57] won't let any more bad things happen to
[1:33:59] him
[1:34:00] no god made him pay in other words god
[1:34:03] made him
[1:34:04] learn from his mistake you can't lie
[1:34:08] about murdering and killing and then
[1:34:10] expect to get away with it
[1:34:12] there's going to be consequences
[1:34:16] so my question is is god a dodie grandpa
[1:34:19] that lets you get away with everything
[1:34:20] no of course not
[1:34:24] david numbered the people church and 70
[1:34:26] 000 people died
[1:34:28] where are we at with chronovirus i think
[1:34:29] it's 180 000 around the world
[1:34:34] seventy thousand people died and david
[1:34:35] cries at the end he said god
[1:34:37] why are you letting the sheep die what
[1:34:39] for my sin
[1:34:40] but then god stopped it after seventy
[1:34:42] thousand now i don't understand that
[1:34:45] how could god let 70 000 people die for
[1:34:48] one man's sin
[1:34:49] of number in the people but the bible
[1:34:51] called it a pestilence
[1:34:53] did you know leprosy stayed in geheza's
[1:34:55] family forever
[1:34:57] because of his one mistake
[1:35:01] does god correct us yes
[1:35:04] remember naaman just got healed and
[1:35:06] elijah's like no we don't want any
[1:35:08] reward like it's like brother
[1:35:09] i'm turning down the million and a half
[1:35:10] dollars right after a miracle he turned
[1:35:12] it down he said why should we get a
[1:35:14] reward for something god did
[1:35:15] elijah said the same thing but hazel
[1:35:17] went out there said oh we'll take the
[1:35:18] money
[1:35:19] and then elijah said the curse his
[1:35:21] leprosy's on you
[1:35:22] because you thought we should get
[1:35:24] rewarded for doing a miracle
[1:35:28] now i hope that helps church look people
[1:35:31] are criticizing brother branham
[1:35:32] because he basically lived a biblical
[1:35:34] life
[1:35:36] they're criticizing the fact that god
[1:35:39] had to chasten him
[1:35:40] and treat him as a son how many want to
[1:35:42] be sons and daughters amen
[1:35:44] i want god to treat me like a son i
[1:35:46] don't want to be like a bastard child
[1:35:48] i want to be like a real son of god amen
[1:35:51] that means god's got to correct me like
[1:35:52] what
[1:35:55] i'm almost done he said press towards
[1:35:58] the mark
[1:36:01] verse 14 and 15. i pressed toward the
[1:36:03] mark for the high
[1:36:04] first i'm sorry for the prize of the
[1:36:06] high calling of god this invitation of
[1:36:08] god
[1:36:08] which is in christ jesus let us
[1:36:11] therefore as many be perfect
[1:36:13] let us be thus minded and if in anything
[1:36:16] you be otherwise minded
[1:36:18] god shall even reveal this unto you
[1:36:22] look paul says those of us who are
[1:36:24] perfect
[1:36:26] as many as be perfect in other words as
[1:36:28] any as many as being mature christians
[1:36:31] keep this runner's mindset keep running
[1:36:33] the race church right
[1:36:35] lay aside any sin that hinders your walk
[1:36:37] with god
[1:36:39] lay it aside and run the race with
[1:36:41] perseverance
[1:36:42] and he says keep this runner's mindset
[1:36:44] he said god will reveal any change to
[1:36:46] this revelation that's what we were
[1:36:48] saying last week
[1:36:49] if god ever changed anything about the
[1:36:51] message or the squeeze or the rapture
[1:36:54] god will let us know praise god because
[1:36:56] we're keeping paul's commandments amen
[1:36:58] we're preaching paul's gospel hallelujah
[1:37:01] and if anything he said if anything
[1:37:02] would change different
[1:37:05] if anything would be even thus unto you
[1:37:07] i'm sorry
[1:37:08] otherwise minded if anything would be
[1:37:10] differently taught he said god will
[1:37:11] reveal it before the coming
[1:37:13] amen hallelujah so let's take a runner's
[1:37:16] mindset
[1:37:17] that means we got to be willing to work
[1:37:19] praise god right how many of you like to
[1:37:21] get up and run in the morning
[1:37:22] i used to but i don't like it anymore so
[1:37:24] i don't do it
[1:37:25] i know amen did this summer a couple
[1:37:27] times
[1:37:28] but paul said that's the attitude you
[1:37:30] got to get up i'm ready to go work i
[1:37:31] don't feel like it
[1:37:33] i don't want to go running i don't want
[1:37:34] to sweat i don't want to do this but
[1:37:36] i've got to go run because i'm a runner
[1:37:38] praise god
[1:37:40] i've got to have a runner's mindset i've
[1:37:41] got to press on i've got to finish this
[1:37:43] course
[1:37:43] amen i'm not going to quit or give up
[1:37:46] i'm going to keep pressing hard
[1:37:47] until i reach it praise god amen
[1:37:52] that's how it is with this book i've had
[1:37:53] to just keep i just have to keep
[1:37:55] pressing on many times i don't feel like
[1:37:57] it
[1:37:57] i don't feel like writing more i've
[1:37:59] already got over almost 300
[1:38:00] 000 words i don't feel like it but i
[1:38:02] know if god used that other one
[1:38:05] to help people and deliver them from
[1:38:07] their denominational thoughts
[1:38:08] right and help them get rid of their
[1:38:10] pants and wear skirts
[1:38:11] well how's god going to use this one
[1:38:13] praise god with all the ammunition this
[1:38:15] one and even if it helps just a couple
[1:38:18] and brings out brings the light if even
[1:38:20] it helps a couple i know it'll
[1:38:21] strengthen anyone who
[1:38:22] loves to read the word of god i've just
[1:38:25] got to look at it like a race i'm almost
[1:38:26] done with the race
[1:38:28] i've almost reached that where they call
[1:38:29] them stations in the marathon is that
[1:38:30] what they come
[1:38:31] where they got like you know gatorade
[1:38:32] cups and everything like that i never
[1:38:34] worked a marathon i know bangs run one
[1:38:36] but
[1:38:37] where's bang anyways he run a marathon
[1:38:38] today
[1:38:40] he's running a spiritual marathon praise
[1:38:42] god bless you sorry he's probably
[1:38:44] listening
[1:38:44] bless your servants run your spiritual
[1:38:46] marathon by god's grace we'll probably
[1:38:47] see him tonight
[1:38:50] see we got to have brother
[1:38:53] said remember brother remember those
[1:38:54] quotes i read brother he said i like a
[1:38:56] man who knows what he's aiming for
[1:39:00] he said a man who has a goal he's
[1:39:02] shooting for something but i'm saying
[1:39:03] like a man
[1:39:04] who takes initiative he knows what he's
[1:39:06] fighting for praise god
[1:39:08] i like that he's talking about abraham
[1:39:11] lincoln too
[1:39:13] verse 16. nevertheless where to
[1:39:16] we have already attained let us walk by
[1:39:19] the same rule
[1:39:20] let us mine the same thing okay so be
[1:39:22] thus minded again the book about the
[1:39:23] mind battle
[1:39:25] everybody keep this attitude we're going
[1:39:26] to press on towards the mark
[1:39:28] we're going to keep running right we're
[1:39:30] going to reach we're going to hold forth
[1:39:31] the word of life and we're going to
[1:39:32] reach our
[1:39:33] our next goal he said i'm not acting
[1:39:37] like i've already obtained it
[1:39:39] he said but we need to walk now look he
[1:39:40] said run and i said now we need to walk
[1:39:42] by the same rule
[1:39:44] so i guess there's times you walk in
[1:39:45] your christian journey
[1:39:47] let us walk by the same rule let's mine
[1:39:50] the same thing
[1:39:51] so direct your life by the measuring
[1:39:54] stick
[1:39:55] measure your life by the word of god
[1:39:57] right
[1:39:58] live within god's rules god's boundaries
[1:40:01] possess your land right your inheritance
[1:40:04] maintain your inheritance that's what
[1:40:07] the word rule
[1:40:08] means it means a measuring rod
[1:40:11] as in the olympic games to measure a
[1:40:13] leap
[1:40:14] to measure your running right measure
[1:40:16] your marathon
[1:40:17] or what do they call it your laps
[1:40:18] measure your laps right
[1:40:20] paul says measure it
[1:40:24] walk by the same measurement
[1:40:28] now how's that one same one right okay i
[1:40:31] forgot that
[1:40:33] yeah paul says examine yourself whether
[1:40:36] you be in the faith prove yourselves
[1:40:39] so see paul says if you don't measure
[1:40:42] yourself with god's word
[1:40:43] you become a reprobate right a reprobate
[1:40:46] is a rejected mind
[1:40:48] if you don't use your mind to measure
[1:40:51] and see how am i living up to this word
[1:40:53] paul said you'll let your mind wander to
[1:40:54] you don't even care and you become a
[1:40:56] reprobate how many seen that amongst
[1:40:58] church members
[1:40:59] they don't even care to measure
[1:41:00] themselves by the word so pretty soon
[1:41:02] then homosexuality's okay
[1:41:05] violence is okay mur abortion's okay
[1:41:08] it's okay
[1:41:09] they become reprobates the bible says
[1:41:12] because they
[1:41:12] they fail to keep themselves lined up to
[1:41:15] the word of god
[1:41:18] so measure means to make a test test
[1:41:20] your life right
[1:41:21] test your life by the word of god i'm
[1:41:24] closing with this mark
[1:41:25] he said verse 17 mark the good and the
[1:41:26] bad i just closed my bible
[1:41:28] sorry i didn't mean to
[1:41:33] i'm trying to close here mercy
[1:41:37] philippians 3 17 brethren be followers
[1:41:40] together of me
[1:41:42] and mark them which have i'm sorry which
[1:41:44] walk
[1:41:45] so as you have us for an example
[1:41:50] so follow the prophet of god and those
[1:41:53] who keep his example
[1:41:56] okay so we mark he said mark yes
[1:41:59] mark them which are good examples so we
[1:42:02] need to know amongst ourselves now mark
[1:42:04] means to stare at right
[1:42:06] observe them fix your eyes on them
[1:42:09] direct your attention so see there's
[1:42:11] times you gotta just look at people if
[1:42:12] they're living the right way
[1:42:14] praise god how are they living this way
[1:42:16] right but then there's other times
[1:42:17] why are these people falling away that's
[1:42:19] why i listen to like jeffersonville
[1:42:21] or believe the sign why you have to give
[1:42:24] them attention to understand
[1:42:25] why are they living like this
[1:42:30] you have to observe them you have to
[1:42:31] mark them okay oh i know
[1:42:33] that this group started falling away
[1:42:35] when they did this so i will abstain
[1:42:37] from that
[1:42:39] right or this group they got a revival
[1:42:41] when they did this praise god
[1:42:43] amen
[1:42:46] now i beseech you brother and mark them
[1:42:48] which cause divisions
[1:42:50] and offenses contrary to the doctrine so
[1:42:53] mark those who break doctrine which have
[1:42:54] learned and avoid
[1:42:56] them so you got to mark them you got to
[1:42:58] point them out
[1:43:00] for they that are such serve not our
[1:43:03] lord jesus christ
[1:43:05] but their own belly and by good words
[1:43:08] and fair speeches deceive the hearts of
[1:43:10] the simple
[1:43:12] when people break the word of god
[1:43:15] and they they uh and they only have
[1:43:18] church in order to feed themselves
[1:43:20] right either physically or financially
[1:43:23] and they break the doctrine of the word
[1:43:26] he said they're no longer serving the
[1:43:28] lord jesus christ
[1:43:30] look at verse let's go back to
[1:43:32] philippians 3 we'll finish up here let's
[1:43:33] stand our feet
[1:43:34] and i'll finish this
[1:43:37] now look paul says almost church the
[1:43:39] exact same thing as he did in
[1:43:41] in uh romans here he said they serve
[1:43:44] their belly now look at philippians
[1:43:46] 3
[1:43:50] 18 for many walk of whom i have told you
[1:43:53] often and now they
[1:43:54] and now tell you even weeping that they
[1:43:57] are the enemies of the cross of christ
[1:43:59] whose end is the destruction whose god
[1:44:01] is their belly see that's the same thing
[1:44:02] right
[1:44:03] we just read paul said those that uh
[1:44:05] break doctrine
[1:44:06] their god is their belly and he says it
[1:44:08] here to the philippians
[1:44:10] and whose glory is in their shame who
[1:44:13] mind earthly things
[1:44:19] for our conversation is in heaven what
[1:44:21] are we talking about today
[1:44:22] heaven praise god what do the other
[1:44:26] dogs think about all they think about is
[1:44:28] the earth
[1:44:30] now we want god to meet our earthly
[1:44:31] needs right but these guys go overboard
[1:44:33] these dogs go overboard that's all they
[1:44:35] talk about is the earthly blessings
[1:44:38] earthly blessings instead of thinking
[1:44:39] about heaven that's why i know we're
[1:44:41] different because we talk about the
[1:44:42] rapture church
[1:44:44] most churches like my wife luther never
[1:44:46] even heard about the rapture
[1:44:48] i was in the pentecostal church i don't
[1:44:49] remember ever hearing about the rapture
[1:44:51] i heard about judgment day thank god
[1:44:54] but see paul says we're trying to obtain
[1:44:57] that first resurrection amen
[1:44:59] i said we're trying to we're pressing on
[1:45:01] towards that praise god
[1:45:05] musicians if you'll come let me stop
[1:45:06] right there now we'll probably pick up
[1:45:09] maybe later on verse 18.
[1:45:10] he says weeping so see paul sighed and
[1:45:13] cried for the abominations the preachers
[1:45:15] were doing
[1:45:31] hallelujah thank you jesus
[1:45:38] what a blessing church let's not forget
[1:45:40] this is the church
[1:45:42] of the first lydia not our lydia
[1:45:45] this is the church of the first lydia
[1:45:47] the first convert
[1:45:50] this is the church of the philippian
[1:45:51] jailer and not just him
[1:45:53] but his whole house because he said thy
[1:45:56] thy house shall be saved amen
[1:45:58] amen glory this is the church of the
[1:46:01] woman who had the spirit of divination
