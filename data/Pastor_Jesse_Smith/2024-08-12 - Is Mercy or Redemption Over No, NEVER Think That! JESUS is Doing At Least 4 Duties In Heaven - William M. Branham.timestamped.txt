[0:02] is Mercy over don't never think that see
[0:07] just keep right on doing everything you
[0:10] can until you're taken away
[0:12] see greetings friends in the mattress
[0:15] name of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[0:17] purpose of this video is to answer a
[0:19] viewer's question is redemption over is
[0:22] Mercy over and this is based upon a
[0:24] quote from the first seal from God's
[0:26] Prophet William brandham So my answer is
[0:29] no Redemption is not over Mercy is not
[0:31] over so we'll take a look at this quote
[0:34] and then additional quotes and
[0:35] scriptures by the grace of God hi
[0:38] friends I'm Jesse Smith pastor bride of
[0:39] Christ Fellowship here in akan Ohio USA
[0:42] and I defend the original Gospel of the
[0:44] Lord Jesus Christ that he revealed to St
[0:46] Paul then had to restore through Martin
[0:48] Luther John Wesley and the late Prophet
[0:50] William Maran brandham who lived from
[0:52] 1909 to 1965 and also defend brother
[0:55] bram's Godly Christian character so
[0:58] here's the question does this quote mean
[1:01] Redemption is over in the first seal
[1:02] brother brandom said now when the seals
[1:04] completely are broken the time of
[1:06] redemption is over because the lamb left
[1:08] so this is a good question about the
[1:10] quote if you go on and listen to the
[1:12] rest of the seven seal sermons brother
[1:14] random is convinced the coming of Lord
[1:16] is very nigh very close even later on in
[1:19] 1963 brother renom preached souls in
[1:21] prison now and he was wondering if Mercy
[1:23] was over so if you haven't listened to
[1:25] souls in prison now listen to that and
[1:27] brother R said he was just presuming
[1:29] that Mercy might be
[1:32] over if you fast forward an entire year
[1:35] almost a year and a half to questions
[1:37] that answers
[1:38] 1964 people ask brother Bram
[1:40] specifically is Mercy over is redemption
[1:42] over and I'm going to play two quotes
[1:45] from Brother brandham Where he says
[1:47] don't never think that let's look at the
[1:49] first quote the first quote I want to
[1:50] read is when brother Ram tells us
[1:53] exactly when mercy is over this is in
[1:56] part two of questions and answers
[1:58] 1964 brother Rand said Jesus Takes the
[2:01] book of redemption when the bride is
[2:03] taken from the earth that makes total
[2:05] sense Jesus Takes that book of
[2:06] redemption and then he comes down here
[2:08] and he raptures all those names who are
[2:10] on the book the Lamb's Book of Life
[2:12] before the foundation of the world and
[2:14] he that's holy is Holy still he that's
[2:16] righteous is righteous still he says
[2:18] then there's no more mediatorial work
[2:20] that's because God is cutting off the
[2:22] Gentile branch and then he's going to
[2:24] graph back in Israel into the holy tree
[2:27] according to Romans 11 let's listen to
[2:29] the quote
[2:31] after the bride is raptured will any of
[2:35] the foolish virgin be saved or will they
[2:37] all be
[2:40] lost no see everything will be finished
[2:44] for the Gentile church when the bride is
[2:47] taken from the earth the spirit of God
[2:50] leaves the Earth he that's filthy is
[2:52] filthy still he that's righteous is
[2:54] righteous still he that's holy is Holy
[2:56] still in other words the sanctuary
[2:59] becomes smoky where the the attorney
[3:01] stands to plead the case Christ leaves
[3:04] the sanctuary his day of mediatorial is
[3:07] over the Rapture comes he leaves from
[3:09] the sanctuary Goes Forth and takes the
[3:11] book of redemption and claims everything
[3:13] he redeemed there's no more mediatorial
[3:16] work how many understands that I got it
[3:18] on one of the seals or one of the yeah
[3:20] the seals I believe it was that Christ
[3:22] comes forth to claim his mediatorial
[3:23] work
[3:25] now and the next quote is from part
[3:27] three of questions and answer 64 the yes
[3:30] specifically is Mercy over it seems some
[3:33] are still finding Mercy in the prayer
[3:35] lines brother Ram said don't never think
[3:37] that Mercy's over he said God still got
[3:40] Mercy open just keep flowing into it as
[3:42] fast as you can God will do the stopping
[3:44] when it's time to stop let's listen to
[3:46] the
[3:48] quote brother B some say Mercy is over
[3:53] and no one can be saved now is this true
[3:57] I'm glad I got this one we walk watch
[4:00] and pray we watch the prayer lines and
[4:04] it seems some are
[4:07] still uh finding Mercy now that's the
[4:11] first question you got too is Mercy over
[4:15] don't never think that see just keep
[4:19] right on doing everything you can until
[4:21] you're taken away see we notice in a
[4:24] prayer line some finds Mercy sure
[4:27] Mercy's the doors are open see I think
[4:30] where you got this uh this thought might
[4:33] lay between see I don't have time to
[4:35] give each one of these scriptures a
[4:36] right place you see each one of these
[4:37] things the right place the in the prayer
[4:41] line you find Mercy certainly if I know
[4:44] Jesus is coming this afternoon I'd be
[4:46] doing just the thing I'm doing right now
[4:48] just continuing right on Mercy is always
[4:51] open see and now where I think you get
[4:53] it is about the finishing of the seven
[4:56] Church ages and the Seven Seals being
[4:59] loed see the Seven Seals it's manifested
[5:03] what takes place how what has took place
[5:06] the seventh Church age where the end of
[5:08] the seventh Church age when I say the
[5:10] end that doesn't mean it's this very
[5:12] hour this very minute you remember the
[5:15] Bible said back in the times of of the
[5:17] Lord Jesus Paul said for the time is at
[5:21] hand amen do you realize how long that
[5:25] was in God's time that was
[5:27] yesterday my time has been 2,
[5:30] years see the time is at hand see what
[5:35] God calls at hand is not what we call at
[5:37] hand see so Just Keep On Believing keep
[5:40] on praying keep on uh God still got
[5:43] Mercy open just keep flowing into it as
[5:45] fast as you can God will do the Stop and
[5:47] when it's time to stop see now by God's
[5:50] grace I want to read some scriptures
[5:51] that I shared with this person who asked
[5:53] the question especially regarding the
[5:55] first seal I said in my opinion and I
[5:57] could be wrong but I believe Jesus left
[5:59] left mediation in order to open the
[6:01] Seven Seals in March of 1963 he had to
[6:04] come forth take the book loose the seals
[6:07] Jesus literally broke those seals in
[6:09] heaven and then came down to Revelation
[6:10] 10 and revealed the revelations of the
[6:13] Seven Seals to God's Prophet brother
[6:15] brandham and now the next part is my
[6:17] opinion shortly after March of
[6:20] 1963 after Jesus loosed the seals and
[6:23] sent it to brother brandham he went
[6:24] right back into mediation because
[6:27] brother brandham said the Heavenly
[6:28] Dimension goes so much faster than our
[6:30] Dimension this is true because it gives
[6:33] Jesus plenty of time to do the numerous
[6:35] things he has to do in heaven first he
[6:38] must still be the mediator the Bible say
[6:39] there's one mediator between God and man
[6:41] it's the man Christ Jesus and the Bible
[6:44] said Jesus ever lives to make
[6:45] intercession Hebrews
[6:47] 7:25 so that's a major purpose of Jesus
[6:50] being resurrected is so he can live to
[6:52] make intercession for you and I because
[6:54] he can be touched by the feeling of our
[6:56] infirmities he can be a faithful and
[6:58] merciful High priest and we still need
[7:01] Jesus to intercede for us every single
[7:03] day second Jesus also needs time to
[7:05] prepare the New Jerusalem according to
[7:07] John 14 2 and 3 Jesus said I go to
[7:10] prepare a place for you so not only does
[7:12] Jesus have to be mediator he has to
[7:13] prepare the New Jerusalem and brother
[7:15] Bram said he's still doing that in the
[7:17] church age book he said the gates of the
[7:20] gigantic pearls are being raised and
[7:22] hinged this is in chapter N9 of the
[7:25] church age book let's listen to the
[7:27] quote this is the last warning there
[7:30] will not be another the throne room has
[7:33] been set up the 12 foundations have been
[7:36] laid the streets of gold have been paved
[7:39] the gates of gigantic pearls are raised
[7:42] and hinged like a pyramid she stands so
[7:45] fair and glorious the Heavenly beings
[7:47] who have prepared her watch breathlessly
[7:50] for she glistens and shines with a glory
[7:52] that is
[7:53] unearthly every facet of her beauty
[7:55] tells a story of Amazing Grace and Jesus
[7:58] love she she is a city prepared for a
[8:01] prepared people she awaits only for her
[8:03] inhabitants and soon they will throng
[8:06] her streets with joy yes it is the last
[8:09] call the spirit will not speak in
[8:11] another age the ages are over third
[8:16] Jesus is also doing Heavenly counsels in
[8:19] First Kings 22:1
[8:20] 15-23 we see a Heavenly Council where
[8:23] God is letting the evil spirits come
[8:25] forth and decide who will go deceive
[8:28] Ahab of course the Prophet Micaiah told
[8:30] about this and so this shows God has to
[8:32] have Heavenly counsels in order to bring
[8:35] his word to pass the Prophecies of the
[8:37] prophets have to be fulfilled so God has
[8:40] time also for Heavenly counsels just
[8:43] like he has time for mediation he has
[8:45] time for making the New Jerusalem he has
[8:47] plenty of time for Heavenly councils and
[8:50] the Bible also says that in the Book of
[8:51] Revelation I believe it's chapter 18
[8:54] where God is going to have the kings of
[8:56] the earth I no I think it's Revelation
[8:58] 17 God's going to have the the kings of
[8:59] the earth do his will and the 10 Kings
[9:03] of the Earth are going to give their
[9:04] power to the Beast for one hour and then
[9:06] fourth just like in the Book of Job the
[9:09] angels and fallen angels all have a Day
[9:11] in heaven when they have to present
[9:12] themselves before the Lord and tell the
[9:14] Lord what they're doing that's according
[9:16] to job
[9:17] 1:6 so there's numerous other things
[9:19] that are happening in heaven but there's
[9:21] at least four things that Jesus has to
[9:23] do in heaven I've never studied this
[9:25] topic thoroughly so I imagine there's
[9:27] many more but this is just what came to
[9:28] me when I replied to this brother's
[9:30] question so Jesus has plenty of time to
[9:32] do all this because his Dimension goes
[9:35] much faster than ours Jesus can do all
[9:37] these things and still have plenty of
[9:39] time to be our intercessor so there is
[9:41] still Mercy there is still Redemption by
[9:44] the grace of God and the last point I
[9:46] want to make is that many are still
[9:47] experiencing Mercy I know people in
[9:50] denominations who've recently got
[9:52] deliverance from Evil addictions I mean
[9:54] very Wicked sinful addictions and they
[9:57] are testifying today of the power of
[9:59] Jesus Christ remember Satan cannot cast
[10:01] out Satan it's not Satan who's giving
[10:03] these people victories and deliverances
[10:05] it's the Holy Ghost because Jesus Christ
[10:08] is still making intercession for people
[10:10] even family members and friends I know
[10:12] in denominations that are not in the
[10:14] message of the hour that are still
[10:16] receiving mercy so praise God for that
[10:18] God has both wise virgin and foolish
[10:20] virgin and of course friends in the
[10:22] message we're still receiving Mercy uh
[10:24] these former Amish friends from Junction
[10:26] City Ohio they're receiving Mercy I've
[10:28] I've seen it myself I see it firsthand
[10:31] they're receiving Mercy forgiveness they
[10:33] have transformed lives by the Holy Ghost
[10:36] the Holy Ghost is transforming their
[10:37] lives some of them are receiving the
[10:39] baptism of the Holy Ghost so I've seen
[10:41] transformed lives in the message and
[10:43] also outside the message so yes there's
[10:45] still Mercy yes there's still
[10:48] redemption in
[10:50] closing friends this is a wonderful
[10:52] topic a wonderful question I hope this
[10:53] video has been a blessing by the grace
[10:55] of God thank God there's still Mercy
[10:57] today thank God there's still Redemption
[10:58] today according to the Bible and
[11:01] according to God's Prophet brother
[11:02] brandham so let's keep pressing into the
[11:05] mercy of God as brother brandham said
[11:07] just keep flowing into it as fast as you
[11:09] can so let's keep drawing nigh to God
[11:12] and God will draw nigh to us if you have
[11:15] any questions concerns or testimonies
[11:17] about this video please contact me God
[11:20] bless you and may Jesus Christ be the
[11:22] desire of your heart
