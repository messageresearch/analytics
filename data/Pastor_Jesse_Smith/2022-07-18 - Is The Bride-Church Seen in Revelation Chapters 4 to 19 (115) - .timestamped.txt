[0:08] greetings friends in the mattress name
[0:10] of the lord jesus christ
[0:12] the purpose of this video is to answer
[0:14] the question is the bride or the holy
[0:18] ghost filled christian church
[0:19] seen in the book of revelation
[0:22] chapters 4 through 19
[0:24] the answer is yes which may be
[0:27] surprising to those who follow god's
[0:29] prophet brother william branham
[0:31] but as you'll soon see brother branham
[0:33] has quotes on both sides of this issue
[0:37] numerous times during brother and series
[0:39] on the seven seals he taught that the
[0:41] bride was seen in the first four seals
[0:44] and certainly the seventh seal
[0:46] and brother ram's own ministry was seen
[0:49] in revelation chapter 10 which we
[0:51] rejoice in
[0:52] so when we rightly divide the word of
[0:54] truth as commanded by the holy ghost in
[0:57] second timothy 2 verse 15
[0:59] we can see members of the new testament
[1:01] bride in numerous chapters in the book
[1:04] of revelation such as chapters 4
[1:08] 5
[1:08] 6
[1:09] 7
[1:10] 8
[1:11] 10
[1:12] 13 and 14.
[1:15] here's the outline for the video
[1:17] first we'll look at brother random
[1:18] quotes that say the bride is not seen in
[1:21] revelation 4 through 19.
[1:24] second we'll look at brother random
[1:25] quotes about the bride or bride members
[1:28] being in chapters 4 through 14.
[1:31] third we'll look at seven proofs that
[1:33] the book of revelation is not in
[1:36] chronological order
[1:38] and fourth and finally we'll look at how
[1:40] it seems brother branham got this
[1:41] thought that the bride was not seen from
[1:44] revelation 4 to 19 from clarence larkin
[1:48] and rehearse how brother branham did not
[1:50] plagiarize from clarence larkin
[1:52] brother branham quotes that the bride is
[1:54] not seen from revelation chapter 4 to
[1:56] 19.
[1:58] by god's grace this is in the four
[2:00] quotes from brother branham that say the
[2:02] bride is not seen from revelation
[2:04] chapters 4 to 19.
[2:06] in the first quote from 1961 god being
[2:09] misunderstood brother branham said for
[2:11] when the church goes up that's the last
[2:13] of the church until she comes with her
[2:15] lord
[2:16] as bride and bridegroom in the 19th
[2:18] chapter
[2:19] during this time it's dealing with
[2:22] israel
[2:23] so you'll see this fact that brother
[2:24] branham seems to say that
[2:26] revelation chapters 4 through 19 are all
[2:28] about israel
[2:30] but again we have quotes from brother
[2:31] brown that say different than that
[2:34] but let's listen to the quote god
[2:36] dealing with israel or when the church
[2:39] goes up that's the last of the church
[2:41] until she comes with her lord his bride
[2:43] and bridegroom in the 19th chapter
[2:46] during this time is dealing with israel
[2:50] next in 1961 the 70th week of daniel's
[2:53] sermon brother ram said the sixth
[2:55] chapter was all jewish
[2:57] which is quite a statement since that's
[2:59] completely opposite of what he taught in
[3:01] the seven seals so again we can see how
[3:04] brother random grew in revelation
[3:06] and friends remember the first four
[3:07] seals dealt with the early church
[3:10] covering the last two thousand years
[3:12] let's listen to the quote
[3:14] the church leaves on the third chapter
[3:17] of revelations nothing said in there
[3:19] about nothing was just the last thing
[3:20] was the last messenger of the age
[3:24] then we deal with the jews until the
[3:27] coming again with the bride of the 19th
[3:29] chapter from the 6th to the 19th chapter
[3:32] is all
[3:33] jewish
[3:36] in the next quote from 1964 the feast of
[3:38] trumpets
[3:40] brother branham said the first three
[3:41] chapters of the book of revelation
[3:43] reveals all the happenings unto the
[3:45] church
[3:46] and then he says the church is not seen
[3:48] anymore after the end of the third
[3:50] chapter unto the 19th chapter of
[3:51] revelation
[3:53] and then again he says
[3:54] god is dealing with israel in the
[3:56] chapters between
[3:58] let's listen to the quote the first uh
[4:02] three chapters of the book of
[4:03] revelations
[4:05] reveals all the happenings onto the
[4:08] church
[4:09] then from the third chapter unto the
[4:12] 19th chapter of revelation
[4:14] there is no more seeing of the church
[4:17] the church goes up at the fourth chapter
[4:20] of revelations and returns back at the
[4:23] 19th chapter of revelations the bride
[4:27] and the groom together coming to the
[4:29] earth and then from the 19th chapter
[4:33] to the conclusive of the 22nd chapter
[4:36] it's all on the millennium and what will
[4:39] be in the years that is to follow during
[4:42] the 4th to the 19th god is dealing with
[4:46] israel
[4:49] in this fourth and final quote it's from
[4:51] 1964 questions and answers part three
[4:54] brother random basically said the same
[4:55] thing as he said in the previous quote
[4:57] from the feast of trumpets
[4:59] he said the first three chapters of
[5:00] revelation
[5:02] that's all to the church
[5:04] he says the rest of it is the jews there
[5:07] let's listen to the quote
[5:09] read the first three chapters of
[5:10] revelations you get what the church is
[5:12] right there that's all to the church and
[5:14] when she comes back with the bride once
[5:16] you come back read if you don't know
[5:17] about the church what pertains to read
[5:19] revelations
[5:21] the first three chapters and then go
[5:23] over to the 19th chapter and start
[5:25] reading from there if you get the rest
[5:27] of it it's in the jews there
[5:30] brother branham quotes saying the bride
[5:32] church or bride members
[5:34] are seen in revelation chapters 4
[5:37] through 14.
[5:39] we'll go in order of the book of
[5:40] revelation we'll begin at revelation
[5:42] chapter 4
[5:44] and revelation chapter 4 verse 4
[5:46] says there are 4 in 20 seats in heaven
[5:50] and god's prophet brother branham said
[5:52] 12 of those seats were for bride members
[5:55] or the 12 original apostles of the lord
[5:57] jesus christ and of course we know
[6:00] matthias took judas's scared spot so
[6:02] judas iscariot does not have a throne in
[6:04] heaven he went to his own place he was
[6:06] the son of perdition judas iscariot went
[6:08] to hell
[6:09] and so consider this friends we see some
[6:11] bride members in revelation chapter 4.
[6:15] let's listen to the
[6:17] quote how many was he 20 and four
[6:21] 24 elders is that right
[6:23] now
[6:24] oh my who was it the twelve apostles
[6:28] and the twelve tribes of israel
[6:30] the twelve patriarchs
[6:34] revelation chapter 5 we see a repeat of
[6:37] the same bride members
[6:39] in verse 8 it again names the 24 elders
[6:42] 12 of them were bride members and the
[6:44] other 12 were the 12 sons of israel and
[6:48] in verse 13
[6:49] the bible said every creature which is
[6:51] in heaven and on the earth and under the
[6:54] sea and such as are in the sea and all
[6:56] that are in them heard i sang
[6:59] of course this is speaking of saint john
[7:02] so saint john was no doubt a bride
[7:03] member
[7:04] so we see a beautiful picture of the
[7:07] supernatural nature of visions here john
[7:10] is in a vision
[7:11] seeing himself as one of those 24 elders
[7:14] in the heavenly dimension and of course
[7:16] god's prophet brother branham said john
[7:18] saw his name on the lamb's book of life
[7:20] causing him to rejoice
[7:22] let's listen to the quote
[7:24] and uh john said everybody in heaven
[7:26] everything beneath the earth everything
[7:27] you're him praising god about it john
[7:30] was without his name on there doing
[7:31] david all that time then he said he is
[7:35] worthy to take the book of redemption
[7:39] in revelation chapter 6 we see even more
[7:42] mentions of the bride or church from
[7:44] brother branham
[7:46] in this first quote in the first seal
[7:47] brother branham said the white horse
[7:48] rider rode during the first church age
[7:51] the first seal dealt with the beginning
[7:54] of the gentile church ages let's listen
[7:56] to the quote oh anti souls close to the
[8:00] sea the very elect
[8:02] here he is he's the antichrist he
[8:04] started riding the first church age now
[8:06] he rides on down on down through every
[8:09] age i
[8:10] watch next in the second seal brother
[8:13] branham said
[8:14] the red horse rider wrote during the
[8:16] dark ages which was in the fourth church
[8:18] age
[8:19] and there were bride members of course
[8:21] during the fourth church age
[8:23] so we see what the bride members were
[8:25] anointed by during the church ages
[8:27] the line anointing the ox anointing and
[8:31] also the evil spirit they were combating
[8:34] the white horse rider and the red horse
[8:36] rider let's listen to the quote
[8:48] there's a seal
[8:55] they admit
[8:57] 68 million all their mortarology besides
[9:00] all those cut to death outside of that
[9:03] oh mercy
[9:05] during the dark ages there were millions
[9:08] fed the lions and slaughtering that way
[9:11] because they wouldn't bow down to that
[9:13] catholic document
[9:16] in the third seal brother branham said
[9:17] the black horse rider rode during the
[9:19] dark ages
[9:21] of course the dark ages were during the
[9:22] time of the church ages
[9:24] the holy ghost filled saints had the
[9:25] anointing of a man
[9:27] and they were battling the black horse
[9:29] rider
[9:30] let's listen to the quote
[9:32] he started riding him
[9:36] in the time of the dark ages
[9:39] that's what the dark horse represented
[9:42] the dark ages for it was a time of
[9:45] midnight to the true believers
[9:47] that was lit
[9:49] watch now and that church age
[9:53] at middle church is the dark church
[9:57] in the next quote from the fourth seal
[9:58] brother ram said
[10:00] the message of the four horse riders
[10:02] from revelation chapter 6 was one of the
[10:04] main messages to the church at this time
[10:07] so the bride believers of brother
[10:09] branham's day or our day
[10:11] needed to know the messages about the
[10:13] four horse riders
[10:15] in order that we might understand church
[10:17] history
[10:18] and also overcome the rider of our day
[10:21] the pale horse rider
[10:22] so brother branham is saying bride
[10:24] members today needed to know what
[10:26] previous bride members had gone through
[10:29] under the first three seals
[10:31] because we know in the four seal we're
[10:32] battling the same spirit
[10:34] because the same rider just changed
[10:35] horses
[10:37] so bride members today will overcome the
[10:39] antichrist spear
[10:40] let's listen to the quote
[10:42] just uh thought this one wouldn't come
[10:45] but it finally did
[10:47] so i'm so thankful that being the last
[10:50] of those four harsh writers
[10:52] which i
[10:53] think is one of the
[10:55] main messages to the church at this time
[10:59] the next sermon from the fifth seal
[11:02] brother brown gives us many mentions of
[11:03] how the church is mentioned in the first
[11:06] four seals
[11:07] in paragraph 116 brother branham said
[11:10] god sent another one after him to combat
[11:13] it to hold his church
[11:15] so brother brahm's talking about how the
[11:16] holy ghost anointing of the four beasts
[11:20] would come upon the bride or church
[11:22] members
[11:23] and that anointing would help them
[11:24] overcome satan's four riders
[11:27] let's listen to the quote
[11:29] he went out again as a red horse rider
[11:33] another color another power another
[11:35] mystery god sent another one entry
[11:38] to combat of the holy shirt
[11:40] sent the third one again god said his
[11:43] third beast coming now said he said the
[11:46] fourth one god sent his fourth one
[11:49] and then the antichrist in and the
[11:52] church ages ended two at that
[11:54] time
[11:56] in paragraph 124 brother branham
[11:58] mentions
[11:59] why the early church had healings
[12:01] miracles and visions and power
[12:04] it was because of the anointing of the
[12:06] line of the tribe of judah
[12:08] and he said it had to ride during the
[12:09] first church the apostolic
[12:12] so the first seal had to do with the
[12:13] bride members of the early church let's
[12:16] listen to the quote
[12:18] that's the reason early church had
[12:20] healings and miracles and visions and
[12:23] power
[12:25] is because it was the living word in the
[12:28] form of the light of the tribe of judah
[12:30] right now to combat that
[12:33] amen now you got it
[12:35] he sends his power antichrist god chance
[12:38] is the word
[12:40] antichrist false teaching the true
[12:42] teaching went with it
[12:44] the combat
[12:45] that was a person now
[12:48] this was the first church
[12:50] apostolic that went to media
[12:54] in paragraph 129 during the thyroid or
[12:57] church age
[12:58] the little church had to just simply
[13:00] labor with the ox anointing so he's
[13:03] speaking directly of the bride church
[13:05] members during the church ages
[13:07] and the bride members could only live
[13:09] based upon the anointing that they'd
[13:11] received from heaven
[13:12] and then in paragraph 130 he said the
[13:14] same thing about the ox anointing
[13:17] and how the saints just freely gave
[13:18] their lives in the dark ages let's
[13:21] listen to the quotes
[13:22] see that shows that the phytara age
[13:26] as the antichrist got settled down and
[13:29] come into the thought of the age the
[13:31] little church
[13:33] could do nothing
[13:34] but just
[13:35] just simply labor
[13:39] next in paragraph 140 brother branham
[13:41] said the opening of the seals proved
[13:43] church history and the four beast powers
[13:46] that were let loose upon the church they
[13:49] were anointings and the believers
[13:51] couldn't do nothing else let's listen to
[13:53] the quote
[13:54] i will prove to you by the history of
[13:57] the church
[13:58] and by the the opening of the seals and
[14:01] the powers that let loose and watch
[14:03] exactly the church responded to the
[14:06] anointing and they couldn't do nothing
[14:08] else
[14:11] next in paragraph 145 brother brandon
[14:14] mentioned the spirit of the church in
[14:16] that day was sacrifice labor he said
[14:18] they were anointed with a true spirit of
[14:20] god of that age
[14:22] 68 million of them died
[14:25] he said the ox sacrifice anointing
[14:28] let's listen to the quotes
[14:30] because the spirit of the church and
[14:33] that they will sacrifice
[14:36] labor
[14:37] and their walkthroughs as freely as they
[14:39] can walk anointed with the true spirit
[14:41] of god of that age
[14:44] and die like heroes and sacrifice
[14:47] thousands times thousands
[14:49] 68 million of them
[14:52] on the record
[14:54] in paragraph 150 brother branham
[14:56] mentions the cunningness of god's wisdom
[15:00] anointing the believers during the age
[15:01] of the reformation
[15:03] so he's speaking of the third seal which
[15:04] dealt with the bride members during the
[15:07] church ages let's listen to the
[15:11] i went quote combat with the continuous
[15:14] of god's wisdom with him
[15:16] that was the age of the reformation
[15:21] martin luther john wesley and so forth
[15:24] see it was a reformation
[15:28] paragraph 164 brother makes a powerful
[15:30] statement that god put a spirit of
[15:32] wisdom upon martin luther and john
[15:35] wesley and he said they brought the
[15:37] church from its pagan ceremonies of
[15:39] idolatry back to god again
[15:42] so during the third seal we saw the holy
[15:44] ghost anoint the preachers of the
[15:47] reformation
[15:48] to bring the church back to god again
[15:51] the bride church
[15:52] so the bride is seen in the first four
[15:55] seals let's listen to the quote
[15:57] but see at that time of all the man's
[16:01] being see
[16:03] god put a spirit of wisdom upon man to
[16:06] understand it's wrong
[16:08] now that was to combat the third beast
[16:12] that got the church so corrupt that he
[16:14] was riding that it was terrible they're
[16:16] informed
[16:17] uh
[16:18] uh what did they do then they in the
[16:20] reformers age they brought the church
[16:23] from its pagan ceremonies of idolatry
[16:26] back to god again
[16:29] in paragraph 177 we receive an amazing
[16:32] statement from brother branham
[16:34] he said don't forget it class
[16:36] remember all the days of your life these
[16:38] beasts are correct it's thus saith the
[16:40] lord
[16:41] and then immediately after that he talks
[16:43] about the man beast anointing with the
[16:45] power of god
[16:46] the wisdom that god gave them
[16:49] brought the church from idolatry back to
[16:51] god so friends we have thus saith the
[16:54] lord that the first four seals are
[16:55] speaking
[16:56] of the four holy ghost anointings that
[16:58] god sent down from heaven to anoint the
[17:01] bride members throughout the church ages
[17:04] let's listen to the quote
[17:06] i don't forget this class don't forget
[17:10] remember
[17:12] all the days of your life
[17:15] these beasts are correct it's thus saith
[17:18] the lord
[17:21] notice
[17:22] idolatry brought the
[17:25] man
[17:27] beast went forth
[17:29] with the power of god by wisdom that god
[17:32] gave him and brought the church from
[17:34] idolatry back to god
[17:38] in paragraph 185 brother makes a
[17:40] beautiful statement he never knew the
[17:42] beast before he was just sitting there
[17:45] and then saw move up in a vision
[17:47] so see how a vision changed brother rams
[17:50] thinking
[17:51] he had thought revelation 4 to 19 was
[17:53] all jewish
[17:54] but the vision of the holy ghost showed
[17:56] him that there was bride anointings in
[17:58] revelation chapter four five and six
[18:01] because all three chapters mention the
[18:03] four beasts
[18:04] let's listen to the quote
[18:06] and you're around beast uh uh i never
[18:09] knew that before i was just sitting
[18:11] there getting moved up there just the
[18:12] same as you're looking at me
[18:14] and it's got to be right because it's
[18:17] right here with the bible so how are you
[18:18] going to do anything else but say it's
[18:20] right
[18:23] next from paragraphs 193 to 214 brother
[18:27] branham begins looking at the eagle
[18:29] anointing which was the holy ghost
[18:30] anointing upon him and the believers of
[18:33] this day
[18:34] so the fourth seal is all about the
[18:36] gentile bride of our church age you and
[18:39] i by god's grace
[18:41] so is the bride scene in revelation
[18:42] chapter 6 yes
[18:44] the bride members of our day are seen in
[18:46] the fourth seal we have the flying eagle
[18:49] anointing in paragraph 193 brother brahm
[18:52] said the last power is the eagle power
[18:54] to restore the children back to the
[18:56] original faith again of course quoting
[18:58] malachi 4 verses 5 and 6 and then he
[19:01] quotes revelation 10 verses 1 to 7.
[19:04] let's listen to the quotes
[19:08] he brings down the eagle to restore
[19:11] the children back to the original faith
[19:14] again
[19:18] don't you notice there's no more beasts
[19:21] that's all of us
[19:26] amen now if you would take now
[19:28] revelations 10 1-7
[19:31] i've been referring to it remember in
[19:33] the last messenger's age
[19:37] see what was to happen
[19:39] all
[19:41] of the mysteries of god would be
[19:44] revealed
[19:48] in paragraph 211 brother random said
[19:50] this eagle anointing has got to come to
[19:52] this seer based upon revelation 10 1-7
[19:56] let's listen to the quote
[19:58] every word of god is brought the bible
[20:00] doesn't change the system at all
[20:03] it's the same thing it's got to come to
[20:05] this seer that we're expecting to arrive
[20:08] now notice
[20:09] revelations 10
[20:11] 1 7.
[20:13] and then in paragraph 214 brother
[20:15] branham said isn't this the prophet
[20:17] we're looking to come
[20:18] some man anointed with the spirit of
[20:20] elijah but abram said his very ministry
[20:22] would restore the people back to the
[20:25] original faith of the fathers let's
[20:27] listen to the quote
[20:29] now
[20:30] isn't the prophet that we're looking to
[20:32] come some man anointed with the with the
[20:35] spirit uh like elijah it won't be elijah
[20:37] of course but to be a man like that will
[20:40] come down and his very ministry
[20:43] is to send
[20:45] to restore back to this fallen people in
[20:48] these denominational twists back to the
[20:51] original faith of the father
[20:58] [Applause]
[21:01] now friends no doubt there's more quotes
[21:03] like this in the seven seals series but
[21:06] i'm gonna go ahead and move on to
[21:07] revelation chapter seven
[21:09] friends we see either the bride or the
[21:11] foolish virgin at the end of revelation
[21:13] chapter seven now of course i believe
[21:15] it's the bride and if you'd like to
[21:17] watch my video about that you can easily
[21:20] find it on my youtube channel it was my
[21:22] 87th video
[21:24] it's called is revelation 7 the wise
[21:26] bride or foolish virgin
[21:29] so again revelation chapter 7 is not all
[21:31] jewish
[21:32] either the bride or foolish virgin is in
[21:34] revelation chapter 7.
[21:37] revelation chapter 8 the seven seals
[21:39] mentioned and the seventh seal is the
[21:41] literal day and hour of jesus christ
[21:44] coming for his gentile bride
[21:46] there are numerous quotes from brother
[21:48] branham about this subject
[21:49] let's just listen to a couple
[21:52] a lamb took his book from the seventh
[21:54] seal just ready for it to be opened the
[21:56] sixth seal
[21:57] remember he hid the seventh seal from us
[22:00] he wouldn't do it when the angel stood
[22:02] day by day telling him but then he
[22:03] wouldn't do it on that so there's
[22:04] silence in heaven no one knew
[22:07] it was the coming of the
[22:11] and lord comes from heaven with ten
[22:13] thousands times ten thousands of his
[22:15] saints and the bible says that the
[22:17] heavens was empty for the space of a
[22:19] half hour
[22:21] where is this big fellow god damn
[22:23] see he's in christ
[22:27] in revelation chapter 10 brother
[22:29] branham's ministry is seen in verses 1
[22:31] through 7 and then verses 8 through 11
[22:34] is the ministry of the bride who eats
[22:36] the little book eats the revelation of
[22:38] the seven seals and goes and prophesies
[22:40] it again to the rest of the world so of
[22:43] course revelation chapters 10 is not all
[22:45] jewish i'm not going to play quotes
[22:47] about that because i've already played
[22:48] quotes about that from the fifth seal
[22:51] that brother branham preached earlier
[22:53] in revelation 13 verse 16 we see the
[22:56] bride according to brother branham
[22:58] in the sermon from 1962 spoken word is
[23:01] original seed brother brahm said the
[23:03] bride would be forced to stop preaching
[23:05] by the ecumenical system the b system so
[23:09] again we see the bride in revelation
[23:10] chapter 13. let's listen to the quote
[23:13] i believe someday
[23:15] the real bride of christ
[23:18] will be
[23:22] force to stop preaching the word
[23:26] of god
[23:27] the bible prophesies of it in
[23:29] revelations 13 16 if you want to put it
[23:31] down
[23:33] denominations will force it to stop or
[23:36] take its mark
[23:39] then when the lamb
[23:41] will take his bride and judge the lord
[23:44] for this
[23:47] in revelation chapter 14 verses 6
[23:49] through 12 brother branham taught that
[23:51] we see the last three church age
[23:53] messengers
[23:54] and of course that would be martin
[23:55] luther john wesley and brother branham
[23:58] brother ram taught this in the mark of
[24:00] the beast and the seal of god part 2
[24:02] from 1961. let's listen to the quotes
[24:06] i know i'd like you to scout
[24:08] your pencils to write this down i'd like
[24:11] to write down revelations 14 6-12 that's
[24:14] the three last angels three angels at
[24:17] the seventh angel there were three
[24:20] special angels come forth did you notice
[24:23] that
[24:25] watch
[24:27] the first angel at the reformation leave
[24:29] her
[24:31] preach the gospel
[24:34] second angel wesley's sanctification the
[24:36] fornication is straightened up for the
[24:38] church but the third message the
[24:40] pentecostal message should be the true
[24:42] messenger warning them to escape the
[24:46] mark of the be sin whosoever receives
[24:48] the mark of the beast was saying will
[24:50] drink the wrath of god poured out that
[24:51] mixture into the cup a big dignity
[24:53] poured out of all the people
[24:55] that's the very message today
[24:58] the third angel the third message the
[25:00] last message the lutheran message of
[25:02] justification the wesley message of
[25:04] sanctification and the pentecostal
[25:07] message of the seal of god
[25:09] escape the american of these
[25:13] be conquerors into the kingdom of god
[25:17] seven proofs the book of revelation is
[25:20] not in chronological order
[25:22] friends there's at least seven proofs
[25:24] but there could be more that the book of
[25:26] revelation is not in chronological order
[25:29] the first example is the first four
[25:31] seals of revelation chapter six
[25:34] according to brother branham these were
[25:35] actually taking place at the same time
[25:37] as revelation chapters two and three so
[25:40] the first four seals of revelation 6 did
[25:42] not happen after revelation 2 and 3 they
[25:45] happened at the same time
[25:47] the second example is the trumpets of
[25:49] revelation chapters 8 and 9.
[25:52] these trumpets cannot be blown before
[25:54] the mystery of god is finished to the
[25:56] gentiles in revelation chapter 10
[25:59] because the mystery of god must be
[26:00] finished first and then destruction
[26:02] would come
[26:03] wrath would come upon the world for
[26:05] rejecting revelation 10 1-7
[26:08] this is also proven by the fact that the
[26:10] first trumpet cannot be blown
[26:13] until the 144 000 saints are sealed by
[26:16] the baptism of the holy ghost as seen in
[26:18] revelation chapter 7 verse 3. so please
[26:21] read that scripture
[26:22] and then also read revelation 8 verse 7
[26:25] because there we see trees are destroyed
[26:29] so again this proves revelation 8 and 9
[26:31] is not chronologically before revelation
[26:33] chapter 10.
[26:35] a third example is revelation 10 verses
[26:37] 8 through 11. it's a ministry to the
[26:40] gentiles as we mentioned earlier
[26:42] the open book prophecy is taken to every
[26:44] people nation tongue and tribe
[26:47] of course this would happen before the
[26:48] beginning of revelation 7
[26:51] when the 144 000 jews are sealed by the
[26:54] baptism of the holy ghost
[26:56] so we can see revelation 10 8 through 11
[26:59] happens before revelation chapter 7.
[27:02] in revelation chapter 12 there's
[27:03] numerous things that are not in
[27:05] chronological order
[27:06] such as the war in heaven
[27:08] when satan was cast out by michael the
[27:11] archangel
[27:12] of course that happened way before the
[27:14] church ages
[27:15] but yet it's in revelation chapter 12 so
[27:17] we see it's not in order
[27:19] also in revelation chapter 12 you see
[27:21] the birth of the man child
[27:24] speaking of jesus christ's birth
[27:26] well of course jesus christ birth was
[27:28] before the church ages it was before
[27:30] revelation chapters two and three so we
[27:32] can again see how the book of revelation
[27:34] is not in chronological order
[27:36] a fifth example is brother branham
[27:38] taught revelation 13 verses 1 to 10 was
[27:41] during the church ages
[27:43] this was when the beast was wounded to
[27:45] death brother branham said the pagan
[27:47] roman empire but came back to life as
[27:50] the holy roman empire and brother ram
[27:52] taught this in chapter 5 of the church
[27:54] age book let's listen to the quote
[27:57] and right in this age is when the feast
[27:59] of revelation 13 3 that was wounded to
[28:02] death the pagan roman empire came back
[28:05] to life and power as the holy roman
[28:07] empire
[28:09] rome as a material nation had suffered
[28:11] much depletion and soon would suffer it
[28:14] completely
[28:15] but it mattered not now for her
[28:17] religious empire would keep her on top
[28:19] of the world governing from the inside
[28:20] where she would not appear to do so from
[28:22] the outside
[28:24] and again you can see how revelation 13
[28:27] 1-10
[28:28] does not fully deal with the jews
[28:31] because there's gentiles mentioned
[28:33] so again just more proof that brother
[28:35] branham grew in revelation on this
[28:36] subject
[28:38] a sixth example is the prophecy of the
[28:40] united states in revelation chapter 13.
[28:43] brother braham said the beast out of the
[28:45] land was the united states
[28:47] and the united states had power to make
[28:49] fire come down from heaven which he said
[28:51] was the atomic bombs of world war ii
[28:54] from revelation 13 verse 13.
[28:57] of course this took place during the
[28:59] seventh church age
[29:00] and this quote is from the mark of the
[29:02] beast 1954. let's listen to the quote
[29:06] two horns like a lamb not a lamb
[29:09] what is it it's our american buffalo
[29:12] sure
[29:13] see there he is two horns like a lamb
[29:16] but then what he knew he would have
[29:18] freedom of religion first he acted like
[29:20] a lamb
[29:21] he spoke like a lamb
[29:23] but remember he never didn't become an
[29:24] old ram
[29:26] he was the lamb
[29:28] this country's only 150 years old you
[29:30] know
[29:31] just the land
[29:32] and then he speak like a dragon
[29:36] and he exercised all the power of the
[29:39] first beast had before the red dragon
[29:41] and caused all that was on the earth to
[29:43] dwell upon the earth to worship the
[29:46] beast whose deadly womb was healed
[29:49] [Applause]
[29:51] and and he does great wonders so to make
[29:54] so far come down our heaven the atomic
[29:56] bomb and hydrogen smart intelligent
[29:58] nation and so forth deceiving the
[30:00] nations by these things this united
[30:02] states will come to a time that church
[30:04] and state will unite together
[30:08] a seventh and final example as brother
[30:10] ram said revelation 13 verse 16 will be
[30:13] the bride being forced to stop preaching
[30:16] the bride is still preaching now
[30:18] so this is not yet fulfilled
[30:20] and yet brother branham said the bride
[30:22] went up in revelation 4 verse 1.
[30:25] so we see the bride is still here in
[30:27] revelation chapter 13.
[30:29] and remember friends brother ram said
[30:30] the holy spirit told him to pick up his
[30:32] pen and write this about the bride
[30:35] so let's listen to both quotes
[30:37] the quote where brother branham said the
[30:38] church went up in revelation chapter 4
[30:40] verse 1 because the door was open in
[30:42] heaven
[30:43] and let's again hear the quote about the
[30:44] bride being forced to stop preaching
[30:48] revelations 4 1
[30:50] after the church was gone then
[30:53] a
[30:54] door was open and we went through all
[30:56] that and found that that was christ was
[30:58] the door and the same voice that was
[31:01] walking in the midst of the seven golden
[31:02] candlesticks also was the same voice he
[31:06] heard in heaven saying come up hither
[31:09] john went up that represented the church
[31:12] going in the rapture
[31:15] i believe sunday
[31:17] the real bride of christ
[31:20] will be
[31:24] forced to stop preaching the word
[31:28] of god
[31:29] the bible prophesies of it in
[31:31] revelations 13 16 if you want to put it
[31:33] down
[31:34] denominations will force it to stop
[31:37] or take its mark
[31:41] then when the lamb
[31:43] will take his pride and judge the horde
[31:46] for this
[31:48] brother branham likely got this idea
[31:51] about the church not being seen from
[31:53] clarence larkin
[31:55] last year when i was studying clarence
[31:56] larkin i came across this quote
[31:58] from his book dispensational truce
[32:01] chapter 11.
[32:03] larkin wrote and i quote
[32:05] the book of revelation is written in
[32:07] chronological order after the fourth
[32:09] chapter the church is seen no more upon
[32:12] the earth until she appears in the 19th
[32:14] chapter coming with the bridegroom from
[32:16] heaven end quote
[32:18] of course we know brother branham
[32:19] studied clarence larkin
[32:21] brother branham appreciated clarence
[32:22] larkin even thanked him
[32:25] when i saw this quote from clarence
[32:27] larkin it seemed as if this is perhaps
[32:29] where brother random got it from now i'm
[32:31] not sure but because brother branham
[32:33] said this at least four times
[32:35] almost these same exact words
[32:37] it seems that brother brown may have got
[32:38] it from larkin
[32:40] and recall friends brother branham was
[32:41] not a plagiarist
[32:43] as i have one video and one podcast that
[32:46] proved this fact
[32:48] my june 30th 2021 video called clarence
[32:51] larkin william branham and the
[32:52] plagiarism accusation
[32:54] labors on this subject
[32:56] and there is undeniable proof brother
[32:58] branham was not a plagiarist
[33:00] it only seems brother branham forgot to
[33:02] quote larkin about the future home
[33:04] sermon
[33:05] but again let's give him the benefit of
[33:07] the doubt he was a genuine servant of
[33:09] god he seemed to just make a human
[33:11] mistake and forgot to cite larkin but
[33:13] brother brandon's main emphasis was on
[33:16] the three works of grace which clarence
[33:18] larkin did not teach
[33:20] and that is the thought that brother and
[33:21] got from god which was the thought that
[33:24] as the earth had to go through three
[33:25] works for purification so does each
[33:27] individual believer have to go through
[33:29] three works of purification
[33:31] justification sanctification and the
[33:33] baptism of the holy ghost
[33:35] and then friends on my april 27 2022
[33:39] podcast number three
[33:41] called seven seals plagiarized no jesus
[33:44] revealed seven seals to brother branham
[33:46] charles tays russell
[33:48] i clearly show how brother ram did not
[33:50] plagiarize the seven seals from either
[33:52] clarence larkin nor charles tays russell
[33:56] remember friends in the 1960 church age
[33:59] sermon series brother branham referenced
[34:01] historians on at least 20 occasions
[34:04] and specifically said the dates he used
[34:07] for them were from historians
[34:09] in 1961 brother branham thanked clarence
[34:12] larkin by name during his series on the
[34:14] daniel 70 weeks
[34:16] and then in 1964 brother branham plainly
[34:19] stated that he had read clarence
[34:21] larkin's work during the week he
[34:23] preached the seven seals
[34:25] but again remember brother branham's
[34:26] revelations were vastly different than
[34:29] larkin's teachings they only agreed on
[34:31] the sixth seal
[34:32] so on the six other seals brother
[34:34] branham and larkin totally disagreed
[34:37] proving brother and got his revelations
[34:39] from the lord jesus christ
[34:41] in closing
[34:43] i hope this video has been a blessing
[34:45] friends it's another exercise of rightly
[34:48] dividing the word of truth
[34:50] brother branham was a genuine prophet of
[34:51] god but of course not every word he said
[34:54] on tape was thus saith the lord
[34:56] and this video again shows how brother
[34:57] adam could repeat a statement that he
[34:59] believed over and over again
[35:01] believing the bride was not seen from
[35:03] revelation 4 to 19 but then when we look
[35:06] at more quotes from brother branham we
[35:08] see that god showed him visions
[35:10] of the four beasts and then showed how
[35:12] those four beasts were anointings on the
[35:15] bride members during the church ages in
[35:17] revelation chapter 6. and of course we
[35:19] know brother brahms ministry was in
[35:21] revelation chapter 10. so we can plainly
[35:23] see it's our duty as ministers as
[35:25] believers to rightly divide the word of
[35:28] truth prove all things by the scripture
[35:30] take everything back to the word of god
[35:33] to confirm it as brother branham taught
[35:35] us and of course as the bible commands
[35:37] us to do
[35:38] so we're grateful that jesus's words are
[35:41] true today he said the holy ghost will
[35:43] guide you into all truth that's exactly
[35:45] what jesus christ is doing so we praise
[35:47] his holy name for that and we thank him
[35:49] for the anointing of the holy spirit the
[35:51] spirit of truth that allows us to do
[35:53] this
[35:54] if you have any questions concerns or
[35:56] testimonies about this video please
[35:58] contact me
[36:01] god bless you and may jesus christ be
[36:03] the desire of your heart
