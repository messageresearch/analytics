[0:04] but remember god told him that his legs
[0:07] would come off and he'd go on his belly
[0:10] and you can't find one bone in a snake
[0:12] it looks like a human being and that's
[0:14] reason science is lost
[0:18] greetings friends in the matches name of
[0:20] the lord jesus christ
[0:22] the purpose of this video is to share
[0:24] more evidence that the serpent seed
[0:26] teaching is the eternal truth of god
[0:30] i'll reference two publications
[0:33] also review the nine proofs of the
[0:35] serpent seed teaching
[0:37] and again define the trees and fruits
[0:40] from the garden of eden and genesis
[0:43] chapter 3.
[0:45] the two publications are first
[0:47] an article called blueprint for limbs
[0:50] encoded in the snake genome
[0:52] from the university of georgia
[0:55] 2015
[0:57] and the second publication
[0:59] is national geographic kids september
[1:02] 2017.
[1:05] in october 2015 the university of
[1:07] georgia discovered snakes once had legs
[1:11] researchers reported snakes have dna
[1:13] that controls the development and growth
[1:16] of limbs
[1:18] so seven years ago when i saw this
[1:19] article i was very pleasantly surprised
[1:21] because it lines up with the bible
[1:23] revelation about the serpent before the
[1:26] fall
[1:27] the serpent was an upright creature
[1:29] before the fall
[1:30] because after the fall in verse 14 of
[1:33] genesis chapter 3 god curses the serpent
[1:36] to go on his belly the rest of his days
[1:39] so originally the serpent was likely an
[1:42] upright creature
[1:44] between something like a chimpanzee and
[1:46] a man
[1:47] but closer to a man because he was
[1:50] standing upright and able to carry on in
[1:52] intellectual conversation with the
[1:54] deceived eve
[1:56] two years later my children were reading
[1:58] a national geographic kids magazine in
[2:00] september 2017 and one of my children
[2:03] brought the magazine up to me and showed
[2:04] me this picture which i'll show it to
[2:06] you right now and the article said
[2:08] snakes once had legs
[2:10] so it's likely national geographic kids
[2:13] magazine was referencing this article
[2:15] from the university of georgia
[2:18] friend god's word and his revelation are
[2:20] eternally true even in regards to snakes
[2:24] and the serpent seed
[2:26] so again before the fall the serpent was
[2:28] an upright standing creature
[2:30] the bible said he was more subtle which
[2:32] means shrewd slyer crafty than any beast
[2:35] of the field that the lord god had made
[2:38] he was the only beast god made with the
[2:40] ability to talk with intellectual
[2:42] reasoning
[2:43] when satan observed those human-like
[2:45] characteristics in the serpent
[2:47] satan selected the serpent to possess
[2:49] him
[2:50] so he could deceive eve
[2:52] because remember the scripture says
[2:54] satan was present in eden
[2:56] in ezekiel 28 13.
[3:00] the bible is clear the serpent
[3:02] originally had legs he stood upon
[3:04] but because he submitted to satan and
[3:06] then deceived eve god cursed him took
[3:09] off his legs changed every bone in his
[3:12] body as god's prophet brother branham
[3:16] but taught god told him that his legs
[3:19] would come off and he'd go on his belly
[3:22] and you can't find one bone in a snake
[3:25] it looks like a human being and that's
[3:26] reason science is lost
[3:29] but there he is
[3:31] hid it from the eyes of the wives and
[3:33] prudent and promised to reveal it to the
[3:35] sons of god in the last days when the
[3:37] sons of god be made manifest
[3:41] he said serpent now he was a reptile
[3:43] then he was able to settle with all the
[3:45] beasts in the field and he said kirsten
[3:47] is you and he took his legs from him and
[3:49] up on his belly and go all the days
[3:52] of his life that should be as neat and
[3:54] he hated that's where he is today
[3:58] let's review the nine proofs that the
[4:00] serpent seed teaching is correct
[4:03] evidence number one the bible supports
[4:05] the serpent seed doctrine from genesis
[4:07] to revelation
[4:09] moses jesus paul peter and john all
[4:12] support the serpent serpent-seed
[4:13] teaching through their writings or their
[4:15] words
[4:18] evidence two the two trees in the midst
[4:20] of the garden were not literal trees
[4:22] because the tree of knowledge of good
[4:24] and evil was not good for food
[4:27] genesis 2 verse 9 says every tree out of
[4:29] the ground was good for food proving the
[4:32] tree of knowledge of good and evil was
[4:34] not a regular tree because when eve
[4:36] partook of its fruit sin and death
[4:39] occurred
[4:40] two truths about this evil tree are
[4:42] evident first it didn't come from the
[4:44] ground
[4:46] and its fruit was not good for food
[4:48] any tree whose fruit will kill you isn't
[4:51] good for food
[4:54] evidence three the tree of life was
[4:56] jesus's spirit because there is only one
[4:58] way to eternal life
[5:02] evidence 4 the serpent seed explains the
[5:04] purpose of the virgin birth of jesus
[5:09] evidence 5 adam and eve covered their
[5:11] loins after eating of the forbidden
[5:14] fruit
[5:16] evidence 6 god's punishments for eve's
[5:19] sin centered on her sexual reproduction
[5:22] and longing for adam
[5:26] evidence 7 the serpent was human-like
[5:28] before the fall
[5:29] this proof was discussed earlier in the
[5:31] video
[5:34] evidence 8 cain was the serpent's son
[5:37] and not adams
[5:40] in evidence number nine the seed of the
[5:42] woman was a literal man jesus and so the
[5:45] seed of the serpent was a literal man
[5:47] cain
[5:51] now we'll define the trees and fruits
[5:53] from genesis chapter 3.
[5:56] the two trees in the midst of the garden
[5:58] known as a tree of life and tree of
[6:00] knowledge of good and evil were symbolic
[6:02] of the two spirits of jesus christ and
[6:05] satan
[6:06] these two trees were not literal trees
[6:09] like all the other trees in the garden
[6:11] as proven by genesis 2 verse 9.
[6:14] god's prophet brother branham said jesus
[6:16] christ is the tree of life in the church
[6:18] age book
[6:20] he said satan was a tree of knowledge of
[6:22] good and evil the scriptures prove this
[6:24] to be true because there are numerous
[6:26] verses that call jesus life or eternal
[6:29] life such as first john chapter 5 verses
[6:33] 11 and 20
[6:34] and then john 14 6 says jesus is the
[6:37] only life
[6:39] and jesus said satan is the father of
[6:41] lies and a murder from the beginning and
[6:43] he only comes to steal kill and destroy
[6:46] so satan must be the father or tree of
[6:49] death
[6:51] now you could also call the tree of
[6:52] knowledge of good and evil
[6:54] the antichrist spirit or the spirit of
[6:56] death or the spirit of unbelief
[6:59] these are just synonyms for what satan
[7:01] is all about
[7:02] these are the characteristics of satan's
[7:04] spirit
[7:06] and of course the opposite of satan
[7:08] is jesus the tree of life eternal life
[7:11] the forbidden fruit that he part took of
[7:13] in genesis 3 verse 6 was an act of
[7:16] sexual adultery with the serpent
[7:18] not a literal apple as some erroneously
[7:21] believe
[7:23] proverbs 30 verse 20 and song of psalm 4
[7:26] verses 12 through chapter 5 verse 1
[7:29] clearly teach that eating can be
[7:31] symbolic of sexual relations
[7:34] proverbs 30 verse 20
[7:36] such is the way of an adulterous woman
[7:38] she eateth and wipeth her mouth and
[7:40] saith i have done no wickedness
[7:43] song of solomon 5 verse 1 i am coming to
[7:46] my garden my sister my spouse i have
[7:48] gathered my myrrh with my spice i have
[7:50] eaten my honeycomb with my honey i have
[7:53] drunk my wine with my milk eat oh
[7:55] friends drink yay drink abundantly o
[7:58] beloved
[8:00] there are other verses as well that show
[8:02] the eating of fruit was symbolic of
[8:04] sexual intercourse
[8:06] such as second corinthians 11 verses 2
[8:09] and 3 and romans chapter seven verses
[8:11] one through five
[8:13] a fruit is the end result of a seed and
[8:16] the serpent's lie to eve that she would
[8:19] not surely die if she partook of the
[8:21] fruit was a spiritual seed or thought
[8:24] that was planted in her mind that lie or
[8:27] seed that was planted in her mind
[8:29] eventually came into fruition and
[8:31] produced the fruit of an adulterous act
[8:34] with the serpent which god recognized by
[8:36] stating that the serpent's seed would
[8:38] have hatred against the woman's seed
[8:40] so eve partook of this fruit with the
[8:42] serpent the fruit of adultery
[8:44] and then
[8:46] shared this fruit with adam
[8:48] who also partook of the fruit
[8:50] i had a good question on an email saying
[8:52] what fruit did adam partake of
[8:54] and the answer is unlawful sexual
[8:56] relations
[8:57] adam was rebelling against the word of
[8:59] god that was already written in heaven
[9:01] in relation to marriage and divorce
[9:04] we know psalm 119 verse 89 says forever
[9:08] o lord thy word is settled in heaven
[9:11] so god had a law for marriage already
[9:13] written in heaven
[9:15] and we're not sure whether adam knew it
[9:16] or not
[9:17] but adam broke that law
[9:19] and that law is actually recorded in
[9:21] deuteronomy 22
[9:22] verses 22 and 23
[9:25] if a damsel that is a virgin be
[9:27] betrothed unto a husband and a man find
[9:30] her in the city and lie with her then ye
[9:32] shall bring them both out unto the gate
[9:35] of that city and he shall stone them
[9:37] with stones that they die
[9:39] the damsel because she cried out being
[9:41] in the city and the man because he hath
[9:43] humbled his neighbor's wife
[9:45] so thou shalt put away evil from among
[9:48] you
[9:49] so here's the scripture that shows
[9:51] adam's rebellion against the word of god
[9:54] so according to god's word adam was not
[9:56] to take eve back because she'd already
[9:58] had sexual relations with the serpent
[10:01] so again the fruit adam partooka with e
[10:03] was unlawful sexual relations
[10:06] and friends brother and taught us in the
[10:08] church age book in chapter three
[10:10] let's listen to the quote
[10:12] now i know when answering one question
[10:14] another one is apt to come up and people
[10:16] ask me if eve fell that way what did
[10:19] adam do for god lays the blame on adam
[10:23] that is simple
[10:24] the word of god is forever settled in
[10:26] heaven
[10:27] before one speck of stardust was made
[10:30] that word god's law was there exactly as
[10:34] it is written in our bible
[10:36] now the word teaches us that if a woman
[10:38] leaves her husband and goes with another
[10:40] man she is an adulteress and is no
[10:42] longer married and the husband is not to
[10:44] take her back
[10:45] that word was true in eden as it was
[10:48] true when moses wrote it in the law
[10:50] the word can't change
[10:52] adam took her back
[10:54] he knew exactly what he was doing but he
[10:56] did it anyway
[10:58] she was a part of him and he was willing
[11:00] to take her responsibility upon himself
[11:03] he would not let her go
[11:05] so eve conceived by him he knew she
[11:08] would he knew exactly what would happen
[11:10] to the human race and he sold the human
[11:12] race into sin that he might have eve for
[11:15] he loved her
[11:18] so friends now you see that eve should
[11:20] have died for her adulterous act
[11:22] but adam loved her so much and knew that
[11:24] she was a part of him so he took her
[11:27] back yet it was a rebellion to the word
[11:29] of god
[11:30] but god was gracious and merciful and
[11:32] allowed this to be a type of christ in
[11:34] the church
[11:35] because any human in eve situation or
[11:38] adam's situation would have done the
[11:39] same
[11:40] all humans would have fallen short of
[11:42] the glory of god and sinned
[11:44] and god wanted to express his attribute
[11:46] as a redeemer of the fallen sinful
[11:48] humanity
[11:50] so just as adam saw his wife defiled yet
[11:53] could not put her away
[11:55] so christ knows the church would be
[11:56] defiled but still took her back because
[11:58] she was a part of him
[12:00] as the bible says we were chosen in
[12:02] christ before the foundation of the
[12:03] world we were in the mind and the plan
[12:05] of almighty god
[12:07] notice adam willingly sinned with eve so
[12:11] redemption story is seen in eve's life
[12:14] first in adam willingly sinning
[12:16] adam knew he would die
[12:18] if he took of the forbidden fruit but he
[12:20] loved eve too much to live without her
[12:23] she was a part of him so he took her sin
[12:26] upon himself trusting god's mercy to
[12:28] redeem them
[12:30] eve was deceived in her sin but adam
[12:32] wasn't
[12:33] according to first timothy chapter 2
[12:35] this is allegorical of christ willingly
[12:38] taking all sin upon himself
[12:40] and dying on the cross for our
[12:42] redemption
[12:43] remember jesus is called the last adam
[12:45] in first corinthians 15 verse 45 because
[12:49] he is the true faithful adam where adam
[12:52] failed jesus conquered so if jesus is
[12:55] the last adam then the bride church the
[12:58] holy ghost-filled church must be the
[13:00] last eve the obedient one desiring only
[13:03] her husband and she will not be deceived
[13:07] in closing i hope this video has been a
[13:09] blessing friends as i said recently i've
[13:12] received numerous emails asking
[13:13] questions about the serpency teaching
[13:15] so i thought i'd make a video to help
[13:17] people with these specific questions
[13:20] also those two publications are
[13:22] important and i didn't know how many
[13:24] people had seen them so i wanted to
[13:25] share them as well
[13:27] friends god's word is true and his
[13:29] revelation is correct
[13:31] the serpents see doctrine doesn't save
[13:33] but it does shine more light on the
[13:35] gospel truth we're all trying to see
[13:39] and the seed of the serpent
[13:42] that's the killer
[13:45] many people don't believe that but if
[13:46] you'll just read in genesis the bible
[13:48] said that the serpent had a seed
[13:51] and i'll put enmity between the serpent
[13:53] seed and the woman's seed
[13:55] so the serpent had a
[13:58] seed
[13:59] and the serpent seed was spiritual thing
[14:01] jesus was not a man
[14:03] so the woman's seed was spiritual they
[14:05] both had seeds and the enmity is still
[14:08] there
[14:09] a serpent had a seed and if you just
[14:11] take your bible and get out and be a
[14:13] real reverend before
[14:14] god i believe god will reveal it to you
[14:17] and if you do not understand it i'm i'm
[14:20] available any time to do my very best to
[14:22] help you by a letter or by
[14:25] or by personal interview or anything
[14:27] that i could do to help you of course we
[14:29] realize that that doesn't save a man
[14:32] neither does it condemn a man
[14:34] but it only brings light upon the
[14:36] subject that we're all trying so hard to
[14:38] get the people to see
[14:40] it only brings life
[14:44] if you have any questions concerns or
[14:46] testimonies about this video please
[14:48] contact me
[14:51] god bless you and may jesus christ be
[14:53] the desire of your heart
