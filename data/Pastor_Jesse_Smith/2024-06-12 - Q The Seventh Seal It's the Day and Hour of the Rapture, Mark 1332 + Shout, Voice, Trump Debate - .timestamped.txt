[0:02] the Seven's always a mystery watch that
[0:05] seven that's the finish that was the
[0:06] coming of the Lord heaven was quite
[0:09] silent nobody moved because Jesus said
[0:11] himself not even an angel of heaven
[0:13] knows when I will return I don't even
[0:15] know it myself what time the father has
[0:17] put that in his mind God Alone knows it
[0:21] greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:23] of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of
[0:25] this video is to answer a viewer's
[0:27] question about the seventh seal I was
[0:29] read recently asked what I believed
[0:31] about the seventh seal so in this video
[0:33] I'd like to make the answer to that by
[0:35] the grace of God hi friends I'm Jesse
[0:37] Smith pastor of bride of Christ
[0:38] Fellowship here for the past 18 years
[0:41] and I defend the original Gospel of the
[0:43] Lord Jesus Christ that he revealed to St
[0:45] Paul and then restored according to the
[0:47] scriptures through his Prophet The Late
[0:50] William Mariam brandham 1909 to
[0:53] 1965 and also defend brother Ram's Godly
[0:56] Christian character so here's the
[0:58] outline for this video first look at the
[1:00] Bible teaching on the seventh seal
[1:02] second we'll look at the three forms of
[1:04] each seal third we'll look at 11 quotes
[1:07] on the day and hour of Jesus's return
[1:11] relating to the seventh seal fourth will
[1:14] debunk the he's here
[1:17] misunderstanding and fifth we'll look at
[1:18] the Rapture processed debate of course
[1:21] it's a debate done with brotherly
[1:23] kindness and respect so let's begin with
[1:27] the Bible teaching on the seventh seal
[1:30] seventh seal is mentioned in Revelation
[1:32] 8: 1 and 2 the Bible says and when he
[1:35] had opened the seventh seal there was
[1:36] silence in heaven about the space of
[1:38] half an hour and I saw the seven angels
[1:40] which stood before God and to them were
[1:42] given seven trumpets so the first thing
[1:45] we notice is that there's silence in
[1:47] heaven about the space of half hour when
[1:49] the seventh seal is open I believe
[1:51] according to the Bible the only reason
[1:53] there would be silence in heaven is
[1:54] because Jesus left heaven in order to go
[1:57] down to Rapture the Bride of Jesus
[1:59] Christ to meet the Saints in the air to
[2:01] fulfill 1 Thessalonians
[2:04] 4:16 and 17 this is also according to
[2:07] Revelation 4:8 Revelation 4:8 says the
[2:11] beasts rest not day and night saying
[2:14] holy holy holy Lord God Almighty which
[2:16] was and is and is to come so these
[2:19] beasts are doing ceaseless praise
[2:22] unending praise to Jesus Christ but then
[2:26] when the Seven Seals open Heaven is
[2:28] silent so why would these beasts be
[2:30] silent it would have to be because Jesus
[2:33] left heaven in order to Rapture the
[2:35] Bride of Jesus Christ and of course
[2:38] brother Ram taught this in at least one
[2:40] place he said it in the sardian church
[2:42] age December 9th
[2:44] 1960 he says the heavens was empty for
[2:47] the space of half an hour where is this
[2:49] big fellow God then uh-huh see he's in
[2:52] Christ sure let's listen to the quote
[2:55] and Jesus comes from heaven with 10,000s
[2:57] times 10 thousands of his Saints and the
[3:00] Bible says that the heavens was empty
[3:02] for the space of a half hour where is
[3:04] this big fellow God then see he's in
[3:09] Christ now getting back to 1
[3:11] Thessalonians
[3:12] 4:16-17 for the Lord himself shall
[3:15] descend from heaven with a shout and
[3:16] with the voice of the Archangel and with
[3:18] the Trump of God and the dead in Christ
[3:20] shall rise first then we which are alive
[3:22] and remain shall be caught up together
[3:24] with them in the clouds to meet the Lord
[3:25] in the air and so shall we ever be with
[3:28] the Lord so this is what I believe the
[3:30] seventh seal is the seventh seal begins
[3:32] with Jesus Christ descending from heaven
[3:36] and meeting the Saints in the air
[3:38] brother brand also said the seventh seal
[3:40] is seen in many types in the Bible of
[3:43] course the first type would be Enoch he
[3:45] was the seventh from Adam and he was not
[3:48] for God took him in other words Enoch
[3:50] was the first person raptured that's
[3:52] according to Genesis 524 and Jude
[3:56] 1:14 so we see the seventh seal
[3:59] foreshadow in the Old Testament through
[4:01] Enoch's Rapture the seventh from Adam we
[4:05] also see it in Joshua 6 the entire
[4:07] chapter Jericho fell on the seventh lap
[4:10] around when Israel was marching around
[4:13] Jericho and of course when it fell they
[4:15] had to shout and there was seven
[4:17] trumpets blowing so we see a shout and a
[4:20] trumpet which is a fulfillment of the
[4:23] shout voice and Trump from 1
[4:25] Thessalonians 4:17 so I've always been
[4:28] on the lookout for The Voice in Joshua
[4:30] chapter 6 but we definitely have a shout
[4:32] and Trump when Jericho fell so in other
[4:35] words we see a type of the Rapture in
[4:37] Joshua chapter 6 Rahab and her house
[4:40] were spared because of the token or the
[4:42] baptism of the Holy Ghost all else died
[4:45] and that's a type of the seven-year
[4:47] Great Tribulation period where first all
[4:50] those that don't take the mark are
[4:51] killed that would include foolish
[4:53] virgins and then when Jesus comes back
[4:56] riding the White Horse at the battle of
[4:58] Armageddon nearly everyone is killed and
[5:00] of course the reason I believe that is
[5:02] because the Bible says that some people
[5:04] will make it through the battle of
[5:05] Armageddon and live into the Millennium
[5:08] and that's found in Zechariah 14:16 and
[5:10] it should come to pass that everyone
[5:12] that is left of all the nations which
[5:14] came against Jerusalem shall even go up
[5:18] from year to year to worship the king
[5:20] the Lord of hosts and to keep the Feast
[5:22] of
[5:23] Tabernacles so we see the first Bible
[5:25] meaning of the seven seal is it's the
[5:27] Rapture it's the day and hour
[5:30] when Jesus returns to Rapture the Bride
[5:32] of Jesus Christ before the Great
[5:34] Tribulation period the second meaning is
[5:36] that the seventh seal is a time period
[5:39] it's the beginning of the end of time
[5:42] the seventh seal and the Rapture it sets
[5:44] in motion the end as brother Ram said
[5:47] the seven seal is the end of the church
[5:48] ages it's the end of the vials it's the
[5:50] end of the trumpets it's the end of time
[5:52] it's the end of the struggling world so
[5:54] the seventh seal is also a time period
[5:56] beginning with the Rapture all the way
[5:59] until the future home because when the
[6:01] future home starts the new Jerusalem
[6:03] time shall be no more and friends this
[6:06] is true because the seventh seal is the
[6:08] last seal on the book of redemption so
[6:11] during the time period of the seventh
[6:12] seal we have the Redemption of the Bride
[6:14] she's raptured we have the Redemption of
[6:16] Israel the 144,000 are sealed with the
[6:19] Holy Ghost during the tribulation period
[6:21] we have the redeemed Saints reigning
[6:23] during the 1,000-year millennial Reign
[6:26] we have Satan's destruction at the
[6:27] Battle of gagam Magog and then we have
[6:30] the white Throne judgment where the
[6:32] Saints sit with Jesus in The Throne of
[6:34] judgment and judgment is given to the
[6:36] Saints don't you know that the Saints
[6:38] shall judge the Earth don't you know
[6:40] that the Saints shall judge angels and
[6:42] then of course the end of all time is
[6:44] the New Jerusalem the future home let's
[6:46] play the quote from the seventh seal
[6:47] where brother brandom says the seventh
[6:49] seal is the end of all time we must
[6:52] remember that this seventh seal is the
[6:56] end of time of all things
[7:01] fine the things written in the seven
[7:04] seal book sealed up of the Plan of
[7:09] Redemption from before the foundational
[7:11] World it every bit
[7:13] ends it is the end it is the end of the
[7:18] struggling world it's end of struggling
[7:20] nature it's the end of everything in
[7:23] there is the end of the trumpets it's
[7:25] the end of the vials it's the end of the
[7:27] Earth it's it's even the end of
[7:30] time time runs
[7:32] out the Bible said so everything runs
[7:36] out and this time the end of the the at
[7:40] the end of this seventh seal notice it's
[7:43] the end of the church age it's the the
[7:46] end of the seven seal it's the end of
[7:49] the trumpets it's the end of the vials
[7:52] and even in the ushering in of the
[7:56] Millennium that's on the seventh seal
[8:00] now let's move on to the second section
[8:02] three forms to each seal friends
[8:04] remember during the first seal sermon
[8:06] brother brandom says there's three forms
[8:08] to every seal he said the first seal
[8:11] opened in symbol form what about when
[8:13] it's open in reality form he said first
[8:16] it's with God next it's in a symbol then
[8:18] it's revealed three things let's listen
[8:21] to the quote and notice the first seal
[8:25] opened
[8:30] the first seal when it was open in the
[8:34] symbol form it
[8:37] thundered and what about when it's open
[8:40] in its reality
[8:47] form it thundered as soon as the lamb
[8:50] struck back the seal and what did it
[8:52] reveal not all of itself first it's with
[8:56] God next it's an assemble then it's
[8:59] revealed seal three
[9:01] things now here's a chart I made a
[9:03] simple chart every seal has a symbol
[9:06] form a reality form and a revelation
[9:08] form so I'm not going to go through all
[9:11] these seals but you can pause the video
[9:13] if you want to look at each one but we
[9:14] see that each of the seals had a symbol
[9:17] reality and Revelation form now the
[9:19] seventh seal the symbol form was given
[9:21] around 8090 and there's no symbol the
[9:24] only clue we're given is silence in
[9:26] heaven which I already addressed the
[9:28] only reason there would be SS in heaven
[9:29] as if Jesus left and then the four
[9:31] beasts did not have to worship him
[9:33] anymore the reality form of the seventh
[9:35] seal is the day an hour of the Rapture
[9:39] it's an unknown day or hour this is
[9:41] according to Mark 13:32 and brother
[9:43] Brandon will use this scripture later on
[9:45] as we'll go through that in the seventh
[9:46] seal sermon Jesus said but of that day
[9:49] and that hour knoweth no man no not the
[9:52] Angels which are in heaven neither the
[9:53] son but the father so even Jesus's human
[9:57] glorified body does not know know the
[9:59] day and hour of the Rapture only the
[10:01] father knows it and then the Revelation
[10:04] form of the seventh seal was preached on
[10:06] March 24th 1963 by God's Prophet brother
[10:09] brandham and the revelation of the seven
[10:11] seal was Mark 13:32 brother Bram tells
[10:15] us is the day and hour of the
[10:17] Rapture but the reality form has not
[10:20] happened yet the Rapture has not
[10:21] happened so friends this is the reason
[10:23] there's so much confusion on the seventh
[10:25] seal people don't really understand how
[10:28] each seal has has three forms If people
[10:31] could understand that quote then it
[10:32] would make a lot more sense for them
[10:33] there wouldn't be so much confusion so
[10:36] here's a separate slide on the seventh
[10:38] seal there's no symbol we're just told
[10:40] there's silence in heaven we know what
[10:42] that means Jesus left Heaven the reality
[10:45] form of the seventh seal hasn't opened
[10:47] yet brother Bram tells us it's the day
[10:48] and hour the unknown day and hour the
[10:51] Rapture and the Revelation brother Ram
[10:53] told us quote revealed to us it was
[10:56] revealed to us the Revelation is Jesus's
[10:59] Rapture coming for the Gentile bride and
[11:02] of course that was preached on March
[11:03] 24th
[11:07] 1963 moving on to section number three
[11:09] let's look at 11 quotes on the day and
[11:11] hour Matthew 13:24 and how it relates to
[11:15] the seventh
[11:17] seal now I'm going to go through these
[11:18] quotes in chronological order except for
[11:21] the seventh seal quotes from March of 63
[11:23] I'll read those last broken sisters 1964
[11:27] brother random said and that last
[11:29] trumpet like the last seal will be the
[11:31] coming of the Lord and brother R cites 1
[11:34] Thessalonians 4:16 And1 17 the Rapture
[11:37] Scriptures it shall sound and the dead
[11:39] in Christ shall rise first just resting
[11:41] till that time let's listen to the
[11:44] quote remember that they which are alive
[11:47] and remain shall not hinder those which
[11:49] are sleeping for the Trump of God that
[11:52] last trumpet the sixth one has just
[11:54] sounded and that last trumpet like the
[11:57] last seal will be the coming of the Lord
[12:00] it shall sound in the dead and Christ
[12:03] shall rise first just resting till that
[12:07] time the second quote is the Feast of
[12:09] trumpets 64 brother ramam said because
[12:12] the seventh seal there was silence no
[12:14] one knew that was the minute or hour
[12:16] that Christ would come as he revealed it
[12:18] to us so a year and 4 months after
[12:21] brother R preached the seventh seal
[12:23] brother Ram told us the seventh seal
[12:25] mark
[12:26] 13:32 and it was revealed to us let's
[12:29] near the
[12:30] quote because the seventh seal there was
[12:32] silence no one knew that's a minute or
[12:34] hour that Christ would come as he
[12:36] revealed it to
[12:38] us the third quote is again from the
[12:40] Feast of trumpets brother ramam said the
[12:41] seventh seal hasn't opened yet you know
[12:44] that's his coming let's listen to the
[12:46] quote the seventh seal hasn't opened yet
[12:49] you know that's his
[12:52] coming the fourth quote is again from
[12:54] the Feast of trumpets brother Bram said
[12:56] as the church the bride is draw together
[12:58] she's Tak up speaking of the Rapture
[13:01] that mystery of the seventh seal the
[13:02] mystery of going let's listen to the
[13:05] quote at the same time now as soon as
[13:08] this church the bride is draw together
[13:11] she's taken up in that mystery of the
[13:13] seven
[13:14] seal or the seven seal the mystery going
[13:17] and the Jews is called by The Mystery of
[13:19] the seventh trumpet which is two
[13:21] prophets Elijah and
[13:24] Moses the fifth quote is from Souls that
[13:26] are in prison now brother Ram said the
[13:28] seven is always the mystery watch that
[13:30] seventh that's the finish that was the
[13:32] coming of the Lord Brother brand cites
[13:35] Mark
[13:36] 13:32 God Alone knows it the spirit then
[13:39] brother brandom cites a seal was open
[13:42] then there was silence in heaven so he
[13:44] cites Revelation 81 see it wasn't give
[13:47] away what would take place let's listen
[13:49] to the
[13:50] quote the Seven's always a
[13:53] mystery what that seven that's the
[13:55] finish that was the coming of the Lord
[13:58] heaven was quite silent nobody moved
[14:00] because Jesus said himself not even an
[14:03] angel of heaven knows when I will return
[14:05] I don't even know it myself what time
[14:07] the father has put that in his mind God
[14:09] Alone knows it the spirit that I didn't
[14:12] know
[14:13] it and it wasn't reveal when that
[14:15] seventh trumpet sounded or the seventh
[14:17] angel um seal was open then there was
[14:20] silence in the
[14:22] heaven see it wasn't give away what
[14:25] would take place sixth from Souls that
[14:27] are in prison now brother Rand said he
[14:30] hid the seventh seal from us and said
[14:32] there is silence in heaven no one knew
[14:34] it it was the coming of the Lord so
[14:36] again Mark 13:32 let's listen to the
[14:40] quote remember he hid the seven seal
[14:43] from us he wouldn't do it when the angel
[14:46] stood day by day telling it but then he
[14:47] wouldn't do it on that so there's
[14:49] silence in heaven no one knew it was the
[14:52] coming of the
[14:53] [Music]
[14:55] Lord the eighth quote is from Christ is
[14:58] the mystery of God revealed red brother
[15:00] BR said nobody know nothing about it
[15:01] even the angels didn't understand it see
[15:04] he didn't reveal it that's the reason
[15:06] under our seventh mystery when the
[15:07] seventh seal was opened there was
[15:09] silence Jesus when he was on Earth they
[15:12] wanted to know when he would come he
[15:13] said it's not even the son himself don't
[15:15] know when it's going to happen see God
[15:17] has this all to himself so again brother
[15:19] R cites Mark
[15:21] 13:32 let's listen to the quote God's
[15:24] great
[15:25] mystery of how it's a secret he kept it
[15:28] a secret nobody know nothing about even
[15:30] the angels didn't understand it he he
[15:32] didn't reveal it that's the reason under
[15:35] our seventh um uh mystery when the
[15:39] seventh seal was open there was
[15:41] silence Jesus when he was on Earth they
[15:45] want to know when he would come he said
[15:47] it's not even the son himself don't know
[15:49] when it's going to happen see God has
[15:51] this all to himself the ninth quote is
[15:54] again from Christ The Mystery of God
[15:55] revealed brother Ram said see the coming
[15:58] of the Lord that's one thing hasn't
[15:59] revealed yet of how he will come and
[16:01] when he will come it's a good thing he
[16:03] doesn't let's listen to the quote God's
[16:06] great
[16:07] mystery of how it's a secret he kept it
[16:10] a secret nobody know nothing about it
[16:12] even the angels didn't understand it he
[16:14] he didn't reveal it that's the reason
[16:17] there was silence in heaven for a space
[16:19] for half hour and seven Thunders utter
[16:21] their voices and John was even forbidden
[16:23] to write it see the coming of the Lord
[16:26] that's one thing he hasn't revealed yet
[16:29] of how he will come and when he will
[16:30] come it's a good thing that he
[16:32] doesn't no he has showed or revealed it
[16:38] in every type that's in the Bible
[16:41] therefore the entire Bible is the
[16:44] revelation of God's mystery in Christ
[16:48] the 10th quote is again from Christ The
[16:50] Mystery of God revealed brother Ram said
[16:52] now the coming of the Lord is in mystery
[16:54] we don't know when he's coming how he's
[16:56] coming but we know he's coming he never
[16:59] gave his mystery in full so we see
[17:02] brother Ram plainly says there are some
[17:04] things about the seventh seal that are
[17:06] revealed but he never gave the mystery
[17:08] in full in other words all three forms
[17:10] of the seventh seal were not revealed to
[17:12] us but the Revelation was the revelation
[17:14] of the seventh seal is the unknown day
[17:17] and hour of Jesus Rapture according to
[17:20] Mark
[17:21] 13:32 let's listen to the quote now the
[17:24] coming of the Lord is in mystery we
[17:27] don't know when he's coming how he's
[17:28] coming but we know he's coming amen see
[17:31] and so was all the mysteries of God
[17:33] waiting for this last
[17:35] day after is already been completed then
[17:38] he reveals and shows what he's
[17:39] done oh my never gave his mystery and
[17:43] full now the 11th and final quotes from
[17:45] the seventh seal brother Ram tells us
[17:48] none of us know the seventh seal but I'm
[17:50] going to tell you my revelation of it
[17:53] and then he proceeds to tell them about
[17:55] the seven Thunders he said Jesus never
[17:58] spoke of it John Couldn't Write it
[17:59] Angels know nothing about it what is it
[18:02] it's the thing that Jesus said even the
[18:04] angels of heaven didn't know nothing
[18:05] about it he didn't know it himself said
[18:09] only God would know it but he told us
[18:11] when we begin to see these things coming
[18:12] up so brother brandom again cites Mark
[18:16] 13:32 as the revelation of the seventh
[18:19] seal let's listen to the
[18:20] quote what what is
[18:24] it
[18:26] now none of us know
[18:30] but
[18:33] I'm I'm going to tell you my my
[18:36] revelation of it seven Thunders utter
[18:41] straight
[18:43] together like a spelling out
[18:45] something notice at that
[18:48] time John's started writing he said
[18:51] don't write
[18:53] it Jesus never spoke of
[18:56] it John Couldn't Write
[19:00] Angels know nothing about it amen what
[19:03] is it it's the thing that Jesus said
[19:07] even the angels of heaven didn't know
[19:09] nothing about it
[19:12] see he didn't know it himself amen said
[19:16] only God would know it amen but he told
[19:19] us when we begin to see these signs
[19:21] coming up now you getting somewhere all
[19:25] right notice so friends I believe it's
[19:28] beyond a shadow of a doubt the seventh
[19:29] seal is a time period And it begins with
[19:34] the Rapture of the Gentile bride of
[19:36] Jesus Christ the unknown day and hour of
[19:38] the Rapture before the tribulation
[19:40] period we have the Bible verses on it we
[19:43] have the types and shadows of it and we
[19:45] have at least 11 quotes from God's
[19:47] Prophet brother brandham on this
[19:50] topic fourth let's debunk the he's here
[19:54] misunderstanding so recently I've become
[19:56] aware of some preachers and churches
[19:58] that
[19:59] say when the seventh seal was preached
[20:02] back in
[20:03] 1963 March of
[20:05] 1963 these churches now believe that
[20:07] Jesus is here or the Rapture has already
[20:10] started and so some preachers and their
[20:12] congregants will say things like I heard
[20:14] a preacher say he said Jesus is not in
[20:17] heaven he's on Earth he's on the throne
[20:20] of your heart and friends this is
[20:22] ridiculous to say that Jesus is not in
[20:24] heaven goes against the Scripture it
[20:27] goes against brother Ram's quote and
[20:29] that's what I want to share in this
[20:30] section so friends it's likely the
[20:32] preachers and their
[20:33] congregations misunderstand brother
[20:36] Ram's quotes Heaven is not bankrupt of
[20:38] Jesus the body of Jesus still sits at
[20:41] the right hand of the Majesty on high as
[20:43] the Bible tells us and also another
[20:46] attribute about these preachers and
[20:48] their churches is they're the ones that
[20:49] are saying just believe every word on
[20:51] the tape there's no mistakes in the
[20:53] message this proves they're weak
[20:55] immature Christians they're babies in
[20:57] the word of God they're not mature in
[20:59] the word of God brother Bram never said
[21:02] there's no mistakes on any of his tapes
[21:04] brother brandom never said just believe
[21:05] every word I say is thus sayith the Lord
[21:08] so these are the churches that have
[21:09] preachers but they have this
[21:12] misunderstanding about the tapes they're
[21:14] actually starting to worship the tapes
[21:15] of brother brandham not as boldly as
[21:18] brandham Tabernacle and all the tape
[21:20] church people but they're leaning more
[21:22] towards idolatry of brother brandham so
[21:25] when we look at Revelation 10 Jesus is
[21:28] coming down to earth as brother Ram said
[21:30] this is history the coming of the mighty
[21:32] Angel did not bankrupt Heaven brother
[21:35] ramam said the Holy Spirit visited him
[21:37] every day while he preached the Seven
[21:39] Seals he said the pillar of fire would
[21:41] be there he said the angel of the Lord
[21:42] would meet him so yes it was a
[21:44] visitation of Christ to give brother
[21:46] brandham the revelation of the Seven
[21:48] Seals and then brother brandham preach
[21:49] it to the people but again Revelation 10
[21:52] did not bankrupt heaven heaven still has
[21:55] the body of Jesus Christ and I'm going
[21:57] to prove this by the quot quotes of
[21:59] course soon in just a moment but
[22:01] remember Jesus said the Holy Spirit
[22:02] would be with us forever John
[22:05] 14:16 I will pray the father and he
[22:08] shall give you another comforter that he
[22:10] may abide with you forever so the same
[22:12] Holy Ghost has been here amongst the
[22:14] Bride of Jesus Christ and of course the
[22:16] foolish virgin for the last 2,000 years
[22:19] the Holy Ghost has been abiding with
[22:21] Believers forever of these last 2,000
[22:23] years but then yes there was a special
[22:26] appearing of the Lord Jesus Jesus Christ
[22:29] to brother brandham in order to break
[22:30] the Seven Seals but that did not
[22:32] bankrupt heaven so people should not say
[22:35] things like he's already here we're not
[22:37] looking for Jesus to come that's
[22:39] completely contrary to what brother
[22:41] bandom taught even after he preached the
[22:43] Seven Seals so let's look at these
[22:45] quotes here there's six quotes I'm going
[22:47] to share of course there's a lot more
[22:48] but we'll start in June of 63 brother
[22:52] brandom said now by faith lay your hands
[22:54] upon your sacrifice Jesus who is sitting
[22:57] at the right hand of God this is 3
[22:59] months after the seals brother Ram said
[23:02] Jesus is now sitting at the right hand
[23:04] of God let's listen to the quote Now by
[23:07] faith lay your hands upon your sacrifice
[23:09] Jesus who is sitting at the right hand
[23:11] of God to make intercessions for you
[23:14] then in the next month July 1963 brother
[23:16] Ram said Jesus is a high priest right
[23:19] now sitting at the right hand of the
[23:21] Majesty of God so that's 4 months after
[23:24] he preached the Seven Seals brother BR
[23:26] said the body is in heaven right now
[23:28] it's at the right hand of the Majesty of
[23:30] god let's listen to the quote the Bible
[23:33] said he's a high priest right now a high
[23:36] priest sitting at the right hand of the
[23:38] Majesty of God to make intercessions
[23:39] Upon Our confession and then August of
[23:43] 1964 17 months after he preached the
[23:46] Seven Seals brother Ram said Christ is
[23:48] in heaven today brother Ram didn't say
[23:50] Christ is here he's not in heaven
[23:52] Heaven's bankrupt no brother Ram said
[23:54] Christ is in heaven today preparing the
[23:56] New Jerusalem let's listen to the quote
[23:59] now listen close don't move don't don't
[24:01] miss this Christ is in heaven today
[24:05] preparing the New Jerusalem then in July
[24:08] of
[24:09] 1965 28 months after preaching the Seven
[24:12] Seals in what is the attraction on the
[24:14] mountain brother Bram said we are
[24:16] waiting on the coming of the Lord as
[24:18] he's recording this tape and preaching
[24:20] to the people on the phone hookup seven
[24:22] times he says we're waiting for the
[24:24] coming of the Lord Brother Ram did not
[24:26] say he's here and we don't have to wait
[24:29] for his coming like some people say
[24:31] today some people just say he's here of
[24:33] course that's a false Doctrine let's
[24:35] listen to the quote we send greetings to
[24:37] those in Tucson that's gathered tonight
[24:40] waiting for the coming of the Lord down
[24:42] in Houston Texas to those who are
[24:44] waiting for the coming of the Lord up in
[24:46] Chicago to those who are waiting for the
[24:49] coming of the Lord up on the East Coast
[24:53] New York and Connecticut and the great
[24:57] groups up there that's w waiting for the
[24:59] coming of the lord we send greetings to
[25:01] brother Junior Jackson tonight and his
[25:03] group down in Clarksville brother rutle
[25:06] upon 62 and his group waiting for the
[25:09] coming of the Lord and we're gathered
[25:11] here tonight at the home Church the
[25:14] Tabernacle waiting for the coming of the
[25:17] Lord next in November
[25:19] 1965 about a month before brother R
[25:22] passed he said we're looking up for his
[25:25] coming he's coming one of these days
[25:29] he's coming again so notice again
[25:31] brother Ram did not say he's already
[25:32] here he said we're looking up for his
[25:34] coming this is in the invisible Union of
[25:36] the Bride of Jesus Christ let's listen
[25:38] to the quote we're looking upward
[25:40] watching the true bride Across the
[25:42] Nation this hour looking up Church he's
[25:45] coming one of these days just as sure as
[25:47] he come the first time he's coming
[25:50] again and then six and finally from the
[25:53] church age book which was released
[25:54] December 1965 brother Bram said Jesus
[25:59] now sits at the right hand of the great
[26:01] spirit of Jehovah so he said now this
[26:04] was released again in December 65 the
[26:08] same month brother R passed away now
[26:10] Jesus sits at the right hand of the
[26:12] spirit of Jehovah in heaven let's listen
[26:15] to the quote and notice when Jesus was
[26:17] taken off the cross he was exalted into
[26:19] heaven and now sits at the right hand of
[26:21] the great spirit of
[26:23] Jehovah Fifth and finally let's talk
[26:25] about the Rapture process debate of
[26:27] course this is a debate done in
[26:29] brotherly kindness so the debate on the
[26:31] Rapture process is basically has the
[26:34] shout already happened Paul told us
[26:37] there's three phases to the Rapture
[26:38] shout voice Trump now personally I've
[26:41] always believe the shout is brother br's
[26:43] message it's going out to the entire
[26:45] world and I've always believe the voice
[26:47] will be the voice of the Archangel
[26:49] likely Michael because Michael is
[26:51] associated with Resurrection such as
[26:54] Moses's Resurrection you can read about
[26:56] that in Jude 1:9
[26:58] and then of course the trumpet will be
[27:00] the body change that will be the unknown
[27:02] day and hour of the Rapture so the
[27:04] debate is basically has the Rapture
[27:07] process already started or is the
[27:09] rapture a process and I personally
[27:11] believe yes now I could be wrong on this
[27:13] I'm open to further Revelation again
[27:15] this is a topic that does not pertain to
[27:17] salvation Salvation is through the blood
[27:19] of Jesus Christ only by Grace we are
[27:22] saved through faith Ephesians 2:8-10 but
[27:25] also Romans 3:25 says we must have faith
[27:28] in the blood of Jesus Christ so when our
[27:31] faith is in the blood of our sacrifice
[27:33] we are saved we're Justified we're
[27:34] declared righteous as we wish to be as
[27:37] the Greek Lexicon says recently I got an
[27:40] email about this question that's why I
[27:41] thought I'd include it on this video and
[27:44] so for years I've wondered you know is
[27:45] the shout the message of brother
[27:47] brandham to go around the world and has
[27:49] it started the Rapture process again I
[27:51] personally believe yes and then I
[27:53] believe I found some scripture to back
[27:56] this up it's from Exodus 3: verse 8 God
[27:59] said and I am come down to deliver them
[28:01] out of the hand of the Egyptians and to
[28:03] bring them up out of the land unto a
[28:06] good land and a large unto a land
[28:09] flowing with milk and honey unto the
[28:11] place of the Canaanites and the Hittites
[28:13] and the amorites and the perizzites and
[28:15] the hivites and the jebusites so notice
[28:17] the wording here God said I am come down
[28:20] to deliver Israel now how did God do it
[28:22] he did it through Moses he did it
[28:24] through a prophet of God and so Israel's
[28:27] delivery out of bondage and to the
[28:29] promised land was a process it was over
[28:32] a 40-year process God came down in the
[28:35] ministry of Moses to give the people an
[28:37] exodus and place them into the land so
[28:40] could this mean that God came down in
[28:42] brother Ram's Ministry to give us an
[28:43] exodus out of denominations and prepare
[28:46] us for the Third Exodus the Rapture of
[28:49] the Bride of Jesus Christ so I
[28:51] personally believe that yes the Rapture
[28:53] process has started the shout was
[28:56] brother bram's ministry as brother Bram
[28:58] said in the Rapture sermon 1965 let's
[29:01] listen to that quote the first thing
[29:03] comes when he starts descending from the
[29:05] heaven there's a shout what is it is a
[29:08] message to get the people together a
[29:10] message comes forth first now L trimming
[29:13] time rise and trim your lamp what watch
[29:14] was that the seven amen not the six the
[29:18] seven behold the bridegroom cometh rise
[29:21] and trim your lamps and they did some of
[29:23] them found they didn't even have any or
[29:25] in their lamps see what's lamp triming
[29:27] time it's Malachi 4 time why you it's
[29:31] Luke 17 it's it's all those prophecy
[29:34] that's it can perfectly set in order for
[29:36] this day in the scripture we see it
[29:38] living right there brother random
[29:40] referenced Matthew 256 the Midnight Cry
[29:44] behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out
[29:46] to meet him so brother Braham connected
[29:47] these two verses a shout to start the
[29:50] Rapture process and then the cry made at
[29:53] midnight where both virgins rose up and
[29:56] trimmed their lamps but of course only
[29:57] one had the oil only one had the baptism
[30:00] of the Holy Ghost and in the Hebrew the
[30:02] words come down means to descend and so
[30:05] the Bible says the Lord himself shall
[30:07] descend from heaven with a shout so we
[30:09] have the same words there descend come
[30:11] down in Exodus 3:8 and then descend in 1
[30:14] Thessalonians 4:16 and again friends you
[30:17] know if I have my own opinions I'm open
[30:19] to the Lord revealing more Revelation on
[30:22] them I could be wrong but I'm just again
[30:24] answering a question from a dear Saint
[30:26] who wanted my opinion about the seventh
[30:28] seal and of course that relates to the
[30:29] Rapture as well in
[30:32] closing friends hope this video was a
[30:34] blessing by the grace of God I love
[30:36] getting these questions and it's a nice
[30:37] review for me to go back and look at the
[30:39] scriptures and quotes on the seventh
[30:41] seal regarding the seventh seal we don't
[30:43] have any thus sayi the Lord quotes on it
[30:45] other than the revelation of it brother
[30:47] Ram said in the seventh seal he said the
[30:49] history plus the church ages plus the
[30:51] Seals All Blends together and I can
[30:54] truly say it's thus sayith the Lord so
[30:55] the revelation of the seven seal is thus
[30:58] sayth the Lord but again there's an
[30:59] element we don't know we don't know the
[31:01] day and hour no man knows the day or the
[31:03] hour not even the sun knows the day or
[31:05] the hour nor the angels in
[31:07] heaven now the Vision Plus the word plus
[31:11] the history plus the church ages and all
[31:14] blend together so I could truly say that
[31:18] to the best of my understanding and
[31:21] according to the word of God and the
[31:23] vision and the Revelation the
[31:25] interpretation thereof is thus sayith
[31:28] the Lord so we're thankful for the
[31:31] Revelation that God has given to us and
[31:33] the main thing is we want our lamps
[31:35] trimmed and we want to make sure we have
[31:36] oil for the going out to meet the
[31:39] bridegroom the oil of the baptism of the
[31:41] Holy Ghost to be ready for the Rapture
[31:43] so if I get lots of comments on this
[31:45] there may be a part two we'll see by
[31:47] God's grace let's continue to make
[31:48] ourselves ready for the Rapture of the
[31:50] Bride of Jesus Christ if you have any
[31:53] questions concerns or testimonies about
[31:55] this video please contact me God bless
[31:58] you and may Jesus Christ be the desire
[32:00] of your heart
