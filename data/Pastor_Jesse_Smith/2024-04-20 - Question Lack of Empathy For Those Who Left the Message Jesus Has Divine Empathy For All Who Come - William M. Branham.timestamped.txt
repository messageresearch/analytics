[0:03] many has seared the conscience of people
[0:06] and has caused disappointments and
[0:08] everything but father I pray that you'll
[0:10] brast back every scar tonight heal every
[0:13] broken heart and may the power of God
[0:16] once more burn in a living faith through
[0:18] every heart granted Lord that Your Great
[0:20] Name might be glorified for we ask that
[0:23] in Jesus Christ's name
[0:26] [Music]
[0:27] amen greetings friends in the m ous name
[0:30] of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of
[0:33] this video is to answer a question I got
[0:35] from an email the question asked did I
[0:37] have a lack of empathy for people who
[0:40] have left the message and by God's grace
[0:42] I'm going to try to answer this as
[0:43] humbly and as kindly with as much
[0:46] brotherly kindness as it possibly can by
[0:48] the grace of God hi friends I'm Jesse
[0:50] Smith pastor of bride of Christ
[0:52] Fellowship here in akan Ohio USA and I
[0:55] defend the Bible revelations that Jesus
[0:57] Christ revealed to his genuine Prophet
[0:59] The Late William Ram 1909 to 1965 I also
[1:02] defend brother bram's true genuine Godly
[1:05] Christian character So my answer to this
[1:08] question is no I think I have a lot of
[1:11] empathy for people who have been hurt
[1:13] around message circles or message
[1:16] churches I feel that if it appears I
[1:19] don't have empathy it's because I'm
[1:21] focusing on doctrinal differences
[1:23] between people who have left the message
[1:26] and not really the real deep pain or
[1:29] abuse that some people have experienced
[1:31] in sinful message churches I thought
[1:34] it'd be good to start with the
[1:35] definition of empathy from Webster's
[1:38] Dictionary the action of understanding
[1:40] being aware of being sensitive to and
[1:42] vicariously experiencing the feelings
[1:44] thoughts and experience of another so to
[1:47] all of our viewers I want to let you
[1:49] know I am aware of and I understand the
[1:54] pain of your feelings and thoughts and
[1:56] experiences you've had if you've been
[1:58] hurt I'm so sorry are you been hurt in
[2:00] any way by any message church and again
[2:04] if a message church has sin in it and
[2:07] the message church is doing awful evil
[2:10] abusive wicked things then they should
[2:11] not be called a message church and they
[2:14] are not born again they do not have the
[2:16] baptism of the Holy Ghost and I'm very
[2:17] sorry you experienced those pains those
[2:20] abuses or any other hurtful experience
[2:25] the reason I can understand what you're
[2:27] going through is because I've had
[2:28] numerous people who are close to me
[2:30] friends others who've experienced abuse
[2:33] and have been through heartwrenching
[2:35] experiences and my heart has broken for
[2:37] them I've wept with them I've cried with
[2:40] them I've prayed with them so I assure
[2:42] all the viewers and all the people that
[2:44] have left the message that I have
[2:46] empathy on your pain and again in most
[2:48] of my videos I'm dealing with doctrinal
[2:51] issues Revelations that Jesus Christ
[2:53] revealed to brother brandham I'm
[2:55] defending brother brandom's bible-based
[2:57] Doctrine on his major doctrines and so
[2:59] so that's been the focus of my videos in
[3:01] the past that will probably be the focus
[3:03] of my videos to come in the future by
[3:05] God's grace cuz that's what God's called
[3:06] me to do I feel in my heart in humility
[3:09] I say that of course and I want to let
[3:11] the viewers know in all the message
[3:13] churches I've been in contact with I've
[3:14] only been treated with brotherly love
[3:17] and kindness and so all my experiences
[3:19] with message churches has been positive
[3:22] as far as I know by the grace of our
[3:23] Lord Jesus Christ and I'm sorry yours
[3:26] have not been as positive I'm sorry if
[3:29] they been awful hurtful abusive
[3:32] neglectful I'm very sorry about that and
[3:34] I'm sure all of our viewers feel the
[3:36] same way by the grace of God in a few of
[3:39] my videos I've encouraged wives who've
[3:41] been abused to contact authorities I've
[3:44] encouraged those who've been abused to
[3:46] use all the power of the law to bring
[3:48] the Predators to conviction as a
[3:50] Christian I never want to see people
[3:52] hurt or abused or neglected in any way
[3:54] but sometimes of course it happens God
[3:56] allows it but then we know God is there
[3:59] to offer his empathy his Divine empathy
[4:02] his Divine compassion the scripture says
[4:05] in Hebrews 4:15 Jesus can be touched
[4:08] with the feeling of our infirmities he
[4:10] was in all points tempted like as we are
[4:12] yet without sin Jesus is the great high
[4:15] priest who brings healing Jesus's
[4:17] wonderful words in Matthew 11 Comfort us
[4:19] show us his empathy come unto me all ye
[4:22] that labor and are heavy laden and I
[4:24] will give you rest take my yoke upon you
[4:26] learn of me for I meek and lowly in
[4:28] heart and you shall find rest un unto
[4:29] your souls for my yoke is easy and my
[4:32] burden is light so if you've been hurt
[4:34] friends please come to Jesus today by
[4:37] God's grace he will give you rest you
[4:40] can place your burdens on Christ you can
[4:43] cast your cares on him for he cares for
[4:46] you of course I know by experience with
[4:49] others that healing takes time remember
[4:52] Proverbs
[4:53] 18:14 a wounded Spirit who can bear with
[4:56] these deep pains in life they're
[4:58] extremely hard to bear that's why we got
[5:00] to constantly go to Jesus cast our cares
[5:02] on him for he cares for us the Bible
[5:05] says Jesus is so gentle Matthew 1220 a
[5:08] bruised Reed he shall not break a
[5:11] smoking flax he shall not quench so
[5:14] friends if you've been hurt Jesus will
[5:15] not hurt you more Jesus will heal you
[5:17] he'll be gentle with you he'll be
[5:19] merciful to you he won't put out your
[5:21] fire or your love for him he'll make
[5:24] that fire be restored he'll restore the
[5:27] joy of your salvation Hallelujah there's
[5:30] at least five verses that say Jesus was
[5:32] moved with compassion Matthew 9:36 he
[5:35] was moved with compassion on the
[5:37] multitudes because they fainted they
[5:39] were as sheep without having a Shepherd
[5:41] the Bible said in Matthew 14:14 he was
[5:43] moved with compassion to heal the sick
[5:46] in Jesus's parable about forgiveness
[5:49] Jesus said the lord of the servant was
[5:50] moved with compassion loosed him and
[5:52] forgave the debt this shows Jesus's
[5:54] compassion to forgive our sins then
[5:56] there's Mark 1:41 and Mark 6:34 for he
[6:00] was moved with compassion to heal then
[6:02] he was moved with compassion again on
[6:04] the multitudes and began to teach them
[6:05] many things so if you're hurting if
[6:07] you've been through awful situations
[6:09] Jesus will teach you he will heal you he
[6:12] will heal your broken Spirit the Bible
[6:15] even says God is very nigh to you if
[6:17] you've been hurt or broken Psalm 34:1
[6:20] 15-19 God's ears are open to your cry
[6:23] the face of the Lord is against all them
[6:25] that do evil the righteous cry and the
[6:27] Lord heareth and the Lord will deliver
[6:29] them out of all their troubles the Lord
[6:31] is nine to them that are of a broken
[6:33] heart and save as such as be of a
[6:35] contrite spirit many are the afflictions
[6:37] of the righteous but the Lord delivereth
[6:39] him out of them all praise the Lord
[6:41] Jesus Christ friends if you're hurting
[6:43] God is nigh unto you I think it's
[6:46] important to note as well that there's a
[6:48] time to weep there's a time to mourn and
[6:49] there's a time to be healed and a time
[6:51] to Rejoice we see this in Ecclesiastes
[6:53] 3:4 a time to weep and a time to laugh a
[6:56] time to mourn and a time to dance Romans
[6:59] 12:14 and 15 says bless them which
[7:02] persecute you bless and curse not
[7:04] rejoice with them that do rejoice and
[7:06] weep with them that weep so I'm taking
[7:08] this moment this video to mourn with
[7:10] those who've been hurt to weep with
[7:12] those who've wept and I mean that in all
[7:15] sincerity you know yesterday I just wept
[7:17] and rejoiced in the same day I had a
[7:20] 38-year-old friend who died from
[7:22] muscular distrophy and I wept with his
[7:24] father on the phone it was extremely
[7:26] heartbreaking I'm 43 and this young man
[7:28] is younger than me he's 38 and so I know
[7:31] what it's like to weep with those who
[7:32] weep but then the same day there's a
[7:35] couple that's never had children they've
[7:36] been the message many years they've been
[7:38] trying to have children for many years
[7:40] and on that same day I got a text from
[7:42] the husband saying they had their first
[7:45] child after all these years of pain and
[7:48] miscarriages and so I Rejoice with those
[7:50] who rejoice and I weep with those who
[7:52] weep so by God's grace I want to have a
[7:55] prayer for those who've been hurt in
[7:56] so-called message churches and I'm sorry
[7:59] you were hurt and I'm sorry those
[8:01] message churches did not represent
[8:02] Christ it seems like those false message
[8:05] churches they blasphemed Christ so I'm
[8:07] very sorry that they did not represent
[8:09] Jesus Christ the way they ought to have
[8:12] that's heartbreaking I'm very sorry for
[8:14] you also I want to have empathy for
[8:17] others you know in my 2021 book I did
[8:19] all this research on the Catholic church
[8:21] and I saw all the data about the
[8:25] thousands and thousands of people who've
[8:27] been hurt by Catholic priests and nuns
[8:29] and I even have a family member who as a
[8:32] child in the Catholic school was
[8:34] physically thrown up against the lockers
[8:36] slapped around pushed around thrown
[8:38] around by Catholic nuns so friends this
[8:41] is a subject that's dear to my heart
[8:44] I've just never dealt with this subject
[8:45] before but I want to make this video
[8:47] today by God's grace as I feel the
[8:49] leading of the Holy Ghost by the grace
[8:51] of God one more thing about empathy I
[8:53] want to share a testimony from a brother
[8:56] in the message his name is Mike MOSI his
[8:58] example of forgiving someone who sinned
[9:01] against him is one of the most powerful
[9:03] examples of forgiveness I've ever seen
[9:05] I'll put a link to Mike's testimony in
[9:07] the description precious brother Mike
[9:09] was shot by a cop and is paralyzed
[9:13] because of that he's still believing God
[9:14] for Divine Healing this man has great
[9:16] faith great confidence in the Lord Jesus
[9:19] Christ and on the testimony video if
[9:21] you'll watch it he goes into the
[9:22] courtroom and raises his King James
[9:24] Bible and says he wants to give the cop
[9:28] the forgiveness that he
[9:30] deserves so this is amazing forgiveness
[9:33] friends this is amazing empathy that the
[9:35] Lord Jesus Christ anointed brother Mike
[9:37] with and I've talked to brother Mike
[9:38] about this personally Mike said it it
[9:41] wasn't my ability to heal it was the
[9:43] ability and the Forgiveness of Jesus
[9:45] Christ expressed through him I've always
[9:48] shared this you know I believe brother
[9:50] Mike has way more faith than I have
[9:52] because of the difficult situations he's
[9:54] gone through and yet he still has trust
[9:56] and faith in Jesus Christ he's a
[9:58] follower of this message but he loves
[10:00] all people he prays for all people
[10:01] whether they're in the message or not a
[10:03] true example of a genuine Christian
[10:06] expressing God's Divine empathy so I
[10:08] hope this testimonial video can be a
[10:10] help to some people if you haven't seen
[10:11] it it's a true example of the empathy of
[10:14] the Lord Jesus Christ so let's pray for
[10:17] those who've been hurt in message
[10:18] churches and also those that have been
[10:19] hurt anywhere else whether in the home
[10:21] or whether in school or churches let's
[10:24] pray for them by God's
[10:27] grace father God you call yourself the
[10:30] great physician Lord and surely you are
[10:32] you're God of compassion God of Mercy I
[10:36] pray for those who've been hurt in false
[10:38] message
[10:39] churches pray your holy spirit will heal
[10:41] them Lord guide them into all truth Lord
[10:44] God may you renew their strength like
[10:46] the eagle Lord as the scripture says and
[10:49] I know you are nigh unto them may they
[10:50] recognize your presence God and may the
[10:53] great high priest heal their infirmities
[10:56] Lord because you can understand Lord
[10:58] Jesus you were abused more than any
[11:00] person could have ever been
[11:02] abused your Visage was marred Lord the
[11:04] scripture says in Isaiah
[11:06] 52 so I know you can have compassion I
[11:09] know you can relate to their their pain
[11:11] and suffering dear
[11:12] God so I ask in the name of Jesus Christ
[11:15] you'd help these people that were hurt
[11:16] and have left mess to churches may they
[11:19] find peace may they find forgiveness may
[11:21] they find a real Holy Ghost filled
[11:23] Church Lord by the grace of
[11:27] God may they find your PE peace may you
[11:30] be able to heal their Wounded Spirits to
[11:32] some degree Lord I know we always have
[11:34] scars Lord we always have scars of bad
[11:36] memories Lord God but you are the great
[11:38] physician Lord God and the scripture
[11:40] says you make All Things New in 2
[11:43] Corinthians chapter 5 so Lord Jesus may
[11:46] they find healing through the Holy
[11:48] Spirit I ask it Lord
[11:51] Jesus father be with those again that
[11:53] have been hurt Lord in schools or homes

[12:06] Jesus Lord just as I prayed yesterday

[12:16] ask for your mercy Lord God blessed are
[12:19] those who mourn for they should be
[12:22] comforted and Lord bless that family
[12:25] Lord that had their first child

[12:27] many years of Heartache many years of
[12:30] miscarriages Lord thank you for giving
[12:31] them a child so father be near to all
[12:34] those that need you today Lord God all

[12:38] Afflicted all the broken Lord God I
[12:41] believe you'll do it Lord as they reach
[12:43] out to you as they draw near to you may
[12:46] you draw near to them in Jesus Christ's
[12:48] name
[12:53] amen one other thing I thought I'd share
[12:55] also by God's grace is that I hope
[12:58] people that have left the message can
[13:00] also have empathy for brother brandom
[13:02] and I understand people that have been
[13:05] hurt in message churches will have hurt
[13:06] feelings toward brother brandom I
[13:08] totally understand that but I just pray
[13:10] for these people that have left the
[13:12] message in the right season because God
[13:14] works in Seasons we saw that in
[13:16] Ecclesiastes 3 in the right season After
[13:19] experiencing Jesus's healing they'll
[13:21] have empathy for brother brandom who is
[13:23] abused as a child he was raised in a
[13:25] racist family and Community but he
[13:28] overcame it by the the grace of our Lord
[13:30] Jesus Christ brother Ram was no doubt
[13:32] physically abused it seems like even by
[13:34] his parents he setting questions and
[13:37] answers part 464 that he thought he had
[13:39] the biggest temper out of anybody he
[13:42] said oh I had a mouth mashed all the
[13:44] time I taken a lot of my meals out of a
[13:46] straw brother Ram was speaking about his
[13:49] mother and said my mouth was mashed they
[13:52] just pick me up and knock me down and
[13:55] they knocked me down again till I just
[13:57] got too unable to get up anymore more
[13:59] that's always and then when I got able
[14:02] to get up I got up again they knocked me
[14:04] down again so that's just the way I had
[14:06] it let's listen to the
[14:09] quote sweeten your
[14:11] temper with
[14:14] prayer then make up your mind there I
[14:16] don't guess there there too many people
[14:18] in this building ever had any more
[14:20] temper than I did to begin with oh I I
[14:23] had a mouth mashed all the time and I I
[14:26] I taken a lot of my meals out of a straw
[14:30] my mother as you know was a half Indian
[14:33] and my father was an Irishman a Kentucky
[14:35] Irish at that and every one of both of
[14:38] them had enough temper to fight a buz
[14:39] saw and all the time my mouth was mashed
[14:43] I was little to begin with they just
[14:45] pick me up and knocked me down and I get
[14:47] up again then knocked me down again till
[14:48] I just got too able unable to get up
[14:50] anymore that's always and now when I got
[14:52] able to get up I got up again they
[14:53] knocked me down again so that's just way
[14:55] I had it and I thought I could never be
[14:57] a Christian but when the Holy Spirit
[14:59] came into my life that's done it so
[15:02] that's my prayer friends that those that
[15:04] have left the message can have empathy
[15:06] towards brother brandom and understand
[15:08] how he was raised and how he suffered
[15:09] abuse as well friends we all need the
[15:12] healing powers of the Lord Jesus Christ
[15:14] now and until the Lord comes by God's
[15:16] grace then the scripture says even after
[15:19] we're in heaven Jesus will still wipe
[15:21] away the tears from our eyes Revelation
[15:23] 21:4 says and God shall wipe away all
[15:26] tears from their eyes and there shall be
[15:27] no more death
[15:30] neither sorrow nor crying neither shall
[15:32] there be any more pain for the former
[15:34] things are passed away we have so much
[15:36] hope in the Gospel of Jesus Christ so
[15:38] please friends know that I'm praying for
[15:40] you I'll pray for everyone Again by
[15:41] God's grace if you have any questions
[15:44] concerns or testimonies about this video
[15:46] please contact
[15:47] me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[15:50] the desire of your heart
