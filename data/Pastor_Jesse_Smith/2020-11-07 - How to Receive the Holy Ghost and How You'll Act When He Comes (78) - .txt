TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] greetings friends in the matchless name of the lord jesus christ the purpose of this video is to teach how to receive the holy ghost and how you'll act when he comes upon your being our previous video series called true repentance and the three works of grace will be helpful to you as you seek the baptism of the holy ghost so please watch those if you haven't yet done so this video was a request from a viewer as we find many believers quickly get baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ called justification and move into sanctification and sort of get stuck there desiring the baptism of the holy ghost but not sure what to do so this video focuses on sanctification i'll begin with how to receive the holy ghost to move on from sanctification to receiving the baptism of the holy ghost remember this simple bible-based advice daily bible pray obey here's the bible reasoning behind this advice first the idea of daily if you want the holy ghost baptism you must daily connect to jesus christ don't get in a hurry or allow yourself to become frustrated patiently abide in christ or stay connected to christ as much as possible every day because you grow into the holy ghost baptism by daily loving and serving jesus as he teaches in mark chapter 4 verses 26-28 jesus's parable says the kingdom of god grows in three stages like a wheat plant and those three stages represent justification sanctification and the baptism of the holy ghost mark 4 28 says for the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself first the blade that's justification then the ear sanctification after that the full corn in the ear that's the baptism of the holy ghost and recall that jesus says the kingdom of god is within you or the baptism of the holy ghost christ in you the hope of glory according to colossians 1 27 but luke 17 21 is where jesus says for behold the kingdom of god is within you next moving on to bible the bible is the second word of advice because jesus says you are sanctified through the truth and the word or bible is truth according to john 17 17 sanctify them through thy truth thy word is truth jesus confirms sanctification comes by the word for jesus says we are sanctified by the truth and his word is truth so you must feed on the truth love the truth pray the truth and obey the truth this agrees with jesus labeling the three works of grace as the way justification the truth sanctification and the life the baptism of the holy ghost in john 14 6 jesus saith unto him i am the way the truth and the life the next word is pray prayer is the third word of advice from jesus who urges us to repeatedly ask for the holy ghost baptism in prayer hungering and thirsting for it according to luke 11 13 if ye then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your heavenly father give the holy spirit to them that ask him and matthew 5 6 says blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled the last word in the advice is obey it's the fourth word of advice peter who lived with and preached for jesus for three and a half years without the holy ghost baptism told us we must obey god if we want to be born again it's found in acts 5 32 and we are his witnesses of these things and so also is the holy ghost whom god has given to them that obey him so this is a simple summary of sanctification if you're daily reading the bible asking in prayer for the holy ghost baptism hungering and thirsting for it and obeying the word as sincerely as possible you'll soon receive the holy ghost baptism next let's move on to the section how you'll act when he comes upon you you will act in a similar or same way as the saints in the book of acts who receive the holy ghost and thankfully we have five clear examples of how they acted your experience will match acts and then you'll have the holy spirit fruit following your life after you receive eternal life but first of all who is the holy ghost a viewer asked me to teach the identity of the holy ghost who is he scripturally the holy ghost is god himself the father for god is one person the father shares a measure of his own life in your soul the holy ghost baptism is god himself dwelling permanently in your soul walking in your body according to second corinthians 6 verses 16 16-18 and what agreement at the temple of god with idols for ye are the temple of the living god as god hath said i will dwell in them and walk in them and i will be their god and they shall be my people wherefore come out from among them and be separate saith the lord and touch not the unclean thing and i will receive you and will be a father unto you and ye shall be my sons and daughters saith the lord almighty additionally the holy spirit in your soul is also power eternal life and the spirit of truth to name a few examples the spirit is eternal life according to hebrews 9 14 the spirit is power according to ephesians 6 10 first thessalonians 1 verse 5 2 timothy 1 7 2 peter 1 verses 3 and 4 and revelation 20 verse 6. the spirit is truth or the word of god according to john 14 17 john 4 24 john 15 verse 16 john 16 13 ephesians 1 13 ephesians 5 9 2 thessalonians 2 13 first peter 1 22 first john 4 6 and first john 5 verse 6. now getting back to how you'll act when the holy ghost comes upon you you'll have a bible-based experience with evidence or fruits of the spirit from that time on so how is a believer baptized with the holy ghost he's born again by the spirit of god falling into a soul from heaven causing a bold liberating emotional worship experience i call it the see and hear principle every time a believer was filled with the holy ghost in the book of acts observers could see and hear the outward effects of their inward soul baptism just as you see in here a natural baby's birth you see in here a christian spiritual birth in acts 2 verses 1 to 33 peter originates the see in here principle by telling the multitude this therefore being by the right hand of god exalted and having received of the father the promise of the holy ghost he hath shed forth this which ye now see and hear so peter is the one who originated the sea and here principle five texts from the book of acts illustrate this revelation and acts 11 verse 15 proves the holy ghost will fall into the souls of men in a similar worshipful manner every time and as i began to speak the holy ghost fell on them as on us at the beginning yes the spiritual birth experience will be a bold liberating worship experience for every christian not every experience though will be exactly the same there's not one specific outward evidence of the soul baptism as the scripture proves there can be a variety of expressions at the literal moment of receiving the baptism of the holy ghost such as speaking in tongues so others can understand the gospel or declaring god's wonderful works or prophesying or magnifying god but each experience is unashamedly life-changing a believer's experience must also be word-based meaning the christian can identify how his experience matches one of those in the book of acts when the holy ghost fell upon souls it's as if you were there in the upper room in acts chapter 2 because you've had a similar experience while emotion comes with a see and hear experience it's not the focus of it lots of worshipers get emotional but never fully repent of their sins to experience a changed life the focus at the beginning of the sea and here experience is lovingly praising god while asking him to fill your soul our father loves to hear his children pray and ask him to fulfill his word just as earthly fathers enjoy meeting their children's requests let's look at the five texts from the book of acts that explain this see and hear principle in acts chapter 2 120 believers got so full of the holy ghost they left the upper room and went into the streets of jerusalem about 9 00 am in the morning declaring the wonderful works of god in such a way that they were accused of being drunk on wine the holy ghost in their souls caused these new christians to express the praises of god which flowed out of their souls into their minds and then further out into their bodies and mouths as they moved around the streets and boldly spake of god's works it's been said a natural birth is a mess and so is a spiritual birth all the joy loud worship emotion and victory comes flowing out at once it looks messy to the world like natural drunkenness but it's a spiritual birth it's an emergence it's eternal life acts chapter 2 was not an unemotional scripted sinner's prayer experience this was the promised living water jesus spoke about flowing out of satisfied souls freshly filled with eternal life the second time the holy ghost falls is in acts 4 31 as recently born again christians prayed for boldness to speak god's word and scripture says the holy ghost filled all the saints who were praying for this petition acts 4 24 says they lifted up their voice to god with one accord so we see the see and hear principle again a second time their loud prayers asked for signs wonders and miracles to be done by the name of thy holy child jesus as soon as they were filled with the holy ghost acts 4 says they spake the word of god with boldness the third text is acts chapter 8 verses 14 to 25 when the samaritans receive the baptism of the holy ghost this took place about 100 miles from jerusalem peter and john laid hands on the samaritan and the holy ghost fell upon them it fell in such a powerful way that a former sorcerer and recent christian convert named simon was so amazed by how they acted that he offered peter money if he would give him the power to lay hands on people to impart the holy ghost simon was well acquainted with seeing satan manipulate molest and bewitch people through his own evil sorceries but he had never witnessed such genuine pure holy and righteous empowerment as saints receiving the baptism of the holy ghost a third text of how the holy ghost falls is acts chapter 10 verses 44 to 48. though this text is small its description provides great support for the see and hear principle during peter's sermon cornelius and his house receive the gift of the holy ghost as it's poured out upon many gentiles the jews that were with peter heard cornelius and his gentile family speak with tongues and magnify god praise and worship directed to god always flows out of the mouse of spiritual babes and again acts 11 15 proves the holy ghost fell on the gentiles at cornelius house in the same way it fell upon peter and the jews in acts chapter 2. the final time recorded in the book of acts in which believers receive the holy ghost baptism is acts 19 verses 1 to 7 and you see the see and hear principle displayed by two expressions speaking with tongues and prophesied acts 19 6 says when paul laid his hands on them the holy ghost came on them and they spake with tongues and prophesied god sent tongues to share his works with the ephesians revelation 19 10 promises prophecy for those with jesus's spirit saying the testimony of jesus is the spirit of prophecy in closing i hope you enjoyed this short video please contact me if you have any questions or concerns i want to encourage you to keep seeking the holy ghost until just like a plant like a wheat plant stay planted in the ground and just keep feeding on the things of god abide in christ and you will grow up into that third stage the full corn or the baptism of the holy ghost sometimes it takes years to receive the holy ghost i know in my experience it took almost three years think about the apostles they followed jesus for three and a half years but they still weren't born again just as a natural baby god has a specific time in season for all his spiritual children to be born into the kingdom of god lastly i would advise you to listen to the last 45 minutes of the sermon god hiding himself in simplicity from albuquerque new mexico preached by god's prophet william branham in it you can hear how brother branham leads people to receive the holy ghost and he testifies of how the pillar of fire comes and vindicates those souls that did get the holy ghost shower he calls it please contact me if you have any questions or concerns god bless you and may jesus christ be the desire of your heart
