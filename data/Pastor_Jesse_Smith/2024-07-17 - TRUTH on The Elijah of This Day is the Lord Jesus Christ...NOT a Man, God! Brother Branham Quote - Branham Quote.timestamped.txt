[0:02] but the Elijah this day is the Lord
[0:04] Jesus Christ Hallelujah he is to come
[0:07] coring to Matthew 7 uh Luke 17:30 if the
[0:11] son of man is to reveal himself among
[0:13] his people not a man God but it'll come
[0:17] through a
[0:19] prophet greetings friends in the
[0:21] matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[0:24] the purpose of this video is to help
[0:25] Believers understand brother Ram's
[0:27] statement when he said the Elijah of
[0:30] this day is the Lord Jesus Christ not a
[0:33] man God there's been many accusers of
[0:36] brother brandom who have Mis understood
[0:38] this quote and then misapplied this
[0:40] quote and they've tried to say that
[0:42] brother Brandon was exalting himself as
[0:44] the Lord Jesus Christ in this quote I
[0:47] believe that is an error and this video
[0:49] will prove their Folly this video will
[0:51] prove their misunderstanding of those
[0:54] statements by the grace of God hi
[0:56] friends I'm Jesse Smith pastor bride of
[0:58] Christ Fellowship here in akan Ohio USA
[1:00] and I defend the original Gospel of the
[1:03] Lord Jesus Christ that Jesus revealed to
[1:05] St Paul and then had to restore through
[1:07] Martin Luther John Wesley and the late
[1:09] William brandham a genuine prophet of
[1:11] God who lived from 1909 to 1965 I also
[1:14] defend brother Ram's Godly Christian
[1:16] character the quote from brother
[1:18] brandham in question is from November
[1:20] 27th 1965 trying to do God a service
[1:24] without it being God's will I'm going to
[1:26] play a short portion of the video that
[1:29] many people are
[1:30] misunderstanding brother Ram says but
[1:32] the Elijah this day is the Lord Jesus
[1:34] Christ not a man God but it'll come
[1:36] through a prophet let's listen to the
[1:37] quote in question but the Elijah of this
[1:40] day is the Lord Jesus
[1:42] christall he is to come according to
[1:45] Matthew the 7 Luke 17:30 if the son of
[1:48] man is to reveal himself among his
[1:50] people not a man God but he come to a
[1:54] prophet so friends that was the quote
[1:57] you heard and this is one of the most
[1:58] misunderstood quotes of brother brandham
[2:01] so this video is devoted to showing four
[2:03] reasons why brother brandham was not
[2:06] saying he was a lord Jesus Christ but
[2:08] was emphasizing the Holy Ghost anointing
[2:11] the prophet is the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:14] before getting into those four reasons I
[2:15] want to say there's a similar video that
[2:17] might help you if you're wondering about
[2:19] another often misunderstood and
[2:22] misapplied quote it's the quotes where
[2:24] brother brandom said the word of
[2:25] Pentecost won't work for today I'll
[2:27] leave a link to this video in the
[2:29] description this is video number 90 it
[2:32] was called the word that fell on the day
[2:33] of Pentecost will not work for this day
[2:35] defending the message twice brother Ram
[2:37] said this but what does it mean in the
[2:39] video you'll see it clarifies the
[2:41] meaning it proves brother brandom and
[2:43] the bible teach we still need the
[2:45] baptism of the Holy Ghost for today but
[2:48] brother Randon was talking about we need
[2:49] the prophetic Rapture related scriptures
[2:52] fulfilled in our lives in order for us
[2:54] to go in the first resurrection or the
[2:56] Rapture that's the point brother Brandon
[2:58] was making and and that's true we need
[3:00] more than the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[3:02] scriptures to go in the rapture we
[3:03] actually need the scriptures about the
[3:05] Rapture to be fulfilled in our lives we
[3:07] need to fulfill the scripture by the
[3:09] grace of God death will be swallowed up
[3:11] in life from 1 Corinthians 15 so brother
[3:15] R is making a great point we need more
[3:16] scriptures to be fulfilled if we want to
[3:18] go in the Rapture thank God we're born
[3:19] again thank God we have the baptism of
[3:21] the Holy Ghost as Jesus taught in Acts
[3:23] 1:6 and as they experien in Acts 2:4 but
[3:27] we need God to fulfill the scriptures of
[3:29] the Rapture in our lives to go in the
[3:31] Rapture so let's begin with reason
[3:33] number one on this quote of Elijah of
[3:35] today the first reason most people
[3:38] misunderstand this quote is because they
[3:40] miss the context the context is the
[3:43] emphasis brother places on the spirit of
[3:45] Elijah which is the holy spirit
[3:47] anointing a man and brother brandom says
[3:50] there is five times the spirit of Elijah
[3:52] comes so the first reason is brother
[3:54] random is simply saying the spirit of
[3:56] Elijah is equal to the Holy Spirit and
[3:59] the holy spirit is the Lord Jesus Christ
[4:01] in the spirit
[4:03] form so let's prove this I'm going to
[4:05] play the context of brother Ram's quote
[4:07] so we got to go up two paragraphs before
[4:08] brother Bram said this about the Elijah
[4:10] of the day is the Lord Jesus Christ in
[4:13] these first two paragraphs paragraph 210
[4:15] and 211 brother brandham emphasizes Amos
[4:18] 37 and that's God revealing a secret to
[4:20] a prophet and then he emphasized Malachi
[4:23] 45 and six brother bram's Ministry
[4:25] Elijah Ministry and then he talks about
[4:28] how the spirit of Elijah came five times
[4:31] notice his emphasis is on the spirit of
[4:33] Elijah is to come too God uses that
[4:36] Spirit brother talking about the spirit
[4:38] anointing a prophet let's listen to
[4:40] those two paragraphs now anyone knows
[4:43] that Amos 37 said that God promised that
[4:45] he would never do nothing until first he
[4:48] revealed it to his Prophet through the
[4:51] church ages we've had
[4:54] reformers but promised by Malachi 4 that
[4:57] there would be a prophet in her land in
[4:59] the last days because it has to fit that
[5:02] pattern before the end time com before
[5:05] Jesus come the first Elisha come Elijah
[5:08] of Malachi 3 Matthew 11 says so if you
[5:11] can understand it this is who were
[5:13] spoken of behold I send my My Messenger
[5:16] before me now he's prophesied all
[5:18] theologians believe that that in the
[5:20] last day the spirit of Elisha is to come
[5:22] too it has to come five times God uses
[5:26] that Spirit Elisha Elijah John the
[5:28] Baptist and for the Gentiles church and
[5:30] then for the Jews Revelations 11 chapter
[5:33] that's God g r a c e f a i t h j e f u s
[5:38] the letter five can't stop at four it
[5:41] has to go to five now let's look at the
[5:44] main paragraph in question here it's
[5:46] paragraph 212 notice at the beginning of
[5:48] this paragraph brother Bram says that
[5:50] wasn't Elijah that was the spirit of God
[5:53] on Elijah Elijah was just a man so
[5:56] brother random is emphasizing the
[5:58] difference between the prophet the man
[6:00] and the Holy Ghost anointing that man
[6:02] brother BR was saying Elijah is just a
[6:04] man so in context brother Bram is saying
[6:06] I'm just a man but the spirit of God on
[6:09] me is the Holy Spirit the spirit of
[6:11] Elijah and the spirit of Elijah is the
[6:13] holy spirit which is the spirit of the
[6:15] Lord Jesus Christ so let's listen to
[6:17] that section before he says the Elijah
[6:19] of this day let's listen to the quote
[6:22] now he promised that so that sets the
[6:24] Bible just exactly to this day in the
[6:26] Sodom and Gore and Elijah was not that
[6:28] wasn't Elijah that was the spirit of God
[6:31] on Elijah Elijah was just the man now
[6:34] we've had Elijah and Elijah's popes and
[6:36] Elijah's manels and Elijah everything
[6:40] now that we've heard all the context now
[6:42] let's listen again as brother Ram says
[6:43] but the Elijah this day a lord Jesus
[6:45] Christ he's to come according to Luke
[6:47] 17:30 the son of man to reveal himself
[6:49] among his people not a man God but it'll
[6:52] come through a prophet and here's what
[6:55] the accusers Miss but it'll come through
[6:57] a prophet so God is going to to come
[6:59] through a prophet according to Luke
[7:01] 17:30 just like God came through Elijah
[7:04] and Elisha and John the Baptist and the
[7:08] Elijah of Revelation 11 let's listen to
[7:11] the quote but the Elijah this day is the
[7:14] Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah he is to
[7:17] come according to Matthew 7 Luke 17:30
[7:21] if the son of man is to reveal himself
[7:23] among his people not a man God but it'll
[7:27] come through a prophet now immediately
[7:29] following this quote of the Elijah this
[7:31] day brother Ram goes into how God
[7:33] doesn't send two Major Prophets at the
[7:35] same time I've always wondered about
[7:37] this quote you know God did send two
[7:39] Minor Prophets we'd say in the days of
[7:40] Hagi and Zechariah also Ezekiel and
[7:43] Daniel lived at the same time but they
[7:44] were in different locations so brother
[7:47] Bram never said thus sayith the Lord on
[7:48] that statement so it's not a major it's
[7:50] certainly a minor but notice brother
[7:52] Bram says God has to get one man under
[7:54] his control and then he says it again so
[7:57] he has with Elijah the spirit of Elijah
[8:00] he used that Spirit but the same God
[8:02] controlling it all the time to fulfill
[8:04] his word so again it's on the Holy
[8:06] Spirit controlling the Prophet The
[8:08] Prophet is not the holy spirit it's the
[8:10] spirit controlling the prophet let's
[8:12] listen to the quote now he never had two
[8:15] Major Prophets at the same time never in
[8:18] the
[8:20] world see no matter how much these two
[8:22] two heads can't it has to be one head
[8:24] God has to get one man under his control
[8:27] there's one God
[8:31] there was Father Son and Holy Ghost but
[8:33] one God over all notice he just used
[8:36] them offices so has it with Elijah the
[8:39] spirit of Elijah he used that Spirit but
[8:41] the same God controlling it all the time
[8:43] to fulfill his word now we can move on
[8:45] to reason number two now reason number
[8:47] one is enough to show that the accusers
[8:49] of brother brandom are wrong they're
[8:51] confused perhaps on purpose I don't know
[8:54] but reason number two is prophets can
[8:56] reference the scriptures they fulfill in
[8:58] the context brother R is referencing the
[9:00] scriptures that he's fulfilling he said
[9:02] Amos 3:7 Malachi 4:5 and6 Luke
[9:06] 17:30 a little later in the sermon
[9:09] brother Ram then mentions how he's an
[9:10] anti-type of elaser referencing Genesis
[9:13] CH 24 I believe if I'm not mistaken so
[9:16] before we listen to this El eer quote
[9:18] from the same sermon remember John the
[9:20] Baptist said in John 1:23 he said I am
[9:23] the voice of one crying in the
[9:24] wilderness make straight the way of the
[9:25] Lord as said the prophet Isaiah so it is
[9:29] biblical for prophets to reference the
[9:31] scriptures they fulfilled just like John
[9:33] the Baptist and this is recorded in
[9:34] numerous places like Matthew 3:3 Mark 13
[9:37] Luke
[9:38] 3:4 remember brother Ram said his
[9:41] ministry would be a prophet Ministry the
[9:43] Holy Ghost would come through a prophet
[9:44] just like John the Baptist just like
[9:47] brother Ram talked about John the
[9:48] Baptist fulfilling the first part of
[9:50] Malachi 45 and 6 turning the hearts of
[9:53] the fathers to the children so let's
[9:55] listen to this quote it's a little later
[9:56] in the sermon trying new to God of
[9:58] service brother cites Malachi 45 and6
[10:02] and then he cites Genesis 24 El eer
[10:05] let's listen to the quote but now is the
[10:07] bride
[10:09] calling now it's when the Seven Seals
[10:11] has been
[10:13] opened now when the complete things that
[10:15] the reformers left has to be open and
[10:17] only Malachi 4 can do that because it
[10:19] take the Revelation straight from God to
[10:22] an individual to do
[10:26] so it can't come to a group never did
[10:30] one man that's what God promised in the
[10:33] shadows of the coming for his bride an
[10:36] El reason number three brother Ram's
[10:39] accusers misunderstand this quote is
[10:41] because they fail to see that brother
[10:43] random emphasized his Humanity in this
[10:45] very sermon numerous times the first is
[10:48] in paragraph 97 brother Ram said I'm
[10:50] getting to be an old man I know my time
[10:53] ain't too long I know that someday this
[10:55] heart's going to make its last beat and
[10:57] I'm entering into a great dark chamber
[10:59] they called Death so brother R is not
[11:01] saying he's the Lord Jesus Christ he's
[11:03] saying Jesus Christ was anointing him
[11:05] with the spirit of Elijah because he
[11:06] even can see he's going to die at some
[11:08] point and very fittingly he passed away
[11:11] less than a month later God must have
[11:13] shown him it was his time to go and he
[11:15] recognizes he wants to repent for every
[11:18] sin and he wants to be pure by the grace
[11:20] of God and wrap himself in the
[11:22] righteousness of Jesus Christ let's
[11:24] listen to the
[11:25] quote I'm getting to be an old man and I
[11:28] know my time ain't too long if Jesus
[11:32] parries I I could stay a little while
[11:35] but I know that
[11:37] someday this heart's going to make its
[11:39] last beat and I'm entering into a great
[11:42] dark chamber there called death but when
[11:46] that comes I don't want anything to have
[11:47] to look back for and try to repent
[11:50] for I want when to come to that time to
[11:52] be clean and pure by the grace of God I
[11:56] want to wrap myself in the Robes of his
[11:58] righteousness when I enter there with
[12:00] this one thing in my mind I know him in
[12:03] the power of his
[12:04] resurrection and when he calls I'll come
[12:07] out from among the dead and live with
[12:10] him forever then there's another quote
[12:12] later in paragraph 302 brother Ram says
[12:16] after God sends a messenger they take
[12:18] his message because he just lives a
[12:20] little while so again brother Ram knew
[12:22] he was a messenger and he knew he'd just
[12:24] live a little while brother R was not
[12:25] saying he was a lord Jesus Christ he
[12:27] said he was anointed by the Lord Jesus
[12:29] Christ let's listen to the quote about
[12:31] Messengers live just a little while
[12:34] always it's right at the end of the
[12:36] church age where they got the things so
[12:38] the ecclesiastics so messed up until God
[12:41] sends a messenger and that's the message
[12:44] of that church a then they take his
[12:45] message because he used to lived a
[12:46] little while and God then they take his
[12:48] message and still are caring on with the
[12:50] rest of it they make a a denomination
[12:54] and then they come make another
[12:55] denomination another messenger take
[12:57] another one you all seen in my book
[12:58] it'll all be dra out in the seven Church
[13:01] Ages which he told me which I stand by
[13:04] as a witness to God to be judged at the
[13:06] day of judgment for it come from God not
[13:08] from my thinking another quote is from
[13:11] paragraphs 338 and 339 brother Bram is
[13:15] giving the altar call and he says how
[13:17] many want the Lord to fill your heart
[13:20] with his presence that you could live by
[13:23] God's presence and brother Ram says
[13:25] twice I cannot fill it God bless you I
[13:28] cannot fill it
[13:29] God can fill it so brother random again
[13:32] emphasizes his Humanity I can't fill you
[13:35] only the Holy Ghost can fill you let's
[13:37] listen to the quote the place is packed
[13:39] in
[13:40] Jam overflowed I couldn't call you to an
[13:44] altar there's no alar here to call you
[13:46] you but the alar is in your heart won't
[13:50] you let that little conviction that
[13:52] Jesus Christ is real move right up close
[13:54] today and call the rest of his body to
[13:57] you manger and your heart if he isn't
[14:00] there would you raise your hand in a
[14:03] sign to him saying Lord F me fill me
[14:08] with your word and with your presence
[14:09] that I might live by you father every
[14:12] head is bowed every eyes closed all
[14:15] across the nation raise your hands
[14:17] you're in the visible audience and out
[14:19] there to and I offer prayer for it's all
[14:21] I can do I cannot feel it God bless you
[14:25] I cannot feel it God bless you God can
[14:28] feel it God BL your hands going up here
[14:30] in the visible audience every feel it f
[14:34] me odar f
[14:36] me the fourth and final reason is that
[14:38] brother Ram never exalted himself as far
[14:41] as I know so some people have told me
[14:43] that brother Ram exalted himself on tape
[14:45] I've never seen that I've been studying
[14:46] brother Ram's quotes for over 22 years
[14:49] here's just a few examples of how
[14:51] brother Ram humbled himself in the
[14:53] seventh seal brother brandom says you
[14:55] forget anything about me I'm a sinner
[14:58] saved by grace not fit to live I ain't
[15:01] saying that to be humble there's not one
[15:04] sound thing at all in me let's listen to
[15:06] the quote we don't want never put a man
[15:09] in it you forget anything about me I am
[15:12] your brother a sinner saved by grace not
[15:16] fit to live that's exactly the truth and
[15:20] I say that to be humble that's facts
[15:23] there's nothing in me not one sound
[15:25] thing at all here's another one from the
[15:28] anointed ones of the time July 25th 65
[15:32] brother brandom shows again I wasn't the
[15:34] one that appeared down at the river I'm
[15:36] not the one that performs these things
[15:37] and foretells them that happens as
[15:40] perfect as they are like the video I
[15:42] have of six thus sayi the Lord's brother
[15:43] R told before the fact proving he's a
[15:46] prophet of God he said it wasn't what I
[15:48] knew it wasn't me it was the
[15:51] manifestation of the son of man it's not
[15:53] a man it's God you're not feeding on a
[15:56] man so I love this quote it's a very
[15:58] famous quote popular quote brother Ram
[15:59] saying it's not me I'm just surrendering
[16:01] to the spirit of God let's listen to the
[16:04] quote I wasn't the one that appeared
[16:06] down on the river I was only standing
[16:08] there when he
[16:10] appeared I'm not the one that performs
[16:12] these things and foretells these things
[16:14] that happens as perfectly are I'm
[16:17] only one that's near when he does it I
[16:21] was only a voice that he used to say it
[16:25] it wasn't what I knew it's what I Just
[16:28] Surrender myself too that he spoke
[16:30] through it isn't me it wasn't the
[16:33] seventh angel oh no it was a
[16:37] manifestation of the son of man it
[16:39] wasn't the angel his message it was a
[16:43] mystery that God unfolded it's not a man
[16:48] it's
[16:50] God the angel was not the son of man he
[16:53] was a messenger from the son of
[16:56] man the son of man is Christ Christ he's
[17:00] the one that you're feeding on you're
[17:02] not feeding on a man a man his words
[17:07] will fail but you're feeding on the
[17:10] unfailing body word of the son of man
[17:15] here's some other quotes I've read
[17:16] recently that have just blessed me so
[17:18] much in the serpent seed 58 brother
[17:20] brandham said if there's one thing I
[17:22] have to do to be saved Jesus Christ died
[17:24] in Vain by Grace I'm saved let's listen
[17:27] to the quote brother if there is one
[17:30] thing that I have to do Jesus Christ
[17:33] died in vain
[17:35] amen Grace I am saved and not by by
[17:39] myself but by the will of God and by the
[17:42] goodness of
[17:43] God in the next quote brother Ram said
[17:46] I'm always a failure but God never fails
[17:49] that's because brother Ram said I don't
[17:50] speak my words I speak his words let's
[17:52] listen to the
[17:53] quote say aren't you afraid of failing
[17:56] I'm never I'm always a failure he never
[17:58] does I don't speak my words I speak his
[18:01] that's the reason you're always right
[18:03] see that's the reason I asked the world
[18:05] show me one time it didn't come to pass
[18:08] show me one time of the thousands of
[18:10] things that he said not one time did it
[18:13] fail and it never will because it's God
[18:17] not
[18:18] man here's a final quote from 1962 and
[18:21] thy seed shall possess the Gate of his
[18:23] enemy brother is praying to God and then
[18:25] in the prayer he breaks into rebuking
[18:27] Satan he said I charge thee by Jesus
[18:30] Christ the son of God knowing I have no
[18:32] power within myself I haven't power to
[18:34] stop you but I do have authority of
[18:37] God's word as a servant to preach it and
[18:39] Duty bound to that Authority again
[18:41] brother R saying I have no power it's
[18:43] only the authority of Jesus Christ let's
[18:45] listen to the quote Satan I'm against
[18:48] you because you're an enemy of my Lord
[18:52] You're an enemy of his
[18:53] word and I charge thee by Jesus Christ
[18:57] the son of God
[18:59] as a mortal being knowing that I have no
[19:02] power within
[19:04] myself I have a power to stop you I
[19:07] haven't power to make any of these women
[19:10] clean up any of these men that's listen
[19:12] to this taper or wherever I have no way
[19:15] of making them clean
[19:16] up I'm powerless but I do have the
[19:20] authority of God's word as a servant to
[19:23] preach and Duty bound to that
[19:27] Authority near this policeman out here
[19:29] have power to stop a car but he has
[19:32] authority to do
[19:34] it in
[19:36] closing friends I hope this video was a
[19:38] blessing by the grace of God remember
[19:40] friends the elect cannot be deceived
[19:42] according to Matthew
[19:43] 24:4 if it were possible they shall
[19:45] deceive the very elect it's impossible
[19:48] for the elect to be deceived and of
[19:50] course this means deceived into
[19:52] blaspheming or deceived into leaving the
[19:54] truth we know there will be foolish
[19:56] virgins who don't accept the message but
[19:58] they the truth of the Lord Jesus Christ
[20:01] and they do not blaspheme the Lord Jesus
[20:02] Christ but those of us who want to be
[20:04] wise virgins with the baptism of the
[20:06] Holy Ghost we cannot be deceived when
[20:08] people try to slander brother brandham
[20:10] or or misapply his quotes or twist his
[20:12] quotes the spirit of God will guide us
[20:15] into all truth as Jesus Promised in John
[20:18] 16:13 remember friends the deception is
[20:21] greatest here at the end time that's
[20:22] according to 2 Timothy 3:13 evil men and
[20:25] seducers shall act worse and worse
[20:27] deceiving and being deceived so we need
[20:29] the Holy Ghost with the spirit of
[20:31] discernment to recognize the Antichrist
[20:34] Spirit call it out and just like brother
[20:36] Ram taught us prove all things saying
[20:38] you're not saying what Paul said you are
[20:40] therefore false that's why I love that
[20:42] video the Holy Spirit inspired me to
[20:44] make about 110 false doctrines of the
[20:46] denominational churches that brother
[20:48] brandham corrected and of course there's
[20:50] way more than 110 that's just what I
[20:51] found during that short study that video
[20:54] proves we have the true Bible Doctrine
[20:56] the original Bible doctrine that s St
[20:58] Paul taught we have it by the grace of
[21:00] God because the Lord Jesus Christ
[21:02] revealed it to his Prophet brother
[21:04] random to finish the mystery of God to
[21:06] restore all things according to
[21:08] Revelation 10:7 Matthew 17:11 here's
[21:11] what I find friends people that leave
[21:13] the message in my humble opinion it's my
[21:16] guess that they don't dig down deep
[21:18] enough to get into the spirit of
[21:20] Revelation they don't pray enough
[21:22] perhaps they don't call on God enough as
[21:24] brother brandham said when brother Bram
[21:26] indicted the denominations that's what
[21:27] he said that agrees with Proverbs 2: 3-6
[21:31] the Bible says if you cry after
[21:33] knowledge and you lift up your voice for
[21:35] understanding and seek it as silver and
[21:37] search for it as hid Treasures then
[21:39] you'll understand the fear of God then
[21:40] you'll find the knowledge of God for the
[21:42] lord giveth wisdom think of this in
[21:45] relation to this video these people
[21:47] accusing brother Braham they didn't even
[21:48] go up one two or three paragraphs above
[21:50] the statement to get the context of what
[21:52] brother Brandon was saying nor did they
[21:54] read after that quote and then listen to
[21:57] the rest of the sermon where brother
[21:58] Rams emphasizing his humanity and how
[22:01] only Jesus Christ can fill a person so
[22:03] this shows these accusers don't dig down
[22:06] deep enough and get in the spirit of
[22:07] Revelation let's listen to the quote now
[22:10] what did they do they didn't know it
[22:12] today men walk ignorantly they don't
[22:14] know that's a truth they think it's some
[22:16] kind of a ISM they don't dig down deep
[22:18] enough to get into the spirit of
[22:20] Revelation they don't pray
[22:23] enough they don't caught up on God
[22:25] enough and remember friends I'm not
[22:27] talking about all of brother Ram's
[22:29] accusers I'm only talking about some of
[22:32] them and I don't know which ones they
[22:34] are only they know which ones they are
[22:37] the ones that falsely accuse and don't
[22:39] dig down deep enough and study the word
[22:41] of God and don't pray enough again not
[22:44] all brother Ram's accusers only some of
[22:46] them friends if these accusers of
[22:48] brother Ram prayed more and got in the
[22:50] Holy Spirit they would know you can't
[22:52] add to the Bible and call God three
[22:54] persons you can't take away from the
[22:57] Bible and allow women to pre preach to
[22:58] men and allow women to cut their hair or
[23:01] men to grow their hair long and uncut if
[23:04] they got in the spirit of the Holy Ghost
[23:06] they'd see in the book of Acts there's
[23:08] five water baptism examples where
[23:10] they're baptized in the name of the Lord
[23:11] Jesus Christ or Jesus Christ or Lord
[23:14] Jesus or Lord but we know it's a
[23:16] revelation of the one name of God the
[23:18] Lord Jesus Christ father son Holy
[23:21] Ghost if they got in the spirit of
[23:23] Revelation they'd see the 110 or more
[23:26] doctrines that brother Ram straightened
[23:27] out by the power of the Holy Ghost in
[23:29] order to fulfill the scriptures
[23:31] Revelation 10:7 Matthew 1711 acts 320
[23:35] and 21 Malachi 4:5 and 6 Luke 17:30 Amos
[23:40] 3:7 friends we're thankful that we've
[23:43] received brother brandham because
[23:44] brother man's Ministry was God's
[23:45] compassion on his people just like all
[23:48] prophets God sent were his compassion on
[23:50] the people according to 2 Chronicles
[23:53] 36:15 the Lord God of their fathers sent
[23:56] to them by his Messengers because
[23:58] because he had compassion on his people
[24:00] but the sad part is in verse 16 a lot of
[24:02] the accusers of brother Brandon
[24:03] fulfilled this scripture but they mock
[24:05] The Messengers of God and despise his
[24:07] words and misuse His prophets so let's
[24:10] pray for those who accuse brother
[24:12] Brandon
[24:13] falsely father God I pray for the
[24:15] accusers of brother Brandon once again
[24:16] Lord God I just pray all those that can
[24:19] repent of their slander their reviling
[24:22] their evil words of calling brother
[24:23] brandom Antichrist Lord I just pray they
[24:26] would repent and be forgiven by the
[24:28] grace of of God lord father forgive them
[24:30] they don't know what they're saying Lord
[24:31] God so I pray for your mercy on brother
[24:33] R's accusers Lord God you told us to
[24:36] pray for those who despise us speak
[24:38] against us so I pray for those who mock
[24:41] your Prophet mock his bible-based
[24:43] teachings misuse his quotes misapply his
[24:47] quotes I pray they'll come to genuine
[24:48] repentance in the name of the Lord Jesus
[24:51] Christ I ask it
[24:53] amen if you have any questions concerns
[24:55] or testimonies about this video please
[24:57] contact me
[24:59] God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[25:01] the desire of your heart
