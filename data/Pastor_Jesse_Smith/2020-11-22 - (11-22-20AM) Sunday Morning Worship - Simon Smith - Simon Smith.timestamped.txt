[8:17] uh so if you'd like to come last year i
[8:19] think bang
[8:20] and his family and amen and hua came i
[8:22] think last year i don't know if this is
[8:23] gonna be annual thing or not but
[8:26] you don't have much family in this area
[8:28] and we can't drive home every
[8:29] thanksgiving because we've got eight

[8:32] if you'd like to come over let me know
[8:34] in jose you can bring all 16 your family

[9:04] thanksgiving morning
[9:06] and then at some point we have to give a
[9:08] big thanks to the sisters you know
[9:10] for all their cooking so at some point
[9:12] we need to do that so
[9:13] just that's really i think the only
[9:14] announcement by god's grace also that
[9:16] the youtube church channel is now
[9:18] working but it's not working like it's
[9:20] working it's back on
[9:21] we were banned for three months because
[9:23] i played somebody's video
[9:25] i was trying to help the church and they
[9:27] banned us for three months
[9:28] i've been streaming from my own personal
[9:30] youtube account just so you know it's on
[9:32] so i'll send you the link to that once
[9:33] we get it figured out so the audio is
[9:35] going but the video is not going so it's
[9:37] like a black screen
[9:39] but the voice is coming through that's
[9:40] all it really matters is the voice
[9:42] pretty much
[9:42] because it's the voice of the holy
[9:43] spirit through the bride because the
[9:45] spirit
[9:46] and the bride say yeah just so you know
[9:48] that's back on uh by god's
[9:50] grace many many prayer requests let's

[31:46] a little study uh here i'm not gonna do
[31:49] a song special
[31:51] tonight
[31:55] just in the back there just listening
[31:56] and we worship the lord and it's so good
[31:58] and
[31:58] feels so good and a lot of times you
[32:01] know we don't
[32:03] walk in the spear like we should and
[32:06] dwell in the spirit and
[32:10] those sort of things
[32:16] there you go that should be on
[32:19] uh but does feel good to get in the
[32:20] presence of god and to really
[32:23] feel him and to know he's there and to
[32:25] love on him and let him know that you
[32:26] love them
[32:28] uh i do have a powerpoint here we'll see
[32:31] if we can
[32:34] get it loaded up by god's grace
[32:39] let's see oh we got okay
[32:43] um i did teach this at home and uh
[32:47] recently so we'll get into this study
[32:50] and i think we'll probably continue this
[32:52] tonight by god's grace
[32:54] it's a sobering uh
[32:58] subject it's a to me it's this is a
[33:00] heart this is a
[33:02] kind of where the rubber meets the road
[33:03] a real reality
[33:09] because we can read you know fictional
[33:11] stories and
[33:12] watch maybe uh or listen to somebody
[33:15] tell like a little
[33:17] goofy story i mean i used to tell lydia
[33:20] about
[33:20] trunk monkey for years i convinced her
[33:24] that was true
[33:24] [Laughter]
[33:27] there was a little crazy monkey that
[33:29] lived in my trunk and cleaned my tools
[33:30] after work every day and i paid him
[33:33] his dividends and i paid he was my
[33:34] indentured servant and he
[33:36] and i flew in a female monkey and they
[33:39] got married her name was treetop and
[33:42] they had little monkey children and i
[33:44] had a whole story going just
[33:46] for years and i told some good stories
[33:52] and they were funny i would laugh myself
[33:54] [Laughter]
[33:56] i didn't plan it we just went off the
[33:57] top of our heads and
[34:00] i'm pretty sure the lord probably didn't
[34:02] give me those stories
[34:06] you just made him up we caught maybe by
[34:09] a gift
[34:11] uh but you know fictional things and
[34:15] things we make up like that are are
[34:17] funny you know or they can't be or
[34:19] um but reality will be setting in here
[34:23] we live in reality the real world our
[34:26] decisions have real consequences
[34:30] uh life has real challenges
[34:36] and we have to battle those things so
[34:38] anyhow we'll keep you standing long
[34:39] let's go to
[34:40] isaiah 24 17.
[34:46] it's a simple a simple thought a simple
[34:48] study to uh this morning
[34:51] uh but it's real and that's this is
[34:55] these are you know and you'll read a
[34:57] couple we'll read a couple quotes here
[34:58] uh later on and
[35:02] and uh because we know the past we can
[35:06] study the past and
[35:07] from what we remember of our own lives
[35:09] we know the past and
[35:10] uh we can see present time
[35:14] what we're allowed to see but the future
[35:16] is unknown
[35:18] we really don't know what's going to
[35:19] happen in the future
[35:21] and we're all striving we're running
[35:22] we're trying to fight the good fight of
[35:24] faith we're all striving for the same
[35:26] thing
[35:27] eternal life uh to receive the promises
[35:31] of this day
[35:33] and now this has something to do with it
[35:35] so let's read this here scripture and
[35:36] we'll have you seated
[35:38] um isaiah 24
[35:41] 17 fear and the pit
[35:45] and the snare are upon thee
[35:48] oh inhabitant of the earth so say word
[35:51] of prayer
[35:54] this thing real soberly here dearly
[35:57] father lord jesus lord we come humbly
[35:59] lord and lord for whatever reason lord
[36:01] you have me behind this little
[36:04] pulpit lord or pulpit or however you
[36:06] want to say it or even a little desk
[36:09] and lord uh you know i don't feel
[36:11] qualified by any means lord to be here
[36:13] and
[36:14] just a tiny little something that rather
[36:16] lord you've allowed a
[36:18] grace to come into the world here the
[36:20] lord you've uh
[36:23] depend here lord on this day and lord we
[36:25] just want to
[36:26] convey the very thought lord do you
[36:29] please lord this
[36:30] deep conviction lord hear this real
[36:32] serious
[36:33] uh thought here lord you know we just
[36:34] pray it's a blessing to the people god
[36:37] let me just speak this morning lord just
[36:39] in the way you would have lord you know
[36:41] my limited abilities lord and the lord
[36:43] you're a limitless god and lord
[36:45] maybe you can take what little few small
[36:47] words i have lord and just form a little
[36:50] blessing to the people god make it out
[36:51] of fine glory to
[36:53] we continue it's nice we love you bless
[36:56] the people god in the name of jesus
[36:57] christ amen
[36:58] you have your seeds
[37:09] [Music]
[37:11] so this morning uh we started out with
[37:13] this scripture
[37:16] kind of a real uh
[37:20] sobering scripture
[37:23] maybe one would say and another another
[37:27] phrase would be
[37:28] the philistines are upon you
[37:34] right
[37:38] so first off i think i would like to
[37:39] maybe read this little bit of quote here
[37:42] my wife's already sat through this study
[37:44] and little emma jane there who we've had
[37:46] it was a great uh
[37:50] passenger in the car like she's a good
[37:52] traveling companion
[37:54] she has many stories and things she
[37:57] tells of her family and
[38:00] little nuggets of funniness
[38:03] i don't know i i like listening to her
[38:07] and then we got a little sneak attack
[38:08] last this last week here
[38:10] on brother jesse and we all drove
[38:14] incognito and under cover of darkness
[38:17] and
[38:18] with one headlight all the way from the
[38:19] town there was surprising one is
[38:21] and then i missed his driveway and went
[38:23] to the ditch and
[38:24] then uh yeah pretty good speed too
[38:27] [Laughter]
[38:30] we were jumping and jumping up and down
[38:32] asher was scared
[38:36] and then we ended up scaring brother
[38:37] jesse come out and he was
[38:40] sister chris is out of all the times he
[38:42] takes the trash out he takes it out
[38:44] right there when we get there and we
[38:45] and we're all hiding behind the truck
[38:46] and jesse's standing there like this
[38:48] with his trash he's like
[38:50] who goes there are you for us or against
[38:54] us
[38:56] just pulling out quotes from joshua
[39:01] looking for swords but oh i did well
[39:06] by god's grace and we want to be a
[39:08] blessing to our brother here and
[39:12] we don't we don't do these things for we
[39:14] do them because we love
[39:15] our your pastor and he's my brother
[39:17] natural spiritual and
[39:19] uh and it's edifying wouldn't be a
[39:21] blessing to people
[39:22] you know and it was a good time we had a
[39:25] good trip there back and
[39:26] very good time here so anyhow in these
[39:30] last fleeting moments here of
[39:33] i'll say like this freedom
[39:36] and what even i was like this and the
[39:38] illusion of the freedom that we think we
[39:39] have that they give us
[39:41] we're still very free
[39:45] but it's going to deteriorate rapidly
[39:48] we know that so i'd like to teach maybe
[39:50] on uh and we'll i think we'll teach on
[39:52] this maybe lord william tonight
[39:54] as well my pastor has probably done a
[39:57] eight or nine series on this
[40:03] by god's grace we'll get into some
[40:04] heavier stuff maybe
[40:06] tonight that i i really looked at and i
[40:09] i really believe
[40:10] we need to examine these things once
[40:11] again um
[40:15] uh but to this morning like to teach on
[40:18] the trail the serpent
[40:20] uh and with the subtitle of impulses
[40:24] so um i know the prophet the man of god
[40:28] was
[40:28] leaning on bringing a series on this as
[40:32] well or maybe a sermon or two
[40:34] he had pronounced that he was going to
[40:36] teach on this and and the lord decided
[40:38] not to have him teach on it
[40:41] maybe he would have exposed too much
[40:45] and uh would have left everything in the
[40:47] light then and we would have
[40:49] been aware maybe we would have uh been
[40:52] able to pinpoint more accurately
[40:55] and maybe it would have left uh
[40:58] that spirit and those people uh
[41:01] maybe it would have left them a little
[41:03] cover little cloaks
[41:06] uh but god allowed them to allow
[41:09] a prophet not to teach on it and it left
[41:12] them and
[41:12] they can stay in the dark and hide out
[41:14] the best they can now still
[41:16] right but god's left it up now to the
[41:18] bride to
[41:19] look at these things and to examine
[41:23] these things so anyhow
[41:25] i want to start out with just reading a
[41:26] a little we got a little bit of reading
[41:28] here a little bit of of uh
[41:29] of course you know i'm just a little
[41:31] teacher guy just going in here and uh
[41:33] but i want to read this because this is
[41:34] coming this is coming soon
[41:37] saints of god this uh our plot the
[41:40] american
[41:41] life has never been more confusing than
[41:43] it is right now
[41:44] there's never been more fear there's
[41:46] never been more of
[41:48] anything right than right now unknown
[41:51] the uh the things coming look it says
[41:54] this temptation is exactly like the
[41:56] temptation
[41:58] and eden now remember eden goes right
[42:00] eden takes us right back to the
[42:02] beginning
[42:02] we'll go one two three four five six
[42:05] seven but then what eight will take us
[42:06] right back to the beginning and that
[42:08] might play in maybe a little bit here
[42:10] sooner
[42:12] this temptation exactly is exactly like
[42:14] the temptation even it will be a very
[42:16] inviting
[42:17] proposition held up in direct opposition
[42:19] to god's commanded word and yet from the
[42:21] standpoint of human reasoning
[42:22] it will be ever so right so enlightening
[42:25] and life-giving is to fool the world
[42:29] only the very elected the elect will not
[42:32] be fooled
[42:33] yes yes we count ourselves the very
[42:36] elect of god
[42:37] amen amen the word of god has come out
[42:41] in the 40s 50s and 60s it's shot out
[42:45] yes it's a run around the world and it
[42:47] has fallen onto your ears
[42:50] somewhere brother jose you have caught
[42:53] this message
[42:54] and it has taken you and transformed you
[42:58] and changed you and it's done us all
[42:59] we've all changed from what we were
[43:05] this is the economical move that has
[43:08] started on
[43:08] what seems such a beautiful and blessed
[43:10] principle fulfilling christ's prayer
[43:12] that we
[43:13] all might be one
[43:17] i'm going to throw this little nugget
[43:18] out here because our pastor just
[43:20] masterfully
[43:23] god is using him to reveal some things
[43:28] fulfilling christ's prayer that we all
[43:29] might be one
[43:31] do you ever hear that song we are one
[43:35] in the spirit we are
[43:38] one in the lord we
[43:42] are one in the spirit
[43:45] do you know who wrote that you know what
[43:49] that was written for that was written by
[43:52] a catholic priest
[43:55] to bind the catholics and the
[43:57] protestants together
[44:00] and that song is so catchy that song is
[44:03] so anointed and who knows has a what on
[44:05] it
[44:07] that is now even the song in the message
[44:09] of the hour
[44:10] [Music]
[44:11] a catholic trap snare
[44:14] musically a little nugget for you
[44:17] and what is saying that we are one
[44:20] in the spirit he talks about the father
[44:23] and the son
[44:25] and the holy ghost it's a catholic song
[44:28] infiltrated
[44:32] becomes so strong politically that he
[44:34] she bears
[44:35] pressure upon the government to cause
[44:37] all to join with her
[44:38] either directly or through adherence to
[44:40] principles enacted into
[44:42] law things the laws are going to be
[44:45] changed
[44:48] the commander-in-chief whoever will be
[44:50] will start doing
[44:51] what they call those the executive
[44:55] orders thank you brother jesse
[44:57] executive orders are coming
[45:04] enacted into law that's an old people
[45:06] will be recognized as actual churches
[45:08] unless they're under direct or indirect
[45:10] domination of this council
[45:12] little groups will lose charters
[45:15] privileges etc are we ready to lose
[45:17] things
[45:18] yes yes was it ten years ago
[45:21] the baptist minister paul walsher we saw
[45:24] the video he
[45:25] he blasted and warned the baptist church
[45:28] he says be ready
[45:29] be prepared to lose your cars your
[45:31] houses
[45:32] your jobs prepare for persecution
[45:36] we saw it yeah that's right right they
[45:39] are a warning
[45:41] yes what about us who believe in one
[45:44] person godhead believe in the lord jesus
[45:47] christ baptism
[45:48] amen amen to become chaplains
[45:51] uh sorry he says they will lose all
[45:54] property
[45:55] and spiritual rights with the people for
[45:57] example right now unless
[45:59] local administ ministerial association
[46:01] approves
[46:02] in many if not most cities one cannot
[46:04] rent a building for religious
[46:05] services to become chaplains in the
[46:08] armed services
[46:09] hospitals etc is now almost mandatory to
[46:12] be recognized as acceptable to the
[46:14] trinitarian economical groups
[46:16] you know years ago we tried to get into
[46:18] ccno which is a
[46:20] uh a jail area for
[46:23] in the striker ohio but because we're
[46:26] not trinitarian we were allowed to come
[46:27] in
[46:29] ten years ago we can't because we're not
[46:31] trinitarians university
[46:33] all right uh where the cam tried to go
[46:35] full-time pastor and we tried to get
[46:37] into the
[46:38] uh insurance that the
[46:41] pastors can share and the religious can
[46:43] share and
[46:44] and uh but he started looking to find
[46:47] paperwork you have to sign that you're
[46:48] trinitarian
[46:50] so you can't do that
[46:56] this pressure increases and it will
[46:59] and it will it will be harder to resist
[47:04] for to resist is to lose privileges
[47:07] do we have rights or actually do we have
[47:09] privileges
[47:12] because these rights should be rights
[47:13] but if they're taken away i wonder if
[47:15] they're really rights or were they just
[47:16] privileges they allotted to you and i
[47:21] [Music]
[47:22] hey and so many will be tempted to go
[47:25] along
[47:26] for they will feel what is better to
[47:27] serve god publicly in the framework of
[47:30] this organization than not to serve god
[47:32] at all
[47:32] publicly right but they err
[47:35] to believe the devil's lies to serve
[47:37] satan even though
[47:39] you may want to call him jehovah but the
[47:41] elect will not be deceived
[47:43] amen furthermore the elect will not only
[47:46] be
[47:47] kept but as this moves becomes the image
[47:50] erected to
[47:51] the beast the saints will be gone
[47:54] in the rapture amen praise be to god
[47:57] amen and this little delight some
[48:00] winsome move that started out in ephesus
[48:03] sorry in a fellowship at ephesus will
[48:05] become the monster of satan that defies
[48:07] and deceives the whole world
[48:12] for the church system of the roman
[48:14] catholic and the protestants
[48:16] in coming together will control the
[48:18] whole wealth
[48:19] of the world system and force the whole
[48:21] earth into its religious trap
[48:23] or will kill them
[48:26] the trail of the serpent by refusing
[48:29] them the privilege
[48:30] the privilege i thought it was all right
[48:32] we could go buy milk and
[48:34] uh kashi cereal
[48:37] uh your favorite fruit roll-ups i
[48:40] thought it was right
[48:41] or is it a privilege
[48:46] of buying and selling whereby we would
[48:48] make a living
[48:50] this will be accomplished simply for the
[48:53] harlots
[48:54] daughters are all but going back to
[48:55] where in the meantime rome has acquired
[48:57] nearly all
[48:58] the supplies of gold the jews have the
[49:00] bonds on the paper and right now the
[49:02] harlot will
[49:02] destroy and sorry and at the right time
[49:05] and that time is drawing near the harlot
[49:08] will destroy the present-day money
[49:10] system by calling in all the paper
[49:12] and demanding gold and with no gold the
[49:14] system falls
[49:16] the church will be trapped and come into
[49:18] alliance and the harlot
[49:19] church will take over the whole world
[49:24] we are at this time
[49:28] economies are wavering everything's
[49:30] shaking financially
[49:32] i mean everything is just
[49:35] insane
[49:39] for those who voted for biden who's
[49:42] all about socialism and giving the
[49:44] country back to china
[49:45] and just letting him china have their
[49:47] way and all not trying to get
[49:48] politically political
[49:49] but then of course it goes down back to
[49:51] even abortion and all those things
[49:56] insanity
[49:58] but now look what the word of god says
[50:00] and take heed to yourselves unless at
[50:02] any time your hearts be over
[50:04] charged with separating that is
[50:06] overeating
[50:07] yes this is a warning for this age yes
[50:12] sir
[50:13] overeating would be a problem in this
[50:16] age
[50:17] what does overeating do it dolls the
[50:19] senses yes sir
[50:21] yes sir it gives the body more strength
[50:23] in the spirit less
[50:25] yes jesus said what he says he says
[50:28] the the spirit is willing but the flesh
[50:30] is weak
[50:31] and how do we make it weak by what he
[50:33] here jesus himself the man the man
[50:36] the manna from heaven said overeating
[50:39] yes sir especially in america yes sir
[50:43] and drunkenness and cares
[50:46] of this life
[50:50] right now if you sit in these seats are
[50:52] you able to focus on the word of god
[50:54] or or this or our minds thinking about
[50:57] something else
[51:00] a care a concern
[51:03] mean brother mike just spent 12 hours
[51:04] switching out my electrical panel
[51:07] took 12 hours when we had to go we had
[51:08] to meet toledo grab stuff get all the
[51:10] parts this this then i divided and then
[51:12] head back here and then we had to
[51:14] install it and then i i got to pull my
[51:16] first meter i mean
[51:18] then i'd put it back in
[51:22] and at that yesterday my mind was
[51:23] completely sued
[51:25] consumed by electrical meters
[51:28] and switching it to a 200 amp service
[51:31] [Laughter]
[51:33] and i could not think of anything else
[51:35] but this but getting this job done
[51:40] and the cares of this life and so that
[51:43] they would come upon you
[51:45] unawares and even though in america
[51:49] right now where everything's wavering
[51:50] tipsy
[51:51] turn tommy and turvy or however you want
[51:53] to say it everything's unknown
[51:55] and yeah a lot of us still have jobs and
[51:58] we go about the daily routines
[52:00] of our life yes sir like all this
[52:03] everything's
[52:04] happening up here but we're still stuck
[52:07] in our little lives going around the
[52:09] exact same mountain
[52:10] doing the exact same thing time and time
[52:12] and day after day after day
[52:15] and it seems like even though
[52:17] everything's insane nothing's affecting
[52:18] us
[52:23] we are still consumed in the cares of
[52:25] this life and
[52:26] do we have to live like that we have to
[52:27] live like that that's our that's our
[52:28] life
[52:31] but within the inside of our hearts and
[52:33] our souls we should be so
[52:35] thinking on the mind of god on the lord
[52:38] is this the season
[52:39] amen amen lord don't let me miss it yes
[52:44] a lot of times when i pray i say lord
[52:45] make it so plain i cannot miss it
[52:49] i said lord you know you made me not the
[52:51] sharpest tool in the shed or whatever
[52:52] you want to say
[52:53] in the tool bag but lord don't
[52:57] let me miss it thank you jesus put it
[53:00] right here in my face
[53:01] just blinking right back at me yeah
[53:04] showing amen
[53:05] praise be to god yes so here we're
[53:07] dealing with these things here
[53:10] in romans 13 11 he says and that knowing
[53:12] the time that now
[53:14] it is high time to wake up out of sleep
[53:17] yes amen to really get sober
[53:22] to really see what's out there to really
[53:25] see what we're we've
[53:26] we have been missing as far as
[53:29] dealing with the kingdom of god jesus
[53:32] said what i'll be about my father's
[53:34] business
[53:35] have we've been about the father's
[53:36] business i know this is simple
[53:37] absolutely
[53:38] but it's the toughest thing to do
[53:42] as i walk through uh where would i go
[53:44] maybe a costco or
[53:46] go on the job site or whatever every day
[53:48] i walk
[53:50] past people who i've never witnessed to
[53:54] and i might only get one instance one
[53:57] thing to say
[53:58] and as the prophet said he says put your
[54:00] plug in for jesus christ
[54:03] but a lot of times we just walk through
[54:04] our daily lives
[54:06] caring about our lives our
[54:09] needs our desires and
[54:12] our worlds look at the
[54:16] we stayed at the hotel last night and
[54:18] you know what the carpet designs are
[54:20] the very design of that car carpet
[54:23] i've actually went to uh i was working
[54:26] at great wolf lodge
[54:28] years and years and years ago and in the
[54:31] children's
[54:32] i was like this the children's casino
[54:35] which is the arcade they're prepping
[54:36] them for casinos
[54:38] let's just be honest lights and machines
[54:41] and winning and
[54:42] that's casinos for children if you would
[54:45] actually i could show you a picture of
[54:46] what that carpet what was hidden in that
[54:48] carpet
[54:49] it was bad it was obvious if you looked
[54:53] at it
[54:54] so i was at this hotel and you know what
[54:56] they are a bunch of
[54:58] eyes looks like i beams everything's i
[55:01] i i i i i
[55:06] self-consumed it's all about me
[55:10] iphones and ipads and night of this and
[55:12] i that and why because it's all about
[55:15] me all right i mean i just walked out
[55:18] there like
[55:18] why are there eyes right here there's
[55:20] just also just eyes everywhere
[55:23] what is that for that's programming who
[55:25] said hey
[55:26] you know i got a good idea maybe i'll
[55:27] just make a carpet with a bunch of eyes
[55:29] [Laughter]
[55:31] no that was planned nothing new under
[55:34] the sun
[55:35] all right amen he says not knowing that
[55:38] now it is the high time to wake on the
[55:40] sea for now
[55:41] he says for now is our salvation nearer
[55:44] than when we
[55:45] believe when i first heard this gospel
[55:49] in 2001 the very end of it i thought by
[55:52] 2012 would be over
[55:54] i would be out of 2012 was a you
[55:55] remember how 2012 was like this big
[55:58] doomsday and just like why 2k
[56:01] was a big doomsday thing and and here we
[56:03] are 10 years or 12 years
[56:05] sorry eight years past that right right
[56:09] he says what the rapture is even closer
[56:12] than when we believe the word of god
[56:15] he says i don't know about you about
[56:17] salvation now we were saved 2000 years
[56:19] ago received we received it back then
[56:21] but
[56:21] you know we became not we had the
[56:23] understanding and knowledge of it now
[56:25] but the very i'm talking salvation i'm
[56:27] talking salvation from what
[56:28] from ourselves salvation from
[56:32] destruction
[56:33] from the great tribulation the rapture
[56:35] that's what we're looking for he said
[56:36] the night is far
[56:37] spent how much darker can it get
[56:42] the day is at hand let us therefore cast
[56:45] all the works
[56:46] off all the works of darkness and let us
[56:49] put on the armor
[56:51] of light the prophet i couldn't find a
[56:55] quote but i read it before the prophet
[56:57] said he says he says he says once
[56:58] she gets on the full armor of god she'll
[57:01] be i'm just paraphrasing but i think she
[57:03] said something like
[57:04] she'll be an invincible army or
[57:05] something like that but we have to have
[57:08] that full
[57:09] army oh i'm sorry armor on
[57:12] and i heard another brother preach and
[57:13] he was saying uh it was probably in the
[57:15] 80s or 90s or however maybe 70s
[57:17] and he's dealing with the lamp stands
[57:19] the matthew 25 the candlesticks
[57:21] the wise had this and the foolish had
[57:22] this
[57:24] he said he said now we might have
[57:26] candlesticks
[57:30] but it said they had to trim the lamps
[57:32] which means they were not
[57:34] burning you know what produces light
[57:38] people just go down their way but then
[57:39] they notice you if they notice you
[57:42] that's because you have a light burning
[57:46] amen when the john the baptist trusts
[57:49] out of the
[57:49] the desert they noticed him because he
[57:54] was because there was a light there why
[57:56] because he was on
[57:57] fire amen amen he was
[58:00] consumed with what god's plan for his
[58:03] life was
[58:04] he was consumed for what winning souls
[58:07] and getting people
[58:08] baptized
[58:09] [Laughter]
[58:11] getting what salvation he was so
[58:14] consumed he was on
[58:16] fire for god how's our lights burning
[58:19] this morning
[58:21] you might be a candlestick but are you
[58:23] set on fire
[58:27] yeah sure
[58:31] he says let us put on the armor of light
[58:35] light we must be burning
[58:37] [Music]
[58:40] consumed by what the spirit of god
[58:42] that's how you produce light
[58:44] let us walk honestly as in the day not
[58:47] in
[58:47] rioting drunkenness not in uh chambering
[58:50] and wontonness but
[58:52] not in strife in an envy amen yes
[58:55] sure he says lay that up for yourselves
[58:57] treasure
[58:59] treasures upon the earth where moth and
[59:00] rust doth corrupt and where thieves
[59:02] break through and steal
[59:04] but lay up yourselves treasures in
[59:05] heaven where neither roth nor death does
[59:08] corrupt and where thieves do not break
[59:10] through nor steal for where your
[59:12] treasures there will your heart be
[59:14] also what do you value the
[59:18] most amen we're kind of just dealing
[59:21] with
[59:22] impulses for where your treasure is
[59:25] there
[59:26] will your heart be also
[59:29] what do you love the most
[59:35] i just somebody just sent me a video on
[59:38] whatsapp
[59:40] and they were saying and he was over in
[59:43] china i believe
[59:44] this minister was over in china and all
[59:48] these chinese there was like
[59:50] uh they were they were they were
[59:52] sneaking bibles in
[59:54] and and the the american was like okay
[59:57] if we could call how long he says
[59:59] what will happen they said we'll
[1:00:00] probably go to the prison for two or
[1:00:01] three years whatever that's that
[1:00:03] and they said how many of you and
[1:00:04] there's like 12. how many of you have
[1:00:06] been in prison
[1:00:06] they're like 10 of them who raise their
[1:00:07] hands and they're still smuggling bibles
[1:00:12] so he was able to smuggle in i think uh
[1:00:15] eight bibles running the eight bibles
[1:00:18] uh one lady was looking at the bible and
[1:00:20] they started reading
[1:00:22] and they turned the picture or to the
[1:00:24] pages there and the woman gave it to the
[1:00:25] woman next to her because she didn't
[1:00:26] have a bible because this woman had
[1:00:28] already memorized the entire chapter
[1:00:32] and the entire meeting that this
[1:00:33] american came to help these you know
[1:00:35] they encourage them
[1:00:36] they said pastor will you pray that we
[1:00:38] get freedoms like america and you know
[1:00:40] what he said
[1:00:40] he said no he told i will not pray that
[1:00:45] prayer
[1:00:46] he says because you know americans
[1:00:49] you know what these bibles that you guys
[1:00:51] have memorized because you only get
[1:00:52] a scripture a piece at a time he says
[1:00:55] our bibles aren't even being read in
[1:00:57] america
[1:00:59] if it's too hot in the church the people
[1:01:01] won't come and they travel
[1:01:02] three days to get to hear this american
[1:01:04] minister
[1:01:05] he says if it's too uncomfortable in the
[1:01:07] church the people won't even come
[1:01:09] he said if they have to drive more than
[1:01:11] an hour they won't even go to church
[1:01:14] he says i will not pray that prayer
[1:01:20] if it's too cold in the church they
[1:01:22] won't come
[1:01:26] hmm how rich are we and we don't even
[1:01:30] know it
[1:01:32] for where your treasure is there will
[1:01:33] your heart be also
[1:01:35] now notice what says here for as a snare
[1:01:38] shall it come upon all than the dwell on
[1:01:41] the face
[1:01:42] of the earth there is a trap set
[1:01:47] this is not fiction
[1:01:50] this is real life this is
[1:01:54] a prophecy of our day
[1:01:57] there is a strap set
[1:02:01] for the entire world and saints of god
[1:02:03] it's about ready to be strong
[1:02:09] he says watch you therefore and pray
[1:02:11] always that you may may be
[1:02:13] counted worthy to escape all these
[1:02:16] things
[1:02:19] that shall come to pass and to stand
[1:02:21] before
[1:02:22] the son of man
[1:02:27] amen now
[1:02:31] and this is where we're probably gonna
[1:02:32] go tonight okay i'm going to hit a
[1:02:34] scripture here
[1:02:35] i'm just going to show you we're dealing
[1:02:36] with trail the serpent impulses okay
[1:02:40] notice what christ says
[1:02:43] woe unto you scribes and pharisees
[1:02:46] hypocrites because you build the tombs
[1:02:49] of the prophets and garners to the
[1:02:50] sepulcultures of the righteous
[1:02:53] and say if we had been in the days of
[1:02:55] our fathers
[1:02:56] notice they are acknowledging that their
[1:02:59] genealogy
[1:03:00] their seedline that they are descendants
[1:03:03] of these people
[1:03:07] that if we had been part days of our
[1:03:09] fathers we would not have been partakers
[1:03:12] with them in the blood
[1:03:13] of the prophets
[1:03:18] so what is that trail look like
[1:03:24] in the natural you could go into the
[1:03:25] wilderness and look for a snake and
[1:03:28] i think brother jesse's taught on how
[1:03:30] sidewinders have certain
[1:03:32] characteristics on their trail and then
[1:03:34] a bow a constrictor and a python have
[1:03:36] certain characteristics on their trail
[1:03:39] but what about those that are still in
[1:03:41] human form
[1:03:43] in original serpent form what would
[1:03:45] their trail look like
[1:03:49] and jesus christ god and flesh says
[1:03:52] here's an identification
[1:03:58] you say if we've been the days of our
[1:03:59] fathers we have not been partakers with
[1:04:01] them in the blood of the prophets
[1:04:04] the one of the things you'll see it
[1:04:07] during the trail
[1:04:08] if you had followed a snake
[1:04:12] in our day and this day or uh
[1:04:15] the real serpents i'll say like that it
[1:04:17] would be a bloody trail
[1:04:23] wherefore be witnesses unto yourselves
[1:04:26] that ye
[1:04:26] are the children of them which killed
[1:04:30] the prophets fill ye up then the measure
[1:04:34] of your fathers
[1:04:37] looks like they haven't killed too many
[1:04:38] people then
[1:04:40] their entire fathers have a bloody
[1:04:42] history
[1:04:43] blood bath blood bath blood bath and
[1:04:46] jesus says
[1:04:47] you're gonna have to you're gonna do
[1:04:48] this exact same thing
[1:04:52] fill you up the measure of your fathers
[1:04:55] and we're gonna go this way probably
[1:04:56] tonight lord willing
[1:04:58] now one thing about snakes that serpent
[1:05:02] they never stop
[1:05:04] growing
[1:05:07] but johnny as big as you got
[1:05:10] you stopped took a long time
[1:05:14] and you went way up there i don't know
[1:05:15] about that height but
[1:05:17] yeah he stopped
[1:05:20] big man it's like my dream
[1:05:26] i i took my nephew out to eat he's 16
[1:05:29] years old he's
[1:05:30] six foot three and i just i just stare
[1:05:32] at it i'm like dude you're like
[1:05:33] everything i wanted to be
[1:05:36] what happened what why me
[1:05:42] but here you know just in science
[1:05:46] snakes never quit growing
[1:05:52] the bible says hell and destruction are
[1:05:54] never full
[1:05:56] they can eat and eat and eat
[1:06:00] and as they get bigger their jaws are
[1:06:02] able to dislocate and swallow greater
[1:06:04] things
[1:06:06] greater amount of portions of whatever
[1:06:08] is before them they want
[1:06:11] so the eyes of man are never satisfied
[1:06:17] he compares it to the eyes of man or
[1:06:20] maybe an eyes of
[1:06:21] the serpent but remember as the prophet
[1:06:24] of god would say this
[1:06:25] is a serpent as well this thing is
[1:06:27] corrupted this has sinned
[1:06:29] dwelling in it
[1:06:33] shiny things always catch our attentions
[1:06:37] you know what i found myself watching on
[1:06:39] youtube lately is
[1:06:41] gold panning sleuthing
[1:06:46] getting in the stream and just looking
[1:06:48] for gold
[1:06:51] because to me it's it i don't know it's
[1:06:53] catchy to me i don't know why i don't
[1:06:54] know
[1:06:54] it's i like to find things that's kind
[1:06:57] of one thing i really like the word of
[1:06:59] god because
[1:06:59] things open up and you see things
[1:07:03] and the lord shows you i don't even
[1:07:04] actually i don't have nothing to do with
[1:07:05] it the lord just opens it up
[1:07:07] and shows you things and gives you a
[1:07:09] nugget of the word of god
[1:07:11] that you had never seen before but
[1:07:13] notice he a lot of times he waits for
[1:07:15] you to go
[1:07:15] looking and you take a word walk through
[1:07:18] genesis and you're like walking through
[1:07:20] genesis and you're like oh
[1:07:22] there it is and the lord will open up a
[1:07:24] completely new revelation
[1:07:26] or a different angle you've never seen
[1:07:27] that scripture
[1:07:29] that's gold hunting right there in the
[1:07:32] water of the word and
[1:07:33] the wider word comes down you're panning
[1:07:34] through that wire of the word and boom a
[1:07:36] little gold nugget hits me hey that's a
[1:07:37] nice little chunk there i'm gonna share
[1:07:39] that
[1:07:40] that's for me god gave that to me he
[1:07:42] allowed me to get in them little
[1:07:43] fields there and that little stream of
[1:07:45] the word and then here it comes
[1:07:47] amen so snakes never stop growing
[1:07:54] now look here in habakkuk uh two and two
[1:07:58] through five he says and the lord
[1:07:59] answered me and said write the vision
[1:08:01] and make it plain upon tables
[1:08:03] that he may run that readeth it
[1:08:06] for the vision is yet for an appointed
[1:08:08] time but at the end it shall speak in
[1:08:10] that lie terry it
[1:08:11] uh there there though it terry wait for
[1:08:13] it because it will surely
[1:08:15] it surely will come it will not tarry
[1:08:18] behold his soul which is lifted up is
[1:08:20] not of right
[1:08:21] in him but the just shall live by his
[1:08:24] faith yea also because
[1:08:27] he transgresseth by wine
[1:08:31] too much indulging you can even think
[1:08:35] spiritually
[1:08:36] too much spiritual revelation always
[1:08:38] majoring on revelation
[1:08:39] he is a proud man neither keepeth at
[1:08:42] home who enlarges his desire as hell
[1:08:46] and is as death and cannot be satisfied
[1:08:50] but gathereth unto him all nations and
[1:08:52] he with unto him
[1:08:53] all people these men want more
[1:08:57] and more publicity publicity more fame
[1:09:00] more fortune they want more and more
[1:09:02] underneath them
[1:09:06] if you look another scripture he's
[1:09:07] talking about pastors it ties right in
[1:09:09] with this
[1:09:10] shepherds
[1:09:15] now as i was uh down i was at the my
[1:09:18] little
[1:09:18] the river i lived to uh about a month
[1:09:21] ago with my little
[1:09:22] my nephews are benign elijah and brielle
[1:09:24] and micah
[1:09:25] and we're looking in the river there and
[1:09:29] and i spotted something i said but i
[1:09:30] checked that out i took a little stick i
[1:09:32] found and i
[1:09:32] reached it out you know what it was it
[1:09:34] was a snakeskin
[1:09:37] because why snakes never stop growing
[1:09:41] and when they grow further they shed
[1:09:43] their housing they have
[1:09:45] and continue on to grow further and they
[1:09:47] leave that housing
[1:09:48] behind them and why is it
[1:09:52] if you notice these big maggot churches
[1:09:57] building million dollar churches
[1:10:00] 10 million 20 million dollar churches
[1:10:04] they're growing and growing and
[1:10:07] growing they want more
[1:10:11] and more members
[1:10:16] he says if we believe the coming messiah
[1:10:20] is at hand i think we ought to lay aside
[1:10:22] everything else and be concerned of
[1:10:24] getting this message to the land's
[1:10:26] yonder as fast as you can do it that's
[1:10:28] right
[1:10:29] if we are convinced but we preach
[1:10:31] there's a coming messiah
[1:10:33] and wants to put a hundred million
[1:10:34] dollars in a building and if the messiah
[1:10:36] is coming what what good that going to
[1:10:37] do
[1:10:39] sure absolutely now this is 50 60 years
[1:10:42] past now we're at beyond
[1:10:44] this but i'll tell you what if you
[1:10:45] preach the true word of god your church
[1:10:47] cannot
[1:10:48] will not be thousands and thousands and
[1:10:51] thousands and thousands of people
[1:10:52] except maybe like in africa or wherever
[1:10:54] they have huge gatherings and those sort
[1:10:56] of things
[1:10:56] uh say that's in the word of god and the
[1:10:58] message
[1:11:00] but as this thing gets closer and closer
[1:11:02] to the top
[1:11:03] of that pyramid what it'll be the
[1:11:05] prophet said it'll be a razor honed
[1:11:07] sharp and think about this
[1:11:12] as i was listening there in the days of
[1:11:14] noah it said
[1:11:15] eight souls were saved
[1:11:20] eight if i had
[1:11:26] eight million dollars in ones stacked in
[1:11:29] this room
[1:11:31] and i picked eight of those and that was
[1:11:34] all we could spend
[1:11:36] and that would be a waste so
[1:11:40] few think about i mean so few people
[1:11:42] will be saved in this thing
[1:11:45] eight out of a million and that was as
[1:11:47] the prophet said that was the
[1:11:49] tribulation saints the rapture was
[1:11:52] one in eight million one
[1:11:55] in eight million
[1:11:59] now remember who came up with that that
[1:12:01] was jesus as it was in the days of noah
[1:12:04] as in the days of lot that was not a
[1:12:07] theologian that was not a
[1:12:09] a man-aged thought that it went out of
[1:12:12] no that was jesus saying jesus literally
[1:12:14] said
[1:12:15] as in the days of noah
[1:12:18] eight people were saved in
[1:12:21] one type of the rapture
[1:12:27] and it fell in your laps to god gave you
[1:12:30] the engagement ring
[1:12:34] he chose and elected you
[1:12:38] to hear this word
[1:12:42] that is not a light thing
[1:12:45] we must hold dear to these to these to
[1:12:47] the truth
[1:12:49] is the word of god doctrine yes it is
[1:12:51] but it's also the holy ghost
[1:12:53] it's most the major is the holy ghost
[1:12:55] the doctors are wonderful sisters
[1:12:57] dressed the way they did
[1:12:58] hair the brothers address our conduct
[1:12:59] ourselves a certain way those things are
[1:13:01] good and those things are
[1:13:02] right but we know the holy ghost is the
[1:13:04] only thing that matters
[1:13:06] the eternal life the prophet
[1:13:10] and demonology you can be completely
[1:13:12] insane and still have the baptism of the
[1:13:13] holy ghost
[1:13:14] in your soul
[1:13:18] so if someone's insane they're probably
[1:13:20] not living right they're not dressing
[1:13:21] right they're not thinking right because
[1:13:23] what they're insane
[1:13:24] but if they have the presence of the god
[1:13:27] or that seal of god in their life
[1:13:28] they're gonna make that rapture somehow
[1:13:32] talk about a mystery talk about a
[1:13:34] paradox
[1:13:36] talk about what
[1:13:40] talk about trying to compare yourself
[1:13:41] like
[1:13:43] but that's the word of god jesus christ
[1:13:46] does as he pleases
[1:13:50] why because this is his story he can do
[1:13:52] whatever he wants he's in full control
[1:13:55] amen
[1:13:55] amen praise god now
[1:13:59] look what he said jesus now we are so
[1:14:01] smart intellectual in our churches too
[1:14:02] we can build a million dollar building
[1:14:04] or 10 million
[1:14:05] building and yet uh they're trying to
[1:14:06] build one better than the methodist the
[1:14:07] baptist one
[1:14:08] uh build one better than the
[1:14:09] presbyterian the pentecostals got in the
[1:14:11] raised rat race too absolutely
[1:14:13] he says but the thing is is it as we yet
[1:14:16] we are so smart and set on our ways
[1:14:18] until we fail to humble ourselves uh to
[1:14:22] recognize the god
[1:14:23] the god that's in the little mission on
[1:14:25] the corner see that's right
[1:14:27] well that's just we just stumble in
[1:14:29] simplicity we've always done it
[1:14:31] yes i wonder
[1:14:36] and i've heard things
[1:14:39] brother jesse's congregations kind of
[1:14:41] small
[1:14:44] well for jess maybe when god starts
[1:14:46] blessing you
[1:14:49] maybe you know
[1:14:53] maybe god's right here
[1:14:58] amen maybe the lord is speaking to you
[1:15:01] every wednesday and every sunday
[1:15:04] amen maybe the very presence of the
[1:15:06] logos
[1:15:07] is right here in this room amen and to
[1:15:10] even in the big message
[1:15:11] rankings if you will they totally
[1:15:14] overlook it
[1:15:18] god's in the small things amen
[1:15:22] amen sure now
[1:15:26] dealing with impulses
[1:15:31] the trail of the serpent here look at
[1:15:34] cain
[1:15:37] saints of god i i i'm teaching these
[1:15:39] things because i i heard
[1:15:40] i heard something on it and it so shook
[1:15:42] me
[1:15:44] because saints of god are our flesh is
[1:15:46] so frail
[1:15:50] and even though you may have the holy
[1:15:52] ghost in here the seal of the holy ghost
[1:15:57] when this fails
[1:16:00] we still have to answer for we're
[1:16:04] actually in
[1:16:04] we are supposed to be in charge of this
[1:16:06] vessel
[1:16:08] we've got to keep our temples clean
[1:16:12] i mean we've heard it for how many years
[1:16:15] we hear
[1:16:16] time and time and time we've got to keep
[1:16:17] keep keep keeping the word stay in the
[1:16:19] word saying the word what because
[1:16:21] this we've got to keep this in line if
[1:16:23] we have the seal of the holy ghost there
[1:16:25] is absolutely no
[1:16:25] sin in our soul we are sinless in the
[1:16:28] soul
[1:16:30] absolutely why because our desires we
[1:16:32] have we
[1:16:33] we don't want to do anything wrong right
[1:16:35] here
[1:16:36] deep down to the deepest point of view
[1:16:38] in the soul if you're holding us you
[1:16:40] don't want to do
[1:16:41] anything wrong but we're
[1:16:44] we have not just one realm saints we
[1:16:46] have three realms
[1:16:48] yes sir and the other two are defiled
[1:16:52] yes yes
[1:16:55] but those other two defile realms
[1:17:00] people be lost because of those two
[1:17:02] realms yes sir
[1:17:04] what happened to kate right here he saw
[1:17:07] his brother
[1:17:08] offer and worship and bring the right
[1:17:10] sacrifice and god came down and some
[1:17:12] i don't even know exactly if the prophet
[1:17:14] even said however but god vindicated
[1:17:16] that this was right
[1:17:17] yes and cain
[1:17:21] saw it cain realized it and the bible
[1:17:24] said he was wrong
[1:17:25] he was upset so instantly there was this
[1:17:29] anger rose up
[1:17:33] i worked and i worked
[1:17:36] and i worked god
[1:17:40] his anger was towards god and evil
[1:17:44] and i worked for him and he wouldn't
[1:17:47] accept it
[1:17:48] i put all my sweat and labor
[1:17:53] for an entire growing season
[1:17:56] and i brought the best fruits the most
[1:17:59] beautiful the colors they all
[1:18:01] complimented one another and i set it on
[1:18:03] the altar in a range in a certain kind
[1:18:05] of way
[1:18:07] god wouldn't accept it and he accepted
[1:18:09] my lazy brother
[1:18:14] and instantly there was the anger
[1:18:18] that little impossible
[1:18:22] anger fleshly
[1:18:26] [Laughter]
[1:18:32] now one time my life have i lost my
[1:18:35] temper
[1:18:37] i've lit and i feel bad my wife had to
[1:18:40] see it
[1:18:41] she saw a raging maniac it was my 33rd
[1:18:45] year and
[1:18:45] if for some reason in our church when it
[1:18:48] hits 33
[1:18:49] everybody has that year because brooks
[1:18:52] had it
[1:18:53] many saints of god but i know when they
[1:18:54] heard 33 it was their roughest year of
[1:18:56] their life and it literally was
[1:18:58] the roughest year and saints of god when
[1:19:02] a certain thing happened the house and i
[1:19:05] was just having an average day
[1:19:07] but through that year i got pummeled
[1:19:10] hammered with this thing and this thing
[1:19:12] and this thing and that thing and
[1:19:14] everything was building up the pressure
[1:19:15] was so high i got home from work and i
[1:19:17] was just and then my dog
[1:19:19] did a certain thing and i just went my
[1:19:22] vision went like this literally
[1:19:24] and went red
[1:19:28] and i grabbed that dog with my he was
[1:19:30] probably she was 60
[1:19:31] 60 pounds on that i grabbed that dog by
[1:19:34] the neck right here
[1:19:35] and i started banging i lift that dog up
[1:19:38] just like this
[1:19:40] i'm five foot three and a half and i'd
[1:19:41] grab that dog and i started banging her
[1:19:43] on the floor
[1:19:44] i was gonna kill the dog
[1:19:47] and then i come to myself after about
[1:19:48] five minutes
[1:19:50] and i had a tremendous headache for
[1:19:52] three days
[1:19:55] never lost my temper before
[1:19:58] the saints of god in that impulse of
[1:20:01] rage you can't kill somebody
[1:20:04] right right and i believe i received the
[1:20:07] holy ghost
[1:20:08] years before then but when the pressure
[1:20:11] builds on this was there any pressure in
[1:20:13] my soul
[1:20:14] no it was all my flesh in the spirit
[1:20:16] realm yes
[1:20:17] and that impulse of anger
[1:20:22] from pressure from pressure that's
[1:20:25] coming
[1:20:26] too right it triggered that
[1:20:30] and i lost control i lost control of
[1:20:33] this vessel
[1:20:34] literally that's not me
[1:20:38] i'm not a i've never been in a fight
[1:20:40] before
[1:20:45] but a little impulse something
[1:20:48] clicked just right or just wrong
[1:20:53] and the same thing took place with cain
[1:20:58] god came down and met king said hey
[1:21:02] this is the right way what made what
[1:21:05] made you accept ables
[1:21:06] and then god broke it down so just do
[1:21:08] what he did he revealed it
[1:21:11] opened up the mystery
[1:21:14] king's like
[1:21:18] goes and starts talking to abel and
[1:21:20] maybe abel just said one little thing
[1:21:22] hey all you got to do is what i
[1:21:26] did vision goes red
[1:21:29] and he kills his brother right because
[1:21:32] of a little impulse of
[1:21:34] anger of rejection
[1:21:38] god rejected him but god had every right
[1:21:41] to reject him because he did not do
[1:21:43] things that were right and then god came
[1:21:46] and told him
[1:21:47] the right way of doing it that's right
[1:21:50] but one little impulse
[1:21:59] to me this just is just
[1:22:04] it's terrifying because saints of god
[1:22:08] we are coming to a place where we lose
[1:22:10] we will all our privilege will be lost
[1:22:13] yes and we're going to see things
[1:22:17] we thought we'd never see before we're
[1:22:20] going to experience things
[1:22:21] we've never experienced before in this
[1:22:24] fresh carnal
[1:22:25] realm and we had better
[1:22:28] god help us off to pray up amen
[1:22:31] because if we have the mind of god if we
[1:22:33] have the literal mind of god
[1:22:36] whatever happens it's the lord's will
[1:22:40] and your heart will always be beating
[1:22:42] and pulsating for jesus christ
[1:22:45] if if this thing happens over here well
[1:22:47] praise be to god the lord giveth the
[1:22:49] lord take it blessed be the name of the
[1:22:50] lord
[1:22:53] but we must be impulsing proceeding from
[1:22:56] the soul realm
[1:22:58] with his life his decisions his mindset
[1:23:01] amen amen
[1:23:05] cain that one little impulse grew all
[1:23:07] the way to murder
[1:23:09] yes who's the next one
[1:23:12] esau out hunting
[1:23:15] all day trying to track
[1:23:19] old mossy horns
[1:23:22] or the big buck man like my nephew
[1:23:28] looking for all the mossy horns or and
[1:23:30] we stay in liberty center
[1:23:31] they got the mysterious buck now they
[1:23:33] call them mold hickory
[1:23:35] they always have to name this like 28
[1:23:37] 000 point buck and they just
[1:23:39] you know everybody's telling legends and
[1:23:40] urban stories and they try and do
[1:23:42] sketches and this is game no i'll tell
[1:23:44] you that
[1:23:44] anyway esau hunting whatever he was
[1:23:48] hunting
[1:23:49] he was there all day how many have went
[1:23:51] fasting how many have fasted for more
[1:23:53] than a day before
[1:23:54] yeah absolutely sure esau hunted
[1:23:59] come back come to his brother's tent
[1:24:04] so hungry
[1:24:08] he still walks in hey brother
[1:24:11] wow you've got some food here and i'm
[1:24:13] sure the tent of
[1:24:15] uh jacob was just culminating with earth
[1:24:18] what's that era
[1:24:20] aromatics of savory meats and
[1:24:23] killed the padded whatever he had
[1:24:27] everything going that
[1:24:28] right that day and god set it up
[1:24:33] esau goes says hey give me some of that
[1:24:38] and jacob finds an opportunity he says
[1:24:42] i'll tell you what i'll give you the
[1:24:43] biggest
[1:24:43] mole you want if you give me sell me
[1:24:46] your birthright we'll trade it
[1:24:48] this bowl of food this bowl of
[1:24:51] food for your
[1:24:56] hunger what did
[1:24:58] esau do i'll probably be dead
[1:25:01] within a moment's notice of so what's
[1:25:04] that going to mean
[1:25:05] thank you god you know how much how long
[1:25:08] the human body can go without food
[1:25:11] i've heard records or accounts of people
[1:25:13] being lost in
[1:25:14] australia for 40 days without food and
[1:25:17] 10 of them without water and
[1:25:19] miraculously they made it
[1:25:23] but esau was so carnal he was so used to
[1:25:26] having his belly filled
[1:25:29] yeah he was so used to eating just
[1:25:31] whenever he wanted to and
[1:25:33] never had to how many of us have missed
[1:25:35] a meal
[1:25:37] and really i mean like poor like you're
[1:25:40] so poor and
[1:25:42] mama you know we've been close probably
[1:25:46] at our house a couple times
[1:25:48] we always had milk so we always found
[1:25:49] some milk and filled the fill the edge
[1:25:51] well i did
[1:25:55] or whatever you know water maybe with
[1:25:57] sugar in it but
[1:25:59] here esau was so hungry that impulse
[1:26:04] he's looking at that food
[1:26:08] and he's so hungry maybe he just
[1:26:11] should have just went home and got some
[1:26:13] of his probably dried meat
[1:26:15] or canned and walked to his mama's house
[1:26:17] or to their tent and whatever got some
[1:26:19] over there
[1:26:22] i'm sure they all dwelt within the same
[1:26:23] location relatively close
[1:26:26] but because he was so hungry
[1:26:29] he sold out
[1:26:33] he sold out for food
[1:26:37] saints of god what happens when they
[1:26:38] shut down your debit card
[1:26:41] your bank account right right you go for
[1:26:44] a day
[1:26:45] okay i'm hungry you know you look at
[1:26:48] your shelves and start going through
[1:26:49] your
[1:26:49] lazy susan pull out a couple of this and
[1:26:52] cans
[1:26:52] and it goes for a week and now the
[1:26:55] children are looking at your husband's
[1:26:56] like
[1:26:59] [Music]
[1:27:02] and it goes for another week how long is
[1:27:05] lord going to test us for
[1:27:09] and we start getting famished
[1:27:12] we get so hungry
[1:27:17] and google is filled with just come and
[1:27:19] join up we have food
[1:27:21] food banks but you gotta you gotta join
[1:27:24] up food banks by the baptist food banks
[1:27:26] by the catholic
[1:27:27] food banks by message
[1:27:32] will we sell out for some food
[1:27:37] no we jesus christ
[1:27:41] i saw a quote i cannot find it but i did
[1:27:43] see it back in the early 50s
[1:27:46] the ramp said he said jesus christ is
[1:27:48] going to feed
[1:27:50] his children just like he did with moses
[1:27:56] when we have to take flight and go out
[1:28:00] to the woods in the wilderness jesus
[1:28:01] christ is going to feed us
[1:28:07] have you ever thought that maybe if we
[1:28:09] get hungry
[1:28:10] you know jesus said i am the bread of
[1:28:12] life
[1:28:13] and if jesus is the bread of life then
[1:28:15] he's the word of life
[1:28:18] i wonder if maybe if we ever got real
[1:28:19] hungry and this and that if we just read
[1:28:21] the bible could
[1:28:22] fill us up
[1:28:27] what's the difference between that mana
[1:28:32] and this man one's in word form
[1:28:36] one's in these words are spirit
[1:28:42] and life i wonder if these could be just
[1:28:45] as satisfying as a big old
[1:28:49] j alexander's steak
[1:28:52] with macaroni cheese and carrot cake
[1:28:57] absolutely this can't sustain us
[1:29:02] if you have the faith this if reading
[1:29:05] this could fill your bellies
[1:29:10] but esau was so hungry he sold
[1:29:13] out because of a fleshly impulse
[1:29:18] these little things that can rise up
[1:29:19] just real quick you know how it is
[1:29:22] just real quick you can just and then
[1:29:23] you're on that trail
[1:29:26] you your whole mind is i'm going i'm
[1:29:28] going to do this
[1:29:30] it can just happen just like that we
[1:29:32] have to have we have to have this thing
[1:29:34] under subjection
[1:29:36] amen
[1:29:40] he says when thou sittest to eat with
[1:29:42] the ruler consider diligent
[1:29:43] what is before thee and put a knife to
[1:29:45] thy throat if thou be
[1:29:46] a man given to appetite
[1:29:51] be not desirous of his dainties for they
[1:29:52] are all they are
[1:29:54] deceitful meat
[1:29:58] now notice he says but ye are a chosen
[1:30:00] generation a royal priesthood
[1:30:02] a holy nation a peculiar people that ye
[1:30:04] should shoot forth the praises of him
[1:30:07] who has called you out of darkness into
[1:30:09] his marvelous light
[1:30:10] which in times past were not a people
[1:30:12] but now are now
[1:30:13] the people of god which had not obtained
[1:30:16] mercy but are now have obtained mercy
[1:30:18] dearly beloved
[1:30:19] i beseech you as strange as the pilgrims
[1:30:21] abstain from fleshly lust
[1:30:23] which war against the soul
[1:30:28] cain's flesh betrayed his soul
[1:30:32] his flesh got the best of this this
[1:30:36] designated the soul's destination
[1:30:40] esau let this determine his soul's
[1:30:46] destination
[1:30:50] this has a lot of power
[1:30:53] that's why we need jesus christ the holy
[1:30:56] ghost in our soul
[1:30:57] because that's the greatest power there
[1:30:59] is
[1:31:01] this will override this when time comes
[1:31:04] because what the spirit will rise up on
[1:31:07] the scene against
[1:31:08] anything what the the bible says the
[1:31:09] flood will come in but god will raise up
[1:31:11] a standard amen
[1:31:13] what in the spiritual realm he will do
[1:31:15] his raise again remember
[1:31:16] if he's in here he can rise any time he
[1:31:20] wants
[1:31:21] amen amen since the
[1:31:24] since 63 64 the prophet's off the scene
[1:31:28] and god has even though god has done
[1:31:30] many
[1:31:31] wonderful things he's been pretty silent
[1:31:36] you jump on the internet every
[1:31:38] denominational person is having a dream
[1:31:39] about
[1:31:40] the election and we're at the end of the
[1:31:41] rapture
[1:31:43] i don't know too many people in the
[1:31:44] message having dreams and this and this
[1:31:46] and this
[1:31:50] but if we have the holy ghost within
[1:31:53] there is coming a time
[1:31:55] where he the holy ghost is going to
[1:31:59] just impossible ate out and
[1:32:02] conquer the rest of the two realms he's
[1:32:05] going to do it
[1:32:07] we just have to get in the condition
[1:32:10] when we say lord
[1:32:12] it's time take all these realms every
[1:32:15] portion of this
[1:32:16] house every portion of this vessel lord
[1:32:19] it is yours
[1:32:20] have your will and not my will amen
[1:32:25] but it can happen see number that's why
[1:32:26] the baptism of the holy ghost is so
[1:32:28] important
[1:32:29] because that set that seals the deal if
[1:32:32] you have the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:32:34] he will keep you amen
[1:32:38] what if i did not have the holy ghost
[1:32:40] when i went
[1:32:41] and i was killing that dog that thing
[1:32:44] could have turned on my wife
[1:32:46] it could have turned on whoever i was i
[1:32:48] could have snapped at work
[1:32:50] what's hot you're five foot three yeah
[1:32:55] watch the little guys that's what they
[1:32:57] say even at work they're like you know i
[1:32:59] gotta watch some little guys
[1:33:00] like hey just relax i'm on your team
[1:33:06] what i'm trying to say is that make sure
[1:33:08] we are sealed
[1:33:09] with the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:33:12] because he
[1:33:12] is going to do the work in this age
[1:33:16] you think you think that we're going to
[1:33:17] be able to fast our way and and do this
[1:33:19] and do this kind of work it's going to
[1:33:20] be
[1:33:21] works it's going to be by grace when he
[1:33:24] comes and when it's time to catch his
[1:33:26] bride away his
[1:33:27] bride he will already have his bride in
[1:33:29] condition amen
[1:33:32] absolutely that's a that's a word of
[1:33:33] promise
[1:33:35] but from here to the rapture
[1:33:39] we've really got remember he said watch
[1:33:41] and pray watch what
[1:33:43] just the world i i'm the world is not
[1:33:46] gonna
[1:33:47] this thing will condemn you this thing
[1:33:49] right here will get you in trouble
[1:33:52] now we have to watch the other things
[1:33:54] because that puts pressure and stress on
[1:33:56] this thing
[1:33:57] and on our minds and our hearts
[1:34:01] so watch everything amen
[1:34:05] amen thanks to god let's stay in here
[1:34:07] we're we've been about hour here i don't
[1:34:09] keep you too much here
[1:34:10] i know we got two services
[1:34:15] now look here as we stretch a little bit
[1:34:17] do these little arm circles here
[1:34:19] and whatever you want
[1:34:22] if you look at balaam you know balaam
[1:34:26] his impulse was money he wanted
[1:34:29] riches he wanted wealth
[1:34:33] he was already a man of renown
[1:34:37] they knew he was a minor or false
[1:34:39] prophet or you know a diviner
[1:34:41] witchcraft guy whatever you want to say
[1:34:43] but he could get in the presence of god
[1:34:44] too
[1:34:49] but he wanted that paycheck he wanted
[1:34:50] that money
[1:34:54] notice he bypassed all scriptural
[1:34:56] reasoning
[1:34:58] to get a check
[1:35:01] to get a little extra money
[1:35:06] and he tried to curse the people how
[1:35:07] many times two or three times
[1:35:10] but balaam found out you can't resist
[1:35:13] reverse the blessing of god
[1:35:15] it's irreversible
[1:35:19] so what do you do how did he get israel
[1:35:22] to fall
[1:35:24] the bible says in revelations 2 but i
[1:35:27] have few things against thee because
[1:35:29] thou has
[1:35:30] there them that held a doctrine of
[1:35:31] balaam who taught
[1:35:33] baalik he was a teacher
[1:35:39] of the word of god he knew the correct
[1:35:42] approach you know as our prophet said
[1:35:43] seven of rams and you want to get the
[1:35:45] presence of god who taught
[1:35:47] baylor to cast stumbling block before
[1:35:49] the children of israel
[1:35:51] to eat things sacrificed unto idols and
[1:35:53] to commit fornication we know this is
[1:35:55] baal poor right
[1:35:57] a gathering the prophet said uh in in
[1:36:00] his reiterating and kind of just
[1:36:02] talking about it he says oh he and the
[1:36:04] baalik baylor said hey just come and
[1:36:06] fellowship with us
[1:36:07] come hang out with us in our church in
[1:36:09] our denomination or how are you saying
[1:36:11] our church
[1:36:13] and as the prophet dramatized it the
[1:36:15] israelites said
[1:36:16] well maybe we ought to go you know we're
[1:36:18] supposed to love one another and
[1:36:21] join together and be one as the
[1:36:24] scripture says
[1:36:26] i mean we're supposed to be brothers in
[1:36:28] christ and
[1:36:29] those sort of things but if they would
[1:36:32] have understand what was going on
[1:36:35] remember not all israel went 24 000 went
[1:36:39] and started doing things they should not
[1:36:40] have been doing
[1:36:43] but balaam sold out for money
[1:36:47] much like judas
[1:36:52] anyhow now look what the prophet says
[1:36:54] here what if tonight we could call his
[1:36:57] arch enemy judas iscariot the very name
[1:37:00] judas makes
[1:37:01] us shiver doesn't it to me it frightens
[1:37:05] just to think that uh i've had i'll be
[1:37:08] honest i've had mind battles that i was
[1:37:10] a judas absolutely
[1:37:11] i battled that for from the time i come
[1:37:13] in the masses until it's about 2010
[1:37:15] i battled that but i kept saying well
[1:37:17] where else am i going to go
[1:37:20] i'm not going back with these
[1:37:21] denominational guys being baptized right
[1:37:23] or believing the right god or
[1:37:24] you know those sort of things so i
[1:37:25] battled that and then the lord cured me
[1:37:28] about 2010
[1:37:31] but to think that this could be someone
[1:37:33] you love someone you know
[1:37:34] it's scary it literally will
[1:37:38] send chills down your spine because we
[1:37:41] understand it
[1:37:42] we know the revelation behind it we know
[1:37:44] the severity the seriousness of it
[1:37:50] let's just do it a couple of couple
[1:37:51] scriptures here
[1:37:55] uh one a couple scriptures and then
[1:37:57] we'll be done here
[1:37:59] now look at judas here
[1:38:03] now when jesus was in bethany in the
[1:38:05] house of simon the leper
[1:38:07] there came into a woman heaven unto him
[1:38:09] a woman had an alabaster box a very
[1:38:11] precious ointment and poured it on his
[1:38:13] head and he sat at meat
[1:38:15] as he said i mean and when his disciples
[1:38:17] saw they had
[1:38:18] indignation saying to what purpose is
[1:38:21] this waste
[1:38:24] the disciples are all there this woman
[1:38:26] brings in this alabaster box
[1:38:28] pours it over jesus cleanses jesus
[1:38:29] preparation for what the burial for the
[1:38:31] death right
[1:38:32] and disciples are going do you know how
[1:38:35] much
[1:38:35] money that was do we do you guys even
[1:38:38] know how much
[1:38:39] money that that that cost
[1:38:42] the cost of that
[1:38:46] and the disciples got all stirred and
[1:38:48] upset
[1:38:50] i'm sure it was loud reasoning
[1:38:54] remember 12 guys talking about this 12
[1:38:57] guys
[1:38:59] 12 here and just start saying do you
[1:39:02] know who caused that
[1:39:04] disruption
[1:39:09] verse 3 then took mary a pound of
[1:39:11] ointment and spidered very costly and
[1:39:13] anointed the feet of jesus and wiped his
[1:39:15] hair
[1:39:16] uh his hair with her uh his feet with
[1:39:18] her hair and the house was filled with
[1:39:19] the odor of ointment
[1:39:21] then saith one of his disciples judas
[1:39:23] iscariot simon's son we should betray
[1:39:24] him
[1:39:25] why was not this ointment sold for 300
[1:39:28] pence and given to the poor
[1:39:30] you know who started that argument judas
[1:39:34] because he was not worried about the
[1:39:35] ointment but that money
[1:39:39] so that whole disciple disruption was
[1:39:41] caused by one man he was one man the
[1:39:43] instigator just made one comment
[1:39:45] and that comment anointed anointed
[1:39:47] anointed all the rest
[1:39:48] and now we have a problem in christ in
[1:39:51] fact if you study this
[1:39:52] directly after this and
[1:39:56] judah seeing that money that was lost
[1:39:59] that he could have had it was directly
[1:40:01] after
[1:40:02] this act that he went to the chief
[1:40:03] priests
[1:40:07] look it up on the scriptures directly
[1:40:08] after this
[1:40:11] that little anger hit
[1:40:14] that hatred hit that could have been
[1:40:17] mine
[1:40:20] and they put it on this guy
[1:40:24] just that little impulse that desire for
[1:40:27] money
[1:40:28] and then getting angry about this that
[1:40:29] and then what he just went
[1:40:32] went did what he had to do let's say a
[1:40:36] prayer
[1:40:40] dearly father lord jesus lord we love
[1:40:41] you lord and lord jesus lord you've been
[1:40:44] so gracious so kind to us lord
