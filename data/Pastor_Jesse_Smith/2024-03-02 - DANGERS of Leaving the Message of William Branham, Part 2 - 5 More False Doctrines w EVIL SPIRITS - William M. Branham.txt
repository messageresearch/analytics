TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] no more Bob haired women will enter that City I'll guarantee you that no more short wearing cigarettes smoking horor mongers hores or Liars idolators whatever they was won't enter that City no it all be over sin will be gone nothing to defile its Holiness shall enter there greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to do a part two on the dangers of leaving the bible message that Jesus Christ revealed to his true Prophet The Late William brandham 1909 to 1965 by God's grace in this video we'll cover five more false doctrines that anti- message people often adopt and therefore they adopt evil spirits according to 1 Timothy 4:1 they give heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils but first hi friends my name is Jesse Smith Smith I'm Pastor bride of Christ Fellowship and I defend the Bible revelations that Jesus Christ revealed to his true Prophet William brandham and I also defend The Godly character of brother William brandham before getting into these five more false doctrines I just want to share a scriptural warning for those that have left the message it's found in 2 Peter 2: 14-22 of course the Bible tells us to warn all men in Colossians 1:28 and also 1 Thessalonians 5:14 warn them that are unruly and a lot of these people that leave the message become unruly especially in the area of Pride as we show here by the grace of God but the warning is for those that knew the way of righteousness but then turn from the holy commandment so this is for the people that used to be in the message and have left the message and then live a more sinful life after they've left the message so they would have lived more wholly while following the bible message that that God gave to brother brandham but now they live a sinful life so of course it's not everyone but it's likely many of them by God's grace so it starts off in 2 Peter 2:14 they have eyes full of adultery which we'll get to in a little bit a lot of these people that leave the message now enjoy viewing sinful content and then in verse 14 they beguile unstable Souls we see these anti- message people drawing people away they're deceiving the unstable Souls that were on the message and never became stable through the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then in 2 Peter 25 they have forsaken the right way and gone astray some of them go back into Catholicism some of them don't even serve God anymore some go into churches that have no Holiness standard so they've gone astray and again we're not against the people but we are against the denominational system that Harbors false doctrines and then notice 2 Peter 28 18 they speak great swelling words of vanity many of the leaders of the anti- message movement do this constantly they speak such awful things against brother brandham and those who follow the bible message brother brandham gave us they exalt themselves and then notice they Allure through the lust of the flesh a lot of these people again live a sinful life once they leave the message and so it proves they were tempted by the enemy to leave the message they can go live a s sinful life such as drinking alcohol viewing sinful content living in adultery or non-binary relationships and this is one I see often second Peter 2:19 while they promise them Liberty they themselves are the Servants of corruption and I get these comments often from people that have left the message they say brother Jesse one day you'll be free and leave the message and this is the scripture that the Holy Spirit brings to my memory the people that have left the message are promising people live Liberty but many times they just become servants to corruption servants to sin and I'm thankful I found true Liberty of the Holy Ghost believing the message I used to be a servant of corruption as a Baptist or as a Assembly of God Church member but the message of the hour the bible message has cleaned me from that by the grace of God and the proof of that is in 2 Peter 2:19 for of whom a man is overcome of the same as he brought into bondage a lot of these people that leave the message allow themselves to go into sinful addictions or the bondage of sin and that's what 2 Peter 2:20 says when they were in the message they escaped the pollutions of the world but now they're entangled therein again and overcome and the latter end is worse than the beginning 2 Peter 2:21 says for it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness then after they have known it to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them that's what the message is to me it's the holy commands of the Bible spoken through the Lord Jesus Christ and then through Paul Peter John James brother R is pointing us back to those Bible revelations those holy commandments so we're thankful for the true Liberty of the Holy Ghost now let's get into some more examples of the false doctrines that anti- message people accept the first one is viewing sinful content I've heard numerous people that have left the message say now they can watch sinful TV shows sinful movies like one of the leaders who has his own podcast of the historical research podcast or I call historical rewrite podcast he says he's free now he can watch murder mysteries now he can watch Dracula unless his children watch Dracula movies and then he named movies that were rated R that were on his bucket list to watch and all these movies contain blasphemy against the name of God sexual morality murder and murder is an abomination the sight of God so friends if that's freedom I don't want any part of their freedom the Bible says abstain from all appearance of evil first Thessalonians 5:22 and Psalm 1013 I'll set no Wicked thing before mine eyes I hate the work of them that turn aside it shall not cleave to me so these people that have left the message and now view sinful content they have a spirit of whoredoms because spiritually they're making love to evil spirits they love the drama of the R-rated movies or worse and I'd say another thing I've also heard this one man say he can now listen to ACDC Nirvana and he sees it as an art form rather than a song with the working of devils it's so sad shame on these people for what they've allowed they're allowing sinful content into their lives along with the spirit of whoredoms this might be a perverse Spirit or a seducing Spirit the next sin that anti- message people often manifest is pride of course this is called a hotty spirit in Proverbs 16:18 its height its exaltation its Grandeur arrogance Majesty a lot of people that leave the message get the spirit of Pride the evil spirit of Pride one man in particular I've heard it he lets other people call him a professor like he's a professor of research on the podcast that he goes on this is prideful one man that left the message writes in his own book he said people call call me a walking Bible friends that's a prideful statement these people exalt themselves with such haughtiness they have such excellence and majesty and they act like they've never contradicted themselves of course brother brandom grew in understanding and Revelation but they act like they've had it all right their whole lives they act like none of their family members or friends ever did anything awful of course we know people around brother bram's Ministry have done awful things or did awful things after brother Bram died and left the scene so we see pride manifesting on a lot of these people that left the message Proverbs 26:28 says a flattering mouth worketh ruin and again these people flatter themselves like they're so free they're so much wiser now that they left the message and of course they pridefully exalt themselves like their bereans and they only study the Bible to condemn brother brandham they never get down to True Bible Revelation most of them aren't even preachers I've offered some of these people free copies of my books and they won't even read them or invest time into them and yet I'll listen to many of their podcasts and YouTube videos in order to prove them wrong so it shows they're afraid of the truth yet they exalt themselves in Pride but this is just as the Bible said in 2 Chronicles 13:16 they mock The Messengers of God and despise his words and misuse His prophets until the wrath of God arose against his people to there was no remedy these anti-age people mock brother brandham Yet brother brandham labor hundreds if not thousands of times in prayer lines praying for the sick and The Afflicted traveled to preach the gospel dealt with Sinners to come to the Altar and repent give their hearts to Christ be filled with the Holy Ghost be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and these anti- message people they mock brother random as they deny the Bible verses that brother random pointed us to they add to the Bible they take away from the Bible they call themselves bans and they only parrot the slanderous talking points from the believer the slander website and all the weak research done on that website and the historical rewrite podcast they mock brother Brandon while they engage in sexual immorality and they support nonbinary perversion they mock brother Brandon and call him a plagiarist but brother brandham was not a plagiarist they don't even know the research on the first seal they won't even admit that brother brandham referenced his storan over 20 times during the church ages and brother Ram's main Revelation on the future home was the three works of Grace which Clarence Larin did not teach so moving on to the sixth example these anti- message people teach one work of Grace friends to accept this lie they have to have the spirit of he the seducing spirit and a lying Spirit the Bible gives us at least five examples of people that had to experience the three works of Grace now think about that these anti-age people believe in one work of Grace in other words when little children or young teenagers give their hearts the lord they're supposedly filled with the Holy Ghost any honest person who has an honest Spirit knows that that's not the case these young people these young children have to grow in grace and the knowledge of the Lord and receive the full baptism of the Holy Ghost in their souls but these anti-mage people deny that and they say there's only one work of Grace shame on them they've got the spirit of air they've got a lying Spirit remember the five Bible examples are Peter and Mary we can see how they were saved but they had to be Sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost in Acts chap 2 the Samaritans in Acts chap 8 they were baptized but they hadn't received the Holy Ghost yet so Peter and John had to come lay hands on them acts 10 cornelus and his house they were praying fasting giving alms they knew about Christ but they didn't get the Holy Ghost till Peter came and preached to them and then Acts 19 the Ephesians there were 12 of them they followed Apollos they were Justified and Sanctified but they didn't know about the Holy Ghost until Paul told told them about it Paul laid his hands on them they received the baptism of the Holy Ghost and of course Ezekiel taught the three works of Grace in Ezekiel 36 new heart new spirit my spirit and Friends these people have to have a lying Spirit they deceive Believers into thinking they've already arrived at the spiritual birth when in reality many of these professors of being saved will fail the grace of God and go back into the world because Jesus said few there be that find the narrow road in Matthew 7 many of their converts are false converts with dried dyed confessions their experiences in no way resemble day of Pentecost the book of Acts true baptism of the Holy Ghost experience and remember Jesus Christ said it's a baptism of the Holy Ghost in act chapter 1 verse 5 so these anti- message people reject the true Gospel of Jesus Christ which includes the three works of Grace another example of a false Doctrine is a lying spirit because these anti-mage people they lie about brother brandham so again this one kind of relates to the prideful Spirit but many of these anti-age people are liars brother brandom is not here to defend himself so when they jump to conclusions based on presumptions they are lying they cannot prove many of their claims about brother brandom and I have numerous videos about this and podcasts if you'd like to see that by God's grace they lie about brother brandom supposedly being a plagiarist but brother brandom was there's over 38 differences on the Seven Seals between brother brandham and Lin and Charles T Russell they lie about so many things and again they wouldn't jump to these conclusions if they had an honest spirit so this proves they have a lying Spirit an eighth example is they have shameful repulsive hair lengths that's according to First Corinthians 11 1-16 the Bible said a woman that cuts her hair dishonors her husband or her head of course that dishonors Christ and God as well the word dishonor means dishonorable repulsive and friends the anti- message people will never own up to the fact that God never asked a Godly woman to cut her hair anywhere in the Bible that ought to prove to anybody that these anti- message people are off the word of God but of course they'll just ignore that these women that cut their hair are cutting off God's glory which represents the Holy Spirit according to the book of Isaiah in Isaiah God said my spirit is my covering and then we see long hair is a covering in 1 Corinthians 11 so these women that cut their hair or men that grow their hair out long without cutting it they're repulsive they're shameful and they're rejecting the anointing of the holy spirit in their lives and the last one for this video will be crossdressing recently I put out a video about how brother Brandon was Vindicated to preach against crossdress as Hollywood has had an agenda for many years to get men to crossdress in women's clothing so I'll put a link to that video in the description but of course people that leave the message deny Deuteronomy 225 and they fail to see that the moral law of God in many cases continues in the New Testament I just taught our children about this in our Sunday school and there was over 16 I believe Abominations in the Old Testament that continued in the New Testament and so for for the anti- message people to say women can wear women's pants and men can dress like women they no doubt have a perverse Spirit that's according to Isaiah 19:14 the Lord hath mingled a perverse spirit in the midst thereof perverse means a warping a distorting so these anti- message people are distorting the difference God put between men and women not only in their hair lengths but also in their clothing and again I've told some of these anti- message people go read the book when women in pants by Greg and Smith from 2003 this shows the history of how there was an uproar when women started wearing pants all the way back to the late 1800s but especially during the 20th century or the 1900s but will they read it no because they've got an evil spirit and they will not accept the truth if they would accept the truth then they'd have the spirit of Truth the holy spirit it's never okay for women to wear pants it's never okay for men to wear women's skirts or women men's undergarments in closing friends I hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God this is probably the final video I'll do at least in the short term maybe in the long term I'll do another video but I just want to show these nine simple examples of how anti- message people they leave the Bible teachings of the message and these are true Bible teachings but if they reject that they have to take on these evil spirits because the Bible says they give heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils that's again why I'm so grateful for the Holy Ghost the spirit of Truth like 2 John 1:9 says whosoever abideth not in the doctrine of Christ hath not God these people cannot be born again they cannot have God in their souls because they deny the doctrine of Jesus Christ but he that abideth in the doctrine of Christ hath both the father and the son what a promise church doctrine is so important so is Supernatural works and miracles and the power of God that's also important as well but we can never m major on a minor so again if we have the Holy Ghost it'll guide us into all the truth the truth on Supernatural works the truth on the gifts of God and the truth on Bible Doctrine so let's have a prayer for these people again Heavenly Father we ask God again you be merciful to these people that have left the message whether on the tape worship side or the believe the slander side dear God I just pray God they could find the spirit of Truth they could humble themselves and repent of their doctrines of devils and their seduc ing Spirits oh God open their heart and Minds to the truth of this Bible Lord God may they be true bereans and not just bereans by name only God we thank you for your mercy and Grace help us Lord as message Believers to have continual Humble Hearts searching our hearts Lord God examining ourselves whether we be in the faith and Lord we pray again that these people that have left can return back to the truth if it Be Your Will Lord God have mercy on them and God have mercy on us as well thank you that you're rich in Mercy so we give you all the praise in Jesus Christ's name amen if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your [Music] heart
