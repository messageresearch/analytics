[0:40] god bless you and welcome to defending
[0:42] the message podcast i'm your co-host
[0:44] pastor jesse smith and i am eamon lee
[0:47] we're excited to bring you part three
[0:48] the conclusion to our brother austin
[0:50] laramie's testimony about him receiving
[0:53] the message of the hour
[0:55] at our last podcast we left off where
[0:58] barrow austin went to arizona and that's
[1:00] where we're planning to start on this
[1:01] one can you explain in detail um what
[1:05] happened when you went to arizona and
[1:06] how the lord worked with you in that
[1:08] area
[1:09] yes when i got to arizona it was like a
[1:12] a new beginning for real and uh i just
[1:15] remember
[1:16] getting there and just it's the first
[1:17] time i had been sober for a long time
[1:20] and i just remember like sitting and
[1:24] replaying in my head the last
[1:26] year the actions and everything that i
[1:28] went through and that happened
[1:31] and it was like i just ended up you know
[1:34] being in a very bad depression when i
[1:37] was staying with my grandma and grandpa
[1:38] it was cool you know the first couple
[1:40] days were exciting you know this new
[1:41] start fresh start and i've never been
[1:43] out west before so you know you got the
[1:45] beautiful mountains you know all the
[1:46] palm trees it's a super nice city
[1:49] but then you know i just started
[1:50] thinking really deeply on what happened
[1:53] you know just really messing with me i
[1:54] was just i just gave up everything you
[1:56] know just left everything on a dime
[1:59] so it was like pretty traumatizing
[2:02] so i started my first few weeks out
[2:04] there
[2:05] pretty you know uh optimistic but then
[2:07] uh
[2:08] as everything started to set in you know
[2:10] i just got real depressed and i would uh
[2:13] i would sit in my room literally all day
[2:16] long for hours at a time like i mean
[2:18] days at a time i'll just stay in my room
[2:20] i wouldn't even go out to the living
[2:21] room and talk to my grandparents or
[2:23] nothing
[2:24] you know i just had very bad anxiety too
[2:26] was like just sit in my room and just
[2:28] listen to music instrumentals and try to
[2:30] write lyrics and i would play guitar for
[2:33] hours at a time
[2:35] so my grandma and grandpa they're old
[2:36] school they don't really claim
[2:38] depression and all that they're like you
[2:39] know if you talk about depression like
[2:40] man like you're not depressed like
[2:42] what's depressing like you know you
[2:44] sound corny or whatever you know that's
[2:47] that's the attitude they had towards it
[2:48] so my grandma didn't really get it
[2:51] so i remember we were always getting
[2:53] arguments because she thought i was just
[2:54] being rude you know she's like you came
[2:56] out here you know but you're not even
[2:57] hanging out with us talking to us and
[2:58] i'll just try to explain to her that i
[3:00] was depressed but she wasn't feeling it
[3:02] she's like no you're just you're just
[3:04] rude and you don't really care about us
[3:06] and
[3:06] you know you're just using us you know
[3:08] and
[3:09] and my room would be messy because i
[3:11] literally wouldn't even shower i
[3:12] wouldn't clean my room sometimes i mean
[3:14] it wasn't that messy but for her
[3:16] one jacket on the ground is a wreck i
[3:18] mean but it was more than that though it
[3:19] was kind of messy but
[3:21] but so she would like you know call me
[3:23] lazy so you don't even clean you know
[3:25] nothing you know and and it really
[3:27] wasn't laziness i was just mad if
[3:29] anybody ever went through depression
[3:31] they understand what i'm talking about
[3:32] so
[3:33] it's like you're not yourself so and you
[3:36] have no motivation to do anything like i
[3:38] had no will to live at this point in my
[3:40] life i didn't really care what happened
[3:41] in my life anymore so i remember always
[3:43] bumping heads on my grandma getting
[3:45] really bad arguments at first because
[3:48] she you know she just didn't understand
[3:49] my grandpa kind of did understand he
[3:51] would always tell me i'm not depressed i
[3:53] don't have anxiety that i don't claim it
[3:54] but he understood though he was more
[3:56] compassionate so we we were cool but uh
[3:59] so i just stayed like that pretty much
[4:00] the first year they just stayed in my
[4:02] room and wrote music
[4:03] but then um
[4:05] i got a job ended up getting a job at
[4:06] dollar general you know i started
[4:08] branching out that was like the third
[4:10] month i was there
[4:11] and through
[4:12] that job uh this lady that worked there
[4:15] you know we were talking and she figured
[4:17] out i do music and uh she knew this kid
[4:19] named johnny and he just so happened to
[4:21] make really good music she was telling
[4:22] me his music he was really good he's
[4:24] really talented and he so happened to
[4:26] have a studio so you know i had some
[4:28] songs ready
[4:30] i met him and i started going to the
[4:31] studio a lot just recording music and
[4:33] then like
[4:35] the first time first day i met him we
[4:36] became like instantly cool he was such a
[4:38] cool dude we're still cool to this day
[4:41] so i just we just started recording
[4:43] songs together and just i just spent all
[4:44] my spare time in the studio so that i
[4:47] learned a lot by him i learned how to
[4:48] you know audio engineer you know mixed
[4:51] vocals and all that so
[4:52] it's like you know ordained my god so
[4:54] but i was still depressed through all of
[4:56] this so i was out there probably almost
[4:58] four years
[4:59] in that same state i mean a whole the
[5:00] first whole year i stayed in my room for
[5:03] hours if i wasn't at the studio at work
[5:05] out as soon as i got home and went to my
[5:06] room laid down went to sleep or just
[5:09] writing music all day all day long
[5:11] yelled at by my grandma like you don't
[5:13] care about us you know that
[5:15] it wasn't the case but and then
[5:16] eventually i came back to akron for a
[5:19] couple months i got my friend matt to
[5:21] move out there with me and he started
[5:23] staying at my grandma's with me too
[5:25] and then shortly after we got back my
[5:28] grandpa got diagnosed with hip cancer
[5:31] so that was pretty crazy
[5:33] and i was pretty much in denial of that
[5:36] and he did hospice he he didn't want any
[5:38] treatment he was like i don't even care
[5:39] you know he's like i lived a great life
[5:40] i'm ready to go
[5:42] my grandma's trying to get him to go get
[5:44] treatment he don't want it he's like let
[5:45] me just die so and i was still depressed
[5:48] so i really the sadness didn't really
[5:50] hit me with that too lord i was like
[5:51] just like oh okay you know it's just in
[5:53] denial and we i just i just watched him
[5:56] get weaker and weaker every day you know
[5:57] he used to be so funny and then he just
[6:00] got weaker and weaker and silly until he
[6:01] eventually passed away
[6:03] so that was like a eye-opener you know
[6:05] and it's like i realized you know if i
[6:08] didn't actually go crazy and move to
[6:10] arizona then i probably wouldn't have
[6:12] been able to have a relationship with
[6:14] them because growing up i didn't really
[6:15] see them that much so i didn't really
[6:17] you know last time i saw them before i
[6:19] moved out to the first time was
[6:21] probably when i was still a kid and i
[6:23] moved out there when i was 19
[6:24] or 20 maybe
[6:26] so
[6:27] you know so i didn't know he's gonna get
[6:28] cancer you know uh two years after i
[6:30] moved out there so you know it's i got
[6:32] to get a relationship with him you know
[6:34] and so yeah that happened and then um
[6:36] this was like the the flat line of my
[6:38] whole journey was just pretty stagnant
[6:40] and growth uh i stayed out there once
[6:43] matt was out there with me you know i i
[6:44] was still depressed but i started to at
[6:46] least branch out a little bit more you
[6:47] know i started getting used to my
[6:48] surroundings went to johnny's a lot more
[6:51] i had a couple friends out there and uh
[6:54] yeah and then um i remember like another
[6:56] year goes by you know not much changes
[6:59] i'm still depressed anxious not thinking
[7:01] mind you every day every day i was
[7:03] thinking about the message still felt
[7:05] guilty i'm like oh oh this is pointless
[7:07] i'm doing all this music disappointment
[7:08] i had this dream to be in you know
[7:10] hollywood so i was like this is all
[7:11] pointless every day that's where my
[7:13] anxiety was spawning from because every
[7:14] day i tell myself i'm going to hell i'm
[7:15] like oh man i'm on my way to hell i'm on
[7:17] my way to hell i'm like why am i what is
[7:19] wrong like you know i it's like the
[7:20] message marked me it left a permanent
[7:22] mark inside of me so i was like oh like
[7:24] no matter what i did i couldn't get
[7:25] satisfied so i was just so depressed and
[7:27] anxious i'm like all this is pointless
[7:29] but my goal you know is to get rich and
[7:31] then repent you know but it doesn't work
[7:33] like that and then you know eventually
[7:35] move out and then and then we go out and
[7:38] get his cousin to live with us bring him
[7:40] out here
[7:41] that was december 2019 we got his cousin
[7:45] in so
[7:46] and so 2020 comes you know it's march
[7:48] it's spring break it's like the height
[7:50] of lake havasu i mean everybody's
[7:51] partying so we're out there i remember
[7:54] you know it's like a huge spring break
[7:56] town out this city like all colleges go
[7:58] out there for spring break and a little
[8:01] back story
[8:02] when i was a dollar general like the
[8:04] very first year i worked out there is
[8:06] where i met my current girlfriend lina
[8:08] she would always walk in so dollar
[8:10] general all the time she was new out
[8:12] there like me
[8:14] and i always thought she was really
[8:15] pretty so i was like oh
[8:17] i was like cool i was like finally
[8:18] someone
[8:19] she always used to look at me like me
[8:21] mugged me she was like i didn't think
[8:22] she was into me so i didn't really
[8:24] press the issue at all all i really got
[8:26] was her name that's it her name and
[8:28] that's really it but so i remember
[8:31] she stopped coming in one day and then
[8:32] i'm like huh you know i started thinking
[8:33] like i don't see her anymore and then uh
[8:35] that's when i went back to akron around
[8:37] that time too
[8:38] and then came back out
[8:40] so now we're here we are in 2020 march
[8:44] and i'm walking with matt at spring
[8:46] break
[8:47] you know just in the big crowd
[8:49] and then i see this girl waving at me
[8:51] this this
[8:52] random girl and and i look in matt and
[8:54] i'm like i don't know if this girl is
[8:55] waving at me or not but i don't want to
[8:57] look stupid and and go walk up to her so
[8:59] i'm just going to stand here and she
[9:01] walks up to me so she was like hey my
[9:03] friend is here
[9:05] something like that and now look so she
[9:07] takes me and it's actually lena it's the
[9:09] girl that you know i didn't see any more
[9:11] dollars generally this is like a year
[9:12] and a half later so i see lena finally
[9:14] oh i was like hey what's up you know i
[9:16] said hi and stuff i was like cool to see
[9:17] you know i haven't seen you in a while
[9:19] you know so finally got her number and
[9:21] all that you know after that day
[9:23] you know we just started talking really
[9:25] heavily you know and just really became
[9:28] pretty close and then uh eventually i
[9:30] started working at a resort around this
[9:32] time and that was the job i kept all the
[9:34] way till i came back to akron where i am
[9:36] now but
[9:38] and uh ever since the first time we hung
[9:39] out we hung out every single day since
[9:41] too so it was cool and we eventually
[9:43] started dating
[9:45] and i remember when the pandemic started
[9:47] my grandma i was back at my grandma's at
[9:49] this time and my grandma didn't want me
[9:51] living with her no more because she's in
[9:52] bed she has like a lot of respiratory
[9:54] problems
[9:55] so and we didn't know what it was you
[9:56] know nobody it was when nobody knew what
[9:58] kobe was so i was like i understand so i
[10:00] was homeless but i was just living in
[10:02] hotels or austin when did you feel that
[10:06] to come back while you're over there
[10:09] i remember one day i don't know what
[10:11] spawned it i don't i mean it was
[10:13] probably the pandemic that definitely
[10:15] spawned it because i hate health
[10:16] epidemics like i literally don't like
[10:18] sicknesses
[10:19] but uh you know through dating lena
[10:22] lina showed me that there's still
[10:23] traditional and loyal women out here and
[10:25] like she kind of shocked me and through
[10:27] dating her i kind of like i was still
[10:29] depressed but i started thinking about
[10:31] my future i started wanting a family
[10:32] started wanting kids you know started
[10:34] thinking about being a better person you
[10:36] know elevating myself you know so
[10:39] after coming to this realization that i
[10:41] really like lena i'm like oh man like
[10:43] she's a really
[10:44] really uh a good person you know i was
[10:47] like man she's making me think about all
[10:48] my flaws now you know which i never
[10:50] thought about
[10:51] improving myself sounds like the only
[10:53] way this is going to work is if i
[10:55] introduce her to the message you know so
[10:56] i started thinking about god again at
[10:58] this point i'm literally prepared to
[11:00] break up with her i'm like all right i
[11:02] got to go back to i got to go back to
[11:03] akron eventually i just had this
[11:04] epiphany i need to go back to god i need
[11:07] to go back to akron i've been out here
[11:08] at this point probably three years
[11:10] at this point
[11:11] and it was still stagnant super
[11:13] depressed still sometimes had suicidal
[11:15] thoughts but never once i wanted to act
[11:17] on it no more didn't do drugs anymore i
[11:19] mean i still smoked but i wasn't doing
[11:22] any hard drugs anymore you know it was
[11:23] nothing crazy doing a lot of music like
[11:26] just fell in love with music even more
[11:28] and so i tell her about the message i
[11:31] spent like a whole hour just telling the
[11:32] whole story of what i just told you on
[11:34] the last two podcasts and everything how
[11:37] i met brother jesse and all that and and
[11:39] then at the end of it i'm like what are
[11:40] you thinking she literally just says and
[11:42] i remind you i'm like all right you know
[11:43] she's never left her family before you
[11:45] know she's never even left california
[11:47] she's from california we're in arizona
[11:50] she's never left the state before you
[11:52] know or even let alone been to the east
[11:53] side of the united states and ohio and
[11:56] so i'm you know i'm telling her yeah we
[11:58] got to move we got to go out here you
[11:59] know to this church where she does not
[12:02] gonna know you know this is me telling
[12:03] her about a whole bunch of people she's
[12:05] not gonna know in a place that she's
[12:06] never been
[12:07] and all she says is all right let's do
[12:09] it and i was like what
[12:11] i said that's it
[12:12] that's all you got to say about that so
[12:14] i was like that's cool and she's like
[12:16] yeah let's do it you know she's like i'm
[12:17] down i was like all right
[12:19] cool i was like i was like i was
[12:20] prepared to break up with you if you
[12:21] said no you know i was like i gotta go
[12:23] back i think the things are getting
[12:25] crazy in the world you know i'm tired of
[12:27] being depressed and anxious about dying
[12:29] all the time and going to hell so
[12:32] told her about that
[12:33] shortly after i told lena about the
[12:35] message as anybody was she was wondering
[12:38] if this was the right move i mean this
[12:40] is a big move you know she's gonna leave
[12:41] everything i'm everything behind she's
[12:43] she has no connection out here except
[12:45] for me literally so it's like she was
[12:48] she was wondering you know if this was
[12:49] the right move she was praying
[12:51] and i remember like we were talking
[12:53] about some of my
[12:55] rants about god i probably was
[12:57] mentioning how you know everything this
[12:59] life is really just temporary and this
[13:00] isn't even real life like you know life
[13:02] begins after we're out of our flesh like
[13:05] it's it's really hard to think about but
[13:07] as humans you know it's just that's like
[13:08] a divine thought like that's hard to
[13:10] think about so
[13:12] i remember she was working at goodwill
[13:15] one day she told me this ladies while
[13:16] her she was just working just randomly
[13:19] came up to her that she didn't know at
[13:21] all and the lady was like hey uh god
[13:24] told me to tell you that
[13:26] everything in his life is temporary just
[13:28] live for god you know just you need to
[13:30] live for god
[13:32] and then she was just like god bless you
[13:33] have a good day and then you know that
[13:34] was it
[13:35] and then she said lina told me after she
[13:37] told me that she said that was like the
[13:40] vindicator that this was the right move
[13:42] to make
[13:43] so
[13:44] that was you know that was pretty
[13:45] supernatural so that was a good thing so
[13:48] ever since that time she was fully
[13:51] convinced on this move and obviously the
[13:53] the fruit of this move has been nothing
[13:55] but blessings so it's the right move
[13:57] and a little side note the same time my
[14:00] grandpa died of cancer was the same time
[14:02] her grandma died of cancer as well so
[14:06] that's also another way we bonded and it
[14:08] was it was like supernatural it was so
[14:10] weird because our both our grandparents
[14:12] died of cancer the same like within like
[14:14] the same three months yeah so that was
[14:16] pretty weird too we're both going
[14:18] through the same things
[14:25] also we want to i want you to share
[14:27] about kathy
[14:28] and then um probably a month before we
[14:31] moved to akron
[14:32] i remember i would take these shuttles
[14:34] to work they're like this company that
[14:36] you would pay five bucks because lake
[14:38] havasu is kind of a small city and you
[14:40] pay five bucks and they'll just give you
[14:41] a ride anywhere you know it's called day
[14:42] and night shuttle i would i took them so
[14:45] much i was cool with like everybody that
[14:46] worked there they all knew me you know
[14:48] so
[14:49] i remember the the owner
[14:51] her name was kathy
[14:53] the owner of it she came down with kovid
[14:55] and uh within literally her first week
[14:57] of getting coveted she was already in
[14:59] the hospital because she's had kidney
[15:00] transplants so she has underlying
[15:02] problems and uh within a week she was
[15:05] already in a coma and within two to
[15:07] three weeks she was in total organ
[15:09] failure
[15:10] and they were literally the doctors were
[15:12] already literally basically telling the
[15:13] family yeah you guys need to pull the
[15:15] plug on her you know she's not going to
[15:16] live
[15:17] you know there's no way she's going to
[15:18] live anymore she's in total organ
[15:20] failure you know everything's failed
[15:23] there's there's no chance of life
[15:24] anymore at this point so and carol was
[15:27] like her best friend she works for the
[15:29] shuttle
[15:30] and i remember lena and i were getting a
[15:32] ride home one night from carol and we
[15:34] get in our driveway and she just starts
[15:36] breaking down crying
[15:37] you know like breaking down and she just
[15:40] starts apologizing you know she's like
[15:42] i'm so sorry you know i'm just this has
[15:44] really been a lot on me and i'm like you
[15:45] know it's okay and like
[15:47] now that i thought about it you know
[15:49] since i had left akron i probably
[15:51] haven't prayed one time like i didn't
[15:53] pray one time the whole
[15:54] four years i was in arizona not once i
[15:56] didn't pray one time there wasn't a
[15:58] single time i prayed
[16:00] but all of a sudden like while she was
[16:02] crying i just felt this like
[16:03] overwhelming sense
[16:05] or need to need i needed to pray like i
[16:08] like like it was like a i don't know how
[16:10] to explain it it was like i just needed
[16:12] to pray like it was like pray pray right
[16:13] now pray right now you need to pray
[16:14] right now like in my head so so i looked
[16:16] up at carol with this boldness i was
[16:18] like do you believe in god and she was
[16:20] like yeah i was like all right well
[16:22] let's pray and i just prayed this crazy
[16:24] strong prayer for kathy i don't even
[16:26] remember what i said but i just know it
[16:28] was a strong super sincere prayer i was
[16:30] just praying like i haven't played
[16:31] prayed in four years you know like
[16:34] and then that was that we i said amen
[16:36] you know she's like thank you i needed
[16:37] that i was like you're welcome you know
[16:38] i was like it's gonna be all right
[16:40] and then uh i don't know how long it was
[16:42] maybe it was the next morning but i had
[16:44] a dream
[16:45] a crazy dream
[16:46] one of the most vivid dreams i've ever
[16:48] had in my life like it was like i was
[16:49] really there like it was like
[16:52] how if you if you're looking with your
[16:54] eyes it was that real like the the the
[16:56] world we see right now is as real as
[16:58] that i don't know how to describe it
[17:00] never had a dream that real
[17:01] and after i woke up i forgot that dream
[17:05] and
[17:06] what the dream was
[17:08] was uh
[17:09] it was like everything was all black and
[17:12] it was lit up all i saw was kathy in the
[17:14] hospital bed and i saw carol standing
[17:17] over her and it was like i was looking
[17:19] at them in real time i don't know how to
[17:20] describe it it was like real time
[17:22] and i was just with them and carol just
[17:25] looked over at me and she said austin
[17:27] it's all right kathy's gonna be healed
[17:30] she's gonna be all right and then that
[17:32] was the dream that was a dream and i it
[17:34] was like i was really there i could
[17:35] literally see them i could hear the
[17:37] monitors of the
[17:38] the hospital
[17:40] you know machines i could hear her
[17:41] breathing i could i could i could see it
[17:43] all like it was so vivid like i was
[17:45] literally with them then i woke up i
[17:47] forgot the dream though
[17:49] so i woke up went about my day
[17:52] and you know
[17:53] me knowing i'm about to make this move
[17:55] and start going to church i started
[17:56] watching sermons again you know
[17:58] on youtube you could watch all brothers
[18:00] yesterday's sermons all our churches
[18:01] sermons on youtube and i was watching it
[18:04] it was about joshua
[18:05] it was uh the sermon was about the
[18:07] particular one i was watching he had
[18:09] said something like sometimes god will
[18:12] use us as a vessel and speak through us
[18:14] it was something like that you know god
[18:16] will just use us to say something in a
[18:18] time of need or pray or something you
[18:20] know so he'll use us like that and as
[18:22] soon as he said that the dream came back
[18:25] to me and i remember the dream
[18:27] i was like oh
[18:28] and as soon as i remember the dream i
[18:30] stopped the sermon i went straight to
[18:32] lean all day leaning i was like you
[18:33] gotta listen to this i had this dream
[18:34] this morning that i forgot i had
[18:37] and i told her the dream and she was
[18:38] like wow okay you know i was like i was
[18:40] like i wonder if this is god you know
[18:42] what if it's god so you know the next
[18:44] and then i went to sleep on that the
[18:46] next morning you know i woke up i had to
[18:49] work later that day so i was or i called
[18:51] day and night i asked for a ride to work
[18:54] like usual
[18:55] and then um i was watching a sermon like
[18:57] 30 minutes prior to that and then i and
[18:59] then i prayed i was like all right god i
[19:01] was like if this is you
[19:03] if this if that dream was true and it
[19:04] was you
[19:05] i was like send me a sign
[19:07] and the way god speaks to me he always
[19:09] uses my surroundings i don't i don't
[19:11] know how to explain it i'll go into it
[19:13] another time but he uses my surroundings
[19:15] to speak to me i mean it make it but
[19:16] it's so obvious it's not like oh that's
[19:18] a coincidence i mean it's something so
[19:20] obvious that it's like you can't deny it
[19:22] and then um so i'm just asking him for a
[19:25] sign i'm like lord just give me a sign
[19:26] you know day night comes i get in the
[19:28] car it is carol you know carol's the
[19:30] driver i was like yes so
[19:32] we're driving you know you know i told
[19:34] her about the dream you know and she's
[19:35] like oh wow that's pretty cool you know
[19:37] and she didn't really you know take
[19:38] anything of it though she's like wow you
[19:40] know she was like that'd be great but
[19:42] she you know i mean the doctors are
[19:43] saying you know pull the plug there's no
[19:45] more chance she's she's dead she's done
[19:47] so you know you got that in your ear and
[19:48] then you got some random kids saying oh
[19:50] i had a dream about kathy being all
[19:51] right so
[19:53] then i remember she was talking and we
[19:54] were on the highway
[19:56] and in the middle of her talking i was
[19:58] like wait carol hold on hold on wait i
[19:59] was like i was like uh uh i was like
[20:01] don't talk for a second i was like i
[20:03] said turn up the song so she turned up
[20:04] the song and there was a song playing
[20:07] and the song was literally like it was
[20:08] the chorus or something i don't know but
[20:10] it was literally saying send me a sweet
[20:12] dream
[20:13] like it was like send me a dream like
[20:15] over and over it was just saying that
[20:16] over and over send me a sweet dream like
[20:19] over and over and i just got chills i'm
[20:20] like oh i was like carol what were we
[20:23] just talking about she was a dream i was
[20:24] like do you hear this song right now and
[20:26] she was like oh she started laughing
[20:27] she's like wow she was like that's crazy
[20:30] and from that moment i told her i was
[20:31] like carol i was like kathy's gonna be
[20:33] all right she's gonna come out of this
[20:34] and she was like i really hope so
[20:36] you know and then it was like three
[20:37] weeks later
[20:39] i'm talking to carol and carol was
[20:40] talking she's like hey uh kathy you know
[20:43] her organs are starting to function
[20:44] again and
[20:45] you know and then another week later hey
[20:48] kathy came out of a coma and she can't
[20:50] really talk right now but she's you know
[20:52] she's sewing signs of progression and
[20:53] then like uh two months later she was
[20:55] fully healed out the hospital walking
[20:57] and that was that and then so
[20:59] that i don't that was crazy you know and
[21:02] then carol was just shocked because she
[21:04] told me she was like you know when you
[21:06] when you prayed and when you when you
[21:07] told me about that dream she was like i
[21:08] didn't believe you she was i i didn't
[21:11] believe you but she was like i can't
[21:12] explain that she was like that's crazy
[21:13] that that happened
[21:15] i was like man and she was like you were
[21:17] just so confident that she was gonna be
[21:18] all right i was like yeah it was a god
[21:20] you know god gave me a dream told me she
[21:22] was gonna be healed so that's what
[21:24] happened right before i came out to
[21:26] akron i was like a month before i came
[21:27] out to akron yeah so that was crazy i've
[21:29] never that's never happened to me before
[21:31] see that dream's almost like prophetic
[21:33] right it foretold something that was
[21:35] gonna happen and that's kind of how we
[21:37] look at dreams as well
[21:38] you know we would say minor gifts of
[21:41] prophecy today or when god gives us
[21:43] dreams and then they come to pass
[21:45] so this looks like a minor
[21:47] prophecy given to our brother and then
[21:48] also the same time some people might
[21:50] even say it was a miracle because she
[21:52] was so close to death doctors were
[21:54] saying pull the plug in a coma
[21:56] and then yet somehow god brings her back
[21:59] to complete health and now she's
[22:01] completely well
[22:02] uh no doubt it's a case of divine
[22:04] healing as well uh some people you might
[22:06] say it's a it's a word of faith
[22:09] you know to overcome this obstacle so
[22:11] there's different different thoughts
[22:12] about it you know as far as which gifts
[22:14] of the holy spirit this was but you can
[22:16] clearly see how god foretold the healing
[22:19] and then that raised your faith and you
[22:21] shared it with others and then god
[22:22] brought it to pass
[22:24] so it's just wonderful to see god move
[22:26] supernaturally in your life
[22:28] and this this will give you guidance
[22:30] about you know what god may want to do
[22:31] with you in the future or it may have
[22:33] been a one-time thing a one-time gift of
[22:34] the holy spirit but clearly you can see
[22:36] god used it as a great encouragement to
[22:38] you while you were even in a backstage
[22:40] condition god was using it
[22:42] to help encourage you as you were on
[22:44] your way back to finally coming back to
[22:46] the house of god repenting overcoming
[22:48] the depression overcome the guilt all
[22:51] those things god uses as a huge
[22:53] encouragement to let you know he was
[22:54] still with you
[22:55] that's exactly what happened at that
[22:57] point i was like oh yeah there's no
[22:58] denial i was like yeah i'm ready to come
[23:00] back you know at that point i was like
[23:01] yeah it's never happened to me before i
[23:03] never had anything
[23:04] like that happening it was
[23:06] so uh it was crazy man
[23:09] it felt really good to know that god was
[23:11] still working so it was an awesome thing
[23:19] but it took about a year and a half for
[23:20] us to actually move out
[23:23] and then uh towards the end you know we
[23:25] were getting ready to go to akron you
[23:26] know and it just seemed like
[23:28] we couldn't get enough money to come and
[23:30] we couldn't it would never work like i
[23:32] was just continually broke
[23:35] like and every time we had enough i had
[23:37] to pay for something else or another
[23:38] bill and lena one day we were just
[23:40] getting ready to pack i mean this is the
[23:42] night before we were gonna leave and we
[23:43] packed up we decided to take a train
[23:46] because i wanted to make sure we made it
[23:47] to akron and i was like look i was like
[23:50] i'm not repented if we take a plan it
[23:52] could crash out of that you know just
[23:53] fear i'm like i want to make sure i get
[23:55] there and repent you know i'm not trying
[23:56] you know so it was like that so one
[23:59] night
[24:00] we were we were literally finally about
[24:02] to leave
[24:03] and uh we had an apartment set up here
[24:05] in akron
[24:07] by by the grace of brother jesse and god
[24:10] helped us out and uh
[24:13] this one night you know it just seemed
[24:15] like it wasn't gonna work you know i
[24:17] didn't have enough money or something
[24:18] and and i was just like you know what
[24:19] lena i was like i don't want to go let's
[24:20] not do this you know i was just like i'm
[24:22] just gonna work with matt doing
[24:24] construction for like a month and we'll
[24:25] just stack up a month's worth of money
[24:26] it'll be 25 an hour there and i'll just
[24:28] i'll just stack up real quick and but
[24:30] that's what i've been saying the last
[24:31] three months i'm like i'm just gonna
[24:32] stack up one more month you know i just
[24:34] gotta stack up but each time i said that
[24:35] at the end we only had like four or five
[24:38] hundred dollars but nothing like the
[24:39] same amount that i started with you know
[24:41] because it was just i was so financially
[24:42] suppressed i had a lot of debt so
[24:45] she's just like you know what nah she's
[24:47] let's just go with what we have you know
[24:48] she's like let's just go who cares and
[24:50] mind you i didn't i felt pressured
[24:52] because i didn't want to i promised her
[24:54] i wouldn't bring her to akron unless we
[24:56] i knew for sure we were going to be good
[24:57] so i didn't want to bring her out here
[24:58] just a struggle because you know i knew
[25:01] the truth about everybody in the church
[25:02] and the love and she would feel but she
[25:04] didn't know it i wanted to make sure she
[25:05] was comfortable and felt good so i felt
[25:08] burdened
[25:09] to be like okay we got to me i make i
[25:10] got to make sure i'm financially stable
[25:12] we have enough to get a car when we got
[25:13] out there we got to make sure we don't
[25:14] struggle i don't want to bring her to a
[25:16] place where she's going to be more
[25:18] miserable than here
[25:19] but she was just like no let's just go
[25:21] with what we have so we literally we
[25:23] took a lift
[25:24] to needles california was like an hour
[25:26] away we got dropped off and we literally
[25:28] had to wait
[25:29] all night
[25:31] at this
[25:32] super sketchy train station in the
[25:34] middle of this
[25:35] tiny weird town in the middle of nowhere
[25:37] in california
[25:39] weird train station i mean it's so
[25:41] dangerous it was weird it was such a
[25:43] weird vibe we had to wait like what five
[25:45] six seven hours or something like that
[25:46] five hours for the train to come middle
[25:48] of the night
[25:49] like all the way to midnight one am two
[25:52] am and the train finally comes we get on
[25:54] the train you know and then boom it was
[25:56] like a three three four day
[25:58] ride on that train eating nothing but
[26:00] like snack food
[26:03] you know and drinking bottles of water
[26:05] and uncomfortable just sitting in a
[26:07] chair the whole time trying to sleep in
[26:08] tears we slept terribly ate terribly but
[26:11] we finally got home and we end up in
[26:13] cleveland you know and
[26:15] and then brother jesse comes pulling up
[26:17] and it was like man it's like you know
[26:19] finally back you know so
[26:21] we got back and that was this december
[26:23] 20 2021 december
[26:26] and we got back
[26:28] and brother jesse just gets out the car
[26:30] and it was like you know i was like i
[26:31] never left i was like what's up brother
[26:33] you know we just we met again introduced
[26:35] him to lena you know and i think lena
[26:37] already felt the vibe he hit me in the
[26:39] head with the trunk you know we were
[26:41] closing the
[26:42] that was crazy but
[26:44] you know so you know that was probably
[26:46] for leaving for so long so
[26:48] you know that's all right and then uh
[26:51] yeah i didn't text them or nothing so
[26:55] as you're telling your story especially
[26:56] regarding lena like you can see how she
[26:58] was ordained
[27:00] as a child of god
[27:02] so for example her whole life she grows
[27:04] up she knows something about god you
[27:06] know some of her siblings are spiritual
[27:07] and things like that but the very first
[27:09] time she hears the message
[27:10] from you
[27:12] maybe an hour long sermon you preach to
[27:13] her maybe we'd say right
[27:16] or whatever it was
[27:17] she's like okay let's do it like there
[27:20] was nothing in here to disagree with the
[27:21] word of god that you were sharing
[27:23] and then you know build it up to when
[27:25] you're about ready to leave arizona
[27:27] who's the one that really is the
[27:29] motivating force to go it's her
[27:32] and it reminds me a lot of you know
[27:33] rebecca how rebecca was willing to leave
[27:35] her family
[27:36] you know to go get married uh to isaac
[27:40] she left everything you know and and she
[27:42] didn't say give me some more time with
[27:43] my family she said i'm ready to go
[27:46] and so i just see that faith in sister
[27:48] lena you know that that whole time even
[27:49] though you didn't even she never knew
[27:51] about the message you know and but that
[27:54] whole time there there was a seed of god
[27:56] laying in her soul right and then as
[27:58] soon as you speak the word of god to her
[28:00] share it she receives it and then she
[28:02] has this desire to go out to this church
[28:04] where they believe the word and they
[28:06] want to be a family and
[28:08] they want to be a real example of
[28:09] christianity and there she's the she's
[28:12] one of the driving forces behind that i
[28:13] just thought i'd put that in there
[28:15] we get all settled in at home he gives
[28:17] us a love offering you know just a
[28:19] little bit of financial gain
[28:21] the trials start literally on day like
[28:23] two is crazy we got a weird apartment
[28:25] but you know everybody started getting
[28:26] covered kobe was so bad out here and
[28:30] i was i was trying to look for jobs you
[28:32] know and i wasn't having any luck and i
[28:33] finally got a lead i got hired i just
[28:36] had to give him my background check and
[28:38] and i was literally banking on this job
[28:41] because i i'm at this point i just
[28:43] started running out of finances and our
[28:45] first month
[28:46] payment of rent was going to be coming
[28:48] up soon
[28:49] you know and i was like if i didn't get
[28:51] this job and have my first check i'm not
[28:54] going to be able to pay rent so i was
[28:55] banking everything on this job
[28:57] so you know and i already got hired
[28:58] though you know i was like okay my first
[29:00] rent my first check will be in like two
[29:01] weeks for my higher date you know and
[29:03] i'll have enough for rent that'll line
[29:05] up perfectly and my background check
[29:07] comes back and
[29:08] and they call me back and say uh
[29:11] actually we can't hire we don't want to
[29:12] hire you anymore and i was wondering why
[29:15] and they mentioned the felony you know i
[29:16] gave them all the papers all the proof
[29:18] and they still said no you know i was
[29:19] like i was destroyed i'm like man that
[29:22] just
[29:24] killed me i'm like i don't know what i'm
[29:25] gonna do now like i was like there's no
[29:27] way we're gonna pay rent like i was kind
[29:28] of freaking out plus i had all my other
[29:30] bills my loan payment all this you know
[29:32] so and at this time you know this was
[29:35] like a month in literally just a month
[29:36] in and i was already struggling
[29:38] with like if god you know really cares
[29:41] about me still or if you know i'm too
[29:43] far if i was too far gone because i
[29:44] didn't really feel god i mean as soon as
[29:46] i came back though and i went to our
[29:48] first church service which was the first
[29:50] one in four or five years
[29:52] my depression and anxiety instantly went
[29:53] away though i'll do i will say that
[29:56] no more depression it's been gone ever
[29:57] since like i haven't felt anxious or
[29:59] depressed since i came back like it's
[30:00] amazing so that was great got cured
[30:03] instantly of that and it was like like i
[30:06] was reborn again man and
[30:08] you know i'll never forget that first
[30:09] sermon when you were back brother almost
[30:11] the whole church was sick with covid so
[30:13] i think we had three people here other
[30:15] than me
[30:16] austin lena and stephen
[30:19] almost everybody was sick with covet or
[30:21] something
[30:22] i preached on joshua in the cities of
[30:24] refuge and you know just if you're in
[30:26] trouble run to christ if you're in
[30:27] trouble run to jesus jesus is our city
[30:29] of refuge and you just came up for
[30:31] prayer and maybe you can just tell a
[30:33] little bit about this but as as we
[30:35] prayed you know we were both weeping and
[30:36] crying it was such a special moment to
[30:38] see you back in the house of god almost
[30:39] surreal
[30:40] oh wow this is really happening you know
[30:43] i told you i was so proud of you for
[30:44] crossing the country you know in an act
[30:46] of faith to step out on the word of god
[30:49] and then you know you can tell about how
[30:51] you felt the presence of god in you and
[30:52] then later that week you can share how
[30:55] you notice a difference in your life
[30:57] yeah so yeah that first sermon
[30:58] definitely uh yeah that was a great it
[31:01] was a great thing it felt so good to be
[31:03] back i was like man this is so unreal
[31:05] so like i was i went up for prayer you
[31:07] know and i was dealing with a lot of
[31:09] anger you know i had a lot of anger
[31:11] built up man i just
[31:13] i was like an angry person i would lash
[31:14] out
[31:15] i still battle sometimes sometimes that
[31:17] spirit wants to come back but it never
[31:19] i always catch it now like it's nothing
[31:21] it's not like the same how it used to be
[31:22] like i used to be an angry angry
[31:24] individual that would just scream and
[31:26] lash out and then i couldn't control
[31:28] once i was at that point it couldn't be
[31:30] controlling nobody could say anything to
[31:32] me like i would not calm down it was
[31:33] just i had to ride it out you know so
[31:36] it was so bad my mom and i were getting
[31:38] bad arguments all the time and i still
[31:40] had a lot of deep feelings about my
[31:42] childhood
[31:43] so my mom and i would still be in
[31:44] arguments when i got back but uh that
[31:47] sermon
[31:48] but i remember as i was being prayed for
[31:51] i just felt like
[31:53] this insane heat like i mean like this
[31:56] completely crazy warrant like heat
[31:59] build up on my back
[32:01] and all through my body and it was like
[32:04] super super hot and it felt like a hand
[32:07] was on my back almost just hot like a
[32:09] heating pad like if you've ever sat on a
[32:11] heating pad like it felt like a heating
[32:13] pad literally and it was just like super
[32:15] crazy like it was just all on my back
[32:17] all on my body and i was just like man
[32:19] what is this heat you know and
[32:21] i just kind of you know i was like okay
[32:23] that must have been god you know i'm
[32:24] just that uh you know it's god but then
[32:26] uh when i want to prepare it was right
[32:28] after a really bad argument with my mom
[32:29] too it was a really bad one
[32:31] and then after that day i noticed
[32:33] anytime
[32:35] my mom and i would go at it i just
[32:37] didn't get to that complete furious
[32:39] anger anymore it was just like it was
[32:41] controlled at this point i would just uh
[32:43] i don't know it was weird it was just i
[32:44] was different for like it was it was a
[32:47] change in me like i don't get to that
[32:50] insane anger
[32:52] anymore like i get mad like a normal
[32:54] person i get angry and sometimes i have
[32:55] my little moments but i can catch it now
[32:58] and i just put it under subjection i've
[33:01] never been able to do that in my whole
[33:02] life but i just i don't know it just
[33:04] like changed ever since that day i don't
[33:05] have that anymore it's just gone and it
[33:07] doesn't build up
[33:08] and also ever since that day i've just
[33:11] completely forgotten about all my ill
[33:13] feelings if anybody that's ever did me
[33:15] wrong i just i don't feel it no more
[33:17] it's like it used to hold me
[33:18] and now i just don't feel them like i
[33:20] could care less of what happened in my
[33:21] childhood i'm at peace with it now i
[33:23] used to think about my childhood and get
[33:25] sad but now i'm at peace with everything
[33:26] and
[33:27] that it doesn't bother me anymore it is
[33:29] what it is you know like built me who i
[33:31] am so yeah it's been a change since that
[33:33] day i just i'm past it now you know i
[33:35] don't it's not i'm not imprisoned by
[33:37] that or a slave to that anymore it's
[33:39] just
[33:40] that anger's gone and that that pain and
[33:42] sorrow that's all gone anybody that's
[33:44] ever done me wrong you know it's like
[33:45] hey i
[33:46] still love you i don't care anymore
[33:48] i'm not mad angry sad i could care less
[33:51] you know i don't i don't even remember
[33:53] like we don't even got to talk about it
[33:54] i'll just pretend you didn't even do it
[33:55] you know like it doesn't matter to me
[33:57] anymore like it just matters that we're
[33:58] here now and i'm growing from that so
[34:01] it's like amazing that god gave me a
[34:03] second chance you know so that's all i
[34:05] got to say about that it was
[34:06] supernatural day god i think took that
[34:08] from me
[34:09] and that was him just vindicating and
[34:11] showing me that you know he's there
[34:13] and that was the change whatever that
[34:15] heat was it took it with it because i've
[34:17] been like i still get angry i still get
[34:19] uppity a little bit every now and then
[34:20] but it's nothing like it used to be like
[34:22] i can control it now and
[34:24] you know now it's just like a battle i
[34:25] can fight it's way different i used to
[34:27] get like that with everything you know
[34:29] he's like it just doesn't happen anymore
[34:31] i don't know
[34:32] so that's a good example of how the holy
[34:33] spirit comes on people like a holy fire
[34:35] so our brother said he felt like a heat
[34:37] the prince of god god is called a
[34:39] consuming fire
[34:40] and when the holy ghost comes upon
[34:42] someone to anoint them or deliver them
[34:44] sometimes people will feel that and so
[34:46] that
[34:47] this presence of god came on you in such
[34:49] a great way that it actually delivered
[34:50] you
[34:51] from
[34:52] anger or just like extreme anger wrath
[34:55] or bitterness so you got delivered that
[34:56] day just for coming up for a simple
[34:58] prayer the holy ghost anointed you that
[35:00] day and gave you deliverance which is a
[35:01] beautiful testimony by god's grace but
[35:04] you want to share when you got the holy
[35:05] ghost how you felt like it was warmth on
[35:07] the back i thought that might be kind of
[35:09] good to tie in remember when simon
[35:10] prayed for you maybe you could share
[35:12] how that kind of connects
[35:14] um when i got the holy ghost it was a
[35:16] little bit similar
[35:18] feeling when
[35:20] brother simon put his hand on my back
[35:22] and
[35:23] i was just praying not thinking of
[35:25] anything but of god and i felt this huge
[35:28] warmth like a hand that was like three
[35:30] times bigger than mine
[35:32] upon my back and that's when i got the
[35:34] holy ghost right there it was like a
[35:36] warm feeling like how you were
[35:37] describing it very similar
[35:39] but you could just feel the presence of
[35:41] god so strong on you
[35:43] yeah i just saw a connection there
[35:44] between when you got delivered of maybe
[35:46] the anger issue
[35:48] and then when he got the holy ghost and
[35:49] then that's when when my dad prayed for
[35:51] my mom for divine healing uh or the
[35:53] miraculous healing rather of the cancer
[35:55] he said he felt a warm sensation of the
[35:57] holy spirit so i've heard different
[35:59] people say sometimes they feel a cooling
[36:01] sensation some people warm sensation but
[36:03] the fact is when god moves many times he
[36:06] does manifest some type of a feeling or
[36:08] sensation
[36:09] so i just thought i'd share that that's
[36:11] a nice connection there
[36:17] so uh and i was really struggling
[36:19] already a month in satan's battling me
[36:21] i'm like man just got this god still
[36:23] caring about me did i go too far or
[36:25] something you know i didn't really feel
[36:26] his presence like i used to i felt
[36:28] guilty still
[36:29] and that and then i didn't get the job
[36:31] so i'm like man i was just discouraged
[36:33] and i'm like i don't even think god
[36:34] cares about me anymore you know and then
[36:36] on this one wednesday night you know it
[36:38] was crazy you know we're talking about
[36:41] uh the apostle john and how he calls him
[36:43] except the one whom god loves
[36:46] and i really like that uh service too
[36:49] because i'm like man i was really
[36:50] dealing with that i'm like man this is
[36:52] weird i need this service is like
[36:54] weird because i was literally just
[36:55] battling with this and then uh brother
[36:57] jesse at the end you know he looks at me
[36:59] and he says austin the
[37:01] god loves you and then uh he starts
[37:04] explaining that uh
[37:05] this this guy from england random guy
[37:08] that none of us knew
[37:10] uh sent a love offering and said that
[37:12] the holy ghost told him that there's a
[37:14] couple in
[37:15] brother jesse's church that needs
[37:17] financial help and uh
[37:19] he's put on the screen in our church and
[37:22] said that he sent 12 998 dollars
[37:26] to uh get us out of debt and to help us
[37:29] out financially and i just
[37:31] and and it was exactly what i needed i
[37:33] mean i started breaking down i'm like
[37:34] because i was i was really wondering if
[37:36] god still cared about me or if i was
[37:38] like you know too far gone
[37:40] and then from that point on i was like
[37:41] okay i'm never gonna doubt you know i
[37:43] was like that was the most beautiful
[37:44] thing that's ever happened so i mean i
[37:47] took that and i got to pay off all my
[37:49] debts all my debts were paid
[37:52] spiritually and physically
[37:54] so all my debts were paid i got to pay
[37:55] rent i got to pay off my bank loans all
[37:58] the all the debts everything everything
[38:00] was paid
[38:01] and i'm still debt free
[38:02] from that day i decided to get
[38:04] re-baptized shortly after that i got
[38:06] re-baptized with lena we both got
[38:08] baptized and
[38:09] lena and i have just been experiencing
[38:12] blessing after blessing like and it's
[38:13] only what been almost
[38:15] eight months now is my life's already
[38:18] completely i'm a completely different
[38:19] person i mean so it's like the perfect
[38:22] cap to everything you know as i went
[38:24] through all that all that in arizona and
[38:26] it feels like i had to
[38:29] break down and go crazy out in action
[38:30] just so i can go out to arizona and meet
[38:33] lina and bring her back because i mean
[38:34] the the the fruits of her life has shown
[38:36] that she's really one of god's seeds you
[38:38] know she's one of god's children she has
[38:40] been
[38:41] nothing but a blessing
[38:42] here you know and it's been awesome
[38:44] seeing her life change so much she's
[38:47] just decided to completely go fully into
[38:49] the faith
[38:51] and is is completely happy here you know
[38:53] feels like one of the families so is is
[38:56] exactly how i thought it was going to
[38:57] play out
[38:58] yeah so now we're here you know and uh
[39:01] still battling but like i'm nothing like
[39:03] i used to be i mean i don't smoke
[39:04] anymore i stopped smoking in december
[39:07] stop drinking it's the first time in my
[39:09] life where i've been completely sober
[39:10] now 100
[39:12] gave up cigarettes gave up everything
[39:14] you know so now we're just
[39:16] living for god and uh it's complete
[39:18] change i mean if god can help somebody
[39:20] like me and still do this for me he
[39:22] could help anybody to look because i was
[39:24] at the lowest to the lows man like i was
[39:27] down
[39:28] down down deep down in the gutter so
[39:31] he definitely helped me out man so i
[39:33] mean i'm i'm
[39:34] completely changed i can't believe i
[39:36] even came from the place i was at
[39:38] so it's amazing so
[39:45] this has been a wonderful testimony
[39:46] brother maybe last question
[39:48] uh can you tell me some of the
[39:49] highlights of how the message has
[39:51] changed your life and brought you out of
[39:53] darkness into light
[39:55] yeah definitely um well the way
[39:58] the message changed my life is um
[40:00] god took me from the deepest depths of
[40:03] like depression drug addiction
[40:06] jail
[40:07] you know
[40:09] the street life
[40:10] all everything bad you can think of in
[40:13] life
[40:14] and he's completely changed
[40:17] my mind healed me from depression took
[40:19] me
[40:20] from my past paid my debts
[40:22] and uh you know my license was suspended
[40:25] the whole time i was in arizona and now
[40:27] i just got my license back
[40:30] um i'm debt free
[40:32] i just started a new job at a place
[40:35] called mustard seed which is funny so
[40:38] you know faith like a mustard seed
[40:40] and um i've been there for about a month
[40:43] and uh i just got promoted to being a
[40:46] supervisor literally last week
[40:49] you know and that's they told me that
[40:50] i'm the least experienced
[40:52] supervisor they've ever hired
[40:55] and they usually make people wait about
[40:57] a year to even get this position if they
[40:59] work there so i mean
[41:01] it's a big position it's salary and i
[41:03] have to run a whole cafe you know god
[41:06] has been giving me complete blessings
[41:08] and grace in my life i'm on my way to
[41:11] buying a car
[41:12] and
[41:13] i got my happiness back i got a sense of
[41:16] security stability
[41:18] even got my relationship back with my
[41:20] mom so like we've been closer than we've
[41:22] ever been the last six years
[41:24] uh i got a really good good woman by my
[41:28] side i got all
[41:29] got all my church family back you know
[41:31] and uh i'm healthy i'm eating right you
[41:34] know i've gotten my health back my
[41:35] health is in perfect shape despite all
[41:38] the drugs i did
[41:40] and
[41:41] yeah it's just i got a lot of support
[41:43] system behind me i'm just seeing
[41:45] blessing after blessing now i mean it's
[41:47] like been great
[41:48] so it's it's affected me in a positive
[41:51] way and it's completely changed my life
[41:52] supernaturally
[41:54] and i'm really reaping the benefits of
[41:56] you know believing in
[41:58] the full bible gospel so it's really
[42:01] good you know it's like a new beginning
[42:02] it feels like and
[42:04] you know like i said if i can go from on
[42:07] death's door in the death of drug
[42:09] addiction to being
[42:10] a supervisor at a upbeat cafe with face
[42:14] tattoos mind you i have face tattoos
[42:16] tattoos all over my body
[42:18] and i'm in a boss position that you know
[42:21] there's no limit to what god can do for
[42:23] somebody and change them i mean it's
[42:25] like black and white looking at me you
[42:27] know so that's just some of the
[42:29] minor ways it's changed my life
[42:32] majorly though it's given me my soul and
[42:34] my spirit back you know and i have life
[42:36] in me now
[42:38] so that's the major thing like i hadn't
[42:40] where i had no will to live
[42:42] i now see a a good future
[42:44] i'm making a plan to build that future
[42:47] and uh
[42:49] yeah i see myself with a family you know
[42:51] and just everything that i never really
[42:53] cared for back in the day so
[42:55] yeah god god really god really works you
[42:58] know he really he really will bless you
[43:00] if you just believe in all you gotta do
[43:01] is believe
[43:02] you know that's all i that's all i did
[43:04] was believe i didn't really work for it
[43:05] he kind of
[43:07] i believed and everything else fell into
[43:08] place now now i'm
[43:10] actively working to improve my spiritual
[43:13] walk with god but it started on just
[43:16] faith of a mustard seed man just
[43:17] believing
[43:19] so yeah that's all i got to say about
[43:20] that it's just been a huge change you
[43:22] know i'm a completely different person
[43:24] than i was even six months ago
[43:26] let alone four years ago
[43:28] so this is i'm better than i've ever
[43:30] been in my life actually like my whole
[43:32] entire life i'm 25 this is the best
[43:34] shape i've ever been so
[43:36] it's really good you know it's amazing
[43:38] now there's not a lot of people that get
[43:40] a chance second chance when it comes to
[43:41] drug addiction really bad toxic things
[43:44] that should kill a person you know or
[43:47] just very bad so very thankful that i
[43:49] got a second chance and i'm using my
[43:51] time wisely you know and i'm here to
[43:53] spread the message about jesus christ
[43:55] and how real he really is and
[43:58] i feel like a lot of people just hear
[43:59] about jesus and they just think he's
[44:01] just uh that the bible is just a fantasy
[44:03] book here for
[44:04] you know just to control or maybe
[44:07] just for good
[44:08] a positive attitude but it's so much
[44:10] more than just being a good person
[44:12] like it's real life
[44:14] supernatural divine
[44:16] healings and blessings that can happen
[44:18] to anybody that just believes in it you
[44:20] know so and i'm just a perfect example
[44:22] of that i mean it's it's it's pretty
[44:25] obvious at this point that god is
[44:26] definitely
[44:27] has everything to do with what's
[44:29] happened to me in my life and i hope
[44:30] that
[44:31] this testimony can really affect
[44:34] some people positively and wherever
[44:36] they're at in their battles whether it
[44:38] be major or minor battles that they can
[44:40] find some blessing in this and
[44:42] and they can increase their faith in god
[44:44] because that's mainly why i'm sharing it
[44:46] you know so i hope this is a blessing to
[44:48] anybody that's listening and uh god
[44:50] bless you
[44:52] amen what a beautiful testimony the lord
[44:54] has given our brother austin you know i
[44:56] want to point out a couple things
[44:58] first notice that the message always
[45:00] stayed with brother austin from the
[45:01] first time he heard it back in 2016
[45:04] austin could never get away from the
[45:05] bible truce that we taught him and of
[45:08] course we got them from god's prophet
[45:09] brother william branham he always knew
[45:11] the message was right for the year and a
[45:13] half he was with us and then for the
[45:15] five years he was not with us whether he
[45:17] was in akron or arizona he had heard the
[45:20] truth and he was convicted of that truth
[45:22] the entire time
[45:24] and that's the reality of the gospel the
[45:26] gospel and the message of jesus christ
[45:28] makes a permanent mark on every person's
[45:30] conscience we rejoice in the
[45:31] long-suffering of god he's rich in mercy
[45:34] to each one of us
[45:35] striving with us until we humble
[45:37] ourselves and repent and come into the
[45:39] faith
[45:40] a final thought is that we can clearly
[45:42] see the contrast of the kingdom of
[45:43] darkness versus the kingdom of light or
[45:46] the kingdom of god satan influenced
[45:48] austin to destroy his health but jesus
[45:51] christ has restored his health
[45:53] satan's influence caused him to have
[45:55] fractured relationships but jesus has
[45:57] restored his relationships
[45:59] satan influenced austin into financial
[46:01] debt but jesus christ supernaturally got
[46:04] him out of debt
[46:05] satan discouraged brother austin but
[46:07] jesus christ encouraged him this is the
[46:10] beauty of the gospel satan comes that he
[46:12] might steal kill and destroy but jesus
[46:14] comes that we might have life and have
[46:16] it more abundantly and just like brother
[46:18] austin each one of us can enjoy the
[46:20] abundant life
[46:21] of the lord jesus christ
[46:28] we finally reached the conclusion of
[46:30] this testimony and i hope you have been
[46:32] very blessed by brad austin and we have
[46:34] been blessed by him by his presence
[46:36] being here at our church and we sure
[46:38] love him and his girlfriend and we hope
[46:41] the best for them that they'll continue
[46:43] to serve the lord and everything and
[46:45] hope you guys are also blessed by
[46:46] listening to this podcast yeah austin
[46:48] and lena have been a wonderful blessing
[46:49] here at the church and we're so grateful
[46:51] for their faith god has answered so many
[46:52] more of their prayers and testimonies i
[46:54] know god will continue to do so so we're
