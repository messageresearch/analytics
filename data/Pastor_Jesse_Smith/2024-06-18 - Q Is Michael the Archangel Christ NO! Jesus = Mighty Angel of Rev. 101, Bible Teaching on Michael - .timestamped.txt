[0:02] and at that time Michael should stand
[0:04] the great Prince Michael was Christ of
[0:06] course who fought the Angelic Wars in
[0:10] heaven greetings friends in the
[0:12] matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[0:15] the purpose of this videos to answer a
[0:16] viewer's question is Michael the
[0:18] Archangel Christ this is an excellent
[0:21] question my answer is no and I'll get to
[0:23] all the reasons why in this video but
[0:26] first friends I'm Jesse Smith pastor of
[0:27] bride of Christ Fellowship here in akan
[0:29] Ohio USA and I defend the Bible
[0:31] revelations that Jesus Christ revealed
[0:34] to St Paul and now is had to restore
[0:36] through the late Prophet brother William
[0:38] Branham 1909 to 1965 I also defend
[0:42] brother bram's Godly Christian character
[0:44] to summarize my brief answer no I do not
[0:47] believe Michael is Jesus Christ there's
[0:49] a lot of Bible support for this answer
[0:52] and Friends there's only two quotes from
[0:53] Brother Branham where he says Michael is
[0:55] Christ so it looks like brother Bram
[0:57] grew of course in his Revelation on
[0:59] Michael
[1:00] and two quotes from brother brandom in
[1:02] 18 years of recorded sermons is a very
[1:05] very small sample size in comparison
[1:07] there's 54 quotes on the third poll and
[1:10] there's 426 quotes that say baptized in
[1:14] the name of Jesus so here's the outline
[1:16] for the video we'll look at Bible
[1:18] teaching on Michael then we'll look at
[1:19] reasons Michael is not Christ and then
[1:22] we'll look at quotes from Brother
[1:24] brandom Bible teaching on Michael first
[1:27] of all according to the Hebrew lexicon
[1:29] the word Michael means who is like God
[1:32] there's five verses about Michael the
[1:34] Archangel the first is Daniel 10:13 the
[1:38] angel that visited Daniel said but Lo
[1:40] Michael one of the chief princes came to
[1:42] help me the first time we see Michael
[1:44] mentioned is him helping an angel get to
[1:46] Daniel and he's called one of the chief
[1:48] princes now what I believe is that means
[1:50] Michael was one of the two covering
[1:53] cherubs by The Throne of God the other
[1:56] would have been Lucifer and then Michael
[1:57] would have been the second now I can't
[1:59] prove that by scripture but that's my
[2:01] guess based upon the word of God that's
[2:03] just my humble opinion the second
[2:05] mention of Michael is in Daniel 10:21
[2:08] the angel again shows there's none that
[2:10] holds with me in these things but
[2:12] Michael your prince so here we see that
[2:14] Michael was Israel's Prince which means
[2:17] a leader or captain in the Hebrew so
[2:20] Michael's the leader of the Jews
[2:21] Michael's the captain of the Jews that
[2:24] means God's protective ministering
[2:27] Spirits over the people of Israel
[2:29] remember in context there was a Prince
[2:31] of Persia there was a demon power over
[2:34] the kingdom of Persia so then the people
[2:37] of God had to have an angel over them
[2:39] and that was Michael next Daniel 121
[2:41] says at that time shall Michael stand up
[2:43] the great Prince which standeth for the
[2:45] children of thy people so here we see
[2:47] Michael spoken of this is during the
[2:48] seven-year Great Tribulation period
[2:50] Michael stands up which means to hold
[2:52] one's ground in Hebrew and he stands up
[2:55] for Israel Daniel's people so not the
[2:58] Gentiles the Jews thy people means Jews
[3:01] not Gentiles so again we see Michael
[3:04] connected with the nation of Israel the
[3:07] next verse is Jude 1:9 it says Yet
[3:09] Michael the Archangel when contending
[3:11] with the devil he disputed about the
[3:13] body of Moses dur not bring against him
[3:15] a railing accusation but said the Lord
[3:17] rebuke thee so here we see Michael
[3:19] called an archangel which means the
[3:21] chief of angels I'll get to that more in
[3:23] a little bit here we see how Michael did
[3:26] not revile Lucifer or Satan he just
[3:28] rebuked him so here see even Michael
[3:31] showing some level of respect for
[3:33] Lucifer or Satan I think now would be a
[3:36] good time to remind you that I made a
[3:37] video called dumb devil there's
[3:39] preachers today calling the devil dumb I
[3:41] believe that's a bad thing to do I don't
[3:43] think that's a good thing to do because
[3:45] here even Michael the Archangel would
[3:48] not revile Satan he simply rebuked him
[3:51] so Lord willing I'll leave a link to
[3:52] that video in the description next
[3:54] there's a beautiful clue here in the
[3:56] scripture Michael's connected with the
[3:59] Resurrected body of Moses so we see
[4:02] somehow Michael knew that Moses's body
[4:04] was raised and resurrected and then
[4:07] Moses went to heaven sometime shortly
[4:10] after he actually died of course we know
[4:12] this is true because in Matthew chap 17
[4:14] on Mount Transfiguration Moses and
[4:16] Elijah meet Jesus to talk about his
[4:18] decease or his crucifixion so we see
[4:21] Michael connected to a resurrected body
[4:24] and that's why on a recent video I said
[4:25] that perhaps Michael will give the voice
[4:29] he'll be the voice voice of the
[4:30] Archangel for the dead in Christ to rise
[4:32] first remember 1 Thessalonians 46 And1
[4:35] 17 say there's three phases to the
[4:37] Rapture shout voice Trump I currently
[4:40] believe and I stand to be corrected I
[4:42] could be wrong but I I believe the shout
[4:44] is brother Ram's ministry that's going
[4:46] around the world the Rapture process has
[4:48] started just like the process of God
[4:52] giving Israel an exodus out of Egypt and
[4:54] then placing them in the promised land
[4:56] was a process brother Ram's Ministry was
[4:58] the shout The Voice of the Archangel I
[5:00] believe would be Michael's voice calling
[5:02] forth the dead in Christ the Bible says
[5:05] the dead in Christ will rise first and
[5:07] then the Trump the last Trump would be
[5:08] the last trumpet to the Gentiles and
[5:11] then 1 Corinthians 15 says that last
[5:13] Trump is the moment when we're changed
[5:15] in the moment in a twinkle of an eye
[5:17] death is swallowed up in life our sinful
[5:19] bodies are swallowed up in a glorified
[5:21] body so notice friends the last Trump to
[5:24] the Gentiles is not the seventh or last
[5:27] Trump in the Book of Revelation the
[5:29] seventh and last trumpet would be found
[5:31] in Revelation 11 verse 15 and the
[5:35] seventh angel sounded and there were
[5:36] great voices in heaven saying the
[5:38] kingdoms of this world are become the
[5:39] kingdoms of our Lord and his Christ and
[5:41] he shall reign forever and ever so
[5:43] that's a topic for another video for
[5:45] another day Lord willing if the Lord
[5:47] terries it's so important to know that
[5:49] the last trumpet to the Gentiles is
[5:51] different from the last trumpet to the
[5:52] Jews because God works in the two
[5:55] separate
[5:56] dispensations so the fifth and final
[5:58] verse about Michael is revelation 12 12
[5:59] 7 and 8 and there was war in heaven
[6:01] Michael and his angels fought against
[6:02] the dragon and the dragon fought against
[6:04] his angels and prevailed not neither was
[6:06] there Place found anymore in heaven so
[6:09] here we see how Michael defeated Lucifer
[6:11] in heaven when Lucifer drew a third of
[6:14] the angels to join him so those are all
[6:16] the verses about Michael now I want to
[6:18] share my opinion just briefly I believe
[6:20] Michael was one of the two cherubims
[6:22] that covered the Throne of God Lucifer
[6:24] being the other one and this was of
[6:26] course before Lucifer rebelled I believe
[6:28] this because when Moses built The Arc of
[6:29] the Covenant he had two angels at the
[6:31] mercy seat or Throne of God Moses got
[6:34] this pattern from Heaven according to
[6:35] Hebrews
[6:37] 8:5 Moses was commanded make all things
[6:40] according to the pattern showed thee in
[6:41] the mount so I believe after Lucifer
[6:44] fell Michael became the Archangel or the
[6:47] chief Angel but before that Lucifer was
[6:50] the more beautiful of the two but he let
[6:53] it become a source of Pride for him this
[6:55] is found in Ezekiel
[6:56] 28:12 the Bible said he was full of
[6:59] wisdom and perfect in Beauty Ezekiel
[7:01] 28:14 said Thou Art the anointed cherub
[7:04] that coverthe so verse 15 thou was
[7:07] perfect in thy ways from the day that
[7:09] thou was created till iniquity was found
[7:11] in thee Isaiah gives more the thoughts
[7:13] of Lucifer Isaiah 1413 for thou said in
[7:16] thine heart I will Ascend into heaven
[7:18] I'll exalt my throne above the stars of
[7:20] God I will sit also upon the Mount of
[7:22] the congregation in the sides of the
[7:23] north I will Ascend above the heights of
[7:25] the clouds I will be like the most high
[7:29] now look at reasons Michael is not
[7:32] Christ first reason is Christ would be
[7:34] on the throne of God in heaven and not
[7:37] an angel because Christ is the object of
[7:40] worship or the person to be worshiped
[7:42] because of his glory of course this is
[7:44] found in many places but John 175 Jesus
[7:47] prayed and said and now oh Father
[7:50] glorify thou me with thine own self with
[7:53] the glory which I had with thee before
[7:55] the world was so before there was even a
[7:58] world that Satan could be cast down to
[8:01] the son was already with the father
[8:03] sharing his glory and that's of course
[8:05] because the father is invisible Spirit
[8:08] John 4:24 says the father is a spirit
[8:11] and Colossians 1:15 says the father's
[8:13] invisible so the first visible image of
[8:16] God is the son is the logos is the Holy
[8:19] Ghost is the Lord Jesus Christ and the
[8:22] invisible father shared his glory with
[8:24] the visible Spirit the visible
[8:26] manifestation of himself of course we
[8:28] also see this in John 1 vers1 in the
[8:30] beginning was the word the word was with
[8:32] God and the Word was God the logos was
[8:35] with God and the logos was God this
[8:38] reminds me of another Revelation how
[8:39] Jesus was the first one to dance the
[8:41] Bible says Proverbs 8:30 the Bible
[8:44] speaks about the wisdom of God of course
[8:46] we know this is the Holy Ghost this is
[8:48] Jesus the logos and then it says then I
[8:50] was by him as one brought up with him
[8:52] and I was daily his Delight rejoicing
[8:54] always before him rejoicing in the
[8:57] habitable part of his Earth and my
[8:58] Delights were with the sons of men so
[9:01] this word rejoicing means to play music
[9:04] singing dancing so it's a beautiful
[9:07] picture of the visible Son of God
[9:11] rejoicing before the invisible father
[9:14] more about the first reason um the angel
[9:16] host of Heaven worshiped God so the son
[9:19] had the same Glory as the father and
[9:22] that made the son the object of worship
[9:24] as well because the son is the visible
[9:26] image of the invisible God Nehemiah 9:6
[9:30] says this and the host of Heaven
[9:33] worshipthe thou even Thou Art Lord alone
[9:36] thou has made Heaven the heaven of
[9:38] Heavens with all their hosts the Earth
[9:40] and all things that are therein so the
[9:42] Lord God Alone made the host the
[9:44] heavenly host and all the host of Heaven
[9:46] worships God or Jesus and we also know
[9:50] this is true because Ephesians 3:9 says
[9:52] God created All Things by Jesus Christ
[9:55] Jesus Christ is the word of God the
[9:57] invisible father created All Things by
[9:58] his word or Jesus Christ the logos
[10:02] second reason is the book of Hebrews
[10:04] says Jesus was made a little lower than
[10:05] the angels and it says God never called
[10:08] an angel son so we see this in Hebrews
[10:11] 2:9 but we see Jesus who was made a
[10:13] little lower than the angels for the
[10:15] suffering of death Hebrews 1:8 says but
[10:18] unto the son he saith thy Throne oh God
[10:20] is forever and ever so here the son gets
[10:22] the same Glory as the father Hebrews
[10:25] 1:10 says and thou Lord in the beginning
[10:28] Hast laid the the foundation of the
[10:30] earth and the heavens are the work of
[10:31] thine hands remember God created All
[10:34] Things by Jesus Christ Ephesians 3:9 and
[10:37] then Hebrews 1:13 but to which of the
[10:40] Angels said he at any time sit on my
[10:42] right hand until I make thine enemies
[10:43] thy foot stol so there it plainly says
[10:46] God never had the Angels sit on his
[10:49] right hand or sit on the throne of God
[10:52] then Hebrews 1:14 says the angels are
[10:54] all ministering Spirits sent forth to
[10:56] minister for them who shall be Heirs of
[10:58] salvation
[11:00] so Hebrews 1 and Hebrews 2 shows a clear
[11:02] distinction between angels and Jesus
[11:05] Christ and so notice Jesus was made a
[11:07] quickening spirit that's a lifegiving
[11:09] spirit in 1 Corinthians
[11:12] 15:45 but the angels of God are simply
[11:14] ministering Spirits so there's a great
[11:17] difference between Jesus a quickening
[11:18] spirit one who can make alive that's a
[11:21] great difference with just the Angels
[11:23] they're simply ministering Spirits the
[11:26] third reason we know Michael is not
[11:28] Christ is because brother never preached
[11:29] an entire sermon on this subject like
[11:32] brother Ram taught an entire sermon on
[11:34] mzc brother Ram never taught an entire
[11:37] sermon on Michael was Christ whenever
[11:40] brother R would teach on a topic he
[11:42] would use large amounts of scripture
[11:45] large amounts of biblical support to
[11:48] prove a point like who is this mzc like
[11:51] the future home like serpent seed like
[11:53] water baptism like the godhead like the
[11:57] Seven Seals the seven Church ages and so
[12:00] forth now friends let's look at quotes
[12:02] from Brother brandham there's only two
[12:04] quotes where brother Bram says Michael
[12:05] is Christ so again that's a very small
[12:07] sample size compared to a topic like the
[12:10] third poll that has 54 or baptize in the
[12:14] name of Jesus 426 and I'm sure there's
[12:16] another way I could word that about
[12:18] baptism in the name of Jesus Christ and
[12:20] there would be hundreds more if not a
[12:22] thousand more so the two quotes where
[12:24] brother random said he believed Michael
[12:26] was Christ were from 1955 and 1963
[12:29] brother brandom said Michael was Christ
[12:31] of course who fought the Angelic Wars in
[12:33] heaven with the devil let's listen to
[12:35] the quote and at that time Michael
[12:38] should stand the great Prince Michael
[12:40] was Christ of course who fought the
[12:42] Angelic Wars in heaven with the devil
[12:45] Satan and Michael fought together or
[12:47] fought against each other rather the
[12:49] second quote is 1963 Christ The Mystery
[12:52] of God revealed brother Braham said the
[12:54] first thing that Lucifer done to
[12:55] separate the fellowship of God and man
[12:58] he said was build a United Kingdom a
[13:01] greater Splendor a greater Kingdom than
[13:03] Michael Christ had let's listen to the
[13:06] quote the first thing that Lucifer done
[13:09] to separate the fellowship of God and
[13:11] man he wanted to build him a United
[13:15] Kingdom of Greater
[13:17] Splendor and seemingly more
[13:22] cultured a greater Kingdom than Michael
[13:25] Christ
[13:26] had on the other side there's many many
[13:29] quotes where brother Ram said Michael
[13:30] was not God Michael was not Christ I'll
[13:33] just do one it's from the breach 1963
[13:35] brother Ram said there wasn't worthy
[13:38] people there in heaven when the seven
[13:40] seal book needed looked at picked up and
[13:43] then loosed he said the Angels weren't
[13:45] worthy he didn't say Gabriel or Michael
[13:48] it had to be a Kinsman he said they were
[13:50] in a different category that had never
[13:52] fallen so we can plainly see that
[13:54] brother Bram said Michael could not take
[13:56] the book but Christ could take the book
[13:58] so Michael cannot be Christ let's listen
[14:01] to the quote not that there was some
[14:03] worthy people there not like an angel
[14:06] like uh for instance we'd say a Gabriel
[14:09] or Michael but
[14:12] remember he'd had to be a
[14:15] Kinsman remember John said here and no m
[14:19] n not Angel amen not sarapin they hadn't
[14:23] sin but they were in a different
[14:25] category they had never
[14:27] fallen I think I'll share one more
[14:29] quotes from Souls that are in prison now
[14:31] 1963 November 10th morning service
[14:35] brother R speaking of Revelation 10 1-7
[14:38] the mighty angel coming down and brother
[14:39] brandom calls that Mighty Angel The
[14:41] Covenant Angel which was Christ brother
[14:44] Bram notes how this Mighty Angel Christ
[14:47] in Revelation 10 has the same attributes
[14:49] as Christ had in Revelation CH 1 a
[14:51] rainbow over his head a face that shine
[14:54] like the sun and other attributes so
[14:57] Revelation 10:1 said Christ came came
[14:59] down as a mighty angel that means a
[15:01] mighty messenger and as message
[15:04] Believers we believe this Mighty Angel
[15:06] was represented by the cloud picture
[15:08] from February 28th 1963 in one place
[15:11] brother Bram said it was seven angels
[15:12] making up the head of Christ similar to
[15:15] the painting done by Hinrich Hoffman
[15:17] Hoffman's head of Christ and then we see
[15:19] when brother R preached the Seven Seals
[15:21] the next month in March of 1963 he said
[15:24] the Holy Ghost visit him every day in
[15:25] the form of the pillar of fire he also
[15:27] said the angel Lord visited him
[15:29] so we see Christ coming down as a mighty
[15:31] Angel is Christ coming down to reveal
[15:34] his word to his Prophet God coming down
[15:37] himself in a spirit form not the
[15:39] Corporal body of the Lord Jesus Christ
[15:42] but a spiritual body or Celestial body
[15:44] because angels have celestial bodies so
[15:47] Jesus Is Not An Angel but Jesus comes
[15:49] down in a spiritual form so the Bible
[15:52] calls it a mighty Angel and so we see
[15:55] here in Revelation 10 the same thing God
[15:57] did in Exodus 23:20 God sent an angel
[16:00] before Moses to keep him in the way and
[16:03] bring him into the place which God
[16:04] prepared for him that's in Exodus 2320
[16:08] down to Exodus
[16:10] 23:23 of course this Angel was the Holy
[16:13] Ghost again the word Angel here means
[16:16] messenger and we just called this Angel
[16:18] the angel of the Covenant because he was
[16:20] going to bring Moses into the promises
[16:23] of the Covenant and so we believe that's
[16:25] the same thing the Lord Jesus Christ did
[16:26] by the Holy Ghost with brother brandham
[16:29] the Holy Ghost was with brother brandham
[16:30] in a son of man Ministry to bring him
[16:32] into the promises of finishing the
[16:34] mystery of God Revelation 10 verse 7 and
[16:38] surely the Holy Ghost was with brother
[16:39] brandham Discerning the thoughts and
[16:41] intents of the heart so I believe this
[16:43] is a verse where God hides the truth
[16:45] from the wise and prudent and reveals it
[16:47] unto babes such as would learn so let's
[16:50] listen to the quote from Souls that are
[16:51] in prisoned now
[16:54] notice it was to be the seventh Angel's
[16:57] message that was to reveal the
[17:01] seventh the Seven Seals Revelations 10:7
[17:04] now you'll find it see and he saw this
[17:07] Angel come down put his foot on the land
[17:09] and on the sea that was Christ had a
[17:12] rainbow over his head notice him you
[17:13] find him in Revelations 1 again with the
[17:15] rainbow over he said look upon is Jasper
[17:16] and Sardis and so on here he come put
[17:19] one hand one foot upon the land one upon
[17:21] the Water raised up his hand he had a
[17:23] rainbow over his head yet that's a
[17:24] covenant he was a covenant Angel which
[17:26] was Christ made a little lower than the
[17:29] to suffer there he come and put his
[17:31] hands up to heaven and swore by him that
[17:33] lives forever and ever the Eternal one
[17:35] the father God that time shall be no
[17:39] more in
[17:41] closing friends I hope this video was a
[17:43] blessing by the grace of God it's
[17:45] wonderful we just enjoy these Bible
[17:47] revelations straight from the scriptures
[17:50] brother Brandon pointed us to these
[17:51] truths and rejoices our hearts it's
[17:53] wonderful again to see how brother Ram
[17:54] can grow in Grace and knowledge of the
[17:56] Lord reminds me of recently I preached
[17:58] how Jesus said the Holy Ghost will guide
[18:00] us into all truth and that doesn't mean
[18:02] understanding every single thing in the
[18:03] Bible but it means giving us all the
[18:06] things that we need that pertain to life
[18:08] and godliness as second Peter 1 says so
[18:11] we can see how the Holy Ghost was
[18:12] helping brother Ram grow in Revelation
[18:14] and understanding brother Braham thought
[18:16] Michael was Christ but he never made it
[18:19] a major Doctrine and as brother Bram
[18:20] said we never major on a minor the
[18:23] identity of Michael is a minor it's
[18:25] certainly not a major the major is
[18:27] getting people saved through the blood
[18:29] of Jesus Christ by grace through faith
[18:31] Ephesians 2 8-10 and Romans 3:25 faith
[18:36] in the blood of Jesus Christ that's the
[18:38] major that we must focus on by God's
[18:40] grace it seems friends that you know
[18:42] accusers of brother brandham are just
