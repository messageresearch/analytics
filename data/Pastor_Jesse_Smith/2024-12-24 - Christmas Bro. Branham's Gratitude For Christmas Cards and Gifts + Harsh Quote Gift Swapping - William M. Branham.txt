TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] I want to take this time to express to each and every one of you how grateful I am to you for your Christmas cards and gifts and things that was received at our house amen I certainly thank you with all my heart and I don't have words to express to you what I how I appreciate every one of them and may the god of Heaven bless you you richly is my prayer greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this videoos to show quotes from God's Prophet brother brandham about his receiving of Christmas gifts and also his giving of Christmas gifts recently I received a text about the topic of Christmas and it made me think of these quotes so I thought I'd share them here by the grace of God hi friends I'm Jesse Smith pastor bride of Christ Fellowship here in akan Ohio USA and I defend the original Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ that he revealed to St Paul and then had a restore through Martin Luther John Wesley and the late Prophet brother William Marian brandham who lived from 1909 to 1965 and I also defend brother Ram's Godly Christian character I would say in this video I'm defending brother Ram's Godly Christian character I'm aware there's quotes on both sides of this topic there's numerous quotes where brother brandom is against gift giving but in this video I'm going to show the quotes where brother brandom was positive about gift giving and brother Brandon was thankful for gifts a lot of the quotes from this video came from my 2018 sermon I preached on how we worship at Christmas time so I'll leave a link to that sermon in the description also I did a video last year about four reasons I don't have a Christmas tree so I'll leave a link to that in the description as well I do give my children three gifts a piece though they get a book they get a clothing item and they get a toy of course my older ones don't get toys now they probably get gift cards or something like that now the Bible foundation for how we worship at Christmas is from Colossians 2:16 and 17 and Romans 1413 Colossians 2:16 And1 17 says let no man therefore judge you in meat or in drink or in respect of an holy day or of the new moon or of the Sabbath days which are a shadow of things to come but the body is Christ so here Paul gives the Colossians the right to not let someone judge them for how they worship on a holy day so that's what Christmas is for us it's a holy day we always have church on Christmas if it falls on a Sunday or Wednesday so at Christmas time we never cancel services in fact when Christmas doesn't fall on a Wednesday or Sunday we usually add a Christmas service so we have more worship of the Lord Jesus Christ during this holiday season so from Colossians 2:16 and 17 we see the Liberty that we have to worship any day that we call a holy day we consider a holy day Romans 14:13 said let us not therefore judge one another anymore but judge this rather that no man put a stumbling block or an occasion to fall in his brother's way so we get two lessons here we have the Liberty to worship on a holy day the way we want the way we're convicted by the Holy Spirit but we must stumble no man or woman so my life personally no one's ever told me that I've stumbled them because I give my children three gifts a peace and again I don't have a Christmas tree so I feel I can Worship the Lord in a pleasing way during this holiday season by the grace of God so now we'll go through six quotes about giftgiving then we'll look at a very harsh quote from Brother brandom about gift giving but also look at before and after quotes from the same sermon and then we'll look at brother R's final quote about receiving gifts in December 1965 okay so let's look at six quotes about gift giving the first one's 1951 brother brand was saying his first wife hope went over the river to get the Kitty's Christmas presents so I don't know if brother random bought Christmas gifts every year for his children but here he did at this point so before the Ohio River flood of 1936 or 1937 I can't remember which one brother R's first wife hope would go across the river to buy things for their kids for Christmas because brother R was at work let's listen to the quote little old brother George the night come I remember it just day before Christmas wife went over the river to get the Kitty's Christmas present and then I remember the flood came along and she went over the river to get some things for the kitties for Christmas and I was working 3 years later in 1954 brother Ram said his church provided gifts for the children but they gave the gift after the sacred part of the service that must be the preaching part must be the sacred part and brother Ram said they gave boxes of candy oranges to the children let's listen to the quote I'm sorry I kept you late now the little children has a Sunday school Retreat here just in a minute they got all boxes of candy and oranges and a sack full of stuff over here for the little ones as soon as we get done with the sacred part of the service just in a minute 5 years later in 1959 brother brand said he would like to send a Christmas present to everyone but can because he's a minister and that would be too many people to send gifts to notice brother Ram said he appreciated all the cards and the gifts that he was given his wife and the children appreciated it and send their thanks but again I want to point out 1959 brother brand wished he was able to send everyone a Christmas present let's listen to the quote now as brother Neville has said and so do I want to thank each one of you for the membrance of Christmas your card brother and sisters fans here got yours and all the different ones here that sent me your cards around I do appreciate them and the gifts and things that you sent we certainly do appreciate it from my wife and I and we the children we thank you we would like to be able to send a Christmas present to everyone but that sure be a hard thing for a preacher to do it or maybe around as many as there is to go to I just wouldn't be able to do it you see I just but I wish I could even get the kitties everyone something I'd sure like to do it but it's not this ministers can't do that there's just too many to go by but we are all I'm sure myself and others to that we appreciate our congregations one of the greatest things that I think that you've done is your love and your undying faith that you have placed in me as your one of your pastors year and this year the next year 1960 brother Rand again takes time to express his gratitude for all the Christmas cards and gifts and he thanked them with all of his heart brother Ram said they had a Christmas tree in their house because Joseph wanted one and he had several gifts under his tree that he' opened and he said May the god of Heaven bless you richly was his prayer then he says we cannot send gifts back because he doesn't make enough money but he's grateful for the thoughts let's listen to the quote now another thing I would like to say as brother Neville has so well said that we wished you the best in the theseal tidings and this time of of Fellowship around these holy days and so forth and then I want to take this time to express to each and every one of you how grateful I am to you for your Christmas cards and gifts and things that was received at our house amen I certainly thank you with all my heart it certainly did US good this morning when I got a little boy small enough yet to kind of want a Christmas tree and we had it in the room and this morning going to there I found several gifts from my church here and my friends from around different places that had come in laying under the tree and uh don't have words to express to you what I how I appreciate every one of them and may the god of Heaven bless you richly is my prayer and now and us you know how it would be we cannot send back uh gifts because I just wouldn't make that much money you know I I make $100 a week and I got a big family and about 10 million friends it was sure be kind of hard to go around them but we U we are grateful to you and your thoughts and I'm sure you understand the next year in 1961 brother Ram said he wished he could give Christmas presents to everyone but he can't do it he also thanks the church for the nice things that he was given for Christmas and then he tells a story he decided to buy a Christmas gift for brother Neville a new top coat but then it looks like the church actually paid for brother Neville's top coat so here you see brother Ram had a heart to want to give out a Christmas gift to brother Neville the pastor but then the church took care of it let's listen to the quote well I want to take this opportunity to thank this church and its members for the nice things that you gave me for Christmas a while ago my son came in and gave me a great big box and I was in this my study room study I opened it up and found a new suit of clothes from this Tabernacle and little personal things that people have sent me just up there which I haven't opened up until Joe comes in tonight and opens up his and then I I certainly appreciate that the Lord bless you I wish I could give Christmas presents to everyone I can't do it you know how it is you just can't do it that's all if you if you give to one shows respect like that you just can't do it a minister just can't do that and I understand that brother Neville this morning was presented with a new top coat so grateful to you all for my brethren there's a little secret to that that Billy Paul and I know you know I'm so slow about anything uh catching on anyhow about anything Billy told me the other day he said you know Daddy I was over at the supermarket and said who did I meet over there he had a little quiver in his voice brother Neville and said he had on a top coat looked terrible now I said would mind fit him and so uh and he said no he's a much bigger man than you are so I said I'm just going down and get him one so then um I get my check from the church like he does so at that time Billy come running up with a great big uh influential word and smile on his face Daddy the church is going to get him one well I know the church could probably get him a little better one than so I thought that's just wonderful so we could all have but uh we know that it come in A Real Fine Place in brother Neville needing that Cod and six and finally in 1962 brother Ram said they had a present there for the kitties brother ramam said it's nothing compared to God giving his son Jesus Christ he said but just as Mortals one to another we do that so brother R said we give gifts to one another to let them know that God gave the greatest gift ever his son Jesus Christ let's listen to the quote but um I think the church has got a little present here for the little kitties that while I was just looking at door back there oh you want to stay after Sunday school you just hold on see CU I I think they got some presence back there for the little fellas to give out this morning amen and um when I you little fellas remember while we're doing this I want to make this clear it's not Santa Claus because that's a story that someday you'll learn that's nothing to it but it's from Jesus Christ the truth of all truth is said the Son of God and we're giving you this little present this morning because it's letting you know that one time God gave the greatest present could ever be given to the human race his son and um we have a poor way expressing it and there's nothing we can give to compare with that but just as Mortals one to another we do that now let's look at the most harsh Christmas quote I've ever heard of now of course I could be wrong on that but I also believe it needs balanced and we have seen a star and we've come to worship him on December 16th 19 63 and Tucson brother brandom said all those who are intolerably with it Christmas tinsel and things will be burn with unquenchable fire and notice he says the world The Sinner will be punished they will punish with the world the worldly loving people so we'll listen to this quote but then we'll listen to quotes before and after so here's the first quote that I won't to follow I want to follow the Morning Star Christ I want to follow and find my Jesus this day I want to get away from all this your Christmas tensil and things because someday it's going to be burnt with unquenchable fire and all those who are tonight to Jesus Christ and his word raise your hand again now anybody that hasn't raised God bless you bless you now before this quote brother Bram says no matter what they're doing out there they're not worshiping God at Christmas time he said it shouldn't bother us for making Christmas what it should be then brother Ram said light shines the best in darkness brother Ram said we should scream out on the streets it's the birth of Jesus Christ not the visit of Santa Claus let's listen to the quote so no matter how how bad the outside looks and what they're doing out there that should not bother us from making Christmas what it should be see I think that the light shines the best in the darkness darker it is the better the light shines sometimes just a small light where there's much light is not noticed but the darker gets that small light will shine that much stronger that's what the Church of the Lord Jesus Christ should be reflecting the light of him while he is absent from the earth in the physical body the church should be the reflection of Jesus Christ in these dark hours when Santa Claus and tinel all over the street we should scream out it it's a birth of Jesus Christ and not the visit of St Nicholas we're living in an awful dark time that's when our light should really shine now now the quote after the most harsh quote in the same sermon brother Rams getting the people to Bow their heads and close the service and brother Ram said I'm wishing you the very merest of Christmas that God would guide you to the word made flesh so we see the balance from this sermon brother R rebuked Sinners and their worldly behaviors during Christmas time but he told us how we should worship we should talk about the birth of Jesus Christ and it was okay for brother Ram to say I'm wishing you the very merriest of Christmas let's listen to the quote let's bow our heads now he saying let's get your mind on him I'm wishing you the very merriest of Christmas that God will send his star from the East that Rose in the East 19900 years ago and will guide you to the word made flesh I surrender all I surrender arms up to God all to thee my blessed [Music] savior lastly I want to play a quote from a 1965 sermon December 7th leadership in California 3 weeks before brother Ram died he was still thankful for a Christmas gift he's at a banquet and he wants to thank a lady who gave him a box of Christmas candy he said that was my first Christmas present so I thank you for it so to me this is what I see I see a pattern or brother R I'm always thankful for Christmas gifts I never see brother M rebuking anybody around him for giving him Christmas gifts or his children or his wife we see brother brandom wanting to give gifts to others but not having the financial ability to do it so I see a pattern of brother random having this approach to Christmas gifts it's fine to give them as long as you give with the right heart the right Spirit God loves a cheerful giver and it's all right to receive gifts and be thankful for them and be grateful to those who gave you the gifts so let's listen to this quote from December 65 and uh I want to thank that lady I can't thank of her name Billy just told me that' give me a box of Christmas candy just brought out the car a few moments ago the sister I can't think of her name she's from here in California as my first Christmas present so uh I thank you for it enclosing friends hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God again all these quotes kind of came to my mind when I saw a text about Christmas so I thought I'd put these quotes together and make a video showing this side how brother random was grateful for gifts and wanted to give gifts wished he could give gifts if he could afford them and so by God's grace this is why I feel I have the Liberty to give gifts to my children and others as I feel led of the Lord and I always remember brother BR finished the mysteries of God and in brother bram's preaching and Teaching Ministry he never forbid anyone of their Liberty of gift giving and brother R was always thankful when he received gifts and publicly thank people for those gifts so I think this topic is a great lesson on the Liberties that we have have as Christians and also the responsibility to not cause others to stumble with how we worship during Christmas time or really any holiday so I'd encourage you to remember Romans 14:23 whatsoever is not of faith is sin so I have faith in the scriptures I read earlier Colossians 2:16-17 and Romans 14 about liberties we have as Christians I have faith in that so it doesn't stumble me to give my children gifts or to receive gifts at times if people want to give them to me and this is mainly because because I see these quotes from God's Prophet brother brandham I see his public gratitude his public thankfulness and I see a prophet of God who wished he could give a gift to everybody but just couldn't afford it that resonates with me that's how I feel I wish I could give more gifts but probably the best gift I could give to anybody would be to pray for them tell them I love them I appreciate them and so forth by the grace of God so let's try to do that this Christmas season if we can as we feel L of the Lord and as God gives us enough time let's show our appreciation to others Jes Jesus said you'll know my disciples because of their love one for another if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
