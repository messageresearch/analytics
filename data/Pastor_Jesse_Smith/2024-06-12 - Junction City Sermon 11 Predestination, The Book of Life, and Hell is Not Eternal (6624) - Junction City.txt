TRANSCRIPT
========================================
so by God's grace we'd like to look at predestination tonight if we have time you know the book of life and then I want to look at how hell is not Eternal so I want to look if we can cover those three topics I think that'd be wonderful uh by God's grace I got a whole list of topics I'd like to preach to you so I know we're we're so blessed to hear the word of God hallelujah brother brandom said when the uh when the scriptures were revealed to him when the Seven Seals were revealed he said the Bible became a new Bible and that's what I find in my life you know I just go back over some topics and it feels like it's brand new again uh the revelations you know our human Minds can't remember everything so it's so good to go back over things that we've heard before and it refreshes us the Bible says all you children know about all you uh children know about cooking right you like to stir things up right the Bible says stir up your pure Minds by way of remembrance so God wants you to stir up all those good thoughts right and get it moving in your mind and you want all the word of God constantly in your thoughts praise God hallelujah Romans chapter 8 uh just on a side note Romans chapter 8 is one of the most beautiful chapters in The Bible if you haven't read that lately I would encourage you to do that I mean it starts off with there's no condemnation um and then it goes uh uh into how we've received the spirit of adoption already we're already adopted with the Holy Spirit we're already God's children uh and then it says all things work together together for our good uh no one can condemn us God's Justified us nothing can separate us from the love of God this is a power packed chapter Hallelujah so if you have not read that lately I encourage you it always stir me up and encourages Me by God's grace so Romans 8 we'll start at verse 28 so I want to look at predestination uh and forn knowledge here tonight and then Lord willing like I said go to the Book of Life and then if we have time we'll do hell is not Eternal uh I'll take questions of course at the end I'm going to try to watch my time hopefully I Don't Preach two hours here tonight but uh you know you never know if you're pulling on the word of God you know it might go fast Hallelujah I'm just a teeny bit horse we had a good service last night but I was shouting and screaming so much that I'm a little bit horse here so uh forgive me Romans 8:28 I'd like to um hear your voice too you know so let's read uh 28 together okay if we can read that on three 1 2 3 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose now I'll read verse 29 28 is very familiar how many take comfort in that verse no matter what happens God is going to use that to work out for your good right and what would be your good it would mean that you would love God more right that's what's good right whether we get more money or not or whether we get better clothes or not or a better house or not that might not be to your good but what is good is when you love the Lord Jesus Christ with all your heart soul mind and strength Hallelujah that's the greatest command is to love God with all your heart Hallelujah now verse 29 says for whom he did for know he did also predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified so I don't know if you saw it but there's five steps in there that God uses uh for our for his purpose for our existence everybody catch that there's five in there so we'll go over that but before we do that let's have word of prayer if you have a need on your heart let's just make it known unto God you can raise your hand or you can just bow your heart God sees your desires let's pray father God we thank you for these songs that we can sing and praise your Holy Name We Come Just As we are Lord God hallelujah we come to the Lamb of God here tonight Lord God dear Lamb of God minister to our needs Lamb of God you're called the high priest now who can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities Lord Lord you can feel what what we feel Lord God hallelujah you experien it Lord God and Father you're the high priest of our profession so God we make our profession to you Lord speak to us tonight Lord God give us Revelation give us understanding Lord and we know revelation will overcome the Gates of Hell Hallelujah so father we thank you for the word of God we thank you for the holy spirit thank you for these families God that you've called and saved and filled with the Holy Ghost Lord God and we know if they haven't yet Lord we know you'll do it Lord God because you're faithful Lord you said if we're baptized we shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost you are faithful God so Lord bless this night tonight and all these children may they grasp something from the word of God as well we'll be happy and grateful when we leave this place in Jesus Christ name and the Saints said amen amen God bless you as you're being seated Hallelujah so again it's a privilege to be here I look forward to you know this summer uh this is my first week of vacation so I've been enjoying it I've been studying a lot more I've been enjoying that uh and look forward to this summer you know if you have any topics you'd like me to preach on just let me know uh I probably at some point already preached on it I've already probably written about it or made a video about it and it's a good place to start by God's grace so I want to take these three topics uh you could you know you could take a whole sermon on each one of these but I want to make sure I get through a lot of things here uh this summer by God's grace and I told Brother Irvin too I said if you want me to come on a Sunday if you need a preacher just let me know just give me a couple weeks heads up so I can find somebody to cover for me I just want to make myself available so everybody can hear the word word of God I remember what it was like when I first came in the message I couldn't wait for the next service I always wanted to hear more I always had all these questions Hallelujah and I just couldn't wait till the next service so I'm sure you feel like I do hallelujah amen now uh predestination the word predestination means to predetermine to determine before or limit in advance so we know God has predetermined uh our lives hallelujah amen and here's the five steps now it's in verse Romans 8:29 the first step of predestination is for knowledge brother brandom said God fornew you in his mind and because he had for knowledge about you then he could predestinate events in your life so it all starts where where does it all start in the mind of God hallelujah that's where you started and brother Braham said you started as a thought of God right and if he said he said if you're a thought of God then you're a part of God right and God's thoughts are just as real as God is hallelujah amen so there's a when the Holy Ghost comes in you it's a part of God right it's Christ in you it's a part of the holy spirit that was the part that was in God before the foundation of the world brother raham said you are you are attribute in the thoughts of God brother raham dramatized it he said it's like in God mind he had a photo album and all the Christians all the Believers all the Jews before the in the Old Testament all the Believers had a picture in God's family album and God knew when you were when he was going to manifest you on the earth he sent Adam at the right time he sent Enoch and Noah at the right time then he sent you know uh Moses and Joshua he sent all of them but then it came to your turn hallelujah amen and brother Ram said you look just like God's thought that was in God's photo album before the foundation of the world Hallelujah you were a thought in the mind of God he fornew you and that way he could predestinate you now keep your spot there but you you you probably know this verse right Ephesians 1 4 and 5 so here's your start your start is in the forn knowledge of God that's why brother Ram says there's a part of you that's just Eternal as God because you're a thought of God you're an attribute of God you're a child of God the Bible says you're his offspring Hallelujah we are his offspring so Ephesians 1 verse we'll just read verse four according as he hath chosen Us in him when before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love so when did he choose you he chose you in his mind before the foundation of the world I was chosen in Christ Hallelujah so that's where church that's where you start God had for knowledge God had all this plan in his mind about the 6,000 years of human history and uh the first 4,000 without Christ and then sending Christ and now having the church ages right he blinded the Jews and now he's getting a gentile bride and then after the Rapture then he's going to go back and he's going to uh seal 144,000 the Jews are going to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost after the Rapture hallelujah amen God had this great plan in his mind and God knew this would be the time that you came on the scene Hallelujah so the first step is for knowledge the second step is predestination according to Romans 8:29 the third step here is in verse 30 then he predestinate he did also call now the word call is the same word for election or choosing Hallelujah so first you were forn and then God predestined the time you'd be here and then when you got here then God called you hallelujah amen hallelujah and I was I was happy to see I was right there when you got called Hallelujah I was just about a year ago by God's grace I saw it Hallelujah God called you amen you were elected you were chosen to receive the word of God when others didn't receive it others turned their back on it you received it Hallelujah because God called you amen and you recognize God's call for your life Hallelujah and then when you did that the fourth step there in verse 30 is whom he he called he justified and remember that means declared righteous as you wish to be Hallelujah so you have because you accept Jesus Christ his sacrifice now he's declared you righteous he took your sin and he gave you his righteousness and now you are Justified you you have the righteousness of Jesus Christ Hallelujah and there's no condemnation to them that have the righteousness of Jesus Christ Heaven holds nothing against you how could it amen because you were in God's mind before the foundation of the world hallelujah thank you Jes heaven doesn't hold anything against you you're a child of God hallelujah amen it's glorious amen and then what's the last step church after all this what's the fifth step whom he has Justified he's also glorified brother Ram said that's your rapture why because you get a glorified body that's what the Rapture is death this this body of death is swallowed up with a new body it's swallowed up in a glorified body and so that's why brother says the Rapture is already in you amen because it's already part of the five-step process here it was for knowledge right and then it was predestination then election then you were Justified and just as sure as you were Justified you will be glorified Hallelujah Oh Glory Hallelujah it it's it's set up this is God's plan he set it up this way Hallelujah and if you've been Justified of course if you've been forgiven then it's just as sure you're going to go got a glorified body Hallelujah cuz this is God's steps amen now go to acts 17 there's a beautiful verse here I've used this all throughout my life since I was a Christian and it lets me know God wanted me to be an acran it lets me know God chose me to be an akran and God chose you to be here in Junction City God already knew that it's not well just it was luck or it was just a chance no God brought brother Irvin here hallelujah right didn't y'all y'all left some other place right and come to this place right what state did you leave Michigan where you were from Michigan Michigan and Nebraska is where Michigan Nebraska where did Brother re where did you come from homes count okay Glory we're both from Ohio amen acts 17 verse 26 and hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on the face of the Earth and hath what determined God determined the times before appointed and the bounds of your habitation hallelujah amen see God already predetermined this this was already set up in God's mind God wanted you to live in Ohio so you can hear the message hallelujah amen glory and then God determined this is the year right this is the year 2024 but God determined last year would be the year that you received it God determined all this time God didn't want you to live 2,000 years ago God didn't want you to live 6,000 years God wanted you to live right now because you he built you in a certain way that you would manifest Christ for this generation hallelujah amen hallelujah I'm kind of glad I'm kind of glad I didn't have to be Noah I'm glad I didn't have to go through the ark you know what I mean amen I'm kind of glad about that I'm I'm glad to live in this day hallelujah amen I'll say like this I'm glad to live in this day because even Mar uh Martin Luther would drink a lot of alcohol and he would smoke cigars and you know he didn't really live a clean life I'm glad I get to live a clean life Hallelujah God could have had me get saved in the 1500s I could have been there with Martin Luther you know it's 1517 when he nailed those 95 thesis to the church door 1517 you know I'm glad I got to live in 2017 Hallelujah because uh you know God's revealed more of his word now and now I can live a holy life a more holy Life by God's grace right does that make sense Hallelujah so see church we got to remember God determined you would live right now and you determine which state you'd live in Ohio Hallelujah of all places thank you brother I appreciate God would reward you sir thank you Hallelujah now why did God determine this look at the next verse uh sister uh Ruth do you want to read verse 27 would that be okay sister Ruth that they should seek the Lord if half they might feel after him and find him though he be not far from every one of us amen so why did God determine 20 24 and Ohio so you would seek after him Amen in other words God put you in the best place to hear the word of God and then seek his face wow are you with me everybody with me amen amen this is God's plan God put you in the best place to hear the word of God to come to know God and to seek after God hallelujah amen hallelujah God couldn't have set it up any better for you right God determined this before the foundation of the world he fornew you be here he predetermined all these events of your life and what does he want you to do he wants you to reach out and try to know him oh hallelujah amen glory to God thank you Jesus verse 28 for in him we live see we're living in Christ we move in Christ and have our being as certain also of your poets have said for we also are his offspring remember friends we're not he's not far from us hallelujah is that in the next verse though he be not far 27 okay so we already read that yes yes yeah we because he's not far from us so you know we we don't need to feel like God is some way far off you know God and he's not interested he's really the Bible said he's nigh to us right he's close to us he's determin the steps of your habitation I'm going to just tell this story real quick uh if you've been up to our church in akan you've met probably the sarpong family they're from uh they're from Africa they're the uh family from Ghana okay so they were raised you know uh they they they come in the message right and they had a family uh and then they got the chance to come to America and one of the Saints uh a sister there was was concerned and she was a little nervous she she'd seen a lot of Gans come to America and lose their faith in God because of all the Temptations right money and pleasure and all these things and uh she was really uh just nervous about it and she said oh Lord you know am she's just wondering am I going to leave the message once I get to America so when she got here God sent her to akan I looked it up it's over 5,000 miles unal she flew 5,000 miles across the ocean and she's like where I don't even know if there's a message Church in akan she's like I don't even know if I'm going to be able to live the word of God can I even live the message in America hallelujah amen but see God before she even flew over here God had already set up a message Church wow God had already prepared a place because God predetermined that Hallelujah and so when she got here she reached out is there you know she called the the the most local pastors and they say yes there's a message church right there in akan and our church is literally 10 minutes from her house and she said she said that verse right there in Acts 17 has helped her so much because God determined she wasn't sure should I go to America or not should I am I going to Lose My Faith or not but she she said Lord she she said a she set a fleece before the Lord like Gideon said Lord if you want me to go do this well that happened so that you follow that prayer that answer to the prayer W and friends I just want you to let you know as this example shows you can leave you can move 5,000 miles away God knows where you're going right Hallelujah God knows what you're doing and when you when you want to draw close to God God will help you draw close to him Hallelujah he's determined all the events of your life hallelujah amen what a confidence that we should have in God to know that he predetermined where we'd be the time we'd be here that we could reach out and touch God we could reach out and draw nigh to God God Did It for our good amen all things work together for our good hallelujah oh it's beautiful Hallelujah now there's another verse just so you know 1 Peter 1 ver2 brother John you want to read that 1 Peter 1:2 here's another verse that says the for knowledge of God there's only two in the whole Bible right brother Ram said God predestines based upon for knowledge God forew who you'd be what you would be like uh where you'd live what time you'd live and based upon that for knowledge he could predestinate events of your life Hallelujah so brother John want to read that elect according to the forn knowledge of God the Father through sanctification of the spirit unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ Grace unto you and peace be multiplied all right thank you brother so everybody can see that what do we elect what are we chosen to we're chosen uh according to the for knowledge of God that's the first step God's for knowledge God forne we be here God fornew Us in his thoughts and because of that then he could predestinate us he could elect us he could choose us he could call us and then he could justify us and then he will glorify us amen hallelujah think of that brother Ram I'm sorry think of that you know Jesus already has a glorified body hallelujah amen amen oh it's it's glorious hallelujah we're going to get a glorified body as well Hallelujah and a glorified body brother B says a is a glorified condition of your physical body and it's a glorified body can also eat food as well brother Braham said it can walk through walls because Jesus would they had their door shut after the resurrection and Jesus walked right through the door so your glorified body can walk right through these atoms right here and these molecules you can just walk right through it Hallelujah it can appear or disappear uh the glorified body uh is an eternal body hallelujah it's a glorified condition Hallelujah now uh there's a lot of good scriptures on here um I'm just going to hit the highlights because there's so much to uh to show here by the grace of God now each person has free moral agency right uh we're not going to have to read all these but um you know Cain was given or Adam and Eve was given a choice the tree of life and the tree of knowledge good and evil God bless you brother Howard good to see you sir nice beard there brother looking good there Hallelujah right and then Cain had a choice God said if you do well in Genesis 4:7 won't you be accepted but he says but if you don't sin lies at the door right Hallelujah god Set life and death before Israel in Deuteronomy 30: 15-20 Joshua told Israel choose you this day whom you will serve so there is an there's an element where everybody has a choice brother B calls it free moral agency brother Ram said God had to give free agency or else people could come up to God and say God you made me go to hell so you know you can't send me to hell because you made me go to hell brother said God can't do that God has to give everybody free more agency right Hallelujah but because he forn knows what you would choose then he can predestinate you to receive the word of God amen said he knows the choice you'll make Hallelujah that's in the sermon uh 1965 uh just give me a moment there it's what message is that oh thirst yeah thirst listen to thirst 1965 it's a beautiful message this is It's A Beautiful message about the soul and how your soul has a thirst and God gives Every Soul a thirst to know him David said my soul thirst for the Living God Amen Hallelujah so we see it we we have to have uh we have to have this understanding of God to know God is fair God gives everybody free more agency and I love what Jesus said Jesus said the Holy Ghost is to any man how many know uh John 7 uh 37 Jesus said If any man thirsts let him come to me and drink Hallelujah If any man see how the Holy Ghost is available to anybody If any man thirst do you ever check you ever check this Revelation 22:17 the spirit and the bride say come and let him that Hearth say come and let him that's a thirst come and whosoever will let him take the Water of Life freely everybody say whosoever will ready whosoever will If any man whosoever will see the the Waters of Life the Holy Ghost are open to anybody any can anybody can receive it right Judas could Cain could have anybody could receive the uh the word of God it's it's free more age it's your choice thank God you made the choice hallelujah thank God I made the choice Hallelujah to drink of the Waters of Life Hallelujah now that I drink of this water brother Irvin I'll never thirst again I'm talking about spiritual water right we'll never thirst for the things of the world we'll never go back to the world and and leave Christianity no way we we we've had Living Water Hallelujah and the Bible said it bubbles up inside of us and it overflows sometimes and such Joy such shouting such worship such prayers amen it just overflows it's Living Water hallelujah oh my thank God hallelujah thank you Jesus it's to anyone now look at 2 Peter 3:9 Sister Sarah do you want to read that one when you get a chance 2 Peter 3:9 2 Peter 3:9 said God wishes uh I'm sorry God's not willing that any should perish this shows God's forn knowledge right this shows God's mercy so whenever you're ready sister uh 2 Peter 3:9 amen see God Is So merciful he gives each person free more agency he wants them to be saved but of course he knows few there be that find it okay so I just want to show you this other side and church there there is the other side where you know God told Jesus or Jesus said I won't pray for the world remember that in John 17 he said I pray for my followers I pray not for the world like there came a time when when when Jesus was instructed to the father because he said I only do what the father shows me there came a time when he didn't pray for the Pharisees anymore right right because God must have gave the understanding these are serpent seed they're beyond Redemption they're not going to receive it right but God was merciful to them God God let them hear Jesus's preaching they had a chance they had the free more agency but it got to the point where like brother said they pass pass the line between mercy and judgment the Bible calls it the reprobate mind when a person gets a reprobate mind they'll never come to Christ that's in uh Romans chapter 1 they they've gone past that they've gone past the opportunity to receive him and that's what happened to the Pharisees that's why Jesus said I pray not for the world but I pray for those who will believe on me through their word hallelujah amen oh my oh it's beautiful now you you don't have to read this but first Peter 2 ver4 the Bible said who will have all men to be saved and come unto the knowledge of the truth that means he wishes in the Greek doesn't mean everybody's going to be saved it means god wishes to have all men to be saved just like our sister read thank you sister Sarah did you know this one Ezekiel 3311 says as I live sayeth the Lord I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked anybody ever remember that remember that verse God doesn't Delight when Sinners die God doesn't because that they're missing out on eternal life right God doesn't Delight in that it it wasn't a delight when Judas betrayed Jesus you remember what Jesus called him he called him a friend the night he was betrayed he called him a friend right yo this this shows the heart of God the love of God God wants these people to be saved but in God's mind of course Church in God's mind does he know what they're going to choose yes and that's why he calls us vessels of Honor and he calls the Sinners vessels of Dishonor right that's Romans chapter n he said I made Pharaoh as vessel Of Dishonor but so I could show my power to Israel hallelujah amen glory to God Amen so see God because God forn knows what they're going to choose he could Harden Pharaoh's heart 10 times right he could Harden his heart 10 times and show his power to Egypt and also to Israel because he fornew what was in Pharaoh's heart he knew it wasn't in Pharaoh's heart to repent so he could use him as a vessel Of Dishonor oh but he knew what was in Moses's heart Hallelujah he knows what's in your heart hallelujah amen because he's got four knowledge he knows you Hallelujah he determined where you'd live he determined when you'd live Hallelujah he knows that you'll love and serve him hallelujah amen yall remember Jeremiah chapter 1 right let's read let's turn there this is just comforting to know that whatever God has called you to be it was before you were before you were even formed in the womb God had already determined what you would do right verse four Jeremiah 1 ver4 then the word of the Lord came unto me saying before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee oh there it is hallelujah there's that form knowledge Hallelujah before you were even uh the product of a conception in your mother's womb before that I already knew you oh what a privilege that is to tonight church amen to know that God already knew you before you even were a baby Hallelujah before you even uh before you even conceived he already knew you and before thou camest out of the womb I Sanctified thee and ordained thee a Propet unto the Nations Hallelujah that's why when brother ran was born there was already a pillar of fire there Hallelujah God had already ordained him a prophet amen hallelujah God him already ordained that just like Jeremiah I'd already ordained a Prophet this has already been determined amen I like that song we were you guys were playing earlier uh I know how the uh fighting a battle you've already won isn't that that that's a predestination song absolutely it is I'm fighting a battle but Jesus already won it Hallelujah I I love the I love the bridge to that song The Bridge says I know how the story ends we will be with him again oh Hallelujah God gives us understanding of his for knowledge Hallelujah we already know how it ends he's already given us insight into the battle Hallelujah and now we overcome church we overcome every trial by believing the word of God Amen by obeying the word of God you are Overcomers because you keep the word of God hallelujah thank you amen all right now so what's uh what's our responsibility our responsibility then is second Peter 1 ver10 second Peter P 1:10 it says wherefore the rather Brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure everybody catch those two words your calling and election remember election was the third step forn knowledge predestination election so Peter and if anybody should know it's Peter he knew Jesus right if anybody should know about that it should be Peter and he said make your election sure he says for if you do these things you shall never fall if you keep the word of God You'll Never Fall Away Hallelujah if you love Jesus if you worship God if you confess your sins if you come to church if you pray if you give tithes if you give offerings if you Worship in your home and you confess your sins every day you shall never fall away hallelujah what a privilege amen thank God I'll Never Fall Away Hallelujah I can't cuz I was in the mind of God before the foundation of the world if was there there's no way I could not be there Hallelujah right I was already there right and it's already determined I was The Offspring of God you are The Offspring of God you are a child of God nothing can change that amen Paul said 17 things there Romans 18 uh death principalities Powers uh Peril nakedness sword nothing can separate us from the love of God which was in Christ Jesus Hallelujah nothing nothing can separate us cuz we were chosen it in God Hallelujah the Lord amen it's glorious amen see now you and I might say well well Jesse or brother Jesse not how do I know I was in the mind of God brother BR says because you keep the word of God Amen brother BR said that's how you know your name is listen to the seals brother said that's how you know your L your name is on the Lamb's Book of Life because as soon as that word comes to you you want to do it right you want to keep the word of God and doesn't that line up with John 14 Jesus said If You Love Me Do What keep my Commandments he said if you don't if you don't keep my commands you don't love me aren't you glad you keep his commands oh hallelujah praise God Amen that's how I know my name is there that's how I know I'm predestinated because I love Jesus and I keep his commands amen a I love the word of God Amen it's glorious now that's just a good uh oh yes here's another good one yeah you don't want to forget this one uh Ephesians 2:10 Ephesians 2:10 sister L do you want to read that Ephesians 2:10 whenever I sorry to put some of you on the spot but I like to hear your voices too I don't want to do all the Talking look at this scripture Ephesians 2:10 now we know Ephesians 28 and9 talk about we're saved by grace through faith aren't you glad for Grace Hallelujah Grace is an unmerited favor right God gave you a favor you didn't deserve that's Grace Hallelujah and you just have to have faith in what God did you just have to have faith or trust uh in the the sacrifice of Jesus Christ and then you're saved and then you're Justified and you're already going to be glorified but this is a beautiful verse about predestination sister L can you read that for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God has before ordained that we should walk in them amen wonderful sister look at that you are God's workmanship in other words God made you a artwork Hallelujah you're a piece of God's artwork didn't he did he form you amen amen you moms did you did you moms actually form those babies in the womb did you take the time and and and put all those uh ligaments together and the organs no God did that amen you're God's workmanship Hallelujah you're God's Masterpiece brother Ram says you're a masterpiece Hallelujah and see you're saved by grace but then you realize after you're saved wow God made me a certain way and brother Ram said brother Ram said maybe you were born to fast and pray he told that to Florence sharan maybe you were born to cast out Devils maybe you were born to preach like I was born to preach Hallelujah I didn't know that yeah I met two people that said when they first met me right after I come in the message two people said I knew you'd be a preacher I'm like I didn't think I'd be a preacher see it's something God showed them now it encouraged me later they didn't tell me till I started preaching kind of wish they would have told me beforehand it's all good but you know God sees it God and God knows so there's there's something you can do Brother John nobody else can do right right brother irin sister Wilma there's something each one of you were made to do by God nobody else can do amen exactly right Hallelujah you're God's workmanship and he's formed you to do something for his great name for the mothers it's easy to see your job is to raise those children and to teach them the gospel of Christ amen because the Bible said Ruth no I'm sorry yes oh no the Bible said uh Rachel and Leah the Bible said Rachel and Leah buil the house of Israel the mothers yeah think about that the 12 tribes and the millions of people in Israel they were all built by Rachel and Leah they buildt it God used the women to build that to build that that that Kingdom right to to build that Holy priesthood hallelujah amen God used sisters to do that amen right and you Brothers God's called you to do something some some of you I can see the construction that you do and some of the work the farming you do I'm like how do they do that God made you to do that right there's a reason you're doing that because God made you do that some people tell me we don't know how you can preach it we don't know how you can handle those 22 kids in your classroom I said God made me to do it it's just in me hallelujah it's in you whatever you can do God already put that in you because he built you that way you're his workmanship hallelujah it's exciting as parents to see what God's called our kids to do like my daughter's 19 and my son's 17 and it's pretty awesome to see what God's called them to do like wow we're starting to see what God uh called them to do do by God's grace amen you are God's workmanship Hallelujah Now isn't that wonderful praise God now I could go a lot further here on this um there's a lot lot more scriptures you know the Bible said Jesus was for ordained to die on the cross it was in the plan of God you know and uh Satan uh and the Bible said the prince of this world didn't know what would happen when Jesus was crucified amen CU they would not have crucified him if they known what was going to happen he sent the Holy Ghost amen and then The Same Spirit that was in Christ is now in the Believers amen he didn't know that so it was a mystery but God God hid that mystery from them now brother R said this I love this quote it's from a 1960 brother BR said by four knowledge God saw that I would love him so he made a propit through his own son that through him I might go from a sinner to a he said a grain of wheat all you Farmers here hallelujah isn't that wonderful amen hallelujah so brother said before the foundation World God knew William brandham would love Christ so God sent Christ for William brandham God sent Christ for junson City Church hallelujah amen God sent Christ for me amen because he knew I would love Christ that's what brother B said hallelujah oh it's wonderful now that's just a very very uh quick teaching there on predestination I like to move to the book of life because it all kind of goes together I'm only uh 20 I guess I'm 33 minutes into the sermon Hallelujah the first 33 minutes but i' like to uh transfer over now to the Book of Life Hallelujah brother R said the book of life he says is now he says different things but by the end he said the book of life is like one book and he says there's a section he said that's like we would say the Lamb's Book of Life section like this kind of like the old New Testament and then he said the rest is The Book of Life it's like a book with two sections okay but then there's also yeah there it's kind of like that and he says it in the church age book if you want if you want a really solid teaching read chapter 7even of the church age book how many you read to the church age book already okay two three praise God hallelujah I'll tell you'll be blessed if you read that church age book listen to the church age I'm sorry read the church age book and listen to those Seven Seals you're going to be blessed that's that's my life is founded on those right when I come in the message the first thing I did was read the church age book it's given me a solid position in Christ Hallelujah now you moms maybe can read it to your children during the Bible times Hallelujah that'd be a good thing to do I we've done that we read through the church age book as a family we read through uh the Bible as a family you know in our family devotion times that'd be a good thing to to to train the the children on that amen all right now now here's here's the mystery about the Book of Life the mystery is that some people's names can be removed not us because I told you you were chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world only people that the Bible says that forfeit or Cast Away or trample on the gospel only those people will have their names blotted out of the book of life and they can only be blotted out of the book of life section the book of life section but brother Ram said if your name was on the Lamb's Book of Life your name can never be blotted out and that's you and I hallelujah amen thank you Jesus our names can never be blotted out right because we never worship the Beast system right we won't bow down to Rome and say oh yeah I want your MK I want your cup of grape juice and I want your wafer that's going to and then church they actually believe that's the Holy Spirit they believe that the spirit and the body and they believe as long as that food is in their body then they they're under the anointing of God and so when they use the restroom and you know all all the digestion goes then they got to go have mass again to get the anointing back I'm glad we can get it back by just by praying Hallelujah I'm glad we can get the anointing back just by worshiping just by reading our Bibles amen amen it's not in a literal wafer or a or a little cup of grape juice or something like that the Bible said when we sin we grieve the holy spirit that means we offend the Holy Spirit brother says like a dove that flies away and'll set up here until you're ready to say Lord I'm sorry and then when you say when you repent he comes back and anoints you imagine that little Dove sitting on your shoulder there Hallelujah the sweetness of the Holy Spirit what said the sweetness and the tenderness of the Holy Spirit but when we get upset or we we say something mean that anointing just leaves our mind right and God's waiting for us to say Lord I'm sorry forgive me I love you I didn't mean to do that and then sometimes we got to go to that person and say I'm sorry you forgive me brother John will you forgive me I didn't mean to say that about you and then he said yes of course brother you're my brother and then that sweet Holy Spirit comes back well let me give you a hug brother you know how can I help you can I do anything for you amen hallelujah praise God thank the Lord now the book of life there's a lot of good verses we'll just hit the highlights now I want to prove to you um that people can they can receive the word but then they can lose the word right how many remember Luke 8:13 the parable of the four uh four grounds brother Howard you want to read that Luke 88:13 brother Luke 88:13 It's A Beautiful Parable remember I showed you those four grounds this is a while ago you probably forgot but listen there's four grounds there's four classes people can fall in there's the wise version the Holy Ghost filled that's the Lamb's Book of Life there's the foolish version that's the book of life that are saved and then there's the Judas scar group that's one we're going to read about now then their names are blotted off the book of life and then brother said that fourth group they they never believed in the beginning their names were never on the book of life he said like Pharaoh Pharaoh's name was never on there because he never believed in Moses's message right right is that amazing there's four groups there so brother Howard Luke 88:13 now this speaks of like a Judas who he believed for a while but then he he forfeited and he threw away he cast down eternal life and he didn't want it anymore so go ahead brother Luke 8:13 on they receive all right everybody say the word for a while can you say that for a while for a while they believe but then they fall away and in the parable it's like a seed the S SED a seed and it grows up but then something comes around and snatches it up the Bible say Satan does that Satan will snatch up the word of God that was placed in someone's heart like Judas think about that church for 3 and 1/2 years he served Jesus the Bible said he cast out Devils he cast out Devils but then at the end he got filled with Devils right he could cast out Devils he could pray for the sick but at the end he so wanted money so bad that he sold out Jesus for that money and then Satan filled his heart and then he of course committed suicide it's it's just it's just so sad he had the word of God and that's a good lesson too no matter how good your pastor is some people are just not going to believe because Judas had the best pastor there ever was amen right right some people blame the pastor some people blame the preachers but really it boils down to you amen amen boil is down to you right Pastor can't force you to do nothing a preacher can't make you to do nothing right right they're there the preacher is supposed to be the example right I'm supposed to be a servant to my church which I am I try to serve them I'm not I'm not the Lord over them I'm the servant to them hallelujah amen I'm the minister to them so see there's the verse people can receive the word of God but then if they don't uh if they're not careful they can forfeit the word of God okay now there's a lot of good scriptures the Bible said You Must Believe to the saving of your soul that's Hebrews 10:39 words you must believe your entire lifetime the Bible said in John 17:12 Jesus said none of the disciples were lost but the son of predition so Judas was trusting to be saved for a while but then he forfeited his salvation you'd be surprised most churches believe once you're saved you're always saved right but what's the truth of that brother Iran the truth is once you're sealed you're always sealed amen hallelujah amen cuz Ephesians 4:30 says you're sealed not to the next Revival not to the next year but you're sealed until the day of your Redemption hallelujah amen that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's how you know you're sealed that's how you know you'll never lose it because you're sealed unto the day you get a brand new body Hallelujah the Bible says This Old House will be put down and you get a new house amen you get a new Tabernacle Hallelujah not made with man's hands it's Eternal in the heavens hallelujah amen thank you Jesus oh Glory Hallelujah now let's read uh I want you to see this here people can lose their part from the book of life it's Revelation 22:19 Revelation 22:19 sometimes I look around and brother John can you read that Revelation 22:19 and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy God shall take away his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city and from the things which are written in this book amen can ever see that if you take away something from the gospel God will take your name out of the book of life right that's why we preach everything in here I'm not afraid of one verse I might not understand it but I know it's true Hallelujah I know God's right I know God doesn't lie Hallelujah that's that's why we got to preach the whole gospel that's why we need to meet on Thursday nights that's why we got to meet on Wednesday nights because we need to hear more of the word of God it's transforming right the Bible said when you get the word of God in your mind what does it do it transforms you by the renewing of your mind amen anybody go through some mind battles this week anybody you know what you need you need a transformed mind you come to the right place Hallelujah God's word God's word will transform renew your mind by the transformation of the Mind Hallelujah by the holy spirit amen in other words get your you know like this is like this is like leaving the World Behind and shutting in with God this is like coming into a secret meeting with Jesus amen and Jesus wants to tell you some things you're going to need for the rest of the week amen hallelujah he wants to pull you aside from the cares of this world and all these things and and the the frustrations and doubts he wants to pull you aside and he wants you uh to renew your mind tonight so you can think better tonight and tomorrow and heading into the weekend till brother Chad comes amen amen to preach God's word to you and give you some more life-changing thoughts hallelujah amen because the Bible said as a man thinks in his heart so is he amen right Hallelujah so if you're thinking about God's word if you're thinking about I'm predestinated and God called me here and God determined I'd be here and I'm God's workmanship you'll act like it Hallelujah you'll live like it Hallelujah when you got those thoughts in your mind I am predestinated God knew I'd be here I'm here for a purpose I'm just not not wandering around this universe I'm here because God wanted to be here in Ohio hallelujah amen God I'm here so I can preach to The Junction City thanks Hallelujah that's why I'm here hallelujah that's why God saved me amen so I can be a pastor and Aran God I mean all these events of our lives are ordained by God so we'll fulfill his purpose hallelujah amen so our brother read that now here's a great one I want to read uh John 1027 John 10:27 I think it's 27 28 29 he's talking about my sheep hear my voice verse 28 and I will give them what eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my father's hand oh amen there's no device of Satan that can ever pluck you out of the hand of God think about that church your life is in his nail scarred hand and nothing can take you out of his hand your whole existence your whole future Hallelujah everything about you is in God's hand and nobody can take you away from the love of God you're in the hand of your creator amen Oh Glory hopefully somebody shouts tonight by God's grace amen if not I will hallelujah amen now brother Ram gives us in the church age book he gives us four uh truths about the Book of Life first it's located in heaven Jesus tells us that in Luke 10:20 he said your names are written where in heaven so the am Church might have said well your name's got to be on our book on Earth if you want to be in heaven that's a lie Jesus said Rejoice that your names are in heaven amen it don't matter if your name's on the Catholic book or the Methodist book or the Pentecostal book what matters is that your name is on the Book of Life hallelujah it's only in heaven amen the second Truth uh only Jesus blots names out of The Book of Life uh go to re uh Lydia would you read Revelation 3:5 Jesus is the only one who can blot it out but remember if you were in him and you were chosen to Salvation he won't blot your name out he's going to leave it there Hallelujah Revelation 3:5 Jesus is the only one who blots out names it's like it's like that group in Matthew 7 Lord didn't we cast out Devils didn't we heal the sick didn't we do all these many many wonderful Works he said depart from me you workers of iniquity they didn't obey the word of God I never knew knew you hallelujah amen see but God knows you because you keep the word of God all right sister Revelation 3 verse 5 the same in white and I will not out his name out of the book of life but I will confess his name before my father and before his angels amen hallelujah so what do you got to do Church you got to overcome your trials in your life you got to overcome leoa and if you overcome Jesus Will will speak for you he won't be ashamed of you hallelujah amen if you can just overcome your trials think about that if you just overcome the little Trials of Our Lives we're not getting hunted down yet right right I mean what's our hardest battle I mean probably cancer like what's America's hardest battle maybe cancer we're not getting uh you know beaten up arrested and dragged all over the land you know all we got to do is overcome the trials that that God has allowed in our lives and then God even said those trials will be for are good amen hallelujah and if we overcome he will confess our name before the father he'll say Irvin Miller I confess your name before my father you overcame Lea enter into the joys of the Lord which were prepared for you before the foundation of the world amen hallelujah thank you Jesus you are faithful in a little I'll make you ruler over much Hallelujah I'm going to preach on the Millennium this summer by God's grace I've been preaching on or I've been studying it Church we don't want to miss the Millennium hallelujah it's going to be awesome it's going to be amazing we don't want to miss it that's your time to rule right now you're not ruling right Joe Biden and all these guys are ruined let them rule but in the Millennium that's our time to rule Jesus said so and the way we the way we rule in the future is by ruling over our sin nature right now that's how you do it you got to rule you got to Reign Over sin in this land right here if you can rule this land he'll make you ruler over the physical lands in the millennial for a thousand years nobody's going to vote you out you're going to be a ruler over a city no one's going to vote you out because Jesus put you in Hallelujah and he's the king and president over the whole world hallelujah amen the son of David amen amen oh my we have so much to look forward to so that's second Jesus alone blots it out also let's go to Deuteronomy uh 29 9 20 so God in the Old Testament said he'd blot out names of course that was the spirit of Jesus right it's the holy spirit it's not two persons same person Deuteronomy 29:20 anyone that says they can't lose their salvation or you can't lose salvation doesn't know the Bible they haven't studied the Bible right or they they'll just they'll deny the verses right but now you and I won't lose our Salvation because we're chosen the Bible said we're chosen to Salvation we're chosen the mind of God we there's no way we can lose it because we're a part of God we're in God's family amen uh Deuteronomy 29:20 the Lord will not spare him but then the anger of the Lord and his jealousy shall smoke against that man and all the curses that are written this book shall lie upon him and the Lord shall blot out his name from under Heaven who's going to blot it out the Lord that's Jehovah right there that capital l o r d That's Jehovah the proper name of god Jehovah Hallelujah the I am that I am also Exodus 32:32 go there Genesis Exodus 32:32 so church I got four verses that say names will be blotted out of the book of life that means people will claim to have life Judas claimed to have life he claimed to be a disciple but then at the end he he forsook it he didn't want it anymore he'd rather have money than have Christ and so his name was blotted off the book of life and brother BR teaches us all the way through the message all the way all right Exodus 32:32 but Daniel you got that brother could you read 3232 yet now if thou will forgive their sin and if not BL the I pray the out of thy book which thou Hast written amen who wrote the book Jesus amen Jesus wrote the book and Moses you know the Israel had sinned so Moses said Lord blot me out and let the people be saved doesn't that sound familiar that's what Paul said in Romans 9:10 he said I wish I could be cursed so my brethren could be saved that's how you know you got the real Spirit of Christ you wish you could be lost so other people could be saved but you're going to be saved don't give up your salvation it's just it's just that desire I just I would do anything to see my family saved I do anything to see my loved one saved Hallelujah that's the spirit of Christ amen but don't forget verse 33 and the Lord said unto Moses whosoever ha sinned against me him will I blot out of my book see it's those who sin against God those are the ones God blots out all right is that clear now can everybody see names get blotted out in the Old Testament and the New Testament everybody can see that okay then you're getting good in the scriptures here hallelujah now there's two scriptures that says names are written before the foundation of the world glory amen just like you were chosen in Christ he also put your name in the book before the foundation of the world before this look at this beautiful world look at this beautiful organic farm and look at this Hills and trees before this was even here your name was already in God's book hallelujah amen amen he already chose you he already predestinated you he knew all about you Hallelujah before you knew anything amen hallelujah go to Revelation 138 so Book of Revelation 138 uh we'll have uh sister Rachel you want to read that good to see our sister Revelation 138 amen is't that beautiful this means only the people that reject the Roman Catholic Church those are the people whose names were on the book of life before the foundational world everybody else that's you know that's with this world system that's rejecting Christ they they're worshiping the Roman system right they're worshiping this current world system right and notice when was when was Christ slain before the foundation of the world in the mind of God God knew I'm GNA to redeem these people I'm GNA have to send a lamb I'm going have to send my son well man said I had to be a kinsman redeemer Hallelujah had to be somebody near to us someone related to us Jesus is related to us amen hallelujah amen he's the first born among many Brethren hallelujah amen I call him brother I call him friend I call him King I call him husband I call him God Amen Hallelujah he's related to us because he became flesh like us then he redeemed us he paid the price all of our sin was placed upon him he died paid the ransom our sin debt the wage of sin is death he paid that debt and now his righteousness comes on us now we're bought back and now we're a part now we can see we're a part of the family of God we couldn't see it before now we see it hallelujah amen Revelation 178 so Revelation 7 sister will you want to read that Revelation 17:8 so we had 138 now we got 178 [Music] and the church said amen we should all say amen that's all and the church said amen amen when was your name written before the foundation of the world everybody else if your name wasn't on The Book of Life they're wondering after the Roman system in this current you know uh China and Russia and United States they're wondering and say what are they going to do next what are they going to they actually care right they care about this human government but Jesus said Satan is in charge of all these kingdoms right right he said worship me and I'll give you all these kingdoms that Jesus never said no they're not your kingdoms they're his kingdoms Satan's in charge of every Kingdom unre Hallelujah but the Bible said you won't worship that system because your name was written before the foundation of the world Hallelujah is anybody enjoying this tonight is anybody enjoying this good okay Hal well good hallelujah amen I hope this was a blessing I had so many different thoughts I was going to preach the Millennium tonight I had so I had all these different thoughts but I thought well I'm going to I feel led I was as I driving down here I felt led to preach on this one here all right now I'm just at a oh I paused it oh man sorry okay now we'll try to finish up here on the Book of Life here section okay now um in Exodus uh 32 we're not going to read it but um yeah we already read it God said whoever sinned against me their names will be blotted out right and then church did you know this Dan and ephraim's names were blotted out under Heaven did you know that it's in the church age book brother preach it in the seventh seal the tribe of Dan and the tri tribe of Ephraim set up Idols in in in the holy land and God blotted their names out right brother teaches it their names were there when they come out of Egypt um but brother but brother shows their names are not listed in Revelation 7 right they're not listed there so in in the future when the 144,000 Jews get the Holy Ghost Dan and Ephraim won't be there but strangely and supernaturally their names are back in in the Millennium Temple which is what I'm going to preach maybe next time by God's grace so they get blotted out for their idolatry but then God lets them back in that talk about Mercy Hallelujah God blots them out under heaven for their adultery but they must repent at some place I don't know and they get back and then in the millennium there will be one of those tribe there be both tribes will be back you can look it up it's in Exodus I'm sorry it's Ezekiel 44 you you'll see it so we have in other words we have examples in the Bible where names are blotted out yeah all right um the other one did you know at Jesus crucifixion some of those people's names were blotted out because they blasphemed Jesus as he was being crucified did you know that that's Psalms uh 69 go to Psalms 69 I want you to see this here Psalm 69 we'll read 21 and 28 Psalm 69 21 and 28 now here's how you know it's talking about Jesus look at verse 21 they gave me also Gall for my meat and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink that sound familiar Jesus said I thirst I thirst and they put the sponge up there right with vinegar and he wouldn't take it now go down to verse 28 God said let them be blotted out of the book of the living and not be written with the righteous this was at the cross now look at this at the cross Jesus said father forgive them so they don't even know what they're doing but the Bible says some of their names were blotted out so what do we see we see as always there's a mixed multitude amen there's Sinners there's Saints there's people receiving Grace and there's people rejecting Grace in the same place Hallelujah so which one are you going to be I'm the one that's going to receive Grace Hallelujah so are you Hallelujah because you love God you love the word of God you love Jesus you love to worship God your heart is to do what's right hallelujah amen so I just gave you three examples from the Old Testament where names are blotted out amen Judas is scar of course is the type of the his name we believe was blotted out brother B says it was blotted out um he had a great ministry of the Holy Ghost but then he forfeited it at the end of his life the Bible said he went to his own place he went to hell he's called son of predition which means Son Of Destruction he was made to be destroyed he didn't overcome sin so Jesus said if you don't overcome remember in Revelation 3:5 Lally read it in Revelation 35 if you don't overcome I'll blot your name out okay Hallelujah so remember you can believe for a while people can believe for a while but they got to believe to the saving of their soul the Bible says hallelujah now brother Ram brother Ram takes uh much time in the church a book to show that God is Not compiling names right now God already wrote the names before the foundation of the world for salvation but I want to show you God does record names for rewards right now go to Malachi 3:15 how many remember this verse Malachi 3:15 brother John you want to read that when you get it Malachi 3:15 so God's not writing down well Daniel got saved so I'm going to write down Daniel's name and Miriam got saved God's not writing God already wrote that before the foundation world but God is keeping track of how much you talk about him glory amen God is writing down how much you Fellowship around the word of God go read it brother right there Mal 3 3:15 y and now we call the proud happy ye they that work wickedness are set up ye that temp God are even delivered is that right that's not right I must have wrote it down wrong then they that feared the Lord go to one another and the Lord heartened and heard it in a book of remembrance was written before him for them that fear the lord and that thought upon his name amen everybody see that and the church said can everybody say amen God said this is 400 years before Jesus God said I've got a book of remembrance so look God's got Book of Life he's got Lamb's Book of Life but he's also got other books over here brother Daniel he's got other books the the angels are going to take off the shelves and say look at all the times Daniel fellowshipped about Jesus look at all the times Lydia and Sarah and Ruth we're talking about the word of God hallelujah amen the Angels said the angels are going down the aisles tonight writing down your requests unreal and God is also keeping track of all the times you talk about the word wasn't that a great service down there in Alabama Sister Sarah when you said you got the Holy Ghost wasn't that a great time and when you whenever you talk about that whenever you testify about that God writes it down amen amen God remembers all the times you talk about those how many times did Brother Iran talked about when God gave me that revelation of the of of the Matthew 16 PA this rock I'll build my brother you know every time he talks about it God remembered it wow God writes it down amen and then he's going to record he's recording the names of all the people that talk about the word of God oh Church let's talk about it more can we amen let's text each other more about the gospel oh you want to hear a testimony God did this and you want to oh this preacher preaches what a blessing here's a sermon you should listen to this it's such a blessing talk about it more because God's writing it down that's what God is writing down right now not your names your names were already on the Book of Life L book of life but God's writing down how much you talk about him for your rewards because the Bible said we will all stand before the Judgment seat of Christ to receive the rewards of eternal life un Hallelujah so your name was already written down but you talk about him now talk about him all the time because all those that fear God your name is put in the book of remembrance Hallelujah and also brother tells us there's one more verse I want to read Psalm 876 not before I'm done but on this section here so I didn't drive here two and a half hours to preach just one hour okay I got to preach a little longer if I'm driving five hours thank you for your patience too uh Psalm 876 brother baham brings us out in the church age book and said now this is really interesting I you know this might deal with uh the Millennium as well 876 brother Ram said there will be a future writing of names it's probably all the people that are born during the Millennium that come up to the house of God yes there's going to be people born there's going to be children born in the Millennium there's going to be death in the Millennium yeah the Bible says it yeah the Bible is plain on this brother Braham said sin doesn't end until after the great right Throne judgment brother Braham said there's sin before the Millennium during the millennium and then after the Millennium the final the final sin is it must be right before the great white Throne judgment right right before that oh yeah that's right the final sin is the Battle of go and Magog at the end of the Millennium that's the final sin Satan gathers all the world all these people that that were living for a thousand years Satan gathers all them deceives them they come against God and Jerusalem but God sends down Holy Fire the Bible said the holy spirit will be a wall of fire around us amen Hallelujah the Holy Ghost protects us now and then at the Battle of God and God the Holy Ghost will protect us there as well Hallelujah with a wall of fire around us amen oh it's beautiful Psalms 876 my wife always says that you say everything's beautiful brother Jesse I know I just that's my word hallelujah now look at verse six Psalm 876 the Lord shall count and he shall writeth up the people that this man was bornn there saah this speaking of the Glorious City if you look up in chapter I'm sorry in verse three the city of God so all the people that were born in Jerusalem the city of God in the Millennium it looks like their names are going to be written down there as well but don't forget your name was written before the foundation of the world in the Lamb's Book of Life because you will not accept the Beast system you to accept the kingdom of Jesus Christ that's what you have accepted amen Now give me maybe 15 more minutes let's finish with this thought on hell is not Eternal I was sharing with brother iring he gave me a good smile so I thought well I'll finish with this by God's grace when I see him smileing know that must be a good Revelation you know CU he gets happy at Revelation so do I now we don't have we have to go all the way through this but um we'll hit the highlights so go to 1 John 3:15 because this really I mean this might have confused us a little bit but it's not we'd say like a major teaching the major thing brother BR said is get saved right and the Holy Ghost those are the majors brother BR said even Divine Healing is a minor he said you can't major on a minor right that's what brother B says in other words your main emphasis should be getting people saved filled with the Holy Ghost and then if they're sick yes pray for the sick brother man you can have Services just dedicated to Healing sick like he did like with perfect faith in 1963 uh desperations 1963 he had all these services for cuz he had a lot of sick people in his church but he said you can't major on those things you have to Major on getting people saved getting people filled with the Holy Ghost amen Now 1 John 3:15 let me read that and this if you just think about this you'll catch the Revelation so almost every Church says Sinners will burn eternally how many have ever heard that raise your hand and I I believe that too before I heard the message once I heard the message I was like how could I miss that what were you thinking you that that's what that's right I wasn't thinking I was just thinking about denominations I just thinking about uh uh you know the their simple lessons they never took us down deep in the word and I found out later the Roman Catholic Church started that Dogma did you know that I wouldn't know it the Roman Catholic Church started father son Holy Ghost they started transubstantiation which is that bread and wine turning into literal body and blood and they also started this that people burn eternally they were trying to scare people into becoming part of the church so they said if you don't come a part of our Catholic Church you're going to burn eternally oo I guess I'll give my money to you preacher or priest right right they tried to scare him into serving God but God does not give us a spirit of fear but a power and love of a sound mind Hallelujah you've been a good audience tonight God you're always a good audience H 1 John 3:15 whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer and now here here it is and you know that no murder hath eternal life abiding in him there's the Revelation now what's the Revelation anyone who dies as a murderer without confessing their sin and being forgiven they don't have eternal life so what does that mean if you have eternal life you can't burn eternally right right in order to burn eternally Without End you got to have a life that can help you to burn eternally right in that beautiful right and the Bible says we are now the sons of God we already have eternal life hallelujah amen when you got the Holy Ghost you've already got a portion of eternal life in your soul because God is life God is love God is a spirit if you got the Holy Spirit you got a portion of eternal life Hallelujah plus you got your name on the Lamb's Book of Life amen my name is in the book of life amen I heard a preacher one time say it was just made me laugh he said God wrote a great book one time and he called it one word life I was like Glory I like that God wrote a book before the foundation world and it was one word on the front life I'm glad my name's in The Book of Life I'm glad he gave me his life hallelujah oh my now we're not going to read it but Revelation 218 says no murder will I'm sorry it says murderers will not have any part in the holy city so see anyone that murders or adultery or fornication these sins if they don't repent of that they'll have no part in God's Eternal City amen and no murderer has eternal life right so brother Ram tells us plainly he says unbelievers do not have eternal life therefore they can't burn eternally now let me read uh I got to find this quote brother Bram gives us a beautiful quote from the church age book here look brother R say it's a beautiful thought brother R says quote now if a sinner is going to go to hell and then suffer the same as you are going to to heaven and enjoy heaven then he has the same kind of life you have already that's why I told Brother Irvin and he had a good smile there before service in other words if a sinner is going to go to the Lake of Fire and suffer the same amount of time as you're going to go to heaven enjoy blessings The Sinner already has the same kind of life you have as a Believer right if he if a sinner is going to burn eternally he's already got the same kind of life that I've got well then why did I need eternal life I mean I'm still either way you're going to live eternally right right and that shows the ridiculous uh the Ridiculousness of that false Doctrine he can't burn eternally because he doesn't have eternal life he never received Christ but if you receive Christ you have eternal life Hallelujah you'd be surprised people look at us say you don't believe they burn eternally how can they burn eternally they don't have eternal life right amen it's just it's so obvious amen hallelujah and I've told people too you you see you call God a god of love and then a god of love is going to let somebody burn for unending years when they only let's say let's say they died at 50 they only had 50 years as a sinner and you God's going to punish them for unending years for just 50 years of crimes no no no no judge would do that in this world right if if you were just caught jaywalking would a judge give you a a life sentence just for one thing of course not that judge has common sense and if that judge has Common Sense how much more does God have amen the Bible said God is a just recompensar of all sins he's fair right God's not going to give you uh let's just say 10 trillion years like that's we can't even fa God's not going to give somebody 10 trillion years of burning in hell just for 50 years of sinning does everybody understand that right and and they say we don't believe God's a god of love I'm like you're the one that doesn't believe God's a god of love you believe God's going to punish people unending for just 50 years I believe in the god of love and mercy hallelujah amen I believe that now I want to actually I want to say this as well uh hell is not the same as the Lake of Fire how many know that hell's not the good good hell's not the same hell is uh the place of Torment it's a prison house Jesus talks about it in Luke 16 right the rich man and Lazarus die both go down to Hell right and there was the paradise there was the Believers and then there was the Sinners and the the rich man said I'm in this flame so he says a flame like one flame and he said uh send Lazarus to get me a drop of water from my tongue right right and the but then the Bible said Jesus went and preached to the souls that were in prison so Jesus went down down and it's a prison house but when Jesus went down he didn't he didn't come up by himself he brought all the saints up out of the heart of the Earth the Bible said he changed Paradise he changed Paradise to the heart of the earth and then he ascended on high and he led them up to heaven now Paradise is in heaven because we've got the blood of Jesus Christ aren't you glad church if somebody dies here a Christian they don't go down they go up hallelujah amen the the Lazarus was taken down by the Angels but now we don't go down we go up Hallelujah we go up to heaven cuz we've got Precious Blood amen amen oh precious is the flow that makes me white as snow no other Fountain I know nothing but the blood of Jesus hallelujah oh thank you Lord now I'm trying to find a spot to close here yeah go to Revelation chapter 20 I'm going to prove it to you because this is what I told brother uran too the Bible says hell gets cast into the Lake of Fire so does death yeah right the angel of death the death angel we talk we hear about that the death angel in Exodus the death angel came to get all the firstborn right right so uh Revelation 20 13- 14 Revelation 201 13- 14 and the Sea gave up the dead which were in it and death and Hell delivered up the dead which were in them and they were judged every man according to their Works see their free more agency verse 14 and death and Hell we're cast into the Lake of Fire this is the second death all right so that that that that place that prison house in the heart of the Earth is going to be taken and thrown into the Lake of Fire and the Lake of Fire will destroy everything Hallelujah all right brother bam said hell had a beginning he said but you and I never had a beginning we were chosen in God before the foundation of the world amen you you are a part you're a thought you're a child of the Eternal one amen hallelujah the Jesus said hell was created or prepared for the devil and his angels hell had a beginning heaven I'm sorry God never had a beginning God's that that's that's what Eternal means you never had a beginning you never have an ending and you were chosen the mind of God before the foundation world you you brother says you're a part of the Eternal one amen glory Jesus all right now that's uh Matthew 25:41 then shall you say also unto them on the left hand depart from me ye curse into Everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels okay so see hell had a beginning but God never had a beginning and you were in God you were chosen the mind of God before the foundation of the world let me find some last few scriptures here I wanted to uh show uh Jesus said uh let's go over how uh Jesus said uh people will be destroyed and then Satan has an ending the Bible says Satan has an ending thank God for that how many you looking for to that day amen no more Satan no more devil no more tempter Hallelujah so uh Jesus said be be aware of the the one who can destroy your soul and Body in hell so let me look that one up I can't find it in my notes if you know it you can uh shout it out but it's uh Matthew 10:28 let's read that Matthew 10:28 brother Dani you want to get that Matthew 10:28 and I'll look up uh about Satan he'll have an end so whenever you're ready brother you can read that and fear not them which kill the body but are not able to kill the soul but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body and Hell amen destroy bring to an end Hallelujah the B brother man calls it Annihilation Satan uh hell death all the demons all the Sinners will be annihilated and there'll be no more I don't know how that works but God must have some type of recycle bin right we got we on our phones we got recycle you delete it it's it's gone I don't know where it is God's got to recycling he's got to delete he created it he can delete it he could create matter and he can destroy matter amen we can amen but God can create it and God can destroy it all right now I'm looking to uh Ezekiel 28 there it is uh yeah go to Ezekiel 28 we'll finish with this you've been a great audience thank you for your patience I don't know how long I preach uh probably long enough by God's grace uh now this score speaking of Satan in verse uh 2813 thou has been an e in the garden of God that's we know Satan possessed The Serpent and the serpent had adultery with Eve right we preached on that verse 14 said Satan used to be the anointed cherub the the angel that covered the The Mercy Seat of God in heaven the Throne of God I believe there was two angels I can't prove this but I believe one was Michael and one was Lucifer cuz that's what Moses had Moses had the Ark of the Covenant there was two angels right there that's what I believe but I could be wrong I'm not it doesn't really matter it doesn't deal with salvation now look at verse 15 Satan was perfect in the in the ways from the day that he was created till iniquity was found in him but look at verse 17 thine heart was lifted up because of his Beauty so you sisters be real careful with your beauty right don't get prideful just because you got a nice smile or you got a you got a nice uh a nice appearance don't let that lift you up and you Brothers if you got big muscles don't let that make you prideful or you got a handsome beard or something you see I try to grow mine out like brother irin I said I'm going to go down and preach them all summer I kind of want to have a beard like him Hallelujah my wife likes or I'm sorry she laughs at it I'm 43 I got eight kids I still can't even grow a full beard what can I say but I we can't we can't let we can't get lifted up because of anything about us we got to remain humble right CU it's beauty that Satan was so beautiful he was so magnificent that that's what caused him to think well I can start my own church I can talk some of these angels into come to my church right the first first church split amen now go down to verse 19 here's where we see it all they that Know Thee among the people shall be astonished at thee Thou shalt be a tear and never shalt thou be anymore unreal there's going to be a day when Satan is no more and guess what you'll still be here Jesus will still be here we'll have unending days with Jesus Christ with no Devil with no demons we'll be free and will be perfectly Eternal with eternal life amen let's stand to our feet God bless you Hallelujah there will be a day when Satan will be here no more Hallelujah and you'll still be here hallelujah amen the Bible says we just go to heaven for a little bit the marriage supper and then we come back down for the Millennium and after that the future home comes down and then we're always going to be here on the earth living together enjoying Jesus enjoying one another brother we can Fellowship 10,000 years and
