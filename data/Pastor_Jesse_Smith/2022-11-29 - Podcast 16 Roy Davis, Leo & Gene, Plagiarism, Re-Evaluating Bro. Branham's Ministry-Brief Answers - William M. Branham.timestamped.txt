[0:10] God bless you and welcome to the
[0:12] defending the message podcast I'm your
[0:15] co-host Pastor Jesse Smith our other
[0:17] co-host brother amen is not available
[0:20] for recording today as he has had a
[0:22] change in his working schedule so I'll
[0:24] be hosting this podcast solo
[0:27] the purpose of this podcast is to answer
[0:29] questions some listeners and viewers
[0:31] have had over these last few months and
[0:34] these questions sent around a few people
[0:36] that were connected to brother Brandon's
[0:38] Ministry
[0:39] in particular we're going to look at Roy
[0:41] Davis Leo and Gene the tape boys
[0:44] and then we'll look at two other areas
[0:45] plagiarism and the need to reevaluate
[0:49] brother branham's Ministry
[0:51] over the last few months I've had
[0:52] numerous people contact me with
[0:54] questions about the ministry of brother
[0:56] Branham and we're always happy to take
[0:58] any question by the grace of God because
[1:00] we believe if we have the truth that
[1:02] we're not afraid of any question so I've
[1:05] noticed over these past few months that
[1:06] I've had some of the same questions come
[1:08] up and then in particular I had a phone
[1:10] call with a precious brother a couple
[1:12] weeks ago and perhaps this brother's
[1:14] listening now and I appreciate his
[1:16] sincerity and I appreciate his questions
[1:18] and obviously the whole point of our
[1:20] podcast is to defend the message which
[1:22] is the Bible revelations that God gave
[1:24] to his Prophet brother William Branham
[1:27] and so this phone conversation was
[1:28] perhaps the origin of the idea for this
[1:31] podcast
[1:32] so I appreciate the brother calling me
[1:34] and asking these sincere legitimate
[1:36] questions and I try to remember as much
[1:38] as I could about the conversation
[1:41] so I could share them on a podcast and
[1:42] hopefully this will help out other
[1:43] people as well by the grace of God
[1:46] before we get into each subject I just
[1:47] want to say that I've not devoted to
[1:49] substantial time to studying Roy Davis
[1:52] and Leo and Jean but it's not really
[1:54] necessary for me to do that and the
[1:57] reason for that is because I've listened
[1:59] to many of brother Ram's tapes and we
[2:01] can easily search his recorded sermons
[2:03] to find brother Ram's own words about
[2:06] these men and I believe brother Ram's
[2:08] own words vindicate him as being an
[2:11] honest sincere man a true Holy Ghost
[2:13] Field Saint and also a genuine prophet
[2:15] of God
[2:16] the sad part is a lot of these
[2:18] accusations against brother Branham are
[2:19] based upon presumptions brother Ram's
[2:22] accusers are often jumping to
[2:23] conclusions and it's my personal opinion
[2:26] they're trying to create scarecrows to
[2:28] scare people away from listening to
[2:29] brother Branham to keep people away from
[2:31] the word of God and hearing the true
[2:33] Bible revelations that he preached so
[2:36] with that being said we'll get into our
[2:37] first subject and by God's grace I'll
[2:39] give brief answers about each subject
[2:42] and hopefully this will be a blessing to
[2:43] you
[2:50] the first subject is Roy Davis now it's
[2:52] clear from listening to brother Ram's
[2:54] tapes that Roy Davis ordained him as a
[2:56] minister some of the recent accusations
[2:58] against Roy Davis have been that he was
[3:00] a leader in the KKK married three times
[3:03] had multiple arrests imprisonments many
[3:06] money laundering schemes and many more
[3:09] evil accusations against him these seem
[3:11] to be true through the limited reading
[3:13] I've done about his life but again I
[3:15] wasn't there I wasn't a witness of Roy
[3:18] Davis's life and his decisions but it
[3:21] seems overall there's a lot of evidence
[3:23] against him that he was an awful evil
[3:25] man and so the accusation against
[3:27] brother Branham is how could brother
[3:28] Branham be involved with a man like Roy
[3:30] Davis and the accusers would say isn't
[3:33] brother braham's involvement with Roy
[3:35] Davis proof that brother Branham was not
[3:37] a genuine prophet of God and of course
[3:39] my answer to that is no for a number of
[3:41] reasons first it's clear brother Branham
[3:43] lived a clean life in all honesty and
[3:46] Holiness and this proves brother Ryan
[3:48] was indeed baptized with the Holy Ghost
[3:49] and his soul and the spirit of Jesus
[3:51] Christ lived in his life and brother
[3:53] Bram lived free from scandals and was a
[3:57] true servant of God
[3:58] a second point is that it's a good sign
[4:00] that brother random separated himself
[4:02] from Roy Davis in one quote from Brother
[4:05] Branham from 1965 brother Branham said
[4:07] he broke away from Roy Davis he said
[4:10] quote that's exactly how I broke away
[4:11] from the missionary baptist Dr Roy E
[4:14] Davis end quote that's exactly how I
[4:18] broke away from
[4:19] the missionary baptist
[4:22] Dr Roy E Davis how many ever heard him
[4:24] sure he did you want to ordain some
[4:26] women preachers and I said no sir as an
[4:29] elder I said I cannot do that
[4:30] consciously it's against the word of God
[4:33] so I looked up Roy Davis in the message
[4:35] software and there's only 14 quotes
[4:37] about him and brother Branham rarely if
[4:39] ever promoted him his lifestyle or his
[4:43] teachings so it seems to me that perhaps
[4:45] brother Ram did not know all the evil
[4:47] that Roy Davis was involved in
[4:50] it's likely brother Branham did not know
[4:52] the full extent of Davis's wickedness
[4:54] since they weren't together after
[4:56] brother Branham broke away from Davis
[4:58] there's so many quotes from Brother
[4:59] Branham where he condemned preachers
[5:01] committing adultery and condemned all
[5:03] the sins Davis was guilty of so brother
[5:06] Branham would have never supported
[5:07] Davis's sinful lifestyle
[5:10] and again we'll never know for sure
[5:11] because brother Brown is not here to
[5:13] answer the question so we don't want to
[5:14] jump to conclusions and that's what
[5:16] brother Adam's accusers are guilty of
[5:17] jumping to conclusions so that seems to
[5:20] be the most likely answer that brother
[5:21] Ram did not know about all of Roy
[5:23] Davis's evil habits and sinful decisions
[5:26] that he made another possibility is that
[5:28] perhaps brother Ram knew a little bit
[5:29] about Roy Davis's sins and because of
[5:32] brother Ram's Christian character he
[5:34] tried not to speak evil about people
[5:35] there's numerous quotes from Brother
[5:37] Branham like this where brother Branham
[5:39] says if you see your brother or you see
[5:41] a believer in sin don't repeat it so
[5:44] it's possible brother random was
[5:45] practicing what he preached and not
[5:47] sharing the evil things that he knew
[5:49] about Roy Davis's life but again this is
[5:52] just presumption as well we really don't
[5:53] know what brother Ram knew about Roy
[5:55] Davis's life my final Point regarding
[5:58] Roy Davis is that it seems likely that
[6:00] Roy Davis manifested evil fruits after
[6:03] he separated himself from Brother
[6:05] Branham or brother Branham separated
[6:07] himself from Roy Davis and this would
[6:09] make Roy Davis more of like a Judas
[6:11] Iscariot type of Personality where
[6:13] perhaps for a Time Roy Davis was sincere
[6:15] but then did despite the spirit of Grace
[6:17] and trampled underfoot the Son of God
[6:19] afresh as the scripture says and Jesus
[6:21] even talked about it in the parable of
[6:23] the four grounds how someone can believe
[6:25] for a while they can receive the seed of
[6:27] God for a while they can believe for a
[6:29] while but if there's no root of love in
[6:31] their heart for the word of God they'll
[6:33] be offended by the word of God and the
[6:34] seed of God cannot grow in their life
[6:36] they'll fail to move on with God and
[6:38] eventually be lost
[6:40] so I'm not judging Roy Davis's Eternal
[6:42] destination Only God can judge that but
[6:45] based upon all the information about his
[6:47] evil deeds and evil lifestyle it seems
[6:50] likely that he was a Judas Iscariot type
[6:52] of person but we cannot assume brother
[6:54] Branham was an evil person just because
[6:56] Roy E Davis was an evil person just like
[6:59] we cannot assume Jesus was an evil
[7:01] person because Judas Iscariot was an
[7:03] evil person we cannot assume guilt by
[7:06] association of course the Lord Jesus
[7:08] Christ was the Holy One of Israel the
[7:10] Messiah God and flesh so Judas Iscariot
[7:13] had the greatest Pastor the greatest
[7:14] leader you could ever have yet he turned
[7:16] out to be a devil because he let Satan
[7:19] enter into his heart and perhaps that's
[7:21] the same thing that happened with Roy
[7:22] Davis perhaps he had a good heart at one
[7:24] point but after brother Brandon broke
[7:25] away from him perhaps Satan entered into
[7:28] his heart and again no one can prove Roy
[7:30] Davis's Eternal destination one way or
[7:33] the other he's not here to defend
[7:34] himself nor is brother Brandon here to
[7:36] defend himself so I hope these answers
[7:38] have been to help regarding the subject
[7:39] of Roy Davis I do not believe it is fair
[7:42] to make brother random guilty for having
[7:44] association with Roy Davis just as it's
[7:47] not fair to make Jesus guilty for having
[7:49] association with Judas Iscariot I do not
[7:52] see any proof that brother Branham was a
[7:54] partaker in Roy Davis's sins and so to
[7:57] me brother Brandon is still a genuine
[7:59] prophet of God a prophet who was
[8:01] baptized with the Holy Ghost was a true
[8:03] servant of God and it's sad for me that
[8:05] Roy Davis chose such a sinful life
[8:07] because it brought such a reproach upon
[8:09] the name of Christ but brother random
[8:11] chose a holy life and that Holy life
[8:13] brings glory to Jesus Christ
[8:15] foreign
[8:20] next we'll look at the subject of Leo
[8:22] and Gene these were the two Tate boys
[8:24] that joined brother Ram's Ministry and
[8:26] often traveled with brother Branham in
[8:28] order to record his sermons so the
[8:31] current accusation is that Leo and Gene
[8:34] were extremely Wicked and abusive men
[8:36] now the evidence I've seen on that seems
[8:39] to be true that these men were guilty of
[8:41] abuse on top of other Wicked sins as
[8:44] well accusers of brother Branham are
[8:46] saying because Leo and Gene were wicked
[8:48] men brother Brianna must have been a
[8:49] wicked man as well so again just like
[8:51] the Roy Davis subject people are making
[8:53] brother Raynham guilty based upon his
[8:56] association with Leo and Gene So my
[8:58] answer to this was very similar to Roy
[9:00] Davis it seems Leo and Jean lived at
[9:02] least a clean life while brother Brandon
[9:05] was alive we don't hear anything on tape
[9:07] where brother Brown spoke evil about
[9:08] them and brother Ram did not separate
[9:10] himself from them like he did Roy Davis
[9:12] so from the evidence that's on the tape
[9:14] brother Branham was supportive of Leo
[9:16] and Jean and what they were doing making
[9:18] tape recordings and then also setting up
[9:20] a park in Prescott Arizona and brother
[9:23] Ram said positive things about them that
[9:25] they were trying to lead the people to
[9:27] serve Jesus Christ and this is all the
[9:30] proof that we have on tape from Brother
[9:31] Brown's life and it seems to say that
[9:33] Leo and Gene were living clean while
[9:35] brother random was alive after brother
[9:37] Ram's death though it seems Leo and Gene
[9:40] became Wicked sinful and abusive men and
[9:42] a lot of accusations are coming out
[9:44] about them of course this is
[9:46] heartbreaking all of our hearts go out
[9:48] to anyone who's been abused in any shape
[9:51] or matter any genuine Christian does not
[9:53] support any type of abuse brother
[9:56] Branham never supported abuse I've never
[9:58] supported abuse and no genuine Christian
[10:00] minister I've ever known in the message
[10:02] or outside the message has ever
[10:04] supported abuse So based upon the
[10:06] evidence on brother Ram's tapes it seems
[10:08] like Leo and Gene live clean while
[10:10] brother Brandon was alive but after
[10:12] brother Brown passed away it seems Leon
[10:14] Jean let Satan enter into their hearts
[10:16] perhaps like Roy Davis did therefore Leo
[10:19] and Jean would fall in the same category
[10:21] as Roy Davis
[10:23] they heard the seed word of God that
[10:25] brother man was preaching from the word
[10:26] of God and they believed it for a while
[10:28] but after a while they were offended and
[10:30] they did despite the spirit of Grace and
[10:32] trodden underfoot the Son of God afresh
[10:34] if God did not show brother Branham the
[10:36] future regarding Roy Davis and Leo and
[10:38] Gene how could brother Brandon know we
[10:40] can't make brother random guilty of not
[10:42] knowing the future if God didn't show
[10:43] him the future brother Branham only
[10:45] supported holy living brother Branham
[10:47] would never support abuse domestic
[10:49] violence or any other sin
[10:52] so my conclusion is that we cannot make
[10:54] brother random Guilty By Association we
[10:57] cannot say brother Brandon was an evil
[10:58] man because some of his followers turned
[11:01] out to be evil men because if we do that
[11:03] again we have to make Jesus evil because
[11:05] of what Judas Iscariot turned out to be
[11:07] but of course Jesus Christ was holy
[11:09] without sin the Son of God God manifests
[11:12] in the flesh and so we do not make Jesus
[11:14] Guilty by association with Judas
[11:16] Iscariot the same is true we do not make
[11:18] brother random guilty for being
[11:19] associated with people who eventually
[11:21] chose to sin and again I think the
[11:23] apparent Wicked lives of Roy Davis and
[11:25] Leo and Gene are an absolute disgrace
[11:28] it's heartbreaking it's wicked it's
[11:30] abominable but that does not mean
[11:32] brother Branham agreed with their
[11:34] decisions and there's no evidence on
[11:36] tape that shows brother random agreed
[11:38] with any of their sinful decisions
[11:39] because brother Branham would condemn
[11:41] any of those sinful decisions just as
[11:43] the Bible condemns those Wicked
[11:45] decisions so I hope this brief answer is
[11:48] a help to those who have questions about
[11:49] Leo and Gene and of course you can
[11:51] contact me with any questions or
[11:53] concerns regarding Roy E Davis and Leo
[11:55] and Gene
[12:01] the next subject is plagiarism
[12:04] when I was talking with his precious
[12:05] brother he asked me what do you feel
[12:07] about brother Branham and the subject of
[12:09] plagiarism
[12:10] and I said the accusation that brother
[12:12] random is a plagiarist is off the table
[12:14] in my mind and in my humble opinion I've
[12:18] put many many hours into studying
[12:20] brother Ram's teachings on the seven
[12:21] Church ages the Seven Seals Daniel 70
[12:24] weeks and the future home and already I
[12:27] believe I have three resources that
[12:29] prove this I have two YouTube videos
[12:31] that will be helpful to you if you
[12:32] haven't seen them in the first one I go
[12:34] through all four of those subjects and
[12:36] show how brother Ram was not a
[12:37] plagiarist the video is over an hour
[12:39] long
[12:40] is called Clarence Larkin William
[12:42] Branham and the plagiarism accusation
[12:44] defending Jesus messenger it's video
[12:46] number 85 it was released June 30th of
[12:49] 2021
[12:51] and just last week I put out a second
[12:53] YouTube video about this topic called
[12:54] Jesus revealed the first seal to brother
[12:57] Branham not plagiarize from Larkin and
[12:59] Russell to video number 131 released on
[13:03] November 25th 2022.
[13:05] and the third resource is a podcast I
[13:07] recorded earlier this year it was from
[13:10] April 27th actually 2022 and the title
[13:13] was Seven Seals plagiarized no Jesus
[13:16] revealed Seven Seals to Branham so
[13:19] through the many hours I put into
[13:20] studying brother Ram's teachings and
[13:23] also the teachings of Clarence Larkin
[13:24] Charles Tay's Russell and Uriah Smith I
[13:27] can truly say brother Branham was not a
[13:28] plagiarist yes it's true brother Branham
[13:31] used some of Larkin's ideas but brother
[13:34] Brian I'm plainly admitted it as those
[13:36] resources will show if you take time and
[13:38] listen to them or watch them brother
[13:40] random thanked Larkin for his work
[13:42] brother Branham admitted to reading
[13:43] Larkin's books and regarding the topic
[13:46] of the Seven Seals brother random only
[13:48] agreed with Larkin on one seal and it
[13:50] was The Sixth Seal for the random partly
[13:53] agreed with Larkin on the fifth seal but
[13:55] there were differences and so there's no
[13:57] real proof to say brother Brandon
[13:59] plagiarized any authors
[14:01] to me it's clear the Lord Jesus Christ
[14:03] met him just as he said and revealed to
[14:06] him the true revelation of the church
[14:07] ages the Seven Seals Daniel 70 weeks and
[14:10] the future home
[14:12] now regarding the future home as I've
[14:13] already said it seems brother Branham
[14:15] forgot to cite Clarence Larkin as
[14:17] there's at least eight exact quotes
[14:19] where brother Brandon was using Larkin's
[14:21] work and my 2021 video shares that
[14:24] clearly it seems very likely brother
[14:26] Brandon forgot to cite Larkin because
[14:27] all his previous behaviors showed that
[14:30] he was very happy to cite his resources
[14:33] brother Ram's accusers use one quote
[14:35] from Brother Branham in which brother
[14:37] Ram said he got his Revelation about the
[14:39] future home from the Lord but as I
[14:41] showed on that 2021 video in context
[14:44] brother Ryan was talking about the
[14:46] divine revelation that the earth goes
[14:48] through three works of Grace just as the
[14:51] believer goes through three works of
[14:52] Grace and so brother Ram's divine
[14:54] revelation was something that Larkin did
[14:56] not teach because I've searched Larkin's
[14:59] work and Larkin never taught three works
[15:01] of Grace justification sanctification
[15:03] and the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[15:05] and then recently as I said last week I
[15:08] put out the video about the first seal
[15:09] it is completely undeniable that brother
[15:12] Brown did not plagiarize Charles stays
[15:14] Russell and Clarence Larkin regarding
[15:16] the first seal on that video I showed
[15:19] screenshots from Russell and Larkin's
[15:21] books so it's undeniable that brother
[15:23] random did not plagiarize them brother
[15:25] random differed especially on the timing
[15:27] of the first seal with Larkin by over 2
[15:30] 000 years and differed with Russell on
[15:33] his timing of the first seal by over 140
[15:35] years and the identity of the Riders
[15:37] were different and also the identity of
[15:40] the first Beast was different so there's
[15:43] absolutely no proof that brother Branham
[15:45] was a plagiarist and so we can believe
[15:47] brother random received his Revelations
[15:48] from the Lord Jesus Christ because
[15:50] they're absolutely scriptural whereas
[15:52] the teachings of Uriah Smith Larkin and
[15:54] Russell sometimes break the scriptures
[15:56] and brother Branham gave us some of
[15:57] these Revelations on the church ages and
[15:59] the seals with thus saith the Lord
[16:01] and none of those other three men did so
[16:04] we're grateful for the Lord Jesus Christ
[16:06] and how he revealed the true revelation
[16:08] of the church ages and seals to brother
[16:10] Bynum who preached them to us and now we
[16:13] have thus saith the Lord on these
[16:14] subjects
[16:20] lastly I was asked by a precious brother
[16:22] if I would re-evaluate brother random's
[16:25] role or Ministry now for myself I do not
[16:28] feel like I need to reevaluate brother
[16:30] Ram's position or role in the body of
[16:33] Christ I still believe as I have for the
[16:35] last 21 years that brother Branham was a
[16:38] genuine prophet of God I believe he was
[16:40] the seventh Church age messenger I
[16:43] believe he was the seventh angel of
[16:44] Revelation 10 7. I believe he was the
[16:47] restoration Prophet Anointed with the
[16:49] spirit of Elijah as Jesus taught in
[16:50] Matthew 17 verse 11 and as the book of
[16:53] Acts records in Acts 3 verses 20 through
[16:55] 21 I wrote an entire chapter about this
[16:58] in my 2021 book The 12 New Testament
[17:01] Mysteries revealed in his chapter 13
[17:03] called Elijah shall restore all things
[17:06] and in that chapter I show six passages
[17:09] of scripture that prove God had to send
[17:11] brother Branham with the spirit of
[17:12] Elijah to restore all the Bible
[17:14] doctrines and turn the hearts of
[17:16] Believers back to the apostolic fathers
[17:18] in other words the true Revel relation
[17:21] that Jesus Christ revealed to Paul at
[17:23] the beginning
[17:23] in that 13th chapter of the book I show
[17:26] the historical evidence for brother
[17:27] braham's restoration Ministry which
[17:29] includes healings and discernments the
[17:31] return of the pillar of fire the return
[17:34] of thus saith the Lord thus say the
[17:36] Lord's statements regarding Doctrine
[17:37] fulfilled prophecies and three
[17:40] prophecies in the process of coming to
[17:41] pass future prophecies would thus saith
[17:44] the Lord Brother Ram's Elijah
[17:46] characteristics and I show how William
[17:47] Branham was not Jesus
[17:49] and William Branham was not a charlatan
[17:51] and how God used brother Branham to
[17:54] finish the mystery of God which are 12
[17:56] New Testament mystery doctrines so I
[17:59] told the brother I was speaking with on
[18:00] the phone I do not need to reevaluate
[18:02] brother branham's place but I believe
[18:04] lots of people should especially those
[18:06] people who are part of the tape Church
[18:07] Ministry they need to re-evaluate
[18:10] brother Branham and stop calling brother
[18:12] Branham the greatest prophet of all time
[18:13] because they're essentially making
[18:15] brother random equal to Jesus Christ
[18:17] they're making every word on brother
[18:19] Ram's tapes thus saith the Lord which is
[18:21] idolatry they are guilty of making
[18:23] brother Branham and his tapes divine
[18:25] so anyone that exalted brother Branham
[18:27] or worshiped brother Branham who was
[18:29] anointed with the evil deity spirit yes
[18:31] they would need to reevaluate brother
[18:32] branham's position and make him a
[18:35] prophet but also make him a sinner Say
[18:37] by grace who is fallible brother Ram
[18:40] said it was Tommy rot and one of the
[18:41] most awful things to make him infallible
[18:44] and on the other side of the spectrum I
[18:46] would tell people to reevaluate brother
[18:48] Branham if you have considered him not
[18:50] to be a prophet again and I would use
[18:52] all that evidence in the 13th chapter of
[18:55] my 2021 book The 12 New Testament
[18:57] Mysteries revealed and this is not a
[18:59] plug for anyone to buy my book I'm not
[19:01] trying to make money off the books you
[19:03] can listen to chapter 13 for free I did
[19:05] an audiobook version of chapter 13 and
[19:07] you can listen to it for free on YouTube
[19:09] if someone can't afford the book I'll be
[19:11] happy to send them a free copy and the
[19:13] sad part about those who have left the
[19:15] message is that I have offered numerous
[19:17] people who've left the message a free
[19:19] copy of my books but they will not
[19:21] accept them they will not read them I
[19:23] think it's sad and also perhaps cowardly
[19:25] that they will not read my work on
[19:28] brother Brandon's Ministry but yet I'll
[19:29] read their work and I'll listen to their
[19:31] podcast and I'll watch their videos so I
[19:34] think it's disingenuous of them to say
[19:35] they're dedicated researchers or or
[19:38] honest researchers that they won't even
[19:39] look into the other side of the subject
[19:41] they won't even look into my research
[19:43] and my Bible verses that I've used to
[19:45] show how God used brother Branham as a
[19:47] genuine prophet of God
[19:48] so in conclusion on this subject I would
[19:50] say I do not need to reevaluate brother
[19:52] Ram's position because God has
[19:55] Vindicated him as a genuine prophet of
[19:56] God and Elijah anointed Prophet who
[19:59] finished the mystery of God who turned
[20:01] our hearts back to the apostolic fathers
[20:02] just as brother Branham said at the end
[20:04] of the church age book his one goal in
[20:06] life was to nurture a true relationship
[20:08] between man and God and that's what
[20:10] brother Brown's Ministry has done for me
[20:11] it has made Jesus Christ a living
[20:13] reality in my life and my greatest love
[20:16] is for the Lord Jesus Christ and his
[20:18] word and every day I want to die to
[20:20] myself so I can manifest more of Jesus
[20:22] Christ in my life
[20:23] that's the legacy of the ministry of
[20:25] William Branham in my life and in my
[20:27] family and also in our home Church
[20:35] well friends we've come to the end of
[20:36] this podcast I hope this was a blessing
[20:38] I just wanted to put out a short podcast
[20:40] with brief answers about the subjects of
[20:42] Roy Davis Leo and Jean plagiarism and
[20:45] re-evaluating brother Bynum I'm
[20:47] certainly happy to accept questions and
[20:49] comments and feedback whether positive
[20:51] or negative the Bible says iron sharpens
[20:53] iron so questions are only going to make
[20:56] us more certain of the truth of God's
[20:58] word now of course my time is limited so
[21:00] if you share a question with me it may
[21:02] take months for me to address that
[21:04] question but we know God makes
[21:06] everything beautiful in his own time so
[21:07] if we can just be patient and wait upon
[21:09] the Lord the Bible says the Lord will
[21:10] renew our strength and that's what I've
[21:13] seen in my life I've been following the
[21:14] end time bible message of brother
[21:16] Branham for 21 years and of course I'm
[21:18] human I have questions like everybody
[21:19] else but as I wait on the Lord he renews
[21:21] my strength he always points me back to
[21:23] the scriptures he helps me to avoid
[21:26] false assumptions and just as Jesus
[21:28] promised he adds all things unto me and
[21:31] to all those who follow him who seek Him
[21:33] First his kingdom and his righteousness
[21:36] so may the Lord Jesus Christ bless you
[21:38] thank you for listening to this and
[21:39] downloading this I hope it's been a help
[21:40] to you and may God anoint you to defend
[21:42] the message
[21:43] good afternoon friends
[21:45] very happy to be here this afternoon and
[21:48] again in the defense of the Gospel of
[21:49] Jesus Christ
[21:51] to bring the Good Tidings the good news
[21:53] that Jesus raised from the dead living
[21:55] among man
[22:04] that it never fake
