Description:
Part 3 of this series finishes by describing the final eight of the 14 attributes of "Mystery Babylon" - who we believe is the Roman Catholic Church. You will discover her colors, wealth, wars of conquest, status as a great city, how she rides the Beast, the Mark of the Beast, the Image of the Beast, and her false prophet.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] her colors Revelation 17 ver4 said she was arrayed in scarlet and purple it is common to see priests and archbishops and even the pope frequently dressed in these colors based upon annual festivals holy days and other occasions her wealth Revelation 17:4 also said she was AR raay with gold precious stones and pearls and had a Gold Cup in her hand the Bible portrays this woman or church as a wealthy Church the Vatican receives Free Will donations from more than 1 billion Catholics worldwide the Vatican also earns interest on its Investments and has flocks of tourists and visitors for its museums Galleries and libraries which hold their Priceless collections the mass Services of the Roman Catholic Church showcase golden cups instruments with precious stones just as the Bible foretold drunken with the blood of the Saints Revelation 17:6 said she was drunken with the blood of the Saints and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus can it be possible that the Roman Catholic Church is responsible for the deaths of millions of true Christian Believers We Believe yes history proves that there was much corruption in the Roman Catholic church and poy during the Roman Empire and middle or dark ages Protestant historians record medieval Roman Catholic Church practices in the most negative terms and recall the massive Corruption of Catholic church leaders including adulteries bribes extravagant papal art and architecture projects and most destructive Wars of Conquest Samuel s Schmucker authored the Glorious reformation and detailed the horrifying tyranny and persecution of the Roman Catholic Church during the Dark Ages estimating that the Roman Catholic Church was responsible for the deaths of nearly 68 million Christians who descended from the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church the beginning of this violent Spirit towards non-roman Catholics can be found in the writings of St Augustine of Hippo according to how did it happen by r hasseltine when St hippo wrote that it was much better that some should perish by their own fires than that the whole body should burn in the Everlasting flames of gehenna through the desert of their impious dissensions popes had no fear killing people who dissented with them the attitude of the Roman Catholic Church was recorded as first invite then compel if they will not come into the first Roman Church By Invitation then compel them to come in by any means even though it be by by torture or by death the Catholic Inquisition and Crusades are undeniable historical examples of the Roman Catholic Church being drunken with the blood of the Saints just as the Bible foretold a great City Revelation 17:18 said the woman or Harlot church is that great City that Reigns over the kings of the earth what other church can claim to be a great City and have influence politically and spiritually over the Earth's leaders of other than the Vatican City which includes the Roman Catholic church and her Pope the Vatican City state is the epitome of church and state the Vatican City is the ecclesiastical state seat of the Roman Catholic Church situated on the West Bank of the Tyber River Vatican City is the world's smallest fully independent nation state this city state is taxfree and has its own telephone system postal office Gardens astronomical Observatory radio station banking system and Pharmacy as well as a contingent of Swiss guards responsible for the personal safety of the Pope since 1506 rides the Beast Revelation 17:3 said that this woman or church rides the [Music] Beast first we Define the Beast as the spirit of Rome or the evil spirit behind the kingdom of Rome based upon Daniel 231 1-45 and 7:23 the fourth Beast shall be the fourth Kingdom upon the Earth Daniel 2 described an image or statue that had four sections and the Bible described the top two sections as the kingdom of Babylon Daniel 238 head of gold and the kingdom of the mes and Persians Daniel 528 breast of silver history tells us that the thighs of brass was the Grecian Empire led by Alexander the Great lastly the legs of iron were the Roman Empire and feet of iron and Clay were Roman Catholics and Protestants notice that the feed of iron and Clay lasted until the end time when the stone cut out of the mountain which is the Lord Jesus returns to destroy the Gentile kingdoms that Daniel foresaw and recorded for us this church the Roman Catholic Church rides the power of the original evil spirit of the pagan Roman government that divided and conquered and still seeks to conquer and Lord over anyone and everyone All Nations peoples multitudes and tongues God's true prophet of this day William brandham spoke with thus sayith the Lord that Rome would rule in the end times and conquer the world before the return of Jesus Christ to the Earth God's word Can't Fail romanism is going to conquer the world Amen let's take Daniel's Vision that's the word of God King Nebuchadnezzar is a head of gold B another kingdom of sued D which is silver see which is me of Persia another was gree Alexander the Great next come in Rome and there was nothing said about a communism Rome conquered the world the confederation of churches organizing themselves together it isn't Russia it's Rome that's the Lord the mark of the beast Revelation 13: 16-18 teaches that the mark of the beast or the mark of the Roman spirit will be in their right hand or in their foreheads the Bible teaches that no man can buy or sell without the Mark or the name of the Beast or the number of his name the mark in the right hand means that all people including church members will have to do the will of the One World Church system or others can take a mark in their foreheads which means they will take the doctrine of the World Church system which includes trinitarianism universalism and other doctrines not found in scripture the image of the Beast since the Beast or Spirit of Rome is invisible the Bible predicts the Beast will make an image for itself the image of the Beast will be a worldwide ecumenical council wherein all the organized churches will get together in a union with the Roman Catholic Church it seems likely that the World Council of churches will be a part of this image unto the Beast as this organization represents nearly 500 million Christians and literally seeks visible Unity or an image for Christians yet without a unity in true Doctrine so it cannot be true Unity since Jesus taught that the heavenly father seeks true worshippers who Worship in spirit and in truth so then these churches who reject the truth of the Bible for the sake of a false Unity manifest that they are true Daughters of the mother Harlot the Roman Catholic Church the false prophet Revelation 19: 20 and chap 20:10 mention a false prophet that is closely connected to the Beast or Spirit of Rome the false prophet is called a man since a prophet is one who speaks for God we conclude that the one man who claims to speak for God God and is false in his Doctrine and is closely connected to the spirit of Rome is the pope of the Roman Catholic Church the CCC teaches that the pope has the authority of Christ and has an infallibility in virtue of his office when he teaches the word of God yet as we have already showed the pope and his church are filled with false Doctrine thus making his office the false prophet connected to the Beast or Roman spirit as we mentioned earlier one specific sinful Act is that of giving the Pope the title of Holy Father the title Holy Father is used only one time in the Bible St John 17:1 Jesus called God himself Holy Father so for the recent popes to take that title so easily and without reservation shows their blind spiritual condition it is plain to see that the pope is exalted above God for he robs god of the very title that the son of God gave to his eternal father we believe the false prophet is the same office as what is generally called the Antichrist or the person who will rule deceive and influence the entire world at the end of the world 2 Thessalonians 2: 3-13 teaches on the Antichrist calling him the man of sin the son of predition and that Wicked This false prophet will oppose God and exalt himself above all that is called God which would be the word of God he will sit in the very temple of God making himself receive worship as God the Bible goes on to say he will have Satan's power and signs and lying wonders just as the false prophet was said to work miracles in Revelation 19:20 this Antichrist will deceive with unrighteousness and lies and he will allow his followers to live in the pleasures of sin according to 2 Thessalonians 210 111 and 12 but those who overcome him will be Believers and lovers of Truth in closing we believe this short video has presented enough Bible proof as to the identity of mystery Babylon who is the Roman Catholic church we cannot find any other church that meets the 14 requirements listed on this video our prayer is that you and anyone you know involved with the mother Church the Roman Catholic church or any of her daughter churches who uphold many of the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church such as the Trinity Doctrine will come out of their Creeds and man-made doctrines and into Christ the revealed word of God for this hour May the elect of God hear the voice from Heaven saying come out of her my people that you be not partakers of her sins and that you receive not of her plagues for her sins have reached unto heaven and God hath remembered her iniquities come out of idolatry man worship blast against God Heaven and the Saints and come into the merciful matchless grace of our Lord Jesus Christ based upon the word of God only if You' like more information about mystery Babylon and the Roman Catholic Church please contact us God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
