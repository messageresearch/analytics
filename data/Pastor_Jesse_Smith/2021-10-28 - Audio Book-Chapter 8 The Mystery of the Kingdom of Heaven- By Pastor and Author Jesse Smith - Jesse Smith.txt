TRANSCRIPT
========================================
chapter 8 the mystery of the kingdom of heaven chapter 8 contains footnotes numbers 1167-1453 he answered and said unto them because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given matthew 13 verse 11 in the four gospels of matthew mark luke and john jesus teaches 16 parable mysteries related to the kingdom of heaven knowing the meaning of each parable gives you a complete understanding of god's new testament kingdom you are able to see your individual role in god's kingdom the kingdom's enemies and also how the kingdom continues until the consummation of human history to begin with the kingdom of heaven is not a physical kingdom on earth but a spiritual one at this moment the kingdoms of this world like russia the united states and china are not the kingdoms of our lord jesus christ but one day they will be jesus tells us the location of the kingdom of heaven in luke 17 verse 21 behold the kingdom of god is within you god's kingdom or dominion or rule in the greek lexicon is inside the soul of the believer as the baptism of the holy ghost see chapter 6 paul teaches when a person is born again he is translated into the kingdom of his dear son this means the kingdom of heaven first came into believer's souls on the day of pentecost previous to pentecost the kingdom of heaven was at hand but not yet in believer's souls according to matthew chapter 3 verses 1 and 2 in those days came john the baptist preaching in the wilderness of judea and saying repent ye for the kingdom of heaven is at hand jesus preached the same truth in matthew 4 verse 17. repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand since the holy ghost has been pouring out for nearly 2 000 years jesus has wisely designed for born-again christians to rule and reign in the kingdom of heaven while living in the earthly kingdoms of men satan is our opponent and we are promised victory because the god of peace shall bruise satan under your feet shortly satan is the main influence behind every earthly kingdom as jesus teaches satan as a kingdom once granted permission by god satan has power to give earthly kingdoms to those he chooses but god's kingdom is greater in every way god has equipped us to defeat satan's spiritual kingdom and influence believers are fully armored soldiers wrestling not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places christians war spiritually against the wicked influences of every earthly kingdom and are victorious more than conquerors through him that loved us take heed to your heavenly father's invitation to be part of his eternal kingdom first thessalonians 2 verse 12 says that we should walk worthy of god who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory the confusion about the mystery of the kingdom of heaven to begin with there is no confusion that jesus's 16 parable mysteries are from god as jesus said he spoke only what the father taught him it is also widely understood that the parables are natural witnesses of the spiritual world for example knowing how to bake bread or plant a mustard seed does not make a person worthy of eternal life the confusion about the kingdom of heaven is about how to interpret the parables should they be applied directly to our lives today if so how far should they be applied in our politically correct society should the children of the kingdom and the children of the wicked one be identified can the woman hiding leaven in bread be identified should christians warn people about the furnace of fire and wailing and gnashing of teeth that await those who offend god's kingdom and work iniquity the answer to all these questions is yes and the parable should be applied as far as god intended to the very soul of every man the revelation of the kingdom of heaven is those who understand the kingdom's purpose extent and organization and give christ dominion in their earthly lives will be the ones who rule with christ in his future dominion biblical evidence for the revelation of the mystery of the kingdom of heaven the sixteen parable mysteries completely reveal the mystery of the kingdom of heaven when compared with the rest of scripture here are brief summaries followed by full biblical explanations one the sower and the foregrounds men display four heart reactions to hearing preaching about jesus christ two the wheat and tares each person is either a child of god or satan and churches are full of both 3 the grain of mustard seed the false church started small but grew until it was large and filled with all demonic powers chapter 9 reveals the false church 4 the leaven hid in three measures of meal the false church had lies in her teachings until her entire doctrine became fully corrupted 5 the treasure in a field a true believer joyfully trades all his possessions at the surprising opportunity to gain christ 6. the one pearl of great price a true believer abandons his search for many spiritual truths in order to gain the one most valuable truth christ seven the net cast into the sea at the end of the world the gospel will attract believers and unbelievers but god's angels will separate the wicked away from the holy 8 the unmerciful servant a person must forgive others if he expects god to forgive him 9 the laborers in the vineyard eternal life is the reward god gives to all who labor in his kingdom 10 the wicked husbandman the kingdom was rejected by the jews and then given to the gentiles to bring forth fruit unto god see chapter 2 11 the king's son after most jews reject it gentile believers respond to god's invitation for the rapture and are clothed in the wedding garment the baptism of the holy ghost 12 the 10 virgins wise believers possess oil or the baptism of the holy ghost as they await their wedding day with jesus the rapture see chapter 12 13 the talents christ commits varying amounts of talents and resources to his servants and rewards those who faithfully invest in them 14 the pounds christ provides an equal opportunity to his servants and rewards those who faithfully act upon it 15 the seed cast into the ground god causes spiritual growth by invisible means but men observe it in three stages 16 the great supper after most jews made excuses to reject it gentiles should accept jesus's compelling invitation to his great supper the marriage supper of the lamb parable 1 the sower and the foregrounds revelation men display four heart reactions to hearing preaching about jesus christ found in matthew 13 verses 3 through 9 and verses 18 through 23 this first revelation begins on the individual level and is interpreted by christ himself men can have only one of four reactions after hearing preaching about jesus christ as the parable details four types of ground that seed falls upon seed symbolizes god's word there will be no excuses on the day of judgment each type of ground receives seed each heart received the word each person has to ask the same question pontius pilate infamously asked when he stated what shall i do then with jesus which is called christ god is watching what you do with the word you have heard the first ground or heart is called the wayside representing a heart that hears the word of god but does not understand it files representing satan the wicked one snatch away god's word from the person's heart these files play an important role later in the third parable this heart immediately rejects god's word thus not believing and ultimately not saved jesus says that most people fall into this category declaring there are few that are saved the second ground is another sad heart condition called the stony places this kind of person rejoices over the word for a season and he can for a while believe but then rejects the truth due to tribulation or persecution the rejection occurs because there is no root in himself meaning no deep genuine love for christ as paul says christians are rooted and grounded in love jesus says this experience starts excitedly lasting longer than the wayside but then slowly withers away psalm 1 verse 3 says the godly have leaves that shall not wither real christian love does not wither away jew describes apostates as clouds without water and trees whose fruit withereth clearly the stony place's heart is apostate and lost just as the wayside heart the third ground can be called thorny because it receives the seed but then thorns spring up and choke it making the plant unfruitful this third heart hears the word but then chooses to care for the world riches and pleasures more than christ although this heart lasted much longer than the previous two it still missed the ultimate goal of christianity fruitfulness what good is an apple tree if it doesn't bring forth its fruit jesus wants christians to bring forth their fruits to serve their god-ordained purposes the rare and precious fruit of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness faith meekness and temperance jesus said he chose the disciples to go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain paul warns all christians that riches can cause believers to fall into temptations snares and into many foolish and hurtful lusts which drown men in destruction and perdition his advice to timothy a man of god is to flee these things and follow after righteousness godliness faith love patience and meekness paul in his second letter to timothy prophesied that men in the last days will be lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god after reading this you might think it's impossible for the unfruitful heart to be saved but i will soon show much bible evidence that salvation is possible for this heart although the reward will be little to nothing examples include lot and the repentant thief on the cross paul says a man can be saved but suffer loss of reward the fourth and final ground is good ground that brings forth fruit in one of three quantities thirtyfold sixtyfold or a hundredfold jesus interprets this ground as an honest and good heart having heard the word keep it and bring forth fruit with patience if you are an honest hearted christian you will produce the nine fruits of the spirit because you are honest about your spiritual condition you won't let money riches or pleasures choke your love for god's word as you love god with all your heart soul mind and strength you will hate even one sin stain upon your spiritual life james says pure religion is keeping yourself unspotted from the world you won't let one evil root of bitterness spring up and trouble your heart because you are completely focused on seeing an abundant harvest for the lord's glory genesis to revelation teaches this biblical revelation of four heart reactions or heart conditions see figure 21 genesis gives four kinds of heart reactions to god's revelation in abraham's day abraham's heart was good ground for he was the friend of god and father of faith living a fully devoted and separated life abraham and sarah brought forth isaac as fruit of their union and spiritual devotion lot's heart was thorny because although he was just and righteous he erroneously led his family into residing in sodom causing him and his family daily torment there was no real fruit to lot's ministry efforts in sodom just as the thorny ground was unfruitful lot's wife represents the stony ground because jesus identifies her as one whose heart and eyes turn back to sodom due to her love for it causing her to lose her life the sodomites represent wayside hearts for the mob at lot's house heard him call their homosexuality wickedness but then satan immediately snatched the seed words from their hearts the mob felt judged and were planning on physically violating a lot until he was saved by the angels these were all destroyed with fire and brimstone shortly after the angels pulled lot and his two daughters out of the city jesus crucifixion exposes these four hearts most people think of only three crosses on golgotha but there was a fourth cross or tree not far away judas iscariot's tree jesus heart represents the good ground for he always did that which pleased the father and there was so much fruit to his life that john supposed that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written about him the saved thief who was promised paradise by christ symbolizes the thorny ground for his life was fruitless in fact the save thief was mocking christ with the others shortly before his change of heart as matthew 27 44 says the thieves also which were crucified with him cast the same in his teeth judas iscariot's heart was the stony ground for he served christ for a season even witnessing countless miracles before withering away and ending in apostasy betrayal and hell the lost thief's heart was the wayside for he railed against jesus until the end without any fear of god paul described the four hearts as four different kinds of vessels gold silver wood and earth the gold represents the good ground and the silver symbolizes the thorny ground wood represents the stony side heart and earth symbolizes the wayside heart gold and silver vessels are honorable and thus can be used by the master for good works obviously gold is more valuable useful or better than silver just as the prophet samuel told saul that david was better than he god saw david's life was more useful than saul's because of david's pure heart the wood and earth are dishonorable disposable vessels showing again that two hearts are saved and two were lost paul was an honorable vessel for jesus literally called him a chosen vessel to bear his name to the gentiles kings and israel the egyptian ruler pharaoh was a vessel of dishonor for paul said god raised pharaoh up as a vessel of wrath fitted for destruction proverbs 16 verse 4 also says the lord hath made all things for himself yea even the wicked for the day of evil revelation 22 verse 11 lists the four conditions every person will end up in at jesus's second coming holy righteous filthy and unjust the holy condition represents the good ground while the righteous represents the thorny ground the filthy condition represents the stony ground and the unjust condition is the wayside ground the holy and righteous hearts will be saved while the filthy and unjust will be lost please take a few moments to meditate upon the revelation of the sower and the foregrounds that it may be applied to your soul you may want to fall to your knees in sincere prayer to jesus christ your high priest and ask him to show you which heart condition you have cultivated thus far in your life which ground does your heart resemble is the ground of your heart good honest and producing much fruit or is it thorny because you have let love of pleasures and riches choke the growth of god's word in your life if so the remedy is to let jesus's holy spirit the master gardener weed out the cares of the world and ungodly habits from your heart and life is your ground like the stony ground and you have left christianity after believing for a season if so return to christ and repent of all your transgressions that god's word will have a deep love to be planted in lastly if your heart is the wayside ground and you have never followed christ won't you repent of your sins now and be baptized in jesus christ's name won't you lose your sinful life and gain eternal life parable 2 the we in tares revelation each person is either a child of god or satan and the churches are full of both found in matthew 13 verses 24 through 30 and verses 36 through 43 the second revelation is again interpreted by christ here the good seed is not the word itself as in the first parable but is the product of the word preached the children of god jesus teaches there will be both wheat god's children and tares satan's children in the world until the end time god's children originate from jesus the son of man the sower who first sowed good seeds or believers in the world or field the devil is the enemy who came in afterwards and sowed tares or unbelievers at harvest time or the end of the world the angels will come to separate unbelievers for their fire judgment afterwards the righteous wheat will shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their father this parable's timeline is from the beginning of jesus's earthly ministry to the end of the times of the gentiles or end of the church ages which is yet in the future jesus said he the son of man sowed the good seed during jesus's earthly ministry he either called himself or was called son of man eighty times in matthew 13 24 the son of man went sowing first which was jesus's three and a half year earthly ministry jesus's preaching and healing ministry caused many to believe the gospel such as the many samaritans in the city that believed jesus was the christ the savior of the world but eventually all the early believers such as peter james john and paul died as matthew 13 25 says while men slept as the early apostles started sleeping or dying satan began sowing his tares or children among the believers as scripture details around 60 a.d paul cried for three straight years warning the ephesians that wolves or false teachers would enter into their assembly not sparing the flock about six years later jude said evil men would pervert grace by making it leschiviousness or a license for immorality around 90 a.d john wrote that there were already many antichrists working deception in the churches the tares or children of the wicked one are impersonators of the wheat or children of the kingdom physical tears are darnell weeds which are nearly identical in appearance to wheat explaining why jesus commanded that both wheat and tear grow together until the harvest so that wheat would not be uprooted with the terror to the human eye it's nearly impossible to distinguish between the wheat and tare so christ assigns the angels to separate them at the end of the world spiritual tares are impersonators of christianity great in number and sitting in every church looking and acting nearly identical to spiritual wheat tares appear to be twins of the wheat but they are not true wheat the bible is filled with twins or wheat entire examples cain and abel balaam and moses and judas and jesus the only way to know which of the twins is the true believer is to observe which one obeys the word as cain was instructed to obey but rejected god's will just as terrors resemble wheat these men all had a parallel spiritual life balaam and moses were both known prophets judas and jesus ministered together and both performed miracles one reason terrors are extremely deceptive is because they can honor and worship god enough to see the holy spirit supernaturally move in their services jesus said no man that speaks lightly of him can do a miracle in his name proving that tares will speak honorably of jesus in order to work under his anointing but afterwards their tares will work iniquity engaging in lustful lifestyles as jesus taught in matthew 7 verses 21-23 not everyone that saith unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven many will say to me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name have done wonderful works and then will i profess unto them i never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity paul speaks of tares describing their sinful characteristics in these last days saying tares are lovers of their own selves covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful unholy without natural affection truce breakers false accusers incontinent fierce despisers of those that are good traitors heady high-minded lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god the apostle says they have a form or resemblance of godliness but all deny the power of god that produces genuine godliness tares do some good works but harbor wicked selfish hearts putting on a public church membership act true christians let god's power purify and sanctify them wholly because they want to see jesus face to face and have a body just like his just as a physical tear causes sickness a spiritual tare's unholy life nauseates a true believer the greek lexicon says darnell grains if eaten produce convulsions and even death jesus described the spiritual condition in the letter to the laodiceans saying a lukewarm tear with lukewarm works would be spewed out of his mouth because he claimed to be upright but instead was miserable wretched blind and naked witnessing a compromising unfaithful undisciplined spiritual life makes both jesus and christians sick to their stomachs at harvest time the end of the world the tares will be gathered and bound first before the wheat this prophetic detail lets us know that the impersonators of christianity will unite in an economical council before the rapture or catching away of the gentile bride of christ chapter 12 details the rapture mystery this gathering is manifestly declared in the pope's 2016 call for unity and love falsely claiming that jews christians muslims and buddhists are all children of god with all due respect the pope is wrong the only way to be a child of god is by faith in christ jesus so religions that deny faith in christ like muslims and buddhists are not god's weak children the binding time is upon us as the terror churches or children of the mother harlot the roman catholic church and those who commit spiritual adultery with them will soon be bound in their money-centered ecumenical council in preparation for their burning as foretold in revelation 2 verses 22 and 23 and revelation 13 verses 14 14-18 although christians cannot always identify individual terrors nor is it our desire to we can identify the characteristics of the group they will unite with tares will have some good supernatural works by god's spirit but the majority of their works will be self-loving self-serving endeavors tares will ultimately desire to unite with the mother harlot and her daughters rather than with the bride of jesus christ and his revealed word of truth parable 3 the grain of mustard seed revelation the false church started small but grew until it was large and filled with all demonic powers found in matthew 13 verses 31 and 32 this third parable has dual meanings but the second meaning is the revelation that is far more prevalent than the first the first less prevailing meaning is that a tiny mustard seed grain is likened unto faith in god's word jesus says faith the size of a mustard seed can remove mountains which in context means casting out evil spirits according to christ the faith seed will bring forth miracle fruit when doubt is kept out of the heart the confusing mysterious second meaning that most people do not see is the false church which combats the kingdom of heaven started by the very smallest of lies or false doctrines but eventually flourished into a massive worldwide habitation of devils in the early church's infancy god protected his children by purging them from sinful people and of the rest durst no man joined himself to them but the people magnified them and believers were the more added to the lord multitudes both of men and women but by 90 a.d john said there were many antichrists battling the saints fast forward 2 000 years and the false church is now the greatest largest group in the world who is the mustard tree the holy spirit helps us identify her as the roman catholic church first she unashamedly claims to be the mother church meaning she is the first false church that rejected the leadership of the holy ghost taking inspiration from the wicked one second this great tree is lodging birds which symbolize unclean spirits according to genesis 15 verses 10 and 11 mark 4 verse 15 and revelation 18 verse 2. when god confirmed his unconditional covenant with abraham the father of faith had to drive away files as he offered sacrifices to god which represented evil spirits being cast out for satan wants to destroy true worship by devouring worshipers and by catching away the word from their hearts revelation 18 verse 2 is the absolute clearest picture of birds symbolizing demons for the roman church is said to be a habitation of devils and the hold of every foul spirit in a cage of every unclean and hateful bird god could not give us a more brutal honest and scathing description of rome think of it every kind of demon or bird lives in the roman catholic church system and the proof is ever before us in august 2018 abuse allegations against catholic priests in pennsylvania made world news as over 300 priests abused more than 1 000 victims over the course of 70 years horrific details of abuse filled the grand jury report including rapes whippings and abortions in a cbs interview a mother blamed a priest for her son's accidental death by an overdose on painkillers because the priest repeatedly raped her son causing him irreparable back damage her son then overdosed and died trying to get relief from the unending agonizing back pain when asked how this abuse could happen one pennsylvania survivor said there's something in the dna of the church that encourages this the bible reveals the roman church's dna for she is the jezebel church the mother of harlots and abominations the cage for every demonic spirit and ultimately a spiritual child of satan priest abuse is not new as abuse cases have skyrocketed over the past three decades revealing thousands upon thousands of victims from australia 2017 dominican republic 2014 netherlands 2011 germany 2010 ireland 2009 boston 2002 austria 1999 and louisiana 1985. this supreme and utter wickedness was not done in just one state but viciously infected the global community shortly after the pennsylvania grand jury report at least 18 victims of sexual abuse at hands of nuns came forward revealing another secret plague in catholicism both priests and nuns are guilty of sexual immorality paul says child molesters or effeminate men shall not inherit the kingdom of god no doubt this would apply to pedophile nuns as well this relentless child rape epidemic proves the roman church is truly the habitation of devils the hold of every foul spirit and the cage of every unclean and hateful demon see chapter returning to the symbolism of fowls there is one bird and one only not a group of birds that symbolizes god's spirit and that is the dove at jesus baptism the holy ghost descended like a dove abode upon him and remained on him empowering his earthly ministry multiple birds rarely represent god's spirit proving the mustard tree in this parable is the false church the roman catholic church and not the true church data proves the roman catholic church is the largest so-called christian church in the world which gives evidence that she is the mustard tree that became the greatest among herbs the pew research center found that catholics make up over 50 percent of the global christian population 36 percent being protestants and 11 as orthodox with over 1.2 billion catholics in the ever-growing number of abuse victims this third parable must represent the roman catholic church and not the true church the bride of christ both jesus and paul prophesied that true christians would decrease in number in the last days jesus said few would find the narrow road to eternal life because iniquity not righteousness would abound christ also declared fewer and fewer souls would be saved as time passed saying history would be shortened in order that some souls might be saved paul said evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived our time has a great increase of deception causing fewer people to be saved parable 4 the leaven hid in three measures of meal revelation the false church hid lies in her teachings until her entire doctrine became fully corrupted found in matthew 13 33 this fourth parable speaks of a woman or church hiding leaven in three measures of meal until the bread is completely leavened some confuse this woman with the true church but the scriptural revelation is that this woman is the false church hiding lies in her teachings this fourth parable along with the second and seventh parables foretells complete doctrinal corruption and worldwide deception inside false churches at the end of the world rather than a major expansion of the true church although this parable is very short it contains powerful symbols to begin with leaven the yeast added to dough to make it ferment and rise always has a negative spiritual connotation in scripture mentioned nearly 40 times 11 represents sin as jesus likened leaven unto the pharisees false doctrine saying how is it that ye do not understand that i spake it not to you concerning bread that you should beware of the leaven of the pharisees and of the sadducees then understood they how that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread but of the doctrine of the pharisees and of the sadducees paul labelled a member of the church of corinth as leaven amongst the brethren because he was committing fornication second meal is flour used to make cakes of bread which was an everyday staple food for israelis meal represents god's pure word that we should daily hear and obey jesus said i am the bread of life showing he the word of god is the believer's daily portion of spiritual food the meal offering in the old testament represented christ's cross as all the offerings foreshadowed his sacrificial work mission and character jesus even likened himself to a grain of wheat that had to die and be crushed or bruised before it could live again since christ is pure meal or pure teachings meal with levin represents impure or corrupted teachings next what woman or church hid leaven or lies in her teachings until the whole doctrine was leavened she is mystery babylon or the roman catholic church for jesus warns us of only one woman who is drunken with the blood of the saints and whose false doctrines he hates because they are completely abominable calling her both jezebel and the mother of harlots and abominations of the earth this unfaithful church worked deceptively for she hid the mixed in leaven of polytheism a three-person god from the people as satan delights in masking sin as righteousness or light fourth the three measures of meal denote god's threefold manifestation as father son and holy ghost for god is truly the father the word and the holy ghost but these three are one not three persons neither god nor his bible ever say i am three persons so the leaven injected into the three measures is the three person false doctrine that god is three eternal separate distinct yet co-equal persons a three-person god creates polytheism tritheism and ultimately idolatry in all churches that confess the trinity fifth notice the leaven was hid in the meal early in the baking process this detail reveals that the false godhead teaching began early in church history the earliest record of believers using the false titles baptism rather than the true baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ comes from the didachi a second century catechism the didachi reads concerning baptism baptized thus having first rehearsed all these things baptized in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost in running water yet the inspired inerrant infallible book of acts declares that early church pillars such as peter philip and paul all baptized using the literal name of the lord jesus christ during the church's infancy in the first century how contrary is the didache compared to peter's infallible words on the day the church was born the day of pentecost when he declared repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost it was also during the second century many years after the bible authors and apostles completed the new testament canon that the term trinity was introduced by both theophilus of antioch and tertullian further demonstrating that the leaven was added by non-apostles early in church history lastly like leaven permeating throughout the entire bread until the hole is leavened the trinity lie has risen or expanded corrupting the entire set of catholic doctrine which includes the following heresies transubstantiation the communion of saints mandatory clerical celibacy the office of the pope the holy father title of the pope and the veneration of statues and images to name a few the trinity lie is so widespread that most church members do not question its validity one scholar uses fear to threaten his readers that they will lose their souls if they deny the trinity stating try to explain it and you'll lose your mind but try to deny it and you'll lose your soul how absurd it is impossible to lose your soul for not believing a dogmatic lie that is not even found in holy writ in fact the opposite is true god will save your soul for believing only god's words you must not give in to fear and submit to the man-made trinity dogma for god does not give us the spirit of fear but gives us the holy spirit the spirit of power and of love and of a sound mind there is nothing biblically sound about three individual persons as one deity put all your confidence in the word of god knowing god is one person and that you have not added to the bible nor taken away from it feast on the unleavened meal the pure unadulterated word of god parable number five the treasure hidden a field revelation a true believer joyfully trades all his possessions at the surprising opportunity to gain christ found in matthew 13 verse 44 this fifth revelation likens the kingdom of heaven unto treasure hidden a field prompting a surprise and joyful man to sell all he has in order to buy the field and treasure therein the first symbol treasure stands for the baptism of the holy ghost for paul teaches that the gospel light that is shined in our hearts is treasure in earth and vessels for christ dwells in our hearts by faith god's spirit is treasure abiding in the heart or inner man this holy ghost treasure fell into the hearts of believers on the day of pentecost for peter said the promise of the holy ghost is what god shed forth and paul received the same experience later saying the love of god is shed abroad in our hearts by the holy ghost which is given to us to gain christ is to be filled with his spirit see chapter six furthermore jesus says the kingdom of god is within you and paul echoes the same that the hope of glory is christ in you after his resurrection jesus breathed on his disciples urging them to receive the holy ghost treasure saying receive ye the holy ghost christians will always love and consider god's spirit a treasure above the things of the world whereas tares will love worldly pleasures and riches more than god is the treasure found it is hidden in the field of the bible recall jesus is teaching from the introduction chapter about god's desire to hide himself from the prideful and reveal himself to the humble the treasure of the baptism of the holy ghost experience is found hidden only in the field of god's word foretold by the prophets nearly 800 years before messiah came joel prophesied of the baptism of the holy ghost which was fulfilled in acts 2 verses 16-21 saying and it shall come to pass afterward that i will pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions jeremiah some 600 years before christ prophesied of the holy ghost as vindicated by the book of hebrews saying but this shall be the covenant that i will make with the house of israel after those days saith the lord i will put my law in their inward parts and write it in their hearts and will be their god and they shall be my people some 580 years before messiah came ezekiel 4 told the baptism of the holy ghost writing a new heart also will i give you and a new spirit will i put within you and i will take away the stony heart of your flesh and i will give you an heart of flesh and i will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and ye shall keep my judgments and do them the treasure is in the field meaning the baptism of the holy ghost is foretold in scripture this parable says the man found the treasure in the field which speaks from the human perspective rather than gods scripture declares the eternal perspective is that no man can come to jesus except the father draws him and jesus is the one seeking the lost and not vice versa god's gracious heart though lets the man experience the joy of finding unexpected treasure from his human perspective philip's heart burned with excitement when he experienced the joy of finding christ telling nathanael we have found him of whom moses in the law and the prophets did right jesus of nazareth the son of joseph from god's perspective it was really jesus finding philip and nathanael while men are surprised at finding christ god is not but there is rejoicing both on earth and in heaven this parable emphasizes how god uses the element of surprise in believers lives awakening them from complete ignorance just as finding unexpected treasure in a simple common field would delight a man god's surprising instant introduction of himself into a man's life brings joy unspeakable in john 4 verses 4 through 42 the samaritan woman at jacob's well went to find water but instead surprisingly found the messiah's treasure of living waters she hid the treasure in her heart and excitedly went into the city and told others about it the bible says many of the samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman which testified he told me all that i ever did imagine the surprise and excitement the ethiopian eunuch experienced in acts 8 verses 26 through 40 when philip preached unto him jesus for the first time from isaiah chapter 53 the eunuch spontaneous joy in that predestined moment moved him to obey the gospel command to be baptized immediately and he commanded the chariot to stand still and they went down both into the water both philip and the eunuch and he baptized him this parable says the man hid the treasure before making the purchase of the field hiding god's treasure is likened unto meditating and memorizing scripture for psalm 119 verse 11 says thy word have i hidden mine heart that i might not sin against thee meditating upon scripture ensures the word is stored in your heart as david says let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight o lord my strength and my redeemer psalm 1 verse 2 declares the blessed man delights in god's word and in his law doth he meditate day and night may god's word be hidden in your heart like it was in jeremiah's heart for he says thy words were found and i did eat them and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart selling and buying has both a natural and spiritual meaning in this parable in the natural believers gladly sell out any financial gains that might hinder their relationship with christ in order to receive him moses chose to suffer affliction with the people of god in order to gain the heavenly riches selling out the financial and worldly pleasures that would accompany being the son of pharaoh elisha sold out his farming aspirations in order to follow elijah slaying his yoke of oxen and feeding the people so he could follow and minister to elijah brothers peter and andrew and james and john left their fishing nets in order to follow christ as fishers of men jesus promised peter and all believers that the rewards for forsaking the world would be and hundredfold now in this time and eternal life in the world to come in the spiritual selling means forsaking satan's lies while buying represents repenting from those lies and believing god's word jesus says selling is losing your life that you might find your spiritual life which includes loving christ more than family proverbs 23 verse 23 says by the truth and sell it not also wisdom and instruction and understanding when you buy the field of biblical truth you will experience the treasure of the baptism of the holy ghost not only can you buy the truth but jesus tells the laodicean church age our age to buy spiritual gold and white raiment from him gold is time tested unwavering faith and white raiment represents a righteous spiritual life of integrity in obedience to the holy spirit parable six the one pearl of great price revelation a true believer abandons his search for many spiritual truths in order to gain the one most valuable truth christ found in matthew 13 verses 45 and 46 this sixth revelation contrasts the fifth parable which emphasized the suddenness and total surprise when discovering god's treasure here in the sixth parable jesus illustrates how god satisfies those who are actively seeking many pearls by letting them discover the ultimate pearl the first symbol shows a merchant man seeking many pearls meaning someone who is actively searching for religious or spiritual truths the man is not a careless or wicked man but one who has been awakened and is sincerely seeking truth pearls always represent valuable beautiful and rare treasures in scripture as proved by the following texts matthew 7 verse 6 first timothy 2 verse 9 revelation 17 verse 4 revelation 18 verse 12 and revelation 21 verse 21 jesus words from matthew 7 verse 6 in particular prove pearls represent his life-changing truths saying give not that which is holy unto the dogs either cast you your pearls before swine lest they trample them under their feet and turn again and rend you men can find valuable moral teachings or pearls in nearly any religion but especially in judaism speaking of moses's law paul says the law is holy and the commandment holy and just and good there is tremendous moral wisdom in moses law yet there is one religion that is far above all others in value christianity because its founder offers complete forgiveness by grace power for living godly on this earth and eternal life the pearl of great price typifies receiving jesus christ spirit or the baptism of the holy ghost for this baptism was the mystery hid from ages and generations god loves and will reward diligent searchers of truth by letting them discover the ultimate pearl the baptism of the holy ghost when a man finds his great pearl by hearing preaching about jesus christ he will sell everything in order to possess it as seen in two clear new testament passages acts 19 verses one through seven provides the first example observe how the twelve ephesian believers sold out their goodly pearls or their previous holy teachings learned from john the baptist in order to possess the one pearl of great price the baptism of the holy ghost once paul revealed to them that there was one great pearl available to them the baptism of the holy ghost the twelve were quickly re-baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and receive god's holy ghost treasure for the holy ghost came on them and they spake with tongues and prophesied the ephesians sold out john's baptism were moved on to the fresh revelation of the spirit for their time period in order to possess the baptism of the holy ghost the one pearl of great price paul's conversion from judaism to christianity is a second clear example of a man selling out his goodly pearls or moral teachings in order to gain the baptism of the holy ghost by his own words paul was blameless a hebrew of hebrews a dedicated devoted and learned man with tremendous zeal from moses's law but after once being in the supernatural presence of jesus christ paul's desires were transformed and he eagerly forsook his previous self-righteousness renouncing it as dung in order that he might win christ it wasn't long after paul's conversion that he received the pearl of great price the baptism of the holy ghost paul described the pearl of great price by saying he wanted to be found in him christ not having mine own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the faith of christ the righteousness which is of god by faith that i may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death a final thought comes from revelation 21 verse 21 which says and the twelve gates were twelve pearls every several gate was of one pearl and the street of the city was pure gold as it were transparent glass herein is the christian's future home the holy city new jerusalem the tabernacle of god which comes down from god out of heaven as the eternal abode after all sin death and hell are annihilated and forgotten this eternal city is indescribably beautiful as every facet of her beauty tells a story of amazing grace and jesus's love notice there are 12 gates three gates on each of the four sides each made from a massive pearl upon entering the holy city you must pass through a massive pearl of great price as a reminder of god's saving grace to you no wonder christ will wipe all the tears from our eyes as we enter the city and rejoice in his matches love story of redemption for will remember our life story our deep soul desire and passionate longing to possess the ultimate treasure god's spirit and his amazing grace to let us find it our hearts will feel eternally grateful that we sold out the many goodly pearls of religious truth in order to possess the holy ghost the best word to describe such a happy group of people is blessed for revelation 22 verses 14 and 15 says blessed are they that do his commandments that they might have right to the tree of life and may enter in through the gates into the city for without are dogs and sorcerers and whoremongers and murderers and idolaters and whosoever loveth and maketh a lie parable number 7 the net cast into the sea revelation at the end of the world the gospel will attract believers and unbelievers but god's angels will separate the wicked away from the holy found in matthew 13 verses 47 through 50 the seventh revelation is similar to the wheat and tares as it depicts two different kinds of people closely associated to one another the wicked and the just the seventh parable foretells a worldwide gathering onto christianity that requires a final separation between the wicked and just the net cast into the sea that gathers of every kind denotes the universal invitation to christianity commissioned by christ for his disciples to go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned according to revelation 17 verse 15 the sea represents peoples multitudes nations and tongues our lord prophesied the end would not come until every nation had heard the gospel invitation further vindicating the seventh parable as a true end time revelation jesus called his first preachers fishers of men so the invitation to become a christian is the spiritual net that draws men to christ however just as judas iscariot was called of jesus and later fell by transgression the calling does not guarantee salvation for christ says for many be called but few chosen jesus john and paul prophesied of this net scenario for the last days which foretold large numbers of people or every kind who are attracted to christianity but are mere professors of the faith rather than true possessors of its power jesus witnessed this same vain worship in his earthly ministry saying this people draw thy unto me with their mouth and on earth me with their lips but their heart is far from me but in vain they do worship me teaching for doctrines the commandments of men jesus said the false church would be so close to the true that only the elect would not be deceived john's revelation taught that the false economical move would deceive the whole world and eventually seek to control each person's ability to buy and sell paul said deceivers would wax worse and worse having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof so the question arises why would the masses be attracted to gather around christianity yet remain wicked and deceived the answer comes from jesus christ and paul wicked people enjoy the blessings of the holy spirit but do not want to fully surrender to it in matthew 5 45 christ says for he maketh his son to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust god is so gracious he sends natural sunlight and rain upon just and unjust people all sinners enjoy the blessings of the sun and rain yet many deny god's existence likewise god's mercy also sends spiritual reign or his spirit's anointing upon both just and unjust people sinners can experience god's joy freedom and love and yet be lost psalm says god's presence brings a fullness of joy which is the same emotion the stony-hearted ones experienced temporarily before becoming offended by the word isaiah 10 verse 27 teaches the spirit's anointing also breaks demonic yokes or addictions granting freedom in people's lives but all too often as jesus teaches the person set free with a clean house allows seven more devils to return falling back into sinful addiction and the last state is worse than the first since god is a spirit and god is love sinners can feel god's merciful love offering them truth but then reject it because they don't love the truth since god's spirit is the spirit of truth paul by the spirit further expounds on this thought in hebrews 6 verses 4 through 8 comparing wicked people who temporarily enjoy the blessings of the holy spirit yet later live openly wicked lives to plants that bear thorns and briars the apostle says wicked people whose end is burning just like the tares can be enlightened of the spirit can taste of heavenly gifts be partakers of the holy ghost but still fall away from living a true christian life just as the thorn lives off the rain so do many sinners live off god's anointing but they are not the seed or children of god and cannot bring forth godly fruit because they are workers of iniquity does this teaching surprise you it did me not long after my surrender to christ in the year 2000 i was reading my bible in my college dorm room and came across matthew 7 verses 21-23 which says not everyone that saith unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven many will say to me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works and then will i profess unto them i never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity i was confounded how could jesus command that many eternally depart from him who had done wonderful works like prophesying and casting out devils in his name how could christ condemn people who had been anointed of his spirit to do good works two years later the undeniable revelation came as i listened to william branham's sermon the anointed ones at the end time branham pointed me to scriptures showing the true anointing of god's spirit temporarily falls on false teachers of course the anointing is not upon the false teacher while he is teaching lies but it falls on him either before or after while worshiping operating spiritual gifts and praying branham emphasized jesus's words in matthew 24 verse 24 which speaks of false christs and false prophets the genuine anointing of the holy spirit temporarily manifests through an unsaved person scripture contains multiple examples of false christs or wicked people who want only god's blessings and mercies but not a holy fully surrendered life to god's word in genesis cain worshiped the true god heard his voice and spoke back to him was given god's direct instruction for obedience begged him for mercy and received it but left the presence of god as a reprobate a son of that wicked one in numbers balaam is perhaps the clearest bible example of a false christ this false prophet spoke directly to god in extended conversations called jehovah my god experienced supernatural visions and trances when the holy spirit fell on him and prophesied correctly about israel by the holy ghost sadly balaam ultimately loved money more than god leading him to teach israel to commit fornication which caused 24 000 deaths the prophecy of balaam by god's spirit was correct but his teaching was false peter said balaam's destiny was hell judas iscariot is a third example for he was chosen by jesus yet unclean he was given power to cast out unclean spirits and heal all manner of sickness and diseases and must have correctly operated in the supernatural as evidenced at the last supper when the other 11 apostles questioned if they were the traitor not instantly suspecting judas access judas obtained a part of the apostolic ministry but fell from god as a traitor was lost and went to his own place as the son of perdition branham citing jesus's warning to remove names of reprobates out of the book of life in revelation 3 verse 15 says of judas the part that judas obtained amongst the twelve and then lost was neither inferior to the ministries of the other eleven nor was it a devilish foreign ministry interjected amongst the ministries of the others judas a devil lost a god-given holy ghost ministry and killed himself and went to his own place his name was even in the book of life but his name was blotted out it is through the right approach to god that sinners like cain balaam and judas experience god's anointing god promises to draw an eye to those who draw an eye to him sinners like saints draw nigh to god through sacrifice humility and reverence to receive god's mercy but saints faithfully serve god thereafter while sinners backslide cain drew near to god by bringing him an offering but it was the wrong kind balaam drew near to god and heard his specific instructions through private worship prayer and sacrifice offering a block and ram upon seven separate altars judas knew the right approach to experiencing god's power was being careful to always respect jesus and never say an evil word against him for jesus said this was the key to doing miracles in his name according to christ many unsaved workers of iniquity will plead their case to be saved on judgment day based upon their experiences with the anointing but jesus's judgments will be based upon who obeyed the will of god with their entire life this teaching implies that signs miracles and wonders done by the holy ghost prove only god's presence manifested among a group and they do not vindicate that group or individual as being truly saved a move of the holy ghost proves the group or individual approach god correctly in a temporary manner no matter the denomination or movement charismatic pentecostal word of faith apostolic holiness etc miracles do not prove a person is saved or a church is part of the true kingdom of god give the individual denomination or movement time to manifest the real seed inside of them so you can judge the fruit of the ministry since jesus said a tree is known by its fruit miracles and supernatural works prove only that the holy ghost was manifesting not that he is having the full preeminence he desires in their daily lives once the gospel net is full at the end of the world having gathered or attracted every kind of person god's angels will come and separate the wicked from the just so that the wicked may be burned this separation will take place at the great white throne judgment as seen in revelation 20 verses 11 through 15 and matthew 25 verses 31-46 the tares or wicked workers of iniquity will see abraham isaac and jacob in the kingdom of god but they will be thrust out the wicked will experience wailing and gnashing of teeth in the lake of fire which is the same judgment pronounced upon the tares in the second parable it behooves all who call upon the name of jesus christ to examine themselves to see if they are in the faith and that christ's spirit is in their souls christians must diligently make their calling and election sure faithfully doing god's works bringing forth fruit pleasing unto god parable 8 the unmerciful servant revelation a person must forgive others if he expects god to forgive him found in matthew 18 verses 21-35 this parable stresses the necessity of forgiveness jesus tells this parable in response to peter's question about how often he should forgive his brother peter estimates seven times but jesus says seventy times seven or an unlimited number of times in the parable the certain king represents the heavenly father who compassionately and freely forgives a servant who owes ten thousand talents or an insurmountable debt so great is our sin debt to god that none could dream of undoing the sin damage we have committed against god's holiness sadly this forgiven servant leaves the king's presence and finds a fellow servant who owes him one hundred talents or one percent of the debt he was forgiven and demands he repay him the fellow servant begs for patience but the first servant refuses and has him cast into prison when the king hears of this injustice the first servant is brought before him and in wrath declares him as wicked the king sentences him to torment until his ten thousand talent debt is paid representing a sentence to the lake of fire jesus states so likewise shall my heavenly father do also unto you if ye from your hearts forgive not everyone his brother their trespasses this parable is found only in matthew jesus is recorded stating the same principle from the sermon on the mount in matthew 6 verses 14 and 15 and during the final week of his earthly life in mark 11 verses 25-26 certainly christ wants us to understand all sins committed against us by others pale in comparison to the sins we have committed against almighty god forgiveness is so important that jesus inserts it in the lord's prayer the model daily prayer in matthew 6 verse 12 and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors the gift of forgiveness is daily received and daily given christ implores christians to humbly possess a debtor's mindset so we can forgive those indebted to us the god designed debtors mindset produces gratitude and mercy rather than hopeless guiltiness our lord simply wants us to always remember how much we were forgiven so that we can freely forgive others jesus promises in matthew 5 verse 7 blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy kingdom citizens keep their hearts or grounds free from every life-sucking root of bitterness that tries to spring up in their hearts through prayer christians daily weed their hearts and cast their cares upon the lord putting away all roots of bitterness choose to forgive with a tender heart paul says let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice and be kind one to another tenderhearted forgiving one another even as god for christ's sake hath forgiven you on a personal note i strongly encourage you to view my friend's testimony of forgiveness on youtube michael j mccloskey a testimony of forgiveness seven years after being targeted and shot by a police officer in which he became paralyzed from the waist down michael powerfully and publicly forgave the officer in court holding high his king james bible as a banner of victory his story is one of the greatest examples of jesus's love and forgiveness i have ever witnessed parable number 9 the laborers in the vineyard revelation eternal life is the reward god gives to all who labor in his kingdom found in matthew 20 verses 1 1-16 jesus's parable of labors in the vineyard magnifies his equity as he gives each of his servants a just reward for their labor isaiah rightly describes god as a just god and a savior our god fairly deals with mankind in every age as he seeks laborers for his kingdom paul supports isaiah asking is there unrighteousness with god god forbid jesus is the householder who hires laborers for his vineyard at the first hour of the day and agrees on their wages the householder hires more laborers at the 3rd 6th and 9th hours before making one last hire at the 11th hour at the conclusion of the day the 12th hour the laborers come to jesus for payment the last laborers the 11th hour workers are paid first receiving a penny when the first hour workers are paid the same amount some murmur against the householder but are rebuked because the initial payment agreement was kept the householder declares his lawful dealings and affirms he is good the main lesson is that some christians labor longer than others and in much more difficult circumstances yet eternal life is the reward for all faithful laborers the first hour workers worked for 12 hours and endured the sun's most intense heat for an entire day the 11th hour workers logged one hour at the sun setting and decreasing temperature apply this principle to spiritual labor as you compare the ministries of stephen and john who served one year and 66 years respectively stephen is the first recorded christian martyr having been stoned by a jewish council around 31 a.d at the age of 29 years during his one year of holy ghost empowered ministry stephen was full of faith and power did great wonders and miracles among the people a great labor of the kingdom was stephen yet he must receive the same eternal life reward as the apostle john history says john died around 100 a.d at the ripe old age of 94 years meaning he faithfully ministered for over 70 years both stephen and john endure the heat of persecution while laboring for the householder and both will receive eternal life the just and good payment promised to them john labored decades longer than stephen but each man's steps were ordered of the lord psalm 37 verse 23 reads the steps of a good man are ordered by the lord and he delighteth in his way the householder plainly states he can do his own will with his own workers saying i am good god is a good and fair heavenly father with a plan for every life the loving lord has different assignments for believers and today's spiritual labor conditions vary worldwide united states christians experience very little persecution but other christians especially middle easterners are facing genocide newsweek reports anti-christian persecution is increasing and its severity is intensifying making christians the most persecuted religious group in the world no matter the circumstances god desires faithful service in the hour in which ye are called conditions are only going to get worse prophecy says both love and the number of converts will continue to decrease until the end time matthew 24 verse 12 states and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold sin destroys love god has to shorten the days to ensure some people are saved our lord says in matthew 24 22 and accept those days should be shortened there should be no flesh saved but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened despite charismatics prophesying of worldwide revival and a great harvest of souls scripture foretells the opposite worldwide deception paul prophesies in second timothy 3 verse 13 but evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived john says all nations will be deceived by and cooperate with the false church the mother harlot see chapter 9. the final scripture in the parable matthew 20 verse 16 says so the last shall be first and the first last for many be called but few chosen christ's parable closes with his assurance that he not man will determine the order of rewards and honor divine wisdom causes him to honor the last first and the first last god calls many to his service but he has chosen a select few to hire more honorable works based upon his foreign knowledge rest assured god's choosing is always right o the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of god how unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding out for who hath known the mind of the lord or who hath been his counselor parable 10 the wicked husbandman revelation the kingdom was rejected by the jews and then given to the gentiles to bring forth fruit unto god found in matthew 21 verses 33 through 46 jesus interprets the parable of the wicked husbandman for us christ declares to the jews therefore say i unto you the kingdom of god shall be taken from you and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof the symbols are evident the heavenly father is the householder or owner of the vineyard representing the kingdom of god israel represents the husbandmen to whom the householder entrusted its fruit to when the householders sent servants to receive the fruit the husbandmen beat killed and stoned them jesus says these servants represent the old testament prophets god sent to israel whom they rejected luke 13 34 reads o jerusalem jerusalem which killeth the prophets and stone is them that are sent unto thee how often would i have gathered thy children together as a hand doth gather her brood under her wings and ye would not lastly the householder sent his son to receive the fruit this represents the father sending his son jesus but the chief priests and pharisees crucified him out of the vineyard or without the gate of jerusalem containing some common sense the priests and pharisees infer jesus is likening them to the wicked husbandmen jesus asked if they have read psalm 118 verses 22 and 23 which he quotes aloud in their ears multiple new testament passages refer to christ as the rejected stone acts 4 verse 11 romans 9 33 ephesians 2 verse 20 and first peter 2 verse 7. christ interprets the parable breathing out the sentence against israel that the kingdom will be given to the gentiles paul echoes this in acts 28 verse 28 be it known therefore unto you that the salvation of god is sent unto the gentiles and that they will hear it parable 11 the king's son revelation believers respond to god's invitation for the rapture and are appropriately clothed in the wedding garment or the baptism of the holy ghost found in matthew 22 verses 1 through 14 this parable typifies the heavenly father as a certain king preparing a wedding for his son or jesus christ the marriage represents the future marriage supper of the lamb taught in revelation 19 verse 9. this supper represents the wedding reception of christ and his bride the new testament church which takes place immediately after jesus raptures away his bride before the tribulation those bid into the wedding who would not come represent israel because they rejected their own messiah's invitation to the kingdom of god some jews made light of the imitation preferring farming and selling merchandise over following jesus's ministry the remaining jews or remnant slew jesus's servants or preachers he would send following his ascension to heaven christ plainly foretells that the jews will kill his prophets and wise men and scribes the wrath of the king's armies and the burning of the city represent the roman emperor titus's destruction of jerusalem in 70 a.d next the king sends out one last invitation to the farthest extents of his kingdom to the highways gathering both good and bad guests so that his wedding is fully attended this final invite represents the holy ghost gospel being given to the gentiles who were afar off from the promises of god paul and barnabas declare this to israel in acts 13 verse 46 then paul and barnabas waxed bold and said it was necessary that the word of god should first have been spoken to you but seeing ye put it from you and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life lo we turn to the gentiles the jews judge themselves unworthy of everlasting life just as the king called them not worthy of the wedding the parable climaxes as the king comes into the wedding to see his gentile guests but finds a man without a wedding garment angered the king asked the guest how he came into the wedding without the garment but the guest is speechless punishment issues forth from the king as he sends the guest into outer darkness to endure weeping and gnashing of teeth why was the king so angry about the guest rejecting the wedding garment scripture teaches how kings and rulers provided changes of clothes as presents for their honored friends or guests such as the case of joseph providing a change of raiment for his brothers although benjamin received five changes turning down a wedding garment for a king's marriage celebration for his son would be the highest form of disrespect especially from a man who was filthy from the elements of living in the highways like esther knew a king must only be approached in a respectful clean and dignified manner but this guest refused the king's requirement for a wedding garment despite it being readily available and freely offered for all guests showing his disdain for the king his son and the other guests the wedding garment represents the baptism of the holy ghost because it is a gift god offers to believers their children and all that are far off even as many as the lord our god shall call jesus says the holy ghost is the promise of the father that endues or clothes believers in power paul too uses the garment imagery for the holy ghost saying but put ye on the lord jesus christ and make not provision for the flesh to fulfill the lust thereof in revelation 3 verse 4 the lord jesus admonishes the sardis church for their holy lifestyle saying thou hast a few names even in sardis which have not defiled their garments and they shall walk with me in white for they are worthy the wedding garment is also synonymous to eternal life because the baptism of the holy ghost is the spirit of christ in your soul paul says it is christ in you the hope of glory john supports this telling believers they already have eternal life in 1st john 5 13. these things have written unto you that believe on the name of the son of god that ye may know that ye have eternal life and that ye may believe on the name of the son of god the guest without the wedding garment represents believers who respond to preaching about the end times and gather in worship with holy ghost-filled saints but they themselves fail to receive the gift of the holy ghost this guest is just like judas iscariot jesus says this guest is cast into outer darkness where there is weeping and gnashing of teeth which represents being cast into hell according to four other scriptures most notably jesus says the christ rejecting jews will endure weeping and gnashing of teeth being thrust out or cast out of the kingdom of god as workers of iniquity jesus teaches workers of iniquity can be temporarily anointed of the holy spirit to perform miracles and yet turn from christ to do their own will instead of his judas performed and witnessed amazing miracles but forsook the spirits leading ended his own will selling out christ for 30 pieces of silver like judas garment rejecting worshipers feel the attraction of true worship and understand jesus's wedding or rapture will soon occur they like seeing the life-changing power of god on others but never experience it for themselves somehow the garment rejectors convince themselves that their own garments are good enough for god's service but isaiah 64 6 says but we are all as an unclean thing and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags you cannot trust in your own righteousness when christ says your righteousness must exceed that of the pharisees in order to enter the kingdom christ is freely offering his righteousness in exchange for admission of our sins second corinthians 5 verse 21 declares for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of god in him parable 12 the 10 virgins revelation wise believers possess oil or the baptism of the holy ghost as they await their wedding day the rapture with jesus found in matthew 25 verses 1 through 13 this parable further differentiates the two kinds of christians referenced in figure 21 those with good and thorny hearts jesus now describes these two kinds of christians as wise and foolish wise christians will be ready for the bridegroom's coming or jesus's return for his bride at the rapture foolish christians will be caught unprepared and will miss the marriage or the marriage supper of the lamb that proceeds the rapture ancient jewish marriage ceremonies in the east were much different than those of modern western civilization the customs varied among families but often the bridegroom would begin a procession to the marriage ceremony at an unknown evening hour matthew henry says the bridegroom came attended with his friends late in the night to the house of the bride where she expected him attended with her bridemaids who upon notice given of the bridegroom's approach were to go out with lamps in their hands to light him into the house with ceremony and formality in order to the celebrating of the nuptials with great mirth the ten virgin bridesmaids serve the bride and possibly acted as witnesses of the wedding nuptials just as boaz requested 10 witnesses when he purchased ruth to be his wife examining the symbols the 10 virgins represent both the bride and her wedding party as they are her closest friends in short the ten virgins represent the new testament church the fact that they were virgins having no sexual intercourse symbolizes complete spiritual purity spiritual virgins today do not have any intercourse with worldliness and idolatry christ is their only love interest in complete devotion to him they do not flirt with worldly temptations paul tells the corinthians they should be chaste virgins to christ keeping their minds uncorrupted and undeceived from the simplicity that is in christ oil is the symbol of the baptism of the holy ghost because zechariah 4 says the golden oil that emptied out of the two olive trees into the seven candlesticks is god's spirit not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the lord of hosts note carefully that both groups had oil but the wise had extra oil choosing to take additional oil in their vessels with their lamps the foolish virgins only had oil in their lamps but the wise took extra oil in case the bridegroom delayed his coming which he did wise christians today have an extra measure of oil representing the anointing of the holy ghost in their souls foolish virgins have the holy ghost anointing in their human spirits or minds but not in their souls as displayed in figure 22. the bridegroom tearing represents jesus tearing for the rapture which he has been doing for nearly two thousand years the midnight cry of the bridegroom's approaching procession awakening the virgins is equivalent to the rapture shout paul teaches about and symbolizes the supernatural preaching and healing ministry of the late william branham that awakened all christendom in the 1940s 50s and 60s see chapter 7 12 and 13. please contact me if you have not heard the message or shout god gave to his prophet william branham upon hearing the shout all the virgins trimmed their lamps removing the charred portion of the wick ensuring their lamps burned their brightest lamp trimming represents sanctification or the second work of grace that follows justification william branham's shall ministry emphasize the three works of grace justification sanctification and the baptism of the holy ghost see chapter 5 and parable 15. the five foolish virgins realize they do not have enough oil and ask the wise for some of their oil the wise admit they do not have enough oil to share and charge the foolish to go buy their own oil spiritually holy ghost-filled christians or wise virgins cannot give the baptism of the spirit to anyone only christ baptizes souls with the holy ghost as john the baptist says i indeed baptize you with water unto repentance but he that cometh after me is mightier than i whose shoes i am not worthy to bear he shall baptize you with the holy ghost and with fire this is sound advice from the wise virgins as jesus invites all to come and buy spiritual blessings from him in revelation 3 verse 18 i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white raiment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with i salve that thou mayest see you again see how foolish virgins are more concerned with cares of the world physical transactions rather than spiritual transactions such as prayer the foolish virgins didn't repent pray and obey enough to receive the oil of the holy ghost because god promised to fill anyone with his holy spirit who truly hungered and thirsted for it yet the foolish live free from idolatry having no intercourse with demons while the foolish go to buy oil the bridegroom comes and the wise virgins go in with him to the marriage festivities and the door is shut the coming bridegroom is the rapture proving only wise virgins or holy ghost-filled christians go up to the meeting in the air the shutting of the door reminds you of noah's ark and god shutting the door in conclusion that no more souls would be saved this imagery fits our day perfectly jesus compares the conditions at the end of the world to the days of noah in luke 17 verses 26 through 30. in noah's day all believers gathered in one physical location the ark today god's people are gathering in one spiritual location heavenly places or the baptism of the holy ghost like the ark all those outside of the baptism of the holy ghost will suffer either partially or completely during the great tribulation once the last holy ghost-filled christian has his lamp trimmed and filled with oil the times of the gentiles will be complete god will cut off the gentile branch or people and graft the 144 thousand israelis back into the holy tree jesus concludes the parable by instructing believers to watch which in the greek means to give strict attention to the cautious active to take heed lest through remission and indolence some destructive calamities suddenly overtake one kingdom of god the teaching and preaching of the baptism of the holy ghost requires your full attention rapture ready saints will be fully focused on the bridegroom and actively working in his kingdom parable 13 the talents revelation christ commits varying amounts of talents and resources to his servants and rewards those who faithfully invest in them found in matthew 25 verses 14 through 30 this parable greatly resembles the pounds parable but as notable differences i will point out in the 14th parable the talents parable was spoken privately to jesus disciples only as he sat with them on the mount of the olives a few days before his crucifixion jesus was answering their three questions when will the temple be thrown down what is the sign of jesus's second coming and what is the sign of the end of the world the talent's parable is jesus's answer to the question what is the sign of jesus's second coming because it immediately follows the parable of the ten virgins both deal with the second coming of jesus jesus says the kingdom of heaven is like a rich man traveling to a far country who leaves his goods or money with his servants to invest during his absence the first servant gets five talents the second gets two talents and the third gets one talent the varying amounts of talents speak to varying abilities and potential the rich man saw in his servants the two servants with the most talents diligently make business trades to double their money but the servant with one talent lazily buries it in the earth after a long absence the rich man returns to reckon with his servants he's well pleased with his first two but angry with a third because he did not apply the very least effort to increase his lord's money the rich man's long absence represents jesus going to heaven after his first coming and being there a long time until a second coming christians are awaiting his second coming now during jesus time away seated at the right hand of the majesty on high his servants are given talents or spiritual gifts to invest in for the benefit of jesus kingdom examining natural talents helps you understand the value of spiritual gifts chapter 11 defines and details the nine gifts of the holy ghost a talent is a sum of money weighing a talent in the greek english clergyman john gill 1697-1771 notes a single talent was equivalent to 375 english pounds of silver or 4 500 pounds of gold since jesus did not indicate if the towns were silver or gold i will show the value of both using eric nye's online currency converter to convert 1770 ad english pounds into 2019 adus dollars figure 23 shows the values of the talents both in silver and gold imagine your grandfather gifted you some of his money to start a business for him while he was traveling overseas with a smile his last words to you before his decade long absence are do something anything i can't wait to see what you'll accomplish for me whether the amount was at either end of the spectrum having seventy one thousand dollars one talent of silver or four million three hundred thousand dollars five gold talents you'd be extremely fortunate with either amount you are not starting in debt as this money is simply gifted to you again this is not your money with the largest sum you could immediately purchase property and build a home for your business with the smallest sum you could begin renting a property and purchase machines and other assets at the very least you can invest the money in the stock market money market accounts real estate or hand the money over to bankers in fixed annuities if you desire guaranteed returns the reality of this illustration is jesus christ god's own son has gifted you at least one of the nine spiritual gifts and instructed you to do your part in his kingdom the lord says help finish the great commission display my love and power to others especially your fellow man paul urges you to be fervent in business and redeem the time spiritual gifts are a serious matter one in which jesus deals very strictly of course spiritual gifts are secondary to charity or the baptism of the holy ghost but in this parable you learn how jesus is going to deal with his servants upon his return a time of holy reckoning something jesus's return will be like a party or whimsical celebration no jesus's return is a reckoning with his servants for their efforts to promote the father's business with his own money or talents paul teaches each believer is given different measures of gifts hence jesus's unequal distribution of talents the apostle uses the gift of faith as an example in romans 12 3 instructing believers to be humble because god dealt to every man the measure of faith three verses later paul says we have gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us you may have noticed paul was endued with many gifts and long to impart spiritual gifts to the saints he ministered to perhaps paul was a five-talent servant of jesus christ paul spoke in tongues more often than all the corinthians exercised the gift of prophecy concerning future events worked miracles and had the gifts of the apostle and teacher yet instead of feeling self-sufficient and independent of god's assistance because of his many gifts paul constantly practiced self-denial forcing his body to obey god's word to ensure he would not be a spiritual castaway paul's example teaches us the more gifts we have the more responsible we must be in luke 12 48 our lord says for unto whomsoever much is given of him shall much be required and to whom men have committed much of him they will ask the more in the parable the first two servants doubled their money they were gifted the five talented servant now had ten and two talented servant now had four applying this spiritually jesus wants you to invest in your gifts so you're twice as wise for example as you were when you started serving him if wisdom is one of your spiritual gifts recall there are nine spiritual gifts if your gift is healing you'll strive to be twice as effective in praying for the sick than when you started jesus's apostles exemplify growing in their healing gifts because they had to learn from christ that some sicknesses like the demon of epilepsy only come out by prayer and fasting christians see growth in their spiritual lives as evidence of dedication to christ ii peter 3 verse 18 says but grow in grace and in the knowledge of our lord and savior jesus christ the way to grow is to abide in christ jesus says abide in me and i in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can ye except you abide in me if you abide in me and my words abide in you ye shall ask what ye will and it shall be done unto you numerous scriptures speak of abounding or increasing in everything love hope giving utterance diligence judgment faith virtue knowledge and all the character qualities of christ bearing your talent or running from your giftedness is not an option you learn from the parable's third and final servant that hiding your tail in the earth is a wicked and slawful act christians must defeat laziness letting nothing distract them from doing the father's business additionally you can see the disastrous effects of the spirit of fear in this parable the wicked servant says he was afraid and so he did nothing for jesus kingdom even falsely accusing our lord harboring fear causes spiritual paralysis and is a great sin revelation says the fearful will burn in the lake of fire meaning they are not worthy of eternal life and will not enter the new jerusalem there is nothing to fear if jesus is your lord because christ has promised his holy spirit will never leave nor forsake us very plainly jesus does not give you the spirit of fear but gives power love and a sound mind remember that god has predestined all events and assigned you works he ordained you to do before the world was founded the faithful god will work out everything if you will just believe him and humbly invest in your ministry and spiritual gifts the wicked servant is cast into outer darkness where weeping and gnashing of teeth is this is a reference to the lake of fire as christ says weeping and gnashing is experienced by the group that is thrust out of the kingdom of god and sees with their own eyes abraham isaac and jacob ruling that kingdom the lord jesus says the one talent of the wicked servant is given to the first servant with ten talents it's doubtful this means jesus gives one person spiritual gifts to another but one certain application is that christ will have one person finish a ministry that another person has forsaken acts 1 verses 23 through 26 exemplifies this truth as mathias is chosen to replace judas iscarit as one of the twelve apostles history says matthias labored greatly for christ preaching in judea before his missionary work of converting souls to jesus in cappadocia matthias died a martyr by crucifixion in the region about the caspian sea our lord directs you to recognize your ministry and be responsible for it or else another may take your crown revelation 3 verse 11 says behold i come quickly hold that fast which thou hast that no man take thy crown it appears matthias took the crown judas forfeited you must diligently serve jesus if you want a full reward second john 1 verse 8 reads look to yourselves that we lose not those things which we have wrought but that we receive a full reward the lesson is that jesus wants his closest most intimate servants to know he's given them different amounts of varying gifts but each can faithfully invest in them for jesus glory recall that jesus had to tell peter to not worry about god's plans for john's ministry but rather to fix his eyes solely upon christ your eyes must always be focused upon jesus's will for your life rather than comparing your life to others parable 14 the pounds revelation christ provides an equal opportunity to his servants and rewards those who faithfully act upon it found in luke 19 verses 11 through 27 the pounds parable closely resembles the talents but is different in four notable ways the similarities with the talents parable are obvious first a rich man or nobleman leaves on a long-term trip representing jesus's ascension to heaven to be seated at the right hand of the father during the times of the gentiles second before leaving the rich man leaves three servants in charge of his money with the expectation they will carry on and grow his business until he returns third two servants are faithful with the entrusted goods while the third servant does nothing fourth the nobleman praises the two faithful servants upon his return and severely chastens the third unfaithful servant the fate of the third servant is not recorded in the pound's parable but he is called wicked just as the third servant from the talents parable the first difference is the group jesus is speaking to here in the pounds parable christ is addressing a multitude of jews who are under expectation that jesus is going to immediately overthrow the roman empire and institute the messianic government the jewish kingdom of david free from tyranny and foreign influence luke 19 verse 11 declares this saying and as they heard these things he added and spake a parable because he was nigh to jerusalem and because they thought that the kingdom of god should immediately appear jesus knows the messianic kingdom or his one thousand-year millennial reign upon the earth is over three thousand years in the future so he speaks this parable to correct the multitudes false hope for an imminent appearing of christ's sinless kingdom jesus directs their thoughts to a life of faithful service second the pound's parable shows the spirit of hatred the entire world has for christ and the truth of christianity jesus says the citizens hate the nobleman and send him a message saying they will not be ruled by him this represents the hatred the world has always had for christ jesus also warned his disciples they would be hated of all men for his sake in matthew 10 22. many religious groups publicly and boldly declare their hatred for christianity but a sad reality is that many churches who claim to be christians hate jesus's bible commands jesus teaches this in matthew 6 24 no man can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other ye cannot serve god and mammon truly many church members claim to love jesus but hate the bible commands against cussing drunkenness fornicating adultery lustful thoughts and dressing immodestly paul states the fact that homosexuals hate the knowledge of god these false christians have a form of godliness but hatefully deny the cleansing power thereof at the parable's conclusion all the citizens who refuse to let christ reign over their lives will be slain in front of him representing the second death when sinners are tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and the lamb the citizens hate the nobleman because he wants to reign over them jesus is showing that he is king of kings and lord of lords and wants to exercise the highest influence and control over his beloved blood-bought creation but the majority of earth's inhabitants will not let christ's spirit reign over them choosing to let the law of sin and death rule their lives rather than the law of the spirit and life each person will be ruled by either death and disobedience or life and obedience as you love jesus and let him rule your life you reign in this life as a spiritual king and priest over sin the devil the world and the flesh the third difference is the amount of money each of christ's servants are given a pound again using gill and nye's work a biblical pound is equivalent to 75 english pounds or 14 335 dollars and 70 cents in u.s dollars while this sum is more modest compared to the talents parable a jewish multitude listening to christ could easily relate to this realistic wage also this smaller sum matches jesus's description as a very little amount our lord congratulated the servants saying well thou good servant because thou hast been faithful in a very little have thou authority over ten cities jesus wanted this multitude to understand their amount of responsibility compared to his was very small but the reward would be very great christians should not feel overwhelmed or stressed about their stewardship god promises to never give us situations and temptations we cannot handle it's essential to notice this parable assigning each servant the same amount of money which greatly differs from the talents parable here money is equal which cannot represent spiritual gifts for gifts are not given equally not all speak in tongues prophesy or perform miracles so what is equal or nearly equal among christians the answer is an equal opportunity to love jesus in your home on your job around your family members with your money and more nearly every christian has a home family friends job and money while some christians are given more years to live than others all christians are given one lifetime one opportunity to love god and their neighbors jesus offers many examples of equal opportunity works every christian not just preachers can act upon thereby investing their pound in his glorious eternal kingdom including but not limited to withstanding persecution yields a great heavenly reward giving alms in secret yields an open reward praying in secret yields an open reward fasting in secret yields an open reward receiving a profit or righteous man yields a profits or righteous man's reward providing food drink shelter or clothes to a christian or visiting one when he's sick or in prison yields an entrance into eternal life giving an apostle a cup of water for christ's sake yields a reward loving your enemies blessing those who persecute you praying for those who despitefully use you and lending with no hope of repayment yields a great reward along with the title being called the children of the highest hosting a feast for the less fortunate who cannot repay you yields a recompense at the resurrection of the just fighting the good fight finishing the course and keeping the christian faith yields a crown of righteousness providing a christian's physical necessities a member of the household of faith yields a heavenly reward upon a giver's account doing anything heartily as doing it to christ yields the reward of the inheritance seeking god yields rewards enduring temptation yields the crown of eternal life visiting the fatherless and widows and keeping oneself unspotted from the world yields the reward of spiritual purity overcoming sin during any of the seven church ages yields the reward of inheriting all things or all the church age rewards eating the tree of life escaping the second death eating the hidden manna a white stone with a new name within power to rule over nations the morning star white raiment having your name remain in the book of life being a pillar in the temple of god having jesus's new name god's new name and new jerusalem's new name written upon him and sitting with jesus in his throne fourthly this parable gives a detail about one of christ's special rewards ruling over cities jesus tells the servant who had a tenfold increase upon his pound well thou good servant because thou has been faithful in a very little have thou authority over ten cities two supporting texts about overcoming saints ruling cities or even nations include revelation 2 verses 26 and 27 and revelation 20 verses 4 and 6. in the first jesus says he will give overcomers power over the nations to rule them with a rod of iron this means his saints will be minor rulers underneath his own rule for scripture twice records jesus will rule all nations with the rod of iron in the second the blessed and holy saints who overcome the beast or rome live and reign with christ for one thousand years recall reign means to exercise kingly power additionally jesus promises his twelve apostles they will sit upon twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of israel what wonderful blessings god has in store for those that love him now parable 15 the seed cast into the ground revelation god causes spiritual growth by invisible means but men observe it in three stages located in mark 4 verses 26 through 29 this parable emphasizes three stages of growth in connection to the kingdom of heaven based upon jesus's words that the kingdom of god is within a believer in the form of the baptism of the holy ghost in a man's soul the three stages of growth refer to the three works of grace taught in chapter five justification sanctification and the baptism of the holy ghost jesus describes a man casting seeds into the ground the man goes about his daily routine of sleeping and raising as the seeds mysteriously spring up without him knowing how the earth jesus says brings forth the fruit of herself without the man's help next jesus lists the three stages of the wheat plant blade ear and full corn once the matured fruit is produced the man immediately harvests the grain this parable symbols are familiar but the sower has a different meaning previously the sower represented jesus the son of man but now he represents a blood-bought redeemed human preacher because he doesn't know how seeds grow and cannot cause seeds to increase but jesus knows about the growth of seeds for it was by him the word of god that all things including seeds were created jesus causes growth because his spirit is quickening power finite human preachers paul says are limited but are united as one in their efforts to both sow and water seeds first corinthians 3 verses 7 and 8 reads so then neither is he that planteth anything neither he that watereth but god that giveth the increase now he that planteth and he that watereth are one and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labor observe jesus emphasis upon the fact that the man does not know how seeds grow he says the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself man plants and waters but cannot force seeds to grow god's creative growing process causes growth without the help of man paul says the same in first corinthians three verse 6 i have planted apollos watered but god gave the increase christian ministers labor with their human efforts but only god can give an increase of souls acts 2 verse 47 declares and the lord added to the church daily such as should be saved another point is to show god's growing power while men sleep god's spirit is always working whether you are awake or asleep and he can cause you to understand truth through dreams job 33 verses 15 and 16 says in a dream in a vision of the night when deep sleep fall upon men in slumberings upon the bed then he openeth the ears of men and seal of their instruction god changes situations through his ever working spirit as he works on your behalf even while you sleep psalm 30 verse 5 reads weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning just as in the wheat and tares the seeds represent genuine christians a man's soul receives the incorruptible seed word of god and experiences the baptism of the holy ghost first peter 1 23 says being born again not of corruptable seed but of incorruptable by the word of god which liveth and abideth forever notice that nothing is said of the tares no doubt every field would have tares but this parable is focusing only upon the wheat's three-stage growth and the immediacy of harvest time the parable's main lesson is that wheat grows in three mysterious stages representing how believers mysteriously but faithfully grow up in three stages just like the wheat growing process is certain christian maturity is a guaranteed process when the believer remains planted in christ's teachings when you delight in and meditate upon the word you are like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he does shall prosper psalm 92 13 echoes this truth saying those that be planted in the house of the lord shall flourish in the courts of our god the three stages of christian growth are just as distinguishable as the wheat's three stages see figure 14 in chapter five look at paul's life for a clear example of the first stage justification or the wheat blade the blade is the narrow leaf that first springs forth from the soil just a few inches tall before the blade is visible there's no sign of life once the blade grows up there is visible proof of life before paul met jesus on the road to damascus he showed no signs of life spiritually speaking in fact he was an agent of death advocating for stephen stoning and making havoc of the church by entering christians homes and dragging them to prisons but after paul was blinded and humbled by a supernatural encounter with the light of christ ananias prayed for paul's healing and the scales fell from his eyes upon receiving his healing paul immediately arose and was baptized just like the wheat blade springs upward from the dark soil paul's new spiritual life arose upward out of his darkened condition of unbelief new life arose visible to all a new wheat plant named paul raised up justified from all his sins for the first time this new creature in christ was in plain view to all men jesus's 12 apostles are prime examples of the second stage of grace sanctification which corresponds to the wheat's second stage jesus calls the ear wheat plants grow quickly in the second stage spouting stems that range from two to four feet tall at the top of the stem is the head or spike of the wheat plant this is the ear jesus refers to the ear contains 35 to 50 grains or kernels of wheat but in the second stage they are green and need more time to mature jesus 12 apostles grew quickly in the faith leaving family and careers to preach two by two with miraculous healing power throughout judea the four gospels show they were green in many ways and needed to mature peter is a clear example because he had faith to walk on water but not long after erroneously rebuked jesus for foretelling his death and resurrection chapter 5 section called jesus 12 apostles and the stature of perfect man details the apostles growth in the second stage of grace john 17 verses 12 through 19 records jesus's tender last supper prayer for his apostles in which he specifically prays for their future sanctification jesus plainly asked the father for their sanctification in john 17 17 saying sanctify them through thy truth thy word is truth after three and a half years of following christ the twelve apostles still needed more sanctification which they received after jesus resurrection and ascension when matthias had taken the place of judas iscariot the ear stage reached its conclusion during the ten days of prayer and supplication in the upper room in jerusalem the apostles became fully sanctified during this 10-day season of prayer scripture describes the believers as being in one accord on the truth of god's promise to send the baptism of the holy ghost the wheat's third and final stage is referred to as the full corn in the ear by jesus and corresponds to the third work of grace the baptism of the holy ghost in this final stage maturing wheat turns from green to straw brown and the kernels become swollen in heart previously in the second stage the kernel was soft and if pinched would emit a milky substance after standing long in the presence of the hot sun the wheat had nods or boughs signaling harvest time in the same way a holy ghost-filled christian is both beyond milk teaching and bows and submits to every word of the son of god hebrews 5 verses 12 through 14 records the author rebuking his hebrew christian readers for remaining immature milk-drinking believers the author says the believers had enough time to become mature bible teachers but instead need to re-learn the simple milky basic teachings of christianity strong meat the author writes belongs to them that are of full age who can discern good from evil holy ghost-filled christians are mature enough to handle deep teaching that discerns good and evil in their daily lives jesus's meat was to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work mature christians also do the perfect will of god no matter how difficult it may seem immature christians not yet born again of the holy ghost still need basic milky teaching just like the immature wheat kernel that oozes milk when pinched concerning bowing paul writes like a mature bowing wheat head he bows his knees in prayer for the ephesian saints to be strengthened by the spirit in their inner man rooted and grounded in love to know the love of christ and to be filled with all the fullness of god peter says christians must submit or bow to every ordinance of man for the lord's sake unless men forbid christians to preach and teach in jesus name logically christians additionally submit to every word of god for god is so much greater than man jesus lived by obeying every word of god and spirit-filled christians follow his holy example the book of acts church serves as an example of the wheat's third stage after receiving the baptism of the holy ghost on the day of pentecost the saints bowed to none but christ even suffering martyrdom like courageous stephen and james more mature christians could not be found acts 15 26 says they were men that hazarded their lives for the name of the lord jesus christ their voices joined with paul's who said for me to live is christ and to die is gain the parable's final emphasis is upon the immediacy of the harvest once the weed is mature suggesting the imminent rapture of the bride of christ or new testament holy ghost filled church mark 4 29 says but when the fruit is brought forth immediately he putteth in the sickle because the harvest has come chapter 12 details the mystery of the rapture at this very moment god is still baptizing souls with the holy ghost around the world fulfilling jesus's great commission when the last predestined soul is born again the rapture harvest will begin using symbolism from the ten versions parable when the last wise virgin had arrived at the midnight wedding procession with her oil filled bright glowing lamp the bridegroom could immediately continue to his home for the remaining wedding festivities in the king sun parable the sun's wedding could commence once the last wedding guest was adorning the wedding garment and all those without a wedding garment were removed from the gathering christians still pray for the lord of the harvest to send forth laborers into his vineyard for harvest because there is still work to be done although some may become discouraged waiting for the rapture harvest jesus christ values your patience as harvest time nears james 5 7 reads be patient therefore brethren unto the coming of the lord behold the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth and hath long patience for it until he received the early and latter rain each mature weak plant is precious in his holy site the lord of the harvest will not lose or leave behind a single kernel on a single wheat head jesus promises and this is the father's will which hath sent me that of all which he hath given me i should lose nothing but should raise it up again at the last day parable 16 the great supper revelation after most jews made excuses to reject it gentiles should accept jesus's compelling invitation to his great supper the marriage supper of the lamb located in luke 14 verses 15-24 this parable emphasizes a great supper representing the marriage supper of the lamb that immediately follows the imminent rapture of the new testament church this parable closely resembles the king sun parable but differs in unique ways it's similar because a wealthy man is inviting everyone to a special event in the king sun parable it was a wedding but here it's a great supper in a house both parables contain three separate invitations from the wealthy man both describe various worldly motivations for rejecting the special event including farming viewing property selling merchandise and being a newlywed both parables serve as a warning and rebuke to the established jewish religious system of jesus time while offering hope to gentiles the parable's context is jesus speaking to a man at the house of achieve pharisee this man offers a seemingly pious declaration of the future blessedness of he who would eat bread in the kingdom of god in reality he expresses a false hope for the future while neglecting the present invitation into jesus spiritual kingdom jesus's sobering parable validates the man's insincerity christ who is the word corrects and discerns his empty speech by stating that those who eat in the future kingdom of god are those who forsake all without excuse to receive him now during their lifetime those first invited to the great supper represent the religious upper class jews pharisees and sadducees because judgment begins at the house of god the lord first invites those who claim to represent him and his kingdom this group makes three polite excuses to miss the great supper the first excuse is a man who purchased land and wants to go see it the second is a man who purchased oxen and needs to prove them the third is a man who recently married a wife these excuses can be categorized as chokers of the word mentioned in the sower and the foregrounds parable property work and marriage are cares and riches and pleasures of this life that choke the effects of god's word when given greater priority than christ's gospel feeling rejected the angered master sends a second invitation into the streets and lanes of the city to bring the poor maimed halt and blind to his great supper this group represents jesus's loving ministry to the lower class despised jews labeled publicans and sinners by the upper class group in matthew 9 verses 11-13 christ says this group honestly assesses their spiritually sick condition and repents of their sins through god's mercy mary magdalene the immoral woman previously possessed of seven devils are examples of this lower class group brought into the great supper by christ's choosing james 2 verse 5 says hearken my beloved brethren hath not god chosen the poor of this world rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him when the master learns there is yet room in his supper he sends a final invitation to the highways and hedges and charges his servants to compel them to come in that my house may be filled undoubtedly this invitation symbolizes god offering the kingdom to the gentiles who paul says were afar off but are made nigh by the blood of christ truly the gentiles were without christ being aliens from the commonwealth of israel and strangers from the covenants of promise having no hope and without god in the world jesus's great commission and peter's day of pentecost sermon both expressed the highways and hedges invitation christ says in mark 16 15 go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature in acts 2 verse 39 peter teaches the holy ghost promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are far off even as many as the lord our god shall call compelling preaching is necessary to call and fill god's house or the marriage supper of the lamb event jesus says compel them to come in that my house may be filled preachers must constrain or pressure sinners to repentance water baptism and the baptism of the holy ghost with divine zeal ministers are offering eternal life and no greater gift could be preached god's loving heart longs for all men to be saved as he does not delight in the death of the wicked ezekiel 18 verses 31 and 32 captures god's heart saying cast away from you all your transgressions whereby ye have transgressed and make you a new heart and a new spirit for why will ye die o house of israel for i have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth saith god wherefore turn yourselves and live ye god passionately pleads for you to live for him despise death and love life paul's godly jealousy for the corinthians to live as spiritual chaste virgins to christ was just that god's own jealousy for his children's unwavering love and devotion the parable closes with christ pulling off the veil of his story revealing that he is the certain man and the great supper is his the lord says for i say unto you that none of those men which were bitten shall taste of my supper jesus declares it is my supper and no meal could ever taste so satisfying as his no excuse is sufficient for placing a secondary emphasis on the glorious gospel of the lord jesus christ being invited to jesus's wedding supper is the greatest thing that's ever happened to you knowing jesus his heart his desires his truth and his love is the one and only worthwhile relationship in ephesians 3 verses 8 and 9 paul calls this relationship the fellowship of the mystery or the intimacy of the mystery and he was privileged to preach among the gentiles the unsearchable riches of christ accept christ's invitation to receive the word of his kingdom now if you taste of his gracious word in this life and fully digest the scroll of truth you'll surely taste of christ's heavenly supper following the catching away of his bride the holy ghost filled new testament church themes of the sixteen parables it's helpful to see god's overarching themes in the 16 parable mysteries jesus's most emphasized theme is salvation justification or the first work of grace as five parables focus on his gracious redemption plan and free gift of eternal life the treasure in the field the pearl of great price the laborers in the vineyard the unmerciful servant the seed cast into the ground stewardship is the second most emphasized theme being taught in three parables because god delights in his children being accountable and responsible once the free gift of salvation has been received god wants his children to imitate him learning to be faithful focused and loving like his own divine character the three parables include the foregrounds the talents the pounds the eight remaining parables are categorized in pairs that share themes god establishes all his truths in the mouth of two or three witnesses the theme of being prepared for the rapture with the baptism of the holy ghost is seen in the two following parables the king's son the ten virgins the theme of the deceitfulness of sin is taught in the following two parables the grain of mustard seed the leaven hid in three measures the condition of mankind at the end of the world is described in the following two parables the wheat and the tares the net cast into the sea finally the theme of the jews and gentiles is taught in the following two parables the wicked husbandman the great supper the rewards for receiving the kingdom revelations those who receive the revelations of the kingdom of heaven during their earthly lives and continue living a faithful christian life will be the same ones who rule in the future when christ's kingdom comes down to earth jesus's words prove this for he said the mysteries were given to his disciples in mark 4 verse 11 and later told them that they would sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of israel because they continued with him in his temptations not only do jesus apostles receive a kingdom to reign over but so does every true christian although the apostles reign will be much grander when you understand the kingdom of god during your life you are already both a king and priest unto god on this earth because christ loved you and washed you from your sins in his own blood colossians 1 verse 13 says you're already translated into the kingdom of his dear son of course you were also promised to reign in jesus future kingdom as a spiritual king now you reign in life by ruling over sin the world the flesh and satan like a king you're empowered with mighty weapons but yours are for spiritual warfare to cast down every evil or high thing that exalts itself against god's word and mortify every sinful deed of the flesh you are anointed to speak the word for the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth like jesus combatted and defeated satan by repeatedly declaring it is written by christ's spiritual power you control the three spiritual channels of temptation lust of the eyes lust of the flesh and pride of life not allowing sin to enter your life in order to keep yourself pure as a spiritual priest now god has called you to offer continual prayer praise and offerings to his great name fully armored christians are called to constant prayer by paul who said praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching there unto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints it is through praying in the spirit not praying in the flesh that you build up your spiritual power for jude 1 verse 20 says but ye beloved building up yourselves on your most holy faith praying in the holy ghost daily prayer in the holy ghost is the necessary spiritual workout needed to grow stronger faith just as a daily physical exercise workout is needed to grow stronger muscles as a spiritual priest you offer continual praise to jesus from your lips as hebrews 13 15 reveals by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to god continually that is the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name in ephesians 4 verse 29 paul says let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying that it may minister grace unto the hears in your spiritual priest's office you offer both spiritual and natural offerings to god your spiritual offering is presenting your entire body and mind as a holy living sacrifice to god this is imagery of the old testament burnt offering a totally consumed sacrifice when you give your entire body and mind to christ being totally consumed by god's will it is a sweet savor unto god natural offerings include giving secret alms or donations to the poor the roman centurion cornelius was told by god's angel that the record of his alms were kept in heaven as a memorial before god proverbs 19 verse 17 says god views your donations to the poor as lending directly to himself and he promises to repay you if you receive the revelations of the kingdom now and rule over sin in this life christ will elevate you to rule in his future kingdom for john says we as kings and priests shall reign on the earth while our future reign has some mystery to it christ described how his faithful ones will be granted authority and rulership over many things including cities during the one thousand year millennium you read in the talents parable that your future reign is based upon your current faithfulness in your earthly labors if you're faithful in a few of christ's things he'll make you ruler over many jesus told the servant who made a 10-fold increase he'd have authority over 10 cities in revelation 2 verse 26 christ says and he that overcometh and keepeth my works into the end to him will i give power over the nations may these scriptures encourage you to keep investing in your spiritual gifts while investing your money into the kingdom of god this makes you an overcomer and christ has great rewards prepared for you may you abound in everything faith utterance knowledge diligence and giving paul's words in first corinthians 15 58 ring true therefore my beloved brethren be steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the lord for as much as ye know that your labor is not in vain in the lord the consequences for rejecting the kingdom revelations those who reject the revelations of god's kingdom become part of satan's kingdom of darkness and will eventually be eternally separated from the king of kings jesus christ each parable details the consequences of choosing satan's kingdom over christ's kingdom the sower and the foregrounds the consequence for the two types of unbelieving hearts our hearts completely void of god's word being seared confused useless and barren the wheat and the tares the consequence for a tear is a powerless and feigned impersonation of christianity that makes jesus sick to his stomach tears are burned in the lake of fire the grain of mustard seed the consequence of being part of the false church and her daughter churches is to be judged as a partaker in their evil ways sharing the guilt and judgment of their demon-filled assemblies the leaven hid in three measures a meal the consequences of eating the fully leavened bread or false teachings of the mother church include malice wickedness and insincerity making god three separate persons brings the consequence of being a liar and an idolater the treasure in a field the consequence of a man not trading all his possessions at the surprising opportunity to gain christ is being unworthy of jesus and the loss of his life the one pearl of great price the consequence of one not abandoning his search for many spiritual truths in order to gain christ is being ever learning but never able to come to the knowledge of the truth leading to the destruction of his soul the net cast into the sea the consequence of one being partially attracted to the gospel yet living a wicked iniquity-filled life will result in his soul's destruction in the lake of fire the unmerciful servant the consequence for one not forgiving others is jesus denying his forgiveness for a man's sins labors in the vineyard the consequence for not working in jesus vineyard is a loss of eternal life which is the equal reward god gives to all his kingdom laborers the wicked husbandman the consequence upon the unbelieving jews who rejected christ's kingdom is destruction but gentiles are issued the same warning in romans 11 verse 22 the king's son the consequence for rejecting god's wedding garment or baptism of the holy ghost is enduring the awful tribulation period the ten virgins the consequence for not possessing extra oil or the baptism of the holy ghost is enduring the tribulation period and missing out on jesus's wedding the rapture the talents the consequence for neglecting jesus talents and resources is being called wicked and slothful and being cast into the lake of fire with weeping and gnashing of teeth the pounds the consequence for not investing jesus's pound is being called wicked and suffering the same lake of fire destiny as the talent's parable the seed cast into the ground the consequence of one rejecting god's three-stage growing process or three works of grace is becoming both a blind guide and liar as one will lead others away from the baptism of the holy ghost while offering potential converts false hope by telling them they are born again when they are not the great supper the consequence of gentiles rejecting jesus's compelling invitation to the marriage supper of the lamb will be suffering his chastening or wrath in the tribulation period conclusion christ has uttered a 16-fold revelation to his kingdom making it possible for you to accept his invitation into the kingdom that you might take your place in it may you submit to every word of your king now in this spiritual kingdom so that you are sure to be part of christ's future millennial kingdom what glorious rewards await us the kings and priests of jesus christ action steps to the kingdom of heaven step 1 if not done already repent in faith and be fully immersed in water in the name of the lord jesus christ seek to be born again by the baptism of the holy ghost which places you into the kingdom of god step 2 with holy ghost power from on high christ will help you redeem your time and lead you into your position in his kingdom revealing your talents and ministries step 3 periodically examine your position talents and ministries to be sure you are growing in stewardship and understanding you'll rejoice as you fulfill god's purpose for your
