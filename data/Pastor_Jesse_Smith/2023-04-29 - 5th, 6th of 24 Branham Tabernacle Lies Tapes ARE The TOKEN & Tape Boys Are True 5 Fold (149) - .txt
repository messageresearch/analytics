TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] that's just been able to read and yes [Music] greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to show the fifth and sixth lies out of 24 lies or more coming out of Branham Tabernacle As A Brief Review the first lie is that every word on brother Ram's tapes is thus say the Lord the tapes can never be wrong and the tapes have no mistakes the second lie is all answers are on brother Rams tapes the third lie is unquestionally believe every word on tape is thus safe the Lord even if brother Branham lied and the fourth lie is a false vision of a denominational mandate that every church has to play brother random's tapes so friends any person that loves Jesus Christ above all and also has the baptism of the Holy Ghost recognizes these four lies and can easily discern that they transgress the Bible the word of God now let's look at the fifth and sixth lies the fifth lie is that the tapes are the token and being part of a tape church is the token now friends both of these statements are false evidences of the baptism of the Holy Ghost because that's what the token is the token is the baptism of the Holy Ghost as the Bible and brother Branham taught so let's listen to today's current Branham Tabernacle leadership Express these lies we'll listen to these lies back to back so you can see the context in which they were spoken let's listen to these lies but they've got to catch the vision you got to play the tapes you've got to amen praise the Lord they're the tokens [Applause] so what did she have to do she had to show her token you know what I said I'm a tape Church amen that's the token amen praise the Lord now that we've heard these lies remember brother Branham never said either of these lies there are no quotes from Brother Branham that state these lies so these lies are proof Branham Tabernacle has now created their own denomination their denomination that has created their own Creeds like press play and Obey and that's equal to any other man-made Creed such as God as three persons or the Pentecostal Creed that tongues are the initial evidence of the Holy Ghost or the Creed of some preachers that say you are the message and any other statement that is not found in the word of God so these two statements are lies friends the holy ghost in the soul of the believer is the token let's listen to brother random plainly say the baptism of the Holy Ghost which is the token and then he'll say receive the token of the baptism of the Holy Spirit together baptism of the Holy Ghost which is the tokenist Hebrews 11 says all these all these and the church in this day that's received the token of the baptism of the holy spirit that the blood has been shed and on the church without and of course let's play these quotes back to back and the first from today's Branham Tabernacle leadership and then the truth from brother Brandon let's listen to the quotes but they got to catch the vision you got to play the tapes they're the tokens [Applause] and the church in this day that's received the token of the baptism of the holy spirit that the blood has been shed and without so what did she have to do she had to show her token you know what I said I'm a tape Church that's the token the whole church survived together it's been baptism odd Holy Ghost which is the token is Hebrews 11. now let's listen to God's Prophet brother random say that he's responsible for a message and he would not point us to random Tabernacle he would only point us to Jesus Christ so this proves being a member of Branham Tabernacle or any other tape church is not the evidence of the token and recall as you heard at the beginning of this video that brother Brandon said Branham Tabernacle would lose its strength let's listen to the quotes back to back messages [Music] [Music] in Jesus Christ [Music] with him in peace with him fancy Christ but in Christ he is God's Tabernacle he is the place that God came into himself friends what a joy to know that God's Prophet brother Brandon pointed us correctly to Jesus Christ and that Jesus Christ's Spirit the Holy Ghost in our souls is the one and only token so all True Believers will understand the token is the baptism of the Holy Ghost and will not accept a man-made Creed that exalts tapes or MP3 files as the token or exalts being part of a tape church is the evidence of the token those statements are complete nonsense and again thankfully Jesus Christ told us what the token was in Acts chapter 1 verses 4 and 5. he told his Apostles to wait for the promise of the father in Jerusalem and he says ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever Jesus Christ was not telling them to wait for tapes or to become part of a tape Church Jesus Christ was telling them to wait for his holy spirit to fall upon their souls quickening their souls and baptizing them into the spiritual body of Jesus Christ also Jesus Christ said in John 16 13 when the spirit of Truth has come he would guide you into all truth clearly Branham Tabernacle is not being guided into all truth they're being guided away from truth as this video series plainly shows with 24 or more lies that they're propagating to millions and millions of people around the world also John 15 26 Jesus said when the comforters come whom I will send unto you from the father even the spirit of Truth which proceedeth from the father he shall testify of me so notice Jesus Christ said when a person is baptized with the Holy Ghost the spirit of truth that spirit will testify of Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ's word is found in the Holy Bible but today Branham Tabernacle is not pointing to Jesus Christ or the Bible they're pointing people to their own false interpretation of the tapes of brother Branham and they're not even saying what brother Branham said you did not find tapes are equal to the Token in the Bible or on brother Ram's tapes you do not find every word of the seventh angel or seventh Church age messenger is thus saith the Lord in the Bible nor do you find that about any of the seven Church age Messengers because none of them were infallible only Jesus Christ is infallible moving on to the sixth lie coming out of Branham Tabernacle today the sixth lie is that Tate boys are the true five-fold Ministry and tapes are number one in the fivefold ministry and the preaching Ministry is second in the fivefold ministry so first let's listen to the LIE coming out of Branham Tabernacle that says tape boys are the true faithful Ministry and then we'll play another quote where the leadership says tapes are number one let's listen to the lies coming out of Branham Tabernacle they said get under the message display your token or you'll perish and and then when they did that then they played her a tape that's what faithfulness is supposed to do amen a lot of you praise God that you're isolated you know what I just listened to the tapes you know it is when you say that these tapes are secondary to the ministry now your tape people so number one to us is the tapes amen number two is the ministry doesn't matter tapes are first to us mistakes so truly I ain't got time to listen to their tapes I'm gonna listen to the tapes this message so with us if our number one is the tapes I ain't got time then if you teach the people and say the ministry is number two and the ministry is number one and the tapes are number two they ain't got time for the tapes it's called The Seed of discrepancy when you get anybody to disbelief or to say this message a second greater higher equal than God's Prophet it's the seed of discrepancy now that we've heard the lies friends any true honest Christian will know Tate boys are not even mentioned in Ephesians 4 verse 11. which says and he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers tape boys are not even in the scripture so Jeffersonville leadership is adding to the word of God and we all know the awful consequences to adding to the word of God according to revelation 22 18-19 and also proverbs 30 verses 5 and 6. If any man adds to the word plagues will be added unto him if any man adds to the word God will call them a liar according to Proverbs 35 and 6. remember friends these words are spoken in brotherly kindness as a warning to help turn people away from the lies coming out of Branham Tabernacle and to the truth of the Holy scriptures I'm not judging anyone's Eternal destination only God can do that but the Bible tells us in Colossians 1 to warn every man and I've tried to do it privately and it hasn't worked so now I'm trying to do it publicly as humbly as possible by the grace of God and it is actually the love of Jesus Christ that causes us to warn one another to try to help one another as Proverbs 9 verse 8 says reprove not a scorner lest ye hate thee rebuke a wise man and he will love thee if the leaders of Branham Tabernacle are wise they'll be able to accept the correction on these videos repent humble themselves and actually love the videos because it's the Holy Spirit behind it by the grace of almighty God friends this adding of Tate boys into Ephesians 4 11 is the same as the Catholic Church adding Pope into Ephesians 4 11. the office of the pope is not found in the Bible nor is the office of tape boy found in the Bible leadership at today's Branham Tabernacle is committing the sin of twisting or resting the scriptures as the Bible says in second Peter 3 16 the unlearned and unstable rest or twist the scriptures as they do also the other scriptures random Tabernacle is twisting the scripture of Joshua chapter 2 Joshua chapter 2 does not add tape boys into Ephesians 4 verse 11. I've already covered this subject thoroughly in my 77th video called Tate boys are not part of Jesus's fivefold Ministry so if you'd like a more in-depth teaching you can watch that video by God's grace friends also Branham Tabernacle said we don't have time to listen to tapes if we don't put them first that's nonsense we listen to the tapes in our homes we listen to them in our cars while we're traveling and so it's nonsense for the leader to say we don't have time for tapes the fact is we cannot change the pattern that Jesus Christ established on the day of Pentecost and thereafter and also the pattern he gave Saint Paul in Ephesians 4 verse 11. Jesus pattern has always been living preachers preaching the Living Word of the Lord Jesus Christ we respect all preachers who have preached the gospel that have died and gone on to their Eternal reward but we do not pretend that dead men are still alive and let them Pastor over us because God has always had living preachers as pastors teachers evangelist Apostles and so forth in the fivefold ministry so friends the Bible and brother Branham never said the tape should be number one so the reality is Branham Tabernacle has the seed of discrepancy they don't understand the true faithful Ministry the living five-fold ministry will always respect and honor the word of God that was delivered from the previous members of the fivefold ministry and they all work together as one this is exactly what brother Branham taught in 1961 questions and answers where he said Brethren he's speaking to the preachers I'm putting you all the same place as I am because you're just as much into it the message as I am let's listen to the quote [Applause] you see what I'm doing brother I'm putting you all the same place cause you're just as much into it as I am you are messengers of this same message now let's listen to these quotes back to back where Branham tabernacle's current leadership says tapes are number one and yet brother Branham says the fivefold ministry is all the same in other words brother Branham is not higher than anyone else he had his place his position but he's not worshiped let's listen to the quotes so number one to us is the tapes amen number two is the ministry doesn't matter tapes are first to us mistakes so with us if our number one is the tapes I ain't got time then you are messengers of this same message lastly I thought I'd share a quote from 1951 our hope is in God and brother Brown says that tape recordings are a secondary Ministry these recordings are being sent around the nation and they're going into homes and in the halls and so forth they even got us in a movie picture of the day to introduce these things and hundreds of people are being saved and healed right through these recordings aren't you happy that man's got the message on their heart maybe they're not preachers but they're trying to get the message doctors they tell me and manner of great standing in the world are out trying to win souls for Christ God can use these things in a secondary way like this may the Lord Jesus bless everyone that hears the message may they be saved and healed random Tabernacles leadership said the tapes are number one and not secondary as you heard and as I'll play again here in a few moments but notice the very man they say they follow and believe brother Branham said the tape recordings are secondary and yet now Branham Tabernacle is exalting the tapes to primary so again Brigham Tabernacle is not saying what their founder taught when did Brother Branham make tapes primary and not secondary the fact is he never did that's because he was a word Prophet who finished the mystery of God and turned our hearts back to the apostolic fathers so now let's listen to the quotes back to back you'll hear Branham Tabernacles say the tapes are number one and not secondary but then you'll hear God's Prophet brother random say the tapes are secondary let's listen to the quotes you know it is when you say or secondary to the ministry I'm so happy to see these brothers can use these to everyone that hears the message so number one to us is the tapes amen number two is the ministry it doesn't matter tapes are first to us mistakes so with us if our number one is the tapes I ain't got time then I'm so happy to see these Brethren here just a whole line of these recorders God can use these things in a secondary way like this may the Lord Jesus bless everyone that hears the message and lastly friends remember in brother Brown's last recorded sermon from Jeffersonville Indiana at the Branham Tabernacle he preached the evening service God of this evil age in the morning service he deferred to the pastor brother Neville and let brother Neville preach I believe this is a very symbolic expression of brother Ram's respect for each member of the fivefold ministry and brother Ram said he was led of the Holy Spirit to let the pastor preach that morning and not to preach himself this shows brother Ram never made himself primary above the local Pastor brother Neville so why doesn't Branham Tabernacle follow that example now of course it's because they received a seed of discrepancy they're not saying what brother random said they're not saying what the Bible says let's listen to those quotes from Brother Branham I know I had the leading of the Lord to listen to that this morning very fine and I see why you people like to come and listen to him also and he'll always do you good I'm sure in closing friends let's have a word of prayer again for the leadership at Branham Tabernacle and all these millions of people who are deceived they've allowed the seed of discrepancy to give them a strong delusion they received the seed of discrepancy of idolatry and they essentially worship brother Branham and his tapes Heavenly Father Lord we ask in Jesus Christ's name you'll be merciful to this tape Church movement and the leadership at Branham Tabernacle may they repent of their many lies may they recognize the seat of discrepancy they've received dear God their idolatry their misinterpretation of the word of God may they humble themselves and repent and dust and Ashes and get back to the truth I pray God they would not fight against the truth but that they would humble themselves and receive the truth may they receive the spirit of Truth the comforter that they might be guided into all truth back to the Bible back to the revelation of Jesus Christ in the Holy scriptures and asked us humbly in Jesus Christ's name amen if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
