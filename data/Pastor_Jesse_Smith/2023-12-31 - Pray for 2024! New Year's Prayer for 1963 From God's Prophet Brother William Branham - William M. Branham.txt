The Potter mold us each one in your own way that we might fit together with Christ Jesus as a member of his body for we ask it in Jesus name and for his sake and for the gospel's sake amen and amen hallelujah my people I would say unto the that I am the one and only God and beside me there is none other I am the Lord of creation I am the word that became manifested unto thee I am the word that comes before thee Even This Night by the power of the Holy Ghost did I not say that I would come in like manner have I not fulfilled my word every Dot and every line oh my people I say unto thee look up for thy Redemption draweth nigh and it is even at the gates I say unto thee that if Thou shalt continue to Humble thyself and not lean unto thine own understanding but follow me that thou shalt truly be found in favor in my sight I say unto thee that thou Hast seen my glory before thee and thou shalt continue to see my glory if Thou shalt remain in the truth as thou Hast heard it I say unto thee that many strange things may happen in the days to come May Thy Word word be established in thy Hearts may it be written in thy life that thou shalt not turn to the right nor to the left but keep Thine Eyes single unto me for I am a jealous God and the days are coming to an end when all truth shall be revealed unto thee and thou shalt stand alone and yet Thou shalt yet be together and I say unto thee that None Shall go away None Shall be left desolate None Shall be without a guide None Shall be left without truth None Shall be left without Comfort None Shall be left without their God for I am thy God and I am in thy midst I see my people I have heard their afflictions I hear their cries unto me and I shall deliver thee even as I delivered my people of old out of Egypt I shall deliver thee even as I have come in the fullness of my presence even as I have come in great power and in Revelation I shall be with thee Stand Fast and move not thus sayeth the Lord thank you Father God we thank you for this new year exhortation that sends us out with the hopes and with the comfort of knowing that through the speaking of these words to these men who knew not that the message is true and you are asking us to stand by it we will do all that we know how Lord to stand by you in your word receive Us in the name of him who taught us all that we should pray like this Our Father who art in heaven Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thine will be done in earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us of our trespasses as we forgive those that trespass against us and lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen
