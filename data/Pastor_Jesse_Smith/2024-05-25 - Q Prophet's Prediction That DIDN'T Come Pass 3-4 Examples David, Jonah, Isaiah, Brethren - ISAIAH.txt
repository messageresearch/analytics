TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] and my absolute is the word the Bible and as a pastor here of the church my absolute is the word you let the Holy Spirit he's the prophet of the day let him come into your heart right now and examine with the word of God and the doubts about the message will be all dissolved he dissolves all the doubts you find out it's exactly on the word for this day greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to answer a viewer's question related to my video about the 1977 prediction of William brandham it's video number 108 and the viewer's question was as following can you give one example of a prophet in the Bible making a prediction that did not come to pass please so of course that'll be very easy to do by God's grace according to the holy scriptures but first friends I'm Jesse Smith pastor bride of Christ Fellowship here in akaran Ohio USA I've been pastoring here for 18 years by God's grace and I defend the Gospel of Jesus Christ the original gospel he revealed to St Paul and then restored through the late Prophet William brandham 1909 to 1965 and also defend brother bram's Godly Christian character so this video is of course defending brother bram's Godly Christian character I could be wrong friends but it seems from this question that this individual is a rather well-known person who is against the message of brother brandham James Manuel 3671 I could be wrong on that I think I've interacted with him before but anyways this is a good question of course it's in connection to brother bram's 1977 prediction if you haven't watched that video please do that by God's grace there was mainly two reasons brother Bram predicted 1977 at least that's told on tape the first is that brother randam calculated the number of jubilees since the first Jubilee He said he worked out those dates and I believe it was the 70th or 50 th Jubilee since the first Jubilee would have happened in 1977 and of course that didn't come to pass but it's okay brother Ram didn't speak it in the name of the Lord it was just his human prediction and then second brother Bram said that the amount of years God gave to the Jews in the Old Testament was going to be the same as the Gentiles got from the time of the Gentile Church ages so about 2,000 years ago and from the time the Gentiles got the gospel they would have got the same amount of time as the Jews and their time would have ended in 1977 those were of course two mathematical calculations and brother BR was just doing his best to give people an awareness of The Nearness of the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ okay so moving on to the question now can you give one example of a prophet in the Bible making a prediction that did not come to pass please by God's grace I can give you three and then there's a possible fourth but let's look at the three here that are clearly seen in the scripture the first example is the prophet David in Acts 2: 29 and 30 the patriarch David is a prophet therefore being a prophet anyone just has to read Psalm 22 to realize that David was a prophet he prophesied of the Lord Jesus Christ his crucifixion also his resurrection in psalm 16 so that's undeniable that David was a prophet of God now let's look at the prediction he made that did not come to pass 1st Samuel 27:1 and David said in his heart I shall not perish One Day by the hand of Saul there's nothing better for me than that I should speedily Escape into the land of the Philistines and Saul shall despair of me to seek me anymore in any coast of Israel so shall I escape out of his hand and David arose and he passed over with the 600 men that were with him unto AES the son of mayo king of gath and so of course this was a prediction of David in his heart but then his actions manifested the prediction that was in his heart and of course David did not perish by the hand of Saul David lived his full life and just died of old age so there's one prediction that's recorded in the scripture by a prophet that did not come to pass of course some people might object to this example of David but I humbly disagree with them we're not sure if David said this prediction out loud it's likely that he did because all of his actions agreed with that thought and think of that friends he went to the camp of the enemy the Philistines and joined the camp of the enemy out of the fear of Saul so it's likely he said this prediction out loud but either way the Bible records this prediction for us from a prophet to show us that prophets made human predictions so again David is not disqualified for being a prophet for this prediction that the Bible records nor is brother random disqualified from being a prophet for predicting 1977 the second is Jonah 3:4 Jonah is the second prophet Jonah began to enter into the city a Day's Journey and he cried and said yet 40 days and Nineveh shall be overthrown so there's an obvious prediction there from a prophet of God and the nites accepted that as thus sayith the Lord and of course they repented in dust and Ashes and so forth and God spared them but that's a prediction that did not come to pass notice what the wording is Nineveh shall be overthrown and the third prediction is actually spoken in the name of the Lord from the prophet Isaiah in 2 Kings 20:1 in those days was hezeki sick unto death and the prophet Isaiah the son of Amos came to him and said unto him thus say sayth the Lord set thine house in order for Thou shalt die and not live so it's thus sayith the Lord he will not live of course then Hezekiah threw his face to the wall prayed and Isaiah came back in with another word of the Lord and God gives him 15 more years to live so this thus sayith the Lord did not come to pass because another thus sayith the Lord came but it's still a prediction and this prediction is in the name of the Lord we know later this is called the permissive will of God because Hezekiah did not render the honor unto God that he should have for being given 15 more years he made some mistakes of course with the Babylonian princes coming in during this 15 years of Grace and so we know it was the permissive will of God the perfect will of God would have been for him to set his house in order right there with the first thus sayith the Lord the first prediction in the name of the Lord but God gave him the desire of his heart so those are three plain predictions prophets made in the Bible that did not come to pass David's prediction that he'd die by the hands of s Jonah's prediction that Nineveh would be destroyed and then Isaiah's thus sayith the Lord that Hezekiah would die but then God gave him 15 more years instead and the fourth one that's a possibility that prophets spoke this prediction and it didn't come to pass was in The Book of John the Gospel of John this is found in John 21: 21-23 Peter says Lord what shall this man do speaking of St John and Jesus said if if I will that he T till I come what is that to thee follow thou me then went this saying abroad among the Brethren that this disciples should not die so the Bible just says the Brethren had this saying that John's not going to die before Jesus returns so there's a possibility some of these Brethren would have been prophets like Peter maybe even John himself and it's possible there could have been other prophets among the Christian Brethren the church fathers there the Brethren that were gather there with the resurrected Christ in John CH 21 yet Jesus said unto him he should not die but if I will that he T till I come what is that to thee in closing friends hope this short video was a blessing by God's grace as message believers who truly love the Lord Jesus Christ and the holy scriptures we love getting questions we love that the Bible has Answers by the grace of God the Bible's our absolute as brother Bram taught us it's got to come to one final absolute and my absolute is the word the Bible and as a Pastor here of the church my absolute is the word brother Ram said the holy spirit is a dissolver of doubts just like it was in the days of Daniel the Holy Ghost dissolved all the doubts so we're thankful that the same Holy Ghost Daniel had is the Holy Ghost we have today Daniel was among them that he was a dissolver of doubts you let the Holy Spirit he's the prophet of the day let him come into your heart right now and examine with the word of God and the doubts about the message will be all dissolved he dissolves all the doubts you find out it's exactly on the word for this day and so this subject of the 1977 prediction also goes along with the brown bear Vision video I made so if you haven't watched that I encourage you to watch it as well I believe truly vindicates brother brandom as a genuine prophet of God of course I have numerous videos on that as well but we are so thankful that the Lord Jesus Christ fulfilled the scriptures to finish the mystery of God in our day to send us a genuine prophet the late William brandham and our Prophet spoke with thus sayith the Lord and pointed us back to the Bible so we're so thankful for that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever Hebrews 138 if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
