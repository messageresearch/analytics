[4:10] Lord I am certainly happy this afternoon
[4:14] for the privilege of being in one of the
[4:17] few churches that still Worship in the
[4:23] spirit I think it's just wonderful to
[4:26] come here
[4:27] to just the feel that uh consolation of
[4:32] just letting the spirit of God
[4:36] flow I've had my tape boy here to take
[4:41] the those chants of the Lord the Rhythm
[4:46] like of the the people as they're moving
[4:50] by the spirit on tape I had that for a
[4:53] purpose I asked him to come for that and
[4:58] uh so glad that the Lord permitted it to
[5:01] happen again this afternoon or I was
[5:05] expecting
[5:06] it now reading this letter from Jamaica
[5:11] as our precious brother Smith has so
[5:14] graciously did the two
[5:17] letters uh just reminds me of when we
[5:20] were
[5:21] there you might know that
[5:25] the uh hope of faith is that what the
[5:29] your pap name the Harold of hope that
[5:32] paper did one of the greatest
[5:35] advertising jobs that we had in Jamaica
[5:38] brother Smith was well better known than
[5:40] anybody on the island Harley because of
[5:44] the the paper your paper has a great
[5:47] influence and packs a uh a great thing
[5:51] for the Lord wherever it goes I held my
[5:55] hand a while ago because it's sent to me
[5:57] it's certainly a grand sand paper may
[6:01] God let it travel to the four corners of
[6:03] the earth and do great work long live
[6:07] this church and may the spirit never
[6:09] leave it don't never compromise with the
[6:13] things of the world keep that if you
[6:15] have to be so poor that there's just six
[6:18] of you left stay right with that Spirit
[6:21] see just leave that uh just stay right
[6:25] with that worship you know today we have
[6:28] so many different
[6:30] programs and so many announcements and
[6:33] so much that just takes up the time and
[6:36] it takes away that feeling of worship
[6:40] but I was speaking to brother Mercer and
[6:43] I said just you can just relax just
[6:46] don't make any effort just just feel
[6:49] like a
[6:50] something I think it would be good for
[6:53] this nervous neurotic world just to
[6:55] enter into places like this am it would
[6:57] be healing for them just a quiet today's
[7:01] been a terrible day for me and so many
[7:04] calls and so forth and and the phones
[7:08] are ringing everywhere and and I was
[7:11] walked in here brother Mercer said I can
[7:14] tell you're nervous and I said who
[7:17] wouldn't be but now I'm quite just as
[7:21] singing and relaxing and I I just love
[7:25] that I feel if we should just say amen
[7:28] and go home the Lord would it would pay
[7:31] us everyone to have been here in this
[7:33] wonderful
[7:35] atmosphere and this is one of the few
[7:38] that's left as they tell me that all
[7:42] Pentecostal worship used to be like that
[7:44] years ago wished it would return for I
[7:48] think we need to go back to the old path
[7:51] just where the spirit has the right away
[7:55] I love that and did you notice no matter
[7:57] who it was what mess message they have
[8:00] everybody's give consideration see just
[8:04] uh sometimes you see in the church
[8:06] they'll think maybe some person say that
[8:08] wasn't of the spirit and just let it go
[8:10] on but it isn't so with brother Smith he
[8:12] just whoever it is he just lets what if
[8:15] it's the Lord It's the Lord if it isn't
[8:17] it mounts nothing anyhow so he just I I
[8:21] I like that I like that and it doesn't
[8:24] hurt feelings it just brings a love as
[8:27] someone spoken a word of prophecy a few
[8:30] moments ago it just makes everybody feel
[8:33] at home see and I think that's really
[8:36] nice may it never cease to be that way
[8:39] is my prayer for there's lots of times I
[8:42] like to come in here and just rest I'd
[8:45] like to come over here and just relax
[8:46] like this for a while I got on tape now
[8:49] so I'll just get real nervous I'll just
[8:52] turn on the tape and relax I'll be
[8:55] pis
