[0:01] greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:04] of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of
[0:06] this video is to share a sermon I
[0:09] preached for a group of new message
[0:11] Believers down in Junction City Ohio the
[0:14] sermon is from back in March of
[0:17] 2023 it has been a powerful testimony to
[0:20] see an entire group of former Amish
[0:22] people come out of the Amish community
[0:25] and now receive the bible-based message
[0:27] that God gave to his Prophet brother
[0:29] William Brandon
[0:30] this is the first sermon I preached to
[0:32] them called The Mystery of God is
[0:33] finished I believe I preach now nine
[0:35] sermons to them and Lord willing I'll be
[0:38] releasing the sermons of these in the
[0:40] next few weeks by God's grace so I first
[0:43] preached this group in March of
[0:46] 20123 then the next month in April of
[0:48] 2023 the Lord had moved upon the hearts
[0:51] of the people and by God's grace I
[0:53] baptized 17 of these new Believers I
[0:56] think only one or two have fallen away
[1:00] but the rest have remained on faithful
[1:02] and rejoicing in the bible message of
[1:05] this hour so it's been a wonderful
[1:06] testimony to see God move one man came
[1:09] to me after the April baptisms and said
[1:11] I've been praying for almost 20 years
[1:14] for a church to come out of the Amish
[1:16] community and received the message of
[1:18] the hour and he said today my prayers
[1:20] have been answered so I just want to
[1:21] share this as an encouragement to keep
[1:23] praying keep trusting in God keep
[1:25] seeking God for the Salvation of your
[1:27] loved ones and your friends God here all

[1:44] sir Hallelujah the Holy Spirit surely
[1:47] does the Holy Spirit energizes the word
[1:51] it brings life to the word and uh the
[1:54] Bible said the Bible said the word of
[1:56] God is sharp uh it's active and it's a
[2:00] discerner of the thoughts and the
[2:01] intents of the heart so in most Services
[2:05] you know we just we we we hear the word
[2:07] of God and pretty soon the holy spirit
[2:08] will start speaking right to our hearts
[2:11] that's called discernment of the holy
[2:13] spirit amen and when we know when when
[2:16] we when we hear God talking right to us
[2:18] then it perks us right up right we're
[2:20] all going to get tired of ourselves you
[2:22] know we're all human uh but the holy
[2:25] spirit's here to energize the word to
[2:27] Quicken the word amen and uh I'm so so

[5:08] brother sge had said maybe introducing
[5:10] the the Bible teachings from brother
[5:12] brandham that be okay yes
[5:15] so the main one of the main verses
[5:18] that's blessed me is revelation 10 verse

[5:40] both got saved in the same year not at
[5:41] the same place we we just met today uh
[5:44] but we got saved in the same year 2000
[5:47] and but then I heard about brother
[5:48] Brandon's Ministry the next year in
[5:51] 2001 so um you know that's when I came
[5:55] to know the ministry of brother brandom
[5:58] um brother bram's Ministry came to point
[6:00] us back to the word of God Amen so many
[6:02] denominations Point outside the Bible
[6:05] they point to big buildings or they
[6:06] point to the lust of the flesh or they
[6:08] point to Hollywood brother Ram came to
[6:10] point us right here to the
[6:12] Bible and so that's how I knew it was
[6:14] the right truth because everything the
[6:17] everything we're taught is from the
[6:19] Bible praise God so we're thankful for
[6:22] that and uh I'm happy to share it today
[6:24] by God's grace appreciate the invitation

[6:54] the days of the voice of the seventh
[6:57] angel when he shall begin to sound the
[7:00] mystery of God should be finished as he
[7:04] hath declared to his servants the
[7:06] prophets amen so may God add His
[7:08] blessings to the reading of his word you
[7:10] may be
[7:14] seated so we'll try to just preach as
[7:16] the Holy Spirit leads
[7:22] and I wrote down a few notes you know I
[7:24] might want to reference uh i' like to
[7:27] maybe start you know with uh some of the
[7:30] main teachings that brother Brandon
[7:32] brought us from the
[7:33] Bible um also like to show you what a
[7:37] prophet is in the Bible or maybe share
[7:39] more of what you already know maybe kind
[7:41] of build on your understanding and maybe
[7:43] at the end I'd like to show just share
[7:45] some testimonies about how the Holy
[7:46] Spirit has worked in my life my Ministry
[7:50] and my wife and the children uh maybe to
[7:53] raise your faith by God's grace and I'm
[7:55] sure each one I don't Levi could
[7:56] probably stand here and testify for
[7:58] hours all all God's done for him that
[8:00] would raise my faith he was actually
[8:02] raising my faith on the way here he was
[8:05] telling me all these good testimonies
[8:06] like brother this is awesome man God is
[8:08] God's going to move Hallelujah God God
[8:10] is moving
[8:12] amen because we got to get down to the
[8:14] spot of repentance praise God we got to
[8:16] get we always got to
[8:17] repent and then once we're in that spot
[8:20] we repented then the Holy Spirit can
[8:21] just sweep in and really really move by
[8:23] God's grace amen really move and you
[8:26] know kind of orchestrate the direction
[8:28] of Our Lives PR praise God what and show
[8:31] us what God wants to accomplish in our
[8:33] lives Hallelujah so this is the the
[8:36] first verse
[8:37] and you know um when I became a
[8:40] Christian maybe I'll back around a
[8:41] little bit uh before I became a
[8:44] Christian in 2000 I was raised in a
[8:46] Pentecostal Assembly of God church so I
[8:49] was raised with clapping and every
[8:51] service clapping shouting screaming
[8:53] speaking in
[8:54] tongues interpretation almost every
[8:56] service almost every service um so I was
[9:00] around a lot of emotion okay now but
[9:04] that but mind you that whole time I
[9:05] didn't want to serve God so I sat there
[9:06] like a teenager I just sat there I don't
[9:08] I don't want to serve God I was into
[9:10] sports I was into the NFL the NBA the
[9:13] Major League Baseball I was into sports
[9:16] and I didn't want to serve god um but I
[9:20] knew the power of God now the reason I
[9:22] knew the power of God because when I was
[9:24] in second grade I was eight years old my
[9:26] mother was diagnosed with liver cancer
[9:29] it's incurable still to this day it's
[9:34] incurable um and so she was in the
[9:37] hospital she already had six kids I'm
[9:39] I'm the fourth out of six
[9:41] kids and uh my the doctor said told my
[9:45] mom you have six months to live six
[9:47] months to live and so my dad he couldn't
[9:50] he couldn't handle that he was praying
[9:52] and then one night in the middle of the
[9:54] night he walked over and he laid hands
[9:56] on my mom where the cancer was and he
[9:59] said I rebuke that cancer in the name of
[10:01] Jesus Christ he said he felt a hot warm
[10:05] sensation he never really felt that
[10:07] before and he just left the hospital or
[10:10] went laid down wherever he was at the
[10:12] next day my mom went into surgery they
[10:15] were going to see if they could try to
[10:16] remove some of it now you can't can't
[10:18] remove all of it in the liver but they
[10:20] opened her up and the cancer had
[10:23] vanished praise God that was in
[10:27] 1988 and so
[10:29] I remember my mom coming out of the
[10:32] hospital I remember when we got home she
[10:34] ran she ran to the or she skipped to the
[10:36] mailbox like this she was skipping to
[10:38] the
[10:38] mailbox because she has a brand new
[10:42] life so since I was 8 years old I knew
[10:44] Jesus Christ was alive hallelujah amen
[10:47] because chemo I mean thank God for chemo
[10:50] sometimes it's good thank God for
[10:51] doctors I want to say that thank God for
[10:54] doctors but there's only one Doctor Who
[10:56] can heal everything praise God that's
[10:59] Jesus amen so since I've been 8 years
[11:02] old I've no I could never deny that
[11:04] Jesus is not
[11:05] alive he's
[11:07] real but I still ran from God I wanted
[11:11] to uh you know I wanted to do Sports and
[11:14] everything like
[11:17] that and like I said I was raised in a
[11:19] Pentecostal church and and
[11:21] and um it was a it was overall a good
[11:25] experience I would say overall good
[11:27] experience now now to today I know a a
[11:30] lot of their false doctrines but they
[11:31] have some good
[11:33] doctrines but they have some really
[11:35] major false doctrines as well um so
[11:39] anyways I'll fast forward to when I was
[11:41] 20 I was at College in akan University I
[11:45] was playing football I played football
[11:46] for akan I played with a couple guys
[11:48] that went to the NFL so I have some
[11:50] friends who play in the NFL and uh won
[11:53] some Super Bowls it was kind of neat to
[11:55] see them but yeah to God to God the
[11:57] Super Bowl doesn't matter
[12:00] God don't care about the Super Bowl God
[12:01] cares about saving Souls but it was just
[12:03] neat to see you know have some friends
[12:05] that you know that uh were accomplishing
[12:08] things but it was the year 2000 I went
[12:10] to an athletes and action conference and
[12:12] I saw a big football player raise his
[12:14] hands like this and I got the Holy
[12:17] Spirit came on me I got so ashamed of
[12:19] myself I said Jesus forgive me I've ran
[12:22] from you for 20
[12:24] years will you forgive me of all my sins
[12:27] and I started crying I started praising
[12:29] God and that's where I got saved in the
[12:32] year
[12:34] 2000 I went home from that conference it
[12:36] was in Columbus actually I went home
[12:37] from the conference back up to akan I
[12:39] took down all my I immoral pictures on
[12:42] the wall I took all those down I threw
[12:44] away all my rock and roll CDs all my rap
[12:47] CDs I don't know if you ever heard of
[12:49] Nirvana or ACDC or Snoop Dog I had all
[12:52] these awful worldly CS I threw them all
[12:54] away I was all into Jesus praise God
[12:58] Hallelujah so that's how I became a
[13:01] Christian and I went to a church up in
[13:03] aaran called the chapel they are a kind
[13:06] of like a Presbyterian
[13:07] church and they had some really sweet
[13:09] people but they didn't believe in any
[13:11] tongues or any interpretation or
[13:13] anything like
[13:15] that but I was just hungering you know I
[13:17] I heard some of the sermons and I loved
[13:19] them but I was hungering for more I was
[13:20] like there's got to be I was reading my
[13:22] Bible every day I was like there's got
[13:25] to be more where's more where's more and
[13:28] so I go to the Baptist Church I got some
[13:30] more there I was like this is this is
[13:32] wonderful there's got to be
[13:34] more Hallelujah and
[13:37] uh well then came 2001 and my brother
[13:41] Simon who's now a preacher as well in
[13:43] and preaching in the message that God
[13:45] gave to brother Bram uh Simon came and
[13:48] said Jesse you got to sit down and you
[13:50] got to listen to the sermon it's called
[13:51] The Serpent
[13:53] seed and so I said okay brother I'll sit
[13:55] down I'll sit down and listen to I sat
[13:57] down and listened to it and my eyes it's
[13:59] like I felt like the blinders had just
[14:01] been taken off my eyes and now the Bible
[14:03] made sense now I know why Jesus had to
[14:06] be born a virgin
[14:08] birth Jesus had to be virgin born
[14:11] because sin came into the world through
[14:13] an immortal sex act in the Garden of
[14:16] Eden that may sound strange but that's
[14:19] what happened because whatever they ate
[14:21] they covered their naked
[14:23] parts amen and there's no food you're
[14:25] going to eat that's going to make you
[14:26] cover up your naked parts right
[14:29] right the fruit was symbolic of adultery
[14:32] the Bible
[14:33] says okay that's in proverbs 30 ver 20
[14:37] raise your hand if you're familiar with
[14:38] that is anybody familiar with that
[14:40] couple people okay well let's read that
[14:43] since we're on it Proverbs 30:20 if you
[14:46] got
[14:50] that this was my first introduction to
[14:53] the deeper things of God the true word
[14:56] of God even from as the verse we read
[14:58] the mystery of God being
[15:01] finished so Proverbs 30:
[15:12] 20 brother Lei you want to read that for
[15:14] us brother that be okay such is the way
[15:17] of an adulterous
[15:20] woman she eateth and WIP us her mouths
[15:24] and sayth I have done no wickedness all
[15:28] right thank you sir so here we see the
[15:31] symbolism for adultery is it's liken
[15:33] unto
[15:34] eating okay and so once I saw that in
[15:38] the Gard of Eden now it made sense now
[15:39] you had two seeds you had the seed of
[15:42] God and the serpent seed now if you fast
[15:44] forward of course through the scripture
[15:46] all the you know the sons of God saw the
[15:48] daughters of men in Genesis chapter 6
[15:49] they enter marry and now it doesn't
[15:51] matter now it doesn't matter what
[15:53] natural seed you are now it matters do
[15:55] you have the spiritual seed of God amen
[15:59] and now you must be born again not of a
[16:01] Jewish lineage or a certain Gentile
[16:03] lineage but now you must be born inside
[16:05] the soul of the word of God Amen
[16:08] Hallelujah let's read that First Peter 1
[16:11] verse
[16:15] 23 I'm so glad it does not matter who
[16:18] your parents are anymore it doesn't
[16:20] matter uh who your grandparents were or
[16:24] what lineage what country you come from
[16:26] what matters is that you can be born
[16:28] from your father above hallelujah amen 1
[16:31] Peter
[16:32] 223 this is what the gospel came to do
[16:35] it came to give us a new birth
[16:39] Hallelujah so 1 Peter 1:23 brother Iran
[16:42] you want to read that brother you got
[16:43] that is 1 Peter 1 2 and
[16:48] 3 being born again not a corruptible
[16:51] seed but of
[16:54] Incorruptible by the word of God which
[16:57] liveth and and abide us forever amen
[17:01] praise God the seed we need today or the
[17:04] uh the life we need today is the
[17:06] spiritual Life of Christ to be born
[17:09] again Jesus said in John chapter 3 you
[17:11] probably know it Jesus says uh Marvel
[17:14] not that I say unto you you must be born
[17:16] again praise God he was talking to Jews
[17:19] and they didn't even he said how can I
[17:21] how can I enter into my mother's womb
[17:22] and be born again and Jesus said you
[17:24] call yourselves Masters and you don't
[17:25] understand these
[17:26] things he said you must be born in the
[17:29] soul in other words you must let the
[17:30] Holy Spirit into your mind and then
[17:32] deeper still all the way down to the
[17:34] depth of your being to your very Soul
[17:36] Hallelujah and then when God's in your
[17:38] soul you have a new life you're new born
[17:40] you're born again praise God hallelujah
[17:43] and then Jesus Does The Works in you
[17:45] that he did as well praise God
[17:48] Amen and in all of our brothers and all
[17:51] of our sisters and children children can
[17:52] be born again there's times that's
[17:54] happened when they get to a certain age
[17:56] they can receive the baptism of the Holy
[17:57] Ghost my daughter is now 11 she says she
[17:59] got it when she was 8 years old and my
[18:01] daughter danced around the church uh my
[18:04] daughters had all kinds of dreams that
[18:05] come to pass that's just what the Bible
[18:07] says when I pour out my spirit he said
[18:09] your sons and daughters shall dream
[18:12] dreams your old men shall see Visions
[18:14] praise God hallelujah they'll prophesy
[18:17] uh Visions dreams Hallelujah signs
[18:20] wonders and miracles done by the Holy
[18:22] Spirit praise God this is a reality and
[18:25] that's what Jesus wants today he wants
[18:26] to dwell in each and every one of your
[18:28] Souls praise God
[18:31] Amen so this is the birth we need today
[18:34] praise God the birth in the soul
[18:37] Hallelujah all right now uh and that's a
[18:41] whole and that in fact is a mystery why
[18:43] don't we go to that since we're kind of
[18:45] going that direction uh by the Holy
[18:46] Spirit let's go to Colossians chapter 1
[18:48] if you would let's see where Paul calls
[18:51] Paul calls the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[18:54] he calls it a
[18:57] mystery
[19:00] Colossians chapter 1 he finishes chapter
[19:02] 1 in the middle of the chapter he
[19:04] preaches the godhead this beautiful
[19:05] revelation God and Christ are one and
[19:08] then he ends the chapter with the
[19:10] mystery of the baptism of the Holy
[19:18] Ghost I just want to tell you there's
[19:19] just a beautiful spirit here this
[19:22] morning I was over there at uh Levi's
[19:25] house and I just looked out at the the
[19:27] sunrise I started crying cuz God's
[19:29] Beauty out there in nature I get here I
[19:31] just my knees hit the floor I start
[19:32] crying because I feel the pre the
[19:33] presence of God is here I feel the
[19:36] presence of
[19:36] [Music]
[19:38] God Colossians 1 verse uh
[19:42] 20 26 Colossians
[19:48] 1:26 uh now look here even the mystery
[19:51] which hath been hid from ages now think
[19:53] of that and from Generations but is now
[19:55] made manifest to his sa so let's pause
[19:57] it right there Paul's going to share
[19:59] there's a mystery that's been hidden
[20:00] from all these ages like the ages of
[20:03] Malachi like the ages of Nehemiah the
[20:06] ages of zerubabel uh the age of Solomon
[20:10] David there he's going to say there's a
[20:12] mystery that's been hid all these ages
[20:15] but now it's it's
[20:16] available Hallelujah so for 4,000 years
[20:19] of human history this mystery was
[20:21] unavailable but Paul says now it's
[20:24] available praise God Amen and it is what
[20:27] we just read it's the being born again
[20:29] of the spirit of God in the soul praise
[20:32] God that is the mystery Paul's talking
[20:34] about verse 27 to whom God would make
[20:37] known what is the riches glory of the
[20:40] glory of this mystery among the Gentiles
[20:42] so Gentiles anyone that's not a Jew I'm
[20:45] sure you maybe know that so there's
[20:47] there's one country in this whole world
[20:48] that's it's Jewish right
[20:50] Israel everybody else is Gentile so
[20:53] we're all Gentiles here today unless do
[20:54] we have any Jews here today by J okay
[20:57] yeah I rarely ever get to meet any Jews
[21:00] cuz I've always live in Ohio I hardly
[21:01] move I never leave Ohio I'm always in
[21:03] Ohio so I I don't meet too many people I
[21:06] just kind of stay in one spot and Pastor
[21:07] the church there
[21:09] um the Gentiles I was finished verse 27
[21:12] the Gentiles among the Gentiles witches
[21:14] what is this mystery it's Christ in you
[21:18] the hope of glory
[21:20] amen so the whole Myster you know from
[21:23] Adam and
[21:24] Eve down to Noah to Abraham all the
[21:28] whole mystery was Christ wanted to live
[21:30] in them in their soul before that he
[21:34] could live in their mind he would anoint
[21:36] their minds they prophesy you know
[21:37] prophets they'd write the word of God
[21:39] but he never could get into the soul
[21:41] because the blood of Jesus had not yet
[21:43] been
[21:43] shed so before the before the cross
[21:47] before the cross they were their their
[21:48] sins were forgiven by animal blood but
[21:51] the Bible said those sacrifices could
[21:53] never really take away sin that's what
[21:55] the book of Hebrew is all
[21:56] about but once and so so the Holy Spirit
[21:59] couldn't fill their
[22:01] souls
[22:03] right but once Jesus died that blood the
[22:07] Bible said it it's it's God's own blood
[22:09] the Bible says in the book of Acts it's
[22:11] God's own blood and the Bible said that
[22:13] that that God has forgiven all your TR
[22:16] trespasses he's forgiven all your
[22:18] iniquities praise God blessed is the man
[22:21] whom God will not impute iniquity praise
[22:25] God they I mean Abraham wrote about it
[22:27] David wrote about it but Paul could say
[22:29] we've experienced it praise God Amen
[22:31] because we have the all-sufficient
[22:33] sacrifice the blood of Jesus Christ has
[22:36] been shed for us and now the Holy Ghost
[22:38] can go deeper so David had it here right
[22:41] but then when that that that beautiful
[22:43] woman named BBA what happened there this
[22:45] Holy Spirit left him and he didn't have
[22:48] the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the
[22:50] soul to Anchor him so he wouldn't go
[22:53] have
[22:53] adultery right he could defeat the giant
[22:57] of Goliath but he couldn't defeat the
[22:58] giant of lust and
[23:01] adultery because because the Holy Ghost
[23:04] wasn't in the soul but Paul saying this
[23:06] mystery was HIIT all these years that
[23:08] God was going to send the Messiah the
[23:09] Messiah is going to die and then the
[23:11] spirit of the Messiah is going to come
[23:13] and live permanently in The Souls of the
[23:15] Believers hallelujah amen oh my
[23:17] hallelujah amen amen that's a promise
[23:20] amen this is a better Covenant amen the
[23:22] Bible said better Covenant better
[23:24] promises amen hallelujah don't give I
[23:27] mean I admire David for slaying uh
[23:30] Goliath but I don't want to fall into
[23:32] adultery like David did and but I've got
[23:35] power now to keep me from that praise
[23:37] God because I'm in the New Testament I'm
[23:39] under better power better Covenant
[23:41] better promises
[23:43] amen I've got Christ not just in my mind
[23:45] but now I've got Christ in my soul
[23:47] praise God
[23:52] hallelujah so it's Christ in you the
[23:54] hope of glory whom we preach warning
[23:57] warning every man teaching every man in
[23:59] all wisdom that we may present every man
[24:01] perfect in Jesus Christ is that yours
[24:04] buddy I got eight kids so I know what
[24:06] it's all about I'm always picking up
[24:08] stuff on God bless that little guy
[24:11] beautiful red hair by the way buddy I
[24:12] love that so not so often you see those
[24:15] red heads they so so beautiful let me
[24:18] give you another one here let's go to
[24:19] the Book of John chapter 7 The Gospel of
[24:23] John this will this will prove it to you
[24:25] here that we have power beyond Old
[24:28] Testament Saints because we have the
[24:30] Holy Ghost in the
[24:32] soul that's why Jesus came to give us
[24:35] his spirit in US Christ in us the hope
[24:38] of glory John
[24:45] 7:37 brother Levi said you might have
[24:47] questions afterwards we be happy to do
[24:48] that you know after eat in Fellowship I
[24:50] love questions every Sunday night at my
[24:52] church is questions and answers we have
[24:54] two services so Sunday morning I preach
[24:57] my heart out preach for an hour and a
[24:58] half and then the evening I just sit
[25:00] down I said all the kids in front I just
[25:02] sit down on a chair and I teach them
[25:04] little lessons and I say anybody got any
[25:06] questions and so the kids ask questions
[25:08] the adults ask questions I love
[25:10] questions I don't have all the answers
[25:12] but I know Jesus does praise God I'm
[25:15] trying to train the children to know
[25:16] their Bibles and that it's okay to ask
[25:19] questions God's not afraid of your
[25:21] questions praise God God God is not
[25:23] afraid of your
[25:25] questions the thing we need often though
[25:27] is patience in order for God to answer
[25:30] our questions in his own time that's
[25:33] what we need we need
[25:34] patience so John 7:37 in that last I'm
[25:37] sorry in the last day that great day of
[25:39] the feast Jesus stood and cried saying
[25:41] if any man thirst let him come unto me
[25:43] and drink he that believeth on me as the
[25:45] scripture has said out of his belly
[25:47] shall flow rivers of Living Water but
[25:49] this fake he of the spirit which they
[25:51] that believe on him should receive for
[25:53] the Holy Ghost was not yet given because
[25:55] that Jesus was not yet glorified
[25:58] look at that undeniable the David
[26:01] couldn't have the Holy Ghost like we
[26:02] could have it today it wasn't
[26:04] available right but today it's available
[26:07] today Christ can live in US permanently
[26:09] praise God don't get me wrong I I
[26:12] believe I got filled with the Holy Ghost
[26:13] in the day after I got married was 2003
[26:17] the day after my wedding day that's when
[26:18] I believe I got the holy ghost in my
[26:19] soul I was saved you know I was saved in
[26:22] 2000 but 3 years later I believe the
[26:24] Holy Ghost came down into my soul
[26:27] because
[26:28] I had an experience I never had before
[26:30] and it set me free before I was a little
[26:32] bit ashamed to praise God but once that
[26:35] once the spirit of God fell in my soul I
[26:38] was a different person I left that
[26:41] service shaking everybody's hand like I
[26:42] would just go up and I shake these guys
[26:44] hands oh God bless you I just loved
[26:47] everybody so love fell into my heart yes
[26:50] amen thank you buddy amen I can shake
[26:52] all your
[26:53] hands but just I just felt so
[26:56] different in fact it was the day after
[26:58] my wedding we were late to church
[27:00] because we just were tired from the
[27:01] wedding the previous day I went to
[27:02] church and my pastor brother Brooks was
[27:05] preaching do you know brother Isaiah
[27:06] Brooks right you that's okay he was
[27:09] preaching he lives out in Iowa now and
[27:12] he was preaching he was preaching about
[27:14] the blood of Jesus Christ how it totally
[27:15] forgives us and I stood up I just
[27:17] started crying I started shouting
[27:19] praising God and I think it's the only
[27:21] Vision I ever saw in my life I saw Jesus
[27:23] getting nailed to the cross and I felt
[27:25] the nails it's like I felt on the inside
[27:27] I felt the vibrations and I just wept
[27:30] and cried and said thank you Jesus for
[27:31] dying for my sins Hallelujah I always
[27:34] love you I always serve you I just maybe
[27:35] pray like that for maybe 10 minutes I
[27:37] don't know maybe 5 10 15 minutes I don't
[27:38] know and I just stayed after service
[27:40] praising God and when I walked out of
[27:42] there I felt like a million dollars I
[27:44] just felt like I just felt as light as
[27:47] light as a feather praise God I felt
[27:48] like I was floating out of the church
[27:50] and I just want to love every single
[27:53] person and that's when I felt the power
[27:55] of God come into my life praise God
[27:59] now so here you can see the Holy Ghost
[28:02] cannot be given well we know the Bible
[28:04] says Samson was anointed with the Holy
[28:06] Ghost right David was anointed with the
[28:08] Holy
[28:09] Ghost so that must be a different kind
[28:11] of
[28:12] anointing it was it was anointing on the
[28:15] human Spirit or the
[28:17] mind okay how many know you got how how
[28:20] many people know you have three parts to
[28:21] your being yeah you have a body you have
[28:24] a mind and you have a soul amen so the
[28:27] Old Testament they could get the
[28:28] anointing on the body where David could
[28:30] dance he could dance before the Lord
[28:32] Samson could pick up the gates you know
[28:34] he could carry the gates how many miles
[28:36] did he carry how how how's that possible
[28:39] the spirit of God was on his flesh
[28:42] am but the spirit could never get into
[28:44] the soul in the Old Testament because
[28:47] Jesus the Bible say right here Jesus had
[28:49] not yet been
[28:51] glorified the sacrifice had not been yet
[28:53] accepted in heaven Jesus's
[28:55] blood okay but but after and and look at
[28:59] Peter Peter's the best example Peter on
[29:01] on the night of jesus' rest he went up
[29:03] he he he's in front of all the disciples
[29:05] and he said he said Jesus I'll NE I'll
[29:07] die for you he said even if everybody
[29:10] runs I'm going to stay with you and I'll
[29:12] die with you and what happened just a
[29:15] few hours later they all ran
[29:17] away right Smite the shepherd and the
[29:20] Sheep will
[29:22] scatter what happened he's so anointed
[29:24] he got so much so much confidence but
[29:27] then fear strikes in the evil spirit of
[29:29] fear comes in before he was all bold you
[29:31] know he's in the presence of Jesus of
[29:32] course you'd be bold you know wow
[29:34] Miracles and Power Glory Victory but
[29:38] once he gets outside of that and he sees
[29:40] the swords and I'm going to get arrested
[29:42] I'm going to go to jail the spirit of
[29:43] fear comes
[29:45] on now look at him after the look at
[29:47] look at look at him after the day of
[29:49] Pentecost
[29:51] hallelujah look at him now praise God
[29:54] he's going down to pray and he says
[29:55] Silver and Gold Have I None he said rise
[29:58] up in the name of Jesus Christ and the
[30:00] guy got up right there in the
[30:02] name of Jesus Christ look at
[30:05] that and then look at him when he died
[30:07] they said we're going to crucify he said
[30:09] I'm not worthy to be crucified like my
[30:11] Lord so crucify me upside down now
[30:14] church that's real Faith right there
[30:16] amen anybody can talk and say well I'd
[30:19] give my life for God but wait till it
[30:21] comes down and you get arrested or
[30:22] something like that wait till down wait
[30:24] till it comes down till a gun's actually
[30:25] in your face but look at this guy he
[30:28] went from running from Jesus to being
[30:30] willing to be crucified upside down
[30:32] that's the difference of Christ in you
[30:34] the hope of glory praise
[30:36] God
[30:38] Amen that's right that's right now you
[30:42] can see that now I want to show you that
[30:43] verse just so you got it uh 1
[30:46] Thessalonians I believe it's
[30:48] 5:23 I could be off there I know it's in
[30:50] that chapter 1 Thessalonians 5:23 I want
[30:53] to show you you got three
[30:56] parts
[31:06] again this is what brother Brown's
[31:08] brother br's Ministry came to do point
[31:10] us back to the Bible and show us that
[31:13] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[31:16] and forever praise God
[31:19] Amen and church Jesus has a plan for
[31:21] each one of your
[31:24] lives he wants your life to honor his
[31:28] word praise God and then he's going to
[31:30] do miracles in your life he's going to
[31:31] do signs in your life wonders in your
[31:33] life now the amount is up to God

[31:47] are Supernatural things God wants you to
[31:49] do just things we can't even
[31:51] imagine but we can never leave just the
[31:53] love of serving God daily right man is
[31:57] do not live by bread alone but by every
[31:58] word that proceeds out of the mouth of
[32:01] God so I want to tell it straight as I
[32:04] can here first Thessalonians 5 I believe
[32:06] it's 23 yep yes there it is
[32:09] okay now look

[32:36] very core of who you are and body be
[32:39] preserved blameless unto the coming of
[32:41] our Lord Jesus praise God Amen does that
[32:44] help by God's grace amen amen hallelujah

[34:40] be poured out on the day of Pentecost
[34:43] for my yoke is easy and my burden is
[34:45] light oh hallelujah praise God oh
[34:51] my I I hate to think of the burdens I
[34:53] carried as a

[34:57] burdens you carry before you come to
[34:58] Christ I hated my dad because my dad
[35:01] eventually divorced my mom I hated my
[35:02] dad so when I was a sinner I had all
[35:04] this hate for my dad I was looking at
[35:07] dirty magazines had all these lustful
[35:09] Spirits I was watching sports all the
[35:11] time so competitive you know worldly
[35:13] Spirits I was cussing all the time and I
[35:16] had bitterness and all think of all
[35:17] these think this heavy load I was
[35:20] carrying I'm so glad I got to go to that
[35:22] conference so I can raise my hands and
[35:24] and praise God and but I went to that
[35:26] conf is carrying this heavy load and
[35:29] Jesus says come to me and learn of me so
[35:32] come to Jesus and learn how to let go of
[35:34] the heavy load learn how to repent of
[35:36] your sins learn how like learn like the
[35:39] Bible says cast your cares upon the Lord
[35:41] because he cares for you praise
[35:43] [Music]
[35:46] God so that's what Jesus offers today we
[35:49] don't have to carry a heavy load of
[35:51] sin right we can we can repent of our
[35:54] sins and when we repent the Bible says
[35:55] we cast on the Lord he cares for us the
[35:59] Bible says be not anxious for anything
[36:02] that's Philippians chapter 4 right don't
[36:04] be anxious don't let your mind be so
[36:06] anxious or nervous about something but
[36:08] in everything through prayer and supp
[36:10] supplication with God make your request
[36:13] known unto God so when you're anxious
[36:16] pray about it say God you take care of
[36:18] this and then the bible promises the
[36:20] peace of God which passes all
[36:21] understanding will keep your hearts and
[36:23] Minds through Christ Jesus amen oh
[36:27] Hallelujah we have a promise anytime
[36:28] we're struggling anytime we're anxious
[36:30] we have a promise all we got to do is
[36:31] take it to the Lord cast it on the Lord
[36:33] say Lord you take this I I'm not built
[36:35] to carry this you're built to carry this
[36:38] amen God will take our heavy
[36:41] burden and we can serve God the way we
[36:43] ought to serve god with a light load
[36:45] amen amen is Right Hallelujah I like
[36:49] that Hallelujah my two-year-old says
[36:52] Amen to my preaching
[36:54] too Hallelujah
[36:58] Jesus's burden is light the thing is we
[37:00] got to we we got to come to Christ
[37:02] willing to learn we can't come to Christ
[37:04] say I'm always right I got it all
[37:06] figured out I know exactly what's going
[37:08] on I know what I'm doing no we got to
[37:09] come to Christ with some humility amen
[37:12] amen and say Lord could I be wrong on
[37:14] something let me say like this you say
[37:17] Lord I'm probably wrong on something
[37:19] that's what how we need to pray Lord I'm
[37:21] probably wrong can you correct me yes
[37:25] cuz none of us have it all figured out
[37:26] not even the preacher not even the song
[37:28] leader no one's got it all figured out
[37:30] except Jesus right we're growing as
[37:33] Christians we the Bible says grow in
[37:35] Grace and knowledge of the Lord Jesus
[37:37] Christ why you have to grow in Grace
[37:40] because you need Grace is unmar favor
[37:42] you're going to need God's unmar favor
[37:44] later on down the road when you make a
[37:46] mistake amen you're going to need God's
[37:48] favor amen you're going to need more
[37:51] knowledge yes you need to understand
[37:53] more of God's ways more of God's
[37:55] instruction more of God God's Doctrine
[37:57] more of God's Mysteries so you can
[37:59] better serve God in this world praise
[38:02] God knowledge is understanding we need
[38:05] to grow in our
[38:07] understanding like I always you know
[38:08] learned from Co right we always remember
[38:10] the co years you know and boy I got a
[38:12] lot of understanding from
[38:14] Co I'm like why is this happen where is
[38:16] this in the scripture and the Bible says
[38:18] it it's in Matthew 24 yeah I was like
[38:22] where is this in this why is this
[38:25] happening
[38:28] Jesus said this would
[38:30] happen so I got so much understanding
[38:33] verse uh 6 Matthew 24:6 and ye shall
[38:36] hear of wars and rumors of wars see that
[38:39] ye be not troubled for although these
[38:41] things must come to pass but the end is
[38:43] not yet now look Russia Ukraine you know
[38:46] all these wars well we've had
[38:47] Wars throughout all human history but
[38:50] the next one is what helped me verse 7
[38:52] for nation shall rise against nation and
[38:54] Kingdom against Kingdom and there shall
[38:55] be famines like there is in the Horn of
[38:57] Africa right now right uganda's having
[39:02] famine the next one and what pestilences
[39:05] well there's Co right a
[39:08] pestilence and earthquakes in diverse
[39:11] places all these are the beginning of
[39:13] Sorrows so see just as a Christian just
[39:15] for you know I've only been a Christian
[39:17] for 23 years you know now I have so much
[39:21] more understanding why where is this in
[39:23] the scripture there has to be something
[39:24] about this well here it is Jesus said
[39:26] for 2,000 years these are all going to
[39:28] increase like a woman's labor
[39:30] pains right they get harder each time
[39:33] but then there's uh there's a little
[39:35] break hard a break I've seen all eight
[39:36] of my kids born so I kind of know a
[39:38] little bit about this a little bit I
[39:41] never went through the pain of course

[41:54] by the grace of God hallelujah the son
[41:56] of
[41:57] God
[41:59] Amen so there's a promise church now
[42:01] let's look at another one let's go to 1
[42:02] Thessalonians chapter 5 or four let's go
[42:04] to 1 Thessalonians chapter 4 we were
[42:05] just there but let's go back there I'm
[42:07] hitting some of these Mysteries now
[42:09] these are all Mysteries God pointed
[42:11] brother random to the scriptures and
[42:14] shared it with
[42:17] us 1 Thessalonians chapter
[42:20] [Music]
[42:22] 4 now while you're tur there I've
[42:24] written two books I was going to share
[42:25] that with brother uh Levi this is my
[42:28] first book it's just about a modest
[42:29] appearance how women should have long
[42:31] uncut hair women should wear separate
[42:33] garments than men um it's called
[42:35] restoring Christian modesty um so this
[42:37] is like a witnessing book for people who
[42:39] don't understand why do we dress the way
[42:40] we dress how come we don't wear makeup
[42:42] how come we don't wear earrings and all
[42:44] these things so I wrote a book about it
[42:46] um and at the end I introduced brother
[42:49] brandham in the last
[42:50] chapter where' you where'd you get all
[42:52] this brother Jesse God's Prophet that's
[42:55] where I got it hallelujah amen now my
[42:58] second book it was on my desk I forgot
[42:59] to bring it uh it's about the Mysteries
[43:02] that God gave to brother brandom about
[43:03] Revelation
[43:05] 10:7 brother Brandon would speak these
[43:07] Mysteries God gave him and then he would
[43:09] stand behind the pulpit brother Levi and
[43:10] say that's thus sayith the Lord now who
[43:13] do you know that does that Billy Graham
[43:14] never did that John MacArthur doesn't do
[43:17] that TD Jake doesn't do that Joe Ting
[43:19] doesn't do that none of these guys do it
[43:21] because none of these guys are
[43:23] prophets but there's one man who could
[43:25] stand there and say the Seven Seals have
[43:27] now been revealed that's thus sayith the
[43:29] Lord hallelujah amen there's one man
[43:33] that could do that that was God's
[43:34] Prophet just like in ezekiel's day there
[43:36] was one man who had thus sayith the Lord
[43:38] we don't worship the man but the man's
[43:40] pointing us to something the man's
[43:42] pointing us to God's word hallelujah
[43:44] amen because this word is alive
[43:46] hallelujah
[43:48] amen 1 Thessalonians
[43:51] 4 so I want to read you the promise here
[43:53] Church where usually I take my coat off
[43:55] because I just I like to be a little
[43:56] more free by God's grace a little hot in
[43:59] there
[44:01] too verse
[44:05] uh okay so uh in verse 13 Paul says the
[44:09] Christians were sad because their loved
[44:10] ones were dying and and they're like do
[44:12] we have any hope to see them again so
[44:13] Paul gives them Hope Resurrection hope
[44:15] amen Rapture hope amen hallelujah what a
[44:19] blessing verse 14 for we believe that
[44:21] Jesus died and rose again even so them
[44:23] also which sleep in Jesus will God bring
[44:25] with him
[44:27] amen for this we say unto you by the
[44:29] word of the Lord that we which are alive
[44:32] and remain unto the coming of the Lord
[44:33] shall not prevent them which are asleep
[44:35] for the Lord himself shall descend with
[44:37] heaven I'm sorry from heaven with a
[44:39] shout with the voice of an archangel
[44:40] with the Trump of God and the dead in
[44:42] Christ shall rise first if you have a
[44:44] loved one who's died that was a real
[44:46] Holy Ghost filled Christian I believe we
[44:48] may see them be right before the
[44:50] Rapture if not we'll see them in the air
[44:53] at the Rapture praise God one or the
[44:55] other praise God the reason I say we
[44:57] might see them before the Rapture is
[44:58] because when Jesus first rose from the
[45:00] dead how many know that the Old
[45:02] Testament saints were seen walking
[45:04] around the earth Matthew chapter
[45:06] 27 so if we if if they did that at Jesus
[45:09] first coming what about his second
[45:11] coming amen hallelujah amen think about
[45:15] that see your loved ones see uh see them
[45:17] that have gone before us and old pass
[45:19] through pass away or mom or dad and
[45:21] there they are in the beauty of the
[45:22] young age amen Church don't you think
[45:25] that would stir up enough faith for you
[45:26] to believe that your body could be
[45:28] changed amen I know it would be praise
[45:30] God Amen that lift me out of my slumps
[45:33] yes that lift me out of my
[45:34] discouragement he that raised my faith
[45:37] Hallelujah to see the Dead Alive again
[45:39] and then they vanish right out of the
[45:41] room Hallelujah no I'm not going crazy
[45:43] finally reality is coming to me praise
[45:45] God I'm finally getting in my right mind
[45:47] amen hallelujah the presence of God
[45:50] hallelujah amen praise the Lord
[45:54] amen first
[45:57] uh yeah verse dead in Christ rise first
[45:59] verse 17 then we which are alive and
[46:01] remain shall be caught up together with
[46:02] them in the clouds to meet the Lord in
[46:04] the air and so shall we ever be with the
[46:06] Lord praise God there's going to come a
[46:07] time brother Iran when we don't have to
[46:09] leave Jesus's side hallelujah amen we
[46:11] haven't even seen him yet we love him
[46:13] Hallelujah but the promise is when we
[46:15] get saved we get to be with him and we
[46:17] don't have to leave him praise God
[46:20] Amen we'll always be with our savior
[46:22] praise God the Lord
[46:24] Jesus let me just let me just put my
[46:27] hands in his nail scarred hands for just
[46:29] for five hours let me just do that
[46:31] okay let me just slip my hand in his
[46:34] side for a few moments said Thank You
[46:36] Lord here's where my eternal life was
[46:38] purchased right here can like Thomas
[46:41] said can I put my hand I won't believe
[46:43] now I'm not I'm I'm not like Thomas but
[46:45] I understand what Thomas was saying I
[46:46] want to see it Hallelujah he Saidi
[46:50] believe if I can see the scars and the
[46:52] side I believe it and Jesus said come
[46:55] look look how look how merciful Jesus
[46:57] ISS come I'll give you your heart's
[46:59] desire church if you want your heart if
[47:01] you want your heart's desire God will
[47:03] give it to you praise God amen amen just
[47:05] come sincerely like Peter did I'm sorry
[47:07] Thomas did just come
[47:10] sincerely what what he really did he
[47:12] really made a vow with God and then God
[47:14] backed up The Vow God backed up God did
[47:16] his part and you know Thomas they call
[47:18] him doubting Thomas but I think if I'm
[47:20] not mistaken he took the gospel farther
[47:22] than any other
[47:23] Apostle in other words he traveled more
[47:25] more miles than Peter to preach the
[47:27] gospel praise God people say D Thomas D
[47:30] Thomas yeah he only di for a little bit
[47:33] he traveled to India to preach the
[47:34] gospel from Jerusalem now where have you
[47:36] traveled to preach the gospel see these
[47:38] preachers trying to put themselves above
[47:39] Thomas don't put yourself above anybody
[47:41] put yourself below everybody let's see
[47:44] how humble we can be let's not see how
[47:46] prideful we can be amen amen let's
[47:48] humble ourselves praise God that's what
[47:50] the Bible says humble yourself under the
[47:52] mighty hand of God and God will lift you
[47:54] up in Du season praise God
[48:00] amen Verse 18 wherefore Comfort one
[48:03] another with these words now if you keep
[48:04] reading here we see the promise that
[48:07] Jesus will not let us go through the
[48:09] tribulation what kind of a man here
[48:12] would let his wife go through
[48:14] tribulation I mean the worst tribulation
[48:15] there ever could be if you haven't read
[48:18] those recently go read the seven
[48:19] trumpets and the Seven vows go read them
[48:23] it it's incredibly awful in Revelation
[48:25] in
[48:26] Revelation we don't want to be here when
[48:28] that happens we want to be with Jesus
[48:31] praise God Amen so that's why we're
[48:33] making ready for it right now Hallelujah
[48:36] am I think I think in the third trumpet
[48:39] a third of the ocean turns to blood I
[48:42] think on the first trumpet all the green
[48:44] grass is is burned up now I looked out
[48:46] there Daniel has a beautiful yard there
[48:48] there's a lot of green grass out there
[48:49] but when that first trumpet sounds all
[48:51] of it's burn up what what what is it
[48:54] going to take to do that all the green
[48:55] grass grass on the earth and that's
[48:57] God's judgment because they rejected
[48:59] Christ but you and I receive Christ you
[49:02] and I worship Christ you and I have
[49:04] Christ in us hallelujah amen so we'll
[49:07] Escape those we'll Escape those wrath
[49:09] we'll we'll escape the judgments of God
[49:11] because we're being judged right now by
[49:13] the word of God
[49:16] hallelujah verse one in chapter 5 but of
[49:18] the times and Seasons Breen you have no
[49:20] need that I write unto you for
[49:21] yourselves know perfectly that the day
[49:23] of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the
[49:25] night
[49:26] night a thief does not announce his
[49:27] coming no smart Thief at
[49:31] least right so Jesus comes when no one's
[49:33] looking for except the bride amen the
[49:36] bride's looking for because the Bible
[49:38] say it later the Bible say later we're
[49:39] actually walking in two different worlds
[49:41] right now Sinners are walking in
[49:42] darkness they're groping in darkness
[49:44] where am I going in life am I going
[49:45] after money am I going after sex am I am
[49:47] I going after popularity what they're
[49:50] walking in darkness but the Bible said
[49:51] we are children of the light praise God
[49:54] in other words we know EX exactly where
[49:55] we're walking exactly where we're going
[49:57] because the light is on thank God
[49:59] there's a man that's turned on the light
[50:01] that's Christ amen hallelujah thank God
[50:03] Amen thank you Jesus we're not walking
[50:05] in sinful Darkness but we're walking in
[50:07] the light of God's revelation of his
[50:09] word hallelujah amen
[50:14] amen verse three for when they shall say
[50:17] peace and safety so the UN United
[50:19] Nations or Joe Biden or whoever whoever
[50:21] the leaders are in these days the pope
[50:23] then sudden destruction cometh upon them
[50:25] as travail upon a woman with child so
[50:27] there's that idea again Jesus talked
[50:28] about the being of Sorrows right so
[50:31] here's the idea of again the earth going
[50:33] through birth
[50:35] pains and they shall not Escape they
[50:38] shall not Escape we shall
[50:41] Escape but ye Brethren verse four are
[50:43] not in darkness that the day should
[50:46] overtake you as a thief in other words
[50:48] we're going to know when Jesus coming
[50:49] back we have a pretty good idea when
[50:50] he's coming back we won't know the day
[50:53] or hour Jesus said no man knows the day
[50:55] or the hour
[50:56] but the Bible says here we'll know the
[50:58] season of
[50:59] it that's right verse five you are all
[51:02] children of the light and the children
[51:04] of the day we are not of the night nor
[51:06] of the darkness therefore let us not
[51:09] sleep as others do but let us watch and
[51:12] be sober let's be looking for the coming
[51:14] of the Lord let's be sober let's be
[51:16] sincere praise
[51:18] God verse S for they that sleep sleep in
[51:21] the night and they that are drunken are
[51:22] drunk in the night but let us who are of
[51:24] the day be sober putting on the
[51:26] breastplate of faith and love and for a
[51:28] helmet the hope of Salvation so let's be
[51:30] awake let's be alert let's be on duty
[51:32] let's be praying let's be fasting let's
[51:34] be giving to the poor let's be seeking
[51:36] the Lord let's be ready for the coming
[51:38] of the Lord let's be awake praise God
[51:40] amen
[51:43] amen verse n here it is right here
[51:45] beautiful
[51:46] verse brother Irvin you want to read
[51:48] that for us brother verse
[51:50] n for God has not appointed us to WRA
[51:55] but to obtain salvation by our Lord
[51:59] Jesus Christ amen this is in the Rapture
[52:04] passage now I want to say this too it's
[52:06] possible Christians could die I mean we
[52:08] see some of our loved ones die sometimes
[52:10] with accidents and things like that and
[52:13] we know there's persecution you know in
[52:15] uh uh what's the Kenya there's a lot of
[52:16] Christian persecution in Kenya Kenya
[52:18] right now um Saudi Arabia you know all
[52:20] these all the Middle Eastern countries
[52:23] so we know some Christians may die by
[52:25] persecution or some type of uh evil
[52:27] attack but overall as a church oh thank
[52:30] you sir I appreciate that thank you
[52:31] brother I appreciate that thank
[52:33] you now I gota be careful not to pound
[52:35] this too hard here
[52:37] so got to control
[52:41] myself so you know we're not saying
[52:43] though you know Christians will never be
[52:44] persecuted because another scripture
[52:46] Paul says uh whoever lives Godly in
[52:48] Christ Jesus shall suffer
[52:51] persecution right so there's there's a
[52:53] persecution we get from our friends our
[52:55] family our Associates our co-workers uh
[52:58] on the Internet or on social media or
[53:01] there's certain persecution we all go
[53:02] through whether it's rejection or
[53:04] mocking or making fun
[53:06] of but here we're talking about right
[53:08] before the Rapture Jesus Through Paul
[53:11] promises he says you are you will not
[53:14] suffer my wrath you w ordained to suffer
[53:16] wrath you were ordained to be saved
[53:19] hallelujah amen oh what a promise
[53:22] amen hallelujah verse 10 who died for us
[53:26] that whether we wake or sleep we should
[53:27] live together with him so whether I live
[53:31] to see the Rapture or whether I die I'm
[53:33] still with
[53:34] Jesus it don't matter praise God it's
[53:37] already been decided where I'm going I'm
[53:39] going to see my king hallelujah amen
[53:42] it's already decided whether I Die
[53:44] Tomorrow a heart attack or I die in a
[53:46] car accident whatever it doesn't matter
[53:48] whether I live or sleep I shall be with
[53:51] the Lord praise God verse 11 wherefore
[53:55] Comfort one another with these words I
[53:57] love this this is a comforting scripture
[53:59] right God's not ordained you to wrath
[54:02] God's ordained you to
[54:03] Salvation that would comfort our family
[54:05] that would comfort your family that
[54:07] should comfort all of us amen we will
[54:09] not suffer God's Wrath why because we
[54:11] believe in Jesus Christ and when we
[54:14] believe in Jesus Christ we understand he
[54:16] already took the wrath for us he was our
[54:20] sacrifice God's Wrath was poured out on
[54:22] Christ and when I Believe In My
[54:23] Sacrifice when I believe in him my sins
[54:26] were imputed to him and his
[54:27] righteousness is imputed to me amen it's
[54:30] a Divine exchange praise God we traded
[54:34] our sorrows we
[54:35] traded we traded our sorrows we traded
[54:38] our sins he took all of our sins he paid
[54:40] for all our sins and he gives us
[54:42] forgiveness back he gives us Mercy back
[54:45] he gives us righteousness he gives us
[54:46] Holiness back praise God what a trade
[54:49] amen
[54:52] hallelujah wherefore Comfort yourselves
[54:54] together and edify one another even as
[54:57] also you
[54:58] do all
[55:02] right okay
[55:07] now these are wonderful scriptures now
[55:09] let me um let me share one of them that
[55:11] was really powerful for me uh go to 2
[55:14] Thessalonians 2:7 we're already in first
[55:17] Thessalonians yes this is one page over
[55:19] there we go 2 Thessalonians
[55:24] 2:7
[55:26] so really you know so far I preach on
[55:28] two Mysteries the baptism of the Holy
[55:30] Ghost in the soul and then the Rapture
[55:33] now if you look it up there's 12
[55:35] mysteries in the New Testament it's very
[55:37] fitting because 12 Apostles right 12
[55:39] tribes of Israel 12 is the number of
[55:41] government in the
[55:42] Bible okay uh so 12 is a very good
[55:46] number Elijah when he restored the
[55:47] sacrifice remember uh on Mount uh Mount
[55:51] Carmel how many stones did he use he
[55:52] used 12 he had to plac the 12 Stones in
[55:56] order then the fire fell amen hallelujah
[55:59] praise God and God's got to finish the
[56:01] mysteries of God in Revelation 10:7
[56:03] God's got to finish all those Mysteries
[56:04] then the fire falls amen that's what the
[56:07] Bible says hallelujah the Bible says
[56:10] they got to once that book is open the
[56:12] Mysteries are finished John has to eat
[56:14] the book and then go take it to Every
[56:15] Nation he's got to prophesy to every
[56:18] nation and this messenger brother
[56:19] Brandon is going into Japan right now
[56:21] it's exploding in Japan hallelujah it's
[56:24] floating in Brazil I got a a a
[56:26] missionary friend who goes down to
[56:27] Brazil he just floats down the Nile on
[56:29] his boat brother Levi he'll stop he'll
[56:31] preach water baptism name of the Lord
[56:33] Jesus Christ he'll baptize people and
[56:35] he'll move on to the next place set up a
[56:37] church people love this message because
[56:39] this is a bible message amen
[56:42] amen and it releases the power of Christ
[56:45] in their lives
[56:47] amen hallelujah because Christ comes to
[56:50] live in them Christ in you the hope of
[56:52] glory now I'm at 2 Thessalonians 2:
[56:57] 7 for the mystery of iniquity doth
[56:59] already work only he who now lth will
[57:01] let until he be taken out of the
[57:05] way so this in this mystery Paul says
[57:08] it's called iniquity iniquity is
[57:10] lawlessness even though you know it's
[57:13] wrong so iniquity is I know not to steal
[57:16] but I'm going to steal anyway that's
[57:17] iniquity I know not to I know not to lie
[57:20] but I lie
[57:21] anyway but Paul calls it a mystery every
[57:24] remember John in the book of First John
[57:26] said there's already many Antichrist
[57:28] gone out into the world right Antichrist
[57:31] Spirit right so that's what this is
[57:33] Iniquity the mystery of
[57:35] iniquity now when I first became a
[57:37] Christian it wasn't this Bible but if
[57:40] you would let's go to Matthew chap 7: 21
[57:42] Matthew
[57:43] 7:21 when I first became a Christian I
[57:46] like I told you I was on fire I just
[57:48] want to read the
[57:50] Bible I like the I like I like the
[57:52] Chapel Services but I was W more I was
[57:54] in the Baptist
[57:55] get more truth
[57:57] there but I came to this verse and I
[57:59] thought I don't understand this at all
[58:02] Matthew 7:
[58:10] 21 Matthew
[58:13] 7:21 so this is a mystery that God gave
[58:15] to brother Brandon I've never heard any
[58:17] other preacher preach this
[58:19] before and this mystery is a mystery of
[58:23] iniquity
[58:25] and the Mystery is what Jesus says the
[58:28] mystery is that some people can do works
[58:31] of God with God's spirit but ultimately
[58:34] be lost and sent to
[58:36] hell because when they once they got
[58:38] done doing God's work they would go sin
[58:40] again and live in
[58:42] sin now that's kind of hard to
[58:44] understand but be like a preacher coming
[58:46] here he'd pray for the sick and God
[58:48] would actually heal people but they
[58:50] would go home and he'd be addicted to
[58:51] porn he'd be sleeping with three or four
[58:54] women instead of his wife and then go
[58:56] back and he would he would he tried to
[58:57] repent right he tried and then some some
[59:00] miracle might
[59:01] happen so it's like he rotates between
[59:04] two different anointings but a real
[59:05] Christian longs to live only under God's
[59:08] anointing praise God
[59:10] Amen a Christian will be diligent oh
[59:13] yeah I'm sorry I missed that
[59:14] one a Christian will be diligent to
[59:17] serve the Lord and stay under the
[59:18] anointing of the Holy Ghost praise
[59:22] God so we we we we really have to watch
[59:25] our habits is what I'm saying we can't
[59:28] let sin become addictions we can't let
[59:30] sin become a habit we've got to fight
[59:33] against
[59:35] sin
[59:37] okay so I'm in my college dorm I don't
[59:39] know the message of brother brandom yet
[59:41] I'm just reading I come to verse 21 not
[59:43] everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord
[59:45] shall enter the kingdom of heaven I'm
[59:46] like instantly I'm shocked what doesn't
[59:50] Romans 10 say whosoever shall call upon
[59:52] the name of the Lord shall be saved amen
[59:54] oh there must be a deeper Revelation
[59:57] here because I know the Bible doesn't
[59:58] contradict itself it
[1:00:01] doesn't but what Romans means is anyone
[1:00:03] who's sincere anyone who sincere and
[1:00:05] calls on the name of the Lord shall be
[1:00:07] saved amen amen but here we're seeing
[1:00:09] people that are not sincere Christians
[1:00:12] they're not well they're not even
[1:00:13] Christians now everyone that sayth me
[1:00:15] Lord Lord shall enter the kingdom of
[1:00:16] heaven but he that doeth the will of My
[1:00:18] Father which is in heaven oh so
[1:00:21] now now we understand a Christian has to
[1:00:25] know the will of God and then keep doing
[1:00:28] the will of
[1:00:29] God can't fall away like we're talking
[1:00:31] about preachers right we can't fall away
[1:00:32] when we get older we got to remain
[1:00:34] faithful all the
[1:00:35] time like I was telling Levi and brother
[1:00:38] Iran we were talking about that Salomon
[1:00:40] started off on fire if you're not if
[1:00:43] you're questioning that go go read The
[1:00:44] Book of Proverbs Salon is like stay away
[1:00:46] from Evil women Stay Away From Evil
[1:00:48] women y my my son be be holy be strong
[1:00:51] all these things and then a few years
[1:00:53] later what happens he starts marrying
[1:00:54] all these women the very man who had
[1:00:57] wisdom fell away from the wisdom now I
[1:00:59] believe he was saved at the end brother
[1:01:00] B makes it clear the Bible makes it
[1:01:02] clear Jesus quotes wisdom wisdom
[1:01:05] of but he went through an awful time he
[1:01:08] had two terrible tormenters think of
[1:01:10] that think about that he had two
[1:01:12] terrible tormentors because he married
[1:01:14] all those women that's in uh First Kings
[1:01:17] 11 if I'm not mistaken God raised up two
[1:01:20] men to torment him because he not only
[1:01:22] did he build the house of God he built a
[1:01:24] false
[1:01:25] Temple to all the false Idols of his
[1:01:27] wives think about how could he do that
[1:01:30] and he's seen the theophany of
[1:01:33] God he'd seen God in a vision
[1:01:36] twice so see that's what we're talking
[1:01:38] about we got to be faithful the whole
[1:01:41] our whole lives we can't let sin the
[1:01:43] Bible says lay aside the sin that easily
[1:01:46] besets us hallelujah amen lay it aside
[1:01:48] and run the race with perseverance
[1:01:51] praise God Amen don't let an addiction
[1:01:53] bog you down don't don't get trapped in
[1:01:55] addiction overcome it keep praying until
[1:01:57] God does deliver you praise God
[1:01:59] sometimes it's your you just got to let
[1:02:01] it go other times God has to take it
[1:02:03] away because it's a
[1:02:06] testimony it's a
[1:02:11] testimony wow so not everybody that says
[1:02:13] Lord Lord's going to heaven Jesus says
[1:02:15] no why because it's the mystery it's the
[1:02:18] mystery of
[1:02:19] iniquity workers of iniquity will not be
[1:02:22] saved because they never loved Christ
[1:02:24] with all their
[1:02:25] hearts look at verse 22 many not a few
[1:02:29] Church many will say to me that day Lord
[1:02:31] Lord have we not prophesied in thy name
[1:02:35] so that's a gift of the spirit have we
[1:02:37] not I'm sorry and in thy name cast out
[1:02:39] Devils I've cast out Devils on about six
[1:02:41] or eight times I can't remember I always
[1:02:43] forget the number but I I've had people
[1:02:45] foaming at the mouth I've laid my hands
[1:02:47] I join hands and we just pray and they
[1:02:49] start fighting me they start fight all
[1:02:51] of a sudden they scream out and then
[1:02:52] they fall down like they're dead
[1:02:54] and I'll go over there wake them up and
[1:02:56] they're like I'm like you're free now
[1:02:59] it's time to praise God hallelujah then
[1:03:02] we do praise God I've seen that just
[1:03:04] like the Bible says that's what happened
[1:03:05] when Jesus cast out Devils that they
[1:03:07] they'd fight then they'd scream they'd
[1:03:09] fall out and then you raise them up and
[1:03:10] they're well this gospel is real praise
[1:03:16] God and in thy name done many wonderful
[1:03:20] Works verse 23 and then I will what what
[1:03:23] will he say to these people people look
[1:03:25] they got under the anointing to do
[1:03:26] Miracles but then outside of church they
[1:03:29] lived like
[1:03:31] devils in church they they knew how to
[1:03:33] get under the spirit they knew how to
[1:03:34] worship God and get the spirit to fall
[1:03:38] but outside of the church they let the
[1:03:39] devil rule their
[1:03:41] lives verse 23 and then I'll profess
[1:03:44] unto them I never knew you depart from
[1:03:47] me ye that work iniquity there it
[1:03:50] is now this is what I learned this is
[1:03:53] why I was glad I was raising a
[1:03:54] Pentecostal church and I saw that
[1:03:55] tongues and I saw the tongues and
[1:03:57] shouting and speaking in tongues I saw
[1:03:59] interpretation I saw prophecy my mom got
[1:04:00] the prophecy she was going to be made
[1:04:02] well from the cancer that was a prophecy
[1:04:04] too there was a prophecy in there I
[1:04:05] forgot to tell
[1:04:06] you somebody a woman was praying and
[1:04:09] woke up in the church or she woke up and
[1:04:10] the Holy Spirit said go tell Ruby Psalm
[1:04:13] 118:17 you shall not die and live and
[1:04:16] declare the name of the Lord so my mom
[1:04:19] had a prophecy and then my dad prayed
[1:04:20] for
[1:04:22] her but I was glad I was raising that
[1:04:24] because I seen people who would who
[1:04:27] would they would they would have
[1:04:28] Supernatural things like they would they
[1:04:30] would speak in tongues but then I
[1:04:31] watched their lives after
[1:04:34] service and some of them didn't live a
[1:04:36] right life that's like brother BR
[1:04:38] brother BR went to that mishala meetings
[1:04:39] remember up in
[1:04:40] Michigan and he saw one man speaking
[1:04:43] tongues another man interpret and it was
[1:04:44] exactly right and brother man went up
[1:04:46] and talked to them afterward said how
[1:04:47] you doing he said the first guy shook
[1:04:49] his hand and brother saw a vision and he
[1:04:51] was a good
[1:04:52] man the second guy though he said shook
[1:04:54] his hand he saw a vision and brother
[1:04:56] said oh you're married to a blackheaded
[1:04:58] woman but you're living with a
[1:05:00] blond-headed woman and have two kids he
[1:05:03] was an
[1:05:04] adulterer and brother R said why is this
[1:05:07] what lord I can't understand this and
[1:05:09] that's what I was doing too that whole
[1:05:10] time when I was in college I was like
[1:05:12] what before I heard the message of
[1:05:13] brother BR what does this
[1:05:14] mean brother Braham went to his cave to
[1:05:17] find out what this meant and God showed
[1:05:20] him what it
[1:05:21] meant brother man went in his cave and
[1:05:23] the he laid open his Bible the wind blew
[1:05:25] his Bible open three times in a row to
[1:05:28] Hebrews chapter 6 let's turn there yes
[1:05:33] so the wind would blow it open he'd read
[1:05:34] Hebrews 6 and say I'm not sure what that
[1:05:36] means he'd go back to praying he'd move
[1:05:37] his Bible the Holy Spirit would blow
[1:05:39] again Hebrews
[1:05:45] 6 read again the holy spirit will blow
[1:05:47] again Hebrews chapter
[1:05:53] 6
[1:05:54] now verse four Hebrews
[1:05:58] 6:4 and this is why church I rejoice in
[1:06:01] any miracle any miracle I hear that
[1:06:03] seems to be God I'll say amen I hope
[1:06:05] it's great but I always watch the
[1:06:07] people's lives after the
[1:06:09] miracle because I know what Jesus said
[1:06:12] if they're working iniquity outside of
[1:06:14] the church or outside their lives
[1:06:16] something's wrong amen yet I can rejoice
[1:06:19] in that Miracle whatever it is I Rejoice
[1:06:21] how they got under the spirit there but
[1:06:22] they better stay under that SP
[1:06:25] and this is a revelation God gave to
[1:06:27] brother Brandon he preached it and he
[1:06:28] called it the anointed ones of the end
[1:06:30] time one of the most powerful sermons
[1:06:31] I've ever heard in my
[1:06:33] life once I listen to that I my mind
[1:06:35] would explode like oh now I know what
[1:06:37] Matthew 7 means I never understood it
[1:06:40] till then like it it it hurt me like how
[1:06:42] could people do Miracles and go to hell
[1:06:45] like it hurt me like Jesus I don't
[1:06:46] understand but then I heard God's
[1:06:47] Prophet preaching like oh it makes
[1:06:49] perfect sense now amen they just they
[1:06:51] they partake of both cups but the Bible
[1:06:54] said don't be a partaker of both cups
[1:06:55] amen how can two walk together except
[1:06:57] they be agreed praise
[1:06:59] Goden you can't drink from the devil's
[1:07:02] cup and God's cup drink from one of the
[1:07:04] other praise
[1:07:06] God verse four for it is impossible for
[1:07:09] those who are once enlightened and have
[1:07:10] tasted of the Heavenly gift and were
[1:07:12] made partakers of the Holy Ghost and
[1:07:14] have tasted the good word of God and the
[1:07:16] powers of the world to
[1:07:18] come verse six if they shall fall away
[1:07:22] to renew them again unto repent
[1:07:24] seeing They Crucified to themselves as
[1:07:26] Son of God aresh and put into an open
[1:07:29] Shain did you did you catch that they're
[1:07:31] tasting on God's word they're enjoying
[1:07:34] they're feasting on this they're
[1:07:35] feasting on this but then at some point
[1:07:37] they crucify the word they kill the word
[1:07:40] and they don't want to obey the word
[1:07:43] anymore yeah at one time they're feing I
[1:07:45] love this and God's pow fall and God's
[1:07:47] doing
[1:07:48] Miracles but then they say I don't want
[1:07:50] to live that I don't believe that I'd
[1:07:52] rather work iniquity I'd rather do my
[1:07:55] will rather than God's Will and Jesus
[1:07:57] said those are the kind of people that
[1:07:58] are going to go to
[1:08:00] hell how many know how many know though
[1:08:02] that you're on the road to Heaven praise
[1:08:03] God Amen Hallelujah I'm not on the
[1:08:05] devil's Road I'm on the Highway of
[1:08:06] Holiness praise God so every day I
[1:08:09] search my life every day I pray every
[1:08:11] day we seek God and say Lord created me
[1:08:14] a clean
[1:08:15] heart forgive me my Stakes every day we
[1:08:18] should pray forgiving my sakes for each
[1:08:19] day right but Lord Purge my heart
[1:08:21] cleanse my heart make me pure Lead Me In
[1:08:23] pass of righteousness I don't want to be
[1:08:25] a worker of iniquity I want to be a
[1:08:27] worker of
[1:08:28] righteousness amen let's finish that
[1:08:30] verse did we finish it no we didn't
[1:08:32] finish it close my Bible Hebrews
[1:08:37] 6 now before we read verse 7 a modern
[1:08:41] example of this or an easy example of
[1:08:42] this is Judas es scariot Judas es
[1:08:44] scariot was sent out to raise the dead
[1:08:47] heal the sick cast out
[1:08:49] devils and on the night of the Betrayal
[1:08:52] Jesus said one of you is going to
[1:08:54] forgive me and Jesus never and the
[1:08:56] disciples never looked over and said I
[1:08:58] know it's
[1:09:00] Judas he was a worker of iniquity for
[1:09:02] three and a half
[1:09:04] years the Bible said he carried the bag
[1:09:07] and the Bible makes it sound like maybe
[1:09:08] he stole money from the ministry
[1:09:11] maybe remember he had a thief's heart
[1:09:13] the Bible
[1:09:14] said yeah on the night Jesus says one of
[1:09:17] you is going to betray me nobody looked
[1:09:19] over at Judas because it was the mystery
[1:09:20] of iniquity he had done all the Miracles
[1:09:23] they' done
[1:09:24] yes he had gone on all the missionary
[1:09:26] trips think about that he done he he'd
[1:09:28] been he'd been faithful with the
[1:09:31] finances man when it come down to it
[1:09:36] Jesus said what you got to do go do
[1:09:38] quickly he was so hungry for money he
[1:09:40] sold out the
[1:09:41] gospel he tasted of the Heavenly gifts
[1:09:44] he had seen the Miracles he'd seen Jesus
[1:09:46] walk on water he'd seen Jesus raised
[1:09:48] Lazarus from the dead he'd seen all
[1:09:49] these things but he'd rather have money
[1:09:51] than Christ I don't know about you but
[1:09:53] I'd rather have Christ and all the money
[1:09:54] in the world
[1:09:55] Amen
[1:09:57] Hallelujah CU money will perish Moss
[1:10:00] will come down and eat and Destroy but
[1:10:02] your Treasures in Heaven are
[1:10:03] imperishable hallelujah
[1:10:06] amen so think of Judas a scar he tasted
[1:10:09] on the things of
[1:10:11] God but then he sold out Jesus for
[1:10:16] money that's what a lot of preachers do
[1:10:18] today they sell out this message for
[1:10:20] their denominational money amen I know
[1:10:23] preacher this message was brought to my
[1:10:25] brother Simon took the message to a
[1:10:27] preacher and he said I I believe the
[1:10:29] water baptism should be full of imersion
[1:10:32] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ but
[1:10:34] I can't do it because I'll lose my
[1:10:38] pension and you know what happened to
[1:10:39] him he got Parkinson so bad he shakes to
[1:10:42] this day we prayed over him we asked God
[1:10:44] to have mercy on him but he won't come
[1:10:45] out of his
[1:10:47] denomination he knows it's right but he
[1:10:50] won't preach it and God basically made
[1:10:52] him he took his voice voed down to this
[1:10:54] loud voice to just a whisper now and he
[1:10:56] still preaches but he just Whispers he
[1:10:57] shakes like this all the time no I'm not
[1:10:59] I'm not making fun of him or anything
[1:11:00] like that I'm just saying when the word
[1:11:01] of God comes to you we better believe it
[1:11:03] we better want the word of God more than
[1:11:05] money praise God Amen but Judas wanted
[1:11:08] money more than the word of God that's
[1:11:11] why I don't care if my church is small I
[1:11:12] don't care as long as Jesus is there
[1:11:14] that's all that matters praise God I
[1:11:16] ain't trying to be big I'm trying to let
[1:11:17] Jesus be big amen I'm trying to let this
[1:11:19] word this word is what to attract
[1:11:21] Believers praise God God's got big
[1:11:23] churches small churches the main thing I
[1:11:26] I want to be in God's Church
[1:11:28] Hallelujah that's what I want praise
[1:11:31] God brother brand says it's a variety
[1:11:33] God likes a variety God likes blue
[1:11:34] flowers pink flowers purple flowers
[1:11:36] white flowers God likes big churches and
[1:11:38] God likes little churches like mine too
[1:11:41] God's like God likes little churches
[1:11:42] like yours too amen and the church
[1:11:46] said God loves little churches just like
[1:11:48] he loves big churches as long as they're
[1:11:50] faithful to his word amen as long as
[1:11:52] that they're workers of righteousness
[1:11:53] amen and not workers of iniquity amen
[1:11:57] now does that help by God's grace can
[1:11:58] everybody see that verse 7 now here
[1:12:00] here's why it happens the the reason it
[1:12:03] really happens is because Judas had a
[1:12:04] wrong seed inside of him he didn't he he
[1:12:07] didn't really want the seed of God right
[1:12:09] we talked about earlier you got to be
[1:12:10] born again of the seed of
[1:12:12] God and the Bible Compares it to like a
[1:12:15] regular herb and then weeds so I love
[1:12:18] how the Bible is so simple the reason
[1:12:20] these people can go to hell doing
[1:12:21] Miracles is because they originally were
[1:12:24] the wrong
[1:12:25] seed right originally God knew they were
[1:12:28] the wrong seed they were they wanted to
[1:12:29] sell out God they wanted
[1:12:32] money and it all boils down to the seed
[1:12:35] that's inside of you amen that's why we
[1:12:37] got to pray Lord give me your seed give
[1:12:39] me your life let your spirit dwell in me
[1:12:41] fill me with the Holy Ghost praise God
[1:12:44] Amen verse seven for the Earth which
[1:12:47] drth in the rain that cometh down upon
[1:12:49] it and bringeth forth herbs meat for
[1:12:51] them by whom it is dressed receiveth the
[1:12:53] blessing from God okay so good plants
[1:12:56] get the rain that's the it's the type of
[1:12:57] the Holy Spirit right we're the good
[1:13:00] plants we get the rain of the Holy
[1:13:01] Spirit verse eight but that which beare
[1:13:04] thorns and Briars is rejected and is
[1:13:06] nigh unto
[1:13:09] cursing whose end is to be burned but
[1:13:11] beloved we are persuaded better things
[1:13:13] of you and things that accompany
[1:13:15] salvation though thus we speak okay so
[1:13:17] now we can see the mystery is this
[1:13:20] there's there's uh there's good plants
[1:13:22] and then there's weeds
[1:13:24] both get the rain both get the anointing
[1:13:26] of the Holy Ghost but watch that watch
[1:13:29] both seeds and they will ultimately
[1:13:31] produce what's in their hearts amen give
[1:13:35] it some time amen I I don't care who it
[1:13:37] is give each person time they're really
[1:13:38] going to show what seeds inside of them
[1:13:40] they're either going to bring forth the
[1:13:41] fruits of the spirit or fruits of
[1:13:43] unrighteousness Amen Hallelujah Jesus
[1:13:47] said how do you know those false
[1:13:48] prophets by their fruits they are
[1:13:50] known
[1:13:52] Hallelujah amen look at a person's life
[1:13:55] what are they ultimately producing they
[1:13:57] should be producing Christ amen now it's
[1:14:00] almost 11:30 can you believe that almost
[1:14:03] 11:30 I looked over there like what time
[1:14:04] was it oh my goodness so let me finish
[1:14:07] up here I better finish
[1:14:10] [Laughter]
[1:14:15] up you're sweet people by God's grace
[1:14:18] the Lord bless
[1:14:20] you but I just want to share that with
[1:14:22] you that was so helpful to me because
[1:14:23] brother I grew up seeing tongues
[1:14:25] interpretations healings my own mind but
[1:14:27] I looked at these people's lives and
[1:14:28] said well some of them live good but
[1:14:29] some of them do not live good what's
[1:14:31] going
[1:14:31] on how can God
[1:14:34] bless how can God bless that kind of
[1:14:38] life and I found out this is why there's
[1:14:41] two different seeds both plants get the
[1:14:44] rain but each seed is going to bring
[1:14:46] forth its own God oh Hallelujah let the
[1:14:49] seed of God Be in my Heart praise God
[1:14:52] Lord let me produce prod the right fruit
[1:14:54] of the spirit praise God that's my
[1:14:59] prayer now let me
[1:15:06] um let me uh hit a few more scriptures
[1:15:09] uh how good are how good do you guys
[1:15:11] know water baptism in the name of the
[1:15:13] Lord Jesus Christ do you know that water
[1:15:14] you know the water
[1:15:16] baptism I I read brother brand books on
[1:15:20] that and I was actually baptized last
[1:15:24] summer uh submerged I I we would have
[1:15:28] just I grew up with with just sprinkling
[1:15:31] okay yes okay great great wonderful
[1:15:34] thank you what anything else I was I was
[1:15:38] I was I read that and I was like the
[1:15:41] name of the Lord Jesus Christ is that
[1:15:43] that's what brandham does yes brother
[1:15:46] brandham because they baptized me I was
[1:15:49] thinking later and I actually went back
[1:15:51] and listened to the recording because I
[1:15:52] was like I think that's what I was
[1:15:53] baptized in so then I went back and they
[1:15:56] said in the name of the Father the
[1:15:58] Son the Holy Spirit In The Name of Jesus
[1:16:01] Christ how did they say did cuz someone
[1:16:03] they they they did it in the name of Jes
[1:16:05] they said those but they also said in
[1:16:07] the name of I baptized you in the name
[1:16:08] of Jesus Christ okay okay um anyway I I
[1:16:12] thought about that because I knew and
[1:16:14] I've still got the recording it was
[1:16:16] obviously where I came from if I would
[1:16:18] have done that I would have been totally
[1:16:20] thrown out sure um but yeah no
[1:16:23] I always thought baptism was submerging
[1:16:26] I me like in my heart I thought yes good
[1:16:29] read that and I was like I like that
[1:16:32] amen yes wonderful so yeah let's let's
[1:16:35] show that um came up out of the water
[1:16:37] let me look up that scripture real quick
[1:16:38] here I don't have all the Bible
[1:16:43] memorized okay so it's
[1:16:48] um
[1:16:52] came
[1:16:58] yeah could I yeah I know they went down
[1:17:00] into the water that's acts
[1:17:02] 8 I thought there was a one where they
[1:17:04] come up out of the water came up out of
[1:17:07] the water there it is yeah yep Mark 1110
[1:17:09] there it is yeah what what one you got
[1:17:11] brother Levi which one you got brother
[1:17:12] that's actually the same one I was just
[1:17:13] looking at Mark 110 yes okay yes let's
[1:17:16] read that one thank you brother
[1:17:17] wonderful yeah that's a great one too
[1:17:19] brother uh Irvin with the uh the unic
[1:17:21] the Bible said they went down in into
[1:17:23] the water right good very good what's
[1:17:26] that says both of them went down yes
[1:17:28] both of yes very good both of them went
[1:17:29] down there yes sir there still people
[1:17:31] arguing that they just went down to dip
[1:17:33] their Cup in and Frink water on top
[1:17:36] think the B says that sure doesn't it
[1:17:39] say
[1:17:41] that John the Baptist he was bapt which
[1:17:44] he would have been before Jesus I guess
[1:17:46] but it says that he would have baptized
[1:17:48] in the river of Jordan yeah that's right
[1:17:50] but he baptized Jesus and it says here
[1:17:53] great way coming up out of the water
[1:17:55] that's right he saw the heavens open and
[1:17:56] the spirit like a do descending upon yes
[1:17:59] sir yep so Mark if you take Mark 1:10
[1:18:03] and straightway coming up out of the
[1:18:04] water he saw the heavens open and the
[1:18:06] spirit like a dove descending upon him
[1:18:08] so Jesus came up out of the water when
[1:18:10] he was baptized right and Jesus said it
[1:18:13] becometh me to fulfill all right I it
[1:18:14] becometh us to fulfill all righteousness
[1:18:16] in other words whatever we saw Jesus do
[1:18:18] that's what we need to
[1:18:19] do so if Jesus was fully immersed in
[1:18:21] water then we need to be fully mer and
[1:18:23] water and also there's a scripture that
[1:18:25] says because there was much water
[1:18:27] there uh so you can't you can't I mean
[1:18:30] if you sprinkle you just need a little
[1:18:31] water but if you're going to baptize you
[1:18:32] need much water there that is uh John
[1:18:35] 3:23
[1:18:37] yes and John also was baptizing in I'm
[1:18:40] not sure how to pronounce that a a aan
[1:18:44] near to Salem because there was much
[1:18:47] water there and they came and were
[1:18:48] baptized also if you have access to a
[1:18:51] Greek Lexicon or strong concordance
[1:18:53] if you if you look up the word baptize
[1:18:55] it means so fully immersed in water my
[1:18:58] Jewish Bible says the same thing they
[1:19:00] always when they say baptism it's
[1:19:01] immersion it's immersion yes sir and
[1:19:03] that's the word yes wonderful and then
[1:19:06] the Bible says in Romans we're buried
[1:19:08] with him into baptism
[1:19:12] buried that's a good topic for all you
[1:19:15] Saints good um it says it actually two
[1:19:17] places Romans 6:4 and Colossians 2:12 we
[1:19:20] don't have to read them I can read them
[1:19:21] wherefore we are buried with him by
[1:19:23] baptism into death okay buried with him
[1:19:26] Colossians 2:12 buried with him in
[1:19:29] baptism so Buried buried is not
[1:19:31] sprinkling in fact sprinkling is only
[1:19:33] used one time in the New
[1:19:34] Testament uh think it also goes on to
[1:19:37] say one of those places to rise with him
[1:19:39] again yes that's right risen yes sir now
[1:19:43] you bued with him Rising absolutely
[1:19:46] that's right brother beautiful
[1:19:48] beautiful it's exactly right the word
[1:19:51] sprinkling is only used uh well let's
[1:19:53] see 1 2 3 4 5 seven times in the New
[1:19:57] Testament six of them refer to Moses
[1:19:59] sprinkling the blood in Hebrews but the
[1:20:01] only one that doesn't is 1 Peter 1:2 it
[1:20:04] says elect according to the for
[1:20:05] knowledge of God the Father through
[1:20:07] sanctification of the spirit unto the
[1:20:09] sprinkling I'm sorry unto The Obedience
[1:20:11] and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus
[1:20:13] Christ so it's a spiritual sprinkling in
[1:20:15] other words it's an anointing when you
[1:20:17] repent of your sins it's like God has
[1:20:18] sprinkled you he's anointed you but the
[1:20:20] Bible said he wants to baptize you amen
[1:20:23] hallelujah praise God Amen so sprinkling
[1:20:25] is that that first anointing you get oh
[1:20:26] Lord forgive me of my sins I need to
[1:20:28] obey your I need to obey your commands
[1:20:30] but eventually he wants to baptize your
[1:20:31] soul he wants to fill your soul with the
[1:20:33] Holy Ghost praise God so it all the way
[1:20:36] up yes Hallelujah absolutely beautiful
[1:20:41] now have you guys heard the the
[1:20:42] difference between father son Holy Ghost
[1:20:44] and Lord Jesus Christ have you heard
[1:20:47] that I have not I have not discussed
[1:20:49] that a lot yet okay great wonderful
[1:20:51] let's need a little teaching that yeah
[1:20:53] let's do some teaching on that and I
[1:20:54] have I have I have videos on YouTube
[1:20:56] about all these
[1:20:57] topics so I and it's all scripture I put
[1:21:00] some sometimes I put brother brandom in
[1:21:02] there and then there's are there are
[1:21:03] videos where I just address questions
[1:21:04] about brother brandom but I try to stay
[1:21:07] mostly on the scripture so people can
[1:21:08] just find it Bible Bible Bible Bible and
[1:21:10] you have your personal uh your personal
[1:21:13] link that we can get to all your videos
[1:21:16] yes yeah I have a personal Channel and
[1:21:17] then I have a church channel so I I put
[1:21:19] all my teachings on my personal Channel
[1:21:21] I just put all the sermons from our
[1:21:22] church on the the Church Channel yeah
[1:21:25] great brother great and that's why I
[1:21:26] started this I started the YouTube
[1:21:27] channel back in 2013 so 10 years ago
[1:21:29] yeah so I've been on YouTube 10 years
[1:21:32] just trying to share the message this
[1:21:33] Bible truth that God gave to brother
[1:21:35] brandom for us thank you yeah thank you
[1:21:38] thank you okay uh where did I
[1:21:40] say oh yeah Matthew Matthew 28:
[1:21:46] [Music]
[1:21:50] 19 Matthew 28 8
[1:21:53] [Music]
[1:21:55] 19 now this is one of the most
[1:21:58] misunderstood scriptures in the whole
[1:22:01] Bible because trinitarians will take
[1:22:04] this verse and say see God is three
[1:22:05] persons but that's not what the Bible
[1:22:08] said the Bible never said he's three
[1:22:10] persons thank
[1:22:13] you God is never called three persons in
[1:22:16] the entire Bible now is it mysterious
[1:22:18] yes the godhead is a mystery but God
[1:22:20] never says I'm three different persons
[1:22:23] yes God never says that so we are not
[1:22:26] trinitarians the Trinity wasn't even
[1:22:28] developed until 200 years after John
[1:22:31] died the TR the word Trinity wasn't even
[1:22:34] made up until 200 years after this book
[1:22:36] was
[1:22:36] finished amen so other words the Bible
[1:22:39] writers never wrote about Trinity
[1:22:42] Amen in there it's a it's an addition to
[1:22:45] the word of God it's adding something
[1:22:46] and remember the Bible said the Bible
[1:22:48] Ends by saying don't add one word and
[1:22:50] don't take one one away like the ends
[1:22:53] with that in revelation 22 18- 19 and
[1:22:56] then 200 years later these guys are like
[1:22:57] well let's call them three persons God
[1:22:59] never said these three persons would it
[1:23:01] make sense to say that once they tried
[1:23:04] to explain God from a carnal way of
[1:23:06] thinking is when they did that yes ining
[1:23:09] him by yes sir beautiful brother yes
[1:23:13] absolutely and brother I looked it up in
[1:23:15] history the whole at first they only had
[1:23:18] the father and son they were first they
[1:23:20] only had two persons I looked up in
[1:23:21] history it wasn't until like uh 361 that
[1:23:24] they finally made the the Holy Spirit a
[1:23:26] third person they were so carnal they
[1:23:28] didn't even know the Holy Spirit was God
[1:23:30] how could the Holy Spirit not be God who
[1:23:33] else could he be but God there's only
[1:23:35] one God and God's holy and God's a
[1:23:38] spirit so if you just study the history
[1:23:40] of it it's all man's ideas injected into
[1:23:43] the word of God and the Jesus said if
[1:23:45] you add to this word he said the plagues
[1:23:48] will be added to you uh in torment amen
[1:23:51] so I'm not going to add anything I
[1:23:53] believe everything the Bible says about
[1:23:54] God but I will not add to the Bible I
[1:23:57] will not say God's three
[1:23:59] persons because that's that's going to
[1:24:01] carry a lot of repercussions in this
[1:24:03] world or in the world to come amen okay
[1:24:06] so Matthew
[1:24:07] 28:19 be it's a beautiful scripture if
[1:24:09] you just understand it it's it's a
[1:24:11] beautiful
[1:24:13] scripture Matthew
[1:24:16] 28:19 go ye therefore and teach All
[1:24:19] Nations baptizing them in the name of
[1:24:20] the father and of the son and of the
[1:24:23] Holy Ghost teaching them to observe all
[1:24:25] things whatsoever I commanded you and lo
[1:24:27] I'm with you all way even until the end
[1:24:29] of the world Amen now look at the verse
[1:24:33] how many names are there there's one
[1:24:34] name he don't he didn't say go baptize
[1:24:37] them in the names he said go baptize
[1:24:39] them in the name amen there's one name
[1:24:42] of the Father the same name for the Son
[1:24:44] and the same name for the Holy
[1:24:47] Ghost God in other words God is saying I
[1:24:50] have three manifestations that's that's
[1:24:51] the word of King Jam James uses God
[1:24:54] manifests himself in the flesh manifest
[1:24:56] means to appear in other words God's
[1:24:58] going to appear in the flesh and then
[1:24:59] he's going to appear as the Holy Spirit
[1:25:00] but it's the same God the whole
[1:25:03] time so there's one name to the father
[1:25:06] son Holy Ghost now Jesus spoke this and
[1:25:08] shortly after that he floated up to
[1:25:10] heaven right 10 days later he come back
[1:25:14] down but he come down as fire amen
[1:25:16] hallelujah praise God he didn't come in
[1:25:17] a body he came as a pillar of fire amen
[1:25:21] he came as a rushy mighty wi Hallelujah
[1:25:23] and he filled the place where they were
[1:25:24] sitting praise God and then that man
[1:25:27] Peter got filled with the Holy Ghost in
[1:25:29] his soul like we're talking
[1:25:30] about and then he commands them 10 days
[1:25:33] later to be baptized in the name of
[1:25:35] Jesus
[1:25:36] Christ okay so let's go to acts
[1:25:39] 238 this is the first verse I memorize
[1:25:41] when I come in the message so if
[1:25:43] somebody asked me what's your favorite
[1:25:44] verse in the Bible I say acts 238 now
[1:25:46] it's hard to turn down John 3:16 but it
[1:25:49] doesn't doesn't really matter as long as
[1:25:51] the Bible's your favorite book that's
[1:25:52] what what matters but this verse is
[1:25:54] special to me because this is the first
[1:25:56] verse that I memorize once I come in the
[1:25:59] message acts
[1:26:03] 238 brother Levi you want to read that
[1:26:05] for us brother then Peter said unto them
[1:26:08] repent and be baptized every one of you
[1:26:11] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[1:26:13] remission of
[1:26:14] sins and ye shall receive the gift of
[1:26:17] the Holy Ghost amen hallelujah I'd like
[1:26:20] to read the next verse too go ahead yes
[1:26:22] br yeah go ahead for the promise is unto
[1:26:24] you yes and to your children and to all
[1:26:28] that are AAR off even as many as the
[1:26:30] Lord Our God shall call amen hallelujah
[1:26:35] now we're going to see this later in the
[1:26:37] scripture but if you get baptized in the
[1:26:40] right name and repent of your sins God
[1:26:42] is obligated and he will fill your soul
[1:26:45] with the Holy Ghost because that's what
[1:26:46] it's promised to This Promise repent be
[1:26:50] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ you
[1:26:51] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:26:53] it's a promise hallelujah it's a
[1:26:56] beautiful promise now that's what the
[1:26:58] churches today have done the churches
[1:26:59] today the I'm talking about the churches
[1:27:01] whove Fallen away from God they take the
[1:27:03] name of Jesus out of everything now it's
[1:27:05] just Father Son and Holy Ghost or it's
[1:27:06] mother Mary or they take the name of
[1:27:09] Jesus out of it but jesus' name was
[1:27:11] meant to be in it praise
[1:27:13] God okay so that's the F now I don't
[1:27:16] know if you know this but there's five
[1:27:17] times people are baptized in the book of
[1:27:19] Acts and every time they use the name of
[1:27:21] the Lord the Lord Jesus or Jesus Christ
[1:27:23] amen they never use Father Son and Holy
[1:27:25] Ghost in the book of Acts because Jesus
[1:27:27] was revealing a mystery that mystery was
[1:27:30] the
[1:27:31] godhead that there's one God who
[1:27:33] manifests himself as father son Holy
[1:27:35] Ghost it's one God manifesting himself
[1:27:38] to redeem mankind amen that's right
[1:27:40] church that's right amen that's exactly
[1:27:42] the
[1:27:43] scripture okay uh so let's go to Acts
[1:27:46] chapter 8 you'll see it again they have
[1:27:47] this
[1:27:48] revival in uh Samaria you're probably
[1:27:51] familiar with it one of the sorcerers
[1:27:53] Simon gets he almost gets converted we
[1:27:55] don't know what actually happened to him
[1:27:57] but he sees them casting out Devils
[1:27:59] doing miracles in Samaria he gets
[1:28:01] baptized and then go to verse
[1:28:04] 16 well actually let's read 15 and 16 so
[1:28:08] they have this revival devils are being
[1:28:09] cast out people are being healed and
[1:28:11] they say these people and all these
[1:28:12] people get baptized but they're not
[1:28:14] getting the Holy Ghost yet so they call
[1:28:16] for Peter and John to come lay hands on
[1:28:18] them to receive the Holy
[1:28:20] Ghost praise God
[1:28:23] verse 15 who when they were come down
[1:28:27] prayed for them that they might receive
[1:28:28] the Holy Ghost for as yet he was Fallen
[1:28:31] upon none of them only they were
[1:28:33] baptized in the name of what can you say
[1:28:35] it out loud the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:28:38] not follow the Holy Ghost because that's
[1:28:39] not a
[1:28:41] name it's Lord Jesus Christ that's the
[1:28:43] name of
[1:28:45] God have you ever heard that
[1:28:48] illustration Father Son and Holy Ghost
[1:28:50] is just like I a father I'm a son I'm a
[1:28:53] teacher I'm a brother I'm a friend I'm
[1:28:55] an uncle I'm a lot of things so are
[1:28:58] you but that's not my name you can't
[1:29:02] cash a check if I can't cash my checks
[1:29:03] and say uh son of Ruby
[1:29:07] Smith they won't let you cash a check
[1:29:09] like that it's got to have your name on
[1:29:11] it praise God Amen you can't buy
[1:29:13] anything without the name and so it is
[1:29:15] today we can't get God's blessing
[1:29:17] without using the name praise God Amen
[1:29:19] that's why some people don't cast out
[1:29:20] Devils because they don't use the name
[1:29:21] of Jesus Jesus that's why some people
[1:29:23] don't get healed because they don't pray
[1:29:25] in the name of Jesus that's why some
[1:29:26] people don't get saved because they
[1:29:27] don't get baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:29:29] Christ amen it's the name above all
[1:29:31] names praise God
[1:29:33] am that's exactly right amen that's
[1:29:37] right and church let me just share my
[1:29:38] testimony I remember I was in those
[1:29:39] denominations for about uh about a year
[1:29:41] and a half I was in the almost two years
[1:29:43] because I got saved I heard the message
[1:29:44] at the very end of 2001 anyways I was in
[1:29:47] the denomination for almost two years
[1:29:48] and I could never get rid of my I chew
[1:29:50] tobacco I smoke cigarettes I still
[1:29:53] worship Sports I could never get rid of
[1:29:55] that because they were just giving me
[1:29:56] Father Son and Holy Ghost but as soon as
[1:29:58] I heard the Lord Jesus Christ baptism I
[1:30:01] stopped cussing that very day I cussed
[1:30:04] like a sailor for 20 21 years when I
[1:30:07] heard the Lord Jesus Christ baptism and
[1:30:08] I got baptized I never cussed again amen
[1:30:11] amen praise God I never smoked another
[1:30:14] cigarette I never chewed another uh tin
[1:30:16] of tobacco once the name of Jesus Christ
[1:30:19] was spoken over me amen hallelujah
[1:30:21] praise God amen
[1:30:24] amen see it's a revelation of that name
[1:30:27] when you receive the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:30:28] that's receiving God because the
[1:30:30] fullness of the godhead dwelt in Christ
[1:30:32] amen amen all that was God dwelt in
[1:30:35] Christ he said this is my son in whom
[1:30:37] I'm well please praise God
[1:30:41] Amen
[1:30:43] Hallelujah yeah so now you see Acts 2
[1:30:46] acts 8 now go turn a page to acts 10 or
[1:30:48] maybe two pages mine's two
[1:30:50] pages
[1:30:52] verse 44 acts
[1:30:55] 10:44 well that's when the Holy Ghost
[1:30:57] Falls um go to verse 48 so you know this
[1:31:00] Cornelius story right Peter gets a
[1:31:02] vision he goes to the Gentiles which
[1:31:05] were before unclean people but he
[1:31:07] preaches to them the Holy Ghost Falls
[1:31:09] right on them but they've never been
[1:31:10] baptized in water yes they're already
[1:31:13] filled with the Holy Ghost in their soul
[1:31:15] but they've never been baptized their
[1:31:16] bodies haven't been baptized in water so
[1:31:18] Peter commands them I command you to go
[1:31:20] be baptized in the name of the lordel
[1:31:23] verse 48 and he commanded them to be
[1:31:25] baptized in the name of the Lord then
[1:31:28] Terri they him I'm sorry then prayed
[1:31:30] they him to T certain days okay three
[1:31:33] examples so far they've been baptized in
[1:31:35] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ or
[1:31:37] Lord Jesus let's hit let's hit a fourth
[1:31:40] one Acts 19 verse
[1:31:45] 5 now this is actually a really great
[1:31:48] story uh Acts
[1:31:50] 19
[1:31:53] in Acts 19 Paul goes to Ephesus right in
[1:31:58] turkey and they believe in Jesus but he
[1:32:01] he ask them have you received the Holy
[1:32:03] Ghost since you believed in verse two
[1:32:05] have you rece they already believed in
[1:32:07] Jesus but they don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:32:08] yet so see it's a good thing if you
[1:32:11] believe in Jesus now keep believing
[1:32:12] until he FS your soul praise God
[1:32:16] hallelujah it's great to believe
[1:32:18] hallelujah amen thank God keep believing
[1:32:21] Saints Hallelujah keep believing he will
[1:32:24] fill you with the Holy Ghost praise God
[1:32:25] Amen you might have to wait I had to
[1:32:27] wait uh I wait almost 2 and a half three
[1:32:30] years before I got the Holy Ghost after
[1:32:31] I got after I got baptized the right way
[1:32:34] everybody T just takes different to to
[1:32:35] to to die and surrender it takes
[1:32:37] everybody different times to confess
[1:32:39] their sins and and really seek God and
[1:32:41] get cleaned out but God promised to fill
[1:32:43] you with the Holy Ghost if you get
[1:32:45] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:32:47] Christ he will fill you with the Holy
[1:32:48] Ghost amen he will because he said it
[1:32:54] now so they're already Believers and
[1:32:56] they had AOS he was a mighty preacher
[1:32:58] remember in Acts chapter 18 he taught by
[1:33:00] the scriptures Jesus was the Messiah he
[1:33:01] could convince anybody that Jesus was
[1:33:03] the Messiah just by the word of God but
[1:33:05] they didn't have the Holy Ghost yet in
[1:33:07] the
[1:33:08] soul okay so verse two have ye received
[1:33:11] he said to them have you received the
[1:33:12] Holy Ghost since you believed and they
[1:33:13] said to him we have not so much as heard
[1:33:15] whether there be any Holy Ghost I didn't
[1:33:17] even know there was a holy ghost baptism
[1:33:18] in the
[1:33:19] soul and he said to them unto what then
[1:33:22] were you baptized in verse three and
[1:33:23] they said to him unto John's baptism now
[1:33:25] John the Baptist baptized only for
[1:33:27] repentance he said who's sorry for your
[1:33:29] sins who deserves to go to hell who
[1:33:31] wants to be saved and the people would
[1:33:32] come forth and John would baptize are
[1:33:35] you a sinner yes confess your sins okay
[1:33:36] now you're forgiven he baptized him and
[1:33:39] that's all they had yet they knew Jesus
[1:33:41] was the Messiah but Paul comes and says
[1:33:43] there's a greater baptism there's the
[1:33:46] mystery of Christ in you the hope of
[1:33:47] glory amen amen glory there's a greater
[1:33:50] mystery amen there's more of the Holy
[1:33:52] Ghost for you they said we didn't even
[1:33:54] know there was a holy
[1:33:55] ghost so what'd he
[1:33:57] do verse four they said they've only
[1:34:00] been baptized for repentance they've
[1:34:01] only repented their sins they haven't
[1:34:03] been filled with the Holy Ghost verse
[1:34:05] four then said Paul John barely baptized
[1:34:07] with a baptism of repentance saying on
[1:34:09] the people that they should believe on
[1:34:11] him whom should come after him that is
[1:34:13] on Christ Jesus when they heard this
[1:34:15] they were baptized in what the father
[1:34:17] son holy ghost or Lord Jesus or Christ
[1:34:20] Jesus right righten the Lord Jesus he
[1:34:24] didn't baptize Father Son and Holy Ghost
[1:34:26] he baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:34:27] Jesus praise God so it's a mystery it's
[1:34:31] a mystery what is the one name of the
[1:34:33] father son Holy Ghost and this mystery
[1:34:35] is hidden from millions of Christians
[1:34:38] most Christians haven't received this
[1:34:39] Revelation but it's a revelation that
[1:34:42] there's one God and that God became
[1:34:44] incarnate in his son and that son has
[1:34:46] one name and that son is the Lord Jesus
[1:34:49] Christ amen
[1:34:54] Hallelujah so I urge anyone today to
[1:34:56] pray about these things and and here's
[1:34:59] more of my testimony when I was 16 I got
[1:35:01] baptized just out of sympathy in the in
[1:35:03] the Pentecostal church I just I kind of
[1:35:05] got tired of the youth Minister telling
[1:35:06] me to get baptized I'm like you know my
[1:35:08] God he my mama cancer I might as well be
[1:35:10] baptized so I got baptized from the Holy
[1:35:12] Ghost but it didn't change anything I
[1:35:14] went right out to the car later on I'd
[1:35:16] smoke a cigarette or later on I would
[1:35:18] and I even played Sports too and I'd
[1:35:19] still smoke cigarettes it was ridiculous
[1:35:21] I listen the Dirty music the rock and
[1:35:22] roll music but when I heard this message
[1:35:24] it changed
[1:35:25] everything because I saw the power in
[1:35:28] the name of Jesus Amen Hallelujah in
[1:35:31] this in the book of Acts demons are cast
[1:35:33] out in the name of Jesus Amen people are
[1:35:36] sick people are healed in the name of
[1:35:37] Jesus Christen never does anyone ever
[1:35:40] use fathers and Holy Ghost to do any
[1:35:42] Miracle to to baptize anyone it's never
[1:35:45] father son Holy Ghost it's always the
[1:35:47] Lord Jesus Christ because that's the
[1:35:49] name above all names
[1:35:52] all right so I encourage anybody if you
[1:35:54] haven't repent of your sins and find a
[1:35:57] river or lake or some Pond or pool and
[1:36:00] confess your sins and call upon the name
[1:36:02] of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen
[1:36:06] hallelujah because that is the name
[1:36:07] given among men whereby we must be saved
[1:36:09] in Acts
[1:36:11] 4:12 that's the name we must be saved
[1:36:13] under
[1:36:15] Hallelujah all right now it's past
[1:36:19] 11:30 so let's see maybe we'll just hit
[1:36:21] a few more scriptures here you're such a
[1:36:23] very patient loving peoplee do
[1:36:25] Hallelujah we'll just hit a couple more
[1:36:27] here by God's grace
[1:36:29] um well let me uh let let me just hit a
[1:36:32] couple more okay yeah let me share some
[1:36:34] scripture about brother brand and then
[1:36:35] I'll share some about my life and then
[1:36:36] we'll finish here so uh scripture about
[1:36:38] brother brandom
[1:36:41] um so many I could use um let's go to
[1:36:45] Luke 17 Luke
[1:36:46] 17:30 I think this is maybe it's one of
[1:36:49] the easiest for people to see
[1:36:57] now to understand Luke 17:30 you got to
[1:36:59] look up at verse 26 as well you're
[1:37:01] probably familiar with this this is a
[1:37:03] beautiful Prophecy from Jesus you know
[1:37:06] this you know this transgender stuff
[1:37:08] going on now so wicked so sad this was
[1:37:12] already prophesied by Jesus 2,000 years
[1:37:14] ago homosexuality all this it was all
[1:37:17] prophesied by Jesus right here in Luke
[1:37:20] 17:26
[1:37:23] and as it was in the days of Noah so
[1:37:25] shall it be in the days of the of the
[1:37:26] son of man they did eat they drank they
[1:37:28] married wives they were given in
[1:37:30] marriage until the day that Noah entered
[1:37:31] in the ark and the flood came and
[1:37:33] destroyed them all now let's pause right
[1:37:35] there what was happening in Noah's day
[1:37:36] violence was in the earth sons of God
[1:37:39] were marrying uh beautiful sexy sinner
[1:37:42] women that's what Genesis 6
[1:37:45] says the imagination of their hearts
[1:37:48] were only evil
[1:37:49] continually so whatever conditions were
[1:37:51] in MO or Noah's day it's got to be today
[1:37:53] too the days of the coming of the son of
[1:37:55] man
[1:37:58] Jesus and also they're eating drinking
[1:38:00] they're acting like nothing's going to
[1:38:01] happen they're just living their lives
[1:38:02] they forget all about Jesus verse 28
[1:38:05] likewise also as it was in days of lot
[1:38:07] they did eat they drank they bought they
[1:38:09] sold they planted they builded but the
[1:38:12] same day that lot went out of Sodom it
[1:38:13] rained fire and brimstone from heaven
[1:38:15] and destroyed them
[1:38:16] all now look at verse 30 and th even
[1:38:19] thus shall it be in the day when the son
[1:38:21] of man is
[1:38:23] revealed so in whatever day the son of
[1:38:26] man which is Jesus in the prophet form
[1:38:29] right son of man is a prophet in flesh
[1:38:32] whatever day Jesus the son of man is
[1:38:34] going to come we're going to see days of
[1:38:35] Noah and days of Sodom Sodom was male
[1:38:39] homosexuals that's what Sodom was right
[1:38:41] it was overrun with male
[1:38:43] homosexuals right and so Jesus said all
[1:38:47] this is going to repeat at the end time
[1:38:49] all this violence all this sexual
[1:38:50] wickedness it's all going to repeat and
[1:38:52] in that day the son of man is going to
[1:38:54] be revealed now that son of man means a
[1:38:58] prophet Jesus's Ministry in brother
[1:39:01] brandom now I know it might be hard to
[1:39:03] swallow or maybe understand but I
[1:39:06] believe with all my heart that's the
[1:39:08] truth amen I met two people that knew
[1:39:10] brother Brandon the first one she passed
[1:39:13] away uh 13 years ago 201 Florence Humes
[1:39:17] she's on tape she was dying of
[1:39:19] tuberculosis she went up in the prayer
[1:39:20] line brother Bram she never met brother
[1:39:23] BR you stood there brother Bram caught a
[1:39:26] vision and said I see you're dying
[1:39:28] you're losing your weight you're dying
[1:39:29] of
[1:39:31] tuberculosis brother bam said I've seen
[1:39:32] a vision he said I condemn Satan in the
[1:39:35] name of Jesus Christ he said go weigh
[1:39:37] yourself next Monday and the Monday
[1:39:39] after you'll gain a pound each week now
[1:39:42] usually with tuberculosis you wither
[1:39:44] away and sister Florence went and did
[1:39:46] that she believed brother brandom she
[1:39:48] went and weighed herself she gained one
[1:39:50] pound the next Monday and the Monday
[1:39:53] after that she gained a second pound she
[1:39:55] went on to have four more children so
[1:39:57] she had a total of six children
[1:40:01] Hallelujah and uh and she recovered from
[1:40:04] tuberculosis because God showed brother
[1:40:06] brand a vision and gave her gave her the
[1:40:08] power in the name of Jesus
[1:40:10] Christ and it's on tape you can you can
[1:40:13] hear the tape I think it's 1955 or 1958
[1:40:16] and I met her the other man was Tom
[1:40:18] Brown his name's on tape too he met
[1:40:19] brother Brandon he had questions about
[1:40:21] serpen SE that I preached on earlier you
[1:40:23] know uh Proverbs 30:20 he had all these
[1:40:26] questions and he got an interview with
[1:40:28] brother brandham and he sat down with
[1:40:30] brother brandham and brother Bram they
[1:40:32] said hi brother Bram slid a paper across
[1:40:34] the table and brother Tom said oh thank
[1:40:37] you he open up the paper on the paper
[1:40:39] were all of his questions and all of his
[1:40:42] answers before he even asked a
[1:40:46] question Hallelujah
[1:40:49] yes ask gifted
[1:40:52] Visions amen now in 1965 brother Bram
[1:40:56] had a vision of the American churches
[1:40:59] listen dancing to rock and
[1:41:02] roll in my mom was alive my mom was born
[1:41:05] in 1950 my mom I asked my mom I said mom
[1:41:08] was any church dancing to rock and roll
[1:41:10] in the' 60s she's like no all the church
[1:41:12] she was Assembly of God we were against
[1:41:14] rock and roll no church was for rock and
[1:41:16] roll now you go to any mega church today
[1:41:19] what are they doing today
[1:41:21] they're dancing to rock and roll
[1:41:24] amen they either have rock and roll
[1:41:27] bands now I believe in dancing in the
[1:41:28] spirit I dance around our church I
[1:41:30] praise the Lord like David I I dance
[1:41:32] like I I dance around the church I
[1:41:33] praise God but they were dancing to
[1:41:36] Filthy rock and roll yes and brother Ram
[1:41:39] saw it and I told my mom I said my mom
[1:41:41] doesn't believe in brother brandom but I
[1:41:42] said Mom you have witnessed brother
[1:41:44] bram's Vision
[1:41:47] yes right because now every mega church
[1:41:50] how do they get people people in how do
[1:41:51] they get the world in they got to bring
[1:41:52] their music in rock and
[1:41:54] roll those guitar s those and drums they
[1:41:57] just bang on the drums that's that's
[1:42:00] confusion I mean gentle drums okay Clapp
[1:42:02] and tambourine I love that I love but
[1:42:05] not like a confusion head banging and
[1:42:08] stuff so they're trying to lose their
[1:42:10] heads or something like that it's
[1:42:11] nonsense brother random saw that in 1965
[1:42:15] look it it's he said it's thus sayith
[1:42:17] the Lord and it's come to pass amen
[1:42:20] hallelujah
[1:42:23] the man saw Visions he he he from God
[1:42:26] but Church the most important thing like
[1:42:27] I hope you know today the most important
[1:42:29] thing is that he pointed us to this
[1:42:30] Bible amen that's right he would He
[1:42:35] restored our hearts back to the
[1:42:37] apostolic fathers and that's Malachi 45
[1:42:39] and 6 let's read
[1:42:40] that that's what brother Brown's
[1:42:42] ministry that's why it means so much to
[1:42:44] me brother sge brother Levi all these
[1:42:47] brothers brother
[1:42:48] John Malachi 45 and
[1:42:53] 6 now this is a compound prophecy this
[1:42:56] is a prophecy of both John the Baptist
[1:42:58] and we believe brother
[1:43:00] brandom verse 5 behold I will send you
[1:43:03] Elijah the prophet before the coming of
[1:43:05] the great and Dreadful day of the Lord
[1:43:07] and he shall turn the heart of the
[1:43:08] fathers to the children I'll stop right
[1:43:10] there that was John the Baptist and that
[1:43:12] is in Luke 1:17 the Bible literally says
[1:43:16] that John the Baptist fulfilled this
[1:43:18] first part he turned the heart of the
[1:43:21] fathers of the faith the fathers of the
[1:43:23] New Testament to the children in other
[1:43:24] words the endday Believers right because
[1:43:27] they were all Paul and Peter they were
[1:43:29] all hoping Jesus would come back in
[1:43:31] their lifetime their hearts were turned
[1:43:33] to the end to the generation that would
[1:43:35] see Jesus but the spirit of Elijah has
[1:43:38] to come back though and it has to come
[1:43:40] back and and he's going to turn the
[1:43:41] heart of the children the end day father
[1:43:44] the I'm the endday Believers back to the
[1:43:48] fathers see the the fathers of the faith
[1:43:50] long for the children the you know the
[1:43:52] day when Jesus would come but now we're
[1:43:54] the children and we're longing for the

[1:48:52] she said brother Jesse I just want to
[1:48:54] tell you when I went back to my seat I
[1:48:56] kept praising God and in that moment I
[1:48:58] felt fire where my kidney stone was and

[1:49:12] she had a blood issue she was bleeding
[1:49:14] she couldn't stop the
[1:49:17] bleeding and I preach a message that
[1:49:19] brother Rand preached called the five
[1:49:20] identifications of a true church in
[1:49:22] other words the church has to have the
[1:49:23] right message the power of God the holy
[1:49:25] lives all these
[1:49:27] things and she come up for
[1:49:29] prayer and she said I'm bleeding so I
[1:49:32] said well I know somebody who can heal
[1:49:34] that Jesus healed that all the time in
[1:49:35] the Bible am whether it was 12 years or
[1:49:38] 18 years Jesus can heal that praise
[1:49:40] Goden so he prayed the prayer of faith

[1:49:43] the blood dry
[1:49:45] up and she and her husband calls me the
[1:49:47] next day and said we have been praying

[1:50:45] believe God could do it my faith was
[1:50:48] lacking on that one
[1:50:50] oh and he came to your church last year
[1:50:52] remember at the Easter
[1:50:54] celebration that's

[1:51:14] power of
[1:51:15] God and you come up for prayer most of
[1:51:18] the church was out with Co

[1:51:23] I for some reason I laid my hands on his
[1:51:25] on his rib cage right there I don't know
[1:51:26] it just one of those moments it's hard
[1:51:27] to explain I just prayed for him and he
[1:51:29] said he felt the fire of God burn up and
[1:51:31] down in his chest run through all of his
[1:51:34] chest and he said the next day he went
[1:51:36] to see his mom and they always argued he
[1:51:38] said he went to his mom's house it's the
[1:51:40] first time in his life he never argued
[1:51:41] with his mom praise God the demon of a
[1:51:44] temper the demon of bitterness left in
[1:51:47] that moment the Holy Fire of God burned
[1:51:50] out of him praise God Amen praise God
[1:51:52] and now today he's seeking the he's not
[1:51:54] born again but he's seeking the baptism
[1:51:55] of the Holy Ghost God's clean up his
[1:51:57] life I'll just tell his testimony a
[1:52:00] month later I was trying to get him some

[1:52:57] the UK heard that we had a financial
[1:52:59] need and he said I just feel led to send

[1:53:20] you're the disciple Jesus loved and I
[1:53:23] said look look here I got proof that
[1:53:24] Jesus loves you and I put a screenshot
[1:53:27] of that

[1:59:18] any sin
[1:59:20] the Bible says confess your faults one
[1:59:22] to
[1:59:23] another and pray for one another that
[1:59:25] you may be
[1:59:27] healed sometimes God withholds healing
[1:59:29] because we haven't confessed our
[1:59:32] sins
[1:59:36] Hallelujah and let's all have a just a
[1:59:38] reverent how how many believe Jesus can
[1:59:40] meet these needs today I know he can too
[1:59:43] I know we can look at those
[1:59:45] hands thank you friends for watching
[1:59:48] this video hope it was a blessing to you
[1:59:50] and I hope it strengthened your faith in
[1:59:52] the Lord Jesus Christ and His Holy Bible

[1:59:56] have two books available on Amazon I'm
[1:59:59] not a book salesman but in times like
[2:00:01] this when the message of the hour is
[2:00:02] being attacked with so many lies

[2:00:09] strength to your faith the first is 2018
