[0:02] trinitarianism is of the devil I say
[0:05] that thus sayith the Lord amen Daniel
[0:09] saw him many hundred years 700 years and
[0:11] said he was the Ancient of Days one like
[0:14] the son of man come in power and United
[0:17] with this Ancient of Days and the
[0:19] Judgment was
[0:21] set greetings friends in the mattress
[0:23] name of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[0:25] purpose of this video is to answer a
[0:27] viewer's question about Daniel 7 9
[0:30] through 14 a viewer asked if these
[0:33] verses prove the Trinity and of course
[0:36] my answer is no Daniel 7 does not prove
[0:39] the Trinity Dogma it's a man-made Creed
[0:41] it's man-made heresy it's an addition to
[0:43] the word of God so I'd like to give a
[0:45] bible-based answer based upon the Bible
[0:47] revelations that Jesus Christ revealed
[0:49] to his Prophet The Late William Aon
[0:51] brandham who lived from 1909 to 1965
[0:54] this video defends the revelation of the
[0:57] godhead that Jesus revealed to brother
[0:59] brandham and then spoke with thus sayith
[1:00] the Lord Brother Bram said thus sayith
[1:02] the Lord trinitarianism is of the devil
[1:04] and it is because it's in addition to
[1:06] the word of God let's listen to the
[1:08] quote trinitarianism is of the
[1:11] devil I say that thus sayeth the Lord
[1:16] amen look where it come
[1:19] from it come from the N seeeing
[1:23] Council when the Catholic Church become
[1:25] in
[1:26] rulership the word Trinity is not even
[1:29] mentioned in the enre book of the
[1:32] Bible and as far as three Gods that's
[1:36] from Hell there's one
[1:40] God it's exactly right now do you say
[1:44] then you believe it all these people
[1:46] that as trinitarians are of hell no sir
[1:49] I believe they are
[1:50] Christians but the hour is approaching
[1:53] brother where they are sincerely wrong
[1:58] starting in Daniel 7
[2:00] 9-14 verses 9 and 10 speak of the
[2:03] Ancient of Days verse 11 speaks of the
[2:06] horn verse 12 speaks of the other beasts
[2:09] and then verses 13 and 14 again speak of
[2:11] the Ancient of Days and then one like
[2:13] unto the son of man comes to the Ancient
[2:15] of Days so trinitarians picture in their
[2:18] own minds that there are two persons
[2:20] they say the son of man is the second
[2:22] person of the Trinity coming to the
[2:24] first person of the Trinity the father
[2:27] of course this is a lie this is false
[2:28] teaching the fact fact is the father is
[2:31] invisible the father has never been seen
[2:34] and never will be seen there's numerous
[2:36] verses about this in the Bible if you
[2:38] begin in John 1: 18 it says no man hath
[2:41] seen God at any time so it's clear no
[2:44] man has ever seen the invisible God
[2:46] Colossians 1:15 says Jesus is the image
[2:49] of the invisible God and then 1 Timothy
[2:52] 6:16 says God dwells in the light whom
[2:55] no man hath seen nor can see so no one
[2:58] will ever see father God the heavenly
[3:01] father God the Father God the father is
[3:04] invisible so the Ancient of Days already
[3:06] cannot be a visible Heavenly Father the
[3:09] Ancient of Days is actually a visible
[3:12] image of the father but it's the logos
[3:14] of God or the theophany of God we could
[3:17] also say it's the logos of the Son of
[3:20] God because God's invisible out of God
[3:23] came forth a light that was the logos in
[3:25] the beginning that fulfills Genesis
[3:28] where God said let there be light before
[3:30] the Sun and the Moon came into
[3:32] existence so this Ancient of Days is the
[3:34] logos of God it came out of God
[3:37] therefore it's a creation it's a Son of
[3:39] God it's the visible image of God in the
[3:42] spiritual theophany form this logos is
[3:45] also spoken of in Proverbs 822 through
[3:48] 31 the Bible said the Lord possessed me
[3:51] in the beginning of his way before his
[3:52] works of old speaking of the wisdom of
[3:54] God or the logos of God God the father
[3:57] created the visible logos and God the
[3:59] father spirit dwelt inside the visible
[4:04] logos Proverbs 8:30 said then I was by
[4:06] him as one brought up with him and I was
[4:08] daily his Delight rejoicing always
[4:10] before him so it's not teaching two
[4:12] persons it's teaching the manifestation
[4:15] of one person the invisible becoming
[4:18] visible father invisible son visible so
[4:22] in Daniel 79 and 10 Thrones were cast
[4:25] down and this Greek word means placed
[4:27] down so the Thrones are getting placed
[4:30] in their position in preparation for the
[4:32] great white Throne judgment then we see
[4:34] the Ancient of Days sitting His Garment
[4:36] white as snow hair on his head like pure
[4:39] wool his throne was like the fiery flame
[4:42] and his wheels is burning fire verse 10
[4:44] a fiery stream issued and came forth
[4:46] from before him thousand thousands
[4:48] ministered unto him and 10,000 times 10
[4:50] thousands stood before him the Judgment
[4:52] was set and the books were open so we
[4:55] believe these thousand thousands
[4:56] ministering under him were the bride
[4:59] that would eventually sit on those
[5:00] judgment seats as Jesus Promised in
[5:03] Revelation 3: 21 to him that overcometh
[5:06] will I grant to sit with me in my throne
[5:09] even as I also overcame and have set
[5:11] down with my father in his throne it was
[5:13] also promised in Revelation 20:4 I saw
[5:16] Thrones and they sat upon them and
[5:18] judgment was given unto them so the same
[5:21] event in Revelation 20 the white Throne
[5:23] judgment is spoken of in Daniel chapter
[5:25] 7 judgment is given unto the bride the
[5:28] Church of course they're going to be
[5:30] judging by the spirit of Christ as 1
[5:32] Corinthians chapter 6 says do you not
[5:34] know that the Saints shall judge the
[5:36] world and if the world shall be judged
[5:38] by you are you unworthy to judge the
[5:40] smallest matters 1 Corinthians 62 and3
[5:42] know ye not that we shall judge Angels
[5:45] how much more things that pertain to
[5:46] this life so we see the Ancient of Days
[5:49] in verses 9 and 10 that's the theophany
[5:52] of Jesus it's the theophany of the
[5:54] invisible father because the father can
[5:56] never be seen and then in verses 13 and
[5:58] 14 one un liken to the son of man comes
[6:01] to the Ancient of Days so this is the
[6:04] glorified body of Jesus coming to the
[6:07] theophany of God it is not a second
[6:09] person coming to the first person that
[6:11] would be polytheism that would be
[6:14] tritheism or three gods and remember
[6:17] friends the Holy Ghost in Acts chapter 2
[6:19] manifested as 120 different lights so we
[6:22] cannot count a different manifestation
[6:24] of God as a different person if that's
[6:27] the case then the Holy Ghost is 120
[6:29] different persons at least but we know
[6:32] God's not 120 persons God is one person
[6:36] so notice in Daniel 7:13 one like the
[6:38] son of man comes to the Ancient of Days
[6:41] so this glorified body of Jesus comes
[6:43] before the theophany of Jesus and this
[6:45] is for the great white Throne judgment
[6:47] Jesus talked about this in Matthew
[6:50] 2664 Jesus said unto them neveress I say
[6:54] unto you Hereafter shall you see the son
[6:55] of man sitting on the right hand of
[6:57] power and coming in the Clouds Of Heaven
[6:59] so the Pharisees and all those Sanhedrin
[7:01] that agreed for Jesus to be crucified
[7:03] Jesus told them you'll see me coming
[7:05] with the clouds of heaven and so this is
[7:07] what he was referring to Daniel 713- 14
[7:10] notice he comes on the Clouds Of Heaven
[7:13] and the Pharisees and everyone all the
[7:15] goats are standing there along with the
[7:16] Sheep the foolish virgin and they're
[7:18] going to be judged by Jesus Christ just
[7:20] as Paul said Jesus Will judge Everyone
[7:23] by his Gospel according to Romans 2:16
[7:26] then in verse 14 of Daniel 7 there was
[7:29] given him Dominion glory and a kingdom
[7:31] all people Nations languages should
[7:33] serve him his Dominion is an everlasting
[7:35] Dominion which shall not pass away in
[7:38] his kingdom that which shall not be
[7:39] destroyed this is speaking of the future
[7:41] home the New
[7:43] Jerusalem so notice friends we see God
[7:46] keeping his word god changes his form or
[7:48] God changes his manifestation just as
[7:50] Philippians 26 and 7 says he changes
[7:53] form that word form in the Greek means
[7:55] morphe morphe means the form by which a
[7:59] person or thing strikes the vision the
[8:01] external appearance even in heaven God
[8:03] can change his form Daniel 7 showed him
[8:06] like an Ancient of Days Ezekiel 1
[8:08] though:
[8:10] 26-28 doesn't describe him exactly the
[8:12] same Daniel 7 does but it does say he
[8:15] had the appearance of fire but it did
[8:18] say he had the appearance of a man in
[8:20] Ezekiel 1 126 in Ezekiel 127 he's
[8:24] glowing and has the appearance of fire
[8:26] from the appearance of his loins even
[8:28] upward and from the appearance of his
[8:29] loin even downward I saw as it were the
[8:31] appearance of fire and it had brightness
[8:34] round about then there was a radiant
[8:36] rainbow like glory in Ezekiel 1:28 as
[8:39] the appearance of the bow that is in the
[8:41] cloud in the day of rain so was the
[8:43] appearance of the brightness roundabout
[8:45] this was the appearance of the likeness
[8:46] of the glory of the Lord so this could
[8:49] be the same manifestation as Daniel 7
[8:53] versus 9 and 10 or it could be something
[8:55] slightly different and I say that
[8:57] because even in Revelation 5: six Jesus
[9:00] comes forth to take the book and break
[9:02] the Seven Seals and the Bible said he
[9:04] looks like a lamb that had been slain
[9:07] and he's got seven horns and seven eyes
[9:09] well that's a different manifestation
[9:11] than the glorified body of Jesus because
[9:13] it looks just like a man with a white
[9:15] robe and so forth so in Revelation 5:6
[9:19] did the glorified body change its form I
[9:21] don't know but it seems like it did it
[9:24] changed its form so John could see the
[9:26] lamb as it had been slain the cross was
[9:28] our victory by the grace of God Almighty
[9:31] through death Jesus conquered death as
[9:33] the Hebrews writer expressed so we
[9:35] rejoice in the Revelation that God is
[9:37] one person who changes his form or
[9:39] manifests himself in different ways as 1
[9:42] Timothy 3:16 Says great is the mystery
[9:45] of godliness God was manifest In the
[9:47] Flesh God can change his form from a
[9:49] pillar of fire to a rock in the
[9:51] wilderness to the body of MDC here to
[9:54] the Ancient of Days also to the
[9:56] glorified body of Jesus one likeing the
[9:58] son of man
[10:00] God is unlimited we cannot limit God's
[10:02] power to manifest himself in as many
[10:04] ways as he wants even at his baptism in
[10:07] Matthew chapter 3 you had the body of
[10:09] Jesus there in the water you had a voice
[10:12] from Heaven saying this is my beloved
[10:13] Son and you had the Holy Ghost ascending
[10:15] like a dove not three persons but three
[10:18] manifestations of the Holy One of Israel
[10:21] the creator of heavens and earth the
[10:23] unlimited Almighty omnipotent Lord Jesus
[10:26] Christ so before we close I want to play
[10:29] few quotes from God's Prophet brother
[10:30] brandham regarding Daniel chapter 7
[10:32] brother brandham said the son of man
[10:35] coming to the Ancient of Days was the
[10:37] son of man uniting with the Ancient of
[10:39] Days I love that wording there it's the
[10:41] manifestations uniting for the white
[10:43] Throne judgment he also said the son of
[10:45] man joined in with him the Ancient of
[10:47] Days so we see these manifestations
[10:49] coming together to unite into one
[10:51] manifestation as First Corinthians 15
[10:54] says that the Son of God when all
[10:56] enemies are under his feet will give the
[10:58] kingdom back over to the father
[11:00] mysterious yes no doubt but does it
[11:03] speak of tritheism or three persons no
[11:05] it does not it's one God manifesting
[11:08] himself both those quotes are from the
[11:11] Patmos Vision December 4th 1960 and then
[11:14] we'll listen to the church age book
[11:15] section where brother brandom lists
[11:17] Daniel 7
[11:19] 9-14 in Chapter 2 the Patos Vision let's
[11:22] listen to the quotes Daniel saw him many
[11:25] hundred years 700 years and said he was
[11:27] the Ancient of Days one like the the son
[11:29] of man come in power and United with
[11:32] this Ancient of Days and the Judgment
[11:34] was
[11:35] set Daniel saw him 700 years before that
[11:40] in the same position the same kind same
[11:43] man stand there the Ancient of Days and
[11:45] one like the son of man that joined in
[11:47] with him and all judgment was committed
[11:49] to him stand the white Throne judgment
[11:52] now he is coming the judge of all the
[11:54] Earth he will be crowned with wisdom
[11:56] that is what the white and glistening
[11:58] hair signifies
[11:59] see this in Daniel 7:
[12:02] 9-14 I beheld till the Thrones were cast
[12:05] down and the Ancient of Days did sit
[12:07] whose garment was white as snow and the
[12:09] hair of his head like the pure wool his
[12:12] throne was like the fiery flame and his
[12:14] wheels as burning fire a fiery stream
[12:17] issued and came forth from before him
[12:20] thousand thousands ministered unto him
[12:22] and 10,000 times 10,000 stood before him
[12:26] the Judgment was set and the books were
[12:28] opened
[12:29] I beheld then because of the voice of
[12:31] the great words which the horn spake I
[12:34] beheld even till the Beast was slain and
[12:36] his body destroyed and given to the
[12:38] Burning Flame as concerning the rest of
[12:41] the beasts they had their Dominion taken
[12:43] away yet their lives were prolonged for
[12:46] a season and time I saw in the night
[12:49] visions and behold one like the son of
[12:51] man came with the clouds of heaven and
[12:54] came to the Ancient of Days and they
[12:56] brought him near before him and there
[12:58] was given him dominion and glory and a
[13:00] kingdom that all people Nations and
[13:03] languages should serve him his Dominion
[13:06] is an everlasting Dominion which shall
[13:07] not pass away and his kingdom that which
[13:10] shall not be destroyed there it is
[13:13] Daniel saw him with that white hair he
[13:16] was the judge opening the books and
[13:18] judging out of them Daniel saw him
[13:20] coming in clouds that is exactly what
[13:23] John saw they both saw him exactly the
[13:26] same they saw the judge with his
[13:28] judgment girdle over his shoulders
[13:30] standing pure and holy full of wisdom
[13:33] fully qualified to judge the world in
[13:35] righteousness
[13:41] Hallelujah so let's begin with reviewing
[13:43] the nine proofs the Trinity is heresy or
[13:45] false
[13:46] Doctrine you'll find this on pages
[13:50] 23 through 32 in my 2021 book I'm going
[13:55] to go through these quickly first and
[13:57] the most decimating to its validity the
[14:00] Trinity Dogma adds to the Bible second
[14:03] Jesus and his Apostles taught and
[14:04] affirmed pure Hebrew monotheism rather
[14:07] than
[14:09] trinitarianism third the athanasian
[14:11] Creed or 6th Century trinitarian
[14:13] confessional contains multiple
[14:14] contradictions to Biblical teaching on
[14:17] the godhead I list six examples in the
[14:20] book one of which is the shield of the
[14:22] Trinity which contains a blatant lie
[14:25] where it says the father is not the Holy
[14:27] Spirit the father is a Spirit According
[14:29] To Jesus in John chter 4 and the Holy
[14:32] Spirit is a spirit as its name declares
[14:35] so if the holy spirit is not the father
[14:37] then Jesus had two fathers and of course
[14:40] we know that's
[14:41] wrong fourth major Bible contradictions
[14:43] and inconsistencies exist among
[14:47] trinitarians fifth the early
[14:48] trinitarians did not affirm that the
[14:50] Holy Spirit was divine into the Council
[14:52] of constan ople in 381 ad so think of
[14:55] that friends the Holy Ghost was not
[14:57] considered Divine in trinitarian Minds
[14:59] until 381 ad nearly 300 years after the
[15:04] final Apostle died St John here's a
[15:07] quick visual regarding water baptism and
[15:09] the godhead the true Apostolic baptism
[15:12] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ was
[15:14] administered by Peter around 30 or 33 ad
[15:18] Paul continued that of course up to 59
[15:20] ad as recorded in scripture in Acts
[15:23] 19:5 and then the enemy began to change
[15:26] baptism from the apostolic baptism to
[15:29] Modern baptism or the Liturgy baptism
[15:33] which is a false baptismal formula of
[15:35] father son holy ghost that was around
[15:37] 100 AD and then around 180 ad Theophilus
[15:41] coined the Greek word
[15:44] Trias shortly after that tertullian
[15:46] coins the Latin word Trinitas so both
[15:50] words mean Trinity then according to the
[15:52] world book from 2003 the so-called three
[15:55] persons were declared as one God at the
[15:58] Council of NAA in 325 ad and again
[16:01] that's not according to me that's
[16:03] according to the World Book 2003 page
[16:06] 447 under the word Trinity so with that
[16:10] visual it's just so simple to see water
[16:12] baptism was changed about 40 years after
[16:16] St Paul used it at Ephesus and then the
[16:19] godhead began being changed about 80
[16:22] years after St John died around 180 ad
[16:27] again proving the Bible off authors did
[16:29] not teach three persons the Bible
[16:32] authors never had the idea of three
[16:34] persons in their minds six trinitarian
[16:37] images and artwork are often deceptive
[16:39] creating false representations of the
[16:41] godhead seventh some trinitarians use
[16:44] two fear tactics to persuade others to
[16:46] believe in the Trinity one is heresy the
[16:49] other is hell and eighth and finally God
[16:52] sent a prophet named William brandham to
[16:53] warn Christians about the false Trinity
[16:56] Doctrine so I think I misspoke earlier
[16:58] in the video I think I said there was
[16:59] nine proofs so I'm sorry about that
[17:02] there's eight proofs friends hope this
[17:04] video was a blessing by the grace of God
[17:06] our God is so great the Lord Jesus
[17:08] Christ we cannot limit him and his
[17:10] manifestations and most importantly we
[17:12] never want to add to the word by calling
[17:14] him three persons when he never says
[17:16] that and we never want to take away from
[17:18] the word of God so we just need the
[17:20] wisdom of the Holy Ghost we need the
[17:21] patience of the Holy Ghost to wait upon
[17:23] the timing of God and then God will
[17:25] reveal his will and his truth to us in
[17:27] his time and season
[17:29] if you have any questions concerns or
[17:30] testimonies about this video please
[17:32] contact
[17:33] me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[17:36] the desire of your heart
