========================================
[Music] greetings friends in the matchless name of the lord jesus christ the purpose of this video is to take a first look at the cover concept of my upcoming book called the 12 new testament mysteries revealed wraps your wisdom for christ's bride hope this video creates some enthusiasm for this upcoming book in order to spread the bible-based message that jesus christ revealed to his prophet william branham this is my second book as i wrote restoring christian modesty god's perfect will for your outward appearance two years ago in 2019 please know my motivation for writing books is not to make money last time i checked i had not made any money on my first book as i have given out about as many copies as i've sold the objective has never been to make money the objective has been to give everyone a chance to hear the message that god revealed to his servant brother branham one policy of our ministry is to make all these resources free if a person cannot afford them just as brother branham held this same policy for his ministry now we don't have nothing to sell well i'll take that back the boys has the books and tapes and the pictures i think and so forth in the back of the building and there i buy those books brother gordon lindsay prints those books and i buy them for 40 cents less than i have to sell them then pay for them to be transferred you know what you make you don't make nothing you lose on them it's the message and the pictures i think they just about expenses to send them is about we don't want to make nothing we brought nothing into this world it's certain we take nothing out what we're trying to do i wouldn't even let those books be there or those things if i didn't think it would help you some way see and i've told the boys if i walk to the bookstand stand around watch a few minutes and see an old dad come up say how much is that book it's uh 50 cents and he'd reach down only got give it to him anyhow let it go see anyone and can't afford it and anything like that some poor person let him have it that's right it'll come some other way somewhere and so it always has and it always will if you just put god first that's all put god first so if you cannot afford these two books then our ministry will be happy to provide you with either a free copy or a free pdf copy also the free audio book will be available online on our website on my personal website www.pastorjessesmith.com and also on my youtube channel pastor jesse smith with that being said here's the picture of the cover concept this book is likely going to be divided into two volumes because right now it's about 840 pages so you can see the book one on the cover the tentative release date is still june 15 2021 but this could be adjusted so i'll keep you posted on the release date my inspiration for this book came from brother branham's sermon is this the sign of the answer preached on december 30th 1962 in this sermon brother branham taught the seventh angel of revelation 10 verse 7 was to finish all the mysteries of god and he was the same angel of the laodicean church age from revelation chapter 3 verse 14. in the sermon is this the sign of the answer brother branham quoted c.i scofield who taught in his commentary on matthew 13 that there were 11 new testament mysteries and brother branham said the seventh church age messenger would finish all the mysteries of god this inspired me to search the scripture and i read every time the bible used the word mystery in the new testament and i found there were actually 12 mysteries so one more than the 11 that scofield had originally written so this inspiration caused me to study these 12 mysteries taking them through the bible and brother branham's quotes and over the last 26 months i've written about 840 pages on this subject so this book will be divided into two volumes the first volume will contain the first six mysteries and the second volume will contain the last six mysteries here are the mysteries so book one will cover the mystery of the godhead from colossians two verse two that will be chapter one chapter two will be the mystery of israel's spiritual blindness from romans 11 verse 25. chapter 3 will be the mystery of the new testament church composed of both jew and gentile from ephesians 3 verses 1 through 11. chapter 4 will be the mystery of the new testament church as the bride of christ from ephesians 5 32. the fifth chapter will be the mystery of godliness restored to man from 1st timothy 3 verse 16. and chapter 6 will finish volume 1 or book 1 and it is on the mystery of christ in you according to colossians 1 verse 27. in book 2 or volume 2 chapter 7 is the mystery of the seven stars and seven golden candlesticks according to revelation 1 verse 20 chapter 8 will be the mystery of the kingdom of heaven according to matthew 13 verse 11 chapter 9 will be the mystery of babylon according to revelation 17 verse 5 chapter 10 will be the mystery of iniquity according to second thessalonians 2 verse 7 chapter 11 will be the mystery of god's will according to ephesians 1 verse 9 and chapter 12 will be the mystery of the rapture according to first corinthians 15 51. there will also be an introductory chapter at the beginning of volume one or book one called god's mysteries are for you i'll cover all the scriptures in the bible where it talks about god hiding the mysteries from the wise and prudent but then revealing them unto babes such as would learn and other scriptures that show god reveals his secrets to his friends the ones who love him and keep his commands book 2 or volume 2 ends with chapter 13 which is about elijah will restore all things in chapter 13 i detail all the scriptures about brother branham's ministry and how it was to finish the mysteries of god friends it's awesome to see that brother branham stated six of these revelations of the mysteries with thus saith the lord so we can be sure these are the mysteries that had to be finished as revelation 10 verse 7 says and then it's our duty to take these mysteries and their revelations around the world according to revelation 10 verses 8 through 11. in closing i hope this video encourages you to study brother branham's sermons and better understand the mysteries of god i also hope it excites you to possibly get a copy of these two books as i believe they'll be a great blessing to you your family and your home church again my motivation is not to make money but to spread the message that god gave to brother branham friends we can rejoice that the secret things of god belong to us and our children as deuteronomy 29 verse 29 says the secret things belong unto the lord our god but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children forever that we may do all the words of this law let us rejoice in god's kindness to reveal his truths to us and our children if you have any questions testimonies or comments about this video please contact me [Music] god bless you and may jesus christ be the desire of your heart
