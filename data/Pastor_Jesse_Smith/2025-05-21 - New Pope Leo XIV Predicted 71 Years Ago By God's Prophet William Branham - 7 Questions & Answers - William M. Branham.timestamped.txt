[0:03] I believe one of these glorious days
[0:06] when this United Confederation Church
[0:08] goes together and the new pope is
[0:10] brought out of the United States and put
[0:12] their accordion of prophecy.
[0:15] Greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:17] of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of
[0:19] this video is to answer about seven
[0:20] questions about the new pope from the
[0:22] United States, Pope Leo I 14th. He was
[0:26] chosen about two weeks ago on May 8th,
[0:28] 2025. and I apologize for the delay. Our
[0:31] family has received a new baby daughter,
[0:33] so we're thankful for that. So, let's
[0:35] look at this topic here. By the grace of
[0:37] God, now these seven questions come from
[0:40] a accuser of the message or someone who
[0:43] doesn't believe the Bible- based
[0:45] ministry that God gave to the prophet of
[0:47] God, brother William Mary Brandham. So,
[0:49] I'm going to try to answer these with as
[0:51] much grace and brotherly kindness as
[0:53] possible here by the grace of God. The
[0:55] first question is apparently not every
[0:57] prophecy needs to be a thus sayith the
[0:59] Lord. Right now the defenders of the
[1:02] message have decided to innovate.
[1:03] They're creating their own prophecies.
[1:06] So my answer is no. True message
[1:08] believers do not create their own
[1:10] prophecies. As I said in my previous
[1:12] video, I don't know if the 1954 quote
[1:15] about the new pope from the United
[1:17] States was a prophecy. And I still
[1:19] believe that because there was no thus
[1:22] say the Lord. I believe it was just a
[1:24] general prophecy. I believe brother Ram
[1:26] just saw the connection between the
[1:29] spirit of Rome coming out of the United
[1:31] States in Revelation 13 11-18 and
[1:34] brother Brandham recognized if the
[1:36] spirit of Rome was going to be in the
[1:37] United States then it would require a
[1:40] American pope that would influence the
[1:42] United States. And the main reason I say
[1:45] that is because I don't know if this
[1:47] pope, Pope Leo I 14th, will bring about
[1:49] the forming of the image of the beast as
[1:52] the 1954 quote shows. So let me read
[1:55] that quote again. You probably heard it
[1:57] many, many times over the last two weeks
[1:58] or 3 weeks. I believe one of these
[2:00] glorious days when this United
[2:02] Confederation of Church goes together
[2:05] and the new pope is brought out of the
[2:07] United States and put over there
[2:08] according to prophecy, then they'll form
[2:11] an image like unto the beast.
[2:14] So, brother makes it seem like the steps
[2:16] is the confederation comes together, the
[2:19] new pope is brought by the United States
[2:21] and then the image of the beast is
[2:23] formed. Now, it makes sense that the
[2:25] forming of this beast has taken years
[2:27] and years and years. As I even noted in
[2:29] a past video, I think 1966 was the first
[2:33] year the pope met with the World Council
[2:35] of Churches. It was right after brother
[2:36] Brandham passed off the scene or it
[2:38] might have been 1965, something like
[2:40] that. It was very striking to see that.
[2:42] So no, true believers are not creating
[2:44] their own prophecies. I personally don't
[2:46] believe this was a specific prophecy. I
[2:49] just believe it was a general prophecy.
[2:50] Brother Ram saw the prophecy and the
[2:52] connection with the United States being
[2:55] led by the spirit of Rome and therefore
[2:56] it would require a American pope. But I
[2:59] could be wrong. And so I also said then
[3:02] yes it's true not every prophecy has to
[3:04] be thus sayith the Lord because Paul in
[3:06] 2 Timothy 3:13 and Peter in 2 Peter 3:10
[3:10] wrote prophecies in the Bible that did
[3:12] not have the words thus sayith the Lord
[3:14] behind them but those prophecies were
[3:16] part of scripture. Brother Ram's words
[3:18] are not scripture as he said in the
[3:20] sermon the unveiling of God 1964 because
[3:24] we cannot add one word or take away one
[3:26] word from the canon of scripture the
[3:28] word of God. This is a beautiful quote.
[3:30] I'll just put it up here on the screen.
[3:32] Brother Ram said, "A man was trying to
[3:34] catch him and said, "You would be
[3:35] eligible to write a Bible yourself, your
[3:37] word, if God is manifested. You have all
[3:39] the
[3:40] qualifications." But brother Ram said,
[3:42] "No, sir. It would be adding something
[3:44] to it or taking something from it. See,
[3:46] it's all in the word. You can't get out
[3:49] of that word. It won't leave the word.
[3:50] And God's spirit will never leave that
[3:52] word. It'll stay right with the word."
[3:56] And then brother Ram told us the way to
[3:57] know he was prophesying was that he
[4:00] would say the words thus sayeth the Lord
[4:02] or in the name of the Lord. This is from
[4:05] He cares do you care
[4:07] 1963. Brother Ram said I've always asked
[4:10] you to be careful what you're listening
[4:12] to. There's so much of it that it's just
[4:14] the human side but always if there's
[4:16] something that goes forth it will speak
[4:18] it. So brother Ram says always it will
[4:20] speak it. It's thus sayith the Lord even
[4:22] divisions or anything.
[4:24] So that's what I understand friends. Any
[4:26] prophet after the canon of scripture was
[4:29] fulfilled has to speak thus sayith the
[4:31] Lord or in the name of the Lord to know
[4:33] that it is a prophecy. And I could be
[4:35] wrong on that. That's just my thought at
[4:37] this moment. And then brother Ram said
[4:40] he had nothing on it from the Lord as
[4:42] far as the Martin Luther King Jr. racial
[4:45] situation. He said if I say anything
[4:47] from the Lord like that to you, it's
[4:49] always I'm speaking now. But when he
[4:51] speaks, I say, "It's not me, it's thus
[4:54] sayith the Lord." And I can't say it
[4:56] until he tells me. I could be altogether
[4:58] wrong in my thought about Martin Luther
[5:00] King. I don't know. I can't say. That's
[5:02] just my
[5:03] opinion. So, if we go back to the sermon
[5:06] where he talked about Martin Luther King
[5:08] Jr., the third exodus from June 30th
[5:11] morning,
[5:12] 1963. Brother Random thought Martin
[5:15] Luther King Jr. would lead millions into
[5:18] a death trap. He said, just like Hitler
[5:20] did. And he said, "And that's exactly
[5:22] the same thing." So, Brother Ram thought
[5:24] Martin Luther King Jr. and Adolf Hitler
[5:26] were doing the exact same thing. And he
[5:28] said, "And remember, I'm on tape. You'll
[5:30] see it after maybe after I'm gone."
[5:33] That's exactly what's going to happen.
[5:35] Them precious people will die down there
[5:37] like flies. And so, when they asked
[5:39] Brother Random about this the next
[5:40] month, he said, "I have nothing on it
[5:41] from the Lord, and it didn't speak thus
[5:43] sayith the Lord." So, it's not a
[5:45] prophecy. So here we can see how human
[5:47] prophets in their own human minds can be
[5:49] so dogmatic or think something exactly
[5:51] is going to happen. But yet when asked
[5:54] about it he said I have no thus sayith
[5:55] the Lord on it. So it's just my opinion.
[5:57] So Christians are allowed to have their
[5:59] own opinions. And the way you know it's
[6:01] an opinion is there's no thus sayith the
[6:03] Lord. But if there is a thus sayith the
[6:05] Lord that's a prophecy. And remember
[6:07] friends, when I made that video two
[6:08] weeks ago about the new pope, I noted
[6:10] brother Ram did not say thus sayith the
[6:12] Lord about a new pope coming out of the
[6:14] United States. So again, it's hard to
[6:16] tell if the 1954 new pope quote was a
[6:20] real prophecy. I still don't know if it
[6:23] was a real prophecy because it was so
[6:25] general. There was no thus sayith the
[6:26] Lord. And we don't know if this American
[6:29] pope now, Pope Leo the 14th, will be the
[6:32] official
[6:33] antichrist since that is what brother
[6:35] Ram's quote implies. Brother Ram's quote
[6:38] implies that once the new pope comes out
[6:40] of the United States, then it will form
[6:41] the image of the beast and all the
[6:43] churches will be drove together. So
[6:44] basically, Brother Rams implying when we
[6:46] get the new pope, they'll form the image
[6:48] of the beast that will drive us together
[6:50] for the rapture. So is this the time the
[6:52] bride's going to be driven together for
[6:53] the rapture? I don't know. No one knows.
[6:56] Unless we have a thus sayith the Lord,
[6:58] we don't know. So only thing we can do
[6:59] is just watch and wait and
[7:01] pray. All right. Second question. Which
[7:04] prophecy does this American pope quote
[7:07] fit into? And I said, I don't know.
[7:09] Brother Ram did not tell us a specific
[7:11] verse in the 1954 quote. I think it's a
[7:14] general prophecy about Revelation
[7:17] 13:11-18, which Brother Ram said was the
[7:19] spirit of Rome in the United States as
[7:22] early as May 1954. And then the new pope
[7:25] from the USA quote was in December 1954.
[7:29] So let's listen to that quote here from
[7:31] 1954 May. This is the earliest quote I
[7:34] can find on brother connecting
[7:35] Revelation 13 with United States. If you
[7:38] can find an earlier quote I would love
[7:40] to see that. I'd love to read that by
[7:41] the grace of God. It was in the mark of
[7:43] the beast May 13th
[7:46] 1954. Brother Ram said I beheld another
[7:48] beast coming up out of the earth. He's
[7:50] quoting Revelation 13. And then the
[7:52] thickness and multitudes of people's
[7:54] water. Then this is where there was no
[7:56] people, the United States. He had two
[7:59] horns like a lamb. Let's listen to the
[8:01] quote.
[8:02] And I
[8:03] beheld another beast coming up out of
[8:07] the
[8:08] earth. Not out of water, out of the
[8:13] earth. Then the sickness and multitudes
[8:16] of people is water. Then this is where
[8:17] there was no people, the United States.
[8:21] And he had two horns like a
[8:24] lamb. Two horns like a lamb. Not a lamb.
[8:28] What is it? It's our American buffalo.
[8:30] Amen. Sure. See, there he is. Two horns
[8:34] like a lamb. But then what did he do? He
[8:36] would had freedom of religion. First he
[8:38] acted like a lamb. He spoke like a lamb.
[8:42] But remember, he never did become an old
[8:44] lamb. He was a lamb. Amen. This country
[8:48] is only 150 years old, you know. just
[8:50] the lamb. And then he spake like a
[8:54] dragon and he exercised all the power
[8:58] the first beast had before him, the red
[8:59] dragon, and caused all that was on the
[9:02] earth to draw upon the earth to worship
[9:05] the beast whose deadly wound was healed.
[9:08] Amen.
[9:09] Look, and and he does great wonders so
[9:12] to make a fire come down out of heaven,
[9:14] the atomic bomb and hydrogen, a smart
[9:16] intelligent nation and so forth,
[9:18] deceiving the nations by these things.
[9:20] This United States will come to a time
[9:23] that church and state will unite
[9:25] together and Protestant and Catholic
[9:27] will throw their things together to
[9:29] fight communism. And it's exactly
[9:32] playing in the hands of what God said
[9:33] right here.
[9:35] Question three, what practical benefit
[9:37] does the 1954 new pope quote bring to
[9:40] the bride? Or is it just another
[9:42] prophetic scare? So again, this person's
[9:44] very critical of message believers. So I
[9:47] feel sorry for this person, but I can
[9:49] think of at least four reasons this is a
[9:50] benefit. Uh it helps us live closer to
[9:52] God as we're aware of the end time
[9:55] events. Second, it gives a better
[9:57] understanding of the book of revelation
[9:58] because now we can see since the beast
[10:01] since the spirit of Rome will be in the
[10:03] United States, it's likely the pope will
[10:05] have to be an American pope. Third, it
[10:07] gives more evidence that brother Bram
[10:09] was a prophet because who else was
[10:11] predicting an American pope? Out of the
[10:14] theologians, out of the politicians,
[10:16] very few people predicted that. Although
[10:18] I don't believe the new pope, quote, was
[10:20] an official prophecy. I've heard
[10:22] numerous reporters say that they believe
[10:24] there would never be an American pope.
[10:26] So the fourth reason it proves brother
[10:28] Ram had insight into the book of
[10:30] revelation as the United States is in
[10:33] revelation chapter 13. So we believe
[10:35] brother Ram received that revelation
[10:37] from God because most churches don't
[10:39] know the United States is in revelation
[10:41] 13. Fourth question. In which part of
[10:44] the apocalypse does this forming of the
[10:46] beast by the new pope from the United
[10:48] States appear?
[10:49] Well, the forming of it would probably
[10:51] take place right before the rapture. But
[10:54] according to Revelation 3:10, the mark
[10:56] of the beast is not laid down until the
[10:59] great tribulation period. Because Jesus
[11:02] said, "Because you've kept the word of
[11:04] my patience, I will keep you from the
[11:05] hour that will come upon the face of the
[11:07] whole earth." So before the rapture,
[11:10] we'll be hearing about this beast system
[11:11] forming. Can't buy or sell. We'll be
[11:13] hearing about it. There'll be a time of
[11:15] pressure, a squeeze time. We believe
[11:18] that's when the bride will come
[11:19] together. Jesus will come and rescue his
[11:21] wife off the earth. And then in the
[11:23] tribulation period, that's the time when
[11:26] the mark will be laid down. The fifth
[11:29] question, have the churches already
[11:31] gathered at the famous conference or the
[11:34] United Confederation of Church before
[11:36] the pope became
[11:38] American? And again, I don't know the
[11:40] answer to this question. I don't know if
[11:43] there was an official conference, an
[11:46] official
[11:47] confederation of the churches uniting. I
[11:50] don't know. But we do know that the
[11:52] World Council of Churches represents
[11:53] over half a billion Christians according
[11:57] to their website. Like to show the
[11:58] visual here. Now, this is from the about
[12:01] the World Council of Churches page. What
[12:03] is the World Council of Churches? a
[12:05] fellowship of 352 churches from more
[12:07] than 120 countries representing over 580
[12:13] million Christians
[12:15] worldwide. The sixth question. So, does
[12:17] this mean that not every prophecy is a
[12:19] thus sayith the Lord? And again, I would
[12:22] go back to the first question. Every
[12:24] prophecy has to have a thus sayith the
[12:27] Lord if it was given after the canon of
[12:30] scripture was fulfilled. So I believe
[12:32] brother Ram's 1954 quote was just a
[12:34] general prophecy. It wasn't a specific
[12:36] prophecy. So I believe every prophecy
[12:39] today has to have a thus sayith the Lord
[12:41] on it to be an official
[12:43] prophecy. And seventh and finally is
[12:46] this new pope going to be the antichrist
[12:48] or
[12:49] not. And the answer is we don't know if
[12:52] this pope will be the antichrist or not.
[12:54] It could be this pope or a future pope.
[12:56] No one knows. Only God knows. But again,
[12:59] it is amazing that brother Ram said a
[13:00] pope would come out of the United States
[13:03] 71 years before it happened because many
[13:06] people thought there would never be a
[13:08] pope from the United States. Friends,
[13:11] let's stay solid. Let's stay faithful.
[13:14] Let's not be fanatics as Holy Ghost fil
[13:16] Christians. As brother Bam told us in
[13:19] questions, answers on the seals. Brother
[13:21] Ram said, just live a good, godly
[13:23] Christian life. Show everyone how much
[13:25] you love the Lord Jesus Christ. I
[13:28] believe some people could get in trouble
[13:29] if they're trying to make this pope the
[13:31] actual antichrist. What if he's not? Of
[13:34] course, that hurts the name of Christ.
[13:35] That brings reproach upon the name of
[13:36] Christ and reproach upon the individual.
[13:39] We've just always got to be very careful
[13:41] what we make. Thus sayith the Lord. And
[13:43] this kind of relates to the six major
[13:45] vision and if Camala Harris fulfilled
[13:48] that or not. I do not believe Camala
[13:50] Harris fulfilled the sixth vision
[13:52] because I did not bow to her. The vision
[13:54] said the whole nation bowed to this
[13:56] woman. this powerful woman. I never
[13:59] bowed to Camala Harris naturally or
[14:01] spiritually. And now she's not in power
[14:04] anymore. So this topic of the new pope
[14:07] kind of goes along with the previous
[14:09] vice president, Camala Harris. So we
[14:12] just got to be honest. We just got to be
[14:13] humble. We just got to wait on the Lord.
[14:15] And church, as we wait upon the Lord,
[14:17] God renews our strength like the eagle.
[14:19] Well, that's the anointing we have for
[14:20] this day, the eagle anointing to fly
[14:22] above the worldly things to set in
[14:25] heavenly places in Christ Jesus. If you
[14:27] have any questions, concerns, or
[14:29] testimonies about this video, please
[14:30] contact
[14:31] me. God bless you and may Jesus Christ
[14:34] be the desire of your heart.
[14:37] very happy to be here this afternoon and
[14:39] again in defense of the gospel of Jesus
[14:42] Christ to bring the good tidings the
[14:45] good news that Jesus raised from the
[14:47] dead living among man today his church
[14:50] the same Jesus that was yesterday will
[14:53] be today and
[14:54] forever is never failed
