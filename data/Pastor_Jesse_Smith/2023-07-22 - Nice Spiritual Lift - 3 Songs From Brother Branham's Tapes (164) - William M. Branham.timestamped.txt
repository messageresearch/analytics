[0:10] greetings friends in the mattress name
[0:13] of the Lord Jesus Christ this video is a
[0:16] nice spiritual lift as brother Adam says
[0:18] and I'm putting three songs from Brother
[0:20] branham's tapes
[0:22] on this music related video
[0:24] recently I've been preaching on music
[0:26] and trying to find a balance in the word
[0:28] of God and Lord willing in the future
[0:30] I'll put out a video on this topic but
[0:33] for today I just thought I would play
[0:34] three songs to be a great blessing to
[0:36] you
[0:37] the first was called I was there when
[0:40] the spirit came after this song brother
[0:42] random says thank the Lord for that amen
[0:44] how thankful we are for a nice spiritual
[0:46] lift like that was there when the spirit
[0:48] came
[0:50] the second song is When the Saints Go
[0:51] Marching In brother Branham encourages
[0:53] the people to Pat their feet and get
[0:56] their religion all over them
[0:58] he says just don't get religion in your
[1:01] head get it all over you that's it takes
[1:02] the whole man that's right now let's Pat
[1:04] our feet and then after that brother
[1:06] random immediately goes into the next
[1:08] song We'll Walk In The Light such a
[1:10] beautiful light and today friends I hope
[1:12] you'll use this video to be a nice
[1:14] spiritual lift and also replay this
[1:16] video in the future the Bible says in
[1:18] Ephesians 5 verses 18 through 20 that we
[1:21] are filled with the spirit as we speak
[1:23] to ourselves in Psalms and hymns and
[1:25] spiritual songs
[1:26] singing and making melody in your heart
[1:28] to the Lord so as you listen to these
[1:30] songs I trust you'll give thanks always
[1:32] for all things unto God and the father
[1:34] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ God
[1:38] bless you and may Jesus Christ be the
[1:39] desire of your heart
