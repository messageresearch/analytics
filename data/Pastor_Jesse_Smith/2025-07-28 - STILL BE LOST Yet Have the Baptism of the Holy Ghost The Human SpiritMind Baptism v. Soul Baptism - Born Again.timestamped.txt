[0:00] [Music]
[0:03] I'm going to give you one little chook
[0:04] you. The baptism of the Holy Ghost don't
[0:06] mean you're going in. Not at all. Not
[0:08] going to have no having to do your soul.
[0:10] That's a baptism. See, there's an inside
[0:12] soul in here that has to come from God.
[0:15] Remember, in that spirit, you can be
[0:17] baptized with a genuine spirit of God
[0:20] and still be lost. It's the soul that
[0:22] lives.
[0:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:23] &gt;&gt; That was ordained of God.
[0:26] Greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:28] of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of
[0:30] this video is to answer a viewer's
[0:32] question about a few quotes from God's
[0:34] prophet brother Brandham that seemed to
[0:36] say a person can be baptized with the
[0:38] Holy Ghost and still be lost. This is an
[0:41] excellent question. Question I've had
[0:43] myself before, but by the grace of God
[0:46] and by looking at the context of the
[0:48] quotes and taking every quote back to
[0:50] the scripture, we can fully understand
[0:52] what brother Brandon was saying. The
[0:54] answer to this question is that brother
[0:55] Ramon was saying you can have the Holy
[0:57] Ghost in your spirit. Your human spirit
[1:01] or your mind which is the same thing.
[1:03] The human spirit is the mind as Paul
[1:05] said be renewed in the spirit of your
[1:07] mind.
[1:09] But that anointing can leave because we
[1:11] know the greatest battle ever fought was
[1:13] in the mind and the mind needs
[1:14] transformed every single day. So a
[1:16] person can have the anointing in their
[1:18] mind as brother Ram said every day of
[1:20] their life and still be lost. That's
[1:22] because they could lose that anointing
[1:25] in their minds and then blasphe the Holy
[1:27] Ghost and be lost. But a person who is
[1:30] baptized with the Holy Ghost in their
[1:32] souls is sealed unto the day of their
[1:34] redemption as Ephesians 4:30 says. So in
[1:37] other words, we must have the baptism of
[1:39] the Holy Ghost in our soul. That's the
[1:41] presence of God in our soul in the
[1:44] throne of our heart we would say. And
[1:46] that anointing never leaves. That's a
[1:48] permanent anointing by the grace of God.
[1:51] Before we get to a couple quotes where
[1:53] brother Ram says this, let's do a little
[1:55] bit of a background. It seems like in
[1:57] these two quotes, Brother Random is
[1:59] using denominational Pentecostal
[2:02] terminology of the baptism of the Holy
[2:04] Ghost, which to Pentecostals meant
[2:07] speaking in tongues as the initial
[2:09] evidence of receiving the Holy Ghost.
[2:12] It's most likely brother Ran was
[2:13] preaching to denominational Pentecostals
[2:16] often, especially here in 1965 when he
[2:19] gives us these two quotes. The first
[2:21] quote is from modern events made clear
[2:23] by prophecy in San Bernardino,
[2:25] California. And the second one was in
[2:28] Coina, California. I might be saying
[2:30] that wrong. Forgive me. The message
[2:32] leadership. So, Brother Brand was not
[2:34] speaking to his home church. He was
[2:36] doing the work of an evangelist outside
[2:38] of his home church by the grace of God.
[2:40] Here's a visual. Remember friends, it's
[2:42] so important to know that man has three
[2:43] parts. So, brother Ram is saying, as the
[2:46] Bible teaches, you can have the
[2:47] anointing in your human spirit or mind
[2:50] and still be lost because that anointing
[2:52] is only temporary as long as you allow
[2:54] it. Man has three parts. Body, human
[2:58] spirit or mind. And the third is the
[3:00] soul. The soul is the deepest part of
[3:02] man. That's his nature. That's his
[3:06] control tower, as brother Brandham said,
[3:07] that directs all of his actions. Now,
[3:10] it's understandable. You'll hear brother
[3:11] Brandham say, "I'm going to say
[3:13] something that chokes believers." And
[3:15] it's understandable why these quotes
[3:17] would choke believers. When brother Ram
[3:20] would say, "You can have the baptism of
[3:21] the Holy Ghost and still be lost." It's
[3:23] understandable because Jesus said in
[3:25] John 3:es 5-6 that except a man be born
[3:29] of water and spirit, he cannot enter
[3:31] into the kingdom of God. So Jesus is
[3:33] emphasizing you must be born again. He
[3:35] says that in John 3:7 as well. Marvel
[3:38] not that I said unto thee, you must be
[3:39] born again.
[3:41] And then brother man would make numerous
[3:43] statements like this from 1959
[3:46] questions and answers that Holy Ghost
[3:48] ought to be more important to you than
[3:50] everything else there is in the world.
[3:52] Your prestige, your life, your job, your
[3:55] anything that there is. You should not
[3:57] cease until you have it. You must
[3:59] receive it.
[4:00] &gt;&gt; That Holy Ghost ought to be more
[4:03] important to you than everything else
[4:05] there is in the world.
[4:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:10] your prestige, your life, your job, your
[4:13] anything that there is.
[4:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:16] &gt;&gt; You should not cease until you have,
[4:20] you must receive it.
[4:24] &gt;&gt; So most balanced Bible preachers of the
[4:27] message will emphasize that the baptism
[4:29] of the Holy Ghost is the most important
[4:31] thing. That's because that's what Jesus
[4:32] taught and that's because God's prophet,
[4:35] Brother Brandham, preached that as well.
[4:36] But then as this viewer asked, we run
[4:39] into quotes where brother Ram says, "You
[4:40] can have the baptism and be lost." And
[4:42] so the context of these two quotes will
[4:45] explain it so you can understand it
[4:47] fully by the grace of God. It's also
[4:49] important to know that right up until
[4:51] brother Brandon preached the seven
[4:53] seals, he taught that the new birth was
[4:56] different from the Holy Ghost baptism.
[4:59] There's numerous quotes like this one
[5:01] I'm going to share here. Why I'm Against
[5:02] Organized Religion, November 11th, 1962.
[5:06] But Ram said he heard a preacher,
[5:08] Charles Fuller, on the radio that
[5:11] believes something that he believed too.
[5:13] He said, "The new birth is not the
[5:15] baptism of the Holy Ghost. The new birth
[5:18] is being born. The Holy Ghost is the
[5:20] baptism."
[5:22] &gt;&gt; I never thought there's a person believe
[5:23] that like me till this morning. You
[5:24] heard Charles Fuller as I was going
[5:26] down. He believes too that the new birth
[5:28] is not the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[5:30] The new birth is being born. The Holy
[5:32] Ghost is a baptism.
[5:35] All right.
[5:36] &gt;&gt; So, prior to preaching the revelation of
[5:38] the seven seals in March of 63, it
[5:40] seemed like brother Brandham believed
[5:42] the new birth was the same as being born
[5:44] again. But that was different from the
[5:46] Holy Ghost baptism. Now, we can
[5:48] understand it today and it seems Brother
[5:50] Brandon believed that the new birth or
[5:52] being born again was being saved.
[5:54] Brother Brandon believed that was the
[5:56] act of justification.
[5:58] But then the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[6:00] was the soul being filled by the spirit
[6:02] of God. Now, I have some helpful
[6:04] references, some videos that you'll want
[6:06] to watch if you're interested in this
[6:07] topic. I think the most important one
[6:09] would be the new birth and baptism of
[6:11] the Holy Ghost are one and the same.
[6:13] It's video 102. This will show Brother
[6:15] Ram's progress in his revelation of the
[6:18] baptism of the Holy Ghost. So, I highly
[6:20] recommend that one. Also, you can be
[6:22] saved and not born again. There's five
[6:24] examples from the New Testament of
[6:25] believers who were saved but yet not
[6:27] born again. So, this will show how they
[6:30] had the anointing of the Holy Ghost in
[6:32] their minds or their human spirits, but
[6:35] it wasn't in the soul yet until the
[6:36] Bible tells us they were filled with the
[6:38] Holy Ghost. Then another important one
[6:40] would be the 12 terms for the baptism of
[6:42] the Holy Ghost. Brother Brandham says
[6:44] the filling, new birth, and baptism are
[6:46] the same. This is so important if you
[6:49] want to understand the Bible terminology
[6:52] correctly. I would encourage you to
[6:54] listen to this one, study, take notes on
[6:56] it. For the deepest dive of
[6:58] understanding the scripture on the new
[7:00] birth and the baptism of Holy Ghost, I
[7:02] would humbly recommend uh chapter 6. You
[7:05] can listen to the audiobook version
[7:06] online for free. It's the mystery of
[7:08] Christ in you, the hope of glory. This
[7:10] was chapter 6 in my 2021 book. It shows
[7:13] how Old Testament believers could have
[7:15] the filling of the Holy Ghost. Like it
[7:17] said of Bezale, one of the men who did a
[7:19] lot of construction on Moses'
[7:20] tabernacle, he was filled with the
[7:22] spirit of God. But that can only mean in
[7:24] the human mind or spirit because of John
[7:26] 7:37-39.
[7:28] The Holy Ghost could not be given until
[7:30] Jesus was glorified or until Jesus had
[7:32] resurrected and taken on a glorified
[7:34] body. Recently, I put out a video that
[7:36] will help as well. It's called question
[7:38] work for the Holy Ghost. Yes, work
[7:40] equals obey. Brother Ram taught that the
[7:43] rest was equal to the baptism of the
[7:45] Holy Ghost. This is super important if
[7:47] you want to understand this topic. In
[7:49] the New Testament, Jesus offered the
[7:52] Holy Ghost in the soul. It was rest for
[7:54] the soul. The soul no longer had to
[7:56] wrestle against God or fight against
[7:58] God. The soul could be fully filled with
[8:00] the Holy Ghost by the grace of God.
[8:02] Okay. So now, let's look at these two
[8:04] puzzling quotes that Brother Bram said
[8:06] might choke you. Hallelujah. Might choke
[8:08] us, but that's okay. We grow in grace
[8:10] and knowledge of the Lord. The first is
[8:11] from modern events made clear by
[8:13] prophecy, December 6,65. Brother Ram
[8:16] said, "I'm going to give you one that'll
[8:18] choke you. The baptism of the Holy Ghost
[8:19] don't mean you're going in. Not at all.
[8:21] Not on that. Don't have anything to do
[8:23] with your soul." So notice he separates
[8:26] the soul from the human spirit. So
[8:28] brother Ram says the Pentecostals would
[8:30] have the filling in their human spirits
[8:32] or minds, but not in their soul. And
[8:35] then he goes on to talk about how
[8:36] there's five inlets to the human spirit.
[8:39] There's five inlets to the human body,
[8:41] but there's only one inlet to the soul.
[8:43] Then brother Ram says,"Remember in that
[8:45] spirit, that human spirit, you can be
[8:47] baptized with the genuine spirit of God
[8:49] and still be lost. It's the soul that
[8:51] lives that was ordained of God." Let's
[8:53] listen to the quote.
[8:54] &gt;&gt; Notice we find today that people just
[8:57] can't believe it. Even spiritfilled
[8:59] people. I'm going to give you one little
[9:02] choke. The baptism of the Holy Ghost
[9:03] don't mean you're going in. Not at all.
[9:06] Not going to have no having to do with
[9:07] your soul. That's a baptism. See,
[9:09] there's an inside soul in here that has
[9:11] to come from God. But then on the
[9:13] outside you have five senses and five
[9:15] out inlets to your contact your earthly
[9:17] home. The inside you have a spirit and
[9:20] in there you have five outlets. Your
[9:21] conscience and love and so forth. Five
[9:24] outlets to that spirit. Remember in that
[9:27] spirit you can be baptized with a
[9:28] genuine spirit of God and still be lost.
[9:31] It's the soul that lives.
[9:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:33] &gt;&gt; That was ordained of God. And then the
[9:36] next paragraph, brother Ram says the
[9:38] scripture from Matthew 7:21-23
[9:41] where Jesus said, "Many will say to me
[9:43] in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not
[9:44] cast out devils?" And he'll say, "Depart
[9:46] from me, you workers of iniquity. I
[9:48] never knew you." And then he brings up
[9:50] Caiaphas. And then he brings up Balam.
[9:52] So Brother Ram gives three Bible
[9:54] witnesses. I love it. Brother Ram, such
[9:55] a scriptural prophet. three Bible
[9:58] witnesses of people that had the
[9:59] anointing of the Holy Ghost temporarily,
[10:01] but then they worked iniquity after the
[10:03] anointing left and they forfeited their
[10:05] salvation and they were lost. These many
[10:08] people on the day of judgment, Matthew
[10:10] 7, Caiaphas, and Balum.
[10:12] &gt;&gt; Didn't Jesus say, "Many will come to me
[10:14] that day and say, Lord, haven't I cast
[10:16] out devils, done great, mighty works,
[10:18] prophesied the great gifts of God." He
[10:20] said, "Depart from me, you that work
[10:22] iniquity. I never even knew you." Amen.
[10:25] &gt;&gt; Many will come in that day. Didn't K.
[10:27] Ephesus prophesy?
[10:29] &gt;&gt; He was a devil.
[10:30] &gt;&gt; We find out there in that priest, a
[10:33] great man was supposed to be great
[10:34] leaders in them days with humility and
[10:36] everything else, but failed to see the
[10:39] word of God itself made manifest before
[10:42] them.
[10:43] &gt;&gt; We could just take a bunch of them. I
[10:45] got wrote down here. How about Balum? He
[10:47] was a You say God changes his mind. He
[10:50] doesn't change his mind.
[10:51] &gt;&gt; So, it's so awesome. We have a
[10:53] scriptural prophet in the last days,
[10:55] brother William Brandham. By the grace
[10:56] of God, he always pointing us back to
[10:58] the word of God. And the second one I'll
[11:01] give you is leadership. December 7th,
[11:02] the next day, 1965, brother Ram said,
[11:04] "Many of you think I got the baptism of
[11:06] the Holy Ghost. I'm going to heaven."
[11:08] That don't mean one thing that you're
[11:09] going to heaven. You can have the
[11:11] baptism of the Holy Ghost every hour in
[11:13] your life and still be lost and go to
[11:15] hell. The Bible says so. Now brother Ram
[11:18] doesn't give us scripture right there
[11:20] directly in the context but of course if
[11:22] we go to the previous day when he
[11:24] preached on it he gave us three
[11:26] scriptures Matthew 7 Caiaphas scripture
[11:29] and the scriptures about Balum then in
[11:31] this leadership quote brother Ram goes
[11:33] into the five inlets to the human spirit
[11:35] and the five inlets to the human body
[11:38] but then he says but inside of that
[11:40] you've got a soul and that soul is that
[11:43] gene that come from God and then he
[11:45] breaks into a few paragraphs on
[11:47] predestination. This reminds us of 1
[11:49] Peter 1:23. You must be born again of
[11:52] the incorruptible seed, the word of God.
[11:54] So the Holy Ghost, baptism in the soul
[11:57] is like a seed of God coming into your
[11:59] soul, giving life to your soul. Let's
[12:02] listen to the quote.
[12:03] &gt;&gt; The choice of your conduct, you could
[12:06] you can't mix it now. You're either for
[12:09] God or against God.
[12:11] &gt;&gt; And the outward expressions shows
[12:13] exactly what's on the inside.
[12:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:17] the cockaber. Many of you think I got
[12:20] the baptism of the Holy Ghost, I'm going
[12:21] to heaven. That don't mean one thing
[12:22] that you're going to heaven.
[12:24] &gt;&gt; No sir, you can have the baptism of the
[12:26] Holy Ghost every hour in your life and
[12:27] still be lost and go to hell.
[12:30] &gt;&gt; The Bible says so.
[12:31] &gt;&gt; It's exactly right. Look here. You are a
[12:35] outside person. You have five senses
[12:37] that contacts that outside body. God
[12:39] gave you five senses not to contact him.
[12:41] Your earthly home. See, taste, feel,
[12:43] smell, and hear. Then you have a spirit
[12:44] on the inside of that and it has five
[12:47] outlets. Conscience and love and so
[12:48] forth. Five outlets that you contact the
[12:51] spirit world with that. But with your
[12:54] spirit, your physical contacts the
[12:57] physical. Your spiritual contacts the
[12:59] spiritual. But inside of that you've got
[13:01] a soul.
[13:03] &gt;&gt; That soul is that chain.
[13:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:06] &gt;&gt; That come from God.
[13:09] &gt;&gt; We can do a few more Bible proofs here.
[13:10] By God's grace. Remember the baptism of
[13:12] the Holy Ghost is a mystery. That's why
[13:13] brother Bram said these things will
[13:15] choke people. It's hard to understand.
[13:17] You got to get into the spirit of the
[13:19] word of God. The human mind, the natural
[13:21] intellectual human mind cannot
[13:23] understand the deep things of God. It
[13:24] clearly teaches that in 1 Corinthians
[13:26] chapter 2. Paul said that the carnal
[13:28] mind is enmity against the spirit of
[13:30] God. But remember the Holy Ghost baptism
[13:33] is a mystery according to Colossians
[13:34] 1:26-28. But brother Brandham in the
[13:37] church age book gave us the revelation
[13:39] and he said it doesn't come according to
[13:40] me but it must come according to thus
[13:42] sayith the Lord. Then he went through
[13:43] all these scriptures in the Bible about
[13:45] how people had to be saved, sanctified
[13:47] and baptized with the Holy Ghost. You'll
[13:50] find that in chapter 4 of the church age
[13:52] book sian church age. He said it's not
[13:54] according to me. It's not according to
[13:56] you. It has to be according to thus
[13:57] sayith the Lord or we are falsely led.
[13:59] Amen. And then he goes through about 20
[14:01] Bible verses showing thus sayith the
[14:03] Lord on the mystery of the baptism of
[14:05] the Holy Ghost. 1 Thessalonians 5:23 is
[14:09] also super important as the visual
[14:10] showed. You have three parts. You have
[14:12] body, human spirit which is the same as
[14:15] your human mind and the innermost part
[14:17] is the soul.
[14:19] This topic also closely relates to
[14:22] brother Bam's sermon from 1965, the
[14:24] anointed ones at the end time. how
[14:26] people can have the anointing on their
[14:28] flesh or their human mind but then
[14:30] forsake it later as a work of iniquity
[14:33] and then be lost. So that's an important
[14:35] message to listen to by the grace of
[14:36] God.
[14:38] And also as brother Random told us, it
[14:40] breaks into predestination. You'll find
[14:41] that in Ephesians 1:4. You had to be
[14:43] chosen in Christ before the foundation
[14:45] of the world. And there's five stages to
[14:48] predestination. You're fornown. You're
[14:51] predestinated. You're called, justified,
[14:54] glorified according to Romans 8:29 and
[14:57] 30. And then the people that are lost,
[14:59] Jude 1:4 says they're ordained to this
[15:01] condemnation. And then 2 Peter 2:12
[15:04] said, "They were made to be taken and
[15:06] destroyed." We should rejoice. If we
[15:08] have a hunger and thirst for God, if we
[15:10] want to know more of God, we want to
[15:11] worship God, we want to surrender to
[15:12] God, we should rejoice because that
[15:14] proves we're the children of God. We
[15:17] want to be workers of righteousness, not
[15:19] workers of iniquity. In closing,
[15:21] friends, I hope this video was a
[15:22] blessing by the grace of God. Again,
[15:24] please find those other videos if you
[15:26] want to go deeper on this topic by the
[15:28] grace of God. It's an excellent topic.
[15:30] It's so important because it is a Bible
[15:32] defined mystery. Colossians 1:26-28,
[15:35] the mystery that was hid from ages,
[15:37] Christ in you, the hope of glory. And
[15:40] again, it shows us how brother was way
[15:41] ahead of his time. He had the revelation
[15:43] from the Lord Jesus Christ. He finished
[15:45] the mystery of God. He said, "Revelation
[15:48] 10:1-7 is history." That means the
[15:51] mystery of God is finished. That means
[15:53] the seven thunders have been revealed
[15:54] and we understand what they are. They're
[15:56] the revelations contained in the seven
[15:58] seals. And now we can have the assurance
[16:00] if we have the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[16:02] in our souls. Then we are sealed unto
[16:05] the day of our redemption, we will never
[16:06] be lost. We were predestinated to be
[16:09] saved. We were chosen in Christ before
[16:11] the foundation of the world. What a
[16:13] promise. What a blessing. What a joy
[16:16] divine. And so let's do as Peter said,
[16:18] let's make our calling and our election
[16:20] sure. Calling means the same as election
[16:23] in the Greek. So Peter references one of
[16:26] those steps there in the five steps of
[16:29] predestination.
[16:30] If we believe we were predestinated,
[16:32] let's prove it with our lives. Let's
[16:34] beat our body and bring it under
[16:36] subjection in obedience to the word of
[16:38] God so the Holy Ghost can live through
[16:40] our lives. If you have any questions,
[16:43] concerns or testimonies about this
[16:44] video, please contact me.
[16:47] God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[16:49] the desire of your heart.
[16:52] Very happy to be here this afternoon and
[16:54] again in defense of the gospel of Jesus
[16:57] Christ to bring the good tidings, the
[17:00] good news that Jesus raised from the
[17:02] dead, living among man today, his
[17:04] church. The same Jesus that was
[17:06] yesterday will be today and forever.
[17:10] is never fail.
[17:14] [Music]
