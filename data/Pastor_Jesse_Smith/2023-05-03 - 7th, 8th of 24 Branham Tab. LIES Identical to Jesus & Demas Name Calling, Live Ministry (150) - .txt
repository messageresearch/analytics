TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] that's just been able to read and yes [Music] greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to show the 7th and 8th out of 24 Lies coming out of Branham Tabernacle let's review the first six lies the first lies every word on tape is thus saith the Lord and the tapes can never be wrong and the tapes have no mistakes the second lie is all the answers are on the tapes the third lie is unquestionally believe every word on tape is thus say the Lord the fourth lie is a false vision of a denominational mandate for every Church to play the tapes the fifth lie is the tapes are the token and being part of a tape church is the token and the sixth lie is that Tate boys are the true five-fold Ministry and tapes are number one in the fivefold ministry so let's begin with the seventh lie now one of the leaders at voice of God Recordings claimed brother branham's human spirit and soul were identical to Jesus Christ's human spirit and soul this is a gross Heir and I wrote to the individual to try to bring correction but he did not address it and he did not repent let's watch the video so you can see the context in which he made this lie [Applause] out of this blessed book Saul come a man called William Branham he preached like the Bible preach he talked like Jesus he walked like Jesus he lived like Jesus but his name was William Branham the only difference is the Corporal body and anything I don't believe that is a seed of discrepancy so friends as you can see this statement is a lie when you really think about it and take everything back to the word of God as the Bible says prove all things you realize brother Branham was not the same as Jesus Christ in any of his three parts of his being remember first Thessalonians 5 23 says every person has a soul human Spirit or mind and a body now as you just heard this brother said the physical body of Jesus and brother Branham were different of course that's true but then he said the two other Realms of brother Ram's being were identical to Christ and that's a lie Hebrews 4 15 says Jesus was tempted like as we are in all points yet without sin so that means Jesus's human mind never sinned that's different from Brother branham's mind brother Branham said we all sin every day and then he said he makes thousands of mistakes or sins every year as previous videos has showed so it's clear brother random sinned in his mind every single day just as each one of us do so brother Ram's mind cannot be identical to the mind of Jesus Christ because Jesus Christ overcame every Temptation in the mind and committed no sins no sinful thoughts and regarding brother random Soul Brother Ram's Soul like every sinner saved by grace was at one time dead in sins according to Ephesians 2 verse 1 and verse 5 which says and you hathy quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins verse 5 even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ by Grace ye are saved so friends Jesus's Soul was never dead in sins and trespasses yet the Bible says every one of us were but then thankfully by God's grace Jesus Christ quickened us together with him so friends we can see this is an idolatrous statement to say that brother Brennan was identical to Jesus in his human mind or human spirit and soul this is Prophet worship plain and simple this is the deity spirit trying to worship brother Branham any True Believer will not worship anyone but Jesus Christ now I'm not quite sure but it seems this precious brother is misunderstanding this quote that his father often quoted and here's just one example from an exodus 1956 brother Branham says that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and that he's the same today in every way except a Corporal body so brother Ram is talking about Jesus the Holy Ghost is here today Jesus spirit is here today and his spirit is the exact same in every manner in power and character and Grace and forgiveness in love but the only difference about Jesus today is that his Corporal body is not here of course his Corporal body is now a glorified body and it sits on Heaven's Throne at the right hand of the Majesty on high so let's listen to the quote from Brother Branham yesterday today and forever Hebrews 13 8. you believe that well then if he is the same he's got to be the same in principle he's got to be the same in power he's got to be the same in every way except for Corporal body is that right or God raised up his Corporal body sitting on the right hand of God and sent down the comforter which is Christ again now friends if this leader at voice of God Recordings can't understand this simple clear quote from Brother Branham that it's about Jesus only and not brother Branham then he should not have a microphone in his hand and he should not speak publicly about the word of God hopefully our brother will repent at some point in the future but that's between him and God the eighth lie is that brother Branham still has a living Ministry and anyone that doesn't believe that is a Demas so Branham tabernacle's leadership uses name calling to accuse anyone who does not believe brother Branham has a living ministry as a Demis character and of course Demas in the Bible is one that forsook the prophet Saint Paul because he loved the present world so Branham tabernacle's leadership is accusing the five-fold ministry that will not play brother Ram's tapes as the number one Ministry of being edemus loving the present World more than they love the word of God and of course that's a lie so first let's listen to the quote from Brenham tabernacle's leadership that states this lie it's just the way that it is [Music] [Music] I know I'm gonna get it for that well that's all right I'm not against nothing [Music] [Music] now friends this lie is easily debunked first we start with Hebrews 13 8 that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever so if Jesus Christ was the same yesterday or in the past we can go back to the days of Moses and Joshua because Jesus is the same today as he was in the days of Moses and Joshua so what did God do when Moses was ready to die and go off the scene according to numbers 2716 the Bible said let the Lord the god of the spirits of All Flesh set a man over the congregation and then in verse 17 it says which may go out before them and which may go in before them and which may lead them out and which may bring them in that the congregation Lord be not as sheep which have no Shepherd then verse 20 says and thou shalt put some of thine honor upon him that all the congregation of children of Israel may be obedient so Jesus Christ yesterday raised up another man Joshua when his Prophet Moses was going off the scene God didn't tell Joshua Moses is still going to have a live Ministry like Branham Tabernacle is falsely claiming today and of course when we read Joshua 1 verses 1 and 2 the Bible said no after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of nun Moses his Minister saying Moses my servant is dead now therefore arise go over this Jordan thou and all this people unto the land which I do give to them even to the children of Israel notice God did not tell Joshua Moses still has a live Ministry he's still living and you've got to put Moses first and Moses Ministry is number one and your ministry is number two of course that's ridiculous that's not what the Bible says dead men do not have a living Ministry according to Hebrews 13 8 numbers 27 and Joshua chapter 1. God has always had living men as the Living Ministries of their days of their Church ages of their time periods that they lived in remember Romans 10 verse 15 says how should they preach except they be sent as it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring Glad Tidings of good things this proves Living Ministries are made up of living men whose feet travel to preach the gospel we all know brother Branham has passed away his body's in the grave so brother Branham does not have a living Ministry but God knew that that's why he raised up the fivefold ministry after brother Branham passed away and the fivefold ministry will continue the Bible says till we all come in the unity of the faith according to Hebrews chapter 4 verses 8 through 16. now let's listen to a quote where brother Branham said you younger ministers have to take our place someday he was speaking of himself and brother Neville brother Ram never said you young ministers have to give me back my Pulpit even after I die like Jeffersonville is saying today which is a bunch of nonsense brother Ram never said Keep Me in the Pulpit after I die keep me number one and all the rest of the fivefold ministry number two or secondary as you listen to this quote from taking sides with Jesus brother Ram said he was grateful for preachers he did not rebuke them for not putting the tapes first even during his lifetime so let's listen to this quote from taking sides with Jesus Christ Sellersburg group and a brother back there that just taken brother snelling's place at Utica and brother Randall up here and brother Junior Jackson and those precious boys who are a fine man wonderful man of God they preached this message now they made one might disagree just literally I own something and other that's only human amongst the group of the ministers yet the rest of you brother God richly bless you you're a young man I'm getting old but Neville's getting old we're middle-aged man time rolls on we're gonna walk off the scene that's why you've got to fill our shoes man and so you seeing that maybe in that day even if we grow greater if there is a tomorrow now friends also remember quotes from the previous videos brother Ram said don't change a thing regarding the Evangelical preaching Ministry and yet Branham Tabernacle has changed almost everything about the fivefold ministry and brother Branham said he was right behind the preachers he told them to keep preaching just as hard as they can so those of us in the fivefold ministry we know if brother bran was here he'd be right behind us because that's the Bible pattern that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever The Only Living Ministries are the men who are still alive today and friends are probably familiar with these quotes from birth pains 1965. brother random said these men if they pick up this and goes out with it they can make more sense to it see to bring it to a place you would I just want to lay this seed then hope they make it come to life notice C also in things that are to be 1965 brother random said the inspiration it's give to young man like your pastor here that's caused them as I'm beginning to get old and know that my days are numbered and know now that these young men can take this message and sweep it on to the coming of the Lord if he doesn't come in my generation and then he said in Divine Healing 1954 when my days is finished and I've done my best if I be God's servant God will raise him up another man in that day when I'm gone so there's no need of me setting something around my theology is me to live in what light I have and wait till on God for the Next Generation to come he will have a man there when that generation comes up amen end quote and notice after brother Graham died brother Orman Neville was there to keep preaching just as brother am said in 1954. so friends who is the real Demas of this time fivefold preachers have been name called Demas by the leadership at Branham Tabernacle but who is the real Demas who is the real demon that has left Paul's gospel as recorded in the New Testament who has gotten rich off the gospel having loved the present World who's rich with millions of dollars in assets for preaching very little and not even weekly gathering with Saints though the Bible says we should gather more as we see that day approaching who is the one not saying what Saint Paul said of course that's the leadership at Branham Tabernacle brother Branham said a true Prophet would not change one iota of Paul's gospel yet Branham Tabernacle leadership has injected Tate boys into Joshua chapter 2 in Ephesians 4 verse 11 and they've injected these other 23 lies into their teachings so we can clearly see who is the modern day Demus today Demas left the prophet Paul for the present world and friends we who love the Bible are the ones staying with brother branham's words while overcoming the wicked one in this present World Brenham Tabernacle and vog are the ones leaving brother random's instructions on tape in this present World remember in the church age book brother random said anyone not saying what Saint Paul said in the Bible is false therefore the Branham Tabernacle leadership is under a false anointing Paul never said Tate boys are the true five-fold Ministry Paul never said dead prophets are number one in the fivefold ministry and the rest are secondary let's listen to the quote from the Ephesian Church age chapter 3 in the church age book s we're full of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of Paul's hands they look those false Apostles in the eye and said you are not saying what Paul said you are therefore false oh that sets my heart on fire get back to the word it is not you that really tries the Apostle and prophet and teacher it is the word that tries them one of these days there is going to come a prophet to the laodicean church age and you will know if he is the real one sent from God or not yes you will for if he is of God he will be in that word exactly as God gave it to Paul he won't deviate from that word for a moment not by one iota in closing friends I hope this video has been a blessing as we continue this series friends all these things are spoken in broadly kindness in hopes Brenham Tabernacle leadership and his followers will repent I don't know who will but if even one repents as the Bible says we just want to save Souls from a multitude of sin and here we see over 24 lies or sins against the true Revelation that Jesus Christ gave to Saint Paul and then restored through his Prophet brother Branham so let's pray for those in the Branham Tabernacle Ministry and those being influenced by its false influence all around the world father God we come again in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and we ask God that you have mercy upon this false movement may you send these truths Lord to those that will receive it that they may be set free out of the bondage of the lies of false Doctrine May the Holy Spirit convict them and may they receive the truth and may they come out of her my people may they come out of the false tape Church movement repent of their sins and Trust Jesus Christ alone for salvation for justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the rapture we thank you Lord that your truth will prevail and all that the father has given me will come to me and you will not lose any we ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name amen if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
