TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] greetings friends in the majesty of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to teach the truth about marriage and divorce contrary to popular opinion the truth our marriage and divorce is quite straightforward in the Bible this is an extremely personal subject but yet it is a Bible subject with such importance for today that just as in the days of Moses and st. Paul God had to send a vindicated prophet named William Branham to reveal the truth about marriage and divorce marriage terminology to fully understand the Bible truths about marriage and divorce understanding the King James Version terminology is of the utmost importance here are important Bible terms and phrases we must understand with support from Scripture we begin with the word espouse which means to be pledged to or promised in marriage to another by a vow an engagement to be married to be betrothed this term is found in matthew chapter 1 verse 18 now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise when as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph before they came together she was found with child of the Holy Ghost the Greek definition is to woo her and ask her in marriage to be promised in marriage be betrothed Mary was espoused to Joseph Joseph had asked her hand in marriage and she and it's likely her father had agreed Joseph and Mary promised or vowed to be married to each other it is crucial to understand that in God's eyes this is spousal or engagement vow is what literally marries the couple and guy recognizes a couple is married once this espousal or engagement has taken place as seen by matthew 1 verse 20 the angel alert told Joseph to fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife God had already considered Mary as Joseph's wife even though they were not physically living together and had not had any sexual relations yet we then understand that God takes engagements and vows very seriously even though most people do not today the second term is bound which is directly connected to the first word of spouse for bound means to be under more legal obligation to remain faithfully married to one spouse until one spouse dies once the couple vows to be married and become espoused they're bound for their entire lives as Romans 7 1 through 3 teaches though he not brethren for I speak to them that know the law how that their law has dominion over man as long as he liveth for the woman which happened husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she is loosed from the law of her husband so then if while her husband liveth she be married to another man she shall be called an adulteress but if her husband be dead she is free from that law so that she is no adulteress though she be married to another man a married couple is bound to one another until death the life is under the law of a husband in the New Testament a divorce does not free or loose a person from being bound to their first spouse Jesus thought this truth when he said what therefore God hath joined together let not man put asunder in Matthew 19 verse 6 anyone who divorces their first spouse and marries another is living in the sin of adultery because they are bound to the law of their first spouse they're under moral obligation to remain married to that person until death this truth of married couples being bound until death was clearly seen in the life of Herod Antipas and Herodias during the Ministry of John the Baptist and the Lord Jesus John the Baptist was put in prison by Herod because John the Baptist told him it was not lawful for her to be married to Herodias for Herodias had a living husband already which was Herod's stepbrother Philip Mark 6 17 through 18 for Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John and bound him in prison for Herodias sake his brother Philips wife for he had married her for John had sent unto Herod it is not lawful for thee to have thy brother's wife this leads into our third term which is adultery adultery is defined as voluntary sexual intercourse between a married man and someone other than his first wife or between a married woman and someone other than her first husband adultery includes anyone who is living with a second third or more husband or wife and yet already has a living spouse from a first marriage they no longer live with as plainly taught by Christ Jesus in Matthew chapter 5 verse 32 when I say unto you that whosoever shall put away his wife saving for the cause of fornication causes her to commit adultery and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery this was the situation of Herod Antipas and Herodias who were living in adultery and rebuked by the Prophet John the Baptist for their unlawful marriage because Herodias was already bound by the law of God to her first husband Phillip but she failed to remain faithfully married to him which made her inherit Antipas adulterers in the sight of God the fourth term is fornication which is any voluntary sexual act committed between two unmarried people any sexual activity before marriage this term can be understood by reading 1st Corinthians 7 verse 2 nevertheless to avoid fornication let every man have his own wife and let every woman have her own husband a fifth term is divorce which is the act of legally ending a marriage and is mentioned in Matthew 19 verse 7 the New Testament also uses the words put away to mean divorce Matthew 19 verse 7 they say in the end why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement and to put her away he served unto them Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives but from the beginning it was not so today a divorce may dissolve a marriage in the eyes of the law but not in the eyes of God for every couples bound to their first spouse until death according to Romans 7 1 through 3 Jesus himself taught that there is only one situation in which divorce and remarriage is permitted and we will teach on that soon in this video series Jesus taught that God permitted divorce and remarriage in the Old Testament but now in the New Testament God was requiring that married couples go back to the standard of the beginning when one man married one woman and were never divorced or put asunder Jesus is teaching then condemns anyone engaging in polygamy which is a marriage in which a spouse of either sex may have more than one mate at the same time a sixth term is depart or separate which is to cease from living together as a married couple but not yet legally divorced as taught in 1st Corinthians 7 verses 10 through 11 and unto the married I command yet not i but the Lord let not the wife depart from her husband Beth and if she depart let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband and let not the husband put away his wife notice the st. Paul taught that the Lord permitted married couples to depart or separate from one another for serious reasons but never permitted remarriage to a different person to departing or leaving for that would be adultery after a separation the couple has only two options if they want to honor God either remain separated and unmarried to anyone else or reconcile and get back together resuming their marriage if a couple cannot get along through the serious reasons the couple may separate and not live together but the couple cannot marry someone else or they will be living in a battery according to Jesus in Matthew 19 verse 9 whosoever shall put away his wife except it be for fornication and shall marry another committeth adultery and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery a seventh and final term is the word whoremonger or whoremonger is a male is a female these words can mean a man or woman who prostitutes his or her body to another's lust for hire or a male/female prostitute or a man or woman who indulges in unlawful sexual intercourse for gain or lust whoremongers those who indulge in unlawful sexual relationships without repenting and changing their lives which can also be considered either adopters or fornicators will be condemned by God and burned the lake of fire according to Revelation 21 verse 8 but the fearful and unbelieving and the abominable and murderers and whoremongers and sorcerers and idolaters and all Liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone which is the second death please continue viewing part 2 of this video series on marriage divorce and the Bible if you like more bible scriptures and quotations about marriage and divorce please contact us god bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
