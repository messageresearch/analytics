[0:00] chapter 5 jewelry makeup tattoos
[0:03] and high heels includes footnotes
[0:06] numbers 237-315
[0:11] i will praise thee for i am fearfully
[0:13] and wonderfully made
[0:14] marvelous are thy works and that my soul
[0:17] knoweth right well
[0:19] psalm 139 verse 14.
[0:22] in addition to modest clothing and hair
[0:24] length four other areas of your outward
[0:26] appearance
[0:27] should be examined according to the
[0:28] bible this chapter will expound on the
[0:31] bible's witnesses about the following
[0:33] accessories
[0:34] for your outward appearance jewelry
[0:36] makeup
[0:37] tattoos and high heels
[0:41] christian liberties with the proper
[0:43] understanding of our christian liberties
[0:45] you can be sure you are walking in the
[0:47] faith and strengthening
[0:48] other believers faith at the same time
[0:52] christian liberties can be defined as
[0:53] carnal earthly actions that are not
[0:56] sins but also do not make us more
[0:58] spiritual
[0:59] in other words god gives us freedom of
[1:01] choice and we can either allow
[1:02] actions or disallow them god does not
[1:05] give us freedom of choice in regards to
[1:07] make up
[1:08] tattoos and high heels for each is
[1:10] contrary to scripture
[1:12] however there is some freedom of choice
[1:14] with certain types of jewelry
[1:16] whether we allow or disallow liberties
[1:18] our hearts must offer thanksgiving
[1:20] unto our lord jesus christ if you have
[1:23] any doubt that an action is not pleasing
[1:25] to god and cannot give god thanks
[1:27] during the action you must abstain from
[1:29] it
[1:30] whatever is not done in faith is sin
[1:34] there are times that christians should
[1:35] not display their liberties in public
[1:37] but keep them private between themselves
[1:39] and god alone
[1:41] when deciding whether or not to act upon
[1:43] a liberty
[1:44] loving your neighbor should be your
[1:45] greatest concern the bible commands us
[1:48] to choose actions that please
[1:50] others rather than ourselves as jesus
[1:53] christ modeled for us
[1:57] some texts that deal with christian
[1:58] liberties are romans 14
[2:01] verses 1 to 23 first corinthians 8
[2:04] verses 1 to 13 and first corinthians 10
[2:08] verses 14 through 33 in these texts
[2:12] the specific examples of christian
[2:14] liberties include foods
[2:16] observing holy days and wine
[2:20] first the food we eat is an area of
[2:22] christian liberty as some may choose to
[2:24] eat meat while
[2:25] others may eat only herbs or vegetables
[2:29] in paul's time the eating of meat was an
[2:30] issue as believers in corinth
[2:33] would find themselves in public and
[2:34] private settings where meat would be
[2:36] offered them to eat
[2:38] if those serving the meat to the
[2:40] christians expressed that the meat was
[2:41] offered in a sacrifice to idols
[2:43] the apostles urged believers to be aware
[2:46] that other
[2:47] weaker believers may be watching them
[2:49] and thus it would be wise to refrain
[2:51] from eating the meat
[2:52] due to its connection to idolatry
[2:55] the experienced believer knew that
[2:56] eating meat sacrificed to an idol would
[2:58] not
[2:59] have any impact upon his faith for he
[3:01] could ignore the idolatry and give
[3:03] thanks to christ for the food
[3:05] but the weaker believer may be impacted
[3:07] by fear
[3:08] of the meat's connection to idolatry the
[3:11] lesson is that we should not choose an
[3:13] action that will cause a weaker believer
[3:15] to stumble into sin
[3:16] even if the action does not make us sin
[3:21] next observing holy days are days that
[3:24] christians separate as more important
[3:26] days than others
[3:28] paul stressed that no matter if a day is
[3:30] considered holy
[3:31] every day should be a day to be thankful
[3:33] for some christians might observe jewish
[3:36] feast days
[3:37] or keep the sabbath but the apostle made
[3:39] it clear
[3:40] that these observances were shadows of
[3:42] things to come
[3:43] and not the ultimate meaning which was
[3:46] christ
[3:47] the lesson is to respect others
[3:48] convictions and be thankful
[3:51] that they are worshiping jesus christ
[3:53] last
[3:54] drinking wine is an area of christian
[3:56] liberty according to paul
[3:58] as a guideline christians should abstain
[4:00] from all public and private alcohol
[4:02] consumption
[4:03] except in church communion services and
[4:05] for genuine medicinal needs
[4:09] the major concern with wine as with me
[4:12] offered to idols
[4:13] is that we don't cause others to stumble
[4:15] into sin
[4:16] paul wrote that christians may be
[4:18] offered to drink wine in public or in
[4:20] someone's home
[4:21] and would then have to be very cautious
[4:23] about who was watching them drink wine
[4:28] paul teaches that any drink that has
[4:29] alcoholic content should be not consumed
[4:31] by a christian
[4:33] in a public setting for the protection
[4:35] of the consciences
[4:36] of weaker christians who may see a
[4:38] christian drinking wine
[4:40] and then go get drunk eventually
[4:42] becoming apostate to christianity
[4:44] due to drunkenness recall that drunkards
[4:48] will not inherit the kingdom of god
[4:50] the conclusion is that wine should not
[4:52] be drank in public
[4:54] except during a church communion service
[4:59] the public use of wine was different in
[5:01] the days of christ than it is today
[5:03] wine drank in public would either have
[5:05] been watered down
[5:06] or drank in very small amounts over long
[5:08] periods of time
[5:10] in order to avoid drunkenness as
[5:12] evidenced in jesus's first miracle
[5:15] jesus was god in flesh and god's
[5:18] unchanging standard condemns drunkenness
[5:20] from both testaments jesus would not do
[5:23] a miracle that would lead people to
[5:24] committing the sin of drunkenness
[5:27] therefore either the wine was watered
[5:29] down or the portions of wine that would
[5:31] be drunk
[5:32] at a long wedding reception were very
[5:35] small
[5:36] jesus miracle of turning water into wine
[5:38] was a legitimate miracle
[5:40] as the hand of god created the best
[5:41] quality of wine for the latter part of
[5:44] the wedding reception
[5:45] yet we know god would not be pleased
[5:47] with the reception filled with drunks
[5:49] for his word condemns drunkenness
[5:54] today public usage of wine is not as
[5:56] moderate as the days of christ
[5:58] often celebrations such as receptions
[6:01] and new year's parties result in much
[6:03] drunkenness with very little moderation
[6:07] therefore a christian should refrain
[6:08] from drinking in these public venues
[6:10] that his liberty not become a stumbling
[6:13] block to weaker christians who are
[6:14] watching his actions
[6:17] furthermore wine has become a major
[6:20] money making industry in the united
[6:21] states
[6:22] and it seems that wine tasting has taken
[6:24] on a hobby mentality
[6:26] people taste wine in public settings
[6:29] simply for the fun of intoxication
[6:31] and socialization some may use the
[6:34] excuse of needing to drink wine in order
[6:36] to be at peace while socializing
[6:38] but christians should look to christ who
[6:40] is our peace
[6:42] christians should abstain from this
[6:44] frivolity as we are called to be
[6:46] intoxicated with the holy ghost
[6:48] and not natural wine or strong drink
[6:54] wine can be used in other ways it is
[6:56] noteworthy that paul recommended that
[6:58] timothy
[6:59] use a little wine for his stomach's sake
[7:01] and often infirmities
[7:03] wine can then be used as a medicine in
[7:05] certain cases
[7:06] but great efforts should be made to
[7:08] limit the use
[7:10] in order to avoid a habitual consumption
[7:12] that could lead to addiction
[7:15] while christians should not judge each
[7:17] other about the liberties that they
[7:18] allow
[7:19] we must judge ourselves that we are not
[7:21] causing others to stumble and fall into
[7:23] sin
[7:24] paul is clear that a weak christian can
[7:26] spiritually perish
[7:28] with a defiled conscience through the
[7:30] bad influence of another christian who
[7:32] took his liberty too far
[7:34] and did not consider how his actions
[7:36] would affect another christian
[7:38] in these cases the christian who took
[7:40] his liberty too far not only sinned
[7:42] against the weak christian
[7:44] but also sinned against christ because
[7:46] of this great responsibility that
[7:48] christians have to lead godly lives
[7:50] in front of other christians paul took
[7:52] the attitude
[7:53] that he would not eat meat as long as
[7:55] the world was standing
[7:57] in order that he would not cause another
[7:59] christian to fall into sin
[8:02] each of us must have the same attitude
[8:04] we will abstain from any pleasurable
[8:06] christian liberty
[8:07] for the rest of our lives if we know it
[8:09] may cause the stumbling of weaker
[8:11] christians
[8:15] jewelry while the three examples of
[8:18] liberties above are clearly defined
[8:21] food observing holy days and wine
[8:24] a case can be made for other areas of
[8:26] liberty
[8:27] wearing jewelry seems to be a liberty
[8:29] because the bible provides examples of
[8:31] godly people wearing jewelry ungodly
[8:34] people
[8:35] also wear jewelry so jewelry wearing is
[8:37] not one-sided
[8:40] the bible contains numerous references
[8:42] to jewelry and it is clear that wearing
[8:45] certain types of inexpensive jewelry
[8:47] in moderation is acceptable to our lord
[8:50] four guidelines ensure a believer's
[8:53] jewelry wearing honors god
[8:56] spending little time on jewelry avoiding
[8:59] expensive jewelry
[9:00] wearing few pieces of jewelry and
[9:03] wearing jewelry with a godly message
[9:08] first a christian must spend little time
[9:10] adorning herself with jewelry
[9:12] more emphasis must be placed on her
[9:14] inward adorning
[9:15] than the outward as paul pleaded that
[9:18] women adorn themselves in
[9:19] shame-facedness and sobriety
[9:21] rather than costly array of gold and
[9:24] pearls
[9:25] shamefaciness is not a word we use much
[9:27] today but it means to have a sense of
[9:29] honor
[9:30] and bashfulness reverence and regard for
[9:34] others similarly
[9:36] sobriety means self-control the context
[9:40] of paul's teachings about
[9:41] modest adorning show that women must
[9:43] exhibit self-control on everything
[9:45] they wear our christian sisters must be
[9:48] adorned with an attitude of honor and
[9:50] regard for others
[9:52] especially a regard for men who are
[9:54] often tempted through the lust of the
[9:56] eyes
[9:59] second paul and peter teach that
[10:01] expensive jewelry should be avoided
[10:04] what is valuable in the sight of god and
[10:05] of a great price for christian women
[10:07] is a meek quiet and submissive attitude
[10:11] flaunting wealth is ultimately fleeting
[10:13] prideful
[10:14] and vain in the light of eternity
[10:17] third the amount of jewry worn should be
[10:19] minimal
[10:20] paul teaches sobriety meaning
[10:22] self-control in the greek
[10:24] the haughty prideful daughters of zion
[10:27] lacked
[10:27] sobriety and wore 21 different outward
[10:30] accessories ranging from feet ornaments
[10:33] to bonnets for their heads god assured
[10:36] those women
[10:37] that all their attempts to look
[10:38] beautiful would backfire and their
[10:40] end would be a burning destruction and
[10:42] desolation
[10:44] additionally along with the amount of
[10:46] jewelry worn christians should practice
[10:48] moderation
[10:49] in all things
[10:52] fourth jury must carry a godly message
[10:56] any jewelry with wicked devilish symbols
[10:58] worldly images or
[11:00] foul language does not please god and
[11:02] thus should be avoided at all times
[11:04] whatever we do say or where should
[11:07] glorify our lord and savior jesus christ
[11:10] and whatsoever ye do in word or deed do
[11:13] all in the name of the lord jesus
[11:15] giving thanks to god and the father by
[11:17] him
[11:19] scripture verifies the types of jewry
[11:21] god accepts
[11:22] rings necklaces and bracelets
[11:26] rings christians can wear some rings
[11:28] that are acceptable unto god
[11:30] the biblical pattern for acceptable
[11:32] rings is that they have a meaningful
[11:34] purpose
[11:34] such as in the cases of mordecai joseph
[11:37] and the prodigal son
[11:40] these rings all symbolized authority and
[11:42] were used in sealing official documents
[11:45] mordecai received a signet ring from
[11:47] king ahasuerus
[11:48] when he was given the power and
[11:50] authority of haman's former position
[11:52] joseph son of jacob was given a ring to
[11:54] wear when he was exalted to second
[11:56] in command in egypt even our lord
[11:59] jesus's parable of the prodigal son
[12:01] included a ring being placed upon his
[12:03] finger
[12:04] once he was restored to his family today
[12:07] christians are most likely to wear
[12:09] wedding rings to symbolize their
[12:10] unending vows of marital faithfulness to
[12:13] their spouse
[12:14] wedding rings can be condemned in
[12:16] certain christian circles
[12:17] but there is no scriptural evidence for
[12:19] this idea although scriptures don't
[12:21] specifically support
[12:22] wedding rings the wearing of wedding
[12:24] rings is not forbidden
[12:26] since godly men wore rings with a
[12:28] purpose wedding rings can be categorized
[12:31] as an area of christian liberty because
[12:33] of their purpose as long as they are not
[12:35] excessive or ostentatious
[12:43] nose rings nose rings are becoming more
[12:46] commonplace in american culture
[12:48] the question is are nose rings
[12:50] acceptable according to the bible
[12:52] the answer is no for a couple of reasons
[12:55] first nose rings pierced through the
[12:57] skin and shed blood
[12:58] and the unchanging god never commanded
[13:00] his people to wear jewelry that shed
[13:02] blood
[13:03] left permanent marks on their skin or
[13:05] damage their body in any way
[13:08] the bodies of christians are likened to
[13:09] a holy temple and thus
[13:11] must be treated with reverence and not
[13:13] purposely damaged
[13:15] your body is not your own you are a
[13:17] temple of the holy ghost
[13:19] our god delights in our obedience to
[13:21] honor the bodies he has graciously
[13:23] created
[13:24] god does not teach us to pierce our
[13:25] bodies cause ourselves to bleed
[13:28] or leave permanent marks on our bodies
[13:30] no new testament teaching permits
[13:32] believers to damage their bodies in any
[13:34] way
[13:35] second we do not have two or three
[13:37] witnesses that prove godly people wore
[13:39] nose rings nose jewels are alluded to in
[13:42] only one scripture
[13:44] isaiah 3 verse 21 as mentioned
[13:47] previously this is a negative example of
[13:49] nose jewels
[13:50] because the prideful seductive daughters
[13:52] of zion
[13:53] whose end was destruction and desolation
[13:56] were adorned in 21 different accessories
[13:59] god was not pleased with their vain
[14:01] outward accessories
[14:03] some think genesis 24 47 supports nose
[14:06] rings
[14:07] but we have very little information
[14:08] about this event
[14:10] abraham's servant put an earring upon
[14:12] rebecca's face at the time of her
[14:14] engagement to isaac but god has never
[14:16] asked his obedient people
[14:18] to pierce and permanently scar their
[14:20] bodies
[14:21] putting an earring upon her face was
[14:23] likely accustomed for her engagement
[14:25] this one isolated ambiguous scripture is
[14:28] not evidence for nose rings
[14:30] because the rest of the bible never
[14:31] teaches anyone to wear them
[14:34] necklaces the bible offers support for
[14:37] the wearing of necklaces in moderation
[14:40] joseph and solomon's bride wore
[14:41] necklaces as representations of their
[14:43] authority
[14:44] necklaces were also used symbolically to
[14:46] represent the reward of obedience
[14:49] if children faithfully obey the
[14:51] instructions and laws of their parents
[14:53] the grace of god would be as a chain
[14:55] about their necks
[14:56] therefore necklaces can be categorized
[14:58] as an area of christian liberty as long
[15:00] as they follow the four guidelines
[15:02] listed above
[15:06] bracelets bracelets may be worn in
[15:09] moderation as they were worn by rebecca
[15:11] upon her engagement to isaac
[15:14] god himself in an allegory of his
[15:16] rescuing and adorning of israel
[15:18] put bracelets upon the hands of his
[15:20] bride bracelets are an area of christian
[15:22] liberty
[15:23] as long as they follow the four
[15:24] guidelines listed above
[15:28] earrings earrings should be avoided at
[15:31] all times
[15:32] because the negative witnesses in
[15:33] scripture greatly outweigh the positive
[15:36] out of the 11 biblical texts about
[15:38] earrings seven passages describe their
[15:41] usage
[15:41] in negative terms conversely two
[15:44] scriptural portions
[15:45] use earrings allegorically in positive
[15:48] terms
[15:49] the final two reference earrings in
[15:51] ambiguous terms
[15:53] additionally modern day earrings require
[15:56] piercing
[15:56] bleeding and scarring of the body which
[15:59] god never ordained
[16:00] for his obedient people in genesis 35
[16:04] verses 1 to 4
[16:05] god commanded jacob to return to bethel
[16:08] and build an altar of worship
[16:10] knowing this jacob commanded that his
[16:12] family bury all their idols and earrings
[16:14] under an oak tree in shechem it seems
[16:17] jacob's family
[16:19] had to bury all idols that they
[16:20] worshipped which included false idols
[16:23] and the fashion of wearing earrings
[16:26] before appearing
[16:27] before the living god at the house of
[16:29] god
[16:32] a second negative witness is the
[16:34] israelite's use of earrings after the
[16:36] exodus out of
[16:37] egypt in the absence of moses the
[16:40] backslidden
[16:41] idolatrous israelites broke off their
[16:43] earrings at the command of aaron in
[16:45] order to build the golden calf
[16:47] which god abhorred israel received these
[16:50] earrings from the egyptians during the
[16:52] exodus
[16:53] god's purpose though was not for israel
[16:55] to wear the earrings
[16:56] but to use them to help build the
[16:58] tabernacle in the wilderness
[17:00] later in their exodus journey their
[17:02] armies obtained earrings as spoils of
[17:04] war
[17:05] and they dedicated them to the
[17:06] tabernacle of the lord as an oblation
[17:09] and memorial
[17:10] earrings never became a part of their
[17:12] daily lives
[17:16] a third negative witness involved
[17:18] gideon's interactions with the
[17:19] ishmaelites
[17:20] in judges 8 verses 22 through 27.
[17:24] the ishmaelites possess golden earrings
[17:26] but not israel
[17:28] rather than rule over the ishmaelites
[17:30] gideon requested and received their
[17:32] earrings
[17:33] and formed an ephod that later became an
[17:35] object of idolatry
[17:37] in israel isaiah and hosea
[17:41] record a fourth and fifth negative
[17:43] witness about earrings
[17:45] in both contexts god's two prophets
[17:47] recorded that earrings were a hindrance
[17:49] to women
[17:50] as a source of pride and lustful
[17:52] seduction
[17:53] likewise some women today still use
[17:56] earrings as a tool of pride and
[17:58] seduction
[18:00] exodus 21 verse 6 and deuteronomy 15
[18:03] verse 17
[18:04] provide the sixth and seventh negative
[18:06] witnesses about earrings
[18:08] in these texts you can read about
[18:10] earrings called alls
[18:12] in the king james version alls were
[18:14] permanent earrings given to jewish
[18:16] slaves
[18:17] who purposely rejected freedom and
[18:19] wanted to remain slaves forever
[18:22] the purpose behind the all was to leave
[18:23] a permanent mark on the ears of the
[18:25] jewish slaves
[18:26] so that their choice to be a slave for
[18:28] life would be instantly seen by all
[18:31] these slaves ultimately rejected their
[18:33] god-given inheritance
[18:35] which included the land of their
[18:36] forefathers
[18:38] alls were visible signs of the judgment
[18:40] of god upon unbelieving
[18:42] faithless israelites
[18:46] imagine you lived in the days of moses
[18:48] and saw slaves with awls in their ears
[18:51] the permanent visible alls immediately
[18:54] identified who was enslaved
[18:56] the free israelites would not have worn
[18:58] similar earrings to those of the slaves
[19:00] for god is always distinguished between
[19:02] holy and unholy
[19:04] god is not the author of confusion he
[19:07] ordered every part of jewish life
[19:09] their outer garments and hair length
[19:11] reveal their gender
[19:13] their ears reveal their choice of
[19:14] freedom or slavery
[19:16] the biblical pattern for earrings then
[19:18] shows that jewish slaves and heathens
[19:20] used piercings god's people may have
[19:23] possessed earrings as customary
[19:25] engagement gifts for currency or barter
[19:28] but not for everyday wear
[19:33] christians should not have their ears
[19:35] pierced because piercing does not fit
[19:37] the unchanging character of god
[19:39] use the honor your body guideline no
[19:42] piercing our bodies
[19:43] no deliberately causing ourselves to
[19:45] bleed and no leaving permanent marks on
[19:48] our bodies
[19:49] no new testament teaching allows
[19:51] christians to break the honor your body
[19:53] guideline
[19:56] proverbs 25 verse 12 and ezekiel 16
[19:59] verse 12
[20:00] give two positive allegorical witnesses
[20:03] for earrings
[20:04] proverbs describes a golden earring as
[20:06] representing a wise judge
[20:08] speaking to an obedient listener with
[20:11] the emphasis on the value of hearing
[20:13] wise counsel
[20:14] not on outward adornment in ezekiel god
[20:18] himself said he adorned israel with
[20:19] earrings
[20:20] which represent israel's obedience to
[20:22] god's wise counsel
[20:24] both of these examples are allegorical
[20:26] and not literal
[20:28] in contrast to the seven literal
[20:30] examples of earrings being described
[20:32] in a negative way
[20:37] two other portions of scripture are
[20:38] ambiguous about the use of earrings
[20:40] rebecca's engagement and job's
[20:42] restoration
[20:44] both rebecca and job were given earrings
[20:46] as gifts but we are not told what they
[20:49] did with them
[20:50] it seems rebecca's earrings were given
[20:51] to her as part of an engagement custom
[20:54] and not as an everyday accessory
[20:57] moreover consider that her relatives in
[21:00] the next generation
[21:01] jacob's family were commanded to bury
[21:04] their earrings before presenting
[21:05] themselves before god
[21:06] in his provided place of worship bethel
[21:10] the idea of earrings as an engagement
[21:12] gift and not
[21:13] an everyday accessory also connects back
[21:15] to god's adorning
[21:17] of his engaged spouse israel
[21:23] job received an earring from each of his
[21:24] friends after god restored his health
[21:26] and family
[21:28] in job 42 verse 11. we cannot presume
[21:31] that god wanted job to walk around daily
[21:33] wearing multiple earrings especially
[21:35] since we know the haughty daughters of
[21:37] zion
[21:38] wore 21 different accessories that
[21:40] manifested their prideful
[21:41] lustful hearts furthermore we know god
[21:44] is more interested in the inward
[21:46] adornment than the outward
[21:48] this story of job provides more support
[21:51] that earrings were used by the followers
[21:52] of god
[21:53] as gifts of custom and perhaps for
[21:55] currency and barter
[21:57] rather than for everyday wear makeup
[22:01] not in one scripture does god command
[22:03] any woman or man to wear makeup
[22:05] or paint their face in any way if god
[22:08] wanted his daughters to wear makeup
[22:10] or paint as the king james version
[22:12] describes it
[22:13] he would have told them to do so in his
[22:16] word
[22:16] god's nature and his simple humble
[22:18] design for the physical appearance
[22:21] align his focus is on the inner man
[22:24] while
[22:24] outward beauty is vain god wants us to
[22:27] present our clean
[22:28] natural faces to others because god
[22:30] created our faces
[22:32] and said our entire bodies were
[22:34] fearfully and wonderfully made
[22:36] even marvelous according to the psalmist
[22:39] no makeup can improve or make more
[22:41] beautiful the face that god already
[22:43] created for each of us
[22:45] for thou hast possessed my reigns thou
[22:48] has covered me in my mother's womb
[22:50] i will praise thee for i am fearfully
[22:52] and wonderfully made
[22:54] marvelous are thy works and that my soul
[22:57] knoweth write well
[23:01] these scriptures help women overcome all
[23:03] feelings of insufficiency
[23:05] women don't have to hide behind makeup
[23:07] because christ assures their identity
[23:10] is found in him makeup is a superficial
[23:13] and false covering
[23:14] that god did not intend to be added to
[23:16] his creation
[23:18] it's a shame that advertisers in
[23:20] hollywood have convinced millions
[23:22] that the faces god made for them are not
[23:24] good enough
[23:25] the truth is that your face is best just
[23:28] the way god made it
[23:29] and you can rejoice in the true face god
[23:31] gave you
[23:32] we shouldn't desire a false appearance
[23:35] since the bible says that charity or
[23:37] love
[23:37] rejoices in the truth love doesn't
[23:40] rejoice in a false
[23:42] superficial covering but it does rejoice
[23:44] in a true
[23:45] natural appearance
[23:50] three scriptures teach jewish and
[23:52] christian women to abstain from wearing
[23:54] makeup
[23:55] second kings 9 30 jeremiah 4 verse 30
[23:59] and ezekiel 23 verse 40. the entire rest
[24:03] of the bible can be added to this list
[24:05] because no scriptures command any woman
[24:07] whether godly or ungodly
[24:09] to paint her face or wear any facial
[24:12] cosmetic
[24:14] jezebel wife of ahab painted her face in
[24:17] second
[24:18] kings 9 verse 30. she was likely the
[24:20] most evil woman in the entire bible
[24:23] she murdered god's faithful prophets and
[24:25] by usurping her husband's authority
[24:28] greedily ordered the murder of an
[24:30] innocent man named naboth
[24:33] jezebel devoutly worshiped idols such as
[24:35] baal
[24:36] and practiced whoredoms and witchcraft
[24:42] jezebel is the only woman recorded in
[24:44] the bible as painting her face
[24:46] as the other two examples of women
[24:47] painting their faces were nations
[24:50] depicted
[24:50] as immoral women out of over 440
[24:54] references to the face in the bible
[24:56] only jezebel is named as the one who
[24:58] used facial cosmetics
[25:01] jezebel an idol worshiper was a heathen
[25:04] in the sight of god
[25:05] who commanded israel to learn not the
[25:07] ways of the heathen
[25:09] at the end of her life jezebel's
[25:11] response to the news of jehu's coming
[25:14] was to paint her face in rebellion to
[25:16] the god of israel
[25:17] which led to her swift judgment without
[25:20] a doubt
[25:20] face painting facial cosmetics and
[25:23] makeup are linked to heathenism and
[25:25] idolatry
[25:26] according to jezebel's behavior in the
[25:28] bible and history itself
[25:30] which chapter 6 covers what may come as
[25:33] a surprise is that jesus prophesied
[25:36] that the same spirit of jezebel would
[25:38] return and seduce christians in the new
[25:40] testament dispensation
[25:42] we must be cautious of women in the
[25:44] christian church who act like jezebel
[25:46] by usurping authority over men silencing
[25:49] the voices of true preachers
[25:52] acting greedily and seducing followers
[25:54] into idolatry
[25:56] and even painting their faces with
[25:58] makeup
[26:03] through a simple study of famous modern
[26:05] televangelists
[26:06] we can quickly find examples of women
[26:08] who preach wear makeup
[26:10] emphasize money and prosperity and allow
[26:13] their followers to participate in sinful
[26:15] idolatrous indulgences if you currently
[26:18] follow a woman with a jezebel spirit
[26:21] repent and cry out to god for his
[26:23] leadership in finding a true church
[26:25] that possesses the spirit of god when
[26:28] the spirit of elijah found himself
[26:29] threatened by the wicked jezebel
[26:31] he ran into the wilderness was fed by
[26:33] god and was made aware of the seven
[26:36] thousand other believers who had not
[26:39] bowed down to the jezebel religion
[26:41] if you see god crying out to him he will
[26:44] lead you to other believers who want to
[26:46] worship christ
[26:47] in spirit and in truth
[26:51] the next scriptural witness jeremiah 4
[26:53] verse 30
[26:54] shows god speaking through the prophet
[26:56] jeremiah to all of israel
[26:58] around 600 bc the lord gave the
[27:01] following message to israel at the time
[27:03] of one of the punishments for committing
[27:05] wickedness and rebellion against him
[27:08] and when thou art spoiled what will thou
[27:10] do though thou closeth thyself with
[27:13] crimson
[27:14] though thou decast thee with ornaments
[27:16] of gold
[27:17] though thou rentest thy face with
[27:19] painting in vain
[27:20] shalt thou make thyself fair thy lovers
[27:23] will despise thee
[27:24] they will seek thy life this scripture
[27:27] shows that it is vanity to wear
[27:29] expensive clothing
[27:30] and use makeup peter presents a similar
[27:33] message in the new testament
[27:35] saying a woman's inner beauty and
[27:37] spiritual dormant
[27:38] of a meek and quiet spirit is a great
[27:40] value in god's sight
[27:43] jeremiah 4 is a picture of god issuing a
[27:46] sentence of destruction
[27:47] upon judah and jerusalem through
[27:49] horsemen and bowmen
[27:52] though not a final destruction israel is
[27:54] being punished for their evil doings
[27:56] bitter wickedness rebellion and
[27:58] foolishness
[28:00] god then speaks in verse 30 that
[28:02] israel's lovers
[28:03] will despise her and seek to kill her
[28:05] despite her efforts to wear expensive
[28:07] clothing
[28:08] ornaments and have a painted face notice
[28:11] that israel was not painting her face to
[28:13] please god
[28:14] for god never asked any woman to wear
[28:16] facial cosmetics
[28:18] israel was painting her face to please
[28:20] her idols and the nations that taught
[28:22] her their heathen ways
[28:24] sadly god's people then were doing the
[28:26] same thing jezebel did a few hundred
[28:28] years
[28:29] earlier painting their faces in the day
[28:31] of their destruction
[28:36] the last scripture about makeup is found
[28:38] in ezekiel 23 verse 40
[28:40] which was probably spoken near the same
[28:42] time as jeremiah spoke his prophecy of
[28:44] destruction
[28:46] ezekiel's audience was most likely jews
[28:48] in babylon
[28:49] due to their exile from the promised
[28:51] land the entire chapter of ezekiel 23
[28:54] portrays
[28:54] israel as an adulterous woman who lusts
[28:57] after the gods of other nations
[28:59] such as egypt and assyria in verses
[29:02] 40 and 41 and 43 and 44
[29:05] ezekiel says and furthermore that ye
[29:08] have sent for men to come from
[29:10] far unto whom a messenger was sent and
[29:13] lo they came
[29:14] for whom thou didst wash thyself
[29:16] painteth thy
[29:17] eyes and decast thyself with ornaments
[29:21] and satisf upon a stately bed and a
[29:23] table prepared before it
[29:25] whereupon thou has set mine incense and
[29:27] mine oil
[29:29] then said i unto her that was old and
[29:31] adulteries
[29:32] will they now commit whoredoms with her
[29:34] and she with them
[29:35] yet they went in unto her as they go in
[29:38] unto a woman that plath the harlot
[29:40] so when they in unto a hola and unto
[29:44] aholaba the lewd women
[29:49] god likens israel unto a woman who is
[29:51] receiving her adulterous lovers
[29:53] and gives details on how she prepares
[29:55] for her lovers
[29:56] she washes herself paints her eyes or
[29:59] puts on makeup
[30:00] then puts on ornaments and sits on a bed
[30:02] near a table prepared for a meal
[30:04] this immoral idolatrous woman was going
[30:07] to lure her
[30:08] lover with all the fleshly lusts
[30:10] including his appetite
[30:12] a decorated bed and the visual seduction
[30:15] of makeup
[30:19] based upon these three scriptures second
[30:21] kings 9 30
[30:22] jeremiah 4 30 and ezekiel 23 verse 40
[30:27] god's word is against the use of makeup
[30:29] and facial cosmetics
[30:30] the entire rest of the bible does not
[30:32] offer even one hint
[30:34] of god requesting facial cosmetics upon
[30:37] any man or woman
[30:38] what god does want on her faces is his
[30:41] glory
[30:42] the anointing of the holy spirit the
[30:44] bible says we behold his glory and
[30:46] become
[30:46] changed into his image from glory to
[30:49] glory
[30:50] by the spirit of the lord think of how
[30:52] much more spiritual glory could be
[30:54] presented to this lost and dying world
[30:56] if believers spent more time praying and
[30:58] seeking god
[30:59] for the salvation of souls rather than
[31:01] painting a false face
[31:03] upon their countenances let the glory of
[31:06] jesus christ be upon your face instead
[31:08] of makeup
[31:09] but we all with open face beholding as
[31:12] in a glass
[31:13] the glory of the lord are changed into
[31:16] the same image
[31:17] from glory to glory even as by the
[31:20] spirit of the lord
[31:25] numerous people have erroneously told me
[31:27] that esther wore makeup
[31:29] but there is absolutely no scriptural
[31:30] support for this belief
[31:32] the bible never says esther painted her
[31:34] face as it says for jezebel and twice
[31:37] for israel
[31:38] in allegories scripturally esther was
[31:41] purified using oils
[31:43] not face painting esther 2 verse 9
[31:46] and chapter 2 verse 12 declare she was
[31:49] given
[31:50] things for purification which were oils
[31:53] of myrrh
[31:54] and sweet odors esther was most likely
[31:57] given
[31:58] moisturizing oils for topical skin care
[32:01] perhaps esther's lack of makeup was the
[32:03] distinguishing characteristic
[32:05] that attracted the king to her inner
[32:07] beauty
[32:08] please do not be deceived by the gross
[32:10] misunderstanding among churches
[32:11] concerning esther
[32:13] as scripture never states that she used
[32:15] makeup to pain her face
[32:17] do not be influenced by those who add to
[32:19] the words of god
[32:20] for they should be found liars keep
[32:23] god's commandments
[32:24] and live he taught me also and said unto
[32:27] me
[32:28] let thine heart retain my words keep my
[32:31] commandments
[32:32] and live
[32:35] tattoos during my college days i was
[32:38] greatly tempted to get a tattoo
[32:40] i had already repented of my sins and
[32:42] was serving the lord jesus
[32:43] but not with the knowledge or zeal that
[32:45] i have today many of my college friends
[32:48] were getting tattoos
[32:49] and i wanted one that said jesus above a
[32:52] cross
[32:52] and the words my refuge under the cross
[32:56] i was torn about the final decision as
[32:58] i'd felt a conviction to refrain from
[33:00] marking my body
[33:02] so i decided to call my mother's pastor
[33:04] and his wife
[33:05] and they pointed me to leviticus 19 28
[33:09] after opening my bible and reading this
[33:11] for myself the question was settled
[33:13] no tattoo for me in leviticus 19 verse
[33:17] 28 the lord told moses
[33:19] you shall not make any cuttings in your
[33:21] flesh for the dead
[33:22] nor print any marks upon you i am the
[33:25] lord
[33:26] based upon this scripture tattoos are
[33:28] forbidden for jews and christians
[33:30] furthermore tattoos are never commanded
[33:32] nor approved of
[33:33] in the new testament the pattern of our
[33:36] holy god
[33:37] is the honor your body guideline that
[33:40] humans
[33:40] not pierce mark or cut their bodies in
[33:43] any way
[33:44] as tattoos permanently mark the skin
[33:50] the bible gives multiple examples of
[33:51] heathens who cut their own bodies due to
[33:53] demon possession
[33:55] first the prophets of baal cut
[33:57] themselves to no avail
[33:58] in the days of the prophet elijah
[34:01] thinking that their false gods would
[34:02] hear their requests
[34:04] second the maniac of gadara who is
[34:06] possessed with a legion of demons
[34:08] cut himself with stones when a person
[34:11] willfully cuts or mutilates
[34:13] his or her own body is a clear sign of
[34:16] demonic
[34:17] activity and the individual must repent
[34:19] and seek deliverance
[34:20] through the power of the blood of jesus
[34:23] christ
[34:27] christians who already have tattoos and
[34:29] feel the conviction of their mistake
[34:31] should first repent and vow never to get
[34:33] another marking
[34:34] on their body believers should not feel
[34:37] pressure to pay lots of money to remove
[34:39] their tattoos though
[34:40] as god is quick to forgive and ready to
[34:43] pardon confess
[34:44] sin instead the believer should try to
[34:46] cover up their tattoos
[34:48] especially if the images or words are
[34:50] immoral
[34:55] high heels there are multiple reasons
[34:58] why high heels should not be worn by
[35:00] christians and jews
[35:02] first scripture eludes to the haughty
[35:04] prideful and seductive daughters of zion
[35:07] wearing high heel-like shoes in isaiah 3
[35:09] verse 16.
[35:11] moreover the lord saith because the
[35:13] daughters of zion are haughty and
[35:16] walk with stretch forth necks and went
[35:18] in eyes
[35:20] walking and mincing as they go and
[35:22] making a tinkling with their feet
[35:25] these judgment-bound women were mincing
[35:27] or taking short steps
[35:29] high heels naturally limit the length of
[35:31] each step
[35:32] a tinkling noise as they walked sounds
[35:35] very similar to the noise made when
[35:36] walking in high heels
[35:38] notice that their necks were also
[35:40] stretched out which would be a result of
[35:42] wearing these unnatural
[35:44] footwear
[35:47] second scientific evidence supports both
[35:50] the damaging physical effects
[35:52] that wearing high heels have upon people
[35:54] and also the sexual effects
[35:56] that high heels have upon the opposite
[35:58] sex a research article from 2014
[36:02] stated that high heels put excess stress
[36:04] upon the foot bones
[36:06] and ultimately damage the
[36:07] musculoskeletal system
[36:10] while preparing to write about high
[36:11] heels i spoke with a licensed podiatrist
[36:14] about the effects of high heels this
[36:17] doctor stated that high heels are the
[36:19] absolute worst shoe
[36:20] a human being could ever wear due to the
[36:23] damaging effects that they have upon a
[36:25] person's entire
[36:26] body he stated that during his training
[36:29] multiple textbooks
[36:30] stated the fact that high heels never
[36:32] help the human body
[36:33] they only damage it
[36:37] christians are alarmed at any activity
[36:39] that damages their bodies
[36:41] which are the temples of the holy ghost
[36:43] believers do not belong to themselves
[36:45] but are the purchased property of jesus
[36:48] christ and therefore should not
[36:49] purposely prop up their bodies in a way
[36:52] that will lead to musculoskeletal damage
[36:55] later on in life
[36:58] third wearing high heels cannot be
[37:00] considered modest because they draw
[37:02] sexual attention to the wear and lead
[37:05] others to harbor
[37:06] lustful thoughts of fornication or
[37:09] adultery
[37:11] a 2017 study suggested that men
[37:15] are more attracted to women in high
[37:16] heels due to the lumbar curvature that
[37:19] high heels produce
[37:21] high heels must be the attire of harlots
[37:23] as spoken in the proverbs
[37:26] since they incite sexual lust
[37:29] jesus said those with unconfessed lust
[37:32] whether committed in the flesh or mind
[37:34] will be guilty of adultery
[37:37] finally recall that there is really
[37:39] nothing new under the sun
[37:41] high heels cannot be a new design in the
[37:43] 21st century
[37:44] that the world has never seen before
[37:47] rather
[37:47] high heels are revival of an older
[37:50] rebellious
[37:51] and seductive act
[37:54] conclusion christian liberties allow
[37:56] believers to respectfully express their
[37:58] own preferences
[38:00] without being disobedient to god and
[38:02] without being under the condemnation of
[38:03] the devil
[38:04] a greater responsibility goes with this
[38:06] liberty and christians must consistently
[38:08] examine their choices to be sure
[38:11] they are influencing other believers in
[38:13] a way that builds their faith
[38:14] rather than destroying it
[38:18] wearing simple inexpensive and
[38:20] meaningful jewelry
[38:21] is a liberty for christians jewelry worn
[38:24] in moderation will not cause genuine
[38:26] christians to become prideful
[38:27] but will serve as an expression of their
[38:29] faith or a sign of their marriage vows
[38:35] while jewry has some biblical support
[38:37] and offers some room for outward
[38:38] expression
[38:39] makeup tattoos and high heels are
[38:42] vividly described as sinful acts in the
[38:44] word of god
[38:45] and therefore should be avoided by all
[38:47] christians there is no liberty to sin in
[38:50] christianity
[38:51] romans 6 verses 1 and 2 states what
[38:54] shall we say then
[38:55] shall we continue in sin that grace may
[38:57] abound god forbid how shall we that are
[39:00] dead to sin
[39:02] live any longer therein
