TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] don't watch the messenger God will take it away from you he'll share his glory as nobody said William brandham is our Lord baptizing in the name of William brandham that is a horrible disgraceful ungodly lie of the devil I am your brother now remember I am not Jesus Christ I am your brother a sinner saved by grace I'm like you are greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to declare that the name of the Lord Jesus Christ is the only way to baptize in water and the name William Mariam brandham should never be used to baptize any believer in Jesus Christ nor the titles father son Holy Ghost should not be used in water baptism I want to thank the brother from Uganda who shared with me that this might be a helpful video to make and that people could be benefited from hearing quotes from Brother brandham himself and also scriptures that would help the Saints to know that the name of the Lord Jesus Christ is The Only Name That should be used in water baptism now of course this may be obvious to many of us in the modernized and industrialized nations but it seems to me that this Brothers Nation Uganda has numerous message churches that have not heard all the sermons of brother brandham have not heard all the quotes from brother brandham and therefore they're not aware that brother brandham openly condemned anyone who would baptize in his name and then would also warn people to not baptize in the titles Father Son and Holy Ghost so let's begin with the scripture and then we'll look at five quotes from Brother Bram here's a chart from my 2021 book called The 12 New Testament Mysteries that shows the Lord Jesus Christ baptism is the correct baptism it's the baptism that the apostles use in the book of Acts in Acts 238 acts 8:16 acts 10:48 acts 195 and Acts 22:16 and remember 10 days after Jesus told the disciples to baptize in the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost Peter and the apostles baptized 3,000 souls in the name of Jesus Christ and of course we know this must have been the Lord Jesus Christ for that is the full name of God's revelation of God manifest In the Flesh now here's a scripture that helped the brother from Uganda first Ians 1: 12-15 Paul says now this I say that every one of you saith I am of Paul I am of Apollos and I have sephus and I have Christ is Christ divided was Paul crucified for you or were you baptized in the name of Paul I thank God that I baptize none of you but Crispus and gas lest any should say that i' baptize in my own name this is a very important scripture to show that Believers in this book of Acts Church were being tempted to be baptized in a different name other than the Savior the Lord Jesus Christ notice Paul says in verse 13 you should be baptized in the name of the one that was crucified for you and that was the Lord Jesus Christ Paul was not crucified for us William brandham was not crucified for us nor was Martin Luther or John Wesley only the Lord Jesus Christ was crucified for our sins and therefore baptism should only be done in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ but notice Satan is right there around the True Believers trying to deceive them with his Antichrist spirit and he's trying to deceive them to be baptized in a different name other than the Lord Jesus Christ and remember this is a regular occurrence in scripture where Satan is trying to deceive people into worshiping the creation rather than the Creator like Nebuchadnezzar idolized Daniel in Daniel 2 verse 46 Nebuchadnezzar was going to make offerings in Daniel's honor which was of course idolatry remember also John the Baptist was mistaken for the the Christ in Luke 3:15-16 Paul and Barnabas were called gods and were going to be worshiped in Acts 14:11 but they stopped it and then here as we just read Paul was thankful he baptized none of the Corinthians because they would have said he baptized them in Paul's name or his own name so this shows us that Satan is always around the Believers trying to deceive them trying to get the focus off of the Lord Jesus Christ but the True Believers cannot be deceived the elect cannot be deceived and then God Will Call some elect out of those who are deceived so that they will not be deceived anymore next I want to play a quote where brother brandom said God will take the messenger away from you if you pay attention to the messenger more than the message and this is from an absolute 1963 January 27th and I believe this is why God took brother brandom off the scene at such a young age but I don't know but this is the quote that makes me think that too many people around brother brandom idolized him rather than focusing on the Lord Jesus Christ the Bible the Holy Ghost the bible-based message the end time message that God sent to us let's listen to the quote if you haven't got that absolute now get it if you'd like to have that absolute that Assurance in your heart of the Holy Spirit raise your hand say I want something out of punctual weight the word of God I see the word of God made manifest amen God bless you it's all over the building thank you I'm only telling you the truth friend don't let it pass by again I'm not claiming I'm nothing I'm your brother don't you pay attention to a messenger you watch the message don't watch the messenger God will take it away from you he'll share his glory as nobody right glory to God don't you watch the messenger watch the message here's a second quote now this is a long quote I think it's over 9 minutes is from Revelation 5 part 1 1961 in this quote brother random condemns anyone that would call him the Lord Jesus Christ or try to baptize in the name of William brandham notice here's all the names brother brandham called this evil spirit brother Bram called it Antichrist horrible disgraceful and ungodly lie of the devil he called it the devil's gutter pipe to baptize in the name of William brandham or to say that William brandham is Jesus Christ he also called this evil spirit a yellow and black serpent he called it a spirit and then brother Ram said thus sayi the lord it's an heir to say that William brandham is Jesus Christ he said it's falsely it's wrong have nothing to do with it this lying evil spirit that would tell you to baptize in the name of William brandham let's listen to the quote if there's anything that has been in my heart to do was to hear those words of our our lord Jesus at the end of this journey to say it was well done my good and faithful servant and many times I have said I'd like to have been standing there when he said come unto me but I did desire to hear it say Well done that I did not hear the voice in the original say come unto me back in the times of the writing of the Bible but but I do desire to hear it say Well done and if anything I always wanted to be and desires of my heart to be was a true servant to Jesus Christ my Lord and Savior I want my testimony to be clean clearcut that I stood in all my mistakes I yet loved him with all my heart and I do that to morning with all my heart and because of that it forces me to say I'm leaving the ministry uh is because that there is something arose up amongst the people that's cause me to do it that is that I have been taken from my bracket of a minister or a brother and being called Jesus Christ and so uh call and that would bring me as an antichrist and I'll meet God as a quitter before I would meet him as an antichrist to take away from him uh I heard of it a few years ago and I thought it was a joke and I met a couple of Brethren which I don't see neither one of them in the meeting this morning two or three of them one time in a fishing trip and they approached me by the subject of saying brother brandham aren't you the anointed Messiah the Christ and I put my arms around the neck of both Brethren or all of them and I said Brethren as much as I have tried to be a true servant of Christ I would not that you would say such a thing as that and if it would ever be said of me then I will leave the field with a clear conscience and you who do that will be responsible for every soul that I would have saved during that time see for taking me from the field and I thought that ended it and I heard it a few more times but it wasn't so and the other day in Canada a brother showed me a little ticket of a thing he's packed in his pocket said William brandham is our Lord baptizing in the name of William brandom and a little a precious it been an enemy if it had been my enemy I would have know it was a joke but a precious darling brother come up to confess his sins and his wrongs and says faith in me as being Jesus Christ and I have got letters at home and calls from Chicago and different places asking me if I believe that Dogma now I got all kinds of letters that's come in the last few days and call some different places so uh uh saying that I was Christ Brethren that is a horrible disgraceful ungodly lie of the devil I am your brother now that would run any person from the field that would make anyone that loves Christ run from the very thing I went to the Lord here not long ago when I first heard it about a year ago and then I went to the Lord and He referred to me to the scripture that when John came forth of preaching that they hadn't had a prophet on the earth for so many years until it would uh they was All Amazed in their hearts thinking maybe John was the Messiah so then I John they went and asked him and he said that he was not you read that Luke the third chapter 15th verse and so then but that kind of quietened down so I let it go like that but then when it come to this then I know that something must be done now I say this that the visions and the angel of the Lord that appeared at the river if this is to be my last message or last thing to the Church of the world those things are truth as far as the angel of the Lord and I Stood Still if people call me a Prophet many times because a prophet in the English Testament is just a preacher a prophesier foreteller of the word and so forth I'd stand for that because you could just kind of push that down but when it comes to be calling anointed Christ or something that was too much for me so I just couldn't stand that and so then about I come after leaving the meeting at Canada I found out the way up in the eskimos or the Indians up there it got among them and so it just tore me all up in the hunt and trip that I had planned so long I could not take it I was afraid of a hunting accident if you understand what I mean I got so shaky worse than I am standing here now and I just couldn't stand it any longer to think that 31 years of ministry went down the devil's gutter pipe into the when I'm gone what will it say there he is that's exactly what it was all the influence that had upon the people then you see where it be I'd be an antichrist and I just couldn't stand it I thought I'd rather die here in the woods like I fell on my gun or something and and I seen I was then I thought about my little Joseph and so forth that had to be raised and I was no condition to hunt so I just left the woods and come home and I've been before about 8 or 10 days in such a fix I I thought I was losing my mind and I just asked everybody to stay away from me and let me alone C I'm in such a fix and nervous and upset and all tore to pieces and I wondered if it would have been some enemy in mine it would have been all right but I would just laugh at it and went on but when it come to be precious Brothers precious sisters then that's what hurt me and I said Lord the great things too great for me I'll just have to walk out and leave it in your hands I I don't know nothing else to do a few nights ago to make it sure I I had a a visitation from the Lord and I seen a precious one a baby a serpent which was yellow and black and telling me and right along and and the thing struck me on the leg but the blood was so rich it didn't take effect on me and I looked down there's where been bit before and I turned quickly with a gun and shot this the thing and it hid it right in the middle of the thing and a brother said I turned with my gun to shoot its head off and he said don't do that just pick up the stick L thereby you want to turn my back to pick up the stick it wiggled into some water just a small puddle of water I said Well it can't hurt very much longer now because I believe the brother realizes the Brethren that what would happen I said it'll it's morally wounded so it'll die and I asked many of my members of my church here in this Tabernacle with brother NE when I come approaching me with that same question brothers sisters haven't I tried to be a true servant of Christ before you have not I tried to be your brother orever it is it's a spirit on precious people many people has asked me that but it's it's a spirit but I hope that the day that it receives a deadly wound and will die out quickly so I can return back to the ministry until then I'll ask you each one pray for me I don't know what I'll do got place up for sale I just can't stand I I I st around I'll go completely Stark mad and I I ask you to pray for me and remember if you've ever believe me if youve ever believed me to be a servant of Christ remember that is an eror it's falsely thus sayith the Lord it is wrong have nothing to do with it I am your brother let us bow our heads and the next quote is from a true sign that's overlooked 1961 brother Ram said thus sayi the Lord the father son Holy Ghost baptism is wrong and He commands the people to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ as as the true baptism he never commanded anyone to baptize in the name of William Brenham that's blasphemy that's heresy that's an evil spirit that's an antichrist Spirit we only baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ let's listen to the quote and now that same group after the death of Paul they finally formed out that bunch of Bishops and high UPS to the dasan council and that formed the Catholic church that's getting away from the word of God there come in your father son Holy Ghost I anybody anywhere any Nation to disprove it amen amen amen thus sayith the Lord amen hallelujah hallelujah the baptism using the title of father son Holy Ghost is false thus sayth the Lord amen amen I command every one of you on here on tape that hasn't been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ be baptized again in the name of Jesus Christ amen Paul in Acts 59 or 195 said have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe and said we know not where it be any Holy Ghost said then what was you baptized amen they said we've been baptized but not in Christian baptism Father Son and Holy Ghost is not Christian baptism amen no Christian was ever baptized like that in the Bible amen or for hundreds of years after to the Bible it's a Catholic Creed and not a Christian doctrine show me in the Bible amen it's a it's a fraud it's a working of devils amen I don't mean to say the people it's baptized like that or that way God's got a many person out there today that don't know no better but the hour has come we've got to get back to the word if we expect God to work in this day like he did then next quote from greater than Solomon is here now 1964 brother Ram plainly said I am not Jesus Christ I'm your brother a sinner saved by grace Jesus Christ never sinned Jesus Christ was sinless he became sin but he never sinned so clearly brother Ram said I am not Jesus Christ just like John the Baptist said I am not the Christ brother random had scriptures he fulfilled just like John the Baptist had scriptures he fulfilled but neither John the Baptist nor William brandham was Jesus Christ let's listen to the quote now remember I am not Jesus Christ I am your brother a sinner saved by grace I'm like you are but it's Jesus Christ the holy spirit that Shar with us keeping his word he don't have to do this he but he promised he would do it Jesus didn't have to heal the sick but the Bible said he did it that it might be fulfilled which was promised of him in the next quote brother Ram said there is not any other way to be baptized than the Lord Jesus Christ baptism in scripture and we must do everything by the scripture so the scripture never says to baptized in the name of Paul or Apollos or William brandham or anyone else the Lord Jesus Christ is the only scripture used for baptism let's listen to the quote but the whole thing has been wound up why there's only one God and his name is Jesus Christ and is's not another name under heav God hallelujah there's not one text of scripture nowhere in the Bible where anybody was ever baptized in any other way but in the name of Jesus Christ not one time was any other the new church or the Church of Jesus Christ ever sprinkled poured or anything else not one time was ever a ceremony used I baptized in the name of the father son Holy Ghost it's Creeds and things the final quote is from going beyond the camp 1964 brother Ram said woe to them baptized differently than the Lord Jesus Christ so we can apply that to the father son Holy Ghost if the people know better if they don't know better God doesn't hold that against them and also a woe to them that would baptize in the name of William brandham because William brandham was not crucified for us the Lord Jesus Christ was crucified for us let's listen to the quote there's not one scripture in the Bible where anybody was ever baptized in any other way but in the name of Jesus Christ right the commission of Father Son and Holy Ghost is only go ye therefore teach All Nations baptizing them in the name of the father son Holy Ghost not him not call this title over him but baptize him in the name of the father son Holy Ghost which is the Lord Jesus Christ everybody in the Bible was baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and the Bible said whosoever shall take one word out of it or add one word to it in any wayto them so I have enough I have to fear about besides adding something or taking it from the scripture it's got me in trouble many times but I stay right there he is my defense it's caused me to separate from a many friend they parted from me because of that but just as long as I keep this friend here the Lord Jesus and he is the word no matter rugged be the path hard is the way he come the same way and if they call the Master of the House be elub how much more will they call those of his disciples in closing friends I hope this video was a blessing I'm thankful to the brother from Uganda for sharing this topic with me you know here in America where I live in Ohio I don't know of any churches that baptize in the name of William brandom praise God for that baptism should only be done in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ but where this brother lives in Uganda apparently there's numerous churches that are deceived by Satan and are baptizing in the name of William brandom so let's pray for those churches that they'll repent maybe God will use this video or the teachings and quotes on this video to help those people come out of their idolatry their Antichrist system so I'll pray for them now father God in the name of Jesus Christ I pray Lord that your great holy spirit will go out to these people who are deceived and set them free through the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah the crucified one the Lord Jesus Christ may this brother who has the burden for these deceived ones may you anoint him to go preach it to them or share it with them somehow and Lord I know all your elect will be set free so we thank you for for that help us to be a voice against these evil spirits and help us to be a voice for the truth the true water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we ask all this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your [Music] heart
