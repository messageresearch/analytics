[0:00] [Music]
[0:03] I I dreamed about a month after that
[0:05] that I was standing one day and I was
[0:07] watching the great uh a time that not
[0:11] the Judgment now I don't believe the
[0:13] church ever comes to the I mean the
[0:15] bride goes to a judgment but I was there
[0:18] when the crowns was being given
[0:20] out greetings friends in the matchless
[0:23] name of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[0:25] purpose of this video is to answer a
[0:27] viewer's question about the Judgment
[0:28] seat of Christ so by the grace of God
[0:31] we'll do that with the Holy scriptures
[0:32] and of course quotations from God's
[0:35] Prophet William Mariam brandham hi
[0:37] friends I'm Jesse Smith pastor bride of
[0:39] Christ Fellowship here in akan Ohio USA
[0:42] and I defend the original Gospel of the
[0:44] Lord Jesus Christ that he revealed to St
[0:46] Paul then had to restore through Martin
[0:48] Luther John Wesley and the late Prophet
[0:50] William Miriam brandham so let's start
[0:52] with the viewer's question I'll read it
[0:53] for you it says brother I've looked
[0:55] through all your videos I was looking
[0:57] for the Judgment seat of Christ I don't
[0:59] fully understand it
[1:00] it seems contradictory on one hand we
[1:02] have been redeemed and washed Etc and
[1:05] then on the other hand we have to give
[1:06] an account of Deeds Done in the body
[1:09] it's like two puzzle pieces that won't
[1:11] click into place for me do you have a
[1:13] video on it or can you make one it would
[1:16] be much appreciated I need peace about
[1:17] it I've heard several interpretations on
[1:19] it but I don't have a grasp on it thank
[1:22] you this is a wonderful question and I
[1:25] don't have any videos on it that are
[1:27] extensively or exclusively just a about
[1:30] this topic so that's why I appreciated
[1:32] this question and I'll do my best here
[1:34] to teach on the Judgment seat of Christ
[1:37] I'll begin with a few scriptures here
[1:39] let's start off with Romans 1410
[1:42] through1 13 St Paul's talking about
[1:45] Christian Liberties and how we are not
[1:46] to judge Believers as long as they're
[1:49] living in a way that doesn't break the
[1:51] word of God or cause them to sin in
[1:53] verse 10 of Romans 14 it says but why
[1:56] Dost thou judge thy brother or why Dost
[1:58] thou said it not thy brother for we
[2:00] shall all stand before the Judgment seat
[2:02] of Christ for it is written as I live
[2:04] sayith the Lord every knee shall bow to
[2:06] me and every tongue shall confess to God
[2:08] so then every one of us shall give
[2:11] account of himself to God let us not
[2:14] therefore judge one another anymore but
[2:15] judge this rather that no man put a
[2:17] stumbling block or an occasion to fall
[2:19] in his brother's way so the first verse
[2:22] we have tells us that we should not
[2:24] judge our brother or sister because each
[2:26] one of us have to give an account of
[2:29] ourselves to God and notice we shall all
[2:31] stand before the Judgment seat of Christ
[2:34] so it's clear everyone will stand before
[2:35] Christ to be judged by him to give an
[2:38] account of ourselves to God so we all
[2:42] stand individually before the Lord Jesus
[2:45] Christ to give an account of ourselves
[2:47] and even as a preacher when the
[2:49] preachers stand before the Lord
[2:51] according to Hebrews 13:17 the Bible
[2:53] says to obey them that have the rule
[2:55] over you and submit yourselves for they
[2:56] watch over your souls as they that must
[2:59] give account account so every individual
[3:01] gives an account of themselves before
[3:03] God and then the preachers have to give
[3:05] an account of their churches and the
[3:07] Bible says that they may do it with joy
[3:10] and not with grief for that is
[3:12] unprofitable for you so this verse
[3:14] inspires both preachers and every member
[3:17] of the body of Christ non- preachers to
[3:20] live a Godly life because the preachers
[3:22] will give an account of their
[3:24] congregation as a witness or a testimony
[3:27] either with Joy about the members or
[3:29] with grief so we can see all of us stand
[3:32] before the Judgment seat of Christ but
[3:33] it's in a different order we see this
[3:36] because the resurrections are in a
[3:37] different order there's two
[3:39] resurrections there's the first
[3:41] resurrection which is the rapture and
[3:43] then there's the second Resurrection
[3:44] which is the resurrection unto the white
[3:46] Throne judgment so let's read that it's
[3:48] 1 Corinthians 1522 and 23 for as in Adam
[3:52] all die even so in Christ shall all be
[3:54] made alive but every man in his own
[3:57] order Christ the first fruits afterwards
[4:00] they that are Christ at his coming so I
[4:02] want to show this visual
[4:04] here this shows the two resurrections
[4:07] you have the first resurrection which is
[4:08] at the Rapture the pre-tribulation
[4:11] Rapture according to John 5:24
[4:13] Revelation 20 4-6 1 Thessalonians
[4:17] 4:16-17 this is the resurrection for the
[4:20] living and dead wise virgin Christians
[4:23] and it's the resurrection unto life this
[4:26] is a small Resurrection in comparison to
[4:28] the second Resurrection Resurrection
[4:30] which is for all the unbelievers and the
[4:32] foolish virgin
[4:33] Christians this is the resurrection unto
[4:36] the white Throne judgment according to
[4:38] John 5:28-29 Matthew 25
[4:42] 31-46 and Revelation 20: 11 through 15
[4:46] and I do have a video about this it's
[4:48] called two resurrections for two kinds
[4:50] of Christians I'll leave a link to that
[4:53] in the description by the grace of
[4:55] God now let's look at the next verse 2
[4:58] Corinthians 59-11
[5:00] wherefore we labor that whether present
[5:01] or absent we may be accepted of him for
[5:04] we must all appear before the Judgment
[5:06] seat of Christ that everyone may receive
[5:08] the things done in his body according to
[5:10] that he hath done whether it be good or
[5:13] bad so to encourage the viewer who have
[5:15] this question we are judged for the good
[5:18] that we've done all of our bad is
[5:20] Forgiven as we'll see in some future
[5:23] scriptures here so the Judgment seat of
[5:25] Christ for the Holy Ghost filed
[5:26] Christian it's the time to receive the
[5:28] reward for for the good we have done so
[5:31] it's the judgment to get the reward for
[5:34] serving the lord Jesus Christ and of
[5:37] course that's not why we serve God to
[5:38] get rewards we serve God for the
[5:41] gratitude that we have because he saved
[5:43] us from our sins by his amazing grace
[5:45] through the blood of Jesus Christ I love
[5:48] these words of the Lord Jesus Christ
[5:50] brother brand quoted these often John
[5:51] 5:24 verily verily I say unto you he
[5:54] that heareth my word and believeth on
[5:56] him that has sent me hath everlasting
[5:58] life and shall not come come into
[6:00] condemnation but has passed from Death
[6:03] unto
[6:04] life so this verse tells us when we
[6:07] stand before the Judgment seat of Christ
[6:09] as Believers it's not judgment into
[6:11] condemnation it's judgment into reward
[6:14] so every Born Again Holy Ghost filed
[6:16] Christian can Rejoice they've already
[6:18] passed from condemnation they've already
[6:21] passed from Death unto life they will
[6:24] not come into the condemnation we get
[6:27] more of this truth in Romans 8
[6:30] 32-35 he that spared not his son but
[6:32] delivered him up for us all how shall he
[6:35] not with him also freely give us all
[6:37] things who shall lay anything to the
[6:40] charge of God's elect it is God that
[6:43] justifieth so the Bible's plain God
[6:45] justifies us he declares us righteous as
[6:48] we wish to be according to the Greek and
[6:51] so God doesn't lay any charge to his
[6:53] elect his chosen his called so when we
[6:56] stand before the Judgment seat of Christ
[6:58] it's not to be charged with any wrong
[7:01] it's to be judged and assessed for
[7:04] reward I love verse 34 it says who is he
[7:07] that condemneth so again we see that
[7:09] same type of word condemn no
[7:11] condemnation to Christians verse 34 said
[7:14] who is he that condem it is Christ that
[7:17] died ye rather that is risen again who
[7:19] is even at the right hand of God who
[7:20] also maketh intercession for us who
[7:23] shall separate us from the love of
[7:25] Christ so we see two witnesses Jesus
[7:28] said we won't come into condemnation
[7:30] Paul said there's no one that can
[7:32] condemn the bride the real Holy Ghost
[7:34] filled Saints because God has already
[7:36] Justified her there's two parables in
[7:39] Matthew 25 and they give us an insight
[7:41] into this judgment seat of Christ for
[7:43] the believer Matthew 2521 his lord said
[7:46] unto him well done thou good and
[7:48] faithful servant thou has been Faithful
[7:49] over few things I will make thee ruler
[7:52] over many things enter thou into the joy
[7:54] of thy Lord so this verse tells us what
[7:57] the Judgment seat of Christ will be like
[8:00] we'll give an account of what we've done
[8:02] with what God has given us then the Lord
[8:04] will call us faithful and tell us to
[8:06] enter into the joy of the Lord so just
[8:09] like this Parable says if you're given
[8:10] five talents you want to invest in them
[8:13] and get 10 if you're given two you want
[8:15] to invest in them double them and get
[8:17] four the sinful thing to do is bury your
[8:20] talent in the earth and not invest your
[8:23] life into the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[8:25] then of course we see the white Throne
[8:27] judgment Matthew 2533 34 now I believe
[8:30] this is the foolish virgin but in verse
[8:32] 33 it says and he shall set the sheep on
[8:35] his right hand but the goats in the left
[8:37] then shall the king say unto them on his
[8:39] right hand Come Ye blessed and my father
[8:40] inherit the Kingdom prepared for you
[8:42] from the foundation of the world so
[8:45] Matthew 25:21 I believe that's the bride
[8:48] the wise virgin they enter into the joys
[8:50] of the Lord but the foolish virgin they
[8:53] enter into the kingdom prepared for them
[8:54] from the foundation of the world at the
[8:56] white Throne judgment so we can see both
[8:59] judgments for the wise virgin and the
[9:01] foolish virgin are joyful for the wise
[9:04] virgin he said enter into the joy of the
[9:05] Lord the wise virgin is called good and
[9:08] faithful servant and here even the
[9:10] foolish virgin is called blessed of the
[9:12] father and they're given a kingdom that
[9:14] was prepared for them from the
[9:16] foundation of the world one more verse I
[9:18] want to read is 1 John 4:17 herein is
[9:21] our love made perfect that we may have
[9:22] boldness in that day of judgment because
[9:26] as he is so are we in this world
[9:29] so the Bible tells us we can have
[9:31] perfect love and this perfect love gives
[9:33] us boldness for that time that we stand
[9:36] at the Judgment seat of Christ because
[9:39] we are as he is in other words Christ is
[9:41] in us the hope of glory as Colossians 1
[9:45] verses 26 and 27 tell us next I'm going
[9:48] to show this visual of the three wedding
[9:51] events for the Bride of Jesus Christ
[9:53] brother brandom talks about this on a
[9:54] few occasions beginning with the Rapture
[9:57] the pre-tribulation Rapture is the
[9:59] beginning of this wedding process
[10:02] brother Bram says when the dead in
[10:03] Christ and the living Saints are meeting
[10:05] in the air that's the wedding ceremony
[10:08] brother Ram said we're going to be
[10:09] married in the sky so the wedding
[10:11] ceremony is the meeting in the air then
[10:14] we go to the marriage supper of the Lamb
[10:16] that's the second event the wedding
[10:18] reception and then at the battle of
[10:20] Armageddon Jesus will bring his bride
[10:23] with him he'll defeat all of his foes
[10:25] burn the Earth with fire and then he'll
[10:27] physically set his foot down down on the
[10:29] earth for the third wedding event which
[10:32] is the Thousand-Year Millennium or the
[10:34] wedding honeymoon so again the three
[10:36] steps are the wedding ceremony the
[10:38] meeting in the air the marriage supper
[10:40] the lamb the reception and the third is
[10:43] the honeymoon back on the earth in the
[10:46] Millennium now the church now is engaged
[10:52] to Christ for the wedding the wedding
[10:55] has never been performed yet it will be
[10:58] at the wedding supper of the Lamb so we
[11:02] see that the church is now engaged like
[11:06] a man engaged to his wife what does he
[11:10] do while they're engaged he is just
[11:13] bestowing all kinds of things sent in
[11:16] her presence making her feel good well
[11:19] that's what Christ is doing to his
[11:21] church he's sending us gifts of the
[11:27] Spirit how can you be engaged then when
[11:30] you're denying these gifts
[11:33] exist it's the very love
[11:37] tokens it's God's token to the church
[11:42] Jesus said
[11:43] so these signs shall follow them that
[11:50] believe help us
[11:52] Lord if there's one here that's called
[11:55] to this wedding supper of the Lamb this
[11:58] Thousand Years the Millennium rain and
[12:01] to then enter into the city after the
[12:04] honeymoon is over the Millennium is
[12:06] merely the
[12:08] honeymoon then she the bride takes his
[12:11] bridegroom takes his bride
[12:13] home it's hers her bridegroom his
[12:19] bride oh he's gone to prepare a house
[12:23] since he's become
[12:25] engaged may we be true to him who is the
[12:27] word for he is the
[12:30] word you're not only that but you're
[12:33] going to the wedding in the skies and
[12:35] you are wearing the wedding band of
[12:38] predestinated unmerited
[12:41] Grace a wedding band of
[12:44] Grace unmerited of your own God did it
[12:47] himself he knew you before the
[12:49] foundation of the world so he slipped
[12:50] the wedding band on you there put your
[12:52] name on the book what a
[12:54] Thanksgiving hallelujah praise our God h
[12:59] closing I might say this
[13:01] we next I want to look a little closer
[13:03] at the marriage supper of the Lamb to
[13:05] give you some scripture on that so
[13:07] here's a visual I'm calling it The
[13:09] judgment seat of Christ for the bride
[13:12] remember there's a judgment seat of
[13:14] Christ for the foolish virgin I showed
[13:16] that earlier that was the second
[13:17] Resurrection on the two resurrections
[13:19] visual so here at the marriage supper of
[13:21] the Lamb there's at least three things
[13:23] that are happening while the Bride of
[13:25] Jesus Christ is up in heaven at the
[13:28] wedding reception we we'd call it now
[13:30] the foolish virgin and everyone else on
[13:32] the earth the unbelievers are going
[13:33] through the 7year Great Tribulation
[13:35] period but up in heaven at the marriage
[13:38] supper of the Lamb there's at least
[13:39] three things taking place first there's
[13:41] a presentation of the Bride according to
[13:43] 2 Corinthians 11:2 Paul said he was
[13:46] going to present the Corinthians as a
[13:48] Chase virgin to Christ brother BM says
[13:50] this in the church age book that the
[13:52] church age messenger for each age has a
[13:55] special duty to present the bride from
[13:58] each Church age to the Lord Jesus second
[14:02] rewards will be given out according to 2
[14:03] Corinthians 510 we read that earlier
[14:07] where Paul said everyone all the wise
[14:09] virgins will receive the good that
[14:10] they've done in this body and again
[14:13] that's the statement where Jesus said in
[14:14] Matthew 2521 enter into the joys of the
[14:17] Lord you've been Faithful over few I'm
[14:19] making you ruler over much of course
[14:22] that rulership is future tense for the
[14:24] Thousand-Year Millennial
[14:27] Reign then third and finally it's seems
[14:29] like there is a communion ceremony at
[14:31] the marriage supper of the Lamb
[14:32] according to Genesis
[14:34] 14:18 after Abraham won the battle in
[14:37] Genesis 14 he met MDC and they had Bread
[14:42] and Wine they had a communion ceremony
[14:44] brother random uses this scripture many
[14:46] times to talk about after the battle of
[14:49] overcoming leoda will have communion
[14:51] with the Lord Jesus Christ in heaven and
[14:54] then we also see that in Matthew
[14:57] 2629 right after Jesus ordained the
[15:00] Lord's Supper on the last night before
[15:03] his arrest death burial and Resurrection
[15:06] Jesus said I won't drink of the vine
[15:08] again until I drink it a new with you in
[15:10] my father's Kingdom now we believe the
[15:12] father's Kingdom would be at the
[15:13] marriage supper of the Lamb then we
[15:16] believe Jesus's Throne or Kingdom would
[15:17] be the Thousand-Year Millennial Reign
[15:20] but mzd after his child Abraham had won
[15:25] the victory MDC met him and gave him
[15:29] wine and bread amen showing that after
[15:32] this Earthly battle is over we will meet
[15:36] him in the heavens and take the
[15:38] communion again it'll be the wedding
[15:40] supper amen I will not drink the more
[15:42] the vine or eat the fruit until I eat it
[15:45] and drink it with you and new in my
[15:46] father's kingdom is that right we may
[15:50] never meet another
[15:52] breakfast but there's one thing sure
[15:54] we'll go to meet at a supper someday
[15:56] that's a wedding supper that great table
[15:59] is stretched across the skies reaching
[16:02] from Sky to
[16:04] Sky we look across the table one to
[16:07] another there's bound to be a little
[16:09] tear dropped from our cheeks as we think
[16:12] as we shake each other's hands say I
[16:13] remember the Salem meeting here's
[16:16] brother so and so he is the one to come
[16:17] in at that time this and down
[16:19] here then the king and his Beauty will
[16:22] walk out its white
[16:24] robes wipe all tears away from our eyes
[16:27] they don't cry children it's all over
[16:30] enter into the joys of the Lord has been
[16:32] prepared for you since the foundation of
[16:33] the world and finally I want to play a
[16:36] quote from God's Prophet brother Brenham
[16:38] from The Sixth Seal he tells a dream and
[16:41] he said this is the first time he's ever
[16:42] told it publicly he was wondering where
[16:46] his first wife hope and his second wife
[16:48] ma would be placed in heaven which wife
[16:51] would he be with sister M was having a
[16:54] hard time understanding that and he
[16:55] tells a story and again and again he
[16:57] says it's just a dream so it's not a
[16:59] thus sayith the Lord but he had a dream
[17:02] he was there in heaven with the Lord
[17:03] Jesus and individuals were being called
[17:05] up to stand before Christ and receive
[17:08] their reward he talks about brother
[17:10] Neville going up and then his name was
[17:12] called and right before he gets to the
[17:14] steps to stand before the Lord hope is
[17:17] there and meat is there and then they go
[17:18] up to stand before the Lord together
[17:20] when brother R woke up he cried and he
[17:22] said oh God I hope that comes like that
[17:25] so again this is just a hopeful dream
[17:28] brother bandam had he did not say it was
[17:29] thus sayi the Lord seems very scriptural
[17:32] though so if this dream was scriptural
[17:34] it would be the rewards event which is
[17:38] one of those three events that would
[17:39] take place at the marriage supper of the
[17:41] Lamb you had presentation rewards and
[17:45] communion and again there is some
[17:47] uncertainty about the order of these
[17:49] events it seems like from the dream that
[17:51] maybe rewards would be given first the
[17:54] members would first enter into the joys
[17:56] of the Lord and then maybe the broad
[17:58] would be presented next and then
[18:00] communion would be last I don't know I'm
[18:02] just giving my simple thoughts on that I
[18:04] could be wrong so let's listen to the
[18:06] quote from God's Prophet brother BR the
[18:07] six seal I want tell you a little thing
[18:09] happened this was a
[18:12] dream I was asleep and I've never told
[18:15] this publicly before I told it to a
[18:16] couple of people but never publicly
[18:19] before as I know I I dreamed about a
[18:22] month after that that I was standing one
[18:24] day and I was watching the great uh a
[18:28] Time
[18:29] that not the Judgment now I don't
[18:31] believe the church ever comes to the I
[18:33] mean the bride goes to a judgment but I
[18:36] was there when the crowns is being given
[18:38] out see and the great great big Throne
[18:41] set up here and Jesus and the recording
[18:44] Angel and all was standing there and
[18:46] there was a stair steps like come down
[18:48] this way of white Ivory run down a
[18:50] circle made a panoramic like this and
[18:52] went out so all this great host stand
[18:55] out there could see what was happening
[18:57] and I'd stand back over way back to one
[18:59] side and I just stand there never idea I
[19:01] had to walk in steps I stand there I'd
[19:03] see a recording Angel call a certain
[19:05] name and I know recognize that name I
[19:07] look and way back out there here come
[19:09] the brother walking or the sister walk
[19:11] up you like that the recording angel
[19:13] stand there with the sight of Christ
