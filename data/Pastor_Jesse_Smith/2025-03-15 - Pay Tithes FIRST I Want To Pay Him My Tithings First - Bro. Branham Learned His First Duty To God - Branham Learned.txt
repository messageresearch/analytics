TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] I just become a Christian I said first thing Mr Mason as my duty to God I my ti I want to pay my tiing first greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to look at this wonderful quotation from God's Prophet brother William brandham this week I was studying on finances someone in the church had asked me about it and I came across this quote and it was just a refreshment to go over this again the quotes from Christ is revealed in his own word August 22nd 1965 the morning service brother Braham said I want to pay him my tithings first so A beautiful story here brother brandham as a young man right after he gave his heart to God he learned that his first duty to God was to pay his ties to God first we see this principle in Proverbs 3:9 honor the Lord with thy substance and with the first fruits of all thine increase so we see this principle give to God first as Jesus said in Matthew 6:33 seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these other things will be added unto you also Matthew 621 Jesus said for where your treasure is there will your heart be also so I love the story brother R just got saved so his treasur is in heaven the word of God is his treasure and even as a young Christian he had learned that with all the money I make I'm going to honor God with all the blessings he bestows upon me I'm going to honor God first by paying my ties although he had a lot of money in medical debts he was able to honor God with his ties first and then eventually God poured out blessings upon him the windows of Heaven were open and he was able to pay off all of his medical debts by the grace of God so I have a couple videos on Bible teaching on paying ties if you'd like to watch that I'll put a link to those in the description it's taught in 1 Corinthians chapter 9 Paul said also in the New Testament the Lord has ordained them which preach the gospel to live of the Gospel so tithing is also a new testament teaching and the Revelation is that tithing is before the Old Testament under Abraham Jacob both men tithe even before the law came under Moses so there was tithing before the law there was tithing in the law and there's tithing in the New Testament we also see a form of tithing in the future home because in Revelation 21:4 the Bible said the kings of the earth do bring their Glory and Honor into it and brother brandom said these were the kings of the earth bringing their tithes and offerings into the future home so brother ram calls them Eternal tithes oh oh if we could had time to take that I got for the book over there over in Revelation all the kings of the earth bring their honor into it that's like a and type the tribe of Levi all the rest of them pay TI to see from one new moon to another one Sabbath to another one up to worship what a day that'll be all right the day they're trying to take the place of God's tiing they're trying to adopt something they're trying to to make it differ they go down and have bunk games in the churches play Lottery lottery will never take the place of God's Tiding suffering Brank excelling pic to raise money to pay different debts off it'll never take the place of God's Eternal child in the offering it'll never do it but yet we're trying to do it what is it it's enticing spirit coming down trying to sub substitute something for the word of God so I just thought I'd make this quick video here as a reminder about the importance of putting God first in finances because you realize all your finances your good health your good job all these things come from above they come from the Lord Jesus Christ and this was such a refreshing quote for me to hear this week by God's grace so so let's listen to the quote from Christ is revealed in his own word now I see laying here there's been many requests this last week on what I said uh last Sunday on the message I believe I forget what I titled it now but uh I said something about paying your debts and you know no matter what you say it's misunderstood by many not because they they don't want to misunderstand it but you just simply misunderstand it and now someone said should we buy a car or what should I that that isn't what Jesus spoke of or the Bible there that said oh no man nothing that's lingering debts that you could pay pay them it don't that's owing no man nothing it doesn't mean my we owe a rent or telephone bill we and what more we we owe those things and we pay them but an old lingering debt that you could be paying on pay it off see uh don't go with anything hanging on you like that I remember a time when I was sick once when I was a boy I come out of the hospital owing about $2,000 and used to be a drugstore here Mr swaner I owed him about3 or $400 of medicine Bill he didn't even know me and a man I went to him I didn't know him and he just s up there anyhow never refused to send it and I said I owe you and I said uh I believe swaner it was Mr Mason down Court Avenue in Spring I said I owe you and I'm I'm just still awfully weak but I'm trying to go to work now if I can't pay you I just become a Christian I said first thing Mr Mason as my duty to God I owe him my tithe I want to pay him my tithings first and I said then my next duty is pay my debts I said my father's sickly and he and we got these 10 of us children in the family but I said I if I can't pay you more than 25 cents on that bill each payday if I can't pay you even the 25 cents I'll come by and tell you about it I'll tell you I I I can't do it this time I by the help of God I pay paid every bit off see but that's what I mean see just don't somebody say oh some Christian here at the church one time went out and got some work done on a car here and the man come down the man said I'll pay you I get paid Saturday or something other and he never paid even weeks after weeks Roll by never paid him never said a word and the man come to ask me he said see it reflects against the church it reflects against Christ you can't pay him go tell them say I owe you and I'm going to pay you I'm a Christian but I I just I can't do it right now I've got I owe this and remember it's on God's books too you know as you do so that's I'm trying to for myself and for all of us together try to be ready for we know we're getting near something very near something's going to take place so we want to be ready when the coming of the Lord is drawing so nigh now we want to be ready for that great hour what a blessing to hear God's Prophet testify about the faithfulness of God of course the blessing is talking about is in Malachi 3:10 bring ye all the ties into the storehouse that there may be meat in mine house and prove me now herewith sayith the Lord of hosts if I will not open you the windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive it and again there's so many scriptures on the importance of tithes and offerings so again I'll leave a link to that video in the description by the grace of God friends let's always put God first three times God said I am the first and the last Isaiah 44:6 thus sayith the Lord the king of Israel and his Redeemer the Lord of hosts I am the first and I am the last and beside me there is no God Isaiah 4812 hearken unto me oh Jacob and Israel my called I am he I am the first and I am also the last and Revelation 1:7 and when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not I am the first and the last since Jesus Christ is the first and the last let's put him first in everything Prayer by Bible study finances worship everything we do let's put him first he's worthy of being first in everything of course I think this topic is especially important for brothers in the church leaders in the church the men that God has placed in leadership in families and in the church I've seen so many examples where men did not put God first in finances but God is rich in Mercy and God will teach his children to put him first by the grace of God and all those that do will see the same Windows of Heaven open as brother random saw as I've seen as no doubt many Christians have seen by the promise of almighty God because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever according to Hebrews 13:8 if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
