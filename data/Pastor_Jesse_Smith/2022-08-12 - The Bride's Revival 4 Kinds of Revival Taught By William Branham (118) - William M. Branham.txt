TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] greetings friends in the name above all names the lord jesus christ the purpose of this video is to explain the four types of revivals that we see described by god's prophet brother branham my prayer is that the content of this video will dissolve any doubts about whether or not the bride of jesus christ is in revival if the souls of the members of the bride are born again their souls will be in a perpetual state of revival unto the day of redemption and bride members will have daily revival in their minds or human spirits but different from these two is the latter rain revival or the anointing of rapturing faith to change the bodies of the holy ghost-filled bride members in a moment and twinkling of an eye and this latter rain revival has not happened yet and it's the revival we're waiting on and also i want to apologize in advance if you hear noises in the background you know the air conditioner runs at times and then i have eight children so you might hear them running upstairs or talking upstairs so i'm sure if you have children you understand that the outline for the video is first we'll look at the four kinds of revivals and second look at how the soul needs one filling or baptism only and not many refillings four different revivals friends it seems god's prophet brother william branham describes at least four different kinds of revivals and there could be more i'm always open to correction the first revival is the national revival of the people living in the united states of america brother branham plainly said with thus saith the lord that a national revival will not take place which matches the book of revelation prophecy in revelation chapter 13 verses 11 through 18 that the united states is the beast out of the land that will cause the mark of the beast to be laid down let's listen to the thus saith the lord quote from jehovah jireh 1961. [Applause] she'll never rise again just sayeth the lord 1956 she made her fatal move we learned from this quote that we should not pray for a nationwide revival in the united states but this quote should not stop us from praying for our lost loved ones to be saved and should not stop us from having revivals that bring them to justification and or sanctification and or the baptism of the holy ghost also this quote should not stop us from praying for our elected leaders and for peace in our countries as well as for souls to be saved as paul said it was good and acceptable to do so in 1st timothy chapter 2 verses 1-4 i exhort thee therefore that first of all supplications prayers intercessions and giving of thanks be made for all men for kings and for all that are in authority that we may lead a quiet and peaceful life in all godliness and honesty for this is good and acceptable in the sight of god our savior who will have all men to be saved and to come unto the knowledge of the truth other verses encourage us to keep praying for souls within our nation and of course not a national revival i've recently seen god witness to this truth of praying for individual souls as i prayed numerous times over the past three or four years for the roe vs wade supreme court ruling to be overturned based upon ezekiel 9 verse 4 and ezekiel 22 verses 30 and 31 and god heard the many prayers of the saints when roe v wade was overturned on june 24 2022 ezekiel 9 4 spoke of sighing and crying for all the abominations done in the midst thereof in ezekiel 22 verses 13 31 said god was looking for a man among them that should make up the hedge and stand the gap before god for the land that i should not destroy it and friends we know jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever meaning we should be praying today sighing and crying for all the abominations done in america and of course every other country we also know god is looking for men and women who will be prayer warriors as kings and priests unto god they'll make intercessions unto god for the individuals in our countries that will still be saved furthermore numerous message churches around the united states and even the world are reporting revivals which i believe in and support as i've been a part of revivals in the past as well the second revival is the bride's revival or latter rain which is yet to come in the future it's my opinion that when brother branham spoke that the bride hasn't had a revival yet he was referring to the last and final revival before the rapture which he taught was the latter rain let's listen to the first quote from the third seal when brother branham says the bride hasn't had a revival yet oh they've got millions and millions and millions of church members but not a revival number no uh the bride hasn't had a revival yet there's been no revival there no manifestation of god to stir the bride yesterday we're looking for him he'll take those seven unknown thunders back there to wake her up again [Applause] he'll send it here's another quote from the first seal where brother branham links rapturing faith with the seven thunders that he had previously mentioned in the third seal quote so again we get a connection between brother branham linking rapturing faith the seven thunders and a revival for the bride together so this would be a different kind of revival this would be the latter rain revival let's listen to the quote all right i believe that through those seven thunders will be revealed in the last days in order to get the bride together for rapture and faith because right now we would be able to do it there's something we've got to step forward there we we can't have enough faith for divine healing hardly we've got to have enough faith to be changed in a moment and be swept up out of this earth and again here's another quote from the first seal linking the rapturing faith to the seven thunders let's listen to the quote but when these seven thunders over in revelation utter he said don't write them at all there are mysteries we don't know what they are yet but my opinion they'll be revealed right away i want to do it it'll give faith to that rapture and grace lecture we've just moved through everything that we know of through all the dispensations we've watched everything we've seen the mysteries of god we've seen the appearing of the of the great uh gathered together of the bride in the last days and friends i also want to say that i believe brother ram grew in his understanding of the seven thunders i believe when he preached about the seven thunders during the seven seals series it was before he had the full understanding of the seven thunders which he told us later in 1964 and also in the church age book he told us the seven thunders were the revelations contained in the seven seals so it's my opinion that we already have the revelation of the seven thunders because we have the revelation of the seven seals according to revelation chapter 10 verses one through seven earlier this year i preached two sermons about the seven thunders and the seventh seal please contact me if you'd like a link to those sermons here's two more quotes from the church age book where brother braham says there'll be a showdown at the latter reign and brother branham said there'd be a second forerunner of christ which was his ministry and he would plant for the latter rain or so for the latter rain so brother ram said that in chapter 5 and then in chapter 10 brother branham calls the latter rain rapturing faith let's listen to the quotes then in the latter rain will come a mount carmel showdown watch this carefully now to see it in the word john was the forerunner of malachi 3. he planted the former rain and was rejected by the organizations of his day jesus came and had a mount transfiguration showdown the second forerunner of christ will sew for the latter reign jesus will be the showdown between the denominations and creeds for he will come to back up his word and take his bride in the rapture the first showdown was mount carmel the second was the mount transfiguration and the third will be mount zion he is doing it as started in verse 23 by the teaching or former reign next will come to harvest reign or rapturing faith the third revival is the holy ghost baptism revival caused by the message from the holy ghost to the angel or messenger to each church age there are numerous quotes wherein brother branham speaks about the revival that god started in his ministry and how it had not yet denominated and would not denominate this is the third kind of revival which is the holy ghost baptism revival to each church age here's one example from a quote referring to this kind of revival from harvest time 1964. let's listen to the quote listen friends what day are we living in we've had a 15-year revival how many to say amen today what organization raised up none they tried to get me to make an organization brother graham on your ministry it'll be not me i talk about me i'm talking also here's an important quote where brother branham said the bride had already been awakened which is opposite of what he said in the third seal 1963 which could mean a couple different things first it could be the revelation of the seven seals awaken the bride's revelation of the bible specifically the finishing of the mystery of god as spoken of in revelation chapter 10 verse 7 or second it could mean the awakened bride in this quote meant the true bride was awakened with the baptism of the holy ghost message that brother branham delivered as the angel or messenger to this church age which i call the third revival for the sake of this video let's listen to the they're quote believing that they will be awakened they're good people why is it what have they done they have not recognized the awakening of the bride the by being a christian they feel the pull of the hour but they haven't recognized what's been done that's what's making them feel that way they know something's supposed to happen but see they're looking for a way off in the future to come when it's already happening right by you a fourth kind of revival is the daily revival we need in our human spirits or minds every single day note specifically this is not a revival of the human soul as i'll teach at the end of this video this is proven by both the holy scripture and quotes from brother branham two scriptures out of others no doubt prove this truth the first is second corinthians 4 16 which says though our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day and the same author saint paul wrote ephesians 4 verse 23 be renewed in the spirit of your mind you never see paul saying renew your soul there's no scripture that says your soul needs renewed every single day here's a quote from how can i overcome 1963 uh wherein brother branham taught the same let's listen to the and i quote to take my subject this morning of this how can i overcome now i chose this because i think that it's a time that we should never let the spirit of revival die amen we've got to keep in revival constantly revive every day amen paul said he had to die daily that christ believed and we must the soul needs one filling or baptism only friends some believers think their soul needs refilled and can have many refillings if we rightly divide this idea by the scripture though we find this is not true the truth is the soul gets one filling also called a ceiling or seal unto the day of redemption as taught in ephesians 4 30. it's the human mind or spirit that gets many refillings and really has the potential of this refilling happening every single day notice the new testament never uses the language of refilled in the soul or sealed again or sealed a second time the bible speaks of only one quickening ephesians 2 verses 1 and 5 you hathy quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins and verse 5 when ye were dead in sins hath quickened us together with christ also colossians 2 verse 13 you being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh hath he quickened together with him having forgiven you all trespasses friends search the scriptures the book of acts never says refilled with the holy ghost in their souls so we cannot add to the word of god and say that the soul needs refilled again and again or many baptisms in the soul there's only one baptism in the human soul the only bible language is that we are sealed in the soul one time unto the day of redemption according to ephesians 4 verse 30 grieve not the spirit of god whereby you are sealed unto the day of redemption also ephesians 1 13 after that you heard the word of truth you were sealed with that holy spirit of promise second corinthians 1 verse 22 who hath also sealed us and given us the earnest of the spirit in our hearts and again second corinthians 4 verse 16 proves the renewing or refilling of the human spirit or mind can potentially take place every day which is only possible through dying to self daily as paul said in first corinthians 15 31 i die daily i want to share two quotes from god's prophet brother branham that teach this truth the first is from the token 1964 february 8th brother ram said you can backslide but it does not mean in your soul and he quoted ephesians 4 verse 30. so this means you can only backslide in the mind if your soul is sealed by the holy ghost baptism let's listen to the quote dear friends if you ever healed if you live long enough you'll get sick again if you one time take that token you've had it forever greed not the holy spirit of god whereby you are sealed until the day of your redemption not to the next revival you wasn't sealed you got emotionally worked up but you are dead and your life is hitting god through christ and you're sealed by the holy ghost if you are once baptized into that holy spirit and you can backslide that is true but lastly in the sermon souls that are imprisoned now brother branham said the seal is in the soul and although he didn't say ephesians 4 30 he basically said the same words so we know there's only one ceiling there's only one filling of the soul but the human mind can be filled and refilled every single day let's listen to the quote now the soul of man is not the body of man it's the soul and the soul is something that's uh the nature of the spirit and then when the nature of a man when he said we are dead the scripture plainly tells us that we are dead and our lives are hitting god through christ sealed there by the holy spirit now it wasn't that your body died it wasn't your spirit died it was the nature of your spirit dying see the nature which is the soul the nature of your soul is uh is god if you're born again if it's not it's not the world anything that begin has to end so therefore the only way that you can have eternal life is to have a life that never did begin i'd like to add another quote from 1963 what shall i do with this jesus called christ brother branham said the dynamics of the church will be a refilling of the holy spirit so based upon the bible scriptures and other quotes from brother branham this can only mean a refilling in the human spirit or mind because as we've already showed there are no scriptures that support a refilling of the soul or a second baptism of the soul or another sealing of the soul let's listen to the quote the dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the holy spirit that we have worked in a small measure while the headstone is coming down to unite with the body but when that head and body unites together the full power of the holy ghost razor up just exactly like even the dead is dead in christ for hundreds of years ago the dynamics is the holy spirit in closing friends i hope this video has been a blessing you know this question has been on my heart for numerous years especially after i would listen to the third seal and hear brother branham say the bride hasn't had revival yet then of course if you listen to all the sermons from the seven seals you realize he's talking about the revival for the rapture or the latter rain and remember friends there's numerous quotes from brother branham where he says his ministry started a revival that's gone 10 15 or more years and hasn't stopped and would not be denominated so if brother rams ministry started a revival that has to be the holy ghost baptism revival in the soul and if the bride hasn't had a revival yet that could only be the latter rain revival which would be rapturing faith a short time before the literal rapture the body change which is the moment in twinkling of an eye when death is swallowed up in victory and our mortality puts on immortality may i encourage you to get a refilling of the holy ghost in your spirit or mind every single day die out to your own human desires or human thoughts and fill your mind with the thoughts of god almighty of course if you do this long enough then your soul will be sealed or filled or quickened one time unto the day of your redemption if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me god bless you and may jesus christ be the desire of your heart
