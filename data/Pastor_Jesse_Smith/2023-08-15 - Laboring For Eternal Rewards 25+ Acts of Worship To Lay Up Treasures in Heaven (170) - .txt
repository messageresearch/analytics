TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] foreign friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to look at over 25 rewards God promises for Christian acts of service and of course these acts or works of service are done with love Bible's clear in Ephesians 2 verses 8 through 10 that were saved by grace through faith but Ephesians 2 10 clearly says we were created unto good works so these 25 plus works are acts of worship Jesus created us to perform by his grace and through the leadership of his holy spirit remember Jesus tells us in Matthew 6 verses 20 and 21 to lay up for ourselves Treasures in Heaven he says for where your treasure is there will your heart be also Hebrews 6 10 tells us God is Not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love which you have showed toward his name and that ye administered to the Saints and do minister and Galatians 6 verse 9 says and let us not be wearing well doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not I love this quote from brother Brandon from the church age book chapter four brother random says all too little time is spent on laboring for the Eternal rewards of God brother Ram says we ought to lay up in heaven these good Treasures let's listen to the quote all too little time is spent on laboring for the Eternal rewards of God the recompense of God is too lightly esteemed if we believe in the reality of the resurrection of the body and an eternal Kingdom of substance then we ought to lay up in heaven those good Treasures that are available to the faithful Saints so now let's go through the list of Acts that God rewards and there is some overlap that's why I said around 25 maybe a few more but the first two are withstanding persecution and enduring Temptation according to Matthew 5 verse 12 and James 1 verse 12. the next is giving a cup of water in the name of Jesus or a disciple found in Mark 9 41 and Matthew 10 42. next is receiving a prophet or righteous man in Matthew 10 verse 41. next is praying in secret according to Matthew 6 verse 6. next is giving alms in secret Matthew 6 verse 4. the next two are planting and watering the gospel found in First Corinthians 3 8-9 is leaving family members and possessions for the sake of the Lord found in Mark 10 29-30 next is fighting a good fight and Keeping the Faith According to second Timothy 4 verses 7 and 8. next is making a dinner for those who cannot repay you according to Luke 14 verses 12-14 next is visiting fatherless children and widows in their Affliction according to James 1 verse 27 and of course this verse proves religion is a good word as long as the people that are performing the religious acts have pure hearts the next ACT is serving God willingly First Corinthians 9 verse 17. next is God rewards any Harley service done to the Lord Colossians 3 verses 24 and 25. the next reward is for diligently seeking God according to Hebrews 11 verse 6. fasting in secret is the next ACT that God honors and gives reward for found in Matthew 6 verse 18. Matthew 25 verses 34 through 40 lists six more acts that get rewarded it's providing food providing drink providing shelter or providing clothes to a Christian or visiting a Christian when he's sick or in prison then in Luke 6 verses 27-33 there's rewards for loving your enemies blessing those who persecute you praying for those who despitefully use you and lending with no hope of repayment Jesus says these all yield a great reward along with the title being called the children of the highest the next works that are rewarded are providing a Christian's physical Necessities so this is an overlap and Paul says it yields a Heavenly reward Upon A giver's account according to Galatians 6 verse 10 and Philippians 4 verses 15 through 18. in the last act of worship is a general overcoming of sin during any of the seven Church ages and then the Bible says if you overcome in one Church age you inherit all the rewards of the other six Church ages and these rewards are eating the Tree of Life escaping the second death eating the hidden Manna a white stone with a new name Within power to rule over Nations the Morning Star White raiment having your name remain in the Book of Life being a pillar in the temple of God having Jesus's new name having God's new name and the new Jerusalem's name written upon the believer and lastly sitting with Jesus in his throne in closing friends I hope this video was a blessing one of the Saints in the church really enjoyed this list when I preached it last Sunday so I thought I would just share a short video about it and hopefully it'll bless many more Christians by the grace of God I'm reminded of the song when the roles Called Up Yonder I'll be there one of the verses says let us labor for the master from the Dawn Till Setting Sun let us talk of all his wondrous love and care then when all of life is over and our work on Earth is done and the roles Called Up Yonder I'll be there friends each one of us have a work to do on this Earth but all of these 25 plus acts of worship are available to each one of us all of us have the equal opportunity to lay up Treasures in Heaven and as I mentioned the sermon the fact that all these acts are equal opportunity acts of worship shows the Fulfillment of the parable of the pounds in Luke chapter 19. in the parable each servant was given an equal amount of money and hear all these acts are available to each and every person it doesn't matter your age your gender or any other attribute all of us can serve God willingly and store up Treasures in Heaven For the Glory of our Lord Jesus Christ remember the Bible says in John 15 that the father is glorified much when we bear much fruit and of course our motivation is our love for the Lord Jesus Christ if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
