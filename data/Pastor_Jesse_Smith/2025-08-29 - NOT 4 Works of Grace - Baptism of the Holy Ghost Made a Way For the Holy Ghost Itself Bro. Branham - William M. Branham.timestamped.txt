[0:03] The baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way
[0:05] for the Holy Ghost itself to come right
[0:07] down in perfection back to the word
[0:09] again to manifest itself.
[0:14] &gt;&gt; Greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:16] of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of
[0:18] this video is to understand a quote from
[0:20] God's prophet brother William Brham from
[0:23] the masterpiece July 5th 1964. The quote
[0:27] says that the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[0:29] made a way for the Holy Ghost itself to
[0:32] come right down in perfection. So, by
[0:36] the grace of God, I'll be explaining how
[0:38] this quote agrees with the three works
[0:40] of grace. Recently, I've heard two
[0:43] preachers use this quote, which I
[0:45] believe they used it incorrectly, in
[0:48] order to promote a fourth work of grace,
[0:50] trying to make today's baptism of the
[0:53] Holy Ghost something different from the
[0:55] book of Acts chapter 2, which is wrong.
[0:58] Brother Ram said, "The fullness of
[1:00] Pentecost will be in the bride at the
[1:03] end time with thus sayeth the Lord in
[1:04] the church age book." So I felt burdened
[1:07] to make a video about this here by the
[1:08] grace of God to stand up for the three
[1:11] works of grace which brother Ram said
[1:12] was his message.
[1:14] &gt;&gt; If that ain't my message exactly today
[1:16] justification, sanctification, baptism
[1:19] and I was saying that a person has to
[1:22] come by these three steps to be able to
[1:24] walk that highway.
[1:26] &gt;&gt; So friends, I heard a preacher here in
[1:28] America literally say there's four works
[1:30] of grace. That was his sermon title.
[1:33] Very sad sermon title. Of course,
[1:35] there's not four works of grace. There's
[1:37] only three works of grace. And then I
[1:39] heard another preacher from Africa who
[1:42] visited the US use this masterpiece
[1:45] quote to try to make today's Holy Ghost
[1:48] experience a further experience than the
[1:52] book of Acts. They're trying to make it
[1:54] a noneotional
[1:55] experience. He's trying to go beyond the
[1:58] original Holy Ghost baptism experience
[2:01] from the day of Pentecost. And of
[2:02] course, that's wrong. That's false
[2:04] doctrine. So, first let's look at this
[2:06] quote again in its fullness again from
[2:08] the masterpiece paragraph 136. Brother
[2:11] Ram's talking about the life in the
[2:13] stalk. And you'll hear him say,
[2:15] "Justification made a way for
[2:16] sanctification. Sanctification made a
[2:18] way for the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[2:20] The baptism of the Holy Ghost made a way
[2:22] for the Holy Ghost itself to come right
[2:24] down in perfection. Back to the word
[2:26] again to manifest itself." Let's listen
[2:28] to the quote.
[2:30] Notice here the life that was in the
[2:33] husk in the stalk and in the tossel in
[2:36] the husk all gathers in the seed and the
[2:40] life that was in the stalk went one went
[2:44] to make the other.
[2:47] Justification made a way for
[2:49] sanctification.
[2:50] Sanctification made a way for the
[2:52] baptism of the Holy Ghost. The baptism
[2:56] of the Holy Ghost made a way for the
[2:58] Holy Ghost itself to come right down in
[3:00] perfection back to the word again to
[3:02] manifest itself.
[3:05] &gt;&gt; Now friends, let's make a few points
[3:06] here about this quote. Now, in the
[3:08] context of this sermon, it should be
[3:10] known that Brother Ram never said four
[3:13] stages in this sermon. You can look it
[3:15] up yourself. In fact, I only found two
[3:19] quotes that say four stages in the
[3:21] entire message. One is 1953. Brother Ram
[3:24] said Israel had four stages to Canaan or
[3:26] the promised land. Now, of course, later
[3:28] he corrected that and showed there was
[3:30] three stages. There was leaving Egypt,
[3:33] the wilderness was second, and then
[3:35] crossing Jordan into Canaan was the
[3:38] third work of grace. And then in
[3:41] restoration of the bride, brother Ram
[3:42] said there's four stages for Ezekiel's
[3:45] restoration of dry bones. And that is
[3:47] true. There are four stages. But brother
[3:49] Ram never repeated this teaching again
[3:52] and again as he did the three works of
[3:54] grace. So it seems like these are four
[3:56] works that relate to the 144,000
[3:59] Israelis who receive Jesus and their
[4:02] blindness is taken away during the great
[4:04] tribulation period and they meet with
[4:06] the lamb on Mount Zion. It's the nation
[4:08] that's born in a day. The Bible said the
[4:11] Bible prophesied of it in the book of
[4:13] Isaiah. So that's the first point. If
[4:15] you look at the context of the
[4:16] masterpiece, brother Ram never said four
[4:19] stages. It's clear from the context.
[4:21] Brother Ram is talking about the
[4:23] Pentecostals and the Pentecostal
[4:25] denomination. For example, in paragraph
[4:28] 125, brother Ram said, "Now Pentecostal
[4:30] brethren throughout the nations, I want
[4:32] you to listen my brother." And then he
[4:34] goes into how this is his masterpiece,
[4:37] the masterpiece of the wheat plant. So
[4:39] when brother Ram goes through the works
[4:41] of grace, he hits justification,
[4:42] sanctification, and then when he says
[4:44] the baptism of the Holy Ghost there,
[4:46] he's referring to the Isuza Street
[4:48] revival of 1906 and the Pentecostal
[4:51] denomination that followed it. Brother
[4:54] Brandon was not teaching four works of
[4:56] grace. And of course, I'll prove that a
[4:57] little later on in this video, but if
[4:59] you understand that context, then it
[5:01] makes sense. Justification, Martin
[5:04] Luther, sanctification, John Wesley, the
[5:07] baptism of the Holy Ghost or the
[5:09] restoration of the gifts with speaking
[5:10] in tongues, interpretation and so forth
[5:13] from Isuza Street, William Seymour's
[5:15] revival 1906. And that made a way for
[5:18] the Holy Ghost itself, which we believe
[5:20] the Holy Ghost itself is the original
[5:22] baptism of the Holy Ghost that the
[5:24] saints received on the day of Pentecost.
[5:27] The baptism of the Holy Ghost in your
[5:28] soul, not just the gifts of the Holy
[5:31] Spirit. So that's the context of the
[5:33] sermon and what brother Ram was talking
[5:35] about. Also friends, if you look in the
[5:38] quotes of brother Random, overall in all
[5:39] the quotes, there are zero quotes that
[5:42] say four works of grace compared to four
[5:46] exact quotes that say three works of
[5:48] grace. And then there's over 140 quotes
[5:50] where brother Brennham uses
[5:52] justification, sanctification, and
[5:54] baptism of the Holy Ghost in the same
[5:56] sentence. So basically, you have two
[5:58] quotes that say four stages versus over
[6:02] 140 that speak of the three works of
[6:05] grace. And then friends, consider this.
[6:07] If someone goes to four works of grace,
[6:10] they break all the types from the Bible
[6:12] that Brother Brandham preached about
[6:14] there being only three works of grace.
[6:17] So here's a chart from my 2021 book.
[6:20] There's eight examples of three works of
[6:22] grace. man's natural birth, man's
[6:24] spiritual birth, Israel's exodus, the
[6:27] tabernacle's cleansing in their in its
[6:30] three courts, the earth's cleansing,
[6:32] Ezekiel's prophecy, the growing wheat
[6:35] plant, and Jesus as the way to heaven.
[6:38] The one we want to focus on is the
[6:40] growing wheat plant from Mark 4:28.
[6:43] Friends, Jesus Christ himself said
[6:45] there's only three stages to the wheat
[6:47] plant. The blade, the ear, and the full
[6:50] corn.
[6:52] So, anyone that preaches four works of
[6:54] grace is going against the words of the
[6:55] Lord Jesus from Mark 4:28.
[6:59] And remember that was brother Brandham's
[7:01] masterpiece in the masterpiece sermon,
[7:04] the life of the wheat plant,
[7:06] justification, sanctification, the
[7:08] baptism of the Holy Ghost in the soul.
[7:10] The same Holy Ghost experience Peter,
[7:13] James, John, and all the saints received
[7:14] on the day of Pentecost in Acts chapter
[7:17] 2. Now, let's prove this a little
[7:19] further. Let's again go back to the
[7:20] context of this quote. So, brother Ram
[7:23] said, "The baptism of the Holy Ghost
[7:24] made a way for the Holy Ghost itself to
[7:26] come right down in perfection." That's
[7:28] paragraph 136. Now, I want to show you
[7:31] before this quote, Brother Random said
[7:33] there's three different processes, not
[7:35] four different processes. So, you're
[7:37] going to see before this quote and after
[7:39] this quote, Brother Random says three
[7:42] only three processes, only three stages,
[7:45] not four. So before the quote in
[7:47] paragraph 136 if you go up two quotes
[7:50] above that in paragraph 134 brother Ram
[7:53] says stock tassel seed the life that
[7:56] come out of the original seed come up
[7:57] through different processes three
[7:59] different processes he said hallelujah
[8:02] oh my I'm the happiest person in the
[8:04] world that God has let me see this let's
[8:06] listen to the quote
[8:08] &gt;&gt; notice here the life that was in the
[8:11] stalk tossle all now ends up in The
[8:16] seed,
[8:18] the life that come out of the original
[8:20] seed, come up through different
[8:22] processes,
[8:24] three different processes, and then
[8:26] turns back to its original condition.
[8:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[8:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, my happiest person in the world that
[8:39] God has let me see this.
[8:43] Watch how perfect the word and these
[8:45] nature works together.
[8:48] &gt;&gt; And then friends, now there's four
[8:50] quotes after the Holy Ghost itself quote
[8:53] where brother Ram says there's only
[8:55] three works of grace. The first is
[8:57] paragraph 138. He says, "How many ever
[9:00] seen a seed of wheat start to grow? See
[9:03] the three stages stalk, tassel, and the
[9:07] pollen." So again, notice right after he
[9:09] says justification, sanctification,
[9:10] baptism, Holy Ghost, Holy Ghost itself,
[9:12] which looks like four, but it's not
[9:14] four. Brother Ram says, "See the three
[9:16] stages." Let's listen to the quote.
[9:19] &gt;&gt; And anybody, how many ever seen a seed
[9:21] of wheat start to grow? What's the first
[9:23] little thing? It's just exact like the
[9:25] seed, but it's a husk. See the three
[9:28] stages? Stalk, tsel, or the pollen. than
[9:33] the husk. And then out of the husk comes
[9:36] the original seed.
[9:39] &gt;&gt; Not a seed. It was the life of the seed
[9:42] growing through this
[9:44] to come to the seed.
[9:50] &gt;&gt; Do you see it? What is it? A
[9:51] resurrection.
[9:54] &gt;&gt; Coming back to a masterpiece again like
[9:57] the one that went in.
[9:59] Then a few paragraphs later in paragraph
[10:02] 152, brother Ram said, "But remember
[10:04] after the husk, that's three stages we
[10:06] know of. There's nothing else left but
[10:07] the grain." So again, not four stages,
[10:09] three stages. Let's listen to the quote.
[10:12] &gt;&gt; And when Pentecost saw it, they sounded
[10:14] a trumpet. It's time for the return of
[10:17] the gifts. See what they did? They
[10:19] sounded trumpet and out they come. Then
[10:21] they organized.
[10:22] But remember, after the husk, that's
[10:25] three stages we know of, there's nothing
[10:27] else left but the grain.
[10:29] &gt;&gt; Oh God.
[10:32] &gt;&gt; And then the grain is put out of all of
[10:34] it.
[10:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[10:39] &gt;&gt; Seed words begins to form itself. Life
[10:42] is brought forth out of. Now notice if
[10:46] the bridegroom
[10:49] the beginning the first bridegroom this
[10:51] is a bride coming forth.
[10:54] Then friends in the next paragraph 153
[10:57] brother Ram says that it went from that
[10:59] organization it went into another
[11:01] organization went into another stage of
[11:03] the word justification sanctification
[11:05] baptism of the Holy Ghost. So again he
[11:07] lists three not four. Let's listen to
[11:10] the quote.
[11:11] &gt;&gt; Remember the church began at Pentecost.
[11:15] And it fell at Naa.
[11:18] It sprouted not like the real grain. No,
[11:22] it was some of the life in there, but it
[11:23] sprouted in order to make an
[11:25] organization. And it pulled through that
[11:27] organization.
[11:29] And then what did it do? Then it went
[11:30] from that organization, it went into
[11:32] another organization, went into another
[11:35] stage of the word, justification,
[11:36] sanctification, baptism of the Holy
[11:38] Ghost. See, and as it went through this
[11:40] stalking process, it kept coming on
[11:42] more.
[11:44] And then finally in paragraph 160,
[11:46] brother Ram says, "The bride is smitten
[11:48] from the church because she is the word.
[11:50] There is your stages again. One, two,
[11:53] three." See, just exactly. So again,
[11:55] brother Ram says, "Exactly three stages,
[11:58] not four stages." Let's listen to the
[12:00] quote.
[12:01] &gt;&gt; She is smitten from the church, from the
[12:04] church body. Smitten with her master for
[12:07] the same purpose. She's the word. The
[12:10] same as Joseph is smitten from his
[12:12] brethren because he was the word. And
[12:15] Jesus is smitten from his brethren
[12:17] because he was the word. The church is
[12:19] smitten. The bride is smitten from the
[12:22] church because she is the word.
[12:24] &gt;&gt; There's your stages again. 1 2 3.
[12:28] &gt;&gt; In closing,
[12:31] friends, hope this video was a blessing
[12:32] by the grace of God. I want you to know
[12:34] friends, this is not a I'm smarter than
[12:37] you video. I'm trying to be humble. I'm
[12:39] trying to stand for the original faith
[12:41] that was once delivered to the saints,
[12:42] the three works of grace. This video is
[12:45] made in love. It's made as a warning. Of
[12:47] course, whenever I address false
[12:49] doctrine, I rarely call the preachers's
[12:51] name. I don't like to call the
[12:52] preacher's name, but I do want to give
[12:54] warnings and try to help people by the
[12:56] grace of God. And as I said earlier,
[12:58] there was two preachers that talked
[13:00] about this quote and misused it. The
[13:02] first said, "There's four works of
[13:03] grace." I haven't heard any other
[13:05] sermons that preacher preached, but this
[13:07] other brother from Africa, I've heard
[13:09] numerous sermons he's preached. And he's
[13:12] using this quote from the masterpiece to
[13:15] say that the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[13:17] today is not the same as it was in Acts
[13:19] chapter 2. He's trying to preach a Holy
[13:22] Ghost that does not have any emotion or
[13:25] any sensation. And friends, I know we're
[13:28] not looking for emotion. I know we're
[13:29] not looking for sensation, but the Holy
[13:32] Ghost always has emotion. It always has
[13:34] sensation. When a person's soul is being
[13:37] born again, brother Ram said, could you
[13:39] imagine a baby being born and the mother
[13:41] not know it? At the instant of receiving
[13:44] the Holy Ghost or the baptism of the
[13:47] Holy Ghost,
[13:49] is there a difference? Does a person
[13:52] speak with tongues? If not
[13:56] always, what manifestation is known?
[14:01] Well,
[14:04] could you imagine a mother giving birth
[14:08] to a baby and not knowing it?
[14:11] She'd have to be unconscious
[14:14] not to know it.
[14:17] Neither can you receive the Holy Ghost
[14:20] without knowing it.
[14:22] There's something takes place in you.
[14:24] See, there's something that changes you.
[14:28] Your whole system, your whole spiritual
[14:31] system is made new again. And you become
[14:35] a new creature in Christ. As the Bible
[14:37] puts it, a new creation in Christ. You
[14:41] know it.
[14:42] &gt;&gt; So friends, I feel burdened about this
[14:44] second preacher. He has said something
[14:46] like this. Now, I couldn't find it where
[14:48] I heard it, but I heard him say, "You're
[14:50] not just an amateur god. You're God."
[14:53] Friends, that's bride pride. That's
[14:56] bride worship. That's exalting human
[14:58] beings. We are not God. We are the
[15:01] offspring of God. We're the sons and
[15:03] daughters of God. But this man plainly
[15:06] said, "We are not amateur gods." I don't
[15:08] even like to use that terminology as far
[15:10] as amateur gods because you won't find
[15:11] that in the Bible. I know the word of
[15:14] God came to gods. the Bible said and as
[15:16] Jesus said, but that's referring to
[15:18] prophets and and not all of us are
[15:20] prophets. And if you look at the Hebrew
[15:23] meaning of that word, it's judges or
[15:25] rulers. Well, that makes sense. The word
[15:27] gods then would be just judges or
[15:29] rulers. The word of God came to the
[15:31] judges. The word of God came to the
[15:33] rulers, the human judges and rulers that
[15:35] God placed on this earth. And then this
[15:37] preacher from Africa said, quote, "How
[15:39] are you going to be God?" End quote. If
[15:42] petty things bother you and make you
[15:44] question God, like losing a child or a
[15:46] husband, this was a very insensitive
[15:49] statement. It seems like this preacher
[15:51] has never lost a child or never lost a
[15:53] spouse or never suffered any tragedy.
[15:56] It's downplaying the feeling of loss
[15:58] that people go through. And again, it's
[16:01] exalting the church members, the message
[16:04] believers, telling them they are God.
[16:06] And then he went on to say, quote, "The
[16:08] equality of man and God, co-equality
[16:12] that was lost in the beginning." End
[16:14] quote. Friends, that's the original lie
[16:16] from the serpent in the Garden of Eden.
[16:19] This message preacher, as popular as he
[16:22] is, is putting the bride on the same
[16:24] level as God. And that's a sin. That's
[16:27] false doctrine. Again, that's the same
[16:29] lie the serpent told Eve in Genesis 3:es
[16:33] 4 and 5. Ye shall be as gods, knowing
[16:36] good and evil. Friends, I believe in the
[16:39] full baptism of the Holy Ghost in the
[16:41] soul of the believer. I believe we're
[16:43] the offspring of God. I believe we're
[16:44] ambassadors for God, as second
[16:47] Corinthians tells us. I believe we're
[16:49] one with God. In other words, the same
[16:50] spirit, the same nature, but we only
[16:53] have a measure of the Holy Ghost. Jesus
[16:56] Christ has the fullness of the Holy
[16:58] Ghost. We are not equal to the Lord
[17:01] Jesus Christ. The servant is not equal
[17:03] to his master. As the Lord Jesus Christ
[17:06] said himself, the servant is not greater
[17:09] than the master. The Lord Jesus Christ
[17:11] is the master. And again, friends, this
[17:14] preacher from Africa, he's attacking
[17:16] Acts chapter 2. I've heard numerous
[17:18] sermons where he attacks emotion,
[17:20] experience, gifts. He's inbalanced. And
[17:23] as I showed on my last video in the
[17:25] middle of the road, he is very far on
[17:27] the side of intellect, which is a very
[17:30] sad place to be in. and he might even be
[17:32] off in the grass in the foolish virgin
[17:34] area. Brother Ram said the Holy Ghost
[17:36] will give the same sensation, the same
[17:38] signs, the same wonders, the same
[17:39] experience. Today, we get the same
[17:42] baptism of the Holy Ghost they received
[17:44] on the day of Pentecost. And that is
[17:46] enough. It's the fullness of Pentecost
[17:48] in the bride. Let's listen to a quote
[17:50] where brother M says this. The same Holy
[17:52] Ghost, same experience, same sensation.
[17:55] &gt;&gt; And now it's right to bring him back
[17:58] exactly like he was at the beginning.
[18:00] Amen.
[18:00] &gt;&gt; The same ministry, the same Jesus,
[18:03] &gt;&gt; the same power, the same Holy Ghost, the
[18:06] same one that come down on the day of
[18:08] Pentecost is the same Holy Ghost that's
[18:11] manifested today
[18:13] &gt;&gt; from glory to glory to glory and back to
[18:16] its original seat with the baptism of
[18:18] the Holy Ghost with the same signs, same
[18:20] wonders, same baptism, same kind of
[18:23] people acting the same way with the same
[18:24] power, the same sensation. It's from
[18:27] glory unto glory. and the next will be
[18:30] changed from this glory into a body like
[18:33] his own glorious body where we shall see
[18:35] him.
[18:37] &gt;&gt; Friends, we must earnestly contend for
[18:38] the faith that was once delivered to the
[18:40] saints. The enemy creeps in unawares and
[18:42] just brings slight changes to the gospel
[18:45] of the Lord Jesus Christ, slight changes
[18:48] to the message of the hour, and even
[18:49] uses quotes from our prophet to try to
[18:52] change the Bible truths. But that's why
[18:54] the Bible said, "Prove all things."
[18:56] That's why brother said, "Test me by the
[18:57] scripture." That's why brother Ram said
[18:59] the Bible is the absolute and God's
[19:02] absolute is the Bible. You'll never find
[19:04] four works of grace in the Bible. People
[19:06] try to find it in different areas. As we
[19:08] said, they try to create it in their own
[19:10] minds. But if you look at the overall
[19:13] picture of the Bible and the quotes from
[19:14] brother Brandham, there's only three
[19:16] works of grace. Friends, if you're not
[19:18] born again, repent of your sins. Be
[19:20] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[19:22] Christ. Continue serving God faithfully
[19:25] in a local home church. God will
[19:27] sanctify your life. That means purify
[19:29] your life, cleanse your life. You'll
[19:31] start living separate and sanctified
[19:33] from the world. You get your new heart
[19:36] from justification, new spirit from
[19:38] sanctification. Your daily thoughts and
[19:40] habits will change, be more holy, and
[19:42] then God will give you the baptism of
[19:44] the Holy Ghost in your soul. In Ezekiel
[19:46] 36, it's called my spirit. So God gives
[19:48] you a new heart, a new spirit of your
[19:50] own, and then God's spirit. If you have
[19:53] any questions, concerns, or testimonies
[19:55] about this video, please contact me.
[19:58] God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[20:00] the desire of your heart.
[20:03] &gt;&gt; Very happy to be here this afternoon and
[20:05] again in defense of the gospel of Jesus
[20:08] Christ to bring the good tidings, the
[20:11] good news that Jesus raised from the
[20:13] dead, living among man today, his
[20:15] church. The same Jesus that was
[20:18] yesterday will be today and forever
[20:21] is never failed.
