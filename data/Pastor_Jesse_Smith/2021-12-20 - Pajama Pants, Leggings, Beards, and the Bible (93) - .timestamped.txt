[0:00] [Music]
[0:06] greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:09] of the lord jesus christ
[0:11] recently i've been asked three questions
[0:13] about modesty and the outward appearance
[0:16] and i did not address these areas in my
[0:18] 2019 book restoring christian modesty
[0:22] the three questions are
[0:24] should women wear pajama pants to bed
[0:27] number two should women wear leggings
[0:30] and number three should men grow beards
[0:34] here are my answers on these three
[0:36] questions
[0:37] as i'm desiring to rightly divide the
[0:39] word of truth through prayer fasting
[0:43] searching the bible and searching
[0:45] brother graham's quotes on these
[0:47] subjects
[0:48] and as always i'm open to correction if
[0:51] i'm wrong on these things
[0:53] question number one should women wear
[0:55] pajama pants to bed
[0:57] friends i believe the bible-based answer
[0:59] is no women should not wear pajama pants
[1:02] to bed
[1:03] the main reason why not is because it
[1:06] creates a double standard
[1:08] and allows women to cross-dress
[1:10] but not the men
[1:12] now of course you would think why would
[1:13] a man want to wear
[1:15] a woman's bra or woman's skirt to bed
[1:19] there would be no reason to
[1:21] that sounds ridiculous
[1:23] but that same thought should be applied
[1:24] to the women as well it should be
[1:26] considered ridiculous
[1:28] or completely unnecessary for women to
[1:31] wear pajama pants
[1:33] men's garments to bed at night
[1:36] now of course there is a quote from
[1:37] brother branham on this from 1964 so
[1:40] let's listen to this
[1:42] i'd like to ask the question number one
[1:45] is
[1:46] ladies
[1:47] pajamas i'll wait to see let me read it
[1:50] pertaining to a man
[1:57] is the ladies pajamas pertaining to
[2:00] man's garments
[2:06] don't tell me they can't ask you some
[2:08] burgers
[2:10] i don't know
[2:13] i'm just gonna let you do the side of
[2:15] that you shouldn't be praying around
[2:17] before people with them all i know that
[2:19] so that would be but in the uh going to
[2:22] bed i
[2:24] i don't know
[2:26] i'm gonna have to back up on that one
[2:27] too i told you to be honest if i didn't
[2:29] know i'm not gonna put my own thought
[2:30] about it
[2:31] all right if you let you want my own
[2:32] thought if you want that i'll tell you
[2:35] now remember it isn't it this ca this
[2:37] could be a million miles wrong i think
[2:39] it looked nice to have a nightgown
[2:42] but if you're
[2:43] but uh it's just up to you now i can't i
[2:45] can't tell you that because i couldn't
[2:46] back it up now that's that's that's me
[2:48] not him remember
[2:52] notice friends after listening to the
[2:54] quote that
[2:55] a lot of people that allow women to wear
[2:56] pants
[2:57] are turning down brother branham's
[2:59] suggestion
[3:00] which his suggestion
[3:02] was for women to wear nightgowns or
[3:04] skirts or dresses to bed
[3:07] and notice also brother bram
[3:08] specifically said
[3:10] it would be wrong for a woman to parade
[3:12] around in men's garments well the same
[3:15] would be true for men it would always be
[3:17] wrong for men to parade around in
[3:19] women's garments
[3:21] so friends my question is
[3:23] have the people that allow women to wear
[3:25] pants to bed
[3:27] have they prayed about it fasted about
[3:29] it and saw god's face regarding this if
[3:32] they did i believe they would find the
[3:33] same conclusion that i've come to that
[3:36] if you allow a woman to wear men's
[3:38] garments to bed then you have to allow
[3:39] the men to wear women's garments to bed
[3:42] as well
[3:43] of course i believe that would be an
[3:44] abomination deuteronomy 22 verse 5
[3:47] plainly says it's an abomination to
[3:49] cross-dress
[3:51] so i believe the wisdom of god would
[3:53] teach us to never cross-dress at any
[3:55] time for any purpose
[3:58] question number two should women wear
[4:01] leggings
[4:02] my answer to this question is i think it
[4:05] is acceptable for women to wear leggings
[4:07] as long as their dress or skirt
[4:10] is modest enough
[4:11] what i mean by that is the dress or
[4:13] skirt should not be too tight
[4:15] and it should also be past the knee down
[4:17] to the shin as i taught in my 2019 book
[4:21] restoring christian modesty
[4:23] remember the scriptures say that the
[4:25] thigh's nakedness
[4:27] the belly the breast
[4:29] and i would leave all the way up to the
[4:30] shoulders is nakedness so christian
[4:32] women should cover from the shoulder to
[4:35] the shin
[4:36] as i wrote in the 2019 book
[4:38] and i say this with no mouse in my heart
[4:41] i've been criticized because sisters in
[4:43] our church wear leggings and there's a
[4:45] couple reasons for that
[4:46] the first reason is that leggings do not
[4:49] pertain to men
[4:50] leggings are not men's garments
[4:54] leggings are equivalent to pantyhose or
[4:56] tights
[4:57] and men in our church and the men that i
[4:59] know
[5:00] that believe this message
[5:02] do not wear tights or pantyhose or
[5:05] leggings
[5:07] so the first reason is very sound to me
[5:09] and it lines up with deuteronomy 22 5.
[5:12] leggings are not men's garments
[5:14] and also if you condemn leggings
[5:16] on women then you have to condemn
[5:18] pantyhose or tights on little children
[5:22] and i do not see how anyone could
[5:24] condemn a little baby girl wearing
[5:26] tights underneath her dress or skirt in
[5:29] wintertime
[5:30] tights leggings pantyhose
[5:33] are garments of women or girls and they
[5:36] help keep our sisters warmer during
[5:39] these very cold months of the winter
[5:40] time
[5:42] a second reason leggings are okay is
[5:44] because they don't make the woman
[5:45] immodest
[5:47] now i have heard how some sisters in the
[5:49] message
[5:50] are wearing shorter skirts above the
[5:52] knee
[5:53] and wearing leggings underneath
[5:55] i believe that's an immodest thing to do
[5:58] it's presenting the thigh and the knee
[5:59] which the bible calls nakedness
[6:02] exposing the thigh is nakedness
[6:04] according to isaiah 47 verses 1-3
[6:08] come down and sit in the dust o virgin
[6:11] daughter babylon sit on the ground there
[6:14] is no throne o daughter of the chaldeans
[6:17] for thou shalt no more be called tender
[6:20] and delicate
[6:21] take the millstones and grind the meal
[6:24] uncover thy locks make bear the leg
[6:27] uncover the thigh pass over the rivers
[6:30] thy nakedness shall be uncovered yea thy
[6:33] shame shall be seen
[6:34] i will take vengeance and i will not
[6:37] meet thee as a man
[6:40] and i believe it exposes that those
[6:41] sisters that do that
[6:43] may have a spirit of lust upon them
[6:46] because they are exposing body parts
[6:48] that should never be exposed
[6:50] and of course i know they're covered in
[6:51] tights but you can still see the outline
[6:54] of their thigh as leggings are skin
[6:56] tight
[6:57] and loose clothing is commanded by the
[6:59] word of god
[7:01] so for these two reasons i believe it's
[7:03] acceptable for our sisters to wear
[7:04] leggings because they are not
[7:07] men's garments and they help keep her
[7:09] warm in the winter time as long as she's
[7:11] dressed modestly as well and not
[7:14] exposing her thighs or body parts that
[7:17] are considered nakedness
[7:19] question number three should new
[7:21] testament men grow beards
[7:24] this is an honest and sincere question
[7:27] my answer is no i do not believe new
[7:29] testament men are required to wear
[7:31] beards
[7:32] i believe beard wearing was an old
[7:34] testament custom
[7:36] like other old testament customs
[7:38] that new testament gentiles do not have
[7:40] to follow
[7:42] without a doubt beard wearing was an
[7:44] important old testament custom as god
[7:47] had moses put beard wearing into the law
[7:50] recorded in leviticus
[7:52] but even in the law beard cutting was
[7:54] permitted at times such as when a man
[7:55] was cleansed from leprosy or when he was
[7:58] mourning and other times
[8:01] also the law never said if a man cut his
[8:03] beard it was an abomination
[8:06] so beard cutting was not on the same
[8:08] level as crossdressing
[8:10] remember that deuteronomy 22 5 labels
[8:12] cross-dressing as an abomination which
[8:15] is why some christians today abstain
[8:17] from cross-dressing
[8:19] i'll leave a link to my video about
[8:21] abominations in the description below
[8:24] christian men today then have the
[8:26] liberty to wear beards but i do not
[8:28] believe the new testament requires all
[8:30] christian men to wear beards
[8:34] there are 19 mentions of beards in the
[8:36] scripture they're all in the old
[8:38] testament i could not find any new
[8:40] testament mentions
[8:42] the first three deal with cleansing from
[8:44] leprosy
[8:46] one mentions a lion's beard
[8:48] another is david's beard
[8:51] two important scriptures are leviticus
[8:53] 19 27 and leviticus 21 5
[8:56] and they say priests and israeli men are
[8:59] not to round their corners of their
[9:01] beards like the heathen three mentions
[9:03] david's men were disgraced by their
[9:05] beards being cut off mephibosheth had an
[9:09] untrim beard likely not grooming himself
[9:12] because of grief
[9:13] joab grabbed a mesa's beard in a fall
[9:16] show of friendship and then murdered him
[9:19] ezekiel plucked his beard after hearing
[9:21] israelis mingle their seed with the
[9:22] heathens
[9:24] oil on aaron's beard was a sign of unity
[9:26] among the brethren
[9:28] three more examples again show the
[9:30] disgrace of a shaved beard and then god
[9:32] tells ezekiel to shave his beard as a
[9:34] sign to israel
[9:36] the reason i believe beard wearing was
[9:38] just an old testament custom was because
[9:40] an old testament believer
[9:42] joseph a man who typed christ
[9:45] was exalted to second command in egypt
[9:48] and he had to shave his face
[9:50] in order to be a ruler in egypt this is
[9:53] found in genesis 41 verse 14 then
[9:56] pharaoh sent and called joseph and they
[9:58] brought him hastily out of the dungeon
[10:00] and he shaved himself and changed his
[10:02] raiment and came in unto pharaoh
[10:05] this proves a holy man a believer who
[10:08] lives so close to god that he even was a
[10:10] type of jesus christ
[10:11] was uncondemned by god with a shaved
[10:13] face
[10:15] we also find with joseph that he was
[10:16] given a ring for his hand and a gold
[10:19] chain about his neck
[10:20] and in my 2019 book about modesty i use
[10:23] this as an example again
[10:25] of how rings are acceptable because
[10:27] joseph was allowed to wear a ring as
[10:29] long as the purpose behind the ring is a
[10:32] godly purpose such as for work in
[10:34] joseph's case or for believers as a sign
[10:38] of the eternal marriage vow between a
[10:40] man and a woman
[10:42] if you condemn wearing rings wearing
[10:44] necklaces or shaving the face
[10:47] then you've got to condemn joseph as
[10:49] well
[10:50] but of course we know he's not condemned
[10:52] by god
[10:53] he's a forgiven child of god a man who
[10:56] lived extremely close to god so much so
[10:58] that he was a type of jesus christ
[11:01] in closing
[11:02] i hope this video has been a blessing on
[11:04] these three questions again i think
[11:06] they're excellent questions and i've
[11:08] done my best by the grace of god to
[11:09] rightly divide the word of truth using
[11:11] scripture and the quotes from our
[11:13] prophet brother william branham
[11:15] i encourage everyone to fast and pray
[11:17] about these questions
[11:19] consider the ramifications or effects of
[11:22] your choices
[11:24] i believe if you seek god with prayer
[11:26] and fasting on these subjects as i have
[11:28] i believe you'll come to very similar
[11:30] conclusions by the grace of god
[11:32] if you have any questions concerns or
[11:34] testimonies about this video please
[11:36] contact me
[11:37] [Music]
[11:39] god bless you and may jesus christ be
[11:41] the desire of your heart
