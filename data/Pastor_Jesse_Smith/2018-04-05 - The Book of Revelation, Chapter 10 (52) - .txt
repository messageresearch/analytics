TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] Revelation chapter 10 the theme of this chapter is the open book coming to the earth to finish the mystery of God and to be prophesied to the entire world this open book was the same book that was formerly sealed with seven seals as described earlier in chapters five six and eight the symbols and key revelations include the mighty angel the little open book the cry with a loud voice as a lion's roar the seven thunders the seventh angel the eating of The Little Book and the command for John to prophesy again to the entire world the mighty angel is a symbol of Christ Jesus coming down to earth as verse 1 gives descriptions of Christ that matched previous descriptions of Christ in chapter 1 verses 15 and 16 the little open book is that the mysteries of all seven seals are now to be revealed upon the earth Christ has come down to reveal the identity of the four horse riders the souls under the altar the day of wrath and the silence in heaven at the moment of the rapture the cry with a loud voice as a lion's roar is a symbol of God speaking through a prophet as seen in Amos chapter 3 verses 7 and 8 so the Bible foretold that Christ would reveal the mystery of the seven seals to a prophet on the earth Amos 3:7 surely the Lord God will do nothing but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets the lion hath roared who will not fear the Lord God hath spoken who can but prophesy the seven thunders are symbols of the voice of God as taught in Psalms 18 verse 13 Psalms 29 verses three to eleven and John 12 verses 28 and 29 we can see that Christ would speak through a prophet and that a prophets teaching on the seven seals from the open book would be thus saith the Lord the voice of God spoken on the earth the seventh angel is a symbol of an earthly man as taught in Galatians 4:14 First Samuel 29 verse 9 second Samuel 1927 and Revelation chapter 22 verses 8 and 9 so this seventh angel is both the seventh angel of the Laodicean Church H revelation 3:14 and he is the Prophet Christ spoke through as a lion in Revelation 10 verse 3 we believe this profit and seventh angel was william branham whose Bible teachings from the Holy Spirit finished the mystery of God the eating of this little book is a symbol of believing and obeying the truths that Christ spoke in his revelations on the seven seals according to first Peter 2:2 and Matthew 4:4 and Matthew 5 verse 6 the command for John to prophesy again to the entire world is a symbol of the New Testament church or Bride of Christ taking the open book and it's revelations and spreading the truth around the world finishing the Great Commission that Jesus spoke of in Matthew 28 verses 19 and 20 John symbolizes the New Testament church because he was called to come up hither into heaven in Revelation 4 verse 1 immediately after the 7 Church Ages of Revelation chapters 2 and 3 which is exactly what will happen to the Bride of Christ at the rapture as spoken of by Saint Paul in 1st Thessalonians chapter 4 verses 13 through 18 the timing of events in this chapter is as follows our conviction is that Christ came down to earth utter the seven thunders or revelations of the seven seals through his prophet William Branham in 1963 william branham preached these revelations with thus sayeth the Lord in March of 1963 so we believe revelation 10 verses one to seven is fulfilled and in the past we believe verses eight through eleven which is the command for John to prophesy the open book of the revealed seven seals is being fulfilled right now in the present time this is because John represents the true New Testament church and her preachers are prophesying again or sharing the prophecies that God gave to William Branham in regards to the seven seals and the Bible to many people's nations tongues and kings if you'd like more bible scriptures quotations or if you have any questions about the book of Revelation please contact us god bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music] you
