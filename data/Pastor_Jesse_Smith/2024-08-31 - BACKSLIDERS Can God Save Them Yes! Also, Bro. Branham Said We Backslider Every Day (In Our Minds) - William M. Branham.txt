TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] remember you backside every day there no way at all for you keep out of it but Paul had to die every day is that right he had to die every day repent every day and just constantly repenting all the time see and if Paul had to do that then I'm going to have you too aren't you greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to answer a viewer's question about can God save a backslider I believe the Bible answer is yes and so that's what this video will be about by the grace of God hi friends I'm Jesse Smith pastor bride of Christ Fellowship here in akronohio USA and I defend the original Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ that he revealed to St Paul and then had to restore through Martin Luther John Wesley and the late Prophet William Marian brandham who lived from 1909 to 1965 I also defend brother Ram's Godly Christian character here's a screenshot of the viewer's question hello Pastor can God save a back slider I want to know something about this topic thank you so my answer is yes God says he will save a backslider or the word he uses is heal them if they bring forth fruits of repentance in returning to him this is a wonderful topic I don't think I've ever preached an actual sermon on backsliding so Lord willing I'll probably do that soon here uh by the grace of God this has been a wonderful study there are two Old Testament scriptures that literally say God will heal backsliding so let's look at those here here first is Jeremiah 3:22 it says return ye backsliding children and I will heal your backslidings behold we come unto thee for thou art the Lord Our God so there's one witness and Hosea 14:4 is the second witness it says I will heal their backsliding I will love them freely for mine anger is turned away from him so before getting into the full context of these scriptures let's define backslide in the Hebrew it means to turn away apostate now that's the Old Testament definition in the New Testament the word backslide is not used as far as I can tell throughout my studies another phrase the New Testament uses for backsliding is turning away or falling away or let away we see falling away which means turning away in Luke 88:13 2 Thessalonians 2:3 and Hebrews 66 and then we see leway in 2 Peter 3:17 so I want to share two things here the first is that the Bible definition of backsliding is very very serious this means backsliding in the Bible are major sins when people turn away from worshiping God to worshiping Idols this is called of course spiritual fornication as seen in Revelation 17 the mother Harlot is committing fornication with all the nations how does a church commit fornication with a nation its spiritual fornication so anytime a person or in this case the Roman Catholic Church disobeys God and enjoys the pleasures of sin they're kiding they're committing spiritual fornication or backsliding from God now second thing about backsliding I want to say is that those who follow the message the bible-based message of God's Prophet William Brandon will know that brother random said we backslide every day so in the Bible backsliding is very serious and those are major sins in the Bible but brother Brandon makes a statement that we backslide every day and this must mean in our minds so we backslide in minor sins every day so again remember remember there's major and minor sins I did a video on that recently so I'll leave a link to that in the description so when the Bible talks about backsliding it's major idolatry major sins in this one quote from 1954 brother Bram says we backslide every day he's speaking of minor sins what brother brand was talking about is that in our thoughts we backslide every day or we Harbor evil thoughts at least at one point it seems almost every day and this is scriptural because Paul said he had to Die daily in 1 Corinthians 15 and then he said all Christians should be renewed day by day in the spirit of their minds and have a daily transformed mind we get that thought from three verses Ephesians 4:23 2 Corinthians 4:16 and Romans 12: 1 and 2 here's the quote from 1954 brother Ram says remember you backslide every day there's no way at all for you to keep out of it so he must be referring to the mind the human mind that needs daily renewed and then he cites 1 Corinthians 15 where Paul said he had to die every day and he said if Paul had to do that then I'm going to have to too aren't you let's listen to the quote I know where got on backside I I wish somebody was going to ask me that but on backside remember you backside every day there no way at all for you keep out of it all right but you backside to the people in the church but not before God see you backside on Christ but you don't on God because if you when you sin you're gone but uh you constantly falling Paul had to die every day is that right he had to die every day repent every day and just constantly repenting all the time see and if Paul had to do that then I'm going to have to too aren't you that's right so we but now if you've been um if you've been redeemed and you feel that the the blood of Jesus Christ cleansed you from sin then I I and you've lived a Christian Life I I wouldn't think it be necessary but if you want to all right it'll be fine we'll be glad to do it now with that differentiation between backsliding into major sins and then the different sin of backsliding just in our minds every day let's look at Old Testament verses on backsliding there are 16 of them I'm not going to go through all them as I study them I just tried to pull out the ones that I felt would help us gain the best understanding from the holy spirit so the first is Jeremiah 3 it's verses 20- 25 verse 20 says surely as a wife treacherously departeth from her husband so have ye dealt treacherously with with me oh House of Israel sayith the Lord and down in verse 32 it says return ye backsliding children and I will heal your backslidings now verse 21 shows they were doing idolatry in the high places a voice was heard upon the high places and they have forgotten the Lord their God so they were going to worship idols and they had stopped worshiping God and crying out to God so here we learn in Jeremiah 3 backsliding is like a wife leaving her husband to go make love to another man and so we can apply this spiritually to the New Testament and we will discuss a few examples but when a Christian leaves the worship of God and loves the pleasures of sin they've backslidden I want to jump ahead now to Hosea 14 1-4 says oh Israel return unto the Lord thy God for thou has fallen by thine iniquity and I love this portion because it shows how to get healing verse two says take with you words and turn to the Lord and say unto him take away all iniquity and receive us graciously so we will render the calves of our lips so we have these key words here the first word is return which means come back to a certain location get back in Heavenly places so a backl person has left the joy of heavenly places they've gone out in the pleasures of sin they've got to return to there and then the Bible said turn and say so you must confess your sins with your mouth as the Bible says Romans 10:9 says if Thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead Thou shalt be saved so if we're going to return from backsliding we got to get back into Heavenly places turn to God use our words and say I have iniquity receive us graciously receive me graciously I need your grace and this is the sacrifice of our lips the Bible says the calves of our lips in Hosea 14:2 notice it says take away all my iniquity forgive all my sins I'm sorry and I'm guilty for committing all those sins then a backslider must say receive me that connects to 2 Corinthians 6 where God said come out and be separate then I'll receive you so the backslider who's repenting has to leave their pleasures of sin totally separate from them and come back to God and God will receive you and then Hosea 14:3 says a sure shall not save us ashur was an Assyrian God of War so Israel was trusting in a false god to protect them but we know the government won't save us we don't put our trust in government or guns or weapons we put our trust in the Living God and neither will money save us our jobs our social status nothing can save us we have to put our trust in the Lord Jesus Christ and then Hosea 14:4 then I will heal their backsliding I will love them freely and remember Romans chapter 5 there's three times the Bible calls salvation a free gift it's Romans 5:15 Romans 5:116 Romans 5:18 so here we see salvation is a free gift and God says in the New Testament and the Old Testament that salvation is freely given Mercy is freely given if the person will show the fruits of repentance let's look at some more verses here uh Proverbs 14:14 the backslider in heart should be filled with his own ways so a backslider is not interested in the ways of God they're interested in the ways of sin here's a great one Jeremiah 2:19 thine own wickedness shall correct thee and thy backsliding shall reprove thee so this shows the conscience of a backslider will eat at them and tell them their backslidden and this is all because they lost the fear of the Lord this is in Jeremiah 2:19 thou has forsaken the Lord thy God and that my fear is not in thee so this is how a person backslides they don't fear God anymore they think they'll just do whatever they want there'll be no repercussions to their decisions of course that's a lie Galatians 6 says be not deceived God is Not mocked whatever a man SWS that shall he reap here's another powerful scripture Jeremiah 36-8 Israel's backsliding caused God to divorce Israel verse 6 says Israel was backsliding and was gone up on every high mountain playing the Harlot in idolatry and then in verse eight I had put her away and given her a bill of divorce but then God shows his Mercy in Jeremiah 3:12 through1 14 he invites her to return thou backsliding Israel for I am merciful sayith the Lord I will not keep anger forever only acknowledge thine iniquity he said you have not obeyed my voice sayith the Lord turn oh backsliding children for I'm married unto you so again we see these requirements for a backslider in order to be received by God they have to return leave their sin return to the ways of God acknowledge their sin acknowledge they have not obeyed and begin obeying the voice of God Jeremiah 8: 4-7 gives us a look at Israel being called a Perpetual backslider this is because in verse 5 they hold fast deceit they refuse to return so a Perpetual backslider refuses to return to God and then in verse 6 it says they run into sin like a horse rushes into the battle and the perpetual backslider repenteth not of his wickedness and they do not say what have I done Jeremiah 49: 4 and five shows how backsliders are trusting in riches and not God of course there could be some other sin but this is one example with Israel oh backsliding daughter that trusted in her riches God said because you trusted in riches I'm going to bring fear upon you in verse 5 backsliding is also connected to idolatry in Hosea 4:16-17 Israel slth back as a backsliding hepher Ephraim is joined to Idols let him alone brother random said that Solomon backslid because of Idols so we see that connection here in Hosea 4:16-17 Solomon probably started this process for Israel and then it just grew and grew and grew so let's listen to this quote from 1957 then Jesus came brother Bram said Solomon backslid and turn to Idols let's listen to the quote and if God would do that for a man who looked at a Earthly temple built by an Earthly man who later backslid and turned to Idol if God would honor that man because he believed in the prayer of Solomon how much more will he honor your prayer tonight who don't have to look to your symptom or anything around you but look at heaven where he sit in the presence of God with his own blood as an intercession for your sins as he intercedes and then a final scripture from the Old Testament Hosea 11:7 my people are bent to backsliding from me none at all would exalt him so here we see backsliders do not truly worship God now they might go to church but they're not really worshiping God their love and adoration is for an idol they're not worshiping in spirit and Truth as John 4:23 and 24 States now briefly let's look at the New Testament now the New Testament doesn't say the word backsliding it uses the words falling away or let away and you might remember from 2022 I made a video about 13 metaphors for backsliding they are shipped wrecked Waring against God falling away or deserting or running away that's the one that relates to this video that would be the same meaning as backsliding because it's turning away or leaving God fourth offended or stumbled fifth is cutting off or cast forth sixth is Cast Away seven is returning back to Sodom eight is itching ears nine is hardening heart 10th is crucifying Jesus aresh 11 is trampling underfoot the Son of God 12 is entangled again and the 13th metaphor is uprooted or plucked up now the few I want to look at are second Peter 3:17 and 18 Peter said Beware lest ye also being led away with the heir of the wicked fall from your own steadfastness so here are these words LED away means falling away it's the same as backsliding now steadfastness is a firm condition a steadfastness of mind so here we see a backslide in the New Testament can backslide in their mind and they're no longer thinking on the things of God no longer trusting in God but they're LED away from thinking about God and thinking about evil things now a few examples of major backsliding I think would be 1 Corinthians 5 the man fornicating with his stepmother this man was so proud of his sin so deep in idolatry to fornication course it's spiritual idolatry with fornication that Paul said deliver him over to the devil for the destruction of his flesh that his Spirit might be saved now it seems like he got healed from this there's two portions in 2 Corinthians where it looks like maybe this man was forgiven some people think it's 2 Corinthians 2 1-11 but Paul doesn't mention this man specifically as far as I can tell but the main thing from this passage is the Believers are told to love and comfort the man man who's repented so he doesn't over sorrow or sorrow too much Paul said Satan could get advantage of him and make him swallowed up in sorrow he could get so embarrassed for his sins that he would think there's no hope for him to be restored but Paul said Comfort them show them love so that's one thing we got to remember with backsliders we have to show them love and encourage them to get back in Heavenly places and that God will heal them God will restore them in 2 Corinthians 7 8-10 Paul acknowledged that some people repented but again he doesn't necessarily identify the man fornicating from 1 Corinthians 5 the second example that I think might be a major backsliding is Peter and the disciples after Christ was crucified you know Peter denied Christ and then all the disciples were scattered from Jesus except John John went to the Cross everybody else was scattered Peter denied even knew Christ and he even went back to fishing but this type of backsliding happens before a person is born again again Peter did not get the Holy Ghost until acts 2:4 so Peter's backsliding here must be considered before he was born again so there are certain levels like the video on major minor sins there are certain sins a holy ghost filled Christian will not commit it seems the major sins can still be committed by people that are not born again here's a quote from Brother brandham the unveiling of God brother brandham says anything can be an idol people even Believers even Christians can make anything a god brother Bram said you can make a piano a God you can make anything a God and so we know that today people make money a God Jesus said you can't worship God in Mammon God in money either love one hate the other people today in the message sometimes make brother brandom a God that's the Jeffersonville tape worship movement the Press Play and disobey movement is what they do there's other quotes I don't have them right now but brother Ram says you can make your husband or your wife an idol he says you can make your car an idol in fact I did hear that quote recently brother Bram said he never stole anything other than stealing time from God brother said as a sinner he would go wash his car I think wash and wax his car rather than going to church and he said that was stealing from God so let's listen to both those quotes anything can be God the the word God you can make an idol of God you can make that piano of God you can make anything of God I trusted he has forgiven me or I as far as literally stealing anything as I know I never did in my life but I've so misused this time till I stole that way and i' and done many things that I shouldn't do and I'm grateful to God this morning that he has forgiven my sins I remember years ago and I got my first little te- model Ford I was a sinner about 19 and 26 and I would just shine that little thing all day Sunday to make it shine stay home didn't go to church and shine it now what if today I tried to find one piece of that car it's gone you couldn't do it it's finished I think I'll share one more quote from the Third Exodus brother Ram says because his soul was predestinated on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world that Soul can never backslide so again brother Ram says we backslide in our minds every day but if we're born again truly Born Again by the baptism of the Holy Ghost the soul can never backslide let's listen to the quote and remember this election is coming out is this not going to another Nation it's going to Glory where their names are wrote on the Lamb's Book of Life not under the natural little animal lamb that brought Israel out that they could backslide from there and go back but this can't this is under the blood of the Lamb of God that was slain before the foundation of the world and their names were put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world and they're in their elected and when that light flashes over him like that them denominational walls drop away from him here time come out from among them said the holy spirit in these last days touch not their unclean things I'll be God to you you be Sons and Daughters to me in closing friends hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God this is a topic I've never really study through all the way as far as I know so hopefully these scriptures and quotes were a blessing may God help us every day in our minds if we backslide if we turn and think evil thoughts we'll quickly repent of them and get our minds back on the things of God as Peter said to grow in grace and the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ not be led away from our steadfastness but keep our mind steadfastly on the things of God and friends from recent sermons I preached you know in other states and also in our home church I have seen backsliding people come back to God some of these people were actually literally sitting there in the church for months or years backsliding but God brought them back with weeping crying rejoicing praising God confessing sin just like we saw in these backsliding script so God still heals backsliders praise the Lord Jesus Christ that he's rich in Mercy so if you know anyone who may be backslid in or would be encouraged by this video I pray you share it with them as you're led by the Holy Spirit if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
