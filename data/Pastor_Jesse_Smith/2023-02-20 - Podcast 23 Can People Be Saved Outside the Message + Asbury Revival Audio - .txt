TRANSCRIPT
========================================
foreign [Music] God bless you and welcome to the defending the message podcast I'm your co-host Pastor Jesse Smith and today I'm again hosting solo as our precious brother amen has had some health issues lately and he's scheduled to have surgery soon so if you would please keep him in prayer yesterday at church he testified that God was teaching him something through the situation so we rejoice in that but we also Comfort your prayers for our brother to return to complete Health by the grace of our Lord the topic of today's podcast is can people be saved outside the message a few days ago I put out a video about the Asbury Revival in Wilmore Kentucky and there's been a few comments about the Asbury Revival YouTube video it was released February 18 2023 so today's question is can people be saved outside the message I believe the answer is yes and the reason I believe that is because brother Branham taught that through the Holy Bible the scriptures and the scriptures he used were Ephesians 2 verses 8 through 10 and Matthew 25 verses 1 through 13. now of course there could be other scriptures but these are the two that are most clearly seen Ephesians 2 verse 8 says for by grace are ye saved through faith and that is not of yourselves it is a gift of God not of Works us any man should boast for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them so according to the Bible and brother Branham were saved by grace through faith and brother Ram taught salvation is accompanied by three works of Grace justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost so for a person to be justified or declared righteous a person only needs faith in Jesus Christ if they have faith in Jesus Christ they recognize Jesus Christ as the perpetuation of their sins Jesus's death on the cross paid the penalty of their sin debt that they owed and they are given Jesus's righteousness as a gift because all of a person's sins was placed upon Jesus and Jesus Paid the price for their sins this concept is clearly taught in second Corinthians 5 21 for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him and of course this was the main message of Martin Luther justification by faith no one is saved by works brother Branham was not saved by works you and I are not saved by works we are all saved by grace simply repenting of our sins and trusting in the sacrifice of Jesus Christ I'd like to go through some quotes from Brother Branham now that plainly say people can be saved outside of his message the first quote is from January 1961 brother Brandon said trinitarianism is of the devil thus saith the Lord but then he says are all trinitarians of hell he said no sir I believe they are Christians so in this quote we see the Trinity Doctrine is a separate Doctrine from salvation Salvation is something totally different than the godhead Doctrine let's listen to the quote characterianism is not the devil I say that yes [Applause] now do you say then you believe in all these people as three attorneys are of hell no sir I believe they are Christians but the areas approaching brother were they are sincerely wrong [Applause] the next quote is from expectation February 61. brother random said a person is saved if he's Methodist Baptist Catholic if he's solemnly trusting in Jesus Christ for his grace and again he quotes Ephesians 2 verse 8. I believe that a person is saved if he's a Methodist Baptist Catholic or whatever he may be if he's solemnly trusting Jesus Christ for his grace but if he's the Catholic and believing the church saving then he's lost he's a Pentecost and believe in the church saves him he's lost but no matter what he is what church he goes to if he is solemnly depending on the blood and merits of Jesus Christ he's saved I don't care what church he's in or it's by faith or we say that by grace the next quote is from 1961 January 19th brother Ram said he never unchristianized no man or person he said he based if someone is saved on whether they're trusting in Jesus Christ whether they're Catholic Protestant or Jew so notice brother Ram says a Catholic Protestant or Jew could be saved if they're saved their trust in Jesus Christ where they are Catholic Protestant Jew or whatever they are you're saved because you're born of Christ but you've asked me a question in the next quote it's very similar to the previous quote from February 1961. brother Branham again quotes Ephesians 5 verse 8 and says Catholic Protestant Baptist Presbyterian whatever can be saved because he has a personal faith in a finished work that Christ died for us [Music] because [Music] therefore I have never drawn a denominational boundary or had a barrier I've tried to reach out take everyone in my arms and brought them to the cross later on in this podcast from the audio of the YouTube video you'll hear Brother random say during the seals that he believed Catholics Protestants and even Jews could be saved if they're trusting in Jesus for salvation and that's from the seventh seal sermon but now we'll skip ahead to 1964. questions and answers part one brother brand was specifically asked can people be saved that don't believe his message and the way he preaches and he says yes if they believe the Lord what about the people that believe in the Lord now and don't and not the way you preach they don't have to believe this then I'd be the way I preach it see don't have to believe that for the last day message will they be saved yes if they believe the Lord see and if they if they disagree and say I don't believe he's a word I don't believe it this is right I don't believe in the baptism the holy ghost that shows where they're headed for the tribulation period but those who can accept the word in its fullness not me preaching it because it's a Bible say so those who accept that is free because it the word's already been judged not later in that same sermon from questions and answers part 164 brother Branham specifically said he sent three quarters of a million of his converts to the Assemblies of God and said he did not send them to death he said would I be a hypocrite to send my own children to death far be it for me no sir so of course brother brand believed his converts could be saved and still go to dominational churches now of course I know time is Advance we're 57 years since brother Ram's passing and now there are message churches that brother Brown's converts Fellowship in but the scriptural truth brother brand new still pertain to today Ephesians 2 verse 8 through 10 second Corinthians 5 verse 21 Matthew 25 1-13 and as we'll see you soon Matthew 25 verses 31 through 46. there is one quote that's in question this quote was brought up by one of Brothers accusers in the September 2020 debate that I had and he brought up a quote from Brother Branham on the anointed ones at the end time 1965 and brother Branham said a trinitarian would be lost of course I've heard this quote before but this quote goes against all the other quotes that you've already heard so I believe brother Brown was maybe overzealous at this point or maybe brother Brown was just speaking to that one individual he's that he was talking about in this story this Christian scholar who is denying Revelation and maybe this Christian scholar himself was lost but again in this quote brother Randolph says if you believe in a second or third person you're lost I want to point out brother Ram never said this with thus saith the Lord so I believe this is about Abraham's human opinion in that moment I believe he was overzealous because it goes against the previous quotes he'd used even from less than a year earlier in questions and answers part one and as we'll see soon this one quote from the anointed ones at the end time it goes against quotes from his church age book that he really least in December of 65 a few weeks before he passed away and the topic of a church age book could be an entire separate podcast or YouTube video but I believe the church age book was an inspired book not every word in the church age book was thus saith the Lord but there's a lot of solid Bible teaching in the church age book brother Brandon called it a special book he called it his book and he said if there was any light of God in a person they would recognize the truths that are in the church age book but let's first listen to the anointed ones at the end time quote he is the revelation of God the spirit of God revealed in human care person besides God you're alone except you believe that I am he you will die in your sins now the last quotes I'll read are from the church age book The sardisian Church age chapter chapter 7 and I'm just going to read these myself brother Ram said quote now we do not need to guess about those who in the second Resurrection are given life we are told is given to them on the grounds that they have been kind and good to the brethren those who are raised and cast in the Lake of Fire will be so treated because of their mistreatment of the Brethren since this is the word of God we simply accept it there's no argument here just a simple statement of fact end quote and he's referring to Matthew 25 verses 31-46 about Jesus separating the sheep from the goats at the white Throne judgment and he says the saved group of people are not the bride so these are the foolish virgins as he also says in this quote brother Ram goes on to say quote now because of their love of the people of God they are recognized and saved no doubt these served and helped the children of God perhaps like Nicodemus and gameo they stood for the children in a time of trouble end quote and then a few paragraphs down he said quote it is the second Resurrection where in the five foolish virgins come up notice that they were virgins they did not have the Holy Spirit so they missed being in the bride while the five wives who had oil became a part of that bride but these people being a separated god-loving people and trying to abide in the word according to what they knew of it and being a help in the work of the Lord will come up at the end time end quote also there's one more quote that comes to mind brother Branham was a man of Grace he believed for and hope for the grace of God for people in difficult situations and I really appreciate brother Branham for that that's the kind of Minister I want to be as well I never want to compromise on the word of God just like I believe brother Branham did not compromise in the word of God but we want to hope for grace and the quote I'm referring to is from questions and answers part 2 1964. it's question 316. brother Brandon was asked if a man has been married and divorced is that man in his second wife married in God's sight and how can both or one of them be in the rapture brother Ram's answer is very gracious he said it kills me to say that because he said adulterers will not enter the kingdom of God and I want to play the part where brother Brown said there might be a chance of you getting in brother Ram tried to encourage this couple that was living in adultery that God may let them in the Rapture now the Bible is clear only those with the baptism of the Holy Ghost the oil mentioned in the parable of the wise and foolish virgins will go in the Rapture but brother Branham is a man of Grace and he's trying to give them hope to keep serving Jesus Christ live as pure as you can and he says there might be a chance so let's listen to the quote don't don't leave them with children without a home and things like that God has made restitutions and places for people at at uh did things wrong you remember Jesus said David when he was hungry he entered into the temple of God and eats a shoe bread which is only lawful for the priest and it's found blameless a priest also blasphemed the Sabbath upon the Sabbath day and are found blameless and a greater than the Sabbath was here they there uh let's just leave it up to God go ahead and just live the way you just live for Christ now let's see there might be a chance of you getting in don't make do wrongs don't ever writing one just go and live the way you are if you're if you're happy together you might I had the wrong companion I say this one thing if you got the wrong companion this way this life you'll never have it in the other one so please don't misunderstand me I'm not saying adulterers can go in the Rapture I'm just letting you know brother Branham said there might be a chance of adulterers getting in and this shows brother Brown was a man of Grace he believed people in denominations could be saved Catholics Methodist Baptists lutherans even Jews and he said there might even be a chance adulterers could go in the rapture before ending this first part of the podcast I want to look at two comments I had on YouTube the first comment was kind but it criticized me and said the Asbury Revival preaching wasn't preaching the way of Holiness but I would disagree to one extent because if the Asbury Revival is preaching justification by faith that is the first step in the way of Holiness because there's three steps in the way of Holiness justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost now of course not every person in the Asbury Revival and all the other related revivals are getting saved Jesus said only few will find the narrow road that leads to life but I do believe there is a possibility people in that Revival could be getting saved and it will be based upon Ephesians 2 verses 8 through 10 and second Corinthians 5 verse 19 along with all the other scriptures about justification by faith the fact is people don't recognize there's at least six kinds of revivals as I put on the video so the only Revival that could be going on at the Asbury Revival is the Revival of the human Spirit or mind and that's what Ezekiel called a new heart because he said there's three works for the baptism of the Holy Ghost a new heart a new spirit and my spirit the new heart is justification hopefully people at the Asbury Revival are getting a new heart to love Jesus Christ some of them will go a little bit further and get a portion of the new spirit since the Asbury College is a Wesleyan College they will accept some level of sanctification if they're sincere but without the message God gave to brother Branham they'll never get to the third step God's spirit or the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the soul and the second YouTube comment criticized me said I was off the mark But I disagreed of course and I recognize of course Judas is scared did Miracles so Miracles are not proof of a genuine Revival and again not every person in the Revival is likely getting saved like Jesus said probably only a few are getting saved and in this comment the person criticized me and said a person could not get Justified under a trinity Doctrine but in my reply I said the Trinity Doctrine is a different Doctrine it's a separate Doctrine than the doctrine of justification so these are two separate doctrines as long as people are hearing the doctrine of justification at the Revival they could be getting saved if they accept it and I use the quote where brother Ram said trinitarians can be saved he said quote I believe they are Christians end quote so I told the brother I'm going to believe brother Branham rather than you and then I left this brother with numerous quotes that I've already played on this podcast foreign of this portion of the podcast next you'll hear me play the audio from the YouTube video The Asbury Revival a message believer's response plus six kinds of Revival and by God's grace we have so many topics I want to get to I just don't have enough time for it I'm hoping brother amen can join me again soon when his health improves if you follow my blog posts I'd like to do a YouTube video about are you the message and of course we are not the message we're receivers of the message but we're carriers of the message and were one with a message with our souls by the baptism of the Holy Ghost another topic I'd like to look at is racism the racism accusation against brother Branham of course it's a false accusation I've been studying on that and I have a list of almost 40 topics I'd like to cover so I want to quickly get out this podcast I hope it's a blessing to you and now here's the audio from the Asbury Revival video I agree disagree with the Baptist but the Presbyterians and their systems but in there there's genuine Christians greetings friends in the mattress name of the Lord Jesus Christ purpose of this video is to answer a viewer's question about the Asbury Revival that's going on in Wilmore Kentucky so as message believers who follow the bible-based revelations that God gave to his Prophet William Branham what should be our reaction to this so-called Revival by God's grace our reaction should be to examine it by the word of God and hope that some people are genuinely getting saved which means justified by the Holy Ghost and hopefully by God's grace some are getting partial sanctification by the Holy Ghost as well which we'll explain in this short video I'll begin with what is the Revival and what is it producing on February 8th of this year 2023 at a chapel service at the University of Asbury in Wilmore Kentucky college students stayed after the service and kept worshiping and apparently seeking God and praying repenting of sins and this service has never stopped it's been ongoing for about 11 days if I'm not mistaken by the grace of God there's lots of videos online that you can see about this revival there's testimonies of people repenting of their sins there's also testimonies of physical healings there's lots of worship and praise going on and it's possible that even one demon was cast out in these meetings now if these are genuine works of the Holy Spirit then as a message believer I would Rejoice if people are genuinely getting saved repenting of their sin drawing closer to God and if a demon was cast out I would rejoice in that as well remember friends even David cast out demons out of Saul in the Old Testament and while Jesus was on Earth remember there was a man who was not following Jesus that was casting out devils and Jesus let him keep casting out devils and said he that is not against us is for us so I have not physically attended the Asbury Revival I live about six hours north of Wilmore but now let's look at what is Revival according to the Greek definition in the New Testament Revival has at least two meanings the first is to live again as in Jesus's resurrection so this is a physical Revival from the dead the second definition is probably what defines the Asbury Revival it's to be restored to a correct life of one who returns to a better moral State and it can also mean to regain strength and vigor so the second definition is probably what's going on at Asbury if indeed people are getting a genuine Holy Ghost Revival what's happening is college students or even adults are getting restored to a correct life they probably heard about Jesus maybe they've claimed to believe in Jesus Through the anointing of the Holy Spirit and the worship going on perhaps some of them are repenting of their sins that they know are wrong and trying to live a correct Life Again by the grace of God perhaps some of the college students and adults had been weakened in their faith and now in this group worship they're finding strength maybe they're finding the joy of the Lord after repenting of their sins now what's interesting about this revival is that I'd been preaching on the Azusa Street Revival since January 29th so a little over a week before this revival broke out in Asbury and brother Branham said the Azusa Street Revival was the greatest Revival or outpouring of the Holy Ghost since the day of Pentecost so let's listen to the quote a man in California a negro one crossed out give him the experience of the baptism of the Holy Ghost from there formed Azusa Street the old Azusa Street Mission from our scattered to a sweat the whole nation from Nation went to Nation after Nations God had provided for them one of the greatest revivals that this nation has ever known I don't care what it was there's never been a Revival like the Pentecostal Revival right Wesley never had none of him virgin Calvin Knox great reformers but they never had to revive like the Pentecostal reminder the greatest thing is struck the Earth since the Holy Ghost fell on the day of Pentecost also I think it's important to show that through the study of scripture I found at least six types of Revival I have a video about this but at that point I only had recognized four of the types of Revival but now I believe they're six by God's grace so let's go through these as we go through these six type of revivals we'll be able to see what kind of Revival may be happening in Asbury the first type of Revival is National Revival and of course this is not happening in the United States brother random said it's thus saith the Lord the United States will never have a national Revival the Bible does record National revivals for Israel of course in the days of David Solomon when the Queen of Sheba visited she'd never seen such a Revival like that Revival and brother Branham said it was because all the people rallied around Solomon's gift of course I was a short-lived Revival because Solomon fell away from his wisdom and built Alters unto every false god of his thousand wives but also in the days of Hezekiah there's great Revival which is recorded in Second Kings 18. they tore down all the high places or worship of false Idols they crushed all the physical idols and they restored the house of God also you see a Revival in the days of Josiah in second chronicles 34. they found the word of God they rent their clothes because they were so ashamed of all the sins they'd been committing but the word of God they read impacted them and they repented their sins and started keeping the Commandments of God the second type of Revival is a church age Revival and of course this is the Revival that started in 1906 for the laodicean church age through William Seymour whom brother Brandon spoke very highly of and Friends history says that as the Azusa Street Revival went on Seymour realized tongues were not the evidence of the Holy Ghost Seymour realized that the Divine love of Jesus Christ was the evidence and that lines up with what brother random said as well because God is love when God comes into your soul and abides there permanently that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that will produce all the fruits of the spirit that will help you believe and receive the message of your hour so it's likely Asbury is not getting the church age Revival unless they go all the way on to the baptism of the Holy Ghost the third type of Revival is the latter rain Revival this is spoken of at James 5 verse 7 the early and the latter rain we know brother Adam's Ministry was the early Reign the teaching rain and we know rapturing faith is the latter rain so it does not appear that the Asbury Revival is the lateran Revival because that will be falling upon the Bride of Jesus Christ who believes all the Bible revelations that God gave to his Prophet brother Branham the fourth type of Revival is the Soul Revival this is a personal one-time Revival of the Soul or this is called the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's unlikely Asbury students and faculty are receiving this four type Revival and here's the proof of that recently I made a video about milk Christianity versus me Christianity from Hebrews chapter 5 verses 10 through chapter 6 verse 3. and as you can see on your screen here six beginning or Elementary doctrines a Christian has to receive before they can move on to Perfection which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost so the first one is repentance from dead works hopefully some people at the Asbury Revival are repenting of their sins but how many will repent of all their dead work such as watching porn watching dirty movies watching sports how many will put on Modest clothes on some of the videos I saw girls in shorts and of course they're revealing their thighs and thighs our nakedness according to Isaiah chapter 47 I saw girls with short hair and a woman who cuts her hair is a dishonor to her husband if she's married or it's a dishonor to her father if she's single so we don't really know the depths of repentance that those at Asbury are actually receiving and pressing into second Faith towards God are those who are getting Revival in Asbury is there faith in God or the word the word of this hour the mysteries of God being finished justification entire sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost third do they have the doctrine of baptisms do they know there's a lord Jesus Christ water baptism and a soul baptism the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's likely they don't on the statement of faith website for Asbury University they State they are trinitarians so we plainly know they don't have the correct water baptism that's a shame but will they have such a Revival where they press into the things of God in order to understand the doctrine of baptisms only time will tell fourth laying on of hands do they recognize the power of laying on hands praying for the sick casting out Devils it seems they may have some understanding of this if indeed a woman did get a devil cast out of her but then the question arises will that woman who was set free will she clean out her house as Jesus taught in Matthew chapter 12 and fill it with the Holy Ghost so more demons don't come in fifth resurrection of the Dead do they have the understanding that there's two resurrections and not just one there's a Rapture Resurrection which is called the first resurrection and then there's the resurrection of the Dead to the white Throne judgment and six and finally Eternal judgment friends it's unlikely they understand that hell is not eternal Asbury University is a Wesleyan University so they follow some of the teachings of God's messenger John Wesley but of course not all do they believe that hell is not Eternal as the Bible says or do they believe that Sinners will burn eternally and of course we know Sinners cannot burn eternally because they do not have eternal life moving on to the fifth type of Revival this is the Revival in the human Spirit which Paul says it is a transformation of the Mind in Romans 12. and he says in the book of Ephesians that were to be renewed day by day so this is the daily Revival of the human Spirit now I believe this is the type of Revival some people are probably experiencing it Asbury they let their minds get focused on the things of the world maybe politics or as we said Wicked sins like pornography or maybe the NFL or NBA worldly things worldly music money riches cares of this life and they've realized they've sinned and so they're coming to God they're drawing night to God and regaining strength in their human mind to focus on things of God more often than the things of the world so to me that's likely the Revival that they're having at Asbury they're getting their minds more focused on God but again that doesn't mean their souls are baptized with the Holy Ghost because they've got to be justified saved Sanctified and this is the step most of them are probably lacking living a full Sanctified life and then having their souls baptized with the Holy Ghost and the sixth type of Revival is the physical Revival like Jesus's body was revived at his resurrection this was in Romans 14 verse 9 for to this end Christ both died and Rose and revived and also we wonder what will this revival eventually produce well it's my guess it'll probably produce the same thing that the 1970 Asbury Revival produced so this University had a Revival in 1970 about 52 or 53 years ago and there's videos about it I watched some of them on YouTube and It produced justification for people people claim to get saved and some level of sanctification now some of the people they interviewed were men and women some of the men went into full-time preaching Ministry or became missionaries for the Wesleyan Church or the Methodist Church which is good but we know that's not the full word of God that's not a full baptism of the Holy Ghost message and of course there were women that got saved and they testified and on the videos they had makeup on they had cut hair they were wearing pants so again the 1970 Revival didn't produce a fully Sanctified and cleaned out life so it's my guess that this current Asbury Revival will probably produce the same thing and again I'm not criticizing these individuals but I'm examining all of their lives according to the full revealed word of God which God promised to do in Revelation 10 verse 7 finish the mystery of God Jesus said in Matthew 17 11 Elijah would become and restore all things so he's restored modesty he's restored Holiness he's restored entire sanctification Saints I believe this revival is also this generation's chance to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost as brother Branham said each generation gets a shot at receiving the word of God and it reminds me of Matthew 25 with the parable of the wise and foolish virgins both virgins get the wake-up call in every generation to receive the holy ghost or not so I believe this is this generation's opportunity they're in Asbury to get Justified Sanctified and go all the way to the Holy Ghost it's my humble opinion if they stay at that University they probably won't get the full baptism of the Holy Ghost but by God's grace some of them will be justified and partially Sanctified and if those are genuine experiences and they keep those experiences I believe they'll be saved friends I do believe the Asbury people can be saved just like the type of the wise and foolish virgins Abraham was the separated holy ghost-filled type he was separated unto God lot was the type of the foolish virgin closely associated with things of the world and yet the Bible called him a righteous soul in second Peter chapter two so we have wise Christians and we have foolish Christians are the Asbury Christians are they wise enough to repent of watching the Super Bowl the wicked halftime show the filthy commercials are they willing to delete all their worldly music and stop watching filthy movies are they ready to pray and fast for the baptism of the Holy Ghost are they ready to pay tithes and offerings are they ready to gather more with Saints as they see that day approaching are they willing to dress modestly and live holy unto the Lord and Friends brother Brandon believed denominational people could be saved as long as they were sincerely trusting in the blood of Jesus Christ in the seventh seal sermon brother Branham said any individual Catholic Jewish or whatever it might be Methodist Baptist Presbyterian any organization God has children sitting out in there so brother Ram said plainly God has children this must mean foolish virgins out there in the Catholic Church the Jewish Church Methodist Baptist Presbyterian any questions and answers part 1 1964 brother Rams said he sent three quarters of a million of his converts to the Assembly of God Church he said he's not against the people he's against every system that separates men and then he said he'd be a hypocrite to send his own children to death so he was telling the people the Assemblies of God is Not death there are some people that are saved in there and then in part two he said the same thing I disagree with the Assemblies of God but there's a many Assembly of God man that's a precious brother I disagree with Oneness Doctrine but but there's a many of those men are precious men I disagree with the Baptists with the Presbyterians and their systems but in there there's genuine Christians so I would say the same thing for the asper Revival there's probably genuine Christians in there but remember Jesus said few there be that find it and the same thing applies to message churches few there be that find the narrow road that leads to life in closing friends I hope this short video has been a help to you if you've been wondering about the Asbury Revival or just revivals in general again I've been praying for Revival this year for myself and our local church which is what we should all be praying for according to Saint Paul but ultimately friends we should be praying for the latter rain Revival again found in the book of James and brother Brown said the latter rain is rapturing faith we're looking for that final Revival the bride's Revival where God pours out rapturing Grace upon the Saints so their bodies can be changed in a moment and twinkling of an eye of course no man knows the day or the hour of the rapture but the Bible says we know the seasons of The Rapture in first Thessalonians chapter 5. so may each one of us seek daily Revival for our minds if we're not born again may we seek that one Revival of the soul the baptism of the Holy Ghost the Sea of the Holy Ghost and may we press toward the mark of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus friends this is our opportunity in our generation to receive the Revival that we need as message Believers we want the Revival in our souls the baptism of the Holy Ghost so we'll be the wise virgins and ready to meet Jesus at his appearing if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me [Music] God bless you friends as the Holy Ghost anoints you to defend the Gospel of Jesus Christ as Paul also said in Philippians 1 verse 17 he said knowing that I am set for the defense of the Gospel of Jesus Christ to bring the Good Tidings the good news that Jesus read Jesus that never say [Music]
