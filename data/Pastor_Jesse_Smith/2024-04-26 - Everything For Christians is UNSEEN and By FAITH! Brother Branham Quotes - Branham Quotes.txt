TRANSCRIPT
========================================
the whole armor of God's by faith we haven't got one natural thing of this world everything of the Christian church is a faith act look at the armor of God love joy peace longsuffering goodness meekness gentl patience is that right everything's Supernatural nothing natural so we don't look at the things natural because we're operating Supernatural and the only way we can base it is Faith is on what God Said was the truth and we look at the Unseen and we call those things which are not as though they were like Abraham did when God Amen Abraham called those things which was not like God did as though they were being a 100 years old staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief I can just imagine that couldn't you see Sarah get up in the morning God said Abraham Abraham you go to have the [Music] baby Sarah God said how you feeling Sarah this is multitude but listen no different well glory to God we're going to have it go get the bird eye and the pins and everything get ready all right another month passed Sarah how you feeling no different year passed Sarah what about it no different 10 years pass no different 25 years pass no different Abraham instead of getting weak he got stronger and stronger he know it's going to be more of a miracle all the time cuz he believed God and he staggered out at the promise of God through unbelief he said we're going to have it one morning the womb of Sarah began to swell and little Isaac was born because Abraham believed God and he looked at the things that kind of those things that was not as though as they were not by feelings not by sight you don't walk by feelings or sight it's by faith and when God has pronounced anything said whatever things you ask when you pray believe you receive it and hold on to it God said so it's got to be so amen demons faith in the father faith in the son faith in the Holy Ghost three in the one demons will tremble and sinners awake faith in Jehovah will anything Shake that's right oh my certain it is have faith in God look to him don't you move stay right there God said so how can we explain things that we don't know that's the reason there's no way at all of ever being saved until you're ready to accept what you cannot explain you've got to believe he that cometh to God must believe that he is I there's no way of scientifically proving that but you must believe it anyhow and if you could prove Pro it then it would no more be an Act of Faith and faith God Is So hid himself until you have to believe that he is without seeing him know that he's there anyhow whether you see it or not you believe it surely you believe it anyhow now I think that's marvelous and that gives uh illiterate people like me a chance everybody to to believe it because we hear it and Faith cometh by hearing and hearing of the word of God then we accept that and believe that and upon the basis of our faith in that we are saved healed and whatever more we draw from God comes from The Unseen resource Christians the whole armor of Christianity is faith everything thing that we have is unseen the only things that's real is unseen unexplained the things that can be explained are not real they're superficial and die but the things that cannot be explained are Immortal the whole realm look at the armor of Christianity love what part of you is love love Joy Faith longsuffering weekness patience see none of those things you can't see them they're unseen but yet we believe them Love Never Dies faith is a is a victory we believe things that we don't see now in Jesus was God God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself and and these people believed his testimony and them that did truly believe it could draw God's blessings from him and when they did so he said virtue went from him virtue is strength he in other words if we'd said today he got weak when the people drawed off of him well if it work that way in that human body it'll work in another human body and we create our our atmosphere around us each one of us you've been with people that were nice people but you just couldn't hardly be around them then you've been with other people that just love to be around them you create that atmosphere and oh wouldn't you love to Been Around Jesus just a wonderful see what that atmosphere he created would have been I imagine it was just one great big bundle of love and respects and Godly fear now I have often heard people say many of you I guess has already played the tape of that last Vision up there why I'm right here in Arizona now and I was oh my if you get it it's what time is it sir if you get a ever bought a tape from us get that one now they're not mine they belong to another company that's with us uh uh with the tapes and um they're not mine so but I know the boy has them and uh I never had anything like that to happen some of them say when you're in the presence of God why don't you ask them this or that it's it's different than what you see what many people calls the power of God is only the blessings of God the power of God's altogether different from the blessings of God the power of God in his presence you just don't know what to do you just you're you're so you're so scared to your numb all over there's two days even in my back in the back of my head and up and down my body I couldn't feel at all and so it just perfectly numbed with such a fear when that constellation of Angels standing right here not just stand looking at him like I am now and you think that would be all well no if you're actually there and see it it's different
