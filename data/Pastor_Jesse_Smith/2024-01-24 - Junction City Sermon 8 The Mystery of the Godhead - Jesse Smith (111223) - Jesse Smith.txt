TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I'm going to record this uh sermon in case anybody wants copies I have most of the sermons that I've preached here recorded if anybody wanted to go back and listen to any of those um I think the only one I missed was the baptism of the Holy Ghost I think that was the only one that I missed there by the grace of God so we want to look look at the mystery of the godhead and there's only one service today is that right brother Irvin okay so I'm not even going to pay attention to the clock today I'm just going to preach praise God I want you to get it and I want you to uh enjoy the the word of God today usually at my church you know there're in aaran I preach at least an hour and a half that's usually where I I cut it off so just so you know if you need like brother BR said if you need to get up and stand up you know stretch your legs up against the wall he said go ahead and do that praise God because I'm going to make a recording today and I trust to be a blessing uh to you by the grace of God so God sent the seventh angel according to Revelation 10:7 to finish the mystery of God and brother Braham said it says mystery but of course it means all the mysteries in the Bible that are called Mysteries Mysteries Hallelujah and brother Ram said God just calls them the mystery of God and we know that because uh God gave Paul the full Revelation and then of course after Paul John wrote the Book of Revelation but there were some things in the M I'm sorry some things in the Book of Revelation Paul didn't know about because Paul had already passed on he'd already been a martyr and so uh then the bi the Bible shows us that they would lose some truth through the 2,000-year church ages and God would restore at the end of the Gentile Church that's where we're at today we're living in an age of restoration praise God hallelujah we're so blessed to live in this day where we're not lacking Revelation but we've received the full revelation of God's word hallelujah so we're very grateful for that uh the Bible says I will restore sayeth the Lord in Joel chapter 2 this is the hour of restoration God is restoring the original Faith Malachi 45 and6 of course brother Ram says Elijah will turn our hearts back he said to the p Pentecostal fathers to the apostolic fathers so our hearts are turned back to the Bible we don't want a man's Creed we want what the Bible says praise God we're not going to settle for a denomination we're not going to settle for a Creed you all came out of denomination just like I did hallelujah amen so we we came out of denomination we will not go back in we will not add man's ideas but we will believe the full word of God we will believe the full truth of God because this is the hour when the full truth is available to us Hallelujah so we're very grateful for that what God has done in this hour Hallelujah now we know I just want to share just a few basic things here uh by the grace of God we know God is one person we we know God is not three persons we know God is not two persons um and so I want to state that plainly uh but remember brother Ram said there will be a few people in the denominations that are saved brother Ram said God has children in the Catholic Church brother bam said that brother bam said God has children in the Methodist Church right how many believe you still got loved ones that are caugh maybe caught up in denomination now look at the witnesses here me too Hallelujah right and brother B said they're foolish virsion he said they're virgin to all that they believe of God's word so they're true to all that they know but they're foolish because they don't prepare and receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost right they're they could have prepared to receive the Holy Ghost they could have went deeper in the word like you and I are going Hallelujah today amen they could have but they didn't prepare the oil but that's why we're here today no church building uh in this area there's no no building built for us to assemble there so you love God so much you'll Gather in a man's basement and praise God hallelujah doesn't matter where you gather the church is not the building the church is the body of Believers Hallelujah you're the church I'm the church brother Irvin's the church sister wil is the church We Are One Church one body our body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost hallelujah amen but I want to say this brother R says in 1961 he said trinitarianism is of the devil he said that's thus sayith the Lord but he says he says but he said trinitarians can be saved he said because this is not a Salvation issue this is not am I saved by the blood or am I saved by rosaries am I saved by the blood of Jesus Christ or am I saved by my Creed brother said the trinitarians can be saved he said but the time has come when they're sincerely wrong he said they can be sincere and be trinitarians but he said they're sincerely wrong Hallelujah and that's right the the trinitarian doctrine doesn't pertain to Salvation brother ramam said the same thing about the serpent seed remember I read that to you last time if you got a real good memory yeah back in August brother Ram said serpent seed is the killer he said but it's okay if people can't see it it doesn't to I'm sorry it doesn't pertain to Salvation he said it just shines more light on the gospel truth that we're all trying to see hallelujah amen hallelujah now there's a reason it's very important to not accept three persons I'm going to close with that at the end of this sermon here by God's grace there's a very important reason that that we're not trinitarians as you'll see um but I want to say this you know of my friends that are in denominations many of them are precious people and they're honest people so I have compassion on trinitarians that are honest trinitarians now there's also trinitarians that are total Scoundrels and filled with demon powers you know right I'm talking about the the child molesters I'm talking about the murderers I'm talking about the the greedy money hungry uh liars and false prophets amen right they're lost they're demon-possessed but there are foolish virgins that are saved and I have pity on them I have compassion on them and one reason I do is because the truth uh because the revelation of one person is very close to the trinitarian right it's very close there's still a mysterious element okay so I just want to tell you I have compassion on trinitarians as long as they're foolish virgin all right and brother bam said they can be saved remember Jesus said overall in Matthew 7:14 he said few will find the narrow road that leads to repent so very few trinitarians will be saved let me say this very few message people will be saved amen it's a few it's a small group right because the many are deceived but Jesus said the elect cannot be deceived Hallelujah and how do you know the truth how do you know you're not deceived you believe the Bible Hallelujah you believe thus say the scripture Hallelujah brother Bram said if you got the Holy Ghost he said it'll point you back to the word of God every time Hallelujah he said when you got the Holy Ghost you can say Amen to every word of God hallelujah that's right Hallelujah not every word of brother brandom I hope there's no brother brandom worshippers in here today we thank God for our Prophet but it's not every word of brother brandom it's every word of God hallelujah that's right that's right Hallelujah I don't think we have any brother R worshippers in here so praise the Lord amen I battle that Spirit a lot online so that's why I'm constantly preaching on that by God's grace but uh you know like like last week I put out a video where I told people never baptized in the name of William Brandon isn't it sad people would do that amen it's so sad brother random said that spirit that would do that he said is an antichrist Spirit he said it he said it he called it the devil's toilet now think about those words that's harsh that's harsh words brother Ram said that's a devil's toilet I got the quote from 1961 brother Ram said that he says one of the most awfulest things is some of the Tommy rot things he said I am a sinner saved by grace he said but Jesus is your savior Hallelujah remember 1 Corinthians chapter 1 Paul said I'm glad I baptized none of you except some of you would have said I baptize in my own name amen so see that shows brother R was a real man of God he was so much like Christ that people start baptizing in his name just like Paul and didn't they say John the Baptist aren't you the Messiah some people confuse John the Baptist for the Messiah so see in one way we learn a good lesson let's be so much like Jesus that people have sometimes wonder Hallelujah let's be so much like Jesus so they know Christ is in us hallelujah that's right exctly right but of course we would never go where the Antichrist Spirit takes people and they baptize the name of William brandom or some nonsense like that that's from Hell Jesus Christ is the only name to baptize in hallelujah amen hallelujah now I got a lot of verses here so You' got your Bibles I like some of you to maybe read for me because I like to keep you awake too Hallelujah I like you to read the word of God here now the Bible never says God is three persons but I want Daniel to read Hebrews chapter 1 verse3 brother Daniel and I want brother John Proverbs 305 and 6 so Hebrews 1:3 Daniel and John proverbs 30 verse 5 and 6 there's only one verse in the Bible where it talks about God and the person of God and it's Hebrews 1:3 so brother Daniel whenever you're ready brother who being the brightness of his glory and the expressed image of his person and upholding All Things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the of the Majesty on high thank you brother Jesus is the express image of his person every catch you yet that's the only verse in the Bible that I found I could be wrong I trust some of you bibl readers will let me know if I'm wrong after service that's the only verse in the Bible where it says God has a person he's a person but Jesus is the image of his person amen amen and the express image means the exact reproduction it means like a fact anybody ever sent a fact yet got a fact machine anybody it's just like a copy machine whatever you put in there you just press copy I do it all the time I'm a school teacher I copy all the time it makes a perfect copy everything's the same Glory that's what God did in Christ God put all of his word in Christ hallelujah amen hallelujah God had a fax machine and he when he faxed himself he put it in Christ hallelujah amen the Bible said in John 1 ver14 the word was made flesh and dwelt among us hallelujah so Jesus's character was fully human but it was fully the word of of God CU Jesus told us in John 14 he said when you've seen me you've seen the father amen the character of God not the spirit of God you'll never see the spirit of God we'll get to that in a little bit but the character of God the nature of God all of God's nature everything that God was however God would have acted that was in Christ so here's a verse that never says Jesus is a second person it says Jesus is the image of the person of God Hallelujah all right now brother John Proverbs 35 and6 there every word of God is pure he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him and add thou not unto his words lest he reprove thee and thou be found a liar all right how many words of God are pure every word every word so if no word caus god a second or third person then we ought not to say that amen but also every word the Bible does say about God we've got to say Amen to and there's got to be a revelation there's got to be some type of Truth in there that we can grab a hold of and say I believe the God's word hallelujah that's why I told my trinitarian friends one time I said I don't I don't doubt anything in the Bible I believe everything the Bible says about God I just reject all your man-made Creeds I believe everything the Bible says about the godhead Hallelujah so did brother Brandon Hallelujah but we don't want to go to heaven and believe you know believe God's three persons and God will call us a liar especially as a preacher I don't want God to say well you lied to the people and you added to my Bible I never want to add I never want to take away praise God all right now I just want to um give you this example this helped a couple people when I shared this think about yourself how many persons are you brother John just you how many persons are you sure I are you sure Levi how many persons are you one one but how many aspects or how many elements do you have to your your being three three amen you're one person but you got three elements or three aspects to your being you're a you have a body you have a spirit and you have a soul that's according to first Thessalonians 5:23 and whose image are you made in God of God man is made in the image of God so man is one person sisters are one person but you have three aspects to you you have a body a spirit and a soul and the church said amen so is God God is one person but he reveals himself as father son Holy Ghost amen one person Hallelujah is it it's mysterious right it's there's a mysterious element to it Hallelujah and I I even like what Paul says in Romans 7 brother Levi he says when I sin it's not me that sins but it's the sin that dwells within me praise God hallelujah so Paul even separates I am not like that sin nature that's not the real me the real me is the seed of God the spirit of God the soul that God placed in me that's the real me praise God that's right amen but of course Jesus had no sin nature in him so he never had to say that Hallelujah but Paul would Paul would separate the difference between his sin nature and the seed of God or the soul that God gave him Hallelujah now uh Levi can you read John 1118 brother John 1:18 and brother Arley can you read 1 Timothy 6:16 brother Arley 1 Timothy 6:16 can you read that brother and then Levi you're uh John 1:18 now these two verses are going to are going to show that you will never see God and no one has ever seen God and you never will because God is invisible think about that I was thinking last night you look at all the we saw those Stars last night I was thinking like all that God just holds in his hand like this whole universe God just holds in his hand he's so great he's so mighty our minds can't comprehend it so let's not be discouraged if there's a few things in the Bible maybe we can't understand everything let's get let's just m let's just make sure God is great in our eyes let's not limit God cannot limit the Holy One of Israel praise God all right just just remember how great this God is nothing is too hard for the Lord hallelujah that's right so brother Levi uh John 1:18 no man has seen God at any time the only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father he has declared him amen amen see no man has ever seen God so even in the Old Testament the Bible said when Jacob wrestled the Angel and he said I've seen the Lord he actually didn't see the invisible Spirit what he saw was a manifestation of God all right is everybody understand that amen physical manifestation yeah when they saw the pillar of fire Moses you know and Israel saw the pillar of fire they really weren't seeing God God himself because God was invisible and God's spirit was inside that fire all right and that's what brother arley's going to read 1 Timothy 6:16 notice this verse says God dwells in the light so God is inside of the light brother Arley when you're ready there brother 1 Timothy 6:16 who only have immor dwelling in the light which no man can approach whom no man has seen nor can see to whom the honor and power Everlasting am all right praise God dwelling in the light everybody catch that he's the only one with immortal morality he's the only one with eternal life and he dwells in the light and no man has ever seen him and no man ever will see God we'll never see God as far as the invisible Spirit but we'll see his son we'll see his manifestation of himself amen we'll see the express image of God hallelujah amen glory now sister Rachel do you want to go to uh Colossians can you go to Colossians chapter 1:15 I'll have you read that Colossians 1:15 who else okay let me find this other one I want to read here and sister Miram would you read uh Colossians 29 so I got 115 over here and 29 over here would that be okay Hallelujah whenever ready sister Rachel Colossians 1:15 who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature Hallelujah so Jesus is the image of the invisible God you'll see that it's many times in the Bible God is invisible so to become visible he made a manifestation of light brother raham said it was like a little Halo now before even that Halo there had to be time space and matter right so God first had to create time space and matter and then a little Halo of light comes out of that and that was Christ that was the word that was God's Veil that was God's manifestation that was God's son something came out of God now he's got a son praise God hallelujah that's what that's what brother teaches it's all over the message you can find it I heard Lonnie Jenkins preach on it it was a beautiful message you ever hear Lonnie Jenkins message on it brother oh it's beautiful yes so after God created time and space matter and then the light came out brother said there's Christ there's the logos there's the sun there's the pillar of fire there's the Holy Ghost amen hallelujah in a visible form because God's invisible the first thing that became visible was his son his word and brother said that was when Jesus said or God said let there be light Hallelujah amen amen that first light that first little Halo of fire the pillar of fire that was let there be light and that was Christ's Spirit hallelujah amen it was the Holy Spirit in a visible form Hallelujah all right he's the image of the invisible God thank you sister Rachel sister Miram can you read 2:15 or I'm sorry 29 for in him I all the fullness of the godhead bodily amen hallelujah in Christ so God put all of himself in Christ Hallelujah now church when did he do that brother Bram said at the River Jordan how many know that the Bible said in in in John chapter one The Spirit descended on Jesus at the River Jordan and it remained on him praise God and then brother R tells us at the crucifixion at some point that Spirit had to withdraw because God had to put a curse on the body of Jesus he became sin that we might be made his righteousness amen but then after he raised brother he said all power is given unto me in heaven and earth hallelujah amen the fullness of the godhead dwelt in him bodily praise God amen amen does everybody understand Hallelujah I know it's a little deep here but it's deep and rich is what brother bam says hallelujah he says like it's like bears looking honey off each other he said that's what it is when we're when we're having good fellowship and the word of God's being revealed amen you're just licking licking the honey off of us here amen it's so delicious Hallelujah so God is invisible but he became visible in in the pillar of fire we say the light of God and then the fullness of God's spirit God put that in Christ Hallelujah now I want to show you the word the real word to use with the father son Holy Ghost the word we should use is not persons but it's manifestations okay so Howard can you get uh 1 Timothy 3:16 and Sister Sarah would you get 1 Corinthians 12:7 I see you got your Bible there can you get 1 Corinthians 12:7 Sister Sarah would that be okay and then Howard's going to get 1 Timothy 3:16 so this is how you win every debate brother said it's okay to debate sometimes you just don't argue brother Ram had at least three debates one about the godhead one about serpent seed and another it's okay to debate as long as you keep the Christian Spirit St Paul went in the Sabbath every Saturday and reasoned with the scribes and Pharisees that's like a debate it was a good honest debate he's trying to give them reasons to believe Jesus was Messiah Hallelujah I believe the greatest reason he could have said is look at my life I was a murderer I was a Pharisee but look at now I'm forgiven and I'm empowered by the Holy Spirit praise God Hallelujah Jesus lives in me the one I used to persecute now I live for him praise God Amen brother Howard 1 Timothy 3:16 brother controversy is God was manifest in the justified in the spirit seen of angels preached into the Gentiles believed on in the world received up into glory amen the key word there is Manifest God was manifest the word manifest means to appear God appeared in the flesh it wasn't a second person it was God hallelujah is that right God appeared in the flesh so we always use that word right brother Ram came to point us back to the word of God well let's use the Bible words right that's what we tell our trinitarian friends right I'm not a trinitarian I'm a Christian praise God I'm not a Oneness either because that one word Oneness is in the Bible I'm just a holy ghost filled Saint and I believe everything the Bible says about the godhead amen God is one person Hallelujah I don't need a label I don't need any of that I'm a holy ghost filed Christian Hallelujah the word of God's enough for me brother IR Hallelujah I don't need any anything added on to it I'm a Christian Hallelujah right so the word when you talk about the son you always got to say you always got to remember he's a manifestation of God that body is an appearing of God but God dwells inside the body all right so sorry sister uh 1 Corinthians 12:7 here the the Bible says the Holy Ghost is a manifestation as well so that's 1 Corinthians 127 there sister whenever you're ready to Pro amen so see this is speaking of gifts of the holy spirit so when the gifts of the holy spirit works like through brother John when he got healed whether that was his faith or somebody else's faith when his back got healed that was an appearing of the Holy Ghost that's a manifestation right and think about the day of Pentecost who who can uh who can shout it out what was one of the ways the Holy Ghost manifested on the day of Pentecost Tong of fire tongues of fire how else speaking in t speaking in tongues Hallelujah what's another one preaching boldly preaching boldly that's right how about the Russian Mighty Wind amen now think of that 120 licks of fire that's 120 pieces of God Did It limit God was God like well I better stop because I I can't produce any more fires he's he's infinite he could have produced a billion fires amen hallelujah and that steel would not have exhausted his power he appeared on 120 and then he was speaking through 120 with the tongues you're exactly right God speaking through 120 different people at the same time you can't limit God hallelujah amen that's right when he wants to speak he's going to speak the spirit and the bride say come Hallelujah so when God is witnessing through you it's the Holy Spirit manifesting through your life praise God when you sisters train your children and you teach them the Bible That's God speaking through you amen that's right amen that's right you fathers when you discipline your children or just love your children or whatever you got to do when you're telling them the truth that's God speaking through you brother said the bride has a Voice Hallelujah because the spear and the bride say come hallelujah amen these worshippers brother say Well only brother braham's the voice of God you're against the Bible the Bible said the spirit and the bride say come hallelujah amen thank God I always go back to that that false Doctrine I got to preach against that one all right so whenever you see the son whenever we talk about the father son Holy Ghost the son was a manifestation the holy spirit is a manifestation of God it's an appearing of God all right now remember brother told this story many times he talked to a Jewish rabbi remember and the rabbi said you can't cut God in three persons and give him to a Jew remember he said that yes and brother said I don't do that he said Rabbi let me ask you who is Messiah in relation to God and the m Mah said he was God oh thank you brother I appreciate that God give you a reward here give water in the name of a disciple praise God remember brother said that he said he told the man he said uh who is he in relation to God and the the Jewish rabbi said he is God and brother said that's exactly right and brother Ram read Isaiah 9:6 let's read that Isaiah 9:6 Brother Andy do you want to read that brother when you get it Isaiah 96 didn't see had a Bible he's got a Bible good and this is the scripture brother random uses whenever you're ready Brother Andy forto us child isor us be amen and this this th brother used this verse to convince a Jew that Christians have the godhead right Hallelujah in fact there's another Jewish rabbi brother Ram said he used this scripture to make instead of a Jewish rabbi he said now he's a Pentecostal Rabbi with the baptism of the Holy Ghost In other words he left the Jewish law and now he came into he was a Messianic Christian praise God amen amen hallelujah because we don't believe Jesus was a second person he was the image of the person of God Amen that's right not a second not a third the same one just in a visible image of him Hallelujah think about that Mighty God Jesus is the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace amen hallelujah now go to Proverbs 8 now we're going to throw you a real curveball but if you're a real good baseball players you can hit a curveball right curve balls don't strike you out if you're a real good player I you see them on the TV that sometimes they hit home runs and you can hit a curveball pretty hard but what we're saying is we're getting into the deeper things of God here here Proverbs 8 verse uh 22 this is a beautiful portion of scripture this supports what brother random taught that the the light of God came out of God and that was the first image of God before there was a world uh before there was Angels it was God's light because the Bible said he's the first born of every creature there it is amen hallelujah the logos that Pillar of Fire that first came out of God was the first manifestation it was the first creature it was the first creation remember Jesus said I'm the beginning of the creation of God hallelujah oh my see we don't Den we don't doubt any scripture in the Bible brother uran we believe every word of God in the Bible there's no verse in the Bible I got to say well I can't preach this or I don't understand it the Holy Ghost will give us understanding Hallelujah Proverbs 8:22 this is a long section so I'm going to read this one here the Lord possessed me in the the beginning of his way before his works of old this is speaking of wisdom which is a type of the Holy Ghost I was set up from Everlasting from the beginning wherever the Earth was so before the Earth was wisdom was there which is the holy spirit when there was no depths of water I was brought forth when there were no fountains abounding with water before the mountains were settled before the hills I was brought forth there was already the pillar of fire before mountains Hills Water streams anything Hallelujah the church said amen I like to hear those amens brother said that says sium hallelujah sick Hallelujah go get that devil amen expose that devil for his lies Hallelujah bring the truth forth he said uh 26 while as yet he had not made the Earth nor the fields nor the highest part of the Dust of the world when he prepared the heavens I was there when he set a compass upon the face of the death when he established the clouds above when he Str stren The Fountains of the deep when he gave to the Sea his decree that the water should not pass his commandment when he appointed the foundations of the earth then I was where I was by him as one brought up with him I love this one brother mam now look at this brother he he paints a good picture and I was daily his Delight rejoicing always before him brother random said that when the pillar of fire came out he was like a little child playing and dancing before his dad you got all those boys brother they like to dance before you they like to play around with you do they ever say hey Daddy let's go play my boy tells me all the time daddy can we go play football can we go out there and play football I'm like if I got time and brother said that's what the father and the son were doing before the foundation of the world that light that came out of God he said was playing and the the Hebrew word means rejoicing oh Hallelujah think about that the son the spirit of the son the Holy Spirit was rejoicing before the invisible father that's what your Bible said how many believe the Bible Still You Still Believe it or you want to take this out of the Bible absolutely not we can understand it by the scripture brother Bram said it was like a son you know playing at the porch of of the House of the father he's just playing before the father now that word Rejoice also means to dance anybody like to dance around here and praise the Lord people wonder where does music come from where does Dance come from according to the Bible Jesus was the first one to Rejoice hallelujah amen the Angels were the first one to shout because the Bible said in Job chapter 7 they were shouting before the foundation of the world hallelujah amen brother R said our kind of religion is the oldest kind of religion Hallelujah we didn't copy the devil's religion we got old time religion amen dancing and shouting and praising God that's the original religion praise God people that are free and not Bound by Satan that's what God wants he wants us to be free we just read it today let him praise His name in the dance Hallelujah why cuz that's what the sun did before the foundation of the world Amen Hallelujah now you got scripture to back it up Hallelujah the devil didn't teach me how to dance Jesus taught me how to dance amen that's right because he's the first dancer amen he's the first one rejoicing was Jesus there you go you got your Bible for it now now you got more freedom to dance if you want to dance we had dancing last Saturday night we had a a good I'm sorry last Friday night we had some Revival Services Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday we didn't know which night the Holy Ghost was going to fall the Holy Ghost fell on Friday night we danced around the church for like an hour it was really wonderful crying rejoicing shouting people said they got refreshed inspired of the Holy Spirit that's what we were made to do we were made to worship God the Bible said God Delights in your worship praise God that's right he loves when his children rejoice and say thank you Father for the food the shelter the clothing thank you for forgiving my sins thank you for filling me with the Holy Ghost praise God hallelujah amen so now you got scripture now you got scripture to show the pillar of fire the Sun the Holy Spirit was right there not the body of Jesus but the spirit of Jesus was right there rejoicing before the eternal spirit God and now we can understand John 1722 let's go to that one John 17:22 and brother Irvin would you read that one then brother Irvin maybe you can read uh 1722 uh and 24 so John 1722 and 24 these scriptures confuse people because these are scriptures that the trinitarians would use and don't feel bad if you're confused about the Bible I'm I I constantly have questions I don't understand but you know what I do like brother said set him up on the Shelf I've seen God over the years take so many things off the shelf now I understand it now I got a scripture for but just got to wait on the Lord and church you're going to find all your answers in the Holy Bible amen right Hallelujah so brother irin John 17:22 and then read 24 when you're done and the glory thou G me I have given them that they may be one even as we are one father I will that they also whom thou Hast given me be with me where I am that they may behold my glory which thou Hast given me for thou L me before the foundation of the world Hallelujah the church said amen here's a scripture where Jesus says my father loved me before the world was even formed hallelujah hallelujah and where was that it's just like I showed you out of nothing came and uh time space and matter came this Pillar of Fire that's when God put his glory on Jesus the spirit of Jesus which is the holy spirit that's what brother irin read the glory which thou gavest me and then you love me before the foundation of the world oh this is getting deep and rich now hallelujah amen we're we are back in the mind of God before the foundation of the world and the pillar of fire came out a little Halo that was the son and Jesus Jesus could recall from that time my goodness gracious he could who knows brother that could have been millions of billions of years we don't know but Jesus by the Holy Spirit could remember back to then said that's when you gave me the glory and he said Give me the give me the glory That Glory that we had before the foundation of the world Amen oh Hallelujah and church if that was where Christ was don't forget Ephesians chapter 1 the Bible said John you were chosen in him before the foundation of the world Amen so his thoughts of you were in that Pillar of Fire before the foundation of the world that's where you came from hallelujah oh now I just placed you there you were there sister Sarah sister Ruth you were there you don't remember brother said because you were the thought of God but if you're a part of Christ you always were hallelujah amen that's right you always were a thought of God you were there in his mind brother Daniel Hallelujah ra said you just didn't know it but now I know it Hallelujah now I know I was in Christ and now I'm an Express thought of God on this Earth hallelujah amen glory am hallelujah thank you Jesus amen you love me he said you love me Lord before or God before the foundation of the world Amen I can say Amen to that amen oh brother that's a train Arian verse no that's a Bible verse amen and now we can understand Genesis 1:26 and 27 let us make man in our image right brother Bram said who is that brother Bram said that's father and son that's a direct quote look up let us make men our our image and Father and Son now I just have this thought that came to me here there it is okay so now now we can understand levitic I'm sorry uh Genesis 1:26-27 God said let us make man what is God saying God's saying the invisible Spirit and the son this invisible spirit and now this Pillar of Fire this son of God this logos brother calls it now he said let us in other words God is going to work through that manifestation to create everything everything amen hallelujah glory amen and notice he said let us make man in our image Hallelujah father son Holy Spirit Glory oh it's good now Ephesians 3:9 Ephesians 3:9 sister Wilma would you read that when you get it Ephesians 3:9 this scripture says God created All Things by who Jesus Christ and Jesus is the word what do you create what how do you create your day how do you create your feelings you create it by your word oh I had a great day I'm gonna have a great day sister Ruth I'm gonna have a safe travel Sister Sarah we're I'm gonna have a great service with Junction City Saints what am I doing I'm creating my day I'm have a good day at work brother Daniel I'm gonna have a successful job tomorrow what are you doing you're creating by Your Word tomorrow I'm going to feel better brother Howard what what are you doing you're creating by your spoken word that's what God did Hallelujah and when God spoke the word that word was Christ amen because Christ is the word hallelujah amen his name is the word of God glory so sister wima Ephesians 3:9 and beginning of the world have been God who created all things through Jesus Christ amen how did God create all things wonderful sister wima how did God do it by Christ Christ means the anointing the anointing of what the holy spirit amen so when God said let there be light that word was Christ and then God used that Pillar of Fire brother ra said that Pillar of Fire then started speaking Day One Creation Day two creation and go brother man said God created through Christ the word and now the pillar of fire is speaking hallelujah amen oh my now raise your hand does that help anybody by God's grace the first few minutes of this I got I'm 39 minutes in does that help anybody by God's grace okay I got a couple hands there all right well Hallelujah I hope more people are helped by the End by God's I hope every hand can go up by the end but if not well God gives us different Revelations at different times brother's got both I got both hands up too brother Hallelujah so see now Genesis 1: 126 makes sense God can use us because it was invisible plus visible right there's no other noun to use right he has to use us he has to use a plural noun because a noun is a person place or thing right what was the sun the sun was a manifestation it's a thing it's a light Glory it's not a second person but it is a noun so with our English language the only way we can understand God is God saying let us Father and Son invisible and visible let us make man in our image amen glory and I can believe every word in the Bible I believe every word in the Bible and the church said amen there's no verse that stumbles me like the godhead because it all fits it all fits is it a mystery absolutely but we never add to the word nor take away from it amen hallelujah and now we can understand Matthew 28:19 baptize them in the name of the father son Holy Ghost one name one name to the father son Holy Ghost and the Bible says in Philippians 2:9 there's one name that's above all names that's the name of Jesus Christ amen amen one name Hallelujah remember Jesus means Jehovah is our savior right Jehovah so brother says Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus of the new hallelujah oh it's beautiful and like like like like you've heard it say brother Ram said the same thing brother Ram said I'm a father I'm a son I'm a husband I'm a brother he was a grandpa he was a prophet he's a friend he's all these things but he's got one name William Marin brandham Hallelujah I think I counted one time I have at least eight titles I'm a teacher father you know Pastor I might have 10 titles we all have all these titles but that's not my name brother said you can't sign your checks with your tit there's only power in the name Hallelujah so no one was ever baptized in Father Son and Holy Ghost no demon was ever cast out in Father Son and Holy Ghost they're only cast out in the name of Jesus Christ Hallelujah just speak that holy name in prayer and watch demons scatter Hallelujah watch The Darkness scatter you speak that name that name is light and the Darkness must flee hallelujah oh glory to God I got some Smiles hallelujah amen amen first John John 57 first John 5:7 brother John you want to read that for us brother so all these so-called trinitarian scriptures can easily be understood if we just stay with the Bible words and we don't add to them Amen brother irin how many sermons have you heard on the godhead here one or two or none okay well that makes me feel good all right I'm just going to throw this over here for there are three that bear record in heaven the Father the word and the Holy Ghost and these three are one amen the Father the word and the Holy Ghost no notice it didn't say son brother said the trinitarians don't like that verse because because they call him the Eternal Son of God like they're so in love with father son Holy Ghost what do they do like this or something like that father son Holy Ghost they're just so in love with that but brother said look God used the name word to show that Christ he's also the word of God God created All Things by his word hallelujah oh it's beautiful and he didn't say he didn't say these three are three persons he said these three are one right just like there's one name to the father son Holy Ghost not names Hallelujah now Jesus's baptism we're not going to go there but Matthew chapter 3 when Jesus was baptized trinitarians stumbled they see see there's three persons nonsense Jesus's body was there the dove was there and then there was a voice in one place brother said the voice came from the dove right if the voice came from the dove well that makes it not three that makes only two manifestations all right and I already showed you on the day of Pentecost God was speaking through 120 different people God had 120 lick of fires is God 120 persons no but God can manifest himself as many ways as he wants praise God so at jesus' baptism there was three manifestations that didn't make him three persons that made him all powerful as brother said that makes him omnipresent he can be anywhere he wants as much as he wants as little as he wants he can be anywhere at any time and any place brother Bram said he's he's omnipresent by his for knowledge in other words God knows everything that going to happen out in your Woods there brother herin he knows every little animal every squirrel that's going to get nuts or no no nuts or whatever any chipmunk or what they're going to get God knows everything because he's got four knowledge but then God can bring his presence in as many places as he wants Hallelujah okay so we have at Jesus baptism we have three manifestations of God a voice right we have a body and we have a spear of a dove and I already showed you the son is not a second person the sun is a manifestation of God all right and if if God uh you know God can manifest himself in in three ways at one time that's easy because on day of Pentecost he did over 120 it's that's nothing that's not hard for God is anything too hard for the Lord no Hallelujah now next jesus' prayers in Gethsemane they say was Jesus praying to himself no no the flesh was praying to the spirit brother said he said there's the mystery Jesus was fully human and fully God so when Jesus prayed it was the flesh it was the humanity praying to the spirit all right not two persons but the manifestation praying to the invisible Spirit if we're going to use Bible words and brother Ram said who do you pray to When you pray can anybody say out loud who do you pray pray to When you pray Jesus but where's Jesus if you're born again where's Jesus he's inside you right but where else is he Bible said he sits on the throne in heaven huh so he's in me yet he's up in heaven at the same time amen nothing is too hard for God hallelujah think about that Jesus spirit is in the Saints all over the world but yet his spirit is still in heaven as well oh how great is our God makes want to sing that song How great is Our God sing with me how great you cannot limit God we will not limit the Holy One of Israel we'll let him be all that he says he is and we'll love him for all that he is oh hallelujah thank you Jesus and brother Bram said it was the same for Jesus Jesus's body prayed to the spirit that was inside of it and also in heaven at the same time Hallelujah now how many know the scripture God is not the author of confusion see he's not trying to confuse you but he is showing you how great he is and that he cannot be limited and and brother bam says we in our finite Minds we cannot understand an infinite being completely Hallelujah and brother said then he'll take all eternity brother Irvin to reveal himself to us Hallelujah we'll have new bodies we'll have a new spirit a new mind we'll have no sin and yet Jesus will still be teaching us all throughout eternity that's the kind of God I want to serve right there and there's no end to it sister s sister Ruth there's no end to Eternity now I don't know how to explain that but we are going to be learning about Christ and God throughout all eternity and remember God keeps his headship remember First Corinthians 11 here's the order it's woman who's above woman man who's above man Christ who's above Christ God that's the word of God is that right Christ was the body was always submissive to the father just like that Pillar of Fire at the beginning was always submissive to the invisible spear behind it yet not two persons one person oh I like those Smiles amen hallelujah okay we're doing really good on time here by God's grace where am I at okay only at 49 minutes okay great this is better than I thought I've been just trying to hit the highlights here by God's grace okay now I want to go to the Book of John go to John 14 here that's the scripture I want to look up here yeah John 1428 but Levi when you get that can you read that brother John 1428 so now let's look at a little bit on the body of Jesus versus the god inside of him okay so whenever you ready brother uh John 14:28 ye have heard how that I said to you I go away and come again unto you if you love me you would Rejoice because I said I go unto the father for my father is greater than I amen how many can say Amen to that amen so the body of Jesus says there's something greater than me now think about that he's got all of God's spirit inside of him but he says the the father is greater than the son in other words the spirit of God the invisible spirit of God is greater than the flesh body of Jesus and the church said amen see we can't throw that verse out we got to keep that verse praise God Amen but it's true the spirit of God is greater than the body it created it's just like a glove who's greater brother John the glove you put on or the hand in the glove what's who's greater hand in the glove the hand Amen Hallelujah Jesus was like the his body was like the glove brother R say it's like a mask it's God just changing his mask God hid behind the pillar of fire then God hid behind mezc and then God hid behind his son Jesus Christ and he said the father's greater than I who's the great one the great one is the invisible Spirit behind the veil praise God Amen Hallelujah but then God says I'll put all of my spirit all my power all my authority inside that body inside that Veil and the fullness of God will be inside of that Veil praise God Oh Glory see that one always stumbles the trinitarian right because their Creed says the son is equal to the father and no less well that's the verse I bring out right there well your Creeds lie because Jesus said the father is greater than I and the church there amen right it don't take much to throw these trinitarians off because what they they don't even really realize what their Creed says the Bible's not the problem their Creed is the problem so all she need is a couple verses the Creed says uh the father is equal to the Son and the son's equal to the Father the father's equal to the Holy Ghost but the Bible said the Father the Son said the father's greater than I so I stand with the Bible amen the the hand is greater than the glove Hallelujah and church that's what you are you're a glove too may God put his hand in your life today may God put his word in your mouth today praise God and God will use you for his glory that's what I'm hoping is happening right now God is using me as a glove and God's speaking and revealing himself to each one of you that's what every real preacher wants to do like brother said the real gift of God is to get out of the way get the glove out of the way right so the so God can put his hand in there and God can use the gift praise God Amen like I was so blessed that last time couple times I preached on the baptism of Holy Ghost I think five people in here came up now some of the aren't here tonight five people came up and said I was just praying and wondering about the baptism of the Holy Ghost that morning Hallelujah that's what I love when God steps in and God speaks to individuals because he's a discerner the word is a discerner or a judge of the thoughts and intents of the heart and that's how you know God is present hallelujah amen that's right amen and remember that that guest preacher his daughter that night before was at the altar till midnight at asking God for the Holy Ghost and then I come in and preach on the Holy Ghost the very next day hallelujah amen and look and this why I told my church look how humble she was she didn't even get the Holy Ghost because there's a time and place for you to be born but she still came back even though God didn't give it to her she still still came back the next day wantan to worship God and sing God and hear the word of God that's what I call love for God Amen that's right Hallelujah and doesn't that remind us what Jesus said in patience possess your souls that's what we need in America there's a lot of patience praise God right we want everything now speak the word brother speak the word speak to the mountain what if God didn't tell you to speak to the mountain yet what if it ain't time to speak to the mountain then you got to wait right but see Christians in a lot of Christians in America and other developed countries they just want easy religion microwave religion oh just speak the word all your problems will be gone speak the word but that's not how that's not how it always works Hallelujah brother Ram said when Paul was a prisoner to Christ he couldn't cast the devil off that woman with the spirit of Divination in the book of Acts until it was time the Bible said Paul had to wait on God and then finally after numerous days the Bible said he was grieved in his spirit and he said come out of her in the name of Jesus Christ and she came out that hour praise God that's what we need church we got to be prisoners we got to be prisoners for Jesus Christ amen that's right Hallelujah you got to wait on the Lord we must wait on God so I just showed you there the son he says the son says the father is greater than I the invisible spirit is greater than the manifestation amen the spirit is greater than the creation Oh Glory the Creator is greater than the creation hallelujah amen amen hallelujah I'm just trying to clinch that nail brother Iran really put that in I want to put it in all the way hallelujah amen so we know the word of God we know the truth it's finished Hallelujah we've got confidence in God's word hallelujah amen here's another one John 5:19 John 5:19 brother Arley will you read that John 5:19 brother RAM used this all the time to tell people that brother random could not heal anybody when he wanted to brother r could not see a vision every time he wanted to and the same thing was true with Jesus Jesus did not he had he healed so many people the Bible said they couldn't even fill the world with books about it but there were times he couldn't heal people because of unbelief or it wasn't the father's will and this is the verse brother R used so Arley when you're ready John 5:19 then Jesus and said unto them verily verily I say unto you the son can do nothing of himself but what he sees the father do for whatsoever he does also the son like Hallelujah the son does what the son does nothing of himself Amen brother mam said Jesus flesh body had no power to do any Miracles now he had Authority Hallelujah but he said I can do nothing of myself in other words brother said see Jesus operated by Vision hallelujah amen Jesus he said I can do nothing except the father shows me first same thing in brother Ram's life right but brother Ram was a sinner saved by grace Jesus was a sinless Son of God born of a virgin hallelujah it's exactly right so see we cannot forget these verses Jesus said the father's greater than I Jesus said I can do nothing except the father shows me first amen hallelujah and neither can you or I do anything they asked brother Ram in 1964 they said is it possible for you to speak us into existence so I'm sorry Speak the Rapture into resistance so we get he said so we get bodies that are Rapture Ready and brother he said because of the squirrels and things like that how many know brother spoke squirrels into existence how many know brother spoke the storms and they left amen well they asked him well brother Ram if you God could have you do that could you speak us into Rapture condition with new bodies brother said I see what you're saying and I'm paraphrasing he said but I never asked the father to speak the squirrels the father told me to do and the church said amen amen so like you can't walk out here and say I want corn this afternoon Corn's going to come up brother John Corn's going to come up I'm calling no you can't do anything except God shows you first amen that's right you got a good thought I mean there's power in the spoken word but I didn't do that on myself God showed me that Hallelujah like my brother cam one time the anointing came on brother Cam and he was talking to his friend and his friend's like hey I'm going to go hunting tomorrow and the Holy Ghost fell on brother cam he started crying he said speak and whatever you speak you'll Harvest it tomorrow this was like 10 years ago and the brother said I want a eighto buck Cam said it's yours call me tomorrow after you get it cam studied all morning he's going to preach you know he's studying pretty soon he gets a call and he says well how was your eighto buck he say it was wonderful amen he sent him a picture of it wow now Cam's not done that since but it was God showing us when God wants to do something he's going to speak his word and you just got to open up your mouth we can do nothing except the father shows us first we've got to do what our we got to do what God calls us to do praise God Amen that's right we can only speak what God call tells us to speak Hallelujah that's right amen amen is that right now we want to be positive the Bible says there's power of life and death in the tongue right we want to be positive but it's not from God it's not guaranteed to happen unless it's from God right like a lot of people were expecting Oh Billy Paul uh I'm sorry Los Angeles is GNA fall in the ocean before Billy Paul died that's not even on tape I never put any I never put any weight on that quote because it was never it was never it's never a quote on tape see as much as people can speak and oh we'll speak it and all these things it wasn't from God it wasn't a word of God if God said anything it's going to come to pass amen he said my word will not return void praise God I doubt for me I doubt that it was even said I don't even know but I look at the fruits of people's Ministries Ministries that worship brother brandom I don't take a I don't put any weight on things they say hallelujah but when God leads you you to speak something it's going to happen now listen church this is interesting too I have a we have a couple sorry we have a uh we have families in our church that can't have babies they're married they can't have babies and I don't understand why we have family members and things but on two occasions God has called someone in our church and then me myself to speak babies and they came so the first one was brother Jose I don't know if you remember brother Jose he's the Nicaraguan brother our church he's got gray hair he goes a real big beard like Moses it looks like we were at his uh we were at his nephew's house and and they wanted prayer they wanted to have children we're just praying and he's he's got his guitar we're just singing Amazing Grace I felt the spirit of God fall we're we weeping and crying and brother Jose said God heard your prayer you're going to have a baby and I was like I hope I sure hope that was from God well 10 months later the baby was born on my birthday they sent me a picture happy birthday brother Jesse this boy was born on your birthday and they could not have babies beforeand wow God then there was a coworker named Nikki at our school and she would we were Christians and we would just talk and she'd say my husband and I can't have babies and I was just studying on baress right so I said let me come over I'll do a Bible study so we had a big group I did a Bible study and she's like well we just can't have babies we tried I was in my prayer one morning I was just praying all of a sudden I started weeping and crying and I said I speak to that mountain of baress in Nicki's life I speak to that mount in the name of Jesus Christ it's going to move amen I didn't even know what I was doing I just felt emotional I was crying I went upstairs I talked to my wife and said honey I just spoke something in the name of the Lord but don't don't tell anybody cuz I didn't know it was just God couple days later I was pushing my kids on the swing you know how they like to be pushing I got a ding I checked my phone and the woman's there with her husband they got the pregnancy test saying we're pregnant I said Hallelujah nine months later they had a baby named Mary I said and I told her afterward I said I spoke to that mountain Jesus said speak to the mountain and it'll be moved but brother R says you can't do it when you want to you got to be led by God to do it amen oh and then for more on that then the woman they want to have more kids then she said she had a dream of me praying for them to have more children than they had twins I said I don't know why God God just puts his servants in there I don't know why I'm just we're just Servants of God she and she told me that I had a dream of you and now we had twins I said well I don't know it just it's God's people God just God backs up his word if you believe God's word God will vindicate you praise God Amen that's right now in my mind why don't I go to church and then speak to the mountain of baroness in this church in my family or I I can't do it till God tells me to do it right and if you've heard brother R brother R say the same thing people want him to pray and speak the word or have Vision he's like I can't have a vision unless God shows it to me do you remember sister stad cleff from Germany remember that story there was a German uh military man named uh Julius stad cleff his wife had a baby the baby died and the woman called brother Bram and said brother Braham we will my my husband he's in charge of the military we'll fly you over to Germany to raise the baby up and brother Bram said I appreciate your faith he said but let me get father's word on it first a prophet of God and and she had seen the baby in Mexico raised from the dead she saw that so she's like surely God's going to do it for me and I I want brother R to speak to speak the word what brother Ram do the Bible brother R said he went out to his cave he prayed all night he come back in uh sister Ma you know tell her I don't have a word from the Lord yet he went out a second time and he said when he went the second time the Holy Spirit told him he said don't rebuke that that's the hand of the Lord something awful would have happened to that baby if it got older and brother R went back and told me to tell that to sister stadle and sister stadle said she said brother was there something wrong with my faith and brother R said no you had great faith because you were asking God for a miracle but that's a a perfect example brother and then the Lutheran Pastor saw that story and he said I appreciate a man like brother random who will wait on a clear-cut decision from God before he says something in the name of the Lord amen amen amen in other words brother Ram can do nothing of himself brother Levi and brother Irving can do nothing of themselves we can only do what the father tells us to do praise God exactly right amen amen same thing with Jesus yes the whole point of all those stories I guess is to say that Jesus said I can do nothing except the father shows me praise God and brother Ram says sister SF you have great faith you would have flew me all the way over to Germany just to pray for your dead baby that's great faith so see church when bad things happen don't think you have little faith remember you have great faith amen because you just want God to move but sometimes God calls his children home precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his Saints all right now let me try to bring this down to a close where am I at I'm at a hour and six you've been a good audience you've been patient audience nobody's thrown any Tomatoes at me today by God's grace now of course nobody ever will you're sweet people hallelujah so let's let's go if you got your Bibles go to 1 Corinthians 15:22 1 Corinthians 15:22 I got a couple more points I'm going to bring it down to close this Oneness between the father and the son it's so beautiful the son is always in subject to the father I'll say it again the son will always be obedient to the father all throughout eternity Jesus says all the he said all power in Heaven and Earth is given unto me but there will come a time when Jesus will become subject to the father and I'm very careful in my words here because I don't want to take anything away from the Bible subject in order in other words in back in submission to the word of I'm sorry back back in submission to the father right now he's got all power all authority but the Bible says and brother Ram says this in questions and answers 1964 he uses the scripture when everything is finished when the armageddon's finished the millenniums finished gag meog is finished the white Throne judgment is finished and the future home comes down Hallelujah and we're all living in the city when everything's finish at some point Jesus will give and he'll give the kingdom back to the father now hopefully that doesn't blow your mind too much but if it does good for you say Amen to it because it's right in the Bible it's not it's not something outside the Bible it is in the Bible see because the Creator will always be greater than the creation 1 Corinthians 15:22 for as in Adam all die even so in Christ shall all be made alive but every man in his own order Christ the first fruits afterward they that are Christ that is coming then cometh the end now look then cometh the end the end of time how many know there's a time after the M after the Millennium and after the white Throne judgment there's coming a time when there's no more time right amen hallelujah amen that's the end the end of time at the end of time then cometh the end the Bible says when he shall have delivered up the kingdom of God Jesus is going to deliver to the father here's the kingdom that you gave me I'm bringing it I'm delivering it back up to you and the church said he's got all power all authority in Heaven and Earth but when the end comes he says he comes back to the father and father I've been faithful I've been a good and faithful son amen hallelujah and I'm delivering this Kingdom back to you Hallelujah I can't explain it brother Irvin I just believe it know God's not three persons that's that's what I know for sure cuz remember that's that's Egyptian that's always a pagan false Doctrine remember the uh I'll just briefly remember the every false Doctrine has always had three Gods right in Egypt it was Osiris Isis and Horus and I I I wrote about it in my book every false religion has always had three Gods because Satan is trying to copy God but Satan cannot be God so he just ver he just perverts God's word right see every false religion has these three Gods but it's not three Gods there's only really one God now back to 1 Corinthians 15 verse 24 then cometh the end when he shall have delivered up to the kingdom to God even the father when he shall put down all Rule and all authority and all power so this is after the devil's been Cast Lake of Fire thank God how you looking forward to that day no more death devil how about all the demons amen how about all sickness how about all disease there's coming a day when it shall be no more praise God all rule all principality Powers all sin and disease and darkness and wickedness all evil will be cast out and Jesus delivers up the kingdom to God again huj hallelujah amen we're back in Eden brother hallelujah we're going back to the Garden of Eden but now it's not a garden now it's a holy city hallelujah amen Hallelujah verse 25 for he must Reign to as he hath put all enemies under his feet so now we know Jesus Reigns until all enemies are under his feet then he delivers the kingdom back to the father amen this is your kingdom father it's a lot like at the beginning right Jesus the pillar of fire and the invisible spirit it's his it's your kingdom everything came from you father oh hallelujah amen verse 26 six The Last Enemy that should be destroyed is death hallelujah thank God Hallelujah for he has put all things under his feet but when he saith all things are put under him it is Manifest that he has expected which did put all things under him other words we know where how how all got put under Jesus through God's power it was made manifest through the power of God this Holy Spirit working through Jesus's body verse 28 here it is and when all things shall be subdued unto him then shall the son also be subject unto him that put all things under him that God may be all in all right now Jesus has all power all authority but when death is put away all sickness is put away then Jesus delivers the kingdom see I'm very careful which words I'm using he delivers the kingdom and says father it's your kingdom Hallelujah Hallelujah that's why Jesus said pray to the heavenly father Our Father Who Art in Heaven HED be your name Hallelujah remember in John 20: 17 if you got your Bible go there John 20:7 just come to my mind here John 2017 there uh brother Daniel when you get that would you read that here's Jesus after the resurrection notice what he says look what notice what he says about God and the father go brother Daniel whenever you're ready brother no rush Jesus sayith unto her touch me not for I am not yet ascendant to my fathers but go to my brethren and say unto them I Ascend unto my father and your father and to my God and your God amen he said I'm ascending to my father and my God what's talking there the flesh is talking the flesh had a father that created it the flesh had a God that created it he said don't he said don't worry I'm ascending up to my God and my father your father your God Hallelujah the flesh had a Creator Hallelujah but yet then there's times that God would speak right through Jesus right let's go to John 14 I'm I'm almost done here I appreciate your patience you've been a wonderful group of Believers here John 148 Philip saith unto him Lord show us the father and it will satisfy us just show me the father and look what the father says right and Jesus said to him have I been so long time with you and yet thou Hast not known me Phillip he that has has seen me hasth seen the father and how sayest thou then show us the father amen man amen see sometimes God would speak right through him and then sometimes Jesus's Humanity would speak Hallelujah brother R said that's the mystery the mystery is with the Son and the father and I I think I wrote this in my book too trinitarians believe in three persons right but I we can at least narrow it down to two persons now we know it's one person right but in other words I have more respect for people that believe God's two persons than three because the Holy Spirit and the father are the selfs same person because the father's holy Jesus called him Holy Father and the Holy Ghost conceived the body of Jesus if the father and the Holy Ghost are two separate persons Jesus had two different dads brother use that all the time right because Jesus was conceived of the Holy Spirit whoever conceives is the father so that's where trinitarians get mixed up well who's the father which does he have two dads he was con see by the Holy Ghost but his father is the old man with the great beard so we can see how the father and the Holy Ghost are the self-saving person so I have more respect for people that believe God's two persons than three but we know he's not two he's one amen but the mystery is between the father and the son and did you notice in Paul's verse in Colossians 2:2 Paul never said H the mystery of Father God father son Holy Ghost right I believe that's Paul showing how the real mystery is between the father and the son hallelujah amen it's been good to be in the house of the Lord today amen that's right I'm almost done I'm almost done you've had a great audience here hallelujah hallelujah now let me close why is this so important now this is now this next thought is my thought I could be wrong on this but in Matthew 13:33 Jesus tells a parable of a woman who hid three measures I'm sorry hid Le in three measures a meal and then this meal expanded until everything was leav now anyone that knows their Bible brother said it too leav is sin which woman would put sin in her bread or her Doctrine and then her Doctrine become fully corrupt is that the bride of Christ or is that the Roman Catholic Church that's the Roman Catholic Church three measures father son Holy Ghost three persons Holy Ghost whatever they do I don't know that woman is the Roman Catholic Church she injected that three measures of Trinity in there and now look what it's become not only you know uh just in Philadelphia uh there was a there was investigation and they found hund hundreds of thousands of abuse cases just in Philadelphia of priests molesting boys and girls and then they did it then they did a further investigation and the nuns were guilty as well molesting children that's just in one place so see how this see how you know one false Doctrine if it's not repented of it's not taken care of it will spread to the whole thing amen and we see it message churches they get one false Doctrine if they don't take care of that what does it become now they baptize in William brandom's name now they worship brother brandham right if or the now it's return Ministry brother's got to come back and and give us rapturing faith if you've got the Holy Ghost you've got rapturing faith amen hallelujah that's right praise God brother R said his ministry was the teaching Reign the former rain and brother said then comes the latter rain which is rapturing Faith Hallelujah Glory that's right that's right church and brother R says plainly the bride will have unleavened she'll be unle to the word so this this woman cannot be the bride of Christ it must be the Roman Catholic church and then you see this woman in Revelation 18:4 she's a cage full of unclean and hateful Birds she's full of it like that full of sin just like that bread was full of Leaven amen glory where did it start with this false baptism in father son Holy Ghost and then they made a pope office somebody show me where the word Pope is in in the Bible it ain't even in the Bible they call him Holy Father and that's blasphemy there's only one time holy father's used that's when Jesus prayed in John 17 he said Holy Father keep them uh through your name that thou has given me praise God Amen and they steal the title of God and they give it to a man who's not holy at all my goodness now what does this boil down to now if you got your Bible Revelation 13:6 I'm almost done Revelation 13:6 and U sister Ruth would you read that when you get that Revelation 136 amen who's listening to the seals lately brother Ram uses the scripture and brother Ram said this is triple blasphemy so by the end of the church ages the Roman Catholic Church is guilty of triple blasphemy they blasphemed his name how did the Roman Catholic Church blaspheme the name of Jesus because they took the name of Jesus away and now they have titles Father Son and Holy Ghost who's everybody the Catholic wedding here anybody I've been to numerous Catholics weddings you know at the end of it what do they say they said I now marry you in the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost what but at our weddings I just married Austin Lena last month I said I now marry you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen hallelujah they take Jesus out of it and whose name is greater than Jesus in the Catholic Church Mary's name right got to pray your rosaries to Mary Mother holy mother of God all this nonsense they blashe the name of God by changing his name and then exalting Mary above Jesus amen that's right how do they Blasphemous Tabernacle our sister read it you know how they Blasphemous Tabernacle they call Rome the Eternal City of God that's blasphemy Revelation 18 shows that City will have an end to it hallelujah amen God will pour out his judgment upon that City amen because all the all the murders everything all the guilt goes back to there now there must be some crazy uh conspiracy theory here Rome must be behind everything right even this war in Israel all the the war in Ukraine somehow the Pope's behind it because the Bible says the Roman Catholic Church is guilty of all the murders it's in the Bible they're pulling strings behind the scenes that's right and what's the last one the Bible said they blasphemed the Saints in heaven and brother said they blashe the Saints because they pray to them right and the Bible said there's not there's not aund mediators there's one mediator between God and man the man Christ Jesus amen so why is this so important brother Jesse that I know God's not three persons because the end result of this if you accept a false Doctrine it leads to this it leads to a church full of sin full of false Doctrine but that's not the Church of Christ the Church of Christ is washed in the waters of the word hallelujah amen hallelujah she's a glorious Church Without spotle Hallelujah that's right amen and brother Ram said you can get the mark in your hand or your forhead the Bible says Amen brother man said what's the mark in the forehead he said the mark of in the forehead is accepting their trinitarian Doctrine wow think about that church we are one of the few people on Earth that don't believe in the Trinity or three Gods we're one of the few most people believe in a multiplicity of gods trinitarians believe in three Gods really that's what their Doctrine says right because the father's equal to the son son's equal to the father all this they believe in three gods and then Hindus have millions of gods right they can't even step on a little ant oh I offended oh offended my great great-grandfather whoever that is you know or someday that that might turn into me I might be that Aunt someday they have all these Gods right but we are the people of the one true God just like Jesus said here o Israel the Lord our God is one Lord hallelujah amen we're the same people with the same Faith the people of God who believe God is one person and we will not take the mark of the devil we'll take the mark of the Holy Ghost praise God let's stand to our feet Hallelujah thank you for your patience praise God how many enjoyed the word now everybody enjoyed the word of God Amen well thank you I appreciate that both my hands are up amen I enjoyed the word it's a good refresher to go over this as I said I had questions here and then I had questions I got email questions and everything like that that's just the highlights of course you could preach brother bam said he could only hit the highlights of all these topics he said you could take weeks and months just on one seal I could take weeks and months on the godhead and go through all these scriptures but the main thing we do is we never add to the word of God and we believe everything the Bible says about the godhead amen let's bow our heads here now as we bow our heads church if there's any needs afterwards we can have a prayer line if there's any needs at all but let's keep this a spiritual Atmosphere by the grace of God as I said earlier you never know when God is going to speak through someone right God can he's he's Almighty he could speak through a child he could speak through a young sister or an elderly brother you never know when God is going to move so we want to be sweet we want to be submissive to the Holy Spirit we want to be pleasing to God let's bow our heads for a moment Heavenly Father we thank you for today Lord God thank you for the patience of the Saints Lord God they've loved your word they've said amen they've raised their hands they've loved you they worship you today Father God lord I want to thank you for speaking your truth today I truly

word of God just as the body of Christ is so obedient to the invisible father help us Lord Jesus Hallelujah minister to our needs today Lord God Lord as we mention needs Lord if there's any needs I pray your people would call on you Lord Jesus the Bible says you're everpresent help in the time of trouble so Lord we love you here today God we worship you we give you thanks we give you praise Lord
