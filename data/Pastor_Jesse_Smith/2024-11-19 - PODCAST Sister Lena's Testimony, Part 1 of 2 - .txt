TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] God bless you and welcome to the defending the message podcast I'm your host Pastor Jesse Smith today's podcast we have a special testimony version of the podcast we're so thankful to have our sister Lena being able to share her testimony she's been a wonderful addition to our church since December 20121 uh many of you probably have downloaded brother Austin's testimony her husband it was one of our most downloaded uh podcasts over the last few years so I know it's been intriguing it's been inspiring uh it's been wonderful to see God do uh marvelous Works in people's lives God is the only one who can change a heart God rewrites our stories he saves to the utmost our God is worthy of all praise he's uh he's mighty to save as the scripture says so uh with that said uh we're recording with a live audience here so it's our evening service on a Sunday night by God's grace got a lot of young listeners up front they're going to do a great job of uh listening and uh so if you hear some laughing that's normal that's going to be part of the the service here uh everything will be edited it will sound the best it can possibly sound uh so the people can be blessed we've had numerous testimonies uh shared here we have more to come by God's grace and I've got a lot of good feedback on them especially with the sisters you know because you don't often hear around the message you don't hear you know testimonies of sisters and so I know the sisters testimonies have really blessed other people especially the sister who listen around the world to see how God is working with them and saving them uh helping them strengthening them um every testimony has a special ring to it as God's Prophet brother Bram told us so with that out of the way uh we'll have uh brother Austin here reintroduced himself again and then we'll have our sister uh talk about her the beginning of her life her testimony her childhood and her awareness of God as a child and then we'll move into how God has been dealing with her as she got older and then came to know the message and then special testim now that she's been in the message so with that out of the way here's brother Austin hey God bless you guys it's brother Austin um a lot has happened since that podcast that you heard of my testimony and um I wasn't even married yet so now you guys are going to be listening to my wife Lena and her testimony and how she was introduced into the message how she grew up and I'm really excited for you guys to hear this um God has done a lot of great things since he listened to my first testimony and and now we're going to share my wife's testimony so uh hope this is a blessing to somebody who's listening and you know God can save anybody thank you brother Austin and so now let's hear our sister's testimony uh we sure appreciate our sister Lena been a wonderful pillar in the church here and God's been working in her tremendously so sister if you could start uh tell us a little bit about yourself your childhood and uh just becoming aware of the Lord as a child okay God bless everybody I'm Lena um I grew up up in a Baptist Church in Stockton California when I was younger I didn't go there too long but it's just like what I remember in my early life pertaining to God so yeah I went to a Baptist Church my mom was really involved in the church and my dad was a deacon at church but the church itself wasn't really the best um I won't go too in depth with that but I did fall out of church due to like growing up and seeing like how my dad was a deacon in church but yet his home life didn't like really show it like he would come home and like just like was really without going too in deep just like really emotionally and physically like a piece on top of that like not being loyal to his wife so then like me seeing that that pulled me away because like I was just like what kind of man of God would do that so then it made me fall out of sorry guys I'm crying I wasn't planning to cry um anyways so yeah that had me fall out of church because I was just just like if this is what like people in church do I don't want anything to do with it because it was like really like a lot of people in church the church I grew up and was like not living the best so then I was just like I don't want anything to do it it never like had me turn cold shoulder towards God like I always had my own love for God you know and yeah like I had my own love for God but I just stopped going to church because I was like I don't want anything to do with it just because like just what I saw so then after that we just moved around a lot I don't really have like any special experiences when I was younger pertaining to God until like I got older probably like 17 19 is when I really started Experiencing God but other than that we just moved around a lot due to like certain situations my mother was in so we just had to move due to like for safety reasons so then like I moved from California to Arizona back and forth my whole life since I was younger and so like there's nothing really like significant spiritually that happened to me when I was younger just besides like when I was younger when I went to the Baptist church and then fell out but other than that that's it for Ping like my childhood with God we appreciate you sharing that sister yeah and uh you know we've you and I have connected on that you know with brother Austin we've connected on having a difficult home life uh growing up and so the Lord has kind of United Us in that aspect we've been United because Austin had a rough home life I had a rough home life my parents divorced and you've had a rough home life too so this is going to be a big part of your testimony although your life started off very difficult uh God is the great Redeemer and God's love we'll see is going to step into your life in a really powerful way here but I appreciate you being so sensitive to the Holy Spirit uh being so honest and transparent um and I believe this will help people too to know that even if you've been raised in a difficult home life where there's a lot of pain maybe a lot of suffering God Is Watching Over You God is uh he's seeing everything he's the God who sees and he's going to come and rescue his children he's so faith so we thank the Lord for that we thank the Lord for his grace uh protecting you all those years as well so now maybe we can get into your late teenage years as you said where God starts becoming real to you and uh we'll kind of hear how the Lord starts revealing himself to you so I grew up like in situations where like I had I was comfortable as a child like I was able to like rely on my mom and then like and like be able to have the things I need but then there was times where like I started over from like nothing like multiple times to the point like to this day it changed my mindset on things because it's just like at the end of the day like it's just materialistic things and I'm grateful that I went through that like it's unfortunate but I'm grateful because it like it made me like not really care about like material things in the world because like one moment like we're comfortable in the house next Moment Like We have nothing and we're like in the car or something so I'm really grateful about that um I moved around a lot in my childhood when I went to school it was nice my teachers always told me like yeah when you're here you're doing really good but then like I didn't really care to go I just did you know once I got to that age I was just like oh whatever it's whatever so I was like not really focused on school I was just like I fell into at a really young age I fell into like smoking and stuff like smoking THC is what I mean by that I don't know how I could explain that on here but like that's what I fell into at a young age um sad how young and then a little after that I fell into drinking very heavily cuz I was just like oh you know it's whatever who cares but then like anytime I got like super high or like super drunk I felt like so convicted like I would cry and i' be like God hates me why am I doing this and it's like I didn't even have a relationship with God but I still felt that way and I'm just like why am I doing this and then like once I would like sober up or whatever I'll still do it over and over and I'll still feel so like convicted and bad cuz I'm just like why are you doing these things but I didn't really care like I didn't really care about myself I like really cared about what happened to me it was just like oh whatever I was just like in a really dark place before God pulled me out and I was just like and I was just the Life I Lived all the way up until I met Austin and then he talked to me about the message that we'll get into later but I was just just living life of sin not caring and just being like in a really dark spot in my life um I even like had to graduate late because I like wasn't focused whatsoever like even my my teachers would be like Lena you have to show up you know cuz like you're really smart when you're here you know you got to you we we want you to graduate but I was like I didn't care I was just like uh whatever it's just it's not a big deal to me and then until it became a big deal I'm like oh no I have to graduate so then that's when I really went all in with school and then finally graduated but without going to details that was just like my life I just I didn't really care for much it was just like whatever whatever happens happens but yet I was still like so convicted I always felt bad for the way I was living like I walk out of the house and I'm just like like what are you doing but I'm I just ignored it like I just ignored that voice I'm just like like oh whatever and just continue to sin continue to drink continue to do like all those things it's not right regardless like no matter what age you are but it's just like I started so young I think I was like 14 15 when I started doing all those things and it's I it's heartbreaking think about and then like sometimes not knowing where you're going to lay your head to like maybe finally getting comfortable somewhere just for it to be all like snatched from under you so yeah certainly amazing to see how uh the Lord was with you despite the homelessness the instability uh losing everything uh the uncertainty of life you know you said the voice of God would say what are you doing you know that's the built-in conscience you know so even in that you know God was dealing with you uh working with you and uh basically helping to helping you to know that what you were doing with was wrong and we've all gone through that you know to some degree some levels more than others but it's wonderful to see that God was right there with you um he showed you what was right showed you what was wrong and a lot of times we have to go through difficult things so that we can really hunger for the good things and the the love of God the mercy of God the grace of God so I appreciate you sharing about that you know all of our listeners you know if you've uh ever battled with some of these things this will speak right to your life you know uh also gives us such an Assurance no matter how desperate your situation is no matter how much pain and suffering you've gone through when it seems like you have nothing you still have God you still have God's love you still have God's care you still have God's mercy and his grace so it's so comforting to know that uh despite our sister going through some of these very traumatic childhood experiences God was right there and God was convicting her God was ultimately protecting her and taking care of her please pardon the interruption I'd like to remind our listeners about two resources that will greatly strengthen your faith according to my humble opinion in 2019 I wrote the book called restoring Christian modesty it's over 120 Pages showing the Bible foundations for a modest and holy appearance it covers all the guidelines for modest clothing and also covers bracelets necklaces Rings earrings nose rings and many more topics one of the most useful parts of this book is the chapter that shows the history of the United States and how they slowly rejected modest clothing and it Chronicles all these changes decade by decade from the 1800s to the present and the second resource is my 2021 book it's an 82-page book about the 12 New Testament Mysteries that brother Brandon finished according to revelation 10: brother random said the seventh Church age messenger would finish all these mysteries in the sermon called is this the sign of the end sir from December 1962 friends this is an extensive Bible teaching on the major doctrines that brother renham gave us proving he was the seventh Church age messenger a genuine prophet of God and the Elijah Prophet to restore all things in a time when so many people are falling away from the message I feel these two resources will strengthen your faith if you want God to draw closer to you you've got to draw closer to him and many times that's through prayer Bible study worship so I know these two resources will be a great help to you they're available on Amazon I'm not a book salesman so if you can't afford them I'll gladly email you the free PDFs you can read them on your phone or tablet or print them off if you like recall acts 17:1 the Brians were more noble because they search the Scriptures Daily to prove the things that Paul taught were true and so we must do the same thing today if we're spiritual nobility if we're spiritual royalty in the family of the Lord Jesus Christ the family of King Jesus then we should search the Scriptures Daily to prove brother Ram's teachings where thus sayith the word of God thank you for your time now back to the content so now let's Jump Ahead a little bit to where U sister Lena meets brother Austin when I first met Austin it was in Lake Habu Arizona um my mom mom my siblings and I all moved there to a domestic violence place that was like out in Lake Abu and it was right next door to a Dollar General where Austin was working so we went there all the time and then like every time I would go in I'm just like I'll be nervous like I never said anything to him but I'll just like see him and I'm like oh wow you know so that's when we first met and like I think we like talked once we were like oh he as me if um I braid hair cuz his hair was long and he's like do you braid hair and I'm like no he's like oh okay and I think like that's the first time we talked and then I'll just go in there all the time and like not really say anything and then after that we left that town for a while probably like six months or so um we left that town and then we moved back and we still didn't I still didn't see him when we first moved back it was a while since we've been back in Habu since we I ran back into Austin and then one day I was just hanging out with friends by the river and then one of my friends is like waving at someone and I'm just like who is she waving at and she calls me over she's like look and then it was him and I was just like oh hey and then that's when we started to hang out and that's like when we bump back into each other and like from that moment on we would just like talk we didn't really like hang out as much since it was like right when the pandemic started so we would just like text and talk a lot and then after we started to hang out for a while and then like in May is when like we officially started like dating I guess and then the rest is history that's just like the summary of it just like same life I was just still living in sin and not really caring like I was still in like a really depressive state of mind and still just like living however not really caring and I was like oh yeah nice I got this guy is pretty cool hanging talking to him so that was nice but I was still like uh it's whatever life is whatever but still had that like conviction of like anytime I was just like under the influence I was just like so sad and depressed and I was just cry I'm just like what are you doing like and it's crazy that I felt that way cuz like I had like no relationship with God like yeah always knew God was real and like I prayed sometimes you know little to none never read my Bible but yeah I still felt awful anytime I would like just do those things and I'm just like I don't know why I'm doing this you know God hates me why am I doing this and then I'll still like I said still do it even though I felt that way or like even like my UNM modest appearance I would like why walk out the house and I'll still like feel like I don't know how to explain but like I felt guilty for the way I walked out the house cuz I'm just like I shouldn't be doing this but yet I'm still doing it who cares kind of mindset no like I said I don't it's just very real that I even felt that way like I cuz I had no relationship with God like yeah I knew he was of course I knew he was real I know he's real but I was just like whatever I'll live however I want to live you know God loves me for who I am he knows I mistake which is just like not okay but yeah that's it besides that and then up to that just living the same just not living the way the Lord would have wanted me to yeah again wonderful to see how uh you have that conviction you know the way you were dressing or the the substance abuse you know God's conviction was right there built into you I think Romans 1 and Romans 2 talk about that God puts a conscience in each and every one of us you know so it's wonderful to see how God was active right there and you're aware of that and really like the Bible says you know just like all of us we were under the prince and power of the air as Ephesians 2:2 says walking in the ways of the children of Disobedience uh but God was going to come rescue our sister Lena just like God rescues all of us that are believers so now we'd like to hear how brother Austin shared the gospel with sister Lena there you've already heard a little bit about it if you've heard our previous versions but it's awesome to hear it from another perspective we'll let our sister Lena share how it impacted her how it came to her and I know you'll be blessed by God's grace so the way Austin told me about the message was um it was just one random day we're sitting down watching TV and one day he was just like I don't remember how the conversation started but it started and then he was just he sat me down and he was just talking to me I think it was like um three almost three hours I could be wrong but like couple hours long of him telling me about the message and like how this church is like the message is different and like how the bride of Christ Fellowship is a different from all these other churches and then like due to my past I was just like doubting at first cuz I'm just like I don't know you know cuz like my experience my own experiences wasn't great like there's the pastor at the church was you know taking TI money for his own special like things he need for himself and like while people here struggling are like my dad is a deacon but yet coming home doing all these things and like mistreating his wife in every way you can think of and then so I'm just like I don't know but then like he's just sitting down talking to me like very passionate about and I don't think I really like respond that much I think I just like mainly just like listened really to what he was saying CU I'm just like taking it all in and then like um couple hours go by he's just like yeah like Lena you you know it's it's like this is really God like the holy spirit's there and stuff and then like he asked me to move here with him and then like towards the end of the conversation you know like I was fing the pool and I'm like okay yeah I'll do it and then like after that you know after the conversation was done like a few days go by and I'm I started like doubting a lot like I really thought I we would have to like break up because I'm like I can't I don't know like I don't know if I can do this like like I'm I was just really doubting because I'm like I don't I don't want to move to Ohio and it's like it's the same thing like that I grew up in or like I experienced or like I've been around I don't I don't want that so I just really doubting I was sad too because I was like I'm going to have to we're going to have to like split up I can't I won't be able to go with him kind of mindset and then one day I was at work I worked at a Goodwill um and I was just restocking the shelves and then it's like this lady comes up to me [Music] and I'm paraphrasing cuz I don't remember exactly what she said but she was just like you know the Lord has a plan for my life and like this life is temporary and you know there's bigger greater things like I said in paraphrasing I could be I don't really remember what she said but it was just like basically that and then like from that moment I felt that was it was definitely LED of the Lord because that's when that like I was really doubting really hard like cuz I didn't I wasn't going to move here I was just like no I I can't and then like when she said that I was just like it was just a Vindication for me that I'm supposed to be here and that the Lord wanted me here um probably it's just what I remember I'm probably missing a lot but like that's just how I remember the story yeah sounds like to me almost like a word of knowledge you know the Bible said knowledge is understanding and Jesus said knowledge opens up doors so you were doubting going through all this doubt and then this this this woman brings a word to give you understanding and that's the moment that the peace of God came on you and would allow you do such a drastic thing as moving across the country without any family or friends and trusting this handsome young guy here uh brother Austin by God's grace but yeah it's awesome to see how God sends you the right person at the right time again God is always on time he's never late so it's awesome to see how you got a word at just the right time to help lead you and guide you into all truth mhm so yeah so once I decided to well not I decided once the Lord showed me that I'm supposed to be here you know we started saving money to plan a trip to move here um but it was it was hard saving money when because I was not a good sa I'm still learning you know better than I was but I'm still learning so like anytime I got money I was just like oh you know whatever one CU like probably the way I grew up and I was just like oh anytime we got money just spend it on whatever so then it was really tough saving for the move until once my mom one of my sisters and I we got into a accident with a semi Tru that hit us and then I'm I'm saying this cuz it's going to lead up to the reason we moved here um we got into an accident with the semi truck who hit us and then like it was just like this whole lawsuit going on that I honestly forgot about until years later until like around the time we're moving here um the lawyers got into touch with us and they're like they set us down you know talk to us about it like yeah you guys are finally get us getting a settlement and stuff all these years later I was just like oh I forgot about that I didn't even know we were going to get money for it so it wasn't much but um I feel like the Lord allowed the settlement to come at that time because because of that we had enough to move out here to get us here so as soon as we got the settlement we bought our train tickets here we took a Am track all the way here I think it was like 36 hours probably like 2 days on the train to get here and all we had was like three bags all together of like our clothes like and like maybe like a pillow and a blanket just to move here um but to go backwards I'm all over the place I'm sorry um going back the day we were leaving it was just like some issue with our luggage that we probably like weren't able to bring it or something and then Austin's like no you know let's just postpone and let's wait let's just like get our money back in um just wait until you know we're able to figure this out and I'm like no we have to go because if we keep postponing it we won't go so then we're just like all right we're doing it and by the grace of God when we got there you know they were fine with our luggage and literally like right when we got to Cleveland our last stop they're like oh you guys have too much stuff you can't do that anymore we're just like oh well praise God we we made it to our destination by the grace of God so that was pretty like a spiritual thing to me it was a blessing for sure yeah I remember that was part of Austin's testimony too like you know he was battling should we go or maybe we should not go and yet then God used you to help give him courage uh to go that's inspiring reminds us of Rebecca you know they asked Rebecca do you want to go she's like I want to go right now you know so it reminds me of that too God gave you the leadership and the courage to want to go very good so that day always be etched in my memory uh December 10 2021 it was Lydia's birthday was it your 17th birthday it was Lydia's 17th birthday my oldest child turned 17 and Austin said uh can you come pick us up in Cleveland like at 5:00 a.m. or 5:30 so I got up you know about 400 something like that went up to pick them up I was elated to see them I was a little nervous driving around Cleveland at you know 5: in the morning but um I was elated to see them it's so great to see Austin and uh funny story was that when I was putting the luggage into the car or in the trunk I didn't see his head and I kind of closed the trunk on his head and um I I've apologize for that over and over again I'm going apologize now again brother Alon I'm sorry you I I didn't mean to do that to you brother um that was just a fun thing that happened or unfortunate thing that happened there uh on that morning uh but since then we've had him back here and we'll let sister Lena share here how she adjusted to being an akine and how the Lord was gracious to her as she uh settled into uh her final destination by God's grace when I first got here to Ohio I was really excited but yet very nervous like super nervous thought I was nervous before this podcast I was no that was a different kind of nervous I didn't know what to expect I didn't know how people would treat me here but oh that was just like my own nervousness because from first met brother Jesse very kind you know it was funny the trunk thing was pretty funny but you know very kind man definitely felt God on him and then I don't remember if it was the following day or the night we got there but we went over to brother Jesse's house and I was nervous because I'm like oh what are they going to think of me you know are they going to think I'm weird you know judge me but no it was like the total opposite like from the moment I walked through the door it was just like love nothing but love there and I was just like a yeah this is nice and like meeting everybody was really amazing everyone was so nice very kind to me um like it was Lydia's birthday so I remember them opening up G opening gifts so yeah it was it was the night of then so yeah she was opening gifts and everything and I'm just quiet just sitting around just watching I'm just like okay this is still nervous but I'm like everyone's really kind um definitely the spirit of God in that home absolutely like I like I've never felt and it was beautiful um and then I remember we were leaving and one of the little girls gave me a hug and everyone was like she never hugs anyone and I was just like oh wow this is amazing won't say her name or anything but it was aaz I was just like oh really so that I don't know that just made me really happy I just wanted to throw that in there um and then from that moment on I was still nervous just felt like no one here like no one at all ever made me feel any kind of way everyone was loving there was there were never judgy they talk to me like you know like a like they've known me my whole life so no one here ever made me feel any kind of way but like myself I felt like really convicted like when I didn't right when I came came I didn't like immediately change my appearance you know I still had like piercings in my face you know but yet no one said a thing about it you know and it was just beautiful and I was just very grateful for it of course like during the sermons it was preached about just as it should be because like that's the Holy Spirit speaking so I was just like okay taking all that in but yet like still right away I was just like really nervous I just like I don't I don't know I just very convicted I felt very pressured to like I feel like I felt like I should already have my whole life figured out I should have been like got it all together from the moment I got here and I was just like oh I just feel like people want me to change already but like no one ever made me feel that way and I want to make that clear no one here ever made me feel that way it was just my own my own thoughts my own like just me being hard on myself on top of that like the conviction of the Holy Spirit like as it should be you know cuz obviously I wasn't living the best still but um I would tell Austin that he was like no he he would always be like no it's like no one feels that way like that's just like that's just you you know like no one here is making you feel that way I'm like I know I know and then it's like you know always he always talked me down and I just really appreciated that but then slowly but surely I started you know changing and I remember like when I officially took my the rest of my earrings and like piercings out it was like one Bible study and it wasn't even like about piercings or anything but one of the little girls were like they asked a question about earrings oh yeah they were like if um if you can you compliment someone's earrings or something or like something like that and then you know paraphrasing I don't remember exactly what was said but brother Jesse was like you know it's best to just like stay away from it and like don't really remember what said so I'm not even going to try but basically just like probably don't do that and I don't know like when she said that I felt really confined and like I was just sitting there and I just like immediately like took them all out took everything else out and just like threw it away cuz I just like felt like that was the Lord like letting me know like hey you know time to like get rid of all that so then that's when I finally took all of my PS my earrings and my um piercings out wardrobe wise like my clothing it took me a little bit longer to like finally start justing modest one for like financially but by the grace of God one of the sisters in the church definitely helped um by giving me like some skirts and stuff to start off with and that was definitely a blessing I didn't start like right away I kind of like I was so used to dressing and modest for so long like wearing pants and stuff for so long so like I didn't right away just like go all the way in to just like dressing modest so like here and there I would still like wear my pants but like wear the skirts also sometimes and then until eventually I don't remember when but I just was like felt L to just like get rid of like all of my modest clothing so I just like threw it all out and it was just like by the grace of God it wasn't it wasn't me it was definitely the Lord like leading me to like get rid of all those inm modest clothing and um just go all the way in with Jessie modison and that's when I did that I Cann remember how long it took me to do that but yeah that's when I did that um yeah so that's just kind of the summary of like when I first got here and how it was feeling yeah I love that story it's very unique you know how the Holy Spirit deals with each individual I think even my wife's testimony when we first came in the message uh nobody walked right up to Kristen and said get those earrings out uh they didn't order her around now some churches are known for that and some Churches get good results that way I guess we might call that the real aggressive approach uh but when we came in the message we went to a church that was more uh patient I'll call that the patient approach um and so it's just awesome to see you know looking back now that was like three years ago look how far God has brought our sister you know and because it's the work of God it's not the work of a man it's not the work of legalism it's the work of the Holy Spirit pointing us to the word of God and so I think it's awesome to see how God work with sister Lena the same way you know God worked with my wife you know when my wife first came in the message uh we see God dealing with um each person individually and that's the way we've always Tred to do at our church you know God has a time and season for everything God knows our Downs sittings our uprisings uh God determined where we'd be born you know acts 17 tells us that where we'd live and so if God has all that planned out we don't have to force our will or our thinking upon anybody God will do the the work so it's been amazing it's been wonderful it's been Supernatural to see God work here in Sister Lena's life friends we've come to the end of part one of sister Lena's podcast I
