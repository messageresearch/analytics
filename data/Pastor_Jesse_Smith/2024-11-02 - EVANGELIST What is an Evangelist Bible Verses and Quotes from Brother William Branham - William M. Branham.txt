TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] the Evangelist is a special man he's a man that's burning like a fireball he runs into a city and preaches his message and gets out of there somewhere else see he's a special man greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ what is an evangelist a viewer asked me this question recently so I've been making a series on the fivefold ministry by God's grace an evangelist is a bringer of good tidings hi friends I'm Jesse Smith pastor of bride of Christ Fellowship here in akan Ohio USA and I defend the original Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ that he revealed to St Paul then had to restore through Martin Luther John Wesley and the late Prophet William Maran Bram who lived from 1909 to 1965 I also defend brother Ram's Godly Christian character this video is the third video in a series on the fivefold ministry we've already done what is a pastor and what is an apostle in this third video we're looking at what is the evangelist so just as we did for the word Apostle we'll look to the Greek Lexicon for what is an evangelist and it means a bringer of Good Tidings an evangelist It also says those Heralds of Salvation through Christ who are not Apostles let's remember that an apostle is one who is sent to introduce the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ to those that have never heard it to make converts to show Great Signs wonders and miracles and then to set in order churches established with with elders and of course each local church would have a local Elder who is the pastor or also known as the bishop of the church so we must differentiate an evangelist from the other four preaching gifts so the Evangelist is a bringer of Good Tidings so he's not an apostle he's not introducing the Gospel of Jesus Christ to people that have never heard it he's preaching to those who have already heard the Gospel of Jesus Christ and also he's not a pastor a pastor stays in one location and Shepherds flock of Believers so an evangelist travels to other churches outside of his own home church and he's not necessarily a teacher a teacher is an instructor who tells by the scripture how to observe all the commands of the Lord Jesus Christ as we'll look at in a future video by the grace of God and he's not a prophet the Evangelist is not a prophet who speaks with thus sayith the Lord prophesies about future events and interprets the word of God or in other words gives the true meaning of the word of God so we'll use the Bible of course to Define an evangelist further he's one who brings Good Tidings the first time the word evangelist is used in the Bible is acts 21:8 Paul said we entered into the house of Philip the Evangelist which was one of the seven and Abode with him so the first evangelist we see in the scripture is philli and he had four virgin daughters who prophesied in Acts 21:9 and then Ephesians 4:11 list the fivefold ministry Apostles prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers and the final time we see the Evangelist listed in the scripture is 2 Timothy 4:5 Paul tells Timothy in his final letter but watch thou in all things endure afflictions do the work of an evangelist make full proof of thy Ministry now based upon those three verses that use the word evangelist we can look to other scriptures to help us understand more about the Evangelist a very helpful one would be Acts 15:3 six the Bible says in some days after Paul said unto Barnabas let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of God and see how they do this verse shows St Paul and Barnabas doing Evangelistic work they've already done missionary work and established churches and now they're moving into evangelism because they're going to cities and churches that have already heard the word of the Lord and they're going to try to further establish them and strengthen them in the word of God so we see Paul and Barnabas doing both Apostle work and evangelism so this is what differentiates an evangelist from the Apostle the Apostle continually goes to places that don't have churches and tries to establish churches through preaching signs Miracles and wonders and then establishes local churches and sets in order the church with a pastor the pastor stays in one Church most of the time the teacher can of course travel to numerous churches But the teacher will instruct the people to to observe the commands of God and the prophet will speak with thus sayith the Lord let's look at a few quotes from God's Prophet brother brandom about evangelists in 1955 he said there were numerous examples of evangelists who swept back and forth across the nation he named Billy Graham Jack Schuler Jackie Burch and or Roberts and he said many of the Great evangelists that just crossed back and forth through our nation comb back and comb back and forth back and forth so that quote backs up what we saw Paul Barnabas do in Acts 15:36 they would just go back and visit the Believers and strengthen them and bring them good tidings let's listen to the quote you know that just look at the Evangelist who swep Across the Nation look at Billy grim and Jack Schuler and and Jackie burst and all all those others and Oral Roberts and the many of the Great evangelist has just cross back and forth and through the nation and comb back and comb back and forth back and forth back for there's another quote we often hear about the Evangelist it's from 1963 warning then judgment brother am just makes a few sentences about evangelist he calls him a special man that burns like a fireball he runs into a city preaches his message gets out of there and then somewhere else he's a special man so this also helps differentiate the Evangelist he goes to establish churches preaches the word and then leaves let's listen to the quote the abang Jesus is a special man he's a man that's burning like a fireball he runs into a city and preaches his message and gets out of there somewhere else see he's a special man in closing friends hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God we've now looked at three of the gifts of the five full ministry the Evangelist is a great work it's a special work as Paul said do the work of an evangelist it's a lot of work for a man to travel to EST Lish churches bring the Good Tidings and visit time and time again it's a wonderful Ministry I personally know numerous evangelists who come to our church and minister they often stir up the people we often get Supernatural testimonies and answers to prayer through the work of the Evangelist so as a pastor I'm very grateful for the work of the Evangelist and of course I myself have done evangelism work as well sometimes I get invitations to preach of course at established churches and I do the work of an evangelist by the grace of God just in a very small measure and as we'll see in future videos by God's grace I'm working on a video how brother brandom had all five gifts all five preaching gifts and he would just kind of move into each gift as God led him and we see that in the Bible was St Paul by the Holy Spirit St Paul would transition from one gift one preaching gift to the other he started off as an apostle then he would be a pastor in a new church such as at Ephesus brother Ram said he was the pastor there for 3 years he called himself a teacher to the Gentiles we saw him and Barnabas do evangelism in Acts 15:36 and of course he was a prophet when he foretold things in the name of the Lord like the Rapture in 1 Thessalonians 4:15 through1 17 let's have a word of prayer for our evangelist Lord we thank you for the evangelists Lord God out in the field today Lord further anoint them strengthen them to be Bringers of Good Tidings to the Believers Lord God may they be Fireballs to stir the Saints up like a brand plucked out of the fire lord God may they have wonderful testimonies signs Miracles and wonders Lord God stiring up the people give them strength to travel strength to endure the trials the tests of their office they're doing a great work may they cross this nation Lord and other nations back and forth winning souls for the kingdom of God for the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ we thank you for the Evangelist anoint these special men further as Lord you finish the Great Commission and end up the time of the Gentiles we give you glory in Jesus Christ's name amen if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
