[0:02] the first thing comes when he starts
[0:04] descending from the heaven there's a
[0:05] shout what is it is a message to get the
[0:09] people together a message comes forth
[0:11] first now L trimming time rise and trim
[0:13] your
[0:14] lamp greetings friends in the matchless
[0:17] name of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[0:19] purpose of this video is to show four
[0:21] Bible verses that God's Prophet brother
[0:23] William Mar and brandham used to support
[0:26] his teaching that his ministry was the
[0:29] shout of 1 Thessalonians 4:16 the three
[0:33] steps in the Rapture order the shout
[0:34] voice Trump so by the grace of God we'll
[0:36] cover those verses in this video hi
[0:39] friends I'm Jesse Smith pastor bride of
[0:40] Christ Fellowship here in akan Ohio USA
[0:43] and I defend the original Gospel of the
[0:44] Lord Jesus Christ that he revealed to St
[0:47] Paul then had to restore through Martin
[0:48] Luther John Wesley and the late Prophet
[0:50] brother William Marian brandham and also
[0:53] defend brother bram's Godly Christian
[0:54] character this video is sort of a
[0:57] follow-up to last week's video called is
[0:59] revelation 10 1- 7 fulfilled it was
[1:02] released November 23rd
[1:04] 2024 and as you might recall I made that
[1:07] video based upon a request from a saint
[1:10] and that was my humble opinion about
[1:12] Revelation 10 1-7 being fulfilled that's
[1:15] what I believe by the grace of God I'm
[1:17] open to correction though as always and
[1:19] so I thought this would be a good
[1:20] follow-up video to show the four Bible
[1:22] verses that brother RAM used to tell the
[1:24] saints that his ministry was the shout
[1:26] of the shout voice Trump all four of
[1:28] these verses come from the same sermon
[1:30] the Rapture brother BR preached it
[1:32] December 4th
[1:33] 1965 so let's begin with the first quote
[1:36] it's from paragraphs 1030 through 132
[1:39] brother Ram said what is a shout it's
[1:41] the message going forth the living bread
[1:43] of life bringing forth the bride then he
[1:46] said in Amos 3:7 he would do nothing on
[1:49] Earth until he first revealed it to his
[1:51] servants the prophets so the first Bible
[1:53] verse is Amos 3:7 it says surely the
[1:56] Lord God will do nothing but he reveal
[1:58] his secret unto his servants the
[2:00] prophets and we know brother R used this
[2:02] verse many times to describe his
[2:04] ministry and of course the secrets
[2:05] brother random revealed were the
[2:07] revelations of the Seven Seals let's
[2:10] listen to the quote about Amos
[2:12] 3:7 three things happens a voice a shout
[2:16] a voice a
[2:18] trumpet has to happen before Jesus
[2:20] appears now a
[2:23] shout Jesus does all three of them when
[2:27] he's he's he's descending shout what is
[2:30] the shout it's the message amen going
[2:33] forth first the living bread of life
[2:36] bringing forth the bride now God has a
[2:39] way of doing
[2:41] things and he never changes his policy
[2:45] right he never changes his he's an
[2:48] unchanging God and Amos 3:7 he said he
[2:51] would do nothing on the earth until
[2:53] first he revealed it to his servants the
[2:55] prophets and just as certain as he
[2:58] promised it he will do it then in
[3:01] paragraph 132 brother R lists the second
[3:03] scripture Malachi 4 of course he's
[3:05] referring to Malachi 4:5 and6 he said
[3:08] but we're promised in the last days
[3:09] according to Malachi 4 that there should
[3:11] be a return again a prophet in the land
[3:14] Malachi 4:5 and6 says behold I will send
[3:16] you Elijah the prophet before the coming
[3:19] of the great and Dreadful day of the
[3:20] Lord and he shall turn the heart of the
[3:21] fathers to the
[3:22] children that phrase is John the Baptist
[3:25] according to Luke 1:17 he turned the
[3:27] hearts of the fathers to the children
[3:30] and the Heart of the children to their
[3:31] fathers that phrase is the ministry of
[3:34] God's Prophet brother brandom he's
[3:36] turning our hearts back to the apostolic
[3:38] fathers lest I come and smite the Earth
[3:40] with a curse let's listen to the quote
[3:42] from paragraph 132 according to Malachi
[3:44] 4 now we've come through the church ages
[3:47] but we're promised in the last days
[3:49] according to Malachi 4 that there would
[3:52] be a return again a prophet in the land
[3:56] that's right that's right the third
[3:58] verse brother I'm us is in paragraph 142
[4:01] he says a shout what is it it is is a
[4:04] message to get the people together now
[4:07] lamp trimming time rise and trim your
[4:09] lamps so his third verse is Matthew 25:7
[4:13] let's read that it says then all those
[4:16] virgins arose and trim their lamps of
[4:19] course trimming the lamp refers to
[4:21] sanctification and the oil of course is
[4:23] the baptism of the Holy Ghost oil
[4:26] represents the Holy Ghost according to
[4:27] Zechariah 4 now let's listen to the
[4:29] quote about lamp triming time the first
[4:32] thing comes when he starts descending
[4:33] from the heaven there's a shout what is
[4:36] it is a message to get the people
[4:38] together a message comes forth first now
[4:41] lamp trimming time rise and trim your
[4:43] lamps what watch was that the seven amen
[4:46] not the six to seven behold the
[4:48] bridegroom cometh rise and trim your
[4:51] lamps and they did some of them found
[4:53] they didn't even have any or in their L
[4:56] the fourth and final scripture is Luke
[4:58] 17 and we believe brother r referring to
[5:00] Luke 17:30 so let's read Luke
[5:02] 17:30 even thus shall it be in the day
[5:05] when the son of man is revealed brother
[5:07] RAM used this verse to explain that the
[5:10] Lord Jesus Christ was using him as a
[5:13] prophet to give the sign of discernment
[5:16] the Messiah sign the prophetic sign of
[5:19] Discerning the thoughts and intents of
[5:21] the heart just as the Lord Jesus discern
[5:23] the thoughts and intents of the heart in
[5:25] John chapter 1 and John chapter 4 Jesus
[5:28] told the woman at the well
[5:30] The Secret of how many husbands she'd
[5:31] had and then she knew Jesus was the
[5:34] prophet the Messiah the same was true
[5:37] with brother branam brother Bram would
[5:38] reveal the thoughts and intents of and
[5:40] secrets of people's hearts and then they
[5:41] would know he was a prophet sent from
[5:43] God brother Bram of course is just a man
[5:46] a son of man but the Lord Jesus Christ
[5:48] was the son of man the god man brother
[5:51] Ram was just a sinner saved by grace but
[5:52] he had the gift to be a prophet who
[5:55] could discern the thoughts and Tents of
[5:56] the Heart by the power of the Holy Ghost
[5:59] so here's the the quote brother Ram said
[6:01] it's Malachi 4 time what he promised is
[6:04] Luke 17 it's all those prophecy that it
[6:07] can be perfectly set in order for this
[6:09] day in the scripture we see it living
[6:11] right there let's listen to the quote
[6:12] about Luke 17 well it's lamp treaming
[6:15] time it's Malachi 4 time what you it's
[6:18] Luke 17 it's it's eyes all those
[6:20] prophecy that's it can perfectly set in
[6:23] order for this day in the scripture we
[6:24] see it living right there amen so
[6:26] friends those are the four Bible verses
[6:28] brother RAM used for his teaching on the
[6:31] shout that his ministry was the shout
[6:33] going forth to get the people ready for
[6:34] the Rapture so when people ask me what I
[6:37] believe about the shout these are the
[6:38] four Bible verses I would give to
[6:40] support that based upon what brother
[6:42] Bram said by the grace of God one more
[6:44] thing I want to share is that there are
[6:45] two other quotes where brother Ram talks
[6:46] about the shout voice Trump and he gives
[6:48] some other details in 1965 on November
[6:52] 27th I have heard but now I see one week
[6:55] before he preached the Rapture sermon he
[6:57] said there's going to be a clap of
[6:59] Thunder someday and the Son of God shall
[7:02] descend from heaven with a shout and the
[7:04] voice of an archangel and the Trump of
[7:05] God and the dead in Christ shall rise
[7:07] this is an interesting quote because he
[7:08] says a clap of Thunder but brother Ram
[7:10] doesn't give any Bible scripture and so
[7:13] then about a week later brother Ram gave
[7:15] the four Bible verses that we've gone
[7:17] over regarding the shout so it's
[7:19] interesting quote but again no Bible
[7:20] verses and so we're doing our best to
[7:22] understand Bible verses that refer to
[7:25] the shout that explain the shout of the
[7:27] shout voice Trump dear G in this solemn
[7:30] moment it's going to be a time like this
[7:33] when there really will be a clap of
[7:34] Thunder someday and the Son of God shall
[7:37] descend from the heavens with the Shout
[7:39] with the voice of the Archangel and the
[7:41] Trump of God the dead in Christ shall
[7:44] rise and then there's one other
[7:46] scripture brother random uses with the
[7:47] shout voice Trump it's Matthew
[7:50] 24:40 it says then shall two be in the
[7:53] field and the one should be taken and
[7:54] the other left brother R quotes the
[7:56] scripture in 1958 the sudden secret
[7:58] going away the church so a sermon about
[8:00] the Rapture the pre-tribulation Rapture
[8:02] so brother R spoke this about 7 years
[8:04] before he preached the Rapture sermon
[8:05] from 1965 so it's very interesting to
[8:08] see this now personally I believe
[8:09] Matthew 24:40 is for the Trump of God
[8:13] the third and final step of the shout
[8:15] voice Trump but that's just my humble
[8:16] opinion but it's interesting to see how
[8:18] brother Ram uses scripture in connection
[8:20] with the shout voice Trump let's listen
[8:22] to the
[8:23] quote one will be in the field working
[8:26] daytime the other in the bed sleeping on
[8:28] the other side of the world
[8:30] it'll be a universal
[8:32] Rapture and it will come with the Shout
[8:36] with the voice of the Archangel and the
[8:39] Trump of God shall sound in the dead and
[8:41] Christ shall rise and Shall be Called
[8:44] away
[8:46] secretly oh I love
[8:49] that in
[8:51] closing friends hope this video was a
[8:53] blessing by the grace of God again it
[8:54] was on my heart just to show those Bible
[8:56] verses that support why I believe the
[8:58] shout is is brother Ram's Ministry
[9:00] brother RAM used those four verses those
[9:02] are all familiar verses to us to those
[9:04] who follow the ministry of God's Prophet
[9:06] brother brandom so with all of our
[9:08] teaching and all of our beliefs we want
[9:09] to go back to the scripture for it so I
[9:12] thought this video would be helpful to
[9:13] show people the scriptures we would use
[9:15] when teaching about the shout voice
[9:16] Trump if you have any questions concerns
[9:18] or testimonies about this video please
[9:20] contact
[9:21] me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[9:24] the desire of your heart
