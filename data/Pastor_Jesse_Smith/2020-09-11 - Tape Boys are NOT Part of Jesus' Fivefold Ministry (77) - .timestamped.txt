[0:00] [Music]
[0:07] greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:09] of the lord jesus christ
[0:11] the purpose of this video is to define
[0:14] jesus's true five full ministry
[0:17] and show how tape boys who do not preach
[0:20] themselves
[0:21] are not part of the fivefold ministry
[0:24] paul established
[0:26] in ephesians 4 verses 7 to 16
[0:29] through the revelation jesus christ gave
[0:32] him according to galatians 1 verse 12.
[0:35] again i want to thank the lord jesus
[0:38] christ for being my lord and savior
[0:40] and that he baptized me with the holy
[0:42] ghost in june of 2003
[0:44] and i believe god's prophet to the end
[0:46] time was brother william marion branham
[0:49] as many of my videos fully express
[0:52] here's the outline for this video we'll
[0:55] begin by correcting the tape boy false
[0:58] teaching
[0:58] from jeffersonville then we'll look at
[1:02] brother branham quotes about the five
[1:04] full ministry
[1:06] third we'll look at bible truth
[1:08] regarding rahab and the two spies
[1:11] to correct jeffersonville's false
[1:13] teachings
[1:14] and lastly we'll look at bible truth
[1:16] pertaining to revelation chapter 22
[1:19] verse 16. correcting the tape boy
[1:22] false teaching from jeffersonville
[1:24] leadership
[1:26] leadership in jeffersonville erroneously
[1:28] believes
[1:29] and i quote the correct way for the
[1:32] five-fold
[1:34] his joshua's messengers tape boys
[1:38] were what the five full ministry that
[1:41] fivefold ministry went
[1:43] in there being told what to do so that's
[1:46] the fivefold ministry
[1:48] what did the true fivefold ministry
[1:49] preach
[1:51] then they played her rahab a tape
[1:54] that's what the fivefold ministry is
[1:56] supposed to do
[1:57] end quote please observe two false
[2:01] doctrines from this quote
[2:03] first tape boys are the true fivefold
[2:05] ministry
[2:06] or the correct way for the fivefold
[2:08] ministry to operate
[2:10] and second the true fivefold ministry is
[2:13] supposed to play tapes
[2:14] instead of preaching themselves friends
[2:18] jeffersonville is wrong to redefine the
[2:20] fivefold ministry
[2:22] because they are adding and taking away
[2:25] from the word of god
[2:26] the tate church movement adds tape boys
[2:29] men who try to start new churches by
[2:31] playing audio sermons of william branham
[2:34] but they themselves do not preach into
[2:37] the fivefold ministry
[2:39] which takes away or deletes or redefines
[2:43] pastors evangelists teachers apostles
[2:46] and prophets who preach the gospel of
[2:49] jesus christ
[2:51] here's the truth about jeffersonville's
[2:54] two false doctrines
[2:56] first tape boys are not the true
[2:58] fivefold ministry
[3:00] as the bible and brother branham never
[3:03] say those words
[3:04] and second the true fivefold ministry
[3:07] preaches themselves
[3:09] rather than playing tapes
[3:12] beginning with bible facts the fivefold
[3:14] ministry of ephesians 4 verses 7 to 16
[3:18] are preachers apostle prophet evangelist
[3:22] pastor and teacher romans chapter 10
[3:25] verses 14 and 15
[3:27] define a preacher as one who publishes
[3:30] and proclaims something that has been
[3:32] done
[3:33] preachers use their own voice not
[3:36] someone else's
[3:38] also preachers have feet according to
[3:40] romans 10
[3:41] verse 15 how beautiful are the feet of
[3:43] them
[3:44] that preach the gospel of peace and
[3:46] bring glad tidings of good things
[3:50] tape boys fail in these two requirements
[3:53] they do not use their own voice
[3:55] and a tape player or phone or tablet
[3:58] that is preaching through mp3 files
[4:00] does not have feet the bible teaches
[4:03] five full ministers are living preachers
[4:06] for the feet of dead preachers are in
[4:08] the grave and cannot bring good news
[4:12] the bible mandate is for living men to
[4:14] preach god's living word
[4:16] commissioned by jesus christ himself in
[4:19] matthew chapter 28 verses 19 and 20
[4:22] mark 16 verse 15 and ephesians 4 verses
[4:25] 7 to 16.
[4:28] mark 16 15 says and he said unto them go
[4:31] ye into all the world and
[4:32] preach the gospel to every creature
[4:36] in context jesus was not asking dead men
[4:39] to go and preach
[4:40] but living men and jesus christ is the
[4:42] same yesterday
[4:44] today and forever living preachers are
[4:47] anointed with the holy ghost
[4:49] who preach with their own voices and do
[4:52] not sit down
[4:53] and press play notice romans 10 verse 15
[4:56] saying they preach and not him
[5:00] or one person not one man
[5:04] it's a group romans 10 15
[5:07] and how shall they preach except they be
[5:11] sent
[5:12] philip the evangelist is a sound example
[5:15] for he was a living man
[5:17] using his own voice to preach and had
[5:19] one of the five
[5:21] preaching gifts acts 8 5 and acts 21
[5:24] verse 8 say
[5:26] philip preached christ and he was an
[5:29] evangelist
[5:30] jesus anoints the preachers in the true
[5:33] fivefold ministry
[5:34] to do five works as he anoints their
[5:37] voices to preach and declare his good
[5:39] news
[5:40] first for the perfecting of the saints
[5:42] which is equipping
[5:44] second for the work of the ministry
[5:45] which is undertaking of the ministry
[5:48] third for the edifying of the body of
[5:50] christ which is promoting growth
[5:53] fourth the unity of the faith which is
[5:55] agreement of faith or beliefs
[5:58] and fifth unity the knowledge of the son
[6:00] of god
[6:01] which is unity of knowledge or precise
[6:03] truth
[6:05] and this is all done to make a perfect
[6:07] man unto the measure of the stature of
[6:09] the fullness of christ
[6:11] or unto the portion of maturity in jesus
[6:14] christ
[6:15] moving on to brother branham's tape boy
[6:17] quotes he never said tay boys
[6:20] are the true fivefold ministry there are
[6:22] 25
[6:23] tape boys quotes from brother branham
[6:25] and none of them say
[6:27] what jeffersonville leadership is saying
[6:30] according to god's prophet brother
[6:31] branham tay boys during his lifetime
[6:34] ran a tape business or society
[6:37] and were and still are a secondary
[6:40] ministry
[6:41] live preaching is the primary ministry
[6:44] or highest ministry in the gospel of
[6:46] jesus christ
[6:47] to get his message to his people
[6:51] i'm so happy to see these brethren here
[6:53] just a whole line of these recorders and
[6:56] what a work they're doing for the lord
[6:59] these recordings are being sent around
[7:01] the nation
[7:03] and they're going into homes and in the
[7:05] halls and so forth
[7:07] they even got us in a movie picture of
[7:09] the day to introduce these things
[7:11] and hundreds of people are being saved
[7:13] and healed right through these
[7:14] recordings
[7:17] aren't you happy that man's got the
[7:18] message on their heart maybe they're not
[7:20] preachers but
[7:20] they're trying to get the message to the
[7:22] people doctors they tell me and
[7:25] man of of great standing
[7:28] in the world or out trying to win souls
[7:31] for christ
[7:33] god can use these things in a secondary
[7:36] way like this may the lord jesus
[7:38] bless everyone who hears the message
[7:41] may they be saved and healed
[7:45] now i think and i say this
[7:48] from my heart that the greatest and
[7:51] highest form
[7:53] that there is for god to get his message
[7:55] to his people
[7:56] is for the people to believe his word
[7:58] that's right that's the highest form
[8:00] preaching the gospel is the highest form
[8:04] then if you notice the bible places it
[8:07] that way
[8:09] first apostles secondarily
[8:13] prophets and so forth then on down
[8:16] on down then into the nine spiritual
[8:18] gifts operating
[8:19] every local body
[8:22] branham tabernacle had a tape business
[8:24] or tape society
[8:26] which was a ministry of their own church
[8:28] but it never replaced the fivefold
[8:30] ministry
[8:31] as ormond neville pastor of branham
[8:33] tabernacle
[8:34] never played tapes on a regular basis he
[8:37] preached the gospel with his own voice
[8:39] and brother brahm loved his sermons
[8:41] you can listen to many of brother
[8:43] neville's sermons today
[8:46] here is the tape business quote i'm not
[8:48] a tape salesman and i don't
[8:51] stress those things we get them and we
[8:53] gotta take
[8:54] a business around the world
[8:58] here is the tape society quote we
[9:02] send them tapes free on a society of the
[9:05] church
[9:06] and they're translated and all out
[9:08] through the jungles of africa and the
[9:10] indian around the world
[9:12] goes these tapes
[9:15] here's the quote where brother branham
[9:16] love to hear brother neville preach
[9:18] and not push play
[9:22] i tell you the reason i'd love to hear
[9:24] brother neville
[9:25] speak not mainly because he's a good
[9:29] preacher but because i know that he
[9:33] lives what he preaches and i would
[9:36] rather you would live
[9:37] me a sermon than preach me one it'll be
[9:41] more effective
[9:45] let it be known as well that brother
[9:46] branham taught in the church age book
[9:49] the korah group of the last days made up
[9:52] of businessmen
[9:54] and not gifted preachers would say the
[9:57] true fivefold ministry
[9:58] failed and so they would invade the
[10:01] pulpit
[10:02] without a call from god sadly it seems
[10:05] the tape church movement
[10:07] is dangerously close to fulfilling this
[10:09] quote
[10:10] as the core groups if you don't think
[10:13] this is true
[10:14] just listen to this all over the world
[10:16] in both pentecostal and fundamental
[10:18] groups
[10:19] they are organizing the businessmen they
[10:21] have invaded the pulpit without a call
[10:23] from god
[10:24] they have styled themselves the fishers
[10:26] of men and the founders of a move of god
[10:29] and they say the gifted ministry of
[10:31] ephesians 4 10-13
[10:33] but god gave the church has failed so
[10:36] they are taking over
[10:38] here we are right in the midst of the
[10:40] fulfillment of prophecy
[10:41] called the gain sayings of korra and
[10:44] they don't even know that they have
[10:45] fulfilled it
[10:47] they are blindly going on preaching
[10:48] experience for truth
[10:50] may god have pity on them may their eyes
[10:53] be opened before it is too late
[10:56] oh listen to me when did the prestige of
[10:59] money social leadership business ability
[11:01] or sheer mental prowess ever qualify a
[11:04] man for spiritual leadership
[11:06] or give any weight to the word of god
[11:09] and when in any way materiality or human
[11:11] values begin to show as the media by
[11:13] which god works instead of the holy
[11:15] spirit alone
[11:17] then we are fighting against god not for
[11:19] him
[11:23] in summary jeffersonville leadership is
[11:26] changing the fivefold ministry to
[11:28] include tape boys
[11:29] and so in essence jeffersonville is
[11:32] changing
[11:33] paul's revelation from jesus christ and
[11:36] have deviated from the word
[11:38] their worship services no longer match
[11:41] paul's
[11:42] god's prophet told us in the church age
[11:44] book chapter 3
[11:46] that he would be in the word exactly as
[11:48] paul gave it
[11:50] and now the tape church movement is not
[11:52] teaching paul's gospel
[11:54] exactly as he gave it
[11:57] that original word could not change not
[12:00] even a dot or dash of it
[12:02] paul knew it was god who had spoken to
[12:04] him so he said
[12:05] even if i come and try to give a second
[12:07] revelation
[12:08] try to make one little change in what i
[12:10] gave originally let me be accursed
[12:13] you see paul knew that first revelation
[12:15] was correct
[12:17] god can't give a first revelation then a
[12:19] second revelation
[12:21] if he did he would be changing his mind
[12:25] but god's word can't change the seed
[12:28] came
[12:28] exactly as revealed hallelujah
[12:32] and see what those false apostles were
[12:33] doing they came with their own word
[12:36] those ephesians knew that word as paul
[12:39] had taught it
[12:40] they were full of the holy ghost by the
[12:42] laying on of paul's hands
[12:44] they looked those false apostles in the
[12:46] eye and said
[12:47] you are not saying what paul said you
[12:50] are therefore
[12:51] false oh that sets my heart on fire
[12:54] get back to the word it is not you that
[12:57] really tries the apostle and prophet and
[13:00] teacher
[13:00] it is the word that tries them one of
[13:03] these days there is going to come a
[13:05] prophet to the laodicean church age
[13:07] and you will know if he is the real one
[13:09] sent from god or not
[13:11] yes you will for if he is of god he will
[13:14] be in that word exactly as god gave it
[13:17] to paul
[13:18] he won't deviate from that word for a
[13:19] moment not by one iota
[13:25] i would also give a sincere sober
[13:27] warning to the tape church movement
[13:30] that is promoting less preaching by men
[13:32] since it seems they are slowly moving
[13:34] into the wrong spirit
[13:35] that wants to stop holy ghost-filled
[13:38] preachers
[13:39] this is because brother branham says the
[13:41] antichrist system
[13:42] will force the bride to stop preaching
[13:45] and teaching
[13:46] right before the rapture with this great
[13:49] power the church systems
[13:50] will persecute the true bride this image
[13:53] will try to keep the bride from
[13:54] preaching and teaching etc
[13:57] her ministers will be forbidden to give
[13:58] comfort and truth to the people who need
[14:00] it
[14:01] but before the antichrist in person
[14:04] takes over this complete world system of
[14:06] churches
[14:07] the true church will be taken away from
[14:08] this world to be with the lord
[14:11] god will catch away his pride for the
[14:13] great marriage supper of the lamb
[14:17] second let's look at brother branham's
[14:19] quotes about the fivefold ministry
[14:22] knowing the bible is unquestionably
[14:24] supportive of the fivefold ministry
[14:27] i want to show how brother branham fully
[14:28] supported paul's standard
[14:30] of living preachers preaching live
[14:34] playing brother rams tapes never was and
[14:37] never is to replace
[14:38] god called living preachers
[14:41] if you watch my previous videos about
[14:44] jeffersonville related subjects
[14:46] you already know brother branham
[14:47] faithfully supported the fivefold
[14:49] ministry
[14:50] saying plainly no he's not the only one
[14:54] that should preach
[14:54] in questions and answers part three from
[14:58] 1964.
[15:00] also brother adam said we need them
[15:02] referring to the preachers with a call
[15:04] of god to preach the gospel
[15:06] in that same sermon now brother branham
[15:10] is it true that no one should preach
[15:14] but you we have seen
[15:18] your we have seen you
[15:21] ordained man we do don't believe
[15:25] you would do that if there were not
[15:28] that they were not to preach mercy
[15:32] brother sister ever who told you nobody
[15:34] has preached for me i
[15:35] surely have four subjects of gods with
[15:38] all that no
[15:39] every man or that feels a call of god
[15:42] upon his life
[15:44] get into the ministry start preaching we
[15:46] need him
[15:49] and he said don't change a thing in
[15:52] reference to evangelists continuing
[15:54] preaching on the field
[15:56] from questions and answers on the seals
[15:58] in 1963
[16:00] should evangelists continue on the field
[16:05] in this hour of course what they mean
[16:07] certainly
[16:08] by all means don't change the thing
[16:11] if jesus is coming in the morning preach
[16:13] today like if it will be 10 years some
[16:15] day but live
[16:16] life's going to be at this hour don't
[16:19] don't get scrupled up now that's what
[16:21] i'm trying to warn you about see
[16:24] just don't be odd peculiar don't change
[16:26] the other but if you're doing something
[16:27] wrong
[16:28] or doing evil repent come back to god
[16:32] continue on your evangelistic service
[16:34] just as you always did
[16:37] the jeffersonville movement is not
[16:39] obeying these quotes
[16:40] listen again as brother branham tells us
[16:43] the most important thing we need today
[16:45] is a preacher who can rightly divide the
[16:47] word of truth now
[16:50] to bring up this faith in christ there's
[16:52] ministers
[16:54] that's the most important thing of the
[16:56] day
[16:57] is a good god-sent preacher
[17:00] i admire them and their gift is far
[17:04] beyond anything can be done in anything
[17:06] else is a preacher
[17:08] a man who knows how to rightly divide
[17:09] the word of god
[17:12] the most wonderful gift in the world is
[17:14] to be a minister
[17:18] sadly tape boys only point to tapes
[17:21] and do not rightly divide anything
[17:24] because they are likely anointed with a
[17:26] deity spirit
[17:27] that worships brother branham and exalts
[17:29] his every word to thus saith the lord
[17:32] tape boys cannot tell you which words
[17:35] from brother branham were inspired or
[17:37] not
[17:38] they can't tell you if the white horse
[17:40] rider is the holy spirit
[17:42] which brother branham said in 1960 or
[17:44] the antichrist spirit
[17:46] which brother branham said in the first
[17:47] seal they can't tell you if billy paul
[17:50] is the promised joseph as brother
[17:52] branham said in 1951
[17:55] or if joseph is the promised joseph as
[17:57] brother random said in 1963
[18:00] they cannot tell you if total
[18:01] annihilation took place to the united
[18:03] states
[18:04] before 1977 or not just to give a few
[18:07] simple examples
[18:09] so tape boys can't rightly divide the
[18:11] human side of brother branham
[18:13] from the inspired side like brother
[18:15] branham taught us to do
[18:16] and he cares do you care 1963
[18:20] did you prophesy that there be a million
[18:23] negroes uh killed
[18:26] on the or did you just announce
[18:30] that there would be this happening
[18:33] now see
[18:36] i've always asked you to be careful what
[18:39] you're
[18:40] listening to something there's so much
[18:42] of it that
[18:43] it's just the human side but always
[18:46] if there is something that goes forth it
[18:49] will speak it it's
[18:51] thus saith the law even to visions or
[18:54] anything
[18:57] but the holy ghost in the soul of a true
[19:00] god-sent preacher
[19:01] as brother branham calls it can tell you
[19:03] the truth about the differences between
[19:05] the human side
[19:06] and the inspired side yes friends
[19:10] the tapes need rightly divided because
[19:12] brother branham also said there are
[19:13] mix-ups on the tapes
[19:15] in questions and answers part 1 1964
[19:19] and he said he makes those kinds of
[19:21] mistakes all the time
[19:23] like when he said 700 that did not bow
[19:25] the need to bail
[19:27] rather than seven thousand now yes
[19:30] i meant forgive me please i and and
[19:32] brother you on the tape out there and
[19:34] friends listen
[19:35] i didn't mean to say that like that i i
[19:37] i'll administer the gospel i've many
[19:39] times
[19:39] i'll preach that i know that was seven
[19:42] thousand i just have to say
[19:43] seven hundred i didn't mean the seven
[19:45] hundred i mean
[19:47] you i just didn't read it out of
[19:48] scripture it just come to my mind while
[19:50] i was talking
[19:50] and i just said 700 instead of 7 000. i
[19:53] make them mistakes all the time
[19:57] and yet at the same time the tapes
[19:59] contain inspiration from the holy ghost
[20:02] and point us back to the absolute the
[20:04] bible and jesus christ
[20:06] here's a small sample of brother branham
[20:08] supporting the fivefold ministry
[20:11] the fightful ministry is to be in the
[20:13] church until jesus comes again
[20:15] so tape boys are not going to replace
[20:17] living preachers
[20:19] it's the same lord but he said some in
[20:22] the church
[20:23] teachers apostles prophets
[20:26] gifts of healing working of miracles and
[20:29] all those things are set in the church
[20:32] you believe that i never didn't stay for
[20:34] the be set out of the church
[20:36] he set him in the church or the
[20:38] perfecting
[20:39] of the church and to be in the church
[20:42] until he comes again
[20:47] the five full ministry perfects the
[20:49] church according to ephesians 4 verse
[20:51] 12.
[20:52] the fifo ministry is god's presence or
[20:55] god's dress where
[20:56] god's spirit working through man
[20:59] remember
[21:00] that's god brother branham said
[21:03] how god fortified his army what with
[21:05] himself
[21:07] in the form of prophets apostles
[21:10] teachers
[21:10] pastors what do you do what was god
[21:13] doing
[21:14] listen did you ever think what that
[21:16] offices of the church is

[21:22] inside dress an apostle
[21:25] a prophet a seer foresee before satan
[21:29] ever gets to it
[21:31] amen what is it god
[21:34] dressed up in his church these
[21:37] offices is god's stresswear when you see
[21:41] those officers pastors teachers advances

[21:55] office denies any
[21:59] [Applause]
[22:02] [Music]
[22:05] [Applause]
[22:15] recall brother branham's vision for the
[22:17] future from taking sides with jesus
[22:19] from june 1962 brother branham was
[22:22] grateful for living preachers
[22:24] and told them that they had to take his
[22:26] place and brother neville's place
[22:28] after they died young preachers got to
[22:32] fill our shoes brother branham said
[22:34] not you might want to fill our shoes or
[22:36] might just want to press
[22:37] play on the tapes brother branham never
[22:40] said you got to play the tapes
[22:42] like the jeffersonville leadership
[22:44] falsely claims today
[22:46] listen as these quotes go along with the
[22:48] quotes we referenced earlier
[22:49] about don't change a thing and we need
[22:52] more preachers
[22:54] and i'm very grateful that in these days
[22:57] i see it's got
[22:58] little satellites to it that i am
[23:01] grateful for
[23:02] brother uh crazier and his
[23:05] sellersburg group and brother back there
[23:08] that just
[23:08] taken brother snelling's place at utica
[23:11] and brother ruttle up here and
[23:13] brother junior jackson and those
[23:16] precious boys who are a fine man
[23:18] wonderful man of god they preached this

[23:52] evangelism and set you somewhere

[24:04] three young men in four or five

[24:08] like that
[24:10] you're a young man i'm getting old
[24:12] brother neville's getting old
[24:13] we're a middle-aged man if time rolls on
[24:16] we're gonna

[24:40] you get together
[24:41] you bunch of men and have meetings and
[24:43] talk on deep things in the scripture
[24:47] and after listening to this next quote
[24:49] friends remember that ormond neville was
[24:51] there
[24:52] to keep preaching and take brother
[24:53] branham's place after he went off the
[24:57] scene
[24:59] one of my days is finished and i've done
[25:01] my best
[25:02] if i be god's servant god will raise him
[25:04] up another man in that day when i'm gone
[25:07] so there's nobody setting something
[25:08] around my theology is me to live and
[25:10] what white i have
[25:11] and wait on god for the next generation
[25:14] to come he'll have a man there when that
[25:15] generation comes up
[25:16] [Music]
[25:17] amen
[25:20] while nearly every quote from brother
[25:22] branham says perfection comes through
[25:24] the five full ministry
[25:25] one quote from questions and answers
[25:27] part 3 1964
[25:29] seems to say it doesn't but when you
[25:32] examine this quote you can see how it
[25:33] does tales
[25:34] with many quotes in which brother
[25:36] branham says perfection comes through
[25:38] the fivefold ministry
[25:40] the quote in question comes from
[25:41] questions and answers part 3
[25:43] 1964. it's question number 355.
[25:48] brother branham was asked this dearly
[25:50] beloved about the scripture of ephesians
[25:52] 4
[25:53] verses 11 through 13 do we all
[25:56] get the perfection of saints through the
[25:58] tapes or should we be here
[26:00] where the gifts of the spirit are
[26:02] operating and the different offices
[26:04] of the church to help perfect us our
[26:07] hearts have believed
[26:08] all the word of god now before i read
[26:10] the answer to this question
[26:12] a week earlier so seven days earlier
[26:15] brother branham said
[26:16] in questions and answers part 2 1964
[26:19] that god set in the church before the
[26:21] perfecting of the saints
[26:23] the fivefold ministry and you can't
[26:25] divide it
[26:27] but the bride is the elected of god
[26:30] there is five offices elected of god
[26:34] for god has set in the church
[26:37] apostles prophets teachers pastors of
[26:39] angels
[26:40] god did that man has deacons and so
[26:43] forth and everything else
[26:45] but you see but god said in the church
[26:47] for the perfecting of the church
[26:54] so now let's listen to brother branham's
[26:55] answer to this question
[26:58] dearly love
[27:02] let's see about the scripture of
[27:04] ephesians 4 11
[27:06] through 13 do we all
[27:09] see do we get all the perfecting
[27:13] of saints through the tapes or should we
[27:17] be here were the gifts of the spirit
[27:21] are operating and the different offices
[27:24] of the church to help perfect us
[27:27] our hearts have believed all
[27:30] the word of the lord now this person is
[27:33] from oregon
[27:36] now i know this person by letter by
[27:39] and so no they want to come here to the
[27:42] church
[27:43] for the perfecting see that we
[27:46] we get fellowship one with another here
[27:48] at the church
[27:49] but the perfecting comes between us and
[27:51] god the blood of christ
[27:53] is what perfects us in the holy spirit
[27:55] now in the church there's has the gifts
[27:57] operating so we are we have some of the
[28:01] gifts
[28:02] operating among us and we'll be very
[28:04] glad to fellowship with any of you
[28:05] that has a way that you're working or
[28:08] wants to come and fellowship with us
[28:09] anything we can do we're very happy
[28:11] about it see but now the perfecting
[28:13] belongs to christ
[28:16] notice he said no they want to come here
[28:19] to the church
[28:20] for the perfecting so it's plain to see
[28:22] from this quote
[28:23] this man from oregon thought he'd only
[28:26] get perfected
[28:27] by going to the branham tabernacle in
[28:29] jeffersonville
[28:30] as brother branham says they want to
[28:32] come here to the church for perfecting
[28:35] but brother branham says the blood of
[28:36] christ is what perfects us
[28:38] in the holy spirit and he says but now
[28:41] the perfecting belongs to christ
[28:44] so it's clear this man thought going to
[28:46] a certain church would bring perfection
[28:49] but brother branham makes it plain
[28:50] there's not a church that can perfect
[28:52] you
[28:52] it's jesus christ who can perfect you
[28:55] recall also how
[28:57] brother branham's last sermon he
[28:58] preached in jeffersonville
[29:00] at his home church was satan's eden from
[29:03] august 29
[29:04] 1965 preached on the evening
[29:07] after he sat down and listened to
[29:09] brother ormond neville preach
[29:11] and brother branham said he was led of
[29:13] the lord to sit down and listen to
[29:15] another preacher
[29:16] in the five-fold ministry notice brother
[29:19] branham did not tell them to just press
[29:21] play this morning i wanted to hear
[29:23] brother neville myself and i heard him
[29:26] many times and never heard him anytime
[29:27] but what i appreciate him
[29:29] but this morning a timely message i know
[29:31] i had the leading of the lord to listen
[29:33] to that this morning
[29:34] very fine and i see why you people like
[29:37] to come and listen to him
[29:39] also and he'll always do you good i'm
[29:42] sure to listen to him
[29:45] i hope you can see from all these quotes
[29:46] that brother branham believed the
[29:48] perfection
[29:49] came through the blood of christ working
[29:51] through the fivefold ministry
[29:53] and brother branham never had tape
[29:54] playing substitute the fivefold
[29:56] ministries
[29:57] live preaching third bible truth
[30:01] regarding rahab and the two spies
[30:04] jeffersonville's false doctrine about
[30:06] tape boys originates from their
[30:08] misinterpretation of a quote from
[30:09] brother branham in the token
[30:11] first preached in september of 1963.
[30:15] listen to this quote they misinterpret
[30:17] and let's examine their errors
[30:20] the word joshua means jehovah's savior
[30:23] so to jesus
[30:24] he's the savior and joshua
[30:27] when he knowed his messengers his
[30:29] mistress turned back said
[30:31] i have obeyed your orders and there was
[30:33] a woman we found
[30:34] when we played the peaceful we found a
[30:37] woman that believed and we told her that
[30:39] all that would come
[30:40] under that red sign back there the
[30:42] tolkien it would mean
[30:44] i preached that would you honor joshua i
[30:46] sent you to do it
[30:48] amen and then when that god honored it
[30:51] the house never shut down
[30:55] so here's the truth about this quote
[30:58] first brother bran was giving a
[30:59] hypothetical type
[31:01] of the messengers brother branham was
[31:03] not teaching doctrine in this quote
[31:05] as evidenced by his later quote from
[31:07] february of 1964
[31:09] when he said some of them tape boys or
[31:12] somebody
[31:13] slipped into the place down there and
[31:15] played some tapes to them
[31:17] or something or another and found the
[31:19] predestinated
[31:21] there must have been some of them hate
[31:23] boys or somebody slipped into the
[31:24] police down there and played some tapes
[31:26] to them or something other than found
[31:27] their predestinated
[31:29] she took all of her house and used it
[31:30] for a church and received the messengers
[31:35] so this type of tape boys as the two
[31:37] spies was never spoken with thus saith
[31:39] the lord
[31:41] second in the three sermons titled the
[31:43] token from september 63 november 63
[31:46] and february 64 brother branham never
[31:49] mentioned the words
[31:51] fivefold ministry this shows brother
[31:53] branham was not preaching a new doctrine
[31:55] about elevating tape boys
[31:57] into the fivefold ministry by just
[31:59] giving a modern
[32:00] hypothetical situation as to who the
[32:03] spies
[32:04] as a secondary ministry might represent
[32:07] today
[32:08] they were not priests apparently like
[32:10] the true preachers and teachers of their
[32:13] day
[32:14] the word tape is used nine times in
[32:16] these three sermons
[32:17] yet brother branham never said tape boys
[32:19] were the true fivefold ministry
[32:21] as jeffersonville claims so they are not
[32:24] saying what brother branham said
[32:27] third the true ministry of rahab's day
[32:29] was the aaronic priesthood
[32:31] as priests were teachers of the word
[32:33] according to deuteronomy 33 verses 8
[32:36] through 10
[32:37] second chronicles 15 3 and malachi 2
[32:40] verse 7
[32:41] in the literal story of rahab the two
[32:43] spies did not replace
[32:45] the aeronautic ministry as
[32:47] jeffersonville wants tape boys to
[32:48] replace
[32:49] live preachers but the true ministry of
[32:52] that day
[32:53] would have pointed rahab to aaron's
[32:55] ministry after they were saved out of
[32:57] the city
[32:59] this is true because rahab as a gentile
[33:02] would have had to be sprinkled with the
[33:04] waters of separation
[33:05] to even begin to enter into worship at
[33:08] the tabernacle of moses
[33:10] according to numbers chapter 19 verse
[33:12] 10.
[33:13] this shows jeffersonville is breaking
[33:16] the true type of scripture
[33:18] which is old testament priesthood
[33:20] represent the new testament priesthood
[33:22] according to first corinthians 9 verses
[33:25] 1 to 14
[33:26] moses represented christ for moses stood
[33:30] in the gap
[33:31] and aaron represented the fivefold
[33:32] ministry for he had four sons plus
[33:35] himself
[33:36] to make five ministers in the ministry
[33:40] fourth in another quote brother branham
[33:41] types the two spies to one person
[33:44] the holy ghost and then in another quote
[33:47] brother branham types the two spies to
[33:49] the pastor
[33:50] let's listen to these two quotes now
[33:52] he's the same yesterday today and
[33:54] forever
[33:55] open up your house and let the messenger
[33:56] of the holy ghost come in
[33:58] and identify you by his own presence the
[34:00] token lord
[34:01] that's upon you just ask
[34:09] [Music]
[34:19] and remember this means you cannot say
[34:22] the two spies
[34:23] only represent tape boys since brother
[34:25] branham typed them as one person
[34:27] a holy divine person the holy spirit and
[34:30] a regular person anointed with the holy
[34:32] spirit
[34:33] a pastor fourth bible truth regarding
[34:37] revelation 22
[34:38] 16. leadership in jeffersonville falsely
[34:42] interprets
[34:43] revelation 22 16 which says
[34:46] i jesus have sent might angel to testify
[34:48] unto you these things
[34:50] in the churches i am the root and the
[34:52] offspring of david
[34:54] and the bright and morning star friends
[34:57] jeffersonville is interpreting this
[34:59] scripture as saying
[35:00] jesus sent his angel which is brother
[35:04] branham's tapes
[35:06] to testify unto you these things in the
[35:09] local churches they believe this
[35:12] scripture means
[35:13] jesus sent brother branham's tapes to be
[35:16] played
[35:16] in local churches and for fivefold
[35:19] ministry preachers
[35:21] to sit down and not preach and just
[35:24] press
[35:24] play which we know is an error
[35:28] because jesus jesus's fivefold ministry
[35:30] cannot change
[35:34] jeffersonville falsely teaches and i
[35:36] quote
[35:37] many critics without revelation say
[35:40] brother branham never said play tapes in
[35:42] church
[35:43] that's called ears but can't hear others
[35:46] say
[35:47] we just believe the bible and it don't
[35:49] say it in the bible neither
[35:51] jesus himself said play tapes in your
[35:54] local churches
[35:55] end quote this misinterpretation
[35:59] is complete and utter false doctrine
[36:02] the facts are 1. brother branham never
[36:06] said to play tapes in every church
[36:08] rather than have living god called
[36:10] pastors preach the gospel
[36:12] and two the bible only supports the
[36:15] fivefold ministry
[36:16] of living holy ghost anointed preachers
[36:19] and ministers with their own voices in
[36:22] churches
[36:23] just as brother branham always taught as
[36:25] the church age book
[36:26] validates he never told them to go into
[36:30] all the world and establish bible
[36:32] colleges
[36:33] nor did he tell them to pass out
[36:35] literature now these things are fine but
[36:37] what jesus told them to do was to preach
[36:40] the gospel
[36:41] stick with the word and then the signs
[36:44] would follow
[36:45] the very first introduction we have in
[36:47] the way the kingdom of god was to be
[36:49] preached
[36:49] was when he sent out the twelve in
[36:52] matthew 10
[36:53] 1-8 he commissioned and instructed them
[36:56] on this wise
[37:00] this ministry that he gave them was
[37:02] actually the sharing of his own ministry
[37:04] with them
[37:05] for it says in matthew 9 35-38
[37:11] sadly as proof of their false teaching
[37:13] jeffersonville leadership cites a
[37:15] footnote in the scofield bible
[37:17] to fit their man-made creed here's a
[37:20] picture of that footnote
[37:31] friends this interpretation is not
[37:33] correct the word
[37:34] church is in revelation 22 16 has
[37:37] five greek definitions but cannot be
[37:40] limited
[37:41] to just the local church today the
[37:44] church age book and brother branham
[37:45] sermons
[37:46] both teach john's letters to the
[37:48] churches were prophetic to future church
[37:51] ages or time periods
[37:53] plus immediately applicable to the seven
[37:56] gentile churches in asia minor
[37:58] around 95 a.d when john received the
[38:01] visions on the isle of atmos
[38:04] jeffersonville is essentially saying
[38:07] jesus has changed the fivefold ministry
[38:09] to tape playing sadly the tape church
[38:12] movement
[38:13] must have missed the keystone revelation
[38:16] brother branham teaches in the church
[38:17] age book
[38:18] from hebrews 13 8 malachi 3 verse 6
[38:22] and galatians 1 verses 6 through 12.
[38:25] god and his ways do not change
[38:28] jeffersonville leadership cannot change
[38:30] the fivefold ministry that jesus christ
[38:32] started
[38:33] and it will continue until the bride is
[38:35] raptured off the earth
[38:37] in closing friends it's an honor to
[38:40] earnestly contend for the faith
[38:42] which was once delivered to the saints
[38:44] and continued by brother branham
[38:46] in our day i want to close with a few
[38:48] quotes
[38:49] the first quote says if the word is in
[38:51] you you don't
[38:52] change it or deny it how can the holy
[38:56] spirit that
[38:57] wrote the word be in you denying the
[39:00] word
[39:02] how can it deny when the very holy
[39:04] spirit itself
[39:06] said if any person shall add one word to
[39:08] this or take anything from it
[39:10] i'll take his part out of the book of
[39:12] life how can the holy spirit then take
[39:15] anything from the word
[39:17] or add anything to the word
[39:21] friends how can a born-again person
[39:23] change the scripture
[39:25] about the fivefold ministry in ephesians
[39:27] 4. the fact is a born-again christian
[39:29] cannot change it and will not change it
[39:32] friends we know we're part of the bride
[39:34] if we're saying the same thing the
[39:36] prophet said
[39:37] and the same thing the scripture says
[39:40] let's finish with this beautiful quote
[39:41] from the church age book
[39:43] chapter 9 that says the spirit the
[39:45] prophet and the bride
[39:47] will all say what is in the unchanging
[39:49] word
[39:50] the living preaching fivefold ministry
[39:53] will continue
[39:54] until the rapture yes listen to the
[39:57] authenticated prophet of god who appears
[39:59] in this last
[40:00] age what he says from god the bride will
[40:03] say
[40:04] the spirit and the prophet and the bride
[40:06] will be saying the same thing
[40:08] and what they will say will have already
[40:10] been said in the word
[40:12] they are saying it now come out from
[40:14] among her now and be
[40:16] separate the cry has gone out the cry is
[40:19] going out
[40:21] how long will the voice cry we do not
[40:24] know but one thing we do know
[40:25] it won't be long for this is the last
[40:28] age
[40:31] but this message that i'm preaching
[40:35] uh is the true message
[40:39] of this day and it's the last message
[40:43] you see what i'm doing brother i'm
[40:44] putting you all the same place i
[40:46] am because you're just as much into it
[40:49] as i am
[40:51] you are messengers of this same message
[40:56] which side are you on the side that
[40:58] stays with brother branham's quotes
[41:00] about the fightful ministry and believes
[41:03] in lie preaching
[41:04] or the side that is adding to brother
[41:06] branham's quotes and deleting brother
[41:08] brown's quotes
[41:09] and yet the most dangerous thing is
[41:11] adding deleting or redefining the
[41:13] scripture
[41:15] if you have any questions concerns or
[41:17] testimonies about this video
[41:19] please contact me
[41:22] god bless you and may jesus christ be
[41:25] the desire
[41:26] of your heart
