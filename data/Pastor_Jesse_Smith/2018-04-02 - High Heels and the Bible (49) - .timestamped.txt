[0:06] greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:08] of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of
[0:12] this video is to teach what the Bible
[0:13] says about high heels with all reverence
[0:16] and humility I believe the Bible is
[0:19] against the wearing of high heels there
[0:21] are three reasons why the Bible's
[0:23] against the wearing of high heels first
[0:25] a high heel like shoe is alluded to in
[0:28] Isaiah chapter 3 verse 16 second high
[0:34] heels damage the human body which is the
[0:36] temple of the Holy Ghost third high
[0:39] heels present the female body in a
[0:41] seductive sexual manner reason number
[0:45] one scripture alludes to the haughty
[0:48] prideful and seductive daughters of Zion
[0:50] wearing high-heeled like shoes in Isaiah
[0:53] 3 verse 16 moreover the Lord sayeth
[0:57] because the daughters of Zion are
[0:59] haughty
[1:00] and walk with stretch forth necks and
[1:02] wanton eyes walking and mincing as they
[1:05] go and making a tinkling with their feet
[1:08] these judgement bound prideful women
[1:11] were mincing when they walked and the
[1:14] tinkling sound was heard the word
[1:17] mincing means taking short steps and
[1:19] high heels naturally limit the length of
[1:22] each step making sounds with the feet is
[1:25] the definition of tinkling note that
[1:28] their necks were also stretched out
[1:30] which would be a result of wearing these
[1:32] unnatural and ungodly feet we're based
[1:36] upon the evidence in the Isaiah text
[1:38] there is a strong case that the haughty
[1:40] daughters of Zion were wearing some type
[1:42] of high-heeled shoe recall that there is
[1:45] nothing new Under the Sun according to
[1:47] Ecclesiastes chapter 1 verse 9
[1:50] high heels cannot be a new design that
[1:53] the world has never seen before
[1:54] but rather a revival of an older
[1:57] rebellious and seductive act high heels
[2:01] cannot be considered an area of
[2:02] Christian Liberty either for we will see
[2:04] shortly that there are scientific
[2:06] evidence that women in high heels cause
[2:09] men to become more sexually attracted to
[2:11] them meaning that high heels promote
[2:13] lustful thoughts any act that causes
[2:16] another person to stumble into sin is
[2:18] then a
[2:19] for act and cannot be considered a
[2:22] Christian liberty holy scripture never
[2:24] supports men or women wearing
[2:26] high-heeled shoes since there is an
[2:28] absence of God requesting believers to
[2:30] wear high heels
[2:31] we should refrain from wearing them
[2:33] reason number two high heels damaged the
[2:36] human body or the temple of the Holy
[2:38] Ghost there is scientific evidence that
[2:41] supports the damaging physical effects
[2:43] that wearing high heels has upon people
[2:46] a research article from 2014 stated that
[2:49] high heels put excessive stress upon the
[2:51] foot bones and ultimately lead to damage
[2:54] to the musculoskeletal system
[2:59] Christian should be alarmed at any
[3:02] activity that damages their bodies or
[3:04] temples of the Holy Ghost recall that
[3:07] Christians do not belong to themselves
[3:08] but are the purchased property of Jesus
[3:12] Christ and therefore should not
[3:13] purposely prop up their bodies in a way
[3:16] that will lead to musculoskeletal damage
[3:18] later on in life
[3:19] 1st Corinthians 6 verse 19 and 20 what
[3:23] know ye not that your body is the temple
[3:25] the Holy Ghost which is in you which you
[3:27] have of God and ye are not your own for
[3:30] ye are bought with the price therefore
[3:32] glorify God in your body and in your
[3:35] spirit which are gods reason number 3
[3:39] high-heels present the female body in a
[3:42] seductive sexual manner
[3:43] a recent 2017 study suggested that men
[3:47] are more attracted to women in high
[3:49] heels
[3:50] due to the lumbar curvature that high
[3:52] heels produce while preparing this video
[3:55] about high heels I spoke with a licensed
[3:58] podiatrist about the effects of high
[4:00] heels this doctor stated that high heels
[4:03] are the absolute worst shoe a human
[4:05] being could wear due to the damaging
[4:08] effects they have upon a person's entire
[4:10] body he also noted that during his
[4:13] training he had multiple textbooks state
[4:16] the fact that high heels never help the
[4:18] human body they only damage it wearing
[4:22] high heels then cannot be considered
[4:23] modest because it draws sexual attention
[4:25] to the wearer recall that all Christians
[4:28] are called to dress in modest apparel
[4:30] which is apparel that does not draw
[4:33] attention to themselves
[4:34] 1st Timothy 2:9 in like manner also that
[4:37] women adorn themselves in modest apparel
[4:39] with shamefacedness and sobriety not
[4:42] with broided hair or gold or pearls or
[4:45] costly array furthermore high heels lead
[4:48] others to Harbor lustful thoughts of
[4:50] fornication or adultery that sinners
[4:53] will have to answer for on the day of
[4:55] judgement according to our Lord Jesus
[4:57] Christ in Matthew 5 verses 27 and 28
[5:01] jesus said you have heard that it was
[5:03] said by them of old time thou shalt not
[5:05] commit adultery but I say unto you that
[5:08] whosoever looketh on a woman to lust
[5:10] after her hath committed adultery with
[5:12] her
[5:13] already in his heart in conclusion we
[5:18] pray that you will take heed to God's
[5:20] Word and abstain from wearing high heels
[5:22] for the biblically based reasons
[5:24] presented on this video if you would
[5:27] like more information about the history
[5:28] of high heels and the scriptures we
[5:30] reference in this video please contact
[5:32] us
[5:35] god bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[5:37] the desire of your heart
