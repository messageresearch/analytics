TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] if Billy only submit his way to God and believe in God the ministry of M would just be a little bitty thing I know what's in the boy greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to show a quote I found recently from God's Prophet brother brandham and he was referring to his son Billy Paul branam and brother brandham said that Billy Paul's gift would be greater than his gift if he could just surrender to the Lord Brother Bram said his own Ministry would be a little bitty thing compared to Billy Paul's Ministry so I'm making this video in brotherly love it's a correction video in hopes to correct some people who are in the tape worship movement the Press Play and Obey idolatrous false movement that currently deceives those that follow the current brandom Tabernacle as they worship every word on William brand tapes and of course this is a video about speaking the truth in love according to Ephesians 4:15 the truth is not always easy to speak but when it's spoken it must be spoken in love so that's what I'm doing today I'm speaking this truth in love with brotherly kindness showing again how my precious Brethren if they are saved in the tape Church press play and Obey false movement that they are deceived and they need to come out of their deception by the grace of God of course of course we're going to prove all things through the quotes and the scriptures by the grace of almighty God so the origin of this video is a couple days ago I was studying and I was reading in brother Ram's Africa trip report from 1953 and he was telling how he took the wrong itinerary and he was going to suffer for it you're probably very familiar with that if you follow the ministry of God's Prophet brother William brandham and the angel Lord told Brother Bram to wake up Billy Paul and brother Ram said the angel had respect to Billy if billy'd only submit his way to God and believe in God the ministry of mine would be just a little bitty thing and when I read that I was caught off guard I'd forgotten this if I'd read it before and brother Ram said I know what's in the boy so brother Ram thought there was a great gift in Billy Paul and then brother Ram tells a quick story that he thinks Billy Paul saw a vision brother Ram said that gift is laying so close to him if he just move over into it it would be wonderful and brother ramam said he's praying that God would settle Billy Paul down someday and put him on a platform that'll give him a Ministry that'll just bring millions of souls to Christ I do now with the understanding we have now here in 2025 of course Billy Paul never had a preaching Ministry he never had any Ministry that even came close to his father's Ministry the late Prophet brother William Mary and Bram so as a follower of the bible-based teachings of God's Prophet brother William brandham and as a believer that brother Bram was a true prophet of God I believe this was just brother bram's human love for his son his fatherly love thought Billy Paul had a gift thought that perhaps he had a vision or prophecy but a tree is known by its fruit and throughout the entire lifetime of Billy Paul his ministry was a testimony Ministry a Ministry that promoted listening to the tapes of his father which is good in one way but if you worship those tapes that's awful that's heresy and that's what Billy Paul and his brother Joseph are into they say every word on the tapes is thus sayith the Lord I've got numerous videos on that so I'll leave links to that in the description if you want to watch that they openly declare that that every word is infallible the tapes are infallible the tapes have no mistakes that's idolatry he say that you have to realize that brother every Brother Joseph believes everything that brother brandom says is thus sayth the Lord amen amen I believe everything say say the Lord now there is one other possibility there is a possibility that Billy Paul did in fact see a vision there in South Africa and I think the trip was in 1951 if I'm not mistaken and early into 1952 I could be wrong on that but that would mean that one of the nine gifts of the holy spirit off operated maybe once or twice in Billy Paul's life and then never again as far as we know it's a gift that's in the body working around to all of you Milling through the body nine spiritual gifts this is might prophesy tonight that's where we get trouble one might prophesy and tell the truth that doesn't make you a prophet it might never come to you again a prophet is a Vindicated person from birth coming down with the word of the Lord so it's a listen to this quote from Africa trip report 1953 said you can go and if you want to go all right but remember you're going to pay for he said tomorrow morning go wake up your boy he had respects to Billy if Billy had only submit his way to God and believing God the ministry of mine would just be a little anything I know what's in the boy but he's just an adolescent age and you just this you don't know where he's standing I know that boy sat here the other night and he said Daddy I was going down the road and something you just tell him say he'll say daddy you know we never been on this road before said right along another place is go to be a barn setting in a certain place and a certain what sure be just exactly that way see and that gift is laying so close to him if he just move over into it it would be wonderful but he just that Frolic age you know and Adolescent and you know what I mean and so I pray that God will settle him down someday and put him on a platform that'll give a Ministry that'll just bring millions of souls to Christ I do you pray for him too and so he's got a lot of front but I know what Billy is in the back so then now that we've heard that remember 6 years later in 1959 brother brandom said that it seems Billy Paul didn't have a calling to be a preacher but yet six years before that brother R thought Billy Paul had a calling to be a prophet and be a greater Prophet than even brother brandom this is from let usy God November 29th 1959 he said Billy's been my Chum but it seems he doesn't have a call to be a preacher he's bashful backward and so forth a lot like his mother shy as the saying goes hindsight is 2020 so I think it's obvious to see that brother Bram had high hopes for his son Billy Paul that he'd have a greater Ministry than brother brandom himself but then six years later brother Ram's convinced he doesn't even have a call to preach so let's listen to the quote Billy has been my Chum I raised him his mother died when he was just 18 months old and have been father and mother both to him but he seems like he doesn't have a call to be a preacher he's bashful backward and so forth whole lot like his mother shy but he's been a great help to me along in the meeting because I've trusted him take him out there and give him a responsible job and then another quote I want to share about Billy Paul is that 1951 brother brandham believed Billy Paul was his promised Joseph of course the Lord told Brother brandham he'd have a promised Joseph in the early 1950s his son Joseph wasn't born till 1955 but before that previous to that brother randam thought there wouldn't be enough time for him to have another son that would grow up to be a preacher so he actually thought Billy Paul was his promised Joseph so again if every word is thus sayith the Lord then Billy Paul's a promised Joseph and so is Joseph A promised Joseph so again if every word is thus said the Lord there's only confusion there's only deception so let's listen to that quote about the promised Joseph 1951 my little boy which is with us now soon be 16 years old he was he seemed to be a good boy he minded me him his very lovely little fellow but I talked to him about being baptized and making his public confession of Christ he lived good and everything a little fell but about a week after but about a week after that I walked into the house but I talked to him about being baptized and making his public confession of Christ he lived good and everything a little fell but about a week after that I walked into the house and he come without me asking or anything he said Daddy I want to be a Christian I want to serve the Lord my Joseph was right with me I didn't know it the little baby that I thought would be Joseph a little girl and I called her Sarah [Music] I'm thankful for her amen I love her with all my heart I had a boy and a girl it which way it went would be all right but I so wanted a a a boy and for so I he could be a minister of the gospel and I believe that God is calling my little boy back there go to be a minister of the [Music] [Applause] Gospel seeing the wisdom of God now I more understand if you ask God God will give you the desire of your heart I don't believe if the little baby would have been born to have come up to the age to be a minister Jesus will be here before that time I believe and God just thr it over on my little boy back there and that and we thank you for your kindness and God bless you now getting back to the Africa trip report quote from 1953 where brother brandom said Billy Paul's gift would be so much greater than his brother Rams would only be a little bitty gift compared to Billy Paul's if that is thus sayith the Lord then wouldn't brandom Tabernacle followers have to admit that Billy Paul failed to submit to God and that would mean that Billy Paul lived a life of rebellion now I'm not saying this to criticize Billy Paul or anyone else but to show the insanity of how tape worshippers worship every word on tape we cannot make every word on tape thus sayith the Lord we cannot make every word word on tape infallible it's complete Insanity if you do again if that's the case if every word is infallible then Billy Paul is the promised Joseph well then what is Joseph brandham see it causes so much confusion and then if every word's infallible then Billy Paul could have had a greater Ministry than brother brandham and brother bram's gift would have been little bitty compared to Billy Paul's but of course we know brother Bram had the greater Ministry he was a prophet he was Malachi 45 and6 he was Revelation 10:7 he was Luke 17 30 he was the seventh Church age messenger Revelation 3:14 he was the Forerunner to the second coming of Jesus Christ so Billy Paul's Ministry is not greater than brother bram's Ministry also here's a few quotes Angel Lord 1951 brother brandham says this is not the Lord speaking this is your brother brother brandham so this again shows not every word is from the Lord Brother BR plainly says it this is not the Lord so someone would have to be insane to say every word is from the Lord every word on tape is thus say the Lord when brother BR said it's not from the Lord let's listen to the quote now remember this now this is not the Lord speaking this is your brother brother brand and the best of my knowledge now just remember this and watch it close then here's another one questions that answers 1961 brother Ram said these answers are not infallible and yet tape worshippers will say every word on tape is infallible let's listen to the quote and these answers are not infallible see because the scriptures is infallible and as far as I know they're line with the scriptures I hope that makes it plain and the tape is to be uh kept now and anyone would want it well could have it but now I know the scriptures are infallible but my answers are not infallible so I'm sure everyone understands that and if it's not the if it's not infallible then you have a right maybe to ask me at any time if there's somebody else's question next I want to replay that quote about sister Rebecca God Rest her soul they're in heaven by God's grace but brother R thought she had a vision too and then brother Ram said she had her first Vision recently so maybe she's going to take my place someday so brother Ram's talking about having visions and that Rebecca had her first vision and maybe Rebecca would take his place someday day now did that ever happen did Rebecca ever take brother Ram's Place seeing visions I believe the answer is no if we're humble and if we're honest by the grace of God but again we're just seeing how brother R had High Hopes And desires and prayers for his children to have even greater Ministries than him but none of them did of course by the grace of God so let's listen to that quote about sister Rebecca all night long I couldn't get that POS of my mind the next morning early I went out as I started out little Rebecca who I believe is going to maybe take my place someday she seen her first Vision just recently and she's a very tenderhearted little thing and then lastly here's a quote again about Joseph from let us see God 1959 brother Ram said he wasn't thinking when he dedicated Joseph and said Joseph my son thou are a prophet he said that's my prayer anyhow so he didn't say that's my prayer with thus sayi the Lord he just said that's that's my prayer anyhow and I believe it'll be someday God will take everything that he ever gave me and double it times double and put on that boy then when I leave that he'll take my place so double * double double is two so 2 * 2 is four so brother BR prayed Joseph would have four times everything he had now has that come to pass of course not Joseph has not done four times the amount of prayer lines brother brandham has nor preached four times the amount of sermons as brother brand did nor traveled around the world four times as many times as brother brandham did so again this is just a father's loving prayer hopeful prayer for his child and of course we know Joseph brandham is not a prophet at least not yet I've talked to two of his childhood friends and they said they've never heard him speak or foretell anything in the name of the Lord that is the very requirement for being a prophet you have to speak something and it comes to pass in the name of the Lord and both these childhood friends love Brother Joseph and follow Brother Joseph Joseph they're not against Brother Joseph they're for him and they've never witnessed him in the role of a real prophet of God so let's listen to the quote when I dedicated him to the Lord the morning there was many little babies standing had mothers with him along the altar when I picked up Joseph in my arms not thinking of what I saying I said Joseph my son thou art a prophet that's my prayer anyhow and I believe it'll be that God will take everything that he ever give double times double and put on that boy that when I leave that he'll take my place so with that friends I'm going to end the video so I hope this was a blessing by the grace of God again speaking the truth in love and again looking at this quote from Africa trip report where brother Ram said my gift will be a little bitty thing compared to Billy Paul's where he'll win millions of Souls of course Billy Paul did not do that brother Ram said he felt he won perhaps 2 million souls and so any honest person would realize brother was just hopeful for his children these statements about his children having greater Ministries or taking his place someday or doing four times as much as he did were not thus sayi the Lord they did not come to pass because they're not prophecies they were just hopeful prayers from a loving father friends let's keep rightly dividing the word of Truth as the Holy Ghost commands us as brother Bram taught us as well brother Bram echoing the scriptures the Holy Ghost will lead and guide us into all Truth by the grace of God John 16: verse 13 if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
