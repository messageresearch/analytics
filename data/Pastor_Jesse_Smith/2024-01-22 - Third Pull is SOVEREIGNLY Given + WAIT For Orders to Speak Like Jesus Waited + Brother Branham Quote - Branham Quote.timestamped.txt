[0:00] the third pull and the speaking the word
[0:05] it seems entirely possible for you to
[0:08] speak the word and one would be
[0:10] completely and fully restored placed
[0:13] entirely ready for the Rapture in the
[0:16] resurrection th son of man this is so or
[0:19] is it
[0:21] not and you would do this if properly
[0:26] pressed upon would you not Escape all
[0:29] these things things that's got a little
[0:31] there escaped all these things and stand
[0:34] before the son of man Luke
[0:38] 2136 now my my dear
[0:42] friend now I think here that you you got
[0:45] to you got a good statement yes sir yes
[0:48] sir now that would be so he said brother
[0:50] Brandon in other words here's what I'm I
[0:52] don't think it's I can I believe I not
[0:54] polishing up what you said but I believe
[0:56] I can make it a little clearer to people
[0:57] see you are believing because of the
[1:00] spoken words and things like that that
[1:02] he said about and all of you here
[1:03] Witnesses squirrels and all these other
[1:05] things that's been done but did you
[1:07] notice that was sovereignly
[1:10] given I never asked him Lord let me do
[1:14] this speak these things in like that do
[1:16] these things there I never asked him
[1:18] that he by his own Divine
[1:21] will came to me and said you go do this
[1:26] see I wasn't asking one thing about it
[1:29] Moses never asked to go down in Egypt
[1:31] but it was God that sent him down to
[1:33] Egypt see now I believe if the Holy
[1:36] Spirit would come to me and say in a
[1:38] vision go tell certain certain person
[1:41] that they are not uh they're trying to
[1:43] overcome a certain thing and they cannot
[1:46] do it they're smoking they're drinking
[1:47] they're lying stealing or committing
[1:49] adultery whatever it might be or they
[1:51] got lustful spirit and you just go where
[1:54] their are and say thou Spirit come out
[1:57] of there I set this captive free
[2:00] would it take place
[2:02] absolutely yes indeed it absolutely
[2:04] would it take place but now upon my own
[2:08] presuming now presume is means to
[2:10] Adventure without Authority see I go
[2:13] down there to help this person I'm just
[2:15] presuming that it'll be all right see
[2:18] then I don't know I can call the name of
[2:20] the Lord over him I can pray for him do
[2:22] whatever I wish to if I had my own way
[2:25] this morning I I just had an interview
[2:27] with this little lady sitting here in
[2:28] this wheelchair to come to this meeting
[2:30] today they had had a fire department
[2:32] take her out of her house in Chicago and
[2:34] people live across the street don't come
[2:35] to the meeting see what would I do if it
[2:38] was in my power it is in I have the
[2:41] authority to do it but I have to wait
[2:43] for orders to do it see I have the
[2:47] authority from God to do it but now when
[2:49] he gives the orders she go back home
[2:52] well see I know that is the truth I just
[2:57] be as willing to die this morning on
[2:58] that as I I'd be an any see that's the
[3:00] truth but first you see it's all that no
[3:03] one even Jesus himself said the son can
[3:06] do nothing in
[3:08] himself but what he seeth the father do
[3:11] that doeth the son likewise you know
[3:13] that St John
[3:15] 5:19 all right the son does nothing in
[3:18] himself but what he sees the father
[3:19] doing that the son will do likewise all
[3:22] right
