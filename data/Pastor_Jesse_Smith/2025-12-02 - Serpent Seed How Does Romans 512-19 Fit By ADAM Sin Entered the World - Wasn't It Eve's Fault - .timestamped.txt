[0:03] and the seed of the serpent,
[0:06] that's the killer.
[0:08] Many people don't believe that, but if
[0:10] you'll just read in Genesis, the Bible
[0:12] said that the serpent had a seed.
[0:17] &gt;&gt; Greetings, friends, in the matchless
[0:18] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. [music]
[0:20] The purpose of this video is to answer a
[0:22] viewer's question about how Romans
[0:26] 5 12-19 [music]
[0:29] fit in with the serpent seed revelation.
[0:32] This is an excellent [music] question,
[0:34] one I've had myself before and one I
[0:37] addressed a couple years ago when I
[0:38] preached through the entire book of
[0:40] Romans by the grace of [music] Almighty
[0:41] God. So, let's get into this question
[0:43] here. by the grace of God. I'm not going
[0:46] to read all of Romans 5 [music]
[0:49] 12-19, but I'm going to focus on four
[0:51] phrases just to save some time. The
[0:54] Bible said, quote, "By one man sin
[0:56] entered." End quote. The second phrase
[0:59] is sinned, Adam's transgression. End
[1:03] quote. Third, one man's offense.
[1:07] And fourth, one man's disobedience. So
[1:10] these four phrases put the burden of sin
[1:14] upon Adam. So someone who believes in
[1:16] the serpent seed who's new to it might
[1:18] wonder, well why does God place the
[1:20] blame on Adam when we know Eve was
[1:23] deceived first in the beginning? In
[1:26] other words, she sinned first. So this
[1:28] is a great question. It deals with the
[1:30] mystery of iniquity as I wrote in my
[1:32] 2021 book about the 12 New Testament
[1:34] mysteries. And for your reference, the
[1:36] mystery of iniquity was in 2
[1:38] Thessalonians 2:7, speaking of the
[1:41] future Antichrist, but Paul said it was
[1:44] already working over 2,000 years ago.
[1:47] And of course, we can trace back
[1:49] iniquity all the way back to the Garden
[1:50] of Eden. The 12 New Testament mysteries
[1:53] that God had, brother Random, finish
[1:55] according to Revelation 10:7. And the
[1:57] mystery of iniquity, of course, deals
[1:59] with the antichrist spirit from the
[2:01] beginning all the way to the end.
[2:03] Another way to put it is, as brother
[2:05] Brandham put it, the trail of the
[2:07] serpent. So the serpent seed shows how
[2:10] iniquity came into the world, into
[2:12] humanity. Of course, in Genesis chapter
[2:15] 3, we know iniquity started in heaven
[2:17] when Satan split the first church of
[2:20] God. Of course, he deceived a third of
[2:23] the angels, but then Satan was kicked
[2:25] out of heaven after the war with
[2:26] Michael. And Satan came down to the
[2:29] garden of God as the Bible says in
[2:31] Isaiah 14 and Ezekiel chapter 28. And
[2:34] then Satan possessed the beast serpent
[2:37] and seduced Eve, beguiled her, and
[2:41] deceived her into sinning. So there's at
[2:43] least four points we want to make here
[2:45] to show how Romans 5:12-19 fits
[2:48] perfectly in with the serpent seed
[2:50] revelation. Remember, God started the
[2:52] serpent seed teaching and revelation in
[2:54] Genesis 3:1 15. When God said he was
[2:58] going to put emnity or hatred between
[3:00] thy seed, the serpent's seed, and the
[3:03] woman's seed, which would be her
[3:05] offspring received from Adam, and then
[3:07] of course through Christ, who was the
[3:09] true seed of the woman, the seed given
[3:12] to Mary, of course. So, let's go back to
[3:14] those four phrases real quick. Quote,
[3:16] "By one man, sin entered." End quote.
[3:19] Sin entered because Adam was given
[3:21] dominion. He let sin enter the human
[3:24] race. So, we'll get to that in just a
[3:25] moment. The second phrase, quote,
[3:27] sinned, Adam's transgression, end quote.
[3:30] Adam purposely sinned. Eve did not
[3:33] purposely sin. Third, quote, one man's
[3:37] offense. End quote. And this word
[3:38] offense in Greek means a lapse or a
[3:41] deviation. Adam had a lapse. Adam
[3:44] deviated from the word of God which he
[3:46] knew. Again, Eve did not. She was
[3:49] deceived. And fourth, quote, one man's
[3:51] disobedience. End quote. Adam disobeyed
[3:54] the word of God that he knew and also
[3:56] the word that was forever settled in
[3:58] heaven. So let's get into these four
[4:00] points here I want to make about this
[4:01] and show how Romans 5:12-19 fits
[4:04] perfectly with the serpent seed
[4:05] revelation. First, Adam bears
[4:08] responsibility because he was given
[4:09] dominion by the Lord over the garden and
[4:12] everything in the garden in Genesis 1
[4:15] 26-28.
[4:17] So because Adam was given
[4:18] responsibility, he failed. Eve was not
[4:21] protected enough. it seems. And so that
[4:24] was Adam's fault. Adam was given
[4:26] dominion. And so we would say sin
[4:29] happened on Adam's watch or Adam's
[4:31] dominion.
[4:33] Second, perhaps Adam's neglect was
[4:36] because he was sleeping. Now, this is
[4:38] only presuming here, but but it is an
[4:41] interesting thought from Matthew chapter
[4:43] 13. Matthew 13:25 says, "But while men
[4:47] slept, his enemy came and sowed tears
[4:48] among the wheat and went his way." So
[4:51] this is Jesus's parable, but it relates
[4:53] to the garden of Eden. There was two
[4:56] sewers in one field, just as there were
[4:58] two males that had seed and Eve was the
[5:02] one garden. Of course, Adam was one and
[5:04] then the beast was the other. So this is
[5:07] a possibility. Adam could have been
[5:08] sleeping and again that would have been
[5:10] neglectful because it was his job to
[5:12] take dominion over the Garden of Eden.
[5:16] Third, Adam purposely sinned. Eve did
[5:18] not because the Bible said Eve was
[5:21] deceived in 1 Timothy chapter 2 verse 14
[5:24] says Adam was not deceived but the woman
[5:26] being deceived was in the transgression.
[5:28] So Eve did not know what she was doing
[5:31] necessarily. Adam knew what he was doing
[5:33] when he sinned when he saw Eve in her
[5:36] defiled state. He knew what he was doing
[5:38] when he parttook of the fruit or in that
[5:40] case sexual relations. But again this is
[5:42] the reason women are not allowed to
[5:44] preach because Eve was deceived with the
[5:46] word of God. That's spoken of in two
[5:48] places in the scripture. 1 Timothy 2 and
[5:51] then 1 Corinthians chapter 14 where Paul
[5:54] says women are not allowed to speak in
[5:57] the church concerning preaching the word
[5:59] of God. And then all the commentators
[6:02] that I've read from the 1800s such as
[6:05] Albert Barnes, Matthew Henry, John
[6:07] Wesley, they all point back to Genesis
[6:09] 3:16 where Adam was given rulership over
[6:12] Eve. He would rule over her. And so
[6:16] therefore, she was not allowed to preach
[6:18] and teach him. She was not allowed to
[6:20] rule over him. And fourth and finally,
[6:23] the blame is placed on Adam because Adam
[6:25] should not have taken Eve back based
[6:28] upon the word that was already settled
[6:30] in heaven. Brother Ram talks about this
[6:32] in the church age book. Now Psalm 119
[6:36] says the word of God is forever settled
[6:38] in heaven. And brother Ram states that
[6:40] how even though Adam was on earth, the
[6:43] word of God was already settled in
[6:44] heaven. God already had a written record
[6:46] in heaven of his word and how to carry
[6:49] out his word. So the eternal word would
[6:51] have already said that a defiled wife
[6:53] with another man or beast in this case
[6:56] should have been stoned according to
[6:58] Leviticus 20 10. So that word of course
[7:02] wasn't written yet because Moses wrote
[7:04] it, but it was already written in
[7:06] [clears throat] heaven. And so that was
[7:08] God's decision on what should have
[7:10] happened. But we know Adam loved his
[7:13] wife just as Christ loved the church. So
[7:15] Adam purposely took on Eve's sin in
[7:17] order to be with her because he loved
[7:20] her. She was part of him. Christ
[7:21] willingly took on our sin because we
[7:23] were part of him. We were chosen in
[7:25] Christ before the foundation of the
[7:26] world. Ephesians 1:4. Now something
[7:29] Deuteronomy 24:es 1-4 was the word of
[7:33] God that was forever settled in heaven
[7:35] that Adam broke. But I personally don't
[7:37] see that because if you read all four
[7:39] verses, it seems that this refers to a
[7:41] man who has divorced his wife, sent her
[7:44] away. She's already married another man,
[7:47] and then the Bible said in verse four
[7:49] that he can't take her back because it's
[7:51] an abomination. She's defiled. But Adam
[7:53] didn't do this. Adam didn't divorce Eve
[7:56] first, send her away, and then she had
[7:58] adultery with the serpent, and then she
[8:00] came back to Adam. So, some have used
[8:03] those verses, Deuteronomy 24, but I
[8:05] think Leviticus 20:10 is the more
[8:07] appropriate verse. Brother Ram wrote
[8:09] about this question in the third chapter
[8:12] of the church age book, the Ephesian
[8:14] church age. It was page 104 in the old
[8:17] blue book. Brother Ram wrote, quote, "If
[8:19] Eve fell that way, what did Adam do for
[8:22] God? Lays the blame on Adam. That is
[8:24] simple. The word of God is forever
[8:26] settled in heaven before one speck of
[8:28] stardust was made. That word, God's law
[8:30] was there exactly as it is written in
[8:32] our Bible. Now, the word teaches us that
[8:34] if a woman leaves her husband and goes
[8:37] with another man, she is an adulteress
[8:39] and is no longer married and the husband
[8:41] is not to take her back. That word was
[8:43] true in Eden, as it was true when Moses
[8:45] wrote it in the law. The word can't
[8:47] change. Adam took her back. He knew
[8:49] exactly what he was doing, but he did it
[8:51] anyway.
[8:53] He knew exactly what would happen to the
[8:55] human race. And he sold the human race
[8:57] into sin that he might have Eve, for he
[8:59] loved her. End quote. So, I hope this
[9:01] was helpful, friends, by God's grace.
[9:03] And in closing, let's remember those
[9:05] nine evidences that we've compiled by
[9:08] God's grace through brother Bram's
[9:09] sermons. Nine evidences or proofs of the
[9:12] serpent seed revelation. And here's the
[9:15] evidences in the order of their
[9:17] appearance. The first evidence of the
[9:18] serpent seed, the two trees in the midst
[9:21] were not literal trees because the Bible
[9:23] said they were good for food and any
[9:25] tree that will kill you is not good for
[9:27] food. That's Genesis 2:9. Second, the
[9:30] tree of life in the garden was the
[9:33] spirit of Jesus according to Genesis
[9:34] 2:9. Because there's only one way to
[9:37] eternal life. Jesus is the way, the
[9:38] truth, and the life. Eating literal
[9:41] fruit could never give eternal life.
[9:45] Eternal life only comes by grace through
[9:47] faith in the word of God. Third, the
[9:50] serpent was humanlike before the fall
[9:51] according to Genesis 3:es 1-5 and verse
[9:55] 14. The fourth proof is pretty powerful.
[9:59] After their sin, whatever sin they
[10:01] committed, Adam and Eve realized they
[10:04] were naked and then sewed aprons or loin
[10:07] coverings together. In Genesis 3:7, we
[10:10] know God's punishments always fit the
[10:12] crime. And so if they sinned with their
[10:14] mouth and ate fruit, they would have
[10:15] covered their mouth. But they didn't
[10:16] cover their mouth. They covered their
[10:19] private parts, their loins, and they
[10:21] knew they were naked.
[10:24] Fifth, the seed of the woman was a
[10:25] literal man, Jesus. So the seed of the
[10:27] serpent must be a literal man as well.
[10:30] And that was Cain. Six, Cain was the
[10:32] serpent's son, not Adam's son. According
[10:34] to 1 John 3:12, not as Cain who was of
[10:38] that wicked one and slew his brother.
[10:40] Cain was not of Adam because Adam was
[10:43] blessed and righteous. Cain was of the
[10:46] serpent, that wicked one. Adam was not
[10:49] the wicked one. Seventh, God's
[10:52] punishments for Eve centered on her
[10:54] sexual reproduction and longing for
[10:56] Adam. So again, God's punishments always
[10:58] fit the crime. Because Eve received the
[11:02] wrong seed, she was punished in bringing
[11:05] forth seed and had pain in bringing
[11:08] forth seed. and her longing was for the
[11:11] serpent beforehand. So God changed it
[11:13] and said, "Your longing is going to be
[11:14] for Adam." Eighth, this is super
[11:17] powerful. The serpent seed explains the
[11:19] virgin birth. Why did Jesus have to come
[11:22] by virgin birth? Because sin entered the
[11:24] world through a sexual act of adultery.
[11:27] So God had to bypass that in order to
[11:29] start a new creation in order to redeem
[11:32] his people. It took a virgin birth to
[11:36] bring forth redemption.
[11:38] man fell through sexual sin. So it took
[11:40] a virgin birth to restore mankind.
[11:44] And ninth and last, the doctrine of the
[11:46] serpent seed runs from Genesis to
[11:48] Revelation.
[11:50] So I want to thank that brother who
[11:51] emailed about this months ago. I'm
[11:53] finally getting to it now. I felt led to
[11:55] address this. So we rejoice in the
[11:57] revelations God has revealed to us.
[11:59] Remember, Brother Bam told us marriage
[12:01] and divorce and serpent seed were
[12:02] revelations along with the seven seals
[12:04] that were thus sayith the Lord. And
[12:06] truly they are because they line up with
[12:08] the holy scriptures. And we can clearly
[12:10] see how Romans 5 12-19 fits in with the
[12:14] revelation of the serpent seed. Friends,
[12:16] we should rejoice. Serpent seed doesn't
[12:18] save us, but it shines more light on the
[12:20] truth we're all trying to see.
[12:22] &gt;&gt; And if you do not understand it, I'm I'm
[12:25] available anytime to do my very best to
[12:28] help you by letter or by or by personal
[12:32] interview or anything that I could do to
[12:34] help you. Of course, we realize that
[12:36] that doesn't save a man. Neither does it
[12:38] condemn a man. But it only brings light
[12:41] upon the subject that we're all trying
[12:43] so hard to get the people to see.
[12:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:46] &gt;&gt; It only brings light.
[12:47] &gt;&gt; Thank God for the truth of the word of
[12:49] God. Thank God that our eyes have been
[12:51] open and enlightened to the revelation
[12:53] of the Holy Spirit. It is only the Holy
[12:55] Spirit that gives light. As I read this
[12:57] morning in the church age book, the oil
[12:59] from the candlestick help produce light.
[13:02] And so the Holy Spirit will produce
[13:05] light and revelation in our lives. Thank
[13:07] God for the light of the Holy Ghost. If

[13:21] Very happy to be here this afternoon and
[13:23] again in defense of the gospel of Jesus
[13:25] Christ to bring the good tidings, the
[13:28] good news that Jesus raised from the
[13:30] dead, living among man today, his
[13:32] church. [music]
[13:34] The same Jesus that was yesterday will
[13:36] be today and forever. He's never failed.
