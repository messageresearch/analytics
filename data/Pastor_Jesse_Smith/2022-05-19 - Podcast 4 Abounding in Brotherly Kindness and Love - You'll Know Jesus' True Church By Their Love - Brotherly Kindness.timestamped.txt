[0:11] god bless you and welcome to the
[0:13] defending the message podcast i'm your
[0:16] co-host pastor jesse smith and here's
[0:18] our other co-host
[0:19] um i'm amen god bless you everyone we
[0:22] just want to thank you guys for coming
[0:23] and joining us today for our podcast
[0:25] today and we're here to defend the faith
[0:28] and defend the message today's topic is
[0:31] about love
[0:32] especially about love in the churches as
[0:34] we want to have brotherly kindness
[0:36] towards one another i think this is a
[0:37] very big topic
[0:39] that a lot of churches sometimes
[0:41] struggles with and this is why we want
[0:43] to bring it forth
[0:44] so in this podcast we want to defend the
[0:46] true followers of the message because
[0:48] when this message is taught from the
[0:49] bible it produces genuine brotherly
[0:52] kindness and love in churches today some
[0:55] of the people that have left message
[0:56] churches recently have criticized
[0:58] message churches for not having love
[1:00] which could be true in some individual
[1:02] churches but certainly not all
[1:04] i think it's safe to say that even the
[1:05] churches of brother graham's accusers
[1:07] the churches that they attend are not
[1:09] perfect and they don't always express
[1:11] the love of god
[1:12] no message church is perfect but the
[1:14] sincere ones are pressing on toward the
[1:16] mark of the high calling of god in
[1:18] christ jesus which is growing in broadly
[1:21] kindness and divine love
[1:22] so we're here to defend that this
[1:24] message the bible-based revelations that
[1:26] god gave to brother branham will produce
[1:28] broadly kindness and divine love in
[1:30] genuine worshipers of jesus christ
[1:33] for today's podcast we have four
[1:35] sections so here's the outline
[1:38] first we'll define brotherly kindness
[1:40] and divine love by the bible including
[1:42] six evidences from jesus christ himself
[1:45] that a person is born again with the
[1:47] love of god
[1:48] second we'll share some good experiences
[1:50] with brotherly kindness and love and
[1:52] some bad experiences when we felt a lack
[1:54] of brotherly kindness and love and of
[1:56] course we won't call names in this
[1:58] episode but we want to use these
[1:59] examples so that we can all learn to be
[2:01] better christians and express broadly
[2:03] kindness and love more often
[2:05] thirdly we'll discuss five ways
[2:07] christians can show love to the saints
[2:09] in their home church
[2:11] and lastly we'll discuss how church
[2:12] discipline is an expression of broadly
[2:15] kindness and love
[2:21] it's very helpful of course to give
[2:23] definitions so let's define brotherly
[2:24] kindness if you look in the greek
[2:26] lexicon the word for brotherly kindness
[2:28] is philadelphia which is familiar to all
[2:31] of us
[2:32] it means love of brothers or sisters the
[2:33] love which christians cherish for each
[2:36] other as brethren
[2:38] so brother kindness is a cherished love
[2:41] that christians share and it's unique to
[2:43] christianity because only christians can
[2:45] express the genuine love of jesus christ
[2:47] because they have the spirit of jesus
[2:49] christ in their souls and also anointing
[2:52] their minds daily
[2:53] and their bodies as well
[2:55] in order to find love we just call it
[2:57] charity as first corinthians 13 talks
[2:59] about and to simplify it we would just
[3:01] say it is the character of jesus christ
[3:03] because in first corinthians 13 they
[3:06] give us 16 attributes of love
[3:09] such as suffereth long kind envieth not
[3:13] vaunteth not itself not puffed up doth
[3:17] not behave itself unseemly seeketh not
[3:19] her own not easily provoked thinketh no
[3:22] evil
[3:23] rejoiceth not iniquity rejoiceth in the
[3:26] truth beareth all things believeth all
[3:29] things hope with all things endureth all
[3:32] things and charity never fails
[3:35] so brother amen which scripture would
[3:36] you start with that you think would be
[3:38] the most helpful place to start for us i
[3:40] think first corinthians 13 1-3
[3:43] i think this one's a really big one for
[3:45] us because we know so much about the
[3:46] word the revelation of god's word and we
[3:49] have to be careful not to be prideful or
[3:51] to exalt ourselves among one another
[3:54] thinking that we're better than one in
[3:55] life because we have more of a
[3:56] revelation of the word or
[3:58] we've been in the messes for way longer
[4:00] than someone else
[4:02] you know that does not give us a reason
[4:04] to be prideful or to be boastful and not
[4:06] want to fellowship or talk about the
[4:09] word
[4:10] and i'll read first corinthians 13 for
[4:12] us though i speak with tongues of men
[4:14] and of angels and have not charity i
[4:16] become a sounding brass or a tinkling
[4:19] symbol and though i have the gifts of
[4:21] prophecy and understanding all mysteries
[4:23] and all knowledge and though i have all
[4:25] faith so that i can remove mountains and
[4:27] have not charity i am nothing and though
[4:30] i bestow all my goods to feed the poor
[4:32] and though i give my body to be burned
[4:34] and that charity it profits me nothing
[4:37] there are so many things in that
[4:38] scripture brother that is a beautiful
[4:40] choice the holy spirit led you to that
[4:43] i think for our day
[4:45] we know the mystery of god is finished
[4:46] according to revelation 10 7 god
[4:48] fulfilled it through his prophet brother
[4:50] william branham but that scripture hits
[4:52] the nail on the head the fact that we
[4:54] can understand all the mysteries of god
[4:57] but if we don't have charity it profits
[5:00] us nothing in other words we can
[5:01] understand all the mysteries god
[5:03] revealed through brother branham's
[5:04] ministry but if we are not born again
[5:06] with the baptism of the holy ghost it
[5:08] doesn't profit us anything
[5:10] because like like you said brother amen
[5:12] we can be prideful and so we've got to
[5:14] make sure that we don't exalt ourselves
[5:16] above other people in the message or
[5:19] exalt ourselves above non-message people
[5:22] or we'd say denominational christians
[5:24] because we know we're going to be
[5:25] tempted in one of three areas lust of
[5:27] the eyes lust of the flesh pride of life
[5:30] a lot of message people are able to
[5:31] overcome the lust of the eyes lust of
[5:33] the flesh but as we've noticed recently
[5:35] and also as we'll probably do future
[5:37] podcasts or youtube videos about many
[5:39] times pride gets into people's hearts
[5:41] and lives and so we got to be very
[5:43] careful to not let satan deceive us into
[5:46] thinking we're better than other people
[5:47] because of the revelations we've
[5:49] received
[5:50] also there's a good scripture from
[5:51] matthew 24 12 because of iniquities
[5:54] about the love of many wax cult we might
[5:57] be too worthy sometimes or love the
[5:59] things of the world too much where we
[6:01] don't love our brother as we ought to
[6:03] maybe we put our eyes off from god and
[6:06] to other things you know maybe like
[6:08] making money or starting your business
[6:10] you know sometimes life just gets in
[6:12] front of you and you forget about your
[6:13] brother to care for your brother and
[6:16] life's not always about us but we ought
[6:17] to serve one another yeah this is the
[6:20] age of self-love as paul said
[6:23] i believe it's in second timothy chapter
[6:25] three they'll be lovers of their own
[6:27] selves
[6:28] and lovers of pleasures more than lovers
[6:31] of god so if there's ever been an age
[6:33] where we need love it's this age because
[6:36] jesus said because iniquity abounds as
[6:38] you read the love of god will wax cold
[6:41] and i think we can feel it in our lives
[6:43] um
[6:44] no doubt even brother branham could feel
[6:45] it if you listen to that sermon or if
[6:48] our listeners would listen to that
[6:49] sermon what house will you bill me 1965
[6:51] brother branham talked about how he felt
[6:54] the brother is getting a little cold in
[6:55] the spirit and how he longed for that
[6:57] feeling when he first got saved so i
[6:59] think it's something that everybody
[7:01] feels as they get older in the lord you
[7:03] know they get more tired they get more
[7:04] worn out
[7:05] but especially here in laodicea where
[7:08] self-love and
[7:10] worshiping of money riches and all these
[7:12] things is is so valued
[7:15] that we have to be very careful that the
[7:16] cares of the world don't spring up in
[7:19] our lives and choke out the love of god
[7:21] in our lives we've got to as brahman
[7:23] said get our eyes off ourselves and get
[7:25] them onto other
[7:28] [Music]
[7:29] one of people
[7:30] if you feel like i do
[7:34] i am so hungry
[7:36] to see the spirit of god moving
[7:40] i just can't hardly stand it
[7:43] some experiences
[7:45] i've said up in the mountains
[7:49] just to feel that once again
[7:52] that's something that when i was first
[7:54] saved that was so glorious to my heart
[7:58] and we can come into a place
[8:00] we can set and we see it among us that
[8:03] we're drying
[8:05] as we sit here in the desert i get among
[8:08] my brothers and they talk with me and
[8:09] i'll talk with them
[8:11] always in a little way of watching
[8:13] feeling out there in the spirit as it
[8:16] was to see just the condition of that
[8:18] brother to see what's wrong i begin to
[8:20] feel this all reclining getting away
[8:23] from the spirit it's become too natural
[8:26] a thing to us
[8:28] we must worship in the spirit
[8:30] for the spirit of god not only our
[8:32] message should be the flame uh of the
[8:35] hour this should be the flame in our
[8:37] hearts
[8:38] amen see it's got to be in our hearts or
[8:41] we can't
[8:42] we can't rightly present it to the
[8:44] people
[8:45] the spirit has to pack the message
[8:47] itself
[8:50] and i'm trusting and believing in every
[8:51] one of you to be a real christian
[8:55] now let's look at six evidences of being
[8:58] born again with the love of god from
[9:00] jesus christ himself
[9:02] so one of the marks of being a real
[9:03] genuine christian is having brotherly
[9:05] love
[9:06] and charity as we'd say jesus christ
[9:09] says all men so even sinners will know
[9:11] we're christians because of how we love
[9:14] each other and of course how we love
[9:16] them as well so now we're getting into
[9:18] kind of the evidence of the holy ghost
[9:19] what is evidence a person is truly born
[9:21] again now we know we can summarize and
[9:23] just say it's believing all the word of
[9:25] your day well that's true but what is
[9:27] the word of our day it's the whole bible
[9:29] it's all the bible scriptures that
[9:30] pertain to holy ghostfield christians
[9:33] and so that includes loving one another
[9:35] as john 13 35 says it also includes
[9:39] supernatural signs and wonders done by
[9:40] the holy ghost according to mark 16
[9:43] verses 17-18
[9:45] it includes remembering jesus's words
[9:48] john 14 26 the holy ghost shall bring
[9:50] all things to remembrance whatsoever i
[9:53] have said unto you so that's where the
[9:54] holy ghost will remind you oh go make
[9:56] this right go apologize about that or
[9:58] remind you oh i need to humble myself
[10:00] because i was prideful the holy ghost
[10:02] brings all these words of jesus to our
[10:04] remembrance
[10:05] also
[10:06] testifying about and glorifying jesus
[10:10] john 15 26 and 16 14 say the spirit of
[10:13] truth he shall testify of me and the
[10:15] spirit of truth shall glorify me someone
[10:18] that really has the love of god they'll
[10:20] want to glorify jesus christ they want
[10:21] to worship and praise his wonderful name
[10:24] they want to testify about jesus that's
[10:26] what we're doing today we're testifying
[10:28] about the love of jesus christ how it's
[10:29] been expressed to us
[10:31] and then also the holy ghost will tell
[10:32] us future events john 16 13 the spirit
[10:34] of truth will show you things to come
[10:37] and then one more
[10:38] listening to and believing the human
[10:40] messenger sent to preach during their
[10:42] lifetimes jesus said this in john 17
[10:45] verses 20 and 21 he said neither pray i
[10:48] for these alone but for them also which
[10:51] shall believe on me through their word
[10:53] that they all may be one
[10:55] so people that really love jesus christ
[10:57] they just got to hear brother branham
[10:59] preach and if they hear brother ben
[11:00] preach about jesus and the cross and the
[11:02] holy ghost and the laodicean age we live
[11:05] in and how god is going to rapture his
[11:06] true bride out of this age they will
[11:08] recognize the love of god in brother
[11:10] branham's life because he loved jesus
[11:12] christ more than money he loved jesus
[11:13] christ more than popularity or any other
[11:15] thing like that he was a true servant of
[11:17] god so when we receive brother branham
[11:19] we receive christ who sent brother
[11:21] branham and also the holy father who
[11:23] sent christ as well according to jesus's
[11:25] own words
[11:31] based upon first thessalonians 3 verse
[11:33] 12 we want to talk about some wonderful
[11:36] times when god has shown his love to us
[11:38] through other saints or maybe even
[11:39] people that weren't in the message that
[11:41] we just knew and recognized it was the
[11:43] love of god now the scripture says and
[11:45] the lord make you to increase and abound
[11:47] in love one toward another and toward
[11:50] all men even as we do toward you so one
[11:53] of the first ones that comes to my mind
[11:55] is when we had our fourth child we just
[11:57] moved to a different house and there was
[11:59] a brother who lived in pennsylvania he
[12:01] lived two hours away well there's a
[12:02] wonderful message church in pennsylvania
[12:04] two hours away from us
[12:06] and they had it on their hearts they
[12:07] knew our baby was coming and once we had
[12:09] the baby they loaded up their entire
[12:11] truck bed full of frozen foods and the
[12:14] brother drove two hours on a saturday to
[12:16] drop off an entire
[12:18] truckload of food and thankfully just
[12:21] got an extra freezer down in the
[12:22] basement and so we had two freezers we
[12:25] were able to fill up both and they just
[12:27] fit inside of our freezers
[12:30] and the one that wouldn't fit that's
[12:31] what we had for supper that night and i
[12:33] just remember tears were coming to my
[12:34] eyes i just couldn't believe how another
[12:36] church could think so much about someone
[12:39] else from the church and then drive all
[12:41] that way with all that food to bless
[12:43] this humble little
[12:44] family of four and then later when we
[12:46] had like our seventh child i remember
[12:48] that same church sent us a 300 gift card
[12:50] to giant eagle because they knew we
[12:51] liked eating that giant eagle
[12:53] after services and things like that so
[12:55] again people we don't even see every
[12:57] week we don't even see these people
[12:58] maybe once or twice a year if that
[13:00] but they have so much love of god in
[13:02] their hearts that all these sisters can
[13:04] cook all these meals and send the food
[13:05] over it just meant a lot to us and
[13:07] that's where i could say their love
[13:09] abounded one toward another
[13:11] i remember meeting some other people um
[13:13] just when i first first started meeting
[13:15] some other message believers
[13:18] it's always wonderful when you can talk
[13:19] to someone and you just have
[13:21] you feel the holy ghost coming from them
[13:24] you just have that same connection it's
[13:27] it's like you just feel the love of god
[13:29] pouring from that person and it just
[13:30] makes it so easy just to talk to one
[13:32] another and i remember a few of our
[13:34] brothers that i've met for the first
[13:36] time and we just hit it off the bat
[13:39] because this is the love of god
[13:41] it's great to know that someone else has
[13:43] to experience the same love that you
[13:45] experience with god
[13:47] and to able to talk to someone like that
[13:49] and just be able to connect and
[13:52] just to grow as a brother just to know
[13:54] that this man is your brother that
[13:56] really loves god
[13:58] and know that he will really love you
[13:59] too and it's great to have those
[14:01] brothers
[14:02] there are just so many examples of how
[14:04] christians have poured out their love to
[14:06] us i mean there's been numerous times
[14:08] i've just gone out to the mailbox
[14:10] and inside the mailbox are letters with
[14:12] checks for 1 000 or 1500 or 2 thousand
[14:15] dollars sometimes there's names on the
[14:17] checks and i know who sent them you know
[14:19] other preachers or just friends and
[14:22] other times they're anonymous so the
[14:23] only way i can understand this is that
[14:25] god has placed his love in people's
[14:27] hearts
[14:28] and when i've received those cash
[14:30] offerings or whatever i've really needed
[14:33] them one time i needed to pay off my car
[14:35] that helped me pay off my car one time i
[14:37] needed money for my next college course
[14:40] that came in very handy other times i
[14:42] needed offerings to pay off my books
[14:45] which god has always provided i've not
[14:47] had to spend one cent of my own money on
[14:48] those books god has always provided
[14:50] graciously and then there's a time when
[14:52] i prayed for god to help get a brother
[14:55] in our church out of debt and god sent
[14:57] twelve thousand five hundred dollars
[14:59] from a man i didn't even know he just
[15:01] always enjoyed our youtube ministry and
[15:03] he felt led to send it and it just came
[15:05] at the right time and the right season
[15:06] again unparalleled love i never saw this
[15:09] love when i was in the denominational
[15:10] churches although i did feel loved to
[15:12] some degree
[15:13] but here when we come into the message
[15:14] of the hour i felt love in abundance as
[15:17] the scripture says here and i can see
[15:18] that love growing toward one another
[15:21] yeah that's what really drew me to the
[15:23] message just to love when i first met
[15:25] you i just felt the love of god just
[15:27] come from you
[15:29] and that just that's what drew me to
[15:31] this message
[15:32] to experience that know that god is real
[15:35] and there's people that actually really
[15:37] love god and because they love god they
[15:39] can love each other i think as
[15:42] there's a scripture that says um
[15:45] they shall know us by our love towards
[15:46] one another in john 13 35
[15:50] says by this shall all men know that ye
[15:52] are my disciples if you have loved one
[15:54] to another that's a really good
[15:56] scripture especially when we have guest
[15:59] visitors that come and they always say
[16:02] wow we feel the love of god just coming
[16:04] from your church
[16:05] we're not breaking or boasting or
[16:07] anything
[16:08] but it's just
[16:09] you know god is
[16:11] god has saved us by his grace and we
[16:13] just love god so much
[16:15] that we just want to give and love other
[16:17] people just as he has loved us
[16:19] hallelujah you know that reminds me
[16:21] brother last
[16:22] year towards the end of 2021 we had a
[16:24] sister visit our church and she come in
[16:26] we greeted her and everything and we
[16:28] talked and fellowshipped and she visited
[16:29] a couple of times over the course of a
[16:31] few months
[16:32] but the last time she visited she said i
[16:34] just want to thank you she said i feel
[16:35] so much love in your little church and
[16:37] we only have 25 30 and half of those are
[16:40] kids you know
[16:42] but she said i go to a church where
[16:44] there's 300 she said i feel like it's a
[16:46] mega church and she said i hardly feel
[16:48] any love in the church and she said i
[16:50] just want to thank you that you
[16:52] expressed love to me
[16:53] and so that has always stuck with me
[16:55] over these you know last six months or
[16:56] so i need to remember to always show
[16:59] god's love to visitors and stay humble
[17:01] and not get prideful and remember where
[17:04] i came from and really remember that the
[17:06] greatest gift of all faith hope and
[17:08] charity the greatest of these is charity
[17:11] another good example of is when i first
[17:13] came in the message we were college
[17:14] students and we were visiting this
[17:15] church up in sheffield wonderful saints
[17:17] i believe holy ghost-filled saints well
[17:19] we were just kind of you know college
[17:20] students and there was one certain
[17:22] brother named brother bill
[17:24] and almost every sunday we'd walk up
[17:25] shake his hand and when i shake his hand
[17:28] i'd pull my hand back and there'd be a
[17:29] 20 bill in my hand
[17:32] this brother knew we were poor college
[17:34] students or
[17:35] we didn't really have any other jobs you
[17:36] know so he just made an active effort to
[17:38] show his love in that way here's 20
[17:40] bucks for gas i know you guys are
[17:42] driving an hour and a half for an hour
[17:43] and 15 minutes to come to services we
[17:46] appreciate your fellowship we love you
[17:47] guys and we just kind of laugh and joke
[17:49] that this man showed his love with a 20
[17:52] handshake and 20 years later when i
[17:54] talked to this brother he said you guys
[17:56] were such a blessing you young people
[17:57] were such a blessing when you came to
[17:58] our church you sat in the front row you
[18:01] said amen you stood up you clapped you
[18:03] shouted you praised the lord you were
[18:05] such an inspiration
[18:07] to the older generation that you guys
[18:09] helped bring us a revival and so you
[18:11] know when i was younger in college i
[18:13] didn't know i was bringing a revival i
[18:14] didn't know i was a breath of fresh air
[18:16] in the church i was just on fire with
[18:18] the love of god i knew jesus loved me he
[18:20] forgive me my sins i love this message i
[18:22] knew the water baptism in the name of
[18:24] the lord jesus christ was right that's
[18:25] about all i knew at that time but i was
[18:27] just in love with god i was in love with
[18:29] the bible and that goes to show like the
[18:31] love of god is like a fire in your heart
[18:33] right and if somebody else is cooling
[18:35] down you know just put your fire with
[18:36] their fire their lick of fire and it
[18:38] will stir everybody up and bring a
[18:40] revival so that's really what brings
[18:41] revival is the love of jesus christ in
[18:43] our hearts
[18:44] now we'd like to share some negative
[18:46] experiences we've had with some who've
[18:48] had a lack of broadly kindness
[18:50] but this is in order to help us examine
[18:52] ourselves so we can be more loving
[18:55] and remember we can learn from both good
[18:56] examples and also bad examples for jesus
[18:59] said remember lot's wife
[19:01] clearly she was a bad example of someone
[19:03] who would look back to the world and
[19:05] miss the world but jesus said we can
[19:07] learn from that
[19:08] so we've all got to learn how to
[19:10] overcome times when we felt a lack of
[19:12] brotherly kindness and then take the
[19:14] initiative to express and show love to
[19:16] others who might not be very easy to
[19:18] love
[19:19] but as brother rahm said if we have the
[19:21] love of jesus christ we should be able
[19:22] to love even the unlovable
[19:25] can i bring some um some of my
[19:27] experiences that i've had with this
[19:29] um
[19:30] the reason why i wanted to do this
[19:32] podcast
[19:33] about this topic was because i just felt
[19:35] like we went to matches some message
[19:37] churches that we've never gone to and
[19:40] i'm not going to say which church it was
[19:42] but it was a really big church and
[19:44] my wife and i we went there and no one
[19:46] greeted us no deacon nobody from the
[19:49] door
[19:50] holding the door open no one greeted us
[19:52] and
[19:53] it was the most saddest thing i've ever
[19:55] felt even before service and after
[19:57] service no one ever said a thing to us
[20:00] but yet the service was anointed it was
[20:03] wonderful worship wonderful sermon
[20:05] everything was great but there was no
[20:07] fellowship no love it's like everyone
[20:09] else had their own their own clique
[20:11] their own people to go to and no one
[20:14] bothered saying hi to us that really
[20:16] hurted our feelings we're like i thought
[20:18] we were all brothers and sisters i
[20:19] thought we all loved god
[20:21] so why isn't anyone showing love to
[20:23] people who never came to this church
[20:25] before
[20:26] most recently we went to a wedding
[20:29] and my wife was telling me the most i
[20:31] want to say troubling but disheartening
[20:34] experience she had was she went up to
[20:37] they were before the wedding was going
[20:38] on she went to go use the restroom and
[20:41] she met a sister there and she just went
[20:43] up there and gave her the best christian
[20:45] greeting you can give up give a sister
[20:47] you know
[20:48] you know introduce yourself be really
[20:50] nice and give them a hug love them and
[20:53] that lady respondus is like
[20:55] who are you do i know you
[20:58] and that really hurt my wife
[21:00] because i thought we were all brothers
[21:02] and sisters in christ you know soon we
[21:04] just
[21:05] you know have a common ground where we
[21:06] can just love each other even though
[21:08] we're strangers
[21:09] you know why are why do we have to be
[21:11] treated in such a way where if we don't
[21:13] know each other then we shouldn't talk
[21:16] or
[21:17] you know we should feel like we're left
[21:19] out because
[21:20] we're not part of your church or
[21:21] anything yeah concerning that story
[21:23] about the big church that's an example
[21:25] of how even denominational churches can
[21:27] show some form of love better than some
[21:30] message churches that's so true
[21:32] i mean the last denomination church we
[21:34] went to go visit they had so much love
[21:36] for us
[21:37] a lot of love a little surprising that
[21:39] they loved us so much compared to some
[21:41] of the message churches we've been to
[21:43] yeah it's really surprising so it just
[21:45] makes you wonder what happened to this
[21:46] message church
[21:48] what happened over the course of the
[21:49] decades of their ministry what has
[21:51] happened where they don't even feel
[21:53] enough love of god to greet people at
[21:55] the door thank them for coming offer to
[21:57] take them out to eat
[21:59] and so it's something that we can learn
[22:01] from you know we can learn from good
[22:02] examples we can also learn from bad
[22:04] examples and so in this case we can
[22:06] learn out our church to always greet
[22:09] and love the visitors clap for them make
[22:12] them feel at home offer them free books
[22:14] and sermons of brother branham anything
[22:16] we can possibly give them we can invite
[22:18] them out to lunch
[22:20] so these are things that we see and we
[22:21] can see how the love of god is lacking
[22:23] in some ways
[22:25] and we want to be able to learn how we
[22:27] can love better from these situations
[22:30] so it makes me think like i know that we
[22:32] shouldn't be numbering people or
[22:33] counting people like
[22:35] to see who who has god or not you know
[22:37] but
[22:38] i kind of see like makes me really
[22:40] wonder like do these people really have
[22:42] like the holy ghost or like are they
[22:44] born again
[22:45] because in the statue of perfect man
[22:48] barley kindness is right under there and
[22:51] love is on top the capping stone of it
[22:53] all you know what's what's missing
[22:56] in their life are they not born again
[22:58] they say at least have some kind of
[22:59] degree of love for another or love for
[23:02] our brethren unless they have a really
[23:04] deep complex that they're still trying
[23:06] to go through
[23:07] that i mean that's the only thing i can
[23:08] think of you know absolutely brother
[23:10] that's it's either one or the other
[23:12] either they have reach brotherly
[23:14] kindness and they have the anointing of
[23:16] brotherly kindness and brotherly love
[23:18] but at that particular moment when we
[23:20] meet people they're going through
[23:21] struggles you know they're having mind
[23:23] battles they're in a deep complex and
[23:26] they're not able to express it or the
[23:28] other explanation is they've not reached
[23:30] broadly kindness yet maybe they're at
[23:32] faith virtue knowledge
[23:34] temperance patience but for sure if
[23:36] they're not able to express love they
[23:38] don't have the anointing of brotherly
[23:39] kindness now remember there's also the
[23:41] other option if someone isn't loving
[23:44] they could reach out and then apologize
[23:45] later and come back and say you know i'm
[23:47] sorry i wasn't loving but if they don't
[23:49] have your phone number or something like
[23:50] that they couldn't do it so maybe the
[23:51] next time we see them maybe they would
[23:53] express more love or say i'm sorry i
[23:54] wasn't loving
[23:56] i recently had that i had a brother send
[23:58] some really harsh texts to me some of
[24:00] the harshest texts i've ever received in
[24:02] my life i didn't know what to do so i
[24:04] just waited on it a week later we had a
[24:06] preacher come in from south carolina and
[24:07] he said sometimes god takes people out
[24:10] of your lives and they reject you
[24:12] and you just got to let them go
[24:14] i knew it was god talking to me i wept
[24:16] at the altar i was asked for prayer a
[24:18] month and a half later this brother
[24:20] texts me and says i'm sorry i said such
[24:22] harsh words
[24:23] god has convicted me of that i'm now
[24:26] delivered from my critical spirit
[24:28] and so i just praise the lord in that
[24:30] and it shows with each and every
[24:31] situation we got to take it to god in
[24:32] prayer wait upon the lord i mean i was
[24:35] tempted to text right back and say fine
[24:37] if you want to do this and that that
[24:39] i was tempted to get in the flesh and
[24:42] not show love but through the preaching
[24:44] of the word through waiting and
[24:46] learning and growing as a christian i
[24:48] learned to just wait on god and then
[24:50] jesus worked it out we're on good terms
[24:51] again but i told the brother i said i
[24:54] may i might feel a little nervous around
[24:55] you next time i see you
[24:57] but i appreciate your humility i said we
[25:00] all need the blood of jesus christ and
[25:01] we're all trusting in the blood of jesus
[25:03] christ i make mistakes we all make
[25:04] mistakes
[25:05] but that was a good example of how a man
[25:08] who i believe has the holy ghost can get
[25:10] a critical spirit sound very unloving
[25:13] and make it seem like he didn't have
[25:15] early kindness but then a month and a
[25:16] half later the spirit of god corrects
[25:18] him
[25:19] brings him back into
[25:20] fellowship with the holy spirit and now
[25:22] restores our fellowship so this proves
[25:25] here this man did have brotherly
[25:27] kindness but just some cares of life
[25:29] perhaps or some complexes came up in his
[25:32] heart and mind
[25:33] but now the spirit has brought him back
[25:34] into fellowship
[25:35] i know god's been telling me sometimes i
[25:37] get too judgmental at times where i
[25:40] am pretty judgmental against another
[25:42] church because of their lack of love and
[25:44] god will always tell me and my wife will
[25:47] always tell me instead of saying that
[25:48] why don't you just pray for them
[25:50] and i get convicted of that all the time
[25:52] that i shouldn't
[25:54] be the one to judge people but i should
[25:55] just pray for them that god would move
[25:58] in their lives and god would forgive
[26:00] them and god would restore the love in
[26:02] their lives and he could do the same for
[26:04] us all the time too that's something i
[26:06] think every honest christian would admit
[26:08] to
[26:09] you know again if we don't struggle with
[26:10] lust of the eyes and lust of the flesh
[26:12] well then the area we're going to battle
[26:14] the most is pride of life i think you
[26:15] see that in brother graham's life as
[26:17] well
[26:18] it seems pride of life was the area
[26:19] brother rams struggle with most and four
[26:22] examples come to my mind on november 14
[26:25] 1953 brother brahm said he contacted
[26:28] amoebas because he left god's perfect
[26:30] will in south africa by accepting the
[26:33] itinerary of the denominational
[26:35] ministers rather than obeying the lord's
[26:37] itinerary so when brother ram disobeyed
[26:40] the lord's itinerary was that lust of
[26:42] the flesh lust of the eyes or pride of
[26:44] life that would have been pride of life
[26:46] a second example was from october 3rd
[26:48] 1954 brother ram said he developed a
[26:51] critical spirit and he said quote it
[26:53] haunts me end quote
[26:55] so a critical spirit would be under the
[26:57] pride of life
[26:58] it wouldn't be lust of the eyes or lust
[27:00] of the flesh
[27:01] third examples from june 23 1963 from
[27:04] the sermon standing in the gap
[27:06] this whole sermon is about brother
[27:08] abraham's battle with a spiritual
[27:09] complex
[27:11] he admitted he had a complex of not
[27:12] wanting to go preach to groups that
[27:14] wouldn't obey the word he'd already
[27:16] preached to them and he said he had lost
[27:18] the feeling of the people like moses
[27:20] lost his feeling for the people so again
[27:22] that has to be pride of life
[27:24] and the final example on july 24 1963
[27:28] brother ram told god you owe me an
[27:30] understanding when god took home a young
[27:33] mother when brother ram thought she was
[27:35] going to live and then brother ram said
[27:37] god left him sitting alone so again that
[27:39] had to be pride of life
[27:41] because that wasn't the lust of the eyes
[27:42] or lust of the flesh
[27:44] and remember you know brotherly kindness
[27:46] is the last character quality god gives
[27:48] a christian before he's born again and
[27:51] brings him into the family of god
[27:53] it's as if god is saying i've graciously
[27:55] built you up into a godly spiritual
[27:57] being but before i officially adopt you
[28:00] into my family by the sea of the holy
[28:02] ghost i'm going to give you broadly
[28:04] kindness so you'll serve and love my
[28:07] other children that i've adopted in
[28:09] other words it's like god gives you that
[28:10] last anointing to make sure you're going
[28:12] to treat his body well so we're all
[28:14] learning we're all growing in the grace
[28:15] and knowledge of the lord and so we're
[28:17] just trusting in god that will express
[28:19] divine love and broadly kindness to
[28:22] message people to non-message peoples
[28:24] sinners saints everyone that we come in
[28:27] contact with because as jesus said this
[28:29] proves we're his children because god is
[28:31] good to the just and the unjust he sends
[28:34] his reign upon the just and the unjust
[28:36] and so we want to be just like our
[28:37] heavenly father i know we talked about
[28:39] this um recently but what do you think
[28:41] about like
[28:42] guest preachers who come preach the word
[28:44] but then yet they don't want to listen
[28:46] to any saints
[28:48] when they come to fellowship time
[28:50] because i know i had that experience
[28:52] quite a few times when we had guest
[28:53] preachers come
[28:55] and great sermon wonderful sermon on a
[28:57] full anointing but when we go to do
[29:00] fellowships they don't want to talk
[29:01] about the word they don't want to listen
[29:04] to anybody tell their testimony or have
[29:07] anything to do with that have any any
[29:09] input on that
[29:10] yeah i would think you know i've just
[29:11] done a little bit evangelism myself
[29:13] before i was pastor i would feel like uh
[29:15] if a man
[29:17] was like that it's probably one of two
[29:19] things have happened he's either been
[29:20] hurt in the past by fellowshipping with
[29:22] people and they've maybe criticized him
[29:24] and so he has built up a complex and
[29:26] he's cut himself off from that
[29:28] fellowship and he doesn't want to put
[29:29] himself out there because he he doesn't
[29:31] want to get hurt again i would say that
[29:33] because really the bible says ministers
[29:35] are servants preachers are servants
[29:37] we're supposed to serve the people you
[29:40] know that we're preaching to and help
[29:41] them out and try to encourage them and
[29:44] the bible says to humble ourselves and
[29:46] to go amongst brothers who are least
[29:47] esteemed so as ministers we need to find
[29:49] the people that are least esteemed go to
[29:51] them help them out give them a word of
[29:53] courage
[29:54] be a blessing to them but then the other
[29:56] side might be the preacher might not be
[29:57] born again i mean judas hung around in
[30:00] justification and sanctification for
[30:01] three and a half years and on the night
[30:04] of the last supper
[30:06] no one knew that judas was going to
[30:07] betray them at the beginning he lived
[30:09] such a good life but then at some point
[30:10] he started getting the love of money in
[30:12] there and he lost his anointing he lost
[30:14] his his christian virtue as we know you
[30:16] can lose it before you're born again
[30:18] so that could be the case as well
[30:19] brother might not be born again so maybe
[30:22] he doesn't have the love of jesus christ
[30:24] in his heart to be able to humble
[30:25] himself and condescend to men of lowered
[30:28] estate as the scripture says so i think
[30:30] one of the biggest issues is pride as
[30:32] you said brother and pride is
[30:34] self-confidence thinking so high of
[30:36] yourself well that's the opposite of
[30:38] humility humility is thinking lower of
[30:40] yourself and the bible says be clothed
[30:43] with humility so it's something you have
[30:45] to actively put on in your mind you have
[30:47] to actively say lord anoint me with
[30:49] humility
[30:50] so i think other people are more
[30:52] important than me and so that when i
[30:54] come into a church service or i come
[30:56] into a fellowship
[30:57] i see myself as a servant not the one to
[31:00] be served but the one to serve others
[31:02] and meet other people's needs but it's a
[31:04] difficult thing it's a battle and we've
[31:06] got to put that on we've got to humble
[31:09] ourselves and become a servant to other
[31:11] people
[31:12] and actually a third reason a preacher
[31:14] may not talk with other saints is
[31:15] because maybe
[31:16] he's just shy and doesn't have a lot to
[31:19] say or maybe he hasn't learned yet how
[31:21] to reach out to others start
[31:22] conversations and be loving and friendly
[31:26] i'm a scripture that's not quite exactly
[31:28] aligned with loving loving but it's
[31:30] something that god's been helping me
[31:32] with for the past month
[31:34] it's as he would that meant should do
[31:36] unto you
[31:37] do ye also to them likewise luke 6 31
[31:41] god's been reminding me
[31:43] the golden rule is we have to if we want
[31:46] someone to love us the way we want to be
[31:48] loved then we should go love other
[31:49] people just do it because you want that
[31:52] kind of experience back that's right god
[31:54] is a rewarder of them that diligently
[31:56] seek him and the bible gives that that
[31:58] law that whatever a man sows that will
[32:01] he reap and so the golden rule is such a
[32:03] beautiful
[32:04] rule to live by right if we want to reap
[32:06] people being kind to us then we need to
[32:08] be kind to other people that's what
[32:10] brother branham said as well but ram
[32:12] said if you want people to say good
[32:13] things about you say good things about
[32:15] them that's that law of reaping and
[32:17] sewing beautiful lesson
[32:19] here's just my observation i think just
[32:21] sometimes
[32:22] there are people in message churches
[32:25] that
[32:26] who were born in the message
[32:28] but yet they have not experienced the
[32:30] love of god in their lives and they were
[32:32] so swayed by the world where it lists
[32:35] looks so
[32:36] tempting for themselves to get up and
[32:38] leave and i know that people who are
[32:39] outside of the world or who are born in
[32:42] the world come into the message they
[32:44] just love god so much more because
[32:46] they never experienced god like this
[32:48] before
[32:50] and they're willing to let go of
[32:51] everything
[32:53] yeah that's beautiful that reminds me of
[32:54] the story of jesus at the house of simon
[32:58] when the woman came in and all the
[33:00] pharisees were criticizing jesus for
[33:02] letting this woman wash his feet and
[33:04] then jesus forgave the woman
[33:06] and he asked simon who would love me the
[33:08] most and jesus said she that's forgiven
[33:11] much loveth much
[33:13] and so i've seen that same thing too
[33:14] brother a lot of people that
[33:16] were not raising the message they
[33:17] experienced jesus christ powerfully when
[33:19] they come in because they're actually
[33:21] choosing to come into the message
[33:23] they're choosing to forsake everything
[33:25] and they experience jesus's love and
[33:28] victory and deliverance and so they
[33:30] truly love god and they love to raise
[33:32] their hands they love to sing and cry
[33:34] and pray and worship and say amen to the
[33:37] word of god
[33:38] now the other side that's dangerous is
[33:39] those who are raised in the message if
[33:42] they never have a true experience with
[33:44] christ true repentance and experience
[33:46] that genuine forgiveness and they're
[33:48] just hanging in church just for the sake
[33:50] of being religious or out of fear uh
[33:53] thinking that well people are going to
[33:54] think i'm backslid if i leave the church
[33:56] they never have a true experience
[33:58] whether it's repentance or
[34:00] sanctification
[34:01] so i've seen the same thing and so when
[34:03] we see those things we've got to talk
[34:05] about those things we've got to pray for
[34:06] the people that they have a real
[34:08] experience with god because if they ever
[34:10] meet jesus christ and jesus christ
[34:12] forgives them of their sins they'll love
[34:14] jesus christ like we love jesus christ
[34:16] i'm really concerned for
[34:18] the youth and the young generation i've
[34:20] been talking to um someone young and
[34:23] they made a mention that they know some
[34:25] friends inside message churches that say
[34:27] they don't even know if god's real
[34:29] and they go to message churches and
[34:32] it's kind of like a routine for them
[34:34] it's just they go because their parents
[34:35] go and i don't know they just don't love
[34:38] god the way
[34:39] they ought to or they don't know god in
[34:41] a way in a deep relationship
[34:43] yeah that's a serious concern i mean it
[34:45] could be one of two things it could be
[34:46] either their fault because they're not
[34:48] listening to their parents and the
[34:50] preacher
[34:51] and perhaps they're the ones that are
[34:52] not seeking after god so god isn't real
[34:54] to them or it could be the fault of the
[34:56] leadership maybe the pastor is not born
[34:58] again maybe their parents aren't born
[35:00] again so again these are really
[35:02] serious cases these are burdens on our
[35:05] hearts because we have the love of god
[35:07] just like i'm sure our listeners many of
[35:09] our listeners have the same love of god
[35:11] they wonder where is the love of god how
[35:12] come there's not more love in the messes
[35:14] churches how come there's not more young
[35:16] people really seeking the lord and
[35:18] confessing their sins and really
[35:20] enjoying worship and just coming to the
[35:22] house of god and being in the presence
[35:23] of god
[35:24] and the answer is because of iniquity
[35:26] iniquity when people know
[35:29] to do right but they fail to do right
[35:31] and it basically comes down to each
[35:32] individual's choice you know is that
[35:33] person going to repent of their sins
[35:35] experience the cross
[35:37] and the resurrection power of the lord
[35:39] jesus christ for themselves or not so
[35:41] our prayer is that they'll do that
[35:42] they'll experience jesus's love
[35:44] can we kind of go in the opposite of
[35:46] that direction so
[35:47] my wife and i we went to the store
[35:49] earlier today and we saw they were
[35:51] celebrating pride day
[35:54] and their big statement is
[35:56] to love we love one another or
[36:00] everyone has to love one another
[36:01] something around that line and they're
[36:03] just pretty much stealing off from the
[36:05] bible
[36:06] saying oh we we have to love one another
[36:08] because of our differences do you want
[36:10] to make any mention on that that's a
[36:12] great question brother so obviously
[36:14] pride month or pride day or pride month
[36:16] is supporting homosexuality
[36:17] transgenderism all these things
[36:19] now we don't judge their eternal
[36:21] destinations that's only up to god but
[36:22] we are called to judge fruits jesus said
[36:25] we have to take the plank out of our eye
[36:27] first and then we can judge other
[36:28] people's situations and again we never
[36:31] judge their eternal destinations but we
[36:33] do warn them that their eternal
[36:35] destination will be held in the lake of
[36:37] fire
[36:38] of course not for eternity but that's
[36:39] the that'll be the place of their
[36:40] torment and punishment if they fail to
[36:42] repent of the truth of god's word so
[36:45] they say we're to love them because
[36:47] they're in sin but they just perverted
[36:49] the meaning of love jesus define love
[36:52] love is to believe god and keep his
[36:54] commandments
[36:55] jesus said if you love me keep my
[36:57] commandments
[36:58] and jesus explained what real love in
[37:00] marriage is he said it's between one man
[37:02] and one woman in matthew chapter 19 i
[37:05] believe in matthew chapter 5
[37:06] as well if i'm not mistaken he said a
[37:08] man shall cleave unto his one wife so
[37:11] jesus said we must go back to the
[37:12] beginning adam and eve male and female
[37:14] one male one female that's real marriage
[37:17] and then remember romans chapter one
[37:19] says it actually speaks of homosexuals
[37:21] and says they're actually haters of god
[37:23] they hate the knowledge of god because
[37:25] they've changed the use of their body
[37:27] parts that god gave them god gave them
[37:29] their reproductive body parts to fit
[37:31] into his system to fulfill the male and
[37:34] female reproductive system that god
[37:36] created and so by defying that they
[37:39] actually hate god they hate to retain
[37:42] god's knowledge in their minds but it's
[37:44] mass behind this oh we love everybody
[37:46] and just love us so it's an act of
[37:48] deception by satan he's cloaking hatred
[37:51] for god with the word love so satan
[37:54] loves to take the scriptures and twist
[37:56] it like he did with jesus he tempted him
[37:58] three times and say he said if you're
[38:00] the son of god cast yourself down and he
[38:01] quoted psalms where the angels of god
[38:03] will catch you but jesus said you shall
[38:04] not tempt the lord your god
[38:06] so he was twisting the scriptures and we
[38:08] know the pope and all these people in
[38:10] the economical movement they're twisting
[38:11] the scriptures where jesus said we must
[38:13] be one well we can't be one unless we
[38:15] have the same doctrine and the same
[38:17] power and the same belief so we will not
[38:19] be one with the roman catholic church
[38:21] because they worship the eucharist
[38:23] and we know the eucharist is not the
[38:24] literal body and blood of the lord so
[38:26] there's another example where satan is
[38:28] twisting the scripture and he's hiding
[38:30] behind this scripture of oh we must all
[38:32] be one and we must all love each other
[38:35] but it's a perverted oneness it's a
[38:36] perverted love it's a lie it's not the
[38:39] truth and what it comes down to is they
[38:40] worship the creation instead of the
[38:42] creator if you worship the creator you
[38:45] worship god's word or the creator's word
[38:48] and you obey him and you love him
[38:55] now let's look at five simple concrete
[38:57] ways a christian can show love to the
[38:59] saints in his or her home church
[39:02] as i was preparing for this podcast i
[39:03] was reminded of a portion i wrote on
[39:05] barley kindness in my 2021 book and and
[39:08] i showed there's five ways a christian
[39:11] should show love to his christian church
[39:13] or his home church or his real family
[39:15] we'd say the spiritual family of the
[39:17] body of jesus christ first brotherly
[39:19] kindness moves believers to meet the
[39:21] physical needs of other christians like
[39:23] james says you have dead faith if you
[39:25] tell a brother who's cold well i hope
[39:26] you get warm real faith will get him a
[39:29] coat real faith will get him some food
[39:31] if he's hungry second brother kindness
[39:33] promotes radical forgiveness towards
[39:36] fellow christians jesus told peter
[39:38] forgive them 70 times seven not just
[39:40] seven times but 490 times we should
[39:43] forgive our brothers
[39:45] paul told philemon put onesimus's debt
[39:48] on my account in other words i'll pay
[39:50] off the brother's debt even though he
[39:51] was your slave and he owes you money or
[39:53] put that debt on my account and i'll pay
[39:55] it off that's radical forgiveness you
[39:57] don't see that kind of forgiveness very
[39:58] often and god always says that you
[40:00] should love your enemies how much more
[40:02] so we love our brothers
[40:04] thirdly we can show love for our family
[40:06] by gathering with christians more as we
[40:09] see that day approaching according to
[40:10] hebrews 10 verses 24 and 25. i told
[40:14] brother amen this before but as soon as
[40:15] i see brother amen something jumps in my
[40:17] heart whether it's sunday or saturday
[40:19] i'm like praise god i haven't seen him
[40:21] all week i just i just want to go give
[40:22] him a hug and ask him how his week was
[40:24] well that's how it is with every
[40:25] christian i'm just so encouraged every
[40:28] time i see another christian it makes me
[40:30] want to just praise god and be more
[40:32] dedicated to jesus and live for them as
[40:35] pastor i'm supposed to i'm supposed to
[40:36] feed them and shepherd them and do the
[40:38] best i can to watch over their souls but
[40:40] just the reality of seeing another
[40:41] christian should make us fall more in
[40:43] love with them and want to see them more
[40:44] often by the grace of god
[40:46] fourth christians should offer broadly
[40:48] kindness with impartiality regarding
[40:52] anyone's socio-economic status
[40:55] so no matter whether a christian is rich
[40:57] or poor believers should love each other
[40:59] the same james talks about that again we
[41:01] shouldn't give a better seat in the
[41:03] church to a rich person and tell the
[41:05] poor person to stand you know there's
[41:07] different people in our church that
[41:08] we've talked to and they used to go to
[41:09] message churches where if you were not
[41:11] rich then you did not fellowship with
[41:14] those message believers so it's sad but
[41:16] the message church was divided based
[41:18] upon
[41:19] socio-economic status the rich only
[41:21] fellowship with the rich and then the
[41:23] rich looked down upon the poor people if
[41:26] you didn't have brand new clothes on
[41:27] every week or if you didn't drive a
[41:29] certain vehicle you were looked down
[41:31] upon those things should not be so in
[41:33] those cases those people that were rich
[41:35] probably weren't born again they
[41:37] probably didn't have brotherly kindness
[41:38] you know we don't know for sure but by
[41:40] their fruits we know them if they carry
[41:42] these type of behaviors on for years and
[41:44] years they either have the most awful
[41:45] complex a real christian could ever have
[41:48] or they don't have the genuine broadly
[41:50] kindness or charity that jesus wants
[41:52] them to have and lastly brother kindness
[41:54] leads christians to pray for one another
[41:57] paul said in ephesians 6 18 praying
[41:59] always with all prayer and supplication
[42:01] in the spirit
[42:02] watching there unto with all
[42:04] perseverance and supplication for all
[42:07] saints it should be our joy to pray for
[42:10] other people we are priests unto god who
[42:12] else do we know in this world that's
[42:14] praying for the war in ukraine to end
[42:16] other than christians who else do we
[42:18] know in this world who's praying for
[42:19] abortion to end in america and around
[42:21] the world except for christians
[42:23] we're a very small group we're going to
[42:25] get smaller and smaller as we see that
[42:26] day approaching
[42:28] but we should pray for sin to end we
[42:30] should also pray for strength for the
[42:31] saints that they'll be strengthened with
[42:33] god's might in their inner man we should
[42:35] pray for those who are suffering from
[42:37] famines pray for the sick and the
[42:39] afflicted we should pray for miracles we
[42:41] should pray for deliverance it's our
[42:43] duty and it also should be our joy to
[42:45] pray for other people as christians i
[42:47] think brother brahms said uh the most
[42:49] important thing you can do is pray out
[42:51] of you know reading your bible and
[42:53] worshiping prayer is the most important
[42:55] thing yeah brother ram said you can
[42:57] worship too much he said you can sing
[42:59] too much read your bible too much he
[43:00] said but you'll never pray too much amen
[43:04] hallelujah
[43:06] let's pray again
[43:08] lord please lord oh i am i saying too
[43:12] much i might preach too much i might
[43:14] shout too much of my cry too much
[43:16] but i'll never pray too much
[43:19] oh
[43:20] god
[43:21] search me and try me
[43:30] so in this last section before we close
[43:32] we want to just show how church
[43:33] discipline is balanced with love how can
[43:35] you be loving and show church discipline
[43:38] this is an important topic as some
[43:40] churches don't have any church
[43:41] discipline but
[43:42] real christians should have church
[43:44] discipline because we know love is
[43:45] corrective in hebrews 12 it talks about
[43:48] every son of god is chastened to the
[43:49] lord and that word actually means to
[43:51] punish or to spank or to hit in other
[43:54] words god has to give us sometimes
[43:55] spiritual spankings to get us back in
[43:58] line and jesus talked about it in
[43:59] matthew 18 about church discipline
[44:02] and so there's numerous scriptures in
[44:03] the bible that talk about how church
[44:06] discipline must be carried out but it's
[44:08] the love of god carrying out church
[44:10] discipline it's the love of god cleaning
[44:12] out the church
[44:13] what do you think about people going up
[44:15] to other brothers and telling them
[44:17] oh god you shouldn't be doing this
[44:19] because it's in the word do you think
[44:20] that's right of a brother to go do that
[44:22] or is
[44:23] would that be their responsibility to go
[44:26] and tell the brother that they're in the
[44:28] wrong or should we just leave that up to
[44:30] god that he would be the one doing it
[44:32] maybe like behind the pulpit or
[44:33] something that's a great question
[44:34] brother as long as he's in the right
[44:36] spirit galatians 6 verses 1 and 2 tells
[44:38] us that it actually tells us if you see
[44:41] a brother overtaken in a fault then the
[44:43] bible says you which are spiritual go to
[44:45] that person and try to bring
[44:46] reconciliation so as long as that
[44:48] brother has or sister you know has the
[44:50] right approach and there's a love of god
[44:53] in their heart trying to bring
[44:53] correction that that's something they
[44:55] should do one-on-one
[44:57] and that could also manifest brother a
[44:58] gift of the holy spirit so that person
[45:00] might have the gift of discernment god
[45:02] might let them know the secrets or the
[45:04] thoughts intents of that person's heart
[45:06] in order to correct them or they might
[45:08] had a dream about it which could be
[45:09] another form of prophecy or a warning
[45:12] coming through a prophecy that if this
[45:13] person doesn't repent
[45:15] they might have to suffer some
[45:16] consequences could be a gift of
[45:18] knowledge god gives them a scripture of
[45:20] knowledge about the word that they need
[45:22] to help them overcome as well yeah the
[45:24] love of god tells us to mark them that
[45:27] cause divisions in romans 16 verse 17
[45:30] and avoid them so when we see preachers
[45:32] or individuals who are causing divisions
[45:35] in churches
[45:36] or preaching false doctrine we're to
[45:39] mark them amongst our brethren that
[45:41] means point them out and avoid them and
[45:43] so that is the love of jesus christ
[45:45] keeping the saints united and keeping
[45:47] the leaven out of the church
[45:49] there's other scripture like in first
[45:51] corinthians five and six i believe it is
[45:52] the bible says you shouldn't even eat
[45:54] with a fornicator who says they're a
[45:56] brother because the bible says when you
[45:58] do that when you won't have fellowship
[45:59] with them that makes them ashamed and
[46:01] that will make them want to live right
[46:03] and come back and serve god repent to
[46:05] their fornication so they can have
[46:07] fellowship with the saints again and
[46:08] then also the bible says in
[46:10] thessalonians if a man doesn't work he
[46:12] shouldn't eat well some people are so
[46:15] deceived you know they'll let homeless
[46:16] people or anybody just come to church
[46:18] and keep feeding them but if they have
[46:20] the ability to work and they don't work
[46:22] and they claim to be a part of the
[46:23] church or claim to be a christian we
[46:25] shouldn't feed them
[46:26] that's a hard thing to say but paul saw
[46:29] it was a problem in the church at
[46:30] thessalonica and the only way that love
[46:34] would correct that is to say i'm not
[46:35] going to give you food unless you work
[46:38] because you're just being a busybody
[46:39] you're wasting your time you're not
[46:41] carrying your your weight so i have a
[46:43] scripture i like your opinion on it it
[46:45] says if a man say i love god and hate of
[46:47] his brother he is a liar for he have not
[46:49] the love of his brother
[46:51] if he that loveth not his brother whom
[46:54] he have seen how can he love god whom he
[46:56] has not seen i was just wondering you
[46:58] know if
[46:59] if we have people in our our churches
[47:02] that cause division
[47:04] or intentionally do something wrong
[47:06] against our brother how would you handle
[47:08] that in the church
[47:10] that's a great question you know jesus
[47:12] told us within a church in matthew 18 he
[47:14] says if someone sinned against you i
[47:16] think it's 1815.
[47:18] he said go to that person one on one if
[47:20] they hear you you've gained your brother
[47:23] if not take a witness with you
[47:25] and then if they hear you you've gained
[47:27] the brother because in the mouth of two
[47:28] or three witnesses let every word be
[47:30] established the third time
[47:33] if you go and he doesn't hear you then
[47:35] let the man be as a sinner and
[47:37] republican unto you in other words avoid
[47:39] them and that's church discipline
[47:41] they're according to the lord jesus
[47:43] christ
[47:44] what if it's like a pastor
[47:46] that's like that that's a good question
[47:48] you know so it seems like a pastor could
[47:50] be corrected in one of two ways so first
[47:52] if he personally offended you as a
[47:54] brother maybe not behind the pulpit and
[47:56] it wasn't a public sin then you would go
[47:58] to him one on one
[48:00] like matthew 18 15 says
[48:02] but then second if he sinned in front of
[48:04] the whole church or out in public in
[48:05] front of many witnesses then the
[48:07] scripture says against an elder receive
[48:09] not an accusation except in the mouth of
[48:11] two or three witnesses so you kind of
[48:13] have to see which case it was was it a
[48:15] case where the pastor offended you
[48:17] privately one on one
[48:19] or did the pastor sin publicly
[48:21] and therefore needs to repent publicly
[48:24] paul says if you have an accusation
[48:25] against them an elder you have to have
[48:27] two or three witnesses and go to the
[48:28] pastor that way so again you go the same
[48:30] way you go one on one to the pastor if
[48:33] you don't receive you then you have to
[48:34] take a witness with you if you don't
[48:36] have a witness you just got to pray for
[48:37] that person and you have to trust god
[48:39] that in time god will bring correction
[48:40] to that man
[48:42] in a couple different ways
[48:44] either in his own private life the holy
[48:46] spirit will convict him of that he'll
[48:47] repent and come to you and apologize
[48:49] or
[48:50] if he doesn't repent of that that sin
[48:52] can only grow it's like leaven it's just
[48:54] going to get more and more sinful all
[48:55] the time and then he'll be exposed in
[48:57] another area of his life
[48:59] or maybe there you'll talk to somebody
[49:01] and they'll have a witness against him
[49:03] doing the same thing then you would have
[49:05] two witnesses but that's really the way
[49:07] to do church order brother is as how
[49:09] jesus said love makes you go to the
[49:11] person who's offended you
[49:14] love makes you cast your cares on the
[49:15] lord well one way to do that is to
[49:17] follow jesus's words and go to that
[49:19] person and try to be reconciled that's
[49:21] the real spirit of christ is
[49:22] reconciliation
[49:29] in closing we just want to encourage you
[49:31] guys to continue to love one another to
[49:33] love your church
[49:35] and even if you don't feel love at your
[49:36] church you should take courage and try
[49:39] to be the first one to show love it
[49:41] takes a friend to make a friend you know
[49:43] so in the same case you know if you want
[49:45] to be loved go love someone at your
[49:47] church that's beautiful brother we need
[49:49] to take initiative we can't wait for
[49:51] other people to love us if we have the
[49:52] love of jesus christ in our hearts we
[49:54] gotta go love them first i think i'd
[49:56] like to end with this beautiful quote
[49:57] from brother branham where brother ram
[49:58] says
[49:59] even if we bitterly disagree with our
[50:01] brother and our brother would cut us up
[50:03] and down about how we're wrong
[50:06] afterwards we should still be able to
[50:08] put our arms around that brother and
[50:10] love him and brother brahm said i love
[50:11] it he said and think just as highly
[50:14] about that person as christ does well
[50:16] how much does christ think about that
[50:18] person he thinks immensely about that
[50:20] person because he gave his life for that
[50:22] person on the cross
[50:24] god proved his love to us through the
[50:27] death of jesus christ on the cross
[50:30] you don't want to get like uh oswald see
[50:33] if you can't disagree with a man and
[50:34] things then shake his hand and still
[50:36] have the same feelings towards him
[50:38] then there's something wrong with you
[50:40] if i can't disagree with the man
[50:42] bitterly from one side to the other and
[50:44] still think as much of him as as christ
[50:46] would then there's something wrong with
[50:48] my spirit
[50:49] i haven't the spirit of christ
[50:52] if he says well brother adam i believe
[50:54] that you are teaching is this uh all
[50:56] right brother let's come together to
[50:58] reason you and i we'll take it ourselves
[51:00] we'll go over here in the room to
[51:01] ourselves we'll reason out and he just
[51:03] cuts me to pieces now i have to say
[51:05] things back to him if in my heart i
[51:07] can't feel the same about him and he's
[51:08] still my brother and i'm trying to help
[51:10] him then i'll never help him
[51:13] there's no way for me to help him if i
[51:15] don't love him what's used to going over
[51:16] there
[51:17] telling the first place first brother i
[51:19] don't love you and let me get that out
[51:20] of my heart right here before we go in
[51:22] there because i can't help you until i
[51:23] love you
