[0:02] let us who father and son trinitarianism
[0:08] is of the
[0:09] devil I say that thus sayeth the Lord
[0:13] amen look where it come
[0:15] from greetings friends in the matchless
[0:18] name of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[0:20] purpose of this video is to answer a
[0:22] question I received does Genesis 1: 26
[0:26] prove God is three persons because it
[0:28] says let us make man in our image this
[0:32] is an excellent godhead question and of
[0:34] course the answer is no the use of the
[0:36] plural pronoun us does not prove God is
[0:39] three persons in Genesis 1:26 and this
[0:42] video will prove that by the Bible and
[0:44] by quotes from God's Prophet brother
[0:45] William Brenham hi friends I'm Jesse
[0:48] Smith pastor bride of Christ Fellowship
[0:49] here in akan Ohio USA and I defend the
[0:52] original Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ
[0:54] that he revealed to St Paul then had to
[0:56] restore through Martin Luther John
[0:58] Wesley and the late Prophet brother
[1:00] William Marin brandham who lived from
[1:01] 1909 to 1965 I also defend brother
[1:04] bram's Godly Christian character
[1:06] trinitarians often use Genesis 1:26 and
[1:09] Matthew 3 which is the story of Jesus's
[1:12] baptism to prove God is three persons
[1:15] but that's
[1:16] wrong and these trinitarians fail to
[1:19] admit that they add words to the Bible
[1:22] the words three persons are not even in
[1:24] the Holy Scripture so trinitarians
[1:27] whether aware of it or not are sinfully
[1:31] adding to the Bible and there's great
[1:33] warnings about adding to the Bible in
[1:35] Proverbs 30: 5 and 6 add thou not unto
[1:38] God's words lest thou be found a liar
[1:41] and Revelation 22:18 and 19 we should
[1:44] not take away from the word of God nor
[1:46] add to the word of God because there are
[1:48] grave consequences for doing so
[1:50] trinitarians fail to recognize God's
[1:52] multiple manifestations and God's
[1:55] multiple manifestations do not equal
[1:57] multiple personalities if multiple
[2:00] manifestations equal personalities then
[2:03] the Holy Ghost is at least 120 different
[2:06] persons because he appeared as a lick of
[2:09] fire above 120 different persons in the
[2:12] upper room and so this example relates
[2:14] to Jesus's baptism just because there
[2:16] was three manifestations a voice from
[2:18] Heaven Jesus the son in the water and
[2:21] the Holy Spirit descending like a dove
[2:23] those three manifestations do not prove
[2:25] God is three persons and friends as most
[2:27] of us know trinitarianism is simply
[2:30] polytheism and tritheism rebranded as I
[2:33] wrote in my 2021 book The 12 New
[2:35] Testament Mysteries nearly 5,000 years
[2:37] ago samarians worshiped a Triad of
[2:40] deities Anu enlil and
[2:44] eia then in the New Kingdom Egyptian age
[2:48] from around 1500 to 1,000 BC worship was
[2:51] given to a Triad of gods Osirus Isis and
[2:56] Horus there's many more examples of a
[2:59] tribe ad of deities from the pagans but
[3:02] I'm not going to go through them here's
[3:04] the outline for the rest of the video
[3:06] friends we'll look at first reviewing
[3:07] the nine proofs the Trinity is false
[3:09] Doctrine or heresy including its origin
[3:13] beginning around 180 ad and moving up to
[3:16] 381
[3:18] ad then we'll examine Genesis
[3:21] 1:26 after that we'll look at the
[3:22] mystery of plural
[3:24] pronouns and then look at a few quotes
[3:26] from God's Prophet brother brandham so
[3:29] let's begin with reviewing the nine
[3:30] proofs the Trinity is heresy or false
[3:34] Doctrine you'll find this on pages
[3:37] 23 through 32 in my 2021 book I'm going
[3:42] to go through these quickly first and
[3:44] the most decimating to its validity the
[3:47] Trinity Dogma adds to the Bible second
[3:50] Jesus and his Apostles taught and
[3:52] affirmed pure Hebrew monotheism rather
[3:54] than
[3:56] trinitarianism third the Athenian Creed
[3:58] or sixth century trinitarian
[4:00] confessional contains multiple
[4:02] contradictions to Biblical teaching on
[4:04] the godhead I list six examples in the
[4:07] book one of which is the shield of the
[4:10] Trinity which contains a blatant lie
[4:12] where it says the father is not the Holy
[4:15] Spirit the father is a spirit According
[4:16] To Jesus in John chapter 4 and the Holy
[4:19] Spirit is a spirit as its name declares
[4:23] so if the holy spirit is not the father
[4:25] then Jesus had two fathers and of course
[4:27] we know that's wrong four fourth major
[4:30] Bible contradictions and inconsistencies
[4:32] exist among
[4:34] trinitarians fifth the early
[4:35] trinitarians did not affirm that the
[4:37] Holy Spirit was divine into the Council
[4:39] of Constantinople in 381 ad so think of
[4:42] that friends the Holy Ghost was not
[4:44] considered Divine in trinitarians Minds
[4:46] until 381 ad nearly 300 years after the
[4:51] final Apostle died St John here's a
[4:54] quick visual regarding water baptism and
[4:56] the godhead the true Apostolic baptism
[4:59] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ was
[5:01] administered by Peter around 30 or 33 ad
[5:05] Paul continued that of course up to 59
[5:08] ad as recorded in scripture in Acts
[5:11] 19:5 and then the enemy began to change
[5:14] baptism from the apostolic baptism to
[5:16] Modern baptism or the Liturgy baptism
[5:20] which is a false baptismal formula of
[5:22] father son holy ghost that was around
[5:24] 100 AD and then around 180 ad Theophilus
[5:28] coined the Greek word
[5:31] Trias shortly after that tertullian
[5:34] coins the Latin word Trinitas so both
[5:37] words mean Trinity then according to the
[5:39] world book from 2003 the so-called three
[5:43] persons were declared as one God at the
[5:45] Council of NAA in 325 ad and again
[5:48] that's not according to me that's
[5:50] according to the World Book 2003 page
[5:54] 447 under the word Trinity so with that
[5:57] visual it's just so simple to see water
[5:59] baptism was changed about 40 years after
[6:03] St Paul used it at Ephesus and then the
[6:06] godhead began being changed about 80
[6:09] years after St John died around 180 ad
[6:14] again proving the Bible authors did not
[6:17] teach three persons the Bible authors
[6:19] never had the idea of three persons in
[6:21] their minds six trinitarian images and
[6:24] artwork are often deceptive creating
[6:26] false representations of the godhead
[6:29] seventh some trinitarians use two fear
[6:32] tactics to persuade others to believe in
[6:34] the Trinity one is heresy the other is
[6:36] hell and eighth and finally God sent a
[6:39] prophet named William brandom to warn
[6:41] Christians about the false Trinity
[6:43] Doctrine so I think I misspoke earlier
[6:45] in the video I think I said there was
[6:47] nine proofs so I'm sorry about that
[6:49] there's eight proofs now let's examine
[6:52] Genesis
[6:54] 1:26 the section I wrote about this is
[6:56] on page 40 in my 2021 book the first
[6:59] thing I mention is that the word make it
[7:01] said let us make and notice there's one
[7:04] maker in the Bible there's not two
[7:06] makers there's not three makers Malachi
[7:09] 2:10 says we have one father one God
[7:11] created us not three persons there's not
[7:14] two creators or three creators there's
[7:16] only one according to Malachi 2:10 and
[7:19] then Isaiah
[7:20] 4424 States thus sayith the Lord thy
[7:23] Redeemer he that formed thee from the
[7:25] womb I am the Lord that maketh all
[7:27] things that stretches forth the heavens
[7:29] alone that spreadeth abroad the Earth by
[7:32] myself so the Lord alone forms humans in
[7:35] the womb he alone stretch out the
[7:37] heavens he makes all things the Lord did
[7:40] this by himself not with two other
[7:43] persons the next point is that there's
[7:46] two possible explanations for the usage
[7:48] of us in Genesis 1:26 the first is God
[7:51] could be referring to himself and the
[7:53] Angelic host because God used Us in the
[7:57] same manner in two other passages
[7:59] Genesis 11:7 and Isaiah
[8:03] 6:8 in Genesis 11: 6-9 the Lord Jehovah
[8:07] says let us go down and there confound
[8:09] their language verses 8 and9 in Genesis
[8:12] 11 say God scattered the men at Babel
[8:15] but it's likely God came with his angels
[8:17] to scatter and confound the men at Babel
[8:19] just as God came with two angels to
[8:21] visit Abraham and lot in Genesis
[8:23] chapters 18 and 19 and remember it's
[8:26] impossible that a threers god visited
[8:28] Babel since the Bible never describes
[8:30] God as three people then in Isaiah 8:
[8:33] 1-8 it's Isaiah's heavenly vision notice
[8:37] Isaiah sees only one person sitting on
[8:39] Heaven's Throne the Lord or Yahweh and
[8:42] then God said whom shall I send and who
[8:44] will go for us so this use of us likely
[8:47] refers to the seraphim and those are the
[8:50] seraphim that Isaiah saw there around
[8:52] the Throne of God now the second
[8:54] possibility for let us in Genesis 1:26
[8:58] is the combined work of of the Father
[9:00] and Son and yet this would not equate to
[9:02] two individual persons this is the view
[9:05] that I hold this is the one I think is
[9:06] the most likely the use of us would
[9:10] coincide with Jesus's usage of us in
[9:13] reference to he and his father in John
[9:16] 17:21 so in the beginning let us means
[9:19] the invisible father used his word which
[9:22] was later acknowledge as Christ in John
[9:24] 1: 1-3 to create man so God used his
[9:29] word to create man and all things and we
[9:32] understand this because you and I use
[9:34] our spoken words to create our daily
[9:36] activities I'm going to go do some
[9:38] errands I'm going to go grocery shopping
[9:39] I'm going to read my Bible I'm going to
[9:41] pray so in the same way the invisible
[9:43] God used his words to create man and all
[9:45] things in the universe this is supported
[9:48] by Ephesians 3:9 God created All Things
[9:51] by Jesus Christ God the one person
[9:54] created by his word he created by
[9:57] speaking the next point is that the
[9:59] Father and Son shared one image not two
[10:02] in Genesis
[10:03] 1:26 and this is because the father is
[10:06] invisible the Bible said Jesus is the
[10:08] image of the invisible God that's in
[10:11] Colossians 1:15 and the Bible said no
[10:14] man has seen the father nor ever can see
[10:16] the Father John 1:18 says no man hath
[10:19] seen God at any time then 1 Timothy 6:16
[10:23] says whom no man hath seen nor can see
[10:26] so the son was the visible image of the
[10:29] invisible father so the Father and Son
[10:31] shared a Celestial visible body and
[10:35] that's just like when God made Adam God
[10:37] made Adam and Eve a spirit first and
[10:40] then they became flesh so the invisible
[10:42] Spirit became visible So based upon that
[10:45] sufficient Bible evidence now we
[10:47] understand Genesis 1:26 is not teaching
[10:49] three persons so now let's go to the
[10:52] mystery of plural pronouns as it relates
[10:54] to the
[10:55] godhead I start this section actually
[10:57] before Genesis 1 126 I start the section
[11:00] on page 37 of the 2021 book now this
[11:03] section is about three and a half pages
[11:05] in my book so I'm just going to hit the
[11:07] highlights here to keep this video a
[11:08] little shorter by the grace of God I can
[11:10] already tell it's getting longer than I
[11:12] anticipated Jesus's usage of first
[11:15] person plural pronouns like we and us
[11:18] when referring to the father is the only
[11:20] remaining godhead mystery John 14:23
[11:24] Jesus says and my father will love him
[11:27] and we will come unto him and make our
[11:29] with him so Jesus uses we a plural
[11:32] pronoun and our a possessive determiner
[11:35] to speak of his and his father's coming
[11:37] to dwell in the man who keeps his words
[11:40] then in John 17:21 Jesus uses us to
[11:43] refer to himself and the father saying
[11:45] that they also may be one in us so why
[11:49] would Jesus use plural pronouns and
[11:51] possessive determiners the best biblical
[11:53] answer is that Jesus was both fully
[11:55] human and fully Divine and because his
[11:58] human side was not Divine therefore he
[12:01] had to use a separate pronoun for his
[12:03] human body his mortal body unlike the
[12:06] immortal father I'm sure we all know the
[12:09] contrast between Jesus's body and the
[12:11] holy spirit inside of him Jesus's human
[12:14] body could die God could never die Jesus
[12:17] human body could be tempted God can
[12:18] never be tempted therefore a separate
[12:21] pronoun was needed for Jesus's human
[12:23] body Jesus's human body was a unique
[12:25] one-of-a-kind human manifestation unlike
[12:28] God's previous manifestations like MDC
[12:31] mzc wasn't born of a woman mzc didn't
[12:33] die a pillar of fire a burning bush a
[12:36] rock in the wilderness a voice in the
[12:38] Whirlwind remember mzc had no mother or
[12:41] father according to Hebrews 7 1-3 but
[12:43] Jesus had a human mother and human
[12:45] father Jesus was born of a woman of
[12:48] course Mary and Joseph were not his
[12:50] literal parents so using plural pronouns
[12:53] shows the difference between Jesus's
[12:55] flesh body and his Immortal invisible
[12:57] Spirit or father God
[12:59] or holy ghost that dwelt inside of him
[13:02] so the use of plural pronouns and
[13:05] possessive determiners does not prove
[13:07] God is multiple persons it proves God
[13:09] can manifest himself in multiple ways it
[13:12] also proves the invisible God can dwell
[13:14] in a visible manifestation and so when
[13:16] God is talking about his invisible
[13:18] spiritual nature and then his body
[13:21] Emmanuel the body of Jesus Christ he
[13:24] uses more than one pronoun because they
[13:26] have different
[13:27] attributes his invisible Spirit has
[13:30] different attributes than the body of
[13:31] Jesus the use of plural pronouns then
[13:34] shows that the invisible God is using
[13:37] his visible
[13:38] manifestations remember friends even a
[13:41] manifestation a light of God a pillar of
[13:43] fire is still a noun it's a person place
[13:47] or thing so we would say like the pillar
[13:49] of fire is a manifestation but that
[13:52] Pillar of Fire necessarily isn't the
[13:54] invisible spirit of God cu the Bible
[13:56] said again in 1 Timothy 6 that God
[13:58] dwells in the light the light is just a
[14:00] manifestation or appearance so the
[14:02] invisible God can dwell in it so God
[14:05] uses plural pronouns to show both the
[14:07] invisible and the visible manifestation
[14:10] are present so the pillar of fire the
[14:13] pillar of light is a thing and therefore
[14:15] it's a noun when you have the invisible
[14:17] spirit of God he's a person a noun needs
[14:19] to describe God and then you have a
[14:21] manifestation that's also a noun you
[14:23] have to use a plural pronoun to describe
[14:26] both like us and we and hour and I
[14:30] understand this could be considered deep
[14:32] to some people but this conclusion about
[14:33] plural pronouns is both scriptural and
[14:36] so much safer reverent and ultimately
[14:39] pleasing to God compared to the sin of
[14:41] adding uninspired words like three
[14:44] persons to God's Eternal inspired
[14:46] inherent word God's not trying to
[14:49] confuse Us by using plural nouns rather
[14:51] he's trying to help us see the necessity
[14:53] of his manifestation In the Flesh the
[14:56] body of Jesus Christ it was only through
[14:59] his son's body God could be seen held
[15:01] and handled because of what John says in
[15:04] 1 John 1: 1 and 2 it says which we have
[15:09] seen with our eyes which we have looked
[15:11] upon and our hands have handled of the
[15:13] word of
[15:14] Life Next let's look at a few quotes
[15:16] from God's Prophet brother
[15:18] brandham the first is from questions and
[15:20] answers on Genesis
[15:22] 1953 here brother Ram says that the let
[15:25] us of Genesis 1:26 is Father and Son so
[15:29] this is the understanding that I hold to
[15:32] let us means the Father and Son it
[15:34] doesn't mean father and Angels but it
[15:35] could mean father and Angels let's
[15:37] listen to the quote you got all those
[15:39] things together made plant made all the
[15:42] other things all the animal life the
[15:44] birds the bees the monkeys and whatever
[15:46] it was put them all here on Earth and
[15:48] then he asked this question now let
[15:53] us who father and son next friends
[15:57] there's at least five quotes where
[15:59] brother Ram says Genesis 1:26 let us is
[16:02] the invisible God working through the
[16:04] logos he says in 1951 he says it three
[16:08] times in 1953 and one time in
[16:10] 1957 we'll just listen to the one from
[16:12] 1957 brother Ram said now the logos went
[16:15] out from God so there you have the
[16:16] invisible God something came out of him
[16:18] that was the logos the visible image of
[16:20] God and he said that's the kind of body
[16:22] that God was the logos for he said let
[16:25] us make man in our image and our
[16:26] likeness and that's how God made Adam
[16:30] God made Adam an invisible Spirit first
[16:32] and then God made a body to put Adam
[16:34] into so invisible becoming visible God
[16:38] did the same for himself and then he did
[16:39] that for Adam as well let's listen to
[16:41] the quote and now the lust that went out
[16:45] of God which was the the logus all this
[16:49] began to form into a a body
[16:52] shape and this body shape was called in
[16:56] the scholars teaching logus
[16:59] the logos that went out of God in other
[17:03] words a a better word for it was a what
[17:06] we call a
[17:08] theoy theoy is a human body that's
[17:12] glorified not exactly with flesh and
[17:15] blood like it will be in its glorified
[17:17] stage but it is the form of a human body
[17:20] that doesn't eat neither does it drink
[17:23] but it's it's a body a body that's
[17:27] waiting for us as soon as we leave this
[17:29] one now in there we enter into that body
[17:33] and that's the kind of body that God was
[17:36] for he said let us make man in our own
[17:41] image and in our
[17:44] likeness now when man become into that
[17:48] body he had control of all the fishes
[17:51] and fowls
[17:53] and in closing friends hope this video
[17:56] was a blessing by the grace of God I
[17:59] love going over topics like this again
[18:00] to prove that brother brandham had thus
[18:02] sayith the Lord regarding the godhead
[18:04] recall brother Bram said thus sayith the
[18:05] Lord trinitarianism is of the devil he
[18:08] said because all these words that
[18:10] trinitarians use are not found in the
[18:12] Bible now my precious brother I know
[18:15] this is a tape also now don't get
[18:18] excited let me say this with Godly
[18:21] love the hours approach where I can't
[18:24] hold still on these things no more too
[18:27] close to the coming see
[18:31] trinitarianism is of the
[18:33] devil I say that thus sayith the Lord
[18:37] amen look where it come
[18:41] from it come from the N seeing
[18:44] Council when the Catholic Church become
[18:47] in
[18:48] rulership the word Trinity is not even
[18:50] mentioned in the entire book of the
[18:54] Bible and as far as three Gods that's
[18:58] from heav
[18:59] there's one
[19:02] God it's exactly right now do you say
[19:06] then you believe it all these people
[19:08] that as trinitarians are of hell no sir
[19:10] I believe they are
[19:12] Christians but the hour is approaching
[19:15] brother where they are sincerely wrong
[19:19] and remember friends we must use Bible
[19:21] words I have another section in my book
[19:24] and the section is about how God uses
[19:26] three manifestations in the godhead not
[19:28] three persons
[19:29] if only trinitarians would be humble and
[19:31] admit to themselves that the Bible
[19:33] doesn't use the word Trinity or three
[19:35] persons if they could only humble
[19:37] themselves and use the words the Bible
[19:39] uses like
[19:40] manifestation God was manifest In the
[19:43] Flesh so the son is a manifestation of
[19:45] the invisible God according to 1 Timothy
[19:48] 3:16 and then the Holy Ghost is a
[19:50] manifestation according to First
[19:52] Corinthians 12:7 but the manifestation
[19:55] of the spirit is given to every man to
[19:57] profit with all so we can see it's
[19:59] undeniable the Bible uses the word
[20:01] manifest in related to the godhead and
[20:03] not three persons this wonderful
[20:06] Revelation that God gave to brother
[20:07] brandham is the same Revelation St Paul
[20:09] had all the Bible authors had the same
[20:11] Revelation that God is one person so
[20:13] we're thankful they could be restored in
[20:15] the end time just as Revelation 10:7
[20:17] says the mystery of God should be
[20:19] finished the godhead has called a
[20:20] mystery in Colossians 2:2 so God used
[20:23] brother Bram to restore that Revelation
[20:25] that he gave to St Paul in the beginning
[20:27] God restored the Revelation here at the
[20:28] end time Jesus also said that in Matthew
[20:31] 17:1 Elijah shall come and restore all
[20:34] things so brother BR was anointed with
[20:36] the spirit of Elijah to restore the
[20:37] revelation of the godhead to the people
[20:39] of God it's also a fulfillment of
[20:42] Malachi 45 and6 that Elijah the Holy
[20:44] Spirit upon brother Brandon would turn
[20:45] our hearts back to the apostolic fathers
[20:49] so we rejoice in that friends we're so
[20:50] glad we've been visited by the Holy
[20:51] Ghost using a prophet to restore the
[20:54] word of God to our hearts if you have
[20:56] any questions concerns or testimonies
