[0:06] Greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:08] of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of
[0:11] this video is to answer three questions
[0:13] from viewers. So by the grace of God,
[0:15] we'll do that. Now the first question is
[0:18] really about Romans 8:9 and how the
[0:21] Bible says now if any man have not the
[0:24] spirit of Christ, he is none of his. So
[0:26] the full question says we believe that
[0:28] to be saved you must have a sign which
[0:30] is the Holy Spirit. So like people in
[0:33] denominations they are saved. The
[0:36] scripture says that whoever does not
[0:38] have the spirit of Christ does not
[0:40] belong to him. Could you explain this to
[0:42] me? Excellent question. So again
[0:45] according to Matthew
[0:47] 25:es 1-1 or 1-13 I believe there are
[0:51] Christians who are wise Christians and
[0:53] then there are foolish Christians. The
[0:55] wise Christians have extra oil, which
[0:58] means they have the oil of the baptism
[1:00] of the Holy Ghost in their souls. Just
[1:03] like in the parable, the wise virgins
[1:05] prepared extra oil. And so there's three
[1:08] parts to man according to 1
[1:09] Thessalonians 5:23. There's the body,
[1:12] there's the human spirit or the mind,
[1:14] and then there's the soul. And so the
[1:16] wise virgins had extra oil. They had it
[1:18] in the soul, not just in the human
[1:21] spirit. So foolish virgins are people
[1:23] like those in denominations who have a
[1:26] true love for the Lord, but they're not
[1:28] baptized with the Holy Ghost. They're
[1:30] missing oil. They're missing an extra
[1:33] portion of the anointing of the baptism
[1:35] of the Holy Ghost. So we would say also
[1:37] that they're justified and perhaps a
[1:39] little sanctified, but they're not
[1:40] baptized with the Holy Ghost. They have
[1:42] not received the three works of God's
[1:45] grace. And so regarding Romans 8:9, now
[1:49] if any man have not the spirit of
[1:50] Christ, he's none of his. Then we would
[1:52] say a foolish virgin does belong to
[1:55] Christ because they have a measure of
[1:57] the Holy Ghost. The word measure is used
[2:00] for Christians. There's a measure of
[2:02] faith. And of course, faith is what
[2:04] saves us. By grace, you're saved through
[2:06] faith according to Ephesians
[2:08] 2:8-10. Another way to look at this is
[2:11] this visual here of the stature of
[2:13] perfect man. We know second Peter
[2:16] chapter 1 says there's levels of the
[2:19] anointing of the Holy Ghost. So you
[2:20] start with faith, virtue, knowledge,
[2:23] temperance, patience, godliness,
[2:24] brotherly kindness, and charity. So I
[2:27] believe that faith all the way up
[2:30] through brotherly kindness are
[2:31] anointings for justification and
[2:34] sanctification. But charity is the third
[2:36] work of grace, the baptism of the Holy
[2:38] Ghost. So even a person who is freshly
[2:41] saved or justified, they have the spirit
[2:43] of Christ just in a smaller measure. And
[2:46] friends, we can apply this of course to
[2:48] the thief on the cross. Now that was of
[2:49] course in the Old Testament, but even in
[2:51] the Old Testament, they could be
[2:52] justified and sanctified. They just
[2:54] couldn't receive the baptism of the Holy
[2:56] Ghost in the soul because the Holy Ghost
[2:58] wasn't yet given until Jesus was
[3:00] glorified according to John 7. I believe
[3:02] it's verses 37-39.
[3:05] So the thief on the cross recognized he
[3:07] was worthy of death because of his
[3:10] stealing. He recognized his own guilt.
[3:13] But he recognized also Jesus as innocent
[3:16] as the true lamb of God and asked to be
[3:18] remembered when Jesus came into his
[3:20] kingdom. And of course Jesus said,
[3:22] "Today you'll be with me in paradise."
[3:24] So here the thief on the cross, the
[3:26] saved thief was justified. He had the
[3:29] spirit of Christ. the spirit of Christ
[3:30] had come upon him to recognize his sins,
[3:33] repent of his sins, and trust in Jesus
[3:35] Christ for salvation. Remember, Jesus
[3:37] Christ is the same yesterday, today, and
[3:39] forever. If God saved someone, we'd say,
[3:41] on their deathbed here in the New
[3:42] Testament, then he's the same forever,
[3:44] just like he saved the thief on the
[3:46] cross there on his cross where he
[3:48] couldn't get down from the cross and be
[3:49] baptized. And a repentant sinner who is
[3:52] justified does have the spirit of Christ
[3:55] in a small measure justification or we
[3:58] would say faith. So a justified and
[4:00] sanctified person does belong to Christ.
[4:03] They're just in a foolish condition.
[4:05] We'd say they haven't gone all the way
[4:07] into the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[4:09] Second question. If someone believes in
[4:11] a doctrine that is contrary to the Bible
[4:13] like the Trinity, can it be immediately
[4:16] concluded that this person does not have
[4:18] the Holy Spirit? Excellent question. I
[4:21] would say the answer is most of the
[4:22] time, yes. Most of the time you can
[4:25] conclude immediately that the person
[4:27] does not have the baptism of the Holy
[4:28] Ghost. And the reason I say that is
[4:30] because now we're almost 60 years past
[4:34] the seven church age messenger coming,
[4:37] brother Brandham. And that's given the
[4:39] world 60 years to have the revelation of
[4:41] the godhead go around the world through
[4:43] preaching, through the internet, and so
[4:45] forth. So someone who has the baptism of
[4:47] the Holy Ghost will not add to the word
[4:49] of God. The trinitarian doctrine adds to
[4:51] the word of God. The words three persons
[4:53] are never applied to God. Nor are two
[4:55] persons ever applied to God. Nor is the
[4:58] phrase eternal son ever applied to God.
[5:02] So those are all additions to the Bible.
[5:04] Those are all false teachings that
[5:06] originate from the trinitarian dogma.
[5:10] Now, the reason I say in most cases is
[5:12] because brother Brandham believes he
[5:14] received the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[5:16] in a shed right after he was saved. And
[5:19] and of course, he believed in the
[5:20] Trinity up until about 1954. I have a
[5:23] recent video on that. And then I
[5:24] preached a sermon on it where there's I
[5:26] think at least 22 or 23 quotes where
[5:28] brother Ram speaks positively of the
[5:30] second person of the Trinity, of the
[5:32] third person of the Trinity. He said he
[5:34] loved the third person of the Trinity,
[5:35] and the third person of the Trinity
[5:37] burned in his heart. So it seems just in
[5:40] ignorance, brother Ram had the baptism
[5:41] of the Holy Ghost, but yet he believed
[5:43] in three persons up until about 1954. He
[5:47] probably received the baptism of the
[5:48] Holy Ghost in 1932 or
[5:51] 1933, at least according to the timeline
[5:54] that I've come to understand. And I
[5:56] could be wrong on that. So please
[5:57] correct me if I'm wrong on that by God's
[5:59] grace. So I try to use that principle of
[6:02] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday,
[6:03] today, and forever. And this kind of
[6:05] goes along with the first question. If
[6:06] Jesus Christ saved somebody on their
[6:09] deathbed or on their cross right before
[6:11] they died, then he's the same yesterday,
[6:13] today, and forever. He can save people
[6:15] in the very last moments. And here, he
[6:17] can fill someone with the baptism of the
[6:19] Holy Ghost even before they've received
[6:21] the revelation of the mystery. Now,
[6:23] remember, mysteries do not pertain to
[6:25] salvation. The blood of Jesus Christ and
[6:28] faith in the blood of Jesus Christ,
[6:30] being saved by grace through faith, that
[6:31] pertains to salvation, not by works,
[6:34] lest any man should boast. So we apply
[6:36] that to salvation. We also apply this to
[6:38] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. If
[6:40] brother Ram received the baptism of the
[6:41] Holy Ghost without understanding the
[6:43] truth of the Godhead, well then perhaps
[6:45] Jesus Christ could do that today by the
[6:48] grace of God. Now most times in the
[6:50] Bible, people receive the baptism of the
[6:52] Holy Ghost through another preacher. We
[6:54] see that in Acts chapter 2 with Peter.
[6:56] We see that in Acts chapter 8. In Acts
[6:59] chapter 8 with Peter and John coming
[7:00] down to pray for the Samaritans. We see
[7:02] that in Acts chapter 10 with Peter at
[7:05] the house of Cornelius and we see that
[7:07] in Acts chapter 19 with Paul in Ephesus.
[7:11] In all the cases in the Bible, a
[7:13] preacher had to be there for people to
[7:14] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[7:16] But in Brother Bam's testimony, it seems
[7:18] like he received the baptism of the Holy
[7:19] Ghost just between he and the Lord Jesus
[7:22] Christ. So I also want to leave room
[7:24] that that's possible today. Someone
[7:25] could receive the baptism of the Holy
[7:27] Ghost without a preacher being there.
[7:28] But I would say in most cases in the
[7:30] Bible, a preacher is there when a person
[7:33] receives the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[7:35] And that person could have a
[7:36] misunderstanding about the Godhead
[7:38] because it doesn't pertain to salvation.
[7:40] And they could receive the baptism of
[7:42] the Holy Ghost before they receive the
[7:43] revelation that God is one person. And
[7:46] the third and final question is about
[7:47] confession. I was asked, could you
[7:49] please do a video on confession? What
[7:51] does James 5 mean? Do we have to confess
[7:54] our sins as believers to our pastor like
[7:57] the Catholic Church to the pope? So, of
[7:59] course, the answer is no. You don't have
[8:00] to confess your faults to the pastor.
[8:02] You would only confess your faults to
[8:04] the pastor if you sinned against the
[8:06] pastor. Matthew 5:23 and 24 say, "If you
[8:10] bring your gift to be offered and you
[8:12] remember that a brother has something
[8:14] against you, leave your gift there and
[8:17] go make it right." So if you're praying
[8:19] and worshiping and coming to the house
[8:20] of God and realize, "Oh, my brother is
[8:23] angry against me or is upset with me, I
[8:25] need to leave and go make that right."
[8:28] So if someone's upset with me, I need to
[8:30] go make it right. And then Matthew 18:15
[8:33] through19 is the other side. If someone
[8:36] sins against me, I need to go to them
[8:38] one-on-one. If they don't receive it, I
[8:40] need to take another witness. And then
[8:42] if they don't receive that, I got to
[8:43] bring it before the church. And then the
[8:44] church has to go to the individual. So
[8:47] that would be the only time you'd have
[8:49] to confess your sins to the pastor is if
[8:51] you actually sinned against the pastor.
[8:53] We do not want to bring Catholic
[8:54] traditions into the message of the hour,
[8:57] the Bible revelations for today. Some
[8:59] helpful scriptures are 1 John 1:9, "If
[9:01] we confess our sins, he's faithful and
[9:03] just to forgive us of our sins and
[9:05] cleanse us from all unrighteousness."
[9:07] This text never says you have to confess
[9:09] to your pastor. 1 Timothy 2:5, "For
[9:12] there's one God and one mediator between
[9:14] man and God. The man Christ Jesus, not
[9:17] the pastor, the Lord Jesus Christ, is
[9:19] the mediator between men and God."
[9:23] Hebrews 4:14-16 says, "We have a great
[9:25] high priest, Jesus, the son of God. Let
[9:28] us therefore come boldly unto the throne
[9:30] of grace, that we may obtain mercy and
[9:32] find grace to help in the time of need,
[9:34] so we go directly to the Lord Jesus
[9:36] Christ if we've sinned. We don't have to
[9:39] go to the pastor unless we sinned
[9:40] against the pastor. Again, Hebrews
[9:43] 10:19-22 says, "We have boldness to
[9:46] enter into the holiest by the blood of
[9:47] Jesus. Let us draw near with a true
[9:50] heart in full assurance of faith to the
[9:53] high priest." So again, let's draw near
[9:55] to Jesus Christ, the high priest. We
[9:58] don't have to draw near to the pastor.
[10:01] Psalm 32:5, I acknowledge my sin unto
[10:03] thee. So the psalmist says, "I went to
[10:06] God and I told God my sin. You don't
[10:08] have to go to the priest or the pastor
[10:10] to acknowledge your sin. I said, 'I will
[10:13] confess my transgressions unto the
[10:15] Lord." Notice to the Lord, not to any
[10:18] other person. Luke
[10:21] 18:13-14, the publican stood aar off,
[10:25] smote his breast, and say, "God, be
[10:26] merciful to me a sinner." He was the one
[10:28] that left forgiven. He didn't have to go
[10:30] to the priest there in the Jewish
[10:32] temple. He could go directly to God and
[10:34] be forgiven. In James 5:15-16, you have
[10:38] to take these verses in context. These
[10:40] verses never say you have to go to your
[10:42] pastor or a priest to confess. The Bible
[10:45] said, "The prayer of faith shall save
[10:46] the sick. If you have committed sins,
[10:49] they shall be forgiven him." Verse 16,
[10:51] "Confess your faults one to another and
[10:53] pray for one another." So if we take
[10:55] this in context with all the other
[10:57] verses I've just read, you only go
[10:59] confess your faults to another when
[11:01] you've sinned against that person. Any
[11:03] other time the sin is private and you've
[11:06] just sinned against the Lord. You just
[11:08] have to talk to the Lord. In closing,
[11:10] friends, I hope these questions and
[11:12] answers were a blessing by the grace of
[11:14] God. Please let me know if I missed
[11:15] anything or if I should add anything in
[11:17] the comments. We can talk about it down
[11:18] there in the comments by the grace of
[11:20] God. Praise the Lord Jesus Christ for
[11:22] sending his Holy Spirit to justify us,
[11:24] to sanctify us, to fill us with the Holy
[11:27] Ghost and we belong to him. I was even
[11:29] reading yesterday out of Matthew 25 in
[11:31] the parable of the great white throne
[11:32] judgment. The Bible even says that the
[11:35] foolish virgin like sheep were known and
[11:38] blessed by God and were known before the
[11:40] foundation of the world. So a person who
[11:43] is justified has a measure of the spirit
[11:45] of Christ. Those who are baptized with
[11:47] the Holy Ghost though they have a
[11:49] greater measure. They have it in the
[11:50] soul. And praise God that we can confess
[11:54] our sins directly to the Lord Jesus
[11:56] Christ. We don't have to go tell the
[11:58] pastor or the priest all of our sins
[12:00] unless we sinned against that person. Of
[12:02] course, for us, it'd be a pastor, not a
[12:04] priest. We can go directly to the high
[12:06] priest of heaven, the Lord Jesus Christ,
[12:08] who can be touched by the feeling of our
[12:10] infirmity. He was tempted in all points
[12:12] like as we are. He can understand our
[12:15] trials. He can help us. He can forgive
[12:17] us. He can help us get back in the
[12:19] light. as he's in the light according to
[12:21] 1 John chapter 1. If you have any
[12:23] questions, concerns or testimonies about
[12:25] this video, please contact
[12:27] me. God bless you and may Jesus Christ
[12:29] be the desire of your heart.
[12:33] Very happy to be here this afternoon and
[12:35] again in defense of the gospel of Jesus
[12:37] Christ to bring the good tidings, the
[12:40] good news that Jesus raised from the
[12:42] dead, living among man today, his
[12:44] church. The same Jesus that was
[12:47] yesterday will be today and
[12:50] forever. It never fails.
