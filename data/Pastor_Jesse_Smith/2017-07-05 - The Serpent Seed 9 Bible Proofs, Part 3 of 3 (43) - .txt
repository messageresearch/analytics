Description:
In the final part of this series, Proofs #6, #7, #8, and #9 are taught with full Scriptural support. Proof #6 of the Serpent Seed is God's punishment for Eve's sin focused on her sexual reproduction and her desire (longing) for her husband. Proof #7 is that the serpent was human-like before the fall. Proof #8 is that Cain was not of Adam but was of "that wicked one" - the serpent. The final proof, Proof #9, is the "seed of the woman", mentioned in Genesis 3:15,  was a literal Man, Jesus Christ, and so the seed of the serpent was also a literal man, Cain.
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] proof number six of the serpent seed is God's punishment for Eve focused on sexual reproduction and her desire or longing for her husband in Genesis 3:16 God issued a two-fold punishment on Eve because she was deceived by the serpent into eating the forbidden fruit unto the woman he said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow in thy conception in sorrow Thou shalt bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over Thee the first fold of God's punishment upon Eve was that she would experience multiplied or increased sorrow from the conception of children all the way to the delivery of children notice that the first consequence of Eve sin focus on her sexual reproduction of seed or offspring we can all recognize that throughout the Bible God's punishments or Consequences always fitted the crimes for example the Old Testament law of Moses taught punishments fit the crimes such as eye for eye tooth for tooth hand for hand foot for foot according to Exodus 21:4 a second example would be David's sin of adultery with Bas Sheba because David shed innocent blood the sword of Bloodshed would never depart from his house according to 2 Samuel 129 and10 because David laid with uriah's wife wife privately God would allow David wives to be taken from him and laid with publicly before all Israel According to second Samuel 12 11 and 12 in the case of Eve sin God was no different than he was with Israel and David the consequences of her sins fit her transgressions the pain and suffering that all women experience in bringing forth seed or offspring is a constant Universal reminder from God to all of Eve's daughters that she willingly received or accepted the wrong seed in the beginning from the serpent because Eve broke her marriage covenant and received the wrong seed she would experience suffering bringing forth any and all seed because Eve failed in the area of sexual reproduction all women have increased suffering in sexual reproduction if Eve had eaten a literal Apple why didn't God punish her mouth and all apple trees remember that God's punishments must fit the crimes and in Eve's case God's punishment focused on human reproduction and the body parts of the loins that are used for that process which again proves Eve and Adam sin with their loins because they cover their loins immediately after eating because of the feelings of nakedness that go along with sexual sin the second fold of God's punishment upon Eve was that her desire would now be upon her own husband again as God's punishments fit the crimes God was commanding Eve to desire or long for her own husband which means that before God's command Eve desired or longed for someone else and not her husband we know it was The Serpent and the fruit of adultery that Eve longed for as Eve was guilty of longing or lusting after the act of adultery because remember that the Bible says sin entered the world through her lust it is important to notice in the scripture that Adam recognized that Eve was pregnant in Genesis 3: vers 20 immediately after God identified the two separate seeds in Genesis 3:15 Adam called his wife's name Eve because she was already the mother of all living two seeds or children were already living and growing inside Eve's womb and Adam recognized that Eve would be the mother of all living persons whether they were good or evil proof seven of the serpent seed is the serpent was humanlike before the fall when you carefully study the scriptures about the serpent in Genesis 3 you will notice that he was very different than snakes are today he was so different that he was humanlike first the serpent was more subtle which means shrewd Sly or crafty than any other beast of the field that the Lord had made the serpent was the only Beast we are aware of that God made with the ability to talk and to use intellectual reasoning making him very close to a human being that is why why Satan selected the serpent to indwell and deceive Eve for Satan was present in the garden of God and is known to possess animals and beasts second the serpent was an upright creature before the fall because after the fall God cursed the serpent to go on his belly the rest of his days the serpent was somewhat in between a chimpanzee and a man but closer to a man standing upright and able to carry an intellectual conversation with the deceived Eve third the serpent had a seed that could and did mix with Eve's reproductive parts causing her to conceive the Serpent's own seed according to God in Genesis 3:15 when this happened God cursed the serpent he changed every bone in the Serpent's body so that he had to crawl like a snake science can try all it wants to and it won't find the missing link God saw to that man is smart and he can see an association of man with animal and he tries to prove it out by Evolution there isn't any Evolution but man and animal did mingle that's one of the mysteries of God that has remained hidden but here it is revealed it happened right back there in the midst of Eden when Eve turned away from life to accept death we hope that your mental picture of what the serpent looked like in the Garden of Eden has now been changed to match the description given to us straight from the Bible a humanlike upright standing creature with the ability to have an intellectual conversation with a human being proof eight of the Serpent's Seed is Cain was not of Adam but was of that Wicked one the serpent according to the Holy Spirit Cain was not the son of Adam but was the son of the serpent according to 1 John 3:12 not as Cain who was of that Wicked one and slew his brother if the Bible teaches that Cain was of the wicked one then Adam could not have the wicked one John was speaking of for the Bible also said Adam was a Son of God in Luke 3:38 this brings us to the truth of the two separate seed lines the seed of Adam and the seed of the serpent in the womb of Eve were two separate seeds or sons from separate impregnations she was carrying twins with Cain's conception sometime previous to that of abeles to those who think that this is not possible let it be known that the medical records are complete with cases where women have carried twins who were of separate OVA and separate insemination with the fertilization of the eggs being days apart and not only so but some of the records show that the twins were fed by separate males this is called heteropaternal super fundation here's an article we found from the Journal of forensic science that validates heteropaternal super fundation here's a case report from the Journal of forensic Sciences July 199 94 the title of the case report is paternity identification in twins with different fathers the abstract reads if a female has sexual intercourse with two males at Short intervals within the same ovulatory period super fundation may occur this article reports two cases of paternity identification in twins the results showed that each twin had come from a different father thus great attention should be paid to such a situation when the Twin paternity identification is asked for we believe God allowed this medical research to provide additional support to prove what actually happened in the Garden of Eden that one female Eve had sexual intercourse with two different males The Serpent and Adam at Short intervals within the same ovulatory period and produced twins that came from two different fathers Cain from The Serpent and Abel from Adam these two separate seed lines have separate characteristics the seed of Adam are blessed and the seed of the serpent are cursed because of their separate characteristics Cain the seed of the serpent bore the full spiritual characteristics of Satan and the animalistic sensual or fleshly characteristic of the serpent no wonder the holy spirit said that Cain was of that Wicked one he was Cain was a liar and murderer just like Satan furthermore Cain was literally cursed by God just like God cursed the serpent in fact all Humanity that will be lost and sent to the Lake of Fire are called The Cursed God did not curse Adam or Eve God only cursed the ground for God cannot both curse and bless his children according to numbers 22:12 because Cain's cursed characteristics were so evil and contrary to God's obedient humble nature the Bible recorded Cain is having his own separate lineage in Genesis 4: 16- 26 Adam's seed or lineage was completely separate from canes as recorded in Genesis 5: 1-32 one point we want to emphasize about the two seed lines is that the physical genetic seeds of Adam and Cain are no longer separate because in the days of Noah the literal seed of the serpent passed through the ark and has now intermingled with the Godly seed so all man kind are affected by the genetic pollution of the serpent seed since the flood of Noah up until today God's seed or race are born of a spiritual seed and not a natural genetic seed God's blessed seed are recognized by the fact that they receive and obey the full word of God and are born again of the Holy Ghost according to 1 Peter 1 ver 23 proof number nine of the serpent seed is the seed of the woman was a literal man Christ and so was the seed of the serpent aital Man Cain recall again that God himself said the serpent had a literal seed or human offspring according to Genesis 3:15 if we give credit to God in Genesis 3:15 that the woman did have a seed then the serpent must surely have a seed also if the seed of the woman was a Manchild apart from the man then the seed of the serpent will have to be in the same pattern and that is another male must be born apart from human male instrumentality there is no student who does not know that the seed of the woman was the Christ who came by the instrumentality of God apart from Human intercourse the Virgin birth it is also just as well known that the predicted bruising of the Serpent's head was in actuality a prophecy concerning what Christ would accomplish against Satan at the cross there at the cross Christ would bruise the head of Satan while Satan would bruise the heel of the Lord as the seed of the woman was literally God reproducing himself in human flesh so the seed of the serpent is the literal way that Satan found he was able to open the door to himself into the human race it was impossible for Satan for he is only a created spirit being to reproduce himself in the manner which God reproduced himself so the Genesis account tells how he produced his seed and into introduced or injected himself into the human race also recall that Satan is called the serpent it is his seed or injection into the human race we are speaking of in closing there is much more that can be taught from the Bible about the seed of the serpent but we pray that what has been taught through these nine proofs of the serpent seed in this video Series has helped shine more Gospel Light upon the original sin in the Garden of Eden again we do not believe that someone has to understand and believe the doctrine of the serpent seed in order to be saved as the doctrine of repentance unto salvation leads true worshippers to eternal life but we do believe that if someone is saved Sanctified and also Born Again of the Holy Ghost then they will surely see the truth of the original sin because Jesus promised that the Holy Ghost would lead Believers into all truth in John 16:13 and the truth of the seed of the serpent is part of the full revelation of the word of God the truth of the seed of the serpent only shines light upon the Glorious work of redemption through the Virgin birth of Jesus Christ that we are all trying to see if you would like more scriptures about the serpent seed or have questions about this Doctrine please contact us God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
