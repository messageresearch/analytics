TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] happy to see today is our first Pastor brother James Jones from Indianapolis back there and the pastor was weakling enough to let him get by with it shame on the pastors that fails his hand out in their Church greetings friends in the mattress name of the Lord Jesus Christ this is part three of a three-part series proving that Jim Jones did not believe the Bible revelations that God gave to his true Prophet brother William Branham in Parts one and two we covered the first four sections we covered the accusation and character of brother Brown's accusers then we showed Brothers quote about Jim Jones and their Association third we showed brother branham's nine sermon warnings to Pastor Jim Jones and his associate pastors and then we saw in part four historical facts about Jim Jones this video will cover the fifth and final section called a summary contrasting Jim Jones and brother Branham before beginning on these 22 proofs let me add another disclaimer about this video this video is for adults only due to the sensitive nature of some of these quotations from Jim Jones where he speaks about his adulteries and fornications as well as his mandate for his 900 followers to commit revolutionary suicide summary contrasting Jim Jones and brother Branham in this final section I'll give 22 contrast between Jim Jones and brother Branham proving that Jim Jones did not believe the bible-based message and Revelation that God gave to his true Prophet brother William Branham the first contrast is that Jim Jones was a mass murder responsible for over 900 deaths here's the infamous sad quote from Jim Jones wherein he's influencing his 900 plus followers to commit the act of revolutionary suicide the conditions of an inhumane world contrast that with brother Branham who was a holy ghost-filled Christian and even as a Young Man the Holy Ghost protected brother Branham so that he did not murder the young boys that bullied him as he talked about in questions and answers part 4 1964. 9 5 [Music] [Music] I've been a murderer the second contrast is that Jim Jones constantly use cuss words with his congregation most of Jim Jones recordings are just incredibly hard to listen to and I hope by God's grace I won't listen to any more of them but I felt I had to for the sake of Defending God's prophet and God's message of this day and of course contrast Jim Jones filthy mouth with brother Adam's clean mouth brother man was a true servant of God he did not use swear words with his congregation Jim Jones had the filthiest mouth I have ever heard from any person again showing the contrast between Jim Jones darkness and brother random light the Gospel of Jesus Christ has shined into brother Ram's heart and life unbelievable and the reason she's smoke and drinking is constantly do the things you do is because you are an unbeliever the third contrast was Jim Jones was addicted to drugs nearly every website reports this and brother Branham lived a clean holy life he was not addicted to drugs fourth Jim Jones believed he was God brother Ram did not claim to be God here's some audio from Jim Jones saying he was God and that he was the Lord that appeared in the plains of mamry Unto Abraham [Music] as [Music] [Music] of all religious appeal in all the gifts of faculties [Music] all of the condescending savior images that you have been married [Music] Solomon said his hair was as black as a raven [Music] those days [Music] the fifth contrast is Jim Jones believed in reincarnation and brother Branham did not here's audio from Jim Jones saying he's already planned out when his mind would transmigrate to a different body in order to sit upon his throne in case he died of a stroke let's listen to these lies [Music] are disabled they're only a matter of hours already gone over this there'll be someone else sitting in this seat the sixth contrast is Jim Jones was a whoremonger a sexual pervert an adulterer and bisexual Jim Jones would brag about having over 30 adulteries in one night and one audio Source says he could commit adultery with all the people that needed it in one night and he had more adulteries to deal with than anyone else in the whole Community then he threatened to lay with every woman in the community proving he was a sick whoremonger have that opportunity and I got more sex to deal with than any of you got to deal with remember you've had the problem but all that I've never been able to have sex without responsibility it was just a simple sexual matter you could just instead of counselor and just go down I could take care of people who need to feel good about control that take care of the other night I don't think that's what people need I think they need something more than maybe social acceptance begins there contrast that with brother Branham who lived a holy life he lived true to his first wife before she passed sister hope and then he lived true to Sister Mita during their entire marriage until his death seventh Jim Jones believed he had the Fountain of Youth brother Branham did not here's audio from Jim Jones saying if he did not take on everyone's problems he would never age let's listen to the LIE [Music] married because I have to take on everybody's problems I would never age I think I could read it I've got the keys I I really got the keys to immortality but instead of keeping it I'm opening up as much as I can for you but the risk is in opening it for you I lose it for myself and I don't mind that whatsoever if you become what I am in principle if you become the kind of sensitive being that I am then I'm happy to lose my life something you think it's easy being God I can help people I eighth Jim Jones made a false prophecy about a nuclear attack saying what happened in 1967 it did not come to pass and brother Ryan was a genuine Prophet all of his prophecies did come to pass and will come to pass by the grace of God and I have numerous videos about these prophecies ninth Jim Jones made a false prophecy about brother Branham being decapitated at his death I already went over that and this was covered earlier in the video 10th Jim Jones said the people couldn't live without him this was from Jim Jones Infamous death tape and of course this was Jim Jones exalting himself as equal to God and brother Brown never said this about himself at the end of the church age book brother random even said he did not come in his ministry to get people to follow him and brother Ram said he wasn't the only preacher he was just one Pebble on the beach and brother man said I won't always be your pastor one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me or join my church or start some fellowship and organization I have never done that and will not do that now I have no interest in those things but I do have an interest in the things of God and people and if I can accomplish just one thing I will be satisfied that one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and Men or a man become New Creations in Christ filled with his spirit and live according to his word is more eligible more worthy more of anything to preach than me I'm just one little humble person lady [Music] see so it's just uh you know what I mean we don't want every part of man in it you forget anything about me I am your brother a sinners Sinners not fit to live that's exactly the truth I stand out to be a humble that's facts there's nothing in me not one sound thing at all but the grace of God has let my poor dimming lies look beyond the Kirk of pain and see those things no it's been long we won't always be standing here I won't always be your pastor it's making sure eleventh Jim Jones said socialism is the real hero let's listen to the audio of Jim Jones saying socialism is the hero [Applause] work but you're here with other contacts we're here because of some I don't know how to make these some some other hero and there shouldn't be any Heroes with socialism anyway you you what a contrast to brother Brandon brother Brandon said Jesus's return would solve the sin problem s and uh all these things are here to stay so coroner brother Branham Jesus is the real and only hero 12th Jim Jones was arrested for lewd sexual conduct by an undercover agent in California that was from a website so I don't have audio of that but of course brother Brandon was never arrested for any immoral thing brother Ram lived a Godly holy Christian Life 13th Jim Jones let women cut their hair wear pants wear makeup Etc here's a screenshot of one of the last Knights the Jonestown people were alive and here's a woman in pants now of course contrast this with brother Brandon brother Branham taught women should not wear pants they should wear skirts because of Deuteronomy 22 5. 14th Jim Jones broke down the nuclear family brother Branham did not I'm not going to play the audio of this but there's survivors from Jonestown and then family members of those people who died at Jonestown that talked about Jim Jones's tactics to break down the nuclear family Jim Jones encouraged the mothers to slightly abandon their children throughout the day and not hold them so that they would gain independence and allegiance to Jim Jones himself and of course brother Ram did not teach this again showing Jim Jones was a demon-possessed man 15th Jim Jones allowed fornication and adultery among his followers and brother Raynham did not here's audio of Jim Jones calling fornication shacking up with people he doesn't call it fornication as the Bible says and Jim Jones never uses the Bible to condemn it and then Jim Jones mandates that he get clear definitions about each relationship between a man and a woman so this proves that Jim Jones approved a fornication he approved of adulteries because he allowed them and just wanted to know which people were in a relationship situations and their responsibility if you are having a relationship are we living together if not if we're going to have relationships do not think together I will clear definitions of what those relationships are going to be you have a child you assume responsibility if you don't have a child that Nursery if you're a male and assume responsibility with children you wash diapers you deal with you 16th Jim Jones told people to call him father or dad and brother random forbade that brother Ram said it was man worship for a man to ask people to call him father here's audio of Jim Jones himself calling himself father Jones [Music] [Music] [Music] it's amazing [Music] 17th Jim Jones was a con man a swindler of millions of dollars from the people this is clear from all the websites and contrast this with brother Brandon who turned down millions of dollars in order to serve Jesus Christ humbly and reverently 18th Jim Jones physically and mentally tortured his congregants I couldn't find the audio of this but I've heard Jim Jones's own voice Warn and threatened the people in his congregation that he would throw them into the pit or leave them alone in the jungle so the animals could get them and then former members of people's Temple testify of Jim Jones electrocuting some of his members as torture and Punishment and that even happened in California before they moved down to South America and of course brother Ram did no evil like this brother man was a holy ghost-filled Christian a prophet of God brother Branham prayed for his congregants and did not physically hurt them 19th Jim Jones said his people should be married to him and brother Braham did not teach this here's the audio of Jim Jones saying the people should be married to him First Alliance and first marriage should be to me instead of me as a basic ideal and I'm afraid of it now there is one quote where brother random said the Pastor is the husband spiritually speaking to the church but there's only one quote on this from how can I overcome 1963 and this is not a Bible teaching from Brother Branham he makes a statement out of a hypothetical story saying that Mrs Lott said all I have is my husband's word that sound is going to be destroyed but I want to stay in Sodom and have my hair cut so brother random said Mrs Lott wasn't heeding to the warning of her husband and brother Brown compared that to church members not taking heed to their pastors but of course this idea was just hypothetical the Bible teaches the pastor is Like a Shepherd to the Sheep the Bible doesn't teach that a pastor is like a husband to his wife so again we see a contrast between Jim Jones and brother Branham really Jim Jones wanted his people spiritually married to him and many of them were physically married to him through fornication through adulteries and this is opposite of brother Branham who like Saint Paul married the people Christ spiritually and brother bran was only physically married to one woman his wife 20th Jim Jones freely promoted birth control pills and brother random did not here's a quote from Jim Jones where he complains that the women are using up all the birth control pills foreign [Music] and Friends birth control pills many times cause abortions because they abort a fertilized egg so again the use of birth control pills shows a person is possessed with the spirit of murder They Don't Care About Life they only care about having the lust of the Flesh and don't want the results of a physical relationship which our children and God calls children God's Heritage and Friends brother Adam said the only right way for birth control is a woman charting her Cycles as brother Ram said in questions and answers part 3 1964 he said quote and there is a possibility of it being done in the right way I'd say it too for General there are so many days in a woman's life that she's not fertile you understand all right end quote what would you endorse birth control no I can't endorse it no sir how do you feel about birth control I had some of that on the interviews this morning uh brother Paul personally with you all know the same thing all those things there all these words and things that I have to say that I'd rather say if a husband and wife and there is a possibility of a for General there is so many days in a woman's life that she's not fertile you understand all right well now they sometimes that a child would kill a woman if she want to watch that too see so just be real careful about that see see that's bringing life for what you're Budget on Earth to do if your wife is sick and another child would kill her I wouldn't do it I don't think the Lord wants you to do it and you you come to me personally on them things you have your own private interview let me talk to you personally you see number 21 Jim Jones said children born in socialism were not born in sin and this is from a website of course brother Brown said the opposite brother Ram said quote all are born in sin brother random said at least 10 times everyone is born in sin no more and now when Jesus died a Calvary he took away the sins of the world and 22nd Jim Jones said you become a God and Jim Jones said the only God you need is in you I'll show you that you can bring yourself up your own bootstraps [Music] you can jump our races [Music] [Music] but that's my only purpose of being here so here Jim Jones Is Now allowing his members to become Gods which is false but then Jim Jones makes himself the highest God so Jim Jones was teaching self-worship now friends it's true Christ is in us the hope of glory according to Colossians chapter 1 but Jesus Christ is both in heaven and in us in our souls by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and so Jim Jones is taking God out of heaven and putting it all inside the Believers and we can't do that brother never taught that God is both in us and God's spirit is so great is divided amongst the Believers and yet God's spirit is also in the body of Jesus Christ on the throne of God in heaven so Jim Jones taught people to worship themselves make themselves God and of course brother Graham did not teach this in closing I hope this short Series has been a blessing friends to defend God's Prophet brother William Branham and prove hopefully once and for all that Jim Jones did not believe the bible-based teachings of brother William Branham if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart foreign
