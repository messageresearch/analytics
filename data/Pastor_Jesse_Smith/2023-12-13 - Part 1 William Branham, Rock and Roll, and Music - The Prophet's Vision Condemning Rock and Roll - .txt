TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] they were so immorally dressed so filthy looking and they were marching to the time of twist and rock and roll and those women throwing themselves just in twist greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ I'm Pastor Jesse Smith from bride of Christ Fellowship in akan Ohio USA and I defend the Bible revelations Jesus Christ revealed to his Prophet the late William brandham 1909 to 1965 the purpose of this video series is to Define rock and roll so Holy Ghost filled churches and other sincere churches can know how to keep rock and roll out of their services thus worshiping the Lord Jesus in an acceptable manner in spirit and in truth as Jesus said in John 4:23 and 24 in an all pleasing manner unto our heavenly father here's the outline for the video series which I'll eventually make make into a playlist Lord willing once the series is all done first in this part one we'll look at the prophet's Vision condemning rock and roll in United States churches in the second video we'll look at bible requirements for music and songs third will Define rock and roll fourth will show how brother brandom enjoyed both extremes of music and worship loud and quiet fast and slow emotional and serious fifth we'll look at additional quotes from brother brandham that will be a help regarding music and rock and roll in the sixth video I'll teach a balanced conclusion and then Lord willing I'll make a seventh video with questions and answers about music using the questions that come from the comments or emails from this video series before beginning I want to thank the numerous Saints who helped me with this video series including all the musicians from our church Bri of Christ Fellowship and also a few ministers named brother Ben and brother Alex you know who you are thank you each and everyone thank you for your wisdom dear brothers and sisters so let's look at the prophet's Vision condemning rock and roll in the United States of America churches I want to start with the prophet brother William branham's Vision condemning rock and roll and sadly how it's become a reality in many churches in the United States and of course around the world so this Vision God gave to brother brandham serves as both a condemnation of rock and roll and the churches who love rock and roll and also a warning to any church that might be drawn into it since brother brandham yelled out stay in line as the vision ended there was a group of Believers that were good Believers True Believers going up in the Rapture but as they were going up they were getting out of line getting out of step and brother brandom had to yell out stay in line I played the audio of the vision now from three different sermons and then I'll share three points about it first that the vision is biblical second it's fulfillment and third I'll share a current and brief definition of rock and roll because brother random makes the statement in this Vision quote time of twist and rock and roll end quote so let's listen to this Vision it's from three different sermons and of course there's other sermons that contained it but I use these three first is recognizing your day and its message July 2664 and then we'll look at the choosing of the Bride 1965 April 29th and lastly we look at the Rapture December 4th 1965 let's listen to the three quotes and remember the vision of last week that one the bride came to be a preview of it there came up the little bride lovely in the vision and I not thinking about it just sitting there watching outside and there come the bride I Heard a Voice with the side of me said here is a preview of the bride and she came by I noticed her the way she was very lovely pretty young she's walking just as step as she could not a March just in the stride of a a woman how they walk gracefully lady like that's the way she was walking coming to my left on this side and she went out of my sight then he turned me to the right side and he showed me each church as they come up out of the ages and oh how vulgar and the last one was this last day Church age which was led by a witch and they were so immortal ly dressed so filthy looking and they were marching to the time of twist and rock and roll and those women throwing themselves just in twist withh holding just paper gray hypocritical the word the gray is between a white and a black which is a deceiving color gray is neither white nor black it's a deceiving color and gray looking paper holding in front of them with lace like hola skirts holding in front of them and completely nuded from their waist up and was marching to the a time or twisting and carrying on with that music walking up and said that is the church and when it passed by me my heart like to fainted I thought if that's what is trying to be presented to Christ as a bride of all the efforts and things that man has put forth to try to bring forth a bride for Christ and a bulg dirty filthy looking prostitute like that to be the bride of Christ it made me sick at my heart and as she passed after she coming before where we were standing she was holding the paper in front of her twisting and rocking and moving herself one side and then the other side as she went like the modern dances they have of this day using herself in an immoral act as she was marching on I not responsible for these things I can only say what I seen and God is my judge but that was the church from USA now as she passed by the whole back part had no covering at all and then as she passed by I felt faint and sickly then he said the bride will come into preview again and here the bride came behind her the very same looking bride that passed at the beginning then my heart jumped for joy to know that there will be a bride and she'll be made of the same thing clothed in the same thing that the one was at the beginning she is to be called and I know that is the truth yes if that isn't true then every Vision that I've had in the back has been wrong amen and anyone knows that not one thing has ever told us but what was the truth it come to pass just and can you see then the filthiness of the modern Church calling herself a church is and just as they started to going right up into the skies this other one went up to a break of a hill and went down like that these started marching right up into the skies and when they went to marching I noticed a couple of little girls in the back look like they might be of some forign girl like Sweden or Switzerland or somewhere they started to look around and got I said don't do that don't get out of that step and there a scream like that I come to in the vision stand there with my hand out like that I thought well then I heard something like an Onward Christian Soldiers I look and here come that sainted bunch of little girls just exactly the way they was all correctly dressed their hair hanging way down in their back smooth clean marching like this to the step of the Gospel she was the word it looked like one out of every nation I was looking at as they passed by and seen them pass by instead of going down they started going up I noticed one of them trying two or three of them trying to get in out line I scream stay in line and the vision left me and I was standing in his room screaming stay in line now that we've heard the vision here's Point number one this Vision God gave to brother brandham is biblical cuz we must take everything back to the word of God the Bible example that relates to this vision is of course Israel singing and dancing when they set up the golden calf in Exodus 32 this simple chart shows the similarities on the left you have the 1964 Vision on the right you have Exodus 32 so the first thing in the vision we saw was singing they also had singing there in Exodus 3218 next there was dancing or twisting in the vision of course there was dancing in Exodus 32:19 third there was nakedness and a seductive element to their appearance as we saw in the 1964 65 Vision the Bible also said and of course this was the same in Exodus 32 the Bible said the Israelis rose up to play which means flirting so there's sexual immorality going on that's in Exodus 3218 to 19 and exodus 32:25 this word playing means flirting according to Genesis 26 6:8 and fourth and finally there was witchcraft brother Bram said the church was led by a witch in the 1964 65 vision and of course there was idolatry in Exodus 32:4 so we see strong demon powers in both the vision and exodus 32 point number two is the Fulfillment of this Vision history is very clear showing that around the years 2000 to 2010 rock and roll started taking over some of the most popular churches in the United States it's undeniable now you can go on any Mega Church's website or YouTube channel such as Hill song or Joel Olstein or Steven ferdi church and you'll hear them play rock and roll every single service one thing that's interesting too I've shared with some people is that my mother was born in 1950 so my mother's 73 now here in 2023 and I told her about this vision from brother brandham now my mother is not a follower of this message we're praying she accepts it but anyway way she was raised in Assembly of God denomination and still attends the same denomination and I told her what brother Brandon prophesied in 1965 and my mom said there's no way she would have ever imagined rock and roll would have come into her Assembly of God Church but she said around 200000 to 2015 she would attend the Assemblies of God youth conventions and every year they Incorporated more and more worldly music they started with rock and roll then went to hip hop and then rap and she said now it's a free-for-all the rock and roll hip hop and rap is just played constantly at the youth conventions and she doesn't like hearing it there so it just struck me and I told this to my mom I said wow Mom you have seen brother Ram's Vision fulfilled in your denomination so it's clear by both history and current websites and also personal experience the vision is fulfilled many American churches sing and dance to rock and roll and have a lot of immorality such as the vision showed women with bobbed hair sexy dressed women barely wear any clothes and very few standards for Holiness Point number three is my current working and brief definition of rock and roll in order to understand what brother Brandon meant by that statement quote time of twist and rock and roll so with this point I want to try to understand what did Brother Brandon mean by time of twist in rock and roll I have three observations about that statement first brother brand never told us the time of rock and roll although some have Tri tried to add to that quote and give a specific time for example some have said a 44 time is rock and roll and of course that's not true there's a lot of good Christian songs that have a 44 time so I asked a musician I said Is there a time for rock and roll another word for time is tempo is there a time or tempo for rock and roll and the Christian musicians I talked with said no Tempo is the largest aspect of beat in music when you listen to a song Tempo is a number of beats in a measure this basically means you can count to four before the measure resets it seems 44 is the most common time signature in Christian music and so it's clear Tempo or time has nothing to do with good or bad music so when brother random mentioned time for rock and roll it's most likely brother Randa meant the heavily accented beat of rock and roll as the definition of rock and roll says from the Webster's Dictionary it says quote persistent heavily accented beat end quote so having a beat is not evil because brother Brandon first danced in the Holy Ghost by tapping his foot along with the beat of the song the meeting in the air so before listening to this quote remember brother brandham said this sister was playing the piano so fast he said I believe if there had been three or four decks of key she could have played them so imagine how fast this sister was playing on the piano when brother Brandon was dancing in the spirit obviously it's fast and so I had a fast beat and so he was tapping his foot to the fast beat let's listen to the quote I noticed is then after while there's a little girl jumped out on the floor there and started dancing up and down jumping around I thought oh all right my own chirch here it is now I sure get I'm rooted for this so I kept watching her and you know I kept hearing that this get real that lady playing on that panish I Believe there' been three or four decks of key she could have played them just playing the god blown son will be the leading one at the meeting in the air and she no more get halfway out of that you should be started again she's got real white in her face and she's her eyes Clos and playing like that hey I got to feel pretty good got Pat my foot with that girl W well you know I thought well maybe that's just my method is put anyhow so I started patting the H you you know wasn't very long that I was out there with that girl D I got the [Music] victory a second observation is that brother brandom condemned modern dances in this quote it was in paragraph 43 but we also have to remember brother Ram said dancing in the spirit was Victory and he also said modern rhythms were were all right in another 1957 quote so we have to be balanced with this subject so not all dancing is sinful and not all modern rhythms are sinful here's the quote where brother random says dancing is Victory let's listen to the quote from 1954 here com his daughter and the and the daughter rejoicing dancing and uh I noticed how dancing was Victory and I thought well maybe I just haven't got Victory now yeah maybe just a little bit of self has to die out yeah analysis in the quote from 1957 brother Ram says the modern Rhythm the whoop it up on a piano to a lot of this here dancing in the spirit them things are all right so again there is Holy Ghost dancing and modern rhythms can be all right according to brother brandham let's listen to the quote because you can dance in the spirit all of this modern Rhythm Hoop It Up on a piano a lot of this your dancing in the spirit and things are all right but they tuck the whole thing over on that legal side see and therefore they left the spirit of God in the back so all these quotes from Brother random have brought me to the following definition of rock and roll it's a working definition and I start with Webster's Dictionary it says quote popular music usually played on electronically Amplified instruments and characterized by a persistent heavily aced beat repetition of simple phrases and often country folk and blues elements end quote so I start with that Webster's Dictionary quote and then I created this further definition to clarify rock and roll is excessive drums because drums are what create the beat and brother random said it was the time of rock and roll or he meant the beat or tempo of rock and roll now notice it's excessive drums not all drums because brother brandom did support some drums and so does the Bible because the Bible speaks of percussion instruments like tambourines here's two quotes where brother random supported drums the first is God's provided way 1953 he was talking about Elisha getting in the spirit bringing the spirit down by the minstral playing let's listen to the quote so they got to playing the music the tambri now listen if you can't be the prophet you can be one of the instruments you plays the music to bring the spirit down on the prophet you know what I mean so they begin to play the tambourine and so forth and beat the drums and play the instruments and all them began to beat and play and had a great big old song Maybe playing going to be a meeting in the air and a sweet sweet B by God's own son will be the leading one at the meeting in the air the prophet begin to get into the spirit now the first thing you know when he got in the spirit things begin to happen here's a second quote brother Ram supported drums he talked about Holy Ghost filled Saints would be better off in an alley with a guitar beating a drum let's listen to the quote what we need today is a prophet arise on the scene with thus sayith the Lord and strip those Saints to the bottom and say that they become a stin our denominations have grown and our churches are big and they're uh finer than they ever was we'd be a lot better off with a tin pan standing on the Alley again with a guitar out there beating the drum or something other with a real Pentecostal fire burning in our souls and the set the great pews that we're sitting in today dying the world dying under our feet yes sir so the next part of the working definition along with excessive drums is excessive bass and electric guitar but again not all bass and electric guitar playing is sinful it's just excessive bass and electric guitar the second element goes along with a third excessive volume because remember the Webster's Dictionary said it's electronically Amplified instruments so rock and roll has excessive drums excessive bass and electric guitar it has excessive volume or the volume overtakes the voices sending worship to the Lord Jesus Christ fourth rock and roll has excessive Distortion and in part three I'll share examples of all these sinful elements of rock and roll The Fifth Element of rock and roll is excessive improvisation and this includes adding the Boogie style which again I'll go over in part three of this series and the final part of rock and roll is a sensual voice so this means means the voice is singing based upon lust and not worship to the Lord Jesus Christ in closing friends I hope part one of this music Series has been a blessing and a help again my purpose is to help Believers around the world and especially in the United States of America to know how to condemn rock and roll music no Holy Ghost filled Saints will be deceived into worshiping with rock and roll so our desire is to keep the bride from rock and roll R help the bride Define rock and roll in order to be that pure bride who stays in step with the word of God all the way into the Rapture and friends as you can see we've got to be balanced with the scriptures and the quotes from God's Prophet brother William brandham I believe some Churches have gone into legalism on this subject and also some Churches have gone into lasciviousness or lawlessness on this subject because they do not consider all the scriptures and all the quotes from Brother brandham on this subject friends I'm not saying I know everything about this subject but after numerous years of study I believe this will be a balanced rightly divided teaching series on music by the help of the Holy Ghost and friends we're looking forward to part two of this series seven Bible requirements for music and songs if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your [Music] heart
