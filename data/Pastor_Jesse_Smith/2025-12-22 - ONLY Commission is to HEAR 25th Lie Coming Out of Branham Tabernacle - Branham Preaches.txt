TRANSCRIPT
========================================
He doesn't change. If he's still got a disciple, that's the same commission. Go ye into all the world, preach the gospel, these signs shall follow them that believe. It's never change. He can't change. [music] He said IN REVELATIONS THE 22ND CHAPTER, WHOSOEVER shall take one word out of this book or add one word to it, his part will be taken out of the book of life. We are not to take from the Bible or add to it. Just say what it says. &gt;&gt; Greetings friends [music] in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of this video is to look at a recent blog post from the Brandom Tabernacle which claimed that our only commission is to hear the tapes and not preach. So by God's grace, we'll rightly divide this latest blog post from Brandom Tabernacle. It was posted Saturday, December 20th, 2025. So, that was just two days ago cuz today is Monday, December 22nd. As I've said before, friends, I could look at every blog post from Brandon Tabernacle that comes out every Saturday and find more and more false doctrines if I wanted to, just because this group is greatly deceived. They are way off the word of God. They have added to the Bible and taken away from the Bible in many sad ways. I have a series of videos that show 24 false doctrines coming out of Brandham Tabernacle. And so I could make this subject the 25th. And this is the lie that we're only commissioned to hear and not to preach. Another lie. It's just lie after lie after lie. It's so sad. But that's what an evil spirit does, friends. When someone takes an evil spirit, if it's not repented of, it only grows. Jesus called it like leavenan. A false doctrine is like leaven. It will only grow and puff up until the entire thing is corrupted. Until the entire doctrine is corrupted. And this is done with a spirit of love incorrection. Brother Ram said love is corrective. Brother Bram said if something needs criticized then we need to criticize it. And of course do it in love. The Bible says speak the truth in love. So me making this video again shows my love for Brandon Tabernacle. And Lord willing, I'll try to remember to pray at the end of this video for these deceived people because the blind are leading the blind into more tape worship, into more denying the Bible, into more rejection of the Holy Bible. Sad to say, but that's what's happening. So, by God's grace, let's look at this blog post from a couple days ago. Apparently, they listened to Going Beyond the Camp. It says, "Dear beloved, God does not change. His word does not change. His program does not change and his bride does not change. We will stay with the word. It is more than life to us. It is the fountain of living waters. So far, that's all true. But the bride does not press, play, and obey and deny preachers from preaching because that was Jesus's commission. So, here's the statement in question. Quote, "The only thing we are commissioned to do is to hear the word, which is the vindicated voice of God that has been recorded and placed on the tapes. The only thing we see is not a creed, not a group of men. We see nothing else but Jesus, and he is the word made flesh in our day." End quote. Now I wondered where did our brother get this idea about the only commission we have to do is hear the word of God. I went back in going beyond the camp and brother Bram said this in paragraph 44 and notice brother Ram said quote and we find on this little camp up on the mountain transfiguration when they were commissioned to hear the only thing they was commissioned to do was to hear the word. Only thing they seen was not a creed. They never seen nothing else but Jesus and he is the word made flesh. end quote. So the pastor Brandham Tabernacle is using this quote to say that we only listen to brother Brandham. But friends, if you're honest, you can clearly see that's not what brother Brandham was saying. Brother Brandham was saying on Mount Transfiguration, Peter, James, and John were told to only hear the Lord Jesus Christ. They weren't to hear Peter's idea about building tabernacles. So the pastor Brandom Tabernacle is taking this quote out of context, out of biblical context, and also out of the context in which brother Brandham was speaking. And it's so sad. The followers of Brandom Tabernacle will eat that up. They'll think that their pastor is right with the word when in reality he's a million miles off the word of God. I also went back into going beyond the camp and brother Random actually preached the real great commission. So the pastor of bridem tabernacles taken away Jesus's great commission from Mark 16:15. Jesus said go and preach to all nations. He did not say go and press play to all nations and sit down preachers don't preach the gospel. Jesus said the exact opposite. Go and preach. So which commission do we want? Do we want Jesus's commission or the brand tabernacle's commission? I'll take Jesus's commission cuz I know Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever. And I know the brand of tabernacle is deceived and they have many false doctrines and levan has filled their church. But notice what brother Ram says. Brother Ram says, quote, "The God that sent Jesus went in Jesus and and the Jesus that sends you goes in you. He that believeth in me. The works that I do shall he do also. Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature, black, yellow, white, brown, whatever he might be. These signs shall follow them that believe. how far all the world and to every creature. End quote. So, Brother Ram says this many times throughout the message. We need to keep preaching because the gospel has not gone to all the world yet. Not every creature has heard the gospel. So, I love to find these examples of how worshippers of brother Brandham completely contradict brother Brandham in his own sermons. Brandom tabernacle is using going beyond the camp to try to make the sermon say something that it doesn't. But in the very same sermon, brother Ram is supporting the great commission, Jesus's great commission to go and preach to every creature unto the end of the world. We also see that in Matthew [clears throat] 28:1 19 and 20, which is a parallel text to Mark 16. It's the great commission text. And Jesus said, "Go ye therefore and teach all nations, teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you." And Jesus said, "Lo, I am with you. I'm with you preachers, even to the end of the world." world. So, we're not at the end of the world. So, Jesus' preachers are still preaching. They're not pressing play. That's a deceived man who would press play and obey. That's a deceived man who would deny Jesus's great commission. And and that's what Brandham Tabernacle is doing. They are denying and cancelling Jesus's great commission. They've changed Jesus's commission and they will answer to God for that. But let's pray for them to repent. The sad part is Brandham Tabernacle won't even open their Bibles to study their Bibles. In Mark 9:2, we find the story of the mount transfiguration where God said, "Hear ye him." So, we're commissioned to only hear Jesus. But in two places prior to that, in Mark 3:14, Jesus ordained the 12 to preach. And then in Mark 6:12, Jesus sent them out two by two to preach in the cities. So, two times before the Mount Transfiguration, Jesus sent them out to preach. The mount transfiguration was telling the preachers only hear the word of God from Jesus and then preach what Jesus teaches you and what Jesus says to you. And then twice after the mount transfiguration Jesus talks about preaching. In Mark 14:9, Jesus said the woman who washed Jesus' feet would be preached in all the world. So Jesus again supports preaching after the mount transfiguration experience. And then of course Mark 16:15 Jesus gives the great commission. Go and preach to all nations. So random tabernacle tape worshippers have no idea what the Bible says. They don't even care about the Bible really. Their actions prove that. It doesn't matter what their words say. Their actions prove that. They claim the Mount Transfiguration says we're only to hear. But they deny the other four verses. two verses before that where Jesus commisss preachers and two verses after that where Jesus commissioned preachers. These people are blind leaders of the blind. It's so sad. I'll skip down on the blog post here to the paragraph that starts with a man can say. Quote, "A man can say, I know and believe. Brother Brandham was a prophet. He was the seventh angel. He was the Elijah. We believe this message." then make some kind of excuse be whatever it is not to play the only vindicated voice of God in their church. There's something wrong somewhere now. Why? They had made their own camp. End quote. So the pastor random tabernacle with this paragraph is basically saying that living preachers are making excuses to not press play and obey. And of course that's not true. The Bible never tells preachers to press play and obey. Nor did brother Brandham ever tell people to just press play and obey. The sad part is Brandham Tabernacle is making excuses to not preach. They're making excuses to deny the Bible commission from Jesus Christ to preach the gospel. Living men preaching the living word of God. And he's right. Something is wrong somewhere. And the thing that's wrong is the false doctrines coming out of Brandham Tabernacle. Now the 25 false doctrines coming out of there. And they're the ones who made their own camp. Brother Brandham never set up a camp to just say press, play, and obey. All the preachers, stop preaching. Just sit down and let Brother Brandham preach. Brother Brham said he's just one pebble on the beach. Brother Random specifically said he wasn't the only one to preach. And I put a video out earlier this year how brother Brandham said, "Preach until Jesus returns." I'll leave a link to that in the description. So, Brandham Tabernacle is denying all these quotes where Brother Ram talks about preach until Jesus returns. And they do that to their own shame. Next, the Pastor Brandham Tabernacle says he's not trying to divide, but unite. But of course, he is dividing. And it's so sad. This shows him his motives. He wants everyone united around him, which is a denominational camp. He's made his own camp, his own denomination, and gone away from the word of God. His ministry looks nothing like Brother Brandham's ministry. He says, quote, I say these things not to separate the church. God's word does that. I want us to unite together, be one unit with each other and with him. But there's only one way to do that around the voice of God on the tapes. That's God's only thus sayith the Lord. End quote. And that's a lie. Brother Ram's words are not the only thus sayith the Lord. Brother Brandham said the Bible is thus sayith the Lord. Brother Ram said every word in the Bible is thus sayith the Lord. From 1953 resurrection of Lazarus. Brother Ram said, "That's the only book there is in existence is that Bible and I believe every word of it. Just I believe it just like it's just written there. I just ready to hang my soul on any phase and say it's thus sayeth the Lord. Yes, sir." End quote. Every phrase of the Bible is thus sayeth the Lord. And the bride has a voice. So here Brandham Tabernacle is trying to get rid of the voice of the bride which brother Ram said the bride has a voice in the church age book. Oh, God still has a voice for the people of the world even as he has given a voice to the bride. That voice is in the bride as we have said and we'll talk more on that later. So, who gave the bride a voice? It was God. So, Brandham tabernacle cannot take away the voice of the bride and say there's only one voice. Brother Brandham and the Bible say that the bride has a voice. The Bible says that in Revelation 22:17, the spirit and the bride say come. And brother Brandham said, "Yes, listen to the authenticated prophet of God who appears in this last age." Yes, we will, Brother Brandham. Because Brother Brandham said, "Preach until Jesus returns." Brother Ram said, "Don't change a thing about evangelism or the five-fold ministry." Brother Ram said, "Just say what the Bible says." And I just found a quote today from October 30th, ' 62. And brother Bram had a vision. He said in the vision, he screamed out, "I am commissioned to preach only the Bible." But the congregation walked on. Maybe I'll make a separate video about that. By God's grace, brother Rand was commissioned to only preach the Bible. And that's what Brandham Tabernacle is not doing. They're adding to the Bible. They're taking away from the Bible in at least 25 ways. And then, Brother Ram said, "What he says from God, the authenticated prophet of God, the bride will say." And that's exactly right. Brother Random never said, "Press, play, and obey." Brother Ram never said, "Sit at home for training for the rapture. Don't physically gather at church. Brother Ram never said that. Brandham Tabernacle saying many things the Bible doesn't say. And what they say the bride and what they will say will have already been said in the word. Oh, how comforting for the bride of Jesus Christ. We just have to say what the Bible says. Breadom Tabernacle is not saying what the Bible says. But the bride of Jesus Christ is saying what the Bible says. Now later on in the blog post they list a quote from going beyond the camp where brother Brandham said even this tape would meet in their homes or or their churches. And yes, brother Brandham acknowledge that maybe this tape of going beyond the camp would be played in homes or churches. But then Brandon Tabernacle's pastor uses that one quote and makes that quote thus sayeth the Lord. He says it in this paragraph. Quote, "Glory to God. Hear it. Read it. It's thus sayith the Lord." And not only did he say it, but by playing the tapes in your homes and churches, the great God of heaven will honor the sincerity of our hearts and heal the needy and give us whatever we have need of. End quote. How sad that Brandham Tabernacles pastor makes this quote, "Thus sayith the Lord." There is no thus sayith the Lord in this quote. Brother Ram said, "The way you know a quote is thus sayeth the Lord is if brother Bram says thus sayith the Lord." Of course, that's from He Cares Do You Care. Any honest message believer knows that from 1963. But I would ask the Brandham tabernacle pastor, what about all the other quotes here in going beyond the camp where brother Ram supports the great commission of preachers? Isn't that thus sayith the Lord? But no, only his select quotes that he likes are thus sayith the lord. So it shows the level of deception and delusion, the spirit of delusion, a strong delusion that this church is under, which is a great rebuke on them. The blog post goes on to say, quote, "This one quote proves the people are listening to their pastors are not hearing the word or they would challenge them and prove them by the word. We are in his perfect will and it is his perfect will to play the tapes in our churches." End quote. Know that one quote about playing tapes in going beyond the camp does not prove preachers are to sit down and just press play. Remember in going beyond the camp, brother Bram supported Jesus's great commission. quote, "Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature, black, yellow, white, brown, whatever he might be." How far to all the world and to every creature. End quote. In the same sermon, you have brother Ram supporting preaching and then just being thankful people are playing the tapes in churches and homes. Brother Ram was not trying to get rid of preaching because there's quotes inside the sermon where brother Random says, "Preach to all the world, to every creature." And this goes back to the lie that the Brandom Tabernacle pastor said. He said, "Yeah, thus sayith the Lord there in the perfect will of God to press play and disobey." And again, friends, I believe that's proof that this man is not a prophet and he would be a false prophet for saying, "Thus sayith the Lord, they're in the perfect will of God by denying Jesus's great commission to go and preach." Jesus never said, "Go and press play." Jesus said, "Go and preach." You cannot be in the perfect will of God by denying the perfect word of God, the Holy Bible. Romans 12:1 and2 says you can prove the perfect will of God. Brandom Tabernacle cannot prove preachers are to stop preaching and they're to sit down and just press play and bury their preaching talents in the ground like Matthew 25 says. And then everyone's to sit at home and not physically gather more as we see that day approaching and break Hebrews 10:24 and 25. They are deceived. Then the Brandom Tabernacle pastor says, quote, I'm not misplacing or misquoting the word like so many say. I do. Hear it and read it for yourself. End quote. No, he's deceived. He is misplacing and misquing the word of God. He can hear and read for himself earlier in the sermon when brother Ram said, "Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature." How far? All the world and to every creature. He's taking one quote about listening to tapes and deleting all the other quotes about preaching. That is a strong delusion. That's the very definition of a strong delusion. Picking and choosing, picking one quote about tape playing and deleting all the quotes about preaching. And the final quote we'll look at says, quote, "It's so easy and so perfect. Just press play and hear the voice of God speak to you. Say amen to every word you hear. You don't even have to understand it. You just have to believe it." End quote. Yes, it is easy to just press play because you don't have to labor as the Bible says as a workman needeth not being ashamed rightly dividing the word of truth. Yes, it's easier to deny your gift and to bury your gift in the ground. But a true child of God will not bury their gift in the ground. A child of God will take the harder way just like brother Ram took the harder way. And there's a great reward for him because he chose the harder way like Danny Henry's thus sayith the Lord prophecy about brother Brandham. And every true man of God will choose the harder way to preach the word of God, to study, to labor, to fast and preach God's living word behind a pulpit and not sit down and press play and disobey the word of God. And no, you can't say amen to every word you hear from brother Brandham. Brother Ram said women have sperm. Would Brandham Tabernacle say amen to that? Brother Ram said total annihilation to all the world by 1977. Would Brandham Tabernacle say amen to that? Brother Ram said Billy Paul was his promised Joseph in 1951. Does Brandham Tabernacle say amen to that? Brother Random said the third person of the Trinity burned in his heart in 1952. Does Random Tabernacle say amen to that? Do they have the third person of the Trinity in their heart as well? This proves press play and obey false preachers are lazy. They just want the easy way out. And Satan always offers the easy way out. But God's people will not take the easy way out. God's people will take the way with the Lord's despised few. And just like brother Random said, it's the big churches that are off the word of God. Look at this big movement. Look at the millions following Brandham Tabernacle today. The easy way attracts all the people. It's the broad way. It's not the narrow way that leads to life. It's not the hard way. Jesus said, "Few there be that find the narrow road that leads to life. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; It's the big churches with all the millions of dollars, the brand new buildings which Brennham Tabernacle renovated and made a brand new building. They're the ones who get off the word of God. And we should say amen to every word of the Bible that we hear from living men preaching the living word of God. Brother Ram said there's only two seeds. There's the seed of God and the seed of the devil. Brother Ram said, quote, "One tree is for the word of God exactly as God gave it and loves it and obeys it. The other tree is from the seed that is antitheord of God and changes it where it wants to. End quote. So which seed today is trying to believe the Bible to love and obey the Bible exactly as God gave it? Where is tape playing and silencing preachers in the Holy Bible? It's not in there. So their movement is of the wrong seed. I hope they can be saved. I hope they can repent of their false doctrines. But they do not believe the Bible exactly as God gave it. and they don't love the five-fold ministry the way Paul gave it through the direction of the Lord Jesus Christ and they do not obey that. They make tape boys the true five-fold ministry. That's a lie. That's false doctrine. That's heresy. Tape boys are not in the Bible. They're not part of the five-fold ministry. In closing, friends, hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God. Friends, God never gave Brandom Tabernacle any right to change the great commission. They cannot change what Jesus gave us in Mark 16 and Matthew 28. The brand of tabernacles is ruling their people by the rulership of man and not the rule of the Holy Ghost. Brother Bram said he believed in the rule of the word of God according to Hebrews 13:7. Remember them which have the rule over you whose who have spoken unto you the word of God whose faith follow considering the end of their conversation. Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. Brother Ram said the Holy Ghost fililled men of God rule by the word of God. And that rule is found, of course, in Ephesians 4 with the five-fold ministry. The true five-fold ministry does not change one word of the Bible. They only say what the Bible says. But Brandham tabernacle is ruled by man because they break the word of God as Mark 10:42-44 warns us about. The Lord Jesus warned us about this rule of man who made their own camp, their own camp of creeds about press, play, and obey, sit at home, no living preachers. Every word on tape is thus sayith the Lord which is heresy. That's a rule by man. But Jesus called them to him and saith unto them ye know that they which are counted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them. And their great ones exercise authority upon them. And that's exactly what Brandham Tabernacle has done. They lord over the people. They exercise authority on them outside the word of God. They tell them don't go to church. They say make your home a church. But that's not what the Bible says. The Bible says gather more as you see that day approaching. Now in the Bible days, of course, they had to have home churches. That's because they didn't have enough money to build their own churches and have a public place of worship. But now we have that ability by the grace of God. Just like brother Brandham had that ability and brother Brandham did not set at home. He went physically to church and he ordained everyone to do that. And I'll end with this quote from Christ's mystery of God revealed. Brother Ram said, quote, "If God is in your heart, you can't hardly wait for them doors to open out yonder, to get in here to fellowship with your brothers. If you don't don't feel that way, then I tell you, it's time you got to praying." And then he quotes Hebrews 10:24 and2, a Bible-based prophet. Thank God for Brother Bram's ministry cuz we're in the last days where the Bible exalted or exhorted us to to much more as we see that day approaching to love one another with Christian love and divine love to assemble ourselves together in heavenly places and Christ Jesus and love one another. This will all men know you are my disciples when you have love for the other. That's right. Stay right together. End quote. So this proves random tabernacle does not have the love of God because they sit at home and they neglect the assembling of the saints together where we're where we are to provoke one another unto good works as Hebrews 10 says preach the word of God bring us to a unity of the faith as Ephesians 4 8-16 says and bring us into the fullness of the stature of Jesus Christ that's only done through living preachers that's not done by pressing play and obey that's disobedient to the word of God so we can thank God if God is in our heart we still go to church we still here. Living preachers, we do not change Jesus's great commission. Thank God for the Holy Ghost that's here to help us obey Jesus's great commission. We can't wait for the church doors to open to obey Jesus's great commission. But let's pray for the tape worshippers. Father God, I pray you'd bring these tape worshippers to repentance. May they see all the times they've broken the word of God. They've made their own man-made denominational camp. I pray they would repent of their sins. open their eyes from their blindness, dear God. And may they only say what the Bible says. May they stop adding to Brother Ram's quotes. May they stop misapplying Brother Ram's quotes, misinterpreting Brother Ram's quotes. Help them to repent of their sins. Give them eyes of enlightenment to the word of God. May they believe every word of God is thus, sayith the Lord. and may they reject the deity spirit that idolizes brother Brandham and every word on his tapes. Lord have mercy on them. I pray you draw them to repentance in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. If you have any questions, concerns, or testimonies [music] about this video, please contact me. God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire [music] of your heart.
