TRANSCRIPT
========================================
remember Moses also that great leader God should have killed him when he went down there to glorify himself but smiting that rock and said you see what I can do in other words you rebels must we fetch your water from this rock and he smote it and the waters didn't come he smoted it again what did he do he testified of the weakness of the of Christ because Christ was that rock That's The Headstone instead of smiting it or speaking to it it was smitten once remember God told Moses over ex says go out and I'll Stand before before you up on the Rock and smite The Rock and he smok The Rock and brought forth Waters God said the next time go speak to the Rock and he'll bring forth his water but Moses want to show he had a little authority a little power so he said I'll bring you water out of this Rock God should have killed him far God should have separated him now he broke God's law right there C he spoke of the weakness of Christ he has to be smitten the second time Christ is only smitten once now speak to the Rock and it brings forth its water but what was it let's look at the old man he's 120 someone said to me not long ago said God is an unjust God said because he let Moses down at you told them Hebrews for 40 years and that Wilderness out there he let him down and then when he let him go to Promised Land I said oh nonsense no he didn't let Moses down he went to the promised land about 700 years later he was saw up on top of Mount Transfiguration as loud as he ever was standing talking to Jesus before he went to Calvary him and Elijah standing together talking to Moses Elijah appeared to Jesus Peter James and John on Mount Transfiguration he was not dead he was alive God didn't let him down he was in Palestine now look before he died he climbed up Mount Neo that morning when he knew he was going you done stripped Aon put his clothes up another took his own Rob put up on Joshua commanded him to stay with them precepts and when he climbed up to the top of Mount Neo went through the valley of the Plains knowing he's going up there the die climbed up on Mount Nebo and up to pisga while he was standing up there God said look over in the land I want you to see it Moses you could have went over there but you know what you did down after the rock that day you glorified yourself I think that's why it's going to be a great trouble with a lot of us people today go down there at the Rock and you glorified yourself but notice when he got ready to die there stood The Rock Amen he must have stepped over on the Rock there pisga and God there cared him but he must have rose again somewhere because he was alive he's a type of Christ there he was then on Mount Transfiguration hundreds of years later over in Palestine see the grace of God provided the Rock Amen oh my when I think of Abraham of all the mistakes that he made and Moses and his mistakes but when Abraham's commentary was written when the div commentary was written when Paul wrote Abraham's commentary he never mentioned one thing about Abraham's unbelief no no there wasn't even accounted to him he said Abraham standard not at the promise of God you unbelief but was strong giving praise to God Amen my humble prayer is before the grace of God that you're this morning I hope mine wrote like that that he won't see my mistakes that when my commentary is written in my obituary that it won't be R out I made mistakes and done wrong but he'll only see the things that I tried to do for him may they just be coming what does that he'll take the grace of God that I believe in and that's where I'm solely trusting for upon my own marriage I can no more go in and under the rest but upon the grace of God I'm depending yes it's Grace Hallelujah that I'm depending on there was a rock there when Moses got ready to die Moses was a type of the church a type of the organization the law but Moses glorified himself and instead of glorifying God as a perfect type before they crossed over into the promised land and that's just exactly what Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Pentecost Lutheran and all has done tonight they're seeing who can have the biggest crowd or the best dressed or the biggest church or the finest pews they're trying to glorify their organization until God's moved out that's right that's right but remember Joshua was riding the church all time he was the one who Tak them over and today the very signs and wonders and phenomenals that's been in the church every time they had a Revival through any age these signs has broke out in the church and they've been all down through all these Church ages just like Joshua come with Moses all the way through but the church age ceased with Moses and Joshua took the children of God into the promised land and I believe that the age has come now the miraculous phenomenal the baptism of the spirit and power and signs and wonders this great pouring out of God's spirit in the last days and that's the thing that'll bring Faith into the people that'll take a Rapture in faith that'll take the church into Glory I believe it how can the church be raptured when we haven't even got faith for healing yeah we got to have Rapture in faith first that's right how that God moves by his Spirit signs and wonders begin to follow everywhere God begins to move signs and wonders follows God the world has always stood off and criticized from the from Adam down they've done it every time and it's nothing new today that you should be criticized for accepting Jesus Christ and for his now if you accepted in some fanaticism or are persecuted for the wrong thing while you deserve it but now look if you have really God is working with you proven himself by Bible evidence of signs and wonders then you rejoice and be exceedingly glad for great is your reward in heaven yes
