TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] there's only going to be two classes of people in the last days both of them going to wear Mark the mark of God is the baptism of the Holy Spirit without a shadow down greetings friends in the mattress name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to examine the origins of the mark of the beast from the time of Cain and show how that Mark of the Beast has advanced from the time of Cain to the present day hi friends I'm Jesse Smith pastor bride of Christ Fellowship here in akan Ohio USA and I defend the original Gospel of Jesus Christ that he revealed to St Paul and then had to restore through Martin Luther John Wesley and the late Prophet William brandham 1909 to 1965 I also defend brother Ram's Godly Christian character this video is sort of a follow-up to the video I put out on June 24th called who is the future Antichrist or false prophet it'll be the pope of Rome as brother random taught the reason I say it's kind of a follow-up is because it's in the same chapter of my 2021 book The 12 New Testament Mysteries revealed it's in chapter n called The Mystery of Babylon the great and today's specific teaching you'll find on pages 587 through 589 and you can also listen to this book free on my YouTube channel as well just type in audio book The 12 New Testament Mysteries chapter 9 the mystery of Babylon the the great before getting too far into this subject I want to say that there seems to be a little difference between the mark of the beast during the Great Tribulation period and this was kind of like a fresh Revelation to me as I wrote this book back in 2021 so perhaps in the next video or future video I'll go over the mark of the beast during the Great Tribulation because it can be taken in three different ways and remember you must have this Mark to buy or sell during the Great Tribulation of course the true bride of Jesus Christ wants to be gone right before the Great Tribulation starts in the pre-tribulation Rapture the Rapture of the Gentile bride of Jesus Christ as taught in 1 Thessalonians chap 4 and 1 Corinthians 15 so there's three ways to take the mark of the beast during the Great Tribulation period you can take the mark in the right hand or forehead so that's one way the mark in the right hand or forehead second way is through the mark of the name of the Beast and this is according to Revelation 13:17 and the third and final way is the mark of the number of his name and there is some overlap of course but I love how the Bible the scriptures dovetail so we get a clear picture on the mark of the beast but let's look at this topic here the mark of the beast the origin of it and then how it's Advanced here up to the current Day by God's grace so according to the Book of Genesis Cain is the first prefigure of someone receiving the mark of the beast Cain knew the perfect will of God but rejected it he knew God's perfect will was animal sacrifice but he brought a different sacrifice God even told him if if you bring the right sacrifice you'll rule over your brother in Genesis 4 but Cain like his father the wicked one the serpent Cain's father was the serpent not Satan but a serpent it was Satan's spirit that possessed the serpent but Cain's father was the serpent Cain blatantly rejected God's word and then he soon murdered his brother it also seems God gave Cain a physical Mark so that other men would not kill him as he wasted his life wandering like a fugitive and a vagabond this is in Genesis 41-15 so there's the origin of the mark of the beast in the Book of Genesis now don't forget friends of course this is the most important part God has a mark as well in the New Testament it's called the Seal of the Holy Ghost or the baptism of the Holy Ghost see acts 1:6 see also Ephesians 1:13 and Ephesians 4:30 there's only going to be two classes of people in the last days both of them going to wear a mark the mark of God is is the baptism of the Holy Spirit without a Shadow of Doubt I preached that not long ago right here amen by the holy spirit's help and the word of God proved it that the Seal of God is the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen Ephesians 4:30 says grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you're sealed until the day of your Redemption without the Holy Spirit you are not sealed but the holy spirit is God sealed and then that all that was not sealed with the Holy Spirit was Tu on the mark of the beast and the mark of the beast is the mark of apostasy which is rejecting the Holy Spirit see what I mean now Genesis also prefigures the mark of God as well it's in Genesis 4:26 and to Seth un to him also so there was born a son and he called his name Enos then began men to call upon the name of the Lord so Cain leaves the presence of God because he brought the wrong sacrifice but Seth would of course continue the right sacrifice animal sacrifice and he would have been calling upon the name of the Lord now today for us that's Believers calling on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ not titles father son Holy Ghost but the Lord Jesus Christ bringing the true sacrifice of worship the Bible said the sacrifice of God Are Spiritual sacrifices Thanksgiving doing good to one another communicating with one another being Kings and Priests unto God ruling over sin as spiritual Kings over sin flesh hell and the devil and also as priests making intercession for others praying for other people bringing their needs Before the Throne of God the Bible says that Jesus ever lives to make intercession and can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities so as Holy Ghost filled Christians that's part of our duty we're not saved by that but that's that's what we love to do because God's called us to do that by the grace of God so Satan's spiritual Mark is received when unbelievers reject God's seal of the Holy Ghost by disobeying his path to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost and God's path to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the stature of perfect man Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness and then the cap or The Headstone or the capping stone or the Seal of the Holy Ghost is Charity God's divine love for God is love according to the book of First John so the opposite of those seven attributes on the statute of perfect man would be unbelief because unbelief is the opposite of Faith hypocrisy that's the opposite of virtue reasoning that's the opposite of knowledge sensuality that's the opposite of temperance impatience that's the opposite of patience irreverence that's the opposite of godliness selfishness that's the opposite of Brotherly kindness and then rebell ion or hatred that's the opposite of the love of God now remember there's wise and foolish virgins According To Jesus and of course the entire rest of the Bible the Bible always teaches there's two kinds of Believers and two kinds of unbelievers that's what brother Bram taught us in the church age book there's four classes of people brother Ram tells us and so Holy Ghost filled Christians will have all those attributes all those anointings now foolish virgins may just have one of those they may just have faith that's what they're saved by we're saved by grace through faith and then there's other levels of foolish virgins they might have virtue some knowledge some Temperance some patience some godness some brotherly kindness so it's very plain there's wise and foolish virgins all throughout the scripture now getting back to unbelievers the unbelievers after Cain did not receive a physical mark but instead they took a spiritual Mark for rejecting God's path to Salvation so the wicked evil cike rejectors of God's word and God's perfect will are termed as reprobate in the Old Testament and the new Testament reprobate in the Greek means a rejected mind so it's because the sinner rejected God's will for the last time that God rejects them and gives them over to reprobate mind so the term reprobate is used in Jeremiah 6:30 and then Romans 1:28 2 Timothy 3:8 and Titus 1:16 according to Romans 1: 28-32 God gives a person over to a reprobate mind who continually refuses God's love and who refuses to retain God's word in his mind while having pleasure in committing Wicked abominable acts and the example there is homosexuality because God's love is so great his eyes or Spirit Run to and fro throughout the whole Earth according to 2 Chronicles 169 he's seeking each soul and offering each Soul salvation the father is always seeking true worshippers according to John 4:23 so there'll be no excuses for The reprobates Who reject God's continual love his continual offer of Love on the day of judgement because God has revealed his power and godhead to every person through his creation and also the human body and human Spirit that's according to Romans 1: 19 and 20 so rejection is the key word for people that take the mark of the beast from the time of Cain to the current day remember God desires all men to be saved 1 Timothy 2:4 but few there be that find the narrow road that leads to life according to Jesus in Matthew 7:14 this means most people reject God's gracious offer of love and forgiveness through the cross there's also another foreshadowing of taking the mark of the beast in the Old Testament it's found in Deuteronomy 15:17 and exodus 21:6 it's called the all it's a physical Mark the a was a permanent earring giving to Jewish indentured servants who purposely rejected freedom and wanted to remain as servants forever Jewish indentured servants serve 6 years but the seventh year they could go free if they wanted again according to Exodus 21:6 and Deuteronomy 15:17 these scriptures detail this Mark in the ear for these indentured servants who rejected their god-given inheritance which included all the blessings of the land of their forefathers bring him to the door or to the post that's the the calvary all right and his master shall bore his ear will bore his ear through with a all and he shall serve him forever amen amen what do you mean brother brand if you hear the gospel truth and you refuse to walk in it then God marks your ear where you'll never hear it no [Music] [Applause] more you cross the line between life and death then you go on with your organization denomination the rest day forever walk in the light children that's right you'll serve that Master forever so today unbelievers show their spiritual ears are marked with Satan's Mark when they reject the good news of the Gospel offering them freedom from sin through the Holy Spirit they choose to love sin and remain a slave to it or servant to sin rather than ruling over sin just like Cain failed to rule over sin God said your sin is right at the door it's very close to you if you don't rule over it it's going to rule over you but thank God True Believers submit to God's spirit and live righteously and godly in this present World in closing friends hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God as a nice followup to the video about the Antichrist the person the Antichrist the false prophet which is the pope of Rome friends let's do all in our power the Bible says give all diligence Peter says it twice in second Peter chapter 1 give all diligence to add to your faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness keep adding the attributes and the anointing of the Holy Ghost to your life remember friends let's fight the good fight of Faith it's going to be a fight to overcome unbelief hypocrisy reasonings sensuality impatience irreverence selfishness and Rebellion or hatred remember with man these things are impossible but with God all things are possible the last scripture I'll use is Matthew 5:6 I love this verse when it comes to the topic of being born again or being marked with God's seal blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled friends we have to hunger for the word of God we have to hunger for an experience with God more than we hunger time on our phones or time on our tablets we must hunger for God more than we desire big numbers in the bank account or large numbers in attendance at our church services we must hunger for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and God said Jesus said if we hunger and thirst we shall be filled what a promise may God grant you his grace and mercy to receive this wonderful promise May each one of us hunger and thirst until we're filled with the Holy Ghost and we're so thankful for God sending his Prophet The Late William Marin brandham to teach us these things many of his sermons speak of these subjects such as Mark of the Beast the token you must be born again and so many more wonderful sermons if you need links to those just let me know if you have any any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
