TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] Revelation chapters 17 and 18. the themes of these chapters include the description judgment and destruction of the great City mystery Babylon and a final call to come out of Babylon most of the descriptions of this one woman the great and also called the mother of harlots occurs in the 17th chapter this mother Harlot is the mother Church of false Christian churches the Roman Catholic Church please see our three-part video series on mystery Babylon the Roman Catholic Church for an in-depth teaching that undoubtedly proves with 14 proofs that this great is the Unfaithful idolatrous Church the Roman Catholic Church another resource is chapter nine of my 2021 book The 12 New Testament Mysteries revealed chapter 9 is about mystery Babylon the Roman Catholic Church if you can't afford a copy of this book I'll be happy to mail you a hard copy if you live in the United States or a PDF if you live outside the United States the audiobook for chapter nine is also available for free on my YouTube channel the judgment and destruction of mystery Babylon is found in chapter 18 verses 6 through 24 which comes in one hour of one day according to verses 8 and 10. the merchants of the earth who lived in luxury just like the Roman Catholic Church Vatican officials weep and wail over the vatican's destruction which shows that there is a strong connection between the religious influence of the Roman Catholic Church Upon government leaders and their economies the symbols and key Revelations are numerous and include the Beast the mother Harlot the sitting of the Harlot on the waters and the Beast the B7 heads the harlot's fornication drunkenness riches and colors the great City ten horns the call to come out of her my people The Book of Life her sorceries and her guilt for every murder committed the Beast of Revelation 17 verse 3 is the Roman Kingdom which has seven heads and ten horns because it has the same description we have already taught on in Revelation Chapter 13 Verse 1. this Roman kingdom is the fourth Gentile Kingdom from Daniel chapter 2. when Daniel interpreted King Nebuchadnezzar's dream of a great image see Daniel 2 verse 31. this Roman Kingdom will continue to rule the Gentile World until Christ Returns the stone cut out of the mountain and destroys the image according to Daniel 2 verse 45. it is important to note that in Revelation 17 verse 8 this Beast will Ascend out of the bottomless pit and go into perdition or its own destruction which is most likely the full power and strength of the Roman Kingdom since the kingdom of Rome is already here and ruling today in the Roman Catholic Church the mother Harlot is a symbol of the Unfaithful Roman Catholic church for a woman always symbolizes a church as seen in Acts 7 verse 38 and Ephesians 5 32. the Roman Catholic Church is the mother of false Christian churches or the First Christian Church that denominated thus limiting the Holy Spirit and accepting man's leadership instead of God's leadership this mother is a harlot because she is unfaithful to Christ and Christ is the word of God and this woman shares her false doctrines or abominable teachings with all the nations of the world notice that this mother denomination has daughters or children according to Revelation 2 verse 23 which are the Protestant churches that have denominated either by written Creeds and bylaws or by adherence to her false doctrines such as the three-person Trinity of Gods the sitting of the Harlot on the waters is a symbol of the Roman Catholic Church having influence over multitudes of people or Waters according to Revelation 17 verse 15. this is proven by the fact that she has churches in nearly every nation on Earth and sends ambassadors to those Nations as well the sitting of the Harlot on the Beast is a symbol that the Roman Catholic Church rides the power and influence of the Demonic Spirit of Rome also known as the Beast the spirit of Rome which divides and conquers is empowering the Roman Catholic church today and will continue to crush every nation under Heaven according to Daniel 7 verse 23 and Revelation 14 verse 8. the beast's seven heads are interpreted in Revelation 17 verse 9 as seven mountains or Hills according to the Greek Lexicon these Seven Hills are the Seven Hills of ancient Rome on which ancient Rome was built and was in close proximity to the harlot's fornication is a symbol of unfaithfulness to the true teachings of Jesus Christ and His Holy Bible the Roman Catholic church has given her love to idolatrous statues ritualistic prayers and many other heretical doctrines of men proving that she is unfaithful to Christ the word the harlot's drunkenness is a symbol of a blind spiritual condition according to Isaiah 29 verses 9 and 10. the Roman Catholic Church cannot see the truth of God's word and has been so blind it has not been able to discern true Christian teaching for nearly two thousand years the Roman Catholic Church is guilty of instituting the Inquisition which is an undeniable historical example of its persecution and murder of millions of Protestants and therefore the Roman Catholic Church is drunken with the blood of the Saints according to Revelation 17 verse 6 Protestant historians record medieval Roman Catholic Church practices in the most negative terms and recall the massive Corruption of the Catholic church leaders including adulteries bribes extravagant papal art and architecture projects brothels and most destructive Wars of conquest such as the Catholic Crusades the colors and Riches of this Harlot church are denounced in Revelation 17 verse 4 and chapter 18 verses 16 and 17. the colors of the Roman Catholic Church are purple and Scarlet which are commonly worn by priests archbishops and the pope and are warned during annual festivals and holy days the Roman Catholic Church is Rich with gold precious stones and Pearls as explained in Revelation 17 verse 4. the Bible portrays this woman or church as a wealthy Church the Vatican gets Free Will donations from more than one billion Catholics worldwide the Vatican also earns interest on its Investments and has flocks of tourists and visitors for its museums Galleries and libraries which hold their Priceless collections the mass Services of the Roman Catholic Church showcase golden cups instruments and precious stones just as the Bible foretold this Harlot is also called that great city as this Harlot Church Reigns over the kings of the Earth what other church can claim to be a great City and have influence politically and spiritually over the Earth's leaders other than the Vatican City which includes the Roman Catholic church and her Pope the Vatican city-state is the epitome of church and state the Vatican City is the world's smallest fully independent nation-state the city-state is tax free and has its own telephone system post office Gardens astronomical Observatory radio station banking system and Pharmacy as well as a contingent of Swiss guards responsible for the personal safety of the Pope since 1506. the ten horns of the Beast are symbolic for Ten Kings according to chapter 17 verses 12-14 these Ten Kings are rulers of Nations that will give power to the Beast or Roman Church for one hour during the tribulation period but then turn and hate her and Destroy her with fire according to Revelation 17 verses 16 and 17. come out of her my people is a key Revelation that teaches all of God's children will come out of false churches who teach false Doctrine including the Roman Catholic Church the mother of denominations and all the daughters of the mother and these daughters are the Protestant denominations who have taught the Roman Catholic Church's false Doctrine Revelation 18 verses 1 through 5 is one final plea to persuade God's people to come out of her the Roman Catholic church so God's people will not receive her plagues as always God will not destroy the righteous with the wicked like he promised in Genesis 18 verse 25 and God in his mercy and foreknowledge will call all the elect Believers out of false Christian churches The Book of Life is a key Revelation from Revelation 17 verse 8 because a person's judgment about the Roman Catholic church and its Protestant daughters reveals if the person's name is on the Book of Life or not from the foundation of the world this means a person's Eternal destination may be known by their attitude toward the Roman Catholic church and her daughters the Protestant churches Revelation 17 verse 8 says that all the people's names who Wonder or admire the beauty and power of the Roman Catholic Church are not written on the Book of Life meaning they will not have eternal life and God knew this before the world was founded the Bible repeatedly declares the foreknowledge of God in regards to the Salvation of souls as unbelievers or make-believers will not have their names on The Book of Life or their names will be removed from The Book of Life as Jesus stated in Revelation 3 verse 5. in contrast true born-again Christians were chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world according to Ephesians 1 verse 4 which means their names were written on the Lamb's Book of Life before the world was founded and will remain on the book for eternity and can never be blotted out the sorceries of the Roman Catholic Church will deceive not some but all nations according to Revelation 18 verse 23 every nation under Heaven which includes the United States Russia and China will be deceived by the spiritual wickedness that will fill the pope Antichrist during the tribulation because second Thessalonians 2 verse 9 says that the person of the Antichrist will work by the power of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders this should Inspire true Christians at all times to always prove All Things by the Bible as first Thessalonians 5 verse 21 says no matter what sign or wonder a person or group can produce Christians must discern the voice behind any potential sign as Deuteronomy 13 verses 1 through 11 teaches and this text teaches a true voice behind a true sign from God will not turn us away from obedience to the written word of God the commands of God the mother Harlot Roman Catholic Church is guilty of all the murders done upon the Earth according to Revelation 18 verse 24 and in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints and of all that were slain upon the Earth without going into conspiracies this observation must be made that this Bible verse does in fact put all the guilt of all slain upon the Earth upon the Roman Catholic Church this makes us wonder about the influence of the Roman Catholic Church behind every war terrorist attack and murder committed on the Earth recall that the Roman Catholic Church is a cage of unclean and hateful Birds the timing of events is as follows in Revelation 17 verse 8 the Beast ascends out of the bottomless pit and Revelation 11 verse 7 told us the timing of this event it is after the three and a half year testimony of the two Jewish Witnesses or two Jewish prophets is complete so we know the Roman Catholic church or Roman spirit will come into full power after the first half of Daniel's 70th week is complete which will also be three and a half years after the Rapture of the New Testament bride of Jesus Christ in fact the majority of the events in Revelation 17 and 18 take place after the first three and a half years of the tribulation period and include first the Ten Kings symbolizes ten horns that give their power unto the Beast for one hour and make war against the lamb but the lamb will overcome them which is a reference to the battle of Armageddon see Revelation 13 16 and 19. which takes place during the last three and a half years of The Seven Year tribulation period the battle of Armageddon takes place after the seven trumpets and seven vials have been poured out in God's Wrath against the unrepentant world and second the ten horns or Kings will then turn on the or Roman Catholic church and hate her destroying her with fire this destruction of the Vatican City or great city is detailed in Revelation 18 verses 8-24 we believe that the fire that destroys this immoral woman will be some type of atomic bomb that Russia will drop on the Vatican City as prophesied by God's Prophet William Branham who said quote and remember I say this is God's Prophet this Russian Empire will drop an atomic bomb of some sort on the Vatican City and Destroy in one hour thus saith the Lord end quote if you'd like more Bible scriptures quotations or if you have any questions about the Book of Revelation please contact us God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
