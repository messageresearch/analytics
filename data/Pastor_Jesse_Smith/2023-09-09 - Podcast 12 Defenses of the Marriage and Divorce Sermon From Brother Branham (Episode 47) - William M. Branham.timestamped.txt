[0:03] [Music]
[0:08] God bless you and welcome to the
[0:11] defending the message podcast I'm your
[0:12] host Pastor Jesse Smith in today's
[0:15] podcast I'd like to do a rebuttal on a
[0:18] recent podcast that attacked brother
[0:21] branham's February 1965 sermon marriage
[0:24] and divorce this podcast was released
[0:26] August 21st and normally I don't call
[0:29] names of the accusers of brother Branham
[0:32] and I'll try not to do that again in
[0:33] this podcast
[0:35] but I felt a response and rebuttal to
[0:38] this podcast was necessary I'd been
[0:40] recently studying marriage and divorce
[0:42] myself and then this podcast came out so
[0:44] I felt it was led to the Lord that I
[0:45] should respond and show how brother
[0:47] random sermon on marriage and divorce
[0:49] was certainly inspired of the Holy Ghost
[0:51] so by God's grace I have 12 points I
[0:54] want to make about this podcast 12
[0:57] points I want to refute from their sad
[1:00] podcast from August 21st
[1:02] but first I want to share a few quotes
[1:04] from marriage and divorce that have
[1:05] meant a lot to me over the years the
[1:07] first is that brother Branham said what
[1:10] caused all the Mix-Ups and he said two
[1:12] reasons false teaching and not waiting
[1:14] on the Lord
[1:15] and friends I found that as a pastor
[1:17] with counseling people and talking to
[1:19] people the reason people have problems
[1:21] with their marriages
[1:23] is many times they did not wait on the
[1:25] Lord before getting married they didn't
[1:26] pray and fast enough about who they
[1:28] should marry and then secondly they were
[1:30] taught wrong about marriage and divorce
[1:33] they didn't have the full scriptural
[1:34] Revelation on marriage and divorce
[1:37] so let's listen to the quote good man
[1:40] all mixed up I've done it false teaching
[1:45] [Music]
[1:46] exactly not waiting on the Lord
[1:50] second I love this quote from brother
[1:51] Brandon where he said sisters and
[1:54] brothers must flee to the cross
[1:57] so we know brother Branham hammers
[1:59] immoral women in marriage and divorce
[2:01] but I love this quote because he says
[2:03] man also have to flee to the cross
[2:06] let's listen to the quote he still got
[2:08] her
[2:10] she better flee to the cross
[2:12] like man too
[2:15] the third and final quotes are brother
[2:17] Ram saying this is an awful strong thing
[2:19] so he knew his sermon was making a very
[2:22] strong case against immoral women and
[2:25] then he says I'm not talking to you
[2:27] sisters he said I'm talking of the
[2:29] immoral women now
[2:30] so it's very important to understand
[2:32] this was a strong sermon against immoral
[2:34] women brother random's marriage and
[2:36] divorce sermon was not attacking Godly
[2:38] sisters sisters who live holy who walk
[2:40] under the anointing of the Holy Ghost it
[2:42] was an awful strong sermon against him
[2:44] or women let's listen to the quotes this
[2:47] is an awful strong thing I didn't know
[2:50] how to bring it out
[2:52] I'm talking to the immoral now not two
[2:54] sisters
[2:56] and one last thing before we get into
[2:58] the 12 points of rebuttal is that I
[3:00] should add a disclaimer this podcast is
[3:03] going to cover a few sensitive subjects
[3:05] so I do not recommend it for children so
[3:08] adults and parents if you're listening
[3:09] please do not allow your younger
[3:10] children to listen to this podcast
[3:14] thank you
[3:18] let's begin with Point number one point
[3:20] number one is that the accusers of
[3:22] brother Branham claim they were going to
[3:24] do a deep dive into this sermon and they
[3:26] claim this was the most anti-biblical
[3:28] sermon brother Branham ever preached
[3:30] this is a bunch of nonsense and of
[3:33] course as proof that they did not do a
[3:35] deep dive they ignored the scriptures
[3:37] brother random use to teach marriage and
[3:39] divorce like Matthew 5 32 where Jesus
[3:42] said whosoever shall put away his wife
[3:44] saving for the cause of fornication
[3:46] causes her to commit adultery this is
[3:48] one of the main scriptures on marriage
[3:50] and divorce and of course these accusers
[3:51] of brother Branham did not cover this
[3:53] scripture
[3:54] secondly they spliced some of my brother
[3:56] Ram's quotes and they left out important
[3:58] context
[4:00] such as when brother Branham said Satan
[4:02] was co-equal to God but they left out
[4:04] the part all but Creator so shame on
[4:07] them for criticizing certain phrases and
[4:10] neglecting the entire statement the
[4:12] entire context of brother Branham and
[4:15] also regarding context they
[4:16] misunderstand brother Ram's statement
[4:18] about his newspaper articles regarding
[4:21] women and how snakes were able to give
[4:24] women certain Sensations which we'll get
[4:26] to a little later
[4:27] Point number two is that brother random
[4:30] said this marriage and divorce sermon
[4:31] was thus saith the Lord all the way
[4:33] through and brother braham's accusers
[4:35] are completely misunderstanding this
[4:37] statement this statement thus saith the
[4:39] Lord all the way through does not mean
[4:41] every single word on the sermon
[4:43] anyone who've studied brother Brown's
[4:45] messages knows you have to be very
[4:47] careful how you interpret his thus say
[4:49] the Lord's statements
[4:50] there's two examples that prove not
[4:52] every word in the entire sermon was thus
[4:54] say the Lord
[4:55] brother Brandon said Jacob had at least
[4:57] a dozen wives scripturally That's not
[5:00] accurate he only had four wives
[5:02] and of course I'm open to correction if
[5:04] anybody can show me how Jacob had more
[5:06] than a dozen wives Genesis 31 verses 48
[5:10] to 55 show that Jacob swore to Laban
[5:13] he'd take no other wives other than the
[5:16] four that he already had
[5:17] and then a second example that not every
[5:19] word was thus saith the Lord in the
[5:21] sermon is that brother random said David
[5:22] was not pretty but had character
[5:26] and of course we don't believe David was
[5:27] pretty like a woman but the Bible said
[5:29] David was fair countenance and that word
[5:32] fair in Hebrew means Fair beautiful or
[5:36] handsome so in the context brother Brown
[5:38] was trying to show an attractive outward
[5:40] appearance is one of Satan's deceptions
[5:43] to try to deceive people and that's true
[5:45] but here it just seems like brother
[5:47] Brandon forgot that David was called a
[5:50] fair countenance which means a very
[5:51] handsome countenance in other words
[5:53] David was handsome but the Lord Jesus
[5:55] was not because Isaiah 53 says he has no
[5:58] beauty that we would desire him let's
[6:00] listen to the quote about Jacob and
[6:01] let's listen to the quote about David
[6:04] Jacob
[6:14] Jacob he married two sisters and had
[6:16] concubine wise besides that common law
[6:19] women that he lived with and those
[6:21] Patriarchs is born right out of those
[6:23] concubine women
[6:25] amen good
[6:28] is that right amen so you have to make
[6:30] the word run smooth oh I got pages on
[6:33] them
[6:35] you say go get him and while David come
[6:39] in the sight of the Prophet The Prophet
[6:41] remember the heart and poured it up on
[6:42] his head said this is God's children
[6:45] [Music]
[6:46] not pretty
[6:48] but character
[6:51] God looks at character
[6:53] Man look
[6:55] and also getting back to how we have to
[6:57] be careful how we interpret brother
[6:58] randoms thus say the Lords there's a
[7:01] couple examples of this in the seventh
[7:03] seal 1963 brother random said it was
[7:05] thus saith the Lord he said the church
[7:07] ages plus the Seven Seals plus history
[7:09] it was all thus saith the Lord now
[7:11] friends anyone that knows the Seven
[7:13] Seals and have listened to them they
[7:15] know there's human mistakes in those
[7:18] sermons for example brother random said
[7:20] there's only 700 that did not bow the
[7:22] knee to Baal in the Days of Elijah but
[7:24] then brother Ram corrected it in the
[7:26] questions and answers sermon and
[7:27] realized there was seven thousand he
[7:29] said it was just the slip of the tongue
[7:31] but the fact that brother Brandon would
[7:33] say it's thus saved the Lord all the way
[7:34] through in the Seven Seals when he knew
[7:37] there were mistakes that he said proves
[7:39] he was talking about it was thus say the
[7:41] Lord on the revelations and not every
[7:44] word so that's how we understand the
[7:46] sermon on marriage and divorce as well
[7:48] he didn't mean every word all the way
[7:50] through he meant the Bible revelations
[7:52] the Bible teachings all the way through
[7:54] on marriage and divorce another example
[7:57] is from the sermon the God of this evil
[7:58] age August 1st 1965. brother Ram said if
[8:02] she cuts it off I don't care how much he
[8:04] dances sings She is dead that's thus
[8:06] saith the Lord the word of God first
[8:07] Corinthians 14 yeah
[8:10] so notice brother random says a woman
[8:11] that cuts her hair no matter how much
[8:13] she gets in the spirit she's dead which
[8:14] means she's not born again her soul is
[8:17] not born again but then he quotes the
[8:19] wrong scripture he says First
[8:20] Corinthians 14. any Bible reader knows
[8:23] First Corinthians 14 is not about hair
[8:25] it's about speaking in tongues So within
[8:27] one breath brother random was right with
[8:29] thus say the Lord but then he moved to
[8:31] the human side and quoted the wrong
[8:32] scripture so again these are just two
[8:35] simple examples of how we have to be
[8:36] very careful how we interpret brother
[8:38] branham's thus say the Lord's statements
[8:40] let's listen to the quote from God of
[8:42] this evil age
[8:43] if she cuts it off I don't care how much
[8:45] she dances sings send a choir speaks in
[8:49] tongues runs up and down or has all kind
[8:51] of AIDS decided she's dead
[8:55] that's thus saith the Lord
[8:58] the word of God first Corinthians 14.
[9:03] the third point I want to make is that
[9:04] brother Ram's accusers did not like how
[9:06] brother Branham said women can stoop to
[9:09] be one of the lowest things in creation
[9:11] and friends this is true because clearly
[9:14] brother Branham is showing a woman has a
[9:16] soul which animals do not have souls and
[9:19] then a woman
[9:20] has the power to say yes or no to a man
[9:23] so she often but not always has the
[9:26] power of control to either allow or
[9:29] disallow an immorality
[9:31] so this is why an immoral woman is one
[9:33] of the lowest things in creation and
[9:36] also I would put in there so is an
[9:37] immoral man because an immoral man could
[9:39] rape a woman and that's just as low as
[9:41] an immoral woman
[9:43] and also we can connect this to the Book
[9:45] of Proverbs where Solomon says three
[9:47] times that an immoral woman is the gates
[9:51] To Hell Proverbs 5 verse 5 said her feet
[9:54] go down to death her steps take hold on
[9:56] Hell Proverbs 7 27 her house is the way
[9:59] to Hell going down to the chambers of
[10:01] death and Proverbs 9 verse 18 said but
[10:04] he knoweth not that the Dead are there
[10:05] and that her guests are in the depths of
[10:07] hell
[10:08] a fourth point I want to refute is that
[10:11] brother Ram's accusers misunderstand
[10:13] brother branham's statement where
[10:14] brother Brandon said Satan was Eve's
[10:17] designer
[10:18] now friends clearly brother Ryan was not
[10:19] saying Satan created Eve because clearly
[10:22] Brothers said in the sermon Satan does
[10:25] not have the power of creation brother
[10:27] was saying that Satan designs the
[10:30] immoral clothes that reveal the bodily
[10:33] shape of a woman that make her seductive
[10:36] like the Bible says he makes women wear
[10:39] the attire of harlots as I believe
[10:41] Proverbs chapter 7 verse 10 says
[10:44] and I admit friends the word design is
[10:46] probably not the best word but brother
[10:48] Ryan was human in the sermon he said he
[10:50] was up all night he was probably
[10:51] mentally drained but either way a real
[10:54] honest person an honest Christian will
[10:55] take everything back to the word of God
[10:57] rather than criticizing brother Branham
[10:59] and neglecting all the other truth that
[11:02] was in the sermon
[11:03] and here's a few quotes where brother
[11:04] random said God made Eve so obviously
[11:07] brother random was not saying Satan
[11:09] created Eve the first is from 1953
[11:12] questions and answers
[11:13] brother Graham said now God made Eve
[11:15] from Adam's side and then in
[11:16] perseverance 1962 brother Brown said God
[11:18] made Eve was the prettiest woman ever
[11:21] lived she was God's early specimen of
[11:23] Womanhood let's listen to the quotes now
[11:26] God made Eve from Adam's side
[11:34] no sir Anna Adam he looked like some
[11:36] prehistoric giant I've never seen such a
[11:39] thing you know God made him perfect
[11:41] God made Eve was the prettiest woman
[11:43] ever lived
[11:44] she was God's early specimen of
[11:47] Womanhood certainly it was and
[11:51] the fifth point is one I already
[11:53] addressed but brother Ram's accusers
[11:54] claimed brother Brown was rebuking all
[11:57] women but clearly brother Adam said he
[11:59] was only talking about immoral women
[12:01] so if you want to hear those quotes just
[12:03] go back to the beginning of this podcast
[12:05] and you'll hear it brother Brandon said
[12:06] this is an awful strong thing and he
[12:08] said I'm talking to the immoral now not
[12:10] you sisters
[12:12] the six point I want to make is that
[12:13] brother Ram's accusers misunderstood his
[12:15] statement that Satan was co-equal with
[12:17] God
[12:18] and so the first point is that brother
[12:20] brahm's accusers spliced this quote
[12:23] he said sure it was all but a Creator he
[12:26] was everything and look what brother
[12:27] Brandon said he stood at the right hand
[12:28] of God in the heavens the great leading
[12:30] cherubim
[12:31] so here brother Adams of course using
[12:33] hyperbole he's trying to make a point
[12:35] that Satan was the anointed cherub that
[12:37] covereth he was very close to God in
[12:40] other quotes he says Satan was God's
[12:41] right man hand to fellowship and we
[12:43] understand the point of this that Satan
[12:45] was very close to God
[12:46] and friends this statement is hyperbole
[12:49] but it makes a lot of sense because we
[12:51] have to consider how did Satan convince
[12:53] a third of the angels to leave their
[12:55] first estate the only way he could have
[12:58] done that is because God made himself so
[13:00] humble
[13:01] so God allowed Lucifer to be right there
[13:03] by his throne I believe also Michael
[13:06] because there were two cherubims that
[13:07] stood upon the mercy seat on the Ark of
[13:09] the Covenant
[13:10] and Moses got this pattern from God and
[13:13] no doubt God got this pattern from his
[13:16] Heavenly throne
[13:17] so it's likely the Angels saw a lot of
[13:20] similarities between God and Lucifer
[13:22] because Lucifer was so beautiful as the
[13:24] Bible says in Ezekiel 28
[13:28] he was perfect in Beauty in verse 12.
[13:32] and then in verse 15 it says Thou was
[13:35] perfect in thy ways from the day that
[13:36] thou was created
[13:38] and then verse 17 says thine heart was
[13:41] lifted up because of thy Beauty
[13:43] the seventh misunderstanding is or the
[13:46] random statement about immoral women
[13:48] being a human garbage can of sexual
[13:50] disposal
[13:52] now friends I admit this is very harsh
[13:54] language but brother Branham admitted
[13:56] that he said this is an awful strong
[13:57] sermon and brother Branham said excuse
[14:00] me young ladies before he said this
[14:02] but friends I believe this is an
[14:04] accurate statement especially when you
[14:07] consider the lowest thing in the entire
[14:09] Book of Revelation is the mother Harlot
[14:11] because she was a to Every Nation
[14:14] All Nations on the earth and of course
[14:16] speaking of the Roman Catholic Church
[14:18] being a harlot to Every Nation all the
[14:21] kings of the earth and nothing is lower
[14:23] of course than this mother Harlot Church
[14:26] so the mother Harlot church is a
[14:28] spiritual representation of a natural
[14:30] woman who would be a who would
[14:33] receive many men and be an absolute
[14:35] disgrace to the Godly calling of how a
[14:39] woman should act and live
[14:41] also on their podcast they said that the
[14:44] Bible says sin came in the world through
[14:46] one man and that's true Romans 5 verse
[14:48] 12. states that wherefore is by one
[14:51] man's sin entered into the world and
[14:52] death by sin
[14:54] but there's also a scripture that says
[14:55] first Timothy 2 14 Adam was not deceived
[14:58] but the woman being deceived was in the
[15:00] transgression so it's clear by one man's
[15:04] sin entered in the world so this either
[15:05] means one of two things
[15:07] it could mean first Adam was guilty of
[15:09] neglect because think about it how in
[15:11] the world did Eve get a loan to be with
[15:13] the serpent and receive the forbidden
[15:15] fruit which any honest person realizes
[15:17] it was an adulterous act the forbidden
[15:19] fruit was adultery between the serpent
[15:21] and Eve or the statement by one man sin
[15:24] entered in the world refers to Adam
[15:26] plunging the whole Humanity into death
[15:29] because Eve was deceived and sinned as
[15:31] first Timothy 2 14 says but Adam had the
[15:34] choice he could have let Eve die but he
[15:37] didn't he chose the partake of the
[15:39] forbidden fruit which was having
[15:41] relations with Eve
[15:43] and he plunged the whole Humanity into
[15:45] death but of course Adam partaking of
[15:48] the fruit allowed two seeds to be
[15:49] planted in Eve and it brought forth
[15:52] twins from two different seeds
[15:55] so again I believe brother Branham is
[15:57] Vindicated in this statement
[15:59] and also friends remember the scripture
[16:01] first Timothy 5 6. but she that liveth
[16:04] in pleasure is dead while she liveth
[16:06] here Paul is talking about a woman who's
[16:08] a widow but she chooses to live in
[16:10] pleasure rather than living off the
[16:12] support of the church or marrying a
[16:14] Godly Man
[16:16] and Paul says she's dead while she lives
[16:19] in other words her soul is dead it's not
[16:22] Anointed with faith it's not Anointed
[16:24] with the Holy Ghost
[16:25] so this scripture shows an immoral woman
[16:28] is one of the lowest things in the
[16:30] entire world and many women who are
[16:33] immoral are dead while they live as the
[16:35] Bible says few there be that find the
[16:37] narrow road that leads to life
[16:44] please pardon the interruption I'd like
[16:45] to remind our listeners about two
[16:48] resources that will greatly strengthen
[16:51] your faith according to my humble
[16:52] opinion in 2019 I wrote the book called
[16:55] restoring Christian modesty it's over
[16:57] 120 Pages showing the Bible foundations
[17:00] for a modest and holy appearance
[17:04] it covers all the guidelines for modest
[17:06] clothing and also covers bracelets
[17:09] necklaces Rings earrings nose rings and
[17:14] many more topics
[17:16] one of the most useful parts of this
[17:18] book is the chapter that shows the
[17:21] history of the United States and how
[17:23] they slowly rejected modest clothing and
[17:26] it Chronicles all these changes decade
[17:28] by decade from the 1800s to the present
[17:31] and the second resource is my 2021 book
[17:34] it's an 812 page book about the 12 New
[17:37] Testament Mysteries that brother Branham
[17:39] finished according to Revelation 10
[17:41] verse 7 brother random said the seventh
[17:43] Church age messenger would finish all
[17:45] these mysteries in the sermon called is
[17:47] this the sign of the answer from
[17:49] December 1962 friends this is an
[17:52] extensive Bible teaching on the major
[17:54] doctrines that Brethren gave us proving
[17:56] he was the seventh Church age messenger
[17:59] a genuine prophet of God and the Elijah
[18:01] Prophet to restore all things in a time
[18:04] when so many people are falling away
[18:06] from the message I feel these two
[18:07] resources will strengthen your faith if
[18:09] you want God to draw closer to you
[18:11] you've got to draw closer to him and
[18:13] many times that's through prayer Bible
[18:14] study worship so I know these two
[18:17] resources will be a great help to you
[18:19] they're available on Amazon I'm not a
[18:21] book salesman so if you can't afford
[18:23] them I'll gladly email you the free PDFs
[18:26] you can read them on your phone or
[18:28] tablet or print them off if you like
[18:29] recall acts 17 verse 11 seven the brains
[18:32] were more noble because they searched
[18:34] the Scriptures Daily to prove the things
[18:36] that Paul taught were true and so we
[18:39] must do the same thing today if we're
[18:40] spiritual nobility if we're spiritual
[18:42] royalty in the family of the Lord Jesus
[18:45] Christ the family of King Jesus then we
[18:47] should search the Scriptures Daily to
[18:49] prove brother Brown's teachings were
[18:51] thus saith the word of God thank you for
[18:52] your time now back to the content
[18:56] foreign
[19:01] is that brother Ram's accusers said he
[19:04] had papers of sex to hand out to the men
[19:07] after the service and this is a
[19:09] misunderstanding let's listen to the
[19:11] quote and you'll hear Brother Branham
[19:12] talk about how the serpent is no longer
[19:15] a beast the serpent is a snake that goes
[19:18] on its belly and then brother random
[19:19] makes a strange but interesting
[19:21] statement that says there's still the
[19:24] same sin Works around a woman and so it
[19:26] seems like from this quote brother
[19:27] random has some newspaper articles where
[19:29] a snake could somehow give a woman some
[19:32] very powerful feelings again I have no
[19:35] other information on this other than the
[19:37] quotes from Brother Branham he said he's
[19:38] got all the papers and things laying
[19:40] right there so brother Ram is making a
[19:42] connection between snakes and women here
[19:45] in 1965 which is 6 000 years basically
[19:48] since the serpent first deceived Eve
[19:50] let's listen to the quote I said it's
[19:53] here not knowing where
[20:00] he said it's a serpent
[20:03] it's exactly what it was for he's no
[20:06] longer a beast he was cursed and put on
[20:08] his belly for the rest of his days he's
[20:10] here
[20:12] is that right and still in that act that
[20:14] he done that's still the same sin Works
[20:16] around a woman like a male sex like that
[20:18] that's where she has her walleye
[20:21] conditions and things when she has her
[20:22] Sensations far beyond what any man could
[20:24] ever do
[20:25] I'll stop there because we're in a mixed
[20:27] crowd I get the man I'll we'll talk more
[20:29] about it got all the papers and things
[20:31] laying right here right at my hand right
[20:32] now now let's go to bring to you this
[20:34] morning let's go take the full day in
[20:36] this but
[20:37] I'll close now I'm saying this
[20:41] so now that you've heard the quote
[20:42] brother Brandon's accusers are
[20:44] misunderstanding this statement they
[20:46] claim brother random is talking about
[20:47] how a man can cause a woman to have
[20:50] these walleyed conditions but that's not
[20:52] what brother Brown's talking about
[20:54] brother Ryan was not talking about a man
[20:55] and a woman he's talking about a snake
[20:57] and a woman because he says it's still
[20:59] the same sin Works around a woman he
[21:02] says it goes far beyond what any man
[21:04] could ever do so Brothers not talking
[21:06] about a man and a woman he's talking
[21:07] about a snake and a woman so I don't
[21:09] know what papers brother random had on
[21:11] that but he's referring to the
[21:13] connection between the serpent and Eve
[21:15] from the past and the current connection
[21:17] with snakes and women
[21:21] the ninth point is that brother random's
[21:23] accusers say it's wrong for brother
[21:24] random to share the story about meat as
[21:26] tumor now this quote about sister media
[21:29] developing a tumor after she slammed the
[21:31] door and brother Brown's face is not in
[21:33] the marriage and divorce sermon it's
[21:34] actually in Look Away to Jesus 1963.
[21:37] but I disagree with brother Brown's
[21:39] accusers it's not wrong for brothers to
[21:41] tell this story because the entire Bible
[21:43] tells stories of saints sinning falling
[21:46] short of the glory of God like Moses
[21:48] David Adam and Eve and of course every
[21:50] other man of God Abraham and so forth
[21:52] and brothers also very open about his
[21:55] mistakes and his failures he shared many
[21:57] of them so while it may have been
[21:59] uncomfortable for sister Mita to have
[22:01] brother around tell that story God still
[22:03] allowed it and sister meet us still love
[22:05] brother Bynum and brother Ram telling
[22:07] that story would not be outside of the
[22:10] program of God the character of God
[22:12] again because God tells about Saints and
[22:14] their mistakes all throughout the Bible
[22:16] and again friends there's no proof of
[22:18] brother Brandon being an abusive husband
[22:20] that's another Point brother Andrew
[22:21] accusers try to make again they're
[22:23] always jumping to conclusions trying to
[22:26] attack God's messenger which ultimately
[22:28] takes everybody's eyes off the
[22:30] messenger's message which is Jesus
[22:32] Christ the same yesterday today and
[22:34] forever Hebrews 13 8 Acts 2 38 all the
[22:37] script pictures from The Holy Bible that
[22:40] give us the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[22:42] and eventually will give us rapturing
[22:43] faith
[22:44] the tenth point is that brother's
[22:46] accusers claim brother random performed
[22:48] the remarriages of his brothers in this
[22:51] case it's the accuser's word versus
[22:54] brother branham's word it's the accusers
[22:56] documents supposedly and we don't know
[22:58] if they're doctored or not against
[23:00] brother branham's words but I'll just
[23:01] share this quote because I just heard it
[23:02] recently from questions and answers
[23:04] 1961. brother random said his brother
[23:07] asked him to marry a second time and
[23:09] brother Ram said not at all and then he
[23:11] quotes Matthew 5 32 which shows there's
[23:14] no remarriage after divorce except it be
[23:17] in the case of unconfessed adultery
[23:18] let's listen to the quote
[23:20] if you notice what Jesus said I hear him
[23:24] I've got a brother
[23:26] my own blood brother
[23:29] that's fixing to marry a woman
[23:32] and my brother
[23:34] has been married before and got a child
[23:36] by a good woman
[23:39] and he come to me to marry him I said
[23:41] not at all
[23:43] Jesus said in Matthew 5 whosoever puts
[23:47] away his wife and marries another saving
[23:50] the cause of fornications which she had
[23:52] to do before she was married and didn't
[23:53] tell him about it
[23:54] causes her to commit adultery whosoever
[23:57] marries her that is put away in liveth
[23:59] in adultery
[24:02] so don't do that no you cannot go back
[24:05] to your to your first wife if she's been
[24:08] married again
[24:10] but if you she divorced you and put you
[24:13] away then you said am I free let me read
[24:16] it again I was married to a woman that
[24:18] had never been married before
[24:21] we divorced and she has been married
[24:24] twice
[24:25] I suppose this person has remained
[24:28] single the Bible states that if we
[24:30] desire to marry to turn to first again
[24:33] no sir get over levitical laws you go
[24:36] back to that woman she's somebody else's
[24:37] property you've defiled and made
[24:39] yourself worse off than ever
[24:41] no you should not take a wife back he's
[24:43] been married to somebody else now could
[24:46] I turn to her who has been married
[24:48] before or should I
[24:51] or should I be free you are free stay
[24:54] free
[24:55] yeah you don't go back again no sir
[24:58] she's married somebody else stay away
[24:59] from it that's right no that's the file
[25:02] you understand
[25:04] we add a little more time I'll get into
[25:06] that but just for your question my
[25:07] brother whoever you are no sir don't you
[25:09] go back and take that woman when she's
[25:11] been married two or three times since
[25:12] she married you that's wrong
[25:15] the 11th statement is that brother
[25:17] Brian's accusers say brother Branham
[25:19] accidentally introduced polygamy in the
[25:20] marriage and divorce sermon again this
[25:22] is a bunch of nonsense when brother
[25:24] random said polygamy was thus saved the
[25:26] Lord he meant polygamy was in the Bible
[25:29] and God allowed it in the Bible and
[25:31] that's thus saith of scripture and
[25:32] that's true God did allow it in the Old
[25:35] Testament but not in the New Testament
[25:37] and the proof of that is that there's
[25:38] many quotes from Brother Branham where
[25:40] he says he does not believe in polygamy
[25:42] let's listen to two of those from the
[25:44] supernatural 1956 brother Graham said
[25:46] now remember don't you say that I
[25:48] believe in polygamy I don't and then the
[25:49] second one is the 17th week of Daniel
[25:51] 1961. he said and yet polygamy is wrong
[25:54] we know let's listen to the quotes
[25:56] in the Nations where they have polygmy
[25:58] it's a thousand times better
[26:00] and yet plague me is wrong we know
[26:03] I remember don't you said I believe and
[26:05] played me I don't
[26:08] know and then also the marriage and
[26:09] divorce sermon brother Brandon said when
[26:11] you've got a direct Revelation from God
[26:12] that's your wife the same thing that's
[26:14] yours the rest of your life see so here
[26:16] brother Branham says the one you marry
[26:18] is the one you got to live with the rest
[26:19] of your life let's listen to the quote
[26:21] what God has joined together let no man
[26:24] put us and I want man join together what
[26:25] God joined together
[26:27] when you got a direct Revelation from
[26:29] God that's your wife and the same thing
[26:31] that's yours the rest of your life
[26:34] and Friends it may be true that people
[26:36] are on the message have accepted
[26:37] polygamy but that's because they haven't
[26:39] waited on God as brother Adam said they
[26:41] have false teachings
[26:43] they haven't prayed about it they
[26:44] haven't listened to all the other quotes
[26:45] from Brother Branham on the topic of
[26:47] marriage and divorce
[26:48] these people that allow polygamy are led
[26:51] by the spirit of lust instead of the
[26:53] Holy Spirit and they'll be judged for
[26:55] that one day if they do not repent
[26:57] the 12th and final statement is brother
[26:59] Ram's accusers misunderstand when
[27:01] brother random said he can but she can't
[27:04] for the Brandon's accusers are saying
[27:05] that somehow brother random allowed men
[27:07] to remarry and divorce but women can't
[27:09] and that's now boy brother Ryan was
[27:11] saying again brother bran was not a
[27:12] polygamist he did not permit polygamy
[27:15] I want to reference my two videos about
[27:17] marriage and divorce in those videos I
[27:19] clearly taught Through the Bible and
[27:20] brothers quotes what brother random
[27:22] taught about marriage and divorce and
[27:24] the true Bible Revelation from Jesus is
[27:27] that a man and woman are married until
[27:29] death just one man and one woman the
[27:32] only way a man can divorce a woman and
[27:35] put her away and marry another is if he
[27:38] finds out the wise vow about her being a
[27:41] virgin was a lie and that's the one and
[27:44] only case where a man could divorce his
[27:46] wife put her way and remarry and this is
[27:48] what brother Adam taught in numerous
[27:50] places it's from the verses Matthew 5 32
[27:53] and Matthew 19 verse 9. Jesus said
[27:56] saving for the cause of fornication
[27:57] that's the only way a man can divorce
[28:00] and remarry of course that means a woman
[28:02] that had fornication before they were
[28:04] married and she didn't confess it
[28:06] and Jesus said again in Matthew 19 9
[28:08] except to be for fornication
[28:10] and this is also found in Matthew
[28:12] chapter 1 verses 19 and 20. Joseph was
[28:15] going to put away Mary privately rather
[28:18] than publicly because it seemed to him
[28:20] she had already known a man before they
[28:22] were married but the angel Lord appeared
[28:24] unto Joseph and said if you're not to
[28:26] take unto thee Mary thy wife for that
[28:28] which is conceived of hers of the Holy
[28:30] Ghost
[28:31] so the Bible interprets itself there's
[28:33] only one cause that a man can put away a
[28:36] woman and remarry another that's if the
[28:38] woman gave a false vow and said she was
[28:40] a virgin but she'd actually committed
[28:42] fornication and it is true that only a
[28:45] man can do that a woman can't because
[28:46] that's what Jesus said
[28:48] Jesus said it causes her to commit
[28:50] adultery not him because the man is head
[28:52] over woman as the Bible plainly teaches
[28:55] and just like the type brother random
[28:57] said the church can't put Christ away
[28:58] only Christ could put away the church
[29:00] the same is true in the natural
[29:02] the last point I want to make is that
[29:04] brother Adam teaches his true Revelation
[29:07] on marriage and divorce also in
[29:09] questions and answers 1962 to May 27th
[29:13] brother random uses First Corinthians 7
[29:15] 15 to show that a woman and man can
[29:18] separate but they cannot remarry another
[29:20] the Bible says they're free and not
[29:22] under bondage but brother Adam says that
[29:24] doesn't mean you're free to remarry he
[29:26] says you've got to remain single because
[29:28] you vowed to be married to them until
[29:31] death and that's also according to
[29:32] Romans chapter 7. it's Romans 7 verse 2
[29:35] the woman which hath and husband is
[29:37] bound by the law to her husband so long
[29:39] as he liveth but if the husband be dead
[29:41] she's loose from the law of her husband
[29:43] verse 3 so then if while her husband
[29:45] liveth she'd be married to another man
[29:46] she should be called an adulteress but
[29:48] if her husband be dead she's free from
[29:50] that law so that she is no adulterous
[29:52] though she'd be married to another man
[29:53] so I'll give you the words to look for
[29:55] if you start looking for the words now
[29:57] and answering these questions they are
[29:59] the best of my knowledge and if I'll try
[30:01] to answer them by scripture so it's
[30:02] paragraph 27 and then it goes from
[30:05] paragraph 27
[30:06] all the way down to paragraph about 44.
[30:10] and then he also addresses in another
[30:12] quote from 1961 questions and answers
[30:15] October 15th it starts with question 159
[30:19] brother Branham I was married to a woman
[30:20] that had been married before we divorced
[30:23] and she's been married twice since so
[30:25] here brother random says they have to
[30:27] remain single if they've been divorced
[30:29] they cannot remarry their first spouse
[30:31] if their first spouse had went and
[30:33] married somebody else
[30:36] thank you
[30:39] well we come to the end of this podcast
[30:41] friends I hope this was a blessing Again
[30:43] by the grace of God I felt led to the
[30:45] Lord to correct the lies that came out
[30:47] of one of Brothers accusers podcasts
[30:49] they show their cognitive dissonance on
[30:52] their podcasts on a weekly basis they
[30:55] will not accept correction they will not
[30:57] admit they're wrong
[30:59] they will not interpret brother random
[31:00] correctly nor the Bible but friends
[31:03] we're grateful for marriage and divorce
[31:04] if you heard my wife's testimonies at
[31:06] first sermon she listened to and
[31:07] although it was strong she recognized it
[31:09] was the truth even while just coming out
[31:11] of the Lutheran Church
[31:13] now of course we've been serving God in
[31:15] this message since 2002 and we're
[31:17] grateful for it over 21 years in the
[31:19] message it's been a complete blessing a
[31:21] complete transformation because it's the
[31:23] word of God revealed to us it's the
[31:25] Bible revealed to us the message of the
[31:27] hour the scriptures God is fulfilling
[31:29] right now
[31:30] so thank you for your downloads friends
[31:31] and if you feel led please pray about it
[31:33] and share this podcast with someone if
[31:34] you think it might help them God bless
[31:36] you and may Jesus Christ anoint you to
[31:38] defend this message
[31:55] that was yesterday
[31:59] never failed
[32:02] [Music]
[32:08] thank you
