[0:07] worship on Sunday and other days the
[0:11] book of Acts details how Paul and
[0:13] Jesus's disciples gathered on the first
[0:15] day of the week Sunday most likely
[0:17] because Christ rose from the dead on the
[0:19] first day of the week Paul and other
[0:22] Christians gathered on Sundays to listen
[0:23] to preaching take communion and give
[0:26] financial gifts to God's ministries acts
[0:29] 20 verse 7 and upon the first day of the
[0:32] week when the disciples came together to
[0:33] break bread Paul preached unto them
[0:36] ready to depart on the morrow and
[0:38] continued his speech until midnight
[0:41] 1st Corinthians 16 verses 1 and 2 now
[0:45] concerning the collection for the Saints
[0:46] as I have given order to the churches of
[0:49] Galatia even so do ye upon the first day
[0:52] of the week let every one of you lay by
[0:54] him in store as God hath prospered him
[0:57] that there be no gatherings when I come
[1:00] along with Sunday worship Christians are
[1:02] to gather on the other days of the week
[1:04] because Hebrews 10:25 says we should
[1:07] assemble more as we see Christ's return
[1:09] approaching our church feels that of the
[1:12] Holy Spirit to have weekly services on
[1:14] Wednesday evening and to Sunday services
[1:17] on special occasions we've also held
[1:19] services on Thursday Friday and Saturday
[1:21] you and I must gather more with
[1:24] Christians as the spirit leads us having
[1:28] a pastor every Christian should have a
[1:31] pastor at his or her home Church the
[1:34] office of a pastor is ordained by Jesus
[1:36] Christ himself as Ephesians chapter 4
[1:38] teaches us that after Jesus ascended to
[1:41] the right hand of the Father in heaven
[1:43] he sent five preaching gifts one of
[1:45] which is the pastor gift Ephesians 4:8
[1:50] wherefore he saith when he ascended up
[1:52] on high he led captivity captive and
[1:55] gave gifts unto men Ephesians 4:11 and
[1:59] he gave some apostles and some prophets
[2:01] and some evangelists and some pastors
[2:04] and teachers the word pastor means
[2:08] Shepherd in both Greek and Hebrew which
[2:11] enlightens our understanding to Jesus as
[2:13] does
[2:13] nine for his people Jesus the chief
[2:16] shepherd in heaven sees his followers as
[2:18] sheep who need fed and protected by an
[2:21] earthly Shepherd a pastor your home
[2:24] church is the spiritual flock that you
[2:26] as God's sheep must remain in Matthew
[2:30] nine verses 35 to 38 beautifully
[2:32] illustrates jesus's compassion upon his
[2:35] sheep or believers as it says but when
[2:38] he saw the multitudes he was moved with
[2:40] compassion on them because they fainted
[2:42] and were scattered abroad as sheep
[2:45] having no Shepherd then saith he unto
[2:48] his disciples the harvest truly is
[2:50] plenteous but the laborers are few pray
[2:52] ye therefore the lord of the harvest
[2:54] that he will send forth laborers into
[2:56] his harvest jesus's remedy for scattered
[3:00] sheep was prayer prayer the labors would
[3:03] go out and labor in the harvest to
[3:05] gather his sheep and feed them jesus
[3:08] wants you to have a pasture dear friend
[3:10] feeding God's sheep God's pure word is
[3:13] the pastor's main duty for Jesus charge
[3:16] Peter to feed his lambs and sheep in
[3:18] order to prove his love for Christ in
[3:20] John 21 verses 15 through 17 when Paul
[3:24] left Ephesus he charged the elders to
[3:27] feed the Church of God after warning
[3:29] them for three years in tears that
[3:31] wolves would enter into their churches
[3:33] according to acts 20 verses 28 to 31 in
[3:37] Paul's final letter before his martyrdom
[3:39] he charged Timothy to preach the word in
[3:42] 2nd Timothy 4 verses 1 and 2 Christian
[3:47] friend if you want to be a healthy and
[3:49] obedient sheep belonging to Jesus let
[3:51] him lead you to a home church and a
[3:53] pasture to feed your soul God's holy
[3:56] word be assured also that your pastor or
[4:00] Shepherd will give an account for your
[4:02] soul to go along with the account that
[4:04] you give for your own soul Romans 14:12
[4:08] so then every one of us shall give
[4:11] account of himself to God Hebrews 13:17
[4:15] obey them that have the rule over you
[4:17] and submit yourselves for they watch for
[4:20] your souls as they that must give
[4:22] account that they may do it with joy and
[4:24] not with grief for that is unprofitable
[4:27] for the wolf for you may you follow
[4:30] God's leading to submit to and obey all
[4:33] of Christ's words that your pastor both
[4:35] preaches and lives before you and your
[4:37] family
[4:40] growing from the five preaching gifts
[4:43] through regular church attendance Jesus
[4:45] designed that his sheep would grow and
[4:48] stay spiritually healthy through five
[4:50] preaching gifts after Jesus ascended to
[4:53] heaven he sent these five gifts for a
[4:55] five-fold blessing to his sheep apostles
[4:59] our missionaries the highest calling in
[5:01] the Bible traveling to lands around the
[5:03] world to make new converts and churches
[5:05] to Christ's prophets both major/minor
[5:09] foretell the future by the Spirit of God
[5:11] and speak with the authority of thus
[5:13] saith the Lord evangelist traveled to
[5:16] various established churches and
[5:18] reignite believers faith pastors stay in
[5:22] one local church to feed and protect
[5:24] believers teachers are reveal the deeper
[5:28] truths of God's Word in their home
[5:29] church and can also travel to other
[5:31] churches Jesus designed that pastors
[5:35] would allow these four other preaching
[5:37] gifts to operate in their local
[5:39] assemblies in brotherly love and
[5:41] cooperation and Paul says there are five
[5:44] benefits to hearing all five preaching
[5:46] gifts which include the perfection of
[5:49] the saints
[5:49] which means the equipping of the Saints
[5:52] the work of the ministry which means
[5:55] undertaking the work of the ministry the
[5:59] edifying of the body of Christ which
[6:01] means promoting the growth of Christians
[6:03] the unity of the faith which means the
[6:07] agreement of faith or beliefs the unity
[6:11] of the knowledge of the Son of God which
[6:13] means unity of knowledge or precise
[6:15] truth these five benefits all work to
[6:20] create a perfect man unto the measure of
[6:23] the stature of the fullness of Christ
[6:25] meaning they will bring each Christian
[6:27] to a portion of maturity in Jesus Christ
[6:30] as mature Christians we then speak the
[6:34] truth in love not hate envy or jealousy
[6:37] and find where God has fitly joined us
[6:40] in our position in the body of Christ
[6:43] Paul says the fivefold preaching
[6:45] ministry will cause us to no longer be
[6:47] the following immature meaning unskilled
[6:50] and foolish tossed meaning agitated
[6:53] like waves carried which means driven by
[6:57] doubts hesitations and opinions and
[7:00] deceived which means to roam or be led
[7:03] astray

[7:17] you and may Jesus Christ be the desire
[7:19] of your heart
