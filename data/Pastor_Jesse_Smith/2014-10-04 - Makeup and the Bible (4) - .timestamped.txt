[0:00] [Music]
[0:11] greetings friends in the Holy Name of
[0:13] Jesus Christ the purpose of this video
[0:16] is to present to you perhaps for the
[0:18] first time why some Christian women
[0:20] choose not to wear makeup based upon the
[0:23] Bible's teaching we feel honored and
[0:25] humbled to be able to present to you the
[0:28] following truths out of God's holy Bible
[0:30] and history as you may have never heard
[0:32] anything like this before our prayer is
[0:35] that your heart will be open to hearing
[0:37] these truths out of God's word and that
[0:40] you will be not only a hearer of these
[0:41] truths but a doer meaning that you will
[0:44] choose to present your face the way God
[0:46] intended it without any makeup we also
[0:50] pray you will share these Bible truths
[0:52] with others that you know and love
[1:04] to begin with there is not one scripture
[1:06] in which God commands any woman or man
[1:09] to wear makeup or paint their face in
[1:11] any way if God wanted his daughters to
[1:14] wear paint he would have told them to do
[1:16] so in his
[1:18] word God wants us to present our clean
[1:21] natural faces to others because God
[1:24] created our faces and said our entire
[1:26] bodies were fearfully and wonderfully
[1:28] made even
[1:31] marvelous for thou Hast possessed my
[1:33] Reigns thou has covered me in my
[1:35] mother's womb I will praise thee for I
[1:38] am fearfully and wonderfully made
[1:40] marvelous are thy works and that my soul
[1:43] knoweth right
[1:46] well according to the Bible there is no
[1:48] makeup that can improve or make more
[1:51] beautiful the face that God already
[1:53] created for each of us makeup is a
[1:56] superficial and false covering that God
[1:58] did not intend to be added to his
[2:00] creation it's a shame that advertisers
[2:03] in Hollywood have convinced millions
[2:05] that the faces God made for them are not
[2:07] good enough the truth is that your face
[2:10] is best just the way God made it and you
[2:13] can rejoice in the true face God gave
[2:15] you we shouldn't desire a false
[2:17] appearance since the Bible says that
[2:19] charity or love rejoices in the truth
[2:22] according to 1 Corinthians
[2:24] 136 love doesn't rejoice in a false
[2:27] superficial covering but it does rejoice
[2:29] in a true natural appearance from
[2:38] God we will briefly look at what the
[2:40] Bible teaches about makeup then we'll
[2:42] examine the history of our nation and
[2:44] see how we began as a Christian Nation
[2:46] with Godly standards one of which was
[2:49] abstaining from the use of makeup but
[2:51] history will show that eventually the
[2:53] evil influence of Hollywood caused the
[2:55] majority of people to adopt the Heathen
[2:57] practice of painting their faces
[3:07] there are three scriptures that teach
[3:08] Christian women to abstain from wearing
[3:10] makeup they are found in 2 Kings 9:30
[3:13] Jeremiah 4:30 and Ezekiel 23:40 and
[3:17] literally the rest of the Bible because
[3:19] there are no scriptures in which God
[3:21] commands any woman whether Godly or
[3:23] ungodly to paint her face or wear any
[3:26] facial cosmetic let's explain these
[3:28] three scriptures
[3:31] 2 Kings 9:30 and when J was come to
[3:34] Jezreel Jezebel heard of it and she
[3:36] painted her face and tired her head and
[3:39] looked out at a window Jezebel was one
[3:42] of if not the most evil woman in the
[3:44] entire Bible she was a murderer of God's
[3:47] prophets and another innocent man named
[3:49] naboth she was a devout worshipper of
[3:51] Idols such as Baal and was guilty of
[3:54] whoredoms and Witchcraft notice that
[3:56] Jezebel is the only individual woman
[3:59] recorded in the Bible as painting her
[4:01] face out of over 440 references to the
[4:04] face in the Bible only Jezebel is named
[4:08] as the one who used facial cosmetics
[4:10] without a doubt face painting and facial
[4:13] cosmetics and makeup are linked to
[4:15] heathenism and idolatry according to
[4:18] Jezebel's behavior and background in the
[4:20] Bible we must learn from truths in the
[4:23] Old Testament as Jesus prophesied that
[4:25] the same Spirit of Jezebel would return
[4:28] and seduce Christians in the new New
[4:29] Testament dispensation according to
[4:32] Revelation
[4:33] 2:20 notwithstanding I have a few things
[4:37] against thee because thou sufferest that
[4:39] woman Jezebel which calth herself a
[4:42] prophetess to teach and to seduce my
[4:44] servants to commit fornication and to
[4:47] eat things sacrificed unto
[4:50] Idols while we do not believe every
[4:52] woman who wears makeup today is a
[4:54] heathen or idolator we do believe it is
[4:57] our responsibility to humbly speak the
[5:00] truth in love and make our precious
[5:02] Christian friends aware of the roots of
[5:04] wearing facial cosmetics in hopes that
[5:07] some will turn from this ungodly
[5:09] practice we sincerely believe that most
[5:11] people are totally unaware of these
[5:14] scriptures and the history we will soon
[5:16] present so we pray that each believer
[5:19] will open their heart to obeying the
[5:21] gospel of
[5:23] Christ the next scripture shows God
[5:26] speaking through the Prophet Jeremiah to
[5:28] all of Israel his Old Testament people
[5:31] at the time of one of their punishments
[5:32] for committing wickedness and Rebellion
[5:35] against him this scripture shows that
[5:37] his vanity to wear expensive clothing
[5:39] and use makeup just as St Peter tells us
[5:42] in the New Testament that a woman's
[5:44] inner beauty and spiritual adornment of
[5:46] the meek and quiet spirit is a great
[5:48] value in the sight of God and when thou
[5:51] art spoiled What wilt thou do though
[5:54] thou clothest thyself with Crimson
[5:57] though thou deck thee with ornaments of
[5:59] gold
[6:00] though thou renest thy face with
[6:01] painting in vain shalt thou make thyself
[6:04] Fair thy lovers will despise thee they
[6:07] will seek thy life to understand verse
[6:10] 30 we must understand that Jeremiah 4 is
[6:14] a picture of God issuing a sentence of
[6:16] Destruction upon Judah and Jerusalem
[6:19] through Horsemen and bowmen though not a
[6:21] final Destruction for their evil doings
[6:24] bitter wickedness rebellion and
[6:27] foolishness God then speaks in verse 30
[6:29] that Israel's lovers will despise her
[6:32] and seek to kill her despite her efforts
[6:34] to wear expensive clothing and ornaments
[6:36] and have a painted face notice that
[6:39] Israel was not painting her face to
[6:40] please God and God never asked any woman
[6:43] to wear facial Cosmetics Israel was
[6:46] painting her face to please her idols
[6:48] and the Nations that taught her their
[6:50] Heathen
[6:51] ways sadly in Jeremiah 4:30 God's people
[6:55] were doing the same thing Jezebel did a
[6:57] few hundred years earlier painting their
[6:59] faces in the day of their
[7:02] destruction the third and final
[7:04] scripture about makeup is found in
[7:06] Ezekiel 2340 which was probably spoken
[7:09] near the same time as Jeremiah spoke his
[7:11] prophecy of Destruction but ezekiel's
[7:13] audience was most likely Jews in Babylon
[7:16] due to their Exile from the promised
[7:18] land the entire chapter of Ezekiel 23
[7:22] portrays Israel as an adulterous woman
[7:24] who lust after the gods of other nations
[7:27] such as Egypt and Assyria here's here's
[7:29] what Ezekiel says in verses
[7:31] 4041 and 43 and
[7:34] 44 and furthermore that ye have sent for
[7:37] men to come from Far unto whom a
[7:39] messenger was sent and lo they came for
[7:43] whom thou did wash thyself paint thine
[7:46] eyes and dexes thyself with ornaments
[7:49] and satest upon a stately bed and a
[7:51] table prepared before it whereupon thou
[7:54] Hast set mine incense and mine oil then
[7:57] said I unto her that was old and
[7:59] adulteries will they now commit
[8:01] whoredoms with her and she with them yet
[8:04] they went in unto her as they go in unto
[8:07] a woman that plth the Harlot so went
[8:09] they in unto aholah and unto aholibah
[8:13] the lwd
[8:15] women we can easily see that God Likens
[8:18] Israel unto a woman who is receiving her
[8:21] adulterous lovers and gives details on
[8:23] how she prepares for her lovers she
[8:26] washes herself paints her eyes or puts
[8:29] on makeup then puts on ornaments and
[8:32] sits on a bed near a table prepared for
[8:34] a
[8:36] meal based upon these three scriptures
[8:39] we conclude God's word is clearly
[8:41] against the use of makeup and facial
[8:43] Cosmetics for the entire rest of the
[8:45] Bible does not offer even one hint of
[8:48] God requesting facial Cosmetics upon any
[8:51] man or woman what God does want on our
[8:54] faces is his glory the Bible says we
[8:57] behold his glory and become changed
[8:59] changed into his image from glory to
[9:01] glory by the spirit of the
[9:04] [Music]
[9:09] Lord let's look at this brief timeline
[9:11] that highlights historical events that
[9:14] relate to our nation's changing attitude
[9:16] toward
[9:17] makeup our timeline begins in the 19th
[9:20] century three sources we found say the
[9:23] following during the 19th century it was
[9:25] considered immoral to paint one's face
[9:28] and make ja up was frowned upon and was
[9:31] associated with
[9:33] prostitution we find then that the
[9:35] majority of Americans were obedient to
[9:37] the word of God in regards to not
[9:39] wearing makeup throughout the entire
[9:41] 19th century which was a continuation of
[9:44] The Obedience from the previous
[9:47] centuries sadly the changes started
[9:50] happening during the 20th century as
[9:52] this nation began rebelling against many
[9:54] of the principles it was founded upon
[9:56] most importantly the principles from the
[9:58] word of God
[10:00] history tells us that obedience began to
[10:02] come to an end during the shocking
[10:04] Roaring 20s the flapper exhibited her
[10:07] Freedom by dancing to Jazz smoking
[10:10] cigarettes she painted on lipstick and
[10:13] Rouge produced by cosmetic companies run
[10:16] by women such as Helena Rubenstein and
[10:18] Elizabeth
[10:20] ardan not long after the Roaring 20s the
[10:23] Great Depression set in in which the
[10:25] majority of Americans began turning to
[10:27] Hollywood to ease their burdens rather
[10:29] than God and immediately began to
[10:32] imitate actors and actresses to ease the
[10:35] sting of economic burdens Americans look
[10:37] to Hollywood more than 85 million people
[10:40] a week Escape their troubles in darken
[10:42] movie theaters many fans imitated the
[10:45] polished makeup of film stars plucked
[10:48] eyebrows dark lipstick gleaming
[10:51] fingernails we learned that as much as
[10:53] possible women also emulated the
[10:56] clothing of movie Queens like Joan
[10:58] Crawford
[11:00] and but now women could be seen
[11:03] everywhere pouting lipstick and dabbing
[11:05] at their noses with a powder puff the
[11:08] Advent of Hollywood and its Stars had
[11:10] made the open use of Cosmetics
[11:12] acceptable but it also brought a new
[11:14] bondage for women that of trying to look
[11:16] like someone
[11:17] [Music]
[11:19] else following the Great Depression and
[11:21] Hollywood's explosion of evil influence
[11:24] rock and roll blues and Soul music
[11:26] became increasingly popular and along
[11:29] with their Fame their Fashions
[11:31] glamorized painted faces as they
[11:33] targeted the Youth of our
[11:35] nation rock and roll blues and soul
[11:38] contributed to youth fashion throughout
[11:40] the
[11:41] 1960s women goop their eyes with black
[11:43] eyeliner and colored ey
[11:46] Shadow today nearly 100 years since the
[11:49] Roaring 20s changed America forever most
[11:52] Americans are totally unaware that our
[11:55] nation once stood upon God's word and
[11:57] abstained from painting their faces
[12:00] we are now a nation in Disobedience and
[12:02] most do not know it fulfilling
[12:04] Revelation
[12:07] 3:17-19 Jesus told us because thou
[12:10] sayest I am rich and increase with goods
[12:13] and have need of nothing and knowest not
[12:15] that thou art wretched and miserable and
[12:18] poor and blind and naked I counsel thee
[12:22] to buy of me gold tried in the fire that
[12:24] thou mayest be rich and white rment that
[12:27] thou mayest be clothed and that the
[12:29] shame of thy nakedness do not appear and
[12:31] anoint thine eyes with I myself that
[12:34] thou mayest see as many as I love I
[12:37] rebuke and chasen be zealous therefore
[12:40] and
[12:41] repent in summary for nearly 150 years
[12:45] our judeo-christian values considered
[12:47] makeup immoral and our nation was
[12:50] obedient to the word of God now for
[12:53] nearly 100 years the sinful influence of
[12:56] Hollywood has glamorized makeup use and
[12:58] S sadly generations of Americans and
[13:01] Christians are totally unaware of these
[13:04] truths our nation has been disobedient
[13:06] to God's word thankfully throughout the
[13:09] years God has sent many witnesses to try
[13:11] and point this nation back to the truth
[13:13] of God's word one such witness was the
[13:16] prophet of God named William brandham
[13:18] let's listen to a quote from 1956 as he
[13:21] pleads with the people of God to abstain
[13:23] from wearing makeup due to its Heathen
[13:27] Roots I just Africa you women is that
[13:30] paint on you know where it come from
[13:32] that's a mark of
[13:34] heathenism they paint their FA and
[13:36] that's where you got it from Heath got
[13:40] Christians wash their
[13:42] [Music]
[13:44] face that might kind Scorch a little
[13:47] brother you better be scorcher and first
[13:49] somewhere
[13:54] else
[13:55] amen the 1980 Bible Almanac reports this
[13:59] teaching that makeup came from Heathen
[14:02] Origins and not from the god of the
[14:04] Bible as it says cosmetics and perfumes
[14:08] Egyptian and Assyrian women use paint as
[14:10] a cosmetic they color their eyelashes
[14:14] and the edges of the eyelids with a fine
[14:16] black powder moistened with oil or
[14:18] vinegar to achieve an effect somewhat
[14:21] like modern mascara
[14:29] we pray we have presented enough Bible
[14:32] evidence and history to prove our
[14:34] conviction to you that the Bible teaches
[14:37] women and men should abstain from
[14:38] wearing makeup we also pray you will
[14:41] receive the words of life we have taught
[14:44] and prayerfully consider whose influence
[14:46] on the subject of makeup you will follow
[14:49] and imitate either the influence of
[14:51] Hollywood and heathenism or the
[14:53] influence of God Almighty and His holy
[14:56] word if God wanted us to wear makeup up
[14:59] he would have put the command in his
[15:01] Bible but he never did that he only
[15:04] asked us to believe his word that the
[15:07] bodies and the faces he gave us were
[15:09] already fearfully and wonderfully made
[15:13] God only desires that his glory be seen
[15:15] on our
[15:18] faces but we all with open face
[15:21] beholding as in a glass the glory of the
[15:24] Lord are changed into the same image
[15:27] from glory to glory even as by the
[15:29] spirit of the
[15:32] Lord if you'd like more Bible teaching
[15:35] about makeup or any other Bible topic
[15:38] please contact us God bless you and may
[15:40] Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
