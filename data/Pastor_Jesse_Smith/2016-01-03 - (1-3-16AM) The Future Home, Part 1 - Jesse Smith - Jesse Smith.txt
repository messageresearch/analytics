Amazing Grace this morning man how sweet to sound that could save a Wretch like me anden this morning I'd be working somewhere I'd be somewhere watching some sports thing or something like that if

you may be seated there just for a moment by God's grace I'd like to greet everybody in the name of the Lord Jesus this morning praise God sir it's good to be in the house of the Lord this morning and thank the Lord for his Mercy uh got quite a few things to get through today uh the first thing I want to do is invite John and V up here so I know van just walked in but van come on up here you look good brother come on up here buddy John come on up here please if you would by God's grace every i' like to recognize the the church officers uh for all the work that they do if you guys can just stand right here u i just really appreciate all their help um us three are the three officers of the church uh Soh but these brothers do a tremendous job I'll start with Brother John he does Sunday school teaching from time to time we appreciate how he loves the children uh he's a trustee helping out with the the arrangements here of the church uh the treasurer he's the treasur of the church keeps tabs on that really appreciate all that he song leads he min SS here does a lot for us so we appreciate brother John all he does brother Van's a trustee does a lot of work around here as well things that go unseen uh probably the most important thing he runs those wires around here and all over the ceiling I don't know how that guy does that he's like Houdini or something he's able to just to kind of take it all over and make it disappear and appear and uh but they do a great job uh brother bang runs the sound many times as all that for us and he teaches Sunday school at the church he came from uh the pastors needed somebody to teach those little children and Bang's like I'll do it you know so that's a real Godly thing to do there pour his life into those little lives there and I just trust God will give him fruit to that one day if the Lord carries so this is a little token of our appreciation from the church let's give these brothers Round of Applause appreciate you [Applause] brothers that one more round of applause great God thank you Brothers we just are thankful for them by the grace of the Lord um thanks for the EMA or thanks for uh reading the email that I sent out we like to try to leave the last two rows open for the families with young children thank you for everybody doing that and in the future might have to jam in a little closer with more people come we're missing brother Johan and Josie's children but I have to squeeze in a little more but you're doing a great job thanks for uh helping us with that uh also we'll do voting at the end of the service today I have a ballot for everybody um so that's ready to go by the grace of Lord and I have a copy of the bylaws I'm going to give everybody a copy of the bylaws if you want to read it you don't have to but it's how uh we're recognized as the government is how we run uh this this to them it's a business but to us it's the Church of the Living God but you have to have some form of written bylaw so I spent a few more hours working on that this week and try to shorten it a little bit and took some advice uh some nice advice from Brother Jean and Sister Amy had a good question in there so I try to answer that in the bylaws and appreciate the people who over that and then John bang and I will vote on that because the we're the board of directors what a tiny little board of directors we are but uh we we're the ones recognized by the state we have to vote on that uh after you read through it so we'll give you about a week to read through that if you'd like to read through that give us some feedback by the grace of the Lord also sister Wendy's put together a nice little members directory for us here so I'm gonna leave it out there on the table after service uh if there's anything missing please let her know before we just print the final one if you want to a church directory it's real nice has people's birthdays on anniversaries and things like that so if you can't really maybe see them maybe you can pray for him on that day we sure appreciate the prayers of the Saints and thanks for our sister doing that thanks sister for putting that together by the grace of the Lord so be sure to look at that here by the grace of the Lord okay I believe that's it we're trying to preserve time this morning and uh get right to the word of God so if we can stand here let's open up to Revelation chapter 21 by the grace of the Lord brother bang I have a slideshow whenever uh ready with some quotes a lot of quotes like I said there's over 300 but I won't get to all those today so Revelation chapter 21 uh I sent an email out about that a few days ago as well if you wanted to read the future home or listen to it kind of prepare your heart so I did was I went uh paragraph by paragraph through this entire message uh and then searched all the times the prophet said New Jerusalem future home uh new city things like that after he preached it to see what else the Lord had him add to it so I feel like we got a a good teaching on it by the grace of God Revelation 21 verse1 if you're there say amen and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more sea and I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband now we're going to stop right there we know the whole chapters about this we'll be getting to that uh this morning and evening service but let's go to Second Peter chapter 3 these are the prophet's texts that he used here uh to preach it himself brother Bram said this is an important subject so how many feel like it's important it's a very important subject it's your home second Peter chapter 3 now we want to just start at verse five because just a conserve time this is a really long message if you know this message brother B it was a three-h hour and 40 minute message now the last 40 minutes was a prayer line uh so but it's a quite a lengthy message verse five for this they willing are ignorant of that by the word of God the heavens were of old and the Earth standing out of the water and in the water so what the world calls laws of nature the Bible calls the word of God the laws of nature hold everything in place that's what science calls it uh but we call it the word of God verse six whereby the world that then was being overflowed with water perished and notice there's three worlds in here but the heavens and the Earth which are now by the same word are kept in store reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and predition of ungodly men but beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day now let's get down to verse 10 but the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night remember we mentioned that on Thursday night's message in which the heaven shall pass away with a great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent Heat the Earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness looking for and hting unto the coming of the day of God where in the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with fervent heat nevertheless we according to his promise look for new heavens and a new Earth wherein dwelleth righteousness praise God let's have one more word of prayer have a need on your heart Hearts make it known to God Heavenly Father you see the people's hearts bless this reading of Thy word open it to us so we can understand it Lord we thank you for your mercy in Jesus Christ's name the church said amen God bless you being SE there praise the Lord let's look this morning here uh if we can let's look at the New Jerusalem our future home sorry let get a little overlap there uh so we want to look at this by the grace of the Lord and uh see that the New Jerusalem is our future home it's a pyramid city which most of us are aware of um but if not then we'll just show it right through the scripture and so forth uh by the grace of the Lord praise God now the first slide I'm going to skip past I just had my notes I kind of keep little things I like to add at the beginning of the messages there so I'm G to skip past that we read our text and the brother R said the future home is an important subject of a very important subject to me it's a very blessful one hope it strikes you the same way I can only give an inspiration I received and I was speaking this morning on the future home with the Heavenly bridegroom and Earthly bride where they're going to live brother Ram said he just preached the highlights of this message he said it would take weeks to preach the whole thing but I've wrote down some scriptures some notes just to hit the highlights of it to where it'll let you study and it really helped me study to hit the highlights of this just his highlights uh brother BR said this he feasted on this message for weeks afterwards you ever had a message like that it just so strikes you that you just can't get over it you just want to dwell and regurgitate it and feed on it and listen to it again and again butam tells us in proving his word last Sunday week ago I spoke on the subject the future home in the bridegroom I've been feasting on that ever since knowing that when this life is over I'm going to that City I'm Bound for that City Nothing Else Matters what if the sun doesn't shine today or tomorrow never comes what difference does it make we got a home a resting place tired or not tired we still have that resting place you say that's an old man's dream no it isn't it's isn't it's the Bible truth brother says in question and answers by the way I got so many letters on my message two three Sundays ago on the future home that sure hit home somewhere there's a lot of them it did me too I've never got over it yet amen let's begin teaching there like I said we have quite a bit to get through I'm going to be reading a lot of quotations and uh scriptures I try to put most of the scriptures up here because I knew I kind of had to go fast through it but uh did anybody get a chance to listen to it well I shouldn't ask said but sorry I don't want to embarrass anybody that didn't but hopefully somebody got a chance to listen to it it'll be nice and fresh on your mind if not then afterwards maybe this week you want to listen to it it's such a blessing uh bring a real Spirit of Love in Your Heart uh now brother bam reads two texts he read Revelation 21 and second Peter chapter 3 brother Ram said John told us about the new Earth he told us all the details about it but he said Peter explained how we get it which is Through Fire okay here he says it right here see he doesn't he said John doesn't explain it Peter does John just said I saw new heavens and new earth first was passed away there's no more se but we turn back to Second Peter now Peter explains how this process comes about so Peter explains the process John tells what the effect of the process was amen kind like a cause and effect praise God now if you notice in the text there are three different worlds describe the past condition of the world the present condition of the world and the future condition of the world but it's the same world it's the same Earth okay so here it is we're read read this for our text the Earth standing out of the water and in the water that was the world that then was so in the days of Noah that world that was covered by water that was the previous condition of the earth he said now verse seven but the heavens and the Earth which are now by the same word are kept in store so now we have a different condition of the same Earth praise God and now we have a third condition of the earth nevertheless we according to his promise look for new heavens and a new Earth so brother Bram lays this out he refers to three stages of the earth okay brother says that one that now is and the one to come the old world stood out for the water Genesis 1:1 and now the world that is now present and then again he refers to another one three worlds three stages of the world now not three planets one planet in three stages okay you have to get this or else brother said you'll be all confused now brother said the Earth is redeemed in three stages just like men notice how God makes plain to us his Plan of Redemption what God has done to redeem the world he's done the same plan to redeem his people for the unchangeable god changes not in any of his plans or anything all right he how he led us to himself to a Tabernacle in Us by three stages of Grace now look at this just as he led the world to three stages to come to the world now look as God will come to the world after it's gone through three different stag of purification that's exactly how he comes to us through three stages of Grace I've taught that at the beginning I've never changed since it's God's word look what he says next if that wasn't a kind confirmation oh a great a great loving blessing from God when I seen this and since a boy the first time Christ ever dealt with me I've still always taught those three stages of Grace amen glory amen that's important Church you know why this was such a a a a burden to me that when we made those videos on our website three works of Grace I went back to this message we have two videos that teach the three works okay but it's just two videos part one and part two and and I taught the Sunday school last year and showed and showed these to the children the Earth is redeemed in three Works justification sanctification baptism of the fire uh Ezekiel said we had go through three Works a new heart new spirit my spirit in Ezekiel 36 Israel possessing the land had to get justified by passing the Red Sea brother brand said get Sanctified or approved in the wilderness for 40 years and then the baptism of Holy Ghost was Crossing Jordan yeah the life of Abraham brother ra said he had to be justified by getting called out from his family his sanctification was all the time up till he got the baptism of the Holy Ghost for him which was the token of circumcision brother brandom said Hallelujah the natural birth of a baby first the water breaks second is the sanctification the bloody show and the third is the baptism of the Holy Ghost In other words the spirit of the baby cries out so see it's three in everything now this is part of who this mzc so I got different color slides here so you'll notice that but brother baham said there are three stages to Perfection for everything let's say everything can we everything by everything has three stages of perfection man is perfected in three stages through justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost brother man said the body this is what we're going to preach on next with the three bodies the body is perfected in three terrestrial that's your flesh body Celestial that's your theophany and then glorified body that's your final body Hallelujah which is not a spirit body brother man it's a perfected flesh body Hallelujah next is the Earth is perfected in three stages flood water Christ's blood sanctification and the fire which is to come to cleanse the earth now if you want to copy this just email me or something like that a baby now we already saw this the baby water blood bloody show Spirit next the brides perfected brother B says this in future home through Luther Wesley and brother Brandon's ministry that's what he says I got the quotes if you want it I know what I'm preaching this morning I done gone through this a few times here all right next we're not done brother Bram said God gives us three gifts of perfection did you know he said that he said first is Faith second is the gift of Hope brother man said the third gift is Charity amen look it up three greatest gifts look it up he said those three look at godhead the godheads perfected in three father above us son God With Us Holy Spirit in US yeah God God's perfected in threes and this is the one he brings out in the mezic he said a plant is perfected in three stages a stalk tassel grain yeah now the last two are just repeats from the previous one I'm waiting for more examples so if you guys find some good examples for me let me know I'll just add them to that right there we got five six seven we got eight right there eight obvious examples of how you got to come uh through Perfection you love the Lord amen okay praise the Lord step one justification I'm going to go uh quickly kind of through these but I want to point out a few things because we know the Earth's first step was justification by water Noah's flood was like a washing a water baptism for the earth oh yes it was brother said yeah the first step is repentance toward God repent be baptized in the name of Jesus see showing that repentance was genuine or to remit our p sins now this is important baptism just forgives our past sins that has nothing to do with your future sin because people can go through justification and then Fall Away amen remission take away of the past sin has nothing to do with the future remember the Bible said you can uh you can trotten down the spirit of Grace whereby you were already Sanctified with remember that in Hebrews Hebrews chapter 10 you can do despite the grace of God even after God Sanctified you and clean you out you can go through that and then you can go back like a pig to its water just your sin has been chopped off of what you did so when you got baptized real genuine God took his big sword of the word and cut off all your past sins glory amen because the Bible said if we say we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we don't do the truth but if we walk in the light as he's in the light we have Fellowship one with another the blood of Jesus cleans us from all sin if we say we have no sin we deceive ourselves talking about in your flesh and your spirit if we confess our sins he's faithful and just forgive us our sins cleanse us from all righteous if we say we've not sinned we make him a liar so see that's why it's important you got to go on that's why the dominations are all wrong and they're leading people to the wrong way when they say oh just say a prayer and now you're filled with the Holy Spirit impossible that's not how God did the Earth Earth that's not how God does his bride that's not how God redeems anything amen it's three works of Grace to Perfection amen so brother said notice the Anan world he had after repented he said Noah he g a water baptism covered over with water that was justification the Second Step was sanctification types the blood of Jesus purchasing the Earth did you know that he bought the Earth when the blood dropped upon the Earth he bought it because all things are purchased by Blood amen exactly right brother man says that he said but sanctification sets our minds in order for Holiness to think right the second stage cleanses the Mind sets the mind of the heart in order for Holiness see a man can repent and he's still thinking the wrong things immoral man every immoral looking woman he finds is still there so a man does not Sanctified he can be get baptized but when he sees a sexy dressed woman he's still drawn to it and can't get over it he don't got the victory like he's supposed to have but is might not be his fault necessarily because we know he's got to go through sanctification maybe he just got saved are you with me Church you see that so you gotta balance that out or if he smells a drink it's still there don't get me wrong I haven't chewed tobacco or smoked a cigarette for 14 years but when this flesh smells it it wants it but there's nothing in my soul or mind that even comes close to giving over to it why CU I'm Sanctified amen I'm cleaned out and the mind is changed sanctification is the mind the character of the person get Sanctified it's their daily habits that's sanctification amen you can't get over some daily habits check your sanctification but then when he get Sanctified that cleanses that desire out of them see it takes the want of it away I don't want to do that anymore because you're sanctified he can still be tempted right but it takes the one of it away and then he's baptized with the Holy Ghost burned up cleaned up put in the service of God sanctification only sets them aside for service you're still not in service yet unless you're filled with the Holy Ghost now brother said Christ came and shed his blood upon the Earth cleansing it and cleaning it that's the world we live in now remember Satan he said in the scripture to take him to make him break God's plan to receive it and tried to give him the world without him dying remember that he tried to give him a gift without purchasing it and brother B said you know it's the same thing with Abraham the man tried to get him the land where he was gonna bury his Sarah and Abraham said I'm not taking it but I'll buy it from you amen because it must be purchased he said let it be known this day that I bought this bearing Place see purchased Satan tried to give him the kingdom which belongs to him now he tried to give it to him as a gift but he wouldn't receive it cuz see then Satan could still have a claim on it but it had to be bought amen that's why I don't understand people begging for money all the time or begging for this and begging for that if it's if you're begging for and it's given to you then it really wasn't a real gift from God but when you wait on God and trust in God then you know you've got real Faith amen and you can wait on it and you know God brought it to you praise God is that right but people always look at for a handout in this modern USA our tax dollar is going to support a bunch of Beggars that don't want to work that could work but don't want to work I'm not gonna get on politics anyways so not and not everybody you know my parents were on uh uh welfare for a while because my dad they got laid off so I'm thankful for welfare and when my wife and I first got married uh we had that little plan the welfare plan that gave us some free food and milk and eggs and stuff like that I'm thankful for welfare but I'm talking about those that have the mentality you owe me something and don't want to pay the price like Abraham paid the price later David got offered remember after basba he fell he got offered a place to set up an ALT he said I will not accept it but I will buy it amen I will pay the price and I'll I'll make sure that this is truly ours so you can't take it back later even as a son of man came to be ministered to I'm sorry came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life as a ransom a ransom is a price for redeeming Jesus gave his life as a price to redeem you and I amen the Bible said we were redeemed in First Peter chapter 1 with the precious blood of Jesus Christ how many love the Lorden redeem means to liberate by paying the ransom amen hallelujah so you were bought back when Jesus blood dropped upon the Earth he said I have bought this Earth and guess what your bodies were laying there in the earth amen so your bodies naturally have been baptized in water in those days right your bodies have been purchased by the blood of Jesus Christ is that right and soon they'll be changed into a glorified body amen God has even purchased and washed your natural flesh if he done all that how much more your soul praise God Amen but man say your body's part of the earth so Jesus wased and purchased it I just preached it so I'm going to I guess I jumped ah head a little bit sorry says it see it was blood was shed at Calvary dropped upon the Earth to redeem the Earth and you are of these other parts that draw out this earth the earth you're a part of the earth your body and your soul is a part of God an attribute of God glory amen hallelujah look what he says next and you being a part of the earth it's Redeemed by it see your flesh was redeemed it was bought that's why you can say Satan get out of my body cuz Jesus purchased his body amen the literal body I'm talking about Hallelujah he bought it yes amen that's why brother man said in this he said you hear me on the tape say take your hands off God's Property he bought it Church by sheding that Holy Blood and we have a right to take God in his word and believe every promise to keep this thing healthy amen glory it's been baptized by Noah's day it's been purchased by the blood of Jesus Christ amen he said your body was justified under Noah's baptism Hallelujah you believe that amen and your flesh when it dropped upon there the Earth is be cleansed by fire the place where you live with the baptism of the Holy Ghost a dwelling place for Christ and his bride amen step three is a baptism the Holy Ghost types the fire that will burn the Earth he said then it is now to get a fire baptism see what happened Christ called repentance and sanctification and with the fire of God came down and burn out all the filth come down and dwells in the human heart talking about how it applies to you and I but it has to go through a baptism of fire Holy Fire of God which cleanses the earth and the heavens around it then it's purchased that the redeemed can live on it live in a place I'm G skip ahead he says holy fire from God comes down from God out of heaven and burns it up to make it ready for God to dwell did you notice the Bible said even the elements remember the periodic table of elements from science I don't remember much about that all other than they were just called elements but all those will be burn up and God will start over again amen hallelujah for God in the new world that is to come is to dwell on the earth he said God dwells in the human heart brother man said you're right but he the bride becomes one and they go to their home in the new world and the same Plan of Redemption is used to redeem both world and the persons that live in it amen Glory the Bible said the Earth is reserved unto fire it's got a it's got a a date coming up it's got an appointment it's got a reservation time to get a fire baptism sir oh so do you if you're a Christian amen you've got an appointed date a certain time and and Jesus Will baptize you with the Holy Ghost in fire our bodies are reserved under Fire Hallelujah the Holy Ghost Fire oh my oh yes come of the day of God where the heavens being on fire the heavens the atmosphere will be on fire and dissolve the elements shall melt with fervent heat now I'm taking this right in the order brother randoms teaches it in most cases next brother R after the shows the three Works he goes into how a new Earth does not mean a brand new Earth it just means a b over Earth on the outside shell we'd say he calls it he says the frame Remains the the same but he's got to burn all the sin off around it and in all the atmospheres okay so I'm going to go kind of fast for this because that's not very hard for it's not like a big doctrinal debate we have well let's see I'm not g to spend as much time on that because it's just kind of simple okay the new Heavens the new Earth the heavens being on fire should be dissolved new heavens and new earth so it says new Earth new Heavens now he said' one if you read these passages one might be led to think that the whole planet will be destroyed but a close study with the help of the Holy Spirit we can see the truth of this that's what we're going to do it's only the atmospheres around it and the sin that's upon the Earth that will be destroyed what does it do the thistle sickness death politics sinful man sinful woman evil spirits will be gone away and annihilated because we're going to live right here brother Brandon says right here is where we live the thistles germs and things will be completely taken away he said and all the heavens above us in here is contaminated with evil spirit now I don't have the scripture but I know there's one in Hebrews where the Bible said that um the heavens have to be purged as well because demons are allowed to go before the The Throne of God and accuse Jose day and night or sister marelen or brother J they're allowed to go there but thr the Throne of God day and night and accuse us because of that the heavens need purged amen glory it's in Hebrews I don't have the scripture in front of me but I can find I just have time with all the other ones I just forgot to put it down there but brother said even the heavens need purged all right now the old world the framework was not destroyed by a water the world was only washed off it's got its baptism so will the framework remain though it be burnt by fire it don't destroy the Earth it just destroys the sin that's on it okay so here's the framework the core outer core mantle you know this from school whatever more this remains all the same the only thing that's going to change is the outside here comes sin is present right now but there's coming of fire that's going to be so great it's gonna burn everything okay you have your fire you know Burns atmospheres okay then sin is gone it's a sin cleansed Earth and now the framework Remains the Same inside it just burned all on the outside yeah does that help he talks to brother Leo he says see it doesn't mean the Earth the planet is going to pass away but the world Cosmos the politics the Sinners germs disease will pass away can you say Amen to that Peter said a melt with fervent heat not the planet The Works therein and that's what the Bible says the earth and the works that are therein shall be burned up I don't see any head spinning yet so I'm going to keep going when I see head spin I'll slow down a little bit I'm I'm just kidding but I don't want to go too fast but I think so this might you might have heard on the tape a few years ago or maybe last week or something like that I want to get to the most important things okay I'm gonna skip past that okay I like this too brother B says not alog together just a literal fire like brother said La brother Bram said lava is GNA come up out of the earth and Destroy brandom Tabernacle he said that he said lava is gonna destroy this Tabernacle here he said in questions the answer 64 right so you see that he said there's going to be fire from the inside of the earth spew out and there's gonna be fire from the heavens as well there's also a holy fire that will take away Satan and all of his all the Devils both Heaven and Earth killing all the germs all the insects even the H2O will explode think of that talk about a noise if they split an Adam and there was so much noise and light what's going to happen when they destroy all the water too with all the Adams in there right look brother giv a t you know when a man receives a baptism of fire there's a lot of noise around there too when the earth gets baptized there's a lot of noise brother it's the same way when you're born again amen glory they think that's a shame to hear people scream and shout like that just wait till the Earth gets a baptism oh my now all the outside the crust and hundreds of feet below it will just simply be completely demolished the holy wrath of God will come upon it will cleanse it will change the entire surface of the Earth not all the inside just the surface he said maybe hundreds of feet below the surface praise God so now brother man used the new word the Earth will be renovated not annihilated just like you're renovated Jesus said Heaven Earth shall pass away in other words Heaven Earth shall be changed so instead of pass away he used the word changed no not annihilated for later we see a New Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven and sitting upon this Earth it doesn't mean it'll be annihilated the systems will be changed again in Matthew 5:5 Jesus said the meek shall inherit the earth it isn't going to just have another Earth it's going to be the same Earth the baptism of fire only cleanse it make it fit place for his Meek to live in just like he did us his creation to live in before he could come in it he had to give us a baptism of fire then the Holy Ghost could come in the baptism of fire so who's that talking about when he says the meek shall herit the Earth he's talking about the people that live in the new city sir praise God that's who will inherit the earth the true Meek the true humble that submit to all the word of God that's meekness submitting to the word of God not just acting all kind and nice and trying not to step on brother Jean's toes and brother Andy's toes and trying to be like a real softspoken man soft spoken preacher that's fine I mean if you want to do that if God leads you to do that that's fine but what you need is to submit to God Amen and obey the word and Let the Fire come upon you and change your life amen then we get that baptism fire Holy Ghost can come in what does it do it burns up everything contrary to the word out of you it won't believe nothing else but the word because it is the word you're the same man in stature that you was when God called you the same woman so the same the same 5 fo 11 frame that went there to worship and praise God the day after my wedding and then I got the holy ghost in the service during the I believe during the song service and when I walked out I was the same stature same height same everything I had a little wet face because of my tears and praising God but in the same stature I was the same exact thing but on the inside I was a new man I had new life I had a fire I had a Zeal I had a love I never experienced before say man but fire on the inside amen it was a regeneration the old life passed away the old desires passed away used to like to drink cuss fuss stew and run around immoral just that that thing just died if we could say can we just say just died ready just died that died yeah you don't fuss anymore you don't cuss anymore praise God that died because the fire already cleaned it out and burned it out it's already out of your life see then you was sayings instrument now you are redeemed that's the way the world would be the same way redeemed new Heavens new Earth just like you're a new creature the Greek word anybody knows your new cre creat creation a new creation in the same old Temple Glory again the meek inherit the earth it isn't going to just have another Earth it's going to be the same Earth I'm trying to get the Plan of Redemption here before if I don't get nothing else so brother B if you don't get nothing else I he said I want you to see the Plan of Redemption those three works of Grace if you can get that he said he'd be happy like he did us before he could come he had to give us the baptism of fire the Holy Ghost come to live in the fire baptism I'm doing pretty good I'm 27 minutes in and I got 73 slides done already praise the Lord I don't see anybody passed out either eyes crossed I see that that's pretty good too says in the great age to come in the renovation you're going to burn it up like the fire to burn all the worldly things off like you do the Christian you save him you baptize him you sanctify then renovate the world from him amen and to claim him then is your own by putting the holy spirit in him Hallelujah that's what we did with this church we just renovated it the owner walked in and said my she didn't use that word but that's basically what she was saying what a renovation you've done to this place same frame same everything but all the marks on the wall and the old dirty nasty carpet all of it got we'd say torn out of here burned up but not really but it got it got renovated and all behold All Things become new praise God so God renovates the world from us cleans all our dirty spots now brother B then goes into this I know it might seem out of order but I'm just going with the way the prophet taught it okay I won't do that with who this MZ because that's an even deeper subject than this to my opinion this is a simple subject compared to who's this MZ we'll get to that later by God's grace um says this be not ignorant we read the scripture 1,000 years is one day how many knew that the Bible tells us we read this in our text one day with the Lord is as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day now the bride you know this they lived and reign with Christ a thousand years so the bride has to have one day with Christ amen praise God they sit on the throne they're given judgment they get to rule during the Millennium and things like that we'll get to that as well the Bible said the rest of the Dead live not until the thousand years were finished so only the Blood Washed bride and those 144,000 seal with the Holy Ghost and Christ as far as we can tell now there's a few questions on that but for the most part let me say like that because brother man said he said it looks like there might be nations in the Millennium it looks like there might not be he said I don't know I don't have the answer until God shows me but I'm saying those that live in the city or those not City those that live near the temple with Christ and those that live in the millennium are those who are Blood Washed and the rest who didn't get the Holy Ghost they don't live until the thousand years is over and they that live will reign a thousand years that's one day now look what brother man says the Millennium Reign is not the new Earth right so the Millennium is not that pyramid coming down that's after the Millennium we're talking about the new Earth that the new Earth that receives that holy city but brother M make sure he tells him the Millennium is not the new Earth he said the Millennium Reign is a thousand years he said the Millennium is just a resting place a period not all the new heavens and the Earth it's a type of the old seven day out of Eden the seventh day after he made the world the seventh day he rested in Eden and the Millennium remember God rested on the seventh day in Genesis chapter 1 you remember that but it got interrupted by sin so God never got to finish his his thousand years with his little Adam and Eve but he's gonna get that right that's what the Millennium is all about right amen the Millennium is not the end of it there will still be time after the Millennium the Millennium is a space of time not the new Earth so the future home is not the Millennium the future home comes after the Millennium this is what I showed on Thursday day one was a thousand years that's like en O's age there and then this is like Noah's day all right so after 2,000 years the prophet says God does something every 2,000 years right hey vard what's your name Sir William night let's give William round Applause well thanks for coming William nice to have you sir I never seen him before so I want to make sure I greet him so that was about 6,000 years ago that was day two day three was the next thousand day four was the next thousand that's when Christ was on the earth day five was the first thousand years after Christ now we're in the church ages we're now finishing up this sixth day right a day with is the Lord is a thousand years next comes the fire of the earth now my other Earth disappeared I used to have other earth right there I'm not sure what happened I had Earth there sorry about that anyway so day seven will be the Millennium so there's the word Millennium God wants his seven day yeah God had six days the seventh got interrupted now Satan's had six but God's going to get his seven back amen that right now the Millennium is not the seventh day I'm s I'm sorry the Millennium is the seventh day forgive me but there's an eighth day we know is coming next the eighth day is the new heavens and the new Earth the eighth day is the New Jerusalem that's what we're preaching this morning the new city our future home amen it's not up in heaven heaven comes down to earth brother random says amen hallelujah people always say oh in heaven One Day in heaven one day they don't even know what they're saying Heaven comes down to earth my friends and we get to dwell on the earth for all eternity that's right so now the Earth has been a fire baptism now this future home can come down and Crown the Earth that's the Eighth Day brother said see the world has now almost 6,000 years every 2,000 years I had a destruction I'm going just skip past that I've already taught on that I've already taught on this you've already seen this every 2,000 years Noah Messiah son of man vot to the Gentiles and goes back to the Jews okay next he says this now notice this Millennium is a type of the seventh day praise the Lord then comes the white Throne judgment see we still have judgment we're still in time in the Millennium it's not a day it's 1,000 years now I need I know I need to study more on the Millennium but one thing I know is this we're taught from the Bible and brother Brandon the Bible said they shall build houses and shall inhabit the Millennium is a time where we build you build brother Jesse you don't have much skills well I will have skills over there I might not have the handyman skills right now brother Kevin I can hardly you know make something straight and maybe make a birdhouse hardly but over there I'll build if I can't build with the hands I'll build by the spoken word amen hallelujah it's exactly right but the new Earth he's already went and prepared the place it's built we have nothing to do with the building of it and remember the seventh Feast was the Feast of Tabernacles where they built booths so The Seven Feast types the seventh day the millennium and now in the book of Isaiah now he goes to Isaiah we're not going to read that today because I want to make sure we get to it brother use that text for the Millennium we'll have a whole another sermon on the Millennium I'm not ready for it now like I said I've been pouring myself into the three bodies and who's this mezic and future home now the New Jerusalem is after go and Magog now if you want to copy this next one I did this in 2008 it's so small don't try to read it but I put everything in order that I felt led uh after reading brother bram's message okay but this is the one I showed on Thursday tonight this is the apostal order of end time events you have The Binding of the tears that's what's going on now all the Antichrist people churches whatever more are uniting against the word together they don't love the real word they don't want to really live all the Bible they have a form of godliness but they deny the power of the spirit to cleanse their lives they let their women cut their hair when Paul says the women should have long hair praise God they let people go and and uh they're like lot everything they see and hear torments them they go to movies and TV shows and sports and pour all this filth into their souls and no wonder they have no fire for Jesus Christ no wonder they're not born again they're tormenting themselves by allowing demons that come in through their eyes and ears the eyes and ears are the gates of the soul but after this we're United with Christ The Rapture of the Bride Comes next it's the first resurrection after that the tribulation after that the battle of Armageddon then fire after the battle fire comes and burns the Earth then we can walk out on the ashes of the wicked in the Millennium not that we want to but we love Jes Jesus so we have to Satan loose is after the Millennium Battle of go and Magog that's Satan's demise he's cast a lake of fire after that battle then the white Throne judgment I had no room up here so I had to put it down here that's the second resurrection and then you have the new Heavens new Earth that's the eth day there he comes he coming down out of Heaven praise the Lord that's the best I know as of right now you love the Lorden the New Jerusalem is a result of Earth's birth pains that's what we're seeing right now now I just got an email by all the uh recent earthquakes in California and to me I just said praise the lord it's just all birth pains yeah just one another one of those pains that woman has you know and just have to go through it right it's coming into a birth brother B said brother said when he preach birth pains he said the S subject saying that the world is in birth pains now the old has to be done away with so the new can be born he said how the pains birth pains has struck the world World War I World War II she cannot stand another labor pain with these missiles and things one more war will throw her in outer space for she will now be delivered there will be a new Earth the Bible said there will be so the New Jerusalem is Eden again brother Bram says next in the future home now this new Earth let's look at it for a few minutes now he said now I'm skipping down a lot this is the same thing he already said No More Tears no more nothing in the new new Earth Satan's cast out in the new Earth and new Heavens will never be blackened again again when the new Earth is come the devil will be bound Satan will be he's loose now he's an accuser but the new Earth he will be bound and cast in Lake of Fire in the Holy Fire heavens and earth have met God and man is reconciled a restored Eden has begun see all the curse is gone so when this new city finally comes it will be heaven uniting with Earth both perfect both cleanse a perfect union between a a Godly woman prepared and a Godly Man the Earth yeah that's right amen the Bible said the new city came down as a bride adorned for its husband are you with me church so the Earth in that case represents the man because that new city represents a woman and then the Earth is restored by the same thing there can be no more cursing storms winds typhoons you are reconciled man and God is met the new Earth will be put on its Eden Beauty again man and God Has Come Together bride and bridegroom Heaven and Earth has Embrace each other God has come down to dwell among men his Tabernacle is with them no more sin God has already took up his Abode potentially because the kingdom of God is on the earth in the hearts of his Saints brother man said the baptism of Holy Ghost is potentially God living on the earth does that surprise you glory potentially he's already here living on the earth in your soul if you're born again his attribut that he was in the beginning now his attribut is redeemed what's he waiting to redeem the Earth to set his attributes on it to fulfill exactly his predestinated plan notice no more Graves no more tear drops no more Bloodshed shall never be moistened by a teardrop no more Wars I'm skipping down even the desert shall bring forth roses that old sticky desert will Blossom one day like a rose God said so there it is in Isaiah 31 the woodness and solitary place should be glad for them the desert shall rejoice and Blossom as the rose amen it's prophesied it shall happen Satan sin and sinners will be gone forever it's all done blended into eternity all that perverted that great Archangel that set there Satan all that did this evil will be destroyed praise God God and His creatures and creation is dwelling together in Perfect Harmony and the heavens and the Earth is husband and wife so is Christ and the church so Heaven and Earth or new city and Earth is a type of Christ in the church praise God and they meet in one big glorious Plan of Redemption is brought right in the bosoms of God again I love this we read this last night in our Bible time we're almost through the New Testament we just got to get through the rest of St John we're through the whole new testament reading out loud with our kids so I'm thankful for that my wife does a great job and the kids do a great job reading too Christ is preparing the New Jerusalem right now did you know that John 14 we read this last night this was a chapter we just by God's hand we read this chapter last night I thought well that's the Lord let not your heart be troubled ye believe in God believe also me in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you I and if I go and prepare a place for you I'll come again receive you unto myself that where I am there ye may be also brother B said in the new Earth there's a new city now listen don't forget this Jesus said in John 14 he would go to prepare let y let not your heart be troubled he said if you believe in God believe also in me I'm going to prepare a place for you now you know I'm going to skip that Christ is there under the construction of this New Jerusalem now don't move don't miss this Christ is in heaven today preparing the New Jerusalem now I don't know how he does this but the Bible said he intercedes for us at the same time this City's being built only God could do that for you Brothers we have to leave home if we're going to build something or go get away but he stands right there intercedes for us all the prayers all around the world and he's able to build at the same time that's my God that's the God we serve amen he's got plenty of time for because he's outside of time Glory he created time and he slips in it and out of it as he likes that's right don't move don't miss it Christ has gone is preparing a place that's been in construction for many thousand years preparing a place he said notice the Redeemer and the redeemed the Jerusalem which you not here on Earth but we are of the Jerusalem above where the word come from from predestination that's our home the New Jerusalem then is not heaven because heaven will remain after the Earth is burned over Heavens will remain they'll just be cleansed and purged right but what we call Heaven which is the Throne of God that's what we call Heaven is that what we mean when we say heaven what do you really mean when we say oh one day I going to see him in heaven one day I'll see her in heaven you mean the Throne of God where God dwells so the heavens itself the space the atmosphere will remain but the throne in heaven will come down to earth that's why I said Heaven comes down to Earth because heaven is where God is amen Revelation 212 and I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven Out of Heaven so see heaven's still there but the city comes out of it as a bride adorned for a husband remember it's not heaven brother Adam says John said I saw it coming down from Out of Heaven it's to be on the earth he ain't going to make a new world it's this one right here he's gonna burn it off cleanse it like he did you his plans must forever remain remember it's going not to be Heaven it comes down from heaven John saw the city descending from heaven like a dove like Heen okay so the type of the New Jerusalem descending was Jesus baptism that's a type brother B gives him this message when Jesus got baptized the Dove came down and brother Ram said like the dove descended so will the Heavenly City descend upon the Earth and just like our baptism just as we serve the Lord and the Holy Ghost comes down to anoint us it's a type of the new city coming down to dwell Forever on the earth brother says it's also in Harvest Time he talks about the new city same thing with Jesus look when he was baptized in water he made the preparations to begin with by the father he's raised up and here come the dove upon the lamb what do he do when he put that Dove on there he claimed part of that life next he goes into us then when a man and woman goes into God complete now not under just some spell or some under some emotion but really when the word in him becomes one God has saved that person Sanctified him renovate everything of the world away from him with the fire of the Holy Ghost and lives in that person reflecting himself that perfect man or woman living by the word praise God so can you see that there's the types of the Holy Ghost filling jesus' body and the type of the Holy Ghost filling a real Christian today is the type of that Heavenly City coming down from heaven praise the Lord the new Earth is the Throne of heaven when it comes down to earth the man says see for heaven to dwell on the earth it must the Earth must have a fire for heaven to come down and dwell now when he's talking about heaven he's talking about The Throne okay so that's the clarification the Throne of Heaven comes down to earth yet there remain three Heavens remember that second Corinthians 12:2 there's still three Heavens praise God the first Heaven brother manam says I don't have the quote here the first Heaven is the atmosphere around the earth the second heaven is all space and universe as it keeps expanding and so forth the third heaven is where God's Throne was well is right now but was when day it'll be it was one day praise the Lord am so I this just real simple I just showed it again just that coming down now that's a beautiful picture I found on the internet I don't know who gets the credit for that that sure is a nice picture I'm not selling it so I don't have to I don't have to cite it I'm not selling it not making any money off that now Heaven comes down to earth a type of Jesus baptism I to skip that one he says like a dove coming down future home future home future home future home John the Baptist saw the Heavenly Dove come down to earth on Jesus and then St John saw the Heavenly City come down to earth both John's saw the same saw something that's very similar I thought that was interesting and John means the Beloved praise the Lord now here what will the new Jerusalem look like it will be just what we like yeah now whether you know it or not if you're a bride member if you're a bride member the new Earth will be just what you like you think why is that brother Jesse well let's listen well like did you ever think of that now bride what it look like it's prepared and designed by the Divine architect what will the city look like we're talk about that he has designed it with tender hands for his beloved bride oh it's gonna look like can you imagine a man marrying a wife that's able now I wish I would have been able when I first got married to ask my wife honey I'm so rich what kind of kitchen would you like well Jesse don't you think we should talk about how many children to have first yeah but I forgot about that because we actually forgot to talk about that before I got married but everyone's a blessing we're letting God have full control how he builds and puts every little thing just exactly to her touch just what she would like amen now the Divine architect has designed the new city where we will live with his bride just to her touch no wonder the Apostle said no eye has seen or has ears heard neither enter the heart of man what God has prepared for them that love him it will be just what you like I don't go there much but sister Wendy I really like mountains I like driving when I go down to North Carolina I like driving through those mountains I just think M that's just beautiful I also like Lakes too uh the ocean was okay I wasn't really big on the ocean just kind of makes me a little scared like man where's the end of that ocean at you know back a lake I can see the other side and it's pretty you know I like that and said whatever you like it will be there for you because he designed it with you in mind now the measurements new see we're making good ground 133 out of 307 we're almost 150 almost halfway there so the measurements now the Bible says this the city's four squares so the foundation's in a square and it's 12,000 furlongs the length and bread of the height of it are equal so length width and height are all equal butam says see we find out it's 1500 square see plenty of room it'll be renovated that's true by the fire there'll be no more Seas there's plenty of room for a city this large because there's no more sea there see and I'm kind of scared of seas I just realized that that's why God's gonna take it away glory amen I like that Revelation 211 I saw a new Heaven new Earth for the first and the first Heaven vers Earth were passed away and there was no more sea because God loves me amen Hallelujah now look if you go on Google you can type in the calculations from furlongs to Miles and look 12,000 furlongs is exactly, 1500 square miles brother Ram did his homework he got exactly right yeah praise God brother said God showed him the new city just wasn't something I like to study this this week God showed him that new city in a vision you know how far it would reach I measured off this week it would reach from Maine to Florida and from the Eastern Seaboard to 600 miles past west of the Mississippi you say there ain't no room when the Sea's gone there will be because nearly four fifths of the earth is in water but remember the sea is gone there's United States I just did a Google search I said from the capital Maine forget the capital Maine now to Capital Florida I forget that too but I did a search and it was uh almost 1600 miles from Capital to Capital okay but the city is500 yeah so subtract 100 miles off of my drawing there you understand what I'm saying this and look here's here's the Mississippi right here there you go there's Mississippi 600 miles past the Mississippi that's how big your home is the Lord 1500 I'm sorry 12,000 furlongs or 1500 miles so if you look on Earth it's about that big it's not that big is it compared to the rest of the earth it's a little little crown on top of that Earth little Crown the wife is the crown of the husband is that right that's exactly that's the word of God church now really we know though it's going to be over by Israel okay so it's not gonna be on the US that's where brother brother if you listen to questions answer 64 a lot of questions about is the new city going to be in Jeffersonville is the new city going to be in America do we have to move to Jeffersonville brother BR said you misunderstood and they did they misunderstand him he said while he was studying it he rejoiced because he realized all the people that traveled to his church travel from about 1500 miles yeah he said from Alabam up to Jeffersonville and Colorado across the Jefferson he said oh my his starts crying he said he said they come from the East and West amen they come from the lands of the far to die with his Kings to Feast with his guest how blessed his pilgrims are amen glory that's how our church is they come from the East and the West don't they Wendy comes from the West the AL saints come from the East they come from the East and West whenever I share out with people you have people in church that drive two hours they're like what I wonder if they start wonder what kind of things do you preach just this Bible right here just that's all I preach just this Bible and if I Don't Preach something in this Bible I'll repent of it praise God hallelujah he said the bread and the height are the same he said 1500 miles of tra transparent gold the Bible says the city's Four Square the length and the breadth and the height of it thereof and the city was pure gold like unto clear glass now the city must be a pyramid right can't be a cube right brother B tells us why makes really good sense right it's logical we'd say most people think it's a cube because they see four square but it's impossible to be a cube if not there's going to be a lot of Shadows right right if the new cities a cub there's going to be a lot of Shadows on the earth and people won't be able to walk in the light amen Church won't be able to walk in the light if it's a cube so it can't be a cube it's got to be a pyramid but now that don't mean it's necessarily a cube or Square there's another geographical measure that the dimensions are the same and that's a pyramid let me draw it brother draws it said notice the dimensions the angle the same all of them length by height there's another measure the pyramid proves it so it can't be this it's got to be that both are for square because the base of the pyramid is Four Square all four measurements are all the same praise God but now he says see you got to have that City it's a Holy Mountain remember the Bible calls it my Holy Mountain Glory when have you ever seen a cube-shaped Mountain church it's IR logical cubes are always mountains pyramid shaped is that right then he quotes uh Isaiah 65 they shall not harm or destroy and all my Holy Mountain the city is not a cube it's a mountain so it's just a great Mountain like the pyramid the city is on the mountain a city on a mountain a mountain on top of a mountain a pyramid on top of a pyramid and the church said amen that's how God wants his final City to be a pyramid on top of a pyramid oh I love it church I love it the throne cannot be seen if the walls are straight up and down just like a cube so it must be a pyramid brother B said said if the walls were straight up and down the city could only be seen from the outside or the inside so if you have a cube and the throne was on top you can only see the light if you're right inside the cube right inside the city he said or from the inside the throne can only be seen from the out out side if you if you have a pyramid if you have a pyramid the Throne of Christ can be seen in every direction Hallelujah north south east and west now brother said the Pyramid of Giza which is we know the Pyramid of Enoch right because no sinful man could build that lasted all these thousands of years had to been a man a man of God right the py of Giza is a witness of the pyramid shaped new city that is to come in the earth even its location I know the Egyptians came after and they decorated all up and there stuff like that but before time it was God's pyramid is it right because it was a witness all throughout all those ages that there's a pyramid coming to the pyramid Glory it was a witness to all the ages that there's statures of pyramids that need to be capped off by another pyramid amen glory and is also witness because the the pyramid will the pyramid from Heaven the new city will sit down in the Middle East right on top of Israel amen so it had to be built by a man of God had been built by Enoch had to be a pyramid because it had to type this new city this new pyramid coming from God out of heaven and it has to be on the Holy Land said this being this way would answer exactly Enoch's sign in Egypt did you know that that's Enoch's sign the pyramid would it Enoch before the end to liveing destruction when justification come and he brought forth the sign and in this pyramid is seven steps going to the king's chamber seven Church ages I preached on that few years ago I have to dig out the notes it's been a while sorry about that I don't have the notes ready today he said watch Whose station it is standing there and you'll see the day you're living in the pyramid so there's just a general there's Cairo and then there's Giza that's where the pyramid is there's Israel I got my geography right everybody okay and there's a picture of the real Pyramid of Giza and it's sitting right there look how close it is to Israel right right now something tells me the very center of that pyramid will sit right I don't know something tells me that I imagine right so there the that pyramid city is going to sit right there now the missing Capstone on Enix pyramid types Christ right yeah The Headstone so the Pyramid of Enoch or Giza is missing the headstone because Christ is The Headstone and he's not here yet but he's coming there's a special spot right for him I'll say this a special heart special spot right in your heart yes there is amen and he's coming to cap off that special spot amen and Rapture you glory Christ is The Headstone who's coming to this world to cap the Bride of Jesus Christ at the Rapture that is a sign in Egypt to let everyone know there's coming a headstone to Cap all the Believers in Jesus Christ that is the sign Enoch sign to the whole world all the rest of the stones in the pyramid are laying so perfect you couldn't run a razor blade between them weighing tons now when the pyramid cap does come the pyramid itself the body of Christ will have to be H now see he's typing that pyramid to the body of Christ and this is from statue perfect man which we've been preaching on see not only some Creed or some Doctrine it'll have to be so perfectly like Christ till when he comes he in that min ministry will fit right smack together then will come the Rapture the going home so Christ can't come down to cap off our our bride Church our pyramid bride church until our ministry looks just like Christ his was so humble people didn't know it was the Messiah was so humble that's why I don't mind having a humble Ministry but I am looking for more power right I'm thankful for the power I've seen but I am looking for more Power Glory Jesus Stand The Headstone on the throne when his Saints is Crown Him King of Kings Lord of Lord and he's The Headstone are you with me so Christ is tight by that missing headstone we're looking for a headstone we're looking for Christ now the Great Seal on a dollar bill is also a witness of the Rapture and the new city now I've been preaching an hour right now so I usually preach hour and a half I'll try not to honestly I'll try not to go sorry uh future home I don't have my pocketbook he says but get out of United States an eagle on the end see they didn't know what they were doing now they didn't put that that pyramid on there uh as a Christian thing they just did it because of Freemasonry or whatever I'm not a conspiracy theorist but I do believe there's a lot of conspiracies out there I do believe they a lot of them worship the devil I do believe that but see brother said they didn't even know what they were doing it's wrote in Latin the Great Seal neither did Caiaphas know he was prophesying when he said one man must die for the entire nation so brother said that when they made that dollar bill they were prophesying with that this is a prophecy whether they knew it or not Hallelujah so this annuate cotius is he has favored our undertakings and hasn't God blessed our nation Church they didn't even know what they they might have been Freemasons I don't care what they were God's hand was still with the Christians in this nation I don't care what they put on the dollar bill it's what God's putting on our heart that's why God's favored us amen and here it says the Great Seal like brother said now this right here novas Oro seum that means the New Order of the ages yeah we know the New Order is on there but didn't it start a good order where the the the gospel could be presented and preach to the United States and God could raise up a prophet out of this country Glory Hallelujah is that right and there's that that number right there is that 1776 the Roman numerals I know that's the Illuminati eye or whatever more but brother M said it's God that represents God too they use that symbol for evil but really it can be used for good just like brother said that uh remember the snake on a pole for all the doctors that actual symbol is a pagan symbol but they copied off of God's symbol amen look it up that healing symbol is actually a pagan but they stole it from Moses because that was Christ judged and if you look at Christ's judgment on Calvary if you look and live you shall be healed amen glory but they stole it just like they stole the pyramid that do mean I'm not gonna touch a dollar bill I'll I'll take a dollar bill I'll work my tail off for them so I can feed my little babies right yes sir there's the Great Seal here it is the city it's not a flat Cube but it leans so it can be seen what kind of God would clean off the Earth and not want to be seen by all the inhabitants of it hide himself up there in his little Cube home oh what are they doing down there I don't know what are they doing down there like here got got a cube here God's G like this better check on brother Jesse there I wonder what's he doing today but instead it's a pyan so every direction he looks it's all his children all around him Hallelujah 360 degrees of light coming everywhere light from every angle that's my God that's his throne and we're his people amen glory and upon this Holy Mountain the Lord should be descend upon his holy mountain here he is that's the reason the Capstone wasn't put on by Enoch see that's the reason the Capone has to come now the mount will be pushed up and it'll be the mountain of the Lord did you catch that but B said the Earth will have to push up a mountain to receive the city this is struggles people sometimes that's why I'm going to go a little bit slower now everybody take a deep breath ready I tell my children in that class yeah tell them to take a deep breath because I know it resets their system but also resets mine Mr Smith Mr Smith about 50 questions in one minute sometimes I'm like children take a deep breath so I'm back to that tomorrow so you pray for me tomorrow I'm really gonna need your prayers tomorrow I got two weeks off the new city which is a holy mountain will sit on this mountain yeah in the earth time of purifying baptism will F there will be volcanic such as this earth exploding and will push up a pyramid like Mountain see plenty of room to do it this whole thing will be changed the whole surface will be changed you got it it'll push up a pyramid like mountain now actually my drawing isn't very good in a moment you'll see I I have like a rectangular prism draw Mountain so that forgive me I that's my fault I didn't even think about that said this would be exactly with the word if it does which it will Isaiah 65:25 they shall not hurt or destroy and all my Holy Mountain now look at the elevation of Israel and Egypt look at the variation elevation you have Mount Si up here your Mount Lebanon over here look how look at the crazy elevation and you have the Dead Sea you have the gulf Gulf of Suez look at this different elevation and God said I'm going to raise me I can't put a mountain on top of that so I got to raise up a mountain amen reminds me of John the Baptist how The Valleys will be made level all the mountains will be brought down amen so here's what we got now this is my silly drawing here this is my computer 101 drawing here not a computer programmer but see now this should have been a pyramid so forgive me it should have gone out like this that's where I made the mistake it's a pyramid on top of a pyramid so forgive me your pastor made a mistake if I'm your pastor forgive me I know we have some visitors I'm not your pastor but I made a mistake so God has to raise that up when he's burned with fire or something brother something there around there God has to raise up a mountain to receive a mountain and it might be higher than that I just drew it a small one because we could I just wanted you to see the general picture all right okay then the mountain or then the pyramid comes down and sits upon that mountain it's a mountain on top of a mountain so the new city is a mountain on top of a mountain they ask brother BR would you please explain Isaiah 2 ver2 now I have it up here for you but brother BR says yes I did already explain that the Sunday before last that's brother BR what about this mountain in Isaiah 2:2 said I already explained it last week uh the house of the Lord shall be established in the top of the mountains and all the nations shall flow into it if you haven't w got the tape on the bride and the bridegroom suure home explains it exactly that way so if you got your Bibles Isaiah 2 verse one the word that Isaiah the son of Amos saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem and it should come to pass in the last days that the mountain of the Lord's house shall be established in the top of the mountains amen it's right there the mountain on top of the mountains it's exactly scriptural and shall be exalted above the hills and All Nations shall flow into it did we have a word-based prophet or not Church everything I've tried to show you off the year I took you back to the word that's what you have to do with hard subjects like we're talking about theophanies afterwards I'm just going to prepare you a little bit for the theophany message message if I preach something against your thinking that I don't mean to I just try to find what's found in the Bible and what matches that in the quotes yeah if I can't find a match I'll say I don't know right because I don't know I'm not God I don't know but if brother Ram lays down the scripture and with the quotes and it makes sense then praise the Lord but let me say this if it's a belief you have and it raise your faith and praise the Lord I don't want to hurt anybody's faith but we are to get rid of every tradition that's not of God but I'm not saying your tradition I'm just saying if if anything I believe is against the word let's forget it and let's just accept the word I just want to prepare everybody because I know you know we Kevin and I were talking sunny and I Wendy and I were talking and so there's a lot of different thoughts about theop and things like that so I just want to PR prepare everybody just know if I preach anything come ask me about it I want to be approachable I want to be humble and be able to repent if I'm wrong but if I'm right that I want to say praise the Lord the Lord showed me the right thing I didn't get in the flesh on that one okay I just want to do the best I can so there's light at the top of this mountain and it's typed by Si Mount siai when Moses went on top of the mountain and mount Transfiguration when Jesus was on top of the mount okay because the Bible says this Revelation 21:23 the city had no need of the sun neither the moon to shine in it for the glory of God did lighten it and the lamb is the light thereof said notice Mount Si was where God descended on top of it when he spoke to Israel a pillar of Fire he descended on top of mountain Mount Si so brother is typing it so God coming down to meet with Moses on top of Mount Si was a type of Jesus on top of the new city on the mount Transfiguration when he declared this is my beloved Son hear ye him he descended in the pillar of light and Shining brightness on the top of the mountain Before Peter James and John and represented both his glory with Moses and Elijah Glory so the light from this throne at the top of the mountain remember we just read this the lamb is the light thereof now look you catch that the lamb is the light but look also the Bible said show me a pure River of Water of Life clear as Crystal proceeding out of the Throne of God and of the Lamb so the throne is the Throne of God and the lamb because God is always invisible and the lamb is always visible don't forget that as we get into those three bodies God will always be and forever brother M said Jesus's body is the final resting place of the Holy Ghost amen glory you catch that God will always Jesus body will always be the visible image of God but God's invisible Spirit cannot be seen by man never was seen by man and never will be because it's invisible it's Eternal but Jesus said when you've seen me you've seen the manifestation of the father amen glory so the Bible says Throne of God and lamb it's not two Thrones it's one Throne where the spirit dwells in the sun and the sun rules for all eternity amen you can't get that mixed up you always got to have God perfects everything in threes Body Soul Spirit even God is perfected in Body Soul spirit in the body of Christ that's why God cannot be three persons I tell my children that at bible studied a few nights ago to have three persons listen you got to have three I wish had three more fingers up here brother Jose come on up here put up three fingers right here to have three persons you got a body Soul Spirit Body Soul Spirit Body Soul Spirit there's your Trinity three persons right is that right you have to but in Jesus the Bible said he had Body Soul Spirit and the Bible said in him dwell the fullness of the godhead bodily all that the godhead was was in those three parts and the church said let's give our brother round Applause here thank you sir that's right I told my children to have three persons you have to have three you have to have nine parts that's paganism that's tritheism brother said trinitarianism is of the devil thus sayith the Lord amen and it teaches he heathenism paganism polytheism it's a lie from the pit of Hell don't believe that God is one and his name is Jesus Christ am amen he said when you've seen me you've seen the father go like I challenged those trinitarians at one time I said show me one scripture where you have an old man a young man and a dove all sitting on a throne in heaven show me one you will never find one right because that's tritheism that's paganism that's how they draw the beautiful paintings in the Vatican and stuff like that I've seen them at least on the internet I've never been there myself you see them they draw old man a young man and a dove that's that's paganism that's heathenism there's one God and when you've seen him you've seen the father that's Jes Jesus Christ amen now pardon my little silly it's kind of silly but you understand church I know it's kind of silly forgive me that throne's pretty big but that's Jesus sitting on a throne I'm just doing it there so you have a picture in your mind do you like pictures is that okay I thought people like pictures people told me I like your slides and some people like that so I thought well brother man called it his class I'll try to help the class understand it you knowen I am a teacher but I'm not going to make this a class it's just funny that brother calls this congregation as class during the Seven Seals he says that okay so the light comes out of the lamb and so you have this white radiant light proceeding in all directions like I said 360 Degrees all around the light proceeds from the lamb he is the light of the world okay oh sorry I forgot to flash him yeah Mercy the new city of the new Earth the new creation the city on the hill with the throne on top of it the throne up here on top the Dwellers all up and down this mountain on this Throne 1500 miles high the whole world will see the light of the world Jesus sitting on the throne on top of the world top of the church top of Mount Zion Glory which is 1500 miles half the size of United States and raise his Plum up till you can see him in the world over 1500 miles high there he is I'm closing with this now look at brother says next brother Bram said there is a pillar of fire hovering over his head as he sits on the throne does that surprise you we've had a pillar of fire in our day above a prophet William brandom that surprise you says on the top of the mount will set the lamb the city will need no light for the lamb is the light of the city thereof and above the lamb will be the father which is the logos God the great light the Eternal Light that'll just shine above the throne and Jesus will not be on the father's Throne he'll be on his throne and the father will hover over the son which the father and son will be one Hallelujah isn't that beautiful church God always letting us know through all eternity he is the pillar of fire he is God he is Christ Christ and the father are one and this answers to this at this time the son commited the kingdom back to the father brother bar tells this in questions answers while they're yet speaking I'll answer before they can think I'm thinking of them that's right Jesus will commit a perfect age to the perfect Living God that he has redeemed and given over to the fathers that right will turn to God the Father which is Spirit not a man spirit all nature of goodness gathered together that's God the city with the throne in the top and he is ascended up on the throne that perfect Kingdom the time when the kingdom that Jesus is to surrender to the father that God might be all in all do you know the Bible taught that Jesus Reigns through the Millennium as son of David when the new city comes Jesus gives the kingdom back to the father amen that's right well that's the Bible take out your Bibles let's close to this you know your Bible this is 1 Corinthians 15 is a powerful chapter yeah it's got the new it's got the new Earth a new city and the Rapture all in it Mer but every man his own order Christ the first fruits after they that are Christ that is coming then cometh the end so the End of Time Glory the end of time is this when he shall delivered up the kingdom to God even the father so when this visible son Returns the kingdom back to the father other words say now it's all in your control father oh my when he shall put down all Rule and all authority so look he's ruling and has all authority over all the earth now he's ruling the nation with a rod of iron oh for he must reain till he have put all enemies under his feet so after the white Throne judgment all enemies are put under his feet glory to God all demons are judged they're thrown the Lake of Fire all everyone's under his authority and now he comes upon the new Earth and he reigns until all enemies are under his feet now as son of David the last many that will be destroyed is death at the end of the white Throne judgment death is cast in Lake of Fire how many know that for he ha put all things under his feet so see that eternal spirit allowed that body of that son when he saith all things are put under him it is Manifest that he is expected which did put all things under him and when all things shall be subdued unto him then shall also the son also be subject unto him that put all things under him that God may be all in all yes remember Jesus said after his resurrection Matthew 28919 he said all power and authority is given unto me right and now he goes back to the father and said okay I've done what you asked me to do now the kingdom is back for your it's all yours are you with me Church yeah amen that's a great mystery I'm not even pretending sister marel to understand that all the way I'm not even going to pretend to do that I don't but I know that's what the Bible said see because God must Reign Over everything even that Creative Body of his son is that right to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even also as I overcame and sat down with my father in his throne Isaiah 6524 it should come to pass that before they call I will answer and while they yet speaking I will hear the wolf and the lamb shall feed together and the LI shall eat straw like the Bullock and dust shall be the Serpent's meat they shall not H will destroy and all my holy mountains sayth the Lord let's stand to our feet but Lord we come to the piano here praise God Amen praise the Lord don't you love the Lord today yes is that a beautiful message brother gave us the Holy Spirit gave us that message how many thankful for that

pens here um I'm going to pass out the ballots and then brother Loris I guess you can take a seat too brother thank you sir appreciate him good to see the ropes back we miss them amen yeah amen we missed y'all hope you had a great time with your family every Sunday we missed you who needs a pen raise your hand we' like to vote for our uh officers anyone need a pen raise your hand if you need a pen remember uh as he's passing those out keep your hand up if you need a pen but joh pass it out any might need a pen okay I'm sorry but I thought we okay well I'm gonna do these I got few things I gotta Explain real quick here um I changed the ballot a little bit because I was looking through our bylaws okay um the top part there's a front and a little bit of back okay the top part is the annual congregation vote by official members according to the bylaws these are the only offices that are voted upon Pastor deacons trustee treasur Sunday school superintendent um and then there's a spot for current officers if you want to leave your office or you're content let me know this is for John bang and I after that office assignment by Pastor a song leaders not voted they're assigned by the pastor but I want to know what you're leading is one two three who are the three most gifted song leaders the ones that you feel like bringing the presence of God most and then I will try to sign that person to lead songs the most during the year okay because we want to recognize gifts praise the lord we want to do that by God's grace we want to recognize a gifted preacher if a sister's got a gift to speak in tongues or brother's got a gift to prophesy we want to recognize gifts don't we sir and use them brother B said you'll be responsible reason he said most people can't manifest gifts is because he can't trust him yet yeah so God help us to be trustworthy is that right that's true am so you put a one by John if you think he's the most gifted a two by Andy a one by me or rting somebody else if you think so put a two by the second most gifted and a third by the third most gifted okay at the bottom this is for all the members now if you want to request an interview with me to discuss questions just put a check there sign your name we can talk you feel someone's not qualified for one of these so John bang and I or Andy let us know uh I feel someone new might be qualified let me know put a check there now the last one everyone has to check I feel I complet this ballot with sincerity based upon my leadership of the Holy Spirit and sign your name now um also the last thing is um tithing if you're not a tither uh then I ask if you don't tithe then just filling this part from the bottom down because we're not going to count votes of people that uh don't pay ties because they're not official members according to the bylaws and according to brother Brandon so they can't vote on these things uh but if you don't pay ties just do from here on down I would would like their their I would like their feedback and their advice on who they think is most gifted in the spirit though I would like that okay and then if you need any counsel from me or anything like that but tith pairs only brother bam said ties are Eternal We'll preach on that in part two tonight it's on uh the Kings the brother B said the kings bring their Glory and Honor into the the new city and brother B said that's ties and offerings because ties and offerings are Eternal so TI tithers can do the whole thing those that don't tithe just start from here and go down by God's grace okay so brother van can you put on some instrumental music there back there by the grace to the Lord if you have any questions for me let me know let's just have a word of prayer before we vote here I would like feedback on here like I said if you have any feedback for me anything you want to talk to me about let me know then brother van if you could sign this housing allowance we got to sign that before you go and then also after that I'll pass out the bylaw so you're going to get a lot of paperwork here in just a moment so can we pray brother John can you come up here Leen a word of prayer brother by the grace of the Lord how many thankful for the Lord today praise God let us all uh all these things that was just said in our hearts and our minds here as we go before the Lord in prayer because I believe that with sincerity God will truly be with us and answer our prayers amen our desire for our church here let's bow our heads Lord Jesus father we thank you Lord God for this time Lord that we can come together as a body here and vote upon these things and reflect upon these things and have these things in our heart Lord for truly Lord God we want to be in your will we want your your will
