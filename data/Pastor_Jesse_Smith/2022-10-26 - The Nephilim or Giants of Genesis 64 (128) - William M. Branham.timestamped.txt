[0:02] foreign
[0:06] friends in the mattress name of the Lord
[0:10] Jesus Christ
[0:11] the purpose of this video is to answer
[0:13] the question who were the Nephilim or
[0:16] Giants of Genesis chapter 6 verse 4 and
[0:20] numbers 13 verse 33.
[0:23] there are numerous theories as to the
[0:25] identity of the Giants or Nephilim but
[0:28] only one view is correct
[0:30] God's word plainly validates the one
[0:33] correct identity of the Nephilim and the
[0:36] Holy Spirit Led God's Prophet brother
[0:38] William Branham to repeatedly teach the
[0:41] truth about this subject
[0:43] now this subject is not a major it's a
[0:46] minor because it's not related to
[0:48] Salvation
[0:50] in summary the Giants or Nephilim of
[0:53] Genesis 6 verse 4 were simply the sinful
[0:57] human offspring of Cain who was the son
[1:00] of The Serpent and Eve
[1:03] Kane was not the son of Adam as First
[1:06] John 3 verse 12 States
[1:09] these Giants were not half angel
[1:12] half-human as some erroneously believe
[1:16] therefore the Giants or Nephilim of
[1:19] Genesis 6 verse 4 were a result of the
[1:22] giant-like DNA traits being expressed in
[1:25] their bodies about 2500 Years BC
[1:28] according to Usher's timeline or about
[1:32] 200 years before the flood in Noah's day
[1:36] and then about a thousand years after
[1:38] these Giants are recorded in Genesis 6
[1:41] verse 4 more Giants showed up after the
[1:44] flood both in Moses day and David's time
[1:48] around 1500 BC and 1000 BC respectively
[1:55] here's the outline for the video
[1:57] first we'll look at the Bible origin of
[1:59] the word Nephilim
[2:01] second we'll give the true
[2:03] interpretation of Nephilim
[2:05] third we'll look at the false
[2:07] interpretation of the Nephilim
[2:10] and lastly we'll look at understanding
[2:12] sons of God and the fact there is no
[2:15] pre-existence of Souls
[2:19] Bible origin of the word Nephilim
[2:22] the Hebrew word for Giants in Genesis 6
[2:25] verse 4 is Nephilim this is according to
[2:29] the Hebrew lexicon Strong's number 5303
[2:34] this Hebrew word is used only twice in
[2:37] the Old Testament
[2:38] and the second occurrence is in numbers
[2:40] 13 Verse 33 which says and there we saw
[2:44] the Giants the sons of anec which come
[2:48] of the Giants and we were in our own
[2:50] sight as Grasshoppers and so we were in
[2:53] their sight
[2:55] now the sons of anak according to
[2:58] Easton's Bible dictionary were the
[3:00] descendants of anak spoken of in Joshua
[3:03] 11 verse 21
[3:05] numbers 13 33 and Deuteronomy 9 verse 2.
[3:09] they were probably a remnant of the
[3:11] original inhabitants of Palestine before
[3:13] the Canaanites a cushite tribe from
[3:16] Babel and of the same race as the
[3:18] Phoenicians and the Egyptian Shepherd
[3:21] Kings
[3:22] it's notable that the Philistine Giants
[3:25] whom David encountered in second Samuel
[3:27] 21 were descendants of the Anakin
[3:31] now friends it's also notable that the
[3:34] word giant is used 19 times in the Old
[3:37] Testament in the King James version but
[3:40] recall that only two of those uses are
[3:43] the word Nephilim but it's clear there
[3:46] were giants Before the Flood and after
[3:48] the flood one notable example is
[3:51] Deuteronomy 3 verse 11 it speaks of OG
[3:54] king of beishan he said he was remained
[3:57] of the remnant of giants
[3:59] he had a bed of iron which was nine
[4:02] cubits of length thereof which turns out
[4:05] to be about 13 and a half feet
[4:07] so of course he was probably a little
[4:09] shorter than 13 and a half feet perhaps
[4:12] 12 feet and so it's likely OGG was even
[4:14] taller than Goliath who was about nine
[4:16] and a half or ten feet
[4:19] the true interpretation of the Nephilim
[4:23] the Giants or Nephilim of Genesis 6
[4:25] verse 4 were simply the human offspring
[4:27] of Cain who was the son of The Serpent
[4:30] and Eve Kane was not the son of Adam as
[4:33] First John 3 verse 12 States because
[4:36] Adam was not the wicked one the Bible
[4:39] said Cain was of that Wicked one that
[4:41] Wicked one would have been the serpent
[4:43] who was possessed by Satan in the Garden
[4:45] of Eden
[4:47] this means Cain's genetic makeup was a
[4:49] perverted mixture of human genetics and
[4:52] Beast genetics since his father was the
[4:55] serpent a beast
[4:57] the serpent seed teaching that God
[5:00] originated in Genesis 3 verse 15.
[5:03] in which God himself told the serpent
[5:05] that he had offspring
[5:07] proves the original serpent in creation
[5:09] who was in the Garden of Eden had DNA
[5:12] that could and did mix with Eve's human
[5:15] DNA
[5:17] Satan possessed the Serpent's body and
[5:19] deceived the serpent into deceiving Eve
[5:22] note that Satan was not the father of
[5:24] Cain because Satan is a spirit and a
[5:27] spirit cannot procreate with a human
[5:30] for the nine Bible proofs that the
[5:32] serpent seed teaching is correct see my
[5:35] two-part video series on YouTube about
[5:37] the serpent seed or see chapter 10 of my
[5:41] 2021 book The 12 New Testament Mysteries
[5:44] revealed in the chapter about the
[5:46] mystery of iniquity
[5:49] where do the Giants of Genesis chapter 6
[5:52] verse 4 come from
[5:53] the Giants or Nephilim were a result of
[5:56] the giant-like DNA traits being
[5:58] expressed in their bodies
[6:00] about
[6:02] 2535 Years BC according to Usher's
[6:05] timeline so we see there were giants
[6:07] Before the Flood now the only logical
[6:10] explanation of how the giant DNA made it
[6:13] through the flood is that either Noah or
[6:16] one of his sons or Noah and all of his
[6:18] sons married Daughters of men or
[6:21] Daughters of Cain's lineage
[6:24] and as a result of those marriages all
[6:27] the DNA was mixed All The Offspring of
[6:30] humanity that came out of Noah's family
[6:31] had this DNA that contained the ability
[6:35] to create offspring that were giants
[6:38] because cane seed or the serpent seed
[6:41] had intermingled and made it through the
[6:43] flood through Noah and his son's
[6:45] marriages a person's natural seed is not
[6:49] what is important anymore like it was at
[6:51] the beginning
[6:52] in the New Testament the most important
[6:54] seed is the spiritual seed according to
[6:57] First Peter 1 verse 23.
[6:59] being born again not of corruptable seed
[7:02] but of The Incorruptible by the word of
[7:04] God which liveth and abideth forever
[7:08] we no longer have to be concerned about
[7:10] the physical seed line we were born
[7:12] under because all human seed is
[7:14] corruptable
[7:15] it is our privilege and High Calling of
[7:17] God to seek the spiritual seed or the
[7:20] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[7:22] which is offered to all men although we
[7:24] know all men will not receive it the
[7:26] spirit and the bride say come that
[7:28] whosoever will come and drink of the
[7:30] Waters of Life freely
[7:33] so A Thousand Years After the flood you
[7:36] have Giants showing up in the days of
[7:37] Moses Joshua and then 1500 Years After
[7:40] the flood you have giant still in the
[7:42] days of David
[7:44] God's Vindicated Prophet brother William
[7:46] Branham repeatedly taught these truths
[7:48] here's one quotation from Brother
[7:50] Branham about this subject in 1964 and
[7:54] he plainly states that the Giants were
[7:55] simply offspring of Cain's lineage
[7:58] because he was of the Serpent's Seed
[8:00] let's listen to the quote
[8:03] and Genesis 6 4 and to the flood where
[8:07] did the Giants come from
[8:11] that's a good one
[8:12] very good
[8:14] question
[8:15] where do these Giants come from Adam
[8:16] wasn't a giant as far as we know plus
[8:18] what the Bible has said so he was just
[8:20] an ordinary man
[8:21] where did they come from now uh this is
[8:25] a great dispute
[8:26] and this was just handed to me it's on a
[8:29] big dark paper and it's uh our big dark
[8:32] letters on white piece of paper
[8:35] now
[8:36] these Giants
[8:38] I believe it was one of somebody you're
[8:40] not long it might have been Josephus I'm
[8:42] not I'm not saying that now Minister
[8:44] brothers that it was you'll see if
[8:45] that's what it seems to me like that it
[8:47] might have been him or Dr Scofield or
[8:49] some of them that said that these Giants
[8:52] that was in the land
[8:54] were actually
[8:56] Fallen spirits
[8:58] of God that listened to to Satan's tale
[9:02] uh and he told in the uh around in
[9:05] heaven and it was Michael trying to
[9:07] raise a war with my friend heaven was
[9:09] kicked out that these sons of God saw
[9:12] the daughters the man and of these
[9:15] Giants was in the land at that time that
[9:17] they pressed themselves into human flesh
[9:19] if you do that you make Satan a creator
[9:23] you can't do it
[9:26] so the Giants never come from pressing
[9:29] themselves in these Giants were the sons
[9:32] of Cain
[9:34] whose father was the serpent who looked
[9:38] in every respected exactly like a man
[9:40] but was a great huge fellow
[9:44] bigger than a man
[9:46] and that's where those Sons came from
[9:49] because they were the sons of King
[9:51] because they were Canaanites
[9:53] in the land of Canaan where they come
[9:55] from and that's where Cain went to
[9:58] and that was that also proves the
[10:02] Serpent's Seed it was a different race
[10:03] of people all together
[10:08] that was serpent seeds
[10:10] see ah that serpency questions in here
[10:14] so we're gonna get to it and I want you
[10:16] to bear this democracy
[10:18] now just to give us background see they
[10:20] were they were Canaanites
[10:23] these Giants and they were the sons of
[10:27] Cain which was the son of the serpent
[10:31] and the serpent was a giant man
[10:36] great monster sort of a fella not a
[10:40] reptile at all
[10:41] beautiful
[10:44] is the most subtle of all the beasts to
[10:46] the field
[10:49] then friends of course After the flood
[10:51] the genetic traits of giants made it
[10:55] through the flood as one of Noah's
[10:56] daughters-in-laws had to have been of
[10:59] the serpent seed or perhaps know his
[11:01] wife or perhaps know his wife and all of
[11:04] Noah's daughters-in-law
[11:06] so numbers 13 verse 35 speaks of the
[11:10] Giants of anec
[11:13] and then second Samuel 21 verse 22 says
[11:16] there were four Sons born of the giant
[11:18] in gath
[11:20] and they fell by the hand of David and
[11:22] by the hand of his servants
[11:24] one more point about Genesis 6 verse 4
[11:27] is that there are three groups of people
[11:29] mentioned which few people seem to
[11:31] understand the first group is the Giants
[11:34] or Nephilim in the first part of the
[11:36] verse but then in the second part of the
[11:38] verse two more groups of people are
[11:39] mentioned the second group is the sons
[11:42] of God which are The Godly seed of Seth
[11:44] these sons of God sinned against God by
[11:47] marrying sinful woman which are called
[11:49] the daughters of men
[11:51] their children then became sinful
[11:53] intellectual Believers as the Bible says
[11:56] when the sons of God came in unto the
[11:58] daughters of men and they bear children
[12:00] to them the same became Mighty Men which
[12:03] were of old men of renown
[12:07] so the result of Believers the sithites
[12:09] marrying unbelievers the daughters of
[12:11] men were unbelieving intellectuals this
[12:14] intermarrying among Believers and
[12:16] unbelievers is one reason God became
[12:18] grieved with the antaluvian world and
[12:20] destroyed it with the flood as Genesis 6
[12:23] verses 5 through 7 teach
[12:25] God saw the wickedness of man it was
[12:28] great in the earth and every imagination
[12:30] of the thoughts of his heart was only
[12:31] evil continually
[12:33] it repented the Lord that he had made
[12:35] man on the earth and agreed him at his
[12:37] heart and the Lord said I will destroy
[12:39] man whom I've created from the face of
[12:41] the Earth
[12:43] the false interpretation
[12:46] the most popular false interpretation of
[12:48] the Nephilim are giants is that they
[12:50] were the result of Fallen Angels or
[12:52] demons having sexual relations with
[12:55] women this belief claims either one
[12:58] Fallen Angels or demons can take on
[13:00] flesh by their own choosing or two
[13:03] fallen angels in their spiritual bodies
[13:05] somehow impregnated women
[13:08] both claims are undeniably false
[13:11] first Fallen Angels or demons cannot
[13:13] take on flesh bodies by their own
[13:15] choosing there is not one Bible example
[13:18] of Fallen Angels or demons being able to
[13:21] take on or put on flesh bodies at their
[13:23] own choosing and then go and procreate
[13:26] and reproduce themselves
[13:28] it is true that Fallen Angels or demons
[13:30] can possess human bodies and Minds to
[13:33] different degrees but those possessions
[13:36] take place only when a human opens up
[13:38] his mind to the Demon's influence
[13:41] this type of possession happens
[13:43] constantly and has been happening since
[13:45] Satan influenced Eve's mind to partake
[13:48] of the fruit of adultery in Genesis
[13:50] chapter 3.
[13:52] a few verses that are often
[13:54] misunderstood by those who hold this
[13:56] false view are Genesis chapters 18 19
[13:59] and Hebrews 13 verse 2 among other
[14:03] numerous examples
[14:05] in Genesis 18 and 19 God comes to
[14:07] Abraham in a flesh body along with two
[14:10] angels that have flesh bodies and all
[14:12] three eat meat butter and milk prepared
[14:15] by Sarah as Genesis 18 verse 8 says
[14:19] Hebrews 13 verse 2 says these
[14:21] appearances were Holy Angels Take on
[14:24] flesh bodies can still happen today
[14:27] be not forgetful to entertain strangers
[14:29] for thereby some have entertained angels
[14:32] unawares
[14:34] but in both of these cases God was the
[14:37] one who had the Holy Angels and himself
[14:39] put on flesh bodies
[14:42] and they did not procreate they simply
[14:44] minister to the needs of the Believers
[14:46] which agrees with Hebrews 1 verses 13
[14:49] and 14.
[14:50] but to which the Angels said he at any
[14:52] time sit on my right hand until I make
[14:54] thine enemies thy footstool are they not
[14:57] all ministering Spirits sent forth to
[14:59] minister for them who shall be Heirs of
[15:02] salvation
[15:04] so the conclusion is obvious God is the
[15:07] only one who has the power to put a
[15:10] flesh body on himself or flesh bodies on
[15:14] angels and he only did this with Holy
[15:16] Angels and he never did this with fallen
[15:19] angels
[15:20] he never did it to procreate he did it
[15:23] to minister to Abraham and Sarah and
[15:26] also lot
[15:28] Satan and his fallen angels can
[15:31] transform themselves as angels of light
[15:33] According to second Corinthians 11 verse
[15:36] 14 and they can possess human beings but
[15:39] they cannot take on flesh bodies by
[15:41] their own power for that power is
[15:43] reserved by God for himself to use alone
[15:47] God does not give that power to Satan or
[15:50] the Fallen Angels
[15:52] secondly fallen angels in their own
[15:54] spiritual bodies cannot impregnate women
[15:56] in flesh bodies God's unchanging law of
[16:00] reproduction in Genesis 1 verses 11 and
[16:02] 12.
[16:03] state that a seed can only bring forth
[16:06] of its own kind
[16:07] also the Bible never says angels have
[16:10] children
[16:11] Jesus plainly teaches Angels do not
[16:13] procreate or have children as the Bible
[16:16] never speaks of female angels only male
[16:19] and Jesus said this in Matthew 22 verse
[16:21] 30. for in the resurrection they neither
[16:24] marry nor given a marriage but are as
[16:26] the angels of God in heaven
[16:29] before moving on the reason the false
[16:32] interpretation of the Nephilim is
[16:33] believed by so many is because it is
[16:36] close to the truth but also very far
[16:38] from the truth
[16:40] the aspect of the Nephilim false
[16:42] interpretation that is so close to the
[16:44] truth is
[16:45] a fallen angel Satan did possess a body
[16:49] and use that body to procreate which was
[16:52] when Satan possessed the beastly body of
[16:54] the serpent in Genesis chapter 3 in
[16:56] order to produce Cain through Eve's
[16:59] adulterous act with the serpent
[17:01] but Satan did not create his own body to
[17:05] produce the serpent seat he simply
[17:07] possessed the serpent body that God had
[17:09] already created Satan is not a Creator
[17:12] God Alone is a creator
[17:15] again the reason this false
[17:17] interpretation is so close is because
[17:19] fallen angels can possess human bodies
[17:22] but not bodies they create
[17:26] demons cannot press themselves into a
[17:28] flesh body
[17:29] or change their state from a spiritual
[17:32] body to a flesh body
[17:34] while it's true Holy Angels can be
[17:36] clothed in flesh bodies for a short time
[17:39] period and appear as men as the two
[17:42] angels that visited lot and the angel
[17:45] that wrestled with Jacob prove this is a
[17:47] power God reserves to himself alone and
[17:50] uses it only with Holy Angels so they
[17:52] can minister to The Heirs of salvation
[17:55] like Abraham and Sarah lot and Jacob
[17:58] just as a few examples
[18:01] the lie that is so wrong and so far from
[18:03] the truth in this false interpretation
[18:06] is that Fallen demons in their spiritual
[18:08] bodies can procreate with human women
[18:10] which is wrong for two reasons
[18:13] first Fallen Angels or demons do not
[18:16] have the power to change their bodies
[18:17] from spiritual or celestial bodies into
[18:20] human bodies or flesh bodies in order to
[18:23] procreate
[18:24] and second as stated earlier Jesus
[18:27] plainly teaches Angels do not marry
[18:30] like brother random said if you believe
[18:32] Fallen Angels changed their being from
[18:35] spiritual to flesh then you have made
[18:37] Fallen Angels equal to God but God
[18:40] repeatedly says he alone is the Creator
[18:42] and has no equal Isaiah 44 24 says I am
[18:47] the Lord that maketh all things that
[18:49] spread forth the heavens alone that
[18:51] spreadth the bra of the Earth by myself
[18:54] Isaiah 40 verses 25 and 26 says to whom
[18:58] then will you liken me or shall I be
[19:01] equal saith the Holy One behold who hath
[19:03] created these things he called them all
[19:06] by names by the greatness of his might
[19:08] for that he is strong in power not one
[19:11] faileth in Isaiah 46 verse 5 to whom
[19:15] will you liken me and make me equal and
[19:18] compare me that we may be like
[19:23] understanding sons of God and the truth
[19:26] there is no pre-existence of Souls
[19:30] some Believers misunderstand the phrase
[19:32] sons of God in Genesis chapter 6 verse 4
[19:35] and also in Job 1 verse 6 and Job 38
[19:39] verse 7 among other places
[19:41] the phrase sons of God can refer to
[19:44] Heavenly Angels or human Believers in
[19:47] the one true God Jehovah of the Old
[19:50] Testament and now Jesus of the New
[19:52] Testament
[19:53] so the phrase sons of God has to be
[19:55] rightly divided based upon the context
[19:57] that you find it in the correct
[20:00] understanding of sons of God is proven
[20:01] by the fact that human Souls do not
[20:04] pre-exist as both the Bible and God's
[20:07] Prophet brother Branham teach
[20:09] in chapter 4 of the exposition of the
[20:11] seven Church ages and in the sermon who
[20:14] is this Melchizedek brother random
[20:16] thought our souls did not exist as
[20:19] separate beings before we came to the
[20:20] Earth because Ephesians 1 verse 4 says
[20:23] we were chosen in the mind of Christ
[20:25] before the foundation of the world our
[20:28] souls were not separate beings our souls
[20:31] were thoughts of God in the mind of God
[20:34] brother random taught that we started as
[20:36] a thought of God
[20:37] then became a living soul in a flesh
[20:40] body
[20:40] after death our soul goes to a theophany
[20:43] body or Celestial body as second
[20:45] Corinthians chapter 5 teaches and then
[20:48] one day at the time of the Rapture and
[20:50] thereafter we will finally have the last
[20:52] body a glorified body
[20:55] let's listen to the quote from chapter
[20:56] four of the church age book
[20:58] when brother Ram says he does not
[21:00] believe in the doctrine of pre-existence
[21:02] of Souls
[21:03] and he said we were a thought and then
[21:06] became a thought expressed
[21:09] before I close this subject I know there
[21:12] is a question in your mind
[21:13] you will want to know if I believe in
[21:15] the doctrine of pre-existence
[21:17] I don't believe in that Mormon doctrine
[21:19] of the pre-existence of souls any more
[21:22] than I believe in reincarnation or the
[21:23] transmigration of Souls
[21:25] be careful here and see this
[21:28] it is not the person that comes
[21:30] predestinated eternally from God it is
[21:33] the word or seed that is it
[21:36] way back there too far back for the
[21:38] human mind to grasp the Eternal god with
[21:41] eternal thoughts thought and decreed
[21:43] Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated
[21:47] Romans 9 13.
[21:50] and neither was born and neither had
[21:52] done good or evil
[21:54] see it was the thought and then that
[21:57] thought became expressed and God bought
[21:59] back Jacob because Jacob alone was seed
[22:04] next let's listen to the quote from who
[22:06] is this Melchizedek where brother Brown
[22:07] said we bypassed our theophany we went
[22:10] straight from the thought of God to
[22:12] flesh body and brother random says Jesus
[22:14] came down the regular line from thought
[22:16] of God to theophany to flesh to
[22:19] glorified but humans bypassed the
[22:21] theophany stage so we did not exist as a
[22:25] separate being until God breathed the
[22:27] breath of life into our bodies and we
[22:29] became living Souls when we were born of
[22:32] our mothers
[22:37] from
[22:39] attribute to afford a foundation
[22:42] awareness means put on the land's Book
[22:44] of Life
[22:45] and for that even come the word
[22:47] theophany that could appear disappear
[22:49] and they become flesh
[22:52] and return back again
[22:55] resurrected that same body in a
[22:57] glorified condition
[22:59] but you bypass the theophany and become
[23:03] flesh man to be tempted
[23:06] by sin and then if this Earthly
[23:10] Tabernacle is dissolved we have one
[23:12] already waiting
[23:14] we have not yet the bodies
[23:17] friends this has to be the correct
[23:19] understanding from Brother Branham as
[23:21] the sons of God in Genesis 6 verse 4 can
[23:24] only be the seed of Seth who compromised
[23:27] and married unbelievers
[23:29] so the sons of God in Genesis 6 4 were
[23:32] not Fallen Angels they were humans they
[23:35] were sephites out of the lineage of Seth
[23:39] the sons of God in Job 1 verse 6 can
[23:43] only be Angels who have to report to God
[23:46] they cannot be Souls of believers who
[23:48] pre-existed because that is not a Bible
[23:51] Doctrine
[23:52] they cannot be Believers like Abel for
[23:54] the Bible says they were in the heart of
[23:57] the earth until Jesus rescued them after
[23:59] his death
[24:00] The Book of Job also shows how Fallen
[24:02] Angels cannot do anything without God's
[24:04] permission which is one reason why they
[24:06] have to present themselves before God
[24:08] all angels have to get permission to do
[24:11] their deeds
[24:12] and Job 1 verse 6 says now there was a
[24:14] day when the sons of God came to present
[24:16] themselves before the Lord and Satan
[24:18] came also among them
[24:20] so we can see from the context that
[24:22] Satan is a fallen angel and he has to
[24:24] present himself before God along with
[24:26] all the other sons of God so the only
[24:29] interpretation that makes sense is that
[24:30] these are all the Fallen Angels who have
[24:32] to present themselves before God of
[24:35] course they are bringing accusations
[24:37] against the Believers but then God is
[24:39] saying they're forgiven if they're
[24:41] confessing their sins
[24:43] but these are the Fallen Angels who have
[24:44] to get permission to do anything
[24:47] lastly in Job 38 verse 7 these sons of
[24:49] God again have to be Holy Angels the
[24:52] scripture says when the morning Stars
[24:54] sang together and all the sons of God
[24:56] shouted for Joy this was at the
[24:58] foundation of the Earth
[25:00] now those of you who know quotes from
[25:02] brother Brandon brother Brown did make
[25:04] it seem like these sons of God were
[25:05] humans but if we take his Revelation
[25:08] from who is this Melchizedek and the
[25:09] church age book we know these sons of
[25:11] God cannot be Believers because
[25:14] believers do not pre-exist as separate
[25:16] beings before coming to flesh bodies so
[25:19] these sons of God had to be angels that
[25:21] were rejoicing at the foundation of the
[25:23] earth these sons of God in Job 38 cannot
[25:27] be Believers Souls because their souls
[25:29] did not pre-exist in separate bodies
[25:31] before coming to Earth and flesh bodies
[25:33] all believers were thoughts in God's
[25:36] mind before being manifested on the
[25:38] earth in flesh bodies
[25:41] in closing
[25:42] friends I hope this video has been a
[25:44] blessing it's been on my heart for
[25:46] numerous months to make a video about
[25:47] the Giants or the Nephilim friends this
[25:50] is another exercise in rightly dividing
[25:52] the word of Truth as the Bible commands
[25:54] us and as brother Brown told us to do
[25:57] we must prove All Things by the word of
[25:59] God
[26:00] and so wonderful the revelations that
[26:02] God gave brother Branham such as who is
[26:04] this Melchizedek and of course the
[26:06] serpent seed help us understand clearly
[26:09] who these Giants or Nephilim were and
[26:12] this also unlocks the understanding of
[26:15] who the sons of God were in numerous
[26:17] contexts in the Old Testament we're
[26:20] thankful the revelation of the Seven
[26:22] Seals also opened up the fact that there
[26:24] is no pre-existence of Souls and there's
[26:26] no soul sleeping again we thank the Lord
[26:29] for the Revelation on this minor as
[26:31] Jesus Promised the Holy Ghost would
[26:33] guide us into all truth
[26:36] if you have any questions concerns or
[26:38] testimonies about this video please
[26:40] contact me
[26:43] God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[26:45] the desire of your heart
