[0:11] greetings friends
[0:12] in the name of the lord jesus christ the
[0:15] purpose of this video is to show god's
[0:16] three works of grace
[0:18] he uses to fully live inside christians
[0:22] the bible teaches that we are temples
[0:24] buildings
[0:25] or tabernacles of the holy ghost
[0:27] according to the following scripture
[0:29] first corinthians 6 19 what know ye not
[0:32] that your body is the temple the holy
[0:34] ghost
[0:35] which is in you which ye have of god and
[0:37] you are not your own
[0:39] for ye are bought with a price therefore
[0:41] glorify god in your body and in your
[0:43] spirit
[0:44] which are gods just as the tabernacle of
[0:47] moses
[0:47] in the old testament had three sections
[0:49] to it so the human being has three parts
[0:52] to their tabernacle
[0:53] the body the spirit and the soul
[0:59] first thessalonians 5 23 and the very
[1:02] god of peace sanctify you holy
[1:04] and i pray god your whole spirit and
[1:06] soul and body
[1:08] be preserved blameless unto the coming
[1:10] of our lord jesus christ
[1:12] faithful is he that calleth you who also
[1:14] will do it
[1:16] just as god desired each of the three
[1:18] sections of the tabernacle of moses to
[1:20] be holy
[1:21] today he desires to dwell inside every
[1:23] christian's body
[1:24] spirit and soul in order that he might
[1:27] purify his children
[1:28] and bring glory to his own holy name god
[1:31] uses three works of grace
[1:33] to fully redeem man and have first place
[1:36] or preeminence
[1:37] in the lives of christians as the bible
[1:39] says christ wants to have preeminence
[1:41] in all things especially our lives
[1:44] colossians 1 18
[1:46] and he is the head of the body the
[1:47] church who is the beginning
[1:49] the firstborn from the dead that in all
[1:52] things he might have the preeminence
[1:59] there are three works or steps god uses
[2:02] to completely control
[2:03] and guide the temples or lives of his
[2:06] believing children
[2:07] work number one justification work
[2:10] number two
[2:11] sanctification work number three the
[2:14] baptism
[2:15] or immersion of the holy ghost the bible
[2:18] clearly teaches
[2:19] that the first two works of grace are
[2:21] done by the working of the holy ghost
[2:23] while the third and final work is the
[2:25] coming of the holy ghost himself
[2:27] christ in you the hope of glory coming
[2:30] to seal and abide inside the soul of the
[2:32] christian
[2:33] first corinthians 6 11 and such were
[2:36] some of you
[2:37] but ye are washed but ye are sanctified
[2:40] but ye are justified
[2:41] in the name of the lord jesus and by the
[2:43] spirit of our god
[2:45] let's explain each step the first work
[2:48] is justification
[2:50] this word means to declare or pronounce
[2:52] to be just or righteous
[2:54] as such he ought to be so in other words
[2:57] the believer is righteous in the sight
[2:59] of god
[3:00] as though he never sinned in the first
[3:01] place through faith in the shed blood
[3:04] of jesus christ justification comes
[3:07] by a believer's faith in the finished
[3:09] work of jesus christ's death
[3:12] burial and resurrection therefore being
[3:15] justified by faith
[3:16] we have peace with god through our lord
[3:18] jesus christ
[3:21] knowing that a man is not justified by
[3:22] the works of the law
[3:24] but by the faith of jesus christ even we
[3:27] have believed in jesus christ
[3:28] that we might be justified by the faith
[3:30] of christ and not by the works of the
[3:32] law
[3:33] for by the works of the law shall no
[3:35] flesh be justified
[3:37] but for us also to whom it shall be
[3:40] imputed
[3:40] if we believe on him that raised up
[3:42] jesus our lord from the dead
[3:44] who was delivered for our offenses and
[3:46] was raised again for our justification
[3:50] justification takes place at the moment
[3:52] of true repentance
[3:53] when the sinner believes in christ jesus
[3:55] and turns from all their wicked ways
[3:57] faith is the foundation of each
[3:59] christian's experience
[4:00] as seen from the teachings of saint
[4:02] peter in second peter 1 verse 5.
[4:05] furthermore justification is the moment
[4:08] when a person is saved from the wrath of
[4:10] god
[4:10] and has the promise of eternal life
[4:14] but the person is not yet filled with
[4:15] the holy ghost as we will show through
[4:17] the examples of peter
[4:19] cornelius and the ephesian christians
[4:21] later in this video
[4:23] we have three videos on true repentance
[4:25] that we pray will be a help to you
[4:27] the viewer as you seek to allow god to
[4:29] have full preeminence in your life
[4:31] beginning with justification the second
[4:34] work is sanctification
[4:36] which means purification of heart and
[4:38] life this work is the removal of all
[4:40] contaminants
[4:41] or worldly sins and habits from the
[4:44] believer's daily life
[4:45] by the work of the holy ghost through
[4:47] the teaching of the word of god
[4:50] sanctify them through thy truth thy word
[4:52] is truth
[4:54] but we are bound to give thanks always
[4:56] to god for you
[4:57] brethren beloved of the lord because god
[4:59] hath from the beginning
[5:00] chosen you to salvation through
[5:02] sanctification of the spirit
[5:04] and belief of the truth elect according
[5:07] to the foreknowledge of god the father
[5:09] through sanctification of the spirit
[5:11] unto obedience and sprinkling of the
[5:13] blood of jesus christ
[5:14] grace unto you and peace be multiplied
[5:18] in sanctification the holy spirit will
[5:20] continually cleanse the heart
[5:22] the daily life and actions of a
[5:24] christian
[5:25] notice that in saint peter's teaching
[5:26] about how godliness is restored to man
[5:29] sanctification begins after faith or
[5:32] justification
[5:33] and is a process that includes the
[5:35] addition of the six following spiritual
[5:37] attributes
[5:38] virtue knowledge temperance patience
[5:42] godliness and brotherly kindness
[5:45] once these six attributes are added to
[5:47] your life by sanctification of the
[5:49] spirit
[5:50] and also after faith is received as your
[5:52] foundation
[5:53] then your temple or tabernacle is ready
[5:56] to be capped off with the holy ghost
[5:59] the holy ghost will baptize believers
[6:01] after the second work of grace has been
[6:03] completed
[6:04] as acts 5 32 teaches but sanctification
[6:08] is the cleansing process
[6:10] god uses to teach his children to
[6:12] crucify the lusts of the flesh
[6:14] and to obey the commands of the bible
[6:17] the third and final work is the baptism
[6:19] of the holy ghost
[6:21] in this third and final step god himself
[6:24] in the form of his holy spirit
[6:26] comes to anoint abide and dwell in the
[6:29] soul of the christian
[6:31] we see the abiding of the holy ghost
[6:33] from the life of jesus
[6:34] as the bible records that the holy ghost
[6:37] in the form of a dove
[6:38] fell on jesus and this spirit abode and
[6:41] remained on him according to saint john
[6:44] 1 verses 32 and 33
[6:47] then in acts chapter 10 verse 38 peter
[6:50] said that jesus was anointed
[6:51] or provided with the holy ghost and
[6:54] power
[6:55] the baptism of the holy ghost is the
[6:57] born-again experience jesus taught
[6:59] that each person must receive in saint
[7:02] john chapter 3
[7:03] verses 3 through 8 jesus answered and
[7:06] said unto him verily verily i say unto
[7:08] thee
[7:08] except the man be born again he cannot
[7:10] see the kingdom of god
[7:12] as mentioned earlier the baptism of the
[7:14] holy ghost is christ in you
[7:16] according to colossians 1 verse 27
[7:20] the spirit of christ is now inside the
[7:22] christian in such a way that the bible
[7:24] says
[7:25] he is sealed unto the day of his
[7:26] redemption
[7:28] according to ephesians 1 verse 13 and
[7:31] ephesians 4 verse 30
[7:37] thus the holy ghost baptism is a seal or
[7:40] authentication that the believer is a
[7:42] genuine christian this seal of the holy
[7:44] ghost baptism
[7:46] never leaves during the earthly life of
[7:47] the christian this constant abiding
[7:50] presence of the holy ghost
[7:51] also keeps the believer faithful to god
[7:54] through his entire lifetime
[7:56] the spirit's abiding keeps the believer
[7:58] fighting the good fight of faith
[7:59] never giving up and going back into a
[8:01] life of sin with a desire
[8:03] to perfect holiness in the fear of god
[8:06] according to second corinthians chapter
[8:08] 7
[8:08] verse 1.
[8:22] we believe there is a great danger in
[8:24] not teaching the three works of grace
[8:26] the main danger is that preachers will
[8:28] tell new converts
[8:30] that they are born again when in all
[8:32] reality they are only justified
[8:34] or recently saved as preachers
[8:37] we do not want to mislead those who are
[8:39] seeking god
[8:41] if the three works of grace are not
[8:42] taught properly then those seeking god
[8:45] can be greatly mistaken
[8:46] about where they stand in god no doubt
[8:50] many potential converts have been told
[8:52] by preachers
[8:53] that they are saved and going to heaven
[8:55] and then those same potential converts
[8:57] eventually leave the church and deny
[8:59] christ by their words and actions
[9:02] bringing forth no fruit of genuine
[9:03] repentance as john the baptist spoke of
[9:06] in matthew chapter 3 verse 8.
[9:10] this is obvious because many new
[9:11] converts don't immediately give up
[9:13] sinful habits
[9:14] such as cussing smoking drinking arguing
[9:18] stealing sexual sins and the like
[9:21] so their lives prove that they are not
[9:23] yet sanctified
[9:25] because the contamination of the world
[9:26] remains a part of their lives
[9:28] and so because of this false teaching
[9:31] the new converts believe they are saved
[9:33] and born again and are not taught to
[9:36] continue on
[9:36] seeking god for a sanctified life or an
[9:40] even higher life than that
[9:41] such as having the power and the
[9:43] anointing of the baptism of the holy
[9:45] ghost
[9:47] then many new converts often fall out of
[9:49] church and go back into sin and iniquity
[9:52] their lives never reach a sanctified
[9:54] condition and so it is doubtful
[9:56] that their conversion was in fact a
[9:58] genuine conversion experience
[10:01] the bible fully supports this in
[10:03] numerous places
[10:04] the first is matthew 7 verses 21-23
[10:10] not everyone that saith unto me lord
[10:11] lord shall enter in the kingdom of
[10:12] heaven
[10:13] but he that doeth the will of my father
[10:15] which is in heaven
[10:17] many will say to me in that day lord
[10:19] lord have we not prophesied thy name
[10:21] and in thy name cast out devils and in
[10:24] thy name done many wonderful works
[10:26] and then will i profess unto them i
[10:27] never knew you depart from me
[10:29] ye that work iniquity this is the reason
[10:33] we emphasize sanctification
[10:35] as the second work of grace because the
[10:37] work of the spirit
[10:38] cleans the heart and life of the
[10:39] believer so that they no longer do
[10:41] wicked things
[10:43] notice also that jesus said many not a
[10:46] few
[10:46] many on the day of judgment will remind
[10:49] him of the works and supernatural gifts
[10:51] they exercised in the name of jesus but
[10:54] jesus will tell them that he never knew
[10:56] them
[10:56] because of their wicked sins and lawless
[10:59] lives
[11:00] we learn from jesus the operation and
[11:02] anointing for gifts of the holy spirit
[11:04] do not prove someone is saved a person's
[11:07] own holy life
[11:08] proves they are saved because they are
[11:10] doing the will of god
[11:11] which is the word of god
[11:15] the second example is 2 thessalonians
[11:18] chapter 2 verses 10 through 12
[11:20] and with all deceivableness of
[11:22] unrighteousness in them that perish
[11:25] because they receive not the love of the
[11:26] truth that they might be saved
[11:28] and for this cause god shall send them
[11:30] strong delusion
[11:31] that they should believe a lie that they
[11:34] all might be damned who believe not the
[11:36] truth
[11:36] but had pleasure in unrighteousness
[11:40] here saint paul teaches that the
[11:42] antichrist will deceive through
[11:43] unrighteousness
[11:44] or violating the law or word of god
[11:49] the teaching the antichrist will allow
[11:51] deceive people to live
[11:52] in the pleasures of sin those with the
[11:55] antichrist
[11:56] will not love the truth of the bible and
[11:58] so they cannot be saved
[12:00] god will let them believe the lies that
[12:02] they love and they will be damned
[12:04] because they did not want to believe the
[12:06] truth
