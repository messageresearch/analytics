[0:05] foreign
[0:23] about to turn around this way
[0:29] I bless you Saints if you're live
[0:31] streaming here we'll try this
[0:34] looks like it's working so we'll see
[0:36] okay First Corinthians 3 10 thank you
[0:39] for your patience
[0:42] Jesus told Peter if you love me feed my
[0:45] sheep so that's what we're trying to do
[0:46] today we're trying to feed God Sheep
[0:47] amen so First Corinthians 3 10.
[0:51] you're probably already there and I'll
[0:52] be there in just a second here
[0:54] I'd like to speak this morning on laying
[0:57] foundational Bible truth this morning
[1:00] I'd like to cover a number of important
[1:02] foundational subjects for the body of
[1:05] Jesus Christ I hope it'll be a blessing
[1:07] by God's grace I'll be teaching this
[1:10] morning teaching right from the word of
[1:12] God so just hold your Bible there as we
[1:14] preach uh probably have you turn a lot
[1:16] of pages and we'll cover a lot of ground
[1:18] today by the grace of God Amen
[1:21] the Bible says man does not live by
[1:23] bread alone but by every word that
[1:25] proceeds out of the mouth of God
[1:27] hallelujah
[1:28] chapter 3 verse 10.
[1:31] here we get a beautiful picture of how
[1:33] God used Apostle Paul to lay the
[1:36] foundation for the church or the body of
[1:40] Jesus Christ through the Epistles
[1:42] that Jesus had him right to the churches
[1:45] so chapter 3 verse 10 and 11 according
[1:49] to the grace of God which is given unto
[1:51] me as a wise master builder I have laid
[1:54] the foundation and another man built it
[1:56] thereon but let every man take heed how
[1:59] he buildeth thereon
[2:02] let's all read verse 11. I'd like to
[2:04] hear your voices too let's read verse 11
[2:05] on three one two three four other
[2:08] Foundation can no man lay then that is
[2:12] laid which is Jesus Christ amen so who's
[2:15] our foundation Jesus Christ and who is
[2:18] Jesus Christ he's the word he is a he is
[2:21] a literal person with a glorified body
[2:23] in heaven but his word is a form of his
[2:27] character that we have here in the Bible
[2:30] praise God so we have a written
[2:32] testimony of the character of Jesus
[2:35] Christ
[2:36] when Jesus comes back at Armageddon the
[2:38] Bible said his name is called the word
[2:40] of God hallelujah so let's have a word
[2:42] of prayer ask the Lord to minister
[2:44] before we're seated
[2:45] Heavenly Father we love you today Lord
[2:47] your yoke is easy and your burden is
[2:49] light Lord God we're so thankful for the
[2:51] grace of God we're thankful for the holy
[2:53] ghost that we feel this morning Lord God
[2:55] thank you Lord that our name is on the
[2:58] roll up in heaven Hallelujah and when
[3:00] the role is Called Up Yonder I'll be
[3:02] there Hallelujah We Believe Lord our
[3:04] names are written on the Lamb's Book of
[3:06] Life written with the blood of Jesus
[3:09] Christ before the foundation of the
[3:11] world as the scripture tells us Lord God
[3:13] thank you for these great exceeding
[3:15] precious promises the scripture declares
[3:18] Lord I'm so glad I can say I'm one of
[3:20] them Lord God I'm one of those Saints
[3:22] who love the Lord Jesus Christ the Holy
[3:24] Ghost filled Saint thank you God for
[3:26] your grace and mercy today bless his
[3:27] congregation Lord each and every person
[3:29] who pressed their way out to the house
[3:30] of God today for you Minister here Lord
[3:33] in this uh in this building Lord God
[3:35] also you pray you Minister there in
[3:37] Akron Lord through this live stream we
[3:39] pray God sweet thank you for your love
[3:41] and your compassion and Lord let the
[3:43] Holy Spirit speak today Lord as we look
[3:45] at laying foundational Bible truth here
[3:47] for this local assembly here Lord May
[3:50] the name of Jesus Christ be magnified
[3:52] and glorified May the Holy Ghost teach
[3:54] us the word of God this morning and
[3:57] we'll give you all the praise in Jesus
[3:59] Christ's name and Saint said amen amen
[4:02] God bless yours you're being seated
[4:03] praise God well it's good to be back
[4:04] with you and last time I was with you we
[4:06] were baptizing uh who said 17 of you I
[4:09] believe by God's grace so we're very
[4:11] thankful for that and what a what a
[4:13] glorious day that was praise God so
[4:16] I hope trust you're all walking on
[4:18] serving the Lord with all your heart
[4:19] praise God
[4:21] and I heard last week was a wonderful
[4:22] blessing for brother Irvin Levi so we're
[4:25] very thankful for that and I trust today
[4:27] will be a great blessing to you as well
[4:29] so you had we had brother Arlie was that
[4:32] last weekend you were with or the
[4:33] previous weekend Brother Ali was with us
[4:34] he got to stay at my house on the
[4:36] Saturday night and
[4:37] uh brother then leave Levi was there
[4:39] with us on the Sunday morning I think I
[4:41] preached on Praise Jesus name in the
[4:43] dance and we are dancing all over the
[4:45] church praise God because
[4:46] because I enjoy that Liberty the Holy
[4:49] Spirit
[4:50] but it was great to have Arley and Levi
[4:53] and the family there we so appreciate
[4:54] them by the grace of God
[4:56] so we love the Saints here and we'll
[4:59] just trust the Lord we'll do some
[5:00] teaching this morning you know
[5:04] when Jesus Christ was on Earth he did
[5:07] both preaching and teaching
[5:10] preaching it the word preach means to
[5:12] declare and so when a man preaches the
[5:15] gospel he declares the promises of God
[5:18] now when he teaches the gospel he gives
[5:21] instructions
[5:22] on how to live a Godly life
[5:24] and so the Bible said in Matthew chapter
[5:26] 9 verse 35 that Jesus went about all the
[5:29] cities and Villages teaching in their
[5:31] synagogues and preaching the gospel of
[5:34] the Kingdom Hallelujah healing every
[5:36] sickness and every disease among the
[5:38] people
[5:39] so Jesus had both a preaching Ministry
[5:41] and a Teaching Ministry so I would I
[5:45] would maybe summarize it or try to
[5:46] simplify it like this preaching is
[5:48] declaring the promises of God what God
[5:51] has done what he is doing what he will
[5:54] do praise God declaring God's promises
[5:56] such as God's A Healer praise God and
[5:58] God is a savior Hallelujah God will save
[6:01] your soul and God will God is going to
[6:03] Rapture his church for one day praise
[6:05] God all the all the great declarations
[6:07] that are true that we need to hear
[6:10] praise God and then teaching comes and
[6:13] it gives you instructions such as how to
[6:15] pray
[6:16] how to fast praise God how to uh how to
[6:20] become a Godly person by God's grace how
[6:23] to grow in the grace of God it gives you
[6:26] instructions for uh all the the needs as
[6:30] a Christian to learn how to be a better
[6:33] Christian Hallelujah and so when when we
[6:36] when we look to the word of God we look
[6:38] for preaching you know the brother
[6:39] random calls it Evangelical Services
[6:42] when you're just preaching and trying to
[6:43] raise the faith of the people to to
[6:46] receive Promises of God and then he says
[6:48] there's another kind of anointing that
[6:50] teaches the people that imparts
[6:52] instruction and shows them how to live a
[6:55] Godly life Hallelujah and so this
[6:58] morning I feel led to uh to to do some
[7:01] teaching this morning but you never know
[7:02] sometimes if if the people are pulling
[7:04] I'll lay some preaching in there as well
[7:06] by God's grace because you never know
[7:08] how the people the people ultimately you
[7:10] have control over the service
[7:12] if you're polling on the word of God if
[7:14] you're really meditating in your heart
[7:16] uh if you're drawing nigh to God God
[7:19] will draw an eye to you praise God and
[7:22] word we see that in the scripture you
[7:23] know God can take a he can take someone
[7:25] a different direction praise God
[7:28] uh you see that in the book of Acts
[7:30] praise God you know Philip was uh in a
[7:32] Revival service right he was he was
[7:33] there in Samaria uh and he was casting
[7:36] out Devils doing all these things and
[7:38] then God but God knew there was a there
[7:40] was a eunuch who needed to hear the
[7:42] gospel praise God and so God changed
[7:44] because of the pull of that man that
[7:46] desire of the man to know God God pulled
[7:48] him out of that Revival and sent him out
[7:50] to preach to one person praise God so
[7:52] God knows what he's doing amen and God
[7:54] is here to meet your need today God is
[7:56] here to speak to your heart how many
[7:58] love the Lord today
[7:59] amen praise God now let's go to Luke 6
[8:02] 48 I'd like to start there Luke 6 48.
[8:05] I'll probably have some of the Saints do
[8:07] some reading if you've got your Bibles
[8:09] here
[8:10] I want to look at numerous foundational
[8:12] Bible truths so laying foundational
[8:15] Bible truths
[8:17] 6 48 brother Irvin whenever you get that
[8:19] you can read that while he's getting
[8:21] there Paul laid the foundation for every
[8:23] New Testament Church now of course we
[8:25] know Jesus said few there be that find
[8:27] him very few churches very few people
[8:29] will find the way that leads to life
[8:31] praise God but we are we are the few
[8:34] that have found the way to to eternal
[8:37] life praise God we found it by the grace
[8:39] of God hallelujah
[8:42] if you have found it uh Paul laid the
[8:45] gospel and now God has sent in this time
[8:47] these last 100 years God has sent
[8:49] brother Branham to point us back to the
[8:51] Bible and now we read the Bible and the
[8:54] Holy Spirit uh takes these words makes
[8:56] them come alive praise God we receive
[8:59] the word of God and the word of God
[9:01] gives us life Hallelujah so Paul laid
[9:03] the foundation but Jesus teaches here in
[9:05] this verse brother Irvin's going to read
[9:08] that Christ when you come to Christ he
[9:10] starts laying a foundation in your life
[9:13] what would happen if a building doesn't
[9:15] have a foundation who knows what would
[9:16] happen
[9:18] it's going to collapse Hallelujah so
[9:20] each person in their spiritual life has
[9:23] to have the right foundation and thank
[9:25] God you know who the Cornerstone is this
[9:27] morning amen Jesus Christ is the
[9:29] Cornerstone Hallelujah he's the accepted
[9:32] we've accepted him as our Cornerstone so
[9:34] brother Irvin would you read that there
[9:35] uh it's Luke 6 48.
[9:38] he is like a man which build a house and
[9:40] dig deep and Lake the foundation on a
[9:43] rock and when the blood arose and the
[9:45] stream beat family on that house
[9:48] and could not shake it or it was founded
[9:52] on the Iraq Hallelujah hey man
[9:55] Hallelujah so in each life Jesus Christ
[9:59] wants to reveal himself to each person
[10:00] and Jesus Christ is the rock hallelujah
[10:04] the Bible said that rock in the
[10:06] wilderness was Christ in First
[10:08] Corinthians chapter 10 Hallelujah but
[10:10] each person's got to dig down you got to
[10:12] get down you got to dig deep down in
[10:14] your life deep down in your heart get
[10:16] down to the very foundation and the
[10:18] foundation must be a rock the very
[10:20] Foundation of your life must be Jesus
[10:22] Christ what matters most must be Christ
[10:25] the word of God hallelujah amen and then
[10:28] the Bible also gives us another insight
[10:30] into that in Matthew 16 Jesus said uh
[10:34] Peter you know Peter who am I and Peter
[10:36] said Thou Art the Christ and Jesus said
[10:38] that's right he said and Upon This Rock
[10:40] he said flesh and blood is not reviewed
[10:43] unto you but my Father which is in
[10:45] heaven he has revealed it unto you
[10:46] praise God he said and Upon This Rock I
[10:49] will build my church and the Gates of
[10:52] Hell shall not Prevail against it amen
[10:54] amen what a promise if we can receive
[10:56] the revelation of Jesus Christ no matter
[10:58] what Storms Come Hallelujah no matter
[11:01] what winds come in our lives they're not
[11:03] going to be able to knock us over they
[11:05] will not be able to collapse Our Lives
[11:06] as our brother said amen Our Lives will
[11:09] stand because they're founded on the
[11:10] revelation of who Jesus Christ is he is
[11:13] the word of God Amen
[11:15] Hallelujah praise the Lord
[11:18] such beautiful promises amen
[11:20] now I want you to see it in Hebrews 6 1
[11:22] Hebrews chapter 6 verse 1.
[11:32] I want you to see here that we want to
[11:34] be churches that can lay the foundation
[11:36] and then keep building most churches
[11:40] uh if they get a foundation they don't
[11:42] go all the way on they don't keep
[11:44] building
[11:45] imagine if they were to laid this
[11:47] foundation and maybe just put up one
[11:49] wall what kind of what kind of building
[11:50] would this be it'd be useless right
[11:52] that's what a lot happens a lot to a lot
[11:55] of spiritual churches right spiritually
[11:56] speaking they might know Christ and they
[11:59] might know about the cross and the
[12:01] resurrection thank God for that we just
[12:02] passed you know the resurrection weekend
[12:04] praise God
[12:05] but they've got to keep building once
[12:08] the foundation is laid Hallelujah then
[12:10] they've got to keep building and the
[12:12] Bible tells us you know many of you just
[12:14] went through the foundation you repented
[12:16] of your sins and you're baptized in the
[12:18] name of Jesus Christ amen that's the
[12:20] foundation hallelujah thank God Amen
[12:23] remember in Acts chapter 2 they said men
[12:25] and brother what shall we do
[12:27] he said repent and be baptized every one
[12:29] of you in the name of Jesus Christ and
[12:31] you shall receive the Holy Ghost and you
[12:33] shall receive the remission of sins amen
[12:35] oh that's the foundation church that's
[12:38] where you start you your foundation
[12:39] starts on being baptized being
[12:41] identified with Jesus Christ you're a
[12:43] part of the body of Jesus Christ but now
[12:46] the Bible said let us go on let us keep
[12:48] building thank God for the rock finder
[12:50] I'm sorry thank God for the right
[12:52] foundation but we must not stop we got
[12:54] to make sure the building is finished
[12:56] hallelujah amen hallelujah Hebrews 6 1.
[13:01] therefore leaving the principles of the
[13:03] doctrine of Christ let us go on to
[13:04] Perfection not laying the foundation
[13:07] of repentance from dead works
[13:10] and of faith I'm sorry not Lang again
[13:13] of dead works and a faith toward God
[13:16] imagine like I said if we were to if we
[13:18] would have laid the foundation here and
[13:19] put up one wall and then somebody you
[13:22] know just let time go on the wall would
[13:24] have knocked over the wind would have
[13:25] blew it over
[13:26] or the the foundation were to crack and
[13:29] Paul says you don't want that to happen
[13:31] you don't want to lay the foundation
[13:32] again
[13:33] you don't want to forget the uh the
[13:35] initial Promises of God you want to keep
[13:38] building on that praise God Amen you
[13:40] want to keep building and keep growing
[13:42] in your faith praise God you want to
[13:44] know Christ more Hallelujah
[13:46] you would like as the Bible said you
[13:48] want to grow in Grace and knowledge of
[13:51] the Lord Jesus Christ amen each day is
[13:53] another opportunity to taste and see
[13:55] that the Lord is good Hallelujah like
[13:57] our brother Howard's got there in his
[13:59] house I like that oh taste and see that
[14:01] the Lord is good hallelujah how many
[14:03] babies sweeter than the honey and the
[14:04] honeycomb praise God
[14:06] oh Hallelujah each and every day it gets
[14:09] sweeter and sweeter as the days go by I
[14:11] just started crying driving down here by
[14:13] two and a half hour drive I was just
[14:14] crying think about how good Jesus has
[14:16] been to me praise God
[14:18] I just it's just like the Holy Spirit
[14:19] come right there in the car and I just
[14:21] start crying and think thank you Jesus
[14:22] you have saved arrested like me you're
[14:24] alive today you're risen he's alive
[14:27] hallelujah amen and he ever lives to
[14:30] make intercession for us hallelujah amen
[14:32] amen
[14:34] thank God
[14:37] now here we see the here are some of the
[14:39] foundational truths the what is the
[14:41] first one repentance from dead works
[14:42] well what is that that's baptism
[14:44] repent and be baptized
[14:48] that's the first one praise God
[14:50] that's the foundation
[14:52] and a faith toward God having faith
[14:55] toward God not unbelief toward God
[14:57] having faith in God almighty
[14:59] of the doctrine of baptisms there's the
[15:01] water baptism which you all obeyed by
[15:04] God's grace but now you must go on to
[15:06] the spirit baptism
[15:09] which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[15:11] where the Holy Ghost Falls in your soul
[15:13] just like it did in Acts chapter two
[15:16] praise God just like it did amen that
[15:19] was when the church had a birthday that
[15:21] was the birthday of the church amen
[15:23] Jesus said go up there and wait until
[15:25] you're endued with power from on high
[15:28] then and when the Holy Ghost found the
[15:30] Bible said they went out of the upper
[15:31] room and they were praising God they
[15:33] were glorifying God so much so that they
[15:35] said these people are filled with new
[15:37] wine
[15:38] and Peter said this is not new why this
[15:40] is what Joel prophesied amen he said
[15:43] I'll pour out my spirit in the last days
[15:45] amen and your sons and daughters will
[15:47] dream dreams and and see Visions praise
[15:50] God and this is the refreshing that
[15:52] comes from the presence of the Lord amen
[15:54] oh if you are
[15:56] the Holy Ghost fall on you
[16:02] to God and God's spirit will fall on you
[16:04] praise God and you'll be refreshed
[16:06] you'll have revived hope praise God you
[16:08] have a transformed mind you have a goal
[16:10] for the future you'll have hope for the
[16:12] future because Jesus Christ is anointing
[16:14] you he's filling your mind and thoughts
[16:16] hallelujah
[16:18] amen thank God Amen Hallelujah
[16:22] there's two kinds of baptisms there's
[16:24] the water baptism in the name of the
[16:26] Lord Jesus Christ and there's the soul
[16:28] baptism where God's spirit comes to live
[16:31] in your soul
[16:34] verse two and of laying on of hands
[16:35] that's of course for uh pray for prayer
[16:38] for the sick and also for ordaining
[16:41] elders
[16:42] and of the resurrection of the Dead and
[16:45] of Eternal judgment and this we will do
[16:47] if God permits now see he says don't lay
[16:51] again the foundation in other words
[16:52] you've got to build the right foundation
[16:55] and then you've got to keep building or
[16:58] else the building is going to fall apart
[17:00] and then you got to come back and Lay It
[17:01] Again
[17:02] I don't know about you Brothers but I
[17:04] don't like wasting my time I like to do
[17:05] a job and I like to get it done
[17:07] amen the brother said
[17:09] I don't want I don't want to do
[17:11] something and it falls all apart again
[17:12] and if I can't do it I'm on the phone
[17:14] can somebody here do it for me praise
[17:17] God because I don't want to do it and
[17:18] mess it up I want somebody that would do
[17:20] it right praise God Amen and that's what
[17:22] Paul says I've laid the foundation he
[17:25] said but now each person you know has to
[17:27] receive Christ and and then Christ that
[17:30] that allow Christ to build the
[17:32] foundation build their character up
[17:35] into a real Christian character
[17:37] Hallelujah well thank you sir I
[17:39] appreciate that thank you for the heart
[17:40] very kind to you very hospitable my
[17:42] brother
[17:43] amen
[17:45] now
[17:47] uh we're not going to read these but
[17:49] brother Branham gives us this phrase he
[17:51] says we must have the Keystone of the
[17:54] Bible and the Keystone is the
[17:56] Cornerstone
[17:57] the Cornerstone of the Bible brother
[17:59] Adam said is Hebrews 13 8 and We Know It
[18:01] it's Jesus Christ is the same what
[18:03] yesterday today and forever that's the
[18:07] Keystone of the Bible
[18:09] and brother Ram gives us also Malachi
[18:11] chapter 3 verse 6 for I am the Lord thy
[18:13] God and I change not amen Amen brother
[18:16] Adam said God's word and his ways never
[18:19] change hallelujah amen so whatever God
[18:22] did with Paul's Ministry whatever God
[18:24] did with Peter's Ministry whatever God
[18:26] did with brother random's Ministry it's
[18:28] still the same today praise God
[18:30] amen hallelujah the gospel is still the
[18:33] same today because the Keystone is that
[18:35] God doesn't change his ways don't change
[18:38] that means church we have a great
[18:39] Foundation we are founded not on sinking
[18:42] sin our church and our lives are not
[18:44] going to fall away and we're not going
[18:46] to be moved by the storms of life but we
[18:48] are going to be able to handle the
[18:50] storms of life and we'll keep standing
[18:52] until Jesus comes amen
[18:54] although the culture collapses amen the
[18:57] culture is collapsing governments
[18:59] collapse churches collapse but not the
[19:01] body of Christ the body of Christ will
[19:03] be Overcomers and her testimony will
[19:06] stand Hallelujah
[19:08] the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against
[19:11] it amen
[19:13] amen Glory Hallelujah oh what a blessing

[19:18] for 23 years and the Gates of Hell have
[19:20] not prevailed hallelujah
[19:22] amen thank God Amen oh I know it's true
[19:26] praise God
[19:27] now Galatians 1 verse 6 if you got your
[19:29] Bibles there Galatians 1 verse 6.
[19:32] well we have dear sister Ruth could you
[19:34] read that uh sister Ruth whenever you
[19:36] get there no no rush no pressure
[19:38] Galatians 1 verse 6.
[19:43] and sister if you would uh could you
[19:45] read six seven eight and nine sister
[19:46] Ruth that'd be okay all right go in
[19:48] whenever you're ready
[19:56] March is not another but there be some
[19:59] that trouble you and would pervert the
[20:01] gospel of Christ but though we are an
[20:05] angel from heaven preached any other
[20:07] gospel unto you then that which we
[20:10] appreciate to you let him be accursed
[20:13] and as we said before so say I now again
[20:16] if any man preach any other gospel unto
[20:19] you then that ye have received let him
[20:22] be accursed amen sister thank you praise
[20:25] God the next verse Paul says who am I
[20:28] trying to please God or man
[20:30] who do you want to please we want to
[20:32] please the Lord Jesus Christ amen thank
[20:34] you sister
[20:35] Paul said I don't care if an angel or
[20:38] somebody else or you myself if whoever
[20:40] comes to change the gospel that Jesus
[20:42] gave me they are cursed
[20:45] the Gospel of Jesus Christ cannot be
[20:48] changed we cannot add to it we cannot
[20:51] take away from it why because it's the
[20:52] foundation amen amen oh hallelujah
[20:55] praise God it's a curse to change it
[20:59] and so we never would and God is going
[21:01] to use these this New Testament of
[21:03] course the whole Bible but especially
[21:05] the New Testament God is going to use
[21:07] that as the Judgment standard
[21:10] right so let's go through that Romans 2
[21:13] 16. but Levi you want to read that
[21:14] Romans 2 16.
[21:17] nope
[21:25] the keynote of the entire Bible is God
[21:28] is unchanging we cannot change the
[21:30] gospel he gave to Paul because it is the
[21:33] Judgment standard and let's Levi
[21:35] whenever you're ready brother
[21:37] God shall judge the secrets of men by
[21:41] Jesus Christ according to my gospel
[21:44] thank you and the church says amen
[21:48] every man think about that every man we
[21:50] know every preacher we know will be
[21:53] judged by this gospel
[21:55] well whose interpretation of it
[21:57] it's not a denomination's interpretation
[21:59] of it it's the Holy Ghost interpretation
[22:02] of it
[22:03] amen hallelujah how do we know that
[22:05] through a prophet praise God through the
[22:08] preachers the true preachers of the
[22:10] Gospel praise God because the Bible said
[22:12] how beautiful are the feet of them who
[22:15] bring the Gospel of Truth Hallelujah of
[22:17] good news amen hallelujah
[22:20] in other words God before the people can
[22:22] receive the Gospel God has to anoint a
[22:25] man to go and then preach the gospel
[22:27] praise God so it all goes back to God
[22:30] God has a message he anoints a man he
[22:32] gives the man the message and then the
[22:34] man goes to preach the message and then
[22:36] God's got people there that receive it
[22:38] praise God those smaller number they're
[22:40] not they're not small in number really
[22:42] because the angel of God are with God's
[22:45] people praise God
[22:46] oh amen hallelujah thank God Amen Church
[22:50] there's angels all around this room here
[22:52] as we speak
[22:55] there's Guardian Angels the Bible said
[22:57] their Angels always do behold the face
[23:00] of My Father which is in heaven and the
[23:03] Bible says the angel of the Lord and
[23:05] camps around all those that fear the
[23:07] Lord amen
[23:08] oh my God
[23:10] if I get a little sleep in the car guess
[23:12] what the angel wakes me up praise God so
[23:14] I don't get a car accident
[23:16] Hallelujah
[23:18] or if the other person's swerving
[23:19] towards me and I'm like oh God have
[23:21] mercy the angel allows that person to
[23:23] correct themselves so I don't get the
[23:24] car accident
[23:25] I've got angels watching over me praise
[23:28] God
[23:28] they're protecting us praise God they
[23:31] keep us lest we fall and dash our foot
[23:34] against the stone God's promise is true
[23:36] God has guarded angels watching over us
[23:39] thank God for his grace that's how much
[23:41] he loves you praise God Amen hey man
[23:45] Hallelujah
[23:47] we're not going to read all these but
[23:48] I'm just going to like a machine gun
[23:49] fire him out there praise God revelation
[23:51] 22 18-19 you don't have to turn there
[23:54] but the Bible says any man that adds to
[23:56] God's word plagues will be added to him
[23:59] any man that takes away from God's word
[24:01] his name will be taken out of the Book
[24:03] of Life
[24:04] right
[24:06] proverbs 30 verses 5 and 6 the Bible
[24:08] said add thou now unto God's words
[24:11] lest that lest he reprove thee and thou
[24:14] be found a liar
[24:16] God's gonna call a lot of people Liars
[24:18] on the day of judgment because they
[24:20] added to the Bible
[24:23] that's what the Bible says you must not
[24:25] add to it actually adding to the Bible
[24:28] is called legalism that's what that is
[24:30] legalism is adding a requirement that
[24:33] you don't find in the Bible
[24:35] right
[24:36] the other that's one extreme The Other
[24:39] Extreme is lasciviousness which is
[24:41] lawlessness which means there's no
[24:43] Commandments you can do whatever you
[24:44] want you're going to be saved and then
[24:45] the other side is legalism you got to do
[24:47] this and this and this to be safe
[24:48] there's one thing you must do to be
[24:50] saved you must repent and be baptized
[24:52] amen You Must Believe praise God amen
[24:54] amen Jesus does all the saving you got
[24:57] to repent of your sins and be saved
[24:59] praise God and we have to find now we
[25:01] have to find as we'll see here now we
[25:03] have to find the middle of the road
[25:06] because we cannot be legalists but we
[25:08] cannot be lasciviousness either
[25:11] we can't be Lawless but we can't have
[25:13] man's law we got to have God's law
[25:15] praise God
[25:17] amen hallelujah
[25:19] and then Jude 1 verse 3 says You must
[25:22] earnestly contend for the faith that was
[25:25] once delivered to the Saints praise God
[25:27] Amen
[25:28] that's why uh that's why why I sound
[25:30] like I'm so serious or so uh maybe loud
[25:33] or something like that I'm fighting
[25:35] right we're we're contending
[25:39] if I was gonna you know if I was gonna
[25:41] fight anybody I wouldn't want to be like
[25:43] all sad and scared I'd have to I have to
[25:46] call it my courage I have to bring up my
[25:48] courage
[25:49] if he's bigger than me I gotta be real
[25:51] courageous
[25:54] yeah you can't be a coward and with the
[25:56] the Bible said God does not give us a
[25:59] spirit of fear but a power love and a
[26:02] sound mind Hallelujah
[26:03] amen
[26:05] you can't be afraid of the devil
[26:07] I've came back down to the devil we
[26:09] gotta speak God's word amen
[26:11] Hallelujah
[26:12] now
[26:13] some Churches battle legalism especially
[26:16] the galatian church and the colossian
[26:18] church so let's go there Galatians 3 1.
[26:22] now as I've talked with brother Irvin
[26:24] and
[26:25] John Levi you know I realize you know
[26:28] some of your background is having to
[26:29] overcome legalisms that's why I wanted
[26:31] to bring this thought out I thought it
[26:33] would be a help to you
[26:34] by God's grace I came out of the other
[26:37] extreme like uh in the Pentecostal
[26:39] church I was raised
[26:41] is basically just do whatever he wants
[26:42] as long as you come to church and speak
[26:43] in tongues you're good
[26:45] you could you could live however you
[26:47] want
[26:48] really you could live however you want
[26:50] could be married as many times you want
[26:51] as long as you come to church and speak
[26:53] in tongues you're all right you're a
[26:54] good member of the church
[26:55] but we don't find that in God's Bible
[26:57] praise God
[26:58] Hallelujah you don't find that in the
[27:00] word of God I want my life to line up
[27:03] with God's word praise God not with a
[27:05] church manual I want my life to line up
[27:07] with God's holy Bible praise God
[27:10] amen
[27:13] Galatians 3 verse 1.
[27:16] Galatians 3 yeah we're already in
[27:17] Galatians 1 now go to Galatians 3 verse
[27:19] one
[27:25] now it says o foolish Galatians who have
[27:27] Bewitched you that ye should not obey
[27:29] the truth before whose eyes Jesus Christ
[27:31] hath been evidently set forth
[27:33] crucified among you this only would I
[27:37] learn of you receive ye the Spirit by
[27:38] The Works of the law or by the hearing
[27:40] of faith
[27:42] are ye so foolish having begun the
[27:44] spirit are you now made perfect by the
[27:46] flesh have you suffered so many things
[27:48] in vain if if it be yet in vain he
[27:52] therefore that ministereth to you the
[27:54] spirit and worketh miracles among you do
[27:56] it that he by The Works of the law or by
[27:59] the hearing of faith
[28:01] now just to summarize this is about
[28:05] people in the galatian church trying to
[28:07] bring circumcision back in
[28:09] they were telling these these Believers
[28:11] if you don't get circumcised you're not
[28:13] saved
[28:14] right if you ever read this book how
[28:16] many read this book before relations
[28:17] okay yeah you read it right in there
[28:20] it was legal is trying to they already
[28:22] been set free from from having to obey
[28:24] everything in the law
[28:25] but preachers had slipped in and tried
[28:28] to pervert the gospel well no you
[28:31] actually have to go back and do this
[28:33] now Paul will say later in the book he
[28:35] says circumcision doesn't Prevail you
[28:38] anything it doesn't help you it doesn't
[28:40] hurt you
[28:42] right it's not it's not a requirement
[28:44] anymore
[28:45] but some people were starting to receive
[28:47] the legalism back in
[28:49] and so Paul came to say don't let
[28:51] legalism come in
[28:53] be led by the Holy Spirit praise God
[28:56] Hallelujah
[28:59] now only you know as a church I don't
[29:01] know I haven't talked to these brothers
[29:03] extensively only you know the legalistic
[29:05] things that you had to come out of and
[29:07] you must contend not to let them come
[29:09] back in praise God
[29:11] now if you can find the Bible we'll talk
[29:13] about it if it's in the Bible it's
[29:15] rightly divided well then yes we got to
[29:17] obey that because the Bible says if you
[29:19] love me keep my commands Jesus said if
[29:21] you love me keep my commands
[29:25] praise God
[29:27] Hallelujah
[29:30] so
[29:31] they stood they were in a battle against
[29:34] legalism coming back and they got called
[29:36] out of legalism by Christ they came out
[29:39] but then they went back in
[29:42] it's kind of like Israel when they come
[29:43] out of Egypt and they want to go back to
[29:46] Egypt
[29:48] kind of like that
[29:50] they wanted to go back in bondage but
[29:52] church we should never want to go back
[29:54] into bondage to legalism or things of
[29:57] the world let's enjoy Freedom Hallelujah
[29:59] let's grow in Freedom let's enjoy God's
[30:02] blessings hallelujah amen
[30:05] you gotta you got the right to raise
[30:07] your hands you got the right to shock
[30:09] you got the right to dance and praise
[30:11] God Amen you got the right because the
[30:13] Bible gives you that right amen amen
[30:16] you got it right sisters have the right
[30:18] to give a word of Prophecy
[30:21] Brothers have a right to give a word of
[30:22] interpretation that's in the Bible
[30:25] praise God the Bible is our absolute
[30:27] praise God
[30:29] amen hallelujah
[30:31] we're gonna get down to some of these
[30:32] things here by God's grace now go to
[30:34] chapter five amen this is glorious
[30:36] oh don't you love the Bible praise God
[30:39] it's my love letter from Jesus brother
[30:41] Irvin but if I said this is a love
[30:44] letter from Jesus Oh you love me so much
[30:46] thank you Lord hallelujah
[30:49] ah you want to feel loved just read your
[30:50] Bible
[30:52] Hallelujah read your Bible
[30:54] it's God's love letter to you
[30:57] chapter 5 verse one
[31:00] now he goes through this all this uh
[31:03] teaching on the law versus Grace in
[31:05] chapter 5 verse 1. stand past therefore
[31:08] in the Liberty wherewith Christ has made
[31:10] us free and be not entangled again with
[31:13] the yoga bondage so they came out of
[31:14] legalism and Paul's saying stand with
[31:17] Christ don't go back into legalism
[31:20] praise God Amen
[31:23] and look at verse two here's where he
[31:24] says it behold I Paul say unto you that
[31:27] if you be circumcised Christ your profit
[31:29] you nothing
[31:31] now think about that those false
[31:33] preachers were really persuasive they
[31:35] were saying well if Abraham was
[31:36] circumcised shouldn't you be circumcised
[31:38] aren't you a Seed of Abraham
[31:40] you see how persuasive they were what
[31:42] doesn't Genesis 17 say that if you're
[31:45] not circumcised you're not part of the
[31:46] Covenant see how see how deceptive and
[31:49] persuasive they are but Paul had to
[31:51] teach him you got to stand on the gospel
[31:54] you're not part of the Old Testament
[31:55] you're part of the New Covenant praise
[31:57] God you've got a better Covenant with
[31:59] better promises amen and our covenant is
[32:02] based upon the blood of the Messiah the
[32:04] blood of Jesus Christ hallelujah amen
[32:08] thank God
[32:11] now go to Colossians chapter 2 verse 12.
[32:13] brother Daniel if you can read that
[32:15] brother whenever you get it Colossians 2
[32:16] verse 12.
[32:17] here's another now Paul had to deal with
[32:19] also legalism in the church in colossi
[32:24] and I just got done preaching on this

[32:33] now Colossians now I'm going to go over
[32:35] to Romans and preach that whole book to

[32:38] because when brother Rams when brother

[32:42] time he got a preview of Heaven

[32:45] time they said my precious brother they
[32:47] said brother Brandon if you had not went

[33:18] screamed out we're resting on that
[33:21] resting on what that brother Adam
[33:23] preached the same thing Paul preached
[33:25] amen because anybody that preaches
[33:27] different is cursed but anybody that
[33:29] preaches the same is blessed hallelujah
[33:31] amen amen
[33:33] it's exactly right
[33:35] that's the word of God Amen

[34:03] uncircumcision of your flesh have you

[34:48] said God took all the handwriting
[34:50] against us and nailed it to Jesus's
[34:52] cross amen amen amen and then Jesus paid
[34:55] for all those sins and you're forgiven
[34:57] all the sins because he paid the price
[34:59] for all your list of sins amen

[37:43] having forgiven you all trespasses he
[37:46] didn't say some
[37:48] he forgave you all
[37:49] amen
[37:51] a Double L program says a Double L
[37:55] all your trespasses
[37:58] he forgives you
[38:00] and when Satan's out brings up all those
[38:02] lies brother Daniel you can take him
[38:03] right back here
[38:04] well devil I don't care what you say I
[38:06] care what the Bible says Jesus said
[38:09] you're a liar
[38:10] so I'm not going to believe you I'm
[38:12] going to believe Colossians 2.
[38:14] verse 13 praise God
[38:18] thank God amen amen how it makes you
[38:21] feel join unspeakable full of Glory
[38:23] sometimes
[38:25] my goodness thank God amen amen for
[38:28] Jesus Christ thank God for Jesus Christ
[38:31] oh I haven't got to where I was trying
[38:33] to go my goodness
[38:36] verse 16. now here's where we see
[38:39] Liberty
[38:41] Liberty and not legalism
[38:44] verse 16 let no man therefore judge you
[38:47] in what you eat your Meats
[38:50] or in your drink
[38:52] or in respect of a holy day like some
[38:54] people are on the message you know
[38:55] Easter is the most important day for
[38:57] them
[38:59] other people maybe it's good Friday some
[39:01] people uh
[39:03] it might be Christmas
[39:06] but the Bible says
[39:08] don't let anybody judge you whatever
[39:10] days are really special to you let them
[39:12] be special to you
[39:15] why
[39:17] because verse 17 which are a shadow of
[39:19] things to come but the body is Christ
[39:23] in other words we're not legalism like
[39:25] this day and that day and this day and
[39:27] those
[39:28] you got to eat this and drink this and
[39:29] we're not legalists like that because
[39:31] all those things in the Old Testament
[39:33] were Shadows of Jesus Christ
[39:36] the day of atonement was a shadow that
[39:39] that he says would go to the cross and
[39:41] pay for all of our sins Hallelujah
[39:45] thank God Hallelujah
[39:50] all right
[39:52] so see what the blood of Jesus does it
[39:54] forgives us all of our trespasses and
[39:56] then we have Liberty as Christians to
[39:58] maybe have this meat and that drink and
[40:00] then this day is a very holy day to me
[40:03] we have the liberty and he said don't
[40:04] let anybody judge you
[40:07] because all these things are shadows the
[40:10] real thing is Jesus Christ amen
[40:13] all right
[40:15] Hallelujah
[40:16] [Music]
[40:18] now
[40:20] we're not legalists
[40:23] but we do we are under a law of the Holy
[40:27] Spirit
[40:28] so go to Romans 8 verse 1.
[40:31] we're not under the law of the Old
[40:32] Testament we are under the law of the
[40:34] spirit
[40:37] yet totally forgiven
[40:40] Romans 8 1.
[40:44] right any Kingdom without a law would be
[40:46] awful wouldn't it
[40:48] think if there was no laws and somebody
[40:50] somebody murdered or somebody stole and
[40:52] there was no law to enforce it 'd be
[40:55] awful
[40:56] so we come into Christ we're forgiven
[40:59] all of our sins but now we operate under
[41:01] the law of the Holy Spirit
[41:03] it's it's no doubt church it's the law
[41:05] of Grace it's law of Grace
[41:08] but God also has to teach us his ways
[41:12] Hallelujah
[41:14] Romans 8 1 and 2.
[41:17] Romans eight one and two really like you
[41:19] read Romans eight one and two brother
[41:20] there is therefore now no condemnation
[41:24] to them which are in Christ Jesus who
[41:28] walk not after the flesh but after the
[41:31] spirit
[41:32] for the law of the spirit of life in
[41:35] Christ Jesus has made me free from the
[41:38] law of sin and death amen praise God
[41:41] hallelujah there's no condemnation to us
[41:44] if we're in Christ
[41:47] don't let the devil condemn you because
[41:49] you got the Bible the Bible says there's
[41:51] no condemnation to me
[41:53] Hallelujah I'm forgiven praise God
[41:57] I'm going to heaven praise God
[42:00] I'm going to see Jesus there
[42:02] my name's on the road in heaven I'm not
[42:05] under I'm not going to live under
[42:06] condemnation now yes I have a conviction
[42:09] I have conviction so when I've done
[42:11] wrong I'll repent of it but I don't but
[42:13] God is Not condemning me I have no wrath
[42:16] there's no wrath God has on me I'm not
[42:18] in war against God I have peace with God
[42:20] hallelujah that's Romans 5 1 we don't
[42:23] have time to read it but the Bible says
[42:24] we have therefore we now have peace with
[42:27] God through our Lord Jesus Christ
[42:29] that's what we need today peace with God
[42:31] hallelujah
[42:33] and notice that church you're under the
[42:35] law of the spirit
[42:38] in other words when you obey God God's
[42:40] going to bless you
[42:41] when you disobey God purposely he's
[42:43] going to give you a spanking like you
[42:45] give a child
[42:47] how we know that's in the Bible amen go
[42:50] to Hebrews
[42:52] Hebrews 12.
[42:54] Hebrews 12 6.
[42:57] God loves you I just told you God loves
[42:59] you there's no condemnation all your
[43:01] sins are forgiven that's true but when
[43:03] we make mistakes God's a good parent too
[43:06] he's not going to let us get away with
[43:08] things we shouldn't we shouldn't do
[43:10] just like you would elect like brother
[43:11] always use that example if your child
[43:13] was running out in the street and it's a
[43:15] busy highway brother says you want to
[43:17] stand there and say oh that's good John
[43:18] here little Sarah that just have fun out
[43:20] there there's all those uh 13 or 12
[43:23] wheelers trucks driving by 60 miles per
[43:26] hour yeah Johnny just have a little
[43:27] trouble brother said if you really love
[43:28] that child you'll go out there and get
[43:30] him off the road Johnny you come here
[43:32] Johnny
[43:36] right if you really love them another
[43:39] way run Ram explained it if a man's in a
[43:42] in a canoe and he's going toward a
[43:44] waterfall and doesn't know it if you're
[43:46] loving you'll warn him
[43:49] love is not oh I hope you have a good
[43:51] time sorry about what's going to happen
[43:52] but I hope you're having a good time
[43:57] but remember said if you have love
[43:58] you'll cry out turn around
[44:02] you're going towards a cataract
[44:05] turn away go against the law of sin and
[44:08] death and follow the law of Despair
[44:10] praise God Amen
[44:12] amen hallelujah
[44:15] so we're totally forgiven but then God's
[44:18] teaching us with his law
[44:20] to obey God to please God
[44:24] and then God will bless us just like
[44:27] you'll bless your children if they obey
[44:28] you
[44:30] right
[44:33] now Hebrews 12 6 brother Irvin would you
[44:36] read that brother
[44:45] amen you should read this whole chapter
[44:46] after church if you've got time
[44:50] if God loves you he's going to spank you
[44:53] like a child
[44:54] now I know none of us would like to
[44:56] think about getting spanked that's
[44:57] actually what the Bible says a few
[44:58] verses down no it doesn't seem joyful
[45:00] for the present to get spanked
[45:03] but that's what that Scourge means to
[45:05] spank
[45:07] if he loves you he's got to correct you
[45:09] and say you shouldn't say that you
[45:12] shouldn't have done that
[45:13] you you what you went you disobeyed the
[45:16] voice of the Holy Spirit there now you
[45:18] need to repent of that and you need to
[45:20] obey the father's voice
[45:24] so we're not we're not preaching
[45:25] lasciviousness like I was Raising oh
[45:27] it's okay divorce and remarry it's okay
[45:29] to watch filthy movies and and cuss and
[45:31] do dirty things no no
[45:33] and but we're not legalists either
[45:35] creating man-made ideas that man-made
[45:38] laws we're not dead either we're right
[45:40] down the middle of the road as the Bible
[45:42] says we're walking up the Highway of
[45:44] Holiness amen ah Isaiah chapter 28 I
[45:48] believe no Isaiah 35 says we are on the
[45:51] road or the way of Holiness we're on a
[45:54] highway we're walking up the King's
[45:56] Highway praise God oh my God
[46:01] amen so God's love is Parental love he
[46:05] loves you like a parent
[46:07] and if I love my kids I gotta get out my

[46:11] on the back of there I usually hit him
[46:12] on the back of their calf right here

[46:15] because I don't want to hurt their back

[46:36] mean I'm doing it because it's for their
[46:37] own good amen
[46:40] and God is gonna like a parent he's
[46:42] gonna correct you sometimes he has to
[46:44] give us little spankings
[46:46] right
[46:47] we learn from that and that's proof that
[46:50] he loves us amen
[46:53] the the proof that he loves me is that
[46:55] he won't let me live like a
[46:57] denominational Christian
[46:59] the proof that he loves me is that he
[47:01] won't let me live like a sinner he loves
[47:04] me too much Hallelujah he died he

[49:32] your way to life amen
[49:34] you will not come into condemnation

[50:04] confidence in their walk with God
[50:07] this is how you know you're saved you
[50:09] pass from Death unto life and you shall
[50:12] not come into condemnation
[50:14] you will not go to hell because Jesus

[50:29] now you're standing on a different
[50:31] location you're you're in a new
[50:33] territory you're living for Jesus Christ

[50:39] Hallelujah
[50:40] Hallelujah
[50:42] amen
[50:44] what a blessing Hallelujah
[50:48] like I love my brother Irvin told me
[50:49] last time he's he was almost got tears
[50:51] in his eyes he said he said to think
[50:52] that that God
[50:55] at 59 years old wouldn't let me keep
[50:57] going in all the my previous life that I
[51:00] used to live because he saw so many
[51:02] people they just keep going in the same
[51:03] direction and they never change but God
[51:05] had mercy on our precious brother amen
[51:07] amen praise God hallelujah just like he
[51:10] had mercy on me at 20 years or 19 years
[51:12] old to get saved amen amen he wouldn't
[51:15] let me walk in that path too much longer
[51:17] he he brought us he took us out of the
[51:19] old path and he let us walk on the New
[51:22] Path Hallelujah
[51:23] um oh thank God
[51:26] for the law of the Holy Spirit
[51:29] I'm going to read this one uh Ephesians
[51:32] 4 30 grieve not the holy spirit of God
[51:35] whereby you're sealed to the day of
[51:37] redemption the word greed means to
[51:39] offend church when we sin we offend God
[51:42] but it's not like he's going to send us
[51:44] to hell
[51:45] we just offend him how many operation
[51:47] how many ever been offended before you
[51:50] have to raise your hand
[51:52] but almost on a daily basis I guess
[51:56] yes well are you able to overcome that
[51:58] and forgive yes yes if not today's the
[52:01] day to do it
[52:04] that that's what the Bible says that's
[52:06] what your sin is like to God it just
[52:07] offends him
[52:09] but then when you confess your sins
[52:10] what's the Bible say in first John
[52:11] chapter one he's faithful and just to
[52:13] forgive you what
[52:15] all your iniquities all your trespasses
[52:18] and now you have fellowship with one
[52:20] another you walk in the lie as he's in
[52:22] the light amen
[52:23] and the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses
[52:25] us from all there it is again a Double L
[52:29] all unrighteousness Hallelujah
[52:32] amen he cleanses us from every sin every
[52:34] block and we look down at our spiritual
[52:36] garments and there's no blots on it it's
[52:39] completely white it's white as snow the
[52:41] blood of Jesus Christ makes us white as
[52:44] snow praise God
[52:45] oh Hallelujah
[52:50] the law of God is also seen in Galatians
[52:53] chapter 6. verse 7 be not deceived God
[52:56] is Not mocked
[52:58] for whatsoever man soweth that shall he
[53:01] reap
[53:01] for he that soweth to his flesh shall
[53:03] the flesh reap corruption but he that
[53:05] sowed to the spirit shall the spirit
[53:07] reap life Everlasting
[53:11] now can everybody see that we're saved
[53:13] by grace
[53:15] no more condemnation but not like a
[53:17] father God does have to spank us
[53:19] sometimes
[53:20] like brother Irvin read as a father
[53:23] loves his sons he's got a chasten his
[53:26] sons and daughters
[53:28] but he's not he's not eternally upset
[53:30] with you
[53:31] you're not on the naughty list
[53:33] amen
[53:35] you're on the last book of life list oh
[53:38] thank God thank God Amen
[53:41] we offend God but then God is faithful
[53:43] to forgive us
[53:45] that is the anointing comes right back
[53:47] on us praise God
[53:49] the back is the anointing that caused us
[53:51] to repent amen praise God Amen
[53:58] now I want to start getting this too as
[54:00] God has brought this church on
[54:01] illegalism
[54:03] God's brought you out to make you free
[54:06] but then God does establish order for
[54:09] the church for the churches
[54:11] now it's easily seen in First
[54:12] Corinthians 14 with the gifts of the
[54:15] Spirit so 1433 First Corinthians 14 33
[54:19] brother Ari are you going to turn there
[54:20] brother because I'd like to have you
[54:21] read that would that be okay brother
[54:23] First Corinthians 14 33.
[54:31] 14 33 Brother Ali whenever you're ready
[54:37] for God Is Not the Only
[54:39] person
[54:40] [Music]
[54:42] as in our churches of the same amen now
[54:46] brother go down and read verse 40.
[54:47] brother are they would you read verse
[54:48] 40.
[54:51] all things be done easily and in order
[54:54] amen now this is speaking of gifts of
[54:56] the holy spirit I've been in a like I
[54:58] was raised in churches where there was
[54:59] tongues interpretation every every
[55:01] service almost
[55:04] and so Paul's just laying out this is
[55:05] the order of how to do tongues
[55:07] interpretation at the most three now
[55:10] I've been in Services where there were
[55:11] seven or eight or nine or more and they
[55:13] went against the Bible see how they went
[55:14] against the Bible
[55:16] but you know I don't know God God will
[55:18] be the judge of that you know we
[55:19] shouldn't go outside the Bible of course
[55:21] but I just want you to see God does not
[55:23] author confusion
[55:25] God likes things done decently and in
[55:28] order
[55:29] so there could be an order of the Holy
[55:31] Spirit without being legalism
[55:36] now I want to get down to just a regular
[55:39] church service I want to just share how
[55:40] brother Ram taught a regular church
[55:42] service should be should be ran and he
[55:46] uses a type to to teach a type from the
[55:49] Old Testament
[55:51] now before I say this this church is
[55:54] Sovereign of itself you can run your
[55:55] services in any order you want my
[55:58] brother Brandon found this order in
[56:00] Joshua chapter 6. so if you want let's
[56:02] go to Joshua chapter 6.
[56:05] brother random saw a spiritual type here
[56:08] or foreshadowing
[56:10] uh this is God's order when the Ark of
[56:13] the Covenant the prince of God would go
[56:14] forth into battle and so brother Adam
[56:17] took the order of the Ark
[56:19] of the Covenant the Old Testament and he
[56:22] brought that spiritual order to a church
[56:24] service
[56:26] okay
[56:27] so this is just a suggestion
[56:29] and there's nothing wrong with order
[56:31] like I was telling our church on
[56:32] Wednesday night isn't it amazing every
[56:33] service we start with prayer silent
[56:35] prayer and then we sing songs and then
[56:38] we pray then we sing some more songs
[56:40] that we preach and then we close with
[56:41] prayer and songs and the Holy Ghost
[56:43] Falls almost every service amen
[56:46] God is not against order if it's done
[56:48] with holiness
[56:49] [Music]
[56:50] praise God Amen never fails to amaze me
[56:54] how God's spirit if we can just humble
[56:56] ourselves and we really we just got to
[56:58] confess our sins it really doesn't
[56:59] matter the order of the service if we
[57:01] just confess our sins God's fear is
[57:03] going to be there praise God because he
[57:05] promised brother Daniel whoever two or
[57:07] three be gathered in my name there I am
[57:09] in the midst of them praise God
[57:12] that's a Divine promise that's a thus
[57:14] say at the Bible promise so church if we
[57:16] believe if we're trusting in Jesus he is
[57:19] here today praise God
[57:21] amen
[57:25] Joshua 6 verse 6.
[57:31] bro John would you read that brother
[57:32] would you read six seven eight nine
[57:33] brother go ahead whenever you're ready
[57:36] and Joshua the son of none called the
[57:38] priests sit unto them take up the art of
[57:41] the Covenant and let seven priests bear
[57:44] seven trumpets of Ram's horns before the
[57:46] Ark of the Lord
[57:48] and he said unto the people pass on and
[57:50] Compass the city and let them let him
[57:54] that his arm pass on before the Ark of
[57:56] the Lord
[57:59] yeah give me eight nine yes sir and it
[58:01] came to pass when Joshua had spoken unto
[58:03] the people
[58:04] seven priests burying the seven trumpets
[58:06] of the Rams horns passed on before the
[58:09] Lord and Blues With The Trumpets and the
[58:13] Ark of the Covenant of the Lord followed
[58:15] them and the armed men went before the
[58:17] priest that blew with the trumpets and
[58:19] the rear reward came after the art the
[58:23] priests going on and blowing with the
[58:25] trumpets amen thank you brother John
[58:28] uh do you notice the order here
[58:32] the Bible said in verse 7 the our men
[58:34] pass on before the ark
[58:37] okay
[58:38] so you got the armed men with the swords
[58:41] then you got the trumpeters then you got
[58:43] the ark
[58:46] okay
[58:47] so brother I am taught
[58:49] the armed guards he said the armed men
[58:52] with the swords is what's the sword the
[58:54] sword of the spirit in the New Testament
[58:56] and where do we hear about that in
[58:58] Ephesians chapter six you put on the
[59:00] whole armor of God and then you got the
[59:01] sword of the spirit and then what did
[59:03] you say right after that he said praying
[59:04] for all men the Bible says
[59:07] so that's why brother said before
[59:08] service people should come into the
[59:10] service prayerfully
[59:14] so before service we should pray
[59:17] then what comes next the horns the
[59:19] trumpet the music brother Rams says
[59:21] that's music
[59:23] now this is what brother Ram said it
[59:25] wasn't thus saith the Lord like
[59:26] everybody had to do it but every church
[59:28] has its own liberty brother Adam just
[59:30] wanted to find something scriptural he
[59:32] could a a pattern he could find from the
[59:34] Bible to base his services on
[59:37] so we'd have prayer first and brother
[59:39] Adam said if you when a preacher walks
[59:41] into a congregation that's praying for
[59:43] God to speak he said they are guaranteed
[59:46] to hear from Heaven praise God
[59:49] you want to hear from Heaven pray before
[59:51] the servant ask God speak to me God
[59:54] speak to us let the Holy Ghost speak to
[59:56] us God will speak Hallelujah
[59:58] you've seen it remember when you guys
[1:00:00] anointed the chairs that's the same
[1:00:01] thing
[1:00:02] praying before service
[1:00:05] right pray
[1:00:07] pray let the armed guards go first
[1:00:10] sisters you got you got the armor of God
[1:00:11] too God hears your prayers just as much
[1:00:14] as mine
[1:00:15] Hallelujah is that right
[1:00:17] absolutely
[1:00:19] that's right so the prayer warriors go
[1:00:21] first
[1:00:22] we should all be prayer warriors
[1:00:26] gone and then bring up these musicians
[1:00:29] bring up the singers like Daniel like
[1:00:31] our brother Howard there we go I'm gonna
[1:00:33] get your guys names here I'm gonna get
[1:00:35] eventually
[1:00:37] takes repetition for me
[1:00:39] and then after the ark comes the word
[1:00:42] I'm sorry after the horns comes the word
[1:00:44] the prince of God that's what the ark
[1:00:46] was that's where God lived
[1:00:49] and God lives in his word
[1:00:51] and the church said amen so we have
[1:00:54] prayer
[1:00:55] singing preaching hallelujah amen
[1:01:00] and each one prepares for the next one
[1:01:03] prayer prepares us to sing
[1:01:07] and singing gives us courage now to hear
[1:01:09] the word and then let's go take that
[1:01:11] word praise God let's believe that word
[1:01:13] amen
[1:01:16] so that's the order that brother random
[1:01:17] gives
[1:01:18] for a service brother Irvin and brother
[1:01:20] John
[1:01:22] just so you can see now if you want the
[1:01:23] quotes I can give the quotes after
[1:01:24] service
[1:01:25] now go to Ephesians chapter 4 verse 8.
[1:01:29] like I said I'm gonna lay down some
[1:01:31] foundational truths here this this

[1:01:37] clock amen
[1:01:39] I can see you again I don't look at my
[1:01:41] watch I'm taking off my Watson
[1:01:45] I'm not gonna pay attention to that that
[1:01:46] uh the brother man calls it a busy body
[1:01:48] I'm not gonna pay attention to that busy
[1:01:50] body right there
[1:01:52] yeah
[1:01:55] I'm gonna lay down some foundations and
[1:01:56] you all pray about it
[1:01:58] and God's Gonna lead you guys by the
[1:02:00] Holy Ghost

[1:02:04] said we started churches he said I
[1:02:06] ordain Elders in every church and then I
[1:02:09] left them off and then he had to leave

[1:02:15] Hallelujah God's helped me start two

[1:03:49] captivity captured and gave gifts and
[1:03:52] demand
[1:03:53] now that he ascended what is it that he
[1:03:56] also descended first into the lower
[1:03:58] parts of the Earth
[1:04:00] he that descended is the same also that
[1:04:03] ascended up far above all Heavens that
[1:04:06] he might fill all things
[1:04:08] amen now see this after Jesus
[1:04:11] Resurrected
[1:04:13] he took all the Old Testament Saints
[1:04:15] with him the Bible said when he
[1:04:16] resurrected the many of the graves were
[1:04:18] opened
[1:04:19] and then on that 40th day after the
[1:04:22] resurrection he took all of them up to
[1:04:24] heaven
[1:04:25] but then he didn't stop there brother
[1:04:26] Irvin he sent down gifts of the Holy
[1:04:28] Ghost amen amen
[1:04:31] Amen to men so men would be Anointed
[1:04:33] with the same spirit that was on Jesus
[1:04:35] amen amen
[1:04:37] amen and what are those five gifts the
[1:04:39] Bible says I'm right here in verse 11.
[1:04:41] let's read it together ready one two
[1:04:43] three and he gave some Apostles some
[1:04:47] prophets and some evangelists and some
[1:04:51] pastors and teachers
[1:04:54] so Jesus conquered death he rose up
[1:04:57] sound of the throne he said what can I
[1:04:59] give my church I'll give him five
[1:05:00] preaching gifts
[1:05:03] and what do these five preaching gifts
[1:05:04] gonna do in verse 12.
[1:05:07] for the perfecting of the Saints oh
[1:05:10] church if you can catch a revelation of
[1:05:12] it preaching is the key Holy Ghost
[1:05:15] anointed preaching is the key to your
[1:05:18] Perfection your completeness your
[1:05:20] maturity the power is in the preaching
[1:05:23] of God's word hallelujah
[1:05:27] that's exactly right praise God
[1:05:30] in other words Jesus in heaven is
[1:05:31] thinking the best thing I can give
[1:05:33] the Saints in Junction City is five-fold
[1:05:36] preachers
[1:05:38] that's going to help the sisters the
[1:05:39] most that's going to help the brothers
[1:05:41] the most that's going to help these
[1:05:42] little children the most if they get
[1:05:44] real called men of God preaching by the
[1:05:47] Holy Ghost that's going to make them
[1:05:48] perfect that's going to help them mature
[1:05:50] and be real Christians praise God
[1:05:53] oh Hallelujah
[1:05:55] and Paul said we'll be judged by this
[1:05:58] Allelujah amen
[1:06:01] will be judged by this real preachers
[1:06:04] who are anointed of the same holy spirit
[1:06:06] that was on Jesus
[1:06:07] the Bible said they're going to perfect
[1:06:09] the Saints for the work of the ministry
[1:06:11] the gifts are going to do the work of
[1:06:12] the ministry praying for the sick right
[1:06:14] baptizing all the work of the ministry
[1:06:17] for the edifying that means the
[1:06:19] strengthening of the body of Christ
[1:06:22] until when brother Jesse until 2024 well
[1:06:26] no
[1:06:28] until verse 13 we all come in the unity
[1:06:32] of the faith
[1:06:34] and of the knowledge of the son of God
[1:06:38] unto a perfect man unto the measure of
[1:06:41] the stature of the fullness of Christ
[1:06:44] so God's going to use these five
[1:06:45] preaching gifts until Jesus returns
[1:06:49] because the church will not be perfect
[1:06:51] until they all got the Holy Ghost and
[1:06:53] then they're going up in the Rapture
[1:06:54] brother
[1:06:55] praise God every son and daughter that's
[1:06:58] got the Holy Ghost when they're filled
[1:07:00] with the Holy Ghost then Jesus say ah
[1:07:01] now I can snatch my wife away come here
[1:07:04] honey it's time for the wedding ceremony
[1:07:06] praise God
[1:07:07] let's go again let's go get ready for
[1:07:09] the marriage supper it's time for the
[1:07:11] wedding celebration the wedding supper
[1:07:13] and then we could have a thousand year
[1:07:14] honeymoon in the Millennium praise God
[1:07:16] Amen oh this whole story of Earth
[1:07:19] history is a wedding and it's your
[1:07:22] wedding with Jesus Christ you're the one
[1:07:24] and Jesus is the bridegroom amen
[1:07:27] oh these last two thousand years Jesus
[1:07:30] has been getting a wife ready for his
[1:07:32] wedding
[1:07:33] Hallelujah
[1:07:35] and here we are in the last Church age
[1:07:37] and he's getting a wife ready in this
[1:07:38] last Church age and he chose you
[1:07:41] oh somebody should have shouted Amen on
[1:07:43] that I'm sorry brother
[1:07:45] I picked that up for another preacher I
[1:07:46] should probably stop doing that
[1:07:48] sometimes I'll pound on the out there
[1:07:50] I got so much uh Zeo I don't know
[1:07:52] sometimes I just try to get it out
[1:07:55] but he chose you to be his wife
[1:07:59] he chose you to be the obedient wife the
[1:08:02] Bride of Jesus Christ amen
[1:08:04] amen he's gonna get you ready by five
[1:08:06] preaching gifts now Apostles are
[1:08:08] missionaries there are people that go to
[1:08:10] places where there's no message churches
[1:08:12] no Bible churches and they make converse
[1:08:14] with major signs wonders and miracles
[1:08:16] and then they move on and start another
[1:08:21] prophets are like brother Brandon where
[1:08:24] you foretell the future in the name of
[1:08:26] the Lord
[1:08:27] and you reveal the secrets according to
[1:08:29] Amos 3 verse 7. like he revealed the
[1:08:31] Seven Seals through Jesus
[1:08:35] uh evangelists are preachers that travel
[1:08:37] from church to church and the uh they
[1:08:39] stir that they serve churches up and
[1:08:41] they just go like in a cycle
[1:08:42] a Circa that's the word circuit right
[1:08:44] like the circuit Rider Preacher Brother
[1:08:45] I talked about the Circa writer preacher
[1:08:47] used to ride the horse he just go from
[1:08:49] church to church preaching Revival
[1:08:51] services around and around and around
[1:08:54] the next is the pastor that's what I am
[1:08:56] I'm a shepherd of one flock now look
[1:08:59] God's using me though in a different
[1:09:00] move right here by God's grace
[1:09:03] and that's okay preachers can have more
[1:09:05] than one gift
[1:09:07] Paul said I was a teacher of the
[1:09:08] Gentiles we all know he was a prophet he
[1:09:11] prophesied of the rapture
[1:09:13] he said a teacher of the Gentiles he was
[1:09:15] the Apostle Paul he was a missionary
[1:09:18] you could have more than one gift I
[1:09:20] believe brother random had all five
[1:09:21] gifts and at different times of his life
[1:09:22] God would use those gifts
[1:09:25] all right amen and the last one is
[1:09:27] teacher a teacher is kind of like an
[1:09:30] evangelist except he goes out in the
[1:09:32] deeper teachings of God
[1:09:34] real deep things wow I never thought
[1:09:36] about like that I got a better
[1:09:38] understanding of baptism I never had
[1:09:40] before because the teacher took me
[1:09:43] deeper gave me more instruction on the
[1:09:45] word of God
[1:09:46] right
[1:09:48] amen like a teacher would teach our
[1:09:49] sisters how to be even more holy unto
[1:09:52] God and our brothers to be even better
[1:09:55] leaders unto God teaching would do that
[1:09:57] it'll take you deeper in your walk with
[1:09:59] God
[1:10:00] it's a different gift than a pastor
[1:10:03] it's a different gift than an evangelist
[1:10:07] and brother Harley Jesus said these five
[1:10:09] are going to make us ready they're going
[1:10:11] to bring us into a real Unity
[1:10:13] so we're ready for Jesus coming
[1:10:15] [Music]
[1:10:17] until we all come into Unity the faith
[1:10:20] praise God
[1:10:21] as a pastor I've seen teachers come in
[1:10:23] to our church I've seen a man just we
[1:10:25] only had one or two Apostles over the
[1:10:26] years
[1:10:28] um we've never had any Prophets
[1:10:30] because there's not many out there
[1:10:33] God determines the gifts but I've seen
[1:10:35] God use these gifts and keep our church
[1:10:37] on fire gives us Revival speaks to our
[1:10:40] hearts encourages us uh Supernatural
[1:10:43] gifts and healings and miracles and all
[1:10:46] these things God uses all these to
[1:10:48] perfect our faith to build our faith up
[1:10:51] and to prepare us for Jesus is coming
[1:10:53] amen that's right oh that's right
[1:10:56] okay
[1:10:57] now what do they also do they make you
[1:10:59] mature so you're not a baby Christian
[1:11:01] look at verse 14.
[1:11:03] that we henceforth be no more children
[1:11:05] toss to and fro and carried about with
[1:11:09] every wind of Doctrine see that's what
[1:11:11] these these churches go through they go
[1:11:13] from this Doctrine to that Doctrine this
[1:11:15] false Doctrine to that but God wants
[1:11:17] somebody who stands right there in the
[1:11:18] middle they know the truth they can't be
[1:11:20] swayed by any lies from Satan they know
[1:11:23] thus saith the Lord they know the Bible
[1:11:25] and they stand on the Bible praise God
[1:11:27] amen that's right
[1:11:30] that's right
[1:11:32] see the right preachers bring you to a
[1:11:35] real maturity in the faith and you know
[1:11:37] the Bible
[1:11:39] Hallelujah like brother Adam said I want
[1:11:41] to know the author but I also want to
[1:11:43] know his book really well too
[1:11:46] some people know his book well but they
[1:11:48] don't know the author I want to know
[1:11:49] both praise God I just want to have it
[1:11:52] memorized but memorize memorize I know
[1:11:53] this I only know the voice of the Holy
[1:11:55] Spirit too praise God ah amen I want to
[1:11:58] know both I want to know Christ and his
[1:12:00] power his resurrection and his
[1:12:02] sufferings I would know Jesus all the
[1:12:04] way praise God
[1:12:08] now go to Romans 10 13 I was quoting
[1:12:10] this one earlier brother Urban lunch
[1:12:11] read this one for us Romans 10 13 Saints
[1:12:16] foreign
[1:12:19] I've always been a fireball preacher
[1:12:20] like this I can't help it
[1:12:23] I came out of the world and when I found
[1:12:25] this message my La I I was instantly on
[1:12:28] fire praise God I just couldn't I just I
[1:12:31] live it eat it breathe it sleep it teach
[1:12:33] it amen it has transformed my life
[1:12:36] praise God all I saw was religion and
[1:12:38] emotion and and uh the Pentecostal
[1:12:40] domination I thank God for it thank God
[1:12:42] it was there but they didn't have all
[1:12:44] the truth I always knew something was
[1:12:45] missing but when I heard Serpentine when
[1:12:47] I heard uh trying to go to service when
[1:12:49] I heard God as one person oh my soul lit
[1:12:52] a fire praise God that's right because
[1:12:54] every single one of them pointed me back
[1:12:56] to the Bible
[1:12:58] that's what the domination could not do
[1:13:00] you can't point to where the Bible said
[1:13:02] everybody speaks in tongues in fact the
[1:13:04] Bible says do all speak with tongues no
[1:13:07] they can't point you to the Bible
[1:13:10] but with our faith brother Graham said
[1:13:12] we can always point to the Bible praise
[1:13:14] God that's how we know it's right
[1:13:16] Hallelujah
[1:13:18] I like my brother Madison God is so
[1:13:21] great he could do things outside the
[1:13:23] Bible
[1:13:24] God good
[1:13:25] he said but he won't because he wants to
[1:13:27] keep his word to us praise God Amen
[1:13:30] he wasn't he's gonna he's gonna keep
[1:13:33] referencing that love letter he gave us
[1:13:35] praise God he's not going to save us
[1:13:37] he's not going to betray us he's not
[1:13:38] going to change anything I am the Lord
[1:13:40] thy God they changed that Jesus Christ
[1:13:42] is the same yesterday today and forever
[1:13:45] and we can know Jesus Christ today
[1:13:47] praise God Amen
[1:13:48] amen amen hallelujah
[1:13:51] Romans 10 13 brother can you read 13 14
[1:13:54] and 15.
[1:13:55] who's ever so called upon
[1:14:02] the name whom they have not believed and
[1:14:05] how shall they believe in him of whom
[1:14:07] they have not heard and how shall they
[1:14:10] hear without a creature
[1:14:12] and how shall they preach except they be
[1:14:15] sinned as it is written how beautiful
[1:14:18] are the feet of them that preach the
[1:14:19] gospel of peace and bring Glad Tidings
[1:14:22] up good things
[1:14:24] amen let's all say amen amen so before
[1:14:29] anybody can get saved God has to First
[1:14:31] well I'm going to choose a man second
[1:14:33] I'm gonna anoint that man I'm gonna give
[1:14:34] that man a message third I'm gonna send
[1:14:36] that man and then that man comes to you
[1:14:38] and he preaches God's word and you say
[1:14:40] Amen I'm calling on Jesus and now you've
[1:14:43] receive Christ praise God
[1:14:45] that's right hey man that's what the
[1:14:47] Bible says
[1:14:50] so now we know the order of services and
[1:14:52] now we know who needs a preach in these
[1:14:53] Services anointed men of God need to
[1:14:56] preach in these services
[1:14:57] the five-fold ministry
[1:15:00] there's got to be teachers there's got
[1:15:01] to be pastors I've answers now the
[1:15:03] pastor does most of the preaching
[1:15:05] because he's a shepherd
[1:15:07] right the pastor does most of the
[1:15:09] preaching like I'll preach almost every
[1:15:11] service except maybe one or two a month
[1:15:12] I'm preaching every Wednesday night
[1:15:14] twice on Sunday but maybe I get one
[1:15:16] weekend off a month
[1:15:18] some people preach more than that but I
[1:15:19] need to have a break amen I've learned
[1:15:22] I'm gonna if I yell like this for all
[1:15:24] those times I'm gonna have no voice
[1:15:27] that's my own fault but God's not making
[1:15:29] me do that I'm I gotta program says
[1:15:31] sometimes your Zeal eats up your wisdom
[1:15:33] sometimes my Zeal he's up my wisdom you
[1:15:35] know I'm just being honest but that's
[1:15:37] what I like I like to take at least one
[1:15:39] weekend off a month where I can just sit
[1:15:40] there and say Amen Pete teacher amen
[1:15:42] evangelist amen Apostle whatever it is
[1:15:45] that's right and so many times God gives
[1:15:48] me exactly what I need him I'm
[1:15:50] struggling and whatever I'm going
[1:15:52] through battles like brother Danny we
[1:15:53] all go through battles and then God will
[1:15:55] bring a word it's just exactly what I
[1:15:57] need
[1:15:58] and I can go up to the Altar and repent
[1:15:59] and rejoice or I can get my dance back
[1:16:03] or whatever it is amen
[1:16:04] because God knows what his children need
[1:16:07] praise God Amen so God's a god anoints
[1:16:09] him man gives him the message and said
[1:16:11] go preach to the Saints in Junction City
[1:16:13] Hallelujah
[1:16:14] he anoints a man say go preach to the
[1:16:16] Saints in accord go feed my Lambs the
[1:16:19] food of God hallelujah
[1:16:21] Hallelujah
[1:16:23] go give them their meat in due season go
[1:16:27] lead them beside Still Waters Hallelujah
[1:16:31] go leave them behind beside Green
[1:16:33] Pastures you God says I'm gonna anoint
[1:16:36] that man and he's going to restore your
[1:16:38] soul hallelujah
[1:16:40] thank God Amen
[1:16:43] sometimes our souls come in here we're
[1:16:44] so discouraged how can I make it and
[1:16:47] then a sermon will come and it'll preach
[1:16:48] it'll build up your soul you say no I
[1:16:50] can make it by God's grace
[1:16:52] Hallelujah
[1:16:54] that's what the fivefold Ministries to
[1:16:56] do
[1:16:57] Jesus said until we all come in the
[1:16:59] union of the faith
[1:17:00] well we're not all unified yet so we
[1:17:02] still need the bipole ministry
[1:17:06] but you know what brother Irving brother
[1:17:07] John I know you guys are preachers
[1:17:09] the the greatest attack right now
[1:17:11] Satan's using is against the fivefold
[1:17:13] ministry
[1:17:14] amen that's right
[1:17:16] through
[1:17:17] brother randoms family members
[1:17:20] they're saying they're they're saying
[1:17:22] brother Branham should preach first
[1:17:24] before everybody else he's dead
[1:17:28] he's dead and they're saying brother
[1:17:30] Adam should be first and then preachers
[1:17:32] second or just preachers not preach at
[1:17:34] all I'm sorry that's an antichrist
[1:17:37] spirit because of what the Bible says
[1:17:39] right here
[1:17:42] for the last two thousand years God has
[1:17:44] had a church and he's never let dead men
[1:17:47] lead the church
[1:17:48] amen he's always had living men service
[1:17:51] year after year preach after preacher
[1:17:55] he lives he preaches he goes out the
[1:17:57] scene and dies God raises up another
[1:17:59] preacher praise God but now with
[1:18:01] technology they think they can change
[1:18:03] the Bible Ministry I'm sorry keep
[1:18:05] reading the Bible God never changes the
[1:18:08] fivefold ministry and brother bear said
[1:18:10] don't you change one thing about the
[1:18:11] Evangelistic Services he said Brothers
[1:18:13] keep preaching as hard as you can I'm
[1:18:16] right behind you praise God oh
[1:18:19] here he'd be right behind me praise God
[1:18:22] right thank God Amen
[1:18:25] you want to be saying sit down and press
[1:18:27] play and Obey but Ray would not be
[1:18:29] saying that because he never said that
[1:18:30] when he was on Earth amen that's right
[1:18:31] amen we respect brother Ram everything
[1:18:33] he did everything he taught us but it's
[1:18:35] just like Paul just like any other
[1:18:36] preacher the word that they preach we
[1:18:39] believe but now it's our turn to preach
[1:18:41] amen
[1:18:42] it's our turn to believe it's our turn
[1:18:44] to trust God Amen
[1:18:46] it's our turn to call upon God
[1:18:48] hallelujah
[1:18:50] that's right
[1:18:51] we listen to brother Branham
[1:18:54] we we see the how the Holy Spirit leads
[1:18:56] us and we preach the word of God that
[1:18:58] God gives us
[1:18:59] you can even listen to brother Neville
[1:19:01] he was the pastor there Brown Tabernacle
[1:19:03] while brother man was there
[1:19:06] you can listen to him
[1:19:07] you can read uh Charles virgins sermons
[1:19:10] you can read Jonathan Edward's sermons
[1:19:13] and whatever's right out of there you
[1:19:15] can preach it if it's from the Bible
[1:19:18] amen hallelujah
[1:19:21] just so you know one of the greatest
[1:19:22] attacks now is on the fivefold ministry
[1:19:24] they're trying to pull down the fivefold
[1:19:27] ministry and exalt brother Brandon up
[1:19:28] like he's the only one we need I'm sorry
[1:19:30] the Bible said there's five gifts that
[1:19:32] we need
[1:19:33] not one
[1:19:35] and I challenge that Spirit of
[1:19:37] antichrist I challenge that Spirit show
[1:19:39] me where the Bible ever changed it
[1:19:42] show me where brother Branham ever
[1:19:43] changed it they cannot show me that
[1:19:47] that's right Hallelujah
[1:19:49] so that's why
[1:19:51] that's why preached that so hard
[1:19:53] because Satan he if he can just get you
[1:19:56] off on one word
[1:19:58] then the Bible says like leaven sisters
[1:20:00] what do you do when you put leaven in
[1:20:01] the meal what does it do it spreads
[1:20:02] through the whole rest of the meal
[1:20:04] if he can get one sin in the church it
[1:20:07] just comes back to legalism right it
[1:20:08] comes back something's wrong in the
[1:20:10] church
[1:20:11] the churches Bewitched something's wrong
[1:20:13] a lie has come into the church
[1:20:16] but the Bible said you gotta Purge out
[1:20:18] the old leaven
[1:20:20] you gotta clean out the old leaven get
[1:20:22] the sin out of church all churches sin
[1:20:24] sometimes always got to clean up
[1:20:26] sometimes we all need a good cleaning
[1:20:27] out sometimes but God promise when you
[1:20:29] get the sin out he said you're like a
[1:20:31] new lump you're like a new church in
[1:20:33] other words you're in Revival the Holy
[1:20:35] Ghost will pour out his blessings again
[1:20:36] amen
[1:20:38] no church is perfect amen you're gonna
[1:20:41] go through Happy Times hopefully you're
[1:20:42] in happy time now because y'all are done
[1:20:44] got baptized
[1:20:46] but there was going to come hard times
[1:20:48] you really have to stick together
[1:20:50] right exactly right and that's the proof
[1:20:52] you have Jesus because Jesus said if you
[1:20:54] love he said he said greater love than
[1:20:56] no man has this then a man lays down his
[1:20:58] life for his friends
[1:20:59] right Jesus said that
[1:21:02] and she said also about love he said the
[1:21:04] way you know there are my followers is
[1:21:06] because they have love one for another
[1:21:11] we've had people come in from other
[1:21:12] churches from around the world some
[1:21:14] brothers from Africa and we're just a
[1:21:17] small tiny Church leave I'm sorry Levi
[1:21:18] knows that early Barbara Anna we're just
[1:21:21] a real tiny Church but we've had people
[1:21:23] brother Levi from around the world come
[1:21:25] in we've had people from other churches
[1:21:27] that have 300 400 people come in and say
[1:21:29] wow we feel the love of Jesus Christ in
[1:21:31] this church and we don't feel it at our
[1:21:32] mega church
[1:21:34] even the message
[1:21:36] so what's the most important thing a big
[1:21:38] building and big numbers the most
[1:21:40] important thing is a big love
[1:21:42] amen and thank God we got it it's G it's
[1:21:45] Jesus Christ amen
[1:21:47] he is the love of God Amen
[1:21:51] so if you give me a choice do I want a
[1:21:53] big church with lots of money big
[1:21:54] buildings lots of members without the
[1:21:56] love of God or would I rather have a
[1:21:58] small church with the love of God I'll
[1:22:00] take the love of God every time amen
[1:22:02] that's right because Jesus said this is
[1:22:04] the proof that you're my followers
[1:22:07] you got love one for another we've had a
[1:22:10] brother come from Africa three or four
[1:22:11] times and each time he leaves he comes
[1:22:13] back he said I'm homesick for your
[1:22:15] church because the love of God that we
[1:22:16] feel there and
[1:22:19] he's been in the message longer than
[1:22:20] that well he's almost been the message
[1:22:22] longer than I've been alive
[1:22:25] and he misses our church because of the
[1:22:27] love of Jesus Christ there I was
[1:22:29] listening to brother last night uh time
[1:22:31] tested memorials 1957.
[1:22:33] little man said oh he said the love of
[1:22:35] God he said oh you can have all your
[1:22:37] signs wonders evidences he said that's
[1:22:39] fine he said but just give me the love
[1:22:41] of God in our church
[1:22:44] that's right so if you had the choice
[1:22:45] would you have the signs wonders and
[1:22:47] miracles no love or would you rather
[1:22:49] have no signs wonders of Miracles and
[1:22:50] love brother Adam said give me the love
[1:22:52] of God
[1:22:54] oh Hallelujah now if you love God you'll
[1:22:57] have signs wonders Miracles like brother
[1:22:58] John's healing that's an absolute sign
[1:23:00] Wonder miracle
[1:23:02] and I'm sure you got some more of them
[1:23:03] Levi's had some
[1:23:05] you'll have them but this main thing is
[1:23:07] just have the love of God that's the
[1:23:08] main thing
[1:23:10] that's right
[1:23:12] all right
[1:23:16] I'm almost there church I'm about
[1:23:18] I'm not gonna look at the clock
[1:23:20] all right now go to Hebrews 10 24
[1:23:24] Hebrews 10 24.
[1:23:26] I got to keep my word I'm not gonna look
[1:23:28] at the clock
[1:23:29] not gonna feel bad if I preach long
[1:23:32] somebody needs it out there by God's
[1:23:34] grace
[1:23:34] I'll say like this I Don't Preach long
[1:23:37] enough
[1:23:38] now they're probably laughing at home
[1:23:41] 24. remember Church Paul preached one
[1:23:44] time all night long
[1:23:46] and utica's fell out of the window and
[1:23:48] died and they laid hands on him and
[1:23:49] raised them up
[1:23:51] now you talk about a long sermon brother
[1:23:54] you talk about now turn to the next
[1:23:56] chapter now we'll go next that's a long
[1:23:58] night of preaching
[1:23:59] that's right the longest one brother
[1:24:01] Randy I think was six hours spoken word
[1:24:03] original C 1962. I think it was a six
[1:24:05] hour sermon
[1:24:09] now that's love that's love when you can
[1:24:11] sit through all that praise God that's
[1:24:13] great
[1:24:15] that's a real long sermon Hebrews 10 24.
[1:24:22] it's just the Ruth why don't you read uh
[1:24:23] can you read 24 and 25. now we're
[1:24:25] getting into everybody needs a home
[1:24:27] church and a pastor
[1:24:29] because a sheep without a Shepherd I was
[1:24:32] just I was driving by down this
[1:24:33] beautiful country I saw a bunch of
[1:24:35] babies or little sheep little lambs out
[1:24:37] there how are they going to do without
[1:24:38] their Shepherd how are they gonna do
[1:24:39] without a pastor what do you think's
[1:24:40] gonna happen
[1:24:41] they're probably gonna starve they're
[1:24:43] gonna run away
[1:24:44] maybe not sorry but run away no
[1:24:46] protection
[1:24:48] we're we're the Sheep of God and so the
[1:24:50] Sheep of God need a pastor to feed them
[1:24:52] the word of God
[1:24:53] I love it Jesus leaves the 99 to go get
[1:24:56] the one
[1:24:57] [Laughter]
[1:25:00] he's got 99 safe ones he said I'll leave
[1:25:03] those 99 I gotta go get one real quick
[1:25:05] you would hold you 99 just hold on I'm
[1:25:07] gonna go get that one and then he brings
[1:25:09] him back and he brings him on his
[1:25:10] shoulders he puts him on the strongest
[1:25:12] part of them Hallelujah and that's
[1:25:14] another church when God Saves our souls
[1:25:16] we're riding on his strength we feel
[1:25:18] God's strength we're in a safe spot
[1:25:20] because he puts us on his shoulders
[1:25:21] Hallelujah
[1:25:23] amen he doesn't drag you into his into
[1:25:26] his flock he puts you on his shoulders
[1:25:28] he lifts you up
[1:25:30] and now you're up on his shoulders now
[1:25:32] you can see things a lot differently up
[1:25:33] here praise God Amen oh amen you're up
[1:25:37] there in Heavenly places amen in Christ
[1:25:40] Jesus
[1:25:42] all right sister Route 24 25. and let us
[1:25:45] consider one another to provoke unto
[1:25:47] love and to Good Works not forsaken the
[1:25:50] selling of ourselves together as a
[1:25:53] matter of some is
[1:25:54] but exhorting one another so much the
[1:25:57] more as you see the data approaching
[1:26:00] thank you
[1:26:01] now brother Brad uses the scripture many
[1:26:03] times to show everyone needs a home
[1:26:06] church and a pastor
[1:26:08] right amen
[1:26:12] now the Bible says it there why do we
[1:26:14] gather to provoke one another
[1:26:17] that means to stir you up or inspire you
[1:26:19] like how come here I'll see brother
[1:26:21] Irvin that'll inspire me to be a better
[1:26:22] Christian
[1:26:24] I hear John good testimony like that
[1:26:25] stirs me up praise God hallelujah Glory
[1:26:29] amen and then see someone will see my
[1:26:31] life and they'll say praise God brother
[1:26:33] Jesse is a good he's a faithful brother
[1:26:35] that makes me stronger in the faith
[1:26:38] we encourage one another no the body
[1:26:41] builds itself up in love isn't that what
[1:26:44] the body does it passes oxygen and
[1:26:46] nutrients back and forth one to another
[1:26:48] that's the same thing happening here
[1:26:49] praise God Amen
[1:26:52] each part of the body needs the other
[1:26:54] part of the body we need sister Ruth we
[1:26:56] need I got to get your names remember my
[1:26:57] sisters but we need all them we need
[1:26:59] every one of us praise God I'll get it
[1:27:01] one of these days
[1:27:03] we I need each one I need higher I need
[1:27:05] Levi I need Barb I need John I need uh
[1:27:08] uh John that or Jesse back there in the
[1:27:10] back and John we need each other brother
[1:27:12] Irvin because we encourage one another
[1:27:14] and the Bible said gather more not less
[1:27:17] gather more as we see Christ coming
[1:27:19] approaching
[1:27:23] that means you need your church family
[1:27:25] more as time goes on
[1:27:27] not less
[1:27:29] well I need to see brother Daniel less I
[1:27:31] need to see I really want to be around
[1:27:32] John less no that's the devil I want to
[1:27:35] be around them more
[1:27:38] Hallelujah church as since I've been
[1:27:40] Pastor from 2006 I've missed three
[1:27:43] services that's it for being sick
[1:27:47] three times in 17 years I miss church
[1:27:49] every Wednesday
[1:27:52] every Sunday
[1:27:53] three times
[1:27:55] now I tell the church now don't come to
[1:27:56] church sick because you're gonna get
[1:27:57] everybody sick unless you've got thou
[1:27:59] saith the Lord you're going to get
[1:28:00] healed you should stay home at you
[1:28:02] should stay home and not get the whole
[1:28:03] church sick
[1:28:05] that's just my thoughts you know uh
[1:28:08] because a lot of people say they got
[1:28:09] faith and they come here they spread the
[1:28:10] germs but they don't get healed and then
[1:28:12] everybody else gets sick
[1:28:15] so that's just that's just one idea
[1:28:17] that's that's my own human thought there
[1:28:18] but
[1:28:19] the fact is we got to gather more as we
[1:28:21] see that day approaching
[1:28:23] and the church said amen right
[1:28:27] and look at look at uh look at uh
[1:28:29] Jeffersonville and brown Tabernacle they
[1:28:31] don't even come together for church
[1:28:32] right now because of construction they
[1:28:34] don't even gather more they're not
[1:28:36] physically Gathering anymore they're
[1:28:38] breaking the word of God
[1:28:39] I know they have construction going on
[1:28:41] but they're breaking the word of God the
[1:28:43] Bible said we got to gather more as we
[1:28:46] see that day approaching brother Ram
[1:28:48] said if you can't go to church at your
[1:28:49] regular church he said go somewhere he
[1:28:52] said if you can't get a loaf he said get
[1:28:53] a slack for a slice of bread amen that's
[1:28:56] right
[1:28:58] he said if there's if there's no message
[1:29:00] churches he said go to a Baptist go to
[1:29:02] the Pentecostal go somewhere he said
[1:29:04] don't stay at home he said that
[1:29:06] dishonors Christ
[1:29:08] because Christ rose on a Sunday so you
[1:29:11] should rise up on Sunday and go to
[1:29:13] church amen
[1:29:16] Hallelujah
[1:29:18] really
[1:29:20] good
[1:29:22] they dishonor Christ when they stay at
[1:29:24] home and don't gather with the rest of
[1:29:26] the body they neglect the rest of the
[1:29:27] body amen
[1:29:29] that's right it's exactly right
[1:29:31] I don't care if they got construction or
[1:29:32] not they ought to rent out the Holiday
[1:29:33] Inn and get everybody in there
[1:29:35] or some other convention or something
[1:29:37] like that
[1:29:40] in Luke chapter 4 the Bible said Jesus
[1:29:42] was in the synagogue every Sabbath
[1:29:45] what are you saying brother Jess I'm
[1:29:47] saying Jesus Christ never miss church
[1:29:50] and that was in the natural think about
[1:29:52] today whoever two or three are gathered
[1:29:54] there he is Jesus comes to church every
[1:29:56] time because he's faithful because he
[1:29:58] wants to meet with his children he wants
[1:30:00] to edify you he wants to strengthen you
[1:30:02] he wants to build you up praise God
[1:30:06] amen thank God
[1:30:10] and brother bear makes a joke brother
[1:30:12] and I can share the brother says you
[1:30:14] ought to be a legalist in going to
[1:30:15] church he said at least to get started
[1:30:17] he makes a joke
[1:30:20] brother John we're not legalism remember
[1:30:22] brother makes a joke you ought to be a
[1:30:23] legalist and go to church every time
[1:30:26] and I found that to be true I was
[1:30:27] preaching at our church sometimes I go
[1:30:29] to church I'm all tired I worked all day
[1:30:30] I got a headache but I'll start singing
[1:30:33] I'll start preaching pretty soon my foot
[1:30:35] up time pretty soon I'll raise my hands
[1:30:37] pretty soon I'm jumping and praising God
[1:30:39] pretty soon my headache's gone
[1:30:42] what happened to all my tiredness I
[1:30:45] forgot about that and now the Holy Ghost
[1:30:47] is anointing me now I can praise God
[1:30:49] like I ought to praise God Amen
[1:30:53] where'd my headache go God took it away
[1:30:54] that's happened to me numerous times
[1:30:56] I've been preaching with a headache by
[1:30:58] the but by the time I'm finished the
[1:30:59] headache's gone he healed me right while
[1:31:01] I'm preaching
[1:31:03] Hallelujah
[1:31:04] thank God amen amen
[1:31:11] Amen brother said we believe every
[1:31:13] Christian ought to have a home Church
[1:31:14] they go to every Christian ought to meet
[1:31:17] somewhere with believers he said
[1:31:18] wherever you meet that's the church
[1:31:22] you should have a home church and a
[1:31:23] pastor brother random called brother
[1:31:25] Neville his Pastor did you know that yes
[1:31:29] he said brother Neville our pastor
[1:31:32] because a prophet can't be the pastor at
[1:31:34] the same time if he's traveling outside
[1:31:35] the church he can't pass to the church
[1:31:37] if he's gone half of the year
[1:31:39] right that's right
[1:31:41] so he would say brother Neville the one
[1:31:43] who stayed there and preached to the
[1:31:44] Saints brother Neville was the pastor
[1:31:46] brother Branham was the prophet amen
[1:31:48] that's right every person needs a pastor
[1:31:51] that's right praise God and who's the
[1:31:54] pastor of the pastors Jesus is amen
[1:31:56] that's right because we got to rely
[1:31:58] every service brother Irvin brother John
[1:32:00] every service I was like God help me I'm
[1:32:02] nothing I have nothing to preach you
[1:32:03] know sometimes I'm so tired I'm so
[1:32:06] discouraged and yet God will come down
[1:32:07] and preach and people say You Preach
[1:32:09] exactly what I needed and I knew I had
[1:32:11] nothing to preach to them
[1:32:12] because it's not me feeding them it's
[1:32:15] Jesus feeding them praise God
[1:32:18] in my weakness his strength is made
[1:32:21] perfect amen
[1:32:25] amen that's second Corinthians his
[1:32:27] strength is made perfect in my weakness
[1:32:30] Jesus cares too much about his sheep to
[1:32:33] let my tiredness get in the way
[1:32:35] he's going to bypass my tiredness and
[1:32:37] he's going to feed the sheep because he
[1:32:39] loves the Sheep
[1:32:40] we just got to trust God
[1:32:43] thank God almost finished here
[1:32:45] I think
[1:32:47] now next I want to get into your uh
[1:32:50] money situations here go to First
[1:32:52] Corinthians 9 First Corinthians 9.
[1:32:54] here's how a church is operated
[1:32:57] if you don't know this roll around
[1:32:58] taught this the church runs the church
[1:33:01] gets money from the members through ties
[1:33:04] and offerings
[1:33:06] okay so the church every church should
[1:33:09] have a Treasurer who watches over the
[1:33:10] the money
[1:33:13] that's how it was in Jeep remember Jesus
[1:33:15] started ministry and uh Judas ascarate
[1:33:18] was his treasurer
[1:33:19] now he was a bad Treasurer but we all
[1:33:21] got good Treasures
[1:33:24] but somebody you know the Bible said
[1:33:26] Joanna
[1:33:28] or some of it Mary Magdalene all these
[1:33:29] women gave money into the church and so
[1:33:32] Judas kept the money whenever they need
[1:33:33] something they go out and get the food
[1:33:34] go out and get whatever they need
[1:33:37] a church has to have finances
[1:33:40] so everybody that works a job you should
[1:33:43] take 10 of your money that's your tithe
[1:33:46] the word tithe means tenth and give it
[1:33:48] to the church treasurer and then on top
[1:33:51] of that you should give an offering
[1:33:52] based upon how much you can afford and
[1:33:54] how much you love Jesus
[1:33:55] amen the Bible calls a free will
[1:33:58] offering
[1:34:01] so in the offering you really see how
[1:34:02] much you love God
[1:34:04] attempt is whatever it should give
[1:34:06] that's your duty that's that's the Bible
[1:34:09] in the offering you see how much do you
[1:34:12] really trust God
[1:34:13] how much do you love God right and the
[1:34:16] Bible said just give just give whatever
[1:34:18] you can give with a cheerful heart
[1:34:20] God doesn't want you saying okay I'll
[1:34:21] give this
[1:34:24] can't believe they make me get that
[1:34:26] money
[1:34:27] God don't receive that the Bible said
[1:34:30] God loves a cheerful Giver amen
[1:34:33] amen so church if you pay your 10 and
[1:34:35] then you got you can only give one more
[1:34:36] percent just do it happily thank God
[1:34:39] just be happy when you give that extra
[1:34:41] offering
[1:34:42] that's right
[1:34:45] said if your church is big enough the
[1:34:47] tithe should support the pastor so he
[1:34:49] don't have to work he can just study and
[1:34:51] pray and preach
[1:34:53] but in our church our church isn't big
[1:34:55] enough so I got to work a job too
[1:34:57] but I still take the ties I'll use a
[1:34:59] little bit of that for to feed my eight
[1:35:00] children
[1:35:01] and then but the majority of it I used
[1:35:03] to rent out a building that brother Ali
[1:35:06] and Levi been up and then I give it to
[1:35:07] guest preachers to come preach for us
[1:35:11] because the labor is worthy of his
[1:35:12] higher
[1:35:14] muscle not the ox that drives out the
[1:35:16] corn now we're not preaching money today
[1:35:18] you know I'm just telling you what the
[1:35:20] Bible says praise God I don't want your
[1:35:21] money
[1:35:22] but this is how a church is funded
[1:35:25] First Corinthians 9 verse 13 and 14.
[1:35:29] brother Howard you got that can you now
[1:35:31] in your own time read seven through
[1:35:33] twelve Paul talks about this he explains
[1:35:36] it a farmer doesn't plant crops and then
[1:35:39] not eat the food in his farm
[1:35:42] right
[1:35:44] nobody if you if you have a Vineyard of
[1:35:47] grapes you don't plant the grapes and
[1:35:49] then not drink the wine
[1:35:51] no
[1:35:52] neither does a preacher preach and not
[1:35:54] get the benefits of that or the help of
[1:35:56] that
[1:35:58] okay now brother Howard can you read
[1:36:00] verses 13 and 14.
[1:36:03] 9 yes thank you first Corinthians 9
[1:36:05] 13-14
[1:36:10] [Music]
[1:36:14] live of the things of the temple and
[1:36:18] they which wait at the altar are
[1:36:19] partakers with the altar
[1:36:22] even so has the Lord ordained that they
[1:36:25] would preached the gospel should live of
[1:36:27] the Gospel amen now Paul later on says
[1:36:31] he didn't take any tithes and offerings
[1:36:33] because he didn't want the people
[1:36:33] thinking
[1:36:35] uh that he was after money
[1:36:38] right so Paul says I didn't take any of
[1:36:40] that
[1:36:41] but I want you to see there
[1:36:44] if you look at the Old Testament the
[1:36:46] Levites lived off the tithes and
[1:36:48] offerings of the other tribes
[1:36:50] amen and Paul says just as they lived
[1:36:52] off the gospel preachers today should
[1:36:55] live off the gospel
[1:36:57] now I hope someday our church gets big
[1:36:58] enough so I don't have to go to work I
[1:37:00] just like to go study and preach and
[1:37:01] pray all day I'd like to do that but I
[1:37:04] just got to wait I've been doing it 17
[1:37:05] years I'll just keep waiting if it never
[1:37:06] happens praise God I'll just keep
[1:37:08] working praise God
[1:37:09] because Paul made tents and then he
[1:37:11] wrote the Bible at the same time he's a
[1:37:13] tent maker and he wrote the Bible
[1:37:15] he worked and then he preached he worked
[1:37:17] and then he wrote
[1:37:19] so we do whatever God's called us to do
[1:37:23] now go to Genesis 14 20. where did Ty
[1:37:26] start brother Jesse
[1:37:28] Ty started with the father of Faith
[1:37:30] Abraham
[1:37:32] [Music]
[1:37:33] who is the first first High pair it was
[1:37:36] Abraham
[1:37:38] Genesis 14 20.
[1:37:50] Genesis 14 20. Hallelujah
[1:37:57] [Music]
[1:37:59] 14 20.
[1:38:02] I'm looking for a verse here so bear
[1:38:04] with me here
[1:38:06] a little thought going to my mind
[1:38:14] all right 14 20.
[1:38:18] now let me know this story
[1:38:19] [Music]
[1:38:21] Abraham's fighting five Gentile Kings
[1:38:26] can you imagine going he's only got
[1:38:28] servants maybe I think I think the Bible
[1:38:30] said like around 312 or something you
[1:38:33] only got 312 servants and he's got to go
[1:38:35] fight five Kings
[1:38:37] does he have any chance to win this
[1:38:39] battle there's no chance no chance
[1:38:41] yet God gives him favor and then he
[1:38:44] whips five Kings
[1:38:47] on the way coming back he meets God but
[1:38:51] God's got a body on and his name is
[1:38:53] Melchizedek amen and the Bible says in
[1:38:56] Hebrews 7 Melchizedek has no father no
[1:38:59] mother no beginning of days nor end of
[1:39:01] life it was God Almighty in other words
[1:39:04] he met he met his captain he met the
[1:39:07] possessor of heavens and earth he met
[1:39:09] the god of the universe because the god
[1:39:11] of the universe helped him defeat those
[1:39:12] five armies praise God
[1:39:15] and on the way back he recognized I Just
[1:39:17] Whipped five kingdoms on the way back he
[1:39:19] meets Melchizedek
[1:39:21] and brother Irvin would read uh 1420
[1:39:23] brother
[1:39:25] blessed be the most high God which has
[1:39:28] delivered the enemies into thy hand and
[1:39:30] he gave him
[1:39:32] can you picture he just whipped five
[1:39:34] Kings and he comes there and says Lord
[1:39:37] thank you for blessing me because of all
[1:39:40] that you've given me you've helped me
[1:39:41] defeat enemies I should not be able to
[1:39:43] defeat you help me have income I
[1:39:46] shouldn't have been able to get on my
[1:39:47] own
[1:39:49] because you blessed me I'm going to give
[1:39:51] you a tenth of everything you gave me
[1:39:55] this is the friend of God hallelujah
[1:39:58] Abraham is called the friend
[1:40:01] nothing
[1:40:02] gives it to me amen that's right
[1:40:05] I know victories unless God fights for
[1:40:07] me praise God
[1:40:09] and everything that God gives me I'll
[1:40:11] give him back ten percent praise God
[1:40:14] so where did Ty start brother Jesse in
[1:40:16] the law no before the law before Moses
[1:40:20] Tai started from us the Abraham the
[1:40:23] father of our faith and we're the
[1:40:24] children of Abraham
[1:40:26] oh Lord praise God
[1:40:30] so now you need to make plans by God's
[1:40:32] grace
[1:40:34] you pay a 10 of your off or 10 of your
[1:40:37] income to the church
[1:40:39] and you give offerings whatever you can
[1:40:41] afford you can do little whatever
[1:40:42] whatever you want
[1:40:44] one time I calculated I think I was
[1:40:45] given 18 percent
[1:40:47] some people would give 20 you know
[1:40:48] whatever
[1:40:49] I don't know what I'm at now I haven't
[1:40:50] looked for a little bit
[1:40:52] but you give whatever you can afford and
[1:40:55] then that allows the church to have
[1:40:56] funds to eventually maybe build a
[1:40:58] building
[1:40:59] or not doesn't matter
[1:41:02] you can use that to support a pastor
[1:41:05] right
[1:41:07] or you can use it for whatever God leads
[1:41:08] maybe missionary work send missionaries
[1:41:11] to the rest of the Amisha I haven't
[1:41:12] heard the message
[1:41:13] and exactly right wouldn't that be
[1:41:15] awesome
[1:41:18] pay for their hotels pay for their food
[1:41:19] their gas maybe buy a church van for the
[1:41:22] set send missionary send out preachers
[1:41:24] to the Amish who've never had a chance
[1:41:26] to hear it like you got to hear it
[1:41:27] praise God
[1:41:28] Hallelujah
[1:41:30] oh it's beautiful
[1:41:32] whatever God puts on your heart
[1:41:34] okay
[1:41:40] now I'm just I'm just hitting there's a
[1:41:42] lot more scriptures on all these topics
[1:41:44] each each topic I preached I could
[1:41:46] probably read the whole sermon on it
[1:41:48] but I felt led to lay the foundational
[1:41:50] Bible truth this morning amen so you can
[1:41:53] have a vision of where God is taking you
[1:41:56] amen do you see where God's taking you
[1:41:57] now
[1:41:58] it's a house of love it's a body of
[1:42:01] Jesus Christ that strengthens meets more
[1:42:03] and more
[1:42:04] and helps each other along the way loves
[1:42:05] each other through all life's troubles
[1:42:07] and pains and sorrows and victories amen
[1:42:09] amen
[1:42:11] the preaching builds you up strengthens
[1:42:14] you gives you Faith and Hope the Bible
[1:42:16] said how can it be here except they it's
[1:42:18] not a preacher and the Bible said faith
[1:42:19] comes by hearing hearing by the word of
[1:42:21] God amen amen
[1:42:27] now I want to close with this
[1:42:31] I want to close by saying one more thing
[1:42:34] about legalism as we talked about
[1:42:36] the different ones I've talked with
[1:42:38] about
[1:42:39] is that legalism is motivated by fear
[1:42:44] but Christianity is motivated by faith
[1:42:47] and love
[1:42:49] and so when people under uh fear they
[1:42:52] don't they're not free to worship God
[1:42:54] like they ought to no no right
[1:42:58] and so I I was under fear as well when I
[1:43:01] first got saved
[1:43:02] I was still I was thankful I was so
[1:43:04] happy to be saved uh but I had trouble
[1:43:07] worshiping God I'm trying to find this
[1:43:09] verse here
[1:43:13] like I was uncomfortable
[1:43:15] worshiping God
[1:43:17] like I like I like how many likes to
[1:43:19] sing to Jesus I really like the songs
[1:43:22] I love the song service
[1:43:24] but when I first got to say brother
[1:43:25] Urban this is all I could do I would
[1:43:26] look is anybody else lifting their hands
[1:43:28] if not I'm not going to but if somebody
[1:43:30] lift their hands I'll lift my hands a
[1:43:32] little bit now look at me now I scream
[1:43:34] and shout and dance around here I punch
[1:43:36] things I
[1:43:38] do all kinds of stuff
[1:43:39] because I'm free amen that's right
[1:43:42] before I was like
[1:43:44] anybody looking at me
[1:43:48] and pretty soon
[1:43:51] pretty soon I can start raising my hand
[1:43:58] pretty soon I could say
[1:43:59] amen
[1:44:01] to the preacher
[1:44:04] praise God
[1:44:08] after a while that I could start
[1:44:10] stomping my foot a little bit
[1:44:14] a little while later and I could clap
[1:44:16] and stuff
[1:44:19] and pretty soon I can start raising my
[1:44:21] hands and raising the Lord
[1:44:23] and now I'm just as free as a bird amen
[1:44:27] I'm not caged up
[1:44:29] I'm free to worship god brother Adam
[1:44:32] said I want the holy ghost from the top
[1:44:34] of my head to the souls of my feet amen
[1:44:37] hallelujah
[1:44:39] religion in your head he said
[1:44:43] he said get religion in your feet he
[1:44:45] said get religion all over you amen oh
[1:44:48] Hallelujah
[1:44:50] isn't that the Bible
[1:44:55] doesn't second uh Samuel 6 14.
[1:44:58] say when David brought the ark back to
[1:45:02] Jerusalem Church he was bringing it back
[1:45:04] to melchizedek's home City
[1:45:07] oh Hallelujah
[1:45:09] what is God City Jerusalem
[1:45:12] [Music]
[1:45:13] and David sees wow God's presence is
[1:45:17] getting in God's city to live with God's
[1:45:19] people amen
[1:45:20] oh no he said now he said I'll I don't
[1:45:24] want to hit my head on this he said but
[1:45:25] now I can leave for joy
[1:45:28] right the Bible says he lead with all of
[1:45:31] his mind
[1:45:32] that's what the Bible says
[1:45:35] with all of his heart he worship God he
[1:45:37] praise God you dance around and he
[1:45:40] praise God because the word was getting
[1:45:43] in position and church that's what's
[1:45:45] happening in your midst the word of God
[1:45:47] is getting you in position praise God
[1:45:52] to be a real Church of the Living God
[1:45:55] amen not a legal it's his church and not
[1:45:57] a church of lasciviousness but a church
[1:45:59] based upon the order of the word of God
[1:46:03] how many believe that
[1:46:08] on the day of Pentecost brother Adam
[1:46:09] said they look like a bunch of drunk
[1:46:11] people out there
[1:46:13] brother man said they got so filled with
[1:46:16] the Holy Spirit they had to leave the
[1:46:17] upper room he said they went down the
[1:46:19] steps and they went praising God saying
[1:46:21] Jesus is the Messiah Jesus has risen
[1:46:23] from the dead he said they declared the
[1:46:25] wonderful works of God
[1:46:27] and they glorified God
[1:46:30] and everybody mocked him and said
[1:46:31] they're drunk and no Peter says he said
[1:46:34] this is that which job spoken of God is
[1:46:37] pouring out his spirit and church that's
[1:46:39] what God wants to do here he wants to
[1:46:41] pour out of the spirit upon his children
[1:46:42] praise God
[1:46:44] hallelujah praise God
[1:46:47] amen amen
[1:46:49] he wants you to be free
[1:46:51] the Bible says in Lamentations when you
[1:46:54] sin you lose your dance
[1:46:58] that's what the Bible says I don't have
[1:47:00] it right in front of me but I preach
[1:47:01] when brother our lady was there in the
[1:47:03] Levi
[1:47:04] when you when you sin you can no longer
[1:47:06] dance and praise God well the first
[1:47:08] thing is we got to get a dance praise
[1:47:09] God we actually have to have a dance
[1:47:11] before we can lose a dance
[1:47:14] and brother Brandon says the first time
[1:47:17] he danced with him when he was a pastor
[1:47:19] he preached for four and a half hours on
[1:47:21] the on the second coming on New Year's
[1:47:23] Eve 1932.
[1:47:26] he sat down for a break and he said some
[1:47:28] sisters got up and started playing
[1:47:30] there's going to be a meeting in the air
[1:47:35] in that sweet sweet bye and bye brother
[1:47:39] said he he said he was so mad he said
[1:47:42] this is horrible they're making my
[1:47:44] tabernacle into a bar room
[1:47:48] I got the quotes
[1:47:49] he said this is terrible how awful this
[1:47:52] he said this is horrible
[1:47:55] they kept dancing and he said well where
[1:47:57] do they get that in the Bible
[1:48:00] is that in the Bible I love how God does
[1:48:02] it
[1:48:04] we might have an evil spirit right we
[1:48:06] might have the wrong attitude but then
[1:48:07] God will he'll help us and say well
[1:48:09] let's look in the Bible and see if
[1:48:11] that's in the Bible
[1:48:13] aren't you glad he doesn't leave you in
[1:48:14] that sinful condition
[1:48:17] called it the seat of the scornful
[1:48:20] God doesn't let you be the Michael up
[1:48:22] there saying oh how glorious is David
[1:48:24] you're making fun of the people actually
[1:48:27] worshiping God doesn't leave you up
[1:48:28] there God lets you become a part of the
[1:48:31] worship amen
[1:48:33] everyone said pretty serious though oh
[1:48:35] that's right the first person that
[1:48:37] danced was Miriam
[1:48:40] that's a good name sister
[1:48:43] that's right and why do they dance
[1:48:44] because they just got the victory
[1:48:47] all their task Masters had drowned in
[1:48:51] the Red Sea
[1:48:53] amen the evil men and the slave drivers
[1:48:55] that used to beat them and their
[1:48:58] children and their husbands and their
[1:48:59] wives all the old slave masters had now
[1:49:02] drowned
[1:49:04] and the Bible said Moses started singing
[1:49:06] the spirit and Miriam an 85 year old
[1:49:09] woman picked up a tambourine and she
[1:49:11] said come on Sisters Let's Dance and
[1:49:13] praise the Lord amen if an 85 year old
[1:49:16] woman can dance for God what can we do
[1:49:18] praise God
[1:49:21] and don't you know the Red Sea is a
[1:49:24] foreshadowing of your baptism
[1:49:27] that's right when they went to the Red
[1:49:29] Sea the Bible said that's just like your
[1:49:31] baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:49:34] Christ amen
[1:49:36] oh hallelujah thank God Amen
[1:49:42] then brother and thought yeah that's
[1:49:43] right David danced before the Lord too
[1:49:45] when the ark was coming in
[1:49:48] he said the only problem with me is I
[1:49:51] just don't have enough victory
[1:49:54] brother Graham said did you ever get
[1:49:55] that much Victory to dance amen
[1:49:58] hallelujah
[1:50:01] how many got that Victory to dance amen
[1:50:03] I got it I don't cuss anymore I don't
[1:50:06] smoke anymore I don't watch dirty things
[1:50:09] anymore I don't look at dirty magazines
[1:50:12] anymore I got the victory all those all
[1:50:15] those demons I used to be uh a living
[1:50:17] for they're all cast out praise God now
[1:50:20] I'm free Hallelujah I got the victory I
[1:50:23] can dance and sing because Jesus set me
[1:50:26] free
[1:50:27] amen
[1:50:30] all of my sins are in the sand
[1:50:33] forgetfulness he whom the son set free
[1:50:36] is free indeed Hallelujah
[1:50:42] hey man brothers and the trouble is I
[1:50:44] just don't have enough victory
[1:50:47] and they said okay I'll start tapping my
[1:50:50] foot
[1:50:51] there's going to be
[1:50:54] some of us just need to learn how to tap
[1:50:55] our feet
[1:50:56] that'll be a good start
[1:51:05] I'm going to meet you greet you over
[1:51:09] there in that home beyond the sky
[1:51:13] remember I said before I knew it I was
[1:51:16] out there dancing with the sister
[1:51:18] praising God he said I sure didn't look
[1:51:20] very good he said but I felt great
[1:51:26] he said I didn't look really good I
[1:51:29] probably looked awful he said but I felt
[1:51:31] so much better afterwards why because he
[1:51:33] had the victory praise God Amen that's
[1:51:36] right hey man
[1:51:38] and the Bible said there's a time to
[1:51:40] mourn and there's a time to what
[1:51:45] amen that's right there's times your
[1:51:46] life when God it's okay to mourn God
[1:51:49] understands you've got you've lost a
[1:51:50] loved one or something
[1:51:52] it's more but if you're not in that
[1:51:54] morning season Well church then what
[1:51:55] what season are you in
[1:51:57] what's the opposite of mourning
[1:52:02] we're in a season of Dance at our church
[1:52:03] right now we've been dancing
[1:52:05] almost every service
[1:52:07] we're in the season of it the first time
[1:52:10] we danced my daughters come home they're
[1:52:11] like daddy that's the greatest Services
[1:52:13] we've ever had
[1:52:16] because now they're no longer like
[1:52:19] now they're like oh Jesus loves me
[1:52:21] he forgave me he filled me with the Holy
[1:52:24] Ghost I can praise God and church you've
[1:52:27] got Bible permission to dance for Jesus
[1:52:29] amen Psalm 149 verse 3 says let them
[1:52:35] praise the Lord in the dance Hallelujah
[1:52:38] that word let means Allah you should
[1:52:41] allow them to praise God why when
[1:52:44] anybody want to stop the dance it's
[1:52:45] Satan Satan wants to stop the dance say
[1:52:48] he wants to stop the victory but God
[1:52:50] said I love him to praise God with the
[1:52:53] dance Hallelujah
[1:52:54] that's right
[1:52:56] and he says it again the next chapter
[1:52:59] it's psalm 150.
[1:53:01] verse 4.
[1:53:03] praise His name in the dance
[1:53:07] Hallelujah
[1:53:08] let everything that hath breath praise
[1:53:11] the Lord amen
[1:53:13] amen I know church I know you're not
[1:53:15] most people aren't going to be able to
[1:53:16] accept this right now but I'm planting
[1:53:18] for the future
[1:53:19] because when I come first in the message
[1:53:21] I couldn't dance I was like no way
[1:53:23] everyone's gonna be looking at me
[1:53:25] now I'm like I don't care when anybody
[1:53:26] looks at that I know God's looking at me
[1:53:28] praise God Amen because that's what
[1:53:31] David said even told his wife Michael I
[1:53:33] wasn't dancing for you I was dancing
[1:53:36] before God and
[1:53:38] Hallelujah
[1:53:40] and then he said if you didn't like that
[1:53:42] wait till you see what I'm gonna do next

[1:53:52] what I got next hey man oh he tore it up
[1:53:54] he was dancing praising God why church
