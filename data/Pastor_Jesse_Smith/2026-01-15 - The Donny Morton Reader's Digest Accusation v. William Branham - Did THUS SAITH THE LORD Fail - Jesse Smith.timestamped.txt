[0:03] there. They took me back and showed me
[0:04] when this Donnie Martin, how many rate
[0:06] readers digest when Mles are turned down
[0:08] and everything and to come out there to
[0:10] California down out of Canada, the Lord
[0:12] healing made him well.
[0:14] &gt;&gt; Greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:16] of the [music] Lord Jesus Christ. The
[0:18] purpose of this video is to give a
[0:20] response about the questions surrounding
[0:22] the Donnie Morton [music] story. as
[0:25] brother Brandham has been accused of
[0:28] having a thus sayith the Lord that
[0:30] failed. So this is a question I've got
[0:32] numerous times over the years. It's a
[0:35] fair question of course and obviously I
[0:38] don't think a thus sayith the Lord from
[0:40] brother Brandham failed [music]
[0:42] because I have seven thus sayith the
[0:44] Lord prophecies from William Brandham
[0:47] God's true [music] prophet that have
[0:49] come to pass already. And this video
[0:51] then will give my honest thoughts on
[0:53] what's been a confusing story to me for
[0:57] a couple years here. This video then is
[1:00] a defense of God's prophet, [music]
[1:02] Brother William Brham, as a true genuine
[1:04] Bible-based prophet of God who fulfilled
[1:07] numerous scriptures such as Revelation
[1:08] 10:7, finishing the mystery of God,
[1:11] Malachi 45:5 and 6, turning our hearts
[1:13] back to the apostolic fathers, Luke
[1:15] 17:30,
[1:17] the son of man being revealed, a son of
[1:19] man revealing the son of man, the
[1:22] prophetic gift in brother Ram's life,
[1:25] discerning the thoughts intents of the
[1:26] heart as the Lord Jesus did Matthew
[1:29] 17:11, Elijah coming and restoring all
[1:31] things, of course, restoring the book of
[1:34] Acts and the Apostolic Faith. I preached
[1:37] Brother Am's Bible Revelation since
[1:39] 2004. Written two books about his
[1:41] ministry, built my entire life and
[1:44] ministry on the Bible teachings and
[1:46] Bible revelations of God's prophet,
[1:49] Brother William Brandham. So, here's the
[1:51] outline, friends, for the video. We'll
[1:53] look at important points. Second, we'll
[1:55] look at the character of Brother
[1:56] Brandham. Third, we'll look at the
[1:58] character of some of Brother Ram's
[1:59] accusers.
[2:01] Fourth, we'll look at the accusation.
[2:03] And then fifth, we'll look at the
[2:05] possible explanations. And which
[2:06] explanation I think is most plausible.
[2:09] So, let's begin with important points.
[2:12] The most important point, I think, is
[2:13] that we do not have the original
[2:16] official thus sayith the Lord statement
[2:18] about Donnie Morton's healing on tape.
[2:21] If there was such a statement, this
[2:23] means that brother Ram was trying to
[2:26] remember the prophecy to the best of his
[2:28] ability, if it was indeed spoken about
[2:31] little Donnie Morton. This could be
[2:33] similar to the prophecies about the
[2:35] seven major visions of 1933 because they
[2:37] were not recorded in 1933 and therefore
[2:40] brother was trying his best to recall
[2:42] them. A second important point is that
[2:45] it seems Brother M didn't understand the
[2:48] Reader Digest article completely because
[2:51] the article never says Donnie had a
[2:53] miracle. It says the miracle was that
[2:57] Donniey's sickness increased awareness
[2:59] of a new brain surgery procedure that
[3:01] could save the lives of sick children in
[3:04] the future. I'm going to quote the
[3:06] Reader Digest article. quote, "The
[3:08] personal miracle Morton sought that his
[3:11] child's life be saved was denied, but
[3:14] out of his search for it, came another
[3:16] miracle." End quote.
[3:19] So, we don't have the official thus
[3:21] sayith the Lord on Donnie Morton on
[3:22] tape. And it seems Brother Bill Ram
[3:24] didn't quite understand the full
[3:26] article. And that's also true because
[3:29] Voice of God has never recognized this
[3:31] either. They posted the full article of
[3:34] Donnie Morton on their website and just
[3:36] simply said, "Get tissues ready." So,
[3:39] even Voice of God doesn't seem to
[3:41] understand the article. Donnie Morton
[3:43] never got the miracle. And then third,
[3:46] most preachers have never recognized
[3:48] that the article doesn't say Donnie had
[3:52] his healing miracle either. I'm not
[3:54] trying to bash preachers or Voice of God
[3:56] recordings. I'm just making important
[3:58] points and observations. Very few people
[4:01] seem to actually read the article.
[4:04] Another important point is that the
[4:05] Reader's Digest article never says,
[4:07] "Thus sayeth the Lord, that Donnie would
[4:09] be made well." And this connects to the
[4:12] Carol Ruth Strubler story from 1955,
[4:15] which I made a video about, I believe
[4:16] last year, if I'm not mistaken, or the
[4:18] year before, from 1955 when Brother
[4:20] Random expected her to be healed, but it
[4:22] seems she passed away. If the Reader
[4:25] Digest article is right, then Brother
[4:26] Ram was just trying to be positive, just
[4:28] trying to give hope. And that seems like
[4:30] that's where brother Brandham was at in
[4:32] his healing ministry. Remember, if you
[4:34] listen to Works as Faith Express 1965,
[4:37] Brother Ram said he grew in his
[4:39] understanding of divine healing. I'd
[4:41] like to make a video about that in the
[4:42] future, Lord willing. He grew so much
[4:44] about divine healing. At the beginning
[4:46] of his ministry, Brother Ram would say
[4:48] any positive attitude toward a promise
[4:50] of God would bring it to pass. And he
[4:52] was speaking about divine healing. But
[4:54] then at the end of his ministry, he
[4:56] learned he had to wait on God in order
[4:58] to know the Lord's will for certain
[5:01] situations, such as with Sister Stad's
[5:04] baby who died in Germany. And they were
[5:06] willing to fly Brother Brandham to
[5:07] Germany to pray for the dead baby. But
[5:09] brother waited on a direct cut decision
[5:12] from God. And God said, "No, this is my
[5:15] hand. Bury the baby."
[5:17] So for Sister Stad, it didn't matter how
[5:20] positive in her mind she was toward the
[5:23] promise of God for raising the dead. God
[5:25] does raise the dead, but she had to look
[5:27] at the will of God for her life. And the
[5:29] will of God for her life was for God to
[5:31] take the baby home. And therefore, that
[5:34] shows Brother Ram grew in his
[5:35] understanding on divine healing. If you
[5:38] notice towards the end of his ministry,
[5:39] he didn't use that phrase very often
[5:40] after 1963. any positive attitude toward
[5:44] a promise of God would bring it to pass.
[5:46] And that's one point that the video will
[5:48] make, Lord willing, in the future. And
[5:50] the final point I want to make is that
[5:52] one of the accusers of Brother Brandham
[5:54] claims to have spoken to Donnie Morton's
[5:56] family member who said Donnie Morton was
[5:59] never healed. And if Donniey's parents
[6:02] would have known, Brother Brandham
[6:03] claimed Donnie was healed, they would
[6:04] have spoke up about it. Now, let's move
[6:07] on to the character of Brother William
[6:09] Brandham.
[6:11] Brother William Brandham had holy ghost
[6:14] impeccable character. His life was free
[6:16] from scandals unlike the many false
[6:19] teachers and false prophets we see today
[6:21] such as Benny Hinn, Todd White, Steve
[6:23] Lawson, TD Jake, Philip Yansy, Robbie
[6:26] Zachcharias, and so many more men caught
[6:30] up in disgraceful sin and abomination.
[6:34] Brother Ram is the most faithful Bible
[6:36] teacher and Bible prophet I've ever
[6:38] heard. He meets all the qualifications
[6:40] to be a prophet. He has seven thus
[6:42] sayith the Lords that came to pass.
[6:44] Fulfilling Deuteronomy 18 19-22.
[6:48] He revealed the secrets of the Bible.
[6:50] Fulfilling Amos 3:7. He lived a godly
[6:54] life with good fruits, fulfilling 1
[6:56] Corinthians 9 15-27 and Matthew 7:15-23.
[7:01] He had much fruit to his ministry such
[7:03] as souls one. He taught the word in its
[7:06] purity, and he had supernatural works,
[7:09] dreams, and visions, proving God spoke
[7:11] to him. I wrote an entire chapter about
[7:14] Brother Ram's ministry in my 2021 book,
[7:16] The 12 New Testament Mysteries revealed.
[7:19] You can listen to that here on YouTube.
[7:21] It shows all the Bible verses Brother
[7:23] Ram fulfilled, how he had, thus sayeth
[7:26] the Lord, how he had impeccable
[7:27] Christian character.
[7:29] One thing I'd just like to mention is
[7:31] that on many of Brother Ram's sermons,
[7:33] he spends lots of time praying for the
[7:35] sick in the prayer lines, joyfully
[7:38] singing to Jesus at the end of sermons,
[7:40] sometimes in tears, pleading with
[7:42] sinners to repent and be baptized in the
[7:44] name of Jesus Christ, and then praying
[7:46] for them to be baptized with the Holy
[7:48] Ghost in their souls. Here we see the
[7:51] true character of a humble servant of
[7:54] God.
[7:55] Let's move on to the character of some
[7:57] of the accusers of brother Brandham.
[8:00] Friends, some, not all, of Brother Ram's
[8:02] accusers are deep in debauchery and sin.
[8:07] For example, some of them support
[8:08] non-binary relationships. That's what
[8:10] they say on their podcasts. Some of them
[8:12] admit to watching filthy Hollywood
[8:14] movies that use cuss words, have sex
[8:17] scenes, murders, and more. Some of them
[8:19] describe their podcast and videos about
[8:22] Brother Brandham as being juicy, which
[8:23] is gossip-like terminology. They talk
[8:26] about how they enjoy vampires and
[8:28] vampire movies, Halloween, rock and
[8:31] roll, all of these obvious sins, and yet
[8:35] they're the ones attacking a man who
[8:37] pleaded with sinners to repent, prayed
[8:39] for their sicknesses, pleaded with them
[8:42] to be baptized in water in the name of
[8:44] the Lord Jesus Christ, and be filled
[8:46] with the Holy Ghost. On top of all that,
[8:48] they have all these false Bible
[8:50] doctrines such as there's only one work
[8:51] of grace, which is so silly to believe
[8:54] that children receive the baptism of the
[8:56] Holy Ghost as soon as they repent. Let's
[8:58] say they're five or six years old. They
[9:00] say a scripted sinner's prayer and then
[9:02] they're filled with the Holy Ghost. By
[9:03] their fruits, they're known. So, they
[9:06] deny the three works of grace, which is
[9:07] a sin. They say women can cut their hair
[9:10] despite Paul forbidding it in 1
[9:12] Corinthians 11. They say God is three
[9:15] persons, which adds to the Bible without
[9:17] any scripture that says God's three
[9:19] persons. And then they jump to all these
[9:21] false conclusions. They say Brother
[9:24] Brandham plagiarized the seven seals,
[9:26] which I've already shown to be false.
[9:28] There's over 38 differences between
[9:29] Brother Brandham's revelation on the
[9:31] seven seals versus Clarence Larkin and
[9:34] Charles Tase Russell's teachings. And
[9:36] they won't even address one of those 38
[9:39] differences in any of their videos or
[9:41] podcasts. To me, that's cowardly. They
[9:44] falsely accused Brother Brandham of
[9:45] being a racist. Brother Brandham was
[9:48] raised to be racist, but the Holy Ghost
[9:50] changed his heart. And I have a video
[9:52] about that as well. The false racism
[9:55] accusation if you'd like to watch that.
[9:58] They falsely say that he influenced Jim
[10:01] Jones to do what he did in Guyana.
[10:03] That's a bunch of nonsense. I have
[10:05] videos about that. proving that Jim
[10:07] Jones rejected the Bible became an
[10:11] awful, wicked, sexual deviant cult
[10:13] leader. Jim Jones did not like Brother
[10:16] Brandham as proven by audio tape. Jim
[10:18] Jones was a cult leader who accepted
[10:22] worship. That's also on tape. Brother
[10:24] Ram never supported that. So, I'll stop
[10:26] right there, friends. But we can see the
[10:28] character of some of Brother Ram's
[10:30] accusers show corrupt fruit. By their
[10:33] fruit, they are known. Now, let's look
[10:35] at the accusation against brother
[10:38] Brandham.
[10:39] The accusation is that how could brother
[10:42] Rams thus sayith the Lord that Donnie
[10:43] would be healed fail if he was a true
[10:46] prophet of God and he gave Donnie Morton
[10:49] a thus sayith the Lord that the little
[10:50] boy would be healed then why did he die?
[10:53] That's a fair accusation. Let's look at
[10:55] some of the points in particular. The
[10:57] accusers say brother Ram said the Lord
[10:59] healed him and made him well. That's
[11:01] true. Brother Ram said that in 1960.
[11:04] Abraham, he said, quote, they took me
[11:06] back and showed me when this Donnie
[11:08] Morton, the Lord healed him, made him
[11:10] well. End quote.
[11:13] Second, they said, Brother Bram said the
[11:15] boy was wearing shoes the next day after
[11:17] he prayed for him. Brother Ram did say
[11:20] that in be not afraid it is eye in 1960.
[11:22] Quote, he went right straight from that
[11:24] meeting that night and bought Donnie his
[11:26] first pair of shoes and he wore them the
[11:28] next day. End quote.
[11:31] Third, they said, Brother Ram said, "It
[11:33] got so he could run, meet his daddy, and
[11:35] everything." That's true. Brother Ram
[11:37] said that in demonology, 1953, quote,
[11:39] "and the baby come out of it." And so
[11:41] they had the baby around here. It got so
[11:43] he could run, meet his daddy, and
[11:45] everything. End quote.
[11:47] And fourth, they say, "Brother Ram said,
[11:49] thus sayith the Lord, the boy will be
[11:51] healed." Now, I couldn't find that
[11:53] quote, but Brother Ram did say 1964, his
[11:55] unfailing words of promise. quote, and
[11:58] you've seen it in the Reader's Digest
[11:59] not long ago. Donnie Morton, the miracle
[12:01] of Donnie Morton, that child was so
[12:03] twisted and afflicted till even John
[12:05] Hopkins and Mayo brothers said, "There's
[12:07] not an earthly chance for him, but the
[12:09] Lord is thus sayeth the Lord. That was
[12:11] different." See, end quote. So, those
[12:14] are true quotes, it seems, from God's
[12:16] prophet, Brother Brandham. Now, the
[12:17] Reader Digest articles totally
[12:19] different. First, it says, "Donnie only
[12:23] began to improve slightly after the
[12:25] operation." And that's true. That's what
[12:26] the article says. The article second
[12:29] says Donnie was never able to walk or
[12:31] run. The best he was able to do was
[12:33] stretch out his arms in bed to reach for
[12:35] his parents. That's true. That's what
[12:37] the article says. And third, Donnie
[12:39] Morton died the same year and never
[12:41] fully recovered according to the
[12:42] article. That's what the article says.
[12:44] So, please read the article. If I'm
[12:46] wrong on anything, please let me know.
[12:48] But I've read the article a number of
[12:49] times. Now, before moving to the final
[12:52] section, I want to read this quote from
[12:54] Demonology 1953. This is really
[12:56] interesting. And then this is the most
[12:59] important quote on this topic because it
[13:02] shows the difference between Brother
[13:03] Bram's perspective and the Reader's
[13:05] Digest perspective. Brother Bram said,
[13:08] quote, "The daddy went back to plant his
[13:10] spring wheat or something another. Now,
[13:12] here's what the digest didn't get. See
[13:14] what didn't picture, but we had to know
[13:17] behind because if you did that, a
[13:18] hospital would bring suit against this
[13:20] paper." And there's where it would be. A
[13:22] slip up come. Somebody left a window up
[13:25] one night and throwed a draft across the
[13:27] baby and the baby taken pneumonia and
[13:29] lived about two days with the pneumonia,
[13:32] not with the disease with the pneumonia
[13:34] killed the baby. The reader's digest
[13:37] give it. Then it goes ahead and gives a
[13:40] nice good write up about the miracle was
[13:42] already performed anyhow. End quote.
[13:45] So here, brother Random says that the
[13:47] reader digest didn't tell the full truth
[13:50] of the story. So that's his perspective.
[13:52] Brother R's perspective was Donnie
[13:54] Morton was healed but while he was
[13:56] recovering in the hospital Donnie Morton
[13:58] caught pneumonia and then died of
[14:00] pneumonia not of the brain disease that
[14:02] he had. So here we see the conflict. The
[14:05] conflict is between Reader Digest
[14:07] article and Brother Ram's perspective of
[14:09] the story and what happened. So let's go
[14:12] to the final section here. Possible
[14:14] explanations.
[14:16] The only possible explanations I'm
[14:18] willing to look at are the ones that
[14:20] assume brother Brandham was a faithful,
[14:22] genuine, true prophet of God, as I
[14:24] believe and as his character
[14:25] demonstrates. Again, we have seven thus
[14:28] sayith the Lord prophecies that already
[14:29] came to pass. Brother Ram is very
[14:31] trustworthy with thus sayeth the Lord.
[14:34] Fully faithful with thus sayith the
[14:35] Lord. Now, the main point though is that
[14:37] Brother Ramb is not here to defend
[14:39] himself and due to his impeccable
[14:42] Christian character, he deserves the
[14:44] benefit of the doubt that he was
[14:46] completely accurate with thus sayeth the
[14:48] Lord. So, there's two possible
[14:50] explanations. The first is that the thus
[14:53] sayeth the Lord about Donnie Morton's
[14:55] healing was true and came to pass and
[14:58] Donnie got well as brother Ram said in
[15:00] the quotes but readers digest hid that
[15:03] and also hid that Donnie died due to a
[15:05] hospital failure and that explanation is
[15:08] based upon brother's quote from 1953 in
[15:11] demonology.
[15:13] The second possible explanation is that
[15:15] the thus sayeth the Lord about healing
[15:18] was for a different boy and not about
[15:21] Donnie. So perhaps brother Bram mixed up
[15:23] his testimonies which explains why
[15:27] Donnie died. And that would also explain
[15:30] why brother Bram did not seem to
[15:32] understand that the Reader Digest
[15:34] article never said Donnie Morton was
[15:38] fully healed
[15:40] and had a miracle.
[15:42] So, out of those two possible
[15:44] explanations,
[15:45] I personally believe that brother
[15:47] Brandham got his stories mixed up. Due
[15:49] to the discrepancies between Brother
[15:51] Bram's story and the Reader's Digest
[15:52] story, it seems to me that the thus
[15:55] sayith the Lord healing was probably for
[15:57] a different boy and not Donnie Morton
[16:00] because again, we know thus sayith the
[16:01] Lord can't fail. Thus sayith the Lord
[16:04] was accurate every time in brother Ram's
[16:06] ministry. Again, seven thus sayith the
[16:08] Lord prophecies that came to pass.
[16:09] That's just what I found. No doubt
[16:11] there's many, many more. I reached out
[16:13] to different ministers about this and
[16:15] they seem to agree that it seemed like
[16:17] brother man probably got his stories
[16:18] mixed up because again we don't have the
[16:20] original recording of the thus sayith
[16:23] the Lord healing for Donnie Morton if it
[16:25] even was for Donnie Morton. So, I base
[16:28] this explanation on all the other
[16:30] information such as Donnie Morton's
[16:32] family member. If indeed this family
[16:34] member was being honest and Donnie never
[16:37] got better, which seems very possible
[16:39] because Donnie Morton died, then it
[16:41] would seem to me like Brother Ram just
[16:43] mixed up the stories. Brother Ram's life
[16:45] was filled with so many visions, so many
[16:47] testimonies, so many stories. His body
[16:50] didn't get a lot of rest. His mind did
[16:52] not get a lot of rest either. So I think
[16:54] it's very possible that he probably just
[16:56] confused some of the stories and that
[16:58] would make sense because even the
[17:00] stories about the man from Windsor have
[17:02] a lot of different details but the point
[17:04] is the same. The power of God protected
[17:06] the prophet and then there's many other
[17:09] stories where brother forgot some
[17:11] details or exaggerated some things which
[17:13] he said he was prone to exaggerate
[17:15] because he's human. But no one should
[17:17] deny the prophetic insight that brother
[17:19] Brandham had. For example, again, seven
[17:22] thus sayith the lords that already came
[17:23] to pass which no man or woman alive
[17:26] today can claim to do that. So, brother
[17:29] Ram was accurate with thus sayith the
[17:30] Lord. Second, uh brother Ram spoke of a
[17:33] pope of the United States, a prediction
[17:36] 71 years before it happened as we saw
[17:39] last year. Praise God for that. Third,
[17:42] brother Random recognized Luke 17 as a
[17:45] prophecy about a rise of homosexuality
[17:48] in the days of the coming of the son of
[17:50] man. And that was accurate. That came to
[17:52] pass. 2015 was when the Supreme Court
[17:55] legalized homosexuality in the United
[17:57] States. So, Brother Brandham basically
[17:59] foretold that. He saw the conditions
[18:02] moving towards that, the fulfillment of
[18:04] Luke 17. And then also with Deuteronomy
[18:07] 22:5, Brother Ram warned us about men
[18:10] wanting to be women and women trying to
[18:12] be men. So, Brother Ram foresaw this
[18:14] trans movement and warned the people on
[18:17] many occasions. So, brother Ram's
[18:19] prophetic gift and insight is also
[18:22] impeccable. So, we thank God for that by
[18:24] the grace of God. So, the bottom line is
[18:27] that without brother Random here, we
[18:28] don't know for sure. Was the Reader
[18:30] Digest article accurate or not? And
[18:34] ultimately, like many of these
[18:35] accusations, this situation is Brother
[18:38] Ram's words against the words of the
[18:40] accusers. I give brother Brandham the
[18:42] benefit of the doubt because of his
[18:44] godly Christian character, his
[18:46] completely accurate prophetic gift with
[18:48] thus sayith the Lord and of course the
[18:50] gift of discernment in the prayer lines.
[18:52] So we rejoice in God sending us a
[18:54] genuine Bible-based prophet, Brother
[18:55] William Brandham.
[18:57] In closing, friends, hope this video was
[19:00] a blessing by the grace of God. I
[19:02] appreciate all the questions. As I said
[19:04] earlier, this topic has been confusing
[19:06] for me. took a lot of study, a lot of
[19:08] pondering, comparing quotes versus the
[19:11] Reader's Digest article. But we can
[19:13] clearly see Brother Brand was a genuine
[19:15] prophet of God who had the ability to
[19:17] speak with thus sayith the Lord. And it
[19:18] came to pass. And just remember friends,
[19:20] the accusers of Brother Brandon will
[19:22] always try to take us away from the word
[19:24] of God. But we must keep our eyes on the
[19:26] word of God. A lot of times they're just
[19:28] making assumptions, slandering the good
[19:31] name of God's prophet, Brother William
[19:33] Brandham, jumping to false conclusions.
[19:36] But the holy life that Brother Bram
[19:38] lived speaks for itself. God has
[19:40] vindicated him as a true prophet of God.
[19:42] And by his Christian fruits, Brother
[19:44] Brandham is known. Brother Brham's not
[19:47] here to defend himself, but we'll keep
[19:49] defending Brother Brandham as a true
[19:51] prophet of God. Friends, no doubt
[19:53] there's questions about some of the thus
[19:54] sayith the Lord statements brother
[19:55] Brandham made. But remember the brown
[19:57] bear vision I put out a few years ago. I
[19:59] go through some of the questionable
[20:01] situations. The brown bear vision was
[20:03] conditional. God did his part where
[20:05] brother Brandham failed his part. Just
[20:06] like the 10 Bible examples on the video
[20:09] of prophets disobeying thus sayith the
[20:12] Lord, yet they were still prophets of
[20:13] God. The tent vision was likely
[20:15] fulfilled during the week of March of
[20:17] 1963 when brother Randon preached the
[20:19] revelation of the seven seals. the
[20:21] municipal bridge prophecy. I believe it
[20:24] was a cover up. They admit two people
[20:26] died. It's Brother Ram's words against
[20:28] the words of the accusers. Government
[20:30] records are not thus sayith the Lord,
[20:32] just like there's no record in Egypt of
[20:34] the 2 million Jews that escaped during
[20:36] the Exodus. The African vision of
[20:38] 300,000
[20:40] was likely fulfilled in 1954. In Bombay,
[20:43] India, the mayor estimated 500,000 came.
[20:46] That was likely an exaggeration. And
[20:49] prophets can get confused with visions.
[20:51] Just like John the Baptist, he said, "Is
[20:52] this the Messiah or do we look for
[20:54] another?" Yet, he saw the vision of the
[20:56] Holy Spirit descending and remaining on
[20:58] Jesus. And the Arizona cloud from
[21:00] February 28th, 1963, twice, Brother Ram
[21:03] said, "With thus sayith the Lord by
[21:04] vision that the Lord was fixing to do
[21:07] something and that came to pass." He
[21:09] called it a snow white pyramid two
[21:11] months in advance. So that prophecy came
[21:13] to pass. But brother Ram never
[21:15] said,"I'll be under the cloud when the
[21:18] photos taken with thus sayeth the Lord."
[21:20] That point was never thus sayith the
[21:22] Lord. So the accusers are building a
[21:24] straw man argument. Let's keep our eyes
[21:27] focused on the truth of God's word. We
[21:29] thank God for 2 Chronicles 20:20.
[21:32] Believe his prophets, so shall you
[21:34] prosper. Thank God that our souls
[21:35] prosper because of the Bible revelations
[21:38] which Brother Ram taught.
[21:40] If you have any questions, concerns
[21:42] [music] or testimonies about this video,
[21:43] please contact me.
[21:46] God bless you [music] and may Jesus
[21:47] Christ be the desire of your heart.
[21:51] &gt;&gt; Very happy to be here this afternoon and
[21:53] again in defense of the gospel of Jesus
[21:56] Christ to bring the good tidings, the
[21:59] good news that Jesus raised from the
[22:01] dead, living among man today, his
[22:03] church. The same Jesus that was
[22:06] yesterday will be today and forever.
[22:09] is never fail.
