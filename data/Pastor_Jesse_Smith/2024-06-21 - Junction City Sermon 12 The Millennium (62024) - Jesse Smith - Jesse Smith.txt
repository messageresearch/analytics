TRANSCRIPT
========================================
excellent brother thank you Revelation 20 we'll read verses 1 to6 let's look at that Millennium brother brandom calls it the honeymoon for the husband Christ and his bride the church Hallelujah so it's our honeymoon with Jesus amen how you looking forward to that honeymoon hallelujah amen so so we are very much looking forward to this uh by God's grace what a promise a precious promise this is I'll read verse one now I'll read down to verse 5 and then you and I can all read verse six together but let me I'll read one through five just to go a little faster and I saw an angel come down from heaven having the key of the bottomless pit and great chain in his hand and he laid hold on the dragon that old serpent which is the devil and Satan and bound him a thousand years now just pause for a moment Satan's called four different names in in there does that mean he's four persons no he's got four titles just like God God's called father son Holy Ghost but is he three persons no he's one person that's a good verse to prove to those trinitarians right that just because you have more than one name or title doesn't mean you're more than one person Hallelujah verse three and cast him in the bottomless pit and shut him up and set a seal upon him that he should deceive the Nations no more till the Thousand Years should be fulfilled and after that he must be loosed a little season verse four now here's where you and I are brother R says this right here verse four is the Bride of the past and the bride right now whoever makes up the bride now will fulfill this verse in the Millennium so you're in this verse I'm going to show you where you are and I saw Thrones and they sat upon them see there's lots of Thrones during the Millennium and those are Thrones for the Believers the Christians and judgment was given unto them see they've got to judge now because they judged everything right on this Earth by the Holy Spirit Jesus wants them to judge during the Thousand Years hallelujah amen and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus so all the martyrs like St Paul right he was beheaded many of the saints were beheaded so those will be the people sitting on the Thrones now here's and for the word of God brother Ram tells us word of God means Old Testament in Revelation so here's where Abraham Isaac and Jacob will be in there none of them were beheaded right correct but they serve God and so God honors their faith and God makes them a ruler during the Millennium unreal that's what Jesus told the Pharisees he said he said you will not sit with Abraham Isaac and Jacob in the Regeneration because you failed to recognize me the word hallelujah amen see there it is now here's where you and I now next and thank God for the and because we've not been beheaded and we're not Old Testament and which had not worshiped the Beast aren't you glad that you're not a part of the Beast system amen denominations right trinitarianism all those things we did not worship the Beast we did not bow a knee to the Beast system we're not Roman Catholics and we're not denominational sisters or Daughters of the Roman Catholic Church Hallelujah so that's where you are neither his image brother Ram said that's a World Council of churches or the United churches Protestants neither had received his Mark upon their foreheads brother Ram said uh that's their Doctrine you didn't take their Doctrine their Trinity Dogma right and their sprink babies and everything that they do and and uh their trans transubstantiation turning the bread and wine into the literal body and blood of Jesus you didn't take their Mark in your forehead right or in their hands and brother R said that's doing the will of the Beast Church doing what they want you to do you don't take their Mark here or here you don't do what they tell you to do you've come out of those churches hallelujah amen and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years so look live you get to live a thousand years and Reign that means have dominion or Rule and you've got a throne unreal now I know it's hard it's hard to think right sisters it's hard to think Jesus has a throne for you but it's the word of God you'll sit with your husband hallelujah amen verse five but the rest of the dead now this is foolish virgin Sinners make Believers the rest of the Dead live not again till the thousand years were finished this is the first resurrection and we'll show that in just a moment now let's all read verse six ready 1 2 3 blessed and holy is he that hath part in the First Resurrection on such the second death hath no power but they shall be Priests of God and of Christ and shall reign with him a thousand years may God add his Blessing to reading of his word you can be seated praise God sorry I got a little itch there so I think this is really nice I really appreciate brother Chad God bless him amen met him the one time when we baptized y'all that's the only time I've ever met brother Chad I've just you know we never pass Cross or our P never crossed that's okay but they'll cross in heaven Hallelujah so I just want I'll do a timeline like he did uh I thought that was really nice it's not very straight I'm kind of a teacher I kind of got to be a little straighter than that don't I now go a little straighter there by God's grace all right go now let's just list the the events now if you want to know brother rand's teaching on the order of events you have to listen to questions and answers 1964 there's four sermons uh two weeks in a row he does a morning evening morning evening in August of 64 and in one of those I don't know I don't remember which one I got in my notes he goes through the order of all the events okay so we'll just start here with the order uh I kind of like to show you uh a little bit of of everything here uh let's just say uh this is a Jew and this is the law right and then I like how brother Chad grew drew that Red Cross aren't you how many appreciate the bloodline Hallelujah brother brother said he preached on The Blood Line Hallelujah so now of course there was time before this right we know there's time before that but I just want to show you God dealt with Israel right but then he Jesus said I must go get other sheep of a different fold and make one fold right so now since then we have the church ages so this is Gentile Church age this is very familiar now there's there's scriptures for all this I have videos on all these things uh just laying it out through the Bible now I want to write down here Luke 2124 says uh Israel oops Israel be trotten down to the Gentiles uh until the time of the Gentiles be fulfilled so another name for the Gentile Church ages is times of the Gentiles all right now after that uh I just use blue blue sky so after that we have the Rapture I'll just call that the Rapture okay and brother random says this is the wedding ceremony so I'm going to put ceremony because it's a type how many remember back in January when I preached on uh the bride the bride of Christ The Mystery of the bride of Christ remember that it's all through the Bible Jesus is the bridegroom but he's got a bride Hallelujah and his bride has made herself ready Hallelujah Revelation 19 now here's what I want to look at just tonight here let's look at now the Trib this is called the Great Tribulation because uh Daniel calls it the greatest tribulation I'll just write great Tri now whether you believe it's three and a half or seven brother Ram says both so brother Ram's learning right I believe it's seven most people believe it's three and a half I'm just different you know I'm just I'm just different okay I is you I I don't know why I can't agree with everybody all the time but I just the way I see it I try to see it the best I can but you have the Great Tribulation there now there you have the two witnesses uh I'll just write two witnesses down here that's Moses and Elijah or brother Ram says it's two people Anointed with the spirit of Moses and Elijah okay that's Revelation uh let's see that' be Revelation 11 okay all right now after that you got uh I guess I could do another uh so I guess here during this time while they're in the Great Tribulation now the bride goes to the wedding supper so like the the wedding Feast am okay and then she comes down that's for that's called the battle of Armageddon so I'm going to put battle now it's a really short period here but I'm just going to put do a separate block here battle I'll just put arm again in here sideways arm battle okay and that's in Revelation uh 19 it's 11 to the end I can't remember the last verse there okay all right now after the battle of armagedon now is what we're going to get to today it's the Millennium thousand years of no war right thousand years of peace right so this is what we're going to look at today by God's grace so just give you a little background here now brother R also calls it the day of the Lord he calls it the honeymoon but the Bible definition is the day of the Lord okay so I'll write that the day of the Lord and you'll see that all through the scripture the day of the Lord the Millennium remember Satan Satan uh actually is cast down here I'll just draw a little line here want to do a green one here from the devil Satan is bound up Satan is in a bottomless pit we read that here today uh pit I'll just put pit but then he comes back here at the end right all right so here we have the ceremony wedding supper and here we have the honeymoon this is the Wiest it's ever been isn't it hallelujah usually I'm yelling and screaming by now all right so everybody see that by God's grace we want to focus on this now if you know your Bible real well or as you're learning you'll eventually learn here then the next thing Satan comes up uh for the Battle of go and Magog so I'll put it like this and I'll just put Gog and Magog and that just means uh a section in Israel where they're going to fight uh in Ezekiel though it means Russia and China just so you know G and Magog in Ezekiel is Russia and China so you know that brother T brother teaches that he says Russia is go and Magog but it's Russia and China that come against Israel uh at the end of the Great Tribulation period so there's a lot in here there's a lot of Prophecy in here and I can't hit all of it okay so Gog and Magog just do real small okay and at that point Satan at the end of that Satan is cast into the Lake of Fire so I'll just put a fire down here okay and then the white and after that we have the great white Throne judgment I'll just say white throne and that's where everyone every the Bible said even death and hell will deliver everything up to be judged death and Hell it's almost like they have some type of it's like they're almost like an individual person right we say the angel the of death the death angel right it's almost like they have their their own power death and Hell deliver up every soul to the white throne and then Jesus separates them as sheep and goats but the Bible also said we'll sit with Jesus on the throne and judge there as well remember Jesus said the queen of the sh South she'll judge all those Pharisees because she crossed the desert to hear Solomon but Jesus said a greater than Solomon is here so friends your lives you know your lives what what you've overcome your life will judge others who fail to overcome where you overcame Hallelujah so see you must overcome today during your lifetime you must like our I like what our brother said now let's see what Christ is doing right now you know what he's doing right now he's getting preeminence in you and I hallelujah amen he's helping us overcome he's helping us Reign Over sin hallelujah amen so white Throne is where everyone separated uh and then the last thing uh is the earth I'll just draw Earth here the last thing is the New Jerusalem coming down uh from God that's my best pyramid there not not much of an artist right New Jerusalem okay and you know that's revelation 22 and Revelation 21 by God's grace now I'll be writing on here as we go through the scripture if you have your Bible handy we'll try to hit the highlights here like I said I could probably teach two hours straight on this and still not get done I don't want to do that Hallelujah I want to respect your night and some of you labored out outside all day in the hot sun so God bless you all for your love and your Devotion to the the calling of God on your life amen okay so uh we're just going to go fast here uh Daniel 9:24 says 7 weeks were given to uh Israel and there were six purposes okay the fourth purpose was to bring in Everlasting righteousness seal up the vision of the most holy and to anoint the most holy so those three ones at the end are all about the Millennium so the Millennium brings in Everlasting righteousness so I'm going to write Daniel 9:24 and it anoints the most holy [Music] I love what brother brand says during the Millennium a millennial Temple will be built oh that's right and you need to see it it's in uh Ezekiel brother says Ezekiel 40 it's chapters 40 to 48 there are eight chapters that talk about this new Temple that's going to be built during the Millennium and it's going to be right there there in Jerusalem Hallelujah uh it's 750 ft long so brother irin do you know about how many feet to your barn over there do you any idea how many feet out there to your Red Barn probably 300 300 okay so double that and a little more that's just one side of that Ezekiel Temple the millennial Temple Hallelujah that's just one side now that is small church this is small in comparison to New Jerusalem the New Jerusalem is 1,500 miles long one side but that's from Maine to Florida I measured it out on the map that's right one side is Maine to Florida but you and I get to live there with Christ hallelujah amen that's one side is 15,000 I'm sorry 1500 miles wow but the Ezekiel one is only 750 ft so it's much smaller um and all the nations have to flow into it and they have to learn to obey Christ because they didn't obey Christ during during this whole uh human history they never obeyed Christ okay so um I like what brother Ram said brother Ram said that uh Satan in Luke chapter 4 Satan said Jesus Bow Down and Worship me and I'll give you all the kingdoms of the world and brother R said Jesus said get behind me Satan because he knew he was going to fall air to them in the Millennium hallelujah praise God so he Satan tried to tempt him just take these kingdoms now and Jesus said no I'm going to get him in the Millennium Hallelujah am and that's found in Luke chapter 1 so if you got your BBL Luke chapter 1 he's promised the Throne of David Luke I think it's 133 if I'm not mistaken I preach it last night and I'm kind of skipping a little bit just to hit the highlights church this is what you can live for when sometimes when you go through trials just remember it's all training so you can Reign Over sin that God can trust you to Reign during the Millennium Hallelujah verse 32 he shall be great and he shall be called the son of the highest and the Lord God shall give unto him the Throne of his father David and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end Hallelujah so this is the Throne of David this is the son of David Ministry brother brand calls it because uh this is the time where the the kingdom of David has no end for a thousand years and then really it basically continues into the uh the New Jerusalem because he's ruling right so this is the uh I guess we could write the Throne of David here yeah we could say the throne or the son of David here we'll call it son of David here son of David is that a very good o now how many know brother Ram said there Jesus has three names as a son he's son of man prophet he's Son of God right now high priest in heaven and during the Millennium he's son of David Hallelujah son of man Son of God Son of David now during during if you read the the uh if you read the gospels he's called all three of them right right but it and and then there's there's no you know strict separation like that he can be called any of them but the main point is that you see all three he's a prophet priest king that's all right amen prophet phet priest king just like David David was a foreshadowing of it David was prophet priest and King he foreshadowed Jesus Christ hallelujah amen and he was a man after God's Own Heart amen and David means beloved right and and the voice when Jesus got baptized the voice said this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased hallelujah oh my David was a prefigure he was a perfect type of Jesus Christ Hallelujah so we got son of man uh yeah son of man during his lifetime Son of God Son of David I should probably write that over here all right son of man then you then you'll understand that remember Ezekiel was called son of man then now he's Son of God because he's a high priest in heaven and then son of David sorry a little overlap in there so you can see that three sons names brother Braham said he comes in so a man now there's actually more he's also called son of Abraham in the gospels as well but these are the three that he mainly Works in here son of man Son of God Son of David okay now let's keep moving here by God's grace uh there's many quotes here brother Brown says this uh mighty God in Veil before us the church age book Jesus is the son of David he'll sit on the throne of David in the Millennium Hallelujah all right now the Millennium is the honey Moon uh they asked brother brandom in questions and answers part two he says will there be people on the Earth in Corporal bodies during the Millennium he said yes sir we will have our glorified body here on Earth eating drinking building houses and living just like we do now for a thousand years unreal so this is just like we do now except our bodies are perfect amen they're not going to get tired they're not going to get sore we're not going to get angry right we're not gonna we're not going to get arthritis or anything like that Hallelujah we have a glorified body which means a perfect human body Hallelujah and brother R said that's the honeymoon of the bride and the groom that's why I wrote honeymoon down here right we have H the ceremony the wedding supper there and then now then we got the the honeymoon there by God's grace okay so that's what brother Ram tells us that's question answers part 264 okay now I'm going to skip ahead here uh there's so many things I could say uh but I'm going to hold it I think it'd be better just to read more scripture tonight so that you get a good understanding of it now the Millennium is after the battle of Armageddon because the after the battle of Armageddon it cleanses the Earth for a thousand years so we want to read the scripture uh on that so let's go to Revelation 19 for the battle of Armageddon Revelation 19 verse 11 yeah and it's 11 all the way down to 21 I'll just fix that uh 11- 21 Battle of armagedon and I saw heaven open and behold a white horse and he that sat upon him was called faithful and true in righteousness he doth judge and make war his eyes were a flame of fire on his head were many crowns brother said where' he get those crowns the elders threw their crowns at him hallelujah amen that's Revelation chapter 5 amen they fall down and say we're not worthy you're worthy Jesus so he's he's having many crowns on his head Hallelujah he says and he had a name written that no man knew but he himself and he was clothed with a vesture dipped in Blood and his name is called the word of God look wherever he goes he's white but he's got red blood everywhere he goes he's the blood amen there there's the bloodline Hallelujah everywhere Jesus is there's got to be blood so he can have mercy on people hallelujah and notice he's also he's got a name it's called the word of God in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God hallelujah amen so it's Jesus he's his name is the word verse 14 and the armies which were in heaven fed him upon white horses clothed in fine linen wide and clean brother R said that's the bride so you and I right here we come back uh at the Battle of army again we come back on white horses Hallelujah Jesus is the leading one and we're behind him praise God the armies of Heaven amen that's right now verse 15 and out of his mouth go a sharp sword and with it he should Smite the Nations and he that shall rule I'm sorry and he shall rule them with a rod of iron and he treadeth The Wine Press of the fierceness of the wrath of almighty God and he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written king of kings and Lord of lords amen now I'm not going to read the rest of it but that's when the birds come down after the after the sword comes out of jesus' mouth it destroys all these armies it's China it's Russia I think by that time brother said United States will probably be destroyed by that time right because they the in the seventh major Vision the United States was supposed to be destroyed at some point during the the tribulation period the Bible only says the go and Magog and the the armies of the East would come against Israel so that's an interesting point but notice the the sword comes out and it destroys the Nations but then it said he's going to rule over them and then all these birds come down and the birds eat the carcasses of these evil armies and brother said look that's the same way that Ahab and Jezebel died remember animals ate their bones and brother so look now we got the spiritual Jezebel the Roman Catholic Church unreal and so God puts the same judgment on spiritual Jezebel like he did on the natural Jezebel unreal dogs lick their blood right birds eat their flesh it's the Judgment because they rejected the Holy Ghost but thank God we received it hallelujah amen hallelujah we won't add to the word we won't take the ways of the world we'll take the way with the Lord's despised few hallelujah amen that's right Hallelujah so see the files of the ER take they they Feast on the Flesh of this wicked Army this Jezebel Army and they end the same way that the natural Jezebel ended okay now now you got that now you got battle of Armageddon now I want to go go to Malachi 4 because uh brother man said before Jesus can actually literally step on the Earth again it's got to be burnt over and brother R said that might be atomic bombs burning the Earth over uh it might be fervent heat you know Heavenly Fire Burning the Earth over but the Earth has to be cleansed before we can walk out into the Millennium brother bam teaches that many places so let's go to Malachi chap 4 verse 1 well John you want to read that can you read uh verses one and two brother but in the last days it shall come to pass that the mountain of the house of the Lord shall be established in the top of the mountains and it shall be exalted above the hills and people shall and people shall flow unto it and many nations shall come and say come and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord and to the house of God the god of Jacob and he will teach us of his ways and we will walk in his path for the law shall go forth of Zion and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem now that is a that's uh that is a a scripture there for the Millennium uh what was that verse brother would you read there what was that verse we're going that worked out okay what what verse was that m not M Mali sorry no that was that was okay though that was still a millennium verse and this is um 4 verse one and two is which yes that's actually a millennium verse so that worked out brother yes that's a yeah the mountain of the house of the Lord yes yeah because it says and many nations shall come and say come let us go up to the mountain of the Lord yes and to the house of the god of Jacob and he will teach you yes amen so he actually read a a verse ahead of time good brother I'm G to write that down it's Michael 4 1-5 Micah 4 1 through 5 I thought it was a Malachi that worked out wonderfully see how the holy spirit's gracious brother to us that's now he read some wonderful things many nations are going to flow into Jerusalem now is that happening now no are all the nations flowing into Jerusalem trying to worship God no has it happened since Micah wrote this no Jerusalem has been destroyed I think 11 times uh everybody almost every nation hates Israel this hasn't happened yet so it's either got to happen here or here but if you read the context it's here because look at the next verse look look what our brother said uh in verse two they're going to teach the ways but look at verse three and he shall judge among the people and rebuke strong Nations a far off so there's going to be Nations that are far from Jerusalem Jesus has to rebuke them right right because they won't come worship and they shall beat their swords into plow shears and their Spears into pruning hooks Nation shall not lift up a sword against Nation neither shall they learn War anymore but they shall sit every man under his Vine and under his fig tree and None Shall make them afraid for the of the lord of the hosts has spoken it for all people will walk everyone in the name of his God and we will walk in the name of the the Lord Our God forever and ever Hallelujah that's very good brother that worked out really good now uh let's go to Malachi 4 that worked out really good that was God that was God's love and God's grace right there that's beautiful behold the de cometh that shall burn as a no and all the proud Y and all that do wickedly shall be stubble and the day that cometh shall burn them up sayith the Lord of hosts that it shall leave them neither root nor Branch but unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings and ye shall go forth and grow up as Cales of the stall was that right yes sir yes yep and now read uh verse three Yes dear brother wonderful and you shall and ye shall tread down the wicked for they shall be ashes Under The Souls of your feet in the day that I shall do this sayth the Lord of hosts amen all right now let me look up brother Ram's real quick here so brother quotes it many places he says uh during the Millennium he said that is when the righteous will have their day with the Lord so again he says the day of the Lord and then he quotes this verse the righteous walk on the ashes of the wicked so those same carcasses now it's hard to think about that but same carcasses that partially eaten up by the birds God sends fire and now they're just stubble now now these now these bodies and now these armies that have been defeated their bodies are like ashes and stubble and the Bible said we walk over them into the Millennium right because remember Satan must be bruised under our feet unreal that's what God that's what Paul told the Romans Satan will be bruised shortly underneath your feet that's right the Christians got to have dominion over Satan Hallelujah and his armies so we can see that now brother Ram uses this quote many times if you look up uh ashes walking on the ashes of the wicked but says it many times one time is Christ The Mystery of God revealed he says uh and the righteous walk out in in the Millennium upon the ashes of the wicked see so we can see he says it many many times he says it in questions and answers 62 as well all right so it just it's plain it's all through the message brother Ram says that okay now we got that all right let me see what's next here and of course I'll take questions at the end as well I'm going to try to watch my time I can see it right there I've already gone 31 minutes now that's crazy now I want to say this here uh brother Ram was asked about the Millennium and uh he says well brother sister it's hard for me to understand it myself that was in questions and answer 64 part two okay so I want you to see that brother ramam said some things about the Millennium were hard for him to understand so we have to remember that I I might I'll tell you some of the things I've read here today some of these verses brother Ram did not used for the Millennium some of them he did okay like Micah he didn't use that for the Millennium but I can look at the scripture and see all the nations flowing in to Jerusalem to worship and I can see that they're still sinful because they need rebukes so it's got to be the Millennium it can't be here because they're all the Sinners have been destroyed here all the there's no more sin after the white Throne judgment because all the Sinners are done away within the Lake of Fire hallelujah amen all right so a few of these I add in there because it's the same idea the same thought the same story the same context Hallelujah and then of course as you probably know there's no thus sayith the Lord from Brother brandom on the Millennium like he doesn't say thus sayi the Lord is this or thus say the Lord is that he was doing his best to teach it as a Bible teacher and so I'm I'm doing my best as a Bible teacher to put all the scriptures together that match the day of the Lord right amen and the way you know is because that there can be sin here but there can't be sin here that's how you know it's very easy very easy to understand that okay all right now here's what brother R said the foolish virgin will miss the Millennium this is in the church age book chapter 7 which you can begin to see by these truths is much more important everybody say important important and wonderful say wonderful wonderful than we have ever thought or believed so brother R said the Millennium is more important than you believed and it's more wonderful than you've ever believed Hallelujah now here's my thought why is it important because you are given the position that God has ordained you to have eternally you finally come into your position where God wanted you to reign with your husband and rule over cities and Nations perhaps right you finally you finally live in total Victory amen total peace amen total total uh Purity total Holiness you uh as the Bible said you're finally a manifested Son of God Amen remember Romans 8 says that cre ation is groaning for the manifestation of the sons of God Amen brother says you will be the manifested Son and Daughter of God in the Millennium praise the Lord in other words you'll fully manifest the power of God through your life oh hallelujah amen now let's get your Bibles handy I want to uh read this uh brother Daniel I'm going to give you a verse here brother just a moment I want you to see where Jesus promised that we'd rule over cities and Nations if we were just faithful how many want to be faithful hallelujah amen me too so be faithful with your uh your your jobs your money be faithful with this church Hallelujah uh be faithful with your husband your wife your children be faithful and all it and then surely the one that's faithful and true will help you reign in the Millennium Hallelujah if you're faithful we know he's faithful hallelujah amen so uh brother Daniel let's do uh it's Luke let me see Luke 19:17 brother Luke 1917 and he said unto him well thou good servant because thou has been faithful in a very little have thou authority over 10 C amen how many cities 10 10 I can hardly handle my house with eight kids but Jesus said said if I'm faithful with whatever talents now in the in the parable you either get five talents two or one I probably I'm a one Talent preacher but if I can be faithful brother irin with that one he'll make me ruler over two cities right I don't even know I'm going to do handle two cities but I want to give you these so you can see what was that Luke 19 what was that 1917 brother yeah okay all right go to Revelation 2 226 and 27 sister Lydia do you want to read that for us Revelation 226 and 27 whenever you got it sister Bren amen who gets that who gets to have power over Nations the Overcomer hallelujah praise God amen the Overcomer so brother says if you can just overcome Satan the flesh the devil and sin he said if you can just overcome those you will be crowned and overcover hallelujah amen glory to God if you can just stay true to the word of God and not be drawn out into sin or drawn out into denomination if you can just be led by the Holy Ghost and faithful to the word of God God will make you rule over Nations hallelujah thank you Jesus now I believe this the I believe this the apostles will probably rule over Nations and I'm I'm not talking about the 12 apostles I'm talking about uh missionaries sure missionaries during the church age will probably rule over Nations because Jesus said they get the highest reward remember he said he said anyone who leaves father mother land for my sake receives H hundredfold in the in the next life unreal he said there's 100-fold 60-fold 30-fold rewards there's always these three levels of rewards three three is a good number Perfection Hallelujah so see there's always this these level rewards and that's what the Millennium is the Millennium is to reward you for letting Jesus Ru in your life Hallelujah if you let Jesus rule your life now he'll make you a ruler later on and look Church you even get a rod you even get a rod of iron like Authority see because there's there's going to be all these people for a thousand years there's going to be these heathens multiplying the Bible says so we're going get to that a little bit and they're going to need rebukes and some of you have to slam that rod down and say no this is how it's going to be no that's what the Bible says Rod of iron right they need rebuked right they need to be taught the ways of the Lord because God Jesus has never had a thousand years to rule over the world yet he's never had that time to rule because brother R said this is the day of man's rule right Biden rules Justin Trudeau rules in Canada right really it's Satan ruling behind them right we know Satan owns but brother said this is the day of man but the Millennium is the day of the Lord hallelujah amen that's the Lord's day amen amen when Jesus rules and he places those that were beheaded those that believe the word of God and those that did not worship the Beast he places them as rulers as Kings and Priests unto God hallelujah amen hallelujah so you rule and reign with Christ uh for a thousand years now uh how many know you're a spiritual priest unto God how many know that let's go to Hebrews uh I think it's Hebrews 12 if you would go to Hebrews [Music] 12 no I'm sorry it's Hebrews 13:15 yeah here's how so that's how you're a king you're a king or queen because you rule over sin but you're a priest because you do this scripture brother iring do you want to read this one this is Hebrews uh 13 uh it's 15 and 16 brother by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually that is the FR of our lips giving thanks to his name but to do good and to communicate forget not for with such sacri amen the church said the ible said offer the sacrifice of praise so even when you don't feel it I know it's late on wedes Thursday night we probably all worked hard today but if we say praise the Lord that's a sacrifice unto God amen amen you might have been chasing children around all day right you might working out in the store all day you might work in the cafeteria all day you might have been working out in the hot sun all day but when you just come here and say God thank you God I love you that makes you a priest unto God hallelujah and you give him thanks remember that ver verse 16 do good when you do good that's a sacrifice that God receives you did good today you didn't do bad today you did good Hallelujah you did good you Tred to do good with your life and God sees that as a sacrifice well received now the word communicate uh there uh usually means uh money collection so ties and offerings so see when you pay your ties and offerings God sees that that's a sacrifice sometimes we need that money right so what's your choice you going to keep it or you going to sacrifice it hallelujah praise the Lord all right go to First Peter I'm looking this up on the Fly here 1 Peter 2:5 yep there it is 1 Peter 2:5 and Sister Sarah whenever you get to read that for us again I'm gonna write that there 1 Peter 2:5 1 Peter 25 whenever you got it sister to offer amen see we're in a spiritual priesthood the Bible said we're Kings and Priests unto God now right right now we're promised to later but we got to do it now Hallelujah we have to give spiritual sacrifices not kill our animals and sacrifice our animals like the Old Testament but it's give God praise give your tithes and offerings do good help other people and when God sees you do that he said that's a spiritual king that's a spiritual Queen that's a spiritual priest unto God Almighty amen hallelujah that's the scripture now there's another one I was thinking about oh yeah yeah go to uh 2 Corinthians 5 no I'm sorry it's Romans 5:17 Romans 5:17 this might be one of my best drawings ever I think not too bad by God's grace I'm just joking Romans 5:17 here uh sister Ruth you want to read that when you get a chance now especially look at the end of this verse what is God what is Paul telling the Romans to do whenever you're ready sister Ruth amen see when you receive the gift of Grace what does it help you do what does grace help you do Paul said I labored more than they all not I but the grace of God that was in me so when you receive the God's grace what does it make you do it helps you to reign in this life by Jesus Christ Hallelujah he gives you the he gives you the gift of Salvation so what does it make you do it empowers you right I'm forgiven hallah I'm going to heaven I want to tell others about that Hallelujah I want to tell others and so now since he's forgiven me all my sins are washed away now I'm going to serve God now I'm going to be a king and priest unto him and I'm going to re in this life by Jesus Christ Hallelujah every see that when you came out of that church see now when you I'll say like this when you overcame the fear of man right you overcame it now you rule over it right you won't let it come over you again right now for me it was uh dirty movies uh uh chewing tobacco Sports those all rained over me for a time period but now that I got the grace of God now I re over them Hallelujah they don't control my life see I re in this life because of the gift of God like Ruth read there because of God's grace now I reign in this life by Jesus Christ I'm a spiritual priest now offering sacrific brother Irvin we had church last night I preached I sang I shouted I worshiped God just like I'm doing tonight amen it's a sacrifice I don't always feel like it but I know that's what God's called me to do right and I know if I do this now says s Lydia he'll make me a ruler in the Millennium Hallelujah cuz that's what he said that's what he says if you can just re over sin now you'll rule for a thousand years amen hallelujah sister wima and brother uran amen they're going to rule and reain for a thousand years Hallelujah talk about a good Farm you're going to have brother and sister if you thought this was an awesome organic farm You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet the B the Bible says that you will build houses brother and you'll plant Vineyards sister and the Bible said nobody else will take him over you get him for a thousand years oh it's beautiful uh let's read it Isaiah 65 we have so much promises to us mind you know eyes the Bible says mind is not heard eyes is not seen ears not heard the things that God has prepared for them that love him amen it's so important it's so wonderful we can't even begin to understand what God has in store for us amen Hall all right Isaiah 65 let's start at verse 17 for behold I create new heavens and a new Earth and the former shall not be remembered nor come into mine see we ain't going to think about this this place we're not going to think about this God's going to wash it out of our memory praise God all the wickedness of this world we're going to get a brand new mind Hallelujah Verse 18 but ye I'm sorry but be ye glad and rejoice forever in that which I create for behold I create Jerusalem a rejoicing and her people a joy has that happened yet no there Jerusalem is constantly in war right like last week they started getting attack from Iran in the northern part of Jerusalem Northern Israel is getting attacked is is is Israel happy right now is Israel rejoicing no this has to be future tense Hallelujah now verse 19 and I'll rejoice in Jerusalem and joy in my people and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her nor the voice of crying here we are there should be no more than an infant of days nor an old man that hath not filled his days for the child shall die a hundred years old see there's not going to be any babies that die in the Millennium the the the earliest a baby will die will be 100 years old that's quite a life right it's not going to be a baby anymore it's going to be an adult but the sinner being a hundred years old shall be a cursed so see some of the Sinners will die at 100 years old and people say oh they were cursed CU we had a thous they they could have lived A Thousand Years cuz there's no Satan there there's no Wars there right you and I are planting fields and man we got the best food ever right that's what the Bible says look at that verse look at verse 21 they and they shall build houses and inhabit them and they shall plant Vineyards and eat the fruit of them Hallelujah brother you haven't seen no Farms yet Hallelujah these are I'm amazed at this Farm Hal this is a beautiful Farm hallelujah look at the work man look at this guy he's such a worker but think about the Millennium where you never get tired amen Glory Hallelujah verse 20 there shall be no more than an infant of days nor an old man that hath not filled his days I'm sorry already read that verse 22 Let's see we start at 17 65 I'm going to write that up here so you got it uh 177 through quite a few there they shall not build and another inhabit aren't you glad you get to enjoy the work of your hands they shall not plant and another eat for as the days of a tree are the days of my people and my elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands unre they shall not labor in vain nor bring forth in trouble or for trouble for they are the seed of the bless of the Lord and their offspring with them oh brother John all your children will be gathered right around you Hallelujah hey amen so here here your children move away Glory but the Millennium our children are with us brother Iran hallelujah

sin there's no I'm I'm sorry there uh there's no death there's no war Hallelujah there's only Holiness Hallelujah and you brother M said all the wrongs are made right in the Millennium wow if there's anything ever done wrong to you it'll be made right during the Millennium un because it's God's people ruling in Holiness and all the nations will be taught to honor the word of God the Bible says later on that the righteousness will cover the Earth like the waters cover the sea what a statement you ever look at the Sea of course it's covered in waters right that's what the Bible says waters are the seas are covered with Waters that's what the Earth is going to be like everywhere you go on the earth in Millennium is going to be Jesus Christ as king king of kings Lord of lords the cross of Jesus Christ if the whole earth is going to be covered with the Gospel of Jesus Christ Hallelujah and you'll be known as the Kings and prests unto God hallelujah You Will Rule and Reign during that Thousand Years wow Hallelujah if you can just rain now Hallelujah God help me amen God help me Amen in my hours of trial my hours of Temptation Lord deliver me save me so I can reain now because I want to rain later hallelujah amen I don't want to miss that time brother it's more important and more wonderful than we ever imagined wow verse 24 and it shall come to pass that before they call I love this amen I will answer and while they're yet speaking I will hear so brother Irvin let's imagine you you're you're building your farm and you was like to say Lord Jesus I I could use some wood for a barn right before you speak it you're going to hear the answer I've already supplied it unreal oh thank you Lord wow it's on it's on its way thank you Lord hallelujah before you call I already answer hallelujah amen praise the Lord that's right you know what because he loves you and he cares for you hallelujah amen before you call he'll answer and while you're speaking I'll here so even when you're talking a certain well brother Jesse you know I think I like to do some corn and by the time you talk it God hears it Hallelujah going to answer it oh it's beautiful it's more wonderful than we could ever imagine brother Daniel look at this verse 25 this is the famous verse and the wolf and the lamb shall feed together a wolf and a lamb and the lion shall eat straw like the Bullock I wonder if you have those big sharp teeth still he's going to be eating the straw you're selling straw right brother I saw that sign out there that's what the lions are going to be eaten during the Millennium and dust shall be the Serpent's meat so we know the Serpent's going to stay that way right because he's cursed he started all this they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my Holy Mountain sayeth the Lord all right that's through through 25 that is amazing Hallelujah now there's so many more verses oh my go to Zechariah [Music] 14:16 this is a beautiful chapter uh this opened up to me just a few weeks ago Zechariah 14:16 this is a key verse CU here's here's something maybe maybe you didn't know I I didn't know it till a while ago during uh everybody say armag again ready AR Jesus comes out remember he's got the sword that goes out of his mouth and destroys the armies well some people are not going to be right there in the battle brother and they're going to survive that that attack W and whoever's left that survives Armageddon they're going to live into the Millennium and then they're going to fill up the Earth those are the ones we rule over that says right here Zechariah 14:16 and it should come to pass that everyone that is left of all the nations which came against Jerusalem shall even go up from year to year to worship the king the Lord of hosts and to keep the Feast of Tabernacles Hallelujah W see that now if you know other verses in Zechariah says all nations will come against Jerusalem and then Jesus Will rescue them right right and he rescues them in the Armageddon right so whoever is left out of all those that doesn't die when Jesus sends the sword of judgment whoever's left they have to learn to go up to Jerusalem and worship at the millennial Temple every year they got to go to the house of God hallelujah now look at verse look at 17 there's there's punishments and consequences if they don't worship Jesus look at verse 17 and it shall be that who so will not come up of all the families of the earth unto Jerusalem to worship the king the Lord of hosts even upon them shall be no rign see this hasn't happened yet right this hasn't happened right California doesn't worship Jesus yet they still get rain right right New York doesn't worship Jesus yet they still get rain not everybody in Ohio worship Jesus they still get rain but in the Millennium if you don't worship God there's an instant consequence no rain unreal because this is the day of the Lord this is the Lord's ruling hallelujah amen so see there's still punishments look at verse uh yeah finish 18 there shall there shall be the plague where with the Lord will Smite the Heathen that will not come up to keep the Feast of Tabernacles this shall be the punishment of Egypt and the punishment of all Nations that come not up to keep the Feast of Tabernacles Hallelujah so every nation around the world is required to come and brother BR said there won't be any Automotives in the Millennium so they're going back to the horse and carts so the Amish people they got a good thought there that that's that's what the Bible says they're going to have chariots and carts they have to make a trip every year an annual trip all around the world to come and worship Jesus Christ if they don't they're getting plagues and no rain see because because they have to be taught he's going to teach the whole world he's Lord of lords he's King of Kings he's king of creation he's creator of the whole earth and they must learn to know him they must learn to worship him if not there's consequences this is the day of the Lord aren't you glad Hallelujah aren't you glad you know about it amen glory amen and you can be prepared for it Hallelujah now look at verse 21 I'm going to skip verse 20 go to verse 21 yay every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be Holiness unto the Lord of hosts and now look at this and all all they that sacrifice shall come and take of them and see therein and in that day there shall be no more the Canaanite in the house of the Lord of hosts so God's even going to kick the Canaanites out during the Millennium they're either that or they're destroyed but notice all they that sacrifice so when these nations come around the world to worship Jesus for a thousand years they got to bring a sacrifice and Ezekiel talks about that where the priests are going to cut up sacrifices during the Millennium animal sacrifices they are going to be taught to worship God that's right now but did you see verse Zechariah 14:16 everyone that's left of all the nations that come against Jerusalem shall go up to worship every year all right everybody can see that by God's grace amen all right now I'm already at about an hour I'm at 57 minutes so I'm going to try to bring this down to a close um yeah let's hit a hit a few more okay let's go to Isaiah 2 verse two Isaiah 2 it's really 1 to five but we're just going to read two and five Isaiah 2 1 and 5 Isaiah 2 ver2 says and it shall come to pass in the last days that the mountain of the Lord's House should be established in the top of the mountains and shall be exalted above the hills and listen and All Nations shall flow into it that hasn't happened yet right nobody goes to Israel to worship Harley none of the Nations do this has to be future now go down to verse four and he shall judge among the Nations and shall what rebuke many people there's going to be rebukes yes there's rebukes during the Millennium because these people are heathens right they just they they survive the Armageddon and they're just going to be living it's going to be peace we're going to be ruling over them but they still need to be taught the ways of the Lord hallelujah so see there's rebukes in the Millennium amen all right everybody can see that amen they got to learn not to do war and they got to learn in verse five they got to Come Ye let us walk in the light of the Lord they got to learn to walk in the light but we're already walking in the light Hallelujah we were Darkness but now we are light in the Lord hallelujah we seen that song saying we'll walk in the light such a beautiful light comes where the drops of Mercy are bright shine all around us by day and by night Jesus the light of the world what are they singing they're singing the Millennium Glory but we're already walking in the light because we confess our sins we're walking in the spiritual light now but one day brother we'll walk in the natural light of Jesus Christ during the Millennium hallelujah amen that's where they get the song from the millennium him remember John chapter I'm sorry 1 John 1 says when we confess our sins we walk in the light the spiritual light the light of this day the revelation of thus sayith the Lord the message of the hour for this hour hallelujah oh my glory just getting excited now I finally feel like preaching hallelujah oh my go to Jeremiah 3:16 And1 17 Jeremiah 3 16 and 17 and sister mam you want to read that whenever you're ready Jeremiah 3:16-17 now look at this they're going to say we don't need the Arc of the Covenant anymore now anybody now knows the Israel they want to rebuild their Temple and they want the Arc of the Covenant they want they want the arc the Brazen altar they want the altar of incense they want the seven golden candlesticks they want the ark so this has not been fulfilled yet sister read uh 16 and 17 come to when land in those days say the Lord they shall say no more the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord neither shall it come to mind neither shall they remember it neither shall they visit it neither shall that be done anymore at that time they shall call Jerusalem the Throne of the Lord and all the nations shall be gathered unto it to the name of the Lord to Jerusalem neither shall they walk anymore after the imagination of their evil heart Hallelujah so all have to come to the throne of God and they're not even thinking about the ark why because Jesus Christ is there he was the ark he is the mercy seed Hallelujah he is the Lamb Hallelujah he is the presence of God and the church said amen they don't even think about oh we need a in the Old Testament they always needed the ark remember Joshua had to have the ark Moses had to have the ark everybody had to have the ark because that represented the presence of God but now during the Millennium we don't need the ark because we've got Christ hallelujah amen that's what the ark was all about out Jesus Christ amen hallelujah we don't need it anymore and All Nations got to come and worship the God Almighty hallelujah oh it's beautiful now I'm trying to let me my there's so much more here I'm just going to write these maybe you can read them in your own time uh Isaiah 11 11 6-9 we're not going to read it I'll just write up here Isaiah 11 [Music] the Bible says a little child shall lead a calf and a young lion a child will lead a lion around that's the Millennium the Bible said the suckling child shall play in the hole of a ASP or a snake a little suckling child a child that's still nursing is going to go play in a snake's Den that's what the Bible says the wean shild shall put his hand on the cockatrices den the snakes Den they're going to be able to play with the snakes in their dens they shall not hurt nor destroy in all my Holy Mountain talk about life amen talk about Adventure M talk about having an adventure amen you can go out and actually get in the the the snakes hole in the ground and play with them that's what the Bible says hasn't happened yet but it's going to happen hallelujah it's thus sayith the lord it's going to happen hallelujah amen so let me in closing let me let me try to close here I don't want to be selfish and I don't want to try to I want to respect everybody working hard today so in summary let me just close with this summary the Millennium has births of babies not us because we already have our families because we have glorified bodies it'll be all it'll be all the other nations including Israel Israel will have priests that will have to work in the temple with of of Jesus it's in it's in Ezekiel 4 4 if you want to read it already write that up there yeah Ezekiel that's chapters you can read all about it I would encourage you to do it uh remember like a priest has to marry a a virgin or a U or a wife or a woman who um married a priest before but the priest died and she was a virgin when she got married it's in Ezekiel 44 so even Israel will have Nations that are natural Nations having babies there will be some death we saw that in Isaiah 65 there'll be children families infants there will be marriages Ezekiel 44 there will be an animal sacrifices and I brother I can share this with you if you want there will be survivors of the battle of Armageddon I talked about that there will be plagues as punishments if Nations don't worship Jesus oh yeah let's read this and the apostles will judge the 12 tribes of Israel just as Jesus Promised hallelujah amen Peter will judge right Peter will judge maybe he'll judge man maybe he'll judge Ephraim he will judge because they were they had a higher calling amen and he had the Keys of the Kingdom Hallelujah Matthew 19:28 why uh who could read that one there brother irin you want to read that Matthew 19:28 brother or wiin whoever's got their Bible uh thank you it's Matthew 19:28 Jesus Christ promised the 12 apostles now of course Judas is out we believe Paul's in or Maas Mias was a mighty missionary don't ever think he was not used by God Mias was a mighty man of God I think he took the gospel to India if I'm not mistaken he went the furthest him or Thomas Thomas or Maas did amazing missionary work so brother it was uh Matthew 19:28 brother and Jesus said unto them I sayto you that [Music] hallelujah praise God Amen so Jesus sits in the holiest of holies but then there's Thrones out there and all the tribes of Israel got to come in and they got to listen to the 12 apostles now I didn't write this one down you want to read you want to read this one uh Ezekiel 38 and 39 that speaks of Russia and China and it also says listen Saints Israel will be bearing Russian and Chinese bodies for seven months the the Bible said 7 months they'll be bearing these these uh bodies that are in uh ashes right stubble they're like stubble and then the Bible said for seven years brother irin they'll be burning the tanks and the planes and the guns for seven years it'll take to burn all those weapons of mass destruction that's what the Bible says unreal so there's a thousand years right but the first seven are bearing bodies and burning all the military devices un that's what God thinks about that right right that's in Ezekiel 39 9-12 but I just wrote both because you can read about uh go and Magog that's Russia and China all right also don't forget this I'm almost done in the Millennium we'll get answers from Jesus before we call right we'll rule up to 10 cities or you might even rule Nations now I believe the seven Church age Messengers will rule Nations I believe because they were stars in the very hand of God I believe we'll just rule cities because we're just little humble Christians we're not the stars in the hand of God We're Stars but we're not stars in the hands of God remember Abraham's seed was like the stars of heaven but we weren't the fiery stars in the hand of Jesus Christ I believe brother Randon will rule over Nations I believe Martin Luther will rule over Nations no doubt St Paul will hallelujah praise the Lord oh yes and there will be no Ark of the Covenant because the Lord is is there brother Bram said in God's power to transform 1965 he said and there will not be this kind of civilization in the world to come there will be no more automobiles or nothing that science has ever done see so all those planes all the tanks all the weapons that'll all be burned away even all the cars will be burned away unreal he said there will be no such things in that world that is to come it will be God's Own type of civilization that he'll set up in his glorious reign no sickness he says no no none of this he says it'll be a golden age he said it'll all be new there in God's civilization Hallelujah now I want you to read this last one uh Ezekiel 4835 it's the very last verse of Ezekiel so just go to Ezekiel 48 find the last verse maybe Micaiah can you read that buddy when you get it um Isaiah Jeremiah Ezekiel Ezekiel 48 the very last chapter let's look at the last verse look at the name of what they're going to call this place Hallelujah go brother whenever you got uh Ezekiel 48:35 last verse of [Music] Ezekiel City the Lord is there and the church said amen the name of that City the name of the bridegroom city is the Lord is there brother man said the holy spirit's here but Jesus's body isn't here yet amen hallelujah his body won't come down here until it's burnt with fire and the the the sins of the past have been have been burned up and then he as king can step on this throne and then the city he lives in and the Bible said he'll sit in the holiest of holies Hallelujah there's outer Court inner Court holiest of holies and the Bible said he'll sit in the holiest of holies there's no Arc of the Covenant because he is the presence of God he's God on the earth and everybody will call this city the Lord is there let's go up and worship because the Lord is there Hallelujah let's go give sacrifice because the Lord is there Hallelujah let
