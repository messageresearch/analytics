TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] that's exactly how I broke away from the missionary baptist Dr Roy E Davis how many you ever heard him sure he did you want to Art Ang and women preachers and I said no sir as an elder I said I cannot do that consciously it's against the word of God greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to answer a viewer's question about brother brandham being baptized by Roy Davis the question says quote could you clear up that internet accusation that William brandham was baptized by the grand wizard of the clan please thank you end quote so by God's grace I'll try to share a little bit about this topic I don't know everything about this topic but I'll share what I know by the grace of the Lord hi friends I'm Jesse Smith pastor bride of Christ Fellowship here in akan Ohio USA and I defend the Bible revelations that Jesus Christ revealed to his true Prophet The Late William brandham 1909 to 19 65 and I also defend brother bram's Godly character in this video of course I'm defending brother bram's Godly character uh before we get into the answer here that I gave to this brother let's remember a few things about the character of some of these people that have left the message and of course I don't mean all the people that have left the message but some of the people that have left the message remember a lot of these people that have left the message allow adulteries they allow women to cut their hair and God never asked a Godly woman to cut her hair hair because it's a shame and disgrace to her husband and also to Christ also some of these people that have left the message support non-binary relationships they support tattoos and tattoo parlors they support watching Wicked movies one of the main accusers of brother brandham supports Dracula rock and roll like Bon Joy ACDC and some of these people are lying about plagiarism brother brandham was not a plagiarist probably revisit this topic again soon just to review and let the viewers know there's over 38 differences between brother brandom's interpretation from Jesus on the Seven Seals compared to Clarence Larin Charles T Russell and Uriah Smith it's not even close and yet these accusers of brother brandom will lie right through their teeth and call Brother random a plagiarist of course they're guilty of slander and guilty of lying and that's just a few friends there's many many other presumptions and lies and slanderous accusations against brother brandom who was a man forgiven by his faith in the blood of Jesus Christ as brother random said repeatedly he was trusting in the merits of the blood of Jesus Christ to go to heaven not his own works I'm not sinless I got plenty hanging on me but every hour I confess it constantly when I see my wrong then I turn from that and try to do what's right I wouldn't try to go to heaven on my merits I wouldn't get there I'm trusting solemnly in Jesus Christ he is my trust I I I believe in him I wouldn't try to go in because I'm a Pentecostal brother I I wouldn't go in on the merits of Pentecost I'd go in on the merits of the blood of Jesus Christ he died for me and that's what I want you to trust the merits of him and then how you know you're getting there is when every word is you punctuate with an amen amen because it's a word itself trying to vindicate itself and if we deny that word how can it vindicate itself so shame on these accusers of brother brandham for slandering him lying about him making presumptuous claims about him the Bible actually calls this slandering and reviling and there's awful repercussions for these types of sins so may God have mercy on some of these people so back to the question could you clear up the internet accusation that William Brandon was baptized by the grand wizard of the clan please a few things to note here yes brother Ram did say he was baptized by Roy Davis that's in many places but one is God keeps his word 1957 brother Bram said one of the high Baptist men Dr Davis baptized me into the Baptist Fellowship let's listen to the quote when I went to the the G overseer one of the high Baptist man Franklin the want to baptizing Dr Davis into the Baptist Fellowship I went and told him about he said bny you need a rest you've had a nightmare I said I don't appreciate that I'll resign the Baptist church right now but friends remember brother brand was not with Roy E Davis that long we all remember Roy Davis tried to get brother Bram to support women preacher so brother R left the church so I don't need to play those quotes most people know that but I am going to play this one does God ever change his mind about his word 1965 brother Ram said he broke away from the missionary baptist and Dr Roy E Davis because he wanted to ordain some women preachers that's exactly how I broke away from the missionary baptist Dr Roy E Davis how many you ever heard him sure he did you want to ardain some women preachers and I said no sir as an elder I said I cannot do that consciously it's against the word of God so this was very early in brother Ram's Ministry he broke away from Roy Davis so again we cannot make brother brandham guilty by association with Roy Davis there's no proof absolutely no evidence brother Ram supported any of Roy Davis's sinful lifestyle decisions so we do not make brother random Guilty By Association just like we don't make Jesus Guilty by association with Judas the scarit so friends it's a good sign brother brandom separated himself from Roy Davis it seems like brother brandom did not know all the evil in Roy's life apparently according to the research from the accuser side those that accused brother brandom apparently Roy Davis was a leader in the KKK married three times had multiple arrests imprisonments money laundering and many more accusations now I myself have not done that research so I don't know but one thing's for sure brother random lived a clean life in all honesty and Holiness and there's no marks against him it's clear brother Ram was baptized with the Holy Ghost and he lived a Godly clean holy Christian Life by God's grace it's also important to know that brother Ram never promoted Roy Davis or his teachings after brother Ram left Roy Davis's church now of course there are some stories where brother Brenham said positive things about Roy Davis but no doubt a few good things could have been said about Judas escar as well because he had gifts to heal the sick to cast out Devils to raise the dead and so forth but any honest person would realize if they listen to brother brandom with an honest heart brother brandom did not support Roy Davis's lifestyle it seems brother Ram didn't know about his sinful decisions either so here's kind of what I wrote to the person who asked the comment on YouTube I said from what I've heard on the podcast of brother Ram's accusers Roy Davis was a wicked man and possibly involved in the KKK I've never done this research myself also brother Ram's accusers often exalt their research as infallible and many times they've been wrong WR so I don't trust everything they publish so that's something to keep in mind and friends this subject boils down to this brother random said Roy Davis baptized him and that has nothing to do with brother ROM's own faith or trust in the blood of Jesus Christ for brother brandom's salvation the truth is even if a person who turns out to be a sinner baptized a True Believer it doesn't take away the true believer's trust in Jesus Christ a good example of this is judas's scarit for he baptized Believers according to John 4:2 the Bible says though Jesus himself baptized not but his disciples so Judas baptized Judas was also sent out with all the power to heal the sick raise the dead according to Matthew chapter 10 and no doubt Judas did many signs wonders and miracles because even at the Last Supper when Jesus said one of you will betray me not everyone knew it was Judas they actually looked at themselves first so it's clear Judas had the anointing of the holy spirit in the gifts in his life to do Supernatural wonders Miracles he baptized people he did everything all the other Apostles did but of course he sold out his faith in Christ and went to hell the Bible calls him the son of predition the son of Destruction so this is what I likened to Roy Davis if indeed Roy Davis was the person that brother Ram's accusers are calling him so just because Judas the scarat may have baptized someone didn't mean that new believer lost their salvation Judas the scariot had gifts from God to heal and baptize and more and and it seems like God honored those gifts in judas's life despite Judas falling away and selling out Jesus the Same is true in the Bible we see it with balum and also in Matthew 7 21-23 we'll start with balum he had a gift to prophesy and his star of Jacob Prophecy from The Book of Numbers was 100% correct and the wise men used his prophecy to find baby Jesus but balam went to hell According to second Peter chapter 2 remember Matthew 7:21-23 Jesus said not everyone that says Lord Lord will enter the kingdom of God only those who do the will of My Father which is in heaven Jesus said many will come to me and say did not we prophesy in thy name cast out devils and do many wonderful works and Jesus will say I never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity so notice Jesus never said these anointed ones didn't do the works didn't do the Miracles or didn't do the casting out Devils Jesus never denied their gifts and their Supernatural experiences he never said their gifts or Works were illegitimate but he said they lived a life of iniquity so this is what I believe applies to brother brandham and Roy Davis Roy Davis if he ended up living a life of iniquity then he would be departing from Jesus at the white Throne judgment but brother randam lived a Godly clean Holy Ghost Christian life and that's undeniable so in summary this is a straw man argument that Roy Davis's baptism of brother brandom somehow disqualifies brother brandom from Ministry or from being a true Prophet again these accusers of brother brandom are trying to get people's attention away from the word of God that brother Brandon preached the over 110 true doctrines he taught that all the denominations get wrong I'll leave a video about that in the description the six thus sayith the Lords that came to pass brother R was a true prophet of God I'll leave a link to that in the description the videos on the Seven Seals and how there's over 38 differences between brother Ram's Revelation from Jesus Christ and the teaching of Larin Russell and Uriah Smith I'll leave link L to that playlist in the description friends we got to keep our eyes on the Lord Jesus Christ and the word of God that brother brandham brought us and when questions like this come up I'll do my best to answer them by the grace of our Lord and then remember friends look at the people who are making these accusations they're lovers of Pleasures more than lovers of God many of them don't even have a gift to preach the gospel so they're misinterpreting the word of God they're adding false doctrines to their churches they're taking away the true doctrines that brother renam restored by the leading of Jesus Christ so they're guilty of adding to the word and taking away from the word and there are awful repercussions to those actions as well in closing friends I hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God again we got to keep our eyes on the word of God that brother Brandon brought to us and of course all these false accusations these slanderous accusations can all be proven wrong that's what this video was meant to do prove these accusers Wrong by the grace of the Lord so let's have a word of prayer for them and then I'll let you know and then I'll let you know about contacting me by God's grace father God we just thank you for the truth we thank you that the word of God sets us free Lord God thank you that we can see brother random had Faith In You Lord he had faith in the blood of Jesus Christ he was trusting in your blood dear Jesus for his salvation and we know we'll see him there in heaven as a true prophet of God we're thankful for that Lord father thank you for the word that you've revealed to us Lord Jesus may we continue to look at your word and grow in Grace and knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ and may you continue guiding us into all truth I pray for brother Ram's accusers those that can be saved I pray they'll repent of their lies slander presumptuous statements and may they humble themselves and may they be washed in the waters of the word and admit to and follow the truth by God's grace so
