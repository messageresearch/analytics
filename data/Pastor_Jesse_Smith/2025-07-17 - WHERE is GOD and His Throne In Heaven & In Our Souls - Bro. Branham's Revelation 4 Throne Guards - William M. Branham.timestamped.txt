[0:03] Now remember, God's got some guards for
[0:05] that for that mercy seat.
[0:08] Oh, I just had a glorious time. Now
[0:10] watch what it was, what the Lord did.
[0:13] &gt;&gt; Greetings, friends, in the matchless
[0:15] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The
[0:18] purpose of this video is to find where
[0:20] is the throne of God? Where is God? This
[0:24] topic was suggested to me by a precious
[0:26] brother. So I appreciate the suggestion
[0:28] and I hope this video is a blessing by
[0:30] the grace of the Lord. So the answer to
[0:32] that question is God is both in his
[0:34] heavenly throne and also on the throne
[0:38] of every heart of every true believer
[0:41] living here on the earth. I'll begin
[0:44] with a few points here by the grace of
[0:45] God. The first point is that God has
[0:47] always had a throne or a spiritual seat
[0:50] or a dwelling place. Remember before God
[0:54] created anything he was all alone. the
[0:56] invisible God, God the Father. So, he
[0:59] had a dwelling place. Then God became
[1:02] visible in the logos or we'd say God's
[1:04] theophony, the Holy Ghost. And then God
[1:07] must have created a throne for his
[1:10] theophony, his son, and then created the
[1:13] angels to worship his son. So that was
[1:16] the first visible throne of God in the
[1:18] spiritual realm. And in this video,
[1:21] we'll go through the Old Testament
[1:22] thrones on earth, the New Testament
[1:24] thrones on earth, and then the heavenly
[1:27] throne. And lastly, we'll look at
[1:29] brother Aram's glorious time and
[1:31] revelation that he shared with us
[1:33] regarding the throne of God. Another
[1:35] important point is that due to God's
[1:37] omnipotence, he can be on all these
[1:39] thrones at one time. God is all
[1:42] powerful. God can manifest himself in as
[1:45] many ways and in as many places as he
[1:48] wants. This is specifically seen at
[1:51] Jesus' baptism. Three manifestations,
[1:53] yet one God, one person, not three
[1:56] persons. It's also seen on the day of
[1:58] Pentecost. The Holy Ghost is seen as a
[2:00] lick of fire above 120 believers. He was
[2:04] seen as a lick of fire above them. And
[2:06] then he was also dwelling in their
[2:08] souls. So the Holy Ghost is not 120
[2:11] different persons. The Holy Ghost is one
[2:13] person. It's God the Father. It's God in
[2:16] us. God the Father is God above us. the
[2:18] invisible God. Jesus is God with us,
[2:22] Emmanuel. And the Holy Ghost is God in
[2:24] us. And the third and final point I want
[2:27] to make is that when we speak of the
[2:29] heart and the soul, sometimes they're
[2:32] used interchangeably, but sometimes
[2:34] they're used as different aspects of
[2:37] mankind's being.
[2:40] Sometimes heart is used for the
[2:41] emotions, which would be in the human
[2:43] spirit. Sometimes heart is used as the
[2:46] soul. Here's a few examples. In Jeremiah
[2:49] 17:9, the Bible says, "The heart is
[2:51] deceitful above all things." Well, if
[2:54] I'm a Holy Ghostfilled believer and God
[2:55] is in my soul, well, then my soul is not
[2:57] deceitful. It would be my human mind or
[3:00] my human emotions would be deceitful.
[3:02] Ephesians 3:17 says that Christ may
[3:05] dwell in your hearts by faith. So, in
[3:07] this case, heart is speaking of the
[3:09] soul. And then Deuteronomy 6:5
[3:12] says, "Love the Lord thy God with all
[3:14] thy heart and with all thy soul." So in
[3:16] this scripture, heart is the emotions in
[3:19] the human spirit and soul would be the
[3:21] innermost part of man, his nature. So we
[3:25] have to be careful when we read the
[3:26] Bible to apply heart and soul in the
[3:28] correct manner based upon the context by
[3:31] the grace of God. So let's begin with
[3:33] the Old Testament throne. Now in the
[3:36] Hebrew, the word throne means a seat,
[3:39] throne, stool. So the first Old
[3:42] Testament throne would be the Garden of
[3:44] Eden. The tree of life had to be the
[3:47] Lord Jesus Christ. Had to be the spirit
[3:50] of Jesus Christ. This is one of the keys
[3:52] to the serpent seed. If the tree of life
[3:54] was a literal tree, then there's two
[3:56] ways to eternal life. That would break
[3:58] God's word. That would break God's plan.
[4:00] There's only one way to eternal life.
[4:02] That's through the spirit of God. So the
[4:04] tree of life in the Garden of Eden was
[4:05] the spirit of Jesus, the logos, or the
[4:08] Holy Ghost. So God's presence was seated
[4:11] there in the garden. That was the first
[4:13] throne of God on earth was in the garden
[4:15] of Eden. And the Bible also said that
[4:17] God walked in the garden. That was
[4:19] mentioned after Adam and Eve had sinned,
[4:21] though. But it seems like perhaps the
[4:24] spirit of God was dwelling there in the
[4:25] garden, walking and fellowshipping with
[4:28] Adam and Eve before the fall. But again,
[4:31] that's just my thought. I could be wrong
[4:33] on that. After the fall, the first time
[4:35] a seat or throne is mentioned is Exodus
[4:39] 25:22.
[4:41] God said, "There will I meet with thee.
[4:43] I will commune with thee from above the
[4:45] mercy seat from between the two
[4:47] cherubams which are upon the ark of
[4:49] testimony."
[4:52] Now before this, God had met with
[4:54] humans, believers and unbelievers,
[4:56] numerous times. Of course, he spoke to
[4:59] Cain in Genesis 4. He spoke to Noah in
[5:01] Genesis 6. God came in the form of
[5:04] Melzdc and met with Abraham in Genesis
[5:06] 14. The Lord appeared to Isaac and Jacob
[5:09] as well. But Exodus 25:22
[5:13] is the first mention of God having
[5:14] another earthly throne or seat. God's
[5:18] presence would meet Moses and Aaron
[5:20] above the mercy seat or perhaps only
[5:22] Aaron if I'm not mistaken. And then the
[5:24] Old Testament traces the locations of
[5:28] the ark of the covenant. Moses, of
[5:30] course, had it in the tabernacle in the
[5:32] wilderness. Joshua carried it into
[5:34] battle. Then it went to Shiloh in the
[5:36] book of Judges 20 27.
[5:40] And then in 1st Samuel chapters 4-7, the
[5:43] ark went from Shiloh to Felistia, then
[5:46] to Kirjath Jereim. The days of David,
[5:50] David brought the ark into Jerusalem. 2
[5:52] Samuel 6. Of course, King Solomon had
[5:56] the ark in Jerusalem in First Kings 8.
[5:59] The Kingdom of Judah had the ark in 2
[6:02] Chronicles 35:3. And that is the final
[6:05] historical mention of the Ark of the
[6:07] Covenant, if I'm not mistaken, 2
[6:09] Chronicles 35:3 when Josiah restores
[6:12] worship and restores the ark.
[6:16] Next, in the New Testament, the throne
[6:18] of God, of course, the first throne of
[6:19] God or seat of God was the body of Jesus
[6:22] Christ. The Bible said God was in Christ
[6:24] reconciling the world to himself in 2
[6:26] Chronicles 5:1 19. The Bible said in
[6:29] Colossians 2:9 that the fullness of the
[6:32] Godhead bodily dwelt in Christ. After
[6:34] Jesus ascended to heaven, the Holy Ghost
[6:37] fell on the day of Pentecost. And now
[6:39] every true believer becomes a temple of
[6:42] God. This is clearly taught in 1
[6:44] Corinthians 3:16 and 1 Corinthians 6:19.
[6:49] Know ye not that you are the temple of
[6:50] the living God and the spirit of God
[6:52] dwelleth in you? Know ye not your body
[6:54] is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is
[6:56] in you. So the place where the Holy
[6:58] Ghost falls and takes his seat or
[7:00] dwelling place in the believer is the
[7:02] soul. It's a permanent dwelling because
[7:05] we're sealed unto the day of our
[7:07] redemption according to Ephesians 4:30.
[7:10] Believers were now given the Holy Ghost
[7:11] in their souls. According to John 7
[7:13] 38-39, Colossians 1:26-28,
[7:17] Isaiah 11:10, Jesus gives his rest and
[7:20] it will be glorious. And then Paul says
[7:23] in Colossians 1, Christ in you the hope
[7:25] of glory. Matthew 11:28-29
[7:28] speaks of Jesus giving a rest unto our
[7:31] souls. And the Bible said, "We must fear
[7:33] lest we come short of entering into this
[7:35] rest." In Ephesians 4:es 1-12,
[7:39] the language in the New Testament speaks
[7:41] of God's dwelling in the hearts of
[7:42] believers. So sometimes the word heart,
[7:45] remember, represents the emotions, the
[7:47] human spirit. Sometimes it represents
[7:49] the soul. Sometimes the word heart is
[7:51] used for both human spirit and soul
[7:54] together. In other words, the spiritual
[7:55] element to the believer. The believer is
[7:58] both spiritual and physical. And we have
[8:01] three parts. The physical part is the
[8:03] body. And then the spiritual parts are
[8:05] the spirit and the soul according to 1
[8:07] Thessalonians 5:23.
[8:09] So now let's see how the Holy Ghost
[8:11] dwells in our hearts and in heaven.
[8:13] Let's look at the terminology of the
[8:15] dwelling place for the throne of God or
[8:18] the ark of the covenant. In the Old
[8:20] Testament, First Kings 8:30 says here
[8:22] thou in heaven thy dwelling place. So
[8:25] the Old Testament calls God's throne his
[8:28] dwelling place. But now in the New
[8:29] Testament, our soul is called the
[8:31] dwelling place of God. So we're looking
[8:33] at that word dwell again. Ephesians
[8:36] 3:17, that Christ may dwell in your
[8:38] hearts by faith. So God dwells both in
[8:40] heaven and in your heart, your soul.
[8:43] Galatians 4:6, and because ye are sons,
[8:46] God has sent forth the spirit of his son
[8:48] into your hearts, crying, "Aba, Father."
[8:52] So God dwells both in heaven and in the
[8:55] heart of every true believer. Praise the
[8:57] Lord. The next word or the next term I
[8:59] want to look at is the word rule. In the
[9:02] Old Testament, the words throne,
[9:05] kingdom, and ruler are used to speak of
[9:08] God's dwelling. Psalm 103:19 says, "The
[9:11] Lord hath prepared his throne in the
[9:13] heavens, and his kingdom ruleth over
[9:15] all." So God's heavenly throne is
[9:18] likened unto his kingdom. It's a place
[9:20] where he rules from. But now the Bible
[9:23] said God rules in our hearts. Colossians
[9:26] 3:15, "And let the peace of God rule in
[9:29] your hearts." So this is another proof
[9:31] that God's throne is in the heart of the
[9:34] believer, the soul of the believer. He
[9:36] rules in our hearts. And then Luke 17
[9:40] says, "The kingdom of God is within
[9:42] you." So again, the kingdom is where the
[9:44] throne is, as Psalm 103:19 says. So
[9:47] Jesus says, "The kingdom of God is
[9:49] within you." That's the Holy Ghost. Now,
[9:52] let's move on to the next section, the
[9:53] heavenly throne. We know the earthly
[9:57] tabernacle Moses was based upon the
[9:59] pattern he saw in heaven. So Moses's
[10:02] earthly tabernacle was patterned after
[10:04] the heavenly throne or tabernacle
[10:06] according to Hebrews 8:5 and Exodus
[10:08] 25:9. Here's a visual of Clarence
[10:11] Larkin's drawings of the three
[10:13] tabernacles, the human body, the
[10:15] tabernacle Moses, and the heavenly
[10:18] tabernacle. I have Larkin's books. I
[10:21] personally love his books and his
[10:22] drawings, his details, his attention to
[10:25] scripture. Now, in this visual, I added
[10:27] two golden veils just because Larkin
[10:31] didn't have the veils drawn. So, you can
[10:34] see a veil after the sea of glass, and
[10:36] you can see a veil after the seven
[10:38] spirits or lamps of God before you get
[10:41] into the most holy place. Let's start in
[10:44] the outer court. You first have the
[10:46] sacrificial altar. This would have to
[10:48] have burning coals as Isaiah 6 told us.
[10:53] And also the fifth seal of Revelation
[10:55] chapter 6 speaks of this altar. And
[10:59] there's also Jewish believers around
[11:01] this throne, their souls under the altar
[11:04] crying out, "How long, Lord?" Then
[11:07] moving closer in to the temple of God,
[11:09] you have the sea of glass.
[11:12] And Moses represented these with the
[11:14] brazen altar and the labor in his outer
[11:17] court. Moving into the second court
[11:20] called the holy place, we have the
[11:22] golden altar burning with incense. The
[11:24] Bible says this is the prayers of the
[11:26] saints. The Bible says we also have a
[11:28] golden sensor in heaven. Near this
[11:31] golden altar, we have seven lamps
[11:33] burning with fire. This was represented
[11:35] by the seven golden candlesticks in the
[11:37] times of Moses. Also, I believe in the
[11:40] holy place, you have 24 seats for
[11:42] elders. I could be wrong on that, but
[11:44] that's just my thought. And then you
[11:45] have a veil separating the holy place
[11:48] from the most holy place. And lastly, we
[11:51] have the holiest of holies. There are
[11:53] four cherubams or four beasts
[11:56] surrounding the throne of Jesus.
[11:58] Lightnings and thunderings proceed out
[12:00] of the throne. And friends, I could be
[12:02] wrong on this, but I believe Jesus's
[12:04] throne is also considered to be an ark
[12:07] of the covenant because in Revelation
[12:10] 11:1 19, the Bible said the temple of
[12:13] God was open in heaven and there was
[12:14] seen in his temple the ark of his
[12:16] testament. So there is an ark of the
[12:19] covenant up in heaven. I believe that's
[12:21] Jesus' throne because in Moses
[12:24] tabernacle, you had the ark of the
[12:25] covenant and the mercy seat was the top
[12:28] lid of the ark of the covenant. So I
[12:29] believe Jesus sits on heaven's mercy
[12:32] seat and there he makes intercession to
[12:35] the father for us. Hebrews 6:19 says our
[12:40] hope is an anchor of the soul and enters
[12:42] into that within the veil. So our hope
[12:47] enters into the holiest of holies in
[12:49] heaven. What a wonderful promise. And
[12:52] that's where the Bible said Jesus is
[12:54] seated there appearing in the presence
[12:56] of God for us. According to Hebrews
[12:58] 9:24,
[13:00] Hebrews 9:3 says Moses tabernacle had
[13:04] two veils. So it's likely heaven has two
[13:07] veils as well. One before the holy place
[13:10] and one before the holiest of holies.
[13:13] So heaven's tabernacle remains until the
[13:17] time of the new Jerusalem. Now even
[13:19] during the millennium I believe there
[13:20] will be a heavenly tabernacle but there
[13:22] will also be a physical tabernacle God's
[13:25] throne in Jerusalem where Jesus will
[13:28] judge all the nations rule the nations
[13:30] with a rod of iron for a thousand years.
[13:32] So God will have a earthly throne during
[13:34] the millennium and also a heavenly
[13:36] throne. But then during the new
[13:38] Jerusalem heaven comes down to earth.
[13:41] Heaven and earth unite and the Bible
[13:43] says there will be no temple. The Bible
[13:45] says the final throne of God will be on
[13:48] the top of the new Jerusalem. Revelation
[13:50] 22 says a river will proceed out of the
[13:53] throne of God and of the lamb. So the
[13:56] final throne of God is at the top of the
[13:58] new Jerusalem. Scripture teaches there
[14:01] is a final throne. That's the throne of
[14:03] God and the lamb and the new Jerusalem.
[14:05] And scripture teaches there is no more
[14:07] temple because the Lord God Almighty and
[14:10] the Lamb are the temple of the new
[14:12] Jerusalem. Let's go to Revelation 21:22.
[14:16] The final section will be the glorious
[14:17] time and glorious revelation brother
[14:20] Brandham had about the throne of God.
[14:22] This is taken from brother Bam's sermon,
[14:24] Revelation chapter 4, part three,
[14:27] January 8th, 1961. Brother Ram said, "I
[14:30] was sitting the other day and saw this.
[14:31] I just jumped up and run around and
[14:33] around and around the chair saying
[14:35] glory, glory, glory, glory, around and
[14:37] around." He said, "Oh, I just had a
[14:39] glorious time." Let's listen to the
[14:41] quote. sitting the other day and saw
[14:43] this. I just jumped up and run around
[14:44] around the chair saying glory glory
[14:46] glory glory glory round around round
[14:48] Charlie I course you up in the woods
[14:50] sometime sister if I act like that you
[14:52] run me out I house
[14:55] oh I just had a glorious time now watch
[14:57] what it was what the Lord did now
[15:00] &gt;&gt; so what is this glorious revelation the
[15:02] revelation is that God's throne in
[15:04] heaven is guarded with four throne
[15:07] guards the four cherubam or the four
[15:09] beasts each one like an unto a lion man,
[15:13] calf, man, flying eagle. So, brother Ram
[15:17] said the revelation is that God's throne
[15:19] in heaven has guards and brother Ram
[15:22] says God's presence on earth has guards.
[15:25] Brother Ram says God's presence on earth
[15:27] is the book of acts church represented
[15:29] by the book of acts from the bible and
[15:32] has four guards which are the four
[15:34] gospels of the lord Jesus Christ.
[15:36] Brother Ram gave two examples of how the
[15:39] book of Acts is guarded by the four
[15:42] gospels. The first example was salvation
[15:45] and water baptism. He said the book of
[15:47] Acts teaches the water baptism and
[15:49] salvation in the name of the Lord Jesus
[15:51] Christ according to Acts 2:38 and
[15:53] numerous other baptism verses. But
[15:55] brother Ram notices how all four gospels
[15:58] protect the revelation of salvation and
[16:01] water baptism through the name of the
[16:03] Lord Jesus Christ. He starts in Matthew
[16:06] 1:18 and shows how the name of the son
[16:09] is Jesus. Then Matthew 73 and 14 speak
[16:14] of enter in ye at the straight gate.
[16:18] Then Matthew 28:19 baptize them in the
[16:20] name one name of the father and of the
[16:22] son and of the holy ghost. And of course
[16:25] 10 days later Peter said baptize in the
[16:27] name of the lord Jesus Christ.
[16:30] Mark protects this revelation because
[16:31] Jesus said, "Whosoever believeth and is
[16:34] baptized shall be saved." Luke supports
[16:37] this revelation or protects the
[16:38] revelation because he said, "Repentance
[16:41] and remission of sin should be preached
[16:44] in his name." So, one name again, the
[16:46] name of the Lord Jesus Christ in Luke
[16:48] 24:47. And John 3:23 shows when John
[16:53] baptized, he baptized because there was
[16:54] much water there. So this protects the
[16:57] revelation of full immersion in water
[16:59] not sprinkling.
[17:02] And the second subject brother Ram says
[17:04] is protected is divine healing. In
[17:07] Matthew 10:1 the disciples are given
[17:10] power to heal the sick. In Mark 16 15-17
[17:15] Jesus said these signs will follow them
[17:17] that believe. They'll lay hands on the
[17:19] sick. They shall recover. They will cast
[17:21] out devils.
[17:23] Luke supports divine healing. Luke 10
[17:25] again is the sending out of Jesus's 12
[17:28] apostles with power to heal. John 14:12
[17:33] Jesus said, "The works that I do shall
[17:35] ye do also. Greater works than these
[17:38] shall you do because I go to my father."
[17:40] That greater means more works, not
[17:43] greater because no one could do greater
[17:44] works than the Lord Jesus Christ. And
[17:47] brother Random taught John 15:7 as well.
[17:49] If you abide in me and my words abide in
[17:51] you, you shall ask what you will and it
[17:53] shall be done unto you.
[17:56] &gt;&gt; Now remember, God's got some guards for
[17:58] that for that mercy seat. What is that
[18:01] mercy seat guard? All right.
[18:04] M
[18:06] A D H Matthew
[18:09] on the east,
[18:12] Luke,
[18:14] Mark,
[18:16] John,
[18:18] all of their four gospels vindicate the
[18:23] book of Acts to come.
[18:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:25] &gt;&gt; They guard it anywhere you want to look
[18:27] at it. Let's just take one. Just one. We
[18:30] ain't got time. I got 20 you borrow
[18:31] wrote down here, but let's just take one
[18:34] on this subject for salvation. Now,
[18:37] let's take and see if Matthew up here
[18:39] now will guard it for divine healing.
[18:43] Got your pencils and hand you're writing
[18:45] this down. All right. See if Matthew
[18:47] divides divine will guard. Let's take
[18:50] Matthew
[18:52] 10 and one.
[18:55] &gt;&gt; In closing, friends, hope this video was
[18:58] a blessing by the grace of God. So where
[19:00] is God? God is both in heaven and in our
[19:02] hearts at the same time by his
[19:05] omnipotence. His temple is both in
[19:07] heaven and in our souls now by the
[19:09] baptism of the Holy Ghost. His temple
[19:12] will also return during the millennium.
[19:13] But his final temple of course will be
[19:16] the body of the Lord Jesus Christ in the
[19:18] new Jerusalem. Let us do what Ephesians
[19:21] 4:30 says. Grieve not the Holy Spirit of
[19:23] God whereby you're sealed to the day of
[19:26] our redemption. The word grieve in the
[19:28] Greek means to offend. Let's not offend
[19:30] the Holy Ghost. If we do, let's confess
[19:33] our sins quickly. We know we sin every
[19:36] day. So, let's quickly confess our
[19:38] offenses to the Holy Spirit that the
[19:39] Holy Spirit can come back on us, anoint
[19:42] us for the glory of God, that the Holy
[19:44] Ghost might dwell in our hearts, rule
[19:46] our lives, help us to win souls for the
[19:48] kingdom of God, help our souls to be
[19:51] made ready for the millennium and the
[19:53] future home. I think the last thing I'll
[19:55] say is if you want Jesus Christ to dwell
[19:58] in your heart, all you have to do is
[20:00] repent of your sins and mean it with all
[20:03] your heart. Repent means to turn away,
[20:06] change your mind, and make amends for
[20:08] your sin. So if Jesus is not on the
[20:11] throne of your heart now, repent of your
[20:12] sins. Do everything in your power to
[20:15] overcome sin. God will help you. He'll
[20:17] sanctify you. He'll clean you out. You
[20:20] get saved first with justification. And
[20:21] then God sanctifies you, which means
[20:24] purifies your daily life and habits and
[20:26] your mind. And then he'll fill your soul
[20:28] with the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Even
[20:31] when you repent, God's spirit will dwell
[20:33] in your heart, dwell in your emotions.
[20:35] He'll dwell in your human spirit. He'll
[20:38] continue doing that through
[20:39] sanctification. But once you're baptized
[20:41] with the Holy Ghost, it's a permanent
[20:43] dwelling or ruling of God's spirit in
[20:46] your soul. And that lasts until the day
[20:49] of your redemption.

[21:02] I'm
[21:03] &gt;&gt; very happy to be here this afternoon and
[21:04] again in defense of the gospel of Jesus
[21:07] Christ to bring the good tidings, the
[21:10] good news that Jesus raised from the
[21:12] dead, living among man today, his
[21:14] church. The same Jesus that was
[21:17] yesterday will be today and forever.
[21:20] is never fail.
