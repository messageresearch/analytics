[0:00] [Music]
[0:03] you just got to mark it down we are
[0:06] coming into a religious persecution with
[0:10] the same things that they did in Pagan
[0:12] Rome many years ago for thus sayith the
[0:17] Lord greetings friends in the matchless
[0:20] name of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[0:22] purpose of this video is to respond to a
[0:25] viewer's question about what were my
[0:27] thoughts on the results from the 202 for
[0:30] US presidential election so in this
[0:32] video I'll share my thoughts on that and
[0:35] also where I think we are prophetically
[0:38] in Revelation to the Rapture hi friends
[0:40] I'm Jesse Smith pastor bride of Christ
[0:42] Fellowship here in akan Ohio USA and I
[0:44] defend the original Gospel of the Lord
[0:46] Jesus Christ that he revealed to St Paul
[0:48] and then had to restore through Martin
[0:49] Luther John Wesley and the late Prophet
[0:51] William Marin and brandham I also defend
[0:54] brother Rams Godly Christian character
[0:56] so in this video I'll go through my
[0:57] reactions second Where We Are
[1:00] prophetically according to my humble
[1:01] opinion and third other
[1:04] thoughts so first of all my reaction to
[1:07] the results of President Trump getting
[1:10] reelected my first reaction was I was
[1:13] totally surprised and I was surprised
[1:15] because of what happened in 2020 I
[1:17] thought it was going to be a repeat
[1:19] remember in 2020 the results were
[1:21] delayed 4 days and there was many ballot
[1:24] drops so I got to be careful what words
[1:26] I use here on YouTube but it seems like
[1:28] there were some strange things happening
[1:30] with the 2020 presidential election
[1:32] there were massive ballot drops in the
[1:34] middle of the night and all the ballot
[1:37] drops seemed to go in the same direction
[1:39] So based upon all those strange things
[1:40] that happened in the 2020 election I
[1:43] thought it would repeat but I would say
[1:44] I was pleasantly surprised to see
[1:46] President Trump reelected of course
[1:48] mainly because of his stance for Israel
[1:51] remember he moved the American Embassy
[1:53] to Jerusalem during his first term and
[1:55] the Bible says anyone that blesses
[1:57] Israel God will bless
[2:00] that could also be why it seems
[2:02] president Trump's life was spared from
[2:04] the multiple assassination attempts upon
[2:07] his life so yes first I was surprised
[2:10] that President Trump won in a landslide
[2:12] I'm very grateful though because from
[2:14] 2021 to
[2:16] 20124 Democrats carried out probably
[2:19] what was the worst Christian persecution
[2:21] in United States history here in the
[2:24] United States it began with cancel
[2:26] culture and then the federal agencies
[2:29] seemed to be we ized against President
[2:31] Trump and not only him but many
[2:33] conservatives even individuals who would
[2:35] just pray outside of certain clinics and
[2:38] again I have to be very careful what I
[2:39] say Here on YouTube and also there were
[2:41] innocent protesters wrongfully arrested
[2:44] and all this has been proven over the
[2:46] course of these last four years so
[2:48] that's my first reaction just surprised
[2:51] it's also important to keep in mind that
[2:53] President Trump has not been inaugurated
[2:55] yet that's January 20th if I'm not
[2:57] mistaken so so anything could happen
[2:59] before that time we we don't know for
[3:01] sure so moving on to where we are
[3:04] prophetically I recently put out a video
[3:06] about are there any verses Left to be
[3:08] fulfilled before the Rapture and of
[3:10] course I believe there are brother
[3:11] random said that in spoken word Original
[3:13] Seed 1962 so as ministers were doing our
[3:16] best to see where we are prophetically
[3:17] by the scriptures we know there are
[3:19] still Jews returning to their Homeland
[3:21] to fulfill Jeremiah 31:10 so that's
[3:23] still being
[3:24] fulfilled we know the Great Commission
[3:27] to the Gentiles to save Gentiles with
[3:29] the gopel of Jesus Christ is still being
[3:31] fulfilled as I said in my previous video
[3:33] you know last year I just saw 17 former
[3:36] Amish Believers be baptized in the name
[3:38] of the Lord Jesus Christ and receive
[3:40] this message so they're receiving the
[3:42] former Reign which is brother br's
[3:43] Ministry from Joel 223 through
[3:46] 26 brother bram's Ministry is the former
[3:49] Reign and then the latter Reign is
[3:50] rapturing Faith that's all what we're
[3:52] waiting for that's all what we're
[3:53] longing for to have faith to have our
[3:55] bodies change in a moment twinkling of
[3:57] an eye so we can see the Great
[4:00] Commission to the Gentiles is still
[4:02] being fulfilled Revelation 10 8-11
[4:04] Matthew
[4:06] 2414 Luke 2124 and 2 Peter
[4:10] 3:9 thirdly and probably most easily to
[4:13] see is Matthew 24 6-8 all these birth
[4:16] pains are still going to continue as I
[4:19] said earlier 2021 2024 under this
[4:23] current United States leadership has
[4:25] been the hardest birth pain against
[4:27] Christians Matthew 24 6-8 says says
[4:29] there'll be Wars rumors of wars
[4:31] earthquakes in diverse places
[4:33] pestilences which I believe Co fulfilled
[4:35] and so one possibility is that if they
[4:37] do allow president Trump to be
[4:39] inaugurated and serve out his ter this
[4:41] could be a time of a relaxation from the
[4:43] birth pains a time of rest in between
[4:46] contractions but I don't know for sure
[4:48] again we don't know what's going to
[4:49] happen but we know there's Wars still
[4:51] going on right Israel Hamas Russia
[4:53] Ukraine so these are all birth pains
[4:56] leading up to the birth of a new day the
[4:59] millenni and of course The Birth of a
[5:01] Nation Israel being birthed by the
[5:03] baptism of the Holy Ghost 144,000 Jews
[5:06] being sealed in their foreheads then
[5:08] fourth and finally this main scripture
[5:10] brother Ram gave us Revelation
[5:12] 13:16 he causes all the Beast causes all
[5:16] to take a mark so they cannot buy or
[5:18] sell without the mark brother R use this
[5:20] verse to show the bride will be forced
[5:22] to stop preaching before the Rapture I
[5:25] believe someday the real bride of Christ
[5:30] will
[5:33] be forced to stop preaching the word of
[5:38] God the Bible prophesies of it in
[5:41] Revelations 13:16 if you want to put it
[5:43] down denominations will force it to stop
[5:47] or take its
[5:50] Mark then when the lamb will take his
[5:54] bride and judge the for
[5:57] this this is the main verse I'm looking
[5:59] for for to be fulfilled right before the
[6:02] Rapture this will tell me the squeezes
[6:04] on when message preachers are forced to
[6:07] stop preaching I still have the freedom
[6:08] to preach thank God for that praise God
[6:10] for the freedoms that we have but this
[6:12] verse helps us see where we are
[6:13] prophetically if we're still preaching
[6:15] then we know there's still a little more
[6:17] labor to be done in the fields people
[6:19] are still being saved people are still
[6:20] being filled with the Holy Ghost people
[6:22] are still being delivered and healed by
[6:24] Divine Healing and miracles God's truth
[6:27] is still marching on so these scriptures
[6:29] help us see where we are prophetically
[6:31] there's still more work to be done God
[6:33] is still saving God is still healing God
[6:35] wants us to keep preaching the gospel
[6:36] Jews are still returning to their
[6:38] Homeland and so
[6:39] forth and so then finally here's some
[6:41] other
[6:42] thoughts perhaps if God does allow Trump
[6:46] to take office and fulfill this term
[6:48] perhaps this is a time for the religious
[6:51] unity of the Beast to be fulfilled I'm
[6:54] not sure but that's what it looks like
[6:56] it could be brother Ram tells us the
[6:58] squeeze will come
[7:00] when the World Council of churches
[7:02] unites with the United States government
[7:04] in order to change the laws the
[7:06] Temptation will come as follows The
[7:09] ecumenical move that has started on what
[7:11] seems such a beautiful and blessed
[7:13] principle fulfilling Christ's prayer
[7:15] that we all might be one becomes so
[7:18] strong politically that she Bears
[7:20] pressure upon the government to cause
[7:22] all to join with her either directly or
[7:24] through adherence to principles enacted
[7:26] into law so that no people will be re
[7:29] recognized as actual churches unless
[7:31] under direct or indirect domination of
[7:33] this Council little groups will lose
[7:36] Charters privileges Etc until they lose
[7:39] all property and spiritual rights with
[7:41] the people for example right now unless
[7:44] the local Ministerial Association
[7:46] approves in many if not most cities one
[7:48] cannot rent a building for religious
[7:50] services to become chaplain in the armed
[7:53] services hospitals Etc it is now almost
[7:56] mandatory to be recognized as acceptable
[7:58] to the trinitarian ecumenical
[8:00] groups as this pressure increases and it
[8:03] will it will be harder to resist for to
[8:06] resist is to lose privilege and so many
[8:09] will be tempted to go along for they
[8:10] will feel it is better to serve God
[8:12] publicly in the framework of this
[8:14] organization then not to serve God at
[8:16] all publicly but they er to believe the
[8:20] devil's lie is to serve Satan even
[8:23] though you may want to call him Jehovah
[8:25] but the elect will not be
[8:27] deceived furthermore the elect will not
[8:30] only be kept but as this move becomes
[8:32] the image erected to the Beast the
[8:35] Saints will be gone in the Rapture and
[8:38] this little delightful Winsome movement
[8:40] that started out in fellowship at
[8:42] Ephesus will become the monster of Satan
[8:44] that defiles and deceives the whole
[8:46] world for the church system of the Roman
[8:49] Catholic and the Protestant in coming
[8:51] together will control the whole wealth
[8:53] of the world system and force the whole
[8:55] earth into its religious trap or will
[8:57] kill them by refusing them the privilege
[9:00] of buying and selling whereby they would
[9:02] make a living this will be accomplished
[9:05] simply for the harlot's daughters are
[9:07] all but gone back to her in the meantime
[9:10] Rome has acquired nearly all the
[9:12] supplies of gold the Jews have the bonds
[9:15] and all the paper at the right time the
[9:17] Harlot will destroy the present day
[9:19] money system by calling in all the paper
[9:21] and demanding gold with no gold the
[9:24] system Falls the Jews will be trapped
[9:26] and come into the alliance and the
[9:28] Harlot Church will take over the whole
[9:30] world so perhaps these conservative
[9:33] leaders getting in Trump and JD Vance
[9:35] perhaps that's a a sign that that
[9:38] religions are going to unite more and
[9:39] more it's possible because one thing I
[9:41] noticed was JD Vance is a Catholic and
[9:44] his wife is Hindu and I saw a video I
[9:47] just can't find it but I saw a video of
[9:48] them saying they're all going towards
[9:50] the same place or they're all on the
[9:52] same path or something like that that's
[9:54] the deception of
[9:56] universalism the Hindu gods are not true
[9:59] gods there's only one God that's the
[10:00] Lord Jesus Christ and so that could be
[10:03] one reason God allowed Trump to get in
[10:05] no doubt because he honors Israel but
[10:06] also because people have to be anointed
[10:09] to fulfill the rest of the scripture
[10:10] which is the religious unity the one
[10:12] world religion that must eventually come
[10:14] upon the Earth it's also important to
[10:16] keep in mind brother Ram said with thus
[10:18] sayith the Lord that the same Roman
[10:20] persecution that was upon the early
[10:21] Christians will repeat here in the
[10:23] United States so it seems like as we've
[10:26] seen 3 or 4 years of Christian
[10:28] persecution through weaponized
[10:31] departments in the federal government
[10:33] perhaps that was the first birth pain
[10:35] towards the Christian persecution that
[10:37] brother Bram prophesied of and also
[10:40] what's prophesied in Revelation 13 so
[10:42] let's listen that quote from brother
[10:43] brandom it's thus sayith the lord well
[10:45] you just got to mark it down we are
[10:48] coming into a religious persecution with
[10:52] the same things that they did in Pagan
[10:54] Rome many years ago for it's thus sayeth
[10:58] the Lord
[10:59] also friends remember brother BR told us
[11:01] to watch the purple curtain watch Russia
[11:03] so we're doing that as well so these are
[11:06] my thoughts on the results from the 2024
[11:08] election here in the United States of
[11:10] course I'd like to hear your thoughts as
[11:12] well many times the comments are very
[11:14] helpful perhaps I'll make a part two on
[11:16] this video we'll see how the comments go
[11:18] by God's grace but I appreciate this
[11:20] question I thought I'd share it perhaps
[11:22] it'd be a blessing to the Saints by the
[11:24] grace of God remember the Lord Jesus
[11:26] Christ tells us to always watch and pray
[11:29] that will be worthy to escape the
[11:31] judgments that will come upon the Earth
[11:32] of course the Bride of Jesus Christ will
[11:33] be forgiven she'll be purged during her
[11:36] life she'll be cleansed during her life
[11:38] so she won't need Purge during the Great
[11:39] Tribulation period thank God for the
[11:41] blood of Jesus Christ if you have any
[11:44] questions or concerns or testimonies
[11:45] about this video please contact
[11:47] me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[11:50] the desire of your heart
