[0:00] [Music]
[0:06] greetings friends in the mattress name
[0:09] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[0:12] the purpose of this video is to prove
[0:15] hopefully by God's grace once and for
[0:18] all that the Lord Jesus Christ revealed
[0:20] the revelation of the third seal to
[0:22] God's Prophet brother William Branham
[0:24] and brother bran did not plagiarize the
[0:27] third seal from Charles Tay's Russell
[0:29] Clarence Larkin nor Uriah Smith
[0:32] so the outline for the video will be
[0:34] first we'll look at the third seal and
[0:36] compare brother brahm's Revelation to
[0:38] Charles Russell Clarence Larkin and
[0:41] Uriah Smith
[0:42] and then second we'll look at some of
[0:44] the YouTube comments and also a dream
[0:49] the third seal
[0:52] let's begin with the accusation against
[0:54] God's Prophet brother William Branham
[0:56] earlier this year in April one of
[0:59] brotherbraham's accusers on his YouTube
[1:00] channel
[1:02] said quote why did William Branham take
[1:04] the words of Charles Russell and
[1:06] Proclaim them as God's message end quote
[1:10] and of course this is a false accusation
[1:13] against God's true Prophet brother
[1:15] Branham this accuser of brother Branham
[1:18] made a one minute and 29 second video
[1:21] about the third seal
[1:23] but know how brother Ram's accuser took
[1:26] so little time to explain the third seal
[1:29] making a one minute and 29 second video
[1:33] and contrast that with brother branham's
[1:36] sermon of two hours and nearly 11
[1:38] minutes on the topic of the third seal
[1:41] and also two pages that Charles Taze
[1:44] Russell wrote about the third seal
[1:47] as I study the topic of the third seal I
[1:49] found that brother Braham did agree with
[1:51] Charles Tay's Russell on three
[1:53] statements or three details about the
[1:56] third seal yet brother Branham disagreed
[1:58] with seven other details about the third
[2:01] seal proving brother Ram did not
[2:03] plagiarize Charles Tays Russell
[2:05] and friends just like the example I gave
[2:07] on the second seal video if I was
[2:09] writing about the American Revolution
[2:11] from the 18th century and Aid of my
[2:14] details about the American Revolution
[2:16] were different from any other source
[2:18] such as the Encyclopedia Britannica I
[2:21] would not be guilty of plagiarism and so
[2:23] it is with God's Prophet brother Branham
[2:26] these seven differences brother Branham
[2:28] disagreed with Russell on are
[2:31] significant differences that cannot be
[2:33] ignored and prove once and for all that
[2:35] brother Brown did not plagiarize Charles
[2:36] Taze Russell Clarence Larkin nor Uriah
[2:39] Smith
[2:40] let's begin by looking at the screenshot
[2:42] of the accusation from the video of one
[2:45] of brotherbraham's accusers
[2:47] here's a screenshot of a quote from
[2:49] Brother Branham that the accuser used
[2:52] and notice it's three words same writer
[2:55] now
[2:56] notice this accuser used three words out
[2:59] of brotherbraham's two-hour and nearly
[3:02] 11-minute sermon
[3:03] so I can't say for sure but it seems
[3:05] like brother Ram's accuser is trying to
[3:07] purposely slander brother Branham
[3:10] because he used so little of brother
[3:12] Ram's teaching on the third seal
[3:16] now here's a screenshot of the quote
[3:18] from Charles Tays Russell that brother
[3:19] Ram's accuser used
[3:21] while it's true both men said the same
[3:24] writer and agreed on two other details
[3:26] remember they disagreed on eight other
[3:28] details about the third seal and I'll
[3:31] show how little of Russell's work the
[3:34] accuser actually used
[3:37] so here's a screenshot of the two pages
[3:41] Charles says Russell wrote about the
[3:43] third seal highlighted in blue is the
[3:45] section on the third seal
[3:48] notice highlighted in yellow are the
[3:50] quotes they cited on their video notice
[3:53] what a small portion of information
[3:55] about the third seal the accuser
[3:57] actually used
[3:59] so they used about three sentences or
[4:01] less and ignored the rest of Russell's
[4:04] details about the third seal notice
[4:07] again how little research these
[4:09] so-called researchers actually used
[4:13] and friends let me just say the elect of
[4:15] God cannot be deceived by such weak and
[4:18] shoddy research as this accuser used all
[4:22] I can say is thank you Lord Jesus that
[4:24] the elect cannot be deceived
[4:26] now let's look at the rest of Russell's
[4:28] teaching on the third seal why did the
[4:31] accuser brother Branham omit the rest of
[4:33] Russell's work was it because he wanted
[4:35] to purposely slander God's Prophet
[4:37] brother Branham that seems a likely
[4:40] answer but again I don't know for sure
[4:42] only God knows his heart
[4:45] let's examine 10 details about the third
[4:47] seal and we'll see that brother Branham
[4:49] differed with Russell on 7 out of the
[4:51] ten details
[4:53] again proving brother Bram did not
[4:55] plagiarize Charles Tays Russell
[4:58] beginning with the timing Charles
[5:00] Russell said the timing of the third
[5:02] seal was synchronous to Revelation 2
[5:05] verses 12-17
[5:11] which was his pergamos church age or
[5:15] pergamian church age which was from 325
[5:18] to 1160.
[5:21] and note that Russell said Arius was the
[5:24] messenger to his pergamian church age
[5:27] and of course this differs from brother
[5:28] Brandon brother Branham said the third
[5:30] seal took place during the thyatiran
[5:32] Sardis and Philadelphia Church ages and
[5:36] The Messengers were Columba
[5:38] Martin Luther and John Wesley
[5:41] and for the timing brother Ram said
[5:42] quote he has started writing him in the
[5:45] time of the Dark Ages end quote
[5:48] so here's a visual and you can see how
[5:51] Russell's third seal lasted from 539 to
[5:55] 1160 A.D Russell said it's synchronous
[5:58] to Revelation 2 verses 12-17 so it
[6:02] lasted from 539 to 1160 A.D
[6:06] through the details brother Ram gives it
[6:08] seems his third seal lasted from 1095
[6:11] the beginning of the Dark Ages to 1906
[6:14] the beginning of the prophetic age of
[6:16] the eagle anointing the last Church age
[6:19] the laosian church age
[6:22] and the conclusion is brother Ram did
[6:23] not plagiarize Charles Tay's Russell
[6:25] brother Ram's third seal started almost
[6:27] 500 years after Russell's and brother
[6:30] random's third seal ended about 800
[6:33] years after Charles Tay's Russell's
[6:38] second the black horse
[6:43] Russell said the black horse was quote
[6:45] ugly Creeds and Bulls of popes and
[6:47] councils end quote
[6:50] and there on your screen you can see the
[6:51] screenshot of Russell's quote on the
[6:55] ugly Creeds that represented the black
[6:57] horse
[6:58] this is not what brother Ram taught
[7:00] brother random said the black horse was
[7:02] the Dark Ages he said quote that's what
[7:04] the Dark Horse represented the dark ages
[7:07] for it was a time of midnight to the
[7:09] True Believers that was left end quote
[7:15] thank you
[7:16] the third detail brother Ram did agree
[7:18] with Charles Tay's Russell it was the
[7:21] detail of the writer Russell said the
[7:24] writer was the Antichrist
[7:28] and brother Ram said it was the same
[7:30] writer
[7:35] but again notice that Russell had a 50
[7:37] chance to get this right in other words
[7:39] the writer was either Jesus or Satan and
[7:43] so with that 50 percent probability
[7:45] Russell got it right
[7:47] on the fourth out of 10 details we have
[7:49] the third difference between brother
[7:51] Branham and Russell Russell said the
[7:53] balances in the hand of the writer were
[7:55] a symbol of scarcity and here's a
[7:58] screenshot of that quote
[8:00] he had a pair of balances in his hand
[8:02] balance joined with symbols of denoting
[8:04] the sale of corn and fruits by weight
[8:07] becomes the symbol of scarcity bred by
[8:09] weight being a curse
[8:12] in the VPS 2626 and in Ezekiel 4 verses
[8:15] 16 and 17 end quote
[8:19] and then he continued quote during this
[8:21] period the common people could have in
[8:23] their own tongue only a few words or
[8:25] verses of the scriptures and for these
[8:27] they were obliged to pay large sums to
[8:30] the clergy who alone had the ability to
[8:32] translate from the dead languages or
[8:34] even to read it all as the services were
[8:36] enlightened the people were starved
[8:38] spiritually end quote
[8:41] regarding the balances brother Branham
[8:43] taught differently than Russell he said
[8:45] quote his balances or his skills in his
[8:47] hand what it means that he was charging
[8:50] his subjects for the kind of the hope of
[8:52] life that he was sending out to them by
[8:54] making
[8:55] he started in that very time of making
[8:57] them pay for prayer charging for prayer
[8:59] they still do it novenas because what
[9:02] was he doing capturing the wealth of the
[9:04] world end quote
[9:07] on the 5th out of 10 details brother
[9:10] Branham and Russell agreed regarding the
[9:13] voice in the midst both Russell and
[9:15] brother Branham said it had to be Jesus
[9:17] so this is their second out of three
[9:19] details that they agreed upon
[9:21] out of the 10 details
[9:23] and of course Russell again had a 50
[9:25] chance to get this right what other
[9:27] voice One Voice could be in the midst of
[9:30] the Throne of God it had to be the voice
[9:32] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[9:36] on the sixth detail regarding the wheat
[9:38] it's the fourth difference between
[9:40] brother Branham and Russell
[9:42] Russell said the wheat was quote the
[9:44] true Children of the kingdom and you can
[9:46] see it on the screen here
[9:48] brother Ram did not say this brother
[9:50] Branham said the wheat was quote making
[9:52] them pay for prayer charging for prayer
[9:54] they still do it novenas because what
[9:57] was he doing capturing the wealth of the
[9:59] world end quote and also brother Adam
[10:01] said it was paying for prayers to get
[10:03] out of purgatory from the third seal
[10:07] on the seventh detail regarding the oil
[10:10] brother Branham and Russell agreed for
[10:13] the most part so this is their third and
[10:15] final agreement out of the 10 details on
[10:18] the third seal
[10:19] Russell said the oil was the Holy Spirit
[10:22] of full submission to the will of God
[10:26] brother Branham basically agreed he said
[10:29] quote now oil typifies Spirit end quote
[10:33] and of course brother Brown was
[10:34] referring to the baptism of the Holy
[10:36] Ghost that the disciples received on the
[10:38] day of Pentecost in Acts chapter 2 verse
[10:40] 4.
[10:41] on the eighth detail regarding wine it's
[10:44] the fifth difference between brother
[10:46] Branham and Russell Russell said quote
[10:48] wine is a symbol of Doctrine true or
[10:51] false and its accompanying Joys end
[10:53] quote
[10:55] so brother Brandon agreed it was Joy but
[10:57] never limited the oil to just Doctrine
[10:59] brother Randall said it was stimulation
[11:01] of revelation of any promised word of
[11:03] God such as with the prophecy of Joel 2
[11:06] 28 which was fulfilled on the day of
[11:08] Pentecost
[11:09] which Russell never wrote about
[11:11] regarding the third seal brother Ram
[11:13] said quote when the truth of a promised
[11:16] word has been truly revealed to his
[11:18] Saint that's filled with oil they all
[11:20] get stimulated
[11:21] wine is a stimulation Glory I feel it
[11:24] right now stimulated with joy shouts and
[11:26] when it does it has the same effect upon
[11:28] them that that wine has upon a natural
[11:30] man because when the Revelation has been
[11:33] given of a truth of God and the True
[11:34] Believer filled with oil and the
[11:36] Revelation is revealed the stimulation
[11:38] becomes so great that it makes him
[11:39] behave his self unnormally end quote
[11:45] on the ninth detail out of ten regarding
[11:47] the Beast which was the man it's the
[11:50] sixth difference between Branham and
[11:52] Russell
[11:53] Russell said this man Beast was quote
[11:56] infinite love end quote
[12:00] well the Rams had this third Beast was
[12:02] the wisdom of man
[12:04] quote nor the man-like Beast of wisdom
[12:06] representing the reformers Luther and
[12:09] Wesley and so forth it wasn't revealed
[12:11] end quote
[12:13] notice brother Brown said this Beast
[12:15] related to the Reformation period but
[12:17] Russell's third seal ended well before
[12:19] the Reformation in 1160 A.D over 400
[12:23] years prior to the Reformation
[12:25] so of course these are not the same this
[12:27] is not plagiarism
[12:30] on the 10th and final detail regarding
[12:32] the emphasis it's the seventh difference
[12:34] between Branham and Russell
[12:37] Russell's emphasis was on the complete
[12:40] Triumph of Satan Russell said this was
[12:43] the age of quote the Apparently complete
[12:46] Triumph of the powers of darkness and
[12:48] the apparent inaction of infinite love
[12:50] in permitting it end quote
[12:54] this is shocking to see Russell say this
[12:57] completely wrong Satan never has and
[13:00] never will completely triumph over God's
[13:03] love
[13:04] and God will never permit his holy
[13:06] spirit to be completely triumphed over
[13:09] so we can see this was a huge mistake on
[13:11] the part of Russell and again it's a sad
[13:13] thing that brother Ryan's accusers never
[13:15] mentioned this teaching from Charles
[13:17] Tays Russell
[13:20] brother Ram never called the third seal
[13:21] a complete Triumph of Satan brother Ram
[13:24] did say it was the darkest age the
[13:27] program said Jesus would protect the
[13:28] elect by stimulation of Revelation which
[13:31] was the wine and oil which is the Holy
[13:33] Ghost baptism despite the Dark Ages
[13:36] and this anointing saved the world
[13:38] brother Ram literally said the anointing
[13:40] of the man saved the world so the saints
[13:43] were not triumphed over
[13:45] and Friends how could God permit
[13:47] complete triumph over himself over his
[13:49] own beast and notice brother Brandon
[13:51] said the third seal was during the time
[13:52] of the Reformation Russell did not say
[13:55] that Russell's third seal ended 400
[13:58] years before the Reformation
[14:00] and in Russell's teaching he said the
[14:02] Reformation was for the Philadelphian
[14:04] age only
[14:06] and Russell said Luther was the
[14:08] messenger to Philadelphia but the RAM
[14:10] said Luther was the messenger to Sardis
[14:12] and Wesley was the messenger to
[14:14] Philadelphia
[14:16] as a final summary brother Ram did not
[14:19] plagiarize
[14:20] I found at least seven differences on
[14:23] the third seal itself
[14:24] meaning there are 19 total differences
[14:26] so far on the first three seals because
[14:29] there were six differences a piece on
[14:31] the first and second seal and now there
[14:33] are seven differences on the third seal
[14:37] now let's look at brother Branham and
[14:38] Clarence Larkin
[14:41] here's a screenshot of Larkin's third
[14:43] seal
[14:46] now the timing and the identity of the
[14:48] writer for Clarence Larkin the timing
[14:50] was during the Great Tribulation period
[14:52] or Daniel's 70th week which was the same
[14:54] as the first and second seals and he
[14:57] said the third seal was during a time of
[14:59] War during the Great Tribulation period
[15:02] and again the writer is the same person
[15:04] it's the person of the Antichrist during
[15:06] the Great Tribulation period or Daniel's
[15:08] 70th week
[15:09] Larkin calls him the conserver of food
[15:13] now brother bran never said this brother
[15:14] never said the third horse rider was the
[15:16] conserver of food
[15:18] brother Branham called him the
[15:20] Antichrist spirit in the pope and of
[15:22] course the Roman Catholic Church during
[15:24] the Dark Ages so for the timing here's a
[15:27] screenshot of the difference between
[15:29] brother Branham and Clarence Larkin
[15:32] so brother Brandon's third seal started
[15:34] over a thousand years before Larkins
[15:36] because Larkin's third seal hasn't even
[15:38] happened yet
[15:39] and so this proves there's no plagiarism
[15:41] from Brother Branham and Clarence Larkin
[15:45] regarding the oil and wine Larkin said
[15:47] it was the literal oil and wine that
[15:49] would be crops needed for medicinal
[15:50] purposes during the war in the Great
[15:52] Tribulation period
[15:55] of course brother Graham never taught
[15:56] this brother Graham said the oil was the
[15:58] baptism of the Holy Ghost and the wine
[16:00] was stimulation by Revelation so it's
[16:02] clear the conclusion is brother Ram did
[16:04] not plagiarize Clarence Larkin
[16:06] now let's compare brother Bynum and
[16:08] Uriah Smith
[16:10] your eyes missed timing of the third
[16:13] seal seems to be from the end of
[16:14] Constantine's Reign to about 5 38.
[16:18] which he called the establishment of the
[16:20] papacy
[16:25] so a general timeline would be from
[16:27] about 337 to 538 A.D
[16:32] and here's a screenshot you can see the
[16:33] difference between brother branham's
[16:35] third seal and Uriah Smith's third seal
[16:39] notice brother Ram's third seal started
[16:42] nearly 700 years after Uriah Smith
[16:46] and brother branham's third seal ended
[16:49] nearly 1500 years after Uriah Smith's
[16:52] third seal ended
[16:55] regarding the writer Uriah Smith said
[16:57] the writer seems to be quote the false
[16:59] system end quote leading to the
[17:02] establishment of the papacy end quote
[17:05] so it seems Rai Smith did agree with
[17:08] brother Branham on the identity of the
[17:10] writer the writer is basically the
[17:12] Antichrist Spirit working through the
[17:14] pope and all the false preachers and the
[17:17] false religious system of the Antichrist
[17:21] regarding the balances
[17:23] Uriah Smith said the balances were
[17:25] religion and civil powers
[17:28] brother Branham never said the balances
[17:30] were religion and civil Powers he said
[17:32] the balances represented the Roman
[17:34] Catholic Church capturing the wealth of
[17:36] the world during the Dark Ages through
[17:38] novenas
[17:39] or indulgences
[17:43] regarding the wheat and barley Uriah
[17:45] Smith said the spirit of the age would
[17:47] be worldly goods and Love of Money
[17:51] again brother Graham never said we in
[17:53] barley represented worldly goods and
[17:55] love of money he said they represented
[17:57] the natural staff of Life which
[18:00] symbolized the Roman Catholic Church
[18:01] capturing the wealth of the world
[18:03] through indulgences
[18:06] regarding the oil and wine urai Smith
[18:08] said they were quote Graces of the
[18:10] spirit faith and love end quote
[18:14] brother Branham of course said the oil
[18:16] was the spirit and wine was stimulation
[18:18] of Revelation
[18:21] so while both men recognized they dealt
[18:24] with the Holy Spirit brother random
[18:26] differentiated them and said the oil was
[18:29] the third work of Grace the baptism of
[18:31] the Holy Ghost and the wine was the
[18:33] stimulation or Joy or gladness or
[18:35] boldness of the Holy Ghost which your
[18:38] eye Smith did not say
[18:43] so again the conclusion is that brother
[18:45] Bram did not plagiarize your eyes Smith
[18:47] on the third seal
[18:51] now let's look at comments and a dream
[18:56] friends after seeing such vast
[18:58] differences between the first three
[18:59] seals I thought I would go and check
[19:02] brother Graham's accusers video and see
[19:04] what kind of comments they got on the
[19:05] third seal video
[19:07] and I didn't find many comments but the
[19:09] one said thank you dear
[19:11] with five thankful hand emojis and then
[19:14] brother Ram's accuser said you're most
[19:16] welcome
[19:17] now friends I'm not mocking brother
[19:19] Ram's accusers but how can the viewers
[19:21] be thankful for such a short video that
[19:25] ignored so much information of Charles
[19:27] Tay's Russell
[19:29] how can they be serious and be thankful
[19:31] for some of the weakest research
[19:34] possible regarding the seals
[19:37] how can they be thankful for three
[19:39] sentences of Russell's work out of the
[19:42] nearly two pages of his writing on the
[19:44] third seal
[19:46] how can they be thankful for one or two
[19:48] seconds of brotherbraham's information
[19:49] and teaching on the third seal and
[19:52] ignoring the other two hours and 11
[19:54] minutes
[19:55] this seems to point to the truth that
[19:57] brother Graham's accuser and his viewers
[19:59] are either ignorant or extremely
[20:02] disingenuous because they ignore so much
[20:04] teaching on the third seal and of course
[20:07] all the other seals
[20:09] while I was looking at these comments
[20:10] the scriptures came to me Proverbs 15 28
[20:13] the heart of the righteous studieth to
[20:16] answer but the mouth of the wicked
[20:18] poureth out evil things
[20:20] friends how can brothers accusers be
[20:22] righteous when their studying is so
[20:25] extremely weak and incomplete
[20:28] out of two pages they cite less than
[20:31] three sentences and that's just on the
[20:33] third seal video
[20:35] they did even less citations and less
[20:37] research on the other seal videos
[20:40] and then Proverbs 18 verse 13 says he
[20:43] that answereth a matter before he
[20:45] heareth it is a Folly and shame unto him
[20:49] how can brother Ram's accusers and their
[20:51] followers answer the matter on the third
[20:54] seal second seal first seal or any of
[20:56] the other seals without recognizing how
[20:58] much teaching there was on each seal
[21:02] it's most likely true brother randoms
[21:04] accusers and other followers have not
[21:07] fully read all of Charles Tay's
[21:09] Russell's work nor Clarence Larkins
[21:12] Nori rice Miss
[21:15] so again all these observations point to
[21:17] the fact that's very unlikely brother
[21:19] M's accusers and their followers are
[21:21] righteous because they truly do not
[21:23] study to give an honest answer
[21:27] and they're answering a matter declaring
[21:28] brother Branham a plagiarists and all
[21:30] kinds of other Wicked names before they
[21:33] actually even read and acknowledge all
[21:36] the information on each seal
[21:40] next I want to talk about a dream one of
[21:43] my daughters had now this daughter
[21:44] claims to have the baptism of the Holy
[21:46] Ghost
[21:47] and on the night of November 18th this
[21:50] daughter mine dreamed about brother
[21:52] Ram's accusers and in the dream they
[21:55] came into our house and they started
[21:57] criticizing every little detail in our
[22:00] house when we would respond and try to
[22:02] give them answers they acted like they
[22:05] didn't even hear us they just ignored us
[22:06] my daughter kept telling them to stop
[22:09] criticizing us yet they wouldn't stop
[22:12] and then brother Ram's accuser started
[22:14] mocking us
[22:15] and we could not stop their criticisms
[22:18] and so my daughter was very sad after
[22:20] this dream of course you could imagine
[22:21] why
[22:22] it was almost like a nightmare to see
[22:24] how unfairly brother Graham's accusers
[22:27] were treating us and of course it was
[22:29] extremely sad to see how they would not
[22:31] listen to any of our convictions they
[22:34] only came into our house to criticize
[22:35] they said nothing positive and they
[22:38] ignored all of our facts
[22:40] so I just thought I would share that
[22:41] dream and those comments to help us
[22:44] further understand the spirit that these
[22:46] accusers are likely under I do not
[22:49] believe they can be Anointed with an
[22:50] honest Spirit especially after seeing
[22:52] how much information on each CL so far
[22:55] they have failed to present they have
[22:58] omitted from their videos how can an
[23:00] honest person an honest researcher omit
[23:03] all these differences and all the
[23:05] details of each of the first three seals
[23:07] and friends let's recall there were
[23:10] seven differences between Russell and
[23:12] brother Branham on the third seal and
[23:14] there were six differences between
[23:16] Russell and brother Branham on the
[23:17] second seal and the first seal how could
[23:20] brother random's accusers ignore these
[23:22] 19 differences between the first three
[23:24] seals so far did they not read Russell's
[23:27] work did they not listen to brother
[23:29] random sermons on the first three seals
[23:31] of course I don't know the answer to
[23:33] these questions
[23:34] all I can do is prove all things and
[23:36] rightly divide the word of Truth and
[23:38] hope that the Holy Spirit Will convict
[23:40] these men of their disingenuous research
[23:42] their disingenuous videos
[23:47] in closing
[23:49] friends I hope this video on the third
[23:51] seal has been a blessing
[23:53] of course I want to end this video again
[23:54] with another prayer for brother Brown's
[23:55] accusers in hopes that someday they will
[23:58] repent of their false accusations
[24:00] against God's true Prophet brother
[24:02] Branham
[24:03] you know Satan is really moving right
[24:06] now as a critical spirit criticizing the
[24:09] message in the messenger and the
[24:11] Believers following the message of the
[24:12] hour
[24:13] but thankfully the Believers who have
[24:15] the baptism of the Holy Ghost will not
[24:17] be deterred because they have the Holy
[24:19] Ghost and the Holy Ghost guides us into
[24:21] all truth just as this video showed the
[24:23] Holy Ghost guided us into the full truth
[24:25] on the third seal so here's a prayer for
[24:28] brothers accusers
[24:30] dear heavenly father I come in the name
[24:31] of the Lord Jesus Christ and again Lord
[24:34] for the third time I ask God that you
[24:35] would allow these accusers of brother
[24:37] random to repent of their sins and their
[24:39] false accusations and honestly look at
[24:42] each of the seals and with an honest
[24:44] heart see the truth that God's Prophet
[24:47] did not plagiarize these other preachers
[24:49] Lord your Bible says With God all things
[24:52] are possible so Lord we ask that if it
[24:54] be possible if these men would be
[24:56] willing to repent Lord they could be
[24:57] drawn to repentance Lord God if they've
[24:59] been dishonest and if they've lied Lord
[25:00] for only you know the situation only
[25:02] only you know the reality of their
[25:04] spiritual conditions and Lord you told
[25:07] us to pray for our enemies and of course
[25:08] Lord these men are making brother
[25:10] Brandon I'm out to be a false prophet
[25:12] and that would make them our enemies
[25:13] because we believe brother Brown was
[25:15] God's true Prophet so Lord we praise you
[25:17] taught us to we pray for those who are
[25:19] against us who speak against us and
[25:21] against God's Prophet who speak against
[25:23] the true revelation of the word of God
[25:25] the Lord you promise to save all those
[25:27] that could be saved the heavenly father
[25:29] would not lose one of his sheep so Lord
[25:31] I pray God if these men are sheep they
[25:33] would repent of their sins and come to
[25:35] you and follow the true revelation of
[25:37] the word of God in Jesus Christ's name I
[25:40] ask this amen
[25:42] do you have any questions concerns or
[25:45] testimonies about this video please
[25:47] contact me
[25:49] God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[25:52] the desire of your heart
