[0:00] now someone had give me a note here just
[0:03] a little question we won't take too much
[0:05] time now to answer it and remember each
[0:08] time you lay a little question up I'll
[0:10] try my best to get to it if I can but
[0:12] this is an important question one more
[0:14] know if it was wrong for women to
[0:16] testify or to sing or give messages in
[0:19] tongues interpretate the messages or
[0:22] Prophecy in the church no it isn't wrong
[0:26] it's uh as long as it comes into place
[0:27] in order see the church an order and
[0:31] only when the real true way to do it is
[0:34] for those who speak with tongues and
[0:36] things are messages are given before the
[0:38] message from the pulpit never doing that
[0:40] time because the holy spirit's moving
[0:43] just from one place at a time as Paul
[0:45] spoke up there but women are gifted with
[0:49] prophecy and gifted with tongues and
[0:52] interpretations and everything but being
[0:54] preachers they're not to be preachers
[0:57] they're forbidden to preach in the
[0:58] churches that's right take
[1:00] or be a teacher or anything in the
[1:02] church but as far as gifts the woman has
[1:04] all those can occupy one or any of those
[1:08] nine spiritual gifts C in 1 Corinthians
[1:10] uh 12 and is under no bondage that her
[1:14] message should not come forth in its
[1:16] place you see each message waits for its
[1:18] time if there be one who speaks the
[1:21] tongues there be no interpreter let him
[1:22] hold his peace until there be an
[1:23] interpreter see and these messages are
[1:26] given usually just before the meeting
[1:28] then uh the Prophet or the preacher
[1:31] which is the New Testament Prophet a
[1:33] preacher when he comes forth God begins
[1:35] to move through him see then when he's
[1:37] finished then messages begin other than
[1:40] just before it's always an order always
[1:43] but a woman does have the right
