TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I predict that the two denominational groups Pentecostal and the Evangelical groups will work together in a denomination will unite themselves together and will become a member all of them of the Federation of the council churches or the council churches they already belong to it all of them and there will come through them a forcing or a boycott that'll stop everything but what belongs to that Union of churches that's what a the Bible said that there would be a boycott even in such a way would cause people to not buy or sell unless they had received this the mark of the beast which is romanism and the image of the Beast which is protestantism that the image of the Beast had Power Authority to give the image life to speak and it did and that's the Confederate ation of churches when they Confederate themselves together I many young people here I don't know Jesus may come this afternoon he may come next year I don't know when he'll be coming but if remember if I do not live to see that day of his coming which I hope that I will and somehow believe I will now if I do not see it do not let this word ever depart from your ears in your heart just remember I speak in the name of the Lord now I believe with all my heart that's the way it'll wind up there will be like a union a a boycott all such places as this here will be closed down and you'll not be able to speak unless you got a A permission or a license from this Federation of churches to hold a service it's almost as shows that does that now even even in the denomination it shows where it's at yeah so you have to have it and that's where it'll wind up at that's my prediction as the servant of Christ through the understanding that I have of the word and the inspiration that's where it will come the all signs are pointing to the end I just got through speaking on that and it's even to the remember there will be such a denominational Gathering pretty soon it'll be terrific and they will bring themselves together into this Federation of churches and then this kind of a church will be put out of operation as far as they know it's at that time that Jesus will appear and he will show which is bride amen and which is not and remember Christian friends I'm a man I can make mistakes but God being God cannot make a mistake all the words that's been written must be fulfilled Jesus said so so we've got things here in the scripture that must be fulfilled and that is one of the things this boycott to come but before this boycott can come of the marking of the Beast there has to be a seed sold for God to take a church out of it amen you understand now a seed has to be sold a denominational seed and there to make a farm or an image to the Beast the Church of Rome and there has to be a true bride and we understand that the so-called bride is rejected I will keep thee from the hour of Temptation which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the Earth this verse is not a declaration that the true church will go into and through the tribulation if it meant that it would have said that but it said I will keep thee from the hour of Temptation this temptation is exactly like the Temptation in Eden it will be a very inviting proposition held up in direct opposition to God's commanded word and yet from the standpoint of human reasoning it will be so very right so enlightening and lifegiving as to fool the world only the very elect will not be fooled the Temptation will come as follows The ecumenical move that has started on what seems such a beautiful and blessed principle fulfilling Christ's prayer that we all might be one becomes so strong politically that she Bears pressure upon the government to cause all to join with her either directly or through adherence to principles enacted into law so that no people will be recognized as actual churches unless under direct or indirect domination of this Council little groups will lose Charters privileges Etc until they lose all property and spiritual rights with the people for example right now unless the local Ministerial Association approves in many if not most cities one cannot rent a building for religious services to become chaplain in the armed services hospitals Etc it is now almost mandatory to be recognized as acceptable to The trinitarian ecumenical groups as this pressure inre increases and it will it will be harder to resist for to resist is to lose privilege and so many will be tempted to go along for they will feel it is better to serve God publicly in the framework of this organization than not to serve God at all publicly but they er to believe the devil's lie is to serve Satan even though you may want to call him Jehovah but the elect will not be deceived furthermore the elect will not only be kept but as this move becomes the image erected to the Beast the Saints will be gone in the Rapture and this little delightful Winsome movement that started out in fellowship at Ephesus will become the monster of Satan that defiles and deceives the whole world for the church system of the Roman Catholic and the Protestant in coming together will control the whole wealth of the world system and force the whole earth into its religious trap or will kill them by refusing them the privilege of buying and selling whereby they would make a living this will be accomplished simply for the harlot's daughters are all but gone back to her in the meantime Rome has acquired nearly all the supplies of gold the Jews have the bonds and all the paper at the right time the Harlot will destroy the present day money system by calling in all the paper and demanding gold with no gold the system Falls the Jews will be trapped and come into the alliance and the Harlot church will take over the whole world
