[0:02] there's only going to be two classes of
[0:04] people in the last days both of them
[0:07] going to wear Mark the mark of God is
[0:11] the baptism of the Holy
[0:14] Spirit without a shadow
[0:17] down greetings friends in the mattress
[0:20] name of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[0:22] purpose of this video is to examine the
[0:24] origins of the mark of the beast from
[0:25] the time of Cain and show how that Mark
[0:28] of the Beast has advanced from the time
[0:30] of Cain to the present day hi friends
[0:33] I'm Jesse Smith pastor bride of Christ
[0:34] Fellowship here in akan Ohio USA and I
[0:37] defend the original Gospel of Jesus
[0:39] Christ that he revealed to St Paul and
[0:41] then had to restore through Martin
[0:42] Luther John Wesley and the late Prophet
[0:44] William brandham 1909 to 1965 I also
[0:48] defend brother Ram's Godly Christian
[0:50] character this video is sort of a
[0:52] follow-up to the video I put out on June
[0:54] 24th called who is the future Antichrist
[0:57] or false prophet it'll be the pope of
[0:59] Rome as brother random taught the reason
[1:01] I say it's kind of a follow-up is
[1:03] because it's in the same chapter of my
[1:04] 2021 book The 12 New Testament Mysteries
[1:07] revealed it's in chapter n called The
[1:10] Mystery of Babylon the great and today's
[1:13] specific teaching you'll find on pages
[1:16] 587 through
[1:18] 589 and you can also listen to this book
[1:21] free on my YouTube channel as well just
[1:24] type in audio book The 12 New Testament
[1:26] Mysteries chapter 9 the mystery of
[1:29] Babylon the the great before getting too
[1:31] far into this subject I want to say that
[1:33] there seems to be a little difference
[1:35] between the mark of the beast during the
[1:36] Great Tribulation period and this was
[1:38] kind of like a fresh Revelation to me as
[1:40] I wrote this book back in 2021 so
[1:43] perhaps in the next video or future
[1:44] video I'll go over the mark of the beast
[1:46] during the Great Tribulation because it
[1:49] can be taken in three different ways and
[1:52] remember you must have this Mark to buy
[1:54] or sell during the Great Tribulation of
[1:56] course the true bride of Jesus Christ
[1:57] wants to be gone right before the Great
[2:00] Tribulation starts in the
[2:01] pre-tribulation Rapture the Rapture of
[2:04] the Gentile bride of Jesus Christ as
[2:06] taught in 1 Thessalonians chap 4 and 1
[2:08] Corinthians 15 so there's three ways to
[2:11] take the mark of the beast during the
[2:12] Great Tribulation period you can take
[2:14] the mark in the right hand or forehead
[2:17] so that's one way the mark in the right
[2:18] hand or forehead second way is through
[2:20] the mark of the name of the Beast and
[2:22] this is according to Revelation
[2:24] 13:17 and the third and final way is the
[2:27] mark of the number of his name and there
[2:30] is some overlap of course but I love how
[2:32] the Bible the scriptures dovetail so we
[2:35] get a clear picture on the mark of the
[2:37] beast but let's look at this topic here
[2:38] the mark of the beast the origin of it
[2:40] and then how it's Advanced here up to
[2:42] the current Day by God's grace so
[2:45] according to the Book of Genesis Cain is
[2:47] the first prefigure of someone receiving
[2:49] the mark of the beast Cain knew the
[2:51] perfect will of God but rejected it he
[2:54] knew God's perfect will was animal
[2:55] sacrifice but he brought a different
[2:57] sacrifice God even told him if if you
[3:00] bring the right sacrifice you'll rule
[3:01] over your brother in Genesis 4 but Cain
[3:04] like his father the wicked one the
[3:06] serpent Cain's father was the serpent
[3:09] not Satan but a serpent it was Satan's
[3:13] spirit that possessed the serpent but
[3:15] Cain's father was the serpent Cain
[3:18] blatantly rejected God's word and then
[3:20] he soon murdered his brother it also
[3:22] seems God gave Cain a physical Mark so
[3:25] that other men would not kill him as he
[3:27] wasted his life wandering like a
[3:28] fugitive and a vagabond this is in
[3:31] Genesis
[3:33] 41-15 so there's the origin of the mark
[3:36] of the beast in the Book of Genesis now
[3:38] don't forget friends of course this is
[3:39] the most important part God has a mark
[3:41] as well in the New Testament it's called
[3:43] the Seal of the Holy Ghost or the
[3:45] baptism of the Holy Ghost see acts 1:6
[3:48] see also Ephesians 1:13 and Ephesians
[3:50] 4:30 there's only going to be two
[3:52] classes of people in the last days both
[3:55] of them going to wear a mark the mark of
[3:59] God is is the baptism of the Holy
[4:02] Spirit without a Shadow of Doubt I
[4:06] preached that not long ago right here
[4:08] amen by the holy spirit's help and the
[4:11] word of God proved it that the Seal of
[4:14] God is the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[4:16] amen Ephesians 4:30 says grieve not the
[4:20] holy spirit of God whereby you're sealed
[4:23] until the day of your
[4:26] Redemption without the Holy Spirit
[4:30] you are not
[4:31] sealed but the holy spirit is God sealed
[4:35] and then that all that was not sealed
[4:38] with the Holy Spirit was Tu on the mark
[4:41] of the beast and the mark of the beast
[4:44] is the mark of apostasy which is
[4:48] rejecting the Holy
[4:50] Spirit see what I mean now Genesis also
[4:54] prefigures the mark of God as well it's
[4:56] in Genesis
[4:57] 4:26 and to Seth un to him also so there
[5:00] was born a son and he called his name
[5:02] Enos then began men to call upon the
[5:05] name of the Lord so Cain leaves the
[5:07] presence of God because he brought the
[5:09] wrong sacrifice but Seth would of course
[5:12] continue the right sacrifice animal
[5:14] sacrifice and he would have been calling
[5:16] upon the name of the Lord now today for
[5:18] us that's Believers calling on the name
[5:20] of the Lord Jesus Christ not titles
[5:22] father son Holy Ghost but the Lord Jesus
[5:24] Christ bringing the true sacrifice of
[5:27] worship the Bible said the sacrifice of
[5:29] God Are Spiritual sacrifices
[5:32] Thanksgiving doing good to one another
[5:35] communicating with one another being
[5:37] Kings and Priests unto God ruling over
[5:39] sin as spiritual Kings over sin flesh
[5:42] hell and the devil and also as priests
[5:44] making intercession for others praying
[5:46] for other people bringing their needs
[5:48] Before the Throne of God the Bible says
[5:50] that Jesus ever lives to make
[5:51] intercession and can be touched by the
[5:53] feeling of our infirmities so as Holy
[5:55] Ghost filled Christians that's part of
[5:57] our duty we're not saved by that but
[5:59] that's that's what we love to do because
[6:00] God's called us to do that by the grace
[6:02] of God so Satan's spiritual Mark is
[6:05] received when unbelievers reject God's
[6:08] seal of the Holy Ghost by disobeying his
[6:11] path to receive the baptism of the Holy
[6:13] Ghost and God's path to receive the
[6:16] baptism of the Holy Ghost is the stature
[6:17] of perfect man Faith virtue knowledge
[6:20] Temperance patience godliness brotherly
[6:22] kindness and then the cap or The
[6:24] Headstone or the capping stone or the
[6:26] Seal of the Holy Ghost is Charity God's
[6:29] divine love for God is love according to
[6:31] the book of First John so the opposite
[6:33] of those seven attributes on the statute
[6:35] of perfect man would be unbelief because
[6:38] unbelief is the opposite of Faith
[6:41] hypocrisy that's the opposite of virtue
[6:44] reasoning that's the opposite of
[6:46] knowledge sensuality that's the opposite
[6:48] of temperance impatience that's the
[6:51] opposite of patience irreverence that's
[6:53] the opposite of godliness selfishness
[6:56] that's the opposite of Brotherly
[6:57] kindness and then rebell ion or hatred
[7:01] that's the opposite of the love of God
[7:03] now remember there's wise and foolish
[7:05] virgins According To Jesus and of course
[7:07] the entire rest of the Bible the Bible
[7:10] always teaches there's two kinds of
[7:11] Believers and two kinds of unbelievers
[7:14] that's what brother Bram taught us in
[7:15] the church age book there's four classes
[7:16] of people brother Ram tells us and so
[7:18] Holy Ghost filled Christians will have
[7:20] all those attributes all those
[7:21] anointings now foolish virgins may just
[7:23] have one of those they may just have
[7:25] faith that's what they're saved by we're
[7:27] saved by grace through faith and then
[7:29] there's other levels of foolish virgins
[7:31] they might have virtue some knowledge
[7:34] some Temperance some patience some
[7:35] godness some brotherly kindness so it's
[7:37] very plain there's wise and foolish
[7:39] virgins all throughout the scripture now
[7:41] getting back to unbelievers the
[7:43] unbelievers after Cain did not receive a
[7:45] physical mark but instead they took a
[7:47] spiritual Mark for rejecting God's path
[7:49] to Salvation so the wicked evil cike
[7:52] rejectors of God's word and God's
[7:55] perfect will are termed as reprobate in
[7:58] the Old Testament and the new Testament
[8:00] reprobate in the Greek means a rejected
[8:02] mind so it's because the sinner rejected
[8:05] God's will for the last time that God
[8:07] rejects them and gives them over to
[8:09] reprobate mind so the term reprobate is
[8:12] used in Jeremiah 6:30 and then Romans
[8:15] 1:28 2 Timothy 3:8 and Titus 1:16
[8:19] according to Romans 1: 28-32 God gives a
[8:22] person over to a reprobate mind who
[8:24] continually refuses God's love and who
[8:27] refuses to retain God's word in his mind
[8:30] while having pleasure in committing
[8:32] Wicked abominable acts and the example
[8:34] there is
[8:36] homosexuality because God's love is so
[8:39] great his eyes or Spirit Run to and fro
[8:42] throughout the whole Earth according to
[8:43] 2 Chronicles 169 he's seeking each soul
[8:46] and offering each Soul salvation the
[8:49] father is always seeking true
[8:50] worshippers according to John 4:23 so
[8:53] there'll be no excuses for The
[8:54] reprobates Who reject God's continual
[8:56] love his continual offer of Love on the
[8:58] day of judgement because God has
[9:00] revealed his power and godhead to every
[9:03] person through his creation and also the
[9:05] human body and human Spirit that's
[9:07] according to Romans 1: 19 and 20 so
[9:12] rejection is the key word for people
[9:14] that take the mark of the beast from the
[9:16] time of Cain to the current day remember
[9:19] God desires all men to be saved 1
[9:21] Timothy 2:4 but few there be that find
[9:24] the narrow road that leads to life
[9:26] according to Jesus in Matthew 7:14
[9:29] this means most people reject God's
[9:32] gracious offer of love and forgiveness
[9:33] through the cross there's also another
[9:36] foreshadowing of taking the mark of the
[9:38] beast in the Old Testament it's found in
[9:40] Deuteronomy 15:17 and exodus 21:6 it's
[9:44] called the all it's a physical Mark the
[9:47] a was a permanent earring giving to
[9:48] Jewish indentured servants who purposely
[9:51] rejected freedom and wanted to remain as
[9:54] servants forever Jewish indentured
[9:57] servants serve 6 years but the seventh
[9:59] year they could go free if they wanted
[10:02] again according to Exodus 21:6 and
[10:04] Deuteronomy 15:17 these scriptures
[10:06] detail this Mark in the ear for these
[10:09] indentured servants who rejected their
[10:11] god-given inheritance which included all
[10:14] the blessings of the land of their
[10:15] forefathers bring him to the door or to
[10:19] the post that's the the calvary all
[10:22] right and his master shall bore his
[10:26] ear will bore his ear through with a all
[10:30] and he shall serve him
[10:34] forever
[10:36] amen amen what do you mean brother brand
[10:39] if you hear the gospel
[10:42] truth and you refuse to walk in it then
[10:46] God marks your ear where you'll never
[10:48] hear it no
[10:49] [Music]
[10:49] [Applause]
[10:51] more you cross the line between life and
[10:54] death then you go on with your
[10:57] organization denomination the rest
[10:59] day
[11:01] forever walk in the light
[11:04] children that's right you'll serve that
[11:07] Master forever so today unbelievers show
[11:10] their spiritual ears are marked with
[11:12] Satan's Mark when they reject the good
[11:14] news of the Gospel offering them freedom
[11:17] from sin through the Holy Spirit they
[11:20] choose to love sin and remain a slave to
[11:23] it or servant to sin rather than ruling
[11:27] over sin just like Cain failed to rule
[11:30] over sin God said your sin is right at
[11:32] the door it's very close to you if you
[11:35] don't rule over it it's going to rule
[11:36] over you but thank God True Believers
[11:38] submit to God's spirit and live
[11:40] righteously and godly in this present
[11:44] World in
[11:46] closing friends hope this video was a
[11:48] blessing by the grace of God as a nice
[11:49] followup to the video about the
[11:52] Antichrist the person the Antichrist the
[11:54] false prophet which is the pope of Rome
[11:57] friends let's do all in our power the
[11:59] Bible says give all diligence Peter says
[12:02] it twice in second Peter chapter 1 give
[12:04] all diligence to add to your faith
[12:06] virtue knowledge Temperance patience
[12:09] godliness brotherly kindness keep adding
[12:11] the attributes and the anointing of the
[12:12] Holy Ghost to your life remember friends
[12:14] let's fight the good fight of Faith it's
[12:16] going to be a fight to overcome unbelief
[12:19] hypocrisy reasonings sensuality
[12:21] impatience irreverence selfishness and
[12:24] Rebellion or hatred remember with man
[12:27] these things are impossible but with God
[12:29] all things are possible the last
[12:31] scripture I'll use is Matthew 5:6 I love
[12:34] this verse when it comes to the topic of
[12:35] being born again or being marked with
[12:37] God's seal blessed are they which do
[12:39] hunger and thirst after righteousness
[12:41] for they shall be filled friends we have
[12:43] to hunger for the word of God we have to
[12:45] hunger for an experience with God more
[12:47] than we hunger time on our phones or
[12:49] time on our tablets we must hunger for
[12:51] God more than we desire big numbers in
[12:53] the bank account or large numbers in
[12:56] attendance at our church services we
[12:57] must hunger for the baptism of the Holy
[12:59] Ghost and God said Jesus said if we
[13:02] hunger and thirst we shall be filled
[13:04] what a promise may God grant you his
[13:06] grace and mercy to receive this
[13:08] wonderful promise May each one of us
[13:10] hunger and thirst until we're filled
[13:11] with the Holy Ghost and we're so
[13:13] thankful for God sending his Prophet The
[13:15] Late William Marin brandham to teach us
[13:17] these things many of his sermons speak
[13:19] of these subjects such as Mark of the
[13:20] Beast the token you must be born again
[13:23] and so many more wonderful sermons if
[13:26] you need links to those just let me know
[13:28] if you have any any questions concerns
[13:30] or testimonies about this video please
[13:31] contact
[13:32] me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[13:35] the desire of your heart
