TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] you let me talk to a man two minutes I can tell you whether he's received the Holy Ghost or not so can you greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to do a part two on the question how far can a Christian fall into sin I want to appreciate all the feedback from part one of this video and I hope this video is a blessing as well by God's grace friends I'm Jesse Smith I'm Pastor bride of Christ Fellowship I pastored here in akan Ohio for about 17 years and I defend the Bible revelations that Jesus Christ revealed to his Prophet his genuine Prophet brother William brandham and also defend brother branham's Godly Christian character so the outline for this video is basically I'll go over points about the wise virgin and how the wise virgin has battles with sin but will not commit major sins and then I'll go through a few more important points from the past video so let's start with the wise virgin I want to start with another list of major sins uh located in Revelation 21: 7 and 8 the Bible says he that overcometh shall inherit all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son but the fearful and unbelieving and the Abominable and murderers and hor mongers and Sorcerers and idolators and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone which is the second death so I love how this verse 8 lists all the sins but in the previous verse I love how it says the Overcomers inherit all things and these are some of the things the Overcomers overcame like the example with brother brandom from part one brother brandom lied to the IRS right but brother randam overcame Lying by the grace of God as a holy ghost filled Christian of course he overcame it he had power within him to do that cuz greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world think of Mary Magdalene it's believed by history she was a hormonger or a prostitute but Look what Jesus did for her Jesus forgave her cast seven demons out of her she was there on the day of Pentecost she was the first one to see Jesus raised from the dead and murderers how many people did Paul agree to see murdered we know at least one Steven the Bible said he put all these people in jail and even blasphemed against Jesus but yet he was forgiven he was an overcomer by the grace of God Almighty so friends we're Overcomers by the blood of the Lamb right and the word of Our Testimony from Revelation 12 even as New Testament Believers despite our sins our minor sins as wise virgins we still have to remember all these wonderful scriptures about the Power in the Blood of Jesus Christ let's read through some verses like Colossians 1 13 and 14 who have delivered us from the power of darkness and has translated us into the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have Redemption through his blood even the Forgiveness of sins so the blood of Jesus Christ has forgiven all of our sins the Bible said when Jesus died he paid for the sins of the whole world and that had to been past present and future so Jesus Christ has paid for all of our sins we just have to confess them by the grace of God then Colossians 1:22 says he's able to present you holy and unblamable and unreprovable in his sight unblamable you cannot be blamed on the day of judgment because of the blood of Jesus Christ brother ran won't be blamed for his lie to the IRS because the blood of Jesus Christ forgave him of that and that's because Colossians 2 13 said he's forgiving you all your trespasses praise the Lord every trespass is forgiven by the blood of Jesus Christ no wonder it's called The Gospel good news and here we get into this wonderful truth even in the Old Testament that in heaven God already recognizes us as his children as his sons as perfect spotless Before the Throne of God but on Earth we still need chasen during our lifetime we need rebuked by the grace of God we see this in job chap 1 and 2 in job chapters 1 and 2 God tells Satan that job is perfect and he excus evil God has a testimony meeting he invites Satan and he brags on his servant job by the grace of God but then on Earth job goes through tests and trials and job even exalted himself above God and God confirmed that in job 40:8 God told job that he had Justified himself more than him God we also see this truth of God rebuking job in Job 38 1-3 God comes down to answer job's questions and God says who is this so in heaven God is telling the devil here's job here's job but because job's struggling on Earth God comes down and says who are you to keep him humble to rebuke him while he's in this pest house this body of death the Bible calls it and the Bible said God rebukes all he loves like in Revelation 3: 19 so we must accept the rebuke of the Holy Ghost confess our sins and walk in the light as he's in the light and remember friends Abraham and Isaac lied as well so we think of that example of brother brand lying prophets can lie prophets can make mistakes but they are forgiven by the blood of their sacrifice for us it's the blood of Jesus Christ here in the New Testament remember friends the Bible says in Ephesians we're already accepted in the Beloved first John says we are now the sons of God the book of Romans is so beautiful we've been preaching on that lately but Romans 8 is so powerful starts off in verse one by saying there's no condemnation to us and then the chapter 8 Ends by saying nothing can separate us from the love of God so we have no condemnation and we have no separation from God's love in the middle of the chapter we also hear that all things work together for our good that we're predestinated to be in the image of Jesus Christ that if God is for us who can be against us and no man can lay any charge to our account because it's God who justifies us again thank God for the Amazing Grace that he's given to us the next idea comes out of uh Romans 7:17 I mentioned this verse in part one where Paul said it's not I that sin but sin that dwelleth within me we see the same idea in 1 John 3:9 the Bible said whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he's born of God so here we're taught that a wise virgin who's Born Again In The Soul cannot sin and yet Paul says he sins and brother Ram says we sin every day so how do we understand this well we break it down because each person has three parts a body a spirit or mind and a soul and of course the New Testament is about the birth in the soul the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the soul so we get this beautiful truth that once a person's born again that seed of God the holy spirit inside of them cannot sin and can never sin what sins is the sin nature In the Flesh and also the sinful thoughts in the mind so this is how we understand God sees us as perfect in Heaven by the grace of God we have a perfect sacrifice the blood of Jesus Christ and also we have a theophany body there in heaven the Bible says according to 2 Corinthians 5: 1-5 and then inside of us we have a seat of God that never sin to begin with so this is the beauty again of the Gospel of Jesus Christ and the glory of being a wise virgin who's baptized with the Holy Ghost the next point is about complexes again I believe the main sin Holy Ghost filled Christians will battle with is complexes found in 2 Corinthians 104 and 5 they're called strongholds but brother Bram said a lot of Christians have them in other words they have a lot of Mind battles brother Ram says that in the flashing red light of of the sign of his coming in 1963 brother Ram said I guess if I'd asked tonight in this audience homon in here knows you have a complex practically every hand would go up and then he asks them he says look at there so brother ROM realized even mature Holy Ghost filled Christians can have mind battles and that's where Satan works on them the hardest right the greatest battle ever fall is in the mind let's listen to the quote because I had I was making My Confession of having complex and I guess if I asked tonight in this audience of people how many in your NOS you have complex practically every hand will go up that you might know brother way just let me show you where this discernment not how many knows that you got a complex raise your hand look at there but uh I don't know if that shock of me saying that to brother wayy taking it like I might be rebuking him or something then it uh he fell into this condition and the Lord Jesus brought him back now friends understanding this truth that will battle complexes we're going to battle complexes in these three areas the lust of the eyes lust of the Flesh and the pride of life in part one I talked about that a lot even Holy Ghost filed Christians can battle the lust of the eyes that's why brother BR had to hang a cross in his car to get his eyes off any immorally dressed woman I talked about then the pride of life how a lot of preachers say call themselves the goats the greatest preachers of all time on both the five-fold side and also the tape worship side the one I left out I want to mention was the lust of the flesh now I've heard at least two preachers say they battle this area they overeat they get nervous and they overeat or they travel a lot and they overeat they eat unhealthy Foods so that's something I want to bring out as well that you can have a real Holy Ghost filled preacher but his battle might be with the lust of the Flesh and he might overeat he might get distracted with the cares of this life too much because one of our battles that we Battle Is Easy Living or soft living as brother random says especially here in leoa he says it in the thy in church age page 239 He said Each age had its pressures for example a great burden of this last age is the pressure of riches soft living and nervous tensions in a complex age that we seem unfitted to live in so it's fitting he says it's a complex age and we have a lot of complexes notice the pressure of riches and also the pressure of soft living so each Holy Ghost filled person if you pray about it long enough or meditate long enough you'll see which area you battle the hardest either lust of the eyes lust of the flesh or pride of life and you got to keep battling many times with that area of your life over and over again Satan will leave for a season but then he'll come back you just got to be ready to fight and overcome cast down anything that exalts itself against the word of God the next verse I want to talk about is the scripture in 1 Peter 2:1 here's why people sometimes wonder am I filled with the Holy Ghost or not Peter says dearly beloved I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims abstain from fleshly lust which war against the soul so fleshly lust would probably be lust of the flesh right overeating giving the flesh too much food too much drink fancy clothes anything the flesh might like but also it could be lust of the eyes as well I personally believe because notice Peter says when people give into that if they don't abstain from fleshly lust it causes a war against their soul so this is why so many people have a war am I saved or not am I filled with the Holy Ghost or not it's because they've spent a lot of time recently giving in to the lust of the flesh but as soon as they cast that down they get into a new season they get a season of Victory a season of repentance a season of dedication and diligence to God then all these mind battles will be forgotten they'll be cast down and then the person can get their first love back get back on fire for Jesus Christ doing the first works and there won't be this big war going on in their minds so I hope that verse is a blessing 1 Peter 2: 11 now in the last part for the wise virgin I want to address the two comments on this video about major and minor sins and just so you know brother brandom said major sins three times the first is how can I overcome he said quote when this is the major sin of our day it's the major sin among our people worldliness let's listen to the quote when this is the major sin of our days that's right the major sin among our people worldl as the Bible said the lady lady OA age was she's worly Rich have need of nothing don't know that she's naked miserable wretched blind that's the sin of our day the second quote is from broken sisters 1965 brother is talking about Israel being accused by the prophet and they were accused of two major sins and the two major sins were forsaking God and then hewing out themselves ssts of course that's from the book of Jeremiah chapter 2 brother Brandon preached broken sisters we find out here that Israel is Accused by the prophet when God had ordained him and sent him out they were accused of two major sins and we want to talk on those two things that they had done and from that we want to prosper V uh they had turned from God the Fountain of Living Water and had hewed themselves out sisters so here we can see now there are major sins brother Ram said and minor Sins Of course minor sins was from 196 1 he was asked specifically about minor things Christians might battle so the first comment said there's a problem with major and minor sins and this was a great question he said what about a man looking on a woman in lust and hating an individual in your heart you're guilty of murder and so forth he says Sin is Sin and So my answer was God bless you dear friend Sin is Sin and I agree with that and there are always consequences to sins whether in thought only form or action form but I said not all sins are equal nor are their consequences the Pharisees get the greater damnation for their hypocrisy According To Jesus in Matthew 23:14 and also the house or city that rejects the gospel will be punished more than Sodom and Gomorrah Matthew 10:14 and 15 remember Sodom and gomorra was filled with Wicked gangster sodomites that surrounded houses and did wickedness so yes Sin is Sin but not all sins are equal and then also there's different levels of Rewards for Christians According To Jesus in Matthew 13:23 brother R talked about degrees of Believers as well there'll be Kings and rulers and then there'll just be the Common People by God's grace then I can prove that there is degrees in heaven that they'll not all be on the same equal but you'll have equal eternal life but the Bible said that the kings of the earth bring their honor and Glory Revelations 22 bring their honor and Glory into the city that proves that they'll be kings in the new Earth Kings and rulers Jesus told his disciples they said what will we have after we have left father and mother and all to follow you he said verily I say you you'll set up on 12 Thrones judging the 12 tribes of Israel so I went on to tell the brother yes walking in the spirit is a solution but thought sins like lust murder coveting that get confessed before actions are not the same as literally committing those sinful actions Jesus was basically showing that evil thoughts are the origin of all sin which goes with Matthew 15: 18- 19 if thought sins are confessed before taking action they're still forgiven according to 1 John 1 8-10 if we confess them they're forgiven and then if they're confessed they won't have the same consequences as if a person literally commits one of those acts and then I didn't write this but I wanted to add this in on the video any genuine repentance is accepted by God and that's why David was not killed for his adultery and murder even though David knew and judge himself worthy of death as Nathan let David judge his sin first and David said that man will die but then Nathan showed Mercy from God and said Thou shalt not die in 2 Samuel 12:5 and second Samuel 12:13 but yet there was awful consequences to David's sin we all know that numerous people lost their lives because of David and on the other side David said blessed is the man to whom God will not impute sin so David committed the sin there was consequences but God didn't impute it against him in heaven it's according to Romans 4: 6-8 another good example is the thief on the cross where he was so easily and powerfully forgiven and saved Jesus said today you'll be with me in Paradise the second comment on major and minor sin said that it seemed to him that brother brandom didn't mean to categorize sins as major and minor and then he thought this was the case according to James 29-11 he said based upon those scriptures I don't think the major minor distinction can be lined up with scripture my reply was God bless you thanks for your kindness we'll just have to agree to disagree brother brandham did say major sin and major sins and two other quotes also brother Bram said there's degrees in heaven with Kings rulers and common people how did some people become Kings While others were common people by their works because works is Faith expressed the Kings and rulers Liv the high calling as St Paul taught they lived above the major sins we're not saved by works but our works demonstrate our appreciation for Grace as brother brandom said and as of course the Bible teaches the Bible said in Ephesians 2 we're saved by grace but then we're created unto good works Ephesians 2: 8-10 so I told the brother Galatians 51 18-26 and 1 Corinthians 6:9-11 prove the distinction can be made between major and minor sins in my humble opinion also the life of Peter and the apostles before and after Pentecost proves this distinction as well God bless you and let me expound on that just a moment Before Peter got the holy ghost look at his major sins that he did he denied Jesus Christ three times but after he got the Holy Ghost he never denied Christ again also before they got the Holy Ghost the apostles were arguing about who's the greatest afterwards they were constantly trying to serve each one died a martyr except for St John I believe James and John were asking for Jesus to send fire down from heaven and destroy the cities that didn't accept him and Jesus said you don't even know what Spirit you're of in other words they lack the love of God but afterwards John was known as the disciple of love so there is clearly a difference between the major sins versus the minor sins denying Christ had to been major sin for Peter but after got the Holy Ghost he never denied Christ again now by God's grace I want to get to a few important points I want to sayate a few more things about that idea of sometimes we can know the wise virgin and the foolish virgin sometimes we can't I'm sure as message Believers have youve been around the message for long enough there's probably people that have fallen away that you or I might have thought for sure that person had the Holy Ghost I know that's happened to me especially when I was younger and a lot more immature but I felt like in part one I didn't do enough justice as far as saying there are people that you can definitely know are the true children of God are the wise virgins like think of brother ROM's life all the saints around him knew he was a born again Holy Ghost filled prophet of God it's undeniable they knew it and yet he had his human shortcomings he sinned every day as he said but he confessed them all by the blood of Christ the 120 Believers in the upper room would have known each one was filled with the Holy Ghost cuz they saw the fire above their forehead heads and yet then Peter at galatia would battle this fear complex and segregate himself away from the Gentiles and need to rebuked by St Paul so again they would have known Peter and the other 119 Saints on the day of Pentecost had the Holy Ghost some Old Testament examples are there as well Samuel the prophet would have known David was the wise virgin for his day because he even told Saul David is better than you other words David was going to obey the Commandments better or more Faithfully than Saul and that's found in 1st Samuel 15:28 the Lord hath rent the kingdom and given it to a neighbor of thine that is better than thou and then remember David of course committed adultery and murdered but yet he was the highest quality of believer for his day everyone was compared to David all the kings were compared to David he was a man after God's Own Heart so again there are times we can know someone is the highest quality of believer for their day so for us today it's called the wise virgin the people who are baptized with the Holy Ghost in their souls next I want to read that quote I appreciate two people shared the quote with me where brother Ram said I can tell within 2 minutes if the person has the holy ghost or not the quotes from 1959 what is the Holy Ghost let's listen to the quote you let me talk to a man two minutes I can tell you whether he receed the holy ghost or not so can you it's separates them it's a Mark it's a sign and the Holy Spirit is a sign and again friends this quote backs up some of the examples I gave from the scripture about the day of Pentecost St Paul they would have seen St Paul filled with the Holy Ghost of course David as the example of the wise virgin for his day and then remember some people will battle whether they are born again or not like sister Bruce in 1964 interview with sister Bruce brother random ures her I've seen you under Vision you're a real Christian and brother Ram would tell her you know you should pray to speak in tongues if that will help you to know that you've got the Holy Ghost So you you're you're a Christian I've watched your life I've watched you under B and I know you're a Christian see not one spe of the I am your Shepherd as was somebody got if there was any doubt in my mind if I thought you was something was wrong I tell you sister R but if there's anything wrong in your experience anything wrong between you and God it's more than I know anything about than for friend so either way friends whether we struggle with it or not we've got to make our calling and election sure we've got to be humble we' got to press on toward the mark of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus one final point I want to make is the power of confession Proverbs says life and death is in the power of the tongue brother random says don't ever say you're a weak Christian and remember Jesus Christ is the high priest of our profession the Bible also says in Proverbs whatsoever a man thinketh in his heart so he is so we got to make sure we keep the right thoughts about oursel all these scriptures about we're forgiven from Romans 8 also John 5:24 if we believe in Christ we pass from Death unto life and will not come into judgment we will not go for the white Throne judgment we will sit with Christ in the throne and the Bible says the Saints shall judge the Earth the Saints shall judge Angels why because of the grace of Jesus Christ because of the blood of Jesus Christ the present truth the message of the hour that Christ sent for this end times here at the end of the leian church age and recall friends there is 14 Seasons or times in Ecclesiastes 3 1-8 we must go through all of them by God's grace some are easier to go through than others it's a lot easier to dance than to mourn remember Ecclesiastes 8:11 God makes all things beautiful in his time let's confess that we're forgiven we're purchased by the blood of Jesus Christ we're bought with the price and In God's Presence we're unblameable unreprovable and let's live on this Earth where we can accept God's rebukes we can daily confess our sins and we can overcome All Things by the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ let us keep God's word let's say God's word let's profess God's words and we surely overcome by the power of the spoken word in closing friends I hope this video has been a blessing by the grace of God it's so wonderful to see all those verses about being forgiven Colossians 1 Colossians 2 Romans chapter 8 and so many other ones 1 John chapter 1 Let's daily confess our sins and walk in the light as he's in the light let's confess the positive truths of God's word may life be in our tongue and not death let's remember God is rich in mercy God is quick to forgive God is slow to anger and rich in love remember a righteous man fth seven times but he rises up I'm reminded of a sermon I preached not long ago called so easily beset from Hebrews 121:2 the Bible said let us lay aside every weight and the sin which doth so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame shame and set down at the right hand of God friends let's run the Christian Race Free from weights of sin as Peter said in First Peter 2:11 let's not live life with all these wars in our minds because of fleshly sins we've given into let's confess them let's overcome them let's get our first love back let's be on Fire Let's do our first works by the grace of God remember in this age we're either cold lukewarm or on fire if you know the fire of God has come into your soul well let's that fire up by the grace of God let's crucify the the lust and the affections thereof let's overcome every weight let's lay them all aside and let's get our original fire back by the grace of God if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
