TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] God bless you and welcome to the defending the message podcast I'm your host Pastor Jesse Smith in today's podcast I'm going to answer a question I received from a viewer from El Salvador who asked me about the recent passing of brother Billy Paul Branham and my goal is to answer this brother's question and talk about brother Billy Paul's life with as much grace and brotherly kindness as possible and as anyone who follows my Ministry knows I've had to take a stance against brandham Tabernacle because of the 24 plus lies that they are propagating and sharing worldwide with millions of people promoting a false message and I believe preaching another Jesus and so to answer the brother's question I have to share where I differ with my precious brother the late brother Billy Paul brandham and I use that same terminology that brother brandham used brother brandham said here's where I differ with my precious brother Uriah Smith who had already passed away that's the terminology brother brandom used in the fist seal in 1963 regarding his differences with URI Smith so by God's grace we'll look at the positives with the late brother Billy Paul brandham and then we'll look at the red flags or the concerns surrounding brandham Tabernacle and of course Billy Paul brandham and Joseph Brenham remember remember friends we are commanded to try every Spirit according to 1 John 4:1 we're called to prove all things according to 1 Thessalonians 521 and we're told to be ready always to give an answer for the hope within us according to 1 Peter 3:15 so let's begin with the positives here by God's grace uh we're thankful that brother Billy Paul helped brother brandom in the prayer lines in many many meetings and over the years I've heard some people say that they had testimonies of healings after brother Billy Paul had prayed for them so if those are genuine then I rejoice in that it seems brother Billy Paul wrote many kind letters to people and tried to answer lots of questions and he seemed to pray for the prayer requests that people sent to him whether through letter or email and when I wrote to Billy Paul in 2020 I thanked him for the help he had in spreading brother bram's bible message and I specifically pointed out bible message because the Bible was brother brandom's absolute the tapes were not brother brandom's absolute so to whatever small degree brother Billy Paul helped spread the bible message I thanked him for that and of course Billy Paul testified to seeing the angel of the Lord which seeing the angel of the Lord is a wonderful testimony but we got to be careful not to take that too far friends as we know balum also saw the angel of the Lord Judas es scariot lived and ministered with the Lord Jesus for three and a half years and Cain talked plainly with God heard the voice of God and yet left the presence of God but again we are thankful for brother Billy Paul helping brother brandham in the meetings and then he was privileged to see the angel of the Lord now getting into the concerns or red flags is another way I describe it the red flag surrounding br Tabernacle and of course the late Billy Paul brandham and the current Pastor Joseph brandham you know over the years for each person that I've had doctrinal concerns with I've just made a list of red flags or concerns with them uh Wikipedia says a red flag is like a warning like you'll see red flags at beaches when there's dangerous weather conditions in auto racing they put up a red flag when a race has been stopped so over the years I've used that terminology I have red flags about certain people's Ministries and one example is when I just come in the message I was attending a church in Lima Ohio and there was another church in the city that was much larger much more popular but I had many red flags about that Pastor I think I had written down five or six red flags for example the pastor allowed the women to cut their hair to trim them to wear makeup but not make it very noticeable he had told the parents they could let their children listen to rock and roll as long as they had headphones on he had the false Doctrine about the baptism of the Holy Ghost saying you could have the Holy Ghost just by reading a paper and trying to become saved which is basically misinterpreting the quote about baptism of the Holy Ghost without sensation then friend sure enough after all these five or six red flags this pastor left the message and now attacks brother brandham and that situation taught me to make a list of red flags about Ministries and so that's what I've done of course with brandom Tabernacle so as you've saw this year if you follow my Ministry we have over 24 red flags about brandham Tabernacle and friends again we're commanded to do this it's not an easy thing to do it's not a fun thing to do uh but remember 1 Corinthians 11: 19 there must also be heresies among you that they which are approved may be made manifest among you I try to encourage people when there's problems in the church try try not to be discouraged but just try to stand with the truth with as much love as possible these heresies must happen so that the True Believers can be manifested so let's look at some concerns of red flags I had about brother Billy Paul and of course brandham Tabernacle so back in 2020 I sent a letter the same letter to Joseph brandham and Billy Paul and in the letter I thank them for their service to try to spread the bible message of their father but I said I felt they had at least five false doctrines now of course this number has grown to 24 but in that letter I brought out five uh Billy Paul wrote me right back so did Joseph um but Billy Paul was very kind but he did not address any of the five false doctrines he just said he was going on vacation and he would pray for me and he appreciated my Christian Spirit if anybody wants a copy of that letter let me know I can email it to you um Joseph wrote me right back and gave me all these quotes to show where he stood so he basically doubled down on his false doctrines and never repented of anything so I also even made them a private YouTube video was about 18 minutes long I think and there was views on it I shared the links with them but again they never showed any repentance for these false doctrines also back in March of this year 2023 I made a video when will Los Angeles sink at the end of that video I addressed the story that Billy Paul brandham often told about how he said he was standing with his father in Los Angeles and supposedly brother brandom said you'll not be an old man when sharks will be swimming here and of course this quote is not on tape but Billy Paul has shared that around the world since his father's passing and it has caused many people to look at Billy Paul as a sign of when the Rapture might take place and now that Billy Paul's dead some people that believe that story from Billy Paul or put a lot of weight on that story from Billy Paul are maybe now concerned or trying to make a new meaning for what brother Brandon may have meant but in that video I put out in March I said I do not put a lot of weight on Billy Paul's testimony because of all the red flags in his life and because the story is not on tape so as I told our home Church we've been proven true now that Billy Paul's passed and Los Angeles still hasn't sunk and I remember even from that video brother brandom called himself an old man when he was 55 and 56 so Billy Paul was Far Beyond an old man at least according to brother bram's own definition of an old man Billy Paul was 88 if I'm not mistaken when he passed last week so I want to share a few more red flags I've had about Billy Paul's testimony remember friends uh Billy Paul was married twice which means he was an adulterer and brother Bram said this repeatedly on the tapes I'm not condemning him for being an adulterer but I'm reminding some people who may have forgotten of the choices that Billy Paul made when he was a young man and in 1964 questions and answers part two brother Brandon was asked if adulterers could go in the Rapture and he said quote there might be a chance end quote of them quote getting in end quote in that same series of course brother Brandon mentioned how Billy Paul was an adulterer so we know this would apply to him so even in brother Ram's own words he didn't know if there was a chance of adulterers going in the Rapture he was just hopeful that there could be a chance so we got to keep that in mind brother Brandon if a man has been married and divorced isn't that awful see so many I'm not saying nothing against the people just that's on the people's mind sure they're troubled the're Rapture people used not think so much about that it wasn't so much of it but now it's just plastered the world how can both or one of them be in the Rapture I don't know I couldn't tell you the question is can they be in the Rapture divorced each one of them divorced each one of them has a living companion then they married again both of them married again and now one this woman has a living husband this man has a living wife and now they've got children and so forth and want to come to God can they go in the Rapture that'll be up to the heavenly father I couldn't answer that see I I saw one thing the Bible said that they shall be called an adulterer and the Bible said also an adulterer will not enter the Kingdom of Heaven that's all I can say I I know that just kills me to say that but I can't say but what the word say I'm going stay with that I hope that it's all wrong let's see there might be a chance of you getting in don't make two wrongs will never right in one just go to live the way you are if you're if you're happy together you might had the wrong companion I'll say this one thing if you got the wrong companion in this wife this life you'll never have it in the other one all wrongs will be made right I don't the question is asked the other day was a a norment a norment a norment the same as a divorce see when you ask me those questions friends you don't know what that does to me I've got many friends sitting here married two or three times did you realize I'm talking to my own son Billy Paul but I spare Billy Paul no indeed Billy Paul got married to some little girl and he come up and said Daddy I'm going to get married I was wash my car I said butt your head against the wall just kept on uh washing my car like that he said I'm going to get married I said oh go on just kept on like that he goes around tell his mother and his mother laughed at him you know what he done run off with some little kid still in common school and got married we an knowed the wedding the Father the girl and myself we an knowed the wedding but he was married just the same he's my boy s you're listening at me now that's exactly he come to me with the girl he lives with now my daughter-in-law my little grandson he said Daddy will you marry me I said by no means that's my own son you think that don't cut me to the core when I packed him in my arms and done everything I could do and I've been both father and mother to him you think that don't kill me to say that but it's the truth certainly my boy sitting here listening at my daughter-in-law and my little grandson sitting right here now but I tell him it's wrong because I've got to I'm Duty bound to that word not be a hypocrit if I stood here because my own son sitting here that was promised to a girl I said if he never even had the ceremony set over him no matter if he ever lived with the woman or slept with the girl or whatever it was when he made that bow he's married amen Billy Paul or no Billy Paul that's exactly the truth he's married when he made that promise it's me it's the same we've got to be honest if I can't be honest with my boy I can't be honest with you if I ain't honest with you I won't be honest with God and I want you to believe what I tell you to be my honest to goodness opinion don't make anything else out of it just say it the way I said it see CU I'm going tell you the truth secondly I don't know how God will judge these people like Billy Paul and Joseph who promote or promoted idolatry by saying every word on tape is thus say the Lord they also say there's no mistakes on the tapes and of course brother B has quotes on the other side of both of these statements I hope Billy Paul repented before he passed we prayed for that at our church actually I want Mercy for Billy Paul and Joseph as we know God is a god of Mercy but friends we have to think sincerely about this about the mistake of saying every word a man said was thus sayi the Lord what if someone said every word Peter who was a prophet or Paul said was thus sayi the Lord any sensible person would say you're crazy for saying that now of course the word of God the Epistles that they wrote were thus sayith the Lord but not every single word they ever said was thus sayith the Lord I've told people as well remember in the Old Testament the tribe of Dan and Ephraim were blotted out of the Book of Life under Heaven because of their idolatry so all I know is there's great dangers in idolizing every word on brother braham's tapes as Billy Paul and Joseph and their movement so freely does and I've said this before idolators are either lost or perhaps in God's mercy God could save them as foolish virgins and yet God in his Mercy would allow them to have these awful complexes of idolatry and tape worship but again I'm not sure I cannot see how a holy ghost filled person can promote blatant idolatry because idolatry is heresy idolatry is false Doctrine the Bible says only those with sound Doctrine are born again it's 2 John 1:9 the Bible says Those Who abide in the doctrine of Christ have both Father and Son and the doctrine of Christ is to worship only God and never idolize anything the Bible says in 1 Corinthians 10 that we're to flee idolatry John says it in his Epistle of First John keep yourselves from idols and that applies to me that applies to every person we must keep ourselves from idols and if I have Idols then I want God to convict me of those Idols so I'll repent of those idols and I'll be pure in his sight but see friends I've tried so many times to help Billy Paul and Joseph see their Idols in their lives as far as I know they haven't repented but I hope Billy Paul did repent before he passed on and I keep praying for for Joseph to repent of course and Friends one perspective or one red flag is that I see Billy Paul and Joseph as rich men and they're most likely living off the ties which should be going to local pastors who preach the word of God and feed people's souls and in their system Billy Paul and Joseph really had no real accountability like there is in a local church who has a pastor who preaches and strengthens the people feeds the people but also has to get the leaven out of his congregation over the years I was burdened by the red flags or the words that Billy Paul would say he would say brother Brown's Ministry was a oneman message which was basically rejecting the five full ministry so it was a red flag when Billy Paul would say one man message but then when he would give testimonies he would act like a preacher anyone who's watched him give his testimony would agree to that he looks like he's preaching he's acting like he's preaching and yet then he'll say it's a one-man message so that's a very sad inconsistency that I saw and then brother brandom even said Billy Paul wasn't a preacher and yet Billy Paul would teach false doctrines as I've showed one of them I showed on my video called the seventh and eth of 24 lies coming out of brandom Tabernacle it was video 150 where Billy Paul said brother Brandon was identical to Jesus all but the Corporal body and that was a great hery so you can go watch that video or listen to that podcast if you like to better understand the that awful seat of discrepancy that awful false doctrine that came out of brandom Tabernacle and finally friends there were other red flags as well our precious brother Billy Paul would say just press play and Obey and yet the Bible doesn't say that brother brandom never said that and he would also say this God thought it brother random said it I believe it that settles it these statements have always been red flags because they seemingly idolize every word on brother bram's tapes they take out discernment they take out prayer they take out preaching they take out the fivefold ministry they take out words of wisdom they take out words of knowledge all the focus is on brother brandham and the tapes because that was the source of their income that was the source of their Authority and as brother random said the way a tree leans is the way a tree falls so I look at all these red flags I look at all these false doctrines over 24 false doctrines coming out of brandham Tabernacle I've just got to pray for them I've just got to ask God have mercy on them so that brings this podcast to a conclusion friends hope it was a blessing if you have any questions or concerns for me please reach out to me at my email address it's very it's much more easier for me to get back to emails so you
