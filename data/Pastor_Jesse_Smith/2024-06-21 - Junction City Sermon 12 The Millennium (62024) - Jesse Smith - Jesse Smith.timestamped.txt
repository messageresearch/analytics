[0:00] excellent brother thank you Revelation
[0:02] 20 we'll read verses 1
[0:04] to6 let's look at that Millennium
[0:07] brother brandom calls it the
[0:08] honeymoon for the husband Christ and his
[0:12] bride the church Hallelujah so it's our
[0:15] honeymoon with
[0:16] Jesus amen how you looking forward to
[0:18] that honeymoon
[0:20] hallelujah amen so so we are very much
[0:23] looking forward to this uh by God's
[0:26] grace what a promise a precious promise
[0:28] this is
[0:31] I'll read verse one now I'll read down
[0:33] to verse 5 and then you and I can all
[0:35] read verse six together but let me I'll
[0:37] read one through five just to go a
[0:39] little faster and I saw an angel come
[0:41] down from heaven having the key of the
[0:42] bottomless pit and great chain in his
[0:44] hand and he laid hold on the dragon that
[0:47] old serpent which is the devil and Satan
[0:49] and bound him a thousand years now just
[0:52] pause for a moment Satan's called four
[0:54] different names in in there does that
[0:55] mean he's four
[0:57] persons no he's got four titles just
[1:00] like God God's called father son Holy
[1:01] Ghost but is he three persons no he's
[1:04] one person that's a good verse to prove
[1:06] to those trinitarians right that just
[1:08] because you have more than one name or
[1:10] title doesn't mean you're more than one
[1:11] person Hallelujah verse three and cast
[1:14] him in the bottomless pit and shut him
[1:16] up and set a seal upon him that he
[1:18] should deceive the Nations no more till
[1:20] the Thousand Years should be fulfilled
[1:22] and after that he must be loosed a
[1:24] little season verse four now here's
[1:27] where you and I are brother R says this
[1:29] right here verse four is the Bride of
[1:31] the past and the bride right
[1:34] now whoever makes up the bride now will
[1:37] fulfill this verse in the Millennium so
[1:39] you're in this verse I'm going to show
[1:40] you where you are and I saw Thrones and
[1:43] they sat upon them see there's lots of
[1:46] Thrones during the Millennium and those
[1:47] are Thrones for the Believers the
[1:50] Christians and judgment was given unto
[1:53] them see they've got to judge now
[1:55] because they judged everything right on
[1:57] this Earth by the Holy Spirit Jesus
[1:59] wants them to judge during the Thousand
[2:01] Years hallelujah amen and I saw the
[2:04] souls of them that were beheaded for the
[2:06] witness of Jesus so all the martyrs like
[2:08] St Paul right he was beheaded many of
[2:10] the saints were beheaded so those will
[2:13] be the people sitting on the Thrones now
[2:15] here's and for the word of God brother
[2:17] Ram tells us word of God means Old
[2:19] Testament in Revelation so here's where
[2:21] Abraham Isaac and Jacob will be in there
[2:24] none of them were beheaded right correct
[2:26] but they serve God and so God honors
[2:29] their faith and God makes them a ruler
[2:31] during the Millennium unreal that's what
[2:33] Jesus told the Pharisees he said he said
[2:35] you will not sit with Abraham Isaac and
[2:37] Jacob in the
[2:38] Regeneration because you failed to
[2:40] recognize me the word hallelujah amen
[2:44] see there it is now here's where you and
[2:46] I now next and thank God for the and
[2:49] because we've not been beheaded and
[2:51] we're not Old Testament
[2:54] and which had not worshiped the Beast
[2:56] aren't you glad that you're not a part
[2:58] of the Beast system amen denominations
[3:01] right trinitarianism all those things we
[3:04] did not worship the Beast we did not bow
[3:06] a knee to the Beast system we're not
[3:08] Roman Catholics and we're not
[3:09] denominational sisters or Daughters of
[3:11] the Roman Catholic Church Hallelujah so
[3:14] that's where you are neither his image
[3:16] brother Ram said that's a World Council
[3:17] of churches or the United churches
[3:20] Protestants neither had received his
[3:22] Mark upon their foreheads brother Ram
[3:23] said uh that's their Doctrine you didn't
[3:26] take their Doctrine their Trinity Dogma
[3:29] right and their sprink babies and
[3:30] everything that they do and and uh their
[3:32] trans transubstantiation turning the
[3:35] bread and wine into the literal body and
[3:37] blood of Jesus you didn't take their
[3:39] Mark in your forehead
[3:41] right or in their hands and brother R
[3:43] said that's doing the will of the Beast
[3:46] Church doing what they want you to do
[3:49] you don't take their Mark here or here
[3:50] you don't do what they tell you to do
[3:52] you've come out of those churches
[3:54] hallelujah amen and they lived and
[3:57] reigned with Christ a thousand years so
[3:59] look live you get to live a thousand
[4:02] years and Reign that means have dominion
[4:05] or Rule and you've got a throne unreal
[4:08] now I know it's hard it's hard to think
[4:10] right sisters it's hard to think Jesus
[4:11] has a throne for you but it's the word
[4:12] of
[4:13] God you'll sit with your husband
[4:16] hallelujah amen verse five but the rest
[4:19] of the dead now this is foolish virgin
[4:22] Sinners make Believers the rest of the
[4:24] Dead live not again till the thousand
[4:25] years were
[4:26] finished this is the first resurrection
[4:30] and we'll show that in just a moment now
[4:31] let's all read verse six ready 1 2 3
[4:33] blessed and holy is he that hath part in
[4:37] the First Resurrection on such the
[4:40] second death hath no power but they
[4:43] shall be Priests of God and of Christ
[4:46] and shall reign with him a thousand
[4:49] years may God add his Blessing to
[4:50] reading of his word you can be seated
[4:52] praise God sorry I got a little itch
[4:53] there so I think this is really nice I
[4:55] really appreciate brother Chad God bless
[4:57] him amen met him the one time when we
[5:00] baptized y'all that's the only time I've
[5:01] ever met brother Chad I've just you know
[5:02] we never pass Cross or our P never
[5:04] crossed that's okay but they'll cross in
[5:06] heaven Hallelujah so I just want I'll do
[5:09] a timeline like he did uh I thought that
[5:11] was really
[5:12] nice it's not very
[5:14] straight I'm kind of a teacher I kind of
[5:17] got to be a little straighter than that
[5:18] don't I
[5:20] now go a little straighter there by
[5:22] God's grace all right go now let's just
[5:25] list the the events now if you want to
[5:27] know brother rand's teaching on the
[5:28] order of events you have to listen to
[5:30] questions and answers
[5:32] 1964 there's four sermons uh two weeks
[5:35] in a row he does a morning evening
[5:37] morning evening in August of 64 and in
[5:40] one of those I don't know I don't
[5:41] remember which one I got in my notes he
[5:43] goes through the order of all the
[5:45] events okay so we'll just start here
[5:47] with the order uh I kind of like to show
[5:50] you uh a little bit of of everything
[5:53] here uh let's just say uh this is a Jew
[5:57] and this is the law
[6:00] right and then I like how brother Chad
[6:02] grew drew that Red Cross aren't you how
[6:04] many appreciate the bloodline Hallelujah
[6:05] brother brother said he preached on The
[6:07] Blood Line
[6:09] Hallelujah so now of course there was
[6:11] time before this right we know there's
[6:13] time before that but I just want to show
[6:14] you God dealt with Israel right but then
[6:16] he Jesus said I must go get other sheep
[6:18] of a different fold and make one fold
[6:21] right so now since then we have the
[6:23] church
[6:24] ages so this is
[6:27] Gentile Church age
[6:33] this is very
[6:34] familiar now there's there's scriptures
[6:37] for all this I have videos on all these
[6:38] things uh just laying it out through the
[6:40] Bible now I want to write down here Luke
[6:45] 2124 says uh Israel oops Israel be
[6:49] trotten down to the
[6:51] Gentiles uh until the time of the
[6:53] Gentiles be fulfilled so another name
[6:55] for the Gentile Church ages is times of
[6:58] the Gentiles all right now after that uh
[7:02] I just use blue blue sky so after that
[7:04] we have the
[7:06] Rapture I'll just call that the
[7:12] Rapture okay and brother random says
[7:15] this is the wedding ceremony so I'm
[7:17] going to put
[7:20] ceremony because it's a type how many
[7:23] remember back in January when I preached
[7:24] on uh the bride the bride of Christ The
[7:26] Mystery of the bride of Christ remember
[7:28] that it's all through the Bible Jesus is
[7:30] the bridegroom but he's got a bride
[7:31] Hallelujah and his bride has made
[7:33] herself ready Hallelujah Revelation 19
[7:36] now here's what I want to look at just
[7:38] tonight here let's look at now the Trib
[7:40] this is called the Great
[7:42] Tribulation because uh Daniel calls it
[7:44] the greatest tribulation I'll just write
[7:46] great
[7:47] Tri now whether you believe it's three
[7:49] and a half or seven brother Ram says
[7:51] both so brother Ram's learning right I
[7:53] believe it's seven most people believe
[7:54] it's three and a half I'm just different
[7:56] you know I'm just I'm just different
[7:58] okay I is you I I don't know why I can't
[8:01] agree with everybody all the time but I
[8:02] just the way I see it I try to see it
[8:03] the best I can but you have the Great
[8:05] Tribulation there now there you have the
[8:07] two witnesses uh I'll just write two
[8:10] witnesses down here that's Moses and
[8:12] Elijah or brother Ram says it's two
[8:14] people Anointed with the spirit of Moses
[8:16] and Elijah okay that's
[8:19] Revelation uh let's see that' be
[8:21] Revelation 11 okay all right now after
[8:26] that you got uh I guess I could do
[8:28] another uh
[8:31] so I guess here during this
[8:33] time while they're in the Great
[8:35] Tribulation now the bride goes to the
[8:37] wedding
[8:39] supper so like the the wedding Feast
[8:45] am
[8:46] okay and then she comes
[8:49] down that's for that's called the battle
[8:52] of Armageddon so I'm going to put battle
[8:55] now it's a really short period here but
[8:56] I'm just going to put do a separate
[8:58] block here battle I'll just put arm
[9:01] again in here sideways
[9:04] arm
[9:06] battle okay and that's in
[9:11] Revelation uh 19 it's 11 to the end I
[9:15] can't remember the last verse there
[9:18] okay all right now after the battle of
[9:21] armagedon now is what we're going to get
[9:23] to today it's the Millennium thousand
[9:25] years of no war right thousand years of
[9:28] peace right so this is what we're going
[9:29] to look at today by God's grace so just
[9:32] give you a little background here now
[9:35] brother R also calls it the day of the
[9:36] Lord he calls it the honeymoon but the
[9:38] Bible definition is the day of the Lord
[9:41] okay so I'll write that the day of the
[9:45] Lord and you'll see that all through the
[9:47] scripture the day of the
[9:49] Lord the
[9:54] Millennium remember Satan Satan uh
[9:58] actually is cast down here I'll just
[9:59] draw a little line here want to do a
[10:01] green one here from the devil Satan is
[10:04] bound
[10:05] up Satan is in a bottomless pit we read
[10:08] that here
[10:09] today uh pit I'll just put
[10:12] pit but then he comes back here at the
[10:15] end right all
[10:17] right so here we have the ceremony
[10:20] wedding supper and here we have the
[10:27] honeymoon this is the Wiest it's ever
[10:30] been isn't it hallelujah usually I'm
[10:31] yelling and screaming by
[10:33] now all right so everybody see that by
[10:36] God's grace we want to focus on this now
[10:38] if you know your Bible real well or as
[10:40] you're learning you'll eventually learn
[10:41] here then the next thing Satan comes up
[10:44] uh for the Battle of go and Magog so
[10:47] I'll put it like this
[10:50] and I'll just put
[10:52] Gog and Magog and that just means uh a
[10:57] section in Israel where they're going to
[10:58] fight
[10:59] uh in Ezekiel though it means Russia and
[11:02] China just so you know G and Magog in
[11:04] Ezekiel is Russia and
[11:06] China so you know that brother T brother
[11:09] teaches that he says Russia is go and
[11:11] Magog but it's Russia and China that
[11:13] come against Israel uh at the end of the
[11:17] Great Tribulation period so there's a
[11:18] lot in here there's a lot of Prophecy in
[11:20] here and I can't hit all of it okay so
[11:23] Gog and
[11:25] Magog just do real
[11:27] small okay and at that point Satan at
[11:30] the end of that Satan is cast into the
[11:33] Lake of Fire so I'll just put a fire
[11:34] down
[11:38] here okay and then the white and after
[11:41] that we have the great white Throne
[11:45] judgment I'll just say
[11:48] white
[11:51] throne and that's where everyone every
[11:54] the Bible said even death and hell will
[11:56] deliver everything up to be judged death
[11:58] and Hell it's almost like they have some
[12:00] type of it's like they're almost like an
[12:01] individual person right we say the angel
[12:04] the of death the death angel right it's
[12:06] almost like they have their their own
[12:08] power death and Hell deliver up every
[12:11] soul to the white throne and then Jesus
[12:14] separates them as sheep and goats but
[12:17] the Bible also said we'll sit with Jesus
[12:18] on the throne and judge there as well
[12:22] remember Jesus said the queen of the sh
[12:24] South she'll judge all those Pharisees
[12:27] because she crossed the desert to hear
[12:28] Solomon
[12:29] but Jesus said a greater than Solomon is
[12:32] here so friends your lives you know your
[12:36] lives what what you've overcome your
[12:38] life will judge others who fail to
[12:40] overcome where you overcame
[12:43] Hallelujah so see you must overcome
[12:46] today during your lifetime you must like
[12:47] our I like what our brother said now
[12:49] let's see what Christ is doing right now
[12:50] you know what he's doing right now he's
[12:51] getting preeminence in you and I
[12:53] hallelujah amen he's helping us overcome
[12:55] he's helping us Reign Over sin
[12:57] hallelujah amen
[12:59] so white Throne is where everyone
[13:01] separated uh and then the last
[13:03] thing uh is the earth I'll just draw
[13:06] Earth here the last thing is the New
[13:10] Jerusalem coming
[13:12] down uh from God that's my best pyramid
[13:15] there not not much of an artist right
[13:17] New
[13:23] Jerusalem okay and you know that's
[13:26] revelation 22 and Revelation 21 by God's
[13:28] grace
[13:29] now I'll be writing on here as we go
[13:31] through the scripture if you have your
[13:32] Bible handy we'll try to hit the
[13:33] highlights here like I said I could
[13:35] probably teach two hours straight on
[13:37] this and still not get done I don't want
[13:39] to do that Hallelujah I want to respect
[13:41] your night and some of you labored out
[13:43] outside all day in the hot sun so God
[13:45] bless you all for your love and your
[13:47] Devotion to the the calling of God on
[13:49] your life amen okay so uh we're just
[13:52] going to go fast here uh Daniel 9:24
[13:57] says 7 weeks were given to uh Israel and
[14:03] there were six purposes okay the fourth
[14:06] purpose was to bring in Everlasting
[14:08] righteousness seal up the vision of the
[14:10] most holy and to anoint the most
[14:13] holy so those three ones at the end are
[14:17] all about the Millennium so the
[14:20] Millennium brings in Everlasting
[14:23] righteousness so I'm going to write
[14:24] Daniel 9:24 and it anoints the most holy
[14:31] [Music]
[14:34] I love what brother brand
[14:36] says during the Millennium a millennial
[14:39] Temple will be built oh that's right and
[14:41] you need to see it it's in uh
[14:43] Ezekiel brother says Ezekiel
[14:47] 40 it's chapters 40 to
[14:51] 48 there are eight chapters that talk
[14:54] about this new Temple that's going to be
[14:56] built during the Millennium and it's
[14:58] going to be right there there in
[14:59] Jerusalem Hallelujah uh it's 750 ft long
[15:03] so brother irin do you know about how
[15:04] many feet to your barn over there do you
[15:06] any idea how many feet out there to your
[15:08] Red Barn probably 300 300 okay so double
[15:12] that and a little more that's just one
[15:14] side of that Ezekiel Temple the
[15:16] millennial Temple Hallelujah that's just
[15:18] one side now that is small church this
[15:20] is small in comparison to New Jerusalem
[15:23] the New Jerusalem is
[15:24] 1,500 miles long one side but that's
[15:29] from Maine to Florida I measured it out
[15:30] on the map that's right one side is
[15:33] Maine to Florida but you and I get to
[15:35] live there with Christ hallelujah amen
[15:37] that's one side is 15,000 I'm sorry 1500
[15:40] miles wow but the Ezekiel one is only
[15:42] 750 ft so it's much smaller um and all
[15:46] the nations have to flow into it and
[15:48] they have to learn to obey Christ
[15:51] because they didn't obey Christ during
[15:53] during this whole uh human history they
[15:56] never obeyed Christ okay
[15:59] so um I like what brother Ram said
[16:01] brother Ram said that uh Satan in Luke
[16:04] chapter 4 Satan said Jesus Bow Down and
[16:08] Worship me and I'll give you all the
[16:09] kingdoms of the world and brother R said
[16:11] Jesus said get behind me Satan because
[16:14] he knew he was going to fall air to them
[16:16] in the Millennium hallelujah praise God
[16:20] so he Satan tried to tempt him just take
[16:22] these kingdoms now and Jesus said no I'm
[16:24] going to get him in the Millennium
[16:25] Hallelujah am and that's found in Luke
[16:27] chapter 1 so if you got your BBL Luke
[16:29] chapter 1 he's promised the Throne of
[16:32] David Luke I think it's 133 if I'm not
[16:36] mistaken I preach it last night and I'm
[16:38] kind of skipping a little bit just to
[16:39] hit the
[16:47] highlights church this is what you can
[16:49] live for when sometimes when you go
[16:50] through trials just remember it's all
[16:52] training so you can Reign Over sin that
[16:55] God can trust you to Reign during the
[16:57] Millennium Hallelujah
[17:02] verse 32 he shall be great and he shall
[17:04] be called the son of the highest and the
[17:06] Lord God shall give unto him the Throne
[17:08] of his father David and he shall reign
[17:11] over the house of Jacob forever and of
[17:14] his kingdom there shall be no end
[17:17] Hallelujah so this is the Throne of
[17:19] David this is the son of David Ministry
[17:21] brother brand calls
[17:23] it because uh this is the time where the
[17:25] the kingdom of David has no end for a
[17:28] thousand years and then really it
[17:29] basically continues into the uh the New
[17:31] Jerusalem because he's ruling right so
[17:34] this is the uh I guess we could write
[17:36] the Throne of David here yeah we could
[17:38] say the throne or the son of David here
[17:41] we'll call it son of David
[17:47] here son of David is that a very good
[17:51] o now how many know brother Ram said
[17:53] there Jesus has three names as a son
[17:56] he's son of man prophet
[17:59] he's Son of God right now high priest in
[18:02] heaven and during the Millennium he's
[18:04] son of David Hallelujah son of man Son
[18:08] of God Son of David now during during if
[18:11] you read the the uh if you read the
[18:13] gospels he's called all three of them
[18:15] right right but it and and then there's
[18:18] there's no you know strict separation
[18:20] like that he can be called any of them
[18:22] but the main point is that you see all
[18:24] three he's a prophet priest king that's
[18:27] all right amen prophet phet priest king
[18:29] just like David David was a
[18:31] foreshadowing of it David was prophet
[18:34] priest and King he foreshadowed Jesus
[18:36] Christ hallelujah amen and he was a man
[18:39] after God's Own Heart amen and David
[18:41] means beloved right and and the voice
[18:44] when Jesus got baptized the voice said
[18:46] this is my beloved Son in whom I am well
[18:49] pleased hallelujah oh my David was a
[18:52] prefigure he was a perfect type of Jesus
[18:54] Christ
[18:55] Hallelujah so we got son of man uh yeah
[18:59] son of man during his lifetime Son of
[19:01] God Son of David I should probably write
[19:03] that over
[19:04] here all right son of man then you then
[19:08] you'll understand that remember Ezekiel
[19:10] was called son of man then now he's Son
[19:13] of God because he's a high priest in
[19:18] heaven and then son of
[19:21] David sorry a little overlap in there so
[19:23] you can see that three sons names
[19:25] brother Braham said he comes in so a man
[19:28] now there's actually more he's also
[19:29] called son of Abraham in the gospels as
[19:31] well but these are the three that he
[19:33] mainly Works in here son of man Son of
[19:36] God Son of David okay now let's keep
[19:40] moving here by God's
[19:42] grace uh there's many quotes here
[19:44] brother Brown says this uh mighty God in
[19:46] Veil before us the church age book Jesus
[19:48] is the son of David he'll sit on the
[19:50] throne of David in the
[19:52] Millennium
[19:54] Hallelujah all
[19:56] right now the Millennium is the honey
[19:58] Moon uh they asked brother brandom in
[20:00] questions and answers part two he says
[20:03] will there be people on the Earth in
[20:05] Corporal bodies during the Millennium he
[20:07] said yes sir we will have our glorified
[20:09] body here on Earth eating drinking
[20:12] building houses and living just like we
[20:15] do now for a thousand years unreal so
[20:18] this is just like we do now except our
[20:20] bodies are perfect amen they're not
[20:23] going to get tired they're not going to
[20:24] get sore we're not going to get angry
[20:27] right we're not gonna we're not going to
[20:28] get arthritis or anything like that
[20:30] Hallelujah we have a glorified body
[20:32] which means a perfect human body
[20:34] Hallelujah and brother R said that's the
[20:36] honeymoon of the bride and the groom
[20:38] that's why I wrote honeymoon down here
[20:40] right we have H the ceremony the wedding
[20:42] supper there and then now then we got
[20:44] the the honeymoon there by God's
[20:47] grace okay so that's what brother Ram
[20:49] tells us that's question answers part
[20:51] 264 okay now I'm going to skip ahead
[20:54] here uh there's so many things I could
[20:56] say uh but I'm going to hold it I think
[20:58] it'd be better just to read more
[21:00] scripture tonight so that you get a good
[21:02] understanding of it now the Millennium
[21:04] is after the battle of Armageddon
[21:06] because the after the battle of
[21:07] Armageddon it cleanses the Earth for a
[21:09] thousand years so we want to read the
[21:12] scripture uh on that so let's go to
[21:15] Revelation 19 for the battle of
[21:17] Armageddon Revelation
[21:22] 19 verse 11 yeah and it's 11 all the way
[21:25] down to 21 I'll just fix that uh 11-
[21:34] 21 Battle of
[21:40] armagedon and I saw heaven open and
[21:42] behold a white horse and he that sat
[21:43] upon him was called faithful and true in
[21:46] righteousness he doth judge and make war
[21:49] his eyes were a flame of fire on his
[21:52] head were many crowns brother said
[21:53] where' he get those crowns the elders
[21:55] threw their crowns at him hallelujah
[21:58] amen that's Revelation chapter 5 amen
[22:00] they fall down and say we're not worthy
[22:02] you're worthy Jesus so he's he's having
[22:04] many crowns on his head
[22:08] Hallelujah he says and he had a name
[22:10] written that no man knew but he himself
[22:12] and he was clothed with a vesture dipped
[22:14] in Blood and his name is called the word
[22:16] of God look wherever he goes he's white
[22:18] but he's got red blood everywhere he
[22:20] goes he's the blood amen there there's
[22:22] the bloodline Hallelujah everywhere
[22:24] Jesus is there's got to be blood so he
[22:26] can have mercy on people hallelujah
[22:29] and notice he's also he's got a name
[22:32] it's called the word of God in the
[22:34] beginning was the word the word was with
[22:36] God the Word was God hallelujah amen so
[22:39] it's Jesus he's his name is the word
[22:42] verse 14 and the armies which were in
[22:44] heaven fed him upon white horses clothed
[22:46] in fine linen wide and clean brother R
[22:48] said that's the bride so you and I right
[22:51] here we come back uh at the Battle of
[22:52] army again we come back on white horses
[22:55] Hallelujah Jesus is the leading one and
[22:57] we're behind him praise God the armies
[23:00] of Heaven
[23:02] amen that's right now verse 15 and out
[23:06] of his mouth go a sharp sword and with
[23:08] it he should Smite the Nations and he
[23:11] that shall rule I'm sorry and he shall
[23:13] rule them with a rod of iron and he
[23:15] treadeth The Wine Press of the
[23:17] fierceness of the wrath of almighty God
[23:19] and he hath on his vesture and on his
[23:20] thigh a name written king of kings and
[23:23] Lord of lords amen now I'm not going to
[23:25] read the rest of it but that's when the
[23:27] birds come down after the after the
[23:28] sword comes out of jesus' mouth it
[23:31] destroys all these armies it's China
[23:33] it's Russia I think by that time brother
[23:35] said United States will probably be
[23:36] destroyed by that time right because
[23:38] they the in the seventh major Vision the
[23:40] United States was supposed to be
[23:41] destroyed at some point during the the
[23:42] tribulation period the Bible only says
[23:44] the go and Magog and the the armies of
[23:47] the East would come against Israel so
[23:50] that's an interesting point but notice
[23:52] the the sword comes out and it destroys
[23:54] the Nations but then it said he's going
[23:55] to rule over them and then all these
[23:58] birds come down and the birds eat the
[24:00] carcasses of these evil armies and
[24:02] brother said look that's the same way
[24:05] that Ahab and Jezebel died remember
[24:07] animals ate their
[24:09] bones and brother so look now we got the
[24:11] spiritual Jezebel the Roman Catholic
[24:14] Church unreal and so God puts the same
[24:16] judgment on spiritual Jezebel like he
[24:18] did on the natural Jezebel unreal dogs
[24:21] lick their blood right birds eat their
[24:24] flesh it's the Judgment because they
[24:26] rejected the Holy Ghost but thank God we
[24:29] received it hallelujah amen hallelujah
[24:31] we won't add to the word we won't take
[24:33] the ways of the world we'll take the way
[24:34] with the Lord's despised few
[24:36] hallelujah
[24:38] amen that's right
[24:41] Hallelujah so see the files of the ER
[24:43] take they they Feast on the Flesh of
[24:46] this wicked Army this Jezebel Army and
[24:49] they end the same way that the natural
[24:51] Jezebel ended okay now now you got that
[24:54] now you got battle of Armageddon
[24:58] now I want to go go to Malachi
[25:02] 4 because uh brother man said before
[25:05] Jesus can actually literally step on the
[25:08] Earth again it's got to be burnt over
[25:10] and brother R said that might be atomic
[25:12] bombs burning the Earth over uh it might
[25:15] be fervent heat you know Heavenly Fire
[25:17] Burning the Earth over but the Earth has
[25:19] to be cleansed before we can walk out
[25:21] into the Millennium brother bam teaches
[25:23] that many places so let's go to Malachi
[25:26] chap 4 verse 1 well John you want to
[25:29] read that can you read uh verses one and
[25:30] two brother but in the last days it
[25:33] shall come to pass that the mountain of
[25:34] the house of the Lord shall be
[25:36] established in the top of the mountains
[25:39] and it shall be exalted above the hills
[25:41] and people shall and people shall flow
[25:44] unto it and many nations shall come and
[25:47] say come and let us go up to the
[25:50] mountain of the Lord and to the house of
[25:52] God the god of Jacob and he will teach
[25:55] us of his ways and we will walk in his
[25:57] path
[25:58] for the law shall go forth of Zion and
[26:01] the word of the Lord from
[26:03] Jerusalem now that is a that's uh that
[26:06] is a a scripture there for the
[26:08] Millennium uh what was that verse
[26:10] brother would you read there what was
[26:12] that verse we're
[26:15] going that worked out okay what what
[26:18] verse was that m not M Mali sorry no
[26:21] that was that was okay though that was
[26:23] still a millennium
[26:24] verse and this is um 4 verse one and two
[26:29] is which yes that's actually a
[26:31] millennium verse so that worked out
[26:33] brother yes that's a yeah the mountain
[26:36] of the house of the Lord yes yeah
[26:38] because it says and many nations shall
[26:39] come and say come let us go up to the
[26:41] mountain of the Lord yes and to the
[26:43] house of the god of Jacob and he will
[26:45] teach you yes amen so he actually read a
[26:48] a verse ahead of time good brother I'm G
[26:51] to write that down it's Michael 4 1-5
[26:53] Micah 4 1 through 5 I thought it was a
[26:56] Malachi that worked out wonderfully see
[26:59] how the holy spirit's gracious brother
[27:00] to us that's now he read some wonderful
[27:03] things many nations are going to flow
[27:05] into Jerusalem now is that happening now
[27:08] no are all the nations flowing into
[27:09] Jerusalem trying to worship God no has
[27:11] it happened since Micah wrote this no
[27:14] Jerusalem has been destroyed I think 11
[27:17] times uh everybody almost every nation
[27:20] hates Israel this hasn't happened yet so
[27:22] it's either got to happen here or here
[27:25] but if you read the context it's here
[27:27] because look at the next verse look look
[27:29] what our brother said uh in verse two
[27:31] they're going to teach the ways but look
[27:32] at verse three and he shall judge among
[27:34] the people and rebuke strong Nations a
[27:36] far off so there's going to be Nations
[27:39] that are far from Jerusalem Jesus has to
[27:41] rebuke them right right because they
[27:43] won't come worship and they shall beat
[27:45] their swords into plow shears and their
[27:47] Spears into pruning hooks Nation shall
[27:49] not lift up a sword against Nation
[27:51] neither shall they learn War
[27:52] anymore but they shall sit every man
[27:55] under his Vine and under his fig tree
[27:56] and None Shall make them afraid for the
[27:58] of the lord of the hosts has spoken it
[28:00] for all people will walk everyone in the
[28:02] name of his God and we will walk in the
[28:04] name of the the Lord Our God forever and
[28:07] ever
[28:08] Hallelujah that's very good brother that
[28:10] worked out really good now uh let's go
[28:12] to Malachi 4 that worked out really good
[28:14] that was God that was God's love and
[28:16] God's grace right there that's beautiful
[28:17] behold the de cometh that shall burn as
[28:19] a no and all the proud Y and all that do
[28:22] wickedly shall be stubble and the day
[28:24] that cometh shall burn them up sayith
[28:26] the Lord of hosts that it shall leave
[28:28] them neither root nor Branch but unto
[28:31] you that fear my name shall the son of
[28:33] righteousness arise with healing in his
[28:35] wings and ye shall go forth and grow up
[28:38] as Cales of the stall was that right yes
[28:41] sir yes yep and now read uh verse three
[28:44] Yes dear brother wonderful and you shall
[28:46] and ye shall tread down the wicked for
[28:48] they shall be ashes Under The Souls of
[28:50] your feet in the day that I shall do
[28:51] this sayth the Lord of hosts amen all
[28:56] right now let me look up brother Ram's
[28:58] real quick
[28:59] here so brother quotes it many places he
[29:02] says uh during the Millennium he said
[29:05] that is when the righteous will have
[29:07] their day with the Lord so again he says
[29:08] the day of the Lord and then he quotes
[29:11] this verse the righteous walk on the
[29:13] ashes of the wicked so those same
[29:16] carcasses now it's hard to think about
[29:17] that but same carcasses that partially
[29:19] eaten up by the birds God sends fire and
[29:21] now they're just stubble now now these
[29:24] now these bodies and now these armies
[29:26] that have been defeated their bodies are
[29:28] like ashes and stubble and the Bible
[29:30] said we walk over them into the
[29:33] Millennium right because remember Satan
[29:35] must be bruised under our feet unreal
[29:38] that's what God that's what Paul told
[29:39] the
[29:40] Romans Satan will be bruised shortly
[29:42] underneath your feet that's right the
[29:46] Christians got to have dominion over
[29:47] Satan Hallelujah and his armies so we
[29:51] can see that now brother Ram uses this
[29:53] quote many times if you look up uh ashes
[29:56] walking on the ashes of the wicked but
[29:58] says it many times one time is Christ
[29:59] The Mystery of God revealed he says uh
[30:03] and the righteous walk out in in the
[30:06] Millennium upon the ashes of the wicked
[30:08] see so we can see he says it many many
[30:11] times he says it in questions and
[30:13] answers 62 as
[30:15] well all right so it just it's plain
[30:17] it's all through the message brother Ram
[30:19] says that okay now we got
[30:21] that all right let me see what's next
[30:24] here and of course I'll take questions
[30:26] at the end as well I'm going to try to
[30:27] watch my time I can see it right there
[30:29] I've already gone 31 minutes now that's
[30:31] crazy now I want to say this here uh
[30:34] brother Ram was asked about the
[30:36] Millennium and uh he says well brother
[30:39] sister it's hard for me to understand it
[30:42] myself that was in questions and answer
[30:43] 64 part
[30:45] two okay so I want you to see that
[30:47] brother ramam said some things about the
[30:49] Millennium were hard for him to
[30:50] understand so we have to remember that I
[30:52] I might I'll tell you some of the things
[30:54] I've read here today some of these
[30:56] verses brother Ram did not used for the
[30:58] Millennium some of them he did okay like
[31:00] Micah he didn't use that for the
[31:01] Millennium but I can look at the
[31:03] scripture and see all the nations
[31:05] flowing in to Jerusalem to worship and I
[31:08] can see that they're still sinful
[31:09] because they need rebukes so it's got to
[31:12] be the Millennium it can't be here
[31:13] because they're all the Sinners have
[31:14] been destroyed here all the there's no
[31:16] more sin after the white Throne judgment
[31:19] because all the Sinners are done away
[31:20] within the Lake of Fire hallelujah amen
[31:24] all right so a few of these I add in
[31:26] there because it's the same idea the
[31:28] same thought the same story the same
[31:31] context Hallelujah and then of course as
[31:33] you probably know there's no thus sayith
[31:35] the Lord from Brother brandom on the
[31:36] Millennium like he doesn't say thus sayi
[31:38] the Lord is this or thus say the Lord is
[31:39] that he was doing his best to teach it
[31:41] as a Bible teacher and so I'm I'm doing
[31:43] my best as a Bible teacher to put all
[31:45] the scriptures together that match the
[31:47] day of the Lord right amen and the way
[31:50] you know is because that there can be
[31:51] sin here but there can't be sin here
[31:53] that's how you know it's very easy very
[31:56] easy to understand that okay all right
[32:00] now here's what brother R said the
[32:02] foolish virgin will miss the Millennium
[32:03] this is in the church age book chapter 7
[32:06] which you can begin to see by these
[32:07] truths is much more important everybody
[32:10] say important important and wonderful
[32:12] say wonderful wonderful than we have
[32:15] ever thought or believed so brother R
[32:17] said the Millennium is more important
[32:19] than you believed and it's more
[32:21] wonderful than you've ever
[32:23] believed Hallelujah now here's my
[32:26] thought why is it important because you
[32:28] are given the position that God has
[32:30] ordained you to have eternally you
[32:33] finally come into your position where
[32:35] God wanted you to reign with your
[32:36] husband and rule over cities and Nations
[32:40] perhaps right you finally you finally
[32:43] live in total Victory amen total peace
[32:45] amen total total uh Purity total
[32:49] Holiness you uh as the Bible said you're
[32:52] finally a manifested Son of God Amen
[32:55] remember Romans 8 says that cre ation is
[32:58] groaning for the manifestation of the
[33:00] sons of God Amen brother says you will
[33:02] be the manifested Son and Daughter of
[33:04] God in the Millennium praise the Lord in
[33:07] other words you'll fully manifest the
[33:09] power of God through your life oh
[33:12] hallelujah amen now let's get your
[33:14] Bibles handy I want to uh read this uh
[33:16] brother Daniel I'm going to give you a
[33:17] verse here brother just a moment I want
[33:19] you to see where Jesus promised that
[33:21] we'd rule over cities and Nations if we
[33:23] were just faithful how many want to be
[33:25] faithful hallelujah amen me too so be
[33:27] faithful with your
[33:28] uh your your jobs your money be faithful
[33:30] with this church Hallelujah uh be
[33:32] faithful with your husband your wife
[33:34] your children be faithful and all it and
[33:36] then surely the one that's faithful and
[33:37] true will help you reign in the
[33:39] Millennium Hallelujah if you're faithful
[33:41] we know he's faithful hallelujah amen so
[33:45] uh brother Daniel let's do uh it's
[33:48] Luke let me see Luke 19:17 brother Luke
[33:51] 1917
[34:04] and he said unto him well thou good
[34:08] servant because thou has been faithful
[34:10] in a very little have thou authority
[34:12] over 10
[34:14] C
[34:17] amen how many
[34:20] cities 10
[34:22] 10 I can hardly handle my house with
[34:24] eight
[34:26] kids but Jesus said said if I'm faithful
[34:29] with whatever talents now in the in the
[34:30] parable you either get five talents two
[34:32] or one I probably I'm a one Talent
[34:35] preacher but if I can be faithful
[34:37] brother irin with that one he'll make me
[34:38] ruler over two cities right I don't even
[34:41] know I'm going to do handle two cities
[34:44] but I want to give you these so you can
[34:46] see what was that Luke 19 what was that
[34:47] 1917 brother yeah okay all right go to
[34:51] Revelation
[34:53] 2 226 and 27
[34:57] sister Lydia do you want to read that
[34:59] for us Revelation 226 and 27 whenever
[35:02] you got it
[35:14] sister
[35:18] Bren amen who gets that who gets to have
[35:22] power over Nations the Overcomer
[35:26] hallelujah praise God
[35:28] amen the Overcomer so brother says if
[35:31] you can just overcome Satan the flesh
[35:35] the devil and sin he said if you can
[35:37] just overcome those you will be crowned
[35:39] and overcover hallelujah amen glory to
[35:43] God if you can just stay true to the
[35:45] word of God and not be drawn out into
[35:47] sin or drawn out into denomination if
[35:49] you can just be led by the Holy Ghost
[35:51] and faithful to the word of God God will
[35:53] make you rule over Nations hallelujah
[35:55] thank you Jesus now I believe this the I
[35:57] believe this the apostles will probably
[35:59] rule over Nations and I'm I'm not
[36:01] talking about the 12 apostles I'm
[36:02] talking about uh missionaries sure
[36:05] missionaries during the church age will
[36:06] probably rule over Nations because Jesus
[36:08] said they get the highest reward
[36:10] remember he said he said anyone who
[36:12] leaves father mother land for my sake
[36:14] receives H hundredfold in the in the
[36:16] next life unreal he said there's
[36:18] 100-fold 60-fold 30-fold rewards there's
[36:21] always these three levels of rewards
[36:23] three three is a good number Perfection
[36:25] Hallelujah
[36:27] so see there's always this these level
[36:29] rewards and that's what the Millennium
[36:31] is the Millennium is to reward you for
[36:34] letting Jesus Ru in your life Hallelujah
[36:37] if you let Jesus rule your life now
[36:39] he'll make you a ruler later on and look
[36:41] Church you even get a rod you even get a
[36:42] rod of iron like
[36:44] Authority see because there's there's
[36:46] going to be all these people for a
[36:48] thousand years there's going to be these
[36:49] heathens multiplying the Bible says so
[36:51] we're going get to that a little bit and
[36:53] they're going to need rebukes and some
[36:54] of you have to slam that rod down and
[36:56] say no this is how it's going to be no
[36:59] that's what the Bible says Rod of iron
[37:02] right they need rebuked right they need
[37:04] to be taught the ways of the Lord
[37:07] because God Jesus has never had a
[37:09] thousand years to rule over the world
[37:12] yet he's never had that time to rule
[37:15] because brother R said this is the day
[37:16] of man's rule right Biden rules Justin
[37:21] Trudeau rules in Canada right really
[37:24] it's Satan ruling behind them right we
[37:25] know Satan owns but brother said this is
[37:28] the day of man but the Millennium is the
[37:30] day of the Lord hallelujah amen that's
[37:32] the Lord's day amen amen when Jesus
[37:35] rules and he places those that were
[37:36] beheaded those that believe the word of
[37:39] God and those that did not worship the
[37:41] Beast he places them as rulers as Kings
[37:44] and Priests unto God hallelujah
[37:47] amen
[37:49] hallelujah so you rule and reign with
[37:51] Christ uh for a thousand years now uh
[37:55] how many know you're a spiritual priest
[37:57] unto God how many know
[37:59] that let's go to Hebrews
[38:03] uh I think it's Hebrews 12 if you would
[38:05] go to Hebrews
[38:06] [Music]
[38:11] 12 no I'm sorry it's Hebrews 13:15 yeah
[38:15] here's how so that's how you're a king
[38:17] you're a king or queen because you rule
[38:20] over sin but you're a
[38:22] priest because you do this scripture
[38:27] brother iring do you want to read this
[38:28] one this is Hebrews uh
[38:31] 13 uh it's 15 and 16
[38:35] brother by him therefore let us offer
[38:38] the sacrifice of praise to God
[38:41] continually that is the FR of our lips
[38:44] giving thanks to his name but to do good
[38:48] and to communicate forget not for with
[38:51] such
[38:53] sacri amen the church
[38:56] said the ible said offer the sacrifice
[38:59] of praise so even when you don't feel it
[39:01] I know it's late on wedes Thursday night
[39:03] we probably all worked hard today but if
[39:05] we say praise the Lord that's a
[39:07] sacrifice unto God amen amen you might
[39:10] have been chasing children around all
[39:11] day right you might working out in the
[39:13] store all day you might work in the
[39:14] cafeteria all day you might have been
[39:16] working out in the hot sun all day but
[39:18] when you just come here and say God
[39:19] thank you God I love you that makes you
[39:21] a priest unto God hallelujah and you
[39:24] give him thanks remember that ver verse
[39:25] 16 do good when you do good that's a
[39:29] sacrifice that God receives you did good
[39:32] today you didn't do bad today you did
[39:33] good Hallelujah you did good you Tred to
[39:37] do good with your life and God sees that
[39:39] as a sacrifice well received now the
[39:42] word communicate uh there uh usually
[39:44] means uh money collection so ties and
[39:46] offerings so see when you pay your ties
[39:48] and offerings God sees that that's a
[39:50] sacrifice sometimes we need that money
[39:53] right so what's your choice you going to
[39:54] keep it or you going to sacrifice it
[39:57] hallelujah praise the Lord all right go

[51:06] Lord all right that's through through
[51:11] 25 that is amazing Hallelujah now
[51:14] there's so many more verses oh my go to
[51:17] Zechariah
[51:19] [Music]
[51:23] 14:16 this is a beautiful chapter uh
[51:26] this opened up to me just a few weeks
[51:27] ago Zechariah
[51:30] 14:16 this is a key verse CU here's
[51:33] here's something maybe maybe you didn't
[51:35] know I I didn't know it till a while
[51:37] ago during uh everybody say armag again
[51:40] ready AR Jesus comes out remember he's
[51:42] got the sword that goes out of his mouth
[51:44] and destroys the armies well some people
[51:46] are not going to be right there in the
[51:47] battle brother and they're going to
[51:48] survive that that attack W and whoever's
[51:52] left that survives Armageddon they're
[51:55] going to live into the Millennium and
[51:56] then they're going to fill up the Earth
[51:58] those are the ones we rule
[51:59] over that says right here Zechariah
[52:02] 14:16 and it should come to pass that
[52:04] everyone that is left of all the nations
[52:07] which came against
[52:09] Jerusalem shall even go up from year to
[52:11] year to worship the king the Lord of
[52:12] hosts and to keep the Feast of
[52:15] Tabernacles Hallelujah W see that now if
[52:20] you know other verses in Zechariah says
[52:22] all nations will come against Jerusalem
[52:24] and then Jesus Will rescue them right
[52:27] right and he rescues them in the
[52:29] Armageddon right so whoever is left out
[52:33] of all those that doesn't die when Jesus
[52:35] sends the sword of judgment whoever's
[52:38] left they have to learn to go up to
[52:40] Jerusalem and worship at the millennial
[52:42] Temple every year they got to go to the
[52:44] house of
[52:45] God hallelujah now look at verse look at
[52:48] 17 there's there's punishments and
[52:51] consequences if they don't worship Jesus
[52:54] look at verse 17 and it shall be that
[52:56] who so will not come up of all the
[52:58] families of the earth unto Jerusalem to
[53:00] worship the king the Lord of hosts even
[53:03] upon them shall be no
[53:05] rign see this hasn't happened yet right
[53:08] this hasn't happened right California
[53:10] doesn't worship Jesus yet they still get
[53:12] rain right right New York doesn't
[53:14] worship Jesus yet they still get rain
[53:17] not everybody in Ohio worship Jesus they
[53:18] still get rain but in the Millennium if
[53:21] you don't worship God there's an instant
[53:23] consequence no rain unreal because this
[53:26] is the day of the Lord this is the
[53:28] Lord's ruling
[53:30] hallelujah amen so see there's still
[53:33] punishments look at verse uh yeah finish
[53:36] 18 there shall there shall be the plague
[53:40] where with the Lord will Smite the
[53:41] Heathen that will not come up to keep
[53:43] the Feast of Tabernacles this shall be
[53:45] the punishment of Egypt and the
[53:47] punishment of all Nations that come not
[53:49] up to keep the Feast of
[53:52] Tabernacles Hallelujah so every nation
[53:55] around the world is required to come and
[53:57] brother BR said there won't be any
[53:59] Automotives in the Millennium so they're
[54:01] going back to the horse and carts so the
[54:04] Amish people they got a good thought
[54:08] there that that's that's what the Bible
[54:10] says they're going to have chariots and
[54:11] carts they have to make a trip every
[54:13] year an annual trip all around the world
[54:16] to come and worship Jesus Christ if they
[54:17] don't they're getting plagues and no
[54:20] rain see because because they have to be
[54:22] taught he's going to teach the whole
[54:24] world he's Lord of lords he's King of
[54:27] Kings he's king of creation he's creator
[54:29] of the whole earth and they must learn
[54:31] to know him they must learn to worship
[54:33] him if not there's
[54:34] consequences this is the day of the Lord
[54:37] aren't you glad Hallelujah aren't you
[54:39] glad you know about it amen glory amen
[54:42] and you can be prepared for it
[54:44] Hallelujah now look at verse 21 I'm
[54:46] going to skip verse 20 go to verse 21
[54:48] yay every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah
[54:50] shall be Holiness unto the
[54:52] Lord of hosts and now look at this and
[54:56] all all they that sacrifice shall come
[54:58] and take of them and see therein and in
[55:00] that day there shall be no more the
[55:01] Canaanite in the house of the Lord of
[55:03] hosts so God's even going to kick the
[55:05] Canaanites out during the Millennium
[55:07] they're either that or they're destroyed
[55:09] but notice all they that sacrifice so
[55:11] when these nations come around the world
[55:13] to worship Jesus for a thousand years
[55:15] they got to bring a
[55:16] sacrifice and Ezekiel talks about that
[55:19] where the priests are going to cut up
[55:20] sacrifices during the Millennium animal
[55:24] sacrifices they are going to be taught
[55:26] to worship God that's
[55:29] right now but did you see verse
[55:33] Zechariah 14:16 everyone that's left of
[55:35] all the nations that come against
[55:37] Jerusalem shall go up to worship every
[55:40] year all right everybody can see that by
[55:42] God's
[55:43] grace amen all
[55:47] right now I'm already at about an hour
[55:49] I'm at 57 minutes so I'm going to try to
[55:51] bring this down to a
[55:53] close um
[55:57] yeah let's hit a hit a few more okay
[55:59] let's go to Isaiah
[56:01] 2 verse two Isaiah
[56:04] 2 it's really 1 to five but we're just
[56:07] going to read two and five Isaiah 2 1
[56:09] and
[56:17] 5 Isaiah 2 ver2 says and it shall come
[56:20] to pass in the last days that the
[56:22] mountain of the Lord's House should be
[56:23] established in the top of the mountains
[56:25] and shall be exalted above the hills and
[56:27] listen and All Nations shall flow into
[56:29] it that hasn't happened yet right nobody
[56:32] goes to Israel to worship Harley none of
[56:34] the Nations do this has to be future now
[56:38] go down to verse four and he shall judge
[56:40] among the Nations and shall what rebuke
[56:43] many
[56:44] people there's going to be rebukes yes
[56:47] there's rebukes during the Millennium
[56:49] because these people are heathens right
[56:51] they just they they survive the
[56:52] Armageddon and they're just going to be
[56:54] living it's going to be peace we're
[56:56] going to be ruling over them but they
[56:58] still need to be taught the ways of the
[57:00] Lord hallelujah so see there's rebukes
[57:03] in the Millennium amen all right

[1:01:35] everybody working hard today so in
[1:01:37] summary let me just close with this
[1:01:38] summary the Millennium has births of

[1:01:43] our families because we have glorified
[1:01:45] bodies it'll be all it'll be all the
[1:01:47] other nations including Israel Israel
[1:01:49] will have priests that will have to work
[1:01:51] in the temple with of of Jesus it's in
[1:01:54] it's in Ezekiel 4 4 if you want to read
[1:01:56] it already write that up there yeah
[1:01:58] Ezekiel that's
[1:02:02] chapters you can read all about it I
[1:02:04] would encourage you to do it uh remember
[1:02:06] like a priest has to marry a a virgin or
[1:02:10] a U or a wife or a woman who um married
[1:02:14] a priest before but the priest died and
[1:02:16] she was a virgin when she got married
[1:02:17] it's in Ezekiel 44 so even Israel will
[1:02:21] have Nations that are natural Nations
[1:02:23] having babies there will be some death
[1:02:26] we saw that in Isaiah 65 there'll be
[1:02:27] children families infants there will be
[1:02:30] marriages Ezekiel
[1:02:32] 44 there will be an animal sacrifices
[1:02:35] and I brother I can share this with you
[1:02:36] if you want there will be survivors of
[1:02:39] the battle of Armageddon I talked about
[1:02:40] that there will be plagues as
[1:02:42] punishments if Nations don't worship
[1:02:44] Jesus oh yeah let's read this and the
[1:02:46] apostles will judge the 12 tribes of
[1:02:49] Israel just as Jesus Promised hallelujah
[1:02:51] amen Peter will judge right Peter will
[1:02:54] judge maybe he'll judge man maybe he'll
[1:02:56] judge Ephraim he will judge because they
[1:02:59] were they had a higher calling amen and
[1:03:02] he had the Keys of the Kingdom
[1:03:04] Hallelujah Matthew 19:28 why uh who
[1:03:08] could read that one there brother irin
[1:03:10] you want to read that Matthew 19:28
[1:03:12] brother or wiin whoever's got their
[1:03:14] Bible uh thank you it's Matthew 19:28
[1:03:18] Jesus Christ promised the 12 apostles
[1:03:21] now of course Judas is out we believe
[1:03:23] Paul's in or Maas Mias was a mighty
[1:03:25] missionary don't ever think he was not
[1:03:27] used by God Mias was a mighty man of God
[1:03:30] I think he took the gospel to India if
[1:03:31] I'm not mistaken he went the
[1:03:33] furthest him or Thomas Thomas or Maas
[1:03:36] did amazing missionary work so brother
[1:03:39] it was uh Matthew 19:28 brother and
[1:03:43] Jesus said unto them I sayto you that
[1:03:49] [Music]
[1:03:56] hallelujah praise God Amen so Jesus sits
[1:03:59] in the holiest of holies but then
[1:04:01] there's Thrones out there and all the
[1:04:03] tribes of Israel got to come in and they
[1:04:04] got to listen to the 12
[1:04:07] apostles now I didn't write this one
[1:04:09] down you want to read you want to read
[1:04:10] this one
[1:04:13] uh Ezekiel 38 and 39 that speaks of
[1:04:17] Russia and China and it also says listen
[1:04:20] Saints Israel will be bearing Russian
[1:04:23] and Chinese bodies for seven months the
[1:04:25] the Bible said 7 months they'll be
[1:04:28] bearing these these uh bodies that are
[1:04:31] in uh ashes right stubble they're like
[1:04:34] stubble and then the Bible said for
[1:04:36] seven years brother irin they'll be
[1:04:38] burning the tanks and the planes and the
[1:04:41] guns for seven years it'll take to burn
[1:04:43] all those weapons of mass destruction
[1:04:45] that's what the Bible says unreal so
[1:04:47] there's a thousand years right but the
[1:04:49] first seven are bearing bodies and
[1:04:51] burning all the military devices un
[1:04:54] that's what God thinks about that right
[1:04:58] right that's in Ezekiel 39 9-12 but I
[1:05:01] just wrote both because you can read
[1:05:02] about uh go and Magog that's Russia and
[1:05:06] China all right also don't forget this
[1:05:09] I'm almost done in the Millennium we'll
[1:05:11] get answers from Jesus before we call
[1:05:14] right we'll rule up to 10 cities or you
[1:05:17] might even rule Nations now I believe
[1:05:19] the seven Church age Messengers will
[1:05:20] rule Nations I believe because they were
[1:05:23] stars in the very hand of God I believe
[1:05:26] we'll just rule cities because we're
[1:05:27] just little humble Christians we're not
[1:05:30] the stars in the hand of God We're Stars
[1:05:32] but we're not stars in the hands of God
[1:05:34] remember Abraham's seed was like the
[1:05:35] stars of heaven but we weren't the fiery
[1:05:38] stars in the hand of Jesus Christ I
[1:05:40] believe brother Randon will rule over
[1:05:41] Nations I believe Martin Luther will
[1:05:44] rule over Nations no doubt St Paul will
[1:05:47] hallelujah praise the
[1:05:49] Lord oh yes and there will be no Ark of
[1:05:53] the Covenant because the Lord is is
[1:05:56] there brother Bram said in God's power
[1:05:58] to transform 1965 he said and there will
[1:06:01] not be this kind of civilization in the
[1:06:03] world to come there will be no more
[1:06:05] automobiles or nothing that science has
[1:06:07] ever
[1:06:08] done see so all those planes all the
[1:06:10] tanks all the weapons that'll all be
[1:06:12] burned away even all the cars will be
[1:06:13] burned away
[1:06:15] unreal he said there will be no such
[1:06:17] things in that world that is to come it
[1:06:19] will be God's Own type of civilization
[1:06:22] that he'll set up in his glorious reign
[1:06:26] no sickness he says no no none of
[1:06:30] this he says it'll be a golden age he
[1:06:33] said it'll all be new there in God's
[1:06:36] civilization
