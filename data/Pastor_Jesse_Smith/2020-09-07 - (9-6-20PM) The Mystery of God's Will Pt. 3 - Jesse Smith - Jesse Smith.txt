god and uh i trust to be a blessing job trying to just preach about our lord willing tonight by god's grace i know everybody was so kind and everything but let's read 22 acts 13 22. let's read that together ready one two three and when he had removed him he raised up unto them david to be their king tomb also he gave testimony and said i have found david the son of jesse a man after mine own heart which shall fulfill all my will we always talk about wanting to be a man or a woman after the heart of god what does that do it obeys all the will of god we'll have a little stumblings here and there you know we'll make we'll make we'll have shortcomings and we'll slip and fall and but a righteous man rises seven times righteous woman rises seven times verse 36 let's read that uh on three one two three for david after he had served his own generation by the will of god fell on sleep and was laid unto his fathers and saw corruption let's have one more word of prayer if you have a need on your heart let's make it known unto god heavenly father we love you so wonderful to be in your house thank you for this weekend lord even though it's hot in here lord just refresh our souls lord

angels surround them lord i pray and father we'll give you all the glory all the days of our life in jesus christ's name the saint said amen god bless you being seated praise god just so you know um our church youtube channel got a strike against it because two three years ago i showed a video like a minute video and then the author of that video turned me in for doing it and and i forgot to delete it and have a strike against me so we can't do live stream on our church youtube channel so we're doing live stream through my personal youtube channel so if you ever like look for the link and it's not on there it's because we have a strike against us and i don't know i don't know how long i've emailed youtube i haven't heard back from them that's my mistake i will never show a video live from somebody else live on youtube so i had to learn the hard way but it doesn't matter i guess as long as as long as god is uh helping people you know really doesn't matter i guess so um i tried i emailed the gentleman to apologize he never emailed me back i mean i've done all i can do um so by god's grace let's uh just quickly review the will of god we started with what is god's will it's the desire of god god's will is his desire his choice his pleasure and it's a holy calling so whatever god's desire is for our lives holiness is at the heart of it we can't do god's will without uh living a holy life and then uh god initiates and reveals his will to every person remember that scripture came to my mind this week the bible said the eyes of the lord go to and fro upon the whole course of the earth that that didn't say half of the earth it said all the earth so god goes to every nation right his eyes go to every nation and that's why the bible said men are without excuse god is searching all over the world can i find a true worshiper is there anybody that wants to know me praise god he's made himself known in their bodies and in nature and then his holy spirit is constantly searching i'm glad he came looking for me praise god i'm glad he found me it took i was a stubborn fellow now i was raised in a church that knew the power of god but he was patient to wait 19 years for me praise god so i'll gladly praise him the rest of my days amen and i have now i've uh let's see i got saved in 19. so now i've given him more time because i'm almost 40. i've given him more years uh than i was in sin by god's grace so i i think that's a privilege praise god to serve god all the days of my life like brother man said i only have one regret i didn't do it sooner praise god and then we saw how god's will is sovereign uh it's immutable he doesn't ask for our desire he doesn't ask for our opinion he does what he wants and then he makes his will known to man through the word and then and then there's a future will that we must seek out called the progressive will of god we call it the progressive and then if we obey it it's called the perfect will of god if we disobey it it's called the permissive will of god praise god uh so let's pick up now we left off with there's two principles that guide god's future will uh the first one it will always be in the word amen if god is gonna ask us through anything it has to already be permission in the word of god okay we saw david bring in the ark we saw daniel found it in in jeremiah's writing he found the will of god to bring israel back after 70 years uh hananiah said two years but uh jeremiah stayed true to the word of god uh and then we we ended last time with you never trust a sign or wonder uh if the voice is wrong behind it okay um like for example last sunday night we preached on just 2020 the rapture right so if this if this man's dreams are right let's say they're right but his message is to load up on ammunition and food if that's the message and sit in your house and wait for somebody to come attack you that's the wrong voice that's not the voice for us praise god right yeah it might be the voice for somebody and amen and i were saying nothing's happened in september yet right now that's only been one week but we'll keep watching that by god's grace he said there was a tap three times on september we'll see and then he said uh november was smash but that's a that's a real application to our day even if something comes to pass the voice behind it has to be a scriptural voice has to lead us to the scripture of the hour praise god so we end it with that and then even if dreams whatever don't trust any dream preacher if it disagrees with god's word it has to believe i'm sorry it has to uh line up with god's word now let's go this is all new let's go to the second uh aspect it has to be god's will in his word and then it has to be in his time and season praise god uh often we try to enforce god's will too early right we try to do something before it's time uh and you know god is of course gracious if we repent king saul couldn't wait seven days in first samuel one he couldn't wait seven days uh to sacrifice so he forced himself into the past in the the prophet's office a church let's not be uh let's not be too harsh on saul because i think we all know this a lot of people try to push themselves into a prophet's office when they try to predict the rapture right right let's not be so harsh on saul saul went he forced himself into the prophet's office well in 2011 a man named harold camping you remember it he rented billboards all across i remember driving to lima and driving home in 2011 and there were billboards billboards saying the rapture is going to occur may 21st 2011. my pa my uh principal who was a homosexual at the time i'll never forget it the saturday before is may 20th i walked into the office he's staring at the screen with his mouth open like this and he said the world is supposed to end tomorrow and i was just studying that i looked at him i said no sir i said that man already predicted the rapture uh years ago he missed it i said he's wrong it's not going to happen i said that's according to deuteronomy 18. i said that's when i wasn't that bold you know i was kind of like real nice and i'm rarely ever that bold like yesterday i got the witness to this guy at home depot that jesus calling shirt you ever seen that it has a green uh button and a red button you can either accept jesus call he i said can you help me find this certain certain tool he's like i like your shirt i'm like oh you love jesus and he said uh he said no i just think it's a funny shirt and yesterday i've been trying to carry my books everywhere i go out in public in case i can give them out and i said hey i said i'm a christian i wrote a book about jesus do you want this book about jesus and he said no my heart was breaking you know i was like oh he's like i'm too busy i'm like okay okay okay and then you know another guy walked up to him to help him but as i walked away i thought wow jesus on my shirt said jesus is calling and that's exactly what jesus was doing to him and he turned it down yeah but i tried but i walked in there by the bang on my way and i said jesus please i just want to give out one book you know but he turned it down now i can't force him to do it i can't but all i can do is ask i'm glad i got a chance to ask praise god and so people force themselves into the prophet's office all the time remember do you remember that harold camping when he missed in may he turned he changed it to october do you remember that and then i knew for sure it ain't coming in october he died a year later he got diseased and died yeah he tried it miserably fared he he tried time and time again and then remember 2012 everybody said the mayan calendar down in south america runs out december 31st 2012 they counted the steps i guess their steps each step was a year and it was 2012 years and then it ran out well that day came and went here we are right and then 2015. i showed you that last week i was nervous for a while there was four blood moons that year pope came that year the president of china came that year there's a lot of things that happened but that came and went as well church a lot of people because it's the time and season of the rapture a lot of people feel like they need to predict because the timing is here but we've got to wait upon the holy spirit and paul said you'll know the times and seasons of the rapture we will know god will make it known to us praise god how many believe that amen i'll be with all my heart see you've got to know god's time in season david simon said a couple weeks ago david fell into adultery because he was out of season he should have been out to war against the kings see when we get when we're not ready for god's time season we either neglect it either we force it too early or we neglect it and we get in the permissive will of god it's a great sin to miss god's time and season that's why we've got to constantly live in his presence amen because luke 12 56 says you hypocrites now look at this jesus said you can discern the face of the skies of the earth but how is it that you not discern this time see even anyone that goes to church anyone that is spiritual that reads the bible knows this is the end time praise god did you see that this week church the fires in california have increased and they're worse than ever did you see that the fires are burning california more than ever look what they're at the same time they're burning the power went off two weeks ago remember that they lost power because they're trying to go uh green energy it's gonna fail they you can't do that there's not enough there's not enough light for that and at the same time they're the state that's shutting the church doors and taking churches to prison i'm sorry trying to take pastors to prison uh right now one church is being fined fifty thousand dollars every week and they're paying it people are just sending the money in there until they get the victory and you know too a couple years ago remember this they started putting the transgender curriculum into the schools out there they teach them from kindergarten up that they can change boy or girl and they marry whatever they put it in there now look at that god's judgment upon that place brother graham said in 64 he said judgment is striking the west coast that's a sad thing but if anybody should recognize the day or the coming of of the end times it should be us and we're glad we do praise god so see we must not force the season but then we can't miss the season as well so thank god that the bible says our our eyes are open and we are the children of the day we can't miss it because it's not dark to us it's light praise god we can see everything clearly praise god now that's the second part so it'll always be in the word but it must be at the right season okay now let's go into this next thought as i was studying the scripture i found so many verses that said when you do the will of god you're gonna have three things you have to do you have to serve which means you're not serving yourself you're helping other people so when you're in the perfect will of god you're serving you're submissive and you're suffering three s's okay now eventually we'll get to these questions who should i marry what job should i have where do i live what gifts do i have i have a section in the book of all those and i'll get to those lord willing next week but let's start with this we must do everything in god's season praise god now david is an example of service so these are some of the most beautiful like our scriptures we read today david served his own generation by the will of god amen the church when you find god's will you won't be serving yourself you'll be serving other people praise god god chose him to be king because of his heart now look at this you got to remember god chose you to do a hard thing when you do god's will it's hard but your heart's in it praise god amen it ain't easy for your body it ain't easy for your flesh all the time but one thing you always know your heart said it praise god amen that's why brother man said you never have to ask somebody uh to somebody else to do god's will it'll already be in you god already placed it in you praise god amen remember that acts 13 22 david a man after my own heart which shall fulfill all my will praise god so see he was he served his own generation and he did it by the will of god now remember this saul said that i'm sorry samuel said that david would feed israel remember that he said i took you from the sheep coast i'm sorry it's nathan nathan said god took you from the sheep coat and he set you to be king over israel to feed my people israel anybody catch that if you're feeding other people you're serving other people the parents should have said amen on that one amen amen i'll say it too see david part of being king was feeding everybody making sure all the tribes had food making sure everybody had jobs and positions that was part of serving other people so when you put food on the table you're doing god's will praise god right because a man that won't do it he's worse than an infidel so see david was called instead of shepherding sheep now he had to shepherd the the human sheep praise god so god's will was to feed protect and judge israel for 40 years all parents don't we know how much we got to judge all the time my girls are constantly asking me daddy is this right who's right here's a bickering here here's an argument here who's right i'm like okay help me to say it again yeah who's he'll help me now explain it again who's then other times i'm like just don't give me any details just let me ask you i can't i can't handle the whole story see we're called to feed protect and judge just like david did so see we're we're like kings on a small scale right in a spiritual way we're kings and priests unto god david natural and spiritual but we are certainly natural kings over our homes right but then spiritual kings over our family and we've got to feed protect and judge david served his generation by the will of god bathsheba even she found a place to serve she produced four sons solomon of course became the richest and wisest king of the time period my but without bathsheba solomon may not have been king because she had to use her influence and efforts to stop adenija from stealing the throne from solomon praise god so see how god used a woman there god used a woman she could have said well i made awful mistakes who am i to interfere with this right she could have she could have came up with any excuse well i did this and i was really i should not have bathed right there she could have come up with any excuse but she realized those things were in the past amen she forgot the past and she was pressing on toward the mark of the high calling in christ amen amen glory she knew they lost their child god had judged them right god had given that temporary punishment the consequence but now she knew that was in the past and she knew what god had said see she was standing for god's word she was going to do everything she could to make sure the son of david took the throne of god amen hallelujah and so she used her influence church and she did that and because of that they enjoyed many years of peace i don't know how many because remember after a while solomon baxter then god sent two kings against solomon because of his worship of idols so i don't know how many years it was some say 20 some say 30. but see because of her service because she kept she knew what david said by the word of the lord even though david was dying she she did everything in her power to bring god's will to pass to make sure solomon sat on the throne amen church david served also he served the people through music did you know he set up he established levitical worship using the instruments did you know he set that up he was the one that came up with that that was in uh first chronicles 15 and 16. dave is the one that came up with that that idea he's the one that taught him to play skillfully continually and ordain all those instruments you see today david's the one that set that up so god used him look look at all that david did he was truly a type of christ right he fed protected judge he set up the worship in the church and then he expanded their borders remember this we preached years ago in first kings 11 he expanded their borders to where joshua was promised to have him but he never reached him because israel was disobedient so not only did he serve in music he served through the military as well he helped all he helped the generation possess what was rightfully theirs praise god amen he restored the borders praise god he restored all god's promised word to god's people he restored it what a servant praise god amen you would say amen if you know you got your land back that you never had before wouldn't you yeah if somebody if somebody fought a victory for you and said well now here's 20 acres would you be sad about that or would you be happy i think you'd be pretty happy i have i have three quarters of one acre i'm pretty happy with that i wouldn't want to mow the other 9 or 10 or whatever but he won the victory and because of that god's people possessed what was rightfully theirs he helped them enjoy god's blessings for them without him it would not happen praise god so he served the generation through expanding uh the borders of israel and helping them to achieve all their god-given potential ah oh hallelujah thank god that's what this message has done praise god right it's made you for you sisters it's made you a real woman praise god right it's made you reach your godly potential not some striptease out there right but a real saint of god amen you brothers it took you uh it made you a real man of god somebody who's got a backbone that can stand on the word praise god not a pushover not a laughing stop not a drunk laying uh on the couch while your wife does all the work but you're there to help if you need to i know vane does right i know you know he does a good job of that he's a real good man praise god see you got a good man right there real man i'm just i love him i just teased him my wife got a good man too brother i help out all the time but see god made us real men we're not pushovers praise god and we might take a little bit abuse you know we might take some teasing but we're not going to go back into the world we're going to stand on god's word hallelujah amen you see these were victories were possible how did david serve god because every time he had a battle he prayed first amen church before every decision pray first amen amen pray first ask god to go before you praise god he was undefeated every time he prayed and inquired of the lord oh i love it that's what we see as well that's why i believe you know that that quote from the church age book shall be a should be an invincible army i believe that's future but i also believe it's present tense who can defeat us when we're under the blood of jesus christ who's ever defeated you nobody can defeat you you might you lose a few battles but you're not going to lose the war you're not retreating and let's go back to evil this is too hard no i then went through them i went through the wilderness praise god i've set up my house and i've established my family and i'm living on the the wine and the oil praise god i'm eating honey and i'm drinking milk and honey i'm eating making spiritual milk and honey praise god amen i act the same way at work praise god i don't yell but i act with the same joy everybody knows i had the joy of the lord i told you all those teachers come in they say we like being in your room there's a special atmosphere in your room well not right now because the kids are at home but you don't understand see we're possessing god's promises and fulfilling god's will for our lives it's a beautiful thing feeding the next generation praise god protecting judging the next generation amen i see my children i'm starting to see it you start i start to see little fruits in my children yeah i'm gonna make them nervous i'm gonna make i might embarrass them a little bit here tonight i see the gifts of god in their lives in case you're singing like that malachi playing like that lydia playing like that i see like haven i mean she can sing really good harmony i mean i see i see him brother bang i see those little buds starting to sprout there now if they can all just get born again praise god and know it hallelujah just like you and i amen okay don't we want to see all them in the power of the spirit and walk in the will of god and led by the holy spirit praise god that's what we all want that's why we protect them and judge them and feed them because we're training them to to take their place in the kingdom of god amen and then on top of all that saints david wrote 70 songs at least there's 150 psalms he wrote at least 70 of them how many songs have you and i written i was there when brother brooks wrote one song i was there we were driving the car and he's like he is my sword and shield my sword and she rock of ages lord jesus christ we've seen that a few years ago i was there when he's he came up with that one but that wasn't me 70 songs david wrote 9. and church many of them are sung today years later created me a clean heart oh god amen amen what a servant his whole life was when you write a song with amen when you sing a song you're serving us praise god sister who when you're on that computer you're serving us praise god i saw her earlier today adjusting the mic or just in the stand for brother amen right look at her serve you like that really man what a blessing what a blessing and all of us we gotta find our little ways to serve and to meet other people's needs right and david did all this he was a prophet and many of those songs prophesied of jesus crucifixion and resurrection a thousand years before they ever happened man what a servant that's the first thing so in david's life we see service the next s was submission when when you're in the will of god you can submit or obey commands now nothing sinful the holy spirit will never lead you to sin but the bible said first submit to god james 4 7 there's good old james james 4 7 submit yourselves therefore to god amen see you'll never be able to submit to the church or your brother sisters until you submit to god first amen submit to god resist the devil and he'll flee from you then ephesians 5 21 submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of god that's why it was hard brother vang but when a couple of saints asked me uh three saints asked me to record my book my modesty book that was like i spent about 30 hours on that i dropped everything and i got it done in two weeks you know because i i kept hearing people ask me i'm like okay i'll submit to you i really didn't want to do it it was a lot of work but if somebody gets one blessing if the saints need it and if i can submit myself to them i'll do it by god's grace i just set aside whatever i was working on that's why it's taking me a little longer to get the book done i set aside about 30 hours because i want to submit to myself to other people i want to be in the habit of that and then you we should all submit to leadership hebrews 13 17 obey them to have the rule over you submit yourselves for they watch for your souls as they must give an account that they may do it with joy not with grief for that is unprofitable unto you so i don't you know i don't really give many commands to the church outside of just obey what's being preached you know i mean i like we have our fall meetings coming up right and i would i would just ask everybody to fast as many of those as you can if you can only do one praise god that's just my humble request and then while you're praying while you're fasting spend a few extra minutes and pray right and say god send your holy spirit god send revival to the young people or god send me a revival you know pray right set aside the natural things for a little while and submit yourself to the leadership and then submit to god right fast and pray and intercede for other people and then peter says we must submit to the government that's why you know we gave the government 50 days tried to follow their rules and now we know it's not a pandemic right we thought it might be uh it hit certain cities in a in a pandemic way but not ours thank god but first peter 2 13 says submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the lord's sake you probably saw that permit you see the permit out there on the cork board brother amen hung up i didn't want to pay that but i was forced to spend ten dollars i didn't want to do it ten dollars just to to so we have a permit that says we have a church in this building and i think it's ridiculous i fought it for months now shame on me i fought it for months so i'm fine like okay i'll pay ten dollars for that silly permit i didn't ask to pay that i didn't think we need to pay that but i submitted myself for the lord's sake and it wasn't maybe a good example but i didn't it wasn't a good example whether it be king as supreme or unto governors or as unto them that are sent to him for the punishment of evildoers and for the praise of them that do well for look church for so is what the will of god that with well-doing you may put the silence the ignorance of foolish men so by obeying the government we we obey god's will as long as it doesn't transgress the word of god and it's god's will right it is it's what god wants us to do now are we with the churches in california yes there's no reason they should be shut down you know they tell them they can't even sing can you imagine coming here and not even singing what would we do like lip sync or i don't know we just turn on a recording and just pretend we're singing they're not the government says you can't sing to god now i stand with them and say we must sing to god praise god that's the time to deny the government praise god because they can't tell you can't sing in jesus name we'll sing in the name of jesus we'll preach in the name of jesus we'll pray in the name of jesus we'll heal in the name of jesus amen whatever god's called us to do we'll do it in the name of jesus see so the holy spirit gives us wisdom when it goes too far right but if it's just something we should do like that permit i need to do better job submitting next time and i'm sure it'll come around next year and they'll probably raise it to twenty dollars next year and the year after probably thirty and they'll keep going up now the third s is suffering okay so we did uh service david submission god man church right other saints and now suffering now we looked at suffering this morning remember we saw that i will know him in the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings how well do you want to know jesus you want to know him a little well or very well hope you say very well the only way to know jesus very well is to know him in both the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings in other words we must suffer if we really want to know jesus but the best part is he'll be right there with you as you're suffering praise god he'll never leave you he'll never forsake you praise god and it's through suffering that you develop intimacy with christ so whenever god has called you to do his will you'll find these things suffering right submission service you'll find all these things it doesn't leave a whole lot of room for self that do we see self in here anywhere is that one of the s's no no self is not one of the s's service is actually opposite of self because it's acts for other people it's working for other people so yes church your lesson is obedience but your teacher is suffering your teacher is suffering welcome to the class of suffering and as i've said for me the suffering has been people reject me people leave the church for no good reason i'll preach the holy ghost truth to them we'll see the holy ghost fall and they'll accept some false doctrine and walk out what else can i do it's part of the suffering remember jesus ministry small small small muscle paul small small song many times it happened not all men of god but many times men of god instead of getting greater more popular they get less popular so i understand that jesus learned obedience for the things he suffered we read that this morning the bible says all that live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecution there's no escaping it it's required for your future uh position praise god ii timothy says it's a faithful saying for if we be dead with him we shall also live with him if we suffer we shall also reign with him amen amen if we deny him he will also deny us so we must suffer and not deny his word we must suffer for righteousness sake and remember this is helping me to reign over the sinful nature this is helping me to reign over the kingdom of darkness and help me to be a a laborer a ruler in the kingdom of light amen that's right church peter three times i'm sorry four times in his first epistle deals with suffering first peter 2 20 says god accepts you when you endure suffering with patience first peter 3 13-17 says happy are ye if you suffer for righteousness sake first peter 4 19 says commit to the keeping of your soul to god and constant well-doing when you're suffering according to god's will praise god chapter 5 verse 10 but the god of all grace who has called us unto his eternal glory by jesus christ after that you've suffered a while make you perfect establish strengthen and settle you praise god oh if we can just make it through a little while church praise god can you make it a little while longer just a few more weary days and then praise god just a little while longer and then you'll be established then you'll be settled praise god then you'll be perfect then you'll be strengthened amen glory you can just hang on a little while longer praise god amen thank god remember i was in 2014 i was about the place to give up pastoring and then god sent along these two wonderful saints down here so what am i saying we're going through ups and downs praise god same thing when god said naomi and beatrice here same thing what an incursion the roles that was all within about the same year two year span i was about my you know and now i just go from from uh the depths of despair up to rejoicing praise god because now we've got people to preach to you praise god amen and we see god's word changing our lives amen glory we see god pointing us to his word keeping us in the truth amen and we see god's blessings in our life praise god what a blessing paul says all suffering is just for light affliction for a moment it's all momentary he said but it works it produces a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory i don't know how to explain that somehow there's a weight of glory up in heaven there's a reward that can be measured like the paul said there's an account in heaven where your account grows as you suffer and do it willingly and keep praising god and keep waiting on the will of god your treasure in heaven it increases and it grows praise god if you can just wait a little while praise god let's go to uh second corinthians 12 please let's look at paul's buffeting angel from satan now but god allowed it second corinthians 10 i'm sorry corinthians 12 forgive me now paul gives the order for uh instances of god's spirit so how many want god's spirit to manifest through their life no doubt well the order is suffering first and then weakness suffering makes you weak right and then strength comes okay so that's the order now we have to remember that praise god may the holy spirit remind it to us praise god that's my prayer bring it to our remembrance that's the order we're gonna have to suffer first that brings us to weakness where we realize oh i can't have confidence in my flesh i can't trust in the church i was raised in i can't trust in my own ability to keep god's word i need the strength of the lord amen praise god if you're trusting in christ's righteousness you do not trust in your own strength you wait upon the lord until he renews your strength praise god amen and it always comes in weakness praise god when you get to the spot like lord what can i do how can i overcome this i've i've tried everything i prayed right like paul i prayed three times so suffering comes first that makes you weak where you don't trust in the confidence in your flesh and then the strength of the lord comes let's look at the chapter now you know he got revelations and visions in verse one he was uh caught up to the third heaven that's uh the seventh dimension first heaven is earthly uh second is universe and third is the heavenly realm now verse four he was caught up into paradise he couldn't even other the things he saw all right now let's go down to verse 7. unless i should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations there was given to me a thorn in my flesh the messenger of satan to buffet me lest i should be exalted above measure so what happened first suffered what is god trying to produce here humility how many want more humility amen and all that means is you put christ first you humble yourself you put yourself below christ in other words you're giving christ preeminence well we all want humility but it's all all of us have a hard time suffering because we're just human we don't like to suffer verse 8 for this thing i besought the lord christ said it might depart from me and he said to me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore will i rather glory in my infirmities that the power of christ may rest upon me therefore i take pleasure in infirmities and reproaches and necessities and persecutions into stresses for christ's sake for when i am weak then i am strong all right so if we want to be more humble if we want to do god's will if we want to see the power of god in our lives suffering first weakness then strength i can see in my life the times where i've seen god move the most is after i've suffered like when i've left my family for 13 or 10 days over in guyana which is where i've seen as far as the most visible outward manifestation of the holy spirit suffer right suffer heart aches being away weakness tired fasting you know i don't sleep good over there because of the mosquitoes and then god's strength i have to oh i have to sacrifice financially too those are the times where i've seen god's greatest strength but yet there's a strength that we need every day praise god amen there's a strength i need i've only been there four times that's not much so i needed strength here and where do we find it in the prince of god amen daily and living in god's presence amen paul was given a buffeting demon to keep him humble no did no wonder he wrote whatever it takes he said by any means lord if by any means let me be a partaker of the first resurrection and he meant it brother amen he wasn't playing around he said i live with a demon in my flesh can you imagine that church here's a man who cast out demons yet he's willing to live imagine that with a demon in his flesh in his eyes okay lord now i'm going to be strong because i'm just trusting in you can you imagine that church see because remember he said if anybody can glory in their flesh that's me because he was the most zealous in his flesh he was the hebrew of hebrews the pharisees of pharisees this is amazing church because he was so con he was so strong physically god had to give him a demon in his physical body to keep him humble a man who cast out demons couldn't move this one and what about that a man who could move demons raise people from the dead heal people from incurable diseases couldn't move the own demon in his flesh so don't tell me divine healing is is going to happen every time i believe it happens 99 of the time i've said that maybe higher than that maybe 99.9 but there's going to be times god takes people home there's going to be times god allows it for a certain time in season there's going to be times god allows it to humble us so the thing to do is find that mustard seed and use as much mustard seed as you got praise god amen use all the faith you got to speak against it and then just see what god does trust god amen trust in the lord with all your heart praise god lean not upon your own understanding praise god i'm gonna do it on time good everybody love the lord today amen let's all take a deep breath ready ah thank the lord it's kind of hot in here see we don't always see we don't always see god's power through raising the dead right sometimes we'll see god's power in just giving us grace to make it through our suffering one example i think of brother mike mccloskey in that wheelchair talk about grace church he's told me he's had numerous dreams where he felt the friends of god and he saw himself walk and run around and then he'll go for prayer and the brothers have tried to raise them out of it talk about faith they've tried to raise him out of this wheelchair i did that in the trinidad there's a brother there they wanted he was all deformed he has had a scar i said well let's raise him up i tried to raise him up in jesus name nothing came to no strength came to his body after about a minute so i let him down but i was i was going to try by god's i believe god can do it just probably wasn't the time and season or maybe it wasn't the will of god all i know is i was fastened that was the same service we had a prayer line and people were falling down in the line before they even got up to for me to pray for them i was just preaching on the holy ghost just a real simple message that was a glorious surface that was really that was the night after i saw the dove i still got the video i can show it to you i i went there and preached on a friday night and some of the guys were laughing at me a dog came in when i got home and i knew right there i got to preach on the holy ghost because the holy ghost is the deaf and the brothers after i left that sunday they said man they said we were laughing at you on friday but god moved and we've been preaching on the holy ghost for months they said waiting for the holy ghost to fall praise god aren't you glad church you might suffer a little while but keep serving god amen amen in your weakness he'll give you strength praise god amen amen see sometimes we we want to see god's power in a certain way it has to be a raise in the dead or it has to be healing this person or has to be a prophecy but what about suffering for god's will that's god's power too he said because my strength jesus strength is made perfect in our weakness amen remember god's waiting for you to fulfill the scripture in everything give thanks for this is the will of god in christ jesus even when it's a hot sunday yes and most of the church is traveling yes and there's not many people singing yes and there's not many people saying amen i'll still give god thanks amen because i've got life and breath and i've got i've got god in my heart and jesus has been good to me and he's faithful and his strength is made perfect in my weakness amen amen i've served god now for a long time i know there are seasons of life i know you just can't go go all like this all the time you got to go through valleys you got to go through seasons dark times rhodam caught him hot and cold times he said brother him and brother neville would stand there before jesus said look there he is there's the son of god look at him aren't you glad we stood through the hot and cold times oh thank you lord are you willing to serve church willing to suffer praise god what's the other one willing to uh submit submit to god's word let me close with this i've got about 15 minutes so i'll close in 15 minutes lord willing now i i kind of simplified it i think there's two easy steps to finding god's will for any area of your life and it's in romans 12. so i'll read it uh okay olivia if you can get that romans 12 1-2 you're very familiar with this uh i might have preached on this sparingly over the last few um months i remember i remember when uh wendy was here and she was talking to me about it afterwards presenting your body a living sacrifice so to find the perfect will of god in any situation there's two things you must do the first thing is present your body as a sacrifice and the second thing is let your mind be transformed so it's two steps praise god we all know there's a perfect will which is obeying but the permissive will is like wandering or on a path at nighttime with no light because god's word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path praise god so with god's word you know the next step you can see the next step but without so walking without god's word without the word of the lord without the perfect will of god you're just wandering you're not even sure if you're on the right path so god's word is the light his perfect will is the light for your path okay so romans 12 i beseech you brethren i'm sorry therefore brethren now that's gonna beg you by the mercies of god that you present your bodies a living sacrifice now look how god deals with you in his mercy in god's mercy he's asking you he's not demanding it he's not going to force you to do it he said by the mercies of god i'm begging you by the mercies of god in other words god god's spirit is just lovingly asking you to do this he's not going to force you to do it but in his mercy he's asking please present your bodies as a sacrifice unto god present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service leave it right there uh if you can on that scripture see god's not gonna force you but he's gonna plead with you by his mercy and church usually what does this mean if we present our bodies it means eating less food maybe i didn't maybe i had something right here here let me try to fix that we got to eat less food and then fast at times present your body right because what usually drives your body what you eat or don't eat right jesus calls it fasting right voluntary voluntary voluntarily starving your body fasting and your altar present your body a sacrifice your altar is a cross which just means a death to self so he'll lead you away from the lusts of the flesh and then also you keep your body out of harm's way so you don't put too much in or you starve it right or you put the right foods in like daniel remember daniel on the 21 day fast of just eating vegetables rick warren's church called it the daniel fast which is pretty it's pretty smart you know it's pretty smart um so you starve your body or eat less or eat healthy real healthy and then you avoid all appearance of evil so you don't walk in lasciviousness uh it's uh first pete i'm sorry first peter 4 3 you don't walk in the cheviots this lawlessness lusts excessive wine reveling banquetings and abominable idolatries now there's one couple i hate to say this but i'm going to share it anyway there's one couple that i thought was a real couple that had the holy ghost they don't go to this church it's another church but you know their trouble started when i told you about this when the brother let uh pornography into his marriage he encouraged his wife to watch it it didn't take root though until they went to a wedding reception and his wife was in the reading wedding reception and she went out on the dance floor and started dancing to that worldly music and it was like you know beyonce or britney spears or miley cyrus who knows i'm one shakira i don't even know i'm not up with their names anymore but i saw it on facebook that's how i know and then i talk to them later about it because i know about it they asked for some counseling i tried to help them but they they wouldn't accept my counseling but see they should have stayed out of the wedding reception but because all the other girls were doing it and because her husband back in the husband's fault he's the head of the home because he backs it in the home look what it opened up his wife and and the family member said that was when the mother changed now the mother's divorce and the kids live with dad and it's really awful situation awful situation but look if you presented your body living sacrifice you wouldn't go to those kind of banquets right church you wouldn't go like we've been to numerous family weddings and you know what we're always the first ones that leave at the reception because i'm going to hang around and see them get drunk and waste themselves and dance out there i'll say see you later i walk right up we'll walk right up to the couple love you god bless you see you later i'm going to hang around and partake in that trash all it is is satan's trap he's trying to get you caught in there it's his fly trap but the eagles of god fly away from there praise god amen they won't get trapped in that sticky nonsense i'm trying to tell you present our bodies we gotta physically many times keep our ourselves away from evil atmospheres bars sporting events concerts movie theaters any sinful gathering present your body as a sacrifice and stay away from it control your work hours as well because satan has put many men and slaves right to their their paycheck and their bosses but then they seek the lands right oh let me i can't go to the rapture i need to go check on my houses and my lands and my oxen awful decision now church if you're going to be a sacrifice something has to die paul said i die daily so you must daily crucify the lusts of your flesh and your own selfish will praise god how many can do that by god's grace how many are doing it amen amen how many are presenting yourselves on the altar i did it this morning i know about you but i presented my body on the altar of sacrifice this morning i could have chowed down on a real good breakfast i could have i could have chowed down on some other things and or spent my time watching other things i wanted you know news or something like that oh no i gotta present my body as a living sacrifice in the christ that's why many people don't get in the holy spirit they don't come to church ready with the anointing praise god they treat their body they stay up late saturday late friday eat all kinds of bad food you know they they don't present their body first god wants your body first so then the bible says if he can get your body he can get your mind praise god amen well that's just for preachers my brother said no it's not it's for every one of us every one of us have to separate ourselves present our bodies a living sacrifice let me close with this i got uh six minutes here thank the lord so the second part so first present your body separate your body from the wrong foods you know sleep good take care of your body stay away from bad gatherings the second thing is renew your mind that means you have to renew it every day the bible says though the outward men perish the inward man is renewed day by day amen sometimes you always got to read your bible church but some days you might just need to sing to god and that will refresh you how many times have i done it i'm tired then the day i put on no i this might sound silly to you but i wear gloves when i wash dishes i put on rubber gloves and they're purple so i look like the world's biggest fool you know even my mom or my wife's friend came over their day and said she i had my purple gloves on she's like you got purple gloves like yeah it takes a long time to wash dishes i don't want wrinkled hands and i can't i can't grab on anything because it slips out of my hands because they're all wrinkled the other ones cost more money or also i'd get like gray ones or whatever but you know the the point is the same how many times have i done that and i just put on a song i'm all tired i worked all day you know discouraged i just put on some shane and shane you know i said put on some phil wickham or i put on a sermon and pretty soon i'm you know praising the lord and praise the name of the lord our god praise his name i mean it just refreshes me praise god so that's the word in a different format right this is word just through the mind my mind but now singing is the word through your your spirit right through your spirit and your your fellowship with god worship so it's another avenue where the the bible says you can be renewed day by day through singing and also by reading the bible and this causes a spiritual transformation lydia's not there but we don't need to read it the bible said and be transformed by the renewing of your mind so remember that matt lightner was here he said you got to read the bible until you feel new remember he said that you got to sing until you feel good right see the bible says you got to transform the mind well it's not going to be transformed until you spend some time on it praise god invest some time on it he said pretty soon like matt lightner said read it until you have something to share oh i'd like to share this with brother a manner i like to share this with the saints whatever it takes for you to feel renewed if you can like i said other times i'll i'll be singing in the car and clapping that's where i'll get renewed you know the thing to do present your body and then renew your mind fill your mind with the things of god pull down right cast down anything that exalts itself the word of god forget the things in the past we saw this morning forget the things in the past leave in the past and set your affections on things above praise god the key simply is just thinking the right thoughts praise god it's that simple keep your mind holy on the word of god lydia pull up ephesians 4 22-24 i'm almost done here i haven't sweat like this for a while here i'm sure you too ephesians 4 22 that ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man see oh man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts see the old man is you do lustful things verse 23 and be renewed in the spirit of your mind verse 24 that you put on the new man so how do you put on a new man think differently which after god is created in righteousness and true holiness so the only way to feel like a new man or a new woman is to change your thoughts okay so that can be done through worship that can be done through the word but surely the word of god is a part of that whether you're singing it or reading it paul said think upon eight things and it will keep your hearts and minds whatsoever things are true honest just pure lovely good report virtuous praiseworthy think on these things meditate all day on them and pray without ceasing praise god you'll have a new mind praise god yeah your mind will be made new praise god and did you ever notice church and all these scriptures about a new man did you notice paul never mentions the soul in these scriptures that i read did did you ever see put on the new man which is in your soul no because you're already new in your soul you've already got the baptism of the holy ghost in your soul but that's not where the greatest battle ever is the greatest battle is in your mind amen he never mentions renew your soul every day because it doesn't need renewed every day because it can't sin it's a seed life has entered there it's it's it's its own uh it's its own nature it's the nature of god and it's trying to grow and express its branches right it's trying to push its branches out into your mind so we gotta let him grow praise god he never paul never mentions the soul one time renew your soul oh my he says renew your mind so see paul is showing how to bring our two outward realms into obedience the word of god and that's how we find the perfect will of god first get that temperance right self-control control this body control this sin nature that wants to do what it wants to do and then once you present your body before god let your mind be transformed by thinking the right thoughts right meditating upon the word of god prayer is so key jesus said pray daily that jesus's kingdom come and god's will to be done on earth as it is in heaven praise god amen hallelujah so every day pray let your desire let your pleasure be done on earth as it is in heaven praise god it's part of the daily prayer that's my time that's my hour let's stand jesus said this kind of prayer will be rare he said shall i find this faith on the earth when i return someone that will actually pray to do god's will let's be that kind of prayer warrior praise god let's be that kind of prayer warrior somebody that jesus can find say oh they're praying for my will to be done not the will of the republican party not the will of the democratic party praise god not the will of jeffersonville right as much as we respect people love people but the will of god almighty let god's will be done not even my will right let god's will be done on earth as it is in heaven let me read these last two scriptures uh colossians 4 12. can you pull that up there lydia this is what we need we need an epi-fresh burden i i was kind of joking with my wife you know maybe we named zion epiphus you know and she's like and i really wasn't serious about it but i really like this name it's just so strange you know it's a but epiphys had the anointing to pray for people to do god's will ever first who is one of you a servant of christ glory amen saluteth you always laboring fervent for you in prayers that ye may stand perfect and complete in what will of god can you imagine but they meant one man's whole job in life was to pray god help the church in akron to do god's will that was his whole burden and the bible didn't say he prayed for it once this was his work this was his labor this was his battle oh god let the saints let brother vang and his family do god's will let brother jesse and his wife and the family let them do that that was his labor that was his mission in life epiphanes oh my what a blessing to know someone's praying for you praise god let the church do god's will grant it dear god that's the effortfish prayer warrior anointing and then paul paul had this prayer warrior anointing too this is my last scripture church if you can't do anything else pray for someone to do god's will it's totally scripture you just saw it it's scriptural and the last one was colossians 1 9 for this cause so see i like this see epiphyse was under paul so epiphanes where'd he learn this from paul where are you going to learn it from god's prophet the bible said follow their example at the so this should be our main desire right pray that we can all do all the will of god amen for this cause we also since the day we heard it do not cease to pray for you and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding all right hey church as i wrote these months ago my mind really even was like fireworks all the time like goodness i need to pray more for god's will no wonder these are mysteries people don't pray for that they just said god they say god send me a million dollars or god you know god sent me a new house they don't even ask if it's god's will oh god send me the nearest church i can go to instead of the church that god wants you to go there's nothing wrong with having a church i'm glad naomi's goes to the church and i'm glad you guys are i'm glad to be close to church too but the point i'm making is most people denomination they just they want the easiest lifestyle they want their will instead of god's will what do you want i want god's will so let's pray for that let's have our musicians come let's pray for god's will that was epiphysis prayer that was his that was his service to god paul constantly i'm praying for the church at colosse that they will do the will of god in all wisdom and understanding remember jesus said he said depart from me workers of iniquity i never knew you because they did not the will of god how many would like prayer to walk in the perfect will of god amen let's pray together uh church just pray for somebody in here maybe just open your eyes and look around a little bit pray for somebody that i'll pray for everybody as well the church you can stop the livestream sister uh thank you sister who i appreciate that let's pray for one another this i mean we talk about book of acts right here
