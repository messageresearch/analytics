TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] there's no great ones Among Us there's only one great one and that's God we are brothers sisters greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to respond to some recent criticism I've been given on three of my videos so I'm going to do that with the Brotherly Love of Jesus Christ and this is also a great opportunity to rightly divide the word of Truth hi friends I'm Jesse Smith pastor PR of Christ Fellowship here in akan Ohio USA and I defend the original Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ that he revealed to St Paul then had to restore through Martin Luther John Wesley and the late Prophet brother William maram brandham who lived from 1909 to 1965 and also defend brother Ram's Godly Christian character here's the outline for this video first we'll look at the three videos that I was rebuked for by a famous message Pastor here in America and then we'll look at the specific accusations and my responses and then we'll look at some important quotes from God's Prophet brother brandom before starting the first segment let's talk about brotherly kindness uh Hebrews 13:1 says let Brotherly Love continue so I'm going to do my best in this video in my response to criticism about myself to show Brotherly Love of Jesus Christ I'm not going to call the name of this famous preacher some of you might be able to figure it out of course but from the sermon segment that I saw there was a brother who shared three three of my videos with this famous preacher I wish the brother who shared the videos would have contacted me first but I don't know the man's motive or objective so both the famous preacher and the man that shared my videos with the famous preacher both of you are free to reach out to me I leave my email on every single video I'm open to conversations discussions brother Ram taught us that love is corrective so if these brothers have the love of God feel free to reach out to me I'll be happy to talk about these topics by God's grace now what's interesting though is that over these last few years it's been my observation that this famous preacher who has called me out and rebuked me called me different names he's in the goat message group of preachers what I mean by that is they take turns calling themselves the greatest preachers of all time they go from each other's pulpits back and forth and compliment each other very highly they exalt and rank themselves above all the current preachers and even all the preachers of all time sadly I have a video about this from 2022 called our message Christians the greatest Christians of all time the bride Pride message goat debate I'll leave a link to that video in the description by God's grace of course I have recordings of all these preachers calling themselves the greatest of all time so I believe uh one of two things either these preachers in this goat message group are either not born again because Jesus's disciples were debating who was the greatest before they were born again in the gospels or they are born again but they've developed an awful sinful Pride complex because brother Ram said pride is a very awful sin to have and then they feed off of each other with praise and exaltation and they fail to correct one another apparently is what it seems but remember God will abase the proud but gives grace to the humble and I honestly believe it's my humble opinion I've already seen God bring humility to a few of these gr preachers through different things that have happened very publicly very sad things but that's just my opinion so here's the three videos I was rebuked for you probably saw on the thumbnail the latest was order of events of the 7-year Great Tribulation period this was released December 28 2024 so about 6 days after I released this video this famous preacher preached on all three of these videos regarding this video he said anyone that knows what God's Prophet taught knows better than that basically saying brother Braham taught the tribulation was three and a half years after the seals and that's true but it's only partly true because four times in the 1961 Daniel 70 week sermon brother Ram said there's one week left for the Jews four times he said that and brother Ram never said thus sayith the Lord there's only three and a half years left for the tribulation period for the Jews so I believe this uh famous preacher is majoring on a minor because Daniel 70 weeks is not related to Salvation for any of us especially Gentiles so basically this preacher is saying anything after the SE seals is inspired thus say the Lord of course that's wrong I could say the same thing about 1977 brother Ram taught by 1977 the US would be destroyed and just tree stumps left by 1977 of course that did not come to pass that was just a human prediction but he believed it after the opening of the seventh seals so you can't just say everything brother Bram believed after the seals was correct that's not true you still have to do the word test the prophet test and see what was spoken with thus sayith the Lord you could say the same thing about Joseph brandham brother Bram believed he was a prophet even after the seals and Joseph brandham is no Prophet there's no proof of that also the Martin Luther King Junior prediction where he'd lead Millions to a death trap brother Brandon was asked specifically was that prophecy and he said no I have nothing on it from the Lord and that did not come to pass Martin Luther King Jr did not start a race war in the South that killed millions of people he did not so it's obvious here the famous preacher didn't cite the four quotes where brother Ram says there's a week left to the Jews and Israel so let's listen to those right now it's from paragraph 95 paragraph 105 paragraph 162 and paragraph 165 I also have these quotes on the podcast I put out today about the order of events of the sevene tribulation period so I just want to make people aware of that you I'll leave a link to that in the description as well let's listen to the four quotes now if they've already had 69 weeks and lived it exactly the way God said it did and happened exactly the way God said it would do then there's one more weak promise to the Jews well God did with the Jews just exactly what he said he would do and then 69 years uh it was 483 years but 69 weeks one week left one week yet determined now when's God going to start their last week when it may be today it may be before the sun sets tonight now if these exactly what seven years each one of the weeks and we've already had 69 weeks then we have the Gentile age and we're nowh at the end of the Gentile AGS and there's one more week left for the Jew is that right and that's exactly seven years if this was seven years that's seven years because he said there's 70 weeks determined upon thy people so we know we got seven years for the Jews is that true I look at it if it's a question I want to know it see so now we can see friends the famous preacher didn't let us know that there's four quotes on the other side so is he really saying what brother random said also their math calculation won't work if they believe there's only 3 and 1/2 years left for that to be true Jesus would have had to die to around 33 or 34 ad but brother R's math calculation he gave in the Daniel 70 weeks doesn't go to 33 or 34 ad it goes to 30 ad or 31 ad so you have to look at Daniel 9:26 messiah's cut off after three score in 2 weeks or 62 weeks plus the 7 weeks that took from the announcement of the rebuilding of Jerusalem till the wall was finished brother Ram said you got to start at 445 BC when you had 69 weeks you come to 38 ad but then brother Ram said you got to subtract 7 years because prophetic years are shorter than solar years and you come to 30 or 31 ad the Messiah was cut off after the 69th week of Daniel's 70 weeks so there still has to be 7 years left so this famous preacher and many preachers it seems like are taking their quotes over the word-based math calculations that brother randam gave us they're making the quotes the absolute instead of the word of God the absolute so this is a form of idolatry and I'm still waiting no one's ever disproved this simple math calculation to me it's based again upon Daniel 9:26 messiah's cut off after 69 weeks that means there's 7 years left for Israel the second video was interracial marriage June 27 202 2 the famous preacher said brother Bram never said what I said on the video well that's only partially true what I said on the video was my own opinion about why I think brother Ram was so dogmatic about no interracial marriage I put two reasons on the video first because interracial marriage was illegal until 1967 so of course brother brand would urge the people not to do something illegal and then second trying to protect the people I believe because of all the violence the racial violence that was going on during brother Ram's lifetime so yes that wasn't on brother Ram's tapes but what was on brother Ram's tapes was that brother Ram said God chose Zapora for Moses so God chose to have an interracial marriage and that's just one of at least five examples so if Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and God chose Zapora for Moses God chose to do an interracial marriage then there will be times that God will today choose to do interracial marriages and the other four examples are Joseph and azth Hebrew Egyptian Rahab Canaanite and salmon or Salon Boaz and Ruth the moabit and yuriah the hittite and basba so the word cannot fail the word is the absolute so if the word allows interracial marriages or International marriages and Christ is the same forever then he has to allow it today as well sometimes he'll choose to do that but of course not every time so the famous preacher didn't address a lot of what was on my video probably didn't even watch my video to its full extent then the famous preacher said brother RAM used the word to teach interracial marriage and no he didn't he never taught a full sermon on this topic he didn't teach a full sermon on it like marriage and divorce seven Church ages Seven Seals anointed ones at the end times the token the mark of the beast and the Seal of God all these major topics brother never taught one specific bible-based sermon on interracial marriage the third video was that New Testament ministers are not required to marry virgins I release this December 11th 2021 and again the famous preacher never address the six reasons why I believe this teaching is scriptural anyone who studies the Bible closely we'll see that ministers had to marry virgins for the Jews only not the Gentiles the Jews only brother random used Ezekiel 4422 to talk about ministers marrying virgins but then brother random also said that was for the Jews in the Millennium he said that in the six-fold purpose of Gabriel's visit to Daniel 1961 brother Ram said anyone any reader that knows Ezekiel the 40th chapter until about the 44th is nothing in the world but the Millennium temple being erected on Earth so brother said anyone knows Ezekiel 44 is for the Jews the millennial Temple for Israel so yes Israeli priests during the Millennium will be required to marry virgins or a widow of a priest and of course when the priest had married the wife the wife was a virgin let's listen to the quote now watch description of the temple that is to be built in the Millennium now anyone any reader that knows that from Ezekiel the 40th chapter until about the 44th chapter is nothing in the world but the Millennium temple being erected on Earth anyone knows that see when the glory of the Lord fills it and so forth like that before moving on I just want to share this quote from questions and ANS 63 brother R says you might have a different interpretation on these questions he said just go right ahead that won't hurt because not only but about one or two of them pertains anything to Salvation so brother Ram says his answers won't hurt you because they don't pertain to Salvation if you see things differently than him so so interracial marriage does not pertain to Salvation a 7-year tribulation period does not pertain to Salvation and ministers Maring virgins does not pertain to Salvation so we know if someone had a different interpretation than brother brandom on these topics outside of Salvation it wouldn't hurt brother brandom but why does it hurt the current message preachers again I believe because they have a spirit of Pride perhaps their pride is hurt because they failed to study deeply on these topics maybe they feel exposed because remember they don't reply to me they don't ask me questions they don't try to correct me about the Bible verses and quotes that I use all these videos have quotes that support what I'm teaching and Believing by the grace of God so let's listen to this quote from questions and answers on the seals now for the first one now I'll try to answer them and then if if I don't get it right but you you forgive me then and if you have a different interpretation and believe it your idea of it's right if you go right ahead that won't hurt the C not over about one or two of them it pertains anything to Salvation it's only most of the questions is asked on this other side of the tri uh on the Rapture of the church so see now let's look at accusations from the video the first accusation is that the famous preacher says I'm replacing brother brandham the preacher said I'm making a superior position for myself replacing our church age messenger and friends this is simply ridiculous this proves this famous preacher knows nothing about me I've been preaching for 20 years 18 of those have been pastoring I always use brother Bram quotes for all my beliefs all my preaching cuz brother Bram was pointing us back to the Bible he hasn't watched all my 400 plus videos on YouTube over the last 10 years or the 100 plus podcasts I put out hasn't listened to those likely hasn't read my two books knows nothing about me so this is a ridiculous statement I never take credit for any Revelation and I did a few Revelation videos last year but but it was just more information about the same Revelations like water baptism serpent seed in the seals I am no Prophet I never say thus sayi the Lord and this famous preacher doesn't realize I agree with the majority of brother braham's teachings I always say I'm open to correction just like brother brandham said he was open to correction I always use brother bram's quotes and the Bible verses so this is an unfair accusation from the famous preacher who doesn't even know me doesn't even reach out to me to ask questions and try to understand or seek clarification humbly last year I put out a video on the hundred 10 differences between the message and denominational churches and in that list of 110 were these three videos so I went through that list again and it seemed like those three were the only three I might have disagreed with this famous preacher and maybe his group of friends so that's a 97% agreement rate which is very good and it's likely much higher cuz I could have went on to hundreds of other false doctrines that we in the message have right that are that we correct from denominational churches so it's a simply ridiculous statement to make that I'm replacing brother Bram the reality is brother brandham said every Doctrine must be taken back to the scripture and so it seems his famous preacher and his preacher friends have not even taken these teachings back to scripture they haven't looked at all the quotes they haven't addressed all the quotes and then the next idea is that there's major doctrines versus minor of course major doctrines are like salvation the baptism of the Holy Ghost these three videos I put out are all minors and if the famous preacher and his friends make the these Majors then they've misunderstood the message they don't understand brother bram's quotes like they claimed to brother Ram even said the Rapture was a minor because it doesn't pertain to Salvation he said that how can I overcome 1963 brother man said he appreciated this man that had a different opinion than him on the coming of the Lord he said but it's okay it doesn't pertain to Salvation let's listen to the quote but I I can't agree with him because I don't see it but the it doesn't pertain to Salvation it's pertaining to the coming of the Lord he sees that the church has to go through the tribulation period for purification I say the blood of Jesus Christ purify the church the second accusation is that I'm wasting people's time and my own time of course this is a false accusation this is ridiculous there's no better use of my time than to rightly divide the word of Truth as commanded by 2 Timothy 2:15 and also to give myself wholly unto the study of God's word according to 1 Timothy 4:1 12-16 numerous people over the years have reached out to me and thank me for all the videos but I've certainly received specific positive feedback about interracial marriage and ministers not marrying virgins so how could it be a waste of time if people are being healed strengthened edified in the word of God it's not a waste of time what is a waste of time is the famous preacher rebuking me without contacting me and not digging down into these subjects and really pointing the people back to the word of God what's sad is that the famous preacher didn't mention any of the good videos that he might have agreed with that I've done like how brother Ram's a prophet of God brother Ram had thus say the Lord's that came to pass water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ God's one person so it's likely this famous preacher has a critical spirit because Proverbs 1720 says he that hath a frowed heart findeth no good when you can't find something good about a person you've got a critical spirit now I should say this too this famous preacher is probably my favorite preacher to listen to and I'm not exalting him but I just learn so much from him he uses lots of great quotes lots of great scriptures very emotional very charismatic and no one's helped me more in this message than this famous preacher but then I find myself a couple weeks ago hearing myself rebuke for different videos that I've made but that's fine I'm going to express the Brotherly Love of Jesus Christ I'm not going to name call him I'm going to call my brother although he calls me a note head idiotic and other terms I'm not going to return that I'm going to show Grace because God has shown me so much grace but a warning for this famous preacher would be Proverbs 18:13 he that that answers a matter before he heareth it it's a Folly and shame unto him so did the famous preacher listen to all three of those videos all the way through and then pray about the quotes pray about the scriptures I don't know that's between the famous preacher and God but it is a shame and Folly if someone doesn't do that and that's according to the thus sayith the lord of the word of God the third accusation he said is I'm a know- it all the famous preacher said he knows so much about everything there is to know he said how can you know more than your church age messenger that's ridiculous these are three minor topics these are not major topics they don't relate to Salvation so if I don't see everything the same as brother Brandon on minor things that's not an issue at all I don't know more than brother brandom I just have a different opinion as I've said on my videos in regarding opinions brother BR said his opinion was no better than anybody else's he said that in marriage and divorce 1965 he said my opinion is just like anybody else's this famous preacher claims to believe everything brother says but apparently he doesn't because the famous preacher says I'll take brother Ram's opinion over my own even and that sounds really Noble but it's not because an opinion is just a human thought it's not thus sayith the Lord if brother Ram didn't give us thus sayith the Lord on a certain topic then we're entitled to our own opinion but it's got to be based on the word of God and all these videos I made are based upon the word of God scores and scores of scriptures on these videos so let's listen the brother Ram's quote from marriage and divorce 1965 now remember these things that I say must come from the word of God it can't be my own opinion because my opinion just like anybody else's but it's got to be in continuity with the word of God remember God keeps everything in continuity he never changes he's the same yesterday today and forever so friends after the famous preacher called me a know-it-all he also called what I was doing hogwash and then he said this name call and bashing of me and preachers that believe what I believe was his present to their church cuz he didn't give them a Christmas present and then they all clap and rejoice over this name calling and bashing without any support for his beliefs other than his quotes from brother Brandon that he uses but of course he leaves out all the other quotes from brother brandom so again friends his main weapon is name calling in this situation but hopefully he'll preach a sermon maybe later on these subjects soon I don't know I hope so I'll be listening because I always listen to this famous preacher he's one of my favorite preachers to listen to and of course he's welcome to reach out to me personally about these things let's go to the next section important quotes from God's Prophet brother brandham brother Bram said no man has all the answers no man is 100% correct but yet this famous preacher and all his buddies that's what they basically say they're basically saying brother brandom has everything right don't ever say or believe anything different than every single word on the tape is basically what they're saying I don't have everything 100% brother Bram said he doesn't have all the answers this famous preacher doesn't have all the answers answers so why is this famous preacher so aggressive and hostile I don't know it could be again a pride complex cuz he has no Bible proof he's only using name calling but let's listen to Three quotes brother Ram said he doesn't have all the answers his answers are not infallible he says but he knows the scriptures are infallible he says if I make mistakes you pray for me I'm not infallible I'm your brother let's listen to the quotes according to the opening of The Fifth Fifth seal Moses and Elijah have have to die what about Enoch I don't know I I if I don't know I'm just going to tell you I don't know see I I don't I don't know all the answers folks I I don't know and if I don't know I'm going to tell you I don't know if I do know I won't tell you till I do know see but I I don't know I've often wondered about that myself and these answers are not infallible see because the scriptures is infallible and as far as I know they're line with the scriptures I hope that makes it plain and the tape is to be uh kept now and anyone would want it well could have it but now I know the scriptures are infallible but my answers are not infallible so I'm sure everyone understands that and if it's not um if it's not infallible then you have a right maybe to ask me at any time if I make mistakes you pray for me I'm not infallible I'm your brother see God just revealed to his Prophet that what he wants them to know nothing else prophets are not infallible people prophets are not easy they are man the next point is brother Ram said never put a period after your beliefs which means we must grow in Revelation we must continue to seek God and grow in the revelation of the Lord Brother R said this in Queen of Sheba 1960 birth pains 1965 and then the church age book he says God will give more information on the same Revelation so that's what I believe God has shown me and other preachers regarding the tribulation Daniel 70 weeks marriage and divorce interracial marriage God's just given us more information scriptural information on the same Revelation and on some of these topics if brother Ram didn't have a thus sayth the Lord then it wasn't the re ration from God on that particular topic so in other words it wasn't God's time to reveal that Revelation so we're just doing the best we can to rightly divide the word of Truth and just live such a good Christian life so close to Jesus Christ doing the best we can by the grace of God let's listen to the quotes you got room for God Amen don't never end your Doctrine with a with a period end it with a comma we believe this plus as much as the Lord will show us God can't give a first revelation then a second Revelation if he did he would be changing his mind he can give a revelation and then add to it as he did in the Garden of Eden when he promised the seed to the woman and then later designated that seed had to come through Abraham and then later said it would come by the same Bloodlines in David but it was the same Revelation it only gave the people more information to help them receive and understand it but God's word can't change also there's quotes brother Ram said men would come after him and make more sense of the message and of course that would mean just more information of the same Revelation so let's listen to that quote from birth pains these men if they pick up this and go out with it they can make more sense to it see to bring it to a place you would I just want to lay this seat hope they make it come to life notice another point is brother Ram never said thus sayith the Lord on these topics I think I might have mentioned that before but he never said thus sayith the Lord 3 and 1/2 years is left for the tribulation he never said thus sayith the Lord a new testament Minister have to has to marry a virgin and he never said thus sayith the Lord interracial marriage is always wrong he never said that I'll do a couple more quotes here brother Ram said every Doctrine and everything else in the Bible must be based upon the word of God I have videos of this famous preacher saying you don't need a scripture for everything we believe from God's Prophet Yet brother brah says the opposite he says everything every Doctrine everything else we must have a scripture for it so this is from 1957 of course so why isn't this famous message preacher willing to take every Doctrine back to the word of God if he did perhaps he'd change his stance on these three topics no interracial marriage is not found one place in the Bible the absolute marrying virgins is only found in two places Deuteronomy 21 I think and then Ezekiel 44 but it's both to the Jews it's not to New Testament Gentile Holy Ghost filled Believers let's listen to the quote from 57 every Doctrine and everything else of the Bible that we have in the church must be based up on the word of God must come from the word not just one place but from Genesis to Revelations it must say the same thing because we cannot base our thoughts upon one little scripture for the Bible said in the mouth of two or three Witnesses let every word be established the last quote I'll use is a pretty well-known quote from here ye hymn 1960 brother Ram says if Satan can't keep you from seeing the real thing of God he'll push you off the deep end with it and make you go to a fanatic so I believe this famous message preacher and his group of goat preachers are so close to being a fanatical worshipper of every word on brother Ram's tapes this famous preacher and his friends they have this similarity with brandham Tabernacle they're both saying they're the greatest Christians of all time time or the greatest preachers of all time that's got to be Pride brother Ram said don't never do that don't never call each other great so why aren't they doing what the prophet said why are they ignoring this quote from God's Prophet sometimes great guys get together you hear them say great so and so and great someone's oh are great don't never do that there's no great ones Among Us there's only one great one and that's God we are brothers sisters I don't care if you're a pastor or church got five people that don't make you little that makes you a brother see if you're true to God's word don't care what how you don't get little God don't have little children and big children he just has children and they're all the same they nearly exalt every word on tape to being scripture that's a sin that's a lie so let's listen to this quote from hear ye himym 1960 and realize if the devil can't keep you from seeing a truth he'll push you to some extreme some deep end and the deep end here is that every single opinion of brother brandham is thus sayith the Lord or you don't need a scripture for every single thing brother brandham said yes you do brother R said every Doctrine everything else from the Bible must come from the Bible let's listen to the quote from hear ye him 196 see if the devil can't keep you from seeing a real real thing of God he'll push you off the deep end with it like that he'll make you go to a fanatic you don't have to be fanatical there's too much real and real genuine to have to be a fanatic my the whole Pentecostal skies are full of it in closing friends hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God I just want to give a quick video response to some of these criticisms and it's okay I'm open to being criticized I wouldn't be on YouTube if I didn't want to be criticized I hope this video was done with brotherly kindness of course I've got to take a stand on certain things and I got to call certain behaviors like I see them if I think it's Pride I'm going to go ahead and call it I've had that video out there for almost 3 years now and I have all the Bible evidence from for that so that's just my humble opinion as well I'm open to being corrected if someone will correct me but I want to remind everybody of this quote from 1964 the unveiling of God a man is trying to tempt brother brandom to writing his own Bible regarding his revelation of the seals and the Seven Thunders and he says you're eligible to write a Bible yourself he say you have all the qualifications so what does brother Ram say he says but look you can't add one word or take one word away he's quoting revelation 22 18- 19 so I love this quote because brother Rand cannot add to the Bible he can't take away from the Bible and when these famous preachers start making almost every opinion or every word of brother brandham scripture on level with scripture they're actually getting close to idolatry so this is a beautiful quote brother brand said God's spirit will never leave that word so the spirit of God will always direct us to the word of God on every Doctrine every teaching every biblical idea let's listen to the quote now someone has been many has been saying theologians said brother brand if the Lord God said if if with your experience that the Lord has given you for his people humbly saying this said You' be eligible to write a Bible yourself your word if God has manifested I said that might be true see he's trying to catch me I said but you see I couldn't do that he said why couldn't you have all the qualifications I said but you look one word cannot be added or taken away and he said well then them seven Thunders you see said what them seven Thunders blasting out won't that be a revelation be given to some man I said no sir it would be adding something to it or taking something from it's all revealed in there and the Seven Seals opened up the revelation of what that was am Ste in the word you see you can't get out of that word it won't leave the word and God's spirit will never leave that word it'll stay right with the word blinding some and Open the Eyes of others it'll always do that so friends let's close with a word of prayer I ask God to minister to these famous Preachers by the grace of God I know I'm nothing I'm the least of God's servants and that's totally fine with me but I want to have a loving heart a heart of love so let's pray for them dear Lord thank you for today Lord I pray this video could be a help to the person who shared my videos with this famous preacher perhaps they'll open up their hearts and uh really seek you and seek the truth of your word and really pray about these quotes pray about these scriptures Lord Jesus to help them to more better rightly divide the word of Truth Lord may they feel my brotherly love if they watch it I don't know if they will but if they do I pray you'll use it God for your glory Lord Jesus this is a wonderful exercise and rightly dividing the word of Truth iron sharpening iron and growing in Grace and knowledge of Our Lord also as Peter said being ready to give an answer for the hope that we have within us by the grace of God so Lord Jesus let your spirit bring unity and love and truth may we all go deeper in the love of God together I ask this in Jesus Christ's name amen if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
