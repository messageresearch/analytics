Description:
The Book of Revelation plainly shows the difference between the two "seventh angels" of Revelation 10:7 and 11:15. Revelation 10:7 is an earthly messenger, a human, who ministers during the Times of the Gentiles, before the Great Tribulation. The Revelation 11:15 seventh angel is a literal angel who ministers in heaven during the Great Tribulation.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] greetings friends in the matchless name of the lord jesus christ recently i was asked a great question and i'd like to share both the question and answer with you what is the difference between the two seventh angels in the book of revelation the answer is one of the seventh angels has an earthly ministry and the other has a heavenly ministry the question of course refers to the seventh angel of revelation chapter 10 verse 7 and the other seventh angel of revelation 11 15 which is the same angel also in revelation 16 verse 17. here's the three scriptures in question the first angel is revelation 10 7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets the second seventh angel is in both revelation 11 15 and 16 verse 17 and the seventh angel sounded and there were great voices in heaven saying the kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our lord and of his christ and he shall reign forever and ever revelation 16 verse 17 and the seventh angel poured out of his vile into the air and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven from the throne saying it is done some might believe these two seventh angels are the same person an earthly preacher brother branham who first ministered on earth in revelation 10 verse 7 and then ministers for god in heaven in revelation 11 and chapter 16. while i agree revelation 10 7 was brother branham i can't see any biblical pattern of god using a saved soul in heaven to pour out his judgments upon earth but rather we see god using literal holy angels not save men's souls to fulfill his judgments such as in the days of david from the old testament and also herod in the new testament second samuel 24 verse 17 says and david spake unto the lord when he saw the angel that smote the people acts 12 verses 21 and 23 say and upon a set day herod arrayed in royal apparel sat upon his throne and made an oration unto them verse 23 and immediately the angel of the lord smote him because he gave not god the glory there is one quote from brother branham i found that agrees with my understanding of this subject in this quote brother branham says the seventh angel messenger is different from the seventh trumpet angel of course there could be more quotes on this subject that i haven't seen so please let me know if you found some i haven't seen but let's listen to the quote says the seventh angel's message that's right at the seven trumpets and there's seven angels going seven trumpets that's what we're coming to next but remember rare very specifically it said the angels not the seventh angels trumpet but the seventh angel's message empty not the trumpet angel the message angel they were the angel only son of the trumpet that seventh angel the trumpet angel but then said in the days of the message of the seventh angel name when his message is finished see that's the church age message and this time then he will the reason the two seventh angels are different there are two sets of seven angels in the book of revelation one group is earthly and the other is heavenly the scriptural context of both seventh angels prove one seventh angel is sounding on earth during the times of the gentiles that jesus defined in luke 21 24 to finish the great commission while the second seventh angel is sounding in heaven during the great tribulation or the seventieth and final week of daniel's 70 weeks also known as jacob's trouble the first set of the earthly seven angels revelation chapters two and three mentions seven angels from seven gentile cities that jesus christ tells john to write to and share his divine messages with these seven angels are human messengers as i also taught in my 2021 book the 12 new testament mysteries revealed on pages 409 and 410 here's a summary of the five reasons the seven angels in revelation chapters two and three are human preachers the first proof is found in revelation two verse one unto the angel of the church of ephesus wright why would jesus tell john to author a handwritten letter to a heavenly angel at ephesus god doesn't have to write letters to heavenly angels god just speaks directly to heavenly angels and sends them from his throne to minister to believers who shall be heirs of salvation the truth is jesus was assigning john to write to an earthly man at ephesus who would preserve the letter for upcoming generations to whom it would also apply to second the seven angels are symbolic of human preachers because men are sometimes referred to as angels in scripture the hebrew definition of angel is messenger and jesus appropriately calls john the baptist god's messenger in matthew 11 verse 12. the prophet david is twice called an angel of god in first samuel 29 verse 9 and 2nd samuel 19 27 paul says the galatians received him as an angel of god even as christ jesus in galatians 4 verse 14. a final witness is revelation 22 verses 8 and 9 as the angel sent to john to show him the prophecies was actually a fellow servant of his a prophet who kept the sayings of revelation a third fact is that god uses men to save men angels assist men but men are god's primary tool for sharing his way to salvation romans 10 verse 14 says how shall they hear without a preacher mark 16 verse 20 explains jesus's disciples preached everywhere the lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following so we see jesus used men to save men fourth notice the location of these stars or seven angels because revelation chapter 1 says these seven angels were in the hand of jesus christ both moses and jesus defined god's right hand as his power and authority and this power and authority is strictly reserved for christ and not angels according to hebrews 1 verse 13. but jesus promised men would inherit god's power and authority to witness his resurrection in numerous scriptures lastly abraham's seed or faith-filled humans are referred to as stars in genesis 15 verse 5. daniel 12 3 likens the saved and soul winners to stars saying and they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament. and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars forever and ever john the baptist god's messenger is likened unto a star a burning light in john 5 35. he was a burning and a shining light and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light by god's grace the holy ghost has revealed the human identities of these seven earthly angels who are the messengers to the seven church ages paul irenaeus martin columba martin luther john wesley and william branham this would mean that the seventh angel of revelation 10 verse 7 is the same seventh angel to the church of laodicea in revelation 3 verse 14 who again was the late reverend william branham the context of revelation chapter 10. next the context of revelation 10 verse 7 and verse 11 specifically shows the gentiles are still in need of prophecy and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings notice how many peoples nations tongues and kings not few need to hear the revelations of the little book or the revelations of the seven seals as seen from revelation chapters 4 5 6 and 8. this means jesus's great commission to all nations or all gentile peoples is not yet fulfilled as matthew 28 verse 19 and 20 declare go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost teaching them to observe all things whatsoever i commanded you and lo i am with you alway even unto the end of the earth amen so the context of revelation chapter 10 shows god is still dealing with gentiles notice also that prophecy always prospers believers we see this in ezra 6 14 and the elders of the jews builded and they prospered through the prophesying of haggai the prophet and zachariah the son of ido according to romans chapter 11 the jews are currently the branch broken off from god who likens himself to a holy tree please read the whole chapter of romans 11 for the full context but paul warns that god is going to graft israel back into god's promises just as a man would graft a branch back into a tree but this happens after god cuts off the gentiles or wild branch according to romans 11 verse 17 and verse 24 when jesus christ raptures the holy ghost filled gentiles before the great tribulation the rest of the gentiles who rejected the holy ghost baptism are cut off so there is no more ministry no more grace and no more prophecy to the gentiles this is what revelation 22 verse 11 declares he that is unjust let him be unjust still and he which is filthy let him be filthy still and he that is righteous let him be righteous still and he that is holy let him be holy still the time for all nations to receive the prophecy of the new testament in the great commission is what jesus called the time of the gentiles in luke 21 24 and they shall fall by the edge of the sword and shall be led away captive into all nations and jerusalem shall be trodden down to the gentiles until the times of the gentiles be fulfilled the second set of the heavenly seven angels revelation chapters 8 9 11 15 16 and even two scriptures in revelation 17 and chapter 21 mention the second set of heavenly angels it's my humble opinion the seven angels with the seven trumpets are the same heavenly angels who pour out the seven vows but i could be wrong on that and i'm open to correction the first mention of the heavenly seventh angel is revelation 11 15 and the context shows the jewish temple already built which means the times of the gentiles is over as the gentiles were cut off and the jewish branch was grafted back into the holy tree as previously explained in romans 11. the first woe is poured out in revelation 11 so this cannot be the times of the gentiles the gentile bride is spared from the wrath of god according to first thessalonians 1 verse 10 and 1st thessalonians 5 verse 9 and revelation 3 verse 11 and to wait for a son from heaven whom he raised from the dead even jesus which delivered us from the wrath to come for god hath not appointed us to wrath but to obtain salvation by our lord jesus christ because thou hast kept the word of my patience i also will keep thee from the hour of temptation which will come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the earth revelation 11 verse 15 shows the context of the sounding of the seventh angel is in heaven revelation 11 verse 18 shows it's the time of wrath not of grace mercy and prophecy to the gentiles moving to revelation chapter 16 verse 17 the context is the pouring out of the seven vials in god's wrath this means the 144 000 jews are already sealed in their foreheads by the baptism of the holy ghost as seen in revelation 7 verses 1 through 8 notice verse 3 in chapter 7 which says saying hurt not the earth neither the sea nor the trees to we have sealed the servants of our god in their foreheads did you notice the trees cannot be hurt until the 144 000 are sealed with the holy ghost baptism then read revelation 8 verse 7 and see how a third of the trees are burnt during the first trumpet so this proves the 144 thousand jews are sealed by christ's spirit before the wrath of the trumpets begins to sound revelation 8 verse 7 says the first angels sounded and their foul hail and fire mingle with blood and they were cast upon the earth and the third part of the trees was burned up and all green grass was burned up friends the great tribulation judgments start under the seven trumpets in revelation chapter eight this proves god is already done with the gentiles when these trumpets are blown as there's no more mercy for the gentiles and that he already filled the 144 000 jews with the holy ghost and now it's time for divine judgment and wrath upon the earth in closing i hope this video was a blessing and i hope by the grace of god you're now able to see the difference between the two seventh angels the one is earthly brother branham and the other is heavenly a literal angel if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me god bless you and may jesus christ be the desire of your heart
