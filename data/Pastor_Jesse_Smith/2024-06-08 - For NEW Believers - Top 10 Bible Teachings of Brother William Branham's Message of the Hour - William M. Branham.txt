TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] many of you strangers perhaps hear these men get up and make make these remarks about a message of this hour and so forth what they are getting at is God's promise of this hour that he promised what he would do and we seem scripturally vindicating just exactly what he said he would do in the same manner foretold it's just exactly perfectly each time because it's God saying it greetings friends in the mattress name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to give my top 10 Bible revelations that should be taught to new message Believers recently I was asked which teachings from the Bible I would recommend to a new message believer so I thought I'd make this video by the grace of God hi friends I'm Jesse Smith pastor bride of Christ Fellowship here in akan Ohio USA and I defend the Gospel of Jesus Christ that he revealed to St Paul and then had to restore through his late Prophet William Marian brandham 190 9 to 1965 and I also defend brother Ram's Godly Christian character so it was difficult coming up with this top 10 list I used two top 10 lists to kind of help me make my top 10 list the first top 10 list I used was from Brother Jason dears he's another message Minister he's preached at our church before he has a podcast and YouTube channel that defends the message I really appreciate his ministry one of his recent podcasts he listed his top 11 teachings to introduce them message and then in the email request I received to make this video this new message believer mentioned the Wikipedia list about bromism and of course I don't believe in bromism I'm just a holy ghost filed Christian but that Wikipedia site has about nine doctrines so I'll leave links in the descriptions to both of those lists Jason dear's podcast and then the Wikipedia bromism list but let's begin my list my first teaching from the Bible is water bap AP ISM in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the reason I put this first is because brother brand often said salvation is Major brother BR would say certain doctrines don't pertain to Salvation of course water baptism is the moment you're saved or right around the moment you're saved many scriptures teach this such as Mark chapter 16 he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved Acts 2 36-38 Men and Brethren what shall we do Peter said repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ we also see in Acts chapter 8 with Philip and the unic the unic asked what hinders me to be baptized and Philip said if you believe with all your heart you can be baptized so he was immediately baptized upon the Revelation that Jesus Christ is the Son of God the propit for sins and of course we must use the literal name of the Lord Jesus Christ I had a video about that recently about the power and the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Colossians 3:17 says do all things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so we must baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ cast out devils in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ do miracles in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ everything is done in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and of course here's that chart for five water baptisms in the book of Acts and they all use either Lord Jesus Jesus Christ or Lord and so we can see the Revelation for the one name of the father son Holy Ghost is the Lord Jesus Christ remember it's Satan's job to blaspheme the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we see that in Revelation 13:6 the three-fold blasphemy he blasphemes the name of God the Tabernacle of God and the saints of God so that's what the Roman Catholic Church did they changed water baptism from the literal name to the titles father son Holy Ghost they call Rome the Eternal City that's blasphemy the Eternal City is the New Jerusalem and of course they blasphemed the Saints by teaching billions of people to pray to the dead Saints there's only one mediator between God and man the man Christ Jesus I recently heard about random say in the breach 1963 that when John was weeping and no man was worthy to come and look at the book and take the book brother raham said John did not see a thousand Catholic saints mediators John saw the lamb the me the one mediator between God and man the man Christ Jesus he didn't see St Cecilia St Joseph and all these other Saints to mediate and pray for people he saw Jesus Christ what's he been he's been an intercessor no other person tell me where Mary can make intercessions then amen what could Mar offer what could St Francis St aisia or any St Cecilia brother or any other Human Being John never saw a thousand saints come out from the mediatorial he saw a lamb Hallelujah a lamb that have been slain bloody I don't care how many Saints have been slain there were all do it every one of them like the thief said at the cross we've sinned and we were doing this but this man's done nothing he was the only man that was worthy remember friends I have 14 references from encyclopedias britanicas almanacs all saying the same thing that water baptism was initially performed in the literal name of the Lord Lord Jesus Christ but then around 100 AD water baptism began being changed by the deceived people into the titles father son Holy Ghost and when a new believer gets started off on justification they want to start the right way using the name of the Lord Jesus Christ of course I'll leave video links in the description to teachings about water baptism second I recommend the godhead teaching how there's one person in the godhead not three in my 2021 book I show eight prop problems with the Trinity Dogma it's a man-made Dogma the Trinity Dogma was formed around 300 years after the apostles had died so it was not formed by the apostles it wasn't established by St Paul it's a non-biblical false Dogma remember the warnings in Proverbs 530 and 6 and Revelation 22:18 and 19 we cannot add to the Bible the Trinity Dogma adds the words three persons to the Bible real Bible Believers will not add anything to the word of God of course I'm entire chapter on this in my 2021 book it's chapter 1 because God gets preeminence God is first in our hearts and this Trinity Dogma is also seen in Matthew 13:33 Jesus told a parable about how a woman would add Le to three measures a meal and that's what the Roman Catholic Church did it added the sin of a false Doctrine into God's tri-unity his three manifestations of father son Holy Ghost and look what that leaven has done to the entire Catholic dogma or Catholic Doctrine a little leav leavens the whole lump now the entire lump of Catholic teaching is completely sinful it's completely corrupted and of course I'll leave links in the video description to this third I would introduce brother Ram's prophetic Ministry I have an entire chapter dedicated this in my 2021 book is chapter 13 there are six portions of scripture that brother Brandon fulfilled acts 3:20 and 21 Matthew 171 and 12 Malachi 45 and 6 Revelation 101 1-7 Amos 37 and Luke 17:30 the reason I put this third is because if you're going to a message church if you're a new message believer you're going to hear people say especially the preacher say brother random said just like if you lived in the 16th century you'd hear a lot of people say Martin Luther said cuz he was the messenger for that hour brother Ram's Ministry was so powerful so instrumental to millions of Believers including me my life has been literally transformed by the Holy Ghost through brother Ram's Ministry his Revelations from the Bible which are from Jesus Christ are what I base my entire 18 years of pastoring ministry upon plus I preached two years before that as a teacher and evangelist in my first home church so I've been preaching 20 years and I based my entire Ministry on this bible-based ministry of William brandham I'll leave video links in the description I have five videos on brother brandham as the messenger to this age six thus sayith Lords that have been fulfilled proving brother random was a prophet future Prophecies of brother brandham that are yet to be fulfilled the brown bear Vision explains how God deals with prophets and Visions that's a very important video and again the audio book to my 13th chapter in my 2021 book on the 12 New Testament Mysteries revealed fourth the baptism of the Holy Ghost I have entire chapter dedicated to this mystery it's called a mystery in Colossians 1:26-27 Christ in you the hope of glory now the chapter is chapter 6 in my 2021 book this is such an important chapter it's hard to overemphasize the importance of this teaching from the Bible here you see the three parts of man body Soul and Spirit from 1 Thessalonians 5:23 you also see how Jesus said the Holy Ghost can only be given in the soul after he was resurrected according to John 7:37 through 39 and also Matthew 11 28-30 Jesus would give rest for the soul in the Old Testament they had rest for the mind and the body but not for the soul that's because the blood of bulls and goats could could not take away sin but now because of the blood of Jesus Christ it can take away sins and now the Holy Ghost can abide and seal our souls until the day of redemption this chapter also includes the evidence for the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's being guided into all truth of course that means having the fruits of the spirit it means receiving the word for your day and of course if you're guided into all truth you'll receive all the Revelation in the Bible for your day so the evidence of the Holy Ghost is a very important topic I have a video on that as well I'll leave that in the description and also here we see that there's one ceiling for the soul there's one filling for the soul there's not many ceilings for the soul there's not many feelings for the soul some people are confused about that that's according to Ephesians 4:30 and Romans 8:23 we're sealed unto the day of our Redemption which is the day we get a brand new body either theophany or glorified depending on if we live to the Rapture or not and the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the soul is so important it's the token or ticket to the pre-tribulation Rapture I didn't put the Rapture in this top 10 teaching because what's most important is that you receive the token for the Rapture the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then it doesn't matter if you understand everything about the Rapture or not as long as you've got the spirit of Christ in you you'll go in the Rapture so we must focus on getting the oil or the baptism of the Holy Ghost so we're prepared for the Rapture and of course I'll leave video links in the description for this topic as well the fifth topic is the three works of Grace this is also known as the stature of perfect man I have an entire chapter devoted this in my 2021 book it's chapter 5 the Bible calls it the mystery of godliness brother Rand said it's godliness restored to man how has godliness restored to the man it's through God adding to you Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness and then charity to cap off the stature of the person the stature of the Holy Ghost filled Christian there's a very helpful chart in my 20121 book it's figure 14 and it shows all these Bible proofs of three works of Grace not four works of Grace Three works of Grace so I'll put that on the screen here you can pause that and look at that I'm trying to conserve time the three works of Grace is so important it guards you against false conversions many accusers of brother brandom and also just regular denominational people they make the great mistake of saying there's only one work of Grace and they deny all these Bible truths Bible revelations like the chart they deny scores of Bible verses that's what chapter 5 is devoted to in my book giving all the Bible verses that teach the three works of Grace and it's a shame it's so sad these people accusers of brother brandom and you know denominational people will say there's only one work of Grace so for example when a six-year-old will repent of their sins and be baptized and get saved they'll tell that six-year-old you're already filled with the Holy Ghost and of course that six-year-old is not filled with the Holy Ghost they're simply Justified they've started their walk with God but they got to learn to be Sanctified and then they got to have an experience where they're filled with the Holy Ghost this chapter is also important because it shows people can fail Grace or for fit salvation and their names are blotted out of the book of life there are numerous Bible verses about this I just preached on this to The Junction City Saints I'll try to get that sermon up soon but God said he would blot out names of people that do not overcome he'll blot out names of people that blaspheme he'll blot out the names of people that sin against him and don't repent so of course I'll leave video links in the description of this subject number six is Modesty and Holiness this is a sanctification teaching in other words after you get saved God will move you into this area so you can be Sanctified which means purified and set apart from profane things and of course a person knew the message will see right away when they walk into a sanctuary how different the sisters look so modesty and Holiness is the most visible public difference between Christians especially wise and foolish virgins I wrote a book on this in 2019 restoring Christian modesty I wanted to fully prove by the Bible and history that is God's perfect will for us to obey these Bible commands about modesty Holiness and the outward appearance one chapter in particular is so powerful it shows the historical events that led to Western Society rejecting these Bible Holiness standards decade by decade remember friends it's dishonorable for a woman to cut her hair a Christian woman and dishonorable means repulsive in the Greek which means disgusting so it's a disgusting thing for a woman to dishonor a husband by cutting her hair that's thus sayith the scripture that's 1 Corinthians 11:5 and my challenge to accusers brother random and of course any person is show me one scripture where God asked a Godly woman to cut her hair there is no Bible verse God never asked a Godly woman to cut her hair so of course I'll leave video links uh in the description to these subjects and also include makeup and the Bible that's my most popular YouTube video over these last 10 years makeup is a worldly thing it's a sin only evil women wore makeup in the Bible there's four or five verses on that as well seventh is the teaching on the serpent seed this is part of the mystery of iniquity from 2 Thessalonians 2:7 it's in chapter 10 in my 2021 book there's nine evidences that support the serpent Seed doctrine and I've never seen anyone disprove even one of them because they're all based upon the Bible and friends this is not a racist Doctrine at all at the beginning of time the serpent seed was a natural seed but then by the time Noah and his sons got into the ark and then God repopulated the Earth the natural seed of mankind had all been corrupted through the serpent seed so now God has to do a spiritual seed which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's the word of God it's Christ in you the hope of glory according to 1 Peter 1:23 and of course Colossians 1 26 and 27 God must give us a spiritual seed to be in his family the natural seed line natural DNA doesn't matter anymore and I love serpent SE because it's taught literally from Genesis to Rev ation and recently God gave us a great Revelation on that we see serpent seed in the Seven Seals we see it in Revelation 5 the only one worthy to take the book of redemption and reveal it was the one who'd been born by virgin birth that's because sin came into the world through adultery and adulterous act so Redemption had to come in the world through a virgin birth God had to bypass the way that sin came into the world it's a beautiful Revelation brother B preached it in the breach 1963 so this teaching explains why Jesus had to be born of a virgin birth and of course I'll leave video links to this in the description number eight is the four classes of Believers I taught on this in chapter 8 my 2021 book it's part of the mystery of the kingdom of God from Matthew 13: 3-9 and 18 through 23 this is another teaching that's Genesis the Revelation it's a beautiful Revelation I have a simple figure on this on page 504 of my book it's figure number 21 this is so important because it explains how every person in human history falls into one of these four classes you have wise virgin foolish virgin make believer unbeliever and brother Ram caught the revelation of this throughout his entire Ministry but really taught the clear teaching on it in the church age book released December 1965 and of course for us the most important aspect of this is making sure we're wise virgin and not foolish virgin Peter tells us to make our calling and election sure and as Jesus parable says in the wise and foolish virgins Matthew 25 1-13 we must prepare the oil we must prepare our hearts to have the baptism of the Holy Ghost the Bible says we do that by obeying him Matthew 5:42 I believe or 43 says God gives the Holy Ghost to them that obey him we must hunger and thirst after righteousness and we shall be filled according to Matthew Chapter 5 so Abraham and lot are a type of the wise and foolish Virgin of course David and Saul Jesus and the saved thief on the cross and then Paul says gold and silver are like the wise and foolish virgins and then St John in revelation 22 says holy and righteous the holy are the Holy Ghost filled Saints the righteous are the foolish virgins so of course I'll leave video links to these topics in the description number nine is the five full ministry in the local church we see this in Ephesians 4: 8-16 Paul ordained the fful ministry decades after Jesus had already ascended and then he never changed it he said the fivefold ministry would continue until we all come in the unity of faith of course the bride of Christ is not unified in everything in the faith but she will be by the grace of God before the Rapture of course this teaching shows the fallacy of the tape Church movement it exposes the heresy of saying press play and Obey only listen to brother brandom shame on those people I have many videos about that trying to correct them hopefully some people can be corrected by God's grace we also see the five benefits of the five full ministry in Ephesians 4: 8-16 so people that reject the five full ministry miss out on those five benefits of course and then people that don't go to church or people that reject the five full ministry they're in danger of fulfilling 1 John 2:19 they went out from us because they are not of us this may prove someone is a foolish virgin or a serpent seed in the spiritual realm of course remember this was established the fivefold ministry was established in Acts 2 42-47 The True Believers love the doctrine of the Apostles they love fellowshipping with the apostles breaking bread praying from house to house taking communion you only do this with the five full ministry as brother Ram said every Christ should have a home Church a pastor pay tithes and offerings to the local church to support the ministry and that's a new testament teaching in First Corinthians chapter 9 I'll leave uh video links to that in the description as well and this is part of chapter 11 of my 2021 book on the mystery of God's will God's will is for you to have his perfect will for your relationships your vocations your jobs location so you live in the right place and of course that includes your local church your Ministries which Ministries you participate in in your local church and your gifts the gifts that you exercise in your local church such an important subject and finally uh 10th is the mother Harlot and the mother Harlot is taught in chapter 9 of my 2021 book of course it's the Roman Catholic church but she has daughters according to Revelation 2:23 and of course the daughters are the Protestant churches that hold many of the Catholic Church's false doctrines like the Trinity Dogma brother Ram teaches plainly and of course the Bible does as as well that we're warriors we're soldiers in the army of the Lord Brother Ram Likens boxers to having to study their opponents and so in the Bible we're likened unto soldiers and soldiers have to fight they have to know their enemy and so that's why I would include the teaching on the mother harlot in the top 10 subjects I would teach new Believers 1 Peter 5'8 says we must be sober and Vigilant because the enem is like a roaring line seeking whom he may devour so if our enemy is around us we need to be aware of the enemy and the Bible says we must must not be ignorant of the enemy's devices or ways that he tries to trap us or trick us destroy us steal or kill from us According to second Corinthians 2:11 of course John chapter 8 the enemy comes to steal kill and destroy so we've got to study our enemy in order to overcome our enemy and we've got the greatest weapon there ever was the word of God it is written Jesus overcame Satan by saying it is written time and time again that's how we'll overcome as well so in chapter 9 there's 11 proofs the Roman Catholic Church is the mother Harlot Jesus said few there be that find the narrow road very few people will overcome this Beast system and her daughters of course you see this uh Antichrist Spirit through the four horse riders and the Seven Seals that's really important we know the name of that Rider is death so death starts out as a white horse rider a deceptive false Doctrine then it turns into the red horse rider killing and attacking its opponents then it turns into a money-making Ministry the black horse rider then turns into spiritual death the pale horse rider also in this chapter the mark of the beast is taught the image of the Beast the number of the beast's name the future Antichrist so many important topics that we need to know about as Believers and of course I'll leave video links in the description for this topic in closing friends I hope this has been a helpful video by God's grace since I was asked about it I wanted to respond to this person's question he was a new message believer and he wanted some recommendations on topics so these are my top 10 I'm not saying they're perfect but after meditating on this for a few study sessions I felt these would be my top 10 I also tell people when I first came in the message I read the entire church age book that's the foundation of my Ministry my faith in the word of God along with the Bible of course because that's what the church age book is just one big Bible study taking us back to the word of God of course giving historical links and so forth on the seven Church ages and so of course there's many honorable mentioned subjects that could be in here such as the seven Church ages such as the Seven Seals predestination hell's not eternal having a Godly home life with your family Divine Healing Miracles and so forth perhaps I'll do a part two of this if I get some comments in the description and I feel led of the holy spirit so feel free to leave me some comments what other topics would you include what would your top 10 be friends we want to say we're so thankful for the message of this hour the Gospel of Jesus Christ restored according to Matthew 17:11 Revelation 107 through God's true servant William brandham restoring the original gospel that Jesus Christ reveal to St Paul if you have any questions or concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
