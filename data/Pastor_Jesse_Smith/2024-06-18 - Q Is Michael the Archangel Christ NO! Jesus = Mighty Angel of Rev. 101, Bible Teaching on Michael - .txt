TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] and at that time Michael should stand the great Prince Michael was Christ of course who fought the Angelic Wars in heaven greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this videos to answer a viewer's question is Michael the Archangel Christ this is an excellent question my answer is no and I'll get to all the reasons why in this video but first friends I'm Jesse Smith pastor of bride of Christ Fellowship here in akan Ohio USA and I defend the Bible revelations that Jesus Christ revealed to St Paul and now is had to restore through the late Prophet brother William Branham 1909 to 1965 I also defend brother bram's Godly Christian character to summarize my brief answer no I do not believe Michael is Jesus Christ there's a lot of Bible support for this answer and Friends there's only two quotes from Brother Branham where he says Michael is Christ so it looks like brother Bram grew of course in his Revelation on Michael and two quotes from brother brandom in 18 years of recorded sermons is a very very small sample size in comparison there's 54 quotes on the third poll and there's 426 quotes that say baptized in the name of Jesus so here's the outline for the video we'll look at Bible teaching on Michael then we'll look at reasons Michael is not Christ and then we'll look at quotes from Brother brandom Bible teaching on Michael first of all according to the Hebrew lexicon the word Michael means who is like God there's five verses about Michael the Archangel the first is Daniel 10:13 the angel that visited Daniel said but Lo Michael one of the chief princes came to help me the first time we see Michael mentioned is him helping an angel get to Daniel and he's called one of the chief princes now what I believe is that means Michael was one of the two covering cherubs by The Throne of God the other would have been Lucifer and then Michael would have been the second now I can't prove that by scripture but that's my guess based upon the word of God that's just my humble opinion the second mention of Michael is in Daniel 10:21 the angel again shows there's none that holds with me in these things but Michael your prince so here we see that Michael was Israel's Prince which means a leader or captain in the Hebrew so Michael's the leader of the Jews Michael's the captain of the Jews that means God's protective ministering Spirits over the people of Israel remember in context there was a Prince of Persia there was a demon power over the kingdom of Persia so then the people of God had to have an angel over them and that was Michael next Daniel 121 says at that time shall Michael stand up the great Prince which standeth for the children of thy people so here we see Michael spoken of this is during the seven-year Great Tribulation period Michael stands up which means to hold one's ground in Hebrew and he stands up for Israel Daniel's people so not the Gentiles the Jews thy people means Jews not Gentiles so again we see Michael connected with the nation of Israel the next verse is Jude 1:9 it says Yet Michael the Archangel when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses dur not bring against him a railing accusation but said the Lord rebuke thee so here we see Michael called an archangel which means the chief of angels I'll get to that more in a little bit here we see how Michael did not revile Lucifer or Satan he just rebuked him so here see even Michael showing some level of respect for Lucifer or Satan I think now would be a good time to remind you that I made a video called dumb devil there's preachers today calling the devil dumb I believe that's a bad thing to do I don't think that's a good thing to do because here even Michael the Archangel would not revile Satan he simply rebuked him so Lord willing I'll leave a link to that video in the description next there's a beautiful clue here in the scripture Michael's connected with the Resurrected body of Moses so we see somehow Michael knew that Moses's body was raised and resurrected and then Moses went to heaven sometime shortly after he actually died of course we know this is true because in Matthew chap 17 on Mount Transfiguration Moses and Elijah meet Jesus to talk about his decease or his crucifixion so we see Michael connected to a resurrected body and that's why on a recent video I said that perhaps Michael will give the voice he'll be the voice voice of the Archangel for the dead in Christ to rise first remember 1 Thessalonians 46 And1 17 say there's three phases to the Rapture shout voice Trump I currently believe and I stand to be corrected I could be wrong but I I believe the shout is brother Ram's ministry that's going around the world the Rapture process has started just like the process of God giving Israel an exodus out of Egypt and then placing them in the promised land was a process brother Ram's Ministry was the shout The Voice of the Archangel I believe would be Michael's voice calling forth the dead in Christ the Bible says the dead in Christ will rise first and then the Trump the last Trump would be the last trumpet to the Gentiles and then 1 Corinthians 15 says that last Trump is the moment when we're changed in the moment in a twinkle of an eye death is swallowed up in life our sinful bodies are swallowed up in a glorified body so notice friends the last Trump to the Gentiles is not the seventh or last Trump in the Book of Revelation the seventh and last trumpet would be found in Revelation 11 verse 15 and the seventh angel sounded and there were great voices in heaven saying the kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord and his Christ and he shall reign forever and ever so that's a topic for another video for another day Lord willing if the Lord terries it's so important to know that the last trumpet to the Gentiles is different from the last trumpet to the Jews because God works in the two separate dispensations so the fifth and final verse about Michael is revelation 12 12 7 and 8 and there was war in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought against his angels and prevailed not neither was there Place found anymore in heaven so here we see how Michael defeated Lucifer in heaven when Lucifer drew a third of the angels to join him so those are all the verses about Michael now I want to share my opinion just briefly I believe Michael was one of the two cherubims that covered the Throne of God Lucifer being the other one and this was of course before Lucifer rebelled I believe this because when Moses built The Arc of the Covenant he had two angels at the mercy seat or Throne of God Moses got this pattern from Heaven according to Hebrews 8:5 Moses was commanded make all things according to the pattern showed thee in the mount so I believe after Lucifer fell Michael became the Archangel or the chief Angel but before that Lucifer was the more beautiful of the two but he let it become a source of Pride for him this is found in Ezekiel 28:12 the Bible said he was full of wisdom and perfect in Beauty Ezekiel 28:14 said Thou Art the anointed cherub that coverthe so verse 15 thou was perfect in thy ways from the day that thou was created till iniquity was found in thee Isaiah gives more the thoughts of Lucifer Isaiah 1413 for thou said in thine heart I will Ascend into heaven I'll exalt my throne above the stars of God I will sit also upon the Mount of the congregation in the sides of the north I will Ascend above the heights of the clouds I will be like the most high now look at reasons Michael is not Christ first reason is Christ would be on the throne of God in heaven and not an angel because Christ is the object of worship or the person to be worshiped because of his glory of course this is found in many places but John 175 Jesus prayed and said and now oh Father glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was so before there was even a world that Satan could be cast down to the son was already with the father sharing his glory and that's of course because the father is invisible Spirit John 4:24 says the father is a spirit and Colossians 1:15 says the father's invisible so the first visible image of God is the son is the logos is the Holy Ghost is the Lord Jesus Christ and the invisible father shared his glory with the visible Spirit the visible manifestation of himself of course we also see this in John 1 vers1 in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God the logos was with God and the logos was God this reminds me of another Revelation how Jesus was the first one to dance the Bible says Proverbs 8:30 the Bible speaks about the wisdom of God of course we know this is the Holy Ghost this is Jesus the logos and then it says then I was by him as one brought up with him and I was daily his Delight rejoicing always before him rejoicing in the habitable part of his Earth and my Delights were with the sons of men so this word rejoicing means to play music singing dancing so it's a beautiful picture of the visible Son of God rejoicing before the invisible father more about the first reason um the angel host of Heaven worshiped God so the son had the same Glory as the father and that made the son the object of worship as well because the son is the visible image of the invisible God Nehemiah 9:6 says this and the host of Heaven worshipthe thou even Thou Art Lord alone thou has made Heaven the heaven of Heavens with all their hosts the Earth and all things that are therein so the Lord God Alone made the host the heavenly host and all the host of Heaven worships God or Jesus and we also know this is true because Ephesians 3:9 says God created All Things by Jesus Christ Jesus Christ is the word of God the invisible father created All Things by his word or Jesus Christ the logos second reason is the book of Hebrews says Jesus was made a little lower than the angels and it says God never called an angel son so we see this in Hebrews 2:9 but we see Jesus who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death Hebrews 1:8 says but unto the son he saith thy Throne oh God is forever and ever so here the son gets the same Glory as the father Hebrews 1:10 says and thou Lord in the beginning Hast laid the the foundation of the earth and the heavens are the work of thine hands remember God created All Things by Jesus Christ Ephesians 3:9 and then Hebrews 1:13 but to which of the Angels said he at any time sit on my right hand until I make thine enemies thy foot stol so there it plainly says God never had the Angels sit on his right hand or sit on the throne of God then Hebrews 1:14 says the angels are all ministering Spirits sent forth to minister for them who shall be Heirs of salvation so Hebrews 1 and Hebrews 2 shows a clear distinction between angels and Jesus Christ and so notice Jesus was made a quickening spirit that's a lifegiving spirit in 1 Corinthians 15:45 but the angels of God are simply ministering Spirits so there's a great difference between Jesus a quickening spirit one who can make alive that's a great difference with just the Angels they're simply ministering Spirits the third reason we know Michael is not Christ is because brother never preached an entire sermon on this subject like brother Ram taught an entire sermon on mzc brother Ram never taught an entire sermon on Michael was Christ whenever brother R would teach on a topic he would use large amounts of scripture large amounts of biblical support to prove a point like who is this mzc like the future home like serpent seed like water baptism like the godhead like the Seven Seals the seven Church ages and so forth now friends let's look at quotes from Brother brandham there's only two quotes where brother Bram says Michael is Christ so again that's a very small sample size compared to a topic like the third poll that has 54 or baptize in the name of Jesus 426 and I'm sure there's another way I could word that about baptism in the name of Jesus Christ and there would be hundreds more if not a thousand more so the two quotes where brother random said he believed Michael was Christ were from 1955 and 1963 brother brandom said Michael was Christ of course who fought the Angelic Wars in heaven with the devil let's listen to the quote and at that time Michael should stand the great Prince Michael was Christ of course who fought the Angelic Wars in heaven with the devil Satan and Michael fought together or fought against each other rather the second quote is 1963 Christ The Mystery of God revealed brother Braham said the first thing that Lucifer done to separate the fellowship of God and man he said was build a United Kingdom a greater Splendor a greater Kingdom than Michael Christ had let's listen to the quote the first thing that Lucifer done to separate the fellowship of God and man he wanted to build him a United Kingdom of Greater Splendor and seemingly more cultured a greater Kingdom than Michael Christ had on the other side there's many many quotes where brother Ram said Michael was not God Michael was not Christ I'll just do one it's from the breach 1963 brother Ram said there wasn't worthy people there in heaven when the seven seal book needed looked at picked up and then loosed he said the Angels weren't worthy he didn't say Gabriel or Michael it had to be a Kinsman he said they were in a different category that had never fallen so we can plainly see that brother Bram said Michael could not take the book but Christ could take the book so Michael cannot be Christ let's listen to the quote not that there was some worthy people there not like an angel like uh for instance we'd say a Gabriel or Michael but remember he'd had to be a Kinsman remember John said here and no m n not Angel amen not sarapin they hadn't sin but they were in a different category they had never fallen I think I'll share one more quotes from Souls that are in prison now 1963 November 10th morning service brother R speaking of Revelation 10 1-7 the mighty angel coming down and brother brandom calls that Mighty Angel The Covenant Angel which was Christ brother Bram notes how this Mighty Angel Christ in Revelation 10 has the same attributes as Christ had in Revelation CH 1 a rainbow over his head a face that shine like the sun and other attributes so Revelation 10:1 said Christ came came down as a mighty angel that means a mighty messenger and as message Believers we believe this Mighty Angel was represented by the cloud picture from February 28th 1963 in one place brother Bram said it was seven angels making up the head of Christ similar to the painting done by Hinrich Hoffman Hoffman's head of Christ and then we see when brother R preached the Seven Seals the next month in March of 1963 he said the Holy Ghost visit him every day in the form of the pillar of fire he also said the angel Lord visited him so we see Christ coming down as a mighty Angel is Christ coming down to reveal his word to his Prophet God coming down himself in a spirit form not the Corporal body of the Lord Jesus Christ but a spiritual body or Celestial body because angels have celestial bodies so Jesus Is Not An Angel but Jesus comes down in a spiritual form so the Bible calls it a mighty Angel and so we see here in Revelation 10 the same thing God did in Exodus 23:20 God sent an angel before Moses to keep him in the way and bring him into the place which God prepared for him that's in Exodus 2320 down to Exodus 23:23 of course this Angel was the Holy Ghost again the word Angel here means messenger and we just called this Angel the angel of the Covenant because he was going to bring Moses into the promises of the Covenant and so we believe that's the same thing the Lord Jesus Christ did by the Holy Ghost with brother brandham the Holy Ghost was with brother brandham in a son of man Ministry to bring him into the promises of finishing the mystery of God Revelation 10 verse 7 and surely the Holy Ghost was with brother brandham Discerning the thoughts and intents of the heart so I believe this is a verse where God hides the truth from the wise and prudent and reveals it unto babes such as would learn so let's listen to the quote from Souls that are in prisoned now notice it was to be the seventh Angel's message that was to reveal the seventh the Seven Seals Revelations 10:7 now you'll find it see and he saw this Angel come down put his foot on the land and on the sea that was Christ had a rainbow over his head notice him you find him in Revelations 1 again with the rainbow over he said look upon is Jasper and Sardis and so on here he come put one hand one foot upon the land one upon the Water raised up his hand he had a rainbow over his head yet that's a covenant he was a covenant Angel which was Christ made a little lower than the to suffer there he come and put his hands up to heaven and swore by him that lives forever and ever the Eternal one the father God that time shall be no more in closing friends I hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God it's wonderful we just enjoy these Bible revelations straight from the scriptures brother Brandon pointed us to these truths and rejoices our hearts it's wonderful again to see how brother Ram can grow in Grace and knowledge of the Lord reminds me of recently I preached how Jesus said the Holy Ghost will guide us into all truth and that doesn't mean understanding every single thing in the Bible but it means giving us all the things that we need that pertain to life and godliness as second Peter 1 says so we can see how the Holy Ghost was helping brother Ram grow in Revelation and understanding brother Braham thought Michael was Christ but he never made it a major Doctrine and as brother Bram said we never major on a minor the identity of Michael is a minor it's certainly not a major the major is getting people saved through the blood of Jesus Christ by grace through faith Ephesians 2 8-10 and Romans 3:25 faith in the blood of Jesus Christ that's the major that we must focus on by God's grace it seems friends that you know accusers of brother brandham are just trying to revile him to try to connect him to the false religion of the Jehovah's Witnesses that's sad brother BR was not a Jehovah's Witness he was a born again Holy Ghost filled Christian a genuine prophet of God an Elijah anointed Prophet according to Matthew 17:11 Malachi 4:5 and6 the prophet to finish the mystery of God Amos 37 and 8 and Revelation 10:7 we're so thankful for the message of this hour it's transformed my life I know it's transformed your life so praise the Lord Jesus Christ that he's finished the mystery of God and we're eating the book and sharing these prophecies that God gave to brother brandham with every kind tribe tongue and Nation by God's grace if you have any questions or concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
