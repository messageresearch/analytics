kind of ended with that on sunday morning and i think i'd like to pick up there by god's grace isaiah 53 let's go to verse 4. praise god isaiah 53 verse 4. thank god for jesus and all he has done for us these are just amazing scriptures again to revisit let's read uh four five and six i'll read four and five will read six together so let me do four and five here verse four says surely he hath borne our griefs and carry our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of god and afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed i love that we are healed let's read verse six together let's read that on three one two three oh we like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way and the lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all let's have one more word of prayer if you ever need on your heart let's make it known unto god heavenly father lord i raise my hands i'm in need of your help tonight lord god you told us to gather more as we see that day approaching we're gathered in your house lord god gathering more looking forward to the upcoming meetings uh this month lord god and our time to in the fall to kind of consecrate lord a weekend to you father but lord we're here we are tonight we're grateful lord for this opportunity we're grateful father for your word and all that you've done through your son jesus christ or all these amazing things lord you've done everything lord god and lord and you give us every good every good and perfect gift so we thank you for that speak to us now through thy word lord anoint me your servant anoint your people here father god and may we experience your presence in a wonderful way tonight and we'll be happy when we leave here lord god to say that it was good to be in the house of the lord and father will give you the glory in jesus christ's name this ain't said amen praise god god bless you as you're being seated i do have some slides there by god's grace so uh we'll continue here um i just made it yellow so i could see it better we'll look at part 13 tonight by the grace of the lord and i'd like to uh continue on the question too so i'm sorry they're on the first question that uh i asked i asked the brother if these were uh the right things is it right for men and women to cross-dress uh is the transgender movement right is bruce jennerite and where did god change deuteronomy 22 5. so i kind of put like four questions in one that's uh kind of how you have to do it you kind of got to put those all together now i want to bring up this your thought these are uh as as our brother was talking our friend was talking we'd say these are additional points that he made afterwards i want to go through these and uh prove all things uh how many been reading your bible this week and searching the scriptures daily whether those things were so praise god and so we do that by the grace of the lord uh so our brother said brother branham should not have said god poured out his wrath upon jesus's body and his his saying was because god so loved the world so one of the state one of the accusations against uh the message of the hour is that we believe god poured out his wrath upon jesus but the other side differs and said no god didn't because god so loved the world now the truth is that we know god does love the world and because god does love the world he gave the world a chance to be forgiven by pouring out the wrath upon jesus jesus took the wrath as the scapegoat and as the the goat that died right he became god's lamb and so the fact is because god loved the world so much he cursed jesus what uh what a thing jesus did there to take your curse to take your punishment and we'll look at that scripture now let's just look at that again real quick now you remember the bible said god set forth his son to be a propitiation through faith in his blood to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are passed through the forbearance of god number propitiation is an atonement it's a payment for sin so jesus was god's way to pay for sin we know jesus said the son of man came to give his life as a ransom for many a ransom is a payment so jesus took uh the the wrath of god as a payment uh for god paying the the penalty for all the sins of mankind and that's the scripture so we see that jesus is the atonement and just looking at this scripture again just look at look at the language here you know he bore your grief so all your grief jesus bored on his back right all your sorrows jesus carried it all of it uh he was smitten he was smitten of gods that means uh he was smitten for you and i right he was afflicted for you and i because the griefs were ours the sorrows belonged to us the the smiting belonged to us the affliction belonged to us the wounds for the transgressions belong to us right the bruising for the iniquities belong it actually belonged to us the chastisement to pay for the peace was upon him but it belonged to us we deserve the chastisement uh but with his stripes we are healed so the stripes really belong to us the scripture says we've all gone astray like sheep turn on everyone his way and here it is right here the lord laid on him the iniquity of us all so our brother's just wrong right uh and and i think you know when people leave the message they run off to to popular by you know tv preachers or internet preachers that seem to have some truth but but don't they don't have all the truth right they have a little bit of truth but not all of it and so they paint in a social gospel where where it's all flowery god is all love god is all love but in this scripture this is the love of god they say god is all love but no he didn't pour out his wrath upon jesus the bible clearly says he did amen he poured out the iniquity he poured out the payment the ransom for sin all of it was laid on jesus christ and look at verse 10 yet it pleased the lord to bruise him he hath put him to grief and then now the bible said when thou shalt make his soul and offering for sin he shall see a seed that's us he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the lord shall prosper in his hand now look at the bible says it please god to do it it please god how many parents you'll do anything to keep your child from suffering any little suffering right you would do anything to keep your child from stubbing their just small stubbing their toe or for any any little pain you do anything to keep them from that but not but the lord with his divine love he poured all of the punishment on jesus so that he didn't even look like a man now i'm going to skip ahead i got some numerous quotes i think i'm i think i had them placed down here so i'm going to skip ahead okay yeah here's now along these same same lines our brother said william branham's god carries a big stick and that sounds uh it sounds like brother brown was too harsh right that's what they're saying lauren was too harsh that's not true and uh you know they try to make it sound like you know god is up there just waiting to spank us we see they try to paint like god is so loving but message people just see him as a an angry dad that wants to uh spank you with a stick now see the the truth is god loves you right god is full of love but he knows he's got to correct you as well and if and the way and the bible the bible's clear the only way jesus learned obedience was through love no suffering right is that right jesus learned obedience through the things he suffered okay so we yes we look at god as a loving god but we see his love is expressed through correction right but also through blessings how many how many love to shout and praise god amen as much as anybody i like to dance around here and praise the lord and i like to scream and and yell and cry and worship i love those feelings from god and we enjoy those week week after week we enjoy those church week after week we get to smile and praise god and feel his presence and just feel renewed right but sometimes during the week we get a good spanking right so it's both god is full of love but he said as many as i love i rebuke and chasten in church a real holy ghost filled saying they don't spend their time every day getting spent by god right because if you do you say sorry anyway and then it's over praise god it's not a it's not a required 30 steps of penance or a let's say a five hail mary's like i don't know how many they have to do but they have to do a certain number of hail marys that's not you and i as soon as we say we're sorry god forgives us now depending on how severe our mistake was we might have to live with some consequences right like if you lie for example well then if you lie to somebody you say you're sorry god forgives you but then that person may not trust you for a while right and so you got to live with that consequence if it's even greater like uh you know like an abuse or a divorce or adultery or something like that you've got to live with it for a long time you have to live for with so it depends on the transgression but that's that's bible truth how many that's bible truth oh absolutely so does god carry a big stick i would say yeah god does and i'm going to give you some examples here so get your bibles ready maybe i can have my children read them i'll keep them on their tongues now just as you're turning uh lydia why don't you go to uh revelation 3 and then malachi if you go to um ii samuel 12. the church look at this here just for a moment paul says you have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children my son despise not thou the chastening of the lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him this is not old testament right this is new testament for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth and scourges every son whom he receiveth if you endure chastening god dealt with you as sons for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not and the saint said now new testament teaching says if god loves you he's going to rebuke you and and the writer says when someone backsides they forget that god is gonna correct you if he loves you so see what is he he's trying to get the attitude of oh i sinned it's okay i it's it's not a big deal i'll just say sorry he's going after that half-hearted repentance that isn't even real repentance are you with me because that he says you're gonna don't forget that you are a child in god's eyes and god's not gonna let you let you get away with stealing that cookie from the cookie jar right he's not going to let you get away with that because that's not it's not love if he knows you did it and doesn't correct you then he if he doesn't correct you that's not love he has to correct you now look at this word the brother said god brother graham's god carries a big stick well the bible says god carries a stick because this word scourge now look at that every son how many sons and daughters of god we got in here every one of us is going to get scourged when we uh dis respect the lord every one of us if he doesn't scourge us we're not sons and daughters and so see all these uh ideas come up and it's it's like one lie after another and i'm like there's just so many lies you know it's like it's like uh it's like somebody dropping confetti and trying to catch all of that i mean who's gonna be able to catch all that confetti you know you're gonna be able to catch all of it you just gotta so during as as we debate you know i'm just trying to ask the holy spirit to help me remember but look the bible said he's scourged now this word scourge is used 13 times and it all means a physical whipping it actually means a blow a blow with a stick the word blow is actually used in the greek so this the so uh the bible said he scourges everyone it's not a physical blow now you might suffer physically for some mistake you made right but these are spiritual blows so in other words church god is going to humble you in your mind i'm not as great as i thought i was i'm not as perfect as i thought i was and you got to feel he wants you to feel so low that you you depend more on him not that you have a pity party and let the devil beat you up but you realize i'm nothing without him amen and then that fulfills the scripture blessed are the poor in spirit they know how poor uh mor morally they are without the leadership of the holy spirit without humbling myself in prayer and and saying before god in prayer and and surrendering to god i'm gonna fall short of the glory and so the brother says god programs god carries a big stick well the bible says he carries a big stick in the new testament and this is the same scourging as they scourged jesus now what was scourging remember they took him they tied him up and they whipped him so it's the same so spiritually god is gonna have to whip us sometimes right and what the bible say we're like we're like sheep dumb and we're delivered to the slaughter all the day long so sometimes they're just whipping and oh you shouldn't do that you shouldn't do that now church when we repent then we repent and then the whipping stops right we learn how many want to learn your lesson and not get whipped all day see the only reason a message person will get whipped all day is because they're totally backslidden right or not totally or maybe partially like why don't you just confess it say you're sorry and do different act differently praise god take the word of god and obey it and speak to that that trouble speak to it and and receive god's power and let the obedience of god surrender your will and don't live all day like you're getting whipped come out of that and learn the lesson and move on and be let god be glorified in your life yeah there are message people that get beaten all day long and and uh but that's their own fault because after a while it's not god anymore it's the devil they're letting the devil beat them up like i'll never be a good christian i'll never you can't say that got to say i'm sorry lord i'm so sorry my fault my mistake forgive me god help me jesus help me do better tomorrow i'll help me to overcome so yes god is a god a great god who carries a big stick he is now here's the examples i had uh we're all scourge's sons lydia as many as i love it's revelation 13. i'm sorry revelation 3. so lydia uh let me get that scripture if you got it you can read it i know you probably know which one i'm talking about it's 3 praise god so all jesus asks is that we zealously that means eagerly repent so message people uh if they don't zealously repent if they half-heartedly repent well i still want to do this sin i still want to enjoy this i still like then of course you're going to keep getting whipped right brother brahm called it haunting remember that remember that word haunting he said his critical spirit haunted him yeah yeah you're going to feel like my sins are haunting me because you're not putting them under the blood right we gotta have thorough repentance brother ramsay or true repentance or else you're gonna feel like yeah god is whipping me all day what's because you won't repent he carries a big stick yes he's trying to get you to surrender and obey because if he loves you you'll repent i'm sorry if he loves you uh yes if he loves you he'll correct you and then you repent now david and bathsheba's baby died because of their sin i thought god was love all the time well sometimes god does show a great mercy but sometimes god has to do harsh things to try to get people's attention many times it's dependent upon their sin so malachi we're in second samuel 12. let me get there by god's grace didn't have the time i wanted to look at all of them here okay maokai if you would uh read 12 11 and 12 and 13. foreign all right now look is this does this god carry a big stick absolutely you did a secret sin awful thing well then you're gonna be have consequences publicly not in secret see but look is there is there mercy uh is there mercy mixed in there with the chastisement yes he could have he could have died under the the evil that i did the murder and the adultery he could have died but god gave him grace and said but you'll not die but you know what he had to live with that shame the rest of his life he had to live with the consequences the rest of his life look at verse 15 and nathan departed unto his house and the lord struck the child did the child do anything wrong no church didn't do anything wrong that you rise wife there unto david and it was very sick yet we know david i think prayed before it was at seven days when the house of the lord and look at verse 22 after after it passed away and he said while the child was yet alive i fasted and wept for i said who can tell whether god will be gracious to me that the child may live but now he's dead wherefore should i fast can i bring him back again i shall go to him and he shall not return to me so david he knew god had showed him grace but yet he was still seeking god if god would give him more grace and to show his sincerity now look how sincere that is he laid before the lord wouldn't eat they begged him to eat he wouldn't eat until he realized that the baby had passed but does our god carry a big stick absolutely but does he also supply a lot of grace absolutely praise god and as parents that's what god is teaching us there's times we've got to be really harsh and sincere with something right but then there's times to show grace and the way to know is just in the moment say god guide me god guide me in church we got to be aware if we didn't pray that morning if we didn't have a if we realized we've been cranky all day or didn't get enough sleep or you know we gotta say god give me grace not to make the wrong choice right we can't put our frustration out on them but we know children need uh just correction right the bible said if you don't correct them leave them to their self they're gonna go astray and their souls will be lost i'm paraphrasing that's in proverbs now uh for time sake elisha's servant was cursed with leprosy for all generations so get he's a servant now that's that's a hard thing to understand remember uh naaman it might have been elisha uh naaman got healed right as he was leaving he tried to give elijah gift he said how could i take a gift this god did this he left but hazel went out and said we'll take those garments and elijah said gaze this ain't a time to receive the gift of god and god smote him with leprosy and all of his seat after him god is a god of correction he should have known better he was around the prophet can you imagine being around the prophet the whole time and the prophet said don't take a gift you don't take a gift but it's lust for money or lust for popularity or whatever it was it caused the all the generations afterwards to have leprosy god flooded the earth due to constant evil thoughts and deeds that's animals and and humans grandpas grandmas children god flooded all of it because only evil was on their hearts continually and he preached for what maybe 100 year 120 years preaching and warning them get away from this come into the ark there's salvation live a life of righteousness praise god amen and after 120 years god said that give enough time i've given them so much time i've got to correct them let's read this one again this one's uh just so striking uh second corinthians 12. this is what i was saying in the debate you know uh the other side and then of course every other uh you know person who's on the the the the disgrace side i'll say like that the disgrace side they always say you know oh well ephesians 2 8 we're saved by grace through faith well we're just saying by grace through faith say about grace today and then church and then that such a it's such a flimsy argument that they don't even see what what else paul said paul said examine yourself to see if you're in the faith he said if not you'll reprobate so paul wasn't preaching you know easy grace and and everybody saved and every he said grace is the amazing thing that saves us but we gotta be grateful for the gift and then thank god and live a life of gratitude after we've received the gift of grace so the same man that was saved by grace and taught were saved by grace the same man would get prideful at times so god had to humble him and not with loving loving oh you know paul you really need to humble yourself and would you please humble yourself paul i mean is that that's what people think is just a soft gentle preacher paul could could you be more humble today excuse me paul no god sent a demon to humble him a tormenting devil but yet we're saved by grace i'm saying by grace through faith god loves me god loves yes he does and he knows exactly how to get you humble does god carry a big stick absolutely see these are just these are just weak arguments they're just thrown out there that people cling to and you know they you know you know why they want to say that because they know they're guilty and that will kind of relieve their conscience a little bit but it's a lie their conscience is seared when they say that oh god is a god of love he doesn't punish me he doesn't he doesn't correct me he doesn't carry a big stick oh yes he does singer in these 12. verse 7 and lest i should be exalted above measure through the abundance of revelations there was given to me a thorn in my flesh the messenger of satan to buff at me lest i should be exalted above measure so god knew jesus knew paul's going to get prideful and because i love him i'm going to send him a buffeting demon so he doesn't get packed now look church this is the approach so so his attitude on this should be our attitude on anything bad that happens right lord please take this cancer away can i just say like that lord please take this coronavirus away lord please take this headache away or what you name it right that is the right approach lord take it away if it's your will right god please deliver me from it because paul asked three times not one time three times three times oh loving father can you imagine that oh loving god take away this demon from me the loving god said my grace is sufficient for you in weakness that'll really turn over some new leaves and people's lives wanted i better turn over something new i better try something i better think differently oh loving god and loving god of mercy uh david could have said please don't take my child but yet god did because god is a god of mercy and god knows what's best how many know that god said i don't need your counsel i don't need the counsel of man i'm smart enough to know right i don't need the brothers counsel i don't need the sister's counsel my counsel will stand my counsel's right i don't have a second thought about anything my first thought is always right amen i don't need to ask the devil for his opinion i don't need to ask you for your opinion i know what's best for my children and i'll do what's best and i'll i'll bring them into humility and i'll teach them to trust in me and not to get prideful and just always trust and and thank god for the grace that i give them that they can make it through the trials they face huh a messenger of satan from the god of love so the god of love sends the opposite the god of this world what about that so church we got to be aware verse 8 for this thing i besought the lord thrice that it might depart from me and he said to me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness how are we going to be strong by realizing how little we are when we realize how little we are and not to get exalted in me because i got the revelation of the message amen we have we have an abundance of revelations right we have serpent seed in godhead and daniel 70 weeks all these abundance of revelations god help me not to be exalted well god may just send something in your life to keep you humble he may do it church and then he'll say my grace is sufficient when you're weak trust in my grace you're the one that wrote i'm saved by grace through faith you're the one that wrote it so trust in the grace of god trust in the favor of god trust in the unmerited favor of god even while a satanic buffeting messenger is hurting me yes trust in the grace of god and those are beautiful red letter words that's love don't forget though paul had great miracles right paul was raised from the dead right paul raised uticus from the dead he had great highs and mountains and mountain tops and everything but he also had some dark valleys most gladly therefore will i rather glory in my infirmities that the power of christ may rest upon me therefore i take pleasure in infirmities in reproaches and necessities and persecutions and distresses for christ's sake for when i am weak then i am strong amen see when we're humble when we realize we're nothing when we realize that it's not because of anything good we've done then we're strong we're strong in the word of god we're trusting in god we only say his word we won't say our word we won't take any credit for ourselves we'll give jesus all the credit for when i'm weak then i'm strong so strength comes from recognizing god's grace in every situation well does god carry a big stick certainly does certainly those are just a few examples i came up with just real quick so god gives blows he he uh chastens every sun with a stick that's the context all right so now let me move back to this one the other thing that was brought up was uh the precious brother tim i think his name tim cross he said well he said brother jesse he said you got to understand he said it really nice he said a covenant is different than a new testament remember i'm the whole point is i'm trying to show deuteronomy 22 5 and the new and the 10 commandments still pertain to us today he said well you know a covenant is different than a testament brother yeah i just studied on covenants a few months ago so i was i didn't have time to say it but church the covenant is a covenant literally means a testament literally it's another synonym form okay so covenant is used for testament 33 times the new testament in the new covenant so they're synonymous they're not different words they're the same and so see like where is that thought even in the bible that that a covenant you'll see well we're under the new covenant not the not the old testament you know they're trying to separate these things and we don't need the old testament so they're different but no they're one in the same praise god a covenant is a testament and remember it's the righteousness of the law that's fulfilled in us praise god so new testament holy ghost phil saints live righteously that the old testament couldn't live right because they had a remembrance of sin praise god they had a remembrance of their sins year after year but we're supposed to come to the house of god we're supposed to come to the altar and forget all of our sins praise god amen hallelujah we're supposed to know that we are forgiven we're separated from our sins our sins are abolished right they're done away with they're remitted they're sent away we're supposed to leave here feeling forgiven praise god they can never do that under the blood of bulls and goats but the blood of jesus christ separates us from all our unrighteousness praise god and then we leave here feeling great about what god has done not about ourselves now we can feel good and thankful for the situation we're in but they could never do that remember i went through that a few months ago the bible says that in hebrews the worshiper was he was purged in his flesh but never his mind his mind was never purged from from his guilt and he had a remembrance of the sin as soon as he left worshipping so abraham we could say he could have gave a sacrifice for lying but then as he walked away he would still have that guilt in his heart but church we can lie and say jesus forgive me i'll never do that again and walk away and feel great and feel forgiven by god's grace so that argument doesn't work because whatever and here's here's what i'll say whatever god wants to continue from the old testament to the new it's still in effect it's god's choice it's not our choice it's not a cut and dry thing we have to search the scriptures for in them we think we have eternal life praise god and they testify of jesus christ remember they were searching their mishnas but the real bereans searched the scriptures daily praise god amen that's right now the third point they made or against me i was saying how paul paul was filled with the holy ghost saved by grace and yet he said in romans 17 he said i still do things that i hate and the brother said no that was when paul was a sinner i said no that was when he was saved so let's read it romans 7. so look at 14 and 15. paul said i am not i was paul says i do not i did so let's go to romans 7. well you're probably there i need to turn there romans 7. now i was looking this chapter over there's nothing in here uh that paul says well i'm only talking about my past life okay romans let's go to 13 was then that which is good made death unto me god forbid but sin that it might appear sin working death in me by that which is good that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful for we know that the law is spiritual but i am carnal sold under sin notice i am carnal he still had a carnal part for that which i do i allow not not i did notice now i did that which i do i allow not okay verse finishing verse 15. but what i hate that i do if then i do that which i would not i can say unto the law that it is good now there is no more i that do it but sin that dwelleth in me for i know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing for to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good i find not she's not saying i i found not he said i find right now it's always it's present tense for the good that i would i do not but the evil which i would not that i do now if i do that i would not it is no more i that do it but sin that dwelleth within me what a revelation praise god what a revelation for a believer to say when i sin it's really not my soul it's my flesh and my mind praise god it's the sin that dwells in me it's not i that sin the soul it's my body and mind that sin verse 21 i find a law that when i would when i would do good evil is present with me for i delight in the law of god after the inward man but i see another law of my members warren against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members amen see there's there's the greatest battle ever fault right warring against my mind praise god this is a mind battle this is a mind war we are fighting the greatest battle ever fought church but thank god we're given the greatest revelation of god's word as well amen hallelujah verse 23 but i see another law my members warn against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my memory so where do we where do we become slaves in our minds like that song says a prisoner in your mind that's where paul became a slave that's where all of us become a slave but don't stop reading he said oh wretched man that i was he don't say that churches i know early in the chapter he was talking about before he was a christian but here he said wretched man that i am because remember you got to remember remember the other scripture we read he was going to get exalted through revelations right is that a good man or is that a wretched man was that the good part of him or the wretched part that's the ratchet part the wretched part would think i'm somebody i deserve all these revelations but paul said it's a o wretched man that i am who shall deliver me from the body of this death i thank god through jesus christ our lord so that with the mind i myself serve the law of god but with the flesh the law of sin there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit praise god amen do you see anything in there church that says that this is only dealing with paul before he became a christian no he says i am i the things i do i hate i do them right now right and then he says oh wretched man that i am there's nothing in there but look how i'll say it like this look how the enemy will try to twist this and say oh well see paul paul was so much more holy now he was holy one way but they tried to make it like oh well brother i made two mistakes there's no way he was born again oh nonsense paul said i the things i want to do i don't do sometimes and the things that i i do things that i hate sometimes he says i'm a wretched man but thank you jesus for giving me the victory in my mind through the lord jesus christ hallelujah amen thank the lord hallelujah this whole the whole passage is present tense all the way down to verse 25 it's not past tense all right i'll take about 15 more minutes here let me i'll just go about an hour here lord now the second question that he asked me that remember the first one was king james version went over that on sunday the second one was he goes through all these things brother graham said he says the way of doubt is overwhelming on brother bannon's ministry what do we do with deuteronomy 18 20-22 so let's read that what do we do with that deuteronomy 18 20-22 in church this is where i i can totally understand why people would be confused in the message and if they didn't sit long enough and study something and pray about something i could easily see how people would be confused with some things brother branham said especially with the brown bear which i'll talk about next but let's look at that deuteronomy 18 20 but the prophet which shall presume to speak a word in my name which i have not commanded him to speak or that shall speak in the name of other gods even that prophet shall die and if thou say in that in heart how shall we know the word which the lord hath not spoken when a prophet speaketh in the name of the lord if the thing follow not nor come to pass that is a thing which the lord hath not spoken but the prophet has spoken it presumptuously thou shalt not be afraid of him okay so let me pull up my notes here for my answer to number two the second question oh there's okay all right so this is quite a statement that uh moses makes in deuteronomy how i know a prophet of god if what he says comes to pass he's a prophet but even then you've got to test him because if it comes to pass well this was in chapter 13 if it comes to passing tells you to go worship other gods he said then kill him stone him so even if something comes to pass you got to see what he says afterwards praise god so just something coming to pass isn't enough he has to have the voice the right voice behind the sign the sign as it came to pass but the voice behind it that comes after it has to be a scriptural sign so in brother man's story uh i don't have the quotes right here but brother ram tells a story he sees a vision in 1962 he said i'm going to shoot a brown bear he said i saw it it's going to be brown it's going to be this place there's going to be a brother with a checkered shirt on a green checkered shirt on okay he tells his church and it says he said it he said thus saith the lord it will be it will be okay three or four months later he comes back and tells the tabernacle he said well we saw the brown bear the brother had the checkered shirt on but i disobeyed the brothers asked me twice to go with them to go up and shoot it he said but he turned it down and he said i failed the vision he said god's vision didn't fail but i failed the vision and so the believe the sign people say well see he said something's gonna come to pass and then it didn't so he must not be a prophet okay and this is where this shook me up for a while like i said the reason i haven't debated him for the 12 year uh eight years is because i didn't know the answers i knew what brother i'm talking the word was right and i knew other prophecies has come to pass but this one i didn't know so i said with this one is that you have to look brother god gave brother branham a vision and then i realized every vision is either conditional or it's unconditional okay and there was many examples uh paul said i have not been disobedient to the heavenly vision well that means he could have been this will be into heavenly vision right and then there was uh king saul before he became king samuel said go do this you'll see this sign that sign that sign but he obeyed all the signs but it leaves it leaves the truth that he could have disobeyed the signs right and then the understanding came to me any word of god any promise of god is either unconditional or conditional any vision of god is either unconditional or conditional okay and so the example were king king saul he said the bible said if you are faithful to the king the bible says that you will your children will inherit the throne in the next generation and saul disobeyed so that that was thus saith the lord but because he disobeyed it was taken from king saul and given to david right and then joshua 1 god told joshua every place you put your feet will be yours that was a thus saith the lord these will be your coasts uh but joshua's generation some of them disobeyed they disobeyed us at the lord so they didn't inherit it and so we look at brother branham and the brown bear he didn't say thus saith the lord i'll shoot it he said thus saith the lord it will be well he didn't tell us what parts of the vision would be thus saith the lord he just said it will be and everything as far as the brown bear it was the brown bear was there the checkered shirt was there but he had disobeyed at the end and he didn't get to shoot the bear now is that hard to understand yeah it's hard to understand but we have to also understand that a prophet that we've never lived among the prophet before we don't know how god works with them right and so it has to be that if everything else if all these other things came to pass and this one he disobeyed then it has to be an unconditional promise it has to be i'm sorry it has to be a conditional problem sorry it had to be a conditional promise so that's where i i brought it down with a brown bear because there's so many scriptures where they're conditional now my wife shared a good one with me today so let's go to jonah chapter three jonah daniel hosea joel namus obadiah jonah jonah 3. look at jonah 3 verse 1 and the word lord came unto jonah the second time saying arise go into nineveh that great city and preach unto it the preaching that i bid thee and jonah rose and went under nineveh according to the word of the lord now nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days journey and jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey and he cried and said yep 40 days and nineveh shall be thrown down so the people of nineveh believed god and proclaimed the fast and put on sackcloth from the greatest of them even to the least of them okay so if you look at the scripture this is basically thus saith the lord yet 40 days and nineveh shall be thrown down okay so it's basically thus saith the lord in 40 days nineveh is going to go down but was this was this conditional or unconditional conditional what does it sound like it sounds unconditional doesn't it church there's no if put in here right there's no if it just says yet forty days and nineveh shall be thrown down and church that's why jonah was so mad at the end right jonah was so mad because he said it's going to be thrown you're gonna it's gonna be crushed in 40 days but then god had mercy and what did the lord say in chapter 4 verse 10 and then the lord said thou hast had pity on the gourd for thou for which thou hast not labored neither made us to grow which came up in a night and at perishing tonight and should not i spare nineveh that great city wearing are more than six score thousand persons that cannot discern between their right or left hand which also and also much cattle now in when bro when jonah was preaching he just said 40 days i'm going to destroy this place 40 days he didn't say it just was us at the lord it's going to be 40 days and god showed mercy praise god it was conditional but it doesn't sound conditional that's like brother brahms brown bear it sounds unconditional but it was conditional and the only way to know is just make sure it's a prophet of god and see the results afterwards that's the only way to know right same thing with david we're not we're not told it was uh conditional with the bull with the baby boy but he thought it might be right he just know it got sick he didn't have a thus saith the lord so he's pleading with god uh let it be conditional and have mercy on the child right let the sickness be conditional not unconditional and yet it turned out to be conditional i'm sorry it's gonna be unconditional where god was gonna take the baby regardless of what david did even in all sincerity but church i'm bringing that out to show that that and that's why i told brother rod i said you got to look at every case individually and then he said well how can you ever know if a prophet failed well if they put a time stamp on it like this has to happen by like benny hinn i don't know if you know this benny hen said god was going to destroy all the homosexuals in america in the 1990s he said that i've heard it on tape he said he said the holy spirit tells me that thus saith the lord what that's time stamped that that didn't happen right he said it's going to happen in the 90s it didn't happen in the 90s so that's what i told the brother i said you gotta look at each one individually and see is it conditional or unconditional and you gotta be able to discern that okay uh yeah now go to second kings 20 verse 1. i'm glad that was there oh yeah i got it right here but i need five and six two seconds twenty one five and six here's something i want to bring out as well the brother says brother ram never had a vision he foretold beforehand that came to pass that was recorded before it actually took place and even on their website they have it so i don't even know he kind of he kind of criticized me a little bit but so in in 1963 brother branham said i saw a vision and florence shakarian is going to die okay now florence shakaran was a sister of demus shakarian who was like a full gospel businessman uh preacher well she had terminal cancer and it was inoperable but brother ram had a vision he announced it you know three years in advance he said foreign's gonna die now you might think and that's what brother rod said you know we might think well that's not hard to prove that's not hard to prophesy well that's true but look what has look what isaiah told hezekiah in those days was hezekiah is sick and to death and the prophet isaiah the son of amos came to him and said unto him thus saith the lord set thine house in order for thou shalt die and not live doesn't that sound pretty familiar church was hezekiah's death hard to predict was that hard to predict if he's sick unto death is it hard to predict he's going to die but yet god allowed it so brother rod criticized brother branham for telling his vision of flor and shakira's death but yet the bible shows isaiah predicting hezekiah's death and it shouldn't be hard to predict now isn't jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever now the reason brother branham's prophecy about fort chicharron was uh distinct was because brother brahma says lots of people around florida shakira were there were pentecostals they were all prophesying she's going to be well now look at that so there's numerous preachers saying they'll say the lord she's going to be well but brother i'm coming has to come around and say no i saw a vision she's going to pass that's why it's significant okay that's why it's significant now brother ram did say and brother adam use this scripture so go to verse 5 and 6. verse 5 turn again and tell hezekiah captain of my people thus saith the lord the god of david thy father i have heard that prayer i have seen thy tears behold i will heal thee on the third day thou shalt go up under the house of the lord and i will add into thy days 15 years and i will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of assyria and i will defend this city for my own sake and for my servant david's sake now look this is this is quite striking isaiah goes in to set your house in order thus saith the lord you're going to die the bible says on his way out the holy spirit says go back in and tell him he's got 15 more years now was the first thus said the lord wrong no god just gave more revelation about it he still was going to die but it was going to be 15 years later so god didn't change his word he just gave more revelation about it okay and so when brother random said this about foreign security he said the lord showed me a vision she's gonna die he said this but the lord might deliver her like he did hezekiah and so that's scriptural right that's that's scripture we just read that sometimes when people are right before death they'll cry out to god and god will say i'll extend your life a little bit longer you have a little bit more time to live like keith randolph right god gave him extra time to live he said he died he saw his body he was outside of his body he saw his body and he came back into his body god gave him extra time and so the brother brother rod criticized brother branham for saying that but i want to ask you is that scripture or not yeah that is scripture even though she saw the vision of her dying little man said i saw her die she's going to pass but god may be merciful and god may extend her life like god did for hezekiah that's totally scriptural there's nothing wrong with that and in the context of it it was a significant prophecy because people around her were saying they'll say the lord she's going to live and she died and you can hear him it's in 1965 she died in 1965 and he came and met with some of the family afterwards that's on tape and it was fulfilled but then but they'll still say well brother i never foretold a vision before uh it happened and it came to pass well yes he did and i'll try to close here and what about him telling florence humes go away yourself two mondays in a row and you're gonna gain weight and uh overcome tuberculosis now he didn't say thus saith the lord but he cursed satan in the name of jesus christ and said to know that i tell you the truth go away yourself the next two mondays that's foretelling the future i said well there's another one all right and i kind of had to go real real fast i said acts 2 38's a prime example the bible said you shall receive the holy ghost now what are those people going to say sister beatrice that we talked about a few weeks ago they got baptized and walked away out of the message out into the world what are they going to say the bible says you shall they could say well god you said i shall but what's he going to say it's based on your conditions you've got to come out of egypt you've got to go through the wilderness you've got to possess the promised land he's going to say it's based upon conditions but yet it's thus saith the lord if you repent and be baptized you shall receive the holy ghost thus saith the lord it's conditional it sure doesn't look conditional does it church there's no if in that scripture look it up sometimes there's no if if you obey or if you follow the three works of grace but yet that's what god meant because remember remember simon the sorcerer the bible said he was baptized and believed and then he said let me pay you money so i can do that and peter says you're in the root of bitterness so he repented got baptized but then he got he fell back into a bitter spirit how is that possible because it's based upon conditions he's got to meet the conditions he can't be tempted for power see he's still lessened for power he had demon powers over people to curse him and so he wanted powers over people to fill them with the holy ghost and that was the wrong attitude that power is not given by a man's desire that power is given by god almighty and so see that bitterness sprung up in his heart but it's by condition the holy ghost is by conditions think about how many people could use that scripture acts 2 38 and try to use it against god god's going to say it's based upon conditions you know what i'll do sister be interested he'll flip his bible over there to revelation 22 and said if anybody's thirsty come to me and i'll give you living water he's gonna say you weren't thirsty right is that what he's gonna say that's what he's gonna say you started thirsting for the things of the world but we church we're here tonight because we're thirsting on the things of god amen praise god see there's more you gotta you gotta eat the whole book you can't just see one scripture and say well i'm not a savior and i can live however i want and god's a god of love no you've got to eat the whole book if you love god you want all of his thoughts amen amen if you love god you want to obey all of his word church go to we'll close with us go to first kings 19 it's been a while since we read this and maybe we haven't read it first kings 19. and i i ended with this i said brother rod i said god can fulfill his scripture any way he wants let me say i just thought about this that brown bear vision i don't know i'm just saying this is possible somebody else could have shot that brown bear years later or months later and the vision could have been fulfilled you know why because god can interpret his visions any way he wants because this proves it right here first kings 19. that's not it sorry i don't have it up there that's not it either first kings 19 15 to 17. all right first kings 1915. i need to turn there i'm trying to hurry here are you saying amen zion is that what you're saying back there oh i appreciate that first kings 19 15-17 now look and the lord said unto him go return on thy way to the wilderness of damascus and when thou comest anoint has the other be king over syria you remember this scripture and jehu the son of nimshi shalt thou anoint to be king over israel and elisha the son of shaphat of abel meloha shalt thou anoint to be the prophet in thy room now church look at that he said thus ate the lord you're gonna anoint three people church he only did one of them he only did one of them but yet god said you're gonna do it so we must catch the revelation that if god wasn't going to use elijah he was going to use somebody that had the same spirit praise god amen because he's a part of the body of believers amen and they got one life they got one spirit go to the next chapter go to chapter 20. i'll show it to you no i'm sorry it's uh go to second kings go to second kings eight nine i'm sorry second kings eight and nine sorry second kings eight and nine it's not the next chapter eight and nine okay now i gotta look it up here real quick okay there it is now second kings eight now look at verses 13-15 and has yell said what but what is thy servant a dog that he should do this great thing and elisha answered the lord has showed me that thou shalt be king over syria remember we just read elijah was supposed to anoint haziel god said thus saith the lord in other words you're gonna anoint hazio he didn't verse 14. so he departed from elisha and came to his master who said to him what said elisha to thee and he said he told me that thou should surely recover and it came to pass on the moral that he took a thick cloth and dipped in the water and spread it on his face that he died and has yell reign in his stead look so this other king had to die before haziel could be anointed to be king but elijah had already gone to heaven so who anointed haziel elisha but god told elijah you're going to do it so see in other words i'm saying god can interpret his word any way he wants because it seems like he kind of changed his mind but he did it he left him there to show i said leave it like this he left him there to hide it from the eyes and the wise and prudent because he was talking about the same spirit the same spirit that was on elijah came on elisha praise god and then elisha finished what he lied just started and anointed hazel right he anointed him poured the oil on him next chapter verse is our next chapter uh second kings nine yeah 1-13 now this one's even more mysterious and elisha the prophet called one of the children of the prophets and said him gird up thy loins and take this box of oil in that hand and go to raymond gilead and when thou come and stay there look out there jehu the son of jehoshaphat the son of nimshi and go in and make him arise up from among his brethren and carry him to the inner chamber and take the box of oil and pour it on his head and say thus saith the lord i've anointed thee king over israel then open the door and flee and tarry not look at this now elisha's not doing it but another son of a prophet is doing it god uses two different people to do what he said elijah was going to do well it's thus saith the lord elijah's going to do it that is not saith the lord but i'm going to use a different person with the same spirit to do it see that so even if let's say brother i miss that brown bear i don't know someone might have shot it the next week what still thus saith the lord then i don't know or it might have been he missed it like king saul he missed out on a blessing because he disobeyed i don't know which one it was but we can see there's conditional versus conditional let's say to our feet and that was given to me by brother loris so lord bless you my lord if you listen that's a beautiful revelation that is so amazing church i believe it's there to hide it from the eyes of the wise and prudent when you look at brother evans ministry he sacrificed everything to deliver god's word to the people he kept his ministry small so he could go preach a little house services but then also preach to big campaigns so he wouldn't trust in money he'd trust in the living god hallelujah that's wonderful that's one so next time lord willing we'll look at those uh other thoughts there you can you can move over to the songs here [Music] so church let's remember that scripture the bible said god's ways are past finding out see there's there's people that might have criticized elijah oh see elijah wasn't a prophet god said that he'd anoint has he owned jehu he didn't see it was wrong but see you've got to look at elijah's message right look at elijah's message he called fire down from heaven right he uh he's a man of the wilderness right he did he called fire down from heaven he said it won't rain till i call for it all these he had all these other vindications so this one god left it there for for those people that didn't like the truth and they could say see look see he failed on it he's no real prophet but yet all the other evidence was right and god said no elijah did do it it was through that same anointing the holy spirit now that ain't beautiful i don't know mercy that that's beautiful that's just beautiful musicians if you'll come here children it's been a while since i brought that out but that's what i brought out um and church i found on every time i brought that up with the brother they never could say anything again so they just turn to something else they said well brother graham did this and blah blah blah let's go off on something else but every time and that's what the brother told me even the guy that disagreed with me another guy he said even though i don't believe the message he said you won the debate because he said you address each question head on while the other side deflected it and tried to get you look at something else rather than actually answering the question and church taught you i rejoiced in those days when those scriptures came to me i rejoice because i was nervous did brother brandon fail is brother a real prophet of god and then but you when you look at it through the bible of course he was and you have to understand is our promises scriptural i'm sorry are they are they conditional or unconditional and then you also have god can interpret his word however he wants to that's about our heads for word of prayer here tonight i know it was a little deeper here and uh maybe a little more uh mysterious but that's the god we serve you know church satan has to ratchet up his attacks how many know that the enemy is going to keep coming in like it's been battled me beatrice for eight years i'm but god's spirit raised up a standard against and now our strength rises up we didn't throw away the books and call program a lie [Music] do whatever people [Music]
