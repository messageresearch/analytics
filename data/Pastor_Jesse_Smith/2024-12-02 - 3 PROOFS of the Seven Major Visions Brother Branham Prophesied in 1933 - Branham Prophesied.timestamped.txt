[0:02] so now seem the time of of the end
[0:07] coming seven things I saw five of them
[0:09] have already come to
[0:12] pass greetings friends in the matchless
[0:14] name of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[0:16] purpose of this video is to answer a
[0:18] viewer's question are there any proofs
[0:21] of the seven major prophecies that
[0:23] brother RM gave in
[0:25] 1933 so by God's grace we'll be happy to
[0:27] make a video on this hi friends I'm
[0:30] Jesse Smith pastor bride of Christ
[0:31] Fellowship here in akan Ohio USA and I
[0:34] defend the original Gospel of the Lord
[0:35] Jesus Christ that he revealed to St Paul
[0:38] then had to restore through Martin
[0:40] Luther John Wesley and the late Prophet
[0:42] William Marin brandham who lived from
[0:44] 1909 to 1965 and I also defend brother
[0:47] Ram's Godly Christian character so
[0:50] here's the outline for the video first
[0:51] we'll look at an overview of the seven
[0:52] major visions and then we'll give three
[0:55] proofs of the seven major Visions then
[0:58] finally we'll look at the earliest
[0:59] record of the
[1:01] Visions we'll begin with an overview of
[1:03] the seven major
[1:05] Visions I'm using the version from the
[1:08] church age book the exposition of the
[1:10] seven Church Ages was released in
[1:13] December
[1:14] 1965 and the Visions begin on page 321
[1:18] of the church age book here's a visual I
[1:21] made years ago I just got the overview
[1:23] of the seven major visions of
[1:25] 1933 and this is a very short condensed
[1:28] version the first Vision was about
[1:31] musolini and his invasion and then death
[1:34] the second Vision was about Hitler his
[1:36] rise and death and the Sig freed line
[1:40] the third Vision was about fascism
[1:42] Nazism turning into communism and watch
[1:46] Russia the fourth Vision was about
[1:48] advances in science the fifth Vision was
[1:51] about the moral problem centering around
[1:54] women the sixth Vision was about a woman
[1:56] rising in power in the USA and the
[2:00] seventh major Vision was about the
[2:01] United States being bombed here's a few
[2:04] personal comments of mine about the
[2:06] overview of the seven major Visions I
[2:08] realized there are variations of some of
[2:10] the visions and their retellings brother
[2:13] random gave different details over the
[2:14] years about them so I believe the church
[2:17] age book is the best recollection
[2:19] brother random had of the seven major
[2:21] Visions I believe he was doing his best
[2:23] to remember the details brother Ram did
[2:26] not have tape recorders in 1933 in order
[2:29] to record the actual Visions we all know
[2:32] it's very hard for any human being to
[2:34] remember things that happened decades
[2:36] ago so we believe brother BR was doing
[2:37] his best to remember the seven major
[2:39] visions and brother Rand is not here to
[2:41] answer our questions nor the critics
[2:44] questions so we have to do the best we
[2:46] can by the leading of the Holy Ghost to
[2:49] understand the seven major Visions any
[2:52] honest person will admit the Visions
[2:54] shared on tape were after the fact the
[2:56] earliest recording I have of parts of of
[2:59] the Visions is March
[3:01] 1953 which we'll share a little later by
[3:04] God's grace and perhaps I'll do future
[3:06] videos on the seven major Visions going
[3:09] through some of these different details
[3:10] and variations such as Roosevelt's
[3:12] impact on World War II and other details
[3:16] if the Lord leads by God's
[3:18] grace now let's get into the three
[3:20] proofs of the seven major Visions so the
[3:23] first proof I believe is brother Ram's
[3:25] Godly Christian character that is a
[3:27] proof that the seven major visions are
[3:30] legitimate brother Ram said he had these
[3:32] seven major Visions in
[3:34] 1933 and remember friends he's a
[3:36] Vindicated prophet of God he has at
[3:38] least six thus sayi the Lord's
[3:39] prophecies that have come to pass here's
[3:42] a image of the thumbnail of a video I
[3:44] did about the six thus say the Lord
[3:46] prophecies that came to pass I also made
[3:48] a previous video about three Prophecies
[3:50] of William brandham this goes through
[3:51] how brother brand met the Bible
[3:53] requirements for being a genuine prophet
[3:55] of God and no other man alive today that
[3:57] I know of meets these require re Ms for
[4:00] being a genuine prophet of God certainly
[4:02] not Joseph brandham he doesn't meet
[4:03] these requirements Joseph brandham has
[4:05] never foretold anything in the name of
[4:07] the Lord but brother Ram has at least
[4:09] six for tellings of future events in the
[4:12] name of the Lord with thus sayith the
[4:13] Lord that have come to pass making
[4:15] brother brandom a genuine Vindicated
[4:18] Bible prophet of the Lord Jesus Christ
[4:20] brother Ram therefore is trustworthy and
[4:23] he is a legitimate genuine prophet of
[4:24] God and there's no person alive right
[4:27] now that I'm aware of that has at least
[4:29] one or to thus sayith the Lord
[4:30] prophecies that have come to pass so
[4:32] we're thankful God sent brother brandham
[4:34] as a genuine prophet of God the Elijah
[4:37] the forthcoming of Elijah to fulfill
[4:39] many Bible scriptures brother Ram was
[4:41] also a faithful Bible teacher he taught
[4:44] us true sound Bible Doctrine restoring
[4:46] our hearts back to the apostolic fathers
[4:49] according to Malachi 45 and 6 brother
[4:52] revealed the Seven Seals by the Holy
[4:54] Ghost there's 38 differences or more
[4:56] between brother bram's revelation of the
[4:57] Seven Seals versus Clarence Lin and
[5:00] Charles ta Russell's interpretation of
[5:03] the Seven Seals this vindicates brother
[5:05] randam as a genuine prophet of God who
[5:07] finished the mystery of God according to
[5:09] Revelation 10:7 and also revealed
[5:11] Secrets according to Amos 3:7 brother BR
[5:15] had the son of man gift of discernment
[5:18] in prayer lines and that's undeniable I
[5:20] met one person who experienced that and
[5:22] of course the internet's full of videos
[5:24] of people that were discerned by the
[5:27] Holy Ghost gift in brother Ram's life so
[5:30] we know brother ramom did have this Luke
[5:31] 17:30 son of man Ministry it was
[5:34] actually the final sign to the Gentiles
[5:36] before the Rapture also brother Ram is
[5:39] the most humble honest preacher I've
[5:41] ever heard and many people agree with me
[5:43] on that he was so humble about his
[5:45] mistakes his human failures but then he
[5:47] always magnified and gave all the glory
[5:49] to the Lord Jesus Christ and then
[5:52] ultimately on brother Ram's character it
[5:53] always comes down to brother Ram's
[5:55] character being Godly there's many
[5:57] people that have left the message and in
[5:59] all these cases it's brother Ram's word
[6:01] against the word of these deniers or the
[6:04] word of these people that have left the
[6:05] message and we have to remember that
[6:07] most of these people that have left the
[6:09] message most of them deny the Bible
[6:11] truths brother Ram revealed to us such
[6:13] as the revelation of the Seven Seals
[6:15] they deny Holiness standards like they
[6:17] allow their women to cut their hair they
[6:19] allow their women to crossdress and wear
[6:21] pants they allow their women to wear
[6:23] worldly things like makeup they add to
[6:25] the Bible and call God three persons
[6:27] that's heresy some of them not all them
[6:30] some of them allow tattoos some of them
[6:33] enjoy evil Wicked movies some of them
[6:35] support non-binary relationships rock
[6:38] and roll rap and other Wicked influences
[6:42] so we have to remember that most of the
[6:43] deniers of the seven major Visions are
[6:46] deniers of the Bible truths and in some
[6:49] cases they're lovers of Pleasures more
[6:50] than lovers of god let's get into the
[6:53] second proof here that the seven major
[6:54] Visions are legitimate the second proof
[6:57] is current events now this is my humble
[7:00] opinion but I believe we're currently
[7:02] seeing the fourth Vision fulfilled
[7:04] before our very eyes recently Elon Musk
[7:07] showed his progress on driverless
[7:09] Vehicles so here's a screenshot of his
[7:13] driverless car notice the definitive egg
[7:16] shape of course of the top of the
[7:18] vehicle and that's what brother random
[7:19] must have been referring to the bottom
[7:21] of any car will not be an egg shape
[7:23] it'll be the top of the car that would
[7:24] be the egg
[7:26] shape and also here's a video of the
[7:29] inside of this driverless car with no
[7:31] steering wheel just as brother Ram
[7:40] said and the third and final picture is
[7:42] the picture of the bus where you can see
[7:45] the chairs facing themselves brother Ram
[7:48] said he saw in the vision American
[7:50] family playing some sort of a game
[7:52] facing themselves in a driverless car
[7:55] without a steering wheel so I believe
[7:57] the fourth vision is in the process of
[7:59] coming to pass and we're seeing it
[8:00] happen right before our very eyes I'll
[8:03] make a couple more comments here I
[8:05] understand there are quotes from brother
[8:06] Brandon where he says five out of the
[8:08] seven Visions are fulfilled but again
[8:10] those quotes are not spoken with thus
[8:12] sayith the Lord and then there's also
[8:14] quotes where brother Ram says they don't
[8:16] have the highways yet to fulfill the
[8:18] fourth Vision I'll read one of those
[8:20] quotes it's from the voice of the sign
[8:23] 1964 brother Ram said such progress will
[8:25] take place I see automobiles looking
[8:28] like an egg going down the street
[8:29] there's cars go down the highways some
[8:32] kind of a control they don't have to
[8:33] guide it I seen an American family
[8:35] playing Checker in the back of a car
[8:38] they've got the car right now if they
[8:40] just had the highways to put it
[8:43] on so here just a year before brother
[8:45] Ram died he was saying they didn't have
[8:47] the highways yet and also regarding the
[8:50] fifth vision from my understanding the
[8:52] world hasn't seen yet the little fig
[8:54] leaf type apron and of course we don't
[8:56] want to see it as Believers because it's
[8:59] so and modest but I believe that fig
[9:01] Leaf has to be somehow a worldwide
[9:04] phenomenon because the first three
[9:07] visions were so undeniably accurate that
[9:09] it seems the rest of the Visions should
[9:11] be the same way so that's my thought on
[9:13] the fifth major Vision I don't believe
[9:15] it's fully fulfilled yet parts of it are
[9:17] of course and then the sixth Vision I
[9:20] believe this powerful woman will be the
[9:22] Roman Catholic church and I don't
[9:24] believe the Roman Catholic church has
[9:26] the United States under its complete
[9:28] power yet the seems to be connected to
[9:30] brother Ram's statement about the bride
[9:32] will be forced to stop preaching the
[9:34] word as he spoke in spoken word Original
[9:36] Seed
[9:38] 1962 and brother Ram cited Revelation
[9:40] 13:16 he said that will be the sign the
[9:43] squeeze is upon us is when the bride is
[9:46] forced to stop
[9:47] preaching and again remember the sixth
[9:50] Vision has to be undeniably fulfilled
[9:53] just like the first second and third
[9:55] Visions about musolini Hitler and the
[9:58] three isms are undeniably fulfilled and
[10:01] here's the third proof friends I believe
[10:03] the seven major Visions were valid and
[10:05] accurate by the grace of God there's a
[10:07] quote from 1961 in Daniel's 70 weeks
[10:10] brother brand references the major
[10:12] visions and he asked how many remember
[10:14] when brother Bram gave that prophecy he
[10:16] said look at the hands so I'll read the
[10:19] quote here he says that was in 1933 and
[10:21] I predicted that there would be some
[10:22] great tragedy happened to the United
[10:24] States before or by the year of 1977 how
[10:28] many members me saying that look at the
[10:30] hands
[10:31] sure so here we have a recording from
[10:34] 1961 28 years after the Prophecies of
[10:38] the seven major Visions were given in
[10:39] 1933 and there were still people in the
[10:42] congregation 27 or 28 years later that
[10:45] raising their hands remembering when the
[10:47] prophecies were given so to me that's
[10:49] another proof that the prophecies from
[10:51] 1933 were genuine they were given by the
[10:53] Holy Ghost to brother brandom and he was
[10:55] faithful to prophesy
[10:57] them lastly we'll look at earli
[10:59] recordings of the seven major Visions
[11:01] now the first time that I can find that
[11:02] brother Brandon mentions parts of the
[11:04] seven major Visions is in March 1953
[11:08] Israel and the church Part Two Brother R
[11:10] says there'll be three great isms
[11:12] communism Fascism and Nazism they'll
[11:15] wind up in one ISM then he talks about
[11:17] automobiles they'll look like an egg and
[11:20] that's the way they'll be just before
[11:22] the Rapture so if anyone listening has
[11:24] an earlier audio recording I'd love to
[11:27] hear that perhaps I can make a part two
[11:28] on this so let's listen to the quote by
[11:30] God's grace now I said there will be
[11:32] three great is is isms communism
[11:37] fascism and um Nazism I said they'll
[11:41] wind up in one ISM and that one ISM will
[11:45] dominate the world and will burn the
[11:47] Vatican City you remember me saying that
[11:50] years and years and years ago and just
[11:54] exactly that way I said just before that
[11:57] time comes that are automobiles which is
[11:59] built that old straight back 20 years
[12:00] ago 25 years ago you can remember 20
[12:02] years anyhow I said they'll look like an
[12:05] egg they'll be shaped that's a
[12:08] vision be something on to shape
[12:10] something like
[12:12] that and that's the way they'll be just
[12:15] before the
[12:16] Rapture next the first quote I found
[12:19] where he mentions seven major Visions
[12:21] was in January 1961 in Phoenix Arizona
[12:24] in the sermon why brother brand said
[12:27] seven things I saw five of them has
[12:28] already come to pass so again this is
[12:31] the first time that I found brother Rand
[12:32] mentioned seven Visions in particular
[12:35] and this also brings out the point that
[12:37] as brother R was trying to remember
[12:39] everything about the major Visions
[12:41] perhaps he had progressive revelation
[12:43] and eventually learned there was seven
[12:44] total visions and to me that seems very
[12:47] likely because brother Braham lived a
[12:48] lot of his life in Visions so we have to
[12:51] consider that a man a prophet of God
[12:52] seeing so many Visions every day week
[12:55] after week month after month year after
[12:57] year decade after decade it would take
[12:59] the Holy Spirit to bring all the details
[13:02] about seven major Visions to his
[13:04] remembrance and perhaps he grew in
[13:05] progressive revelation as far as
[13:07] understanding the exact number of
[13:09] visions that he had there in 1933 let's
[13:11] listen to the quote so that seems the
[13:15] time of of the end coming and five
[13:19] things that the Lord let seven things I
[13:22] saw five of has already come to pass I
[13:25] see a powerful woman stand up in the
[13:27] United States you can write this down if
[13:28] you so this going to happen I don't know
[13:31] she's on the road now exactly and she
[13:34] took over and then I seen in the United
[13:36] States just like something burned over
[13:39] hit it just STP blow up
[13:42] rocks in closing friends I hope this
[13:46] video was a blessing by the grace of God
[13:47] this is an excellent question so I hope
[13:49] this satisfies the person who asked this
[13:52] question in the comments this is a
[13:54] wonderful topic to study the Prophecies
[13:56] of a modern-day Prophet a genuine
[13:58] prophet of God the late brother William
[14:00] Marin brandham I look forward to getting
[14:02] your comments or questions or additional
[14:04] quotes in the comment section perhaps
[14:07] that'll be enough to make a part two on
[14:09] this topic by the grace of God friends
[14:11] we're living in exciting times we're
[14:13] seeing scripture fulfilled about Israel
[14:15] we're seeing the open book taken around
[14:17] the world according to Revelation 10
[14:19] 8-11 Jesus said this gospel must be
[14:21] preached to Every Nation then the end
[14:23] will come we're seeing things change
[14:25] here in the United States by the grace
[14:26] of God so we're admonished by the Lord
[14:29] Jesus Christ to watch and pray and
[14:31] always look up for our Redemption
[14:33] draweth nigh no man knows the day or the
[14:35] hour but certainly know the season of
[14:37] The Rapture according to 1 Thessalonians
[14:39] chapter 5 verse one said but of the
[14:41] times and the seasons Brethren you have
[14:43] no need that I write unto you for
[14:45] yourselves know perfectly that the day
[14:46] the Lord so cometh as a thief in the
[14:49] night so Paul tells us we'll know the
[14:51] season the season will be at a time when
[14:53] the world is not looking for the Rapture
[14:56] but as 1 Thessalonians 5 goes on to say
[14:58] we are are children of the light we will
[15:00] not be caught in darkness we'll see
[15:02] everything we'll see all the prophetic
[15:04] events the light of the Gospel Jesus
[15:07] Christ the light of Prophecy being
[15:09] fulfilled we'll see it happening we
[15:12] won't be asleep and we'll be ready for
[15:13] the coming of the Lord and 1
[15:16] Thessalonians 5:9 is such a great
[15:18] consolation for us for God hath not
[15:20] appointed us to wrath we will not go
[15:22] through the tribulation period but to
[15:24] obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus
[15:27] Christ if you have any question
[15:29] questions concerns or testimonies about
[15:30] this video please contact
[15:32] me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[15:35] the desire of your heart
