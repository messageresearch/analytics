TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I want to ask the church one more thing before we get someplace to study the scriptures that is that you'll pray for me I've develop a critical spirit and it haunts at me I told my wife yesterday the first time something happened out I sitting in the yard I told her she'd reminded me and I told her about it I said honey I've got to a place to I become critical of people I don't want to be who whose job is it it's not my the gods want to criticize not me there's a woman went over there I miss Dow I don't know where they ever heard of or not oh such a disgrace it was in India that's the reason we couldn't even have her meetings in the open air she got over there and tried to take offerings from them people and and and because they wouldn't give their little rupees a poor little woman has got a job packing Marty on top of her head up steps and things like that from 5:00 to 10:00 gets a rupee a day at 21 cents thing she has to work hard to keep that job a woman weigh in mud to their knees and so forth poor little old thing take care of her little babies and so forth a rupee 21 cents and they're fussing with them people and taking those rupes and turn them back into America money and they said you come to take what we got not to help us see you people they didn't have to give me a penny to go over come back pay my expenses pay all the auditorium rents all the hotel bills everything and then everything I had left I tuck it on the street not to give it some Society I took it out and give it to the poor little people that starving to death that's where your money that's where money best of my knowledge I could do it myself I only wish I'd had more to do it with now but my my my brother sister this woman started taking up offerings and fussing at him they said you come to take what we got not to help us I thought you come to help us she's supposed to be a Divine healer she's anger is mean when it's over in the west coast Howard she said I want to see your daddy she married some man from down there in Egypt or something she said I'm going to India to he said well Madam when that anointing is on him we the people just don't come around said she said you tell him that I'm Mrs D and said when I'm going to India before him I'll have the situation under control time he gets there said my meanings is greater than he ever had anyhow well that's true might beeny I don't know but the thing she had it under control to a place you couldn't even have a meeting in the open air that's what it was and they they started her out and she stood there and said you black Devils you said I like that and they try to get her get out and she wouldn't do it and somebody hit her on her head with a brick and they packed her out so they then they rared her out of the country she went out into another country there and baron bronberg had to go down and see the king and things get her out there keep from a massacre so then uh so they there it was and I look at that and I criticize that I come back and I first thing is place in my hands with a voice of healing I've seen that they Allen's meeting and seen how unscriptural that is then I criticize it you see oh my I think but look at the poor people lovely peoples out there following that see going with him and honest hearted people I look around see these other things as goes on and in that I I start criticizing in my heart see and I don't want to get that way if I do that I'll lose favor with God see and the only thing I look at the Americans and see the way look at women how they dress and look at man how they act and how they drink and cuss and smoke and chew and claim to be Christians till they just notates me when I see what the other side is and see this and then look between think oh God but here list whose battle is it God said let the weeds and the wheat grow together the Angels would come and separate him at the end of time it's not me so you help me as I stand here my hand up at the P pit help me to criticize nobody and help me that God will give me his spirit in my heart that instead of criticizing that I'll love him anyhow and go on it's just been a constant grind and a grind and a grind tell Miss human my mental powers are breaking like that you see and I've got to get away for some rest and that's what I'm going away far to stay by myself to pray that God will take that critical feeling away from me and mellow me down now I can go and act like it but that wouldn't come from my heart I'd be a hypocrite then sure enough see I want it to come from my heart I really have love for those who are not Lov me that's Jesus did when I was critical when I need to be criticized still he still loves me anyhow so that's way I want to be you pray for me now I pray that you'll help me take the critical spirit from my ser Lord God I don't want to if the man are wrong you be the judge Lord let me just love anyhow will you father if the women misdress and misuse themselves and become prostitutes in our nation sinks how can I change history when you've spoke it Lord but I pray that you'll just help me and let me be loving and kind that I can be your servant and do your will these things I ask father For Your Glory now bless us as they' been asked to teach the word a little father just give us a little short message now that the word may go forth that it'll be a great day for us we ask it in Jesus name amen
