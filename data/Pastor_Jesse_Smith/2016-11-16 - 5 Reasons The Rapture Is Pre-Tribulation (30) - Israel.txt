TRANSCRIPT
========================================
greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to give a brief summary of the five reasons why the Rapture is pre-tribulation let's jump right into it reason number one the tribulation period is trouble for Israel the foolish virgin and sinners but not for the Bride of Jesus Christ the following scriptures teach this truth Daniel 121 and at that time shall Michael stand up the great Prince which standeth for the children of thy people and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time and at that time thy people shall be delivered everyone that shall be found written in the book the tribulation period is a time of trouble and also is a purging time for Daniel's people thy People Israel which is why it is also called Jacob's trouble in Jeremiah 30: 7 the New Testament Holy Ghost filled bride does not need purged in the tribulation period because she is already forgiven and washed in the blood of Jesus Christ clean through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost the blood-washed church is already Washed by the Water of Christ's word and is Holy and without blemish in the sight of her husband Jesus Christ the foolish virgins or Christians without the baptism of the Holy Ghost will experiened the trouble of the Great Tribulation as two of Jesus's Parables taught that they would be locked out of the marriage despite living virgin or pure lives because they had no oil or the Holy Ghost baptism Jesus also taught those without the wedding garment or clothing of the Holy Ghost baptism would be cast into outer Darkness with weeping and nashing of teeth the tribulation and battle of Armageddon are God's execution of judgment upon all of the Sinners the ungodly with their ungodly deeds and hard speeches they have spoken against Jesus Christ according to Jude 1: 14 and 15 reason number two there is no mention of the Bride or true church in the tribulation text of the Book of Revelation the word church appears 19 times in Revelation but is absent from chapter 3 22 to chapter 22:16 the true church is not mentioned in chapter 8 during the first four trumpets nor in Revelation 9 in the fifth and sixth trumpets and first woe that passes when the second woe passes in Revelation 11 the bride is not mentioned during the final Harvest of the 144,000 Israeli Believers in Revelation 14 there is again no mention of the bride of Christ nor is she mentioned in Revelation chapters 15 and 16 when the seven last plagues and seven vials are poured out upon the Earth the reason the bride of Christ is not mentioned in the tribulation text in the Book of Revelation is because she will be with Jesus Christ during the Great marriage supper of the lamb in heaven and will not have to endure the tribulation period or time of trouble taking place upon the Earth Christ will Rapture his bride at the end of the leoan church age spoken of in Revelation 3: 14-22 and the next time she is seen is when she returns to the Earth from heaven with Jesus Christ for the battle of Armageddon in Revelation 19: 5 to 21 which takes place at the end of the tribulation period reason number three the bride or true church is Promised a pardon from God's Divine wrath the following scriptures teach this truth 1 Thessalonians 1:10 and to wait for his son from Heaven whom he raised from the dead even Jesus which delivered us from the Wrath to come Romans 5:9 much more then being now justified by his blood shall we be saved from wrath through him 1 Thessalonians 5 verses 4 and9 but ye Brethren are not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a thief for God hath not appointed us to wrath but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ reev gelation 3:10 because thou has kept the word of my patience I also will keep thee from the hour of Temptation which shall come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the Earth Psalms 27:5 for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me for he shall set me up upon a rock Luke 21: 26 watch ye therefore and pray always that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass and to stand before the son of man remember that the Book of Revelation wrath scriptures pertain nothing to the Bride of Jesus Christ as she is not mentioned in any of these texts in Revelation 6: 16 and 17 during The Sixth Seal or tribulation seal the great day of God's Wrath comes upon the Earth in Revelation 11:18 the bride is not not mentioned after God's two prophets to Israel Minister for three and A2 years which is the final half week of Daniel's 70 weeks and is the time the wrath of God comes upon the Earth the bride is not mentioned in Revelation 12:12 when the inhabitants of the earth must endure Satan's great wrath because he knows he has a short time before his judgment in Revelation 14: 810 and 19 the bride is not mentioned when all nations will drink of the wrath of God because they worshiped the beast's image and received his Mark and we are taught that all holy ghost filled Saints would not take the mark of the beast in Revelation 20:4 in Revelation 15: 1 and 7 the bride is not mentioned when the seven last plagues were filled up with the wrath of God in Revelation 16:1 the vows of the wrath of God were poured out upon the Earth and there is no mention of the bride of Christ furthermore Jesus's teaching about his second coming contained a pattern of the righteous Believers escaping wrath in Luke 17: 26-37 and Matthew 24: 36-42 Jesus described the world's conditions at the time of his second coming the conditions would be twofold first as the days of lot and second as the days of Noah in both time periods the True Believers escaped the wrath of God in the days of lot when Sodom and gomor were destroyed by fire and brimstone Abraham and his group were safe from harm and did not endure the wrath of God while lot was scarcely saved in the days of Noah Enoch was raptured well before the worldwide flood while Noah and his family were scarcely saved from the floods destruction praise the Lord that the Bride of Jesus Christ is passed from Death unto life and will be kept from the wrath of God reason number four Jesus thought the Rapture was imminent and unknown as an approaching Thief while other views such as the mid-tribulation or post-tribulation view can be numbered or counted the following scriptures teach this truth Jesus teaches an unknown day and hour for the Rapture in Matthew 2513 and Matthew 24:36 watch therefore for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the son of man cometh but of that day and hour knoweth no man no not the angels of heaven but my father only Jesus Christ comes as a thief to catch away or seize away or snatch away his wife the Bride of Jesus Christ this means the Rapture is a sudden secret snatching away of the true bride of Christ Matthew 24:43 but know this that if the good man of the house had known in what watch the thief would come he would have watched and would have not suffered his house to be broken up therefore be also ready for in such an hour as you think not the son of man cometh 1 Thessalonians 5:2 for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night but ye Brethren are not in darkness that the day should overtake you as a thief remember therefore how thou Hast received and heard and hold fast and repent if thou therefore shalt not watch I will come on thee as a thief and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee so we firmly believe the Rapture is imminent with an unknown day and hour and takes place before the tribulation other views and timelines of the Rapture such as mid-tribulation or post-tribulation can be numbered or counted meaning that Believers could potentially know the literal day when Christ May return because they contain either three and a half or 7 years which is based upon the 70 weeks of Daniel prophecy spoken of in Daniel chapter 9 9: 24- 27 and fulfilled by the 3 and 1/2 year Ministry of the two witnesses of Revelation 11: 3-13 the pre-tribulation Rapture is the only teaching that allows Christ to return at an unknown day and hour before the worldwide tribulation reason number five the Rapture is the removal of the grace of God for the Gentiles in preparation for the revelation of the Antichrist and God's return to the Jewish people the following scriptures teach this truth Luke 21:24 Romans 11: 23-26 2 Thessalonians 2: 3-2 and Genesis 63 right now we are living in the times of the Gentiles according to Luke 21:24 for God has blinded Israel from recognizing Christ as the Messiah according to Romans 11:25 the Gentiles are receiving the grace of God and our Lord Jesus Christ through the powerful Ministry of the Holy Ghost but the end of this period of Grace will soon end and then God will remove his holy ghost from the Gentiles and return to the Jews before God removes his grace from the Gentiles he will Rapture his Gentile bride after the Rapture he will first return to and be received by his people Israel before he pours out his wrath upon the rest of the world the Antichrist cannot work upon the Earth until after the Bride of Jesus Christ is raptured Off the Earth in 2 Thessalonians 2: 3-6 give a great descript destion of the Antichrist verse 7 is very important for understanding the timing of the Antichrist 2 Thessalonians 2:7 for the mystery of iniquity doth already work only he referring to God who now leth will let until he which is the holy ghost or Christ spirit in the Believers be taken out of the way in verse eight we find an important scripture and then shall that Wicked be revealed whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming so we can clearly see that the Antichrist is not revealed until the True Believers are taken out of the way just as in the days of Noah God will eventually end his long suffering upon the disobedient and remove his grace from the earth Divine wrath is all that is left for those who did not love the truth of the Holy Bible Genesis 6:3 and the Lord said my spirit shall not always strive with man for that he also is flesh yet his day shall be 120 years if you would like more Bible teaching about how the Rapture is pre-tribulation please contact us God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
