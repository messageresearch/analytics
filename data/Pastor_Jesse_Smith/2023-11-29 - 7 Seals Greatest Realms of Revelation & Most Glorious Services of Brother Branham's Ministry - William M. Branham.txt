TRANSCRIPT
========================================
of all the times that I've been behind the pull pit at the Tabernacle I have never never in any time of my Ministry ever worked into the Realms of God and the spiritual Realms has been this time beyond anything I ever did in any time of my Ministry in any meeting at anywhere like this mostly it's on healing this is revealing of Truth by The Same Spirit Same Spirit I'd like to to add this that of all the services I've ever had in my life I believe this week has been the most glorious time of all my life in Services no matter what I have I've seen great Miracles performed of course before in healing services but this is beyond that that's been one of the great times highlights of my life is to be here and seeing the little Tabernacle take on this different look not only that but the inside take on a different Lo Hallelujah this has been a tremendous week for me I'm tired my mind is tired because I I have was the best that I could do and something strange going on every day I would be amazed to walk in the room and be there for a few minutes and see something just turn me completely around and here I go in there I pick up the notes I pick up books of Dr Smith you're a Smith and all all the writers and and read in read down in their books I say now here's the Sixth Seal here's the fourth seal now what does this man say he'd say what was this that I look over here and get another man he said it was such and such and it looked like it just it just didn't work right and I thought well what is it Lord I walk up and down the floor a while I kneel down and pray go back and pick up the Bible sit down read walk back and forth then all of a sudden when I got quiet they just unfolded like that then I grab a pen right quick go to write it down like that whatever I was seeing and doing watching it like that to got it roll down then I take the rest of the day go down and chase this out and see if it tied all the way down through the scriptures then it prove all things I got this year and I think now there's many people had Visions there's many been Revelations if it's contrary to the word leave it alone that's right leave it alone now now then I run this e down like this run it down like I jot down little things I thought well the class will be glad to hear this because it ties here ties here I let's see what does this say here yes it yeah here it is right here see bring it back through the Bible and tie the thing down through the week there his own tapes you're welcome to them and I have did it to the best of my knowledge under Christian Fellowship grace of God to all Man by Jesus Christ I've done the very best that I I know how you've been one of the finest classes there's been nobody could have said any nicer you all have come in here at 1:00 in the day up till 5:00 to whenever they opened the church and brought the let the people come in you stood in the cold you set in the snow you've done everything stood around the wall your legs ACH i' see the men sit down let the women sit up in different ones and stand like that sitting around I thought Lord this been a mysterious week the whole thing been kind of strange how would people come see them stand around the outside in the windows in the doors back around the back everywhere listening and as far as a speaker I'm far from a speaker I I got that much intelligence to know that I'm not but I'm not a speaker but why would people sit and listen like that why would they do it they don't come to hear a person like me but they're coming because there's something in it drawing a people see there's something in it that's dra this
