TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] a harlot or [Music] in Revelation 17: 1 15 and 16 this church is called a great [Music] the Greek word for is the same word for Harlot both mean a woman that yields herself to defilement for the sake of gain metaphorically and idolatrous speaks of Babylon I.E Rome the chief seat of idolatry in Revelation 17:5 this church is called the mother of harlots and Abominations from these scriptures we see that the Roman Catholic Church as an Unfaithful woman or church has yielded herself to defilement for the sake of gain she has been untrue to her Lord and his Bible and has become the chief seat of idolatry through the worship or veneration of statues and images but the True Church of Christ is married to Christ in Romans 7:4 and therefore will not add or take away from the Bible according to Revelation 22: 18 and 19 but this false Church Church the Roman Catholic Church claims to be the Church of Christ or married to Christ but is unfaithful to her husband and the Bible and receives and spreads false doctrines in order to get monetary gain the Roman Catholic Church is a harlot because she has received the seeds or false teachings of the devil and shared those lies with peoples from nearly every nation Revelation 17:2 and 18:3 said she committed fornication with the kings of the Earth the Roman Catholic church has shared her love with Kings and Nations pleasing governments and people rather than pleasing her husband Christ the [Music] word here is a very brief list of the false seed or false Doctrine the Roman Catholic church has received from evil spirits and then has shared and spread all over the world with Kings and Nations and multitudes and peoples mandatory clerical celibacy the Roman Catholic Church forces all priests to be [Music] celibate which contradicts the Bible truth that even St Peter was married whom they claimed to be their first pope although we know he wasn't the Bible plainly teaches that Jesus healed Peter's mother-in-law in Matthew 8: 14 and 15 St Paul the celibate prophet of God even taught that St Peter was married in 1 Corinthians 9:5 St Paul also wrote that seducing spirits and doctrines of devils teach that marriage should be forbidden in 1 Timothy 4: 1-3 transubstantiation this false Doctrine teaches that the Bread and Wine are changed into substance and not appearance into the literal body and blood of Jesus the change by which the substance the not the appearance of Bread and Wine in the Eucharist becomes Christ's real presence that is his body and blood this is a gross false teaching as the Bible teaches that our communion today is not with the literal blood and Body of Christ but with the Holy Ghost in 2 Corinthians 13:14 The Bread and Wine are just symbols of the body and blood of the Lord Jesus and not the literal body and blood St Paul taught that we do not know Jesus after the Flesh and blood anymore in 2 Corinthians 5:16 the catechism of the Catholic Church teaches that the literal presence of Jesus exists in those bodies of those who partake of their communion as long as the bread and wine is able to subsist in their system which would be only around 6 to 8 hours or so but the Bible teaches that the communion with the Holy Ghost the presence of the Holy Spirit as the Seal of God lasts until the day of our redemption in Ephesians 4:30 in our souls the Roman Catholic Church believes the presence of Christ is the Eucharist but the True Church of Christ believes the Holy Ghost is the presence of Christ in our midst transubstantiation is another form of idolatry which again breaks the first commandment the Holy Father the Pope the word Pope means father in the Greek Jesus specifically taught that we should call no man father in Matthew 23:9 the Bible never created an office of a pope the New Testament preaching offices are Apostle Prophet teacher pastor and evangelist according to Ephesians 4:1 the pope is also called Holy Father which is absolute heresy and man worship as the only time the title Holy Father was used in the Bible was when Jesus prayed to his father God Almighty and called him Holy Father in John 17:1 the pope is receiving worship and being called a title that was alone meant for God himself again breaking the first commandment kissing a Pope's hand or bowing to a pope or priest it is common to see people kissing the Pope's hand and even bowing to him the Bible teaches that we are not to bow to Any Man In Worship or kiss any man's hand this is man worship and breaks the first commandment veneration of statues and images pertaining to images the CCC states that the seventh ecumenical council at NAA in 1787 Justified the veneration of images of Christ the mother of God angels and all the saints while this Council may have Justified the veneration of images and statues the Bible never did Catholics worldwide Bow Down to images kiss them rub them weep on them and further exalt them in a way that God never commanded towards any image or man-made statue those behaviors like bowing kissing rubbing weeping all break the first commandment about having no other gods and making no graven image unto any likeness that is in heaven on the earth or in the water without a doubt due to the veneration of statues and images the spirit of idolatry lives in the Roman Catholic Church communion of the Saints the Roman Catholic Church teaches that there can be an exchange of spiritual goods between the disciples currently on Earth and those that are in heaven or in glory these exchanges are done through prayers to saints that have already died nowhere in scripture can we find Jesus teaching us to pray two and four believers who have already died and left the Earth so we conclude that praying to anyone other than God is a form of spiritualism and should should not be taught for if the living saints of God are not being contacted then it would mean that the evil spirits were being contacted by those misguided prayers the CCC teaches it is a holy and a wholesome thought to pray for the dead that they may be loose from their sins our prayer for them is capable not only of helping them but also of making their intercession for us effective but in Luke 16: 25 and 26 Jesus taught that there is no passing between the places of comfort and torment after death so it is a vain act to pray for anyone who already died for we cannot loose the dead from their sins the Bible never tells us to pray to anyone other than God for the Lord Jesus taught us to pray our father in Matthew 6:9 Psalms 5:3 says my voice shalt thou hear in the morning oh Lord in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee and will look up Psalm 65:2 says oh thou that hearest prayer unto thee shall All Flesh come the CCC specifically teaches to pray to Mary by asking Mary to pray for us we acknowledge ourselves to be poor Sinners and we address ourselves to the Mother of Mercy Mother of God to whose protection that faithful fly in all their dangers and needs but the Bible teaches that Jesus alone is able to save us with his intercession Hebrews 7:25 wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them the worship of the Virgin Mary the CCC truly deifies Mary the mother of Jesus which is another form of idolatry the CCC states that Mary is the all holy one and was preserved free from all stain of original sin only Jesus was without sin according to Hebrews 4:15 and Romans 3:23 says that all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God in Revelation 5: 1-5 only Jesus was found worthy to open the book and to loose the Seven Seals no man or woman was found in heaven or Earth who was worthy not Mary only the Lord Jesus the CCC exalts Mary above God for she is given the titles Mother of God and queen over all things she is also said to have a saving office and by her manifold intercession continues to bring us the gifts of Eternal salvation she is to be invoked under the titles of advocate Helper benefactress and mediatrix God is the only savior there is no scripture for Mary saving anyone at any time or any place Isaiah 43:1 I even I I am the Lord and beside me there is no savior in Hebrews 7:3 mzc was God in the form of a man acting as a human priest to Abraham and was described as being without father without mother without descent having neither beginning of days nor end of life the revelation of this hour tells us that MDC was God in flesh so God has no mother yet the Roman Catholic Church exalts Mary to this false position as Mother of God triple blasphemy a powerful Revelation that came to us through the prophetic Ministry of God's Prophet William brandham was that of Revelation 13: 6 the scripture says that the Beast which we will soon see is the spirit of Rome blasphemed God and His word in three different ways they blasphemed God's name his Tabernacle and them that dwell in heaven Rome has blasphemed God's name which is the Lord Jesus Christ and changed it to the Holy Trinity with the titles Father Son and Holy Ghost the Bible teaches that the name of Jesus Christ is the name above all names according to Philippians 2: 9-1 and that the entire family of God in heaven and in Earth is named the Lord Jesus Christ according to Ephesians 4:14 and5 secondly Rome has blasphemed God's Heavenly Tabernacle by calling itself the Eternal City and decking the Vatican with Priceless artwork gold and precious valuables the New Jerusalem is the true Eternal City that is coming to Earth from heaven and God is the Builder and maker of that glorious City according to Revelation 21 and 22 lastly Rome has blasing the saints that dwell in Heaven by teaching its followers to pray to them rather than to God himself which is is called the communion of saints as we discussed earlier Jesus Christ is the only mediator between God and man and Jesus never taught anyone to pray to Mary or any other believer [Music]
