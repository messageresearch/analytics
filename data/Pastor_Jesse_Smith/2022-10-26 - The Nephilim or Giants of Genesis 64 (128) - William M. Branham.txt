TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] foreign friends in the mattress name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to answer the question who were the Nephilim or Giants of Genesis chapter 6 verse 4 and numbers 13 verse 33. there are numerous theories as to the identity of the Giants or Nephilim but only one view is correct God's word plainly validates the one correct identity of the Nephilim and the Holy Spirit Led God's Prophet brother William Branham to repeatedly teach the truth about this subject now this subject is not a major it's a minor because it's not related to Salvation in summary the Giants or Nephilim of Genesis 6 verse 4 were simply the sinful human offspring of Cain who was the son of The Serpent and Eve Kane was not the son of Adam as First John 3 verse 12 States these Giants were not half angel half-human as some erroneously believe therefore the Giants or Nephilim of Genesis 6 verse 4 were a result of the giant-like DNA traits being expressed in their bodies about 2500 Years BC according to Usher's timeline or about 200 years before the flood in Noah's day and then about a thousand years after these Giants are recorded in Genesis 6 verse 4 more Giants showed up after the flood both in Moses day and David's time around 1500 BC and 1000 BC respectively here's the outline for the video first we'll look at the Bible origin of the word Nephilim second we'll give the true interpretation of Nephilim third we'll look at the false interpretation of the Nephilim and lastly we'll look at understanding sons of God and the fact there is no pre-existence of Souls Bible origin of the word Nephilim the Hebrew word for Giants in Genesis 6 verse 4 is Nephilim this is according to the Hebrew lexicon Strong's number 5303 this Hebrew word is used only twice in the Old Testament and the second occurrence is in numbers 13 Verse 33 which says and there we saw the Giants the sons of anec which come of the Giants and we were in our own sight as Grasshoppers and so we were in their sight now the sons of anak according to Easton's Bible dictionary were the descendants of anak spoken of in Joshua 11 verse 21 numbers 13 33 and Deuteronomy 9 verse 2. they were probably a remnant of the original inhabitants of Palestine before the Canaanites a cushite tribe from Babel and of the same race as the Phoenicians and the Egyptian Shepherd Kings it's notable that the Philistine Giants whom David encountered in second Samuel 21 were descendants of the Anakin now friends it's also notable that the word giant is used 19 times in the Old Testament in the King James version but recall that only two of those uses are the word Nephilim but it's clear there were giants Before the Flood and after the flood one notable example is Deuteronomy 3 verse 11 it speaks of OG king of beishan he said he was remained of the remnant of giants he had a bed of iron which was nine cubits of length thereof which turns out to be about 13 and a half feet so of course he was probably a little shorter than 13 and a half feet perhaps 12 feet and so it's likely OGG was even taller than Goliath who was about nine and a half or ten feet the true interpretation of the Nephilim the Giants or Nephilim of Genesis 6 verse 4 were simply the human offspring of Cain who was the son of The Serpent and Eve Kane was not the son of Adam as First John 3 verse 12 States because Adam was not the wicked one the Bible said Cain was of that Wicked one that Wicked one would have been the serpent who was possessed by Satan in the Garden of Eden this means Cain's genetic makeup was a perverted mixture of human genetics and Beast genetics since his father was the serpent a beast the serpent seed teaching that God originated in Genesis 3 verse 15. in which God himself told the serpent that he had offspring proves the original serpent in creation who was in the Garden of Eden had DNA that could and did mix with Eve's human DNA Satan possessed the Serpent's body and deceived the serpent into deceiving Eve note that Satan was not the father of Cain because Satan is a spirit and a spirit cannot procreate with a human for the nine Bible proofs that the serpent seed teaching is correct see my two-part video series on YouTube about the serpent seed or see chapter 10 of my 2021 book The 12 New Testament Mysteries revealed in the chapter about the mystery of iniquity where do the Giants of Genesis chapter 6 verse 4 come from the Giants or Nephilim were a result of the giant-like DNA traits being expressed in their bodies about 2535 Years BC according to Usher's timeline so we see there were giants Before the Flood now the only logical explanation of how the giant DNA made it through the flood is that either Noah or one of his sons or Noah and all of his sons married Daughters of men or Daughters of Cain's lineage and as a result of those marriages all the DNA was mixed All The Offspring of humanity that came out of Noah's family had this DNA that contained the ability to create offspring that were giants because cane seed or the serpent seed had intermingled and made it through the flood through Noah and his son's marriages a person's natural seed is not what is important anymore like it was at the beginning in the New Testament the most important seed is the spiritual seed according to First Peter 1 verse 23. being born again not of corruptable seed but of The Incorruptible by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever we no longer have to be concerned about the physical seed line we were born under because all human seed is corruptable it is our privilege and High Calling of God to seek the spiritual seed or the baptism of the Holy Ghost which is offered to all men although we know all men will not receive it the spirit and the bride say come that whosoever will come and drink of the Waters of Life freely so A Thousand Years After the flood you have Giants showing up in the days of Moses Joshua and then 1500 Years After the flood you have giant still in the days of David God's Vindicated Prophet brother William Branham repeatedly taught these truths here's one quotation from Brother Branham about this subject in 1964 and he plainly states that the Giants were simply offspring of Cain's lineage because he was of the Serpent's Seed let's listen to the quote and Genesis 6 4 and to the flood where did the Giants come from that's a good one very good question where do these Giants come from Adam wasn't a giant as far as we know plus what the Bible has said so he was just an ordinary man where did they come from now uh this is a great dispute and this was just handed to me it's on a big dark paper and it's uh our big dark letters on white piece of paper now these Giants I believe it was one of somebody you're not long it might have been Josephus I'm not I'm not saying that now Minister brothers that it was you'll see if that's what it seems to me like that it might have been him or Dr Scofield or some of them that said that these Giants that was in the land were actually Fallen spirits of God that listened to to Satan's tale uh and he told in the uh around in heaven and it was Michael trying to raise a war with my friend heaven was kicked out that these sons of God saw the daughters the man and of these Giants was in the land at that time that they pressed themselves into human flesh if you do that you make Satan a creator you can't do it so the Giants never come from pressing themselves in these Giants were the sons of Cain whose father was the serpent who looked in every respected exactly like a man but was a great huge fellow bigger than a man and that's where those Sons came from because they were the sons of King because they were Canaanites in the land of Canaan where they come from and that's where Cain went to and that was that also proves the Serpent's Seed it was a different race of people all together that was serpent seeds see ah that serpency questions in here so we're gonna get to it and I want you to bear this democracy now just to give us background see they were they were Canaanites these Giants and they were the sons of Cain which was the son of the serpent and the serpent was a giant man great monster sort of a fella not a reptile at all beautiful is the most subtle of all the beasts to the field then friends of course After the flood the genetic traits of giants made it through the flood as one of Noah's daughters-in-laws had to have been of the serpent seed or perhaps know his wife or perhaps know his wife and all of Noah's daughters-in-law so numbers 13 verse 35 speaks of the Giants of anec and then second Samuel 21 verse 22 says there were four Sons born of the giant in gath and they fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants one more point about Genesis 6 verse 4 is that there are three groups of people mentioned which few people seem to understand the first group is the Giants or Nephilim in the first part of the verse but then in the second part of the verse two more groups of people are mentioned the second group is the sons of God which are The Godly seed of Seth these sons of God sinned against God by marrying sinful woman which are called the daughters of men their children then became sinful intellectual Believers as the Bible says when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men and they bear children to them the same became Mighty Men which were of old men of renown so the result of Believers the sithites marrying unbelievers the daughters of men were unbelieving intellectuals this intermarrying among Believers and unbelievers is one reason God became grieved with the antaluvian world and destroyed it with the flood as Genesis 6 verses 5 through 7 teach God saw the wickedness of man it was great in the earth and every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth and agreed him at his heart and the Lord said I will destroy man whom I've created from the face of the Earth the false interpretation the most popular false interpretation of the Nephilim are giants is that they were the result of Fallen Angels or demons having sexual relations with women this belief claims either one Fallen Angels or demons can take on flesh by their own choosing or two fallen angels in their spiritual bodies somehow impregnated women both claims are undeniably false first Fallen Angels or demons cannot take on flesh bodies by their own choosing there is not one Bible example of Fallen Angels or demons being able to take on or put on flesh bodies at their own choosing and then go and procreate and reproduce themselves it is true that Fallen Angels or demons can possess human bodies and Minds to different degrees but those possessions take place only when a human opens up his mind to the Demon's influence this type of possession happens constantly and has been happening since Satan influenced Eve's mind to partake of the fruit of adultery in Genesis chapter 3. a few verses that are often misunderstood by those who hold this false view are Genesis chapters 18 19 and Hebrews 13 verse 2 among other numerous examples in Genesis 18 and 19 God comes to Abraham in a flesh body along with two angels that have flesh bodies and all three eat meat butter and milk prepared by Sarah as Genesis 18 verse 8 says Hebrews 13 verse 2 says these appearances were Holy Angels Take on flesh bodies can still happen today be not forgetful to entertain strangers for thereby some have entertained angels unawares but in both of these cases God was the one who had the Holy Angels and himself put on flesh bodies and they did not procreate they simply minister to the needs of the Believers which agrees with Hebrews 1 verses 13 and 14. but to which the Angels said he at any time sit on my right hand until I make thine enemies thy footstool are they not all ministering Spirits sent forth to minister for them who shall be Heirs of salvation so the conclusion is obvious God is the only one who has the power to put a flesh body on himself or flesh bodies on angels and he only did this with Holy Angels and he never did this with fallen angels he never did it to procreate he did it to minister to Abraham and Sarah and also lot Satan and his fallen angels can transform themselves as angels of light According to second Corinthians 11 verse 14 and they can possess human beings but they cannot take on flesh bodies by their own power for that power is reserved by God for himself to use alone God does not give that power to Satan or the Fallen Angels secondly fallen angels in their own spiritual bodies cannot impregnate women in flesh bodies God's unchanging law of reproduction in Genesis 1 verses 11 and 12. state that a seed can only bring forth of its own kind also the Bible never says angels have children Jesus plainly teaches Angels do not procreate or have children as the Bible never speaks of female angels only male and Jesus said this in Matthew 22 verse 30. for in the resurrection they neither marry nor given a marriage but are as the angels of God in heaven before moving on the reason the false interpretation of the Nephilim is believed by so many is because it is close to the truth but also very far from the truth the aspect of the Nephilim false interpretation that is so close to the truth is a fallen angel Satan did possess a body and use that body to procreate which was when Satan possessed the beastly body of the serpent in Genesis chapter 3 in order to produce Cain through Eve's adulterous act with the serpent but Satan did not create his own body to produce the serpent seat he simply possessed the serpent body that God had already created Satan is not a Creator God Alone is a creator again the reason this false interpretation is so close is because fallen angels can possess human bodies but not bodies they create demons cannot press themselves into a flesh body or change their state from a spiritual body to a flesh body while it's true Holy Angels can be clothed in flesh bodies for a short time period and appear as men as the two angels that visited lot and the angel that wrestled with Jacob prove this is a power God reserves to himself alone and uses it only with Holy Angels so they can minister to The Heirs of salvation like Abraham and Sarah lot and Jacob just as a few examples the lie that is so wrong and so far from the truth in this false interpretation is that Fallen demons in their spiritual bodies can procreate with human women which is wrong for two reasons first Fallen Angels or demons do not have the power to change their bodies from spiritual or celestial bodies into human bodies or flesh bodies in order to procreate and second as stated earlier Jesus plainly teaches Angels do not marry like brother random said if you believe Fallen Angels changed their being from spiritual to flesh then you have made Fallen Angels equal to God but God repeatedly says he alone is the Creator and has no equal Isaiah 44 24 says I am the Lord that maketh all things that spread forth the heavens alone that spreadth the bra of the Earth by myself Isaiah 40 verses 25 and 26 says to whom then will you liken me or shall I be equal saith the Holy One behold who hath created these things he called them all by names by the greatness of his might for that he is strong in power not one faileth in Isaiah 46 verse 5 to whom will you liken me and make me equal and compare me that we may be like understanding sons of God and the truth there is no pre-existence of Souls some Believers misunderstand the phrase sons of God in Genesis chapter 6 verse 4 and also in Job 1 verse 6 and Job 38 verse 7 among other places the phrase sons of God can refer to Heavenly Angels or human Believers in the one true God Jehovah of the Old Testament and now Jesus of the New Testament so the phrase sons of God has to be rightly divided based upon the context that you find it in the correct understanding of sons of God is proven by the fact that human Souls do not pre-exist as both the Bible and God's Prophet brother Branham teach in chapter 4 of the exposition of the seven Church ages and in the sermon who is this Melchizedek brother random thought our souls did not exist as separate beings before we came to the Earth because Ephesians 1 verse 4 says we were chosen in the mind of Christ before the foundation of the world our souls were not separate beings our souls were thoughts of God in the mind of God brother random taught that we started as a thought of God then became a living soul in a flesh body after death our soul goes to a theophany body or Celestial body as second Corinthians chapter 5 teaches and then one day at the time of the Rapture and thereafter we will finally have the last body a glorified body let's listen to the quote from chapter four of the church age book when brother Ram says he does not believe in the doctrine of pre-existence of Souls and he said we were a thought and then became a thought expressed before I close this subject I know there is a question in your mind you will want to know if I believe in the doctrine of pre-existence I don't believe in that Mormon doctrine of the pre-existence of souls any more than I believe in reincarnation or the transmigration of Souls be careful here and see this it is not the person that comes predestinated eternally from God it is the word or seed that is it way back there too far back for the human mind to grasp the Eternal god with eternal thoughts thought and decreed Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated Romans 9 13. and neither was born and neither had done good or evil see it was the thought and then that thought became expressed and God bought back Jacob because Jacob alone was seed next let's listen to the quote from who is this Melchizedek where brother Brown said we bypassed our theophany we went straight from the thought of God to flesh body and brother random says Jesus came down the regular line from thought of God to theophany to flesh to glorified but humans bypassed the theophany stage so we did not exist as a separate being until God breathed the breath of life into our bodies and we became living Souls when we were born of our mothers from attribute to afford a foundation awareness means put on the land's Book of Life and for that even come the word theophany that could appear disappear and they become flesh and return back again resurrected that same body in a glorified condition but you bypass the theophany and become flesh man to be tempted by sin and then if this Earthly Tabernacle is dissolved we have one already waiting we have not yet the bodies friends this has to be the correct understanding from Brother Branham as the sons of God in Genesis 6 verse 4 can only be the seed of Seth who compromised and married unbelievers so the sons of God in Genesis 6 4 were not Fallen Angels they were humans they were sephites out of the lineage of Seth the sons of God in Job 1 verse 6 can only be Angels who have to report to God they cannot be Souls of believers who pre-existed because that is not a Bible Doctrine they cannot be Believers like Abel for the Bible says they were in the heart of the earth until Jesus rescued them after his death The Book of Job also shows how Fallen Angels cannot do anything without God's permission which is one reason why they have to present themselves before God all angels have to get permission to do their deeds and Job 1 verse 6 says now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord and Satan came also among them so we can see from the context that Satan is a fallen angel and he has to present himself before God along with all the other sons of God so the only interpretation that makes sense is that these are all the Fallen Angels who have to present themselves before God of course they are bringing accusations against the Believers but then God is saying they're forgiven if they're confessing their sins but these are the Fallen Angels who have to get permission to do anything lastly in Job 38 verse 7 these sons of God again have to be Holy Angels the scripture says when the morning Stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for Joy this was at the foundation of the Earth now those of you who know quotes from brother Brandon brother Brown did make it seem like these sons of God were humans but if we take his Revelation from who is this Melchizedek and the church age book we know these sons of God cannot be Believers because believers do not pre-exist as separate beings before coming to flesh bodies so these sons of God had to be angels that were rejoicing at the foundation of the earth these sons of God in Job 38 cannot be Believers Souls because their souls did not pre-exist in separate bodies before coming to Earth and flesh bodies all believers were thoughts in God's mind before being manifested on the earth in flesh bodies in closing friends I hope this video has been a blessing it's been on my heart for numerous months to make a video about the Giants or the Nephilim friends this is another exercise in rightly dividing the word of Truth as the Bible commands us and as brother Brown told us to do we must prove All Things by the word of God and so wonderful the revelations that God gave brother Branham such as who is this Melchizedek and of course the serpent seed help us understand clearly who these Giants or Nephilim were and this also unlocks the understanding of who the sons of God were in numerous contexts in the Old Testament we're thankful the revelation of the Seven Seals also opened up the fact that there is no pre-existence of Souls and there's no soul sleeping again we thank the Lord for the Revelation on this minor as Jesus Promised the Holy Ghost would guide us into all truth if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
