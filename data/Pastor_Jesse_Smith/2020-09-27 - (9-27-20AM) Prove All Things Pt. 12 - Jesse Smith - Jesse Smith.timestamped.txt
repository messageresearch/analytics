[34:56] jesus holy name today
[35:00] let's go to acts chapter 17 like to
[35:02] continue on this uh series on prove all
[35:05] things
[35:06] be looking at the debate we did a couple
[35:07] weeks ago as well
[35:09] a lot of these are really good questions
[35:11] and
[35:12] really good scriptural bible studies
[35:14] we'll try to just condense them today
[35:17] by the grace of the lord acts 17
[35:21] 10 and 11 acts 17 10 and 11.
[35:36] lord willing tonight we'll look at uh
[35:37] just a bible study on angels but amen
[35:39] had
[35:40] some good questions about that so did
[35:41] some of the kids so i thought tonight we
[35:43] could go over that and uh look at
[35:45] a second bible study on angels by god's
[35:47] grace
[35:50] so let's uh read x 17 10 11.
[35:53] so i want to open up a few notes here
[35:55] real quick
[35:58] another questions here we had
[36:01] acts 17 11
[36:07] 10 and 11.
[36:12] let's read 10 and 11 together one
[36:15] two three and the brethren immediately
[36:18] sent away paul and silas by night
[36:21] unto berea who coming thither went
[36:25] into the synagogue of the jews
[36:28] these were more noble than those in
[36:30] thessalonica
[36:32] in that they received the word with all
[36:34] readiness of mind
[36:36] and searched the scriptures daily
[36:38] whether those things were so
[36:40] let's have one more word of prayer if
[36:41] ever need on your heart let's make it
[36:42] known unto god
[36:44] heavenly father lord we we see through
[36:46] this word lord god how
[36:48] the the conditions of the the apostles
[36:51] they had to leave by night they couldn't
[36:52] travel during the day
[36:54] there was such persecution lord god so
[36:57] father we're grateful that we have the
[36:58] liberty
[36:59] by day to preach your word to sing songs
[37:02] loud loudly lord as you commanded lord
[37:04] in the scripture
[37:05] to raise our voices lift our voices and
[37:08] play loudly lord
[37:09] and sing your praises lord god
[37:11] hallelujah we thank you lord for this
[37:13] opportunity
[37:14] and father let us have readiness of mind
[37:17] like these saints lord
[37:18] in berea that search the scriptures
[37:20] daily to make sure the
[37:22] prophet paul what he said was scriptural
[37:26] god may we have that kind of hunger and
[37:28] thirst
[37:29] but we have that kind of sincerity as
[37:31] our brother saying lord
[37:33] let us make room for you lord god in our
[37:36] minds
[37:37] and lord in our souls lord jesus may we
[37:39] make room for you today father
[37:41] because you're the most important one
[37:43] lord you're the most important
[37:45] thing and subject topic person of this
[37:48] day today lord and everyday lord god
[37:50] we love you we worship you anoint me
[37:53] anoint your people lord to hear
[37:54] and listen receive and believe lord in
[37:57] jesus christ's name and the saint said
[37:59] amen amen god bless you as you're being
[38:01] seated praise god
[38:10] all right so let's uh look at some
[38:12] scriptures here
[38:13] i think i do have some slides here today
[38:17] by god's grace
[38:23] yesterday i got a call from brother
[38:24] dennis mcbride like i told you
[38:26] and he his whole purpose for calling me
[38:27] was to thank me for doing the debate
[38:29] he said he watched the whole thing and
[38:31] he said he was like debating out loud
[38:33] the whole time during the debate
[38:36] i thought yeah bro that's good i said he
[38:38] might be the next one to debate
[38:41] but uh um you know i got numerous emails
[38:44] also this week from different people
[38:47] even people against brother branham that
[38:50] said
[38:51] they thought my arguments won the debate
[38:53] and again church
[38:54] i'm not it don't matter who wins but
[38:56] what is true
[38:57] the word of god wins right the word of
[39:00] god
[39:01] is the standard it is the truth
[39:04] and is the word uh is the word of god
[39:06] it's forever settled in heaven
[39:08] and so just you know as we're as we're
[39:10] going through this you know just
[39:12] try to have an open heart mind how many
[39:14] want to grow in grace of the knowledge
[39:15] of the lord
[39:16] so church i'll just be honest it is
[39:18] through these debates that i've really
[39:20] grown
[39:21] because as i told the brother uh which
[39:24] one of you would have been ready to
[39:25] to debate brother rod bergen you know uh
[39:28] i wasn't ready for years uh but it was
[39:30] through these questions that it caused
[39:32] us to
[39:32] grow right because usually do we do we
[39:35] like questions
[39:37] wendy stick your head around i don't
[39:38] either i like to know
[39:40] all the answers i know i don't know all
[39:44] the answers but i like to know all the
[39:45] answers
[39:46] and so this is an area where you know
[39:49] this is uh
[39:50] you know with these people rising up and
[39:51] like the bible said there must come a
[39:52] great falling away first right
[39:54] and we know that's you know from the
[39:55] nomination but also from those around
[39:57] the word of the hour
[39:59] and so since they've fallen away this
[40:01] has really caused me to grow
[40:03] it's really challenged me uh to look
[40:06] into situations and i thought now how
[40:07] does
[40:08] i've done exactly what this bible says
[40:10] take what brother ram said
[40:12] and see if that's scriptural and if it
[40:15] is
[40:15] hallelujah if it isn't i'll say well
[40:17] that was his own opinion
[40:19] which he said many times it could just
[40:21] be my opinion
[40:22] right he never said i am the absolute
[40:24] above the bible
[40:25] he never said i'm equal to the bible he
[40:27] said jesus christ is the absolute
[40:30] and he prayed he point us that the the
[40:31] people would look to jesus christ
[40:33] as the absolute that's on the video that
[40:35] i made about the absolute but
[40:37] there's all kinds of quotes on that but
[40:38] i want to uh just look at this
[40:40] every day every day they would
[40:43] spend time and they're they take time
[40:45] out of their daily schedule right
[40:47] and they would hear they would examine
[40:49] what did paul say yesterday
[40:50] now they must have been taking those
[40:51] churches or else they had really good
[40:52] memories
[40:54] which sometimes i don't have a very good
[40:55] memory but they must have pretty good
[40:57] memories that they could remember what
[40:59] paul said in the synagogue
[41:01] on the saturday and then well i'll say
[41:03] like this they did it every day right
[41:04] the bible said every day so they would
[41:06] go after the synagogue
[41:07] they'd go home and read their bible that
[41:08] night and the church said
[41:11] right i don't always do that but what
[41:14] i'll do is i'll listen to songs
[41:15] like amen will sing songs and then i'll
[41:17] go home and while i'm washing dishes
[41:19] i'll listen to those songs
[41:21] because i want i want that joy to stay
[41:22] with me
[41:24] i just preach my heart out for three
[41:25] hours you know if i preach two one and a
[41:26] half hour sermons
[41:28] so i i'm really not in the mood to
[41:30] receive the word but some
[41:31] some sundays i do like i think a couple
[41:33] sundays ago i listened to brother tim
[41:34] pruitt's sermon while i wash dishes on
[41:36] the sunday night after even after
[41:38] preaching three hours i just love it you
[41:40] know i just love it
[41:41] but many times i'll just sing because
[41:42] i'm all like preached out you know
[41:44] uh but look at this is this how this is
[41:47] how we should act with brother branham
[41:49] and with preachers right with preaching
[41:51] the fightful ministry
[41:52] we should take everything they say back
[41:55] to the word of god
[41:57] and is this so or not if not we'll just
[42:00] forget about it and let's really trust
[42:03] in what we know is the word of god
[42:05] because men are going to have their
[42:07] opinions right there was a saying with
[42:09] amen after jesus died there's a saying
[42:11] john is not going to see death he's
[42:13] going to live to the rapture
[42:15] and my they could have they could have
[42:16] tried to find some scriptures but there
[42:17] would have been none
[42:19] right and that's what we have today
[42:21] people are
[42:22] people are uh so enthused about
[42:25] conversations of brother marin i mean
[42:28] stories of brother brown which is that's
[42:29] fine but we got to be
[42:32] dedicated to the word of god that
[42:33] brother branham pointed us to
[42:35] we've got a it's okay to think about
[42:37] that you know was billy paul
[42:38] is he really going to be alive you know
[42:40] when california falls in
[42:42] that's okay to think about but that's
[42:44] not thus saith the lord that's not even
[42:45] on the tapes praise god
[42:48] you know those are just things that we
[42:50] we hear but we have like the bible if
[42:52] we're really
[42:53] noble if we're really kings unto god
[42:57] if we're really priests unto god we've
[42:59] got to take everything we hear
[43:00] back to the word of god amen if not then
[43:03] we're backslidden right
[43:05] we're not in the spiritual state we
[43:07] should be
[43:08] because this is what a ready mind is and
[43:10] that's why i put my laptop
[43:12] up here i want to look up that word
[43:13] readiness because i didn't get a chance
[43:14] to do it
[43:15] this morning readiness of mind
[43:18] remember what was paul's letter uh to
[43:21] philippians all about the mind
[43:22] right one accord ready mind that he knew
[43:26] they were born again their soul he said
[43:27] you've got to get your mind in one
[43:29] accord
[43:30] so readiness of minds means zeal
[43:34] a zealous mind praise god they searched
[43:36] the scriptures
[43:37] because they had a zealous mind they
[43:39] were always thinking about the things of
[43:40] god
[43:42] it means eagerness with eagerness of
[43:44] mine i'm eager now look at that church
[43:46] i'm eager to go read my bible
[43:48] after i heard the prophet of god preach
[43:50] amen
[43:51] my goodness i listened to this week i
[43:53] listened to communion from brother
[43:54] branham
[43:55] twice it's a very short one because it's
[43:57] just a communion service
[43:58] but it made me go back to my bible and
[44:00] i'll show you why in a little bit
[44:01] for good reasons but also he just had a
[44:04] human error in there as well
[44:07] he said he said uh yeah he said yeah so
[44:10] we'll get to that one a little bit here
[44:11] so no it's that notice it's also an
[44:13] inclination you're so you're inclined or
[44:15] you're moved
[44:17] in your mind to go search the scriptures
[44:20] whether they be so
[44:23] and brother uh dennis was saying he said
[44:25] yesterday he said how
[44:26] you know how could you be prepared for
[44:28] all those things i said brother
[44:29] i said the reason i was prepared because
[44:31] god left me alone this little old church
[44:34] i haven't traveled anywhere
[44:35] and it's forced me to just study the
[44:37] bible
[44:40] right i haven't got many invitations
[44:41] which is okay i don't need them
[44:43] i got an invitation to preach here you
[44:45] invited me to breach every sunday
[44:47] so i got my lifetime invitation
[44:50] until you all vote me out i hope you
[44:53] don't unless i deserve it
[44:55] but uh if i told him i said the only way
[44:58] i could have those answers to rod
[45:00] was if i wrote that book especially the
[45:03] first question about deuteronomy 22 5.
[45:05] now how could i write the book i had to
[45:06] study it out i did take one brother if
[45:09] brother adam said
[45:10] women shouldn't wear pants i got to take
[45:11] that back to the word how do i prove
[45:13] that by the word
[45:16] and i had a good answer for him and he
[45:17] didn't say anything about it
[45:20] he didn't say nothing they just avoid it
[45:22] they just say oh you're under the law
[45:23] you're the law but what about
[45:25] all these scriptures right we'll get to
[45:28] that a little bit
[45:29] but he said that's what he noticed uh
[45:31] and he said how could you come up with
[45:33] all those things i said brother i've
[45:34] just been sitting there
[45:34] all by myself in my little office over
[45:37] there studying with the lord
[45:38] and we're just our humble little church
[45:40] enjoying our fellowship and
[45:41] one accord and god through these years
[45:43] gives us the answers to the devil's
[45:44] questions
[45:47] but how does it come by searching the
[45:49] scriptures
[45:50] search the scriptures daily whether
[45:53] those things are so you read your bible
[45:54] today
[45:54] if not i hope you do tonight i was
[45:57] searching into i was reading it this
[45:58] morning
[45:58] good stories about uh rehoboam and
[46:00] jeroboam
[46:02] amazing now look here's a thought that
[46:03] came to me this morning or was it
[46:04] yesterday
[46:06] did you know the bible said god was
[46:09] going to rent the kingdom from solomon
[46:10] did you know
[46:11] the bible said that but he said because
[46:13] of your father david i won't do it while
[46:15] you're alive
[46:16] now that is some harsh language church
[46:19] you have been so unfaithful i'm going to
[46:21] take it from you let's that's the same
[46:23] language as saul
[46:25] remember and i just read that i think
[46:27] that was yesterday but i read about
[46:29] jeroboam and rehoboam today
[46:31] solomon did such evil things at the end
[46:33] of his life
[46:35] right because he was old he got tired
[46:37] and he built up all those
[46:38] uh pagan houses of worship
[46:42] that god said i'm going to take it from
[46:44] you but i'm going to have mercy on you
[46:45] because of david now what about the
[46:46] blessings from generation to generation
[46:48] amen church let's live let's live our
[46:51] lives so if there is another generation
[46:53] god will bless our children praise god
[46:55] and hopefully they don't backslide
[46:57] hopefully they stay
[46:58] as true as we are if not more dedicated
[47:00] to christ amen hallelujah
[47:03] amen look at that because of david's
[47:05] faithfulness
[47:06] god let solomon not experience
[47:09] having the kingdom taken away during his
[47:11] lifetime
[47:12] but as soon as he died that happened
[47:15] right jeroboam came back from egypt he
[47:18] was conveniently
[47:19] in egypt so solomon wouldn't kill him
[47:22] and he come back and
[47:23] and asked ray bone raybone please ease
[47:25] up some of our burdens your dad placed
[47:27] on us and he said let me talk to the old
[47:29] guys they said yeah
[47:30] let me talk to the young guys no make it
[47:32] harder
[47:33] and he said my little finger will be
[47:35] thicker than my father's loins
[47:38] and the bible said they said fine we
[47:40] don't want nothing with david anymore
[47:42] look at the look at the foolishness in
[47:44] that
[47:45] give the people a break right give the
[47:46] people a break now that was physical
[47:48] work
[47:50] right the bible says with us we should
[47:52] gather more as we see that day
[47:53] approaching
[47:55] praise god amen and so
[47:59] you see it's very harsh language upon
[48:01] solomon
[48:02] because you know here's why i believe at
[48:03] church because to whom much is given
[48:06] much is required no man was smarter
[48:09] brother johnny no man had more money
[48:11] than that man
[48:12] he had the greatest kingdom there ever
[48:13] was he had a
[48:15] he had a throne it was made of ivory the
[48:18] bible said think about ivory tusks from
[48:20] those animals right rhinoceros
[48:22] his whole throne was made of ivory by
[48:25] amen
[48:26] with six steps plated with gold and i
[48:29] think there were six uh
[48:30] lions on each side with 12 lines
[48:34] no one had ever seen anything like this
[48:36] he was so smart and so he had every
[48:38] resource
[48:39] he had every spiritual resource and
[48:41] physical resource
[48:43] but he surrendered to the love of women
[48:45] and the love of their gods
[48:47] instead of being dedicated to christ
[48:49] church even if god blesses us we should
[48:51] remain more faithful to god amen
[48:54] that's what i've done god's given me
[48:55] more money i i give way over 10 or 11
[48:58] percent
[48:59] than my 10 percent some people i know
[49:01] understand if you can only get by giving
[49:03] 10
[49:03] that's fine i get way over it because
[49:06] he's blessed me so much
[49:07] how can i not give back to him more
[49:09] praise god because i and i preach it i
[49:11] don't want to get in the attitude
[49:14] of just 10 just a 10 or just 10 and a
[49:16] half
[49:17] i don't want to get in that selfish
[49:18] attitude i want to always be a cheerful
[49:20] giver
[49:21] because that's the kind god loves amen i
[49:24] don't know why i'm on that anyway
[49:26] that wasn't in my notes for today but
[49:30] this zeal see church we got it brother
[49:32] branson never lose your enthusiasm for
[49:34] the message
[49:35] that's that's what he means studying
[49:37] your bible praise god
[49:39] listen to what brother abraham said or
[49:41] listen to my sermon again be careful
[49:43] how many people you listen to because
[49:44] the more voices the more confusion
[49:46] that's why jesus said my sheep know my
[49:48] voice right that's why he places as
[49:50] sheep
[49:51] you can't if you hear too many voices
[49:52] you got too many ideas and god doesn't
[49:54] like that praise god
[49:57] now
[50:00] okay i wonder where that was okay thank
[50:02] you
[50:04] so it's it's plainly scriptural there
[50:07] that uh here we prove all things and we
[50:10] got to take everything back to the word
[50:12] of god
[50:13] everything and always know this church
[50:15] always remember there's majors and
[50:16] minors
[50:17] satan loves to make minors majors and
[50:20] that's when people will split churches
[50:21] and
[50:22] now it's different if there's a real sin
[50:24] in someone's church that's different
[50:26] if there's a real sin and it's not dealt
[50:27] with that's different but satan loves to
[50:29] make minors
[50:30] into majors right
[50:34] he does it all the time and so we've got
[50:37] to be careful
[50:39] what we make majors and minors
[50:42] and here and you know i've said it
[50:43] before i'm going to say it again but our
[50:45] day is different than any other day
[50:47] because our prophet had thousands and
[50:49] thousands of visions
[50:50] and we have more recorded times where
[50:53] he's talking than
[50:54] than this bible gives us of any other
[50:56] prophet
[50:57] so we have to be that much more careful
[51:00] to make sure we don't make something
[51:02] thus saith the lord
[51:03] or unconditional that might be
[51:06] conditional
[51:08] right we weren't there but amen we
[51:10] weren't there when god told abraham
[51:11] uh leave your leave your family and all
[51:14] these things and he obeyed the visions
[51:16] we weren't there years later when he
[51:17] lied to the king
[51:20] so was he credible or not yeah he was
[51:23] credible but he was fallible
[51:26] and then isaac did it twice later just
[51:27] like his daddy
[51:29] a prophet of god lied
[51:32] in fear in church we got to be careful
[51:34] the bible said the fearful will not
[51:36] inherit the kingdom of god
[51:38] so see we got to be one and that struck
[51:40] me with that coronavirus
[51:42] that struck me most people aren't going
[51:45] to get it right most people aren't going
[51:46] to be around it
[51:47] but it's the fear of it that satan is
[51:49] trying to grip over the people
[51:52] and there's people that look think about
[51:54] this there's people that have stopped
[51:55] going to church
[51:56] just because of fear and they're stopped
[51:58] hearing the word they backslide they get
[52:00] out of the bat
[52:00] good habits of the word and look they
[52:02] could not inherit the kingdom of god
[52:04] all because of fear right
[52:08] because they feed too much on the media
[52:10] they feed you much on
[52:12] on politics and things like that rather
[52:14] than feeding on the life-giving resource
[52:16] of god's word amen
[52:18] the fearful will not inherit the kingdom
[52:20] of god amen
[52:23] oh it's such an important thing church
[52:25] to be in tune and read your bible every
[52:27] day praise god
[52:30] noble that speaks of kingship right and
[52:32] royalty the royal
[52:34] seat of abraham amen the royal seed of
[52:36] abraham
[52:37] is in the word daily praise god
[52:43] now just so you know at this stage in my
[52:44] life i don't listen to brother ram every
[52:46] single day
[52:47] i don't because i'm in the process of
[52:49] writing and researching
[52:50] all the things brother random taught
[52:53] that i've been preaching for
[52:55] 16 years i used to when i was
[52:59] just teaching one topic at a time i
[53:01] don't know if you guys bang i don't know
[53:02] if you remember when i preached the
[53:03] seven seals
[53:04] or the church ages i had slide after
[53:06] slide
[53:07] i was in that thing every single day and
[53:10] night
[53:11] because i want to make sure i had the
[53:12] right revelation so right now
[53:15] this at this time i'm writing i'm almost
[53:16] done with this book uh
[53:18] by god's grace the rough draft's all
[53:20] done i'm just waiting to hear back all
[53:21] the edits
[53:22] so i don't listen to brother man every
[53:23] day now but i believe there will come a
[53:24] time when i do it again
[53:27] okay but i do i am in god's word every
[53:30] day praise god
[53:32] amen and so but everything i'm writing
[53:35] and researching are the revelations
[53:37] brother and brought that i already been
[53:38] preaching and believing for all these
[53:40] years
[53:43] so see if you're not listening to
[53:44] brother branham make time to do it right
[53:48] but make sure every day you're searching
[53:49] the scriptures praise god
[53:51] every day make sure you're searching the
[53:53] scriptures i know people making a law
[53:55] in their church if you don't listen to
[53:56] brother branham you're backstage that's
[53:57] not true
[53:59] because i know a lot of people that
[54:00] listen to brother braham every day and
[54:01] they are backslidden
[54:03] and they are and they worship devil and
[54:04] they worship brother branham
[54:08] so see you've got to find the bounce and
[54:09] thank god the holy spirit brings us the
[54:10] balance praise god
[54:11] amen amen that's right they can quote it
[54:15] better than you
[54:16] but they worship the man that's from
[54:17] hell praise god
[54:20] you see we got to find the bells
[54:25] now so i didn't got to my slides okay
[54:27] now real quick
[54:29] part 11. i just want to review real
[54:30] quick if you didn't see two wednesdays
[54:33] ago
[54:34] i showed in the bible how debate is
[54:36] actually scriptural
[54:37] as long as you got the right spirit
[54:40] paul ever is his custom was every
[54:43] sabbath to go debate and reason in the
[54:45] synagogues
[54:46] and there's many quotes brother brahm
[54:48] said the holy spirit sent him to a
[54:50] debate
[54:51] him against the 400 ministers brother
[54:53] branham said the holy spirit sent me to
[54:54] that debate
[54:56] he wasn't going to go he said but he
[54:57] said the holy spirit said don't fear
[54:59] i'll be with you i love those words do
[55:01] not fear
[55:02] that's what angels always say do not
[55:05] fear that's the angel's first message
[55:06] usually
[55:07] don't fear i'm with you praise god
[55:11] um but anyways i wanted to follow up
[55:14] with this remember the last sermon i
[55:15] preached in august
[55:16] the brothers dreams uh somebody's of god
[55:19] brother
[55:20] now i put a reminder on my phone on the
[55:23] last sunday of september
[55:25] to revisit that so hat was september on
[55:28] the same level as march and june
[55:29] johnny and i were talking about this
[55:30] amen and i ever talked about this i
[55:32] personally don't think it was
[55:34] so personally at least at this point i
[55:36] think his dream failed
[55:39] that's just my opinion at this point
[55:42] because church in march
[55:44] something happened that never happened
[55:45] before 20 million people lost their
[55:48] jobs and the coronavirus shut down
[55:50] almost our entire nation
[55:52] right at least the schools and
[55:54] restaurants right
[55:57] and sports that had never happened
[55:59] before if that was
[56:00] one two three knock
[56:04] now june was incredible as well over two
[56:06] billion dollars this is just what
[56:08] they've assessed that's an estimate
[56:10] two billion dollars in insurance claims
[56:12] from all the riots in june
[56:16] and september's had some riots and
[56:19] things but nothing like that
[56:21] nothing like that in fact all the ones
[56:24] i've been watching them too
[56:26] every time there was there was national
[56:28] guard there or they were on
[56:29] they were ready to go and to squelch
[56:32] those evil riders
[56:34] so i watch it now the only thing i would
[56:36] say for this month that could have been
[56:38] three knocks
[56:39] would have been those california fires
[56:41] because they were the worst in history
[56:43] but i just remember a few years ago they
[56:44] had the worst in history a few years ago
[56:46] so
[56:46] i don't know i just at this point unless
[56:49] there's some major thing tomorrow
[56:51] let's see wednesday's october 1st to me
[56:55] september has not been on the level like
[56:58] march
[56:59] and june was that's just my opinion so i
[57:02] just want to follow up with everybody on
[57:03] that
[57:04] and boy that really led off the pressure
[57:05] by the man because you know i'm human
[57:09] i don't want to miss it sister wendy i
[57:10] want to be ready if it's coming november
[57:12] i don't want to miss it
[57:13] if it's coming november i want to be
[57:15] ready last november
[57:17] right you understand
[57:21] i i don't want to i don't want there to
[57:22] be any question like barbara said
[57:24] i don't want any trouble at the river
[57:25] praise god
[57:27] i'm going to be ready well in advance
[57:28] praise god
[57:31] i've had to run the planes before and
[57:33] not miss him i hate that
[57:35] i think you don't like that either right
[57:37] i want to be the first one on
[57:40] i don't want there to be any any
[57:41] question am i going to make this flight
[57:43] or not
[57:43] and jesus has given us a ticket he's
[57:45] given us a seal
[57:46] the baptism the holy ghost and i want to
[57:48] have it now praise god
[57:50] amen we can all everybody can have it
[57:53] now he said anyone that's thirsty can
[57:55] drink of the living waters amen
[57:58] so we can know that we're ready praise
[57:59] god
[58:02] so that's just a thought that's my
[58:04] thought i'm not prophesying of course
[58:05] i'm not a prophet
[58:07] um but it just doesn't seem like
[58:08] september has been on the same level
[58:12] i could be wrong
[58:16] now let's uh i won't get through all
[58:18] these of course today
[58:19] i want to update you on this uh now the
[58:22] reason behind the church
[58:24] and i calculated there's been over three
[58:26] thousand views on the the video debates
[58:28] there's been over three thousand views
[58:30] so that's that's a small number compared
[58:31] to like the world but
[58:33] um anyways lots of people are are
[58:35] listening and that's encouraging
[58:37] um and i hope it's setting people free
[58:40] praise god i hope it's setting people
[58:41] free
[58:41] like i said i have different people
[58:43] emailing me texting me saying and then
[58:45] leaving voicemails
[58:46] saying it's helping them out and it's
[58:48] defending the faith praise god
[58:50] uh but i want to keep on this because
[58:52] and the reason is because we may do a
[58:53] future debate
[58:54] and also so you and i have the answers
[58:58] because you're going to have questions
[58:59] right you you either you're going to
[59:02] have the questions
[59:03] or people will bring the questions to
[59:04] you
[59:06] remember this is a short series i've
[59:07] only preached 12 sermons on prove all
[59:09] things
[59:10] hasn't been like i've been pulling this
[59:11] on for five years preaching on the same
[59:13] thing
[59:14] and this is all like i said this is all
[59:16] challenging things to me things i'm
[59:17] learning
[59:18] and it's helping me rightly divide the
[59:20] word of god
[59:21] okay so uh let's look here
[59:24] now my next thought uh so yeah let me
[59:26] summarize the debate questions here
[59:29] and then i'll look at there were so many
[59:31] unaddressed accusations in other words
[59:33] there were so many things our brother
[59:34] rod said now i call him brother
[59:37] somebody rebuked me on the youtube this
[59:39] week and said how can you call the man a
[59:40] brother
[59:41] how can you not he served in the message
[59:44] for 40 years
[59:46] he was a song leader for 40 years has he
[59:48] said harsh words
[59:49] yeah but have you ever said harsh words
[59:51] against somebody
[59:52] probably i have one time i spoke bad out
[59:55] in iowa
[59:56] cam and i were just talking i'd say cam
[59:58] please forgive me again i don't need to
[59:59] say that i get that
[1:00:00] we're talking about some other brother i
[1:00:02] said please that really sounded bad
[1:00:05] right
[1:00:08] um and jesus had the greatest expression
[1:00:10] of love what do you say father
[1:00:12] condemn them they don't know what
[1:00:13] they're doing he said forgive them
[1:00:16] and if he can forgive people spitting on
[1:00:18] him mocking him
[1:00:22] whipping him if he can forgive those
[1:00:24] kind of people what should we do
[1:00:26] if we got the holy ghost and i told the
[1:00:29] brother i said do you know
[1:00:31] do you know his eternal destination do
[1:00:33] you know it
[1:00:34] i don't do i believe he could come back
[1:00:38] or i do
[1:00:40] that's why i did it because it's my love
[1:00:43] my love drove me to try to help my
[1:00:45] brother because the bible said if you
[1:00:47] see your brother
[1:00:48] overtaking a fault mock him make fun of
[1:00:50] him and blaspheme them is that what we
[1:00:52] should do
[1:00:52] now the bible said go to him in the
[1:00:54] spirit of meekness
[1:00:57] see we don't we'll all be better we'll
[1:00:59] be better in our church if when people
[1:01:01] leave we try to
[1:01:02] call them back in love right
[1:01:05] as long as they're welcome back some
[1:01:06] people are not welcome back we still
[1:01:08] love them
[1:01:11] so it's uh i don't know the man's
[1:01:14] destination so i'm gonna keep calling
[1:01:15] brother
[1:01:16] because i know this if i'm salty he'll
[1:01:18] get thirsty
[1:01:20] if i'm salty if i'm the salt of the
[1:01:22] earth now look at that church if you're
[1:01:24] the salt of the earth
[1:01:26] in other words no one's going to be as
[1:01:27] salty and as
[1:01:29] wonderful to be around than you and i
[1:01:33] is that right you're the salt not of the
[1:01:35] country
[1:01:36] although i believe you are but you're
[1:01:39] the salt of the earth
[1:01:40] you give flavor you you give it meaning
[1:01:43] right it's not bland it's not
[1:01:44] dull you give substance
[1:01:48] to humanity people should want to be
[1:01:51] around you people
[1:01:52] should want to listen to you people
[1:01:53] should want to talk to you people should
[1:01:54] want you to pray for them praise god
[1:01:56] because you're the salt of the earth
[1:01:58] like yesterday i was talking to those
[1:01:59] brothers leo and stuart
[1:02:01] and i went over and said no no he just
[1:02:04] reached out
[1:02:05] he called at me he said are you a
[1:02:07] preacher
[1:02:09] i said yeah how did you know he said you
[1:02:11] just act like one i thought really
[1:02:14] i thought well what preachers does he
[1:02:16] know hope i don't act like them too much
[1:02:18] he said but you carry yourself like a
[1:02:20] preacher
[1:02:21] i don't know what that means but i just
[1:02:22] thought that was great that he looked at
[1:02:23] me and he saw
[1:02:24] he said that's the man of god he said so
[1:02:28] i hope that's me being salty i mean
[1:02:30] offered to push his daughter on the
[1:02:32] swings you know and
[1:02:33] i was trying real gentle with her and
[1:02:37] if anybody should be salty it should be
[1:02:39] us if anybody should make somebody
[1:02:40] uh want to be like them it should be us
[1:02:43] praise god
[1:02:45] i want to be like them oh if i'd only be
[1:02:46] like them all right if i had the
[1:02:48] patience like them
[1:02:49] amen if i had to love like them that
[1:02:52] should be us
[1:02:53] praise god because we have the love of
[1:02:55] jesus christ
[1:02:57] so uh let me look at
[1:03:01] my opening statement i'm in church i am
[1:03:03] going to go quickly through these
[1:03:04] uh what i did is i just did a uh
[1:03:08] a note for each one so my opening
[1:03:10] statement was i i
[1:03:11] basically said i'm nothing without him
[1:03:13] john 15 5.
[1:03:14] i said if i don't have an answer forgive
[1:03:16] me and then i define the message the
[1:03:18] message is not every word brother
[1:03:19] branham said
[1:03:20] brother man said the message is the
[1:03:21] scriptures god is vindicating right now
[1:03:24] that's what he said in rapture 65. okay
[1:03:27] so i labored on that
[1:03:28] and i said we have to rightly divide
[1:03:30] everything brother ram said
[1:03:32] because that's his humanity we don't
[1:03:34] exalt everything he says
[1:03:36] as thus saith the lord and i went to
[1:03:39] brother m's restoration ministry
[1:03:41] uh how he restored the mysteries and the
[1:03:43] gospel
[1:03:44] and then i showed how all history said
[1:03:46] he spearheaded the revival
[1:03:48] i said but yet god hides himself from
[1:03:50] the eyes of the lies and prudent
[1:03:53] and then i ended it by saying what the
[1:03:55] message has done for me
[1:03:57] it's delivered me from all my sins
[1:04:00] because i said i know what it's like to
[1:04:01] be in a church with the anointing
[1:04:03] sister sarah every sunday somebody spoke
[1:04:05] in tongues at our church by johnny
[1:04:06] every it was clockwork and people were
[1:04:09] weeping and crying and many people were
[1:04:11] getting closer to god
[1:04:13] so i i was used to the anointing it's
[1:04:15] that sacredness my man said
[1:04:16] it's that sacred feeling that you have
[1:04:20] and we uh almost automatically you bow
[1:04:21] your head unless you were like really
[1:04:23] backslidden and hard-hearted
[1:04:25] right but it would always bow our heads
[1:04:26] and i'd always look from the corner of
[1:04:27] my eye
[1:04:28] i can see that sister hazel was her name
[1:04:30] she said yeah she'd say i'm not you know
[1:04:32] she'd speak in tongues and
[1:04:35] one brother named ray in the back would
[1:04:36] always uh interpret
[1:04:38] but there would be different ones that
[1:04:39] would prophesy from different times of
[1:04:41] times but
[1:04:41] i would so i told them i said i was
[1:04:43] raised in a church that knew the
[1:04:44] anointing that new miracles
[1:04:46] but they didn't have the life of christ
[1:04:49] they the church we all love the
[1:04:51] anointing thank god for the anointing
[1:04:52] thank god for the rain but the rain only
[1:04:55] shows what life is inside of it
[1:04:57] amen glory so i could see this rain is
[1:05:01] given a weird light a strange life
[1:05:03] that ain't the life like i remember when
[1:05:06] they
[1:05:07] my dad would say it too i remember when
[1:05:09] the church condemned people watching
[1:05:11] movies like honey i shrunk the kids do
[1:05:13] you remember that movie though johnny
[1:05:15] we went to the drive-through to see it
[1:05:17] and then the preaching was condemning it
[1:05:18] you know
[1:05:20] but then a few years later it was okay
[1:05:21] to watch movies
[1:05:24] and we had sunday night preaching every
[1:05:25] sunday night man that preacher
[1:05:27] he my pastor preached twice but then by
[1:05:30] the end
[1:05:30] they had like uh well then it moved to
[1:05:33] bible studies and then they didn't have
[1:05:34] the services anymore just got rid of the
[1:05:36] services
[1:05:37] because people weren't coming well
[1:05:38] that's not the reason to throw in the
[1:05:40] towel that's the reason to keep going
[1:05:41] praise god
[1:05:42] amen if less people come that's the
[1:05:46] just keep going praise god somebody will
[1:05:48] come back praise god
[1:05:50] amen the people that really love god
[1:05:52] they'll come back
[1:05:53] and if not then you've just got more
[1:05:54] time with jesus praise god
[1:05:57] amen because it's another chance to be
[1:06:01] in his divine presence
[1:06:03] because he promised he said weber two or
[1:06:05] three there i am in the midst
[1:06:09] so i've seen it come in like that my mom
[1:06:12] saw it my mom saw it and she said
[1:06:13] they all they never they hated rock and
[1:06:15] roll in the assemblies of god in this in
[1:06:17] the 50s when it came in
[1:06:18] my mom was born in 1950. she saw them
[1:06:21] against rock and roll
[1:06:22] and she said slowly and i have all the
[1:06:24] pictures my mom had
[1:06:26] uh now she had a short short skirt on in
[1:06:28] the 60s
[1:06:29] but they all had long hair all the women
[1:06:30] had long hair and all had skirts on
[1:06:33] go to the 70s now they're all wearing
[1:06:35] pants
[1:06:36] and then my mom said in the year 2000
[1:06:38] she went to their youth conference
[1:06:40] and instead of playing christian worship
[1:06:42] they had rock and roll and hip hop and
[1:06:44] the teens
[1:06:45] are dancing to rock and roll that
[1:06:46] fulfills brother brandon's vision
[1:06:48] doesn't it
[1:06:49] i saw the church dancing to rock and
[1:06:51] roll
[1:06:52] right smoking cutting their hair uh
[1:06:56] all i mean that's what the church of
[1:06:57] america was and my mom has had the
[1:07:02] i say privilege to see that firsthand
[1:07:05] but we've had the privilege to come out
[1:07:06] of it praise god amen we've had the
[1:07:09] privilege to be one of those other
[1:07:10] groups
[1:07:11] onward christian soldiers amen the bride
[1:07:14] who is just like the original one praise
[1:07:16] god
[1:07:16] amen hallelujah amen
[1:07:20] we have the privilege to be one of the
[1:07:21] originals look just like they did at the
[1:07:24] beginning
[1:07:25] praise god
[1:07:28] thank you jesus so i ended up with that
[1:07:32] now his opening statement i think i just
[1:07:34] summarized so he went he said 40 year
[1:07:36] history in the message
[1:07:37] it was a uh it was a child abuse
[1:07:41] thing that uh scandal in the church that
[1:07:43] caused him to leave the church and
[1:07:45] question the message
[1:07:48] and it was never taken to the law
[1:07:52] uh i don't see much about that because i
[1:07:55] wasn't there
[1:07:56] but anyways they said the first thing he
[1:07:57] found was kenneth hagin who
[1:07:59] this is a pentecostal preacher who is a
[1:08:02] prosperity preacher
[1:08:04] and he taught the holy laugh anointing
[1:08:06] like you get a whole
[1:08:07] when you get the anointing you do a holy
[1:08:09] laugh
[1:08:11] which is nowhere in the scripture
[1:08:15] so they said they found a prophecy where
[1:08:17] kenneth hagin said before brother ram
[1:08:18] died he was going to die
[1:08:20] in 65 because of his disobedience i
[1:08:22] doubt that highly
[1:08:24] i haven't searched that one out but i
[1:08:25] doubt that highly
[1:08:28] and look now he's putting confidence in
[1:08:29] this prosperity preacher
[1:08:32] above a man imagine this marina turned
[1:08:35] away a check for one million
[1:08:36] five hundred thousand but this man's
[1:08:40] like
[1:08:40] send me your money oh you're gonna
[1:08:43] believe him
[1:08:44] okay that's fine go ahead i'm not gonna
[1:08:47] do that
[1:08:48] and i haven't searched it out yet
[1:08:53] but here's what i want to search out in
[1:08:54] regards to this
[1:08:56] uh our precious brother rod i don't know
[1:08:57] if you watch this or not if i want to be
[1:08:59] careful i always want to be loving and
[1:09:00] kind but i'm kind of under this
[1:09:02] zealous anointing right now usually when
[1:09:04] i preach
[1:09:05] uh and then but like brother said then
[1:09:08] it leaves
[1:09:10] but i wonder if rod is giving hagen
[1:09:15] the same treatment he gave brother
[1:09:16] branham because brother rod condemns
[1:09:18] brother branham for sharing testimonies
[1:09:20] that were not recorded before the fact
[1:09:22] so my question is does haggins was
[1:09:24] hagen's prophecy
[1:09:25] can you prove it was recorded before the
[1:09:27] fact
[1:09:29] because if not now you're contradicting
[1:09:31] your own
[1:09:32] your own beliefs oh i don't i don't
[1:09:34] believe any uh prophecies unless they
[1:09:37] were clearly proven
[1:09:38] uh to be prophesied before they came to
[1:09:40] pass
[1:09:42] so my question is were you there when
[1:09:43] kenneth hagin said that prophecy
[1:09:46] no he wants it so that's see
[1:09:49] that's one thing i found out about the
[1:09:50] devil everything he accuses
[1:09:52] he's guilty of you see with the
[1:09:55] democrats today don't you
[1:09:56] everything uh now some republicans do
[1:09:58] right you shouldn't say
[1:10:00] just democrats some republicans too the
[1:10:02] very thing they accuse the other side of
[1:10:05] is the same thing they're doing right we
[1:10:08] saw this week with the justice passing
[1:10:10] away
[1:10:11] they said you never fill an empty seat
[1:10:14] in the election year and then they take
[1:10:16] it back to 2016
[1:10:17] and the and the same people are saying
[1:10:20] we have to fill it in the election year
[1:10:24] if i haven't seen it that you know what
[1:10:27] i mean
[1:10:28] that's hypocrisy now it's different if
[1:10:32] they would come out and said i'm sorry i
[1:10:33] made that statement i didn't know better
[1:10:34] but they never they never apologized for
[1:10:36] nothing there's no humility
[1:10:39] to say i was wrong not church if i'm
[1:10:40] wrong i want to say i'm wrong
[1:10:42] i want to say jesus forgive me i made a
[1:10:44] mistake or saints i've grown in my
[1:10:46] understanding of that
[1:10:47] when i preached that back then god has
[1:10:49] shown me greater truth so
[1:10:50] forgive me i didn't mean to preach that
[1:10:52] but see you never see that from them
[1:10:56] now and then he went into all these
[1:10:58] stories were false you know
[1:10:59] brother graham his pentecostal church
[1:11:01] and his first meeting with the pentecost
[1:11:03] was a man from windsor
[1:11:04] he accused the random of plagiarism and
[1:11:06] he looked at me and he said jesse
[1:11:07] how can a teacher like you uh you want
[1:11:10] to
[1:11:10] accept plagiarism in your classroom but
[1:11:13] you'd accept plagiarism from your
[1:11:14] prophet
[1:11:15] and i thought oh you smart guy you
[1:11:20] i see that i want to address it and i
[1:11:21] want to say brother branham never even
[1:11:23] said the word plagiarized i don't even
[1:11:24] know brother brandon knew what
[1:11:25] plagiarism was
[1:11:27] plagiarism is when you take somebody
[1:11:29] else's work and claim it's yours
[1:11:30] brother ram never claimed some of those
[1:11:32] things but man never said i never got
[1:11:34] anything from larkin it was all
[1:11:36] he never said that he just didn't know
[1:11:39] about
[1:11:40] works cited or a reference page
[1:11:44] right like when i when i studied the
[1:11:46] church age book recently this summer i
[1:11:47] said
[1:11:48] i read uh i read almost all the church i
[1:11:50] booked this summer when i was writing
[1:11:52] the seventh chapter for this book
[1:11:55] brother random uh and lee vale put all
[1:11:56] these quotes brother ram used when he
[1:11:58] preached the sermons
[1:11:59] but there's no references so i had to go
[1:12:02] back in the message software
[1:12:03] and find which historical books was it
[1:12:05] the nicean fathers
[1:12:07] or was it another history book i had to
[1:12:08] go find the references so he put quotes
[1:12:10] around some of them
[1:12:12] but he didn't he didn't reference it
[1:12:13] like you would expect a scholarly paper
[1:12:16] that's because brother branham was not a
[1:12:17] scholar
[1:12:18] and that doesn't offend me he was a
[1:12:20] prophet amen
[1:12:22] he was a prophet not a scholar he was a
[1:12:24] prophet of god amen
[1:12:26] amen paul was more scholarly but amen
[1:12:28] that's why paul will
[1:12:29] when he'll quote old testament
[1:12:31] scriptures amen
[1:12:32] and he'll say when isaiah said or when
[1:12:34] hosea said or when jeremiah said why
[1:12:37] because he was a prophet
[1:12:38] he was a former scholar he's still
[1:12:40] ability but brotherhood
[1:12:41] wasn't a scholar he was just a rough
[1:12:44] prophet
[1:12:45] who saw missions all the time he prayed
[1:12:47] for the sick saw mighty miracles
[1:12:49] and he was elijah amen
[1:12:52] he was a fierce prophet like a ij man
[1:12:55] who stood there was stood against the
[1:12:56] word of god he wasn't a
[1:12:58] he wasn't a scholar the church listens
[1:13:01] testimony sometimes
[1:13:02] if you receive just say a hundred
[1:13:05] letters with prayer requests in a week
[1:13:07] how could you do anything else i had a
[1:13:10] sister i asked
[1:13:11] wendy and sarah mail out 40 letters in
[1:13:14] one week was it time consuming or was it
[1:13:16] not
[1:13:17] sarah told me it was time consuming did
[1:13:20] you have much time for anything else
[1:13:21] that week
[1:13:21] sisters anything fun you want to do that
[1:13:24] week that you
[1:13:26] that's just 40. and they didn't even
[1:13:28] write the letter brother ram had to type
[1:13:30] it on himself
[1:13:31] and the church said and there's quotes
[1:13:33] where they remember he
[1:13:34] he said i've got a thousand letters a
[1:13:36] week
[1:13:38] huh you see they're condemning brother
[1:13:40] branham
[1:13:41] for things he wasn't even a scholar they
[1:13:43] don't they're condemning without even
[1:13:45] knowing what he went through
[1:13:48] in other words they're so many of them
[1:13:50] are so prideful
[1:13:51] they don't even try to put themselves in
[1:13:53] somebody else's shoes
[1:13:55] and to try to see the other side brother
[1:13:58] graham called that
[1:13:58] brotherly kindness right he said put
[1:14:02] yourself
[1:14:02] in somebody else's shoes on the matter
[1:14:07] oh how can brother man forget all these
[1:14:08] details i forget things all the time
[1:14:11] my stories sometimes don't line up my
[1:14:13] wife always corrects me on my
[1:14:14] my wife my wife my mom's healing
[1:14:17] of cancer was it the lung or the liver
[1:14:19] it's liver
[1:14:21] i'll get it right one of these days i
[1:14:24] always say lung
[1:14:25] i don't know why let's see
[1:14:29] brother man didn't have time can you
[1:14:30] imagine trying to and then what about
[1:14:31] all the calls he said our phone rings
[1:14:34] non-stop and his wife mead had to answer
[1:14:37] and write down the prayer request
[1:14:38] billy can you go out who these people
[1:14:41] never lived
[1:14:42] this kind of life and then on top of
[1:14:44] that then he's in and out of visions
[1:14:46] like
[1:14:46] listen to brother biscuits testimony he
[1:14:48] would just stop talking with you and
[1:14:49] just
[1:14:50] sit there silent and just stare up at
[1:14:51] the at the sky and see
[1:14:53] missions and then after a thousand of
[1:14:56] those
[1:14:56] you expect him to remember every single
[1:14:58] detail about that
[1:14:59] i don't in fact i admire the man
[1:15:03] for doing all that he did because it's
[1:15:06] way more than i ever did
[1:15:08] he's prayed for way more sick people
[1:15:10] than i ever will be with johnny
[1:15:14] he's humbled himself and and answered
[1:15:16] and sent out more prayer
[1:15:17] cloths than i'll ever send out
[1:15:22] but see just a little just a little
[1:15:23] brother kindness goes a long way
[1:15:26] amen
[1:15:32] and they he said uh brother i'm so
[1:15:34] discord so instead of unity there's
[1:15:36] uh disunity he blames that on brother
[1:15:38] branham i blame that on the devil
[1:15:41] on the devil and then people not getting
[1:15:43] born again because if you got born again
[1:15:45] the gates of hell don't prevail against
[1:15:46] you
[1:15:48] so it's a dual responsibility right
[1:15:51] satan's responsible for it but also the
[1:15:52] people that don't get born again
[1:15:55] you can't just put it all on brother
[1:15:56] brandon brother ram was trying to unite
[1:15:57] people
[1:15:59] right like when when they write brother
[1:16:00] adam's questions he said ask your pastor
[1:16:03] that's unity you know this million men
[1:16:06] when brother would go into services on a
[1:16:08] sunday
[1:16:08] and he would have campaign meetings he
[1:16:10] would never have it in the morning or
[1:16:12] evening he'd always have an afternoon
[1:16:14] between services so he didn't take
[1:16:16] people away from their home church did
[1:16:18] you know that
[1:16:19] i'll just show you the quotes on that he
[1:16:21] would never
[1:16:22] pull people away from their home church
[1:16:24] brother branham brought unity to the
[1:16:26] gospel
[1:16:27] not division unity
[1:16:30] there's many quotes on it i wish i had
[1:16:34] him here but that wasn't in my notes
[1:16:35] then he said oh brother man it's not
[1:16:36] credible and we are all caught people
[1:16:39] mercy this is the freest call i've ever
[1:16:42] had
[1:16:42] ever heard of i don't tell you what to
[1:16:46] do every day i don't
[1:16:48] i don't even text you maybe once a week
[1:16:51] right a call a call is when they exalt
[1:16:54] one person and
[1:16:55] everything is uh everything is ordered
[1:16:57] by that one person
[1:17:00] right and it's it's a it's a damaging
[1:17:03] thing not a good thing
[1:17:04] now god's system yeah we do have one
[1:17:06] person over everybody that's jesus
[1:17:08] christ
[1:17:08] amen praise god and then for the church
[1:17:11] yes there is one man
[1:17:13] one singular man who brought the
[1:17:14] revelation and then it goes out to the
[1:17:16] rest
[1:17:18] but that man's not the same as jesus
[1:17:21] so we don't worship that man and we
[1:17:23] don't take every word martin luther said
[1:17:25] as thus saith the lord
[1:17:26] because he said some awful things just
[1:17:28] read his just read his writing sometime
[1:17:30] he said some really harsh things
[1:17:34] but you know so have i i'll be honest
[1:17:37] so if i i've said some harsh things i
[1:17:39] shouldn't have said
[1:17:45] so um
[1:17:48] my fir his first question for me was how
[1:17:50] do you support the king james version
[1:17:52] only
[1:17:53] uh knowing erasmus was a roman catholic
[1:17:56] so he's trying to get me on you don't
[1:17:58] like catholics
[1:17:59] i love catholics in fact i love that
[1:18:03] woman that trump nominated for the
[1:18:04] supreme court
[1:18:05] because she's married she lives looks
[1:18:06] like she lives a pretty simple life
[1:18:10] it's better than a liberal
[1:18:13] democrat mayor or judge you know
[1:18:17] and she goes to a pentecostal church a
[1:18:19] catholic pentecostal church that speaks
[1:18:20] in tongues
[1:18:22] that's good that's good because there's
[1:18:25] somebody in there
[1:18:26] but the man said god has children in
[1:18:28] every one of those
[1:18:30] so if you don't believe that that's fine
[1:18:32] but i believe what brother man said in
[1:18:33] that case
[1:18:34] because i know there's a foolish virgin
[1:18:35] group who's the bible said multitudes
[1:18:37] right he's going to separate the
[1:18:38] multitude on the right hand and left
[1:18:40] i know there's a multitude group that's
[1:18:42] going to be saved they didn't know who
[1:18:43] the bride was
[1:18:45] but they did good to the bride amen
[1:18:49] and jesus said when you did to them you
[1:18:50] did it to me praise god
[1:18:52] the least of my brethren
[1:18:56] now seemed like i was going to say
[1:18:57] something else but i can't i love the
[1:18:59] roman catholic people
[1:19:00] i hate the system you and i hate this
[1:19:04] system
[1:19:05] so i'm just going to summarize these i'm
[1:19:07] going to go quick here i told him i'm no
[1:19:08] scholar
[1:19:09] and i haven't been led to the lord to
[1:19:11] study this topic very deeply
[1:19:13] so i'm led lord to study other things
[1:19:15] it's a good thing i did
[1:19:16] to prepare for this debate but i said
[1:19:19] king james only because
[1:19:25] it's a great danger to add or take
[1:19:27] anything away from the word of god
[1:19:29] and i said in every version i've read
[1:19:31] every one of them
[1:19:32] takes something away and the bible said
[1:19:35] every word of god is pure
[1:19:37] add thou not unto his words lest thou be
[1:19:40] found
[1:19:40] a liar i don't want jesus to call me a
[1:19:43] liar
[1:19:44] i want jesus to say well done servant
[1:19:46] you told the truth
[1:19:52] and i said and i put up all these good
[1:19:53] quotes on erasmus he might not church he
[1:19:55] lived in the fourth church age so that
[1:19:57] was the darkest age of all
[1:19:59] but he was trying to get the people his
[1:20:02] whole
[1:20:02] life was spent he might just be amen he
[1:20:04] spent his whole life
[1:20:05] at a desk you know he would do other
[1:20:07] things too but his main
[1:20:09] goal was to copy the bible to get it in
[1:20:11] english for the people in other words
[1:20:13] he lived for everybody else praise god
[1:20:15] he didn't live for himself
[1:20:18] and eventually it was his writings that
[1:20:20] let martin luther
[1:20:21] uh interpret the bible in english as
[1:20:23] well and william tyndale
[1:20:26] and all these other men without erasmus
[1:20:28] work
[1:20:29] even he's a roman catholic there would
[1:20:31] have been no king james bible praise god
[1:20:35] i don't know if he was saved or not i
[1:20:36] don't know what he believed but we know
[1:20:37] that was the time
[1:20:38] the bible said they had to overcome the
[1:20:40] depths of satan
[1:20:42] so it seemed like erasmus was trying to
[1:20:44] overcome the depths of satan he was
[1:20:45] trying to get the word of god to god's
[1:20:48] people
[1:20:54] let me read your erasmus quote you've
[1:20:55] maybe heard it before he said i wish
[1:20:58] that even the weakest woman might read
[1:21:00] the gospels
[1:21:01] and the epistles of saint paul i long
[1:21:03] for the day
[1:21:04] when the husbandman shall sing portions
[1:21:06] of them to himself
[1:21:08] as he follows the plow amen
[1:21:11] hallelujah others i long for the day
[1:21:13] when wendy can sit at her job and do the
[1:21:15] printing
[1:21:16] and sing the songs to god that come
[1:21:18] right from the bible praise god
[1:21:20] amen it's not like putting people in the
[1:21:21] sermons you know kind of wakes them up a
[1:21:23] little bit
[1:21:24] wakes me up too when people call me out
[1:21:26] too
[1:21:28] but i long for the day when amen can
[1:21:30] sing unto the lord
[1:21:32] sing unto the lord psalm 98 when he can
[1:21:35] sing that while he's
[1:21:36] operating the machine i lost that's what
[1:21:39] he longed for
[1:21:39] his whole life was dedicated that sister
[1:21:41] naomi i've got to get the people the
[1:21:43] word of god
[1:21:44] this is my whole purpose in life thank
[1:21:46] god he knew it praise god
[1:21:48] thank god he didn't waste his life away
[1:21:50] and something else but he gave his life
[1:21:52] for other people showing he had eternal
[1:21:54] life amen
[1:21:56] glory
[1:22:04] now his argument was okay his argument
[1:22:08] was this and i preached on this a couple
[1:22:09] years ago maybe last year
[1:22:11] all the new bible versions have
[1:22:13] different scrolls okay they were found
[1:22:14] in the 1800s
[1:22:16] so his argument was well all the new
[1:22:18] versions have older scrolls
[1:22:20] that doesn't mean the scrolls we used
[1:22:22] weren't the right scrolls
[1:22:26] the reason our original scrolls were
[1:22:27] older is because the other ones wore out
[1:22:29] because they were getting used so much
[1:22:31] so they had to make new copies right
[1:22:35] but then their new scrolls have
[1:22:37] additions or deletions
[1:22:38] from the texas receptors okay so that's
[1:22:41] the point i made
[1:22:42] i just i even said this i left it
[1:22:45] open-ended i said well
[1:22:46] if god brings out a better version of
[1:22:48] the king james here i
[1:22:49] am show me lord i said i don't know how
[1:22:52] he'll do it
[1:22:53] but if he did do that i'd be ready to
[1:22:55] receive it
[1:22:56] but i don't believe it at least at this
[1:22:59] point
[1:23:01] and i said the reason i believe it is
[1:23:02] because it was prophesied who was it was
[1:23:05] it tyndale yeah william tyndale
[1:23:07] was burning at the stake he was a man
[1:23:09] that got
[1:23:10] a hold of uh erasmus writings 100 years
[1:23:13] later so
[1:23:15] and he he was translating the bible into
[1:23:17] english as well luther used his copies
[1:23:19] to write his english speaking version he
[1:23:21] was getting burned at the stake
[1:23:22] at his last prayer church he was getting
[1:23:24] strangled and burnt at the same time
[1:23:26] and his last words were lord open the
[1:23:29] eyes of the king of england praise god
[1:23:31] and within a hundred years god anointed
[1:23:34] king edward viii
[1:23:35] and he commissioned a man named uh john
[1:23:37] i forget his last name
[1:23:38] john to go ahead and gave him a license
[1:23:41] to print it in english when a hundred
[1:23:43] years ago it was impossible
[1:23:45] god answered the prayer of that faithful
[1:23:47] man of god
[1:23:48] his dying prayer being burned at the
[1:23:51] stake
[1:23:54] and with a hundred years god changed the
[1:23:55] social set up i still believe god can
[1:23:57] change things in america praise god
[1:23:59] i know it's destined i know that god
[1:24:01] they worship is going to destroy him but
[1:24:03] if there's another what if there's three
[1:24:04] more generations let's be faithful in
[1:24:06] our generation
[1:24:07] let's see some revival praise god
[1:24:09] amongst us let's see some righteousness
[1:24:11] restored somewhere
[1:24:12] let's see some people get saved amen we
[1:24:16] don't know
[1:24:19] we don't know what god's gonna do like
[1:24:20] i'm talking about amen when simon
[1:24:22] received the message it caused the
[1:24:24] revival in our towns there was multiple
[1:24:26] towns
[1:24:26] i think they calculated over 40 or 50
[1:24:29] people got baptized
[1:24:30] in our revival that was in 2001 and 2002
[1:24:33] 2003
[1:24:34] now many of them have fallen away but
[1:24:36] some of them have stayed
[1:24:38] wendy me my wife cam
[1:24:42] simon i mean randy so many
[1:24:45] uh brothers have uh and church that's a
[1:24:48] revival
[1:24:49] praise god that's a revival and so
[1:24:53] brother brooks prayed for that brother
[1:24:55] brooks i think he said he fasted how
[1:24:56] long for that
[1:24:57] i know simon was in the closet i think
[1:24:59] three months praying that every day
[1:25:00] said him the truth but brother brooks
[1:25:02] actually fasted and prayed for that
[1:25:03] revival
[1:25:05] and that's why i believe god sent it to
[1:25:06] his church and not the other lima
[1:25:07] churches there
[1:25:08] nothing against them i don't know if
[1:25:09] they were fasting or praying
[1:25:12] but see church we should we should want
[1:25:14] to believe that especially if you have
[1:25:15] children
[1:25:16] right i have children i want to see them
[1:25:18] have revival praise god
[1:25:21] we're all we all kind of want to see the
[1:25:22] rapture today but if it don't come today
[1:25:24] and if it's in a couple generations and
[1:25:26] let my children be the
[1:25:28] the spearheads of the revival praise god
[1:25:31] that's going to be my prayer that's
[1:25:32] going to be my hope praise god
[1:25:38] okay so i just and charles spurgeon the
[1:25:41] prince of preachers
[1:25:42] jonathan edwards george whitfield if you
[1:25:45] study go study these guys at some time
[1:25:47] these were mighty men of god mighty men
[1:25:50] of god and they all use the king james
[1:25:52] version bible that's what i said i've
[1:25:54] seen it operate in their lives
[1:25:56] i said it was operating brother
[1:25:57] branham's life i said i operated my life
[1:26:00] i asked my mom before i went on that
[1:26:01] debate a few hours i said
[1:26:03] mom which version did you memorize when
[1:26:06] you got healed of cancer she said the
[1:26:08] king james
[1:26:10] she said i only memorized the king james
[1:26:14] so i'll read it psalms 1 18 17. this is
[1:26:16] the scripture that my mom was healed of
[1:26:18] cancer
[1:26:18] by believing this scripture
[1:26:21] psalms 118 19 or 17 i can't i never can
[1:26:25] remember that scripture
[1:26:31] psalms 118 17 i shall not die but live
[1:26:36] and declare the works of the lord and
[1:26:37] that's what my mom has done
[1:26:39] my mom has fulfilled this scripture she
[1:26:42] has declared the works of the lord so my
[1:26:44] mom memorized
[1:26:44] that's why i told ron i said my mom got
[1:26:46] healed of cancer quote in the king james
[1:26:48] version
[1:26:49] i said i go nowhere i said i'm not
[1:26:52] looking at any other bible version and i
[1:26:54] said i've i brother ma'am preach it i
[1:26:56] went and did it i cast out devils i've
[1:26:58] laid my hands on the sick they've
[1:26:59] recovered
[1:27:00] i've seen the god's word operate so i'm
[1:27:02] saying with this praise god
[1:27:04] and he said you need to read this book
[1:27:05] and i might i don't know
[1:27:07] maybe it's possible i could read the
[1:27:09] book i doubt it but
[1:27:11] i could now moving on i'm going to keep
[1:27:13] moving on now he brought up another
[1:27:15] point
[1:27:15] um he thinks king james version is not
[1:27:17] the most accurate but a good version
[1:27:19] now look at this church he has no bible
[1:27:20] absolutely
[1:27:22] he uses 60 now this this number may be
[1:27:24] lower he might have stayed or not i
[1:27:26] remember i just got lower on the lower
[1:27:28] because i'm always guilty of
[1:27:29] exaggeration so forgive me
[1:27:31] i'm many times exaggeration so just like
[1:27:34] brother brown
[1:27:35] but anyways he said i don't have one
[1:27:37] bible can you imagine
[1:27:38] that'd be so hard oh that's tough
[1:27:42] thank god the bible's in my heart praise
[1:27:44] god
[1:27:46] great god amen
[1:27:50] you don't even have a you don't have one
[1:27:51] goat so in other words if you don't
[1:27:52] understand about john then he'll go to
[1:27:54] the second one
[1:27:55] third now look
[1:27:58] his to one meet his interpretation of it
[1:28:02] instead of saying god give me your
[1:28:03] interpretation from your absolute
[1:28:06] amen another one church see that's where
[1:28:08] the real born to be
[1:28:09] born again believer is they've got the
[1:28:12] word inside them so they know
[1:28:14] my understanding of this word has to
[1:28:16] match everything else i know praise god
[1:28:18] or else god's going to give me some new
[1:28:19] understanding and maybe i was confused
[1:28:21] before
[1:28:23] but see that and church you you know the
[1:28:25] niv
[1:28:26] there was uh there was translators on
[1:28:28] the niv that were openly homosexual
[1:28:31] and that and even admitted on the debate
[1:28:33] they didn't interpret word for word from
[1:28:35] those scrolls
[1:28:35] they did thought for thought
[1:28:39] that's why they take out the man and
[1:28:40] woman and the he and she
[1:28:42] and so then anybody can be a preacher
[1:28:44] because it's not in the bible
[1:28:45] just as a preacher don't say man or
[1:28:46] woman
[1:28:48] and that's where they get their
[1:28:49] homosexual bible because david kissed
[1:28:52] uh jonathan and said the love of him is
[1:28:55] better than a woman that's where they
[1:28:56] get homosexuality
[1:28:59] but see if you read that in the king
[1:29:00] james and go over to romans 1
[1:29:02] paul condemns homosexuality so you know
[1:29:05] david didn't have very good
[1:29:06] relationships with his wife
[1:29:08] as far as he didn't treat her maybe they
[1:29:09] didn't treat each other very well he had
[1:29:11] he had more friendship and better talks
[1:29:13] with his brothers his brother jonathan
[1:29:15] than his wife
[1:29:17] that's just how it was right
[1:29:20] but you can't say uh oh david was
[1:29:22] homosexual with jonathan that's a bunch
[1:29:24] of trash from hell
[1:29:26] but see when you've got one absolute and
[1:29:28] there's no
[1:29:29] discrepancies there's no contradictions
[1:29:31] you can rest your soul on what god has
[1:29:33] revealed and you'll never be deceived
[1:29:35] because the gates of hell won't deceive
[1:29:37] you praise god
[1:29:38] amen he only got one absolute
[1:29:43] only got one
[1:29:46] now my first question was are you
[1:29:50] i'm sorry are the following acceptable
[1:29:52] to god i said
[1:29:55] is it okay for men to wear women's
[1:29:56] clothes because i saw on his website he
[1:29:59] didn't believe deuteronomy 22 5 the way
[1:30:00] we did
[1:30:02] i said is it is it transgender movement
[1:30:04] will you condemn that
[1:30:07] i don't even know if i use the word
[1:30:08] condemn let me check this one
[1:30:11] now this will get another subject but um
[1:30:17] condemn it was a strong word
[1:30:21] uh so yeah why are you not saying that
[1:30:25] i'm sorry
[1:30:25] sorry okay i just have to move on
[1:30:27] forgive me
[1:30:29] so anyways uh would you
[1:30:32] is bruce jenner okay and where does god
[1:30:35] change deuteronomy 2 5
[1:30:36] so his answer was well brother jess
[1:30:38] we're not under the old covenant anymore
[1:30:41] because hebrews 8 15 says the covenant
[1:30:43] is vanishing and waxing away which it
[1:30:45] does say that
[1:30:47] and deuteronomy 22 5 is invowed because
[1:30:49] and he said the message has fallen from
[1:30:51] god because
[1:30:52] you're taking old testament scriptures
[1:30:54] and putting them in the news
[1:30:55] and simon and uh
[1:30:58] barb and beth were all listening to this
[1:31:00] debate i sent him the
[1:31:02] and uh they they saw later he uses old
[1:31:05] testament scriptures to defend his
[1:31:08] beliefs in the new testament and the
[1:31:10] sisters are like
[1:31:11] look he just contradicted himself a man
[1:31:14] who says you can't use old testament
[1:31:16] for your new testament teachings he uses
[1:31:19] old testament for his new testament
[1:31:20] teachings
[1:31:22] see is that satan thing that accuses you
[1:31:24] but you're guilty of it
[1:31:27] he's accused of the brother why is he
[1:31:28] accusing other people because he's
[1:31:29] guilty
[1:31:31] right and simon was simon said
[1:31:35] while we were listening that debate
[1:31:36] brother jesse all the sisters were
[1:31:37] bringing out scriptures
[1:31:38] jesus said i come not to abolish the law
[1:31:41] but fulfill
[1:31:43] and i didn't even think of that one
[1:31:44] brother i thought ray's got those
[1:31:46] sisters i got their sharp swords out
[1:31:49] i kind of thought i wonder if those
[1:31:50] sisters should have debated him no
[1:31:54] i mean they maybe could i don't know uh
[1:31:57] they'd have to testify right they
[1:31:58] wouldn't preach
[1:32:01] maybe have the sisters on the back
[1:32:02] burner you know like
[1:32:04] anybody got any good scriptures you know
[1:32:07] but that's great they've been taught the
[1:32:08] word so well
[1:32:10] that they had look at that the holy
[1:32:11] spirit will bring an answer
[1:32:13] that's what the bible said when the
[1:32:15] bible said when you're brought before
[1:32:16] the judges
[1:32:17] he said don't take a thought what you'll
[1:32:18] say in that hour the holy ghost will
[1:32:20] give you what to say
[1:32:22] and i experienced that a few times in
[1:32:24] this debate i didn't even know what to
[1:32:25] say and it's like the holy spirit was
[1:32:26] speaking right through me
[1:32:28] and then he brought out this now go to
[1:32:30] acts 15 29 read this here
[1:32:34] you're already there in acts yeah
[1:32:39] this was his next point in church every
[1:32:41] one of these can be debunked i love this
[1:32:43] message
[1:32:44] i love the word of god because it
[1:32:46] debunks every lie from hell
[1:32:49] amen amen thank god because i love the
[1:32:52] truth baby i got the spirit of truth
[1:32:54] that's why i love it
[1:32:55] that's right you got the spirit of truth
[1:32:57] you love truth amen don't tell me a lie
[1:32:59] just tell me the truth praise god
[1:33:04] so our brother tried to use this
[1:33:06] scripture to say oh
[1:33:08] gentiles only have to obey four things
[1:33:12] he and i i said later i said if you keep
[1:33:15] reading the bible
[1:33:18] uh acts 15 29.
[1:33:22] so you remember this i preached on this
[1:33:24] uh back when we did the uh
[1:33:25] series well we're still working on it
[1:33:27] philippians
[1:33:30] paul had to come up to jerusalem to see
[1:33:32] peter and james and decide what do we do
[1:33:34] with these gentiles they got the holy
[1:33:35] ghost at cornelius house
[1:33:36] so he said well let's just give him four
[1:33:38] things james spoke up he had the last
[1:33:39] word
[1:33:40] he was anointed to the holy spirit he
[1:33:41] said just obey these four things
[1:33:43] verse 29 abstain from meats offered to
[1:33:47] idols don't think
[1:33:48] don't eat a food that was offered to
[1:33:49] idol idolatry
[1:33:51] from blood right don't eat the blood
[1:33:53] because life is in the blood and that
[1:33:54] blood
[1:33:54] pays for your forgiveness and from
[1:33:58] things strangled
[1:33:59] right so don't eat a strangled animal
[1:34:02] and then fornication
[1:34:04] for which if you keep yourselves you
[1:34:06] shall do well very well
[1:34:08] so this was the very beginning of
[1:34:10] gentile christianity
[1:34:11] and so they said we need to tell them
[1:34:12] what to do just give them these four
[1:34:13] things
[1:34:15] and so the brother was trying to say see
[1:34:16] we don't need deuteronomy 22 5
[1:34:18] because we've only got four commands in
[1:34:20] the new testament i said when i got my i
[1:34:22] was chomping at the bit i'm like come on
[1:34:23] here
[1:34:27] church just go to acts 20.
[1:34:30] what did paul say
[1:34:37] the bible said he gave the whole council
[1:34:41] of god
[1:34:42] look at verse 20 20 20. the year 2020
[1:34:46] and i kept back nothing that was
[1:34:48] profitable unto you glory
[1:34:50] but have showed you and have taught you
[1:34:51] publicly and from house to house now
[1:34:54] where's the scripture about
[1:34:55] the whole council of god anybody see it
[1:34:59] is it 27 thank you yeah there it is good
[1:35:01] look at that sister good
[1:35:02] all right eagle eyes i say eagle eyes
[1:35:04] that's why i tell my girls you gotta
[1:35:05] eagle eyes
[1:35:06] find that scripture for i have not
[1:35:08] shunned to declare you that all the
[1:35:10] counsel of god
[1:35:10] church he spent three years with him you
[1:35:13] think he just taught those
[1:35:14] four things all three years now i know i
[1:35:17] can stretch out a thought a while you
[1:35:18] know i can preach to you sir
[1:35:20] one thought but do you think he just
[1:35:22] preached for
[1:35:23] four thoughts for three years no he
[1:35:26] taught the whole council of god
[1:35:28] right as jesus revealed it to him
[1:35:32] he taught the whole council and with
[1:35:35] that thinking i told him well then you
[1:35:36] have to throw out all the epistles
[1:35:38] because you don't need romans then right
[1:35:40] you don't need
[1:35:41] corinthians ephesians you don't need
[1:35:43] them
[1:35:46] see how foolish that is at church you
[1:35:48] would think he had a month to prepare
[1:35:50] you would think in the time studying
[1:35:51] that the holy spirit would have said
[1:35:53] there's more than four and i believe it
[1:35:55] did but john i did it but i believe he
[1:35:57] turned it down
[1:35:58] because the holy spirit will always
[1:35:59] guide you in the truth
[1:36:02] he said there's no ten commandments and
[1:36:04] see i just wrote the book last year
[1:36:06] you can take where's the book do i have
[1:36:08] a copy yet i don't but there's a certain
[1:36:10] fold out
[1:36:11] in the book i list all ten commandments
[1:36:13] you can find
[1:36:14] every one is still a command in the new
[1:36:16] testament
[1:36:17] and he literally said that there's the
[1:36:19] ten commandments don't
[1:36:20] apply to us anymore
[1:36:24] said boy brother you've got some
[1:36:25] problems here
[1:36:27] he said uh he said oh yeah women aren't
[1:36:29] wearing men's pants because they're
[1:36:31] wearing women's pants
[1:36:32] because they're in the woman's pants
[1:36:33] section now this is why i didn't have
[1:36:35] time to say
[1:36:37] levi's made the first women's pants in
[1:36:39] 1968.
[1:36:40] there was no women's pants before 1968.
[1:36:44] they had to make their own or wear men's
[1:36:47] that's the point i wish i would have
[1:36:48] remembered see there were so many things
[1:36:49] he was saying
[1:36:50] i just can't remember i'm just not that
[1:36:52] smart
[1:36:53] i don't have that good of memory to
[1:36:55] memorize everything he said
[1:36:57] i've heard that argument before people
[1:36:58] told me that oh i don't i don't i'm a
[1:37:00] woman i don't wear man's pants i buy it
[1:37:02] from the women's section
[1:37:03] that's because the devil had a woman's
[1:37:05] section for pants in 1968 there was none
[1:37:07] before that
[1:37:08] and i asked him plainly i stopped and
[1:37:10] said is it wrong for
[1:37:12] bruce jenner to cross us he said i
[1:37:14] cannot say right or wrong
[1:37:16] he said because everything sinners do is
[1:37:18] sin
[1:37:24] he cannot say it was right or wrong
[1:37:28] the church thinks about that and that
[1:37:30] what the bible call that brother
[1:37:32] an abomination and the remember the
[1:37:34] bible said it's an abomination remember
[1:37:36] the bible
[1:37:36] it's an abomination to justify evil
[1:37:40] and to make good evil amen praise god
[1:37:44] and you don't even have the unction
[1:37:45] don't have the nerve to say this sin
[1:37:48] is a hateful sin in the eyes of god
[1:37:51] and i asked him about homosexuality
[1:37:53] bishop he never mentioned he just went
[1:37:54] off on these other tangents
[1:37:58] and he said jesus did not throw stones
[1:38:00] like he didn't condemn people
[1:38:03] but then he admitted how jesus did
[1:38:04] condemn the pharisees he said you
[1:38:05] children of hell
[1:38:06] he admitted that but then said that
[1:38:08] jesus doesn't throw throw stones
[1:38:11] well of course nobody threw stones in
[1:38:12] the new testament except the pharisees
[1:38:14] when they killed stephen right that's
[1:38:15] the
[1:38:16] only people that threw stones
[1:38:19] but what did jesus say he said i forgive
[1:38:21] you the adulterer he said go and sin no
[1:38:23] more
[1:38:23] amen i better man i've already been
[1:38:26] preached at all
[1:38:28] okay let me close give me 10 minutes
[1:38:29] here give me 10 minutes
[1:38:33] this just feels so good i don't feel
[1:38:34] like it's been an hour and
[1:38:36] eight minutes
[1:38:39] so my reply what did i say
[1:38:45] i like to hit the some of the points
[1:38:47] here
[1:38:48] oh i wrote it up there um i said well
[1:38:51] jesus obey deuteronomy 22 5. what about
[1:38:53] you
[1:38:54] if jesus did it he never broke a law
[1:38:57] jesus preached the gospel wearing only
[1:38:59] men's garments now it's hard to say what
[1:39:00] they were
[1:39:01] you just believe they were shorter they
[1:39:02] had different outward garment
[1:39:04] they were larger girdles history says
[1:39:07] of course they had shorter hair you
[1:39:09] could tell right away it was a man
[1:39:13] and i said they gave four laws at the
[1:39:15] beginning and then paul gave the whole
[1:39:17] council
[1:39:18] i said all new testament commandments
[1:39:20] required i said we don't condem i don't
[1:39:22] condemn
[1:39:22] bruce jenner or any homosexual as far as
[1:39:25] to
[1:39:26] hell because i don't know them i don't
[1:39:28] know
[1:39:29] but i do warn them the bible said warn
[1:39:31] the unruly
[1:39:33] the bible said warn every man so that's
[1:39:35] why we try to warn as many as we can
[1:39:38] okay so i said i made that distinction
[1:39:39] i'm not here to condemn bruce jenner
[1:39:41] i just want i just was want to know is
[1:39:43] it uh wrong or not
[1:39:45] because i know his wife remembers
[1:39:47] daughters i don't know if they do but
[1:39:48] they might wear pants
[1:39:49] they might so i was trying to get to his
[1:39:52] life you know
[1:39:53] try to get to his what's your decision
[1:39:55] on it what is your word about
[1:39:56] abominations
[1:39:58] and this is good church you got to read
[1:39:59] this let's read one more romans 8 4 this
[1:40:00] is beautiful man
[1:40:02] he tried to catch me he said what is the
[1:40:08] uh what are you trying to catch me on
[1:40:09] something
[1:40:12] he said what is the curse of the law
[1:40:15] what did jesus deliver us from and i
[1:40:16] said
[1:40:17] the curse from the law he said so we
[1:40:20] have no righteousness of our own i said
[1:40:21] i said
[1:40:22] no i said there's more than that read
[1:40:25] roman
[1:40:26] romans 8 4. now church if you know your
[1:40:28] bible this is the holy ghost baptism
[1:40:30] chapter
[1:40:32] and that's the beautiful chapter where
[1:40:34] nothing nor death
[1:40:35] death nor hype no anything wrong
[1:40:37] anything in earth in heaven can keep us
[1:40:39] from the love of jesus christ
[1:40:40] amen praise god amen because look at how
[1:40:44] it starts off look at verse one
[1:40:45] this is the holy ghost chapter there's
[1:40:46] no condemnation of them which are in
[1:40:48] christ jesus who walk right after the
[1:40:49] flesh
[1:40:50] but after the baptism of the holy spirit
[1:40:52] praise god amen
[1:40:54] this is the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:40:56] chapter
[1:40:58] now look at verse four look at verse two
[1:41:00] it calls
[1:41:01] the holy spirit is a law we're under a
[1:41:03] new law
[1:41:04] not the old law we're under the law of
[1:41:06] the holy spirit praise god
[1:41:08] for the law of the spirit of life it's
[1:41:10] the law of life
[1:41:12] in christ jesus has made me free from
[1:41:14] the law of sin and death for what the
[1:41:16] law could not do
[1:41:17] right could it make me righteous right
[1:41:20] it couldn't give me overcoming power
[1:41:21] couldn't forgive me all the way he said
[1:41:24] look what the law could not do
[1:41:26] uh i lost my spot yeah in that it was
[1:41:30] weak through the flesh
[1:41:31] god sending his own son in the likeness
[1:41:32] of sinful flesh and force and condemned
[1:41:35] sin in the flesh amen
[1:41:37] jesus condemned the sin that was against
[1:41:39] me praise god
[1:41:40] in other words he silenced all my
[1:41:42] accusers amen
[1:41:44] there's nobody accused they can't accuse
[1:41:46] me because jesus took my sins away
[1:41:48] praise god
[1:41:49] amen now yes satan can go up there now
[1:41:51] and accuse me but as long as i say i'm
[1:41:53] sorry it's in the sea of forgetfulness
[1:41:54] praise god
[1:41:56] amen if i'm anything like job sister
[1:41:58] wendy then when god looks at me
[1:42:00] he'll say that man is perfect because of
[1:42:02] the sacrifice amen
[1:42:04] because of the blood amen not because of
[1:42:06] us but because of our sacrifice
[1:42:08] amen job was a sinner he had to make
[1:42:10] mistakes but he was redeemed by the
[1:42:12] blood but when god talked about
[1:42:14] it he said that man is perfect amen
[1:42:23] that here it is he said oh we're not
[1:42:25] under the righteousness of law
[1:42:27] i said sir i said the righteous but that
[1:42:30] the righteousness of the law
[1:42:31] might be fulfilled in us
[1:42:34] in other words the law couldn't make you
[1:42:36] righteous but the holy ghost can
[1:42:41] it makes you fulfill the word of god
[1:42:43] because love
[1:42:44] love fulfills every word of god amen
[1:42:49] and that's scriptural too we'll read
[1:42:50] that one here before we close
[1:42:53] he said oh you you're under the
[1:42:54] righteousness i said sir i said we
[1:42:56] fulfill the righteousness of the law
[1:42:59] he said who walk not after the flesh but
[1:43:02] after the spirit
[1:43:03] so i was trying to say all these laws
[1:43:05] old testament laws in judah 22 5
[1:43:07] that's the righteousness continuing to
[1:43:09] us that we fulfill
[1:43:12] praise god amen we that was a righteous
[1:43:15] act
[1:43:16] so we must obey it now because now we're
[1:43:18] fulfilling it by the spirit
[1:43:19] not by the flesh the flesh couldn't do
[1:43:22] it but the spirit can do it praise
[1:43:24] god
[1:43:27] okay go to galatians 6 and i'll close
[1:43:29] here
[1:43:32] i believe it is now this is all going
[1:43:33] off memory here by god's grace
[1:43:39] yeah verse uh 14. galatians 6 14 we'll
[1:43:43] close this by god's grace don't you love
[1:43:44] being a christian
[1:43:45] amen hallelujah i love it i love it
[1:43:52] i thought i tell mother uh
[1:43:55] brother dennis yesterday i said i was
[1:43:56] born to defend this message
[1:44:00] everybody should know what they were
[1:44:00] born to do right samson was born to
[1:44:03] defeat the philistines dave was born
[1:44:06] defeated god's people israel everybody
[1:44:07] should know what they were born to do i
[1:44:08] was born
[1:44:09] to defend this message because it's
[1:44:11] right
[1:44:12] it is the word of god for this hour i'm
[1:44:15] going to do it by god's grace
[1:44:17] galatians 6 14 but god forbid that i
[1:44:19] should glory
[1:44:20] amen save in the cross of our lord jesus
[1:44:24] christ
[1:44:24] by whom the world is crucified unto me
[1:44:29] and i unto the world
[1:44:33] so i'm crucified to the world and the
[1:44:35] world is crucified to me
[1:44:39] verse 15 for in christ jesus
[1:44:42] neither circumcision availeth anything
[1:44:44] nor uncircumcision
[1:44:46] but a new creature see what the gospel
[1:44:50] does it makes you a new creature
[1:44:52] the old testament couldn't have it all
[1:44:54] the way like weekend they had a lot of
[1:44:56] good
[1:44:56] a lot of good times in the human spirit
[1:44:58] but it never got down to the soul
[1:45:01] where their sins were totally done away
[1:45:02] and they have no more conscience for sin
[1:45:05] but amen when i see high school pictures
[1:45:07] it seems like a different lifetime for
[1:45:09] me
[1:45:09] i am a new person praise god i hardly
[1:45:12] can remember enough i think long enough
[1:45:13] i remember but when i live my life i
[1:45:15] hardly remember
[1:45:16] it seems like a total different thing
[1:45:18] why because god made me a new creature
[1:45:20] in christ jesus saving i'm not the same
[1:45:22] i'm a different creature how do i know
[1:45:24] because the love of jesus christ
[1:45:26] is shed abroad in our hearts by the holy
[1:45:28] spirit let's stand to our feet praise
[1:45:30] god
[1:45:33] so maybe lord willing uh next week we'll
[1:45:34] look at that there's many additional
[1:45:36] points
[1:45:38] there were so many points right now as
[1:45:41] i'm listening to it again i'm at
[1:45:42] one hour and 51 minutes it's a three
[1:45:44] hour and 20 minute debate so i got
[1:45:46] i'm listening to it on double speed too
[1:45:49] my goodness there were so many things
[1:45:52] the the precious brother said
[1:45:55] god help him and church here's where i
[1:45:57] come to this conclusion i told this by
[1:45:58] the dentist
[1:45:59] i said many of these people that leave
[1:46:00] the message some of them were never
[1:46:02] saved to begin with
[1:46:03] but some of them are safe they just have
[1:46:04] a complex
[1:46:07] and that's what i believe brother rod
[1:46:09] has i looked at his
[1:46:10] by facebook amen that whole time i
[1:46:11] thought what is wrong with him
[1:46:14] he's so bitter i i felt sorry for him
[1:46:18] sister wendy i thought
[1:46:19] this guy what is wrong with him
[1:46:22] like the bible said the joy of the
[1:46:24] countenance of the lord should be on
[1:46:25] your face
[1:46:27] at the end of that at the end of that
[1:46:29] meeting the other brother tim he said i
[1:46:31] just he said before he stopped i just
[1:46:33] have to stop and thank pastor jesse
[1:46:35] i said i can feel his genuine love of
[1:46:38] the holy spirit
[1:46:40] i said thank you sir i said i love you
[1:46:43] too
[1:46:44] i do with the love of jesus i don't love
[1:46:46] what he's saying
[1:46:48] i think i disagree with everything he
[1:46:49] said
[1:46:51] but i love their souls because i don't
[1:46:53] want to see them lost i want to see what
[1:46:55] i'm saying
[1:46:56] musicians if you'll come the last thing
[1:46:59] i want to say is brother dennis mcbride
[1:47:00] said he said brother jesse when i got
[1:47:01] done with that
[1:47:02] he said i could tell you were speaking
[1:47:05] from your soul nature because you spoke
[1:47:08] by love
[1:47:09] he said that man was speaking through
[1:47:11] memorization from his intellect
[1:47:14] and that's nothing but the truth church
[1:47:16] i didn't get to all these things that he
[1:47:17] said
[1:47:18] are way off he said god did not put the
[1:47:21] wrath
[1:47:22] upon jesus he said god didn't put the
[1:47:24] wrath of god upon jesus yes he did
[1:47:28] he was wounded brewed
[1:47:32] all the iniquities the grief the sorrow
[1:47:37] like they're just reading but they're
[1:47:39] like reading these popular social gospel
[1:47:41] books and just memorizing things
[1:47:43] instead of reading the bible
[1:47:47] imagine saying something like that
[1:47:51] god had to pour all the wrath upon jesus
[1:47:53] he took all of it for us
[1:47:55] that we can be forgiven praise god he
[1:47:58] took my place
[1:47:59] and so i appreciate that when dennis
[1:48:01] said that he said you were talking
[1:48:03] through your soul through divine love
[1:48:06] and the brother was talking just through
[1:48:08] human intellect
[1:48:11] let's buy our heads for a moment church
[1:48:14] i think
[1:48:14] as i bow my head i think let's search
[1:48:17] the scriptures daily can we do that
[1:48:19] how many would say brother jesse pray
[1:48:20] for me i'll have a zeal to search the
[1:48:23] scriptures
[1:48:25] i'm not looking but i'll hold his hands
[1:48:26] up my hands
[1:48:28] and i hope you understand i believe
[1:48:30] listen brother brandon
[1:48:32] i've been many times
[1:48:36] church ministry i'm at right now i'm
[1:48:39] defending everything you said
[1:48:41] i've heard for 20 years 19 years i'm
[1:48:46] searching that
[1:48:46] amen searching it daily
[1:48:53] heavenly father lord we want to be noble
[1:48:59] not as a prideful thing but we realize
[1:49:02] we have a choice
[1:49:14] [Music]
