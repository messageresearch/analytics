[0:03] God bless you the little girl with
[0:05] tremendous Faith be well God bless you
[0:08] hone go
[0:10] you greetings friends in the matchless
[0:13] name of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[0:15] purpose of this vide is to answer a
[0:17] viewer's question did the leukemia
[0:19] stricken little girl die after brother
[0:21] Brandon prayed for her in the 1954 deep
[0:24] call to the Deep sermon my answer is I
[0:27] don't know because I wasn't alive in 19
[0:30] 1954 but some accusers of brother
[0:32] brandom are claiming the little girl
[0:34] died and that her name was Carol Ruth
[0:36] strubler and somehow this makes brother
[0:38] brandom a false prophet of course I
[0:41] believe brother brandom was a genuine
[0:42] prophet of God so this video is
[0:44] defending The Godly Christian character
[0:46] of God's Prophet brother William Marian
[0:48] Bram hi friends I'm Jesse Smith pastor
[0:50] brde to Christ Fellowship here in akan
[0:52] Ohio USA and I defend the original
[0:54] Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ that he
[0:56] revealed to St Paul and then had to
[0:57] restore through Martin Luther John
[0:59] Wesley and and the prophet of God
[1:01] brother William Marin brandham so this
[1:03] video is defending The Godly Christian
[1:05] character of brother William Marin
[1:06] brandham and whether this little girl
[1:08] was healed or died it does not prove
[1:11] brother Brandon was a false prophet
[1:13] brother Brandon was a genuine prophet of
[1:14] God and I'll be giving five important
[1:17] points to remember about this situation
[1:19] in this video let's begin with the video
[1:22] from the deep call under the Deep from
[1:24] Washington DC 1954 a mother brings a
[1:28] little girl into the prayer line and
[1:29] brother brandom has discernment and sees
[1:31] that she has leukemia he prays for her
[1:34] he rebukes and adjures Satan and says
[1:36] the girl has tremendous Faith let's
[1:39] watch the
[1:41] video do you believe me to be God's
[1:45] Prophet is I mean well a prophet is a
[1:48] preacher you don't expect me to be of
[1:51] the enemy you expect me to be of God is
[1:53] that's way you accept it well then I can
[1:56] help you for he told me if I would get
[1:59] the people to believe believe me and be
[2:00] sincere when I prayed that nothing would
[2:03] stand before the prayer and now it isn't
[2:07] Uh I that help it's God that does the
[2:10] healing I question I said they won't
[2:13] believe me he said there'll be two signs
[2:16] given to you as was to the prophet Moses
[2:19] in this the people will
[2:20] believe and one of them was to reveal
[2:23] the secrets of the hearts of the people
[2:25] to them now you're not here for yourself
[2:29] although you're nervous and run down but
[2:31] it's been caused by a disease of this
[2:33] child this child here is suffering it's
[2:36] been turned down by the doctors to die
[2:39] it's
[2:40] leukemia isn't that right you've brought
[2:43] the child from out of town you've
[2:46] traveled coming from the West coming
[2:49] east you have come you've come from a a
[2:52] state that has mountains it's
[2:55] Pennsylvania and your city I believe
[2:57] it's Chambersburg or isn't that right
[2:59] right bring the child to me little
[3:02] sister dear the Lord Jesus was here he'
[3:06] lay his hands up on you and death would
[3:09] leave you and you'd live do you believe
[3:11] that I am his
[3:13] servant then in his stead I Lay My Hands
[3:16] on this child and bless it and ask that
[3:20] the demon leaves the child and that life
[3:24] comes to the child and it will live and
[3:26] be well come out of the child Satan
[3:30] by the authority of God's Bible with a
[3:32] Divine gift ministered by an Angel I
[3:35] adure Thee to leave the child come
[3:39] from you believe you're going to get
[3:42] well God bless you turn around wave for
[3:44] the audience God bless you the little
[3:47] girl with tremendous Faith be well God
[3:50] bless you honey go you're right do you
[3:53] believe me is his Pro now that we've
[3:55] seen the video let's look at five
[3:56] important points to remember first if
[3:58] this little girl was healed that would
[4:01] be another powerful testimony to go
[4:03] along with all the other Miracles God
[4:05] performed through brother Ram's Ministry
[4:08] there are many testimonies of God
[4:10] answering brother Ram's prayers for
[4:11] healing such as Congressman Upshaw
[4:14] Florence Humes who was healed of
[4:15] tuberculosis who I met in North Carolina
[4:19] Marilyn Hickey who had a thus say the
[4:20] Lord she'd have a child and she did 10
[4:22] years later Georgie Carter Hattie
[4:26] waldrup Banks Woods wife and son Ernest
[4:30] farmer and Max Manning a preacher who A
[4:34] friend of mine has met and brother R
[4:37] prayed for him when he was in the
[4:39] hospital and he's alive to this day so
[4:42] no doubt brother brand had genuine gifts
[4:43] of God and God himself Vindicated
[4:45] brother brandham as a genuine prophet of
[4:47] God so the second point is that if this
[4:50] little girl was not healed and this
[4:52] little girl was indeed Carol Ruth
[4:54] strubler then this would be a very
[4:56] heartbreaking story at least from the
[4:58] human perspective similar to other
[5:00] stories when God allows death to happen
[5:03] such as in the case of job losing all of
[5:05] his children to Satan when Satan brought
[5:08] a great wind to destroy the house of
[5:10] job's oldest son and it crushed all of
[5:13] job's children from Job 1 verse 19 I
[5:17] think this story relates to the topic of
[5:19] this video because job had prayed and
[5:21] made sacrifices to sanctify or dedicate
[5:25] his children to God according to job 1:5
[5:29] in case his children had sinned so we
[5:31] see a prophet of God job making
[5:33] intercession for his children and yet
[5:36] God allowed these children to die this
[5:38] is very similar to brother BR praying
[5:39] for this child if in fact this child did
[5:41] die and yet God took the child home and
[5:45] so in moments when God doesn't answer
[5:46] our prayers our faith is tested and
[5:48] tried but our faith is made stronger we
[5:50] go from Faith to Faith Peter said in 1
[5:53] Peter 1:7 that this is the trial of your
[5:55] faith being much more precious than of
[5:57] gold that perisheth although our hearts
[6:00] can be broken when our prayers are
[6:01] answered our faith is strengthened it's
[6:04] refined like gold being refined in the
[6:06] fire I'd like to tie in another story
[6:09] from Brother bram's Ministry that kind
[6:10] of ties in here with the job situation
[6:12] and also with this situation with Carol
[6:15] Ruth strubler if in fact this little
[6:17] girl was the one that died and brother
[6:19] brand had prayed for her remember sister
[6:21] stad cleff from Germany in the sermon
[6:24] the Messiah 1961 January 17th brother
[6:27] Ram tells the story of sister stad
[6:30] her baby had died but she had seen the
[6:32] baby raised from the dead in Mexico so
[6:34] she had faith that if brother BR prayed
[6:37] for her dead baby the baby would come
[6:38] back to life sister stad cff's husband
[6:41] worked in the German military so he had
[6:44] access to use a military plane to fly to
[6:47] get brother brandham and then flying
[6:49] back to Germany to pray for the dead
[6:50] baby in hopes the baby would come back
[6:53] to life but we know brother brandham
[6:55] went and prayed and sought the will of
[6:56] God and the will of God was for the baby
[6:59] to not be raised from the dead brother
[7:01] Bram said God had called your baby home
[7:03] in the quote from brother brandom he
[7:04] said that sister stcl said what was it
[7:07] brother brandham my weakness of faith
[7:09] and brother brandham said you have great
[7:12] faith you prayed for your baby but God
[7:14] refused to do it because he knows what's
[7:16] best and you still love him that's real
[7:18] Faith anybody when mountains are moving
[7:20] and things can have faith but let it go
[7:22] backwards one time and see how it works
[7:24] that's when you prove whether you got
[7:26] faith or not so to me this connects to
[7:29] the the video we watched from the 1954
[7:32] prayer line when brother Bram said this
[7:33] girl had tremendous Faith this little
[7:35] girl did have tremendous Faith to travel
[7:38] from Pennsylvania to Washington DC to
[7:39] get prayed for and if God did take the
[7:42] child home the child and the mother
[7:44] still had tremendous Faith but it was
[7:46] God's will for the child to go home to
[7:47] be with the Lord let's listen to the
[7:49] quote from the Messiah
[7:51] 1961 and so when she come over to see us
[7:54] and I left her at the house when I left
[7:56] yesterday she said what was it brother
[7:59] bham my my weakness of faith I said you
[8:01] have great faith you prayed for your
[8:04] baby you and your husband held on to God
[8:06] to raise that baby and he refused to do
[8:08] it because he knows what's best and
[8:10] still you love him that's real Faith
[8:12] anybody when mountains are moving and
[8:14] things can have faith but let go
[8:15] backwards one time and see how it works
[8:17] that's when you prove whether you got
[8:18] faith or not every son that cometh to
[8:21] God must be chastened and tried of God
[8:24] so remember our Tri trials Works
[8:26] patience and patience Works hope and so
[8:28] forth so we just hold on to God whether
[8:31] He blesses us or not we are right there
[8:33] to believe him anyhow because he's
[8:35] promises and to see how he does the
[8:38] third point I want to make is that
[8:39] there's apparently articles of Carol
[8:41] Ruth strubler death from a website of
[8:44] one of brother Ram's accusers here are
[8:46] screenshots of those apparent newspaper
[8:54] articles so again friends I don't know
[8:56] that these are legitimate newspaper
[8:57] articles because I wasn't alive in 19 54
[9:00] now friends these articles could be
[9:03] fabricated and I'm not saying that to be
[9:05] disingenuous or snarky but from my
[9:08] experience some not all of brother Ram's
[9:10] accusers can be extremely dishonest and
[9:13] slanderous this has to be an option for
[9:16] example they slander brother brandham by
[9:17] claiming brother brandham is responsible
[9:20] for Jim Jones's massacre in Guyana South
[9:23] America which is an absolute disgrace
[9:27] brother brandom separated from Jim Jones
[9:29] in 1956 and I have videos proving that
[9:32] Jim Jones left the Christian faith Jim
[9:34] Jones became an absolute heretic demon
[9:37] possessed sexual deviant and yet these
[9:41] Slanders of brother brandham continue to
[9:43] push this propaganda this lie that
[9:45] somehow brother ROM is responsible for
[9:47] the actions of Jim Jones it's a bunch of
[9:50] nonsense another example is some of
[9:52] brother Ram's accusers claim brother
[9:54] random plagiarized the Seven Seals from
[9:56] Lin and Russell that's a lie there's
[9:59] over 38 differences brother Ram taught
[10:01] from Lin and Russell on the Seven Seals
[10:03] and again this is one of the most
[10:05] slanderous outrageous dishonest attacks
[10:07] I've ever heard and shame on these
[10:09] people for slandering brother brandom
[10:11] and claiming he plagiarized he did not
[10:13] plagiarize the Seven Seals the fourth
[10:16] point is that if Carol Ruth strubler was
[10:19] the little girl in the video and she
[10:21] died then that doesn't prove brother
[10:23] random lied if you watch the video again
[10:25] or read the text from the video brother
[10:28] random never said thus sayith the Lord
[10:30] the girl would be healed brother Braham
[10:32] did pray and adure the devil he asked
[10:34] for the demon to leave but he never said
[10:36] she would be well in the name of the
[10:38] Lord or with thus say the Lord Brother
[10:41] Ram did try to adure the devil but even
[10:43] Jesus's own disciples in certain
[10:46] situations could not cast out some
[10:49] demons it seems brother randam was
[10:51] simply asking a blessing on the child as
[10:53] the angel the Lord told him when the
[10:55] angel commissioned him brother Ram
[10:57] talked about this in 1955 how the angel
[10:59] came to me in his commission he said the
[11:01] angel said to just ask a blessing and
[11:03] walk away if the disease doesn't leave
[11:07] and then notice again from the deep call
[11:09] through the Deep quote or video brother
[11:10] Ram never said he saw the demon leave so
[11:13] here's the quote let's listen to it from
[11:14] 1955 it's January 17th and said then
[11:19] just stand quiet and it'll there'll be a
[11:22] physical effect that'll happen on your
[11:24] body and said then you pray and if it
[11:27] leaves the disease is gone from the
[11:30] people if it doesn't leave just ask the
[11:33] blessing and walk away also I want to
[11:35] say I'm sure nearly all honest preachers
[11:38] have likely experienced something
[11:39] similar to what brother brandham may
[11:41] have experienced here if the child in
[11:43] fact did pass away where preachers hope
[11:46] and pray for healing with all of their
[11:48] hearts and they try to rebuke Satan they
[11:51] try to rebuke the sickness but yet the
[11:53] healing doesn't happen so an honest
[11:55] preacher in this case I believe would
[11:57] have compassion on brother brandom doing
[11:58] his best to pray for the sick and The
[12:01] Afflicted hoping for a healing being
[12:04] positive about healing but ultimately
[12:07] the result is left up to almighty God
[12:10] the fifth and final point I want to make
[12:11] is that sometimes men of God spoke
[12:13] things that did not come to pass this
[12:15] means the men of God spoke
[12:17] presumptuously in Hope and not in faith
[12:20] I put out a video about this recently
[12:22] with three or four examples of prophets
[12:24] who made predictions that did not come
[12:26] to pass I'll leave a link in the
[12:28] description to this video
[12:30] for example Jonah said God was going to
[12:32] destroy Nineveh but it did not happen in
[12:34] Jonah
[12:35] 3:4 Isaiah said Hezekiah would die but
[12:38] then God gave him 15 more years 2 Kings
[12:42] 20:1 and David thought in his heart he
[12:44] would surely be killed by Saul in 1st
[12:47] Samuel
[12:49] 27:1 and then some of jesus' disciples
[12:52] and perhaps even Apostles thought John
[12:54] would live to see Jesus's second coming
[12:56] in John 21:23
[13:00] in
[13:01] closing friends hope this video was a
[13:03] blessing by the grace of God when I was
[13:05] asked this question I had never really
[13:07] study this topic before so I did the
[13:08] best I could on short notice to study
[13:11] this topic and again I wasn't there in
[13:13] 1954 I don't know anyone who was there
[13:16] in 1954 that could confirm these
[13:18] newspaper stories about the little girl
[13:21] Carol Ruth strubler but either way
[13:24] brother BR was not at fault brother Bram
[13:26] did not speak anything wrong in the name
[13:28] of the Lord and we know God honored his
[13:30] gift of healing and discernment many
[13:32] many times by the grace of God and again
[13:35] as 1 Peter 1 verse 7 says God is going
[13:39] to allow our faith to be tried he's
[13:40] going to let us go through difficult
[13:41] times difficult Seasons difficult
[13:43] situations to refine our faith to make
[13:46] it more strong more sincere more like
[13:49] the faith of the Son of God this reminds
[13:52] us of the prayer of the Lord Jesus in
[13:53] The Garden of Gethsemane when he got the
[13:55] victory through prayer saying not my
[13:58] will but thy will be done and we know
[14:01] brother Ram said and many preachers
[14:03] believe Jesus got the victory there
[14:05] through prayer that allowed him to go to
[14:06] the cross and suffer that we might be
[14:09] saved so praise the Lord Jesus Christ
[14:11] for his humility his obedience to the
[14:13] father his willingness to die for the
[14:16] joy that was set before and now we get
[14:18] to live with Jesus Christ
[14:20] eternally if you have any questions
[14:21] concerns or testimonies about this video
[14:23] please contact
[14:25] me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[14:28] the desire of your heart
