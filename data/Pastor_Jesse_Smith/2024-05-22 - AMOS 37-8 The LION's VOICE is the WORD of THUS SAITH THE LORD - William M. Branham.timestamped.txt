[0:00] and this
[0:02] line of the tribe of Judah prevailed he
[0:06] said don't weep John for the line of the
[0:10] tribe of Judah the root of David has
[0:13] prevailed he's already
[0:15] overcome he's done it it's over
[0:19] John
[0:21] hallelujah praise the Lord he produced
[0:24] the beach amen
[0:27] [Applause]
[0:30] Glory that s sent on back to the greasy
[0:34] hands that the with his wisdom that
[0:36] defiled him the human being yes but when
[0:41] John turned to
[0:44] look he saw a
[0:46] lamb what a different from a line he
[0:50] said the line has prevailed see again I
[0:53] could use that there God hiding in
[0:56] Simplicity he said is a line that's a
[0:59] king of the
[1:00] Beast the lon has prevailed the
[1:04] strongest thing there is is a line God
[1:07] I've laid out in the jungles in Africa
[1:10] and hear the uh the giraffe squealing
[1:14] and the Great Mighty elephant with his
[1:16] trunk in the air we we we and you're the
[1:20] the the Savages of the desert screaming
[1:23] out their bloody curle cries and the The
[1:27] Beatles to and Billy Paul and I laying a
[1:30] little place covered over with stickers
[1:33] and hear way off in a distance a line
[1:36] Roar and every thing on the desert shuts
[1:40] up even The Beetles stop
[1:43] har the king
[1:46] [Music]
[1:47] speaks I tell you that's when
[1:49] denominations and doubts fall to the
[1:52] ground
[1:54] everything the king
[1:57] spe and this is the king
[2:03] that's his word hallelujah
[2:08] oh I believe it was Amos as I referred
[2:11] to him a while ago that he said he was
[2:14] not a prophet he the son of a prophet
[2:17] but said that when the lion roars who
[2:20] can be fear and if anyone ever heard a
[2:23] real lion roar in the wilderness these
[2:25] you hear in the cages around here are
[2:27] just meowing but when one Roar s in the
[2:30] wilderness everything takes heed I've
[2:33] laid in the jungle of hunam and he's the
[2:35] king of the Beast and when that line
[2:37] Roars even the Beatles stop hollering
[2:39] everything the the jackals and the and
[2:43] the hyas of screaming and the other
[2:45] animals the squawking of the baboons and
[2:48] monkeys and The Beetles you can hardly
[2:49] hear yourself think but in a distant let
[2:51] lion roar and every Beetle stop all see
[2:55] everything's afraid of him yet there's
[2:57] many things can kill him but he's
[3:00] recognized as a king amongst the Beast
[3:02] he said when the lion roars who can but
[3:05] fear he said then God has spoken who can
[3:09] but prophesy that's I think the
[3:11] condition meets that challenge again
[3:14] today God has spoken see and we see the
[3:17] handwriting on the wall so it's very
[3:19] easy to prophesy and see that we're at
[3:22] the end time and we're seeing God from
[3:25] every section of denominations all the
[3:28] way from Catholic ISM through all the
[3:30] Protestant churches Buddhist and what
[3:33] more from India and whatever more he's
[3:35] calling his people together assembling
[3:38] them together and um I'm very happy for
[3:41] that to see this day
[3:43] coming is right here among you you will
[3:47] just remember thus saith the Lord you
[3:51] will never in any over more Gentile
[3:54] Church age ever see any sign to succeed
[3:59] this
[4:00] go greater this is the last sign to the
[4:05] church it's predicted that they're going
[4:07] to do it and they're going to do it for
[4:10] it's thus sayth the lord they're going
[4:12] to do it you think them nominations will
[4:16] ever break up their denomination come
[4:17] back to the word it's thus sayith the
[4:19] Lord they won't will they go into the
[4:22] Antichrist exactly it's thus sayth the
[4:24] Lord they will what are you saying about
[4:27] I have to be a witness in told to
[4:30] you all
[4:34] believers you wonder why I rap it women
[4:36] the way I
[4:38] do 30 years
[4:41] ago I've got thus sayeth the
[4:44] Lord 30 years ago when I entered the
[4:46] ministry he told me that the strain of
[4:49] women would come so immoral and imputed
[4:51] in the last days it' be the most defiled
[4:53] thing on the
[4:55] Earth right she started at the beginning
[4:57] and Satan us her at the end and look
[4:59] what is happening look down through the
[5:00] ears said she'll continue to strip
[5:02] herself and said there'll just be a
[5:05] little tiny group of the very elected
[5:07] it's predestinated will escape
[5:11] that Vision notice just closing I want
[5:14] to say this one thing just before
[5:17] closing that's what led me to say
[5:20] this it's thus sayth the Lord a man
[5:24] would say that without putting it in his
[5:27] own thinking he'd be a hyp critt should
[5:30] go to hell
[5:32] for some of the dirtiest looking things
[5:35] I ever seen in my life and when the
[5:38] American Church come up it was the
[5:42] awfulest I ever seen the heavenly father
[5:44] is my judge they had on these tattletail
[5:49] gray skirts like one of these barroom
[5:52] girls with no back oned up here holding
[5:54] up like a gray looking piece of paper
[5:56] and like hoola dancing paint short
[6:00] bobbed hair smoking cigarettes and
[6:03] twisting as it walk to rock and roll and
[6:05] I said is that the Church of the United
[6:09] States and the voice said yes it is
[6:13] and thus sayith the Lord amen hallelujah
[6:18] hallelujah the baptism using the title
[6:20] of father son Holy Ghost is
[6:22] false th sayth the Lord amen amen amen
[6:29] I command every one of you on here on
[6:32] tape that hasn't been baptized in the
[6:35] name of Jesus Christ be baptized again
[6:39] in the name of Jesus Christ amen Paul in
[6:42] Acts
[6:43] 59 or 195 said have you received the
[6:47] Holy Ghost since you believe and said we
[6:49] know not where it be any Holy Ghost said
[6:50] what was you baptized amen they said
[6:53] we've been baptized but not in Christian
[6:56] baptism Father Son and Holy Ghost is not
[6:59] Christian baptism amen no Christian was
[7:02] ever baptized like that in the Bible or
[7:06] for hundreds of years after the Bible
[7:08] it's a Catholic Creed and not a
[7:11] Christian doctrine show me in the Bible
[7:15] amen it's a it's a
[7:18] fraud it's a working of devils amen I
[7:21] don't mean to say the people it's
[7:23] baptized like at her that way God's got
[7:25] a many person out there today that don't
[7:27] know no better but but the hour has come
[7:31] amen we've got to get back to the word
[7:33] if we expect God to work in this day
[7:34] like he then
