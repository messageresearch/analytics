TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] greetings friends in the matchless name of the lord jesus christ the purpose of this video is to show the three instances of weeping wailing and gnashing of teeth with two of them happening during the great tribulation period and the third happening in hell and at the heart of this video is also the state of the foolish virgin and it's of my opinion that the foolish virgin is saved as numerous scriptures show and also numerous quotes from god's prophet william branham's show the subject of the foolish virgin is quite a deep subject brother branham said it was quite a lesson when he taught on it in 1960 in the sermon called the patmos vision and i think all believers agree with that as well so this video is another exercise in rightly dividing the word of truth by the revelations god has given us through his prophet brother branham and again i'm always open to correction from the holy ghost as he can correct me privately or he can correct me publicly through saints of the lord and every christian should be open to correction just as brother branham modeled that the first instance of weeping and gnashing of teeth is the foolish virgin during the first three and a half years of the seven year great tribulation period the foolish virgin christians must give their lives as martyrs to the beast system in order to reject the mark of the beast and all foolish virgin christians will be saved at the great white throne judgment the second kind of weeping and gnashing of teeth is that of all the sinners who take the mark of the beast and this weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth takes place during the second half of the seven year great tribulation period or in other words the last three and a half years of the tribulation this last three and a half years is the time when the wrath of god is poured out we must believe the scriptures that say the trumpets and vials bring forth the wrath of god and they cannot be poured out until after the 144 000 jews are sealed with the holy ghost in their foreheads according to revelation 7 verse 3 and revelation 8 verse 7. revelation 7 3 says this plainly saying hurt not the earth neither the sea nor the trees till we have sealed the servants of god in their foreheads notice the trees cannot be hurt until after the 144 000 are sealed with the holy ghost if you read revelation 8 verse 7 a third part of the trees are hurt after the sounding of the first trumpet this means the trumpets cannot be sounded until after the 144 000 are sealed with the holy ghost this helps us understand the order of the great tribulation then the first three and a half years is a time of torment but not the wrath of god for revelation 11 says these two prophets have a ministry of torment but it's also a time of peace that is made between israel and rome according to daniel 9 verse 27 which says and he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week that's the antichrist making a covenant with the jews and the world for one week or seven years and then finishing verse 27 and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice of the oblation to cease and for the over spreading of abominations he shall make a desolate even until the consummation and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate so the bible is clear that the antichrist pope makes a covenant with the jews and the world for seven years this allows the jews to sacrifice animals for the first half of the seven year covenant because they have a newly rebuilt temple and this is also the first three and a half years of the ministry of the two prophets probably moses and elijah or men anointed with their spirits but it's clear the hundred forty four thousand cannot get sealed with the holy ghost until after the two prophets die and are resurrected then jesus will show himself to the 144 thousand they'll say where did you get your wounds he'll say in the house of my friends they'll weep and go from house to house mourning but then the bible says the nation will be born in one day 144 000 will be born of the holy ghost baptism in one day so here's a visual to show the two instances of weeping and gnashing of teeth notice the foolish virgin have weeping and gnashing of teeth because they have to give their lives as martyrs for christ during the first half of the great seven year tribulation period and here's the second case of weeping and gnashing of teeth this is experienced by all the sinners who took the mark of the beast during the great tribulation period and the third happening in hell which we will show with numerous scriptures and quotes the reason the foolish virgin subject is quite a lesson as brother graham said is because it's part of three mysteries of god as described by the bible itself last year i wrote a book about the 12 new testament mysteries of god which god revealed to brother branham because brother branham fulfilled revelation 10 7 the mystery of god had to be finished before the end time so the subject of the foolish virgins is found in at least three or perhaps four new testament mysteries the first is the new testament church as the bride of christ the reason the foolish virgins are part of this mystery is because they're not the bride of christ because they have not been born again in their souls by the baptism of the holy ghost they don't have the oil of the baptism of the holy ghost according to the parable of the 10 virgins in matthew 25 verses 1 through 13. a second mystery the foolish virgin is a part of is the mystery of godliness because the mystery of godliness shows how godliness or the anointing and character of christ is restored to man as soon as a christian is saved he has the anointing of faith and as the stature of a perfect man teaches you must get seven anointings before your being is capped off with charity which is the baptism of the holy ghost so foolish virgins have at least the anointing of faith but they can also get the anointing of virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness and brotherly kindness these seven anointings and then the eighth that caps off the believer's soul is how god restores godliness to man the foolish virgin never completes the stature of a perfect man they never received charity or the baptism of the holy ghost due to their cares of the world as jesus taught in the parable of the foregrounds in mark chapter 4 verse 19. the third mystery is the mystery of christ in you the hope of glory also called the baptism of the holy ghost so the foolish virgin are foolish and do not redeem their time in order to receive the baptism of the holy ghost only the wise virgins redeem their time and obey the word of god to the point where they can be baptized with the holy ghost according to acts 5 verse 32 the scripture says god gives the holy ghost to them that obey him so the foolish virgins didn't obey in everything so god could not fill them with the holy ghost and the fourth mystery is the mystery of the kingdom of heaven the foolish virgins are mentioned in a few of these parables of the kingdom of heaven most notably in the parable of the king son in matthew chapter 22 which we'll show soon and of course the other mention is in the parable of the ten virgins found in matthew 25 verses 1 to 13. so here's the outline for the video we'll first look at defining context and then we'll look at the nine examples from the bible about weeping wailing and gnashing of teeth and lastly we'll listen to brother braham's quotes about this subject defining context friends it's important as we look at the subject of foolish virgins and also weeping wailing and gnashing of teeth to understand context in the dictionary context means the circumstances that form the setting for an event statement or idea and in terms of which it can be fully understood and assessed it also means the parts of something written or spoken that immediately precede and follow a word or passage and clarify its meaning if you look up the word context in the thesaurus it uses similar words like circumstances conditions surroundings or situation and that's what this video is going to do we're going to look at the seven situations in which jesus talked about weeping wailing and gnashing of teeth and also there are two portions of scripture in revelation about wailing and weeping we're going to examine the context of each use looking at the scriptures beforehand and afterward so we can fully understand what the bible's teaching and it's my humble opinion after studying about these praying about them and searching the quotes of brother branham that there have to be three instances of weeping wailing and gnashing of teeth one for the foolish virgins and then one for the sinners who took the mark of the beast and the third happening in hell the nine bible references to weeping wailing and gnashing of teeth friends there are seven instances where the bible talks about weeping wailing and gnashing of teeth but one of them is a parallel passage so there's really six different times it's spoken of in scripture in the four gospels the book of revelation talks about weeping wailing and gnashing of teeth as well which we'll show but let's start by looking at the first instance the first scripture is from matthew 8 verses 10 through 12 and this one has a parallel passage in luke 13 verses 27 through 29 these are the first two bible references to weeping wailing and gnashing of teeth so please read this entire scripture on your own for context but we can clearly see the context of the weeping wailing and gnashing of teeth here is hell because of the surrounding verses and their situations so this is a story about the roman centurion's gentile faith jesus said there would be many which likely refers to gentiles that would come from all four directions to sit next to abraham isaac and jacob in the kingdom of heaven so this sitting next to the three patriarchs would either be the millennium or the new jerusalem and so the weeping and gnashing of teeth seems to be hell in this case because jesus is saying the jews would be cast out of the future millennial reign or the new jerusalem kingdom and in the parallel passage in luke 13 christ called these ones that were cast out workers of iniquity and we know according to matthew 7 verses 21 through 23 jesus said he never knew the workers of iniquity and he said depart from me so of course these workers iniquity would go to hell so again the context is jews who blasphemed and rejected christ it's likely they'll be cast into the lake of fire where there's weeping wailing and gnashing of teeth the third scripture is matthew 13 verses 41 and 42 so the context of this scripture makes it seem like the weeping wailing gnashing of teeth is hell again this is the parable of the wheat and tares and jesus gives us his own interpretation of the parable here jesus says the tares or children of satan are cast into a furnace of fire causing a wailing and gnashing of teeth jesus also called them workers of iniquity which matches the tares with the workers of iniquity that he described again in matthew 7 21-23 so the workers iniquity would be ones who took the mark of the beast and their destiny would be hellfire a fourth scripture is matthew 13 verses 48 through 50 and again the context is likely hell because this is a parable of christ the parable of the net cast into the sea jesus gives the same context the end of the world and also again mentions a furnace of fire meaning the lake of fire after the great white throne judgment and of course he connects us with wailing and gnashing of teeth which speaks of punishment and torment the fifth mention of weeping wailing and gnashing of teeth is matthew 22 13. i believe this is the only scripture out of the six different scriptures that the context means the great tribulation period for the foolish virgins the context is the parable of the king's son and it speaks of a supper for the king's son which means the marriage supper of the lamb as revelation chapter 19 mentions as well and notice in this parable in matthew 22 verses 1 to 14 there's no mention of a furnace of fire so jesus never said those without the wedding garment would be cast into a furnace of fire he just said they would be cast out into outer darkness where there's weeping and gnashing of teeth the fact that the man without the wedding garment was gathered with those who had the wedding garment showed he wanted to be in the rapture or the wedding of jesus christ and his bride church but was speechless and had no testimony of overcoming by the blood of the lamb and had no word for his testimony since the wedding supper symbolizes where the true holy ghost-filled bride goes after the rapture the man that's kicked out without a garment has to go to the great tribulation period or stay upon the earth so we can see how outer darkness symbolizes the great tribulation period there's no more light to the gentiles as jesus said in luke 21 24 the times of the gentiles is over there's no more mercy to the gentiles they've had their day of grace the wild olive branch according to romans 11 has been cut off and the holy branch israel has been grafted back in so the guest without the wedding garment represents believers who respond to preaching about the end times and gather worship with the holy ghost-filled saints but they themselves fail to receive the gift of the holy ghost for more on the subject of the foolish virgin i want to reference two videos that will help you the first is two kinds of christians and two resurrections it's video number 66 on my youtube channel and also a more recent video you can be saved but not born again which is video 101 on my youtube channel as well i want to show two other scriptures that show how the foolish virgin will weep wail and have gnashing of teeth during the tribulation period yet they can still be saved the first is matthew 25 verse 6 and verses 11 through 13 in the parable of the ten virgins notice there was a cry to go meet the bridegroom at midnight so again this is a time of darkness which would match the outer darkness spoken of in the parable of the king's son in matthew chapter 22 and then remember the wise virgins go out to meet the bridegroom while the foolish go get oil will the foolish eventually come to the bridegroom's house and knock and try to get in but the bible says the lord answered and said verily i say unto you i know you not watch therefore for you know neither the day nor the hour wherein the son of man cometh notice jesus never mentions hellfire or furnace of fire for the foolish virgins and the fact that their virgins is a good sign their virgin to christ which means they don't have any spiritual intercourse with idols the foolish versions were true to the word of god that they held and of course they were foolish to go on with the lord and receive the full revelation of the word of god and eventually the baptism of the holy ghost the third scripture that goes along with matthew 22 and matthew 25 1-13 is the scriptural context of revelation chapter 13 verses 11 through 18. this is a portion of scripture about the catholic church working through the united states of america and remember brother branham told us to watch the purple curtain so that's why we watch how the united states government makes laws today as we're watching the us government we're really watching the purple curtain because rome is the beast that rose up out of the sea at the beginning of revelation 13 but also is the same beast that rose up out of the land in the second half of revelation chapter 13. so in revelation chapter 13 verses 12 15 16 and 17 we see the beast or the united states with the satanic anointing of the spirit of rome is giving power to lay down its mark and the foolish virgins then are given a life or death choice and verse 15 says those that don't take the mark should be killed so that completes the three scriptural references where the foolish virgin would have weeping wailing and gnashing of teeth matthew 22 13 matthew 25 verses 1 to 13 and revelation 13 verses 11 through 18. later in this video i'll show quotes where brother rahm says specifically that the foolish virgin will be martyred and will have weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth in the tribulation period the sixth mention of weeping wailing and gnashing of teeth is in matthew 24 verse 51 the context is chapter 24 verses 32 through 51 the context is hell as jesus calls this servant evil in verse 48 this evil servant is not faithful and is not a wise servant as jesus described earlier in the parable this evil servant cannot be the foolish virgin because the foolish virgin would not get drunk alcoholism is an idol it's something people go to that they love more than god they go to alcohol to take care of their problems rather than the mercy and blood of jesus christ also foolish virgins do not smite their people they are god-fearing people like the church age book says here's a quote from chapter 7 where brother brahm says the foolish virgin is a separated god-loving people trying to abide in the word it is the second resurrection wherein the five foolish virgins come up notice that they were virgins they did not have the holy spirit so they missed being in the bride while the five wise who had oil became a part of that bride but these people being a separated god loving people and trying to abide in the word according to what they knew of it and being a help in the work of the lord will come up at the end of time they will miss the millennium which you can begin to see by these truths is much more important and wonderful than we have ever thought or believed jesus also said this evil servant gets a portion with the hypocrites and he gets cut asunder so again foolish virgins are not evil they're virgins but they're just foolish and don't go all the way with god they don't surrender fully to the holy ghost the seventh mention of weeping wailing and gnashing of teeth is matthew 25 30. the context is verses 14 through 30 and the context here again is hell this is the parable of the talents jesus calls this one talent man wicked and slothful this parable is also speaking of reckoning according to verse 19 or judgment or giving account before jesus in his holy presence as i mentioned earlier there are two portions of scripture in revelation about wailing and weeping which i'd like to read and these verses are the eighth and ninth mentions of weeping wailing and gnashing of teeth the last mentions of this subject in the new testament at least according to the verses i could find the first one is revelation 1 verse 7 and the second portion is revelation 18 verses 11 15 and 19. revelation 1 verse 7 says behold he cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him and they also which pierced him and all the kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him even so amen this scripture proves there's wailing at the battle of armageddon for that is the context of this scripture the only time every eye will see jesus is when he returns for the battle of armageddon this is the scripture that shows there's weeping during the second half of the seven year tribulation period when the trumpets are sounding and the vows are being poured out the second portion of scripture from revelation was chapter 18 verses 11 15 and 19 they read and the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her for no man buyeth their merchandise anymore the merchants of these things which were made rich by her shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment weeping and wailing and they cast dust on their heads and cried weeping and wailing saying alas alas that great city wherein were made rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her costliness for in one hour is she made desolate the weeping and mourning of these verses is when the vatican is destroyed and brother brahm told us this would happen through russia bombing the vatican with thus saith the lord this weeping wailing and mourning then would take place during the second half of the seven year great tribulation period as i conclude this section about the nine scripture witnesses a weeping wailing and gnashing of teeth i hope you can see how there's now three instances of weeping wailing and gnashing of teeth the foolish virgins will have to weep whale and gnash their teeth during the first half of the seven years of great tribulation and the sinners who take the mark of the beast will have weeping wailing and gnashing of teeth during the last half of the great tribulation period and also as jesus mentions in the lake of fire quotes from brother branham about weeping wailing and gnashing of teeth friends like numerous subjects within the ministry of william branham the foolish virgin has quotes on both sides just as you have quotes on both sides about the daniel 70 weeks some people think there's only three and a half years left others think there are seven years i believe there are seven years left in daniel's 70 weeks and again i could be wrong but i've written about it in my 2021 book and and i'm looking forward to anyone trying to contact me and help me understand if i'm wrong the first quote i'll start with is the one wherein brother branham says the man with the wedding garment was lost and went to hell this is from questions and answers on the seals 1963. so this is a quote on the side that i would disagree with because i believe according to context the man without the wedding garment was cast in the tribulation period but i believe he could still be saved as you'll see brother branham also agrees with in other quotes so let's listen to this quote from 1963. brother brahms greetings in the name of the lord jesus please explain who the man in matthew 22 11 the man that didn't have on a wedding garment wedding garment on i know this man could couldn't get into heaven without the wedding garment on this was a guest i know not the bride yes that's right he would be again yeah he just slipped in see now look now i i did take a whole sermon on that now i got 10 minutes to pray for to sit and finish this out and i've got one half of them done again that was but i'm going to hurry right back to this now this man had come by some organization back at the window over here some slipping hole and he got into the table and sat down and then when the bridegroom comes up and looks around his uh he these have been objects before now he's the octo what you're doing here like that without the baptism of the holy ghost and all these things how did you ever get in here well uh he come in somewhere besides the door and he come without the proper invitation okay he calmed by some educational system they hear something like that he got in and he said to him find him hand and feet cast him out of here in the outer darkness where there will be weeping and wailing in national teeth he went into the tribulation period he did not come in by the door so all right now let's look at the other side where brother branham says the man with the wedding garment could be saved at the white throne judgment if he gave his life as a martyr during the tribulation period the first one is from the patmos vision december 4th 1960. here brother braham said the foolish virgin would go into the great tribulation period and also called it outer darkness where there would be weeping wailing and gnashing of teeth it's important to note that this was the evening service in the morning service brother branham said the sleeping virgin or foolish virgin would be saved even though they had to endure weeping wailing and gnashing of teeth in other words on the same sunday in which brother adam preached two sermons in the morning he said the foolish virgin was saved and then the evening service said the foolish virgin would have to endure weeping wailing and gnashing of teeth let's listen to the first quote brother venom are the five foolish virgins of matthew 25 counted as the gentile remnant i understand that the five foolish virgins were saved but had to go through the great tribulation period is this correct if so what will be their final destination could they be the sheep which are divided from the goats in matthew 25 33 and 34. pretty good theologian according to what i have think of too that they are the remnant the sleeping virgin is the remnant spoke of in revelation of the woman's seed that keeps the commandments of god and have the testimony of jesus christ a woman will take a a piece of goods and lay it down well now that is what she's cutting her uh takes her pattern and lays anywhere she desires which way she's going to cut that and then what she has left over is called the remnant but she chooses to cut it from a certain place by her own free thinking but what's left over is called the remnant now if you notice there were five foolish and five wise virgins all of them as virgins made all the same material but by election god chose his bride by election before the foundation of the world put their names on the lamb's book of life slain before the foundation of the world before the world ever began god in his mind in infinite so then the foolish virgin was the one who did not have oil in her lamp that i believe that was cast out in the outer darkness whether it be weeping wedding and as you can see you think you'll compare that or your footnotes write right back again to the great tribulation now i think they're the ones that stays back and goes through the great tribulation quite a lesson there we had time to go into it now back to this remnant before we leave the question i hope i get it clear this uh i truly believe that the remnant is chosen by god i i believe it that god chose the remnant before the foundation of the world and has by his poor knowledge now let's listen to the second quote that brother branham spoke earlier in the morning service in the sermon called the revelation of jesus christ here he said the sleeping virgin or foolish virgin were saved yet they had weeping wailing and gnashing of teeth let's listen to the it be a quote time for the jews who rejected him as messiah but it'd be a mournful time for them left gentiles back here who has accepted who has rejected him as their messiah they'll be wailing and weeping the sleeping virgin will be wailing that's that church that refused to get oral in his life there were ten virgins went out all good people but five of them had oral in their land the other five were good people good people but failed to get oral in their land and they were cast down into outer darkness where to be weeping wailing and gnashing of teeth here it is they'll be wailing the bible says you're they'll be wailing and so broken-hearted until even just like the virgin the word virgin is pure holy i'm adultery thank you bye five head on five did not follow the field and now you can be saved without being sanctified you can be thanked if i have not had the holy ghost all right and notice he says you could be saved without being sanctified that'd be the foolish virgin who just had the anointing of faith and then he also said you can be sanctified and not have the holy ghost in other words you could have faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness and still not have charity which is the baptism of the holy ghost which is also the capping of the building of god or your vessel or your being next let's look at two quotes from 1961. in the first one from god being misunderstood brother branham is asked now were the five of the virgins lost brother ram says they were not lost he said they had to suffer persecution and be martyred so this is why i believe the man who didn't have the wedding garment could be cast into outer darkness suffer be martyred but still be saved at the white throne judgment let's listen to the quote now were the five of the virgins lost i presume that they are asking the questions the five virgins the five wise and the five foolish now if you were with us in the last teachings in revelations you find out there that those virgins the the five foolish virgins were not lost but they were not permitted to go into the wedding supper but they suffered persecution and was martyred and raised again as the general resurrection in the last days those are the people where he separated the sheep from the goats see they stood before judgment here's the second quote from questions and answers 1961 october 15th the morning service brother bran plainly said the foolish virgins will be saved at the white throne judgment let's listen to the quote i see brother what happens to the people that are are considered the sleeping virgin when they are judged at the judgment well the sleeping virgin will be saved of course should be saved at the gentleman she'll never be the bride but she is a saved group of people that will come in the judgment that will not be included in the bride but as long as they are virgins they are before god see they are to be saved he separates they'll be the sheep on his right side and the unsaved will be the goats on his leg at the great white throne judgment extend a lot of time on that but it's getting a little late in closing friends i hope this video has been a blessing this video was actually recommended to me by a wonderful brother in the lord named brother russ so i want to thank you brother russ for suggesting this topic i'm sure it will help numerous people and hope you're able to share it with those who had questions about this subject friends as brother branham said this is quite a lesson the bible is a deep eternal book we should be constantly seeking god for more of the same revelation brother branham talked about in the church age book god cannot give a different revelation he gives one revelation but then he gives more information about the same revelation that's what we're seeing today here we are 56 years after brother brown left this scene but more scriptures are being given to us as more information from the holy ghost so we can understand the wise and foolish virgins so we can understand the purple curtain so we can understand the stature of perfect man the correct way and all these other wonderful subjects including all the mysteries of god as revelation 10 verse 7 says the mystery of god should be finished in this last day i'll close by saying friends let's redeem the time the wise virgin redeems the time devote more of your time to prayer bible study seeking the face of god through prayer and surely god will honor your faith and baptize your soul with his holy ghost the rapture is more near than ever before and the bride is making herself ready right now and let's remember to pray for our lost loved ones let's remember to pray for the foolish virgins as abraham prayed for lot if god honored abraham's prayer for lot and lot was saved then surely he's the same yesterday today and forever and god will honor our prayers and we'll see some of our lost loved ones be saved they'll become foolish virgins by the grace of god and hopefully some become wise virgins as well if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me god bless you and may jesus christ be the desire of your heart
