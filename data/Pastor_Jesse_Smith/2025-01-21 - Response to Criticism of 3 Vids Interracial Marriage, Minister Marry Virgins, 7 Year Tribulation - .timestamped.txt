[0:02] there's no great ones Among Us there's
[0:05] only one great one and that's God we are
[0:08] brothers
[0:11] sisters greetings friends in the
[0:13] matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[0:16] the purpose of this video is to respond
[0:18] to some recent criticism I've been given
[0:20] on three of my videos so I'm going to do
[0:22] that with the Brotherly Love of Jesus
[0:24] Christ and this is also a great
[0:25] opportunity to rightly divide the word
[0:27] of Truth hi friends I'm Jesse Smith
[0:29] pastor PR of Christ Fellowship here in
[0:31] akan Ohio USA and I defend the original
[0:33] Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ that he
[0:35] revealed to St Paul then had to restore
[0:37] through Martin Luther John Wesley and
[0:39] the late Prophet brother William maram
[0:41] brandham who lived from 1909 to 1965 and
[0:44] also defend brother Ram's Godly
[0:45] Christian character here's the outline
[0:47] for this video first we'll look at the
[0:49] three videos that I was rebuked for by a
[0:52] famous message Pastor here in America
[0:54] and then we'll look at the specific
[0:57] accusations and my responses and then
[1:00] we'll look at some important quotes from
[1:01] God's Prophet brother
[1:03] brandom before starting the first
[1:06] segment let's talk about brotherly
[1:07] kindness uh Hebrews 13:1 says let
[1:10] Brotherly Love continue so I'm going to
[1:12] do my best in this video in my response
[1:15] to criticism about myself to show
[1:17] Brotherly Love of Jesus Christ I'm not
[1:20] going to call the name of this famous
[1:21] preacher some of you might be able to
[1:22] figure it out of course but from the
[1:25] sermon segment that I saw there was a
[1:28] brother who shared three three of my
[1:30] videos with this famous preacher I wish
[1:33] the brother who shared the videos would
[1:35] have contacted me first but I don't know
[1:37] the man's motive or objective so both
[1:40] the famous preacher and the man that
[1:42] shared my videos with the famous
[1:44] preacher both of you are free to reach
[1:46] out to me I leave my email on every
[1:48] single video I'm open to conversations
[1:51] discussions brother Ram taught us that
[1:53] love is corrective so if these brothers
[1:56] have the love of God feel free to reach
[1:57] out to me I'll be happy to talk about
[1:59] these topics by God's grace now what's
[2:01] interesting though is that over these
[2:03] last few years it's been my observation
[2:05] that this famous preacher who has called
[2:08] me out and rebuked me called me
[2:09] different names he's in the goat message
[2:12] group of preachers what I mean by that
[2:14] is they take turns calling themselves
[2:16] the greatest preachers of all time they
[2:19] go from each other's pulpits back and
[2:22] forth and compliment each other very
[2:24] highly they exalt and rank themselves
[2:26] above all the current preachers and even
[2:29] all the preachers of all time sadly I
[2:32] have a video about this from
[2:34] 2022 called our message Christians the
[2:37] greatest Christians of all time the
[2:39] bride Pride message goat debate I'll
[2:42] leave a link to that video in the
[2:43] description by God's grace of course I
[2:46] have recordings of all these preachers
[2:47] calling themselves the greatest of all
[2:49] time so I believe uh one of two things
[2:52] either these preachers in this goat
[2:53] message group are either not born again
[2:55] because Jesus's disciples were debating
[2:57] who was the greatest before they were
[2:58] born again in the gospels or they are
[3:01] born again but they've developed an
[3:03] awful sinful Pride complex because
[3:06] brother Ram said pride is a very awful
[3:08] sin to have and then they feed off of
[3:10] each other with praise and exaltation
[3:13] and they fail to correct one another
[3:14] apparently is what it seems but remember
[3:17] God will abase the proud but gives grace
[3:20] to the humble and I honestly believe
[3:22] it's my humble opinion I've already seen
[3:24] God bring humility to a few of these gr
[3:26] preachers through different things that
[3:27] have happened very publicly very sad
[3:30] things but that's just my opinion so
[3:32] here's the three videos I was rebuked
[3:34] for you probably saw on the
[3:36] thumbnail the latest was order of events
[3:39] of the 7-year Great Tribulation period
[3:42] this was released December 28
[3:44] 2024 so about 6 days after I released
[3:46] this video this famous preacher preached
[3:49] on all three of these videos regarding
[3:51] this video he said anyone that knows
[3:53] what God's Prophet taught knows better
[3:55] than that basically saying brother
[3:57] Braham taught the tribulation was three
[3:58] and a half years after the seals and
[4:01] that's true but it's only partly true
[4:03] because four times in the
[4:06] 1961 Daniel 70 week sermon brother Ram
[4:09] said there's one week left for the Jews
[4:11] four times he said that and brother Ram
[4:13] never said thus sayith the Lord there's
[4:15] only three and a half years left for the
[4:17] tribulation period for the Jews so I
[4:19] believe this uh famous preacher is
[4:21] majoring on a minor because Daniel 70
[4:23] weeks is not related to Salvation for
[4:25] any of us especially Gentiles so
[4:27] basically this preacher is saying
[4:28] anything after the SE seals is inspired
[4:30] thus say the Lord of course that's wrong
[4:33] I could say the same thing about
[4:34] 1977 brother Ram taught by
[4:38] 1977 the US would be destroyed and just
[4:40] tree stumps left by 1977 of course that
[4:44] did not come to pass that was just a
[4:45] human prediction but he believed it
[4:47] after the opening of the seventh seals
[4:49] so you can't just say everything brother
[4:51] Bram believed after the seals was
[4:53] correct that's not true you still have
[4:55] to do the word test the prophet test and
[4:57] see what was spoken with thus sayith the
[4:58] Lord you could say the same thing about
[5:00] Joseph brandham brother Bram believed he
[5:01] was a prophet even after the seals and
[5:03] Joseph brandham is no Prophet there's no
[5:05] proof of that also the Martin Luther
[5:07] King Junior prediction where he'd lead
[5:09] Millions to a death trap brother Brandon
[5:10] was asked specifically was that prophecy
[5:12] and he said no I have nothing on it from
[5:14] the Lord and that did not come to pass
[5:17] Martin Luther King Jr did not start a
[5:19] race war in the South that killed
[5:21] millions of people he did not so it's
[5:23] obvious here the famous preacher didn't
[5:25] cite the four quotes where brother Ram
[5:27] says there's a week left to the Jews and
[5:29] Israel so let's listen to those right
[5:31] now it's from paragraph 95 paragraph 105
[5:34] paragraph 162 and paragraph 165 I also
[5:38] have these quotes on the podcast I put
[5:40] out today about the order of events of
[5:42] the sevene tribulation period so I just
[5:46] want to make people aware of that you
[5:47] I'll leave a link to that in the
[5:48] description as well let's listen to the
[5:50] four quotes now if they've already had
[5:53] 69 weeks and lived it exactly the way
[5:57] God said it did and happened exactly the
[5:59] way God said it would do then there's
[6:01] one more weak promise to the Jews well
[6:04] God did with the Jews just exactly what
[6:07] he said he would do and then 69 years uh
[6:11] it was 483 years but 69 weeks one week
[6:14] left one week yet determined now when's
[6:17] God going to start their last
[6:19] week when it may be
[6:23] today it may be before the sun sets
[6:26] tonight now if these exactly what seven
[6:30] years each one of the weeks and we've
[6:32] already had 69 weeks then we have the
[6:34] Gentile age and we're nowh at the end of
[6:37] the Gentile AGS and there's one more
[6:38] week left for the Jew is that right and
[6:41] that's exactly seven
[6:43] years if this was seven years that's
[6:46] seven years because he said there's 70
[6:49] weeks determined upon thy people so we
[6:51] know we got seven years for the Jews is
[6:53] that true I look at it if it's a
[6:55] question I want to know it see so now we
[6:58] can see friends the famous preacher
[6:59] didn't let us know that there's four
[7:01] quotes on the other side so is he really
[7:04] saying what brother random said also
[7:06] their math calculation won't work if
[7:08] they believe there's only 3 and 1/2
[7:11] years left for that to be true Jesus
[7:13] would have had to die to around 33 or 34
[7:16] ad but brother R's math calculation he
[7:18] gave in the Daniel 70 weeks doesn't go
[7:21] to 33 or 34 ad it goes to 30 ad or 31 ad
[7:25] so you have to look at Daniel 9:26
[7:28] messiah's cut off after three score in 2
[7:30] weeks or 62 weeks plus the 7 weeks that
[7:34] took from the announcement of the
[7:35] rebuilding of Jerusalem till the wall
[7:36] was finished brother Ram said you got to
[7:38] start at 445 BC when you had 69 weeks
[7:42] you come to 38 ad but then brother Ram
[7:44] said you got to subtract 7 years because
[7:46] prophetic years are shorter than solar
[7:48] years and you come to 30 or 31 ad the
[7:51] Messiah was cut off after the 69th week
[7:54] of Daniel's 70 weeks so there still has
[7:56] to be 7 years left so this famous
[7:59] preacher and many preachers it seems
[8:00] like are taking their quotes over the
[8:03] word-based math calculations that
[8:05] brother randam gave us they're making
[8:07] the quotes the absolute instead of the
[8:09] word of God the absolute so this is a
[8:11] form of idolatry and I'm still waiting
[8:13] no one's ever disproved this simple math
[8:15] calculation to me it's based again upon
[8:17] Daniel 9:26 messiah's cut off after 69
[8:21] weeks that means there's 7 years left
[8:23] for Israel the second video was
[8:26] interracial marriage June 27 202 2 the
[8:30] famous preacher said brother Bram never
[8:32] said what I said on the video well
[8:33] that's only partially true what I said
[8:35] on the video was my own opinion about
[8:37] why I think brother Ram was so dogmatic
[8:39] about no interracial marriage I put two
[8:42] reasons on the video first because
[8:43] interracial marriage was illegal until
[8:45] 1967 so of course brother brand would
[8:47] urge the people not to do something
[8:49] illegal and then second trying to
[8:51] protect the people I believe because of
[8:52] all the violence the racial violence
[8:54] that was going on during brother Ram's
[8:55] lifetime so yes that wasn't on brother
[8:57] Ram's tapes but what was on brother
[8:59] Ram's tapes was that brother Ram said
[9:01] God chose Zapora for Moses so God chose
[9:05] to have an interracial marriage and
[9:06] that's just one of at least five
[9:08] examples so if Jesus Christ is the same
[9:10] yesterday today and forever and God
[9:12] chose Zapora for Moses God chose to do
[9:14] an interracial marriage then there will
[9:16] be times that God will today choose to
[9:19] do interracial marriages and the other
[9:21] four examples are Joseph and azth Hebrew
[9:24] Egyptian Rahab Canaanite and salmon or
[9:27] Salon Boaz and Ruth the moabit and
[9:30] yuriah the hittite and basba so the word
[9:33] cannot fail the word is the absolute so
[9:35] if the word allows interracial marriages
[9:37] or International marriages and Christ is
[9:40] the same forever then he has to allow it
[9:42] today as well sometimes he'll choose to
[9:44] do that but of course not every time so
[9:46] the famous preacher didn't address a lot
[9:48] of what was on my video probably didn't
[9:49] even watch my video to its full extent
[9:52] then the famous preacher said brother
[9:53] RAM used the word to teach interracial
[9:55] marriage and no he didn't he never
[9:57] taught a full sermon on this topic he
[9:59] didn't teach a full sermon on it like
[10:01] marriage and divorce seven Church ages
[10:03] Seven Seals anointed ones at the end
[10:05] times the token the mark of the beast
[10:08] and the Seal of God all these major
[10:09] topics brother never taught one specific
[10:11] bible-based sermon on interracial
[10:13] marriage the third video was that New
[10:16] Testament ministers are not required to
[10:18] marry virgins I release this December
[10:20] 11th 2021 and again the famous preacher
[10:23] never address the six reasons why I
[10:25] believe this teaching is scriptural
[10:27] anyone who studies the Bible closely
[10:29] we'll see that ministers had to marry
[10:31] virgins for the Jews only not the
[10:33] Gentiles the Jews only brother random
[10:36] used Ezekiel
[10:38] 4422 to talk about ministers marrying
[10:40] virgins but then brother random also
[10:42] said that was for the Jews in the
[10:44] Millennium he said that in the six-fold
[10:46] purpose of Gabriel's visit to Daniel
[10:48] 1961 brother Ram said anyone any reader
[10:51] that knows Ezekiel the 40th chapter
[10:53] until about the 44th is nothing in the
[10:55] world but the Millennium temple being
[10:57] erected on Earth so brother said anyone
[10:59] knows Ezekiel 44 is for the Jews the
[11:01] millennial Temple for Israel so yes
[11:04] Israeli priests during the Millennium
[11:06] will be required to marry virgins or a
[11:09] widow of a priest and of course when the
[11:11] priest had married the wife the wife was
[11:13] a virgin let's listen to the quote now
[11:15] watch description of the
[11:18] temple that is to be built in the
[11:21] Millennium now anyone any reader that
[11:24] knows that from Ezekiel the 40th chapter
[11:27] until about the 44th chapter
[11:29] is nothing in the world but the
[11:31] Millennium temple being erected on Earth
[11:33] anyone knows that see when the glory of
[11:35] the Lord fills it and so forth like that
[11:38] before moving on I just want to share
[11:39] this quote from questions and ANS 63
[11:42] brother R says you might have a
[11:43] different interpretation on these
[11:45] questions he said just go right ahead
[11:47] that won't hurt because not only but
[11:49] about one or two of them pertains
[11:51] anything to Salvation so brother Ram
[11:53] says his answers won't hurt you because
[11:55] they don't pertain to Salvation if you
[11:57] see things differently than him so so
[11:59] interracial marriage does not pertain to
[12:01] Salvation a 7-year tribulation period
[12:03] does not pertain to Salvation and
[12:05] ministers Maring virgins does not
[12:06] pertain to Salvation so we know if
[12:09] someone had a different interpretation
[12:10] than brother brandom on these topics
[12:12] outside of Salvation it wouldn't hurt
[12:14] brother brandom but why does it hurt the
[12:16] current message preachers again I
[12:18] believe because they have a spirit of
[12:19] Pride perhaps their pride is hurt
[12:22] because they failed to study deeply on
[12:24] these topics maybe they feel exposed
[12:26] because remember they don't reply to me
[12:29] they don't ask me questions they don't
[12:30] try to correct me about the Bible verses
[12:32] and quotes that I use all these videos
[12:35] have quotes that support what I'm
[12:37] teaching and Believing by the grace of
[12:39] God so let's listen to this quote from
[12:41] questions and answers on the seals now
[12:44] for the first one now I'll try to answer
[12:47] them and then if if I don't get it right
[12:48] but you you forgive me then and if you
[12:51] have a different interpretation and
[12:52] believe it your idea of it's right if
[12:55] you go right ahead that won't hurt the C
[12:58] not over about one or two of them it
[12:59] pertains anything to Salvation it's only
[13:01] most of the questions is asked on this
[13:04] other side of the tri uh on the Rapture
[13:07] of the church so see now let's look at
[13:09] accusations from the video the first
[13:11] accusation is that the famous preacher
[13:13] says I'm replacing brother brandham the
[13:15] preacher said I'm making a superior
[13:18] position for myself replacing our church
[13:20] age messenger and friends this is simply
[13:22] ridiculous this proves this famous
[13:24] preacher knows nothing about me I've
[13:26] been preaching for 20 years 18 of those
[13:28] have been pastoring I always use brother
[13:30] Bram quotes for all my beliefs all my
[13:33] preaching cuz brother Bram was pointing
[13:35] us back to the Bible he hasn't watched
[13:37] all my 400 plus videos on YouTube over
[13:39] the last 10 years or the 100 plus
[13:42] podcasts I put out hasn't listened to
[13:44] those likely hasn't read my two books
[13:46] knows nothing about me so this is a
[13:48] ridiculous statement I never take credit
[13:50] for any Revelation and I did a few
[13:53] Revelation videos last year but but it
[13:56] was just more information about the same
[13:58] Revelations like water baptism serpent
[13:59] seed in the seals I am no Prophet I
[14:02] never say thus sayi the Lord and this
[14:04] famous preacher doesn't realize I agree
[14:06] with the majority of brother braham's
[14:08] teachings I always say I'm open to
[14:10] correction just like brother brandham
[14:11] said he was open to correction I always
[14:13] use brother bram's quotes and the Bible
[14:15] verses so this is an unfair accusation
[14:18] from the famous preacher who doesn't
[14:20] even know me doesn't even reach out to
[14:22] me to ask questions and try to
[14:23] understand or seek clarification humbly
[14:27] last year I put out a video on the
[14:28] hundred 10 differences between the
[14:30] message and denominational churches and
[14:33] in that list of 110 were these three
[14:35] videos so I went through that list again
[14:37] and it seemed like those three were the
[14:38] only three I might have disagreed with
[14:40] this famous preacher and maybe his group
[14:42] of friends so that's a
[14:45] 97% agreement rate which is very good
[14:48] and it's likely much higher cuz I could
[14:50] have went on to hundreds of other false
[14:52] doctrines that we in the message have
[14:54] right that are that we correct from
[14:56] denominational churches so it's a simply
[14:59] ridiculous statement to make that I'm
[15:01] replacing brother Bram the reality is
[15:03] brother brandham said every Doctrine
[15:04] must be taken back to the scripture and
[15:06] so it seems his famous preacher and his
[15:08] preacher friends have not even taken
[15:10] these teachings back to scripture they
[15:13] haven't looked at all the quotes they
[15:14] haven't addressed all the quotes and
[15:16] then the next idea is that there's major
[15:18] doctrines versus minor of course major
[15:21] doctrines are like salvation the baptism
[15:22] of the Holy Ghost these three videos I
[15:25] put out are all minors and if the famous
[15:27] preacher and his friends make the these
[15:29] Majors then they've misunderstood the
[15:31] message they don't understand brother
[15:32] bram's quotes like they claimed to
[15:34] brother Ram even said the Rapture was a
[15:35] minor because it doesn't pertain to
[15:37] Salvation he said that how can I
[15:39] overcome
[15:40] 1963 brother man said he appreciated
[15:43] this man that had a different opinion
[15:44] than him on the coming of the Lord he
[15:46] said but it's okay it doesn't pertain to
[15:49] Salvation let's listen to the quote but
[15:51] I I can't agree with him because I don't
[15:53] see it but the it doesn't pertain to
[15:56] Salvation it's pertaining to the coming
[15:59] of the Lord he sees that the church has
[16:01] to go through the tribulation period for
[16:05] purification I say the blood of Jesus
[16:07] Christ purify the church the second
[16:10] accusation is that I'm wasting people's
[16:12] time and my own time of course this is a
[16:14] false accusation this is ridiculous
[16:16] there's no better use of my time than to
[16:18] rightly divide the word of Truth as
[16:20] commanded by 2 Timothy 2:15 and also to
[16:23] give myself wholly unto the study of
[16:25] God's word according to 1 Timothy 4:1
[16:27] 12-16
[16:29] numerous people over the years have
[16:30] reached out to me and thank me for all
[16:33] the videos but I've certainly received
[16:35] specific positive feedback about
[16:37] interracial marriage and ministers not
[16:39] marrying virgins so how could it be a
[16:41] waste of time if people are being healed
[16:43] strengthened edified in the word of God
[16:45] it's not a waste of time what is a waste
[16:47] of time is the famous preacher rebuking
[16:49] me without contacting me and not digging
[16:52] down into these subjects and really
[16:53] pointing the people back to the word of
[16:55] God what's sad is that the famous
[16:57] preacher didn't mention any of the good
[16:59] videos that he might have agreed with
[17:00] that I've done like how brother Ram's a
[17:02] prophet of God brother Ram had thus say
[17:03] the Lord's that came to pass water
[17:05] baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus
[17:07] Christ God's one person so it's likely
[17:09] this famous preacher has a critical
[17:11] spirit because Proverbs 1720 says he
[17:14] that hath a frowed heart findeth no good
[17:17] when you can't find something good about
[17:18] a person you've got a critical spirit
[17:21] now I should say this too this famous
[17:22] preacher is probably my favorite
[17:24] preacher to listen to and I'm not
[17:26] exalting him but I just learn so much
[17:27] from him he uses lots of great quotes
[17:29] lots of great scriptures very emotional
[17:31] very charismatic and no one's helped me
[17:34] more in this message than this famous
[17:36] preacher but then I find myself a couple
[17:37] weeks ago hearing myself rebuke for
[17:39] different videos that I've made but
[17:41] that's fine I'm going to express the
[17:42] Brotherly Love of Jesus Christ I'm not
[17:43] going to name call him I'm going to call
[17:45] my brother although he calls me a note
[17:48] head idiotic and other terms I'm not
[17:51] going to return that I'm going to show
[17:52] Grace because God has shown me so much
[17:54] grace but a warning for this famous
[17:56] preacher would be Proverbs 18:13 he that
[17:58] that answers a matter before he heareth
[18:00] it it's a Folly and shame unto him so
[18:02] did the famous preacher listen to all
[18:03] three of those videos all the way
[18:05] through and then pray about the quotes
[18:07] pray about the scriptures I don't know
[18:09] that's between the famous preacher and
[18:10] God but it is a shame and Folly if
[18:12] someone doesn't do that and that's
[18:15] according to the thus sayith the lord of
[18:16] the word of God the third accusation he
[18:19] said is I'm a know- it all the famous
[18:21] preacher said he knows so much about
[18:23] everything there is to know he said how
[18:25] can you know more than your church age
[18:27] messenger that's ridiculous these are
[18:30] three minor topics these are not major
[18:32] topics they don't relate to Salvation so
[18:35] if I don't see everything the same as
[18:36] brother Brandon on minor things that's
[18:37] not an issue at all I don't know more
[18:40] than brother brandom I just have a
[18:41] different opinion as I've said on my
[18:43] videos in regarding opinions brother BR
[18:45] said his opinion was no better than
[18:47] anybody else's he said that in marriage
[18:49] and divorce
[18:51] 1965 he said my opinion is just like
[18:54] anybody else's this famous preacher
[18:57] claims to believe everything brother
[18:58] says but apparently he doesn't because
[19:01] the famous preacher says I'll take
[19:02] brother Ram's opinion over my own even
[19:04] and that sounds really Noble but it's
[19:06] not because an opinion is just a human
[19:08] thought it's not thus sayith the Lord if
[19:10] brother Ram didn't give us thus sayith
[19:12] the Lord on a certain topic then we're
[19:13] entitled to our own opinion but it's got
[19:15] to be based on the word of God and all
[19:16] these videos I made are based upon the
[19:18] word of God scores and scores of
[19:20] scriptures on these videos so let's
[19:22] listen the brother Ram's quote from
[19:23] marriage and divorce
[19:24] 1965 now remember these things that I
[19:28] say must come from the word of
[19:32] God it can't be my own opinion because
[19:35] my opinion just like anybody else's but
[19:38] it's got to be in continuity with the
[19:41] word of God
[19:42] remember God keeps everything in
[19:45] continuity he never changes he's the
[19:49] same yesterday today and forever so
[19:52] friends after the famous preacher called
[19:53] me a know-it-all he also called what I
[19:55] was doing hogwash and then he said this
[19:58] name call and bashing of me and
[20:00] preachers that believe what I believe
[20:01] was his present to their church cuz he
[20:04] didn't give them a Christmas present and
[20:06] then they all clap and rejoice over this
[20:08] name calling and bashing without any
[20:10] support for his beliefs other than his
[20:12] quotes from brother Brandon that he uses
[20:14] but of course he leaves out all the
[20:15] other quotes from brother brandom so
[20:17] again friends his main weapon is name
[20:20] calling in this situation but hopefully
[20:22] he'll preach a sermon maybe later on
[20:23] these subjects soon I don't know I hope
[20:25] so I'll be listening because I always
[20:26] listen to this famous preacher he's one
[20:28] of my favorite preachers to listen to
[20:30] and of course he's welcome to reach out
[20:31] to me personally about these things
[20:34] let's go to the next section important
[20:35] quotes from God's Prophet brother
[20:36] brandham brother Bram said no man has
[20:38] all the answers no man is 100% correct
[20:41] but yet this famous preacher and all his
[20:42] buddies that's what they basically say
[20:44] they're basically saying brother brandom
[20:46] has everything right don't ever say or
[20:48] believe anything different than every
[20:50] single word on the tape is basically
[20:52] what they're saying I don't have
[20:53] everything 100% brother Bram said he
[20:55] doesn't have all the answers this famous
[20:57] preacher doesn't have all the answers
[20:58] answers so why is this famous preacher
[21:00] so aggressive and hostile I don't know
[21:03] it could be again a pride complex cuz he
[21:05] has no Bible proof he's only using name
[21:08] calling but let's listen to Three quotes
[21:10] brother Ram said he doesn't have all the
[21:11] answers his answers are not infallible
[21:14] he says but he knows the scriptures are
[21:16] infallible he says if I make mistakes
[21:18] you pray for me I'm not infallible I'm
[21:20] your brother let's listen to the quotes
[21:22] according to the opening of The Fifth
[21:25] Fifth seal Moses and Elijah have have to
[21:30] die what about
[21:32] Enoch I don't know I I if I don't know
[21:36] I'm just going to tell you I don't know
[21:37] see I I don't I don't know all the
[21:39] answers folks I I don't know and if I
[21:42] don't know I'm going to tell you I don't
[21:43] know if I do know I won't tell you till
[21:46] I do know see but I I don't know I've
[21:48] often wondered about that myself and
[21:52] these answers are not infallible see
[21:55] because the scriptures is infallible
[21:59] and as far as I know they're line with
[22:02] the scriptures I hope that makes it
[22:05] plain and the tape is to be uh kept now
[22:08] and anyone would want it
[22:11] well could have it but now I know the
[22:15] scriptures are infallible but my answers
[22:18] are not infallible so I'm sure everyone
[22:21] understands that and if it's not um if
[22:24] it's not infallible then you have a
[22:26] right maybe to ask me
[22:29] at any
[22:30] time if I make mistakes you pray for me
[22:33] I'm not infallible I'm your brother see
[22:37] God just revealed to his Prophet that
[22:40] what he wants them to know nothing
[22:45] else prophets are not infallible people
[22:49] prophets are not easy they are man the
[22:53] next point is brother Ram said never put
[22:55] a period after your beliefs which means
[22:57] we must grow in Revelation we must
[22:59] continue to seek God and grow in the
[23:00] revelation of the Lord Brother R said
[23:02] this in Queen of Sheba 1960 birth pains
[23:05] 1965 and then the church age book he
[23:07] says God will give more information on
[23:09] the same Revelation so that's what I
[23:11] believe God has shown me and other
[23:13] preachers regarding the tribulation
[23:16] Daniel 70 weeks marriage and divorce
[23:18] interracial marriage God's just given us
[23:20] more information scriptural information
[23:22] on the same Revelation and on some of
[23:25] these topics if brother Ram didn't have
[23:26] a thus sayth the Lord then it wasn't the
[23:28] re ration from God on that particular
[23:30] topic so in other words it wasn't God's
[23:32] time to reveal that Revelation so we're
[23:35] just doing the best we can to rightly
[23:36] divide the word of Truth and just live
[23:38] such a good Christian life so close to
[23:41] Jesus Christ doing the best we can by
[23:42] the grace of God let's listen to the
[23:44] quotes you got room for God Amen don't
[23:49] never end your Doctrine with a with a
[23:51] period end it with a comma we believe
[23:55] this plus as much as the Lord will show
[23:57] us
[24:00] God can't give a first revelation then a
[24:02] second Revelation if he did he would be
[24:05] changing his mind he can give a
[24:07] revelation and then add to it as he did
[24:09] in the Garden of Eden when he promised
[24:11] the seed to the woman and then later
[24:14] designated that seed had to come through
[24:16] Abraham and then later said it would
[24:18] come by the same Bloodlines in David but
[24:21] it was the same Revelation it only gave
[24:24] the people more information to help them
[24:26] receive and understand it but God's word
[24:29] can't
[24:30] change also there's quotes brother Ram
[24:32] said men would come after him and make
[24:34] more sense of the message and of course
[24:37] that would mean just more information of
[24:39] the same Revelation so let's listen to
[24:41] that quote from birth
[24:42] pains these men if they pick up this and
[24:45] go out with it they can make more sense
[24:47] to it see to bring it to a place you
[24:48] would I just want to lay this seat hope
[24:51] they make it come to life notice another
[24:54] point is brother Ram never said thus
[24:55] sayith the Lord on these topics I think
[24:57] I might have mentioned that before but
[24:58] he never said thus sayith the Lord 3 and
[25:00] 1/2 years is left for the tribulation he
[25:02] never said thus sayith the Lord a new
[25:04] testament Minister have to has to marry
[25:06] a virgin and he never said thus sayith
[25:07] the Lord interracial marriage is always
[25:10] wrong he never said that I'll do a
[25:12] couple more quotes here brother Ram said
[25:14] every Doctrine and everything else in
[25:15] the Bible must be based upon the word of
[25:18] God I have videos of this famous
[25:19] preacher saying you don't need a
[25:21] scripture for everything we believe from
[25:23] God's Prophet Yet brother brah says the
[25:25] opposite he says everything every
[25:27] Doctrine
[25:28] everything else we must have a scripture
[25:30] for it so this is from 1957 of course so
[25:33] why isn't this famous message preacher
[25:35] willing to take every Doctrine back to
[25:37] the word of God if he did perhaps he'd
[25:39] change his stance on these three topics
[25:42] no interracial marriage is not found one
[25:44] place in the Bible the absolute marrying
[25:47] virgins is only found in two places
[25:48] Deuteronomy 21 I think and then Ezekiel
[25:50] 44 but it's both to the Jews it's not to
[25:54] New Testament Gentile Holy Ghost filled
[25:56] Believers let's listen to the quote from
[25:58] 57 every Doctrine and everything else of
[26:02] the Bible that we have in the church
[26:04] must be based up on the word of
[26:07] God must come from the word not just one
[26:12] place but from Genesis to Revelations it
[26:16] must say the same
[26:18] thing because we cannot base our
[26:21] thoughts upon one little
[26:24] scripture for the Bible said in the
[26:26] mouth of two or three Witnesses let
[26:28] every word be established the last quote
[26:31] I'll use is a pretty well-known quote
[26:32] from here ye hymn 1960 brother Ram says
[26:35] if Satan can't keep you from seeing the
[26:38] real thing of God he'll push you off the
[26:39] deep end with it and make you go to a
[26:41] fanatic so I believe this famous message
[26:43] preacher and his group of goat preachers
[26:46] are so close to being a fanatical
[26:48] worshipper of every word on brother
[26:50] Ram's tapes this famous preacher and his
[26:52] friends they have this similarity with
[26:54] brandham Tabernacle they're both saying
[26:56] they're the greatest Christians of all
[26:58] time time or the greatest preachers of
[26:59] all time that's got to be Pride brother
[27:01] Ram said don't never do that don't never
[27:03] call each other great so why aren't they
[27:05] doing what the prophet said why are they
[27:07] ignoring this quote from God's Prophet
[27:10] sometimes great guys get together you
[27:12] hear them say great so and so and great
[27:14] someone's oh are great don't never do
[27:17] that there's no great ones Among Us
[27:20] there's only one great one and that's
[27:22] God we are brothers sisters I don't care
[27:26] if you're a pastor or church got five
[27:27] people
[27:29] that don't make you
[27:30] little that makes you a
[27:32] brother see if you're true to God's word
[27:36] don't care what how you don't get little
[27:38] God don't have little children and big
[27:40] children he just has children and
[27:43] they're all the same they nearly exalt
[27:46] every word on tape to being scripture
[27:48] that's a sin that's a lie so let's
[27:50] listen to this quote from hear ye himym
[27:52] 1960 and realize if the devil can't keep
[27:54] you from seeing a truth he'll push you
[27:56] to some extreme some deep end and the
[27:58] deep end here is that every single
[28:00] opinion of brother brandham is thus
[28:01] sayith the Lord or you don't need a
[28:03] scripture for every single thing brother
[28:05] brandham said yes you do brother R said
[28:07] every Doctrine everything else from the
[28:09] Bible must come from the Bible let's
[28:11] listen to the quote from hear ye him 196
[28:14] see if the devil can't keep you from
[28:16] seeing a real real thing of God he'll
[28:19] push you off the deep end with it like
[28:20] that he'll make you go to a fanatic you
[28:23] don't have to be fanatical there's too
[28:24] much real and real genuine to have to be
[28:27] a fanatic my the whole Pentecostal skies
[28:30] are full of it in
[28:33] closing friends hope this video was a
[28:35] blessing by the grace of God I just want
[28:36] to give a quick video response to some
[28:38] of these criticisms and it's okay I'm
[28:40] open to being criticized I wouldn't be
[28:42] on YouTube if I didn't want to be
[28:44] criticized I hope this video was done
[28:46] with brotherly kindness of course I've
[28:47] got to take a stand on certain things
[28:49] and I got to call certain behaviors like
[28:51] I see them if I think it's Pride I'm
[28:52] going to go ahead and call it I've had
[28:54] that video out there for almost 3 years
[28:55] now and I have all the Bible evidence
[28:57] from for that so that's just my humble
[28:59] opinion as well I'm open to being
[29:01] corrected if someone will correct me but
[29:02] I want to remind everybody of this quote
[29:04] from 1964 the unveiling of God a man is
[29:07] trying to tempt brother brandom to
[29:09] writing his own Bible regarding his
[29:11] revelation of the seals and the Seven
[29:12] Thunders and he says you're eligible to
[29:14] write a Bible yourself he say you have
[29:16] all the qualifications so what does
[29:18] brother Ram say he says but look you
[29:20] can't add one word or take one word away
[29:22] he's quoting revelation 22 18- 19 so I
[29:26] love this quote because brother Rand
[29:28] cannot add to the Bible he can't take
[29:30] away from the Bible and when these
[29:32] famous preachers start making almost
[29:34] every opinion or every word of brother
[29:36] brandham scripture on level with
[29:37] scripture they're actually getting close
[29:39] to idolatry so this is a beautiful quote
[29:41] brother brand said God's spirit will
[29:43] never leave that word so the spirit of
[29:45] God will always direct us to the word of
[29:47] God on every Doctrine every teaching
[29:50] every biblical idea let's listen to the
[29:52] quote now someone has been many has been
[29:55] saying theologians said brother brand if
[29:57] the Lord God said if if with your
[30:00] experience that the Lord has given you
[30:01] for his people humbly saying this said
[30:04] You' be eligible to write a Bible
[30:07] yourself your word if God has manifested
[30:09] I said that might be true see he's
[30:11] trying to catch me I said but you see I
[30:14] couldn't do that he said why couldn't
[30:15] you have all the qualifications I said
[30:17] but you look one word cannot be added or
[30:20] taken away and he said well then them
[30:22] seven Thunders you see said what them
[30:24] seven Thunders blasting out won't that
[30:26] be a revelation be given to some man I
[30:27] said no sir it would be adding something
[30:29] to it or taking something from it's all
[30:30] revealed in there and the Seven Seals
[30:32] opened up the revelation of what that
[30:33] was
[30:34] am Ste in the word you see you can't get
[30:37] out of that word it won't leave the word
[30:40] and God's spirit will never leave that
[30:41] word it'll stay right with the word
[30:44] blinding some and Open the Eyes of
[30:45] others it'll always do that so friends
[30:48] let's close with a word of prayer I ask
[30:49] God to minister to these famous
[30:51] Preachers by the grace of God I know I'm
[30:52] nothing I'm the least of God's servants
[30:54] and that's totally fine with me but I
[30:56] want to have a loving heart a heart of
[30:58] love so let's pray for them dear Lord
[30:59] thank you for today Lord I pray this
[31:01] video could be a help to the person who
[31:03] shared my videos with this famous
[31:05] preacher perhaps they'll open up their
[31:06] hearts and uh really seek you and seek
[31:09] the truth of your word and really pray
[31:10] about these quotes pray about these
[31:12] scriptures Lord Jesus to help them to
[31:14] more better rightly divide the word of
[31:16] Truth Lord may they feel my brotherly
[31:18] love if they watch it I don't know if
[31:20] they will but if they do I pray you'll
[31:22] use it God for your glory Lord Jesus
[31:24] this is a wonderful exercise and rightly
[31:25] dividing the word of Truth iron
[31:28] sharpening iron and growing in Grace and
[31:30] knowledge of Our Lord also as Peter said
[31:33] being ready to give an answer for the
[31:35] hope that we have within us by the grace
[31:37] of God so Lord Jesus let your spirit
[31:39] bring unity and love and truth may we
[31:41] all go deeper in the love of God
[31:43] together I ask this in Jesus Christ's
[31:45] name
[31:46] amen if you have any questions concerns
[31:49] or testimonies about this video please

[31:52] me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[31:55] the desire of your heart
