TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] then we find out the Apostle is a special man he's a he's a set an order he's a man that's sent from God to set the things in order greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ what is an apostle this video is going to answer a viewer's question who asked me about this the viewer said please cover the entire fivefold ministry as a position of calling I I appreciate the questions an apostle means he that is sent according to the Greek Lexicon it also means a delegate messenger one sent forth with orders God's Prophet brother random often said Apostle means one sent and that definition of course is in the Lexicon hi friends I'm Jesse Smith pastor bride of Christ Fellowship here in akan Ohio USA and I defend the original Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ that he revealed to St Paul then had to restore through Martin Luther John Wesley and the late Prophet William Mary and brandham who lived from 1909 to 1965 and I also defend brother Ram's Godly Christian character let's begin with defining an apostle again here is a screenshot an apostle is he that is sent a delegate messenger one sent forth with orders God's Prophet brother randam repeated this in 1955 position in Christ he said Apostle means one cent and I like this statement I've often wondered why the missionary ever wants to be called missionary so brother like the word Apostle of course so do we we're Bible Believers let's listen to the quote Apostle uh word Apostle means one that's sent I've often wondered why the missionary ever wanted to be called a missionary a missionary is an apostle the word a missionary means one sent Apostle means one sent a missionary is an apostle next brother B said Apostle is a special man he's a Setter in order this means he goes into a area where there's no Believers he makes converts and then he sets them in order with pastors Elders deacons and so forth he's a special man let's listen to the quote then we find out the Apostle is a special man he's a he's a Setter in order he's a man that's sent from God to set the things in order brother brandom also said the Apostle is the highest office in the Bible in the New Testament he said this in remembering the Lord 1962 he said it's the highest calling in the Bible higher than a prophet he's talking about how judas's scarrett sold out this office but clearly said an apostle is higher than a prophet let's listen to the quote he sold Jesus for personal gain we ridicu J Judas we say he was a filthy a bad guy he's not fit for no place or no Society he isn't fit for heaven why he sold his Lord if you had the opportunity to even to be a a disciple to be an apostle the highest calling in the Bible higher than a prophet he had the opportunity to be a a apostle and sold that right for personal gain am and now he has to remember that that's how he remembers Jesus personal gain in Mark 10: 28-31 Jesus Promised the apostles the highest reward he said they would get a h hundredfold in this world speaking of Christian friends and fellowship and support but also a h hundredfold in the world to come another scripture says Jesus also told Peter that he and the other Apostles would judge the 12 tribes of Israel in the Regeneration or in the Millennium so they have a special place of leadership and oversight in the Thousand-Year Millennial Reign the next scripture 1 Corinthians 12:28 Paul says God set some in the church first apostles secondarily prophets thirdly teachers and after that Miracles then Gifts of healing helps governments diversity of tongues so here St Paul sets forth the fact that Apostles are of the highest Authority now that we've defined the Apostle let's look at a few Bible examples here the first time the word Apostle is used in the Bible is Matthew 10 1-4 in Matthew 10:2 it says now the names of the 12 apostles are these so Jesus called 12 disciples or 12 Apostles he was going to send them out also want to read Luke 10:1 this proves Jesus Christ was the greatest Apostle of all time that's what even brother brandham said Luke 10:1 after these things the Lord appointed 70 other also and sent them two by two before his face into every city and place with he himself would come so here's the order and pattern of ministry by the Lord Jesus Christ he would send his Apostles out two by two they'd go into a city they'd heal the sick they do signs wonders and miracles and then Jesus himself would come so this is the organizational plan of the greatest missionary ever the Lord Jesus Christ and the Bible also says he would heal entire multitudes anyone who believed could be healed Jesus Christ the greatest missionary and brother Ram said that in faith cometh by hearing 1954 he said Paul is the greatest missionary since Christ so Jesus Christ is the greatest missionary Paul was the greatest missionary of Sinners saved by grace because the Lord Jesus was born of a virgin without sin St Paul had three missionary Journeys in the book of Acts and he started churches such as Antioch in Bida Iconium Lyra Derby Philippi thessalonica Corinth Ephesus and more let's look at a few more scriptures Matthew 28:19 and 20 Jesus tells his Apostles to go therefore teach All Nations so we see here Apostles must be teachers of the word of God yes they must have signs wonders and miracles but they also must have the ability to teach and baptize teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I commanded you so Apostles do Great Signs wonders and miracles they convince people of the power of God but then they also teach them or instruct them on how to live a Christian Life here's a beautiful Bible example of Jesus telling St Paul to stay in the city of Corinth to establish a church in that City Jesus told Paul not to fear he said no man will hurt thee and Paul stayed there a year and 6 months teaching the word of God among them another example is Titus 15 Paul said he left Titus in cre that he should set in order the things that are wanting and ordain Elders in every city as Paul had appointed him so Titus was most likely an apostle Titus was called his son by St Paul in Titus one4 and his brother Titus was called his partner and fellow helper in 2 Corinthians 2:13 and second Corinthians 8:23 Titus went up with the apostles to Jerusalem in Galatians Ians 2:1 and he had Earnest care for the churches 2 Corinthians 8:16 Paul's Second Epistle to the Corinthians was sent to them by the hand of Titus according to 2 Corinthians 8:16 through1 18 and chapter 9 veres 2-4 and 2 Corinthians 12:8 next in act 13: 1-4 we see Paul and Barnabas sent forth by the Holy Ghost this is how missionaries or Apostles are sent forth they're sent forth by God and of course before they're sent forth they have to minister unto the Lord with prayer and fastings so Apostles humble themselves they fast and pray and wait for the leadership of the Lord to send them forth and one more verse I want to read here Mark 63-32 in these verses Jesus tells the apostles to come apart and rest after their long missionary trip so the Apostles of Jesus needed rest due to the difficult labor travel and Ministry before closing I want to talk about some of my observations about Apostles or missionaries personally I know very few Apostles because I don't get out very much I've never traveled very much I spent most of my years as a preacher as a pastor so I've always stayed with the flock for the most part the most biblical missionary or Apostle I've ever seen is a brother from Guyana South America he flies into the remote parts of Brazil in order to make converts to the message of the hour usually they introduce the Lord Jesus Christ baptism first God's given him many wonderful signs Miracles and wonders he goes to such remote parts that he has to get on a boat many times and just travel down the Amazon by boat in order to reach these Villages an interesting observation I found was that most missionaries from the United States that call themselves missionaries when they go overseas they're really just doing Evangelistic work and not missionary work because missionary work or Apostle work means you go to a place where there's no Believers and you try to make Believers in order to set in order a new church and when this realization from the Bible came to me back in about 2010 I was making about four or five trips down to South America I thought I was doing missionary work and I found out I wasn't I was doing Evangelistic work and so on one or two occasions I'd asked the brother from South America can we go out into a public place where there's no Believers and try to make belie belies we did that twice I think and the second time I think we had a few converts that were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ according of the brother but that's real missionary work when you go out to people who have not believed people that have not heard the message and you try to establish new churches also I want to say that ministers in the fivefold ministry can have more than one gift St Paul was a prophet because he prophesied numerous times like about the Rapture in 1 Corinthians 15: 51-54 he even said he was a prophet and the word of God came to him in 1 Corinthians 14 he called himself a teacher in 1 Timothy 2:7 he called himself an apostle in Romans 1:8 and he was doing Evangelistic work in Acts 1536 and 41 brother Ram said St Paul was the pastor at Ephesus remember he was there 3 years so brother ramam said he was doing pastoral work there so Paul no doubt had all five preaching gifts of the fivefold ministry and because Jesus Christ was the greatest preacher of all time we'd say the only real preacher Jesus had all the preaching gifts he was an apostle as brother Ram said he was the greatest missionary or Apostle ever no doubt he was a teacher no doubt he was a pastor to his little flock of Apostles he did Evangelistic work and of course he was a prophet the god prophet and brother Ram said Jesus had all the fruits of the spirit so Jesus had all the fruits of the spirit all the preaching gifts and he had all nine gifts of the holy spirit as well even Martin Luther according to brother brandham had all nine spiritual gifts so we know preachers can have more than one preaching gift and also more than one of the nine gifts of the holy spirit getting back to St Paul it's easy to see how Paul's gifts were used at different times as far as his five preaching gifts he was Apostle Paul was an apostle when starting a new church like in Corinth there in act chapter 18 but then he moved in the Pastoral role when he stayed in Ephesus for 3 years years giving them the whole counsel of God according to acts chap 20 and then once he would leave Ephesus then he would be an apostle go back into the Apostle work to start other churches on his travels we also see this in brother Brandon's Ministry he started preaching as a pastor in Jeffersonville and then the Holy Spirit sent him out to be an evangelist and then he would do Apostle work such as when he went to India 1954 won many souls to the Lord Jesus Christ so we can see brother Ram go between the different preaching gifts that he had and apparently he saw his role as a type of a pastor maybe like a senior pastor during the end of his ministry because he spent extensive time in 1962 preaching at brandham Tabernacle teaching at brandham Tabernacle to store up the food that we would need today he taught extensively of course in 1963 and I want to play one quote from 1963 brother random said you look to me as your pastor and I am your pastor so this was probably like in a senior pastor role so let's listen to this quote from perfect Faith 1963 know ye what I have done to you you call me your pastor and you say well for so I am if I your pastor have been identified by Jesus Christ that I do his work then believe my word amen by Act ing this Act of Faith by laying hands upon you I have condemned the disease and affliction that's bothering [Music] you in closing friends I hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God the apostles the highest calling in the Bible Jesus Christ promised the greatest reward for the Apostle so we've covered the Apostle and I have a video on a pastor Lord willing will try to get to the three final preaching gifts evangelist teacher and profit by the grace of God remember Jesus told us to pray that God would send forth labors into the kingdom into the field so let's end with a prayer for the apostles dear God we love you Lord God we know this is the final Church age Lord God but still there is a harvest that needs to be done so father I pray you'd send forth Apostles into the field for your glory Lord God that they could win souls and set up churches that would Worship You Lord Jesus in spirit and in truth thank you for your promises Lord thank you for the example you set forth Lord Jesus as the greatest missionary the greatest Apostle the god Prophet The God man the Lord Jesus Christ we worship you Lord Jesus and use this video For Your Glory in Jesus Christ's name amen if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
