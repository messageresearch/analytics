[0:02] and he opened his mouth and blasphemy
[0:05] against God to blaspheme his name give
[0:09] him a title thus sayth the Lord amen
[0:13] hallelujah hallelujah huj the baptism
[0:16] using the title of father son Holy Ghost
[0:18] is
[0:19] false greetings friends in the matchless
[0:22] name of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[0:24] purpose of this video is to share a
[0:26] wonderful Revelation that my brother
[0:28] Simon shared with me and he heard a
[0:30] little bit about it from a preacher
[0:32] online and then he went and searched the
[0:34] scriptures and found how King Saul only
[0:37] used the titles of David when he had an
[0:39] evil spirit on him but then when he
[0:41] repented he used the literal name of
[0:43] David and of course this is a beautiful
[0:45] type of the denominational churches how
[0:47] they have evil spirits on them and they
[0:49] use the father son Holy Ghost baptism
[0:52] the titles baptism rather than the
[0:55] baptism using the literal name of the
[0:57] Lord Jesus Christ hi friends I'm Jesse
[1:00] Smith pastor bride of Christ Fellowship
[1:02] here in akan Ohio USA we're coming up on
[1:04] our 18th year anniversary by the grace
[1:06] of God and I defend the Bible
[1:08] revelations that Jesus Christ revealed
[1:10] to his true Prophet his genuine Prophet
[1:12] The Late William brandham 1909 to 1965
[1:16] and I defend The Godly character of
[1:17] brother William brandham so I'll start
[1:19] by sharing a few weeks ago my brother
[1:21] Simon preached for us and he was
[1:22] listening to a sermon online and the
[1:25] preacher said that King Saul only used
[1:27] the titles of David when he had an evil
[1:29] Spirit on him and so brother Simon went
[1:31] and found those scriptures and then
[1:33] combined it with some other wonderful
[1:35] scriptures and preach it to us and I was
[1:37] just shouting and rejoicing in the back
[1:39] of the congregation I never heard this
[1:41] Revelation before so Simon didn't
[1:43] originate it but he found the scriptures
[1:46] that taught this wonderful Revelation
[1:47] and magnifies the literal name of the
[1:49] Lord Jesus Christ in water baptism of
[1:52] course also and it goes along with
[1:53] Colossians 3:17 whatsoever you do in
[1:56] word or deed do it all in the name of
[1:58] the Lord Jesus Christ the Bible doesn't
[2:00] say to do all things in the titles
[2:02] father son Holy Ghost it's the Lord
[2:04] Jesus Christ so let's teach us again by
[2:06] the scripture if you go to Matthew 28:19
[2:08] Jesus said to baptize in the name the
[2:10] one name singular name of the father son
[2:13] Holy Ghost and as my previous video
[2:15] showed the name of the father son Holy
[2:17] Ghost is Jesus Jesus means Jehovah is
[2:19] our salvation and then acts 236 says
[2:22] Jesus is both Lord and Christ Matthew
[2:25] 5:43 said Jesus came in his father's
[2:28] name so the name of the father is Jesus
[2:30] Jehovah and then Matthew
[2:33] 1:21 Mary was told to name the child the
[2:36] son Jesus so the name of the son is
[2:38] Jesus and then John 14:26 Jesus said the
[2:42] comforter will come in my name so the
[2:44] comforter comes in a name the Holy Ghost
[2:46] comes in a name it's in the name of
[2:48] Jesus and then here's this chart I've
[2:50] shown numerous times on videos Matthew
[2:53] 2819 Jesus said father son Holy Ghost
[2:56] then 10 days later on the day of
[2:58] Pentecost in Acts 238 Peter said
[3:00] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ in
[3:02] Acts 8:16 in Samaria the Bible said they
[3:06] were baptized in the name of the Lord
[3:07] Jesus in Acts 10:48 Peter said or Luke
[3:11] said they were baptized in the name of
[3:13] the Lord acts 19:5 at Ephesus the Bible
[3:17] says they were baptized in the name of
[3:18] the Lord Jesus and then Paul said he was
[3:20] baptized in the name of the Lord in Acts
[3:21] 22:16 so we can clearly see the only
[3:25] Bible formula for water baptism full
[3:27] immersion in water is using the literal
[3:29] name of the Lord Jesus
[3:31] Christ and also remember demons were
[3:34] only cast out using the name the literal
[3:36] name of the Lord Jesus Christ that's in
[3:38] Acts
[3:39] 16:18 Paul being grieved turned and said
[3:41] to the spirit I command the name of
[3:43] Jesus Christ to come out of her and he
[3:45] came out the same hour friends I've cast
[3:47] demons out a few times maybe six or
[3:49] seven times and each time it was using
[3:51] the literal name of Jesus Christ and
[3:53] reminding the devil about the power of
[3:55] the blood of Jesus Christ that happened
[3:57] a few times in South America mirac ous
[4:00] healings were done in the literal name
[4:01] of Jesus Christ not titles father son
[4:03] Holy Ghost that's in Acts
[4:05] 3:6 Peter said Silver and Gold Have I
[4:08] None but such as I have give I Thee in
[4:10] the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth
[4:13] rise up and walk Peter didn't say titles
[4:15] Father Son and Holy Ghost and so those
[4:18] are just a few of course you can go
[4:19] through the entire book of Acts and any
[4:21] other New Testament text there was no
[4:23] Supernatural miracle healing or baptism
[4:27] ever performed in titles it was always
[4:28] in the literal name name of the Lord
[4:30] Jesus Christ that's why we do it today
[4:32] that's why we know we're part of the
[4:33] book of Acts church we are continuation
[4:36] of the book of Acts church so we baptize
[4:38] we cast out demons we pray for the sick
[4:41] we rebuke evil spirits all in the
[4:43] literal name of the Lord Jesus Christ so
[4:45] getting to the story of Saul in 1st
[4:48] Samuel 16:14 an evil spirit comes on
[4:51] Saul but the spirit of the Lord departed
[4:53] from Saul and an evil spirit from the
[4:55] Lord troubled him next we'll see Saul
[4:58] use the title son of Jesse numerous
[5:01] times we'll start in 1st Samuel 20 vers
[5:05] 30 and 31 then Saul's anger was K
[5:08] kindled against Jonathan he said unto
[5:09] him thou son of the perverse rebellious
[5:12] woman do not I know that thou has chosen
[5:14] the son of Jesse to thine own confusion
[5:17] and unto the confusion of thy mother's
[5:20] nakedness verse 31 for as long as the
[5:23] son of Jesse liveth upon the ground Thou
[5:25] shalt not be established nor thy kingdom
[5:27] so this shows an evil spirit won't use
[5:30] the literal name and that's what we find
[5:32] in churches that do not have the
[5:34] revelation of the name of Jesus Christ
[5:36] they'll use titles father son Holy Ghost
[5:39] because they got a evil spirit the Bible
[5:41] calls it a spirit of Heir they've made
[5:43] an heir baptism is not performed in
[5:46] titles baptism is performed in the
[5:48] literal name of Jesus Christ next 1st
[5:51] Samuel
[5:52] 22:7 then Saul said unto his servants
[5:55] that stood about him here now ye
[5:56] benjamites will the son of Jesse give
[5:58] every one of you fields and Vineyards
[6:00] make you all captains of thousands and
[6:02] captains of hundreds then verse 8 he
[6:05] says it again there is none that showeth
[6:07] me that my son hath made a league with
[6:09] the son of
[6:10] Jesse and then 1st Samuel
[6:13] 2213 and Saul said unto him why have ye
[6:15] conspired against me thou and the son of
[6:17] Jesse and that thou has given him bread
[6:19] and a sword and a squir of God for him
[6:21] that he should rise against me to line
[6:23] weight as at this day another verse that
[6:26] shows Saul had influenced others in
[6:28] Israel to use the titles was first Kings
[6:32] 12:16 so when all Israel saw that the
[6:34] king hearkened not unto them the people
[6:35] answered the king saying what portion
[6:37] have we in David neither have we
[6:38] inheritance in the son of Jesse so they
[6:41] named David but then they call him also
[6:43] son of Jesse and then finally in 1st
[6:45] Samuel 24:16 Saul had repented of
[6:49] hunting down David and so that evil
[6:51] spirit left him he repented and then he
[6:53] uses the name David again after he
[6:55] repents and gets the evil spirit off him
[6:57] 1st Samuel 24:16
[7:00] and it came to pass when David had made
[7:01] an end of speaking those words unto Saul
[7:03] that Saul saidis this thy voice my son
[7:06] David and Saul lifted up his voice and
[7:08] wept and remember of course David was a
[7:11] type of Christ David in the Hebrew means
[7:13] loving and in Matthew 317 the father
[7:17] said this is my beloved Son so Jesus was
[7:20] beloved David means loving the Bible
[7:23] said David was a man of war a man of
[7:25] blood and of course that's what Jesus
[7:27] was he was a man of war spiritually
[7:30] speaking and he spilled his blood for
[7:32] the sins of the whole world the Bible
[7:34] says 1 John 2:2 he is the propitiation
[7:37] for our sins and not for ours only but
[7:39] also for the sins of the whole world
[7:42] praise God that Jesus Christ shed his
[7:44] blood for all the sins of the whole
[7:46] world and remember friends this is a
[7:48] tactic of Satan to not use the literal
[7:51] name of Jesus Christ brother Ram taught
[7:54] us that in the four seal he used
[7:55] Revelation 13:6 to show a threefold or
[7:59] triple blasphemy that the Beast system
[8:02] uses against the literal name of Jesus
[8:04] Christ the Bible said that he opened his
[8:07] mouth and blasphemy against God to
[8:09] blaspheme his name brother Ram said give
[8:11] him a title that's the first blasphemy
[8:13] the second is his Tabernacle which is
[8:15] the holy spirit's Dwelling Place the
[8:17] Beast makes it a place in Rome the
[8:19] Vatican City and then third he
[8:22] blasphemes them that dwell in heaven he
[8:24] blasphemes the Saints by saying they
[8:26] were intercessors what a beautiful
[8:28] Revelation the Holy Ghost reveals to
[8:29] brother Bram let's listen to the quote
[8:32] and he opened his mouth and blasphemy
[8:34] against
[8:38] God to blaspheme his name give him a
[8:43] title his Tabernacle which is the holy
[8:46] spirit's dwelling place to make it a
[8:48] place in Rome a Vatican City you just go
[8:51] on down and then that dwell in heaven
[8:54] blasphemed them but saying they were
[8:58] intercessors and and it was given unto
[9:00] him to make war with the Saints and he
[9:02] did and to overcome them he did in
[9:06] closing friends I hope this video was a
[9:09] blessing by the grace of God again a
[9:10] beautiful Revelation brother Simon
[9:12] caught from a preacher and then he goes
[9:13] and studies the word of God and gives us
[9:15] all this wonderful Bible evidence for
[9:17] this beautiful Revelation friends
[9:19] remember there's power in the name of
[9:22] Jesus Christ it's the literal name of
[9:23] Jesus Christ that was found in Acts 4:17
[9:26] they asked the disciples by what power
[9:29] or but or by what name have you done
[9:31] this that's when Peter uttered those
[9:33] beautiful words acts 410 by the name of
[9:36] Jesus Christ of Nazareth even by him
[9:40] doth this man stand before you whole
[9:42] neither is there salvation in any other
[9:45] there salvation in the literal name of
[9:47] Jesus Christ and there is none other
[9:49] name under Heaven given among men
[9:51] whereby we must be saved so friends we
[9:54] rejoice in this Bible Revelation again
[9:56] this water baptism Revelation is Rock
[9:58] Solid thus sayith the Lord amen
[10:02] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah the
[10:04] baptism using the title of father son
[10:06] Holy Ghost is
[10:07] false thus sayth the Lord
[10:11] amen
[10:13] amen I command every one of you on here
[10:17] on tape that hasn't been baptized in the
[10:20] name of Jesus Christ be baptized again
[10:24] in the name of Jesus Christ amen Paul in
[10:27] Acts 59
[10:30] 195 said have you received the Holy
[10:32] Ghost since you believe it said we know
[10:34] not where it be the Holy Ghost said what
[10:35] was you baptized amen they said we've
[10:38] been baptized but not in Christian
[10:41] baptism Father Son and Holy Ghost is not
[10:44] Christian baptism amen no Christian was
[10:47] ever baptized like that in the Bible
[10:50] amen or for hundreds of years after the
[10:52] Bible it's a Catholic Creed and not a
[10:56] Christian doctrine show me in the Bible
[11:00] amen it's a it's a
[11:03] fraud it's a working of devils amen I
[11:06] don't mean to say the people that's
[11:08] baptized like at are that way God's got
[11:10] a many person out there today that don't
[11:12] know no better but the hour has come am
[11:16] we've got to get back to the word if we
[11:18] expect God to work in this day like we
[11:20] live
[11:21] then the godhead Revelation is Rock
[11:23] Solid I believe everything the Bible
[11:25] says about the godhead and water baptism
[11:27] we just of course reject all the dogma
[11:30] and the additions to the word of God
[11:32] about the godhead and water baptism of
[11:34] course so friends be encouraged keep
[11:36] using the literal name of Jesus Christ
[11:38] it casts out Devils it does Miracles
[11:40] it's a name we're baptized in it's a
[11:42] name we're saved in the Lord Jesus
[11:44] Christ if you have any questions
[11:46] concerns or testimonies about this video
[11:48] please contact me God bless you and may
[11:51] Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
