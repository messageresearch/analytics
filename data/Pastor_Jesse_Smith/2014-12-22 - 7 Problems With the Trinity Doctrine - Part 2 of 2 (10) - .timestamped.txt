[0:11] problem number five God sent us a
[0:13] prophet to warn us of this air with thus
[0:16] sayeth the
[0:18] Lord God has always sent prophets to the
[0:21] Earth to warn the people with thus sayth
[0:23] the Lord before judgment strikes during
[0:27] the 20th century God sent a prophet to
[0:29] the Earth by the name of William
[0:32] brandham we have a teaching video that
[0:35] highlights and shows three of his
[0:36] prophecies that have either come to pass
[0:39] already or are in the process of coming
[0:41] to pass right now this video shows that
[0:44] he was a genuine prophet of God who
[0:46] spoke in the name of the Lord because we
[0:49] are living in the last days and the end
[0:51] of the world is so near God had to send
[0:54] a prophet named William brandham to
[0:56] restore the truths of the Bible to the
[0:58] hearts of the people one of those truths
[1:00] that was to be restored was the teaching
[1:02] on the
[1:04] godhead in 1961 William brandham spoke
[1:08] in the name of the Lord that
[1:09] trinitarianism is of the devil notice
[1:12] that this prophet of God did not say all
[1:14] trinitarians are going to hell this
[1:17] Prophet believed trinitarians were
[1:18] Christians but they were sincerely wrong
[1:20] about the godhead let's listen to this
[1:23] word from the Lord now my precious
[1:26] brother I know this is a tape also now
[1:29] don't get excited let me say this with
[1:32] Godly
[1:33] love the hours approach where I can't
[1:36] hold still on these things no more too
[1:39] close to the coming
[1:41] see trinitarianism is of the
[1:45] devil I say that thus sayith the Lord
[1:49] amen look where it come
[1:53] from it come from the N seeeing
[1:56] Council when the Catholic church becom
[1:59] in rulership
[2:01] the word Trinity is not even mentioned
[2:03] in the entire book of the
[2:06] Bible and it's far as three Gods that's
[2:09] from Hell there's one
[2:13] God it's exactly right now do you say
[2:18] then you believe it all these people as
[2:20] trinitarians are of hell no sir I
[2:22] believe they are
[2:24] Christi but the hour is approaching
[2:27] brother where they are sin sin cely
[2:32] wrong the Trinity Doctrine is simply a
[2:35] misinterpretation an addition to the
[2:37] word a false Doctrine and a deception
[2:41] God never said he was three persons God
[2:43] never asked us to rotate tritheism into
[2:46] our worship God never asked us to add
[2:48] anything to the word of God we
[2:51] understand that the statement
[2:53] trinitarianism is of the devil may be
[2:55] very difficult for most trinitarians to
[2:58] hear so that is why we made this
[2:59] teaching video to highlight seven major
[3:02] problems not just one or two that we
[3:05] have with the Trinity Doctrine in order
[3:07] to help Open the Eyes of the people to
[3:09] the devil's addition to the Bible on
[3:11] this Doctrine recall where this Doctrine
[3:14] came from it came from men who were not
[3:16] writers of the Bible and they used
[3:18] impure words that are not found in the
[3:20] Bible and recall that a prominent
[3:23] scholar today encourages Christians to
[3:25] understand the Trinity as tritheism at
[3:27] times which is the worship of three Gods
[3:30] we humbly ask that you seek God through
[3:33] honest prayer and through much study of
[3:35] the Bible before siding with the Creeds
[3:37] of men and denominations may you choose
[3:39] to take sides with God's word on the
[3:42] topic of the
[3:43] godhead we are thankful for the truth
[3:45] God has restored to us through his
[3:47] Prophet William brandham and we pray it
[3:50] will be a blessing to your heart and
[3:53] mind problem number six trinitarian
[3:56] authors did not affirm that the Holy
[3:58] Spirit was divine until 381
[4:07] ad this is another proof that the Bible
[4:10] writers had greater Revelation on the
[4:12] godhead than the Catholic authors and
[4:14] writers of the Trinity Doctrine the
[4:17] original apostles who were filled with
[4:19] the spirit around 33 to 34 ad
[4:22] immediately knew that the Holy Spirit
[4:24] was divine yet trinitarian writers and
[4:27] followers did not affirm this until 381
[4:31] a in Acts 5: 3 and 4 the New Testament
[4:35] writer used the words Holy Spirit and
[4:37] God interchangeably proving that the
[4:40] early Apostles and Bible writers knew
[4:42] the Holy Spirit was and is God acts 53
[4:47] and 4 but Peter said ananas why has
[4:50] Satan filled thine heart to lie to the
[4:53] Holy Ghost and to keep back part of the
[4:55] price of the land whilst it remained was
[4:59] it not th thine own and after it was
[5:01] sold was it not in thine own power why
[5:04] hast thou conceived this thing in thine
[5:05] heart thou has not light unto men but
[5:08] unto
[5:10] God problem number seven there are
[5:13] numerous errors in the Trinity doctrine
[5:15] that contradicts scripture we will share
[5:18] a few of these heirs contradiction
[5:21] number one the man-made athonian Creed
[5:23] says that Jesus was of the father alone
[5:27] meaning that the Holy Ghost was not the
[5:28] father of Jesus but this is an he
[5:31] because the Bible teaches that Jesus was
[5:34] conceived of the Holy Ghost in Matthew
[5:37] 1:20 so what is the truth the truth is
[5:41] that the Bible reveals the father and
[5:43] the Holy Spirit as the self-same person
[5:46] not two separate persons Jesus said the
[5:49] father is Holy in John 17:11 Jesus also
[5:53] said God the father is a spirit in John
[5:56] 4:24 that makes the father a Holy Spirit
[5:59] According To
[6:00] Jesus so the statement that the son is
[6:03] of the father alone is only true when a
[6:05] Believer understands that the father and
[6:07] the Holy Spirit are the self-same person
[6:10] not two separate persons the one who
[6:13] conceives a child is the Father the
[6:16] athonian Creed denies the Holy Spirit as
[6:18] the father of Jesus annulling Matthew
[6:22] 1:20 contradiction number two the
[6:25] man-made athonian Creed says in this
[6:28] Trinity none is greater or less than
[6:30] another but the Bible teaches that the
[6:32] father is greater than the Flesh of
[6:35] Jesus according to John 14 verse 28
[6:39] because the Flesh of Jesus was Mortal
[6:41] during his Earthly Ministry but God the
[6:44] father is a spirit and has been and
[6:46] always will be immortal according to 1
[6:49] Timothy 1:17 and 1 Timothy
[6:53] 6:16 Believers must also admit that the
[6:56] Flesh of Jesus did not have complete
[6:58] omniscience for the Bible teaches that
[7:00] there is knowledge that Jesus does not
[7:02] know Mark
[7:04] 13:32 but of that day and that hour
[7:07] knoweth no man no not the Angels which
[7:10] are in heaven neither the son but the
[7:13] father contradiction number three the
[7:16] man-made athanasian Creed says we
[7:18] worship one God in Trinity but the Bible
[7:21] teaches that God must be worshiped in
[7:22] spirit and in truth and since the word
[7:25] Trinity and the definition are not found
[7:27] in the words of the Bible they cannot be
[7:29] the the right Spirit or truth Jesus said
[7:32] Thy word is truth in John
[7:35] 17:17 contradiction number four the
[7:38] man-made athonian Creed says that God is
[7:41] three persons but the Bible teaches that
[7:43] the father is the holy spirit which
[7:46] decreases their total down to only two
[7:48] persons then their total number of
[7:51] persons will be decreased down to only
[7:53] one because the Bible also teaches that
[7:56] the son is the image of the person of
[7:59] the father according to Hebrews 1:3 and
[8:02] Colossians
[8:05] 1:15 Jesus the son was not a second
[8:08] separate person from the father because
[8:11] the Bible never called him that he was
[8:13] simply the image of the person of the
[8:15] Father the Bible calls Jesus Emmanuel
[8:18] meaning God With Us not a second person
[8:21] but God himself Jesus was the person of
[8:24] God the Father manifest In the Flesh
[8:27] according to 1 Timothy 3:
[8:30] 16 if you would like more information
[8:32] about how the trinitarian doctrine
[8:34] contradicts the word of God and if you'd
[8:36] also like more teaching about the truths
[8:39] of the godhead according to scripture
[8:40] alone please contact us God bless you
[8:44] and may Jesus Christ be the desire of
[8:46] your
[8:58] heart
