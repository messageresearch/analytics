TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] But now the true trinity of God being one manifested in Christ who was life. God in a trinity is one and without a trinity he's not God. Greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of this video is to show quotes from God's prophet brother William Brandham where he uses the word trinity in a positive manner. And this video will also show a general timeline for his growth in the revelation on the Godhead. Here's just four quick points before we get into that chronological list of quotes. The first point is that we admire brother Ram's growth in the knowledge of God. As second Peter says, we must grow in grace and the knowledge of the Lord. So we can see individually here, brother Ram received revelation from God about who God is. God is one person, not three persons. Initially, brother Bram believed God was three persons, but then he received greater revelation and realized God is one person. And then brother Ram calls it the capstone revelation of the Godhead that Jesus is God. And he says that in the church age book. Of course, this is also important part of the church ages. The church ages started off with a full revelation, but then it was slowly lost, especially the revelation on the godhead and water baptism. But then it began to be restored. By the sixth church age, the Philadelphia church age, they had held fast to the name of Jesus Christ. And then in the seventh church age, the full revelation of the Godhead and water baptism was restored by the gracious plan of God. So we must look at our lives the same way. We are going to continue to grow in grace and knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ. God is going to give us more information about the same revelations as brother M taught in the church age book. Second, this video will show again how ridiculous it is for people to say that every word on Brother Ram's tapes are thus sayith the Lord. That's a lie. That's heresy. As we're going to show here in 1951, Brother Ram said he loved the third person of the Trinity, the Holy Ghost. But then by 1961, he says three persons is of the devil with thus sayeth the Lord. And it's so sad, as some of my videos have showed, the current Brandom Tabernacle believes every word is thus sayith the Lord. So they're enslaved in heresy. They're trapped in heresy. Here's a screenshot of an email I received from the pastor from September 17th, 2020. And I said, "Could you please ask Joseph if he believes the third person of the Trinity burns in his heart?" As brother M said in 1951. And I got a reply from Joseph. He said, "Dear brother Smith, I believe every word he spoke on the tapes for it's the revelation of Jesus Christ. Hebrews 13:8." So, this is a non-answer, but based upon the way it's written, it seems like he believes that brother Brandham loved the third person of the Trinity. And so, I don't know what that means. Does that mean Joseph loves the third person of the Trinity? I don't know. So, this topic again proves that not every word on the tapes is thus sayith the Lord. Brother Bram was a human. He had human opinions, his own human thoughts. Brother Brham said he wasn't infallible. So true believers will not get under the anointing that idolizes brother Brandham and the words on the tapes of brother Brandham. They will stay free from that antichrist spirit. The third point is that the trinity doesn't pertain to salvation since it's a mystery according to Colossians 2. It's the mystery of God and of the father and of Christ. Now, of course, some are going to disagree with me and they're going to use a quote from 1965, anointed ones of the end time where Bram said, "If you don't believe Jesus is God, you're lost." But it depends on how you interpret that quote because there's lots of trinitarians who believe Jesus is God. They don't believe he's a second God. They believe he's a second person, but not a second God. They're not outright tritheists or they're not into trism. They're just confused. They don't understand the revelation. And brother Ram said, "It takes a real revelation to understand the Godhead." I was asked about this quote in my 2020 debate with Rod Bergen. And my answer was that this quote where brother Ram says, "Trinitarians are lost." This was just Brother Ram's human opinion. There's no thus sayith the Lord attached to it. Because you have previous quotes where Brother Ram says, "He believes they're saved." And that's what this video will show as well by God's grace. And even in the 1961 sermon where brother Ram twice said, "Thus sayith the Lord, trinitarianism is of the devil twice, brother Ram said that trinitarians can be saved." In fact, he said, "I believe that many thousands of trinitarian people who believes in three gods is saved because they don't know any difference." So, brother Ram left this window open for God's mercy and grace to extend to people when they don't know better. But once they hear the truth, then they are accountable to that. And consider that Martin Luther and John Wesley were trinitarians, church age messengers. And I know the revelation wasn't available in their day, but God still winked at their ignorance as the Bible says. And God will wink at ignorance until the person receives the knowledge of the truth. I thought it might be important just to run over a list of these major and minor topics that Brother talked about. In the quotes on majors and minors, I can only find one major topic that brother Ram talked about and that was salvation through faith in the blood of Jesus Christ. Every other quote on tape makes every other subject a minor. Such as brother Ram said, "Divine healing is a minor. Dancing, shouting, speaking in tongues are minors. The coming of the Lord, whether the Lord comes with a cloud or another way, he said that doesn't pertain to salvation." Brother Ram said communion doesn't pertain to salvation. And brother Ram seeing uh sensations like oil in your hands and seeing rainbows and all kinds of sensations. He says all sensations are minors. Now there is one quote in the church age book where brother talks about major doctrines such as godhead, water baptism etc. So the church age book has major doctrines. But nowhere in the church age book does brother Ram say a person can't be saved that doesn't have the revelation of the godhead in water baptism. So that's why I still believe trinitarians can be saved because in most cases they're ignorant of the truth. They just don't understand it. And perhaps that's what they were called to be. Perhaps they were called to be foolish virgins in the mind of God before the foundation of the world. God has wise virgins and foolish virgins. God has holy people, wise virgins or righteous people, foolish virgins. And now the fourth point, let's look at the positive uses of the word trinity by brother Bram. There's lots of them, but I just have three simple examples. In 1960 in Abraham, brother Ram said, "Everything in the Bible is a trinity." And then he goes through your body, soul, spirit. You live in three rooms, kitchen, living room, bedroom. Brother Ram said, "God is a trinity. Father, son, holy ghost is a trinity." And then there's three comingings of the Lord. Brother said, "Christ comes in a trinity to redeem his bride, to receive his bride, and then to rule and reign with his bride in the millennium." Let's listen to the quote. See, everything in the Bible is in a trinity. You know that. I said the other day, you're in a trinity. Soul, body, and spirit. You live in a trinity. The kitchen and the living room, the bedroom. You might have eight or 10 different rooms, but bedrooms and spare this, but you only live in three rooms. God, Father, Son, Holy Ghost, and a Trinity. And we find out the coming of Christ is in the trinity. He came first to re redeem his bride. Comes next to receive his bride. Come next with his bride is king and queen to reign through the millennium. You know that everything is in a trinity. And we are in a trinity. We have a mortal body, a glorified body uh I mean a celestial body and then a glorified body. Three stages brings us back to our perfection again. like in Eden. Second, in April 1965, Brother Ram calls God, quote, "The true trinity of God being one manifested in Christ." End quote. So notice Brother Ram's words here. The true trinity of God is Father, Son, Holy Ghost. But he uses Trinity in a different way. I went online and looked on Miam Webster's website, and there's three definitions of the Trinity. The second one is what Brother Ram's using. It's a group of three closely related persons or things. Not persons. Brother Ram is not saying God is three persons. Brother Ram is saying God is three closely related things or manifestations is the key word because those are the words the Bible uses. 1 Timothy 3:16 said God was manifest in the flesh. So the son is a manifestation. Then 1 Corinthians 12 says the manifestation of the spirit or the holy ghost is given to us to profit with all. So God appears in our lives as the Holy Ghost, Christ in us, the hope of glory. So here's the quote. It is the rising of the sun, 1965, the true trinity of God. Let's listen to the quote. But now the true trinity of God, being one, manifested in Christ who was light and broke the seals and conquered the enemy and rose up the one true and living God. I am he that was dead and I'm alive forever more has the keys of death and hell God in one made man and dwelt among us and conquered every enemy and it proved that the trinity of Satan was conquered and that the trinity of God was made known because only God alone had power to bring life back again. He was that Emmanuel. God had been manifested in the flesh. Then third and finally and in knoweth and not August 1965, brother Ram said that's God. Quote, God in a trinity is one. And without a trinity, he's not God. He can't be manifested any other way. End quote. And then brother Ram shows how we are as humans three parts. Body, soul, spirit. And remember, we're made in the image of God according to Genesis chapter 1. So we have three parts to us or three elements to us, but we're not three persons. We're one person with three elements or aspects to us. And so is God. God is one person who manifests himself in three ways. Father, Son, Holy Ghost. So let's listen to the quote from knoweth not. That's God. God in a trinity is one. And without a trinity, he's not God. You can't be manifested any other way. And neither can you be manifested without being the Trinity person that you are. That's body, spirit, soul. Without either one of them, you're not complete. Amen. See, if you didn't have a soul, you'd be nothing. You didn't have a spirit, you wouldn't be nothing. If you didn't have a body, just be a spirit, not a body. So God is complete in the triunityity of a being. Not triunityity of beings but one being in a triunityity. Father, Son, and Holy Ghost is one true manifested God. Now let's look at a brief timeline of quotes on the Godhead from Brother Bram to show his revelation. In 1961, Brother Ram's talking about when he first got baptized, which would have been around 1931 or 1932, depending on your timeline. And brother Ram said before he even heard of the oneness, twist, threeness, four gods, whatever they got, I believe there was one God. And I believe that his name was Jesus. And I was baptized in the name of Jesus Christ by a missionary Baptist preacher cuz I asked him to do it. I've preached it ever since. So when brother was baptized, he didn't even know about all the Godhead debate. He just said, "I want to be baptized in the name of Jesus." Let's listen to the quote. When I was just a boy, before I ever heard of one, two, three gods, four gods, what they got, I believe there was one God. Now, I believe that his name was Jesus. And I was baptized in the name of Jesus Christ by a missionary Baptist preacher because I asked him to do it. I've preached it ever since. There's no scripture in the Bible. You bring me one scripture where anybody was ever baptized in any other. Show me one place in the Bible where anybody's ever baptized using the titles of father, son, holy ghost. Now in 1950, we have the first third person quote where brother talked about a third person of the trinity. It's in God and his people in Little Rock, Arkansas. So it seems Brother Ram believed in three persons. Let's listen to the quote. Lord God came down that third person out into the flesh again and live tonight in his people. Hallelujah. God himself, God the Holy Ghost living in his people. And I think I said the wrong year earlier. I said 1951, but it's actually 1952 where brother Ram said he loved the third person of the Trinity. This is from Early Spiritual Experiences, Hammond, Indiana. Brother Bram said, "We love him, that great third person of the Trinity who burns through our hearts." This is the quote I asked brother Joseph about and he said, "I believe. I believe everything on the tape is a revelation of Jesus Christ." Let's listen to the quote. Truly, we're not much in this world. We're looked down upon, but God, we believe we're accepted in Christ Jesus, and he in return has given us the Holy Ghost. We love him. That great third person of the Trinity who burns through our hearts, and we love him. Oh holy spirit I thank you for your divine leading. Now then we fast forward to July 1960. This is one of the final times brother Ram talks of the third person in a positive manner. It's from what it takes to overcome all unbelief our faith in Washington. Brother Ram says now remember that Jesus I'm talking about is the third person which is the Holy Spirit which is in us God in us. Let's listen to the quote as to be here with us tonight in each one of us. Now remember the Jesus I'm talking about is the third person which is the Holy Spirit which is in us. God in us. Now we get to the definitive sermon from 1961 Revelation 4 part 3. Here's where brother A says trinitarianism is of the devil with thus sayith the Lord and then repeats it. He says it the first time in paragraph 174 and then he repeats it again in paragraph 177. And we're going to listen to this quote and listen twice where he says trinitarians can be saved. He said, ' Do you believe all these people that are trinitarians are of hell? No sir, I believe they are Christians. And then down in paragraph 178, I believe that many thousands of trinitarian people who believe in three gods is saved because they don't know any difference. So very important quote here. Brother Ram comes out publicly with thus sayeth the Lord. This is not brother Ram speaking. This is God speaking. But then he offers grace to those trinitarians who don't know better. Let's listen to the quote. Now my precious brother, I know this is a tape also. Now don't get excited. Let me say this with godly love. The hours approach where I can't hold still on these things no more. Too close to coming. See, trinitarianism is of the devil. I say that. Thus saith the Lord. Amen. Look where it come from. It come from the Nyan council when the Catholic Church become in rulership. The word trinity is not even mentioned in the entire book of the Bible. And as far as three gods, that's from hell. There's one God. It's exactly right. Now do you say then you believe it all these people as trinitarians are of hell? No sir, I believe they are Christians. But the hour is approaching brother where they are sincerely wrong. I ask in brotherly love for any person that hears me on this tape around the world that will come to me and show me one text of scripture or one paragraph in any history that's authentic history where that any person was ever baptized in the name of the father son and holy ghost until the organizing of the Catholic church, I'll change my doctrine. Thank you, Lord. Every person was baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. And my precious brethren, your eyes are blinded to those things. Pray God give you life. Now, if you got scripture to support it, I'll be looking for you're listening for your call. [Music] You're you beyond this tape, you're willfully walking in spiritual ignorance if you don't challenge me on that. You want to know what's light and what's dark? Let's ask God. Remember, I say, "Thus saith the Lord." Amen. Oh, blessed be. If you be me to be his servant, and if that wasn't according to the word, it would be wrong. Then if it is according to the word, it's your duty to come straight in the See what happens. It's a era. I believe that many thousands of trinitarian people who believe in three gods is saved because they don't know any difference. We're going to get to that on down in the message. The next quote I want to show is one month later in February in Long Beach, California. Brother Brandham shows respect to trinitarians. Now, this is an interesting quote because the month before he blasts trinitarianism as of the devil, but a month later when he's outside of his home church in his congregation, he shows grace to them and he says that's fine that you call the Holy Ghost the third person of the Trinity. So, one month before he said, "It's thus sayith the Lord, it's of the devil." But then a month later says, "It's fine if you're trinitarian." So again, I believe this is why trinitarians are saved because brother Ram had grace and mercy on them when he would go and preach in their own congregations, not in his own church. But he showed respect to congregations that were not his own. Let's listen to the quote. Then that same word, Christ the promise, the Holy Ghost, you call it the third person of the trinity. That's fine. That's what it is. Christ the Holy Ghost in you. He was in a pillar of fire once. that he come as made flesh. Now he's come in your flesh. The next quote is this anointed ones the end time where I was asked about it in the debate and brother Ram said you put him a third person, second person or any other person besides God, you're lost. And so again, I have to balance this quote with the other quotes. This quote has no thus sayith the Lord. But I believe Brother Ram is making a valid point. If someone says Jesus is the second person and they say he's not God, then I believe that person would be lost because they're denying the deity of the Lord Jesus Christ. They're just making Jesus just like a regular human prophet. But he was more than a prophet. He was a God prophet, the God prophet. So I think you have to balance this quote out with all the other quotes. It has to agree with the other quotes. There's no thus sayith the Lord here. Let's listen to the quote. He said, "Mr. Brandon, we refuse all revelations." I said, ' Then you have to refuse Jesus Christ, for he is the revelation of God. God revealed in human flesh, unless you see it, you're lost. Jesus said, "Except you believe that I'm He, you'll die in your sin." He is the revelation of God, the spirit of God revealed in human form. You can't believe that, you're lost. If you put him a third person, second person, or any other person besides God, you're lost. Except you believe that I am he, you'll die in your sins. Revelation. And now, lastly, I'll skip ahead to the church age book here in chapter one. Brother Ram says, "It takes a real revelation from the Holy Ghost to see the truth about the Godhead." So again, Brother Ram says, "It takes a real revelation." And remember, in the church age book, Brother M never says all trinitarians are lost. Let's listen to the quote. I admit that it takes a real revelation from the Holy Ghost to see the truth about the Godhead these days when we are in the midst of the perverting of so much scripture. But the prevailing overcoming church is built on revelation. So we can expect God to reveal his truth to us. However, you actually don't need a revelation on water baptism. It is right there staring you in the face. The final quote is from chapter nine, the lessian church age. Brother Ram says, "We have come back to the capstone revelation, the most important revelation of Godhead in the whole Bible. That is Jesus is God. He and the father are one. There's one God and his name is the Lord Jesus Christ." Beautiful quote. Now, I do think some people take this quote too far. I don't believe Brother Ram is saying that the Godhead is the most important revelation in the whole Bible. I believe salvation is the greatest revelation in the whole Bible. Faith in the blood of Jesus Christ is the most important revelation. We are saved by grace, not of works, lest any man should boast. Brother continually said, "Salvation is a major doctrine because it's eternal redemption. It's eternal salvation." And then here's four quotes that came to my mind just now. First, Brother Ram said, "The greatest thing is being saved." This goes along with how salvation is the greatest revelation. Brother Ram said, "The greatest desire any of us can have is to be saved." Because we saw it with Sister Hadtie. Her greatest desire was to see her boys saved. In the third quote, Brother Ram said, "What would be greater than the assurance that we're saved?" So, nothing is greater than the assurance or faith that we're saved, and faith is a revelation. And then in 1963, Perseverance, Brother Ram said, salvation is the greatest miracle. Let's listen to the four quotes. In our mind lays hundreds of great things that you have done. And the greatest of all we can think of is when you saved us from a life of death where in us dwelt death because of sin and trespasses. I said, "Sister Hattie, just say whatever you want to." She said, "The greatest desire in my heart is my two teenage boys that they may be saved." I said, "I give them to you in the name of Jesus Christ." It's the overlap right there. All such thing has happened that thou can't believe. Do you love him with all your heart? Isn't he wonderful? What could we do without him? Not just what could you do? Could you tell me anything that would be greater? If you can show me something greater than that, then I'll I'll I'll sell out what I got and long for that that you show me that's greater than this. Uh this is the greatest thing that I know of. To know with the assurance that we are saved to know that the very God that made the heavens and earth would humble himself and come down and dwell among us and do for us. God's done something for you. He saved you. That's the greatest miracle there is. And then there's so many quotes where brother Ram says trinitarians can be saved. So this quote about the capstone revelation, the most important revelation of Godhead in the whole Bible. So to me, brother Ram's saying the revelation that Jesus is God is the most important Godhead revelation. I don't believe Brother Ram's talking about the Godhead being greater than salvation. So that's just my own humble opinion. That's just my own thought. Please correct me if I'm wrong because all the other quotes from Brother Ram say salvation is the most important major doctrine, major revelation. And so many quotes say trinitarians can be saved. Let's listen to the quote. And now in this last age, we have come back to the capstone revelation. The most important revelation of Godhead in the whole Bible. That is Jesus is God. He and the father are one. There is one God and his name is the Lord Jesus Christ. He is the God of the Amen. He never changes. What he does never changes. He says it and it stands fast. One final quote from the church age book is that brother Ram says when the mark of the beast is literally laid down in the tribulation period he said the mark in the head means that they will have to take the doctrine of the world church system which is trinitarianism etc. So this is what I believe brother was talking about in 1961. There's going to come a time where we can't hold back anymore. There's going to come a time when believing the trinity will actually get someone lost. But that time is not right now. It will be during the great tribulation period. But thank God by the promises of God, those who are baptized with the Holy Ghost will be gone in the rapture. They won't be here during the great tribulation period. So let's listen to that quote. It's from chapter 10 of the church age book, a resume of the ages. Let's listen to the quote. This mark in the head means that they will have to take the doctrine of the world church system, which is trinitarianism, etc., and the mark in the hand, which means to do the will of the world church. With this great power, the church systems will persecute the true bride. This image will try to keep the bride from preaching and teaching etc. Her ministers will be forbidden to give comfort and truth to the people who need it. But before the antichrist in person takes over this complete world system of churches, the true church will be taken away from this world to be with the Lord. God will catch away his bride for the great marriage supper of the lamb. In closing, friends, I hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God, seeing the positive uses when brother Ram uses the word trinity in a positive light. It's also great to see how a prophet of God can grow in revelation. And of course, we can see that in the Bible. Every prophet grew in revelation. Every prophet made human mistakes. Every prophet needed the grace of God. Every prophet needed revelation, continual life-giving revelation from the Lord Jesus Christ. And brother Random meets that same qualification. He's a sinner saved by grace. But of course, a mighty prophet, the Leosian church age messenger, the prophet to the seventh church age, the prophet anointed with the spirit of Elijah to turn our hearts back to the apostolic fathers. So we rejoice in the revelation that Jesus Christ has given to us through the prophet brother William Mary and Brandham. Praise God for the revelation of who Jesus is. He's the first and the last as brother Bam taught in the church age book as the book of revelation teaches. So the first church age had the revelation of Jesus Christ. So does the last church age. We have the revelation of Jesus Christ that he is God manifest in the flesh. Not a second person but the one person of the Godhead. If you have any questions, concerns or testimonies about this video, please contact me. God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart. Very happy to be here this afternoon and again in defense of the gospel of Jesus Christ. to bring the good tidings, the good news that Jesus raised from the dead, living among man today, his church. The same Jesus that was yesterday will be today and forever. He's never failed. [Music]
