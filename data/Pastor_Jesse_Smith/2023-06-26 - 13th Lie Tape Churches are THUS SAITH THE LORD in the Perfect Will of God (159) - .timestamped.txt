[0:00] [Music]
[0:05] that's
[0:07] just me and read
[0:09] [Music]
[0:13] and yes
[0:17] [Music]
[0:33] greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:35] of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of
[0:39] this video is to show the 13th and
[0:41] likely most serious and dangerous lie
[0:44] coming out of Branham Tabernacle located
[0:47] in Jeffersonville Indiana USA for the
[0:50] sake of conserving time I'm not going to
[0:52] review the previous 12 lies as it seems
[0:55] this video will be a long one so the
[0:58] 13th out of a list of over 24 lies
[1:00] coming out of Branham Tabernacle is
[1:02] Brenham Tabernacle leadership has said
[1:05] with thus saith the Lord they are in the
[1:08] perfect will of God by playing the tapes
[1:13] let's listen to the quote from March 11
[1:15] 2018 and you'll hear the pastor of
[1:19] Brenham Tabernacle say it's a word from
[1:21] the Lord and then say it's thus saith
[1:23] the Lord
[1:23] he says it twice in this preliminary
[1:26] speech Let's listen to the LIE
[1:30] [Music]
[1:36] [Applause]
[1:42] [Music]
[1:44] [Applause]
[2:03] thank you
[2:07] [Applause]
[2:16] [Applause]
[2:19] amen
[2:21] you are in my perfect will
[2:25] playing those tapes
[2:27] I'm coming for you
[2:30] [Music]
[2:31] [Applause]
[2:45] we all want to be in his perfect will
[2:47] he's sure as I'm sitting here when he
[2:50] spoke to me he said keep playing the
[2:52] tapes you're in my will
[2:54] I know
[2:58] [Music]
[3:04] that amen
[3:12] praise the name of the Lord
[3:14] [Applause]
[3:18] friends I want to humbly say that I
[3:20] cannot see under any circumstances how
[3:23] this statement with us saith the Lord is
[3:26] actually from the Lord Jesus Christ
[3:28] first of all this would be a very
[3:30] unusual thing for the Lord to say since
[3:33] the Lord never said those words through
[3:36] his Prophet brother Branham with us
[3:38] saith the Lord nor did the Lord write
[3:41] those words in the Bible the Bible never
[3:43] says to the laodicean church age
[3:46] Believers that they are to silence and
[3:48] decrease the five-fold ministry decrease
[3:51] living preachers and increase a dead
[3:55] preacher a preacher who's passed on
[3:58] second friends how can Branham
[3:59] Tabernacle be in the perfect will of God
[4:02] when they're breaking so many words of
[4:04] God in the Bible how can you be in the
[4:07] perfect will of God when you're breaking
[4:09] Paul's Revelations which were the
[4:11] perfect will of God from the Lord Jesus
[4:13] Christ himself
[4:15] and third Branham Tabernacles already
[4:17] lied 12 times this is the 13th lie and
[4:20] there's at least 11 more lies to go they
[4:23] have a sad strong delusional pattern of
[4:26] constantly adding to the Bible and
[4:29] taking away from the Bible
[4:31] friends how can the Holy Spirit tell
[4:34] this group of people that they're in his
[4:36] perfect will when they've already broken
[4:38] the will of the Holy Spirit as revealed
[4:41] in the Holy Bible
[4:43] the broken God's will in Ephesians 4
[4:46] 8-16 by decreasing living preachers they
[4:51] broke in Hebrews 10 24 and 25 by not
[4:53] physically gathering together more as
[4:56] they see the day approaching
[4:58] they're literally idolizing the tapes of
[5:01] brother Branham by making every word on
[5:02] tape thus saith the Lord
[5:04] and I do want to share this quote from
[5:06] the pastor Branham Tabernacle on his
[5:08] blog post from April 10 2021 he said
[5:11] quote the tapes can never be wrong end
[5:14] quote
[5:15] this is complete idolatry friends I have
[5:19] over 80 almost 90 examples of how
[5:22] there's mistakes on brother Branch tapes
[5:24] which he told us there were brother Ram
[5:27] said he was not infallible brother
[5:29] Brandon said there's Mix-Ups on the
[5:30] tapes so Brenham Tabernacle has proven
[5:33] themselves untrue to the original word
[5:36] of God that Jesus Christ revealed to
[5:38] Saint Paul
[5:39] a few other scriptures they've broken is
[5:42] numbers 27 12-23 where God told Moses to
[5:47] set a man over the congregation because
[5:50] Moses was going to die and yet Branham
[5:53] Tabernacle calls brother Branham their
[5:55] pastor but he can't be because he's dead
[5:58] because of this they also break Joshua
[6:00] chapter 1 verses 1 and 2 where the Lord
[6:03] spoke unto Joshua and said Moses my
[6:06] servant is dead if Jesus Christ is the
[6:09] same yesterday today and forever then
[6:11] Jesus Christ would tell the church
[6:12] brother Branham my servant my Prophet is
[6:14] dead and now I'm going to continue to
[6:16] lead my church by the fivefold ministry
[6:18] through the anointing of the Holy Ghost
[6:22] random Tabernacles also breaking second
[6:24] Timothy 4 2 where Paul told preachers
[6:26] preach the word Paul didn't say play the
[6:29] tape or sit down and press play
[6:32] random Tabernacles also breaking Romans
[6:35] 10 13-15 how beautiful are the feet of
[6:38] them who publish good news how can they
[6:41] hear except they hear a preacher and how
[6:44] can they preach except they be sent God
[6:46] is always called living men to preach
[6:49] God's Living Word
[6:51] Branham Tabernacle also breaks second
[6:53] Timothy 2 verse 2. Paul told Timothy
[6:55] commit thou to Faithful Men Who Shall be
[6:58] able to teach others also not Faithful
[7:01] Men Who would be able to press play
[7:04] also Joshua chapter 2 has been
[7:07] completely changed by Branham Tabernacle
[7:09] it's the story of Rahab receiving the
[7:11] two spies and today Branham Tabernacle
[7:13] says that's the true model for the
[7:15] fivefold ministry today Rahab is the
[7:18] bride and the two spies are the Tate
[7:20] boys the true faithful ministry as
[7:22] Branham Tabernacle and their leadership
[7:24] has already stated and have already put
[7:25] it on videos for everyone to see but of
[7:28] course that's a lie if you look in
[7:30] context the two spies were not part of
[7:33] the priesthood the teaching and
[7:35] preaching priesthood the aaronic
[7:37] priesthood so Branham Tabernacle is
[7:39] breaking the type of Joshua chapter 2.
[7:42] those two spies had to be in submission
[7:44] to the priesthood that God had already
[7:47] ordained through the prophet Moses the
[7:49] same is true today any Tate boy has to
[7:52] be in obedience to Paul's gospel and
[7:54] Paul's gospel in Ephesians 4 11 sets the
[7:57] fivefold ministry as God's dress wear as
[7:59] brother Brandon said as God's leadership
[8:01] and they lead by the word of God through
[8:03] the anointing of the Holy Ghost
[8:06] another verse Branham Tabernacle denies
[8:09] is first Timothy 4 verse 14 which says
[8:11] neglect not the gift that is in thee and
[8:15] of course when Branham Tabernacle says
[8:17] tapes are number one put brother Branham
[8:19] back in the Pulpit it automatically
[8:22] leads to preachers neglecting their
[8:24] gifts
[8:25] and that of course is a sin
[8:28] and this verse ties in with Matthew 25
[8:30] verse 25 in Jesus's parable of the five
[8:34] talents it says and I was afraid and
[8:37] went and hid thy talent in the earth and
[8:39] lo there thou Hast that is thine
[8:42] so in this Parable the one talented man
[8:45] buried his talent and did not use it
[8:47] that's exactly what Branham Tabernacle
[8:49] is encouraging preachers to do
[8:51] bury their talents don't use their
[8:53] talents as much as they could do not
[8:55] invest in them just press play and obey
[8:58] so these are just a few of the
[9:00] scriptures Branham Tabernacles breaking
[9:01] and yet they're claiming to be in the
[9:04] perfect will of God
[9:05] so friends we'd have to throw out all
[9:07] these verses and More in order to make
[9:10] Brenham Tabernacles pastors thus saith
[9:12] the Lord's statement true
[9:14] how sad and how strong is the strong
[9:17] delusion that is upon Branham Tabernacle
[9:20] and all those who follow their man-made
[9:22] Creeds and instructions
[9:24] friends I do believe humbly that this
[9:27] statement from Branham tabernacle's
[9:29] Pastor makes this pastor a false prophet
[9:32] because he's spoken something in the
[9:35] name of the Lord that is wrong and
[9:38] hasn't repented of it here it's been
[9:40] over five years
[9:41] and the pastor still has not repented of
[9:44] this thus saith the Lord's statement
[9:45] that again breaks all these verses I've
[9:49] just covered and more
[9:51] now I'd like to go through about 21
[9:53] quotes from Brother Branham and show how
[9:55] Brenham Tabernacle is denying them
[9:58] based upon this thus saith the Lord's
[10:00] statement that they're in the perfect
[10:01] will of God
[10:03] the first three quotes are about how
[10:05] Paul's gospel revealed in the Bible
[10:07] cannot change
[10:09] and we'll play these quotes back to back
[10:12] Branham Tabernacles pastor and then
[10:14] God's true Prophet brother William
[10:16] Branham and show how the current Branham
[10:18] Tabernacle Pastor is contradicting his
[10:21] father
[10:22] the first quote is from God's provided
[10:24] way of healing 1954. brother Branham
[10:27] says God's word cannot alter it does not
[10:30] change
[10:31] Paul said anyone who changed anything
[10:34] taught in scripture would be accursed
[10:36] and brother Brandon said I'm a
[10:37] fundamental believer in the Bible he's
[10:39] ready to hang his soul on any phase of
[10:43] the Bible any sentence and brother
[10:45] random is right brother Branham was a
[10:47] Fundamental Bible believer and the
[10:49] current Brenham Tabernacle leadership is
[10:51] not
[10:52] simply put random Tabernacles currently
[10:55] changing Ephesians 4 11 so they are not
[10:58] Fundamental Bible Believers let's listen
[11:00] to the quotes back to back
[11:03] [Music]
[11:10] you are in my perfect will
[11:14] keep playing those tapes we all want to
[11:17] be in his perfect will he sure as I'm
[11:20] sitting here when he spoke to me he said
[11:22] keep playing the tapes you're in my will
[11:25] I know this is it is the saith the Lord
[11:29] it is
[11:33] what makes us America
[11:36] but I believe that whatever God has said
[11:41] his word does not change
[11:43] one
[11:44] one
[11:48] I believe
[11:51] [Music]
[11:52] it would come and teach any other thing
[11:54] that
[11:57] thing that let him be unto you a curse
[11:59] Galatians 1 8 so I am a fundamental
[12:03] believer in the Bible what the Bible
[12:06] says I
[12:08] have truth and
[12:10] in any phase Bible or any any sentence
[12:14] comma whatever it might be that God's
[12:16] word is Everlasting true
[12:22] the second quote is from the sardisian
[12:25] church age 1960 brother Brandon said any
[12:28] other kind of Doctrine other than what
[12:29] Paul said is wrong and brother Branham
[12:32] warns that Jesus will take his part out
[12:35] of the book of life when they take out
[12:36] part of Paul's gospel so again the fact
[12:39] that Branham Tabernacle is changing the
[12:41] fivefold ministry
[12:43] is extremely dangerous Paul taught the
[12:46] five-fold ministry would continue
[12:47] unchanged until we all come in the unity
[12:50] of the faith where did Paul teach the
[12:52] tape Church idolatry that's going on
[12:54] today he never did let's listen to the
[12:57] quotes back to back
[12:58] I've returned from Arizona with the word
[13:02] of the Lord for us
[13:04] keep playing
[13:06] [Applause]
[13:08] like well
[13:11] playing those tapes we all want to be in
[13:14] his perfect will it sure as I'm sitting
[13:16] here when he spoke to me he said keep
[13:19] playing the tapes you're in my will I
[13:22] know this is it is the saith Lord
[13:25] it is
[13:37] yeah
[13:39] the bag was correct amen
[13:46] I love this third quote from the church
[13:49] age book page 83 or other random quotes
[13:52] Galatians 1 verse 8 any other gospel
[13:55] other than Paul's is cursed brother Ram
[13:58] said the original word could not change
[14:01] not even a DOT or dash of it well the
[14:04] random said God's word can't change
[14:06] brother Ram said the Ephesians look
[14:08] those false Apostles of the eye and said
[14:10] you are not saying what Paul said get
[14:12] back to the word and that's what I'm
[14:14] doing on these videos other men of God
[14:16] are doing behind their pulpits we're
[14:18] looking message Believers in the eyes
[14:20] and saying get back to the word of God
[14:22] get back to the true five-fold Ministry
[14:24] not the tape Church movement that's a
[14:27] movement of idolatry of brother Branham
[14:29] and his tapes
[14:30] brother random said his ministry a
[14:33] prophet to the laodocene church age
[14:34] would be known that he's the real one
[14:37] sent from God
[14:38] because he would be in the word exactly
[14:40] as God gave it to Paul he won't deviate
[14:43] from that word for a moment not by one
[14:45] iota and then he said get back to the
[14:48] word or you are lost and again when did
[14:50] Paul ever say the fivefold ministry is
[14:52] going to end preachers need to sit down
[14:55] and put the dead Prophet back in the
[14:57] pulpit and living men should stop
[14:59] preaching God's Living Word Of course
[15:01] Paul never taught that so we know
[15:03] Branham Tabernacle is wrong let's listen
[15:05] to the quotes back to back
[15:07] I've returned from Arizona with the word
[15:10] of the Lord for us
[15:12] keep playing the games
[15:15] you are in my perfect will
[15:19] playing those tapes we all want to be in
[15:22] his perfect will it sure as I'm sitting
[15:25] here when he spoke to me he said keep
[15:27] playing the tapes you're in my will I
[15:30] know this is it is the saith Lord
[15:34] it is
[15:36] here it is in Galatians 1 8.
[15:39] though we are an angel from heaven
[15:41] preach any other gospel unto you than
[15:44] that which we have already preached unto
[15:46] you let him be accursed
[15:48] it was the apostles who brought the
[15:50] original word to the people
[15:52] that original word could not change not
[15:54] even a DOT or dash of it Paul knew it
[15:57] was God who had spoken to him so he said
[16:00] even if I come and try to give a second
[16:02] Revelation try to make one little change
[16:04] in what I gave originally let me be
[16:06] accursed
[16:08] you see Paul knew that first revelation
[16:10] was correct
[16:11] God can't give a first revelation than a
[16:14] second revelation
[16:15] if he did he would be changing his mind
[16:18] he can give a revelation and then add to
[16:20] it as he did in the Garden of Eden when
[16:23] he promised the seed to the woman and
[16:25] then later designated that seed had to
[16:27] come through Abraham and then later said
[16:30] it would come by the same Bloodlines in
[16:32] David
[16:33] but it was the same Revelation it only
[16:36] gave the people more information to help
[16:38] them receive and understand it
[16:40] but God's word can't change
[16:43] it came exactly as revealed Hallelujah
[16:47] and see what those false apostles were
[16:49] doing
[16:50] they came with their own word those
[16:52] Ephesians knew that word as Paul had
[16:54] taught it they were full of the Holy
[16:56] Ghost by the laying on of Paul's hands
[16:59] they looked those false Apostles in the
[17:01] eye and said
[17:02] you are not saying what Paul said you
[17:05] are therefore false
[17:07] oh that sets my heart on fire get back
[17:10] to the word it is not you that really
[17:13] tries the Apostle and prophet and
[17:15] teacher it is the word that tries them
[17:18] one of these days there is going to come
[17:20] a prophet to the laodicean church age
[17:22] and you will know if he is the real one
[17:24] sent from God or not yes you will for if
[17:28] he is of God he will be in that word
[17:31] exactly as God gave it to Paul he won't
[17:33] deviate from that word for a moment not
[17:35] by one iota
[17:37] in that last stage when there will be
[17:40] many false prophets appearing watch and
[17:42] see how they keep telling you that if
[17:44] you don't believe them and what they say
[17:46] you will be lost
[17:48] but when that last day Prophet comes on
[17:51] the scene if he is truly that prophet he
[17:53] will be crying out get back to the word
[17:56] or you are lost
[17:57] he won't build on a private Revelation
[17:59] or interpretation but on the word amen
[18:02] and amen
[18:05] next I want to look at two quotes about
[18:07] the perfect will of God
[18:09] remember Romans 12 1-2 states that we
[18:12] can prove the perfect will of God and of
[18:14] course how is it proven by the word of
[18:16] God
[18:17] 's perfect will is proven by Paul's
[18:20] unchanging gospel remember Paul said all
[18:23] men would be judged by his gospel Romans
[18:25] 2 verse 16 and Galatians 1 6-12
[18:29] random Tabernacles pastor and their
[18:32] Church cannot change Paul's gospel the
[18:34] first quote is from the church age book
[18:36] page 368 chapter 10 and this quote shows
[18:40] how Balaam didn't want the perfect will
[18:43] of God so God gave him the permissive
[18:45] will of God well the ram said did God
[18:47] change his mind no sir so I believe this
[18:50] is what likely has happened at Branham
[18:52] Tabernacle Branham Tabernacle did not
[18:54] want the perfect will of God the
[18:56] fightful ministry preaching by the Holy
[18:58] Ghost so God gave them his permissive
[19:01] will
[19:02] and remember friends brother Branham
[19:03] said every man needs a home Church a
[19:06] living Pastor a post of Duty and Branham
[19:09] Tabernacle has none of these they don't
[19:11] go to church physically they just play
[19:14] tapes in their homes they claim a dead
[19:16] man brother Brenham is their real pastor
[19:18] and they're not at their posted Duty
[19:20] amongst the Believers they have no post
[19:22] of Duty let's listen to the quotes back
[19:25] to back
[19:27] learn from Arizona with the word of the
[19:30] Lord for us
[19:31] keep playing the game
[19:34] you are in my perfect will
[19:38] keep playing those tapes we all want to
[19:41] be in his perfect will it sure as I'm
[19:44] sitting here when he spoke to me he said
[19:46] keep playing the tapes you're in my will
[19:49] I know this is it is the saith Lord
[19:53] it is
[19:56] that he was not a true word Prophet for
[19:58] when God told him not to go to honor
[20:01] balak with his presence he sought to go
[20:03] anyway for he was motivated by his Lust
[20:05] For Gold and prestige
[20:07] so God let him go
[20:09] the perfect will of God gave way to the
[20:11] permissive will of God because of the
[20:14] heart desire of Balaam God actually said
[20:17] go ahead
[20:19] did God change his mind no sir God had
[20:23] his way regardless of Balaam going
[20:25] Balaam did not know the will of God God
[20:28] had his way regardless
[20:30] it was Balaam who was the loser for he
[20:32] bypassed the word
[20:35] the second quote about the perfect Wills
[20:37] from the choosing of a bride I love this
[20:39] story brother Branham says he talked to
[20:42] a woman who was a preacher and brother
[20:44] Branham said I don't doubt that one bit
[20:47] that God called the woman to preach now
[20:49] that may surprise us but in the context
[20:51] brother I am saying the woman preacher
[20:53] is just like Balaam but Alum didn't want
[20:55] the perfect will so God told him to do
[20:57] the permissive will brother Graham says
[20:59] that's what's happened to the woman
[21:00] preacher she didn't want the perfect
[21:02] will of God that she shouldn't preach so
[21:04] God gave her the permissible will of God
[21:06] that she could preach and I believe this
[21:08] applies perfectly to this video and the
[21:11] thus saith the Lord's statement that
[21:12] Branham Tabernacle is in the perfect
[21:14] will of God by just pressing play God's
[21:17] original word from the Bible cannot be
[21:20] denied and I don't doubt one bit that
[21:23] the Lord may have told random
[21:25] Tabernacles Pastor they're in his will
[21:27] but it cannot be the perfect will of God
[21:30] because the Bible never says press play
[21:32] and obey the Bible never says limit the
[21:35] fivefold ministry the Bible never says
[21:38] stay at home and don't physically attend
[21:40] church the Bible never says the seventh
[21:42] Church age messenger would have no
[21:44] mistakes in any of his words on tape so
[21:48] friends God may be permitting them to
[21:49] play tapes but it's not according to his
[21:52] original will unless Us in the quotes
[21:54] back to back foreign
[21:56] [Music]
[21:58] with the word of the Lord for us

[22:11] his perfect will as sure as I'm sitting
[22:13] here when he spoke to me he said keep
[22:16] playing the tapes you're in my will
[22:18] I know this is it is the saith Lord it
[22:23] is
[22:24] I know sisters many of you say the Lord
[22:27] called me to preach
[22:30] I'm not going to argue with you but I
[22:33] will tell you the woman says you not to
[22:36] do it
[22:37] she shall not teach or serve any
[22:40] Authority but the pain sounds
[22:43] when you say the Lord told me to do it I
[22:45] don't doubt that one bit
[22:47] did you hear my message
[22:58] God might permit you to preach I don't
[23:01] say anything but it's not according to
[23:03] his original word and plan
[23:10] therefore she's not supposed to do
[23:14] now I want to do about 16 quotes brother
[23:16] random makes about the fivefold ministry
[23:19] the first quote is from what it takes to
[23:22] overcome all unbelief our faith from
[23:25] 1960
[23:26] where Lorena mentions the five-fold
[23:28] ministry and he says those gifts keep
[23:30] the church perfected and clean and ready
[23:32] for the coming of the Lord so the fact
[23:34] that Branham Tabernacle is deleting
[23:36] these five-fold living preachers that
[23:39] shows they are unclean and not ready for
[23:42] the coming of the Lord according to this
[23:43] quote from Brother Branham let's listen
[23:45] to the quotes back to back

[24:37] of an hour
[24:40] the second quote is from things that are
[24:42] to be 1965. brother random said these
[24:45] pastors and young men would sweep the
[24:48] people onto the coming of the Lord
[24:49] Brother Brown never said that Tate boys
[24:51] would sweep the people onto the coming
[24:53] of the Lord let's listen to the quotes
[24:55] back to back
[24:57] [Music]

[25:12] be in his perfect will as sure as I'm
[25:14] sitting here when he spoke to me he said
[25:17] keep playing the tapes you're in my will
[25:23] it is
[25:26] I am very thankful for these open doors
[25:29] that have had to go into and the
[25:31] inspiration
[25:34] that's causing
[25:36] cause that know that my days are
[25:38] numbered and know what now that these
[25:40] young men can take this message and
[25:42] sweep it on to the coming of the Lord if
[25:44] he doesn't come and my generation
[25:48] the third quote is from the Samaritan
[25:50] Church age book brother random said Cora
[25:53] in type said the fivefold ministry
[25:56] failed and then he says the cores of
[25:58] today have The Prestige of money social
[26:00] leadership business ability and friends
[26:03] that's exactly what's going on in
[26:04] Branham Tabernacle they have Prestige of
[26:07] millions of dollars over a hundred
[26:09] million dollars and yes they can do a
[26:12] good Tate business they make quality
[26:14] products but that does not qualify them
[26:16] to lead the Bride of Jesus Christ Paul
[26:19] said in Ephesians 4 8-16 the fifo
[26:23] ministry the living preachers with five
[26:25] preaching gifts lead the church let's
[26:28] listen to the quotes back to back
[26:31] [Music]
[26:39] in my perfect will
[26:42] keep playing those tapes we all want to
[26:45] be in this perfect will it sure as I'm
[26:48] sitting here when he spoke to me he said
[26:50] keep playing the tapes you're in my will
[26:53] I know this is it is
[26:57] [Music]
[26:59] if you don't think this is true just
[27:02] listen to this
[27:03] all over the world in both Pentecostal
[27:05] and fundamental groups they are
[27:07] organizing the businessmen they have
[27:09] invaded the pulpit without a call from
[27:11] God they have styled themselves the
[27:13] Fishers of Men and the founders of a
[27:15] move of God and they say the gifted
[27:18] Ministry of Ephesians 4 10-13
[27:21] God gave the church has failed so they
[27:24] are taking over
[27:25] here we are right in the midst of the
[27:27] Fulfillment of Prophecy called the gain
[27:30] things of Korah and they don't even know
[27:32] that they have fulfilled it
[27:34] they are blindly going on preaching
[27:36] experience for truth
[27:38] may God have pity on them may their eyes
[27:41] be opened before it is too late
[27:43] oh listen to me when did The Prestige of
[27:46] money social leadership business ability
[27:48] or sheer mental prowess ever qualify a
[27:51] man for Spiritual leadership or give any
[27:54] weight to the word of God
[27:56] and when in any way materiality or human
[27:59] values begin to show as the media by
[28:01] which God works instead of the Holy
[28:03] Spirit alone
[28:04] then we are fighting against God not for
[28:07] him
[28:08] the third quote is from questions and
[28:11] answers on the seal 63 the ask brother
[28:13] random should evangelists continue on
[28:15] the field brother Ram said of course he
[28:17] said don't change a thing and of course

[29:22] bride of Christ have a Ministry before

[29:25] fivefold ministry

[30:24] message of the hour amen the bride of

[30:34] sure she's got a Ministry great
[30:36] Ministries the ministry of the hour
[30:37] it'll be so humble
[30:40] a fourth quote is from questions and
[30:42] answers for 1964. brother Brandon was
[30:45] asked would we still be on fire and
[30:47] preach the gospel he says keep preaching
[30:49] as hard as you can preach Brothers stay
[30:51] with him right behind you brother
[30:53] Branham never said there's going to come
[30:55] a time when you're not going to need to
[30:56] preach and then you can just press play
[30:58] and Obey you can just sit down and press
[31:00] play Let's listen to the quote
[31:07] is the time over no keep preaching just
[31:10] as hard as you can preach brother stay
[31:11] with it I'm right behind you
[31:15] the eighth quote is from perseverance 62
[31:17] brother Brandon mentions the fivefold
[31:19] ministry and he said will be so with the
[31:22] word until the whole thing will work
[31:24] right up to the coming of the Lord
[31:26] so we know Ephesians 4 11 is going to
[31:28] work right up to the Rapture brother I'm
[31:31] never said well it'll work up right
[31:32] towards the end and then we'll do a tate
[31:35] Ministry where just I'll preach and
[31:37] everybody else can sit down and obey me
[31:39] and my tapes let's listen to the quotes
[31:42] I believe that there's a church coming
[31:45] into that perfection
[31:47] that Ministry of profession hear the
[31:52] offices who are impossible
[31:55] [Music]
[31:57] Anthony of the church that pastors and
[32:00] teachers and so forth to be so with the
[32:02] world until the whole thing will work
[32:04] right up through the coming of them
[32:06] I believe that now we were nearing that
[32:11] that I believe so
[32:13] the next quote is from Behold a greater
[32:16] than Solomon is here in 1962 brother
[32:18] random mentions the five full ministry
[32:20] and he says the teachers and the pastors
[32:22] and evangelists they're the ones who
[32:25] brings the word so that's what's going
[32:27] on today amongst the true bride of
[32:29] Christ the fivefold ministry preachers
[32:30] are bringing the word brother man never
[32:32] said right before Jesus returns the fifo
[32:36] ministry will sit down they won't bring
[32:38] the word and everybody will sit down and
[32:40] just press play
[32:41] let's listen to the quotes
[32:50] [Music]
[32:55] are the perfecting and now they are
[32:59] teachers and that pastors and advantages
[33:02] they're the one who brings the word and
[33:04] the prophets are to combing those little
[33:07] corners of for individuals you see them
[33:09] fourtail pains it's coming and so forth
[33:13] the 10th quote is from Jesus Christ the
[33:15] same yesterday today and forever 1962.
[33:18] brother Brown lists the five full
[33:19] ministry he says they keep the church in
[33:22] order they perfect the church he said no
[33:25] matter how much these men here are
[33:26] gifted to preach you've got to also
[33:28] believe what they preach or it isn't
[33:30] going to do one good notice brother
[33:33] Branham never said well this is all
[33:34] going to change and later on you all you
[33:37] all have to listen to my tapes that will
[33:39] do you good and then the five-fold
[33:41] ministry living preachers they will do
[33:43] you no good anymore so it's sad right on
[33:46] Tabernacles followers are not doing what
[33:48] brother Brandon said
[33:50] they've got to listen to The Living
[33:51] five-fold Ministry preachers as they
[33:53] point to the word of God and then it
[33:55] will do them good let's listen to the
[33:57] quotes
[34:00] [Applause]
[34:02] five different gifts is that right God
[34:04] has not his nine gifts to the local
[34:06] churches on one of you the five Minister
[34:08] gives Apostles prophets teachers pastors
[34:11] is that right five spiritual gifts now
[34:15] those gifts are for the perfecting of
[34:18] the church to keep the church and all
[34:19] our pastors and teachers and evangelists
[34:21] and Prophets and so forth now it's gifts
[34:25] they're all gonna have what's these men
[34:27] here are gifted to preach you've got to
[34:29] also believe what they preach yeah all
[34:31] right let's go do one good they can just
[34:32] preach on and on and on you'll never get
[34:34] saved your direct confusion be lost
[34:36] that's right amen right you've got to
[34:39] believe what they're saying
[34:41] the 11th quote is from the influence of
[34:44] another 62. I love that brother Branham
[34:47] says the businessmen don't understand
[34:49] the approach to the ministry because
[34:51] they don't have god-called gifts then
[34:54] brother random lists the five-fold
[34:56] ministry gifts and I believe this is
[34:58] what has happened in Branham Tabernacle
[35:00] they're businessmen they're not
[35:01] preachers and this is proven by what
[35:04] brother Branham said they're not
[35:05] listening to the fivefold ministry
[35:07] they're not even preaching like the
[35:09] fivefold ministry preachers are supposed
[35:11] to do let's listen to the quotes
[35:19] a businessman the first place you don't
[35:23] understand the approach
[35:25] you don't understand they're approach to
[35:28] the ministry because the ministry is a
[35:31] good piano gift
[35:34] s
[35:35] [Music]
[35:37] we're successful Graphics teachers
[35:40] advances and casters
[35:47] the 12th quote is from putting on the
[35:49] whole armor of God brother random says
[35:51] the fivefold ministry is God's dress
[35:53] wear it's his army and then he said any
[35:56] office that denies any of this word is
[35:59] not God's dressing it's a wolf in
[36:02] sheep's clothing
[36:03] so friends I believe Brandon Tabernacle
[36:05] has exposed themselves their leaders are
[36:08] wolves and sheep's clothing because they
[36:10] deny many words of this Bible not just
[36:13] one they deny many as I went over at the
[36:16] beginning let's listen to the quotes
[36:43] amen
[36:53] ities
[37:17] me
[37:19] and she
[37:24] just takes lots of words that remember
[37:27] that's God wants to speak in his word
[37:30] 13th quote is from and then their eyes
[37:33] were open and they knew him brother
[37:34] random says the fivefold Ministries are
[37:36] all for the perfecting of the church how
[37:38] could we turn one down and say the other
[37:40] one isn't so so that's the exact air
[37:43] that Branham Tabernacle has committed
[37:45] they want the prophet gift but they
[37:48] don't want any of the others or as I've
[37:50] even heard the pastors say brother
[37:52] Branham fulfilled all the fivefold
[37:54] ministry gifts so that's why they can
[37:56] just sit down press play and Obey which
[37:59] they don't obey they don't obey all
[38:01] these quotes on the fightful ministry
[38:03] the perfect will of God and not adding
[38:05] or taking away from Paul's gospel let's
[38:07] listen to the quote
[38:09] and God set some in the church first
[38:11] apostles and Prophets teachers advances
[38:15] and pastors all for the protecting of
[38:18] the church
[38:19] how can we turn one down and say the
[38:22] other isn't so God does it himself amen
[38:26] there's nothing in the world but just
[38:27] healing yourself to the Holy Spirit and
[38:31] the Holy Spirit takes over from there
[38:33] and you don't know what you're doing
[38:34] it's the Holy Spirit Sovereign word
[38:38] a 14th quote is from Balman Gilead 1959
[38:41] brother Brown says these five-fold gifts
[38:44] are all in operation we cannot bypass
[38:47] one and say there's teachers without
[38:49] saying there's evangelists he said all
[38:51] of them are for the perfecting of the
[38:53] body of Christ
[38:54] so basically Branham Tabernacle saying
[38:56] we have brother Branham he's the prophet
[38:58] or he's all the five gifts we don't need
[39:00] any other preachers our brother Brandon
[39:02] said you can't say that you have to say
[39:04] there's five preaching gifts and they're
[39:06] making us ready for the coming of the
[39:08] Lord let's listen to the quotes
[39:16] offices and all the members of the body
[39:20] the first is
[39:23] apostles
[39:25] which is missionaries the word Apostle
[39:28] means one that sent the word missionary
[39:31] means one that sense the same word
[39:35] Apostles prophets teachers pastors
[39:39] advances these offices God sits in the
[39:43] church they're all in operation or
[39:46] should be we cannot bypass one and say
[39:49] there's teachers without saying advances
[39:51] we cannot say there's evangelists
[39:53] without saying there is Apostles we
[39:56] cannot say there's Apostles without
[39:57] admitting there is prophets
[39:59] all of them are for the perfecting of
[40:03] the body of Christ
[40:05] the 15th quote is from gifts 1956
[40:08] brother and lists the fivefold ministry
[40:10] and he says the prophet couldn't say
[40:12] you're not in it speaking to another
[40:14] office of the fivefold ministry
[40:17] brother Branham said Christ was in the
[40:19] fullness of these five gifts He said
[40:22] Each preaching gift is like a ray of
[40:23] light it's just one of them raised off
[40:26] of God and it all points right back to
[40:29] God isn't that sad random Tabernacle is
[40:32] not pointing us to the Bible they're
[40:34] pointing to their own man-made Creeds
[40:36] and dogmas we never find these 12 13 and
[40:40] 24 lies in the Bible
[40:42] well the ram says all five gifts are all
[40:45] little lines of God that's put into the
[40:46] church for the perfecting of the Saints
[40:48] isn't that sad Branham Tabernacle wants
[40:51] to deny the lights or the Rays of God
[40:53] from shining into their services it's
[40:56] extremely sad let's listen to the quotes
[41:01] [Applause]
[41:18] an apostle
[41:20] the classic
[41:22] [Applause]
[41:31] Church
[41:39] [Applause]
[41:46] experience
[41:47] [Applause]
[41:56] [Applause]
[41:59] [Laughter]
[42:07] the next quote is from and then Jesus
[42:10] came 1957 brother random lists the
[42:13] fivefold Ministries says that's his
[42:15] proof his ministering Spirit to the
[42:17] church to bring the body of Christ
[42:18] together how can Branham Tabernacle come
[42:21] together in the body of Christ when they
[42:22] deny the living preaching five-fold
[42:25] Ministry gifts today brother Branham
[42:28] never said I fulfilled all the five
[42:30] preaching gifts so there's no more
[42:32] preaching gifts they all need to sit
[42:33] down and press play and Obey let's
[42:35] listen to the quote
[42:37] because God has set in the church five
[42:40] different gifts
[42:41] Apostle prophets teachers advances
[42:46] pastors
[42:48] those are for the perfecting on the
[42:50] church
[42:51] that is his proof his menacing Spirit to
[42:56] the church to bring the body of Christ
[42:58] together
[43:00] the final quote is from questions and
[43:01] answers part three
[43:03] brother random is asked is he the only
[43:05] one that should preach and brother
[43:07] Brandon of course says no every man that
[43:09] feels a call of God upon his life get
[43:11] into the ministry and start preaching we
[43:12] need them the sad thing is random
[43:15] Tabernacle says oh yeah you can preach
[43:17] but you have to do a denominational
[43:18] mandate you've got to catch our man-made
[43:21] denominational Vision you've got to play
[43:23] the tapes first as your primary
[43:25] preaching Ministry of your services and
[43:28] of course that's a lie that's not found
[43:30] in the Bible thank god brother random
[43:32] said men are anointed all over the world
[43:33] to preach the gospel and Saints we still
[43:35] need them today let's listen to the
[43:37] quote
[43:42] preach but you
[43:45] we have seen
[43:47] you're we have seen you ordained man we
[43:53] do don't believe you would do that if
[43:56] there were not if they were not to
[43:59] preach
[44:00] Mercy brother sister ever who told you
[44:04] that nobody's preached with me you're
[44:05] not sure if you have four subjects with
[44:07] all that no every matter feels a call
[44:12] and run upon his life
[44:13] get into the ministry start preaching we
[44:16] need them
[44:17] man of God are not all over the world to
[44:20] preach the gospel see I'm just one
[44:23] little Pebble on the
[44:24] among men
[44:27] so uh there's this many there's more
[44:30] eligible more worthy more of anything to
[44:33] preach than me I'm just one little hun
[44:37] gry
[44:41] so it's just uh you know what I mean any
[44:45] man just
[44:46] man is to preach the gospel
[44:48] by God's grace I want to add two more
[44:50] quotes in these quotes brother Brandon
[44:52] says God did not choose Machinery to
[44:54] preach the gospel and of course this
[44:57] shows the error of the thinking of
[44:59] Branham Tabernacle to just press play
[45:01] and let machines preach the gospel
[45:04] that's an error
[45:06] God only uses man to work with
[45:09] he doesn't use organizations it doesn't
[45:11] use Machinery he could have done it but
[45:13] he chose a man
[45:15] he could choose the Stars the wind or
[45:17] anything to preach the gospel but he
[45:19] choose man he does not change himself he
[45:23] notice in the second quote brother
[45:25] Branham said he ordained men to preach
[45:27] the gospel not Machinery it was men and
[45:31] of course that's speaking of the
[45:32] fivefold ministry because that agrees
[45:34] with all the other quotes from Brother
[45:35] Branham and most importantly it agrees
[45:38] with the Bible Ephesians 4 verse 11.
[45:43] the reason we know that this day has got
[45:46] to be civil amen Anthony I always works
[45:50] in Simplicity yes but God in the
[45:53] beginning that could have made the son
[45:55] preach the gospel or the winds preach
[45:57] the gospel or an angel preaching the
[46:00] gospel but he ordained man for that
[46:03] purpose and he never changes
[46:06] he never ordained denominations
[46:13] not Machinery Mechanical Devices or any
[46:17] Angelic being it was man
[46:21] in closing
[46:23] friends this has been a serious sobering
[46:26] video about the strong delusion that
[46:28] would be upon random tabernacle's
[46:31] leadership to say thus saith the Lord
[46:33] they're in the perfect will of God and
[46:35] yet deny all these quotes from Brother
[46:37] Branham and of course all these Bible
[46:40] verses presented on the video as well I
[46:43] hope it's been a help to you and I want
[46:45] to remind the viewers that I've spoken
[46:46] to two childhood friends of Brenham
[46:49] Tabernacles pastor and both told me
[46:51] they've never heard their pastors say
[46:53] thus saith the Lord in his entire life
[46:55] and I believe he's 67 years old now this
[46:59] means 2018 was the first time this
[47:02] supposed Prophet had spoken with us
[47:04] saith the Lord and he was wrong
[47:07] so this goes back to the video I made
[47:08] that I do not believe random Tabernacles
[47:11] Pastor is a prophet brother Branham said
[47:13] he felt and prayed that his son would do
[47:16] double times double or four times all
[47:18] that brother random did and of course we
[47:20] know that hasn't happened
[47:21] [Music]
[47:34] than our people
[47:37] that's my prayer anyhow and I believe
[47:39] it'll be here
[47:40] [Music]
[47:47] he'll take my place
[47:49] where the random son has not spoke 28
[47:52] squirrels into existence has not
[47:54] traveled around the world 28 times and
[47:57] has not done one discernment prayer line
[47:59] like his father let alone four times all
[48:02] the numbers of prayer lines that his
[48:04] father brother Branham operated by the
[48:06] gift of the Holy Ghost
[48:08] and remember friends we're five years
[48:10] from this thus saith the Lord's
[48:13] statement that came from Brenham
[48:14] Tabernacles pastor and we can see the
[48:16] fruits of his ministry and their Church
[48:19] constantly adding to the word of God
[48:22] constantly taking from the word of God
[48:23] constantly creating their own man-made
[48:25] Creeds dogmas mandates without any of
[48:29] Paul's gospel to vindicate any of the
[48:32] lies they're telling and of course
[48:34] Paul's gospel would never vindicate a
[48:36] lie
[48:37] friends let's pray that their leadership
[48:39] and followers are not beyond the point
[48:41] of no return please pray for that in
[48:44] your personal private prayer time as I
[48:46] do
[48:48] if you have any questions concerns or
[48:50] testimonies about this video please
[48:51] contact me
[48:53] God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[48:56] the desire of your heart
[48:58] [Music]
