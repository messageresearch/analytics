[1:59] brand new case of of the old time kind
[2:01] old time religion that there screaming

[2:06] right see one oldfashioned conversion
[2:09] get out the alt CED boohoo through and
[2:11] to see a 10,000 standing just say well
[2:14] I'll try it try it he's not a Christ a
[2:18] try he's one to
[2:19] accept live or die sink or drown take
[2:23] him
[2:25] anyhow yesterday standing in the
[2:27] backyard of of my sister that lives next
[2:30] door to his sister Woods we was noticing
[2:33] a little cocoon that had formed on a
[2:36] tree and the wind was blowing it back
[2:39] and forth and she was telling me that in
[2:42] the streams of the deserts I believe it
[2:44] she was reading an article about the
[2:47] coocon it's a little worm that goes in
[2:50] there and Farms a little shell around
[2:53] him to keep him through the cold and but
[2:55] when it comes time this person who was
[2:58] dealing with the little fellow they seen
[3:01] the little uh Kakuna moving and wiggling
[3:05] around and they felt so sorry for the
[3:07] little fellas so they thought they would
[3:09] just cut the end of it off and let the
[3:12] little bug out because when he come out
[3:15] of there he was going to have wings he
[3:17] went in as a bug or a little worm he
[3:21] comes out with wings in a more like a
[3:24] glorified State amen and as he was
[3:27] wiggling and pulling and hugging and
[3:30] beating and biting and trying to get out
[3:32] of the coocon they felt sorry for him so
[3:36] they thought they would just give him a
[3:37] sharp cut so they go get the scissors
[3:40] and cut the end off and when they cut
[3:43] the end off the little bug come out but
[3:46] he never was right because he didn't
[3:49] have any strength in his body he had no
[3:52] he couldn't use his wings and I think
[3:55] that's the way we've tried to duplicate
[3:57] that get down to the altar
[4:00] and say this that and the other and try
[4:02] to get the people back to God into the
[4:05] church to come to Christ just let them
[4:08] boohoo out that's all just work your way
[4:11] out of it that's all if you try to give
[4:14] them a shortcut they'll never able to
[4:17] stand I just like to see them struggle
[4:20] and work at it till God gives them a
[4:22] real birth in the natural
[4:24] way just give them the real birth just
[4:28] people say well honey I think you prayed
[4:31] enough you just stay there until you're
[4:33] ready to fly that's the only thing God
[4:36] has a way of doing it oh well if you
[4:38] want to be good just go over to jar the
[4:40] church Mama went to the same church that
[4:44] might be just fine but you know it takes
[4:47] a death to bring a life amen and we've
[4:50] got to
[4:51] die until then we are so de that there
[4:55] can be a new life come in that our wings
[4:58] will be valuable and our our experience
[5:02] that we have will be valuable to others
[5:05] and to ourselves praise God we all know
[5:08] that the Bible teaches the new birth and
[5:11] they substituted handshakes and
[5:13] everything else for the new birth but
[5:16] it'll never take the place of the new
[5:18] birth it's got to be an experience of
[5:22] born
[5:24] again we all know that any kind of a
[5:28] birth is a mess
[5:31] when a baby's born if it's on the floor
[5:34] if it's in a Shu pile or in a pink
[5:37] decorated hospital room it's a
[5:40] mess but it brings
[5:42] life that's what the new birth is it's a
[5:45] mess but it brings life glory to God it
[5:48] ain't a style or a put on or Declaration
[5:51] of Creeds it's a baptism of the Holy
[5:54] Ghost and that's the secret of the real
[5:58] believing Church
[6:01] borned again oh I know you get up in the
[6:04] altar crying and boohoo and squealing
[6:07] the slobber but it brings life it takes
[6:10] a starch out of you it makes you
[6:13] something that you ought to be it takes
[6:16] all the world and the stiff neck out of
[6:19] you and today we just walk up and say I
[6:23] take Jesus for my personal savior
[6:25] that'll never take the place of the New
[6:27] Birth when man and when and come to the
[6:30] Altar and forget where they are and
[6:32] who's around them until they really die
[6:35] out and are born again all night prayer
[6:37] meetings and the power of the Holy Ghost
[6:40] get back into the church
[6:42] again that's what we need today is a
[6:45] good old time St Paul's Revival in the
[6:47] Bible Holy Ghost preach back in the
[6:50] power yet in the Simplicity of preaching
[6:52] it's in the power of the Resurrection to
[6:56] and the new birth is no
[6:58] conception it's no it's no
[7:00] difference it's a it's a
[7:03] mess when a man is born again he makes
[7:06] him do things he wouldn't think he was
[7:07] going to do it might make you Squall and
[7:10] boohoo and carry on it might make you do
[7:13] things that you didn't think you would
[7:15] do but it brings new
[7:18] life that's the main thing is new life I
[7:22] don't care what level I have to meet it
[7:24] on I want new birth and new
[7:27] life I don't care where P that is a Holy
[7:30] Roller or whatever it is I want new life
[7:34] and New Life can only come when death
[7:36] comes to the
[7:38] believer or the
[7:40] unbeliever people are afraid of the new
[7:42] birth they're afraid of it now any birth
[7:46] I don't care what level it's on it's a
[7:49] mess you think if it's out you're in a
[7:51] pig pin any birth makes a mess if it's
[7:53] in a pig pin if it's in a if it's in the
[7:56] cow table if it's in a pink decor ated
[7:59] hospital room I don't care where a birth
[8:01] take place it's a mess and the new birth
[8:04] is the same it'll make you do things
[8:06] that you didn't think you do you might
[8:08] cry boohoo and rub around on the altar
[8:10] no matter what you do I've never asked
[8:13] God it wouldn't do no good to try to
[8:15] bring the new birth to my level I want
[8:17] to meet God's level of the new birth and
[8:19] receive it I don't care what I have to
[8:23] do someone said not long ago I'm afraid
[8:25] to receive the Holy Ghost I'm afraid it
[8:27] would make me speak in tongues like them
[8:29] others I don't care if I spoke in
[8:31] tongues talked in tongues crow in
[8:33] tongues or anything else I want the Holy
[8:36] Ghost that's the meain principle I don't
[8:38] care what level it is I'll meet God on
[8:41] his level what he wants to say is right
[8:43] that's where I want to stand that new
[8:45] birth that changes a man changes a woman
[8:48] changes the desire changes her appetite
[8:52] rational with God until you can hold on
[8:54] until the blessing comes and God will
[8:57] change you like he did Jacob suppl her
[9:00] to Israel
[9:02] Prince so many people not say oh if I'd
[9:05] have to get down there and boohoo and
[9:06] cry if I'd ever had to speak in them
[9:08] tongues oh not me oh well my mother
[9:11] would turn me out my Society well they
[9:13] never play cards with me again don't
[9:15] worry if you do that you won't play any
[9:16] more cards anyhow that's right you don't
[9:18] have to worry about that and your
[9:20] societies will be a bunch of trash to
[9:22] you that's exactly right CU there will
[9:24] only be one Society that's the blood of
[9:27] Jesus Christ and the redeemed from the
[9:29] foundation of the world Hallelujah
[9:31] that's the Society of Jesus Christ amen
[9:34] blood was talked about despise rejecting
[9:37] cast out call idiots everything else but
[9:41] that don't take away the promise of God
[9:43] God remains the same yesterday today and
[9:45] forever and no man's no better than his
[9:47] word and his word sticks just as good
[9:49] now as it ever did that every man that
[9:51] will believe it you know when you're
[9:54] when you take an ocean to meet Jesus
[9:55] he'll make you do some of the silliest
[9:57] things you just ruin all all your presed
[9:59] you think he won't Squall and cry and
[10:02] boohoo but you will if you want to see
[10:03] him you you'll just do anything to see
[10:05] him but little old Jacob he didn't care
[10:08] how he had to get it that birth right's
[10:10] what he wanted no matter how he got it
[10:12] just so he got it am if he had G up the
[10:14] alt scream and cry and boooo and snot
[10:16] excuse me or you know right up in his
[10:19] eyes I didn't say that and so excuse me
[10:21] so get out your cry through till he got
[10:23] it why he got it see he didn't care how
[10:26] he got it just so he got it
[10:29] somebody says brother people there
[10:32] booing on that alar and crying and
[10:34] crying I don't want it that way you
[10:36] won't get it
[10:39] amen for when the spirit of God is in
[10:42] you it lines up with the word of God and
[10:45] if it denies a word of God then it isn't
[10:48] you haven't got the right shot yet the
[10:51] allong you're not an ulated sin still
[10:54] lays at the door unbelief in the word so
[10:58] it takes the toxine of God to kill sin
[11:02] and sin is number one
[11:05] killer yes it is it kills and it kills
[11:08] to the uttermost so we know that it's a
[11:11] that it's a the sin that does the
[11:13] killing so it's a toxine that people
[11:15] just refuse to take it they don't like
[11:19] it they don't like the thought of New
[11:23] Birth now we know that any birth is a
[11:26] mess I don't care if it's in a pig pin
[11:28] or if it's
[11:29] uh Pink decorated hospital room any
[11:32] birth is a mess and the new birth is
[11:35] nothing less it's a
[11:37] mess right it'll make you boohoo and cry
[11:41] and carry on like you then the office
[11:43] mess you every
[11:45] in but it'll do you
[11:48] good amen Jesus said except the corn
[11:51] wheat falls in the ground and dies it
[11:52] abides
[11:54] alone and the people don't want to die
[11:57] all right you want to be alive God in
[12:00] the world and still you want to be
[12:02] religious so you accept an intellectual
[12:05] conception of it and then when you do
[12:08] that you're still dead in sin and
[12:11] trespasses and that's what makes people
[12:13] act and do the way they do because the
[12:15] spirit that's in them dominates your
[12:17] life say well other people do this well
[12:20] you're not like the other people you are
[12:23] dead in your life is heing God through
[12:25] Christ and heal by the Holy Spirit
[12:27] Hallelujah all right
[12:30] see you didn't try the toxin it's just
[12:33] because the people don't want to try it
[12:36] now you got to die you got to ro that's
[12:39] a trouble that people St gring out the
[12:40] Altar and get some kind of sensation
[12:43] jump up and shake hands with the
[12:44] preacher go out and get some kind of a
[12:46] Dogma or Creed and recite it and say I
[12:49] belong to so and so I belong to so and
[12:51] so are you a Christian I'm so and so a
[12:54] Christian is to be
[12:56] Christlike yes Christlike is to believe
[12:59] the
[13:00] word if you don't believe the word then
[13:02] he can't be Christlike how can you say
[13:04] you're a Christian and deny half of the
[13:06] word that's right if the Holy Spirit
[13:08] wrote the word the Holy Spirit confirms
[13:10] the word and the Holy Spirit is the
[13:13] word the word abiding in you brings
[13:17] God's promises to every
[13:19] believer
[13:20] amen that word means so beit I believe
[13:24] it with all my heart it's the word of
[13:26] the Living
[13:27] God
[13:30] before a seed can reproduce itself it's
[13:33] got to die and Order and not only die
[13:36] but it's got to
[13:37] rot in order to get new life out of it
[13:40] it's got to die and rot in itself and so
[13:44] does every siner every man no matter how
[13:47] highly he's educated and how much he's
[13:48] polished how many uh degrees he has in
[13:52] the church or so forth how many of these
[13:54] things how many colleges he's educated
[13:56] out of he's got to die to his own Theory
[13:59] he's got to die to himself he's got to
[14:02] die to everything to be reborned again
[14:04] by the Holy
[14:07] Ghost you make him cry and boohoo and
[14:10] speak in tongues and jump up and down
[14:12] and carry on like a maniac but he's got
[14:15] new
[14:17] life that's what it takes to do it he
[14:20] got to have new life they're afraid of
[14:22] the new birth the new birth is a mess
[14:24] now they call New Birth all everything
[14:26] oh sure I believe in been born again and
[14:29] they say they're born again and deny the
[14:31] word say they have the Holy Ghost and
[14:33] take the scriptures and plainly teach
[14:35] the Bible how it is and then they say oh
[14:36] that was for another age and mean that
[14:39] the Holy Ghost that's in you will
[14:40] witness to that is for another age when
[14:42] he said it's to you and to your children
[14:44] to them as far off even as many as the
[14:46] Lord Our God shall call amen hallelujah
[14:49] he can't lie if there's a spirit in you
[14:52] that denies that to be the truth then
[14:54] it's not the holy spirit cuz the Holy
[14:56] Spirit wrote the word
[15:00] amen that's as solid as I know how to
[15:02] place
[15:04] it that's what's the matter with the
[15:06] Christian church today has tried to
[15:09] accept some manufactured way in instead
[15:11] of beating its way through to the
[15:13] kingdom of
[15:15] God it's tried some other
[15:18] way and it won't work you kill your
[15:21] patient you kill your your your baby
[15:25] God's Baby by trying to manufacture some
[15:28] way oh there's no need of this here
[15:30] boohoo crying there's no need of this
[15:32] all this oh yes there is there's no need
[15:35] of this dying unless there's death that
[15:37] cannot be
[15:38] birthed birth only comes by the
[15:40] substance of death l a corner wheat
[15:43] falls into the ground and dies it abides
[15:45] alone it must Rock and get into
[15:47] corruption and then from that corruption
[15:49] Springs forth life no other way will
[15:52] work it must first corrupt and be uh
[15:56] corrupted and that's way we must be D
[15:59] to ourselves and be borned a new of the
[16:02] Holy Spirit now they haven't found any
[16:05] better way for a chicken to get out of a
[16:07] shell than to Peck his way through
[16:09] that's God's provided way for him and
[16:11] he's equipped to do it amen God wouldn't
[16:15] provide a way without providing an
[16:17] instrument for it so he provided the way
[16:21] and provided the instrument for the
[16:23] chicken to free self
[16:27] amen the word needed a savior one day
[16:31] and God provided his
[16:33] son when he come he was not recognized
[16:36] he was not wanted they said they wanted
[16:38] a savior but when God sent it in his
[16:41] way they asked for a king God give him a
[16:48] baby they wanted a mighty man to stomp
[16:51] out
[16:51] Rome God give him a little crying baby
[16:54] in a barn amen see but it was God's
[16:58] providing way we but they didn't want it
[17:01] the way God want to understand it they
[17:02] want the way they wanted it see so
[17:04] therefore they went into chaos because
[17:07] they didn't accept his way there were
[17:09] some that did this was the birthplace of
[17:12] the church was it
[17:14] Pentecost after Jesus had commissioned
[17:16] them to go into all the world and preach
[17:17] the gospel to Every Creature these signs
[17:19] shall follow them that believe he had
[17:21] told them what to do told them to go up
[17:24] city of Jerusalem and wait they needed a
[17:27] charter
[17:29] amen they needed a charter they wanted
[17:33] to draw up a Creed God give them the
[17:35] Holy
[17:38] Ghost they needed a denomination but God
[17:41] give them a
[17:42] spirit what a difference how God does do
[17:44] it the Holy Ghost was God's provided way
[17:48] to lead the church not a bishop amen the
[17:51] Holy Ghost that's what that was her
[17:53] Charter and from that day to this has
[17:55] been ever true Born Again child's
[17:57] Charter
[17:59] the Holy
[18:01] Ghost
