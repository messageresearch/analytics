[0:03] We feel today that there's not too much
[0:06] time left,
[0:08] but we must be up and doing.
[0:12] We must be urging and compelling
[0:15] that every member that's been ordained
[0:19] beforehand to the body of Christ that we
[0:22] spread this message till everyone hears
[0:24] so we're sure that every effort that we
[0:27] could have put forth has been done.
[0:31] Greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:32] of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of
[0:35] this video is to share the different
[0:36] reasons I started a YouTube channel back
[0:39] in 2013 by God's grace. This coming
[0:42] October will be the 11th year that I've
[0:45] done YouTube videos. My first video was
[0:47] called True Repentance, part one of
[0:49] three, released October 3rd, 2014.
[0:54] So, it's hard to believe it's been that
[0:55] many years already, but here we are 459
[0:58] videos later by God's grace.
[1:01] And I guess the first reason that I
[1:02] started the YouTube channel was just for
[1:04] general outreach. I've always loved
[1:06] outreach, whether it's books or videos
[1:10] or tracks or pamphlets about the
[1:12] revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ for
[1:15] this day, the end time message. There's
[1:17] been numerous tracks, sermons, books
[1:20] that have helped me over the years.
[1:22] Especially tracks about water baptism in
[1:24] the Godhead. Those were very effective
[1:27] for me seeing the history of how baptism
[1:31] was changed and how the trinity dogma
[1:34] was added to the Bible. It was added to
[1:36] the false church system. But I'm so
[1:39] thankful for people that took the time
[1:40] to write the books or the pamphlets or
[1:42] make the videos that spread the gospel
[1:45] of the Lord Jesus Christ. I made a
[1:47] recent video about the radio ministry of
[1:49] brother Neville that brother Brandham
[1:50] supported so positively. Of course,
[1:54] brother Ram did outreach with his
[1:56] campaigns, but also with his tapes. He
[1:59] talked about how the tapes would go into
[2:01] the jungles of Africa and so forth. And
[2:03] the message is still going around the
[2:05] world today. That's my humble belief
[2:07] about the shout voice Trump. The shout
[2:10] is still going out. As I said a couple
[2:12] years ago, this former Amish group down
[2:14] in central Ohio received the shout. They
[2:18] heard the shout to get them ready for
[2:21] the bridegroom's coming by the grace of
[2:23] God. So, I just love outreach. Whether
[2:25] God uses a book or a pamphlet or a
[2:28] postcard, I love how God's word will not
[2:31] return void. A precious brother named
[2:34] Mike Durle who passed away a number of
[2:35] years ago. I always remember his
[2:37] testimony. He was living in sin,
[2:40] blatant, obvious, abominable sin. And
[2:43] one day, somebody handed him a small
[2:45] business card that just talked about
[2:47] brother Brandham being sent as a
[2:49] prophet. He wrote a letter. This was
[2:51] before the internet. He wrote a letter
[2:53] to Voice of God Recordings, got free
[2:55] books, and came into the message and he
[2:58] left his abominable lifestyle and served
[3:01] the Lord faithfully until the Lord took
[3:03] him home. So, I just love outreach.
[3:06] Second reason, and this is kind of
[3:08] related to outreach, is that there was a
[3:10] lot of loved ones in my family, even my
[3:11] parents, of course, aunts, uncles,
[3:14] cousins that did not believe the message
[3:16] right away. And so I wanted a platform
[3:19] where they could hear the truth straight
[3:22] from me and I'd be smiling at times and
[3:24] happy not always preaching with all the
[3:26] emotion that I I do perhaps the
[3:29] seriousness although that can be
[3:31] effective as well. I've had different
[3:32] family members come to our services and
[3:35] thoroughly enjoy them and there is a lot
[3:37] of motion. There's a lot of noise, a lot
[3:39] of worship. The Bible says praise him
[3:41] with a loud noise. But in my heart, I
[3:43] just wanted uh family members to be able
[3:46] to hear the truth that I received
[3:48] because it was life-changing to me. As
[3:50] some of you know, my testimony, the
[3:52] first sermon I ever heard was Serpent
[3:53] Seed, not preached by Brother Brandham,
[3:55] but preached by Chris Hall, who has left
[3:57] the message. But the truth of that
[4:00] sermon or those two sermons on Serpent
[4:03] Seed opened my eyes and I've never been
[4:06] the same by God's grace. The Bible
[4:07] became a new book, a new Bible as
[4:10] brother Ram said, because of the
[4:12] revelation of Jesus Christ. And brother
[4:14] Ram said, "Serpent seed doesn't save
[4:15] you, but it just shines more light on
[4:17] the truth that we're all trying to see."
[4:20] And so that was monumental for me to
[4:21] hear the truth of the serpent seed. And
[4:24] I wanted my family to be able to hear
[4:26] the truth. Even if they were afraid to
[4:28] come to church, that's fine. Perhaps
[4:30] they would go on my YouTube channel and
[4:33] hear the truth there. And I've gotten
[4:35] numerous reports over the years that my
[4:37] family would do that. I used to be on
[4:38] Facebook. I'm not anymore. Perhaps I'll
[4:40] get back on at some point in order to
[4:42] spread the gospel. But I used to share
[4:44] links to my YouTube videos on my
[4:46] Facebook page and family members would
[4:48] email me or text me and say they watch
[4:51] my videos. So that was a huge blessing
[4:53] to me. That's all I really want is for
[4:55] each person to have a chance to hear the
[4:56] gospel. Just like brother Ram said,
[4:58] everybody deserves a chance to hear the
[5:00] gospel of Jesus Christ.
[5:02] The third reason I felt led to start a
[5:04] YouTube channel was because previous to
[5:06] 2013, I'd made about four overseas trips
[5:10] to South America. I was invited to go
[5:13] along. My former pastor would invite me
[5:16] and I just loved to go. It was so
[5:17] wonderful. Sometimes I'd go for 7 8 9 10
[5:19] I think one time up to 13 days. But
[5:22] around 2013, I think I made my fourth
[5:24] and final trip. And that's because we
[5:27] started having the ability to do
[5:28] FaceTime. And I would FaceTime with my
[5:30] wife and children. By that time, I had
[5:33] four children and my wife was pregnant
[5:34] with our fifth. And we already live as a
[5:37] family. We live 3 hours away from any
[5:40] other family. And we're a very small
[5:42] church. Everybody's working busy. And so
[5:45] all the burden of taking care of the
[5:47] children was all my wife and she's
[5:48] pregnant. And so both she and I would
[5:50] miss each other. so much. 13 days is a
[5:52] long time uh for me to be away from my
[5:55] wife and children and we would just cry
[5:56] and I would miss my children so much and
[5:58] my wife of course I love the work of the
[6:00] Lord, the ministry of the Lord, but I
[6:02] just kind of had to make a decision
[6:03] there. Do I continue in evangelism or
[6:06] should I just focus on pastoring to be
[6:08] with my family? So, I felt led of the
[6:10] Holy Ghost to focus on pastoring which
[6:12] is fine. Uh the Bible talks about
[6:14] convenient seasons. There's convenient
[6:16] seasons to do certain ministries. Even
[6:19] look at the Proverbs 31 woman. There's
[6:21] no way she was doing all of those
[6:22] ministries at the same time. She's
[6:25] probably focusing in her early days as a
[6:28] wife and mother on rising early, getting
[6:30] the children's clothes, getting the
[6:32] meals ready, and everything like that.
[6:34] And then later on, she was probably
[6:35] looking at fields, buying them,
[6:36] purchasing them. So, as the Bible says,
[6:38] there's a time and season for
[6:39] everything. And I was also given advice
[6:42] from older ministers saying, I should
[6:45] stay with my family as much as possible.
[6:47] try not to leave them. One minister in
[6:49] particular told me that he felt bad he
[6:51] left his children behind too many times.
[6:54] And so he advised me as a young father,
[6:56] stay with your children as much as
[6:57] possible. And then on top of that, I
[6:59] kept getting invites from people around
[7:01] the world. And I'm also a school
[7:04] teacher, so I only have a few months
[7:05] really to travel. It's really June,
[7:06] July, and the beginning of August. And
[7:08] so I felt bad turning down these
[7:10] invitations, but at the same time, I got
[7:12] to make a choice. Do I support my family
[7:13] or do I leave my family? So, I wanted to
[7:16] support my family, be with my children
[7:18] more, support my wife cuz she has no
[7:20] help really being that we're 3 hours
[7:22] away from our natural families, our
[7:25] in-laws and our parents by God's grace.
[7:29] And so, making a YouTube channel would
[7:31] allow these preachers that invited me to
[7:33] preach to hear my ministry if they felt
[7:36] led to. Of course, they don't have to,
[7:38] but they're the ones that invited me.
[7:39] So, I thought I would make a YouTube
[7:41] channel so these foreign ministers could
[7:44] hear my preaching if they felt they
[7:46] enjoyed what the Holy Spirit was
[7:48] preaching through me. I'm nothing. I'm a
[7:50] sinner saved by grace, but everybody has
[7:51] one gift. If you're a preacher, you have
[7:53] one of the five gifts, perhaps more. If
[7:55] you're not a preacher, you have at least
[7:57] one of the nine gifts of the Holy Ghost.
[7:58] So, if these brethren that invited me
[8:00] felt I had some type of a gift, well,
[8:02] then they could enjoy that gift as I
[8:04] yielded to the Holy Ghost. But I'm
[8:06] nothing. As John 15:5 says, "Apart from
[8:08] me, Jesus says you can do nothing." So
[8:11] this YouTube channel gave me the feeling
[8:13] where I could somehow help these
[8:16] brothers who invited me to hear the
[8:18] ministry that God had given me by the
[8:20] grace of God. And the fourth reason and
[8:23] final reason I started this YouTube
[8:24] channel was because in 2012, the Believe
[8:27] the Sign website switched over from
[8:30] being supportive of Brother Brandham to
[8:32] being against Brother Brandham. And so
[8:34] that came as a big shock to me because I
[8:35] had links on our church's website and so
[8:38] forth to believe the signs website
[8:40] because they were supportive of brother
[8:41] Brandham. And then I had to take the
[8:42] links down of course. And even in my
[8:44] 2020 debate, I told the man I debated,
[8:47] Rod Bergen, I told him one of the
[8:49] reasons I started my channel was to help
[8:50] people like him, people that did not
[8:53] believe the message any longer, to try
[8:55] to show them what I felt was the truth
[8:57] of the message, that Brother Brandham
[8:59] was a genuine prophet of God. And in
[9:02] recent years, I've just called it
[9:03] defending brother Brandham because he
[9:05] was a Bible-based prophet of God. And
[9:08] when uh Believe the Sign did their
[9:10] switch over to being against Brother
[9:11] Brandham, I didn't have a lot of the
[9:12] answers to their questions. And that
[9:15] kind of bothered me. And I wanted to
[9:16] find the answers. And through these
[9:18] years of studying, making videos and so
[9:21] forth, it's really helped me to provide
[9:23] answers for people that have questions.
[9:25] And I wanted to be honest and humble.
[9:27] Like if I don't have an answer, well, I
[9:29] want to go search an answer because the
[9:30] Bible says that be ready to give every
[9:32] man an answer for the hope that he has
[9:33] within him. Of course, I know there's
[9:36] other verses in Proverbs where it says
[9:37] to not answer people if they're being
[9:40] foolish or something like that. But if
[9:42] people have genuine questions, they're
[9:43] not name calling, they're not berating
[9:45] me or something like that, then I want
[9:46] to try to answer their questions humbly
[9:48] as the scripture says, the Bible does
[9:50] say prove all things. So, we need to do
[9:52] that as well. And I have honestly so
[9:54] enjoyed the questions because it
[9:56] sharpens me. If I'm not sure of
[9:58] something, I got to go back to the
[9:59] scripture. I got to go back to the
[10:01] quotes. I got to find the balance
[10:02] because the Bibles are absolute. If
[10:04] brother Ram said something, then I want
[10:06] to find it in the Bible. And if not,
[10:09] well, then he's allowed his own humble
[10:10] opinions just like everybody else.
[10:12] Brother Ram said his opinion was no
[10:13] different than anybody else's opinion.
[10:14] So, Brother Ram was a humble, godly,
[10:16] holy ghostfilled Christian by the grace
[10:18] of God. And I think it's okay to ask
[10:20] questions. There's nothing wrong with
[10:21] asking questions. And so for me, I
[10:23] wanted to be able to answer questions
[10:25] through the scripture. And answering
[10:27] questions has certainly sharpened me, my
[10:30] faith, and I wanted to prove to myself
[10:32] and others that what I believe is based
[10:34] upon the Bible. And if there is things
[10:36] Brother Ram said that aren't in the
[10:37] Bible, well, that's fine. He's allowed
[10:39] to have his opinion. Then those aren't
[10:40] my core beliefs. But all of my core
[10:42] beliefs come from the scripture because
[10:44] the scripture is my absolute. And if we
[10:47] have the Holy Ghost, it'll always point
[10:48] us back to the word. Jesus said every
[10:51] man should live by every word that
[10:54] proceeds out of the mouth of God. So
[10:55] that's what we want to do. We want to
[10:56] take all our beliefs back to the word of
[10:58] God. And I've enjoyed this online
[11:00] ministry so much as this visual shows.
[11:02] You know, my channel reached a peak
[11:04] there at the end of 2018 and 2019 and
[11:06] then it's just been decreasing since
[11:09] then, which is okay. So, at the
[11:11] beginning of my ministry started with
[11:13] larger topics, more general topics,
[11:15] makeup in the Bible, repentance,
[11:17] Godhead, marriage and divorce, general
[11:19] topics. And now recently, I've been able
[11:21] to reach out to lots of other topics,
[11:23] questions and answers, quote videos. I'd
[11:26] also say I started off with a lot of
[11:28] majors and now I'm down into minors by
[11:30] the grace of God. Minor subjects, but
[11:32] it's a blessing. It's always a a help to
[11:34] me. It's a good way to stay in the word
[11:36] of God. I believe Paul told Timothy,
[11:37] "Give yourself h wholly to these things,
[11:40] studying the scripture, exhortation."
[11:43] And so that's one benefit of the YouTube
[11:45] channel as well. Helps me stay focused
[11:46] in the word of God. Iron sharpens iron.
[11:48] So when I get questions or emails, even
[11:50] against the message, that does sharpen
[11:52] me. I try to humbly answer the questions
[11:55] and do the best I can by the grace of
[11:56] God. No man's perfect. I don't have all
[11:58] the answers, but I know Jesus Christ has
[12:00] all the answers. We'll learn a lot of
[12:01] them on this side, but we're going to
[12:02] learn even a lot more on the other side
[12:05] by the grace of God. So friends, I hope
[12:07] this video was a blessing by the grace
[12:08] of God. Thanks for all your support, all
[12:10] your comments, all your questions. I
[12:13] love the word of God. I love Jesus
[12:15] Christ. I love the Holy Ghost. I love
[12:18] the message of the hour. It's a joy to
[12:20] make videos. Yes, it's a labor at times
[12:23] as well, but as Paul said, it's a labor
[12:24] of love. I love the word of God. I love
[12:27] spreading the word of God. If you feel
[12:29] led to share these videos, please do by
[12:30] the grace of God.
[12:32] If you have any questions, concerns, or
[12:34] testimonies about this video, please
[12:35] contact me. God bless you and may Jesus
[12:39] Christ be the desire of your heart.
[12:43] Very happy to be here this afternoon and
[12:44] again in defense of the gospel of Jesus
[12:47] Christ to bring the good tidings, the
[12:50] good news that Jesus raised from the
[12:52] dead, living among man today, his
[12:54] church. The same Jesus that was
[12:57] yesterday will be today and forever.
[13:01] It never fails.
