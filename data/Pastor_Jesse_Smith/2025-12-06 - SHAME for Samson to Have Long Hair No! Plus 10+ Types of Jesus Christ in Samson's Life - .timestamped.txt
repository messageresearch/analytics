[0:03] Long hair is a a Nazerite bow. It showed
[0:06] that you've cut yourself from the world
[0:07] to obey the word.
[0:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Samson, let his hair grow out for
[0:11] a Nazerite bow.
[0:14] &gt;&gt; Greetings, friends, in the mattress name
[0:16] of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of
[0:19] this video [music] is to answer a
[0:20] viewer's question about Samson. This is
[0:23] an excellent question and I'll just read
[0:25] his question here. I received through
[0:27] email.
[0:29] So it says in 1 Corinthians 14:1, it is
[0:33] said that it is a shame [music] for a
[0:34] man to have long hair. And I say amen to
[0:37] that. But I am a little bit confused
[0:39] [music] about Samson who had long hair.
[0:41] Please could you shed some light on this
[0:44] for me? [music] Again, an excellent
[0:46] question. If it's a shame for a man to
[0:49] have long hair according to 1
[0:50] Corinthians 11, then why could Samson
[0:53] have long hair? And that's what we'll
[0:55] look at here today by God's grace. Let's
[0:57] start with the scripture. 1 Corinthians
[0:59] 11 1-16. It's important to look at the
[1:02] beginning of this chapter because Paul
[1:04] gives the eternal headship for the
[1:07] entire universe. At the head of
[1:09] everything is God, the invisible spirit.
[1:11] Under God is Christ, the son, the body
[1:14] of God. Since God's invisible, he needed
[1:17] a visible body. That's his son, Jesus
[1:20] Christ. Under Jesus Christ is man and
[1:22] under man is woman. And then Paul after
[1:26] laying this out goes into the meaning of
[1:28] hair. In verse 6 he says it's a shame
[1:31] for a woman not to be covered with her
[1:33] covering which is her long uncut hair
[1:35] whether she's shorn or shaven. It's a
[1:37] shame whether it's trimmed cut or
[1:40] totally shaved off. It's a shame for a
[1:42] woman to either trim shorn or shave her
[1:45] head because she's in the image of man.
[1:49] She's to the glory of man. And then the
[1:51] Bible says in verse 14, "Does not even
[1:54] nature itself teach you that if a man
[1:55] have long hair, it's a shame unto him?"
[1:58] Verse 15 is the key verse for women
[2:00] because it says, "Her hair is given her
[2:02] for a covering, not a doily, not a hat,
[2:05] not a cap. No man-made hair covering is
[2:09] required for a woman by God. God only
[2:12] requires her long uncut hair as a
[2:14] covering." So again, in verse 14 says,
[2:17] "It's a shame for man to have long hair.
[2:18] Why did Samson and other men have long
[2:20] hair in the Old Testament? That's a
[2:22] great question. The answer is in Numbers
[2:24] chapter 6 where God says, "If any man
[2:26] make a vow unto me, then he's going to
[2:29] separate himself for God's purpose for a
[2:32] time and season of his life." And so
[2:34] from this text, it looks like men and
[2:36] women could take vows to God and they
[2:39] would either last a lifetime or a
[2:41] short-term vow by the grace of God. We
[2:44] know Samson's was a lifetime vow as the
[2:47] book of judges tells us. So it was not a
[2:50] shame for Samson to have long uncut hair
[2:52] because he was under a vow to God. He
[2:54] was under a purpose to God. And the long
[2:57] uncut hair symbolizes full obedience to
[3:00] God, under the full authority of God.
[3:04] And that's what it represents for a
[3:05] woman in the New Testament as well and
[3:07] the Old Testament. Her long uncut hair
[3:09] represented she was under full obedience
[3:11] to her husband. So when a woman cuts her
[3:14] hair, she's showing she's not under the
[3:16] headship of her husband. And that denies
[3:19] and shames her head, which is her
[3:21] husband. And then that shames the head
[3:23] of the husband, which is Christ. And
[3:24] then that shames the head of Christ,
[3:26] which is God Almighty, the invisible
[3:28] spirit of God. So long uncut hair
[3:30] represents being under complete headship
[3:32] according to 1 Corinthians 11:1-16 and
[3:34] Ephesians 4:24, where the Bible says the
[3:37] woman should be subject to her husband
[3:40] in everything. Listen,
[3:43] a hair to a woman is a Nazerite bow.
[3:50] Hair to Samson was a Nazerite bow.
[3:54] And when a woman cuts off her hair, she
[3:58] she absolutely denies her Nazerite bow
[4:02] that she is a bride to Christ. Because
[4:06] there that one thing, she spoils the
[4:08] whole picture.
[4:12] correctly. A Nazerite is one that is
[4:15] consecrated for a purpose.
[4:18] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[4:20] &gt;&gt; Samson was consecrated to a age and to a
[4:23] purpose. Therefore, he had long hair.
[4:26] The woman that's a child of God lets her
[4:28] hair grow to show she's consecrated to
[4:31] every word of God.
[4:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. If she cuts it off, I don't care
[4:35] how much she dances, sings, send a
[4:38] choir, speaks in tongues, runs up and
[4:40] down, or has all kind of aid society,
[4:43] she's dead.
[4:46] &gt;&gt; That's thus saith the Lord.
[4:50] &gt;&gt; The word of God. 1 Corinthians 14.
[4:57] Amen.
[4:57] &gt;&gt; She has denied her NAZERITE VOW AND SOLD
[5:02] OUT TO THE GOD OF THIS MODERN AGE.
[5:06] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[5:07] &gt;&gt; She doesn't. Now, shame on you, lady or
[5:10] woman.
[5:12] &gt;&gt; Now, I have six videos about hair
[5:14] length. If you like to watch those, I'll
[5:15] put links to those in the description.
[5:17] Two on long hair and the Bible. One on
[5:20] braided or braided hair. Another on hair
[5:23] tinting or hair coloring. A fifth one on
[5:27] women are spiritually dead if they cut
[5:30] their hair according to 1 Corinthians 11
[5:32] and other verses on the video where a
[5:35] woman cannot be born again if she shames
[5:37] her head because that shames Christ and
[5:40] God. And then lastly, can a man divorce
[5:42] his wife if she cuts her hair? So if
[5:45] you're interested in this topic, please
[5:47] watch those videos by God's grace and
[5:49] share them if you feel led by the Holy
[5:50] Ghost. So Samson was under a lifelong
[5:53] full headship under Jehovah. Those men
[5:56] that were not under the lifelong
[5:58] Nazarite vow for hair would cut their
[6:01] hair at the end of the vow as we see
[6:02] Paul did in the book of Acts. So in the
[6:05] Old Testament when people would see
[6:06] Samson with long uncut hair, they knew
[6:08] he was a Nazarite. He was set apart for
[6:10] the service of the Lord. It was not a
[6:12] shame for him to have that because they
[6:14] knew God has a purpose for his life. He
[6:17] needs to obey God in everything. But if
[6:20] any man would just grow his hair long in
[6:22] the Old Testament, that would have been
[6:23] a shame as well. We can see clearly it
[6:26] was a shame for Abselon to have that
[6:28] long flowing locks of hair because it's
[6:30] what caused him to get his hair caught
[6:33] in the tree and then that led to his
[6:35] death as well. So we can see how it's so
[6:36] important for a man to cut his hair
[6:38] today. And the Old Testament, it was
[6:40] important as well. Unless you were under
[6:42] a Nazerite vow.
[6:44] &gt;&gt; Long hair is a a Nazerite vow. It showed
[6:46] that you've cut yourself from the world
[6:47] to obey the word.
[6:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Samson let his hair grow out for a
[6:52] Nazerite bow. Now we realizing these
[6:54] things and women dressing and acting AND
[6:56] DOING MAN PERMITTING HIM TO DO IT.
[7:00] &gt;&gt; Big bunch of sissies. It seems like
[7:01] there's not even man anymore. You see
[7:03] men wearing pink shoes AND AND PREACHERS
[7:06] ON THE PULPIT SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
[7:07] THAT'S A DISGRACE.
[7:09] &gt;&gt; I LIKE TO SEE MAN AGAIN. THAT'S
[7:11] ABSOLUTELY MAN. LOOK LIKE THERE'S A
[7:14] POWER THAT DRIVES THEM TO DO IT. IT'S A
[7:16] DEVIL IN the pressure of this name.
[7:18] &gt;&gt; Right.
[7:19] &gt;&gt; Now, let's go a little further and look
[7:21] at more revelations on Samson typing
[7:23] Christ. This is what I emailed the
[7:25] brother as well. And then I went and did
[7:27] some other research on it. So, we can
[7:29] see some of these types here by God's
[7:31] grace. In Judges 13 and 14, Samson has
[7:34] this experience with this deceased lion.
[7:37] And then honey is found in the lion. And
[7:39] he tells us in Judges 14, this is a
[7:42] riddle of out of the eater comes
[7:44] sweetness. And so this is a beautiful
[7:46] type of Christ. Christ is the lion of
[7:48] the tribe of Judah. And in his death, we
[7:51] find honey. In his death, we find
[7:54] sweetness. In his death, we find healing
[7:57] and strength because he was wounded for
[7:59] our transgressions. He was bruised for
[8:01] our iniquities. The chastisement of our
[8:03] peace was upon him. And with his
[8:05] stripes, we were healed. The Bible says
[8:07] we already were healed. So it's a
[8:10] beautiful type of Jesus Christ dying for
[8:12] our sins and through his death we gain
[8:15] healing. We gain everything we need for
[8:17] this earthly journey through the death
[8:20] of the lion of the tribe of Judah.
[8:22] Second, we also see in Judges 14 that
[8:24] Samson wanted a gentile wife and then
[8:27] had a feast that lasted seven days. This
[8:29] is a beautiful type of the seven gentile
[8:31] church ages from Revelations chapters 1,
[8:34] 2, and 3. as brother N wrote the
[8:36] exposition of the seven church ages and
[8:38] then the mystery of the riddle was
[8:40] fulfilled on the seventh day which I
[8:41] believe is a type of revelation 10:7
[8:44] brother's ministry because the mystery
[8:46] of God was finished by the seventh angel
[8:49] and someone recently criticized me
[8:50] saying brother Ram didn't finish the
[8:52] mysteries of God well you're too late to
[8:53] tell me that by God's grace I wrote a
[8:56] book about 12 New Testament mysteries
[8:57] brother Brandham finished six of them
[8:59] are with thus sayith the Lord so we can
[9:02] clearly see how brother Brandham
[9:03] finished the mystery of God All the
[9:04] Bible defined mysteries, Brother Ram
[9:06] taught us the true revelation on them.
[9:09] And as I just read this morning, never
[9:11] forget the keystone of the Bible that
[9:13] God is unchanging and so are his ways.
[9:15] That relates to the seven church ages,
[9:17] the seven church age messengers and the
[9:19] bride of Jesus Christ down through the
[9:21] seven church ages. We must always try to
[9:24] be like the book of Acts church. Strive
[9:26] to be like the book of Acts church. And
[9:27] thankfully, God said he'd restore the
[9:29] book of Acts. The fullness of Pentecost
[9:31] would be in the bride with us, sayith
[9:33] the Lord. as brother Ram said in the
[9:34] church age book in the last chapter of
[9:36] the resume of the ages and his verse was
[9:38] Joel 2:23-26.
[9:40] So please read that. You'll see God
[9:43] vindicate that in the years to come
[9:44] before the rapture. He's already
[9:46] vindicating it but he'll continue to do
[9:48] that because it's thus sayith the Lord.
[9:50] Let's look at a few more types here of
[9:51] Samson. He destroyed more in his death
[9:54] than in his life. And that's what Jesus
[9:56] did. that Jesus destroyed more spiritual
[9:59] wickedness, principalities
[10:01] through his death than he did in his
[10:03] life. The book of Colossians says this
[10:05] in chapter 2. The Bible said he spoiled
[10:08] principalities and powers. He made a
[10:10] show of them openly, triumphing over
[10:12] them in it. in Colossians 2:15
[10:15] and it connects to Calvary because verse
[10:17] 14 in Colossians 2 says he blotted out
[10:20] the handwriting of ordinances that was
[10:22] against us which was contrary to us and
[10:24] took it out of the way nailing it to his
[10:26] cross. Next, Samson was born to destroy
[10:29] the Philistines and Jesus was born to
[10:32] defeat Satan according to 1 John 3:8.
[10:36] For this purpose the son of God was
[10:38] manifested that he might destroy the
[10:39] works of the devil. That means destroy
[10:42] them in our lives. Of course, we know
[10:44] the devil's still working right now.
[10:45] Jesus did not destroy all the works of
[10:47] the devil yet, but he will. But he's
[10:50] destroying the works of Satan in the
[10:52] lives of the believers. As I believe the
[10:54] book of Romans says, Jesus will bruise
[10:57] Satan shortly under our feet by God's
[11:00] grace. Yes, it's Romans 16:20. By God's
[11:03] grace. So, let's look at a few more
[11:04] types here. Both had miraculous
[11:07] announcements before their birth.
[11:09] Speaking of Samson and Jesus, Samson's
[11:12] miraculous birth was announced in Judges
[11:14] 13:3. His mother was barren, but the
[11:17] angel said, "Thou shalt conceive and
[11:18] bear a son." In Luke 1:31,
[11:21] Mary was told, "Thou shalt conceive in
[11:23] thy womb, bring forth a son, and shall
[11:25] call his name Jesus." Next, both were
[11:28] born to be deliverers. Judges 13:5, "He
[11:31] shall begin to deliver Israel out of the
[11:33] hand of the Philistines." and Matthew
[11:35] 1:21, he shall save his people from
[11:37] their sins. And we know the word save is
[11:39] salvation. It means deliverance.
[11:42] Both were Nazerites. Although Samson was
[11:45] a physical Nazarite. Jesus was a
[11:47] spiritual Nazarite. We know Jesus drank
[11:49] a little wine, but the wine of his day
[11:51] is not the same as wine today. From what
[11:54] I've read, it's a lot less alcoholic
[11:56] content. And Jesus also said, "I
[11:58] sanctify myself for their sakes." In
[12:00] John 17:1 19, the main thing is that
[12:04] Jesus was a Nazerite against sin. He
[12:07] [clears throat] was a Nazerite from sin.
[12:09] Jesus never sinned. Hallelujah.
[12:13] Next, both were betrayed for silver. In
[12:15] Judges 16:5, Delilah
[12:19] sold out or betrayed Samson for,00
[12:21] pieces of silver and Jesus was betrayed
[12:24] for 30 pieces of silver according to
[12:26] Matthew 16:15.
[12:28] Both betrayed by someone close to them.
[12:30] betrayed for money and handed over to
[12:32] their enemies. Both were bound by their
[12:35] enemies. Samson was bound in Judges 15
[12:39] verse 13. And Jesus was bound and led
[12:41] away in Matthew 27:2.
[12:45] Both were mocked by their enemies.
[12:46] Samson was mocked in Judges 16:25.
[12:50] Call for Samson that he may make a
[12:53] sport. And in Matthew 27:29, they bowed
[12:56] the knee before him and mocked the Lord
[12:58] Jesus. They were publicly humiliated,
[13:00] treated as entertainment, and surrounded
[13:02] by enemies at their weakest point. Both
[13:05] had outstretched arms in their death. In
[13:07] Judges 16, 29 and 30, Samson took hold
[13:11] of the two middle pillars and bowed
[13:13] himself with all of his might. So, we
[13:15] see the outstretched arms of Samson. And
[13:17] of course, Jesus had his arm stretched
[13:19] out, nailed down to the cross. Samson
[13:22] stretched himself between two pillars.
[13:24] And Jesus was stretched out on a cross
[13:26] between two thieves. And again, Samson's
[13:29] greatest victory came through death. He
[13:32] slew more in his death than they which
[13:34] he slew in his life. Judges 16:30. And
[13:37] we went through Colossians 2:14 and 15.
[13:40] Jesus's greatest victory came through
[13:41] his death. Both achieved victory through
[13:44] their weakness. After Samson was
[13:47] blinded, bound, and mocked, then the
[13:50] victory came. And of course, as Jesus
[13:52] was smitten, beaten, bruised, bloodied,
[13:56] after that came the victory of the
[13:58] cross. Second Corinthians 13:4 says,
[14:00] "For though he was crucified through
[14:02] weakness, yet he liveth by the power of
[14:04] God." So it looked like total defeat and
[14:07] weakness became a total victory. Next,
[14:10] both died surrounded by their enemies.
[14:12] Samson died in the Philistine temple and
[14:14] Jesus died surrounded by Roman soldiers,
[14:17] Jewish leaders, and mockers. So the
[14:20] victory came in the middle of the camp
[14:22] of the enemy. Both were rejected by
[14:24] their own people. In Judges 15:11,
[14:28] the Israelites said, "Knowest thou not
[14:30] that the Philistines are rulers over us?
[14:32] What is this that thou hast done unto
[14:34] us?" And then John 1:11, he came unto
[14:37] his own, and his own received him not.
[14:40] God's deliverers were rejected by the
[14:42] very people they were sent to save. And
[14:45] lastly, both had a final cry right
[14:49] before their death. In Judges 16:28,
[14:52] Samson said, "Oh Lord God, remember me.
[14:54] I pray thee that I may be at once
[14:55] avenged of the Philistines." And Jesus
[14:58] on the cross in Luke 23:46 said,
[15:00] "Father, into thy hands I commend my
[15:02] spirit. Both died praying to God
[15:05] Almighty." How beautiful.
[15:08] Now remember friends, there's
[15:09] differences in types. Very rarely are
[15:11] there perfect types. So we have to be
[15:14] careful how we use typology because we
[15:16] see some clear differences between
[15:18] Samson and the Lord Jesus. Samson was a
[15:20] sinful man. Jesus was a sinless man, a
[15:24] sinless God man. Samson wanted revenge.
[15:27] Jesus wanted redemption. Jesus prayed
[15:30] for forgiveness.
[15:32] Samson killed physical enemies. Jesus
[15:34] defeated spiritual enemies. Satan,
[15:37] death, hell, and the grave. And Samson
[15:40] died and stayed dead until Jesus died
[15:44] and then rose again and brought up many
[15:46] of the Old Testament saints with him.
[15:48] According to Matthew chapter 27, we
[15:50] believe Samson would have been
[15:51] resurrected as well because he was in
[15:52] the Hall of Fame of faith in Hebrews
[15:54] chapter 11.
[15:56] In closing, friends, I hope this video
[15:58] was a blessing by the grace of God.
[15:59] Excellent question there from the
[16:00] brother on the email. And then as I
[16:02] thought about it more and more, I wanted
[16:04] to find all these types of Christ and
[16:06] Samson. Beautiful picture there. May we
[16:08] be like Samson and cry, "Oh Lord," once
[16:10] more, Lord, give us the power again.
[16:12] Give us grace. Give us favor. Give us
[16:15] victory over our enemies. May that be
[16:17] our prayer today. My brother Cam
[16:18] preached that to us years ago in 2010,
[16:20] and we cried out to God, and God gave us
[16:23] many wonderful testimonies of his power.
[16:25] So, let's do that again by the grace of
[16:28] God. I'm sure all of us can relate to
[16:30] Samson at some point. Maybe at one time
[16:31] we had the power of God with us. We were
[16:34] operating under the power of God. So
[16:35] submissive to it. But then we made
[16:37] mistakes. But we can learn from Samson's
[16:39] life that we cry out just once more,
[16:41] Lord. Like Samson remembered. He had the
[16:44] hair grown back. He remembered the
[16:46] covenant. Let us remember the covenant
[16:48] God has made for us. God kept the
[16:51] covenant for us. He brought us into the
[16:53] covenant. It's the greatest covenant so
[16:54] far. The blood of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[16:57] Where God writes his word upon the
[16:59] fleshly tables of our hearts. where
[17:02] God's spirit causes us to keep the word
[17:04] of God. Brother Rand often prayed for
[17:06] revivals for his own life. Here's two
[17:08] quotes in particular. Why Christ speak?
[17:10] This is after the seals July 1463.
[17:14] He says, "What ought it to do to us? We
[17:16] need a repentance. We need a revival.
[17:18] I'm saying myself, see, I need a
[17:19] shaking. I need something. I said I was
[17:21] speaking to myself this morning or about
[17:23] myself. I I I need awakening up."
[17:27] So, brother Rams recognized even after
[17:29] the seals, he needed revival, a personal
[17:31] revival in his life. And then in images
[17:34] of Christ 1959, so four years before
[17:37] that, while the Brandham tabernacle is
[17:39] having a revival, I want one myself. I
[17:41] just don't want it to happen in the
[17:43] building. I want it to happen in me. I
[17:45] want a closer walk. So, if you feel that
[17:47] way today, cry out to God. God is
[17:49] faithful. God hears our requests. Let us
[17:52] wait upon the Lord. He'll renew our
[17:53] strength like the eagle. just once more.
[17:55] Lord,

[18:08] Very happy to be here this afternoon and
[18:10] again in defense of the gospel of Jesus
[18:12] Christ to bring the good tidings, the

[18:20] church. The same Jesus that was
[18:22] yesterday will be today and forever. He
[18:26] has never failed.
