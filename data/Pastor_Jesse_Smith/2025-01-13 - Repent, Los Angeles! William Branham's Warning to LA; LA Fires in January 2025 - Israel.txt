TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] repent Los Angeles repent to rest of you and turn to God the hour of his wrath is upon the Earth flee while there's time to flee and come into Christ greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to give my reaction to the Los Angeles wildfires which began on January 7th 2025 a brother named Derek had emailed me about this on January 9th he shared some pictures from space of Los Angeles [Music] burning and he shared a great quote from brother brandham that said Los Angeles the City of Angels which are exalted into heaven will be brought down into hell he wanted to know my thoughts on this quote and my humble thoughts are just that I think God is giving Los Angeles another warning of course before Los Angeles sinks in the ocean as prophesied by God's Prophet brother William brandham I remember this my last message in California where I thought I'd never go back again when I predicted Los Angeles will go beneath the ocean thus sayeth the Lord it will she's done she's washed she's finished what hour I don't know when but it will be sunk so I appreciate brother dereck's spiritual email I told him him I was glad the spirit of God had quickened that brother random quote to his remembrance there's about five or six quotes where brother randam speaks of Los Angeles being brought down to Hell just as Jesus spoke of capernium being brought down to Hell in Luke 10:15 I'll play one of them it's from the choosing of the Bride preached in Los Angeles April 29th 1965 brother randam pleads with Los Angeles to repent let's listen to the quote thou City who claims to be the city of the Angels who's exalted yourself into heaven and sent all the dirty filthy things of Fashions and things the even the foreign countries come here to pick up our filth and send it away You're your fine churches and Steeples and so forth the way you do remember one day you will be laying in the bottom of the sea you're a great honeycom under you right now the wrath of God is belching right beneath you how much longer you'll hold this sandb hanging out over that on that ocean out under a mile deep will slide in there pump back to the salt and Seed it'll be worse than the last day of pompe repent Los Angeles repent the rest of you and turn to God the hour of his wrath is upon the Earth flee while there's time to flee and come into Christ let us pray dear God my spirit is shaking my heart is dropping teardrops of warning gr old God that men and women will not think of what I've said as a joke and the church people will not think of it as something that was Prejudice or against them may they see lord it's in love so certainly brother random was inspired of the Holy Spirit to warn Los Angeles of a great earthquake that would sink Los Angeles and so the Los Angeles fires I do not think are part of the prophecy but I do think it's a warning from God God in his gracious heart giving the people of Los Angeles another warning about the Doom that is coming of course because of all the filth and trash and wickedness that has come out of Los Angeles brother Brandon was right to warn Los Angeles of oncoming judgment because so much Supernatural had been done by the Holy Ghost in Los Angeles to try to save Souls think of the 1906 isua Street Revival right there in Los Angeles but Los Angeles has turned it down for the wickedness of Hollywood then even in brother bram's Ministry brother Bram did many signs wonders and miracles there in Los Angeles it was God declaring his glory in Los Angeles and yet the city turned it down of course even brother Leroy and Paul cop from the 1953 20 Century Prophet noted all the signs of healings and miracles that were done in Los Angeles at Calvary Temple let's listen to the quote brother brandham in your two great campaigns at Los Angeles at Calvary Temple we noticed that the Lord Jesus Christ worked with you in a very special manner with these marvelous gifts these earning of the spirits of men's Hearts as well as the sicknesses of the body and the signs of healing and miracles that were wrought we thought it was wonderful we're interested brother brandham in hearing more about this unique Ministry that God has given you very well brother cop let's go back to the beginning next I want to play a portion of a video from Ray comfort's YouTube channel Living Waters I was listening to this video while I was driving to church yesterday and he played a series of news clips and in one of them a reporter says she was driving through Los Angeles and it was like driving through hell so again this relates to Jesus's prophecy about capernium brought down to Hell now we know the term brought down to Hell means the souls will be taken to Hades or shol or Hell the prison house for Souls that have rejected the Gospel of Jesus Christ but again I just thought it was a very fitting warning Los Angeles is in a current state where it's burning like hell and so it's God's grace it's God's warning for the people to repent and turn to the Lord Jesus Christ so here's that video clip from Living Waters with three shout outs God creator of the universe zero mentions marking God and using his name as a cuss word is nothing new for Hollywood but less than 48 hours after the golden globe's blasphemy Hollywood was on fire tonight a new fire breaking out late this evening in the Hollywood Hills who would have ever thought this Los Angeles is on fire I talked to a fireman once he was telling me he goes dude one day he goes it's just going to be the right Wind and Fire is going to start in the right place and it's going to burn through La all the way to the ocean and there's not a thing we can do about it the scene horrific this is new aerial video of a six fire the sunset Fire based in the Hollywood Hills firefighters there doing everything they can but there simply Aren't Enough of them to fight the horror that has exploded right now people are rushing to escape the Hollywood Hills brand new fire exploded down the Hollywood Hills making a beine for the iconic heart of the entertainment industry it is like driving through hell itself down here literally through hell tens of thousands of people have fled for their lives abandoning their cars when they could go no further a new fire erupting in the Hollywood Hills marching toward iconic landmarks more than 30,000 people were under evacuation orders across Southern California a new fire has broken out in the Hollywood Hills in Los Angeles threatening landmarks like the Dolby Theater where the Oscar ceremony is to be held in just a few weeks literally grabbed our phones to computer and our dogs and ran out the wind hits the wrong way it's just going to burn straight through LA and there's not going to be a thing we could do about it there's nothing they can do last I've been reading through Jeremiah and God gave Jeremiah numerous thus sayith the Lord warnings for Judah Jerusalem all of Israel and at least six times God had Jeremiah say thus sayith the Lord I've sent you prophets turn from your ways and yet the people would not turn from your ways so again I see a parallel between Jeremiah's ministry as a prophet to call Israel to repentance and brother bram's ministry as a genuine prophet of God trying to call Los Angeles and of course the whole world but even the United States to repentance and yet they did not amend their ways one example is Jeremiah 44: 4-6 how be it I sent unto you all my servants the prophets Rising early and sending them saying Oh do not this abominable thing that I hate for Los Angeles stop putting out all these abominable movies and TV shows verse 5 but they hearkened not nor unin their ear to turn from their wickedness to burn no incense unto other gods wherefore my Fury and my anger was poured forth and was kindled in the cities of Judah and in the the streets of Jerusalem think about the streets of Los Angeles and they are wasted and desolate as at this day also Jeremiah 26:5 to hearken to the words of my servants the prophets whom I sent unto you both rising up early and sending them but you have not hearkened then will I make this house like Shiloh and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth surely Los Angeles has been a curse to all the nations of the earth as of yesterday January 12th 20 25 Reports say 38,000 Acres have been burned in Los Angeles which is the equivalent of about 59 square miles over 16 people have died and there's been at least 10,000 structures destroyed and almost a quarter million people have been displaced so yesterday in church we prayed for them all the people affected that they would repent of course be safe so that's what we'll end this video with as well father God we thank you for your grace and mercy Lord we see this as a warning to the people of Los Angeles Lord surely we know the city itself will not fully repent neither will this nation fully repent but God we just pray for the individuals Lord God that you're dealing with that they'll repent May Souls get saved because they see the reality of the judgments of God lord you know how to open Hearts just like you did Lydia's heart in Acts 16 so I pray you to Open Hearts soften hearts and may they receive the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ that they might be saved thank you God for sending us a prophet that warned this nation Lord God that warned Los Angeles with us sayith the Lord we trust in you Lord God we are believing your prophets we're believing your word because your word cannot fail so father be merciful to all those impacted Lord God keep them safe physically bless the First Responders Lord God anoint them Lord God the firefighters have mercy upon this city we pray we know you have for so many years since the prophecy brother Ram gave almost 60 years so we ask for your continued long-suffering and mercy in Jesus Jesus Christ's name amen if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact [Music] me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
