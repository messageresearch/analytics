TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I Know Thy works and the last to be more than the first this is certainly remarkable as the darkness of the age increased as the honor role of the martyrs grew lengthier day by day they worked all the harder they served all the more and their faith increased how tragic it was that in the Ephesian age love waned and truly nothing is said of the increased labor of love in the other ages but in this age and the darkest of all ages they served him even more what a lesson that is there is no ceasing of this gracious service of Love unto the Lord but rather an increasing of it that is the secret let the enemy attempt to thwart our service to the Lord our reply is increased service when the faint are crying in fear that is the time to shout the Victory and um now if we could just stop thise let me get let so you be sure to see this that that's kind of might be a little little puzzling to you but let's get that over here watch and see if it isn't a a a laboring church you see and to the angel of the Church of thara write these things sayth the Son of God who his eyes are like the flames of fire and his feet are like fine brass I Know Thy Works see becoming all works now see because that's the the one was riding with and uh charity and service see it's all just and faith and patience and thy works again twice thy works and the last to be more than the first see that shows that the thyra age after the Antichrist got settled down and come into the th age the little church could do nothing but just just simply labor and another thing the ox is a also is a beast of sacrifice see they give their lives just as freely as they could give them in the Dark Ages a thousand years there the Catholicism controlled the world and they just went right in yes or no they didn't mind Dy if it was death that's all right amen it wouldn't died anyhow amen why the very Spirit of the age let me tell you about a man one time before closing there was a man named David and when the Ark of God had been down in the Philistine land and had come across pull by Ark old oxes are pulling them when David saw that Ark coming he had a little gown on him he run out there and kicked his feet in the air and jumped around and screamed and jumped and danced and jumped and danced and him the king of Israel and his wife looked out of a window and saw him acting so strange she despised him why she must have said the idiot look at him out there the way he's acting throwing his feet up in the air and jumping around and acting like that why he must be crazy and that night one come in she said in words like this why you embarrass me why you the king my husband out there doing like that acting like that David said tomorrow I'll do better than that yes sir he said don't you know I was dancing unto the Lord he crossed over he was in the land of the promise he' lost all self Styles and buck of the world he was so happy to know that the ark was coming into his own City oh I tell you some people's afraid to receive the Holy Ghost afraid that they might speak with tongues they're afraid that somebody would say now he's one of them tongues guys they're afraid to come to the church to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ because they're ashamed of it oh somebody said i' have to recall my tapes because I preached to been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ I ain't recalling him I'm making more amen that's right making more that is the Bible if they don't like what we did yesterday just watch what we're going to do tomorrow that's the thing to do just keep on going there's no end to it because it is of the lord it's God you know what God did God looked down out of the heaven and said David you're a man after my own heart amen David wasn't ashamed he was a servant of the Lord he loved the Lord and he was so happy so Overjoyed though he didn't think about human prge and we're happy to have all of you with us through the day and the times when we when if you're around here in the city anywhere near come out we want to assemble and gather our ourselves together we want to sit under the teaching of our brother here brother naville and um and partake of the things that's of God as he finds them from God he gives them out and we want to learn of God and seeing the day approaching we must assemble ourselves more of together we must love in our hearts to come to church if we don't love church love God coming together what we call called church is coming together to worship if we love Christ we worship could you imagine a man saying he loved his wife and he hadn't seen her for a long time passed right by and say well I'll see her some other time see that isn't wife saying she loves her husband or a parent saying they love their child well it it shows see and I think our Expressions that we should constantly long to be in worship anywhere to Worship the Lord when we come together to worship Him worship him at home worship him while we're driving our cars wherever we are Worship the Lord just pray the Bible said let everything that has breath praise the Lord and then he said praise ye the Lord even if you haven't got any breath still praise the Lord see pra every he has breath praise the Lord and then praise you the Lord I think Psalms 100 100 psalm
