TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] hereafter [Applause] [Laughter] [Applause] [Music] greetings friends in the mattress name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to answer a couple viewers questions they asked do I set up a Christmas tree or not So my answer was no there's four reasons why I don't but I also don't think setting up a Christmas tree is a sin of itself I'm trying on purpose to make this a short video as I'm anxious to get to the second seal and the rest of the seal videos in the series about proving brother Branham did not plagiarize the Seven Seals so if you have more questions about this topic of Christmas and Christmas trees you can definitely make those requests to me Christmas is a subject that has lots of quotes from Brother Branham and so a lot more videos could be done on it if the Lord was willing additionally I preached a sermon in 2018 called how we worship at Christmas time and you can watch it on our Church's YouTube channel bride of Christ Fellowship Akron it's from October 24 2018. and it's a more extensive look at the subject of Christmas so for this video I'm not going to cover the history of Christmas at all because I think there's a more simple answer for believers today and that answer of course is in the word of God and frankly some of the history I read about Christmas and Christmas celebrations doesn't seem to have a lot of evidence that it's accurate and so if there's any question about a subject I like to then focus more on the word of God and how we can find answers to that question about that subject in the Holy Bible the word of God which is the written absolute and of course Jesus Christ himself is the person of the absolute so here's the outline for this video first we'll look at why Christmas is a Christian Liberty second we'll look at a few of brother branham's Christmas traditions and lastly we'll look at the four reasons I do not personally set up a Christmas tree first why Christmas is a Christian Liberty as we know if there's a Bible question there must be a Bible answer so over the course of 18 years of being a minister I found Colossians 2 verses 16 and 17 to be the most important scripture related to holiday traditions and customs it reads let no man therefore judge you and meat or and drink or in respect of an holy day or of the new moon or of the Sabbath days which are a shadow of things to come but the body is Christ so of course this statement by Paul respect of an holy day I believe this is the terminology we should use for Christmas Thanksgiving Easter or Resurrection Sunday and all other holidays because of course these are all holidays where those of us here in America get days off from work so in April of 1963 brother random called Good Friday and Easter a series of holidays or holy days that the world sets aside to celebrate in commemoration great scriptural events that's happened in the times past we're now in this being what we call Good Friday or God's Good Friday I don't know why we call it that Good Friday but we're just in the beginning on another series of of holidays holy days at the world set aside the Christian world to to celebrate and commemoration great spiritual events that happen in the times past great things have taken place and we use them and make a time of celebration for those things which has happened if uh God if if God were here at this uh Christian world at this time and what's called the Christian we're all wonder what his attitude would be towards our manner of Celebration that we have a memorial of these great days and times that that has been so the Bible and brother Branham never say it's wrong to have special set-aside days or holy days that we use to commemorate past events but of course there are genuine questions how should we celebrate or how should we commemorate and of course the answer is we should Worship the Lord Jesus Christ and of course love others because loving others is the Fulfillment of the whole law it's also important to know that brother random called Christmas time a sacred time just like Good Friday just like Resurrection Day brother Ram said this and God's Gift always find a place 1963. it's still the sacredness of remembering that God gave us the hope that we have in US different than me see today when we are even if it's if it's [Applause] a job remembering that God gave us the hope that we have in his hands up his own Santa Claus thing going on like this might as well don't know sir girl this is my Pagan celebration to us and this is [Applause] no love there's been no peace that been old Hereafter and for the uh a Believer if there have been no Christmas and then why little Bethlehem 1963 brother random said whatever day it might be we still doesn't take away the sacredness of what it's supposed to be from the 28th uh first to the 25th of December the sun's setting right almost harder changes at all and then that was the sun God's birthday so they changed it to the Son of God but remember work every what day it might be beat we still still going to be so from these quotes from Brother Branham and Colossians 2 verse 16 we can clearly see that Christians are allowed to celebrate holidays or holy days and clearly Paul sets these holy days aside as Christian liberties and Christian Liberty is something that a Christian can do and in some aspects the Christian is neither better nor worse from doing it this is what Paul said in First Corinthians 8 verse 8 and 9. he said but me commendeth us not to God for neither if we eat are we the better neither if we eat not are we the worse but take heed less by any means this Liberty of yours become a stumbling block to them that are weak so here Paul defends Christians liberties and in each Liberty that we have we need to make sure we're not causing anybody to stumble and so in my personal life as my 2018 sermon showed I do not believe I'm causing anybody to stumble when I give each of my eight children three small gifts a book a toy and clothing and when my wife and I give them these gifts we do extra Bible reading on Christmas morning we sing extra worship songs and we tell them that we're giving these gifts as a memorial of the great gift God gave to us his son Jesus Christ just as brother Branham modeled for us I think the church has gone a little present here for the little kitties that you while I was just looking the door back there oh you want to stay at your Sunday School years I think they got some presents back there for the little fellas to give out this morning and um when I you little folks remember while we're doing this I want to make this clear it's not Santa Claus thread that someday you'll learn it's nothing to it but it's from Jesus Christ the truth of all truth is a Son of God and we're giving you this little present this morning because it's letting you know that one time God gave the greatest present could ever be give to the human rights and um we have a poor way expressed and there's nothing we can give to compare with that but just as morals one to another we do that and also Romans 14 verses 15 16 and 20 show how we must not destroy others with our liberties and again I don't see how my worship at Christmas time causes anybody to be destroyed I've never seen my family's Christmas traditions destroy anyone's faith for example we don't go into debt to buy our small Christmas gifts we always stay within our means we stay within our budget and none of the gifts glorify the world or glorify Satan or lead any of our children into sin and then in Romans 14 16 Paul said let not then your good be evil spoken of so that's why I preached that sermon in 2018 I didn't want my good and holy commemorations on Christmas to be evil spoken of because I do not believe there's anything wrong with them and then in Romans 14 20 it said all things are indeed pure and of course Paul is talking about Christian Liberties there's nothing wrong with giving someone a present as an expression of your love for them and also as an expression of God's great love for us I think it's important to look at the life of Saint Paul who is the author about Christian Liberties and notice how he took his Christian liberties and a few of them are recorded in Acts chapter 18. Paul kept an Old Testament vow in Acts 18 verse 18. and was going to shave his head at the completion of The Vow now there's nothing in the New Testament that requires men to shave their heads so Paul was clearly using his Christian Liberty to keep an Old Testament vow during a time that the New Testament has already been established and he's helping establish it and then in Acts 18 verse 21 Paul wanted to by all means keep the feast in Jerusalem so the same man Paul that said Christ is our Passover wanted to keep another feast in Jerusalem a literal actual Jewish feast and Paul knew he had that Christian Liberty to do so so all these scriptures and quotes from Brother Branham help us to understand that any holiday celebration or commemoration or tradition is a Christian Liberty and yes we must guard them to make sure they don't become sinful of course and that's why the Holy Ghost was given to us so he would guide us into all truth convict us of sin and keep us walking on the straight and narrow path brother branham's Christmas traditions friends I personally believe brother Branham found the right balance in his worship at Christmas time I believe the Holy Ghost would have convicted brother Branham of his Traditions if he was off balance or too carnal but I don't hear that on brother random sermons I'm not going to play all these quotes I'm just going to reference them but brother Branham of course gave presents to his wife and his children and his wife gave him presents for example a new Bible brother random gave brother Neville a coat that brother Neville needed and of course brother Graham told his congregation he couldn't give everyone a gift because he didn't have the money to do it but he appreciated all the Christmas gifts that the congregation gave him less than three weeks before brother Brandon passed away he was still thanking people for Christmas gifts as he thanked the lady for Christmas candy in the message leadership from December 7th 1965 out in California [Music] if you if you give the one it shows respect like that you just can't do it a minister just can't do that and I understand that brother Neville this morning is presented with a new top coat amen so grateful to you all for my brother there's a little secret to that that Billy Paul and I know so I said arm is going down and getting one so then um I get from the church so at that time Billy come running up with a great big uh influential a word and smile on his face Daddy the church well I know the church could probably get him a little better one so I thought that's just wonderful so we could all that we know that he come in A Real Fine Place in brother Neville eating that cold and uh I want to thank that lady I can't thank him her name Billy just told me to give me bucks a Christmas candy just brought a few moments ago this because I can't think of her name she's from here in California as my first Christmas present well I thank you for it now another thing I would like to say as brother Neville has sold well said that we wished you the best in the visual Tidings and this time of a fellowship around these holy days and so forth and then I want to take this time to express the each and every one of you how grateful I am to you for your Christmas cards and gifts and things that was received at our house amen I certainly thank you with all my heart and I receive some mighty fine Christmas presents a movie camera and many other things guns and things that people love me to give you and I appreciate that regarding the Christmas tree brother Ram said a lot of harsh things against Christmas trees and that makes sense because the majority of people who set up Christmas trees are sinners Jesus said few there be that find the narrow road so it's obvious most Sinners who set up Christmas trees set it up as an idol they don't set it up in honor of the Lord Jesus Christ they set it up as an idol to commercialism and perhaps greed or Pride they're so prideful that they have so much money to buy such amazing gifts such expensive gifts I think it's important to see how in 1953 brother random said Christmas trees were Pagan but yet seven years later he said he set up a Christmas tree for his little son Joseph he said quote I got a little boy small enough yet to kind of want a Christmas tree and we had it in the room end quote [Music] and then I want to take this time to express the each and every one of you how grateful I am to you for your Christmas cards and gifts and things that was received at our house amen I certainly thank you with all my heart it certainly did US good this morning when I got a little boy small enough yet the Connie wanted a Christmas tree and we had it in the room and this morning going to there I found several gifts from my church here and my friends from around different places that had come in laying under the tree and I don't have words to express to you what I how I appreciate every one of them and may the god of Heaven bless you richly is my prayer and then he talked about how he found several Christmas gifts from the congregation under the tree on Christmas morning and he thanked the congregation for those gifts brother Adam said quote I don't have words to express to you what I how I appreciate every one of them and may the god of Heaven bless you richly is my prayer end quote so brother Ram didn't have words to express that means he was very thankful the gifts made him feel the love of Jesus Christ from the congregation because he didn't even have words to express how much it meant to him so again I know a lot more could be said about this subject of brother Branham and his Christmas traditions but I just want to share a few of those quotes with you in order to show you why I think brother Branham had the right balance regarding Christmas four reasons I do not set up a Christmas tree so recently a brother emailed me and asked me why I did not set up a Christmas tree and I and after meditating on it for a few minutes I said there's probably four reasons I don't set one up even though brother Branham did that was his Christian Liberty to do that the first reason I said was Jeremiah chapter 10 verses 1 through 4 I'll read verses two three and four thus saith the Lord learn not the way of the Heathen and be not dismayed at the signs of Heaven for the Heathen are dismayed at them for the customs of the people are Vain One cutteth a tree out of the forest the work of the hands of the workmen with the ax they deck it with silver and with gold they fasten it with nails and with hammers that it move not of course there's a lot of different opinions about this passage of scripture but when I read this I can't help but see the connection between today's worship of Mammon or money the worship of commercialism and its similarity to Jeremiah 10 verses 1 through 4. the scripture is clearly tree worship and for my conscience personally I can only have peace with God if I do not decorate a tree and of course that's just my own conscience and again that's my Christian Liberty I think we all can see how Sinners worship the tree and the presence underneath most Sinners on Christmas morning have no real Thanksgiving to the Lord Jesus Christ and aren't giving presence to show the love of Jesus Christ and the worst part is they'll neglect Jesus all together on Christmas he's the reason for the holiday but they'll neglect him in every activity and if Christmas falls on a Sunday like it does this year they will not go to church and Worship the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ so this first reason boils down to a pure conscience the majority of people today are sinners who are lost and they cut down trees or they buy a plastic tree and they decorate it and they basically worship at the idol of greed the idol of Mammon the idol of selfishness the idol of commercialism and so for me I can only have a pure conscience by not having a Christmas tree second a preacher came to our church years ago and preached a sermon and showed how cut down trees in the Bible were cursed trees it was a wonderful sermon it blew my mind I never seen that thought throughout the scriptures and so this reason is again related to my conscience I can only have peace at Christmas time without a Christmas tree if cut down trees represented a curse in the Bible then I don't want to cut down tree in my house on the other side I know that Jesus was made a curse for us according to Galatians 3 verse 13. but that of course is not the focus in people's minds when they set up a Christmas tree today they're not setting up the tree saying oh thank God Jesus was cursed for me so I don't have to be cursed most of them are just setting up because it's pretty it's a place to put all their gifts now with that thought in mind I think it'd be wonderful if those who did set up a tree thought about the truth of Galatians 3 verse 13 while they set it up maybe they would play that audio Bible chapter while they set up the Christmas tree and and just Worship the Lord Jesus during that time of setting it up and say thank you Lord you sent your son he was cut down and made a curse for me he was raised up on the cross he hung Between Heaven and Earth in order to be cursed for me he became a curse that I might be made his righteousness by faith I think if families did that or individuals did that it would be a great blessing to them but for me and my conscience according to these first two reasons I personally can't set up a Christmas tree in my house the third reason is that during my childhood we were very poor we were on food stamps most of my life and Christmas was a very disappointing time due to our poverty and our low finances my mother and siblings and I decorated a tree every year but it was usually in vain because of our poverty and so I have a lot of sad memories from my childhood related to Christmas and Christmas trees and I have bad memories of setting up a Christmas tree and then being disappointed as a child So based upon those past memories I want to refrain from setting up a tree in my house and this is a real thing because brother random said Christmas can be a curse to the poor children he said that in Falling part of the world he said quote but it's got to a place where it it's it's a curse to Little Children some little neighbor down the street can have plenty and the other little fellow don't have nothing and they look and it's it's just the whole thing is all together wrong end quote buying Christmas present months ago and what is it but a heathen trait there's nothing about it Godly all they're trying to say give gifts to the wise man that's just a always for a devil's excuse if you want to give something that's your life to Christ don't give to one another give it to him that's what he died for that's his purpose of coming right but it's got to be a place where it's it's a cursed of little children some little neighbor down the street can have plenty and the other little thought don't have nothing and it looks it's just the whole thing is all together wrong that's all so this third reason is impacted by my memory you know the human Spirit has five inlets conscious memory reason affection imagination the first two reasons I don't set up a tree relate to my conscience this third reason relates to my memory I have bad memories about Christmas from my childhood and setting up trees and so I take my Christian Liberty and I just refrain to set up a Christmas tree because of the memories from my childhood fourth and finally I personally see no connection between a glamorized tree and the humble birth of our Savior Jesus Christ in a Manger in an animal stable of course Christmas is a holiday about the birth of the Lord Jesus Christ and not the resurrection it seems like a glamorized decorated tree symbolizes Jesus's resurrection it certainly doesn't resemble his Earthly life or his Nativity and of course you know we could not have Jesus resurrection without the birth so I'm equally thankful for Jesus's birth life death and Resurrection so our family sets up a small manger scene every year and sometimes we put the gifts by the manger scenes sometimes we don't most recently we're just putting them down in our basement we're not putting the gifts by the manger scene anymore but if I'm going to celebrate a holiday about the birth of the Lord Jesus Christ I want to think about the humility in which Jesus came the humility in which God sent his dear son into the world the only begotten son of God so decorating a tree making it look bright and shiny and lavish to me that doesn't relate to the humble birth of our Lord Jesus Christ so that's the fourth reason that I choose not to set up a Christmas tree at my house in closing friends I hope this video has been a blessing I just wanted to share this answer to the couple questions I've gotten about Christmas time and Christmas trees if you'd like further videos about this subject please reach out to me let me know this year among all the years I've been on YouTube has been the year where I've answered some of the most difficult maybe controversial questions and so I'm thankful for the Lord Jesus Christ for guiding us into all truth helping us to rightly divide the word of Truth as the scripture says we're to prove all things we're to be labors in the word of God and so I want to wish you a merry Christmas as brother Brandon wished his congregation a Merry Christmas and please make this a sacred time of the year I think it's especially important this year Christmas is on a Sunday so I look forward to coming to the house of God on Sunday not skipping Church coming to church worshiping our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ worshiping him for his birth his life his death his resurrection and now his Ascension and his sending of the Holy Ghost to Believers today please make it a sacred time we're going to have an extra church service also to commemorate Jesus's birth with extra singing testimonies extra preaching and of course give little gifts out to the children in memory of the greatest gift that God sent to mankind his son the Lord Jesus Christ so I want to say in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ We wish you a Merry Christmas and may God bless you in the upcoming new year 2023. if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
