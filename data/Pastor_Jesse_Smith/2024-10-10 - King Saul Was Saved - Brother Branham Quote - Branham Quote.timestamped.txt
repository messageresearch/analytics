[0:00] and the group that call themselves
[0:03] fundamentalists are these two groups
[0:06] saved now I don't know I wouldn't know
[0:09] how to answer that now are these groups
[0:11] saved I don't know explain the
[0:13] difference between the spirit that's a
[0:15] different question now now are these two
[0:17] groups saved let me make that just a
[0:20] little bit more sensible to you and say
[0:22] I don't know I wouldn't know now
[0:25] remember here's my thoughts it may be
[0:27] wrong my thoughts is that if a Roman
[0:31] Catholic or whoever he might be
[0:34] Methodist Presbyterian Church of Christ
[0:37] Lutheran wherever he is if he believes
[0:40] on the Lord Jesus Christ and solemnly
[0:42] trusting him for his salvation I believe
[0:46] he's saved but you see the Roman
[0:49] Catholic Church doesn't do that they
[0:51] believe that the church saves them see
[0:53] their their salvation is in the church
[0:55] like this priest was put off the air
[0:57] here sometime ago for saying there's no
[0:58] other salvation only in the the church
[1:00] see the Roman church now that's wrong
[1:03] salvation is by Jesus Christ that's
[1:05] right not by the church but by Christ
[1:08] now if these Apostolic or apostolics and
[1:12] fundamentalists now call themselves I
[1:16] like a fundamentalist come to me sure
[1:17] some time ago and he said to me he said
[1:20] uh you kind of lean calvinistic don't
[1:22] you I said where's long as Calvin's in
[1:24] the Bible I'm with him as I go the Bible
[1:26] and Calvin stays in the Bible but he
[1:28] gets off the Bible and I just Bel only
[1:30] it could be the Bible he said well he
[1:32] said I want to say something to you you
[1:34] told I've heard you say that if a man
[1:37] was once
[1:39] saved that he could never be lost I said
[1:43] that's exactly what the scripture says
[1:45] has eternal
[1:46] life and shall never come into
[1:49] condemnation or judgment but already
[1:51] passed from Death to life I said I
[1:53] wasn't me said that that was Jesus
[1:55] Christ said that he said I want to ask
[1:57] you something that said do you believe
[2:00] that Saul was
[2:02] saved I said the Saul the U the King
[2:06] Saul he said yes well I said sure he
[2:09] said now remember he was a prophet I
[2:11] said correctly the Bible said he
[2:13] prophesied with the prophets he had a
[2:15] gift the prophecy he wasn't a prophet
[2:16] but he would had a gift of Prophecy
[2:18] because he's down there with the
[2:19] prophets when they were prophesying but
[2:22] um we know that Samuel was prophet in
[2:24] that day so but Saul was prophesying
[2:27] with the prophets he said then if he was
[2:28] a prophet then he was saved I said
[2:31] absolutely he said then I want to ask
[2:33] you something that I want to ask you
[2:35] something said and then you say Saul was
[2:37] saved and he the Bible said that the
[2:39] Lord departed from him and he become an
[2:42] enemy to God and he committed
[2:46] suicide and then saying he was saved I
[2:49] said and you're a
[2:51] fundamentalist I said brother you're
[2:53] just not reading it right that's all
[2:55] you're not reading what the scripture
[2:56] say he said well Saul could not be saved
[3:00] if he become an enemy of God I said Saul
[3:02] was
[3:03] saved oh he said I said he was a prophet
[3:05] he had to be saved see God saved him and
[3:08] God's not an Indian giver as we call it
[3:10] he don't well if God give you the Holy
[3:12] Ghost KN and he's going to lose you
[3:13] right down here what what a foolish
[3:15] thing it would be for him to give you
[3:16] the holy ghost in the first
[3:18] place you might impersonate the Holy
[3:20] Ghost and act like you got the Holy
[3:22] Ghost but if you've got the Holy Ghost
[3:23] God knows your beginning from the
[3:26] end that's right that's loose way to run
[3:30] business God don't run his life he he's
[3:32] infinite he know the end from the
[3:33] beginning and know every thing it ever
[3:35] be here every fly every night what ever
[3:38] be on the earth he knowed all about it
[3:39] before the world ever began so see what
[3:42] would he run his business like that far
[3:44] he doesn't do that if you want if you've
[3:46] really got the Holy Ghost you're saved
[3:48] eternally I can prove that through the
[3:50] scriptures and we have time after time
[3:52] but to conserve the time to get these
[3:54] questions I might say this you see that
[3:58] this fellow said well then what would
[3:59] you say say about Saul I said sure Saul
[4:01] was saved I said remember Saul backslid
[4:05] I'll admit that he backslid and went
[4:07] away from God because he was greedy he
[4:10] liked money he brought up all them
[4:13] sacrifices and things when Samuel
[4:15] through the word of God told him to
[4:16] destroy everything but he even saved the
[4:19] king and he saved a lot of stuff and
[4:21] brought up because see instead of
[4:22] following the word of God just exactly
[4:25] like it says you put your own opinion in
[4:27] it that's where you back slide that's
[4:30] what I think about denominations and
[4:32] things they backslide because they don't
[4:34] follow the word and you show them the
[4:36] word they turn their back from and say
[4:37] well our church teaches this that's not
[4:40] right it's What God
[4:41] Says and Samuel was commissioned to go
[4:44] down there and or Saul was and Destroy
[4:47] Everything utterly everything destroy it
[4:50] all instead of doing that he saved some
[4:52] for sacrifice and he spared the King's
[4:54] life and he done everything and Samuel
[4:56] walked out to him and told him the
[4:58] spirit of God had departed from him and
[5:00] and all like that and Samuel died and
[5:03] about 2 years later well then Saul had
[5:07] got the spirit of God departed from him
[5:09] but he wasn't lost amen sure he wasn't
[5:12] the anointing went off of him now watch
[5:15] and see if it was now Saul got so far
[5:17] away from God to when he went to the
[5:18] battle he started to go to battle and he
[5:20] was worried about going to battle and he
[5:23] he asked the Lord for a dream the Lord
[5:25] wouldn't give him a dream there was no
[5:27] prophets in the land in that day no
[5:29] prophets Samuel was a prophet they had
[5:31] prophesizes but so forth but they he
[5:33] couldn't get an answer from God no he he
[5:35] went down to the urum Thunder and asked
[5:37] there and the Flash of the Lightnings
[5:39] upon the urum Thunder wasn't even
[5:41] answering and what did he do he crawled
[5:44] off into a cave where there was a witch
[5:46] a fortune
[5:47] teller and this witch he disguised
[5:50] himself like a footman and went down
[5:51] there and he said would you divine unto
[5:53] me the spirit of Samuel the prophet and
[5:56] she said um she said well now you know
[5:59] what Saul it said she was talking to
[6:00] Saul but she didn't know it said Saul
[6:02] said all got familiar spirits he must be
[6:05] killed he said I'll protect you from
[6:07] Saul but Divine unto me the spirit of
[6:10] Samuel so the witch went into her
[6:12] enchantments and first thing you know
[6:14] when she seen Samuel raise up the spirit
[6:16] of him coming materializing in front of
[6:18] him she said I see Gods rise from the
[6:20] earth that's one of the consolations
[6:23] look at Old Samuel standing there he'
[6:25] been dead two years but there he stood
[6:29] am not only he stand there with his
[6:31] Prophet robe on Not only was he still
[6:34] alive but he was still a prophet amen
[6:37] hallelujah she said you've deceived me
[6:40] to the pro and Saul said
[6:43] Samuel I don't know what to do I'm going
[6:45] to battle tomorrow and the spirit's gone
[6:48] from me and said I can't even get a
[6:50] Dream from the Lord and the you're
[6:52] Thunder won't speak to me I'm in a
[6:53] terrible shape he said seeing you become
[6:56] an enemy of God said why have you called
[6:58] me out of my rest
[7:00] see Samuel said that so why did you call
[7:03] me from my rest seeing that you become
[7:05] an enemy to God and then he went ahead
[7:07] and told him he said but however he had
[7:10] tell him the word of the Lord and when
[7:11] he did I remember he had been dead two
[7:14] years see but he said I'll tell you the
[7:16] word he told him the word of the Lord
[7:18] said tomorrow you're going to fall in
[7:20] the
[7:21] battle Jonathan your son is going to
[7:23] fall with you and he said by this time
[7:26] tomorrow night you will be with me
[7:32] all right if he was lost so was Samuel
[7:35] the
[7:36] prophet that's fundamental is what soal
[7:39] see see he said you will be with me
[7:42] tomorrow night but this time Hallelujah
[7:45] see then if Saul was lost so was Samuel
[7:48] because it's both in the same
[7:50] place no no
[7:52] fundamentalist you fundamentalist
[7:55] socalled like Church of Christ socalled
[7:58] and Christian so-called Christianity
[8:01] so-called today because you're an
[8:03] American you're supposed to be a
[8:04] Christian because you're you're an
[8:06] American see that that's socalled
[8:09] Christianity but a real Christian is a
[8:11] born again man of the spirit Born Again
[8:14] woman of the spirit that's really these
[8:16] others are
[8:18] impersonating but real Christians are
[8:20] called of God
