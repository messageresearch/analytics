why do people drive like this to hear the word of god amen to worship jesus to give him the highest praise let's just praise him again praise god thank you jesus hallelujah praise god so let's take a few prayer requests jose just said remember him in prayer he's had a little bit of head pain as well and then he said he's had a couple of dreams that have come to pass i guess he's told me about him uh warning his family members so he just said give him he said just pray for him that god will give him grace uh god wants to give him more dreams you know so i said we'll pray for you brother also i did hear back from aaron garvin he just said thanks for praying for him so let's pray for him again tonight and pray about texts in him i'm going to pray about texting him by god's grace and before i forget i have your mason jars in my van oh god thank you and the landlord did email me back uh she's sending out the ac technician tomorrow the hvac guy i'm sorry i know i am sorry united i probably should have emailed earlier saying right that's my fault um but let's we'll just endure here for a little bit by god's grace i appreciate everybody's patience there does anybody have any new uh testimony or i'm sorry prayer requests or testimonies they'd like to share do you have any testimonies or anything okay praise the lord praise god okay let's bow our heads here for word of prayer let's ask the lord to be merciful i'll pray pray for the morning requests as well heavenly father lord we love you we bless you we magnify your name when i was reading that psalms [Music] yes there's been times [Music] [Music] for um [Music] holy spirit [Music] for this morning [Music] [Music] grace [Music] let's go to mark 13 please mark 13 32 i like to look at a few videos i've seen lately uh they're really uh unique uh and it's kind of on the same lines as 2015 when there was a lot of signs that looked like the end of the world was coming in 2015. and i found the the powerpoints i'm going to share some of those things it was it was extremely convincing but i want to look at uh take heed watch and pray it'll be my title the sub topic is is 2020 the year of the rapture so why you turn into matthew 13 let me turn there uh 30. can we read 32 and 32 please thanks buddy while you're turning there brother vang i forgot he put a testimony up here thanks for all the prayers we're back to five days working starting this week he said thank god amen so thank the lord amen our precious brothers and sisters you know sometimes they get overworked or not enough working but our god is faithful our god he gives us everything praise god amen i'm a witness of that thank the lord it's rich in mercy praise god so let's read uh 32 and 33. and then we'll get uh right to the word of god at the end of this message i'm going to try to keep it short i said try i'd like to have maybe five to ten minutes of just prayer about what i'm going to preach on just the the visions and dreams people are having because jesus said you watch and then you we do a lot of watching as far as i mean like sometimes our watching goes overboard i'll say like that right like what man says we all need to pray more so i just want to take you know a few minutes at the end of the service maybe five ten minutes and let's just pray that god will give us discernment for 2020. i believe he has this whole time but specifically there's a couple videos and uh dreams people had in denominations i'd like to share them with you i think they're well johnny and i johnny shared it with me the reason i'm going over is because it's the closest dream i've ever heard to the rapture and how brother branham taught it with the squeeze and everything it is absolutely the closest thing to the message so that's why i want to go over it it's very similar to that 2015. it's just really close there's some really inspiring things there so let's uh read this here together let's read this out loud ready one two three but of that day and that hour knoweth no man no not the angels which are in heaven neither the son but the father take ye heed watch and pray for ye know not when the time is now if jesus said you don't know the time then let's be convinced we don't know the time amen we don't know the day or the hour now you know the scripture first thessalonians 5 says we'll know the season and i think we can all feel as time goes on we're it's just common sense we're closer to the season you can see the birth pains getting more intense so let's have a word of prayer heavenly father we love you we've lifted up these requests before you we love to worship you we've we've given our our our priestly worship our sacrifices and lord what a blessing it is to sacrifice our hands raised our voices might get a little sore but it's a blessing to to shout and sing and praise your name to give these sacrifices of praise from our hearts no one's forcing us to do it we're gladly offering these free will offerings we love you we bless you anoint me here god i've tried to consecrate my life lord god today not eating lord god and just eating on your word so anoint me i just yield myself as a servant of god i'm nothing without you i can do nothing none of us can so annoy all of us by the holy spirit in jesus christ's name the saint said amen amen god bless you being seated praise god okay so i'd like to show us a number of slides here just have a lot of pictures here kind of from 2015 and uh 2020. i still remember the night brother johnny shared the video with me and uh i remember i listened to it i was driving to get some food from my children i don't remember what night that was anyways it shook me up while i was listening to it because it was so close to what brother branham has taught let me set a timer here so i don't wear you out in myself so i remember that night and uh and i talked to brother johnny i'm like i need to pray about this uh so i went in the closet i think the next morning and just prayed about it and i just had peace kind of come over me i just felt like it's very scriptural but i just felt like uh i don't think the rapture is going to happen in 2020. now i could be wrong but i specifically went in the prayer closet to pray about it no i like what brother ram says he says jesus said no man knows the day of the hour but that doesn't mean you can't know the week the month or the year right i like that because that's true you won't know the day or the hour but you could we could know the weak and brother amon and i we've all talked about it if we saw the dead in christ rise our faith would be on a whole another level it would be rapturing faith right and then we would know okay it's coming soon right like it wouldn't be it wouldn't be any question about it and we would just be we'd be on cloud nine you know we would be heavenly places for sure instantly um now are we for sure is that thus saith the lord we're gonna see the dead in christ no as far as like i don't know how long we're gonna see him but if god did it at the first coming when jesus resurrected they saw the saints for 40 days uh then we would just think it would happen again and brother ram did teach you know just taught it he didn't say thus saith the lord he said we'll see him for a little over a month um so he thought that but we're the ones living in the day praise god we're the ones that got to have we got to be real solid amen not to let the devil push us off into fanaticism you know uh where we're falsely prophesying things and not go off into worldliness and forget about it but just stay right down the middle of the road amen stay right with that pure word remember those quotes say write the pure word if you got the pure word when that time comes we'll have the full power the fullness of pentecost thus saith the lord will be with the pure word bride that's not me that's brother brandon so um a great great topic and i don't think i'll be able to cover it all tonight because i uh honestly i just i only watch a video once or twice yesterday and today so i need to go back and watch i i'm saying i could spend more time on the videos just watching those uh but i do want to share because it's almost september and part of this uh prophecy is for september it's it's like a prophecy i just want to make sure i don't miss anything here okay yeah so um that's our that's our text here now let's review 2015. because 2015 shook me to my core i was so shook i called brother craig i said brother craig is this the rapture i thought if i know anybody that would be ready for the rapture i'm calling brother craig you know because he's just so like godly you know i just love brother craig you know he taught me the bible you know he basically taught me the bible and he said no brother jesse said i don't think so he said because it's not coming with us saith the lord and it's not through brother branham that taught me a good lesson um so but let me tell you why i was so shaken up i think you'll see so as you as you'll see this these authors had noticed a seven year cycle and it was pretty convincing uh and the next so there was a collapse in 2008 i think it was 2008 remember the financial collapse our home loss of value i mean some of you probably the same thing not like it matters but um but now look church you know this has come and gone and there was no collapse in fact when the day after trump got elected the stocks went way up you remember that he brags about that all the time we shouldn't brag i'm praying for him i know you are too and i thought about this the other day the holy spirit put something in my heart well i believe it was i believe god is honoring trump because of mike pence because he went on and he said i gave my heart to jesus christ at a young age and i've lived pure he won't even have a meeting with another woman one-on-one without his wife being there so that's that's billy graham level there justification and a certain level of sanctification and they allow bible studies i have articles they they were having bible studies at the beginning of their uh term so i believe god is honoring trump because of pence and remember trump somehow got convicted or convinced convicted to honor israel so god's going to bless him for that that doesn't mean he's saved i'm not saying he's saved does he sure don't act like it you know i but i'm praying you know i hope you're praying too and the bible says to pray for him praise god so if you're not praying for him shame on you i don't mean that as a rebuke but we need to pray for our leaders believe that so that has come and gone and but i'll show you that that cycle was hitting that seven year cycle was hitting pretty good but then didn't happen in 2016. it didn't happen uh remember it's okay to predict it's not sinful because brother branham is a pure example brother brahm said i believe it all happened before 77 he said total annihilation before 77. but then he said but it could be 50. it could be a hundred years now see it i think god allows that to throw off some of the make-believers that don't they don't listen to church they don't have enough humility to recognize the difference between a prediction and a prophecy okay don't even we predict things all the time oh i'm gonna have a great time at the next year i'm gonna have a great time next year how do you know it's gonna happen we're gonna have a great vacation we're gonna have a great service what if it's a bad service we predict things all the time and we don't even see people don't even know how to give grace i think they attack brother brown because they obviously don't like his word they don't like his bible-based message okay and then a lot of these guys that's my first emoji on a slideshow in a while they're trying to sell books which i i sell books but i still haven't made one cent of all the money i put in those books i still made one penny on it and that's okay i'm not after money i'm after souls praise god that's what i'm after now do i want to sell yeah i'd like to sell more but not for money's sake it would just go right back in the ministry you know i mean this week i sent out two or three books for free nobody nobody gave me any money i just each time i do that it's seven dollars because it's four dollars for shipping in the us and then it's three dollars to print that book from amazon so every time i'm giving away seven dollars every time a book goes out it's my pleasure to do it because i believe everybody deserves a chance to hear the gospel amen now uh so i preached this march of 2015 and then this all took place in sept i remember karen was there lawrence was there i was shaking in my shoes man at the beginning so this man wrote uh jonathan khan wrote harbingers now harbinger's like a warning right and so he wrote it in 2012 he sold two million uh there was nine this it's really interesting there was nine harbingers that parallel israel in the u.s now that's really inspired because brother branham said we are a lot like israel right you know the founders kicked out all the inhabitants i mean there's a lot of truth when this what this man is saying okay and then there's the nine okay and he found and they're all they're all legitimate all of these warnings have happened to the united states so he's got a lot of truth and this man in essence uh america repeats the defiant so this man i forget he's yeah senator he quoted a scripture he quoted isaiah 9 10 and the scripture says we'll build and he's like this was right after 9 11 right he said we're going to rebuild he didn't even you know he was quoting the scripture he didn't even realize that's a bad scripture that was after god was putting a judgment on israel and israel and pride said we're going to build greater and bigger and that's how spiritual spiritually blind they are and now look here we are nine years later man you can truly see what's happening right so my conclusion was but this is what i preached to you it's difficult to know which history source to believe yeah on all those different uh harbingers nine isaiah 9 10 in its context do seem to fit the u.s response to 911 the terrorist attacks and we already know that judgment is upon the usa thus saith the lord okay so his big thing was to try to warn america to try to wake up america and i'm sure you see that you know in the social media preachers are still they're still praying for a national revival and god bless their their hearts i mean if they're sincere i'm glad they have hope right but we know there's no hope and we're not trying to be negative or critical um our big problem is we can't let the fact that we know that we can't let that hinder our outreach in other words we need to do a better job of inviting people to church right or just praying for souls to be saved right can i get amen and that's the danger right of knowing that only judgment's left but let me share this i forgot about this earlier we read those revival quotes this morning either some i didn't read brother ram said every oh you sang about the city having a revival that is so true brother our city in 2001 had a revival liberty center our hometown right we had a revival we had what eight or ten or twelve people come out of there uh but there's a quote brother ma'am said from it's from chicago i forget 62 or 63. brother max and boze now he disagreed with brother branham on some things but they had a revival and i i don't know how many people got saved let's let's just say 20 20 maybe 100. brother ram said see god has already shaken chicago and saved them i preached on that years ago i know karen was here i remember loris was here because laura's corrected me on the mats in mosaic which he was right i thought matt's in mosaic uh joseph matson jose was a true message follower he wasn't he just liked brother ramsey's healing ministry but brother man was telling brother joseph matson jose he said god is shaking chicago and only 20 or 100 people got saved so church i saw this god has started shaking akron uh 2001 in 2002 i got saved john graham lisa graham bang right carry a lady my wife god started shaking it amen now we're the only church preaching thus saith the lord of god's word for this hour say like that god can send revivals to cities praise god i believe it's a revival you might think i'm crazy because you know because there's 120 000 people in akron but even out of that oh church it's better than one in a million praise god we have better odds for a revival right one in a million right we know god like egypt two million came out two million only two made the promised land one out of a million made actually made it to the holy ghost right the baptism holy ghost in tight so we've had more than a good share of revival here praise god now we've got sisterhood amen look at that bye right here in akron and if our children get saved look at that each one of these look at the value of these souls praise god amen so see church we gotta take that into consideration so that's why we still pray for revival that's why i still pray for uh abortion centers to be cut down you know not cut down but closed i don't want to incite any violence that's what i'm saying yeah um because i know god can move praise god i know we know god can do great things amen so uh i didn't invest time into reading it his book i just hit the highlights online and i watched some videos and then he wrote a second book the shamita this was the seven year cycle okay so this came out in 2014 bestseller again now here's sir this shook me when i first saw i remember seeing this reason see every seven years there would be a financial crisis see that's why i was so shooken up because i know god works in sevens how many believe that well i remember that i lived through that i lived through that i guess i was born right here um but i don't remember all those well there was no crash there was no crash in 2015. right so is that is that interesting like you you know there's there's a pattern and then it stops that's why i was shook up because i saw it i saw the pattern and then there was oh yeah then there was a jubilee with it too i mean so 2015 2016 was another jubilee year another 50 cycle so i was like you know i know god works in numbers you know uh so i was really shaken up so the conclusions uh it's difficult to know the history some of his resources were from wikipedia you don't know how reliable those are i don't fully understand the seven year cycle i didn't know if it naturally applies to u.s because it remembers spoken to israel and i did witness the last two releases you know 2001 2008 and uh brother branham said israel in the u.s parallel many ways okay now here's where even more shook me up do you remember this does that remember september 2015. this is the september was the seventh jewish month and the jewish new year was in september and then the pope came remember that and uh barack obama said come on in your holiness he called him your holiness i thought oh mercy lord shows which side you're on and all of them did that all those republican democrat all of them said your holiness ah they're deceived deceived church by the world so the pope came and then the final blood moon was on the 28th which i saw that i would say you'd have to watch that so i i close it by saying if you feel crash is coming then pray and prepare but i didn't feel led that way if some people in that time were buying gold and silver and storing up food i just didn't feel led to do it there may be a time to do that i don't know i've never felt led to do that yet johnny and i talked about that i've never felt led yet but that doesn't mean we couldn't be led to do that right so i so after talking to brother craig i said i'm going to put more emphasis on thus saith the lord from brother branham then on these books but you know can you can everybody see how it would be okay for me to be shook up by that i mean all the sevens the fifties uh the pope oh and then the china president came in september or either late september or early october the president of china or it's not president what they call prime minister something like that he came that same time and i thought you got the bamboo curtain uh got the purple curtain ah goodness remember the blood moons here's the dates on the blood moons i mean i remember that one i remember seeing those we talked about it at school a little bit yeah all these blood moons 2014. i mean it was it was really it was really uh striking now here's what i found when i went and studied the scripture all the blood moons were related to judgment so god said i'll turn the moon to blood under the sixth seal well that's after the rapture right so either the either the blood moons were going to be not pertained to the rapture or the rapture was going to be before that september 28th that's why i was so shooked up because church you're not we don't want to miss anything we don't want to live in fear but at the same time we don't want to feel like we've missed out on something right and you might not be human but i'm human and sometimes you might not be human church no i know y'all but sometimes i get afraid like i was afraid of being a chronic virus because i didn't know much about it i tried to limit our 10 feet and i remember the first time karen and i tried to shook hands and we pulled it back you know you remember that just because i don't know i don't i don't want people to die you know right i mean who you don't um but then after 14 days then that turns to 28. and then that 50 a day i'm like i'm over it's a jubilee from this thing i'm done i'm done so we just learn to grow right we learn to grow with grace and knowledge of the lord so i i when you took it back to scripture and i this was like the last revelation i had was that blood moons are pertaining to the tribulation the sixth seal so i felt like i don't think this would be the time okay then i went through quotes there's two quotes about thus say the lord from brother branham he said don't evangelize to them because they're going to be saved in one day okay but i want you to know that i want you to see a little balance on this bear with me here i hope you understand this and i hope i made this clear i hope i made this clear god's bride has to be has to have representatives from every tribe kindred and tongue okay so in other words there has to be israelite people in the bride of jesus christ with the baptism of the holy ghost and i mean outside of the hundred forty four thousand now you might disagree with me on that that's okay but i believe there still has to be the man called it a bouquet bride and if you read revelation 7 the bible says there are people in white robes with palms from every kindred nation tongue and people now that's the word of god so the reason i say that is because i know a message pastor who left the pastoring to be a missionary and his main emphasis now is on israel just introducing the message and he's seen people receive the message and there's a message church in israel now the church but but here we go thus saith the lord which i understand that now that that's true but there's also other scripture like where in other words the bride has to take the gospel to every nation right then so you have two truths there's truth we shouldn't thus say lord we shouldn't try to evangelize the whole nation but then we have another truth where we got to save some from every nation and every nation has to hear the word of god now that might stumble some people i hope not here maybe over the internet but i i hope everyone understands that by god's grace and then brother man said that says lord the jews that have their own church again in temple worship which we know we know they're going to have that they're going to rebuild it okay those are the quotes i'm not going to go with that because i preached that back in 2015. so my conclusion um he that the man who wrote those two books he had a connection to tbn and jim baker now jim baker i hate to say this but he is all about the survival packs they make millions of dollars on selling survival packs i mean what i'm talking about my dad used to watch him when before he got divorced and my dad said he's going to fall into sin and he fell into sin he had another wife and promiscuous and all these things my dad could spot i mean it's not hard if you got the holy spirit right you can spot a false preacher like that begging for money begging money money money money my dad called it out before my brother simon and simon and i we all saw it robert tilton benny hinn my dad he caught him all out so he had a connection and the best-selling books you know so that didn't that seemed didn't fit with me didn't seem to sit well with me now ron peterson who's a message pastor in arizona i've never met him but i listened to a sermon he did a good job he showed how um god did amazing things on feast days because you know the blood moons lined up with the feast days and israel's new year so i listen to that i'm like oh maybe this is the end you know now date setting it may only apply to the rapture since jesus said no man knows the day of the hour so in other words you could set dates for daniel 70 weeks you can do that because there's actually a certain number of days three and a half years or seven years you can actually know the dates for israel but will be gone by god's grace by god's grace and then voice of god i don't know what they put out but i don't uh and then i showed some future prophecies by the way i'm gay okay so let's look at this message here for today was that a good review do you ever remember that i was shocked i was like wow no wonder i was nervous you know because to me george i i just i look at things and i want to be right i don't want to miss anything and church god knows my heart i don't want you to miss anything because if you miss it and it's my fault then it's all me and i don't want to i don't want to stand on that day as a deceiver or someone who missed it i want to know because i know there's uh souls under my my voice and the last thing i want to do is get there and say you purposely i want to tell you saints everything that's why i tell you when brother man made a mistake i'll tell you if there's quotes you're not familiar with i'll tell you because i don't want you to be deceived i want you to know exactly what i believe the word says and what i want to point you right to the word of god i want you to know the truth because the truth will set you free okay so two videos have been shared bang shared one real good that's a good one brother bang i appreciate you sharing that with me there's a lot of truth in that one and then uh johnny shared this one with me so here's the two videos uh this one's got two million that's pretty popular this one's not so much popular but it's more recent but it's really really uh has some really good points so those are the two videos let's go through the first one now it's a it's what is it a 15-minute video yeah a 16-minute video okay now i'm gonna go through some details about the video so what you notice the he this man is assemblies of god pastor that's the denomination i came out of and that's the one that your uh ex-pastor's into right brother yep right so i was raised in his denomination i'll tell you one thing let me let's get ahead real quick um look how they dress now women and pants cutting hair just so you know this is not holiness right they haven't received the revelation of holiness yet okay and i'm not downing anybody i'm just saying like um if you've got if you're the bride you have all the word right and everybody can see first timothy 2 9 women adorn themselves in modest apparel it does not say the word of god okay so um now a little bit on his background so this man reads 40 not i don't know if he's i don't know if he's exaggerating but he says he reads 40 newspapers a day now i don't even know how that's possible now one time i brother brother amen i have to apologize to you and your wife i think the last time i prayed for you i said i've had this happen millions of times that was a exaggeration so forgive me i forget what it was i i tell you i was going through something i said it's happened a million times i was exaggerating forgive me okay i don't know if he's exaggerating here that's a lot of newspapers to read 40 he said i read 40 every day that's the first little thing like are you reading the bible then there's only so many hours in the day right okay now he claims his dreams were from december 19 december 2019 but this was not posted till june of this year so it was about seven months after the fact okay so his dreams foretold covet 19 in march and then the riots in june so in his dream he saw a calendar he saw march and he saw a hand underline a finger underline march and tap it three times and then they skipped ahead to june underlined june the handed and tapped it three times and then he saw how kovid came in march and then the riots after uh george was his last name what was it george ford thank you george floyd was killed by the police officer but now there's a report on that they don't know if the drugs killed him now of course it's awful to lay on somebody's neck right but that and just so you know that's that's actually a tactic they can use in the minnesota police they can to to get somebody unconscious they can lay on their neck like you can i saw it online it's on there it's in their handbook now church that's nothing that's nothing we would ever want to do right thank god we're not cops can you say amen to that thing thank god like we don't have to put our lives on the line every day get shot at and get punched and almost killed you know so i'm not defending one of the other i'm just saying there's more to the story than what a lot of people look at it okay you know i'm i'm not i'm not racist i love every color i love every creed god give me a church of almost every color not creed uh color a nation and tongue i love it praise god small but i love all the diversity praise god and i mix myself praise god like 30 spanish and uh 30 great britain and i forget what the other is so yeah tapping the months okay and then um the cam the months kept flipping and then it came to september which we're on in a couple days on the finger underlined it and then tapped it three times and then it flipped ahead to november underlined it but then it punched it and it exploded the calendar exploded something like that okay and then after november exploded he saw vultures flying over cities now later i'll show it he said the the vultures turn into gargoyles which are like half ape dragon type of things they're like big huge apes but they got wings you know and they fly i don't know how to describe it they have them on all these catholic churches and that shows you what the spirits are made of amen they're full of unclean and hateful birds okay so it's like a ape slash bat massive bat okay so that speaks of tribulation right we all know that there are going to be creatures like scorpions with tails right creatures with you know wings like bats hair oh yeah that's right hair hanging down from their wings like hair of women so long uncut hair that's in the fifth trumpet i think if i'm not mistaken and then he kept hearing this brace yourself brace yourself brace yourself okay so that's uh that's like they're gonna hit something okay but to me i think jesus he's like the eagle and we sit under the shadow of his wings amen right so i feel like he'd protect us but then there are quotes or brother ram says we we may be physically bereft right that's a quote from the church age book in other words we may be physically deprived in the squeeze brother ram calls the bride a hunted persecuted group in the church book right so but none of those are thus saith the lord just so you know in church if anybody should know we need to be careful making things thus say the lord that aren't it should be us right because you got to because time passes and we find out okay i didn't know he said this i didn't know so we just have to let him be a man right let him have his own opinions but to be very careful what we make thus saith the lord oh yeah i'm sorry so that was the fir the first stream had march june the second dream had september november okay the fist hit the counter in november oh yeah and then afterwards he saw riots he said everywhere right it's all over the u.s schools were closed he said schools had uh spider webs in them now i don't know about your school but my school they keep it squeaky clean i mean they are they're on it especially with covid it's even better now it's even cleaner now it is i mean after we leave they are instantly in there spraying down everything they call it mist they miss the whole room they're like don't leave out paper because it'll make the paper wrinkle you know goodness um and then he said money he said there was like vacuums over the banks vacuuming up the money now that may be just you know parable right that may just be but he said a lot of money was being taken from banks and then he saw a washington dc burning and there was no trump or no president there it was just burning this is in november he said this was all november and then he said he saw chinese soldiers russian soldiers and united nations soldiers in washington dc and on american grounds i just so you know there's a quote brother ram says uh and amen and i were talking about this i saw my video future prophecies brother branham says uh he said we might have russian soldiers coming in and ravishing and destroying he said but the church will be gone before that he said thus saith the lord so we have thus saith the lord if there's going to be enemy soldiers but iran said thus saith the lord the church will be gone he said we won't see that he said it's thus saith the lord now to me that's god's grace that's god's grace to me oh yeah and then the guard he said the uh vultures turned into gargoyles and then again heard brace yourself brace yourself so you brace yourself if you're gonna have an impact right if you're gonna hit something so to me oh then he had a third dream he said there was shortage on cash at a bank he went to and in the dream the u.s was no longer printing coins and he they said no one dollars one dollar bill or five dollar bills in the future so in other words they're going to stop doing cash has become a cash to society now just so you know he had that dream on the 24th because he said i'm sorry 25th he said he had the night before but cnn has an article that uh businesses were already running out of cash on june 18th so in other words this again is after the fact this wasn't prophetic so i'm just letting you know the only thing that's prophetic is september november all the other stuff we have no proof that it was prophetic okay because it's all after the fact and i take that same approach with brother branham like when i made the video about brother brown three prophecies i used i could only use prophecies that were recorded before the fact because i can't go back and prove i wasn't there in 1933 there's no recordings in 1933 with the seven major visions do i believe there thus saith the lord absolutely but can i prove that they were before the fact no i can't because the first mention is 1958. so just an overlay man that's why you don't notice on some of these videos uh i have to be very careful because i can't go back and i can't prove that that actually happened because there's no recording of it but i believe it i do believe it all right um so again now look how close this is to the message you have crazy creatures in the tribulation right you have uh soldiers invading now you have this is revelation 13 no cash right they they can cut off cat they can control the economy he said the warns of civil war in the u.s now that i've never heard that he said troops in our cities but didn't mention that perhaps they'll invade and his suggestion he's the thing to do he said the main thing is pray but he said i suggest you stockpile food gold silver guns and ammunition okay now people feel led to do that that's fine um i haven't you know uh so to me that again there's a like that connection to the the business of selling food and money and or guns and gold and things like that i don't but then again like bill graham said we might have to go through some trying times the thing is we don't know so we have to love we have to trust god love and do what we feel like to do praise god so do what we feel led to do hope i don't forget anything here okay so that's his family assemblies of god so observations he's sincere now this is interesting this is another reason why we know he's not a prophet because he says he never said thus saith the lord this was never thus saith the lord yet he kept saying i believe i know the voice of god i believe yet he's reading 40 newspapers a day it's hard to i say can you say amen it's hard to hear the still small voice of the lord what if you just watched 40 videos a day that weren't message could you hear the voice of god dead i think i might hear the voice of donald trump right i start hearing his voice 40. that's a lot no 40. i have never gone back to see how many youtube videos i watching today but i'd be interested to see how many i do i hope it's not 40. i hope maybe on my worst day maybe um because because i see how it affects me spiritually like i tell mother johnny i've said it here i can't watch some of these women uh politicians in washington my blood will boil because they kill babies if they say they're for all lives matter it just makes you want to cry now it's awful these people are so demon possessed and murderers they don't even know they're so blind the mystery of iniquity has totally taken them over it's awful and then my children you know my children say daddy how can these politicians like abortion you know because we just saw the baby born we we're seeing the glory of a baby and like you're like daddy how can these people i said i said haven i said kate cares they're filled with demons they are murderers they're filled with evil the glory of seeing the baby and the beauty of it and the the innocence you know zion cries he's like yeah i'm like you're so precious like he can't do anything he's got to rely on me for everything well not me my wife but he's so precious got this little whimpery weak cry and that's god and god he's a servant to god he's god's little servant and jesus came that way one time humbled himself i just think it's amazing now he does he's humble in the way that he says he said if this doesn't happen now look we said by december 1st it doesn't happen he said you're welcome to say i was wrong wow that's quite a statement so he's saying all that troops gargoyles can you imagine a person making a statement we're going to have gargoyles out here by december 1st can you imagine somebody go on the internet and say that you'd have to be really led of the lord or really deceived so just watch that what if i said bang there's going to be a gargoyle out here tonight after service what would you think you might think i was losing my mind parkinson's is setting in something like that so just letting you know i mean we gotta look at these things with a spiritual mind right so these are the only ones that are before the facts i wanted to preach this before september okay so everybody could pray up we're gonna pray here a little bit i'm almost at 40 minutes and these sermons are a little bit easier to pay attention right because it's it's so outside of the ordinary it's not just like the words it's kind of just telling a story of what people are saying now this is interesting and i've seen a message pastor he really believes this is going to happen but he believes we can pray and push it off to the future now that could be that could be no doubt about that um but again it's not thus saith the lord he pastors church and berksville kentucky that was right near where brother brown was born isn't that shocking like that shook me like oh wow right where brother brown was born look he said 42 years ago this is 1951 sixth day of april god gave me my life on this earth in a little cabin near brooksville so the message pastor caught that and i didn't catch that at first i was like wow a man from brother graham's almost birth place america kentucky and then talking about the squeeze and literally at the end of the very end of the video he says he said get ready there's coming an oil press there's coming a squeeze upon the church i'm like well well there's a lot of things that are pretty yeah they're pretty close in there so what i'm saying is i've never seen it this close before this is a lot closer than the shemitah and the harbinger and the blood moons it's a lot closer but then we see some things that are a little bit off now one thing he never mentions the rapture so in his vision brother then he said he saw after november now he said he saw christians hiding out their homes with all their gun and ammunition in other words fighting for themselves right which we know there may be some foolish virgins have to do that now i watch a guy give a comment on this just a short video and he made a good point he said uh he said what what what would a christian do what would be worth killing a sinner for for a christian in other words how is that going to help a christian's testimony to kill somebody he said would it be okay for you to kill somebody over your car oh don't steal my car i'm going to shoot you and kill you would that be a good reason to kill somebody so that that the man who responded this he made a good point he said i just can't see god's people shooting that mowing down people with an ar rifle because in the bible you see people just surrendering right you see stephen surrender you say oh god receive my spirit he goes to sleep and then the stones all hit him you see jesus did jesus fight back jesus didn't fight back when they came to arrest him so but again i'm not going to say that's has to be thus saith the lord how it's going to i don't know how it's going to be i don't want to be here to know what it's going to be like but we have to take these things into consideration okay when you start looking at people's uh prophecies so to me it's like he's speaking to believers preparing for the tribulation but again we might have to prepare for the squeeze i don't know it's never thus saith the lord that i found and remember i went through all three thousand i looked at this week i went through all three thousand of those years ago and i never found a squeeze thus saith the lord it's the most scriptural yeah he calls out an oil press um squeeze most scriptural dream about the squeeze that i've heard in denominations or ever well i'm sorry maybe i'd take that back i think amen and hula have had some really good dreams about the rapture remember that i forgot to write that down um they've had some good dreams like one of them i think sisterhood correct me if i'm wrong one of them is like we were all protected in this white or something in the sky we were like in some type of cube and we were protected up in the air while the world was going through tribulation something like that does that sound familiar yes okay yeah praise god i think right when you came okay praise the lord yeah before he even came here that's right um so that's a very scriptural dream we're at the meeting in the air while the world's going through tribulation brother amen's had dreams about uh you know a little bit of squeeze us under uh some pressure i call it like that and then jesus being with us so um in the nominations this is the closest thing i've seen to it now let's go the other one this is a really good one um as far as you'll see now this is a brand new this was new to me if you got your bible go to psalm 90 10 um you may remember i preach a little bit on generations from time to time a generation seems to be 40 years in the bible right but ram said that but then there's so many generation scriptures that it's kind of hard to tell sometimes exactly how long a generation is okay so what i'm saying is that it's a little bit unclear i don't know if it's exactly 40 years every time just because there's different scriptures that make it seem like longer okay and i i didn't have that study ready for today that's why i said i mean if you have questions you'll share them with me i'll research them this week um but that's just from my memory psalm 90 10. now they use this scripture verse 10. the days of our years are three score intense that's 70 right three score 60. uh and if by reason of strength maybe four score years yet is their strength labor and sorrow for it is soon cut off and we fly away so david of course is saying i'm sorry this is a prayer moses i'm sorry yeah moses i thought they said david so moses prayed this so moses is saying you know god gives us 70 years jesus only got 33. right so we got it we got to understand these are not like that 70 years not a promise to everybody it's not a guarantee it's god's general promise right it's just a general promise uh but he said sometimes it may extend to 80 years okay so then jesus uh said this generation will not pass so all these things be fulfilled he said when the fig tree is bringing forth its bud he said look lift up your heads redemption draws nigh and he said this generation that sees the fig tree putting forth its bud will not pass until they see the coming of the lord okay so brother random uses this in the church age book i don't have this in front of me but the reason i remember is because i preached it here a couple years ago and someone in the message met me and bawled me out for saying it but i was just making the point brother braham said he said everything's fulfilled in the church age book he said uh this generation won't pass till they see the coming of the lord well if a generation is 40 years what's 65 plus 40. 2005. so if that's your strict definition all these things have to happen in this generation well then that mist but it wasn't thus saith the lord so it's okay right he's like was 1977. it wasn't though the lord it's someone it's a prophet who's really trying to inspire people to get ready praise god get ready signs are lining up all these things are happening and he bawled me out but by the end he uh i was crying and he was crying too and he couldn't disagree with me by the end praise god he was upset i was using youtube and making videos and i was weeping i was saying i said right across the subway i said i said i'm making those because if my family won't come hear me preach maybe they'll click and watch me preach on there if they won't come in this church maybe in this in the sincerity of their home the quietness the secret place maybe the holy spirit would move them to hear the word of god so i'd do anything to get them to hear the word of god praise god and i think you could see it by the end hopefully i don't know where he's at now but so with that i just have a couple slides on many sides so what this man is saying he's saying if israel became a nation in 1948 if you add 80 years that's 2028. okay we just passed the 70. you remember that the brother put it on youtube i'm sorry the brother in the philippines put on youtube like get ready it's the 70th year this might be the end this might be the rapture year which it wasn't but i mean i'm glad he's trying to get people ready but sometimes you know guessing it just kind of wears people out you keep guessing every year it's going to wear people out but i appreciate people wanting it it's okay to guess it's okay to predict so his point is that scripture could be a generation it might be it might but notice the word generation isn't used in psalms 90 verse 10 but that doesn't mean god could be hiding it from the eyes of the wise and prudent revealing on the basis if anybody believes that we believe it praise god okay so he's saying if the tribulation is seven years which i believe it is now i used to think it was only three and a half i do believe by scripture it is now because i went back and studied it i think i was wrong he's saying if if um the tribulation is seven years and this all the generation that sees the israel restored they have to uh see the rapture then he's saying the rapture has to take place this year because uh the following year if you add those up uh you have to in other words you have to fit the seven years within there i can't explain it very good i didn't like i said i didn't have enough time to study it but i see the point he's making right i see the point he's making um now here's his points that he ends with i thought some of them are scriptural now look he thinks the rapture will come now this guy is a uh uh seven-day adventist by the way i looked it up seventh day at venice which they have a lot of good things they're against worldly music they're against uh immoral dressing but then they wear high heels and makeup you know they cut their hair so this is true do we have ever increasing birth pains yeah that's true now he brings out in january right before the coronavirus came trump tried to make a deal of the century i don't remember this he tried to make a deal of the century uh with israel but the palestinians turn it down but this guy thought that it will divide the land of israel and give israel more land but i know the palestinians didn't accept it at least back then he said we have israel aged to 72 or we're approaching the last eligible fall season in order for the fig tree generation matthew 24 to be fulfilled okay so that one that one i don't know now here's one i forgot yeah he said there's a solar eclipse coming in 2024 which would land on the feast of the tabernacles now that represents uh the millennium because right you're in booths you're building your own house and booths so he's saying the millennium or he said it has to happen there because you have a total solar eclipse he said oh because it's 2020 and we have perfect vision well what if you do 2020 bc did they have perfect vision back then in 2020 bc right i mean if you make 2020 so important what about bc what about the first 2020 after adam lived i don't know and then this is true right here the beast system is rising right we see it that's what i think that's what cove is all about it's testing the people to see what they'll give up because they ha we know the bible revelation 13 they have to have a one world government and they have to have a one world currency they're able to shut it down they have to and have control where you can't get your money unless you take this mark it has to happen so see like i said a few of these these two are for sure i'm not sure about the other things okay so let me finish up here here's the reasons i don't think it's 2020. now myself could it happen in 2020 yes it could but the reason i don't think is because brother the holy spirit told brother pick brother man pick up your pen and write and the he said the bride will be forced to stop preaching according to revelation 13 16. and that hasn't happened yet okay now it could but i feel like god i was listening to brother branham said and this is true historically all the christians were out of israel five years before titus came in 70 a.d because the holy spirit kept warning them through prophets get out titus is coming get out and they're out four or five years beforehand in other words god made sure not one of their hairs was touched praise god that's how much god takes care of his holy ghost field saints when judgment was coming god takes care of his people in other words what i'm saying is if if the rapture was going to come and i'm forced to stop preaching before the rapture i'm i feel like god would give me plenty of time to prepare if he gave them five years i'd at least hope for a week maybe i don't know a day i'll take anything you know um so i just feel like god would give us time to prepare i feel like god is gonna make it sure he's gonna take care you're not gonna hide it from us we'll know the season i'd just be you know we'll see the dead in christ that's what i believe mother and says in the church age book the united states has to change laws against the bride they're probably going to call it hate speech right they're probably going to call us hate speech which we're not we're love speech but they're but they have to do that that's gonna now they you know they can pass legislation real quick but we don't see those laws in the mix yet okay uh seven major visions brother branham in some places he says five of them are fulfilled but in another place he said we don't even have the roads yet the highways for the driverless cars so i believe to me this is my opinion driverless cars have to happen before the rapture because after the rapture the two prophets come down and then it doesn't rain for three and a half years that's in israel and that's when they have control over all nature so i feel like things have to be looking beautiful and oh prosperity peace and safety remember that pieces they'll be saying peace safety i believe that will all have to happen before the rapture because then the bible says sudden what destruction sun destruction i mean church when this bride goes up there's no more blood are you with me we are the the holy spirit is our life there's no more mercy it's judgment that's what god said god said i'm my my spirit will not always strive with man once i get those eight in the ark it's over and i believe the same thing will happen this day once that bride's gone god knows none of these people really want to sell out to the word that's a hard thing to say but that's true because it happened in those it happened in the days of noah people don't want to think about the word anymore they don't want to meditate on the word and praise god they just want to live worldly uh also i said this this morning not every nation has heard the message matthew jesus said the gospel must be preached to every nation a priest i don't mean play tape that means preach right i know i'm heavy on that you know and i don't want to hurt anybody's feelings on that but don't get me wrong i do think it's okay to if i play the tape a little bit you hear brother man's voice i think that's okay i told by amen too if i ever got sick and we had to play tape i would play a tape but that's brother brandon said never said that's the way to do it okay just i think most people understand that so we need translators missionaries and then the warning is coming through a denomination okay just like with jonathan khan denominational guy nice guy probably prays for the sick i think this guy prays for the sick he's pentecostal but it's not thus saith the lord right and it's not coming in the message of the hour that doesn't mean god can't use him right god can use him god can speak through a donkey uh god can speak any way he wants just speak through a star he can use a star to speak he can do anything he can speak by putting a hand right on a wall and he can speak that way he can do whatever he wants to do but we just feel like it wouldn't come through denomination now brother man ends the seventh seal by saying help me god i tell you the truth these are spiritually discerned to me discerned by the holy spirit by every one of them has identified his place in the bible now what this great secret is ladies beneath the seventh seal i don't know i don't know i couldn't make it out i couldn't tell just what it was just what it said but i know that it was them seven thunders uttering themselves right out close together just banging seven different times but it unfolded something else that i seen then when i seen that i looked for the interpretation that flew across there and i couldn't make it out it's exactly right friends see the hour isn't quite yet for it but it's moving into that cycle see it's coming up close so when the seventh seal obama said in the sevens it was open all the revelation flew by i couldn't see it that's the day and hour of the rapture it's a secret god i'm gonna let it be known so the thing to do for bride of christ fellowship is remember that i speak to you in the name of the lord be prepared for you don't know what time something can happen the holy spirit i felt just brought this quote back to my mind let's remember who spoke to us in the name of the lord and these are good like i'm very glad johnny and bank very thank very very thankful you shared these with me because i want to be watching right i want to be watching but i need to pray more praise god you need to watch him pray okay close with this this is the scripture my title but of that day and hour no no man no not the angels which are in heaven neither the son father take ye heed watch and pray for you know not when the time is for the son of man is as a man taking a far journey who left his house gave authority to his servants into every man's work and commanded the porter to watch are you doing your work god called you to do let's keep working till jesus comes praise god amen do your work take care of your family right go to work and witness do whatever you do do your work praise god watch ye therefore for you know not when the master of the house cometh at even or at midnight or at the crowing or in the morning now look jesus didn't even nail it down to like i'm coming in the morning people say between six and nine they got a quote on that but jesus said you don't know yet we all think it's gonna be between six and nine because there's a quote on it but jesus says you don't know if it's the morning see might be six and nine for us in america or might not be for us maybe that'll be for those in japan or those in africa or we don't know so we gotta be ready at all times hallelujah less less coming suddenly he find you sleepy and what i say unto you all watch here's what watch means strict that's what we're doing tonight right sunday night could be doing other things you're giving strict attention to the word of god tonight that's we need to watch more of the word right we watch enough news and i do i need to watch more of the word cautious and act so cautious cautious sounds like you're but then active you're active so you're cautious and active at the same time right you're cautiously active so you only move when you got thus saith the lord praise god when you've got the word of god amen take heed uh lester remission see that's laziness can't be lazy indolence laziness as well some destructive calamities suddenly overtake you and what i say unto you i say unto all watch so let's stand here let's have a word of prayer i think i'll set a timer just because i do want to be respectful i preach over an hour about an hour we don't need musicians right now i just want to have a time record you can stop the livestream
