TRANSCRIPT
========================================
foreign about to turn around this way I bless you Saints if you're live streaming here we'll try this looks like it's working so we'll see okay First Corinthians 3 10 thank you for your patience Jesus told Peter if you love me feed my sheep so that's what we're trying to do today we're trying to feed God Sheep amen so First Corinthians 3 10. you're probably already there and I'll be there in just a second here I'd like to speak this morning on laying foundational Bible truth this morning I'd like to cover a number of important foundational subjects for the body of Jesus Christ I hope it'll be a blessing by God's grace I'll be teaching this morning teaching right from the word of God so just hold your Bible there as we preach uh probably have you turn a lot of pages and we'll cover a lot of ground today by the grace of God Amen the Bible says man does not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God hallelujah chapter 3 verse 10. here we get a beautiful picture of how God used Apostle Paul to lay the foundation for the church or the body of Jesus Christ through the Epistles that Jesus had him right to the churches so chapter 3 verse 10 and 11 according to the grace of God which is given unto me as a wise master builder I have laid the foundation and another man built it thereon but let every man take heed how he buildeth thereon let's all read verse 11. I'd like to hear your voices too let's read verse 11 on three one two three four other Foundation can no man lay then that is laid which is Jesus Christ amen so who's our foundation Jesus Christ and who is Jesus Christ he's the word he is a he is a literal person with a glorified body in heaven but his word is a form of his character that we have here in the Bible praise God so we have a written testimony of the character of Jesus Christ when Jesus comes back at Armageddon the Bible said his name is called the word of God hallelujah so let's have a word of prayer ask the Lord to minister before we're seated Heavenly Father we love you today Lord your yoke is easy and your burden is light Lord God we're so thankful for the grace of God we're thankful for the holy ghost that we feel this morning Lord God thank you Lord that our name is on the roll up in heaven Hallelujah and when the role is Called Up Yonder I'll be there Hallelujah We Believe Lord our names are written on the Lamb's Book of Life written with the blood of Jesus Christ before the foundation of the world as the scripture tells us Lord God thank you for these great exceeding precious promises the scripture declares Lord I'm so glad I can say I'm one of them Lord God I'm one of those Saints who love the Lord Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost filled Saint thank you God for your grace and mercy today bless his congregation Lord each and every person who pressed their way out to the house of God today for you Minister here Lord in this uh in this building Lord God also you pray you Minister there in Akron Lord through this live stream we pray God sweet thank you for your love and your compassion and Lord let the Holy Spirit speak today Lord as we look at laying foundational Bible truth here for this local assembly here Lord May the name of Jesus Christ be magnified and glorified May the Holy Ghost teach us the word of God this morning and we'll give you all the praise in Jesus Christ's name and Saint said amen amen God bless yours you're being seated praise God well it's good to be back with you and last time I was with you we were baptizing uh who said 17 of you I believe by God's grace so we're very thankful for that and what a what a glorious day that was praise God so I hope trust you're all walking on serving the Lord with all your heart praise God and I heard last week was a wonderful blessing for brother Irvin Levi so we're very thankful for that and I trust today will be a great blessing to you as well so you had we had brother Arlie was that last weekend you were with or the previous weekend Brother Ali was with us he got to stay at my house on the Saturday night and uh brother then leave Levi was there with us on the Sunday morning I think I preached on Praise Jesus name in the dance and we are dancing all over the church praise God because because I enjoy that Liberty the Holy Spirit but it was great to have Arley and Levi and the family there we so appreciate them by the grace of God so we love the Saints here and we'll just trust the Lord we'll do some teaching this morning you know when Jesus Christ was on Earth he did both preaching and teaching preaching it the word preach means to declare and so when a man preaches the gospel he declares the promises of God now when he teaches the gospel he gives instructions on how to live a Godly life and so the Bible said in Matthew chapter 9 verse 35 that Jesus went about all the cities and Villages teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the Kingdom Hallelujah healing every sickness and every disease among the people so Jesus had both a preaching Ministry and a Teaching Ministry so I would I would maybe summarize it or try to simplify it like this preaching is declaring the promises of God what God has done what he is doing what he will do praise God declaring God's promises such as God's A Healer praise God and God is a savior Hallelujah God will save your soul and God will God is going to Rapture his church for one day praise God all the all the great declarations that are true that we need to hear praise God and then teaching comes and it gives you instructions such as how to pray how to fast praise God how to uh how to become a Godly person by God's grace how to grow in the grace of God it gives you instructions for uh all the the needs as a Christian to learn how to be a better Christian Hallelujah and so when when we when we look to the word of God we look for preaching you know the brother random calls it Evangelical Services when you're just preaching and trying to raise the faith of the people to to receive Promises of God and then he says there's another kind of anointing that teaches the people that imparts instruction and shows them how to live a Godly life Hallelujah and so this morning I feel led to uh to to do some teaching this morning but you never know sometimes if if the people are pulling I'll lay some preaching in there as well by God's grace because you never know how the people the people ultimately you have control over the service if you're polling on the word of God if you're really meditating in your heart uh if you're drawing nigh to God God will draw an eye to you praise God and word we see that in the scripture you know God can take a he can take someone a different direction praise God uh you see that in the book of Acts praise God you know Philip was uh in a Revival service right he was he was there in Samaria uh and he was casting out Devils doing all these things and then God but God knew there was a there was a eunuch who needed to hear the gospel praise God and so God changed because of the pull of that man that desire of the man to know God God pulled him out of that Revival and sent him out to preach to one person praise God so God knows what he's doing amen and God is here to meet your need today God is here to speak to your heart how many love the Lord today amen praise God now let's go to Luke 6 48 I'd like to start there Luke 6 48. I'll probably have some of the Saints do some reading if you've got your Bibles here I want to look at numerous foundational Bible truths so laying foundational Bible truths 6 48 brother Irvin whenever you get that you can read that while he's getting there Paul laid the foundation for every New Testament Church now of course we know Jesus said few there be that find him very few churches very few people will find the way that leads to life praise God but we are we are the few that have found the way to to eternal life praise God we found it by the grace of God hallelujah if you have found it uh Paul laid the gospel and now God has sent in this time these last 100 years God has sent brother Branham to point us back to the Bible and now we read the Bible and the Holy Spirit uh takes these words makes them come alive praise God we receive the word of God and the word of God gives us life Hallelujah so Paul laid the foundation but Jesus teaches here in this verse brother Irvin's going to read that Christ when you come to Christ he starts laying a foundation in your life what would happen if a building doesn't have a foundation who knows what would happen it's going to collapse Hallelujah so each person in their spiritual life has to have the right foundation and thank God you know who the Cornerstone is this morning amen Jesus Christ is the Cornerstone Hallelujah he's the accepted we've accepted him as our Cornerstone so brother Irvin would you read that there uh it's Luke 6 48. he is like a man which build a house and dig deep and Lake the foundation on a rock and when the blood arose and the stream beat family on that house and could not shake it or it was founded on the Iraq Hallelujah hey man Hallelujah so in each life Jesus Christ wants to reveal himself to each person and Jesus Christ is the rock hallelujah the Bible said that rock in the wilderness was Christ in First Corinthians chapter 10 Hallelujah but each person's got to dig down you got to get down you got to dig deep down in your life deep down in your heart get down to the very foundation and the foundation must be a rock the very Foundation of your life must be Jesus Christ what matters most must be Christ the word of God hallelujah amen and then the Bible also gives us another insight into that in Matthew 16 Jesus said uh Peter you know Peter who am I and Peter said Thou Art the Christ and Jesus said that's right he said and Upon This Rock he said flesh and blood is not reviewed unto you but my Father which is in heaven he has revealed it unto you praise God he said and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it amen amen what a promise if we can receive the revelation of Jesus Christ no matter what Storms Come Hallelujah no matter what winds come in our lives they're not going to be able to knock us over they will not be able to collapse Our Lives as our brother said amen Our Lives will stand because they're founded on the revelation of who Jesus Christ is he is the word of God Amen Hallelujah praise the Lord such beautiful promises amen now I want you to see it in Hebrews 6 1 Hebrews chapter 6 verse 1. I want you to see here that we want to be churches that can lay the foundation and then keep building most churches uh if they get a foundation they don't go all the way on they don't keep building imagine if they were to laid this foundation and maybe just put up one wall what kind of what kind of building would this be it'd be useless right that's what a lot happens a lot to a lot of spiritual churches right spiritually speaking they might know Christ and they might know about the cross and the resurrection thank God for that we just passed you know the resurrection weekend praise God but they've got to keep building once the foundation is laid Hallelujah then they've got to keep building and the Bible tells us you know many of you just went through the foundation you repented of your sins and you're baptized in the name of Jesus Christ amen that's the foundation hallelujah thank God Amen remember in Acts chapter 2 they said men and brother what shall we do he said repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall receive the Holy Ghost and you shall receive the remission of sins amen oh that's the foundation church that's where you start you your foundation starts on being baptized being identified with Jesus Christ you're a part of the body of Jesus Christ but now the Bible said let us go on let us keep building thank God for the rock finder I'm sorry thank God for the right foundation but we must not stop we got to make sure the building is finished hallelujah amen hallelujah Hebrews 6 1. therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on to Perfection not laying the foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith I'm sorry not Lang again of dead works and a faith toward God imagine like I said if we were to if we would have laid the foundation here and put up one wall and then somebody you know just let time go on the wall would have knocked over the wind would have blew it over or the the foundation were to crack and Paul says you don't want that to happen you don't want to lay the foundation again you don't want to forget the uh the initial Promises of God you want to keep building on that praise God Amen you want to keep building and keep growing in your faith praise God you want to know Christ more Hallelujah you would like as the Bible said you want to grow in Grace and knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ amen each day is another opportunity to taste and see that the Lord is good Hallelujah like our brother Howard's got there in his house I like that oh taste and see that the Lord is good hallelujah how many babies sweeter than the honey and the honeycomb praise God oh Hallelujah each and every day it gets sweeter and sweeter as the days go by I just started crying driving down here by two and a half hour drive I was just crying think about how good Jesus has been to me praise God I just it's just like the Holy Spirit come right there in the car and I just start crying and think thank you Jesus you have saved arrested like me you're alive today you're risen he's alive hallelujah amen and he ever lives to make intercession for us hallelujah amen amen thank God now here we see the here are some of the foundational truths the what is the first one repentance from dead works well what is that that's baptism repent and be baptized that's the first one praise God that's the foundation and a faith toward God having faith toward God not unbelief toward God having faith in God almighty of the doctrine of baptisms there's the water baptism which you all obeyed by God's grace but now you must go on to the spirit baptism which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost where the Holy Ghost Falls in your soul just like it did in Acts chapter two praise God just like it did amen that was when the church had a birthday that was the birthday of the church amen Jesus said go up there and wait until you're endued with power from on high then and when the Holy Ghost found the Bible said they went out of the upper room and they were praising God they were glorifying God so much so that they said these people are filled with new wine and Peter said this is not new why this is what Joel prophesied amen he said I'll pour out my spirit in the last days amen and your sons and daughters will dream dreams and and see Visions praise God and this is the refreshing that comes from the presence of the Lord amen oh if you are the Holy Ghost fall on you to God and God's spirit will fall on you praise God and you'll be refreshed you'll have revived hope praise God you have a transformed mind you have a goal for the future you'll have hope for the future because Jesus Christ is anointing you he's filling your mind and thoughts hallelujah amen thank God Amen Hallelujah there's two kinds of baptisms there's the water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and there's the soul baptism where God's spirit comes to live in your soul verse two and of laying on of hands that's of course for uh pray for prayer for the sick and also for ordaining elders and of the resurrection of the Dead and of Eternal judgment and this we will do if God permits now see he says don't lay again the foundation in other words you've got to build the right foundation and then you've got to keep building or else the building is going to fall apart and then you got to come back and Lay It Again I don't know about you Brothers but I don't like wasting my time I like to do a job and I like to get it done amen the brother said I don't want I don't want to do something and it falls all apart again and if I can't do it I'm on the phone can somebody here do it for me praise God because I don't want to do it and mess it up I want somebody that would do it right praise God Amen and that's what Paul says I've laid the foundation he said but now each person you know has to receive Christ and and then Christ that that allow Christ to build the foundation build their character up into a real Christian character Hallelujah well thank you sir I appreciate that thank you for the heart very kind to you very hospitable my brother amen now uh we're not going to read these but brother Branham gives us this phrase he says we must have the Keystone of the Bible and the Keystone is the Cornerstone the Cornerstone of the Bible brother Adam said is Hebrews 13 8 and We Know It it's Jesus Christ is the same what yesterday today and forever that's the Keystone of the Bible and brother Ram gives us also Malachi chapter 3 verse 6 for I am the Lord thy God and I change not amen Amen brother Adam said God's word and his ways never change hallelujah amen so whatever God did with Paul's Ministry whatever God did with Peter's Ministry whatever God did with brother random's Ministry it's still the same today praise God amen hallelujah the gospel is still the same today because the Keystone is that God doesn't change his ways don't change that means church we have a great Foundation we are founded not on sinking sin our church and our lives are not going to fall away and we're not going to be moved by the storms of life but we are going to be able to handle the storms of life and we'll keep standing until Jesus comes amen although the culture collapses amen the culture is collapsing governments collapse churches collapse but not the body of Christ the body of Christ will be Overcomers and her testimony will stand Hallelujah the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against it amen amen Glory Hallelujah oh what a blessing I've been shouting and rejoicing in this for 23 years and the Gates of Hell have not prevailed hallelujah amen thank God Amen oh I know it's true praise God now Galatians 1 verse 6 if you got your Bibles there Galatians 1 verse 6. well we have dear sister Ruth could you read that uh sister Ruth whenever you get there no no rush no pressure Galatians 1 verse 6. and sister if you would uh could you read six seven eight and nine sister Ruth that'd be okay all right go in whenever you're ready March is not another but there be some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of Christ but though we are an angel from heaven preached any other gospel unto you then that which we appreciate to you let him be accursed and as we said before so say I now again if any man preach any other gospel unto you then that ye have received let him be accursed amen sister thank you praise God the next verse Paul says who am I trying to please God or man who do you want to please we want to please the Lord Jesus Christ amen thank you sister Paul said I don't care if an angel or somebody else or you myself if whoever comes to change the gospel that Jesus gave me they are cursed the Gospel of Jesus Christ cannot be changed we cannot add to it we cannot take away from it why because it's the foundation amen amen oh hallelujah praise God it's a curse to change it and so we never would and God is going to use these this New Testament of course the whole Bible but especially the New Testament God is going to use that as the Judgment standard right so let's go through that Romans 2 16. but Levi you want to read that Romans 2 16. nope the keynote of the entire Bible is God is unchanging we cannot change the gospel he gave to Paul because it is the Judgment standard and let's Levi whenever you're ready brother God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel thank you and the church says amen every man think about that every man we know every preacher we know will be judged by this gospel well whose interpretation of it it's not a denomination's interpretation of it it's the Holy Ghost interpretation of it amen hallelujah how do we know that through a prophet praise God through the preachers the true preachers of the Gospel praise God because the Bible said how beautiful are the feet of them who bring the Gospel of Truth Hallelujah of good news amen hallelujah in other words God before the people can receive the Gospel God has to anoint a man to go and then preach the gospel praise God so it all goes back to God God has a message he anoints a man he gives the man the message and then the man goes to preach the message and then God's got people there that receive it praise God those smaller number they're not they're not small in number really because the angel of God are with God's people praise God oh amen hallelujah thank God Amen Church there's angels all around this room here as we speak there's Guardian Angels the Bible said their Angels always do behold the face of My Father which is in heaven and the Bible says the angel of the Lord and camps around all those that fear the Lord amen oh my God if I get a little sleep in the car guess what the angel wakes me up praise God so I don't get a car accident Hallelujah or if the other person's swerving towards me and I'm like oh God have mercy the angel allows that person to correct themselves so I don't get the car accident I've got angels watching over me praise God they're protecting us praise God they keep us lest we fall and dash our foot against the stone God's promise is true God has guarded angels watching over us thank God for his grace that's how much he loves you praise God Amen hey man Hallelujah we're not going to read all these but I'm just going to like a machine gun fire him out there praise God revelation 22 18-19 you don't have to turn there but the Bible says any man that adds to God's word plagues will be added to him any man that takes away from God's word his name will be taken out of the Book of Life right proverbs 30 verses 5 and 6 the Bible said add thou now unto God's words lest that lest he reprove thee and thou be found a liar God's gonna call a lot of people Liars on the day of judgment because they added to the Bible that's what the Bible says you must not add to it actually adding to the Bible is called legalism that's what that is legalism is adding a requirement that you don't find in the Bible right the other that's one extreme The Other Extreme is lasciviousness which is lawlessness which means there's no Commandments you can do whatever you want you're going to be saved and then the other side is legalism you got to do this and this and this to be safe there's one thing you must do to be saved you must repent and be baptized amen You Must Believe praise God amen amen Jesus does all the saving you got to repent of your sins and be saved praise God and we have to find now we have to find as we'll see here now we have to find the middle of the road because we cannot be legalists but we cannot be lasciviousness either we can't be Lawless but we can't have man's law we got to have God's law praise God amen hallelujah and then Jude 1 verse 3 says You must earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints praise God Amen that's why uh that's why why I sound like I'm so serious or so uh maybe loud or something like that I'm fighting right we're we're contending if I was gonna you know if I was gonna fight anybody I wouldn't want to be like all sad and scared I'd have to I have to call it my courage I have to bring up my courage if he's bigger than me I gotta be real courageous yeah you can't be a coward and with the the Bible said God does not give us a spirit of fear but a power love and a sound mind Hallelujah amen you can't be afraid of the devil I've came back down to the devil we gotta speak God's word amen Hallelujah now some Churches battle legalism especially the galatian church and the colossian church so let's go there Galatians 3 1. now as I've talked with brother Irvin and John Levi you know I realize you know some of your background is having to overcome legalisms that's why I wanted to bring this thought out I thought it would be a help to you by God's grace I came out of the other extreme like uh in the Pentecostal church I was raised is basically just do whatever he wants as long as you come to church and speak in tongues you're good you could you could live however you want really you could live however you want could be married as many times you want as long as you come to church and speak in tongues you're all right you're a good member of the church but we don't find that in God's Bible praise God Hallelujah you don't find that in the word of God I want my life to line up with God's word praise God not with a church manual I want my life to line up with God's holy Bible praise God amen Galatians 3 verse 1. Galatians 3 yeah we're already in Galatians 1 now go to Galatians 3 verse one now it says o foolish Galatians who have Bewitched you that ye should not obey the truth before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth crucified among you this only would I learn of you receive ye the Spirit by The Works of the law or by the hearing of faith are ye so foolish having begun the spirit are you now made perfect by the flesh have you suffered so many things in vain if if it be yet in vain he therefore that ministereth to you the spirit and worketh miracles among you do it that he by The Works of the law or by the hearing of faith now just to summarize this is about people in the galatian church trying to bring circumcision back in they were telling these these Believers if you don't get circumcised you're not saved right if you ever read this book how many read this book before relations okay yeah you read it right in there it was legal is trying to they already been set free from from having to obey everything in the law but preachers had slipped in and tried to pervert the gospel well no you actually have to go back and do this now Paul will say later in the book he says circumcision doesn't Prevail you anything it doesn't help you it doesn't hurt you right it's not it's not a requirement anymore but some people were starting to receive the legalism back in and so Paul came to say don't let legalism come in be led by the Holy Spirit praise God Hallelujah now only you know as a church I don't know I haven't talked to these brothers extensively only you know the legalistic things that you had to come out of and you must contend not to let them come back in praise God now if you can find the Bible we'll talk about it if it's in the Bible it's rightly divided well then yes we got to obey that because the Bible says if you love me keep my commands Jesus said if you love me keep my commands praise God Hallelujah so they stood they were in a battle against legalism coming back and they got called out of legalism by Christ they came out but then they went back in it's kind of like Israel when they come out of Egypt and they want to go back to Egypt kind of like that they wanted to go back in bondage but church we should never want to go back into bondage to legalism or things of the world let's enjoy Freedom Hallelujah let's grow in Freedom let's enjoy God's blessings hallelujah amen you gotta you got the right to raise your hands you got the right to shock you got the right to dance and praise God Amen you got the right because the Bible gives you that right amen amen you got it right sisters have the right to give a word of Prophecy Brothers have a right to give a word of interpretation that's in the Bible praise God the Bible is our absolute praise God amen hallelujah we're gonna get down to some of these things here by God's grace now go to chapter five amen this is glorious oh don't you love the Bible praise God it's my love letter from Jesus brother Irvin but if I said this is a love letter from Jesus Oh you love me so much thank you Lord hallelujah ah you want to feel loved just read your Bible Hallelujah read your Bible it's God's love letter to you chapter 5 verse one now he goes through this all this uh teaching on the law versus Grace in chapter 5 verse 1. stand past therefore in the Liberty wherewith Christ has made us free and be not entangled again with the yoga bondage so they came out of legalism and Paul's saying stand with Christ don't go back into legalism praise God Amen and look at verse two here's where he says it behold I Paul say unto you that if you be circumcised Christ your profit you nothing now think about that those false preachers were really persuasive they were saying well if Abraham was circumcised shouldn't you be circumcised aren't you a Seed of Abraham you see how persuasive they were what doesn't Genesis 17 say that if you're not circumcised you're not part of the Covenant see how see how deceptive and persuasive they are but Paul had to teach him you got to stand on the gospel you're not part of the Old Testament you're part of the New Covenant praise God you've got a better Covenant with better promises amen and our covenant is based upon the blood of the Messiah the blood of Jesus Christ hallelujah amen thank God now go to Colossians chapter 2 verse 12. brother Daniel if you can read that brother whenever you get it Colossians 2 verse 12. here's another now Paul had to deal with also legalism in the church in colossi and I just got done preaching on this whole book at home I just finished it up Wednesday night by God's grace beautiful book so I preached through Galatians Ephesians Philippians now Colossians now I'm going to go over to Romans and preach that whole book to the church praise God because when brother Rams when brother random went over beyond the curtain of time he got a preview of Heaven brother Ryan went beyond the curtain of time they said my precious brother they said brother Brandon if you had not went to preach we wouldn't be here and then uh brother man told the voice he said I just preached what Paul preached amen you want to get to heaven Just Praise what Paul preached amen hallelujah praise God Amen you want to get there to that sweep by and by we sing about praise God if you want that starry crowd believe what Paul said Hallelujah keep the word of God that Paul said amen and brother said that the millions screamed out we're resting on that resting on what that brother Adam preached the same thing Paul preached amen because anybody that preaches different is cursed but anybody that preaches the same is blessed hallelujah amen amen it's exactly right that's the word of God Amen all right Colossians 2 12. brother Daniel can you read uh 12 uh 12 13-14 brother buried with him in baptism we're in also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God who has raised him from the dead yes and you being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh have you quickened together with him having forgiven you all trespasses plotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us which was contrary to us and took it out of the way nailing it to the throne thank you brother praise God everybody catch verse 13 I was hoping to hear amen from somewhere maybe look for a tear out there he's forgiven you all trespasses and the church said amen I love this verse amen in other words when Jesus died God took God took big long list right brother John and Jesse sins that's me really that's much longer [Laughter] right and then each one of us the Bible said God took all the handwriting against us and nailed it to Jesus's cross amen amen amen and then Jesus paid for all those sins and you're forgiven all the sins because he paid the price for all your list of sins amen you are completely forgiven you're washing the blood you're a child of God there's a place for you in heaven Hallelujah you will have eternal life amen because Jesus Christ died to forgive you all your trespasses Hallelujah amen now somebody tell me that's not the Bible thank God Amen that's the Bible praise God and when he rose in verse 15 he spoiled principalities and Powers he made a show of them openly triumphing over them in it no demon could keep Jesus down how did your pilate couldn't keep him down Heron couldn't keep him down no Satan couldn't keep him down he triumphed brother Levi he's the mighty conqueror amen thank God Amen and the Bible said he rose for your justification that means declared you righteous as you wish to be amen how righteous do you wish to be 50 righteous brother that's it who said 100 God bless you says what's your name again sister you both said it amen hallelujah praise God what do I want to be 90 righteous or I want to be a hundred percent righteous that's what justification is when he rose from the grave declaring I'm Justified all those who believed in me I'm forgiving all their sins I paid for all their sins and now they get they get my righteousness amen Hallelujah that's where the day of atonement was in the Old Testament Aaron would confess all the sins on the on the on the goat you confess I confess my sins on the go of this whole year all of Israel's sins and all the sins would go on the go the goat would die and then all Israel was forgiven well brother Adam said Jesus was both goats Jesus was the goat that all your sins were confessed over it died the blood was the blood cleaned out the whole church hallelujah praise God and then Jesus was The Goat Who took all your sins out into the Wilderness never to be seen again Hallelujah they'll never the my sins will never be seen again Jesus Paid for him the Bible said God throws them in the sea of forgetfulness praise God Amen Hallelujah praise God amen thank you that's what God does with our sins he pays the price for him and then he sends him out in the wilderness never to be heard of again Hallelujah thank God verse 12. well I'm sorry verse 13 why I'm going to hang that on your fridge having forgiven you all trespasses he didn't say some he forgave you all amen a Double L program says a Double L all your trespasses he forgives you and when Satan's out brings up all those lies brother Daniel you can take him right back here well devil I don't care what you say I care what the Bible says Jesus said you're a liar so I'm not going to believe you I'm going to believe Colossians 2. verse 13 praise God thank God amen amen how it makes you feel join unspeakable full of Glory sometimes my goodness thank God amen amen for Jesus Christ thank God for Jesus Christ oh I haven't got to where I was trying to go my goodness verse 16. now here's where we see Liberty Liberty and not legalism verse 16 let no man therefore judge you in what you eat your Meats or in your drink or in respect of a holy day like some people are on the message you know Easter is the most important day for them other people maybe it's good Friday some people uh it might be Christmas but the Bible says don't let anybody judge you whatever days are really special to you let them be special to you why because verse 17 which are a shadow of things to come but the body is Christ in other words we're not legalism like this day and that day and this day and those you got to eat this and drink this and we're not legalists like that because all those things in the Old Testament were Shadows of Jesus Christ the day of atonement was a shadow that that he says would go to the cross and pay for all of our sins Hallelujah thank God Hallelujah all right so see what the blood of Jesus does it forgives us all of our trespasses and then we have Liberty as Christians to maybe have this meat and that drink and then this day is a very holy day to me we have the liberty and he said don't let anybody judge you because all these things are shadows the real thing is Jesus Christ amen all right Hallelujah [Music] now we're not legalists but we do we are under a law of the Holy Spirit so go to Romans 8 verse 1. we're not under the law of the Old Testament we are under the law of the spirit yet totally forgiven Romans 8 1. right any Kingdom without a law would be awful wouldn't it think if there was no laws and somebody somebody murdered or somebody stole and there was no law to enforce it 'd be awful so we come into Christ we're forgiven all of our sins but now we operate under the law of the Holy Spirit it's it's no doubt church it's the law of Grace it's law of Grace but God also has to teach us his ways Hallelujah Romans 8 1 and 2. Romans eight one and two really like you read Romans eight one and two brother there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death amen praise God hallelujah there's no condemnation to us if we're in Christ don't let the devil condemn you because you got the Bible the Bible says there's no condemnation to me Hallelujah I'm forgiven praise God I'm going to heaven praise God I'm going to see Jesus there my name's on the road in heaven I'm not under I'm not going to live under condemnation now yes I have a conviction I have conviction so when I've done wrong I'll repent of it but I don't but God is Not condemning me I have no wrath there's no wrath God has on me I'm not in war against God I have peace with God hallelujah that's Romans 5 1 we don't have time to read it but the Bible says we have therefore we now have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ that's what we need today peace with God hallelujah and notice that church you're under the law of the spirit in other words when you obey God God's going to bless you when you disobey God purposely he's going to give you a spanking like you give a child how we know that's in the Bible amen go to Hebrews Hebrews 12. Hebrews 12 6. God loves you I just told you God loves you there's no condemnation all your sins are forgiven that's true but when we make mistakes God's a good parent too he's not going to let us get away with things we shouldn't we shouldn't do just like you would elect like brother always use that example if your child was running out in the street and it's a busy highway brother says you want to stand there and say oh that's good John here little Sarah that just have fun out there there's all those uh 13 or 12 wheelers trucks driving by 60 miles per hour yeah Johnny just have a little trouble brother said if you really love that child you'll go out there and get him off the road Johnny you come here Johnny right if you really love them another way run Ram explained it if a man's in a in a canoe and he's going toward a waterfall and doesn't know it if you're loving you'll warn him love is not oh I hope you have a good time sorry about what's going to happen but I hope you're having a good time but remember said if you have love you'll cry out turn around you're going towards a cataract turn away go against the law of sin and death and follow the law of Despair praise God Amen amen hallelujah so we're totally forgiven but then God's teaching us with his law to obey God to please God and then God will bless us just like you'll bless your children if they obey you right now Hebrews 12 6 brother Irvin would you read that brother amen you should read this whole chapter after church if you've got time if God loves you he's going to spank you like a child now I know none of us would like to think about getting spanked that's actually what the Bible says a few verses down no it doesn't seem joyful for the present to get spanked but that's what that Scourge means to spank if he loves you he's got to correct you and say you shouldn't say that you shouldn't have done that you you what you went you disobeyed the voice of the Holy Spirit there now you need to repent of that and you need to obey the father's voice so we're not we're not preaching lasciviousness like I was Raising oh it's okay divorce and remarry it's okay to watch filthy movies and and cuss and do dirty things no no and but we're not legalists either creating man-made ideas that man-made laws we're not dead either we're right down the middle of the road as the Bible says we're walking up the Highway of Holiness amen ah Isaiah chapter 28 I believe no Isaiah 35 says we are on the road or the way of Holiness we're on a highway we're walking up the King's Highway praise God oh my God amen so God's love is Parental love he loves you like a parent and if I love my kids I gotta get out my little bamboo stick and I gotta hit him on the back of there I usually hit him on the back of their calf right here I don't spank their bombs anymore because I don't want to hurt their back you know so I got a little bamboo stick and I said if you don't it's been a while since I've had to do it because my wife does a great job for uh does a great job rebuking them herself foreign if you don't do that I'm getting out the bamboo stick if you don't listen and you don't mind me I'm getting off the bamboo stick I'm not doing that because I'm mean I'm doing it because it's for their own good amen and God is gonna like a parent he's gonna correct you sometimes he has to give us little spankings right we learn from that and that's proof that he loves us amen the the proof that he loves me is that he won't let me live like a denominational Christian the proof that he loves me is that he won't let me live like a sinner he loves me too much Hallelujah he died he suffered he bled he loved me so much he so he corrects me he said you got to be a proper child you're going to be a real child of mine amen hallelujah and so I'm going to train you up I'm going to correct you when you need it I'm going to build you up in the faith so you can act just like me amen hallelujah he wants us to be a chip off the old blood praise God he wants to be just like him the Bible said in Romans 8 that we must be conformed to the image of his dear son praise God Amen amen he wants you to have Christ side character he wants you to live just like Christ a life of power a life of humility but a life of obedience amen to the word of God I'm getting some I like all those amens that doesn't scare me that actually helps me amen that's what Brother Anderson they said Abraham how can you preach with all those shouts don't it make you nervous Well ma'am said I get nervous if they don't shout that's right one guy said when when those people scream and shout oh you said a cold chill goes up my my spine and brother Brown said a cold chill goes up my spine if they don't scream and shout hallelujah thank God see God's people have to believe his word amen amen if you're a child of God you'll agree with God Amen if you love God you'll say Amen to your daddy praise God Amen you'll say praise the Lord heavenly father thank you for your word thank you for correcting me thank you for teaching me praise God thank you for every blessing I'm a Child of God amen so we live by the law of the spirit now go to John 5 24. Sister Miriam can you read that whenever you get it John 5 24. so I'm starting to memorize a few names I can memorize a few at a time if I don't have wherever his name memorized so forgive me when everybody sister John 5 24. life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from Death unto life oh the church said amen how many believe in Jesus you have already passed from you are not going to death you are on your way to life amen you will not come into condemnation there's no way for you to be condemned because Jesus Took the condemnation for you hallelujah amen amen thank God there's no condemnation God doesn't have a he's not gonna we went up there I can't wait to send Jesse to hell that's not there's no condemnation he can't wait for you to get to heaven praise God Amen that's what the Bible says program uses verse over and over to give the people confidence in their walk with God this is how you know you're saved you pass from Death unto life and you shall not come into condemnation you will not go to hell because Jesus said if you believe in me you've already passed from it amen you know in your own life look back how many years ago whatever used to be a sinner look back when you're a sinner and now look where you are today look where you're standing now you're standing on a different location you're you're in a new territory you're living for Jesus Christ your life is totally different now you're walking by faith and not by sides Hallelujah Hallelujah amen what a blessing Hallelujah like I love my brother Irvin told me last time he's he was almost got tears in his eyes he said he said to think that that God at 59 years old wouldn't let me keep going in all the my previous life that I used to live because he saw so many people they just keep going in the same direction and they never change but God had mercy on our precious brother amen amen praise God hallelujah just like he had mercy on me at 20 years or 19 years old to get saved amen amen he wouldn't let me walk in that path too much longer he he brought us he took us out of the old path and he let us walk on the New Path Hallelujah um oh thank God for the law of the Holy Spirit I'm going to read this one uh Ephesians 4 30 grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you're sealed to the day of redemption the word greed means to offend church when we sin we offend God but it's not like he's going to send us to hell we just offend him how many operation how many ever been offended before you have to raise your hand but almost on a daily basis I guess yes well are you able to overcome that and forgive yes yes if not today's the day to do it that that's what the Bible says that's what your sin is like to God it just offends him but then when you confess your sins what's the Bible say in first John chapter one he's faithful and just to forgive you what all your iniquities all your trespasses and now you have fellowship with one another you walk in the lie as he's in the light amen and the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all there it is again a Double L all unrighteousness Hallelujah amen he cleanses us from every sin every block and we look down at our spiritual garments and there's no blots on it it's completely white it's white as snow the blood of Jesus Christ makes us white as snow praise God oh Hallelujah the law of God is also seen in Galatians chapter 6. verse 7 be not deceived God is Not mocked for whatsoever man soweth that shall he reap for he that soweth to his flesh shall the flesh reap corruption but he that sowed to the spirit shall the spirit reap life Everlasting now can everybody see that we're saved by grace no more condemnation but not like a father God does have to spank us sometimes like brother Irvin read as a father loves his sons he's got a chasten his sons and daughters but he's not he's not eternally upset with you you're not on the naughty list amen you're on the last book of life list oh thank God thank God Amen we offend God but then God is faithful to forgive us that is the anointing comes right back on us praise God the back is the anointing that caused us to repent amen praise God Amen now I want to start getting this too as God has brought this church on illegalism God's brought you out to make you free but then God does establish order for the church for the churches now it's easily seen in First Corinthians 14 with the gifts of the Spirit so 1433 First Corinthians 14 33 brother Ari are you going to turn there brother because I'd like to have you read that would that be okay brother First Corinthians 14 33. 14 33 Brother Ali whenever you're ready for God Is Not the Only person [Music] as in our churches of the same amen now brother go down and read verse 40. brother are they would you read verse 40. all things be done easily and in order amen now this is speaking of gifts of the holy spirit I've been in a like I was raised in churches where there was tongues interpretation every every service almost and so Paul's just laying out this is the order of how to do tongues interpretation at the most three now I've been in Services where there were seven or eight or nine or more and they went against the Bible see how they went against the Bible but you know I don't know God God will be the judge of that you know we shouldn't go outside the Bible of course but I just want you to see God does not author confusion God likes things done decently and in order so there could be an order of the Holy Spirit without being legalism now I want to get down to just a regular church service I want to just share how brother Ram taught a regular church service should be should be ran and he uses a type to to teach a type from the Old Testament now before I say this this church is Sovereign of itself you can run your services in any order you want my brother Brandon found this order in Joshua chapter 6. so if you want let's go to Joshua chapter 6. brother random saw a spiritual type here or foreshadowing uh this is God's order when the Ark of the Covenant the prince of God would go forth into battle and so brother Adam took the order of the Ark of the Covenant the Old Testament and he brought that spiritual order to a church service okay so this is just a suggestion and there's nothing wrong with order like I was telling our church on Wednesday night isn't it amazing every service we start with prayer silent prayer and then we sing songs and then we pray then we sing some more songs that we preach and then we close with prayer and songs and the Holy Ghost Falls almost every service amen God is not against order if it's done with holiness [Music] praise God Amen never fails to amaze me how God's spirit if we can just humble ourselves and we really we just got to confess our sins it really doesn't matter the order of the service if we just confess our sins God's fear is going to be there praise God because he promised brother Daniel whoever two or three be gathered in my name there I am in the midst of them praise God that's a Divine promise that's a thus say at the Bible promise so church if we believe if we're trusting in Jesus he is here today praise God amen Joshua 6 verse 6. bro John would you read that brother would you read six seven eight nine brother go ahead whenever you're ready and Joshua the son of none called the priests sit unto them take up the art of the Covenant and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of Ram's horns before the Ark of the Lord and he said unto the people pass on and Compass the city and let them let him that his arm pass on before the Ark of the Lord yeah give me eight nine yes sir and it came to pass when Joshua had spoken unto the people seven priests burying the seven trumpets of the Rams horns passed on before the Lord and Blues With The Trumpets and the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord followed them and the armed men went before the priest that blew with the trumpets and the rear reward came after the art the priests going on and blowing with the trumpets amen thank you brother John uh do you notice the order here the Bible said in verse 7 the our men pass on before the ark okay so you got the armed men with the swords then you got the trumpeters then you got the ark okay so brother I am taught the armed guards he said the armed men with the swords is what's the sword the sword of the spirit in the New Testament and where do we hear about that in Ephesians chapter six you put on the whole armor of God and then you got the sword of the spirit and then what did you say right after that he said praying for all men the Bible says so that's why brother said before service people should come into the service prayerfully so before service we should pray then what comes next the horns the trumpet the music brother Rams says that's music now this is what brother Ram said it wasn't thus saith the Lord like everybody had to do it but every church has its own liberty brother Adam just wanted to find something scriptural he could a a pattern he could find from the Bible to base his services on so we'd have prayer first and brother Adam said if you when a preacher walks into a congregation that's praying for God to speak he said they are guaranteed to hear from Heaven praise God you want to hear from Heaven pray before the servant ask God speak to me God speak to us let the Holy Ghost speak to us God will speak Hallelujah you've seen it remember when you guys anointed the chairs that's the same thing praying before service right pray pray let the armed guards go first sisters you got you got the armor of God too God hears your prayers just as much as mine Hallelujah is that right absolutely that's right so the prayer warriors go first we should all be prayer warriors gone and then bring up these musicians bring up the singers like Daniel like our brother Howard there we go I'm gonna get your guys names here I'm gonna get eventually takes repetition for me and then after the ark comes the word I'm sorry after the horns comes the word the prince of God that's what the ark was that's where God lived and God lives in his word and the church said amen so we have prayer singing preaching hallelujah amen and each one prepares for the next one prayer prepares us to sing and singing gives us courage now to hear the word and then let's go take that word praise God let's believe that word amen so that's the order that brother random gives for a service brother Irvin and brother John just so you can see now if you want the quotes I can give the quotes after service now go to Ephesians chapter 4 verse 8. like I said I'm gonna lay down some foundational truths here this this morning all right I'm not even gonna pay attention to the clock amen I can see you again I don't look at my watch I'm taking off my Watson I'm not gonna pay attention to that that uh the brother man calls it a busy body I'm not gonna pay attention to that busy body right there yeah I'm gonna lay down some foundations and you all pray about it and God's Gonna lead you guys by the Holy Ghost amen because that's what Paul said Paul said we started churches he said I ordain Elders in every church and then I left them off and then he had to leave and go start other churches and they had to stand there in the grace of God Hallelujah God's helped me start two churches already so I felt interesting God brings me in here right when you guys are starting a church to help you start the church maybe if you guys feel that I can help you out with that like I told brother brother Irvin I said I'm a school teacher I go on vacation uh May 26 is my last day of work I said after that I got all summer off two and a half months I can appreciate you every Thursday night if you want me to come preach to you we'll teach you the gospel I'll teach you the the bible message God gave brother random I'll laid out for you all summer if you want by God's grace amen we'll see we'll see just pray about it I don't want to pressure anybody but I have helped start two churches by God's grace and one I'm still pastored and we're going on Good by God's grace is that right Akron Saints hoping they can say Amen we love the church my eyes it's just uh it's a it's a it's a a bundle of Love brother man says it's a bundle of love the Bible said the love of God is the bond of perfectness the love of God holds Us Together Like Glue amen amen no so now you got your you got the law of the Holy Spirit we're not legalism now you know where program got the order of services and here next is the fivefold ministry Ephesians 4 8. I'm gonna turn there brother Howard you got that brother you got it on your phone okay can you read uh four so read eight nine and ten brother wherefore he says captivity captured and gave gifts and demand now that he ascended what is it that he also descended first into the lower parts of the Earth he that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all Heavens that he might fill all things amen now see this after Jesus Resurrected he took all the Old Testament Saints with him the Bible said when he resurrected the many of the graves were opened and then on that 40th day after the resurrection he took all of them up to heaven but then he didn't stop there brother Irvin he sent down gifts of the Holy Ghost amen amen Amen to men so men would be Anointed with the same spirit that was on Jesus amen amen amen and what are those five gifts the Bible says I'm right here in verse 11. let's read it together ready one two three and he gave some Apostles some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers so Jesus conquered death he rose up sound of the throne he said what can I give my church I'll give him five preaching gifts and what do these five preaching gifts gonna do in verse 12. for the perfecting of the Saints oh church if you can catch a revelation of it preaching is the key Holy Ghost anointed preaching is the key to your Perfection your completeness your maturity the power is in the preaching of God's word hallelujah that's exactly right praise God in other words Jesus in heaven is thinking the best thing I can give the Saints in Junction City is five-fold preachers that's going to help the sisters the most that's going to help the brothers the most that's going to help these little children the most if they get real called men of God preaching by the Holy Ghost that's going to make them perfect that's going to help them mature and be real Christians praise God oh Hallelujah and Paul said we'll be judged by this Allelujah amen will be judged by this real preachers who are anointed of the same holy spirit that was on Jesus the Bible said they're going to perfect the Saints for the work of the ministry the gifts are going to do the work of the ministry praying for the sick right baptizing all the work of the ministry for the edifying that means the strengthening of the body of Christ until when brother Jesse until 2024 well no until verse 13 we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ so God's going to use these five preaching gifts until Jesus returns because the church will not be perfect until they all got the Holy Ghost and then they're going up in the Rapture brother praise God every son and daughter that's got the Holy Ghost when they're filled with the Holy Ghost then Jesus say ah now I can snatch my wife away come here honey it's time for the wedding ceremony praise God let's go again let's go get ready for the marriage supper it's time for the wedding celebration the wedding supper and then we could have a thousand year honeymoon in the Millennium praise God Amen oh this whole story of Earth history is a wedding and it's your wedding with Jesus Christ you're the one and Jesus is the bridegroom amen oh these last two thousand years Jesus has been getting a wife ready for his wedding Hallelujah and here we are in the last Church age and he's getting a wife ready in this last Church age and he chose you oh somebody should have shouted Amen on that I'm sorry brother I picked that up for another preacher I should probably stop doing that sometimes I'll pound on the out there I got so much uh Zeo I don't know sometimes I just try to get it out but he chose you to be his wife he chose you to be the obedient wife the Bride of Jesus Christ amen amen he's gonna get you ready by five preaching gifts now Apostles are missionaries there are people that go to places where there's no message churches no Bible churches and they make converse with major signs wonders and miracles and then they move on and start another prophets are like brother Brandon where you foretell the future in the name of the Lord and you reveal the secrets according to Amos 3 verse 7. like he revealed the Seven Seals through Jesus uh evangelists are preachers that travel from church to church and the uh they stir that they serve churches up and they just go like in a cycle a Circa that's the word circuit right like the circuit Rider Preacher Brother I talked about the Circa writer preacher used to ride the horse he just go from church to church preaching Revival services around and around and around the next is the pastor that's what I am I'm a shepherd of one flock now look God's using me though in a different move right here by God's grace and that's okay preachers can have more than one gift Paul said I was a teacher of the Gentiles we all know he was a prophet he prophesied of the rapture he said a teacher of the Gentiles he was the Apostle Paul he was a missionary you could have more than one gift I believe brother random had all five gifts and at different times of his life God would use those gifts all right amen and the last one is teacher a teacher is kind of like an evangelist except he goes out in the deeper teachings of God real deep things wow I never thought about like that I got a better understanding of baptism I never had before because the teacher took me deeper gave me more instruction on the word of God right amen like a teacher would teach our sisters how to be even more holy unto God and our brothers to be even better leaders unto God teaching would do that it'll take you deeper in your walk with God it's a different gift than a pastor it's a different gift than an evangelist and brother Harley Jesus said these five are going to make us ready they're going to bring us into a real Unity so we're ready for Jesus coming [Music] until we all come into Unity the faith praise God as a pastor I've seen teachers come in to our church I've seen a man just we only had one or two Apostles over the years um we've never had any Prophets because there's not many out there God determines the gifts but I've seen God use these gifts and keep our church on fire gives us Revival speaks to our hearts encourages us uh Supernatural gifts and healings and miracles and all these things God uses all these to perfect our faith to build our faith up and to prepare us for Jesus is coming amen that's right oh that's right okay now what do they also do they make you mature so you're not a baby Christian look at verse 14. that we henceforth be no more children toss to and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine see that's what these these churches go through they go from this Doctrine to that Doctrine this false Doctrine to that but God wants somebody who stands right there in the middle they know the truth they can't be swayed by any lies from Satan they know thus saith the Lord they know the Bible and they stand on the Bible praise God amen that's right that's right see the right preachers bring you to a real maturity in the faith and you know the Bible Hallelujah like brother Adam said I want to know the author but I also want to know his book really well too some people know his book well but they don't know the author I want to know both praise God I just want to have it memorized but memorize memorize I know this I only know the voice of the Holy Spirit too praise God ah amen I want to know both I want to know Christ and his power his resurrection and his sufferings I would know Jesus all the way praise God now go to Romans 10 13 I was quoting this one earlier brother Urban lunch read this one for us Romans 10 13 Saints foreign I've always been a fireball preacher like this I can't help it I came out of the world and when I found this message my La I I was instantly on fire praise God I just couldn't I just I live it eat it breathe it sleep it teach it amen it has transformed my life praise God all I saw was religion and emotion and and uh the Pentecostal domination I thank God for it thank God it was there but they didn't have all the truth I always knew something was missing but when I heard Serpentine when I heard uh trying to go to service when I heard God as one person oh my soul lit a fire praise God that's right because every single one of them pointed me back to the Bible that's what the domination could not do you can't point to where the Bible said everybody speaks in tongues in fact the Bible says do all speak with tongues no they can't point you to the Bible but with our faith brother Graham said we can always point to the Bible praise God that's how we know it's right Hallelujah I like my brother Madison God is so great he could do things outside the Bible God good he said but he won't because he wants to keep his word to us praise God Amen he wasn't he's gonna he's gonna keep referencing that love letter he gave us praise God he's not going to save us he's not going to betray us he's not going to change anything I am the Lord thy God they changed that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and we can know Jesus Christ today praise God Amen amen amen hallelujah Romans 10 13 brother can you read 13 14 and 15. who's ever so called upon the name whom they have not believed and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without a creature and how shall they preach except they be sinned as it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring Glad Tidings up good things amen let's all say amen amen so before anybody can get saved God has to First well I'm going to choose a man second I'm gonna anoint that man I'm gonna give that man a message third I'm gonna send that man and then that man comes to you and he preaches God's word and you say Amen I'm calling on Jesus and now you've receive Christ praise God that's right hey man that's what the Bible says so now we know the order of services and now we know who needs a preach in these Services anointed men of God need to preach in these services the five-fold ministry there's got to be teachers there's got to be pastors I've answers now the pastor does most of the preaching because he's a shepherd right the pastor does most of the preaching like I'll preach almost every service except maybe one or two a month I'm preaching every Wednesday night twice on Sunday but maybe I get one weekend off a month some people preach more than that but I need to have a break amen I've learned I'm gonna if I yell like this for all those times I'm gonna have no voice that's my own fault but God's not making me do that I'm I gotta program says sometimes your Zeal eats up your wisdom sometimes my Zeal he's up my wisdom you know I'm just being honest but that's what I like I like to take at least one weekend off a month where I can just sit there and say Amen Pete teacher amen evangelist amen Apostle whatever it is that's right and so many times God gives me exactly what I need him I'm struggling and whatever I'm going through battles like brother Danny we all go through battles and then God will bring a word it's just exactly what I need and I can go up to the Altar and repent and rejoice or I can get my dance back or whatever it is amen because God knows what his children need praise God Amen so God's a god anoints him man gives him the message and said go preach to the Saints in Junction City Hallelujah he anoints a man say go preach to the Saints in accord go feed my Lambs the food of God hallelujah Hallelujah go give them their meat in due season go lead them beside Still Waters Hallelujah go leave them behind beside Green Pastures you God says I'm gonna anoint that man and he's going to restore your soul hallelujah thank God Amen sometimes our souls come in here we're so discouraged how can I make it and then a sermon will come and it'll preach it'll build up your soul you say no I can make it by God's grace Hallelujah that's what the fivefold Ministries to do Jesus said until we all come in the union of the faith well we're not all unified yet so we still need the bipole ministry but you know what brother Irving brother John I know you guys are preachers the the greatest attack right now Satan's using is against the fivefold ministry amen that's right through brother randoms family members they're saying they're they're saying brother Branham should preach first before everybody else he's dead he's dead and they're saying brother Adam should be first and then preachers second or just preachers not preach at all I'm sorry that's an antichrist spirit because of what the Bible says right here for the last two thousand years God has had a church and he's never let dead men lead the church amen he's always had living men service year after year preach after preacher he lives he preaches he goes out the scene and dies God raises up another preacher praise God but now with technology they think they can change the Bible Ministry I'm sorry keep reading the Bible God never changes the fivefold ministry and brother bear said don't you change one thing about the Evangelistic Services he said Brothers keep preaching as hard as you can I'm right behind you praise God oh here he'd be right behind me praise God right thank God Amen you want to be saying sit down and press play and Obey but Ray would not be saying that because he never said that when he was on Earth amen that's right amen we respect brother Ram everything he did everything he taught us but it's just like Paul just like any other preacher the word that they preach we believe but now it's our turn to preach amen it's our turn to believe it's our turn to trust God Amen it's our turn to call upon God hallelujah that's right we listen to brother Branham we we see the how the Holy Spirit leads us and we preach the word of God that God gives us you can even listen to brother Neville he was the pastor there Brown Tabernacle while brother man was there you can listen to him you can read uh Charles virgins sermons you can read Jonathan Edward's sermons and whatever's right out of there you can preach it if it's from the Bible amen hallelujah just so you know one of the greatest attacks now is on the fivefold ministry they're trying to pull down the fivefold ministry and exalt brother Brandon up like he's the only one we need I'm sorry the Bible said there's five gifts that we need not one and I challenge that Spirit of antichrist I challenge that Spirit show me where the Bible ever changed it show me where brother Branham ever changed it they cannot show me that that's right Hallelujah so that's why that's why preached that so hard because Satan he if he can just get you off on one word then the Bible says like leaven sisters what do you do when you put leaven in the meal what does it do it spreads through the whole rest of the meal if he can get one sin in the church it just comes back to legalism right it comes back something's wrong in the church the churches Bewitched something's wrong a lie has come into the church but the Bible said you gotta Purge out the old leaven you gotta clean out the old leaven get the sin out of church all churches sin sometimes always got to clean up sometimes we all need a good cleaning out sometimes but God promise when you get the sin out he said you're like a new lump you're like a new church in other words you're in Revival the Holy Ghost will pour out his blessings again amen no church is perfect amen you're gonna go through Happy Times hopefully you're in happy time now because y'all are done got baptized but there was going to come hard times you really have to stick together right exactly right and that's the proof you have Jesus because Jesus said if you love he said he said greater love than no man has this then a man lays down his life for his friends right Jesus said that and she said also about love he said the way you know there are my followers is because they have love one for another we've had people come in from other churches from around the world some brothers from Africa and we're just a small tiny Church leave I'm sorry Levi knows that early Barbara Anna we're just a real tiny Church but we've had people brother Levi from around the world come in we've had people from other churches that have 300 400 people come in and say wow we feel the love of Jesus Christ in this church and we don't feel it at our mega church even the message so what's the most important thing a big building and big numbers the most important thing is a big love amen and thank God we got it it's G it's Jesus Christ amen he is the love of God Amen so if you give me a choice do I want a big church with lots of money big buildings lots of members without the love of God or would I rather have a small church with the love of God I'll take the love of God every time amen that's right because Jesus said this is the proof that you're my followers you got love one for another we've had a brother come from Africa three or four times and each time he leaves he comes back he said I'm homesick for your church because the love of God that we feel there and he's been in the message longer than that well he's almost been the message longer than I've been alive and he misses our church because of the love of Jesus Christ there I was listening to brother last night uh time tested memorials 1957. little man said oh he said the love of God he said oh you can have all your signs wonders evidences he said that's fine he said but just give me the love of God in our church that's right so if you had the choice would you have the signs wonders and miracles no love or would you rather have no signs wonders of Miracles and love brother Adam said give me the love of God oh Hallelujah now if you love God you'll have signs wonders Miracles like brother John's healing that's an absolute sign Wonder miracle and I'm sure you got some more of them Levi's had some you'll have them but this main thing is just have the love of God that's the main thing that's right all right I'm almost there church I'm about I'm not gonna look at the clock all right now go to Hebrews 10 24 Hebrews 10 24. I got to keep my word I'm not gonna look at the clock not gonna feel bad if I preach long somebody needs it out there by God's grace I'll say like this I Don't Preach long enough now they're probably laughing at home 24. remember Church Paul preached one time all night long and utica's fell out of the window and died and they laid hands on him and raised them up now you talk about a long sermon brother you talk about now turn to the next chapter now we'll go next that's a long night of preaching that's right the longest one brother Randy I think was six hours spoken word original C 1962. I think it was a six hour sermon now that's love that's love when you can sit through all that praise God that's great that's a real long sermon Hebrews 10 24. it's just the Ruth why don't you read uh can you read 24 and 25. now we're getting into everybody needs a home church and a pastor because a sheep without a Shepherd I was just I was driving by down this beautiful country I saw a bunch of babies or little sheep little lambs out there how are they going to do without their Shepherd how are they gonna do without a pastor what do you think's gonna happen they're probably gonna starve they're gonna run away maybe not sorry but run away no protection we're we're the Sheep of God and so the Sheep of God need a pastor to feed them the word of God I love it Jesus leaves the 99 to go get the one [Laughter] he's got 99 safe ones he said I'll leave those 99 I gotta go get one real quick you would hold you 99 just hold on I'm gonna go get that one and then he brings him back and he brings him on his shoulders he puts him on the strongest part of them Hallelujah and that's another church when God Saves our souls we're riding on his strength we feel God's strength we're in a safe spot because he puts us on his shoulders Hallelujah amen he doesn't drag you into his into his flock he puts you on his shoulders he lifts you up and now you're up on his shoulders now you can see things a lot differently up here praise God Amen oh amen you're up there in Heavenly places amen in Christ Jesus all right sister Route 24 25. and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to Good Works not forsaken the selling of ourselves together as a matter of some is but exhorting one another so much the more as you see the data approaching thank you now brother Brad uses the scripture many times to show everyone needs a home church and a pastor right amen now the Bible says it there why do we gather to provoke one another that means to stir you up or inspire you like how come here I'll see brother Irvin that'll inspire me to be a better Christian I hear John good testimony like that stirs me up praise God hallelujah Glory amen and then see someone will see my life and they'll say praise God brother Jesse is a good he's a faithful brother that makes me stronger in the faith we encourage one another no the body builds itself up in love isn't that what the body does it passes oxygen and nutrients back and forth one to another that's the same thing happening here praise God Amen each part of the body needs the other part of the body we need sister Ruth we need I got to get your names remember my sisters but we need all them we need every one of us praise God I'll get it one of these days we I need each one I need higher I need Levi I need Barb I need John I need uh uh John that or Jesse back there in the back and John we need each other brother Irvin because we encourage one another and the Bible said gather more not less gather more as we see Christ coming approaching that means you need your church family more as time goes on not less well I need to see brother Daniel less I need to see I really want to be around John less no that's the devil I want to be around them more Hallelujah church as since I've been Pastor from 2006 I've missed three services that's it for being sick three times in 17 years I miss church every Wednesday every Sunday three times now I tell the church now don't come to church sick because you're gonna get everybody sick unless you've got thou saith the Lord you're going to get healed you should stay home at you should stay home and not get the whole church sick that's just my thoughts you know uh because a lot of people say they got faith and they come here they spread the germs but they don't get healed and then everybody else gets sick so that's just that's just one idea that's that's my own human thought there but the fact is we got to gather more as we see that day approaching and the church said amen right and look at look at uh look at uh Jeffersonville and brown Tabernacle they don't even come together for church right now because of construction they don't even gather more they're not physically Gathering anymore they're breaking the word of God I know they have construction going on but they're breaking the word of God the Bible said we got to gather more as we see that day approaching brother Ram said if you can't go to church at your regular church he said go somewhere he said if you can't get a loaf he said get a slack for a slice of bread amen that's right he said if there's if there's no message churches he said go to a Baptist go to the Pentecostal go somewhere he said don't stay at home he said that dishonors Christ because Christ rose on a Sunday so you should rise up on Sunday and go to church amen Hallelujah really good they dishonor Christ when they stay at home and don't gather with the rest of the body they neglect the rest of the body amen that's right it's exactly right I don't care if they got construction or not they ought to rent out the Holiday Inn and get everybody in there or some other convention or something like that in Luke chapter 4 the Bible said Jesus was in the synagogue every Sabbath what are you saying brother Jess I'm saying Jesus Christ never miss church and that was in the natural think about today whoever two or three are gathered there he is Jesus comes to church every time because he's faithful because he wants to meet with his children he wants to edify you he wants to strengthen you he wants to build you up praise God amen thank God and brother bear makes a joke brother and I can share the brother says you ought to be a legalist in going to church he said at least to get started he makes a joke brother John we're not legalism remember brother makes a joke you ought to be a legalist and go to church every time and I found that to be true I was preaching at our church sometimes I go to church I'm all tired I worked all day I got a headache but I'll start singing I'll start preaching pretty soon my foot up time pretty soon I'll raise my hands pretty soon I'm jumping and praising God pretty soon my headache's gone what happened to all my tiredness I forgot about that and now the Holy Ghost is anointing me now I can praise God like I ought to praise God Amen where'd my headache go God took it away that's happened to me numerous times I've been preaching with a headache by the but by the time I'm finished the headache's gone he healed me right while I'm preaching Hallelujah thank God amen amen Amen brother said we believe every Christian ought to have a home Church they go to every Christian ought to meet somewhere with believers he said wherever you meet that's the church you should have a home church and a pastor brother random called brother Neville his Pastor did you know that yes he said brother Neville our pastor because a prophet can't be the pastor at the same time if he's traveling outside the church he can't pass to the church if he's gone half of the year right that's right so he would say brother Neville the one who stayed there and preached to the Saints brother Neville was the pastor brother Branham was the prophet amen that's right every person needs a pastor that's right praise God and who's the pastor of the pastors Jesus is amen that's right because we got to rely every service brother Irvin brother John every service I was like God help me I'm nothing I have nothing to preach you know sometimes I'm so tired I'm so discouraged and yet God will come down and preach and people say You Preach exactly what I needed and I knew I had nothing to preach to them because it's not me feeding them it's Jesus feeding them praise God in my weakness his strength is made perfect amen amen that's second Corinthians his strength is made perfect in my weakness Jesus cares too much about his sheep to let my tiredness get in the way he's going to bypass my tiredness and he's going to feed the sheep because he loves the Sheep we just got to trust God thank God almost finished here I think now next I want to get into your uh money situations here go to First Corinthians 9 First Corinthians 9. here's how a church is operated if you don't know this roll around taught this the church runs the church gets money from the members through ties and offerings okay so the church every church should have a Treasurer who watches over the the money that's how it was in Jeep remember Jesus started ministry and uh Judas ascarate was his treasurer now he was a bad Treasurer but we all got good Treasures but somebody you know the Bible said Joanna or some of it Mary Magdalene all these women gave money into the church and so Judas kept the money whenever they need something they go out and get the food go out and get whatever they need a church has to have finances so everybody that works a job you should take 10 of your money that's your tithe the word tithe means tenth and give it to the church treasurer and then on top of that you should give an offering based upon how much you can afford and how much you love Jesus amen the Bible calls a free will offering so in the offering you really see how much you love God attempt is whatever it should give that's your duty that's that's the Bible in the offering you see how much do you really trust God how much do you love God right and the Bible said just give just give whatever you can give with a cheerful heart God doesn't want you saying okay I'll give this can't believe they make me get that money God don't receive that the Bible said God loves a cheerful Giver amen amen so church if you pay your 10 and then you got you can only give one more percent just do it happily thank God just be happy when you give that extra offering that's right said if your church is big enough the tithe should support the pastor so he don't have to work he can just study and pray and preach but in our church our church isn't big enough so I got to work a job too but I still take the ties I'll use a little bit of that for to feed my eight children and then but the majority of it I used to rent out a building that brother Ali and Levi been up and then I give it to guest preachers to come preach for us because the labor is worthy of his higher muscle not the ox that drives out the corn now we're not preaching money today you know I'm just telling you what the Bible says praise God I don't want your money but this is how a church is funded First Corinthians 9 verse 13 and 14. brother Howard you got that can you now in your own time read seven through twelve Paul talks about this he explains it a farmer doesn't plant crops and then not eat the food in his farm right nobody if you if you have a Vineyard of grapes you don't plant the grapes and then not drink the wine no neither does a preacher preach and not get the benefits of that or the help of that okay now brother Howard can you read verses 13 and 14. 9 yes thank you first Corinthians 9 13-14 [Music] live of the things of the temple and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar even so has the Lord ordained that they would preached the gospel should live of the Gospel amen now Paul later on says he didn't take any tithes and offerings because he didn't want the people thinking uh that he was after money right so Paul says I didn't take any of that but I want you to see there if you look at the Old Testament the Levites lived off the tithes and offerings of the other tribes amen and Paul says just as they lived off the gospel preachers today should live off the gospel now I hope someday our church gets big enough so I don't have to go to work I just like to go study and preach and pray all day I'd like to do that but I just got to wait I've been doing it 17 years I'll just keep waiting if it never happens praise God I'll just keep working praise God because Paul made tents and then he wrote the Bible at the same time he's a tent maker and he wrote the Bible he worked and then he preached he worked and then he wrote so we do whatever God's called us to do now go to Genesis 14 20. where did Ty start brother Jesse Ty started with the father of Faith Abraham [Music] who is the first first High pair it was Abraham Genesis 14 20. Genesis 14 20. Hallelujah [Music] 14 20. I'm looking for a verse here so bear with me here a little thought going to my mind all right 14 20. now let me know this story [Music] Abraham's fighting five Gentile Kings can you imagine going he's only got servants maybe I think I think the Bible said like around 312 or something you only got 312 servants and he's got to go fight five Kings does he have any chance to win this battle there's no chance no chance yet God gives him favor and then he whips five Kings on the way coming back he meets God but God's got a body on and his name is Melchizedek amen and the Bible says in Hebrews 7 Melchizedek has no father no mother no beginning of days nor end of life it was God Almighty in other words he met he met his captain he met the possessor of heavens and earth he met the god of the universe because the god of the universe helped him defeat those five armies praise God and on the way back he recognized I Just Whipped five kingdoms on the way back he meets Melchizedek and brother Irvin would read uh 1420 brother blessed be the most high God which has delivered the enemies into thy hand and he gave him can you picture he just whipped five Kings and he comes there and says Lord thank you for blessing me because of all that you've given me you've helped me defeat enemies I should not be able to defeat you help me have income I shouldn't have been able to get on my own because you blessed me I'm going to give you a tenth of everything you gave me this is the friend of God hallelujah Abraham is called the friend nothing gives it to me amen that's right I know victories unless God fights for me praise God and everything that God gives me I'll give him back ten percent praise God so where did Ty start brother Jesse in the law no before the law before Moses Tai started from us the Abraham the father of our faith and we're the children of Abraham oh Lord praise God so now you need to make plans by God's grace you pay a 10 of your off or 10 of your income to the church and you give offerings whatever you can afford you can do little whatever whatever you want one time I calculated I think I was given 18 percent some people would give 20 you know whatever I don't know what I'm at now I haven't looked for a little bit but you give whatever you can afford and then that allows the church to have funds to eventually maybe build a building or not doesn't matter you can use that to support a pastor right or you can use it for whatever God leads maybe missionary work send missionaries to the rest of the Amisha I haven't heard the message and exactly right wouldn't that be awesome pay for their hotels pay for their food their gas maybe buy a church van for the set send missionary send out preachers to the Amish who've never had a chance to hear it like you got to hear it praise God Hallelujah oh it's beautiful whatever God puts on your heart okay now I'm just I'm just hitting there's a lot more scriptures on all these topics each each topic I preached I could probably read the whole sermon on it but I felt led to lay the foundational Bible truth this morning amen so you can have a vision of where God is taking you amen do you see where God's taking you now it's a house of love it's a body of Jesus Christ that strengthens meets more and more and helps each other along the way loves each other through all life's troubles and pains and sorrows and victories amen amen the preaching builds you up strengthens you gives you Faith and Hope the Bible said how can it be here except they it's not a preacher and the Bible said faith comes by hearing hearing by the word of God amen amen now I want to close with this I want to close by saying one more thing about legalism as we talked about the different ones I've talked with about is that legalism is motivated by fear but Christianity is motivated by faith and love and so when people under uh fear they don't they're not free to worship God like they ought to no no right and so I I was under fear as well when I first got saved I was still I was thankful I was so happy to be saved uh but I had trouble worshiping God I'm trying to find this verse here like I was uncomfortable worshiping God like I like I like how many likes to sing to Jesus I really like the songs I love the song service but when I first got to say brother Urban this is all I could do I would look is anybody else lifting their hands if not I'm not going to but if somebody lift their hands I'll lift my hands a little bit now look at me now I scream and shout and dance around here I punch things I do all kinds of stuff because I'm free amen that's right before I was like anybody looking at me and pretty soon pretty soon I can start raising my hand pretty soon I could say amen to the preacher praise God after a while that I could start stomping my foot a little bit a little while later and I could clap and stuff and pretty soon I can start raising my hands and raising the Lord and now I'm just as free as a bird amen I'm not caged up I'm free to worship god brother Adam said I want the holy ghost from the top of my head to the souls of my feet amen hallelujah religion in your head he said he said get religion in your feet he said get religion all over you amen oh Hallelujah isn't that the Bible doesn't second uh Samuel 6 14. say when David brought the ark back to Jerusalem Church he was bringing it back to melchizedek's home City oh Hallelujah what is God City Jerusalem [Music] and David sees wow God's presence is getting in God's city to live with God's people amen oh no he said now he said I'll I don't want to hit my head on this he said but now I can leave for joy right the Bible says he lead with all of his mind that's what the Bible says with all of his heart he worship God he praise God you dance around and he praise God because the word was getting in position and church that's what's happening in your midst the word of God is getting you in position praise God to be a real Church of the Living God amen not a legal it's his church and not a church of lasciviousness but a church based upon the order of the word of God how many believe that on the day of Pentecost brother Adam said they look like a bunch of drunk people out there brother man said they got so filled with the Holy Spirit they had to leave the upper room he said they went down the steps and they went praising God saying Jesus is the Messiah Jesus has risen from the dead he said they declared the wonderful works of God and they glorified God and everybody mocked him and said they're drunk and no Peter says he said this is that which job spoken of God is pouring out his spirit and church that's what God wants to do here he wants to pour out of the spirit upon his children praise God hallelujah praise God amen amen he wants you to be free the Bible says in Lamentations when you sin you lose your dance that's what the Bible says I don't have it right in front of me but I preach when brother our lady was there in the Levi when you when you sin you can no longer dance and praise God well the first thing is we got to get a dance praise God we actually have to have a dance before we can lose a dance and brother Brandon says the first time he danced with him when he was a pastor he preached for four and a half hours on the on the second coming on New Year's Eve 1932. he sat down for a break and he said some sisters got up and started playing there's going to be a meeting in the air in that sweet sweet bye and bye brother said he he said he was so mad he said this is horrible they're making my tabernacle into a bar room I got the quotes he said this is terrible how awful this he said this is horrible they kept dancing and he said well where do they get that in the Bible is that in the Bible I love how God does it we might have an evil spirit right we might have the wrong attitude but then God will he'll help us and say well let's look in the Bible and see if that's in the Bible aren't you glad he doesn't leave you in that sinful condition called it the seat of the scornful God doesn't let you be the Michael up there saying oh how glorious is David you're making fun of the people actually worshiping God doesn't leave you up there God lets you become a part of the worship amen everyone said pretty serious though oh that's right the first person that danced was Miriam that's a good name sister that's right and why do they dance because they just got the victory all their task Masters had drowned in the Red Sea amen the evil men and the slave drivers that used to beat them and their children and their husbands and their wives all the old slave masters had now drowned and the Bible said Moses started singing the spirit and Miriam an 85 year old woman picked up a tambourine and she said come on Sisters Let's Dance and praise the Lord amen if an 85 year old woman can dance for God what can we do praise God and don't you know the Red Sea is a foreshadowing of your baptism that's right when they went to the Red Sea the Bible said that's just like your baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen oh hallelujah thank God Amen then brother and thought yeah that's right David danced before the Lord too when the ark was coming in he said the only problem with me is I just don't have enough victory brother Graham said did you ever get that much Victory to dance amen hallelujah how many got that Victory to dance amen I got it I don't cuss anymore I don't smoke anymore I don't watch dirty things anymore I don't look at dirty magazines anymore I got the victory all those all those demons I used to be uh a living for they're all cast out praise God now I'm free Hallelujah I got the victory I can dance and sing because Jesus set me free amen all of my sins are in the sand forgetfulness he whom the son set free is free indeed Hallelujah hey man brothers and the trouble is I just don't have enough victory and they said okay I'll start tapping my foot there's going to be some of us just need to learn how to tap our feet that'll be a good start I'm going to meet you greet you over there in that home beyond the sky remember I said before I knew it I was out there dancing with the sister praising God he said I sure didn't look very good he said but I felt great he said I didn't look really good I probably looked awful he said but I felt so much better afterwards why because he had the victory praise God Amen that's right hey man and the Bible said there's a time to mourn and there's a time to what amen that's right there's times your life when God it's okay to mourn God understands you've got you've lost a loved one or something it's more but if you're not in that morning season Well church then what what season are you in what's the opposite of mourning we're in a season of Dance at our church right now we've been dancing almost every service we're in the season of it the first time we danced my daughters come home they're like daddy that's the greatest Services we've ever had because now they're no longer like now they're like oh Jesus loves me he forgave me he filled me with the Holy Ghost I can praise God and church you've got Bible permission to dance for Jesus amen Psalm 149 verse 3 says let them praise the Lord in the dance Hallelujah that word let means Allah you should allow them to praise God why when anybody want to stop the dance it's Satan Satan wants to stop the dance say he wants to stop the victory but God said I love him to praise God with the dance Hallelujah that's right and he says it again the next chapter it's psalm 150. verse 4. praise His name in the dance Hallelujah let everything that hath breath praise the Lord amen amen I know church I know you're not most people aren't going to be able to accept this right now but I'm planting for the future because when I come first in the message I couldn't dance I was like no way everyone's gonna be looking at me now I'm like I don't care when anybody looks at that I know God's looking at me praise God Amen because that's what David said even told his wife Michael I wasn't dancing for you I was dancing before God and Hallelujah and then he said if you didn't like that wait till you see what I'm gonna do next amen so that means he went even higher you don't like that honey you watched what I got next hey man oh he tore it up he was dancing praising God why church because he was a man after God's Own Heart praise God let's stand to our feet praise God hey man let's give God a round of applause hahaha [Applause] oh thank you Jesus Hallelujah [Applause] doesn't the Bible say rejoice in the lord always and again I say rejoice that's right let me know that scripture Philippians 4 verse 4. doesn't the Bible say the kingdom of God is Not meat and drink but righteousness Joy and peace in the Holy Ghost in that Romans 14 17. all you Bible readers that's right oh Hallelujah this is the start of something special here by God's grace that's right don't you leave that brother yeah you believe that sisters this is something special God has just brought you through the Red Sea and now it's time to rejoice you mean we're not going to be slaves illegalists all the legalism devils are drowned in the ocean or drown the Red Sea yes every demon from the past every evil spirit from the past is now drowned and will never see him no more [Applause] brought me up praise God and I want to say thank you Hallelujah hahaha Jesus Hallelujah now for me I was brought out of denominational like I said Pentecostals that I was with the Presbyterians I was brought out of their chains and their legalism like the trinity and all their legalistic teachings they allow they they do a lot of sinful things too like allow and sin and getting drunk all these things and all I and by God's grace when I come in the message brother Daniel I saw all those demon taskmasters all those slave drivers of it's okay to get drunk I saw all of them drowning the sea the blood of Jesus Christ washed all my sins away amen that's right and the church said amen amen let's bow our heads here for a word of Prayer Hallelujah I know I preached a lot I did that on purpose I want to teach the people some important foundational truths do not let anyone ever take your freedom like the Bible said all of us we cannot get entangled again in a yoke of bondage we are free Christians in Jesus Christ's holy name so let's pray together let's pray and ask God to bless us help us to obey the Holy Spirit uh to to sow to sow to the Holy Spirit and will reap spiritual blessings how many want that today by God's grace let's pray together heavenly father I thank you for this church Lord these are your people Lord God hallelujah they love the Bible some of them are quoting the Bible as I preach it Lord God and finish the verses thank you God Amen amen dear God thank you for bringing them out Lord God of Egypt you brought them out of sinful legalism Lord and now they've crossed through the waters of the Red Sea oh God thank you Lord God may you help this to be a season of Joy a season of Dance a season of Victory Lord God hallelujah bless your people may they know all their transgressions have been forgiven hallelujah thank you Jesus for the great work you're doing here Lord God and I pray Lord they will sow to the Holy Spirit they'll read their Bibles they'll believe these Bibles they'll listen to brother Brown and when brother points to the Bible they'll believe it dear God granted Lord Jesus father send the fivefold ministry here to unify the people build them up to a Unity of the faith as the Bible says Dear God and I pray set your people free I pray amen set your people free just as you did me in our church set us free we ask it in Jesus Christ's name and the saint said let's give God [Applause] now let's let's sing the meeting in the air I'll leave the song I just want you to clap along and maybe stop your foot a little bit how many can do that by God's grace yes all right let's sing that course there there's going to be I'm going to meet you and beat you over there in that home beyond the side such thing [Music] thank you Jesus everyone [Applause] how can I not praise him he's taken away all my sins amen he sped my eight children he's healed my sick body he's given us a
