TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] that's that's the law greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to prove hopefully by God's grace once and for all that the Lord Jesus Christ revealed the revelation of the second seal to his servant his Prophet brother William Branham as you probably know earlier this year in April one of brother Ram's accusers made a video series accusing him of plagiarizing Charles Tays Russell and Clarence Larkin on the Seven Seals but that of course is a false accusation brother Rams accusers say he plagiarized Charles Tays Russell on the second seal and will prove that was false but first let's review the first seal I want to briefly show six differences the accusers of brother Branham left out regarding the first seal and these six differences proved brother Ram did not plagiarize Charles Tays Russell and Clarence Larkin and of course you can watch the full length video about the first seal and Lord willing I'll leave a link to it in the description the first difference was the timing brother Brandon's first seal started over 200 years earlier than Russell's first seal and brother random's first seal ended 150 years before Russell's first seal ended and regarding brother Branham and Clarence Larkin there is no comparison in the timing of their first seals there's nearly a 2 000 year difference between Brother branham's start time for the first seal and Clarence Larkin's start time Larkin's first seal hasn't even happened yet because he said it starts during the 70th week of Daniel during the Great Tribulation period which hasn't happened yet and brother Randall's first seal started in the first century second regarding the White Horse Russell said it was the doctrines and teachings of the Lord and the apostles brother Ram said exactly the opposite he said it was the Antichrist Spirit or the nicolaitan spirit or the deceiving spirit regarding the color white Russell said it was the doctrines and teachings of the Lord and the apostles again brother random said it was the impersonator of Christ the fourth difference was with the rider Russell said the writer was the bishop of Rome but brother random said the writer started out as the Antichrist Spirit upon the entire age of false teachers citing first John 2 Verse 18 and how there was already many antichrists in the world at the time Saint John wrote that letter then brother Graham said the writer would eventually become the pope and then lastly the Antichrist Pope during the Great Tribulation period but we know that doesn't happen until the end of the fourth seal the fifth difference was the emphasis Russell emphasized the reign of Constantine in the first seal where the Branham emphasized the deceiving Antichrist Spirit upon the false church and I was combated by the mighty Miracles and deeds of the early apostles and the sixth major difference between Russell Larkin and brother Branham was that Russell said the Beast of the first seal which the Bible said was a lion Russell called it infinite Justice and that apparently God forsook his church when infinite Justice or the lion Beast was defeated by the ecclesiastical system of the Roman Catholic Church it's very different from Brother Branham brother random said the lion represented the anointing of the holy spirit that saved the world said the early church had healings and miracles and visions and Power because it was the Living Word in the form of the line of the tribe of Judah writing out to combat that so I hope that summary of the six major differences about the first seal proves positively that brother Branham did not plagiarize the first seal from Clarence Larkin and Charles Tays Russell the second seal we'll begin with the accusation that brother Ram's accusers stated about the second seal they said quote William Branham appears to be teaching the doctrine of Charles Hayes Russell the Watchtower Society the Jehovah's Witnesses as having come straight from God to him end quote of course this is a false accusation first note that brother Ram's accusers said nothing about Clarence Larkin in the second seal why not it appears they didn't mention Larkin because it shows they're aware brother Branham taught nothing similar to Larkin which proves to me they are straining at a net and swallowing a camel because they have no real evidence for plagiarism the lack of a mention of Larkin on the second seal proves they read through Russell Larkin's work and shows they are either very dishonest researchers on purpose or they're very forgetful honest researchers who made awful mistakes but God is the only one who knows and I can't judge their hearts I can only show how it seems they purposely are slandering God's Prophet brother Brandon with dishonest research or at least extremely shoddy and weak so-called research back to the accusation I'll begin by focusing on Charles Tay's Russell because again that's the only name brother Ram's accusers use in their sad attempt to slander brother Brandon and call him a plagiarist I want to begin by showing screenshots from the accusers video and brother Ram's accusers quoted three phrases from Charles Hayes Russell's book The finished mystery and Friends it was three phrases not even three complete sentences and then they falsely claimed brother Branham plagiarized Russell it's shocking for me to see how little information the accusers used of Russell's second seal as he wrote about it on pages 106 through 112 in his book that's nearly seven pages of information about the second seal and brother Ram's accusers used three short phrases it seems brother Ram's accusers were likely withholding much information about Russell's second seal in order to purposely slander God's true Prophet brother Branham so here's the visual of a screenshot of all seven pages that Russell wrote about the second seal so out of these seven pages I'll zoom in and show now the yellow highlighted area are the three phrases whether Ram's accusers quoted it's such a small amount of information compared again to the whole seven pages worth of information about the second seal so the real accusation should be against brother Ram's accusers it appears they chose an extremely limited amount of Russell's teachings to purposely slander God's true Prophet brother Branham so let's look at the three phrases other Rams accusers used on their second seal video the first one is from page 106 Russell wrote quote and when he'd open the second seal end quote the second quote is from page 106 quote the same writer the Antichrist end quote and the third quote is from page 107 quote the pope each Pope and his turn is the head of the false church end quote so did Brother random agree with these two statements and note that the first statement isn't an opinion of Russell he's just quoting scripture so the second quote said quote the same writer the Antichrist end quote did Brother random agree with that yes brother Branham agreed and said quote now here's my revelation of it this is Satan again it's the devil again in another form end quote the third and final quote brother man's accusers use the Russell was on page 107 quote the pope each Pope in his turn is the head of the false church end quote regarding the pope yes brother random agreed but said much more remember Russell wrote nearly seven pages about the second seal alone well the ram said in the second seal quote notice Satan's Trinity same person coming just incarnate from one to the other that's the way them bugs did them worms one to the other exactly nicolaitan spiritual Antichrist Pope false prophet Beast the Devil Himself incarnate end quote even though brother Branham agree with these two statements there was so much more both Russell and brother Brandon said about the second seal that brother Ram's accusers have neglected to share with you and remember their video was two minutes and 33 seconds long that is not enough time to cover the second seal roller random sermon on the second seal was two hours 18 minutes and 24 seconds and of course Charles Taze Russell wrote nearly seven pages about the second seal so a 2 minute and 33 second video is a weak attempt at accusing brother Branham of plagiarism but again that speaks to the character of brother Ram's accusers and also exposes their motives and objectives because they've ignored so much information and research and that shows whether they're trustworthy or not now here are six differences between Charles Tays Russell and brother Branham on the second seal this is information brother Brands accusers either didn't read or purposely ignored and of course that's to their own shame first the timing of the second seal as you can see on your screen brother random second seal was about from 385 to 1095 because he said the second seal was the red horse rider that was when the Roman Catholic Church jumped off the White Horse and jumped onto the red bloody horse it was when the Roman Catholic Church had power to kill dissenters with the literal sword and of course the second seal lasted until the third seal started which was around the time of the Dark Ages hence the year 1095 A.D which is about the time the Dark Ages started notice Charles Hayes Russell said the timing was from 3 25 to 5 39 A.D and here's a screenshot of that from page 107 quote this appeared beginning with the year 325 A.D and extending to the year 539 was a period of formation of Creeds end quote so regarding the timing of the second seal brother Branham did not plagiarize Charles Tays Russell second let's look at the horse brother random said it's the Pope the false prophet who has power to kill with the literal sword let's listen to the quotes one to the other exactly Indian spiritual Antichrist hope false prophet Beast Devil Himself incarnate now I remember he's got a sword he's going forth for a sword in his hand riding red horse waiting to the cloud of everybody that disagrees with him regarding the horse Russell said it was a Creed horse on page 106 Russell said quote a Creed horse quite different from the scriptures which it misrepresented end quote so it's clear brother Brown did not plagiarize Russell Russell said the horse was a Creed horse well the random said it was the power of Satan in the pope and the Roman Catholic Church to literally kill genuine Christians third let's look at the color red Russell said red was quote the color of sin imperfection though your sins be as Scarlet Isaiah 1 verse 18 end quote this was different from Brother Branham brother Branham said it was a bloody red in the second seal brother Brandon said quote from the innocent white to a bloody red riding red horse wading through the blood of everyone that disagrees with him end quote let's listen to the quote and the Beast in the Bible and her symbol represents of power same system right on another color Tower from the innocent white to a bloody red do you think how ever he's got a sword he's going forth a sword in his hand riding riding sweating to the blood of everybody that disagrees with him how do you understand it yeah how many understands what that seal is now all right so on the third detail brother random is again proven to have a unique Revelation not the same as Russell brother around did not plagiarize regarding the color red fourth let's look at the sword Russell said the sword was Satan's power to destroy as teachers and he said it was the power of the Pope to speak a Creed and then be shared through the Catholic teachers and that would destroy people's faith page 106 Russell said quote that they should kill one another dispose and Destroy one another as teachers by inveying the Roman power against all offenders and there was given unto him a great sword end quote and then picking up on page 107 quote so the papacy has a great and powerful sword in opposition to the sword of the spirit and it too comes out of papacy's mouth the pope each Pope in his turn is the head of the false church this period was the period of formation of Creeds end quote brother bran did not say the sword was the word of the Pope destroying through Catholic teachers brother Rams said the sword was a red sword and it represented the death of over 68 million Protestants let's listen to the quotes listen I'm quoting from the martyrology from the Timeless of Saint Augustine of Hippo until 15 and 86 on the Roman moderology the Roman Catholic Church put 68 million policies today was his sword read a red horse same time same writer amen there's a seal so now we can see brother Ram did not plagiarize on the fourth detail the sword the fifth detail was the emphasis going back to this screenshot of all seven of Russell's pages on these seven Pages Russell emphasized five Catholic creeds that was completely different from Brother Branham and brother Ram's second seal he emphasized the death of over 68 million Christian Martyrs and of course he was citing Samuel s schmucker's book the Glorious Reformation so brother random is again acquitted of the plagiarism accusation regarding the emphasis of the second seal and six and finally the Beast Charles Hayes Russell said the Beast of the second seal was infinite power so in other words the ox represented infinite power while the ram did not teach that brother Brown said the ox Beast represented the anointing upon Christians to be sacrificial Martyrs for the faith again connecting this idea to the 68 million Christian Protestant martyrs let's listen to brother Adam's quote from the fifth seal where he says the ox is a beast of sacrifice and the Saints had this anointing on them and they freely gave their lives they didn't mind dying because it was the very Spirit of the age the anointing of the ox upon the real Christians let's listen to the quote gauges a thousand years there the Catholicism control the world that's all right it wasn't God anyhow very so the conclusion between Russell and brother Brandon is that brother Ram did not plagiarize Charles Tays Russell I just showed you six differences on the main details regarding both men's teachings about the second seal and friends I read all seven pages of Russell's work about the second seal and he never mentioned 68 million Martyrs like brother Rana mentioned so that was a revelation the Lord Jesus Christ gave to brother Branham with thus saith the Lord to prove that brother Brown's Revelation came from the Lord Jesus Christ and not the Jehovah's Witnesses and this is why brother Graham said thus saith the Lord at the end of the second seal that his Revelation was from the Lord and not Charles Tays Russell Clarence Larkin nor Uriah Smith Hallelujah the races and visions and everything else it doesn't on the part and how many doors that raise your hand everybody here with their hands up that's right so shall this be for moving on I just want to make a response to one of the comments on my first seal video one of the supporters of brother Ram's accusers admitted there were differences between Russell Larkin and Branham on the first seal but still said brother Brandon plagiarized and at the timing of the first seal didn't matter now friends that's total nonsense just as a simple example details like timing are crucial in order to convict one of plagiarism for example if the Britannica Encyclopedia said the American Revolutionary War was from 1775 to 1783 would it be plagiarism if my start date for the American Revolution was 60 years later than the 1775 starting date or 1835 and my end date was 556 years later then the britannica's end date which would be 2339 no it wouldn't be plagiarism and friends that's the difference between the start dates between Russell brother Bynum and Clarence Larkin a person cannot be accused of plagiarizing if there are huge differences between the details of the content next let's compare Clarence Larkin and brother Branham which brother Ram's accusers did not do on the second seal video regarding the timing and identity of the rider Clarence Larkin said quote this seems to imply that the Antichrist will not have everything his own way end quote so again Clarence Larkin is saying the writer is the person of the Antichrist and the timing is during the Great Tribulation period or Daniel's 70th week here's a visual showing how brother Ram did not plagiarize Clarence Larkin on the timing of the second seal notice brother random's timing was about three to five to ten ninety five and Clarence Larkin's timing is still in the future it hasn't happened yet it's absolutely ludicrous to say brother Branham plagiarize Larkin or even Charles Tays Russell on the second seal you can find Larkin's information about the second seal on page 55 of his book so it's a simple conclusion to show brother Ram's second seal started nearly 1600 years before Larkins and Larkin's second seal hasn't even occurred yet well the brand said the rider was the Antichrist spirit in a man then in a pope in the second seal Larkin said the writer is the literal person or literal man of the Antichrist during the Great Tribulation period who will make a covenant with the Jews so the conclusion is brother Brown did not plagiarize Clarence Larkin finally let's compare Uriah Smith and brother Branham regarding the second seal your eyes missed timing seems to be the second century until the climax of the reign of Constantine and I say seems to be because he did not specifically State when the first seal ended or when the second seal started but he did give us a start date for the third seal so that's how we know his second seal ended under the reign of Constantine now regarding the writer of the second seal urai Smith gave No Rider he mentioned Constantine and the union of church and state and of course this is from his book Daniel and the Revelation from 1897. here's screenshots of the two pages your I Smith wrote about the second seal and now I'll show you the information Uriah gave about the timing and the writer quote the spirit of this period perhaps reached its climax as we come down to the days of Constantine the first so-called Christian Emperor whose conversion to Christianity is dated by mosheem in ad323 end quote here's a picture of the timing of the second seal showing the difference between brother Branham and Uriah Smith quote of this period Dr Rice remarks it represents a secular period or Union of church and state Constantine aided the clergy and put them under obligations to him he legislated for the church called the Council of nicaea and was most prominent in that Council end quote so the conclusion between Uriah Smith and brother Branham is that brother Brown's second seal started about 185 years later than Smith's for the Rams was 385. your eye Smith was likely around 200 A.D because he said the first seal was for the first century brother Ram's second seal ended about 758 years later than Uriah Smith as Uriah Smith said the third seal started around 3 37 or 338 A.D also brother Ram said the writer was the Antichrist spirit in the pope and the Roman Catholic Church Uriah Smith didn't specifically State who the writer was but it was either Constantine or the union of church and state so the conclusion is brother Graham did not plagiarize Uriah Smith in closing friends I hope this second seal video has been a blessing to you because it again proves that the Lord Jesus Christ revealed the revelation of the second seal to brother Branham just like the Lord Jesus revealed the first seal Revelation to brother Branham and friends it's hard to put into words how disappointed I am with the research or so-called research of brother Ram's accusers it is so incredibly weak and it seems to be so incredibly dishonest it seems to be a purposeful Slanders attack against brother Branham I don't say that is but it really looks like that because of the amount of information that Russell taught about the second seal and how little Orleans accusers actually use on their video and all my statements here are spoken in brotherly kindness and love Jesus said to love your enemies and pray for your enemies and I feel like brother Ram's accusers have become our enemies by falsely accusing brother Branham of plagiarism and other accusations what they're really doing is speaking against the word of God that the Lord Jesus Christ revealed to brother Branham so with Christian love we should pray for them which is what we'll do right now father God again I just come to you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and Lord I just pray your Holy Spirit would again deal with brother Adam's accusers father if they watch this video may they be convicted also with the first seal video and be able to recognize the truth and Lord look at all the research and the full content of brother Ram's sermons and compare these teachings with an honest sincere heart somehow Lord they've lost their honesty and sincerity or their ability to look at a subject objectively so I pray May the spirit of honesty come back upon them the spirit of understanding the spirit of knowledge so they could recognize their heirs Lord repent of them and repent of their Slanders and false accusations and Lord have a fresh start serving you dear God that's my humble prayer and Lord if there's anything wrong I said Lord please forgive me just show me I'll quickly repent by your grace Lord God so ask all these things humbly in the mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen friends if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
