TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] greetings friends in the name of Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to share three prophecies that God gave to his Prophet William brandham one prophecy about the spiritual condition of the United States churches is completely fulfilled and has come to pass the other two Prophecies of about no greater Ministry to the Gentiles and no return of the Christian denominations to the apostolic Ministry have stood true for 53 years and 49 years respectively before we examine these three prophecies we want to share with you that God told us there would be prophets come after Jesus left the Earth some people believe Jesus was the last prophet to the New Testament Church but we believe that's a misunderstanding agabus St John and St Paul are clear examples of prophets who foretold the future after Jesus ascended to Heaven St Paul wrote in Ephesians 48-13 that Jesus sent five preaching gifts to the Earth to help unite and mature the church one of those gifts was the prophet we conclude then that prophets can still be sent today just as pastors and the remaining preaching gifts are still sent by Jesus for the Perfection of the Saints we see agabus prophesying years after Jesus physically left the Earth St John was used to foretell the future by receiving the entire Book of Revelation from Jesus himself nearly 60 years after Jesus ascended St Paul repeatedly prophesied of the end times and warned Believers of the future through his Epistles St Paul also ordained prophecy as a spiritual gift and told Believers to not despise prophecies so the believer today will understand prophecy as a gift God wants to use through Chosen and obedient [Music] men based upon these truths We Believe William brandham was a true Prophet sent by God to forun the second coming of Jesus Christ to the Earth in order for William brandham or anyone else to be considered a genuine prophet numerous conditions must be met the person claiming to be a prophet must live a Godly life of Holiness teach the word of God in its Purity have converts to Christ as a fruit to his ministry reveal secrets from the Bible that were previously hidden or not understood and lastly have the anointing of the Holy Ghost for Supernatural signs and prophecies We Believe William Branda met all of these conditions and this video will focus on three of the prophets phes that William brandham was anointed to speak in the name of the Lord Deuteronomy 18: 20-22 tells us that a true prophet's prophecies spoken in the name of the Lord will come to pass proving God sent him a false prophet's prophecies will not come to pass proving God did not send him now let's look at the three prophecies God gave to William brandom that have either been fulfilled completely or are in the process of being fulfilled prop prophecy number one the immoral condition of the United States churches 49 years ago in 1965 William Brandon prophesied that the Church of the United States would be known for their love of rock and roll and immorality at that time history says that rock and roll itself and musicians like Elvis Presley were denounced by most clergy members but William brandham was given a vision that predicted the churches would soon Embrace rock and roll and other worldly practices let listen to the prophecy and when I seen Miss USA come up I almost fainted now this is thus sayith the Lord and like hoola dancing paint short bobbed hair smoking cigarettes and twisting as it walked to rock and roll and I said is that the Church of the United States and the voice said yes it is almost 50 years ago William brandham saw the immoral condition today's United States churches would be in and correctly prophesied of what God showed him in many churches today their worship Services closely resemble a rock and roll concert due to the popularity and influence of the lucrative business of Christian contemporary music along with that many church members enjoy listening to rock and roll music and do not see it as a sinful act anymore although it used to be considered sinful many church members see no problem singing along in dancing to worldly rock and roll in their homes cars at weddings restaurants and other social Gatherings the second part of the prophecy said that churches in the United States would adopt and accept unbiblical practices that they once recognized as being against the scriptures we will share four of these practices that were prophesied sadly most people are totally unaware that the Bible is against such practices and so our prayer is that the churches and their ministers will return to preaching the Full Gospel El of Jesus Christ we humbly pray Believers will see obedience to these Commandments of God as an act of Love rather than an act of legalism for Jesus said our obedience should be based upon our love for him if you love me keep my Commandments the first practice prophesied of to be widely accepted in churches was smoking cigarettes which defiles the body the Temple of the Holy Ghost breaking the scripture of 1 Corinthians 3:17 the Bible also says in 1 Corinthians 6 612 that we should not be brought under the power of any and addictions are clearly a power that bind many people to lust of the flesh the second practice prophesied of was immodest and seductive clothing breaking the Commandment for modesty in 1 Timothy 2:9 the third practice prophesied of was wearing makeup which is against the word of God in 2 Kings 9:30 and Jeremiah 4:30 the fourth practice was women cutting or bobbing their hair short which is also contrary to the word of God in 1 Corinthians 11 1-6 according to history we have read the presence and love for Rock and Roll Along with immoral practices of smoking cigarettes wearing a modest clothing makeup and bobbed hair were generally unheard of in Bible teaching churches 50 years ago based upon this evidence we conclude this prophecy about the condition of the churches in the United States to be fulfilled prophecy number two no greater Ministry to the Gentiles meaning William bram's Ministry from Jesus Christ would be the last sign to the gentile people before the second coming of Jesus [Music] Christ over 50 years ago William brandham repeatedly prophesied that no Ministry would arise to the Gentiles which are non-jews that would be greater than the ministry that Jesus Christ gave to him William brandom said that God told him his ministry was the last sign and the greatest sign to the Gentiles before the second coming of Jesus Christ he also told us that the next great ministry on the earth after his would be that of the two Jewish prophets of Revelation 11 the Bible plainly shows that we're in the last day and the last sign amen I'm fairly young yet I'm 53 years old watch this in the name of the Lord you'll never see nothing greater remember let me tell you thus saith the spirit of God that's on me this is the last sign to the Gentiles Church before the Rapture you're receiving your greatest time in your lifetime before the appearing of CH what made William brandom's Ministry so unique why would the spirit of God make such a bold claim William brandham had a prophetic gift of discernment that could tell people the very thoughts and secrets of their hearts William bram's prophetic gift was the Fulfillment of Luke 17:30 the revealing of the son of man to the Gentiles this prophetic gift was simply the Return of the same gift that the Lord Jesus himself exercised in St John chapter 1 with Peter and Nathaniel and in St John chapter 4 with the Samaritan woman at the well immediately after the Samaritan woman's sinful secret of having six men in her life was revealed by jesus' prophetic gift she knew the gift of a prophet was present with her for she said sir I perceive that thou art a prophet in St John 4:19 later in verse 29 she said come and see a man which told me all the things I ever did is not this the Christ now let's watch as God lets William Brandon manifest the same prophetic gift of discernment that Jesus did this son of man gift in his life will reveal 15 secrets to a patient in this particular prayer line from 1954 of course you're safe and you're suffering with the a condition it's a it's a dark Spirit around it's death and it's in a form of cancer and the cancer is located on the breast and you're seeing you're examined by someone strong and it's a you got a a ruptured condition and the rupture is in the bow and you have a stomach trouble also a severe heart trouble that cause you painting of here a few days ago you're setting sideways on the side of a bed and nearly pass out looking towards your window are those things the truth that all true or whatever it was of course it's gone from me but what do you think that was that knows your lifee was it Jesus Christ you accepted to be that yes thank you you're willing you know that something Supernatural is here and if you believe it to be the Lord Jesus as I have preached it out of the word and you believe it to be the Lord Jesus yes I I know there's a dark Spirit if see hanging at you yet it's something very serious say I see you your name is uh Eva yes and your last name is York and you live in this city yes and your house number is 613 6 Street is that right you're going home to be well in name of Jesus [Music] CHR the reason we believe this last sign prophecy is in the process of being fulfilled over 50 years later is because no preacher has ever manifested the power of Jesus Christ on or near the same level as the ministry that God gave to William brandham churches today have grown in attendance and finances and preachers have written more books and had worldwide television Ministries but no gift has ever risen that compares to the prophetic son of man gift that God gave to William brandham where is a Gifted Man that can tell strangers their name their address their sickness and many other details of their lives by receiving Visions from Jesus Christ we have not seen a man do this infallibly since William Brandon ministered to God's people the proof of the supernatural power of God in William brandman's Ministry is undeniable as testimonies abound to the supernat natural presence of Jesus Christ doing the same signs wonders and miracles as were recorded in the Bible in its February 1961 issue the Full Gospel men's voice now called the Full Gospel business men's voice wrote The Following in Bible days there were men of God who were prophets and seers but in all sacred records none of these had a greater Ministry than that of William brandham brandom has been used by God In The Name of Jesus to raise the dead so therefore we conclude and firmly believe that the prophecy God spoke 51 years ago is in the process of being fulfilled prophecy number three there will be no return of Christian denominations to the apostolic Ministry in 1965 William Brandon prophesied that denominational churches would never break up their denominations and come back to preaching and living the true word of God their worship would not resemble the book of Acts Church which had Supernatural power gifts of the Spirit the baptism of the Holy Ghost and Christian Holiness it's predicted that they're going to do it and they're going to do it or it's thus sayith the lord they're going to do it you think them nominations will ever break up their denomination come back to the word it's thus sayith the Lord they won't the reason we know this prophecy is in the process of coming to pass is because in the past 49 years all denominations whether Catholic or Protestant have failed to break up their denominations and denounce their man-made bylaws and traditions of men most denominations have little to no religion that resembles the true church in the book of Acts and the signs that Jesus said would follow True Believers in Mark chapter 16 such as speaking in tongues Healing The Sick and casting out Devils all of these are missing from many congregations in conclusion we believe we have presented enough proof in this short video to make you aware of God's true end time Prophet brother William brandham as the Bible commanded in Deuteronomy 18: 20-22 we have recognized William brandham as a genuine prophet and are now fearing or listening to his bible-based message from God it is not enough to just recognize a prophet of God God wants us to listen to his Prophet for that will help us understand God's words through the help of the Holy Spirit it will help us live what the Bible teaches and love God with all of our heart soul mind and strength will you take some time and listen to the sermons of William brandham we believe that if you do you will hear many inspired truths from God's word that will help you recognize that we are living in the last days and also live a transformed life like God has helped all of us to live we pray you two will recognize God's prophet and then love God with your entire being as we are taught in 2 Chronicles 20:20 believe in the Lord your God so shall shall you be established believe as prophets so shall you prosper if you would like more Bible teaching about the ministry of Jesus Christ in the life of William brandham or if you'd like to learn more about the ministry of Jesus Christ in the akran area today please contact us God bless you
