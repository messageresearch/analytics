[0:03] what is the rapture the rapture is the
[0:07] secret and unknown day an hour when
[0:09] Jesus's physical body comes down from
[0:11] heaven stops in the clouds and then
[0:14] resurrects all the dead Christians first
[0:16] with his voice the Bible says the dead
[0:19] in Christ resurrect first the Christians
[0:22] who died during the last 2,000 years of
[0:24] church ages then Christ changes the
[0:27] bodies of the living Holy Ghost fill
[0:29] Christians into incorruptible bodies at
[0:32] the last Trump so that both the dead in
[0:35] Christ and living Christians can ascend
[0:37] into the sky
[0:38] and be caught up together in the clouds
[0:40] to meet Jesus in the air the Greek word
[0:44] for caught up means to seize carry off
[0:48] by force to seize on claim for oneself
[0:51] eagerly to snatch out or away at the
[0:56] rapture Jesus ceases or snatches away
[0:58] his bride his wife and then takes these
[1:01] Christians to heaven or the father's
[1:03] Kingdom with him for a wedding or
[1:05] marriage supper while the inhabitants of
[1:08] the earth are being judged and tormented
[1:10] for their sins and rejection of the
[1:12] gospel during the Great Tribulation
[1:14] Period who is the rapture for the
[1:18] rapture is only for Jesus Christ's bride
[1:20] or wife those Holy Ghost fil Christians
[1:23] who have loved and faithfully served
[1:25] Jesus Christ over the past 2,000 years
[1:28] including the dead and those believers
[1:30] currently living the rapture is a
[1:33] meeting in the air of the Holy Ghost
[1:35] filled saints and is the physical union
[1:37] of Christ corporal body and his bride or
[1:40] church in other words the rapture is
[1:42] like the physical wedding ceremony where
[1:44] the physical bodies of the bride and
[1:46] groom are United after the rapture Jesus
[1:49] will then take his wife to the marriage
[1:51] supper of the Lamb according to
[1:52] revelation 19 7 through 9 which is
[1:55] likened unto a wedding reception in
[1:57] today's culture that immediately follows
[1:59] the wedding ceremony but in order to be
[2:03] a part of the rapture the physical union
[2:05] or wedding ceremony with Christ you must
[2:07] first be united to Christ by an
[2:09] invisible union which is the baptism of
[2:11] the Holy Ghost when a person is
[2:14] by the baptism of the holy ghost the
[2:16] believer is sealed unto the day of his
[2:17] Redemption according to Ephesians 4:30
[2:20] and will always be a part of the body of
[2:21] Christ
[2:22] this invisible union or baptism of the
[2:25] Holy Ghost can be likened unto the
[2:27] engagement or a spousal act of an
[2:29] earthly couple today scripture clearly
[2:32] teaches of this invisible union as
[2:34] Romans 7 verse 4 says that ye should be
[2:36] married to another even to him who is
[2:39] raised from the dead that we should
[2:40] bring forth fruit unto God st. Paul
[2:43] further supports this truth in 2nd
[2:45] Corinthians 11 verse 2 saying frybo
[2:48] spouse or engaged you to one husband
[2:52] that I may present you as a chaste
[2:54] virgin to Christ so we strongly urge you
[2:57] and admonish you to be sure you are born
[2:59] again baptized with the Holy Ghost
[3:02] that you may be a part of Jesus's bride
[3:04] with the evidence that Jesus said every
[3:06] true believer would have being led into
[3:08] all truth by the Holy Ghost according to
[3:11] John 16:13 please see our video the
[3:14] evidence of the Holy Ghost according to
[3:15] Jesus for more teaching on this major
[3:18] doctrine this truth of Holy Ghost filled
[3:22] believers as the brighter wife of Christ
[3:24] is plainly taught in Scripture beginning
[3:26] in Ephesians 5 verses 22 to 32 which
[3:30] tells us that a husband and wife are
[3:31] symbolic of Christ and the church John
[3:34] the Baptist called Jesus the bridegroom
[3:36] in John 329th in revelation 19 verses 7
[3:40] through 9 tells us that Jesus's marriage
[3:42] is coming and his wife hath made herself
[3:45] ready revelation 19 verse 8 speaks of
[3:49] Jesus's wife or the true church being
[3:51] arrayed in fine linen clean and white
[3:53] which is the righteousness of saints
[3:55] this righteousness is that of Christ and
[3:58] not of our own through his washing of
[4:01] regeneration and renewing of the Holy
[4:03] Ghost according to Titus 3 verse 5 this
[4:08] symbolism of the bride having specific
[4:10] clothing or garments was also taught by
[4:13] Jesus in his parable in Matthew 22
[4:15] verses 1 to 14 Jesus taught the kingdom
[4:18] of heaven was like a king which made a
[4:20] marriage for his son when the king came
[4:23] in to see the guests gathered for the
[4:25] wedding
[4:25] he found a man that did
[4:26] to have the wedding garment the man
[4:29] without the garment was bound and cast
[4:30] into outer darkness where there was
[4:32] weeping gnashing of teeth which reminds
[4:36] us of Jesus's other words that the
[4:38] garment of true believers is the power
[4:40] of the Holy Ghost jesus told His
[4:42] disciples to tarry in Jerusalem until
[4:44] they were endued or clothed with power
[4:46] from on high according to Luke 24 verse
[4:49] 49 meaning that once they receive the
[4:52] baptism of the Holy Ghost which was
[4:54] recorded in acts 2 verse 4 they would
[4:57] have spiritual clothing or power to be
[4:59] true witnesses for Christ this teaches
[5:02] that all those without the powerful
[5:04] clothing of the baptism of the Holy
[5:06] Ghost will not be a part of the wedding
[5:08] of Jesus Christ Jesus told a second
[5:12] parable that taught that the rapture or
[5:14] his wedding would only be for Holy Ghost
[5:16] fill Christians Jesus called the
[5:18] raptured group the wise virgins in
[5:20] Matthew 25 verses 1 to 13 in the parable
[5:24] only the wise virgins had oil and were
[5:27] ready for the wedding of the bridegroom
[5:28] the foolish virgins had no oil and
[5:31] therefore they were shut out of the
[5:33] marriage this proves that only those
[5:36] with the Holy Ghost baptism will be a
[5:38] part of the marriage of Jesus Christ and
[5:40] his bride the Bible teaches that oil is
[5:43] a symbol of the Holy Ghost as seen in
[5:45] Zechariah chapter 4 two olive branches
[5:48] empty oil out of themselves into the
[5:51] seven pipes and lamps of the golden
[5:53] candlestick which oil the angel caused
[5:55] the anointing in Zechariah 4:14 which
[5:58] was earlier called the spear in verse 6
[6:00] of chapter 4 the Holy Spirit is always
[6:03] referred to as the anointing as seen in
[6:05] acts 10 verse 38 as Jesus was anointed
[6:08] with the Holy Ghost and with power a
[6:12] true Holy Ghost filled Christian is in
[6:14] Christ or born again of the Spirit of
[6:17] God or else he is none of his or not his
[6:19] bride her wife according to Romans 8
[6:22] verse 9 being born again is the seal of
[6:25] the Holy Ghost unto the day of
[6:26] redemption meaning that a real
[6:28] spirit-filled Christian does not love
[6:30] the world and backside into many lusts
[6:33] and pleasures true Christians seek to
[6:35] perfect holiness in the fear of God
[6:37] according to 2nd Corinthians 7 verse
[6:41] [Music]
