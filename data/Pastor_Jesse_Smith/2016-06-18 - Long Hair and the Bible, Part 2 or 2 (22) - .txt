Part 2 of this teaching series begins with truth about God's desire for hair length in the Old Testament. God never asked a godly woman in the Old Testament to cut her hair. Second, history teaches that the majority ofAmerican  women never cut their hair until the Roaring 20s, or 1920s. Last, quotations from God's prophet, William Branham (1909-1965) are presented on the topic of hair length and the Bible.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Old Testament teaching on hair length in the Old Testament we once again find the indisputable truth that God never asked a godly Jewish woman to cut her hair so we conclude that st. Paul's teaching from the New Testament must have been in complete harmony with God's desire for hair length in the Old Testament some Bible readers may be familiar with the Nazarite vow from Numbers chapter 6 verses 1 through 21 part of this vow was for the dedicated individual a man in this case to not cut his hair for a period of time uncut hair was a sign of total consecration or dedication to God in this vow we cannot find an example of a woman under a Nazarite vow ever cutting her hair so it would seem that only men were to cut their hair at the conclusion of their Nazarite vow it seems women in the terms of their hair were under a lifelong Nazarite vow meaning they were to never cut their hair just as God commands in the New Testament we believe God has always asked all godly women whether Jewish or Christian to do the same leave their hair uncut as a sign of total consecration and dedication to the plan of God keeping her husband as her ruler over her we believe that all Christian women are under a similar total consecration to God to not cut their hair in order to display the New Testament teaching on headship based upon the New Testament text we have already covered we believe it is the Bible command of God Himself that all Christian women let their hair grow long and uncut furthermore as you read deeper in the Old Testament there are two specific cases in the Old Testament where God did command the cutting of hair but it was never a command given to godly Jewish women such as Sarah Rebecca Abigail Esther and the like so we do not believe these two examples pertain to consecrated Christian women today the first example is from Deuteronomy chapter 21 verses 10 through 13 Moses commanded that Israelite men were to have their new wives taken from captivity after war with an enemy nation shave their own heads as part of their transition into the Jewish religion and culture the second example is from Jeremiah 7 verses 28 through 30 God speaks to Jerusalem the capital of the nation of Israel and operates them for their disobedience rebellion and abominable acts God said cut off thine hair o Jerusalem and cast it away and take up a lamentation on high places for the LORD hath rejected and forsaken the generation of his wrath it is difficult to tell if God is speaking literally to every man and woman or just men or just women in this case and it is possible that this is just figurative language where God is speaking to the entire people one thing is for sure God told them to cut off their hair because he was rejecting and forsaking this generation due to their wickedness and abominable acts let us today live such godly lives that God will not reject us we can start by obeying God's commands on different hair lengths for men and women so we again conclude that God never asked an obedient faithful godly Jewish woman to ever cut her hair for the sake of fashion convenience style or beauty as women believe they can today the Bible is clear that all women are to have long uncut hair as a sign that they are under the headship of their husbands and Christ and United States history of hair length from the beginning of our nation the United States most American women obeyed the Bible and kept their hair long and uncut until the 1920s the Roaring Twenties marked the ending to appear in in which women kept the glory God gave them the 1920s was the first time the majority of American women rejected the glory of God that God designed specifically for them in dressed for the occasion me and Miller wrote the new decade of the roaring 20s transform young women's fashion as never before for the first time women grabbed their long hair which had always been so time-consuming to style and snipped it off bobbed hair was all the rage the boyish Bob was chin length or even shorter in understanding fashion Elizabeth R wrote the extreme of the 1920's style was the short straight sleeveless v necked Jimmy's dress worn with the net cliche over short hair for not only wear women's clothes changing many women now had short hair and wore makeup in the article short hair short career by Ethel Williamson it says after World War one ended big changes were afoot not only had woman won the right to vote but dancer Irene castle had bobbed her hair as the 1920s roared in more and more women headed for beauty shops to have their hair bobbed at the time few women were eager to have their bobs done in a barbershop with a row of men watching and snickering in many cases this would be the biggest decision the woman would ever make to cut off a lifetime growth of hair knowing her husband father or boyfriend was dead set against it how sad and disgraceful that our nation fell from the godly standards it once held and women began despising the glory of long hair that God reserved for them but there is a small remnant of Holy Ghost field Christian women today that still honor the Bible and wear their hair the way God wants it a prophet restores truth on hair length as our website and previous video state we believe God's in a genuine Bible based prophet to this earth by the name of William Branham since brother Branham was a Bible based prophet God led him to preach and teach repeatedly on the Bible truth that men and women should honor God with their hair length based upon 1st Corinthians 11 verse 1 through 16 this Bible based teaching was a restoration of the truth of the Bible that Christians had honored for centuries but now has been rejected in the churches of the Western civilization since the roaring 20s or 1920s let's listen to this prophet of God teach and restore the truth of the Bible to the people of God in regards to hair length cut the hair what they gonna do a hair to a woman is a mess right back on there's arrived is one that is consecrated more a perfect Samson must consecrated to age into a purpose therefore he had long hair the woman that's a child of God let your hair grow - or she's consecrated to every word of God this prophet was also constrained by God to warn the people of the haunting that would take place during the Tribulation Period because the world and churches rejected the truth about the Prophet goes on to encourage our Christian sisters to wear their crown of glory long uncut hair just as Christ were crown of thorns for us all we see that go down streets mu ladies as long hair said he's old-fashioned remember that's scholars that's a crown that you're wearing Godse was your glory man has pride why am i prime she was wearing kind of floors for your law where was pried open shamed in conclusion we pray that you will consider all the Bible and historical evidence that we have presented in this video and if you are a true Christian man we pray you will begin cutting your hair frequently so as not to bring shame upon yourself and your head the Lord Jesus if you are a true Christian woman our prayers that you will now let your hair grow long and uncut for the rest of your consecrated walk with the Lord Jesus that your obedience will bring honor to your husband and to Christ we want to encourage all viewers to search the Scriptures and see if you can present any Scripture in which God asks a godly Jewish or Christian woman to cut their hair we will humbly repent and change our doctrine if we can be proved wrong by the Word of God alone but we believe you will find that God never asked any godly woman to cut her hair just as God never asked anyone to wear makeup just as no believer in the book of Acts was ever baptized with sprinkling or the titles father son Holy Ghost were never called apollon at one single baptism just as God never said he was three separate distinct or co-equal persons may each of us humbly learn to live by every word of God in the Bible which will keep the anointing of the Holy Ghost upon us that the glory of God not depart from our lives our homes and our churches if you would like more bible
