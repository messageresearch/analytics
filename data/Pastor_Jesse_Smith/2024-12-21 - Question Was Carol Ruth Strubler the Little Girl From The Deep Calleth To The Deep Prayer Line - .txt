TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] God bless you the little girl with tremendous Faith be well God bless you hone go you greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this vide is to answer a viewer's question did the leukemia stricken little girl die after brother Brandon prayed for her in the 1954 deep call to the Deep sermon my answer is I don't know because I wasn't alive in 19 1954 but some accusers of brother brandom are claiming the little girl died and that her name was Carol Ruth strubler and somehow this makes brother brandom a false prophet of course I believe brother brandom was a genuine prophet of God so this video is defending The Godly Christian character of God's Prophet brother William Marian Bram hi friends I'm Jesse Smith pastor brde to Christ Fellowship here in akan Ohio USA and I defend the original Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ that he revealed to St Paul and then had to restore through Martin Luther John Wesley and and the prophet of God brother William Marin brandham so this video is defending The Godly Christian character of brother William Marin brandham and whether this little girl was healed or died it does not prove brother Brandon was a false prophet brother Brandon was a genuine prophet of God and I'll be giving five important points to remember about this situation in this video let's begin with the video from the deep call under the Deep from Washington DC 1954 a mother brings a little girl into the prayer line and brother brandom has discernment and sees that she has leukemia he prays for her he rebukes and adjures Satan and says the girl has tremendous Faith let's watch the video do you believe me to be God's Prophet is I mean well a prophet is a preacher you don't expect me to be of the enemy you expect me to be of God is that's way you accept it well then I can help you for he told me if I would get the people to believe believe me and be sincere when I prayed that nothing would stand before the prayer and now it isn't Uh I that help it's God that does the healing I question I said they won't believe me he said there'll be two signs given to you as was to the prophet Moses in this the people will believe and one of them was to reveal the secrets of the hearts of the people to them now you're not here for yourself although you're nervous and run down but it's been caused by a disease of this child this child here is suffering it's been turned down by the doctors to die it's leukemia isn't that right you've brought the child from out of town you've traveled coming from the West coming east you have come you've come from a a state that has mountains it's Pennsylvania and your city I believe it's Chambersburg or isn't that right right bring the child to me little sister dear the Lord Jesus was here he' lay his hands up on you and death would leave you and you'd live do you believe that I am his servant then in his stead I Lay My Hands on this child and bless it and ask that the demon leaves the child and that life comes to the child and it will live and be well come out of the child Satan by the authority of God's Bible with a Divine gift ministered by an Angel I adure Thee to leave the child come from you believe you're going to get well God bless you turn around wave for the audience God bless you the little girl with tremendous Faith be well God bless you honey go you're right do you believe me is his Pro now that we've seen the video let's look at five important points to remember first if this little girl was healed that would be another powerful testimony to go along with all the other Miracles God performed through brother Ram's Ministry there are many testimonies of God answering brother Ram's prayers for healing such as Congressman Upshaw Florence Humes who was healed of tuberculosis who I met in North Carolina Marilyn Hickey who had a thus say the Lord she'd have a child and she did 10 years later Georgie Carter Hattie waldrup Banks Woods wife and son Ernest farmer and Max Manning a preacher who A friend of mine has met and brother R prayed for him when he was in the hospital and he's alive to this day so no doubt brother brand had genuine gifts of God and God himself Vindicated brother brandham as a genuine prophet of God so the second point is that if this little girl was not healed and this little girl was indeed Carol Ruth strubler then this would be a very heartbreaking story at least from the human perspective similar to other stories when God allows death to happen such as in the case of job losing all of his children to Satan when Satan brought a great wind to destroy the house of job's oldest son and it crushed all of job's children from Job 1 verse 19 I think this story relates to the topic of this video because job had prayed and made sacrifices to sanctify or dedicate his children to God according to job 1:5 in case his children had sinned so we see a prophet of God job making intercession for his children and yet God allowed these children to die this is very similar to brother BR praying for this child if in fact this child did die and yet God took the child home and so in moments when God doesn't answer our prayers our faith is tested and tried but our faith is made stronger we go from Faith to Faith Peter said in 1 Peter 1:7 that this is the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth although our hearts can be broken when our prayers are answered our faith is strengthened it's refined like gold being refined in the fire I'd like to tie in another story from Brother bram's Ministry that kind of ties in here with the job situation and also with this situation with Carol Ruth strubler if in fact this little girl was the one that died and brother brand had prayed for her remember sister stad cleff from Germany in the sermon the Messiah 1961 January 17th brother Ram tells the story of sister stad her baby had died but she had seen the baby raised from the dead in Mexico so she had faith that if brother BR prayed for her dead baby the baby would come back to life sister stad cff's husband worked in the German military so he had access to use a military plane to fly to get brother brandham and then flying back to Germany to pray for the dead baby in hopes the baby would come back to life but we know brother brandham went and prayed and sought the will of God and the will of God was for the baby to not be raised from the dead brother Bram said God had called your baby home in the quote from brother brandom he said that sister stcl said what was it brother brandham my weakness of faith and brother brandham said you have great faith you prayed for your baby but God refused to do it because he knows what's best and you still love him that's real Faith anybody when mountains are moving and things can have faith but let it go backwards one time and see how it works that's when you prove whether you got faith or not so to me this connects to the the video we watched from the 1954 prayer line when brother Bram said this girl had tremendous Faith this little girl did have tremendous Faith to travel from Pennsylvania to Washington DC to get prayed for and if God did take the child home the child and the mother still had tremendous Faith but it was God's will for the child to go home to be with the Lord let's listen to the quote from the Messiah 1961 and so when she come over to see us and I left her at the house when I left yesterday she said what was it brother bham my my weakness of faith I said you have great faith you prayed for your baby you and your husband held on to God to raise that baby and he refused to do it because he knows what's best and still you love him that's real Faith anybody when mountains are moving and things can have faith but let go backwards one time and see how it works that's when you prove whether you got faith or not every son that cometh to God must be chastened and tried of God so remember our Tri trials Works patience and patience Works hope and so forth so we just hold on to God whether He blesses us or not we are right there to believe him anyhow because he's promises and to see how he does the third point I want to make is that there's apparently articles of Carol Ruth strubler death from a website of one of brother Ram's accusers here are screenshots of those apparent newspaper articles so again friends I don't know that these are legitimate newspaper articles because I wasn't alive in 19 54 now friends these articles could be fabricated and I'm not saying that to be disingenuous or snarky but from my experience some not all of brother Ram's accusers can be extremely dishonest and slanderous this has to be an option for example they slander brother brandham by claiming brother brandham is responsible for Jim Jones's massacre in Guyana South America which is an absolute disgrace brother brandom separated from Jim Jones in 1956 and I have videos proving that Jim Jones left the Christian faith Jim Jones became an absolute heretic demon possessed sexual deviant and yet these Slanders of brother brandham continue to push this propaganda this lie that somehow brother ROM is responsible for the actions of Jim Jones it's a bunch of nonsense another example is some of brother Ram's accusers claim brother random plagiarized the Seven Seals from Lin and Russell that's a lie there's over 38 differences brother Ram taught from Lin and Russell on the Seven Seals and again this is one of the most slanderous outrageous dishonest attacks I've ever heard and shame on these people for slandering brother brandom and claiming he plagiarized he did not plagiarize the Seven Seals the fourth point is that if Carol Ruth strubler was the little girl in the video and she died then that doesn't prove brother random lied if you watch the video again or read the text from the video brother random never said thus sayith the Lord the girl would be healed brother Braham did pray and adure the devil he asked for the demon to leave but he never said she would be well in the name of the Lord or with thus say the Lord Brother Ram did try to adure the devil but even Jesus's own disciples in certain situations could not cast out some demons it seems brother randam was simply asking a blessing on the child as the angel the Lord told him when the angel commissioned him brother Ram talked about this in 1955 how the angel came to me in his commission he said the angel said to just ask a blessing and walk away if the disease doesn't leave and then notice again from the deep call through the Deep quote or video brother Ram never said he saw the demon leave so here's the quote let's listen to it from 1955 it's January 17th and said then just stand quiet and it'll there'll be a physical effect that'll happen on your body and said then you pray and if it leaves the disease is gone from the people if it doesn't leave just ask the blessing and walk away also I want to say I'm sure nearly all honest preachers have likely experienced something similar to what brother brandham may have experienced here if the child in fact did pass away where preachers hope and pray for healing with all of their hearts and they try to rebuke Satan they try to rebuke the sickness but yet the healing doesn't happen so an honest preacher in this case I believe would have compassion on brother brandom doing his best to pray for the sick and The Afflicted hoping for a healing being positive about healing but ultimately the result is left up to almighty God the fifth and final point I want to make is that sometimes men of God spoke things that did not come to pass this means the men of God spoke presumptuously in Hope and not in faith I put out a video about this recently with three or four examples of prophets who made predictions that did not come to pass I'll leave a link in the description to this video for example Jonah said God was going to destroy Nineveh but it did not happen in Jonah 3:4 Isaiah said Hezekiah would die but then God gave him 15 more years 2 Kings 20:1 and David thought in his heart he would surely be killed by Saul in 1st Samuel 27:1 and then some of jesus' disciples and perhaps even Apostles thought John would live to see Jesus's second coming in John 21:23 in closing friends hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God when I was asked this question I had never really study this topic before so I did the best I could on short notice to study this topic and again I wasn't there in 1954 I don't know anyone who was there in 1954 that could confirm these newspaper stories about the little girl Carol Ruth strubler but either way brother BR was not at fault brother Bram did not speak anything wrong in the name of the Lord and we know God honored his gift of healing and discernment many many times by the grace of God and again as 1 Peter 1 verse 7 says God is going to allow our faith to be tried he's going to let us go through difficult times difficult Seasons difficult situations to refine our faith to make it more strong more sincere more like the faith of the Son of God this reminds us of the prayer of the Lord Jesus in The Garden of Gethsemane when he got the victory through prayer saying not my will but thy will be done and we know brother Ram said and many preachers believe Jesus got the victory there through prayer that allowed him to go to the cross and suffer that we might be saved so praise the Lord Jesus Christ for his humility his obedience to the father his willingness to die for the joy that was set before and now we get to live with Jesus Christ eternally if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
