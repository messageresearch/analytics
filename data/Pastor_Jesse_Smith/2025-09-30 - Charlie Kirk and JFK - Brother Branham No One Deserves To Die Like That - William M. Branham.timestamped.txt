[0:00] [Music]
[0:03] Oh, I disagreed with the man in his
[0:05] politics and in his religion, but yet he
[0:08] doesn't deserve to die like that. No,
[0:11] &gt;&gt; a mass is hoping it so. A communion is
[0:14] knowing it's so and thanking for it.
[0:15] See, and that is the only thing that
[0:17] they cannot get together. They'll do it.
[0:21] &gt;&gt; Greetings, friends, in the matchless
[0:22] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The
[0:25] purpose of this video is to give my
[0:26] reaction to the assassination of Charlie
[0:29] Kirk. I was asked about this in an email
[0:31] and so I thought I'd make a video on it
[0:33] by the grace of God. My initial reaction
[0:36] was great sadness, grieving for
[0:38] Charlie's wife and two children, his
[0:41] friends, family, employees. And then one
[0:44] of my first thoughts was Charlie didn't
[0:46] deserve this because I'd heard brother
[0:48] Brandham say that about the
[0:49] assassination of JFK. So, by God's
[0:52] grace, let's look at the assassination
[0:54] of JFK and what God's prophet, Brother
[0:57] Brandham, said about it. And you'll see
[0:59] how Brother Brandham was extremely
[1:01] gracious to JFK and his wife Jacqueline.
[1:04] And we can learn that this is the type
[1:05] of reaction we should have as Holy Ghost
[1:07] fililled Christians when tragedy
[1:09] strikes. We should grieve. We should
[1:11] mourn. We should be sad. But also
[1:13] remember that God allowed this. And the
[1:15] Bible says, "Blessed are they who mourn
[1:17] for they shall be comforted." So, we'll
[1:19] start with these quotes from God's
[1:20] prophet, Brother Brandham, on JFK, and
[1:23] then I'll give some reactions to Charlie
[1:25] Kirk's assassination as well.
[1:29] So, by God's grace, Brother Random
[1:30] reacted to the assassination of JFK on
[1:34] November 24th, 1963 when he preached,
[1:36] "What shall I do with Jesus called
[1:39] Christ?" And brother Random said, quote,
[1:41] "When I heard of the murder of President
[1:43] Kennedy, this message fell on my heart.
[1:45] I thought, what will that man do? no way
[1:48] out of it now. He might have woken up by
[1:50] this time and realized what lays ahead.
[1:53] End quote. So, it is very touching to
[1:55] see how God's prophet was sensitive to
[1:58] the Holy Spirit to feel what God put on
[2:00] his heart. And he preached a sermon in
[2:03] reaction to the assassination of
[2:06] President Kennedy. Now, that quote was
[2:08] taken towards the end of the service in
[2:10] paragraph 157. So, we'll go back to the
[2:13] beginning of the sermon. Right after he
[2:15] greets the people in the second
[2:16] paragraph all the way through the 14th
[2:19] paragraph, Brother Ram talks about this
[2:21] before he takes his text and preaches
[2:23] the sermon. So, we'll take it a couple
[2:24] paragraphs at a time here, Lord willing.
[2:27] In paragraph number two, Brother Ram
[2:29] said, "I'm sure we're all aware of the
[2:31] great sadness that's happened, the loss
[2:33] of our president, though I disagreed
[2:35] with the man in his politics and his
[2:37] religion, but yet he doesn't deserve to
[2:39] die like that." And that's the one of
[2:40] the first thoughts that came to my mind
[2:42] as I was driving home on September 10th,
[2:45] 2025. I thought this man didn't deserve
[2:48] to die like this. He said, "And leave
[2:51] those little children behind and no
[2:53] daddy and a mother." Mrs. Kennedy,
[2:55] though I certainly wouldn't agree with
[2:57] her and her ways and things, but maybe.
[2:59] Remember, she's a mother. She's just
[3:01] lost her babies and she lost her husband
[3:03] and he fell right into her lap. So,
[3:05] brother Bram's first reaction is great
[3:08] sadness and he feels for the loss of the
[3:11] family. Despite his differences in
[3:13] politics and religion, brother Bram felt
[3:14] a great sadness for the Kennedy family.
[3:17] In paragraph number three, Brother Ram
[3:19] talked about Mrs. Kennedy. He said, "But
[3:21] did you know Mrs. Kennedy never did hear
[3:23] one of these messages I preach about
[3:25] that if she might hear one of them, she
[3:27] might do different?" So, Brother
[3:30] Brandham has compassion upon Mrs.
[3:32] Kennedy. her fashions led the nation.
[3:35] But yet, brother Brandham thought, "What
[3:36] if she would just hear one of these
[3:37] message? Maybe it would change your
[3:39] heart." That's the hope of the believer.
[3:41] The hope that sinners or those who don't
[3:43] know the full gospel of Jesus Christ
[3:45] could hear the full gospel of Jesus
[3:47] Christ to know that modesty is commanded
[3:49] in the New Testament in 1 Timothy
[3:50] chapter 2. And of course, makeup is
[3:52] condemned all throughout the Old
[3:54] Testament. But it's the loving hope in a
[3:56] believer's heart. As the scripture says,
[3:58] God is not willing that any should
[4:00] perish. 2 Peter 3:9,
[4:03] "Not willing that any should perish, but
[4:05] that all should come to repentance." So,
[4:06] we see Brother Ram has the same heart as
[4:08] God because the Holy Ghost, God's spirit
[4:10] was in brother Ram's heart. He desired
[4:13] to see Mrs. Kennedy change her ways.
[4:16] Brother Ram said, "Mrs. Kennedy was
[4:18] raised Catholic. That's all she knows.
[4:20] That's a system. Nothing against the
[4:21] people, but it's the Catholic system
[4:24] like any other system, Presbyterian,
[4:26] Methodist, Pentecostal.
[4:28] It's the system, not the people." Then
[4:31] he goes back to President Kennedy. Mr.
[4:33] Kennedy, I think done a good job of
[4:35] being president. My heart goes out for
[4:37] his wife. I feel real sad about it that
[4:40] even our nation, the hoodlams, would do
[4:43] a thing like that. So here we can see
[4:46] brother Random could recognize Kennedy
[4:48] as a president who did some good. Just
[4:51] like today, we can see how President
[4:52] Trump does some good, but we're not
[4:54] saying he's saved. It seems like from
[4:56] his own words, he's not even certain
[4:58] that he's saved. So, he's likely not
[4:59] saved, but let's hope for the best.
[5:02] Let's hope that he can repent of his
[5:03] sins. Just like Brother Ram hoped Mrs.
[5:06] Kennedy would repent of her sins and
[5:08] live a better godly life. In paragraph
[5:11] 5, Brother Random said there's no reason
[5:13] to kill another man if you disagree with
[5:15] the person because now those children
[5:17] have no daddy. Daddy's gone. Then,
[5:20] Brother Ram says he can relate to this
[5:22] to some degree. He said, "I've always
[5:23] thought that would be my state someday."
[5:25] So, Brother Ram thought he would be
[5:26] assassinated. He also talked about that
[5:28] in Souls in Prison 1963. A sister had a
[5:31] dream and the Holy Spirit said, "Brother
[5:32] Brandon would be fired upon getting out
[5:35] of a vehicle." And Brother Brham said,
[5:36] "Uh-huh." So, Brother Bram thought that
[5:37] would happen. Brother Ram said, "It's
[5:40] almost happened several times, as you
[5:41] know, of being shot in foreign nations
[5:43] when they've had to hold their bodies
[5:44] over me. Keep me from being shot at a
[5:48] distance." In paragraph 6, brother Ram
[5:50] talked about the glory that goes along
[5:52] with being a president and the average
[5:54] between presidents and those that have
[5:56] been assassinated. Brother Ram said,
[5:58] "It's a shame that a person in America
[6:00] would do such a thing as that." In
[6:02] paragraph 7, I disagree with his
[6:04] politics, but you see, he's another man.
[6:07] I didn't agree with his system of
[6:08] religion, but he was raised that way. He
[6:11] said maybe if he'd heard something
[6:13] different, it might have been different.
[6:15] So I love how brother Brandham desired
[6:17] for President Kennedy to hear the
[6:19] message of the hour, the baptism of the
[6:21] Holy Ghost, the truth of God's word to
[6:23] bring him out of that Catholic system,
[6:24] the mother harlot system. In paragraph
[6:27] 8, brother Random said, "We have a thing
[6:30] we do here whenever our people dies."
[6:33] And he's going to get to praying for the
[6:35] Kennedy family. So he made that a
[6:37] tradition in his church. They would pray
[6:39] for the families that had loved ones
[6:42] pass away. Then brother Ram says also in
[6:44] paragraph 8 he said I didn't vote for
[6:46] Kennedy I voted for Mr. Nixon. So some
[6:49] people say brother Ram never voted. Well
[6:51] he says right here I voted for Mr. Nixon
[6:53] because he knew him personally. There's
[6:55] a picture of that brother Ram sitting at
[6:57] a breakfast and I think it was Vice
[6:59] President Nixon at the time was talking
[7:01] but there's a picture of Brother Random
[7:02] with Vice President Nixon if I'm not
[7:04] mistaken. Brother Ram said he voted for
[7:06] him because he liked him. Speaking of
[7:07] Nixon then he talked about though how
[7:10] Kennedy was elected and the way they did
[7:11] it. Well, that's up between them and
[7:13] God, but that's not much. So, Brother
[7:15] Ram was even questioning the election
[7:18] integrity of when Kennedy was elected.
[7:20] But he said, even if there was election
[7:23] issues, that's between them and God. In
[7:25] paragraph 9, Brother Brandham says, for
[7:28] the sake of the mother, couldn't we just
[7:31] stand a moment in prayer for her? And
[7:34] then in paragraph 10, he prays to the
[7:35] Lord Jesus. We have a feeling for one
[7:37] another. We're sorry that the president
[7:39] was shot down. We're sorry that our
[7:41] nation has come to this spot. Then in
[7:43] verse 11, we pray for Mrs. Kennedy, that
[7:45] wife of his. Then he says in paragraph
[7:48] 12, though we might disagree with the
[7:50] woman being in the wrong as far as her
[7:52] fashions, he says, may there be a time
[7:54] in this deep bereiement, that shall find
[7:56] what is truth, Jesus Christ. Grant,
[7:59] Lord, the one who only can give peace
[8:02] and comfort in the hour of trouble. So
[8:04] brother B prays for peace and comfort
[8:05] from the Lord Jesus for Mrs. Kennedy.
[8:08] And then brother Brandham finishes the
[8:10] prayer in paragraph 13. Now he prays for
[8:13] the congregation. Help us Lord with all
[8:16] of our hearts to be a shining light. We
[8:18] don't know what time or what influence
[8:19] we might have upon somebody else. Let us
[8:22] shine forth the light of Christ until he
[8:24] comes. Then the great shepherd who knows
[8:26] all justice will bring every sin into
[8:28] recompense. So when someone's
[8:30] assassinated, we just have to trust in
[8:31] God that justice will be done and God
[8:34] will know just how to do it. Until then,
[8:37] we commit ourselves into your hands for
[8:39] your love and mercy upon us in Jesus'
[8:41] name. Amen. And then before he takes his
[8:43] text, he has one more paragraph in
[8:45] paragraph 14. Yes, I don't think no man
[8:48] deserves to die like that. Lincoln
[8:49] didn't deserve that. Mr. McKinley didn't
[8:51] deserve that. None of them fellows
[8:54] murderers. That's bad. Our boys didn't
[8:56] fight overseas for something like that.
[8:58] He says that's sin.
[9:01] And then a few times in the sermon, he
[9:03] again mentions uh President Kennedy. I
[9:05] don't have this paragraph number, but he
[9:07] says, "The president, not the man. As
[9:09] far as I know, he's a good man. He's
[9:11] never done anything evil as I know of."
[9:15] So again, brother's very gracious
[9:16] towards President Kennedy. Now, it's
[9:18] come out in all these years since
[9:20] Kennedy's death that Kennedy seemed to
[9:22] have a lot of adulteries, which is
[9:24] extremely wicked and sad. We hope he
[9:26] repented of them before he was
[9:28] assassinated, but we don't know. So, we
[9:30] can just commit it into the hands of
[9:32] God. But look how gracious brother Ram
[9:34] was to President Kennedy not knowing
[9:37] what he was doing behind the scenes
[9:39] perhaps. Then in paragraph 153, Brother
[9:42] Ram talks about the blood of President
[9:43] Kennedy being on Oswald's hands. And
[9:46] then of course, Brother Ram brings that
[9:48] down to us. What are we going to do with
[9:49] the blood of Jesus Christ on our hands?
[9:51] And brother Ram says, "The only thing
[9:52] you can do is put it on your heart.
[9:54] Repent of your sins. Tell Jesus you're
[9:56] sorry for all your sins. And if you do
[9:59] that, if you confess Jesus Christ with
[10:01] your mouth, repent of your sins, he will
[10:02] pardon all your transgressions, he's
[10:04] faithful and just to forgive us of all
[10:06] unrighteousness. Jesus Christ died with
[10:09] our sins upon him. He became sin that we
[10:12] might become his righteousness. And then
[10:14] if we receive the grace of God, shall we
[10:15] continue in sin that grace may abound?
[10:17] God forbid. The grace of God will lead
[10:19] us into sanctification and the baptism
[10:22] of the Holy Ghost. So now my reaction to
[10:25] Charlie Kirk's passing. I feel a lot of
[10:27] the same feelings that Brother Ram felt.
[10:29] I cried numerous times just on my knees
[10:32] at night in prayer praying for Charlie
[10:34] Kirk's family. I watched a little bit of
[10:37] Charlie Kirk and I was always blessed by
[10:39] his wisdom, his ability to debate. I
[10:42] appreciated his conservative political
[10:44] values of pro-life, closed borders, and
[10:47] I liked how he presented the gospel in
[10:49] many of his debates on college campuses.
[10:52] I admire him because he went inside the
[10:54] college campuses and changed many
[10:56] hearts. Charlie did not claim to be a
[10:59] preacher, but he did what Jesus told his
[11:01] disciples in Matthew 10. I send you
[11:04] forth as sheep in the midst of wolves.
[11:06] Be therefore wise as serpents and
[11:08] harmless as doves. Luke 10:3, "Go your
[11:11] ways. Behold, I send you forth as lambs
[11:13] among wolves." Charlie always used
[11:15] kindness with those that opposed him,
[11:17] even when they called him names or
[11:19] mocked him, as far as what I've seen. So
[11:21] I greatly respect that type of courage
[11:24] to go right into we'd say the lion's den
[11:27] and try to convert the unconverted. It
[11:30] seems like he had some success. So we
[11:32] rejoice in that by the grace of God
[11:34] trusting some people were saved. I know
[11:36] even when I was on the University of
[11:38] Akran campus from 1999 to 2004. I always
[11:42] greatly respected the preachers who
[11:43] stood up there and preached on campus
[11:45] trying to convict hearts. I admired
[11:48] their courage. I admired their faith. As
[11:50] far as I knew, their hearts were
[11:51] sincere. Only God knows the hearts of
[11:53] all men, but that takes a certain type
[11:55] of gift, a certain type of courage, a
[11:58] holy boldness. So, I certainly admired
[12:01] that and appreciated that about Charlie
[12:03] Kirk. Now, we know the Bible revelation
[12:05] that God gave to William Brandham. He
[12:07] showed us there's two types of believers
[12:09] that are saved. There's two types that
[12:10] are lost. This is in the church age
[12:12] book. It's an undeniable biblical truth.
[12:15] I have a figure on this in my 2021 book.
[12:18] Two kinds of believers, two kinds of
[12:20] lost groups. In Matthew 25 1-13, Jesus
[12:25] calls them wise virgins, foolish
[12:27] virgins. They're both virgins, so
[12:28] they're both saved. But one will make
[12:30] the rapture and one won't because one
[12:32] lacked the baptism of the Holy Ghost,
[12:34] the oil, the full word of God, the full
[12:36] revelation of the Bible. And Matthew
[12:39] 13:18-23
[12:42] shows the four kinds of hearts. good,
[12:44] thorny, stony wayside. The good would be
[12:47] the wise virgins. The thorny would be
[12:49] the foolish virgins. Stony would be like
[12:52] the Judas, a scary group that leave the
[12:54] truth. Wayside are those who never
[12:56] believed in Christ to begin with. We see
[12:58] this in a foreshadow in the Old
[13:01] Testament. Abraham, wise virgin, Lot,
[13:03] foolish virgin. Mrs. Lot, the stony
[13:06] ground. Sodommites were like the
[13:07] wayside. But the ram said there wasn't
[13:09] three crosses, there was four crosses or
[13:11] four deaths when Jesus was crucified.
[13:14] Jesus represents the wise virgin, the
[13:16] saved thief, the foolish. Judas was the
[13:18] stony ground. And then the wayside was
[13:21] like the lost thief who never believed
[13:22] in Christ. 2 Timothy 2:20 shows the four
[13:26] types of vessels. Gold would be the wise
[13:28] virgin. Silver the foolish virgin. Wood
[13:32] would be the stony ground. Judas the
[13:33] scar group. And earth would be the
[13:35] wayside. And Revelation 22:11 shows the
[13:38] four classes as well. Holy would be the
[13:40] Holy Ghost fil or the wise virgin.
[13:43] Righteous would be the foolish virgin.
[13:45] Filthy, the Judas or Mrs. Lot group. And
[13:48] the unjust would be the wayside or the
[13:50] lost group.
[13:52] Remember friends, Job 1 22 says, "The
[13:55] Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away.
[13:57] Blessed be the name of the Lord."
[13:58] Brother Ram used Romans 8:28. Whenever
[14:01] unexpected deaths happen, tragedies
[14:03] happen. We know all things work together
[14:05] for good to them that love God, to them
[14:06] who are the called according to his
[14:09] purpose. The Bible says our days are
[14:11] numbered. So Charlie Kirk's days were
[14:12] numbered just like JFK's days were
[14:15] numbered. Brother Ram's days were
[14:16] numbered this week. Vodie Bacham also
[14:18] passed away, which I disagree with him
[14:20] on a lot of his doctrine, but I
[14:21] appreciate his love for Jesus Christ. He
[14:23] died at 56, just like brother Ram passed
[14:25] away at 56. But God has each one of our
[14:28] days numbered according to Job 14:5.
[14:31] Seeing his days are determined. The
[14:32] number of his months are with thee. Thou
[14:34] hast appointed the bounds that he cannot
[14:36] pass. Friends, my days are numbered.
[14:39] Your days are numbered. All of our days
[14:41] are numbered by Almighty God. So let's
[14:44] redeem the time because the days are
[14:46] evil. None of us know when the Lord will
[14:48] call us home. So we want to be ready. We
[14:50] want to be daily worshiping the Lord,
[14:52] growing in the grace and knowledge of
[14:54] the Lord, confessing our sins, rejoicing
[14:57] in the Lord Jesus. As the Bible said,
[14:59] let us continually say, "The Lord be
[15:01] magnified." Psalm 139:16, "Thine eyes
[15:05] did see my substance, yet being
[15:06] unperfect, and in thy book all my
[15:08] members were written, which in
[15:10] continuence were fashioned, when as yet
[15:12] there was none of them." So God wrote
[15:14] down the details of our lives, including
[15:16] the number of our days. Well, before we
[15:19] were born, before the foundation of the
[15:20] world, our names were written on the
[15:22] Lamb's Book of Life or the Book of Life.
[15:24] Now, I want to be gracious for Charlie
[15:26] Kirk. I admired so much about him. So
[15:28] Isaiah 57 says, "The righteous perisheth
[15:31] and no man layeth it to heart and
[15:34] merciful men are taken away. None
[15:36] considering that the righteous is taken
[15:37] away from the evil to come." So that
[15:39] could just be one reason Charlie Kirk
[15:41] was taken to heaven. We would believe if
[15:44] he's saved by the grace of God. God
[15:47] sometimes takes them away to keep them
[15:48] from the evil to come. Now we don't know
[15:50] what evil would have came. The only
[15:53] worse evil that could have come perhaps
[15:55] would have been being a part of the
[15:56] ecumenical movement. And that's what a
[15:59] lot of people are concerned about is the
[16:02] ecumenical gathering of so many
[16:05] different faiths of Christians such as
[16:07] Catholics and Protestants uniting in the
[16:10] wake of Charlie's death. It is something
[16:12] to be concerned about. Of course, the
[16:14] Bible and brother Ram told us about the
[16:17] temptation that will come at the end
[16:18] time. He said it will come as follows.
[16:20] The economical move that has started on
[16:22] what seems such a beautiful and blessed
[16:24] principle becomes so strong politically
[16:27] that she bears pressure upon the
[16:29] government to cause all to join her with
[16:31] either directly or through adherence to
[16:34] principles enacted into law so that no
[16:36] people will be recognized as actual
[16:38] churches unless under direct or indirect
[16:41] domination of this council. Now this
[16:43] statement is not thus sayith the Lord
[16:45] but I think it's very scriptural. I
[16:46] think it's very accurate to Revelation
[16:48] 13. Notice the ecumenical move becomes
[16:51] so strong politically. So this unity of
[16:54] Catholics and Protestants will become so
[16:57] strong that'll put pressure on the
[16:59] government to change laws. Now we don't
[17:01] know if we'll see this in our day or the
[17:03] next generation or the following
[17:04] generation, but we always want to watch
[17:06] and pray. We always want to be ready by
[17:08] the grace of God. So definitely the evil
[17:11] to come is the uniting of the Catholics
[17:12] and Protestants. And I'll share a
[17:14] screenshot. There is an upcoming event
[17:16] in Washington DC with Catholics and
[17:18] Protestants all having communion
[17:20] together. It's called Communion America
[17:22] in Washington DC from October 9th to
[17:25] October 12th, 2025.
[17:27] A lot of false prophets are going to be
[17:29] a part of this. A lot of Catholics are
[17:30] going to be a part of this. So, this
[17:32] could be a sign that we're nearing the
[17:34] end. Of course, every day goes by, we're
[17:35] one day closer to the rapture of the
[17:38] church by the Lord Jesus Christ, the
[17:40] meeting in the air. So, we just want to
[17:42] be aware of that by the grace of God.
[17:44] Also remember Matthew 25:33 and34 at the
[17:47] great white throne judgment where the
[17:49] bride is sitting with Christ in
[17:52] judgment. The foolish virgin and all
[17:55] others are out in front of the white
[17:57] throne and they're being separated as
[17:58] sheep and goats. I just want to show
[18:00] what Jesus says to the foolish virgin.
[18:02] Verse 34, then the king shall say to
[18:04] them on his right hand, "Come ye blessed
[18:06] of my father, inherit the kingdom
[18:07] prepared for you from the foundation of
[18:09] the world."
[18:11] So it is such a blessing to be a foolish
[18:13] virgin. The Bible said, "Come ye blessed
[18:16] of my father." And notice God gives them
[18:18] an inheritance in the kingdom of God,
[18:20] which is eternal life. It is such a
[18:23] eternal blessing to be a Christian, to
[18:25] be saved, whether you're a wise virgin
[18:27] or foolish virgin. And you are blessed
[18:29] of the father just to be saved. That is
[18:32] how much love god has for the foolish
[18:33] virgin and the wise virgin. So friends,
[18:36] as I close this video here, let's unite
[18:38] with thus sayaith the Lord. Brother Ram
[18:40] said that's what the bride is doing.
[18:41] Uniting with thus sayith the Lord. We're
[18:44] not uniting with the ecumenical move.
[18:46] That is the great temptation of these
[18:48] last days. We will overcome it by the
[18:51] blood of the lamb and the word of our
[18:53] testimony. So continue to pray for
[18:56] Charlie's family. Pray that they will
[18:58] mourn and that they'll be comforted as
[19:00] brother prayed for Mrs. Kennedy. May
[19:03] there be a time in their deep bereiement
[19:05] that they'll find the full truth of the
[19:07] Bible, the message of the hour, Jesus
[19:10] Christ, because Jesus Christ is the only
[19:13] one who can give peace and comfort in
[19:15] the hour of trouble. We've prayed
[19:17] numerous times. We'll continue to pray
[19:18] for the Kirk family. I'll end this video
[19:20] by playing all these quotes. I thought
[19:22] it'd be easier that way. I'll just play
[19:24] all the quotes from what shall we do
[19:26] with this Jesus that's called Christ?
[19:28] And then I'll play a quote from the
[19:30] statue of perfect man where brother Ram
[19:31] talks about how the Catholics and
[19:32] Protestants were only divided on
[19:34] communion. But here we see now with this
[19:36] communion America event that they're
[19:39] coming together on the communion. So
[19:40] again a very prophetic profound
[19:43] statement from God's prophet brother
[19:44] Brandham. He said and there's the only
[19:46] thing they cannot get together on.
[19:49] They'll do it. Again another proof how
[19:51] brother Brandham had prophetic insight
[19:53] that the Catholics and Protestants had
[19:55] to come together on communion. And here
[19:56] they are in 2025,
[19:58] 62 years after brother Ram said it,
[20:01] coming together on communion. So
[20:03] friends, let's watch and pray. Let's
[20:05] seek God with all of our hearts. Let's
[20:06] be faithful. Let's get extra oil
[20:08] prepared now by the grace of God. Let's
[20:10] be the wise virgin. We will not unite
[20:12] with the ecumenical move of the Catholic
[20:14] and Protestants. We're uniting with thus
[20:16] sayith the Lord. God gave brother
[20:18] Brandham over 30 thus sayith the Lords.
[20:20] I've recently preached on that as well
[20:22] in a series called we have thus sayith
[20:24] the Lord. Let's unite with thus sayith
[20:26] the Lord because the Lord Jesus Christ
[20:28] has a bride and she's making herself
[20:30] ready.
[20:31] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm sure this morning that we're
[20:33] all uh aware of the great sadness that's
[20:38] happened to this nation of the loss of
[20:41] our president, Mr. Kennedy. Though I
[20:46] disagreed with the man in his politics
[20:48] and in his religion, but yet he doesn't
[20:50] deserve to die like that.
[20:52] &gt;&gt; No. Amen.
[20:53] &gt;&gt; And uh leave those little children
[20:56] behind and old daddy and a mother.
[20:59] That's Mrs. Kennedy. Though I certainly
[21:03] wouldn't agree with her and her ways and
[21:06] things maybe, but remember she's a
[21:09] mother. She just lost her babies and she
[21:12] lost her husband and he fell right in
[21:14] her lap and her own husband's blood
[21:16] poured out over her lap. That's awful.
[21:20] And did you ever think sometimes we
[21:23] think she sets a pace for the nation and
[21:25] styles and things that may be so too but
[21:27] did you know Miss Kennedy never did hear
[21:29] one of these messages I preach about
[21:31] that
[21:33] if she might hear one of them message
[21:34] she might do different than some of our
[21:36] sisters that hear it and still won't
[21:37] cope with
[21:40] she's raised a Catholic that's all she
[21:42] knows nothing against that see she
[21:44] that's a system nothing against the
[21:46] people Catholic uh people that's a
[21:49] system. The Catholic system just like
[21:52] Presbyterian, Methodist, or any of the
[21:53] rest of them or Pentecostal, any of it.
[21:56] It's a system, not the people. Mr.
[21:59] Kennedy, I think, done a a good job at
[22:03] being president.
[22:05] My heart goes out for his wife.
[22:10] And I feel real sad about it that even
[22:13] our own nation would, the hoodlams and
[22:15] so forth and our nation would do a thing
[22:17] like that. If you can't disagree with a
[22:20] person
[22:21] uh right and take your own stand and
[22:25] there's no reason to kill another man
[22:27] just because of things like that and
[22:29] little children
[22:31] know said one little fell said now I
[22:33] don't have nobody to play with me no
[22:34] more daddy's gone see so
[22:37] &gt;&gt; I've always thought that would be my
[22:39] state someday it's almost happened
[22:41] several times as you know been shot in
[22:42] foreign nations when they've had to hold
[22:44] our bodies or me keep been shot at a
[22:46] distance so if a dies like that. But
[22:50] that's the price that's paid that goes
[22:52] with the glory of different things. See,
[22:54] I think we average about every fourth
[22:56] president, one out of four is
[22:58] assassinated. And um I feel uh very bad
[23:03] about it. Shame that we'd have such a
[23:06] person in America would do a thing like
[23:08] that. And now
[23:11] yet, as I said, I I disagreed with his
[23:14] politics. I'm I don't didn't agree with
[23:18] his ideas of what he was trying to do.
[23:20] But you see, he's another man. And I
[23:23] didn't agree with his system of
[23:25] religion. I I certainly didn't agree
[23:27] with that. But yet, he he is raised that
[23:30] way. That's that's what it was. I said
[23:32] maybe he'd heard something different. It
[23:34] might have been different.
[23:36] We have a a thing here we do that
[23:39] whenever one of our people dies or
[23:41] something even though out I think as a
[23:45] as a American church as a body of
[23:49] Americans the American people voted Mr.
[23:52] Kennedy in for president
[23:55] and uh that was that's the reason we're
[23:57] democracy I didn't vote for Mr. Kennedy
[24:00] I voted for Mr. Nixon because I know Mr.
[24:03] Nixon personally and uh I I liked him
[24:06] and I and I voted for him personally
[24:08] because I liked him. But the peoples of
[24:10] this country uh Americans, my fellow
[24:14] citizens of this nation elected Mr.
[24:17] Kennedy and the way they did it, well
[24:19] that's up between them and God, but
[24:21] that's that much. But I think for the
[24:24] sake of this mother, a human being,
[24:29] a mother of children, Mrs. Kennedy.
[24:33] Couldn't we just stand a moment for a
[24:34] prayer for her?
[24:42] Lord Jesus,
[24:45] we human beings,
[24:48] we have a feeling for one another.
[24:52] And
[24:53] we are sorry, Lord, that our president
[24:58] was shot down the way he was in cold
[25:00] blood murder.
[25:02] And we're so sorry that our nation has
[25:06] come to this spot that such people like
[25:08] that are are
[25:10] in our nation that would kill a human
[25:13] being and coldblooded murder like they
[25:16] shot that colored brother not long ago
[25:18] and just shot him right down in the cold
[25:20] blood of race prejudice.
[25:25] We're so sorry that such people exist
[25:28] among us. Lord, we our weakness has
[25:30] brought this about
[25:33] and we pray for Mrs. Kennedy,
[25:38] that uh wife of M the president
[25:42] and no them little babies looking upon
[25:45] their their father that left them a few
[25:48] days before that happy man and scuffled
[25:51] and played with them on the floor. Now
[25:54] they have no father. And for that woman
[25:58] that his wife, her own husband fell
[26:01] right in her lap and his blood run out
[26:03] on her dress,
[26:06] just bearing her baby. And yet, Lord, we
[26:10] might believe the woman being in the
[26:12] wrong of the the the way that she has
[26:14] set a pace in the nation of her dressing
[26:17] and so forth, but that that could be to
[26:20] the American people in whole. They
[26:22] that's what they want. So we we pray for
[26:25] her this morning that you'll help her
[26:28] and may there be a time in this deep
[26:30] bereiement that she'll find what is
[26:33] truth Jesus Christ.
[26:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:37] &gt;&gt; Grant it Lord the one who only can give
[26:39] peace and comfort in the hour of
[26:42] trouble.
[26:44] and help us Lord to continue to be with
[26:47] all of our hearts a shining light that
[26:50] we don't know what time or what
[26:52] influence we might be having upon
[26:54] somebody else.
[26:56] Let us shine forth the light of Christ
[26:59] until he comes.
[27:02] Then the great shepherd of the flock who
[27:04] knows all justice will bring every sin
[27:08] into recompense and he'll knows just how
[27:11] to do it. Until then, we commit
[27:14] ourselves into your hands for your love
[27:16] and mercy upon us in Jesus' name. Amen.
[27:31] &gt;&gt; Yes. I don't think no man deserves to
[27:33] die like that.
[27:34] &gt;&gt; No.
[27:37] &gt;&gt; Now, Mr. Lincoln didn't deserve to die
[27:40] like that.
[27:41] &gt;&gt; No. Mr. McKinley didn't deserve to die
[27:43] like that. Huie Long didn't deserve to
[27:45] die like that.
[27:47] &gt;&gt; None of them fellas. I don't believe in
[27:49] that. Murders. That's bad.
[27:54] Our boys didn't fight overseas for
[27:55] something like that.
[27:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:57] &gt;&gt; Our flag wasn't raised for something
[27:59] like that.
[28:00] &gt;&gt; We're not American citizens for
[28:01] something like that. Amen.
[28:03] &gt;&gt; No. Although our nation is warped and
[28:05] twisted with sin, that's what what does
[28:07] these things. That's sin.
[28:12] Just as I have spoke of the president
[28:14] that was just assassinated,
[28:16] not the man, far as I know, is a good
[28:19] man. He never done anything evil as I
[28:21] know. But it's a system.
[28:25] It isn't the people. It's a system.
[28:30] But I ask you something. Can you imagine
[28:34] their guilt on Oswald's hands this
[28:36] morning? the one that murdered the
[28:40] president.
[28:41] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine what his judgment will
[28:44] be if he's proven to be the one that did
[28:46] it?
[28:48] &gt;&gt; Can you could you imagine any mercy be
[28:51] left on him?
[28:54] The blood of the president of the United
[28:56] States is on his hands.
[28:58] Do you think the federal court, no
[29:01] matter how much he pleaded,
[29:04] I didn't mean to do it. That won't
[29:07] excuse him a bit.
[29:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:10] &gt;&gt; He'll perish.
[29:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:14] &gt;&gt; Why got the president's blood on his
[29:17] hands?
[29:19] &gt;&gt; Could you imagine his feelings?
[29:22] &gt;&gt; Would you want that on your hands?
[29:23] &gt;&gt; Oh, sir.
[29:25] &gt;&gt; When I heard the murder of President
[29:28] Kennedy, this message fell on my heart.
[29:32] I thought, "What will that man do?"
[29:35] No way out of it. Now you might have
[29:37] woke up by this time and realize what
[29:40] lays ahead.
[29:42] &gt;&gt; There's only one difference if they can
[29:43] just get over that. That's taking the
[29:45] communion. That's the only thing in the
[29:47] dascese that that that stops Catholicism
[29:50] and Protestantism from uniting is the
[29:53] order of communion. The Catholic church
[29:55] says it is the body and the Protestant
[29:58] church says it represents the body. The
[30:01] Catholic makes a mass out of it. a mass
[30:03] is that they take the communion hoping
[30:05] they are forgiven. The Protestant takes
[30:07] it by faith thanking God in communion
[30:10] that they are forgiven.
[30:12] &gt;&gt; The Protestant says we are forgiven. The
[30:14] Catholic says we're hoping we forgiven.
[30:16] Mass and communion. They call it a mass.
[30:19] We call it a communion. A mass is hoping
[30:22] it's so. A communion is knowing it's so
[30:24] and thanking for it. See, and there's
[30:25] the only thing that they cannot get
[30:27] together on. They'll do it.
[30:31] Oh, it looks very pretty. It'll unite
[30:33] around. It'll it'll run all the Well,
[30:36] the Bible said, "And these beasts gave
[30:38] their power unto the whore." See,
[30:42] &gt;&gt; united themselves together.
[30:44] &gt;&gt; See, just exactly what the Bible said
[30:47] they do, they're doing it now. It's
[30:48] right in possession of this very weak.
[30:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[30:52] &gt;&gt; How does that have anything against
[30:53] Catholic people no more than Protestant
[30:55] people? You Methodists and Baptists and
[30:57] a lot of you Pentecostal, one of your
[30:59] churches has gone right into this
[31:01] Federation of Churches when they got the
[31:03] big marg built there in New York of that
[31:05] Federation of Churches. This the same as
[31:06] the United Nations and things. They're
[31:08] trying to unite all Protestantism
[31:10] together. Now,
[31:12] &gt;&gt; if you have any questions, concerns, or
[31:13] testimonies about this video, please
[31:15] contact me.
[31:17] God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[31:19] the desire of your heart. Very happy to
[31:23] be here this afternoon and again in
[31:25] defense of the gospel of Jesus Christ to
[31:28] bring the good tidings, the good news
[31:30] that Jesus raised from the dead, living
[31:32] among man today, his church. The same
[31:35] Jesus that was yesterday will be today
[31:38] and forever. He has never failed.
