Description:
Sadly, the Branham TabernacleTape Church Movement and some Five Fold Ministry Preachers are BOTH declaring they are the greatest Christians of all time. There is no Scriptural basis for their claims, so it seems to be a spirit of haughtiness, or pride, inspiring these groups to exalt themselves above every other Christian in history. 

Many Bible verses and quotes from God's prophet, William Branham, prove Christian should never exalt one another. Please pray for their repentance through genuine humility.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] sometimes great guys get together europe say great so and so great so-and-so are great don't never do that there's no great ones among us there's only one great one and that's god greetings friends in the name above all names the lord jesus christ the purpose of this video is to warn christians specifically message believers about the sin of pride that seems to be anointing preachers that i observed over the past few years this sin of pride seems to be manifesting itself in some message preachers that i've observed online as they have publicly and repeatedly declared that they are the greatest christians of all time along with declaring brother branham as the greatest prophet of all time these preachers claims about being the goats of christianity are complete presumption as there seems to be no bible support for their claims as far as i can find in scripture and of course i am always open to correction there's also no quotes from brother branham that support their claims as being goats alongside brother branham it's a sad spiritual state for these message preachers to be in as they've repeatedly exalted themselves and brother branham as the goats of christianity friends this is likely a result of living pridefully in laodicea being rich and increased with goods and it seems their riches have freed them from having burdens on their hearts for the lost the poor the sick the afflicted and other hurting people that they seem to have time to publicly spend time ranking themselves as greater than all the christians including martin luther john wesley charles spurgeon jonathan edwards charles finney polycarp justin martyr six of the church age messengers including saint paul and jesus's 11 faithful disciples who were all martyred and saint john who died a natural death just to name a few by the discernment gift of the holy ghost we should be able to judge the two spirits within the framework of the church so which spirit is causing some message preachers and their churches to exalt themselves as the goats of christianity i believe it's an evil spirit of pride and i also believe these claims as the goats of christianity are the beginning of a doctrine of nicolaitans as brother am taught us from revelation chapters 2 and 3 in the church ages series remember these doctrines of nicolaitans begin as sayings then become doctrines and then they become the unbending way so as far as i've heard online thus far it is only a saying that they are the greatest christians of all time i've never heard them use scripture to make this presumption that they are the greatest of all time so i hope this video will be a help to bring these brothers to repentance by the grace of god here's the outline for the video first we'll look at the origin of this pride observation second we'll look at bible teaching on pride and brother branham quotes about pride including his personal battle with it third we'll look at the specific examples of prideful declarations of today's message preachers fourth we'll look at the true goat jesus fifth we'll look at who might be the greatest christian servants with the greatest rewards of course outside of jesus christ and six will end with a plea for humility origin of this pride observation the first observation i saw of message preachers and churches exalting themselves was branham tabernacle in august 2020 and again in december of the same year i have closely followed branham tabernacle's pastor's teachings since 2015 when branham tabernacle voted in new leadership it was immediately thereafter that i became very concerned about the false doctrines that began to come out of their church as of this moment today in july of 2022 i have counted and recorded 18 false teachings from branham tabernacle and they're propagating these false doctrines to millions around the world one of which is the presumption that brother branham and they themselves are the greatest of all time now i'm going to read the exact quotes and i've already reached out to branham tabernacle in hopes they would repent of this but they have not responded to me anyone can go on their website branham tabernacle dot org and search for these declarations and easily find them so the first statement is from august first two thousand twenty brother joseph writes quote and today he has sent the greatest prophet of all time william marion branham to lead his bride end quote now friends notice he never said the greatest prophet of all time outside of jesus christ so it seems to be the deity spirit that has anointed branham tabernacle to exalt brother branham higher than jesus christ and if they did not mean that why have they not corrected it in these two years since posting this then in december of the same year brother joseph on the website wrote quote it is the greatest age of all time with the greatest messenger of all time who is gathering the greatest people of all time end quote friends it is incredibly sad that these supposed jeffersonville christians are so bold and prideful to participate in the goat debate placing themselves at the top of the podium when there is no bible command to exalt themselves so highly and so we can see as a total act of pride complete presumption shortly after reading these posts online i began hearing some of the message preachers i have respected most declare they were either the greatest preachers of all time or among the greatest preachers of all time this truly disheartened me and i began to save the video clips of these public declarations then it struck me both groups were now saying the same thing the tape worshipers or jeffersonville tape people were publicly declaring their absolute greatness above all other church ages along with some of the fivefold preachers both of these groups claim to oppose one another but they agree that they are the greatest of all time when i saw both camps the tape camp and the fivefold camp saying the same thing i knew it was a dangerous spiritual condition to be in because i've witnessed how the tape church movement has repeatedly denied the gospel of jesus christ by their 18 plus false doctrines brother branham taught us in the church age book that the prophet the holy spirit and the bride would all be saying the same thing and what they said would already be said in the word of god let's listen to part of the quote yes listen to the authenticated prophet of god who appears in this last age what he says from god the bride will say the spirit and the prophet and the bride will be saying the same thing and what they will say will have already been said in the word they are saying it now friends the word holy spirit prophet and bride do not say the laosei and believers and brother branham are the greatest christians of all time so their self exaltations cannot be true by the discernment of the holy ghost the judging of spirits it seems a spirit of haughtiness or pride has infected some very prominent message preachers and their churches after praying about this subject preaching numerous sermons about the subject of the sin of pride i felt led to the holy ghost to make a video warning for both groups so that they may repent of this sinful trend of message preachers and believers being prideful and exalting themselves as the greatest of all time god's word will not return void so he that exalts himself will be abased and he that humbles himself will be exalted i'm offering this warning and rebuke of the sin of pride without calling names other than joseph branham because i've already made videos about him and contacted him personally and now he won't return my emails and lord willing i'll send letters or emails separately to the preachers who have made their claims as being the goats of christianity in hopes it will help them humble themselves under the mighty hand of god according to the scriptures bible teaching on pride and brother branham quotes about pride including his personal battle with it in the greek lexicon pride is defined as self-confidence boasting for a modern definition the new oxford dictionary has a very similar definition two of the definitions say consciousness of one's own dignity or honor and the quality of having it an excessively high opinion of oneself or one's importance first john 2 verses 15 through 17 teaches their only three avenues of temptation message people if they're faithful will likely battle pride the most because they already have the sanctification anointing of temperance which gives the believer self-control over bodily passions meaning the lust of the eyes and the lust of the flesh as seen on this image of the stature of a perfect man it seems pride will be the biggest struggle of genuine message believers but we can all overcome it by the grace of jesus christ through repentance and humility i'll begin with first peter 5 verses 5 through 9. peter tells us to be clothed with humility for god resists us the proud and giveth grace to the humble humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of god that he may exalt you in due time the greek lexicon defines humility as having a humble opinion of oneself a deep sense of one's moral littleness modesty humility lowliness of mind the next verses first peter 3 7 and malachi 2 verses 14 through 16 tell us that god resists the proud and will not hear their prayers proverbs 16 verse 18 says pride goeth before the fall proverbs 13 verse 10 says contention comes only by pride and peace is a great blessing psalm 10 verse 4 and 2nd chronicles 26 verses 5 and 16 teach pride will not seek god so my question is did these message preachers seek god before declaring they are the goats of christianity and if god did tell them this can they speak it now with thus saith the lord so we can know god told them to say this and then can they provide a genesis to revelation teaching on it with at least two or three bible witnesses to prove their doctrine as brother branham taught every teaching must be taught from genesis to revelation here's a few quotes from brother branham that show pride is a horrible spirit to have [Applause] oh is pride see i told you about the prophets [Music] [Applause] now i'd like to play a quote where brother branham says don't never do that don't never say you're great let's listen to the quote influence sometimes great guys get together europe say great so-and-so great so-and-so our great don't never do that there's no great ones among us there's only one great one and that's god we are brothers sisters i don't care if your pastor church got five people in i don't make you little that makes you a brother based upon this quote where brother branham said don't never do that this select group of message preachers are not saying what the tapes say since the tapes say to never call each other great one of the greatest or the greatest of all time i'd also like to address that numerous message preachers say today's message is the greatest message of all time but is that what the bible and brother branham said just to show we need more balance and humility here's a quote where brother branham said jesus already gave the greatest message any man could ever get on resurrection morning if brother branham was right then how could the laodicean message be greater than the resurrection message since brother random said no message could ever be greater let's listen to the quote our visions come in the old testament but every man went right to the grave wondering would he ever rise again but on easter morning when these disciples got the greatest message that any man could ever get what did they get go tell my disciples i am risen from the dead death had been conquered additionally in 1964 white had to be shepherds brother ram said the shepherds had the greatest message he said it was the greatest of all the messages and the message was the messiah is here now if brother branham can't be corrected then why aren't the message preachers saying what the tapes say and apologizing for saying they're the greatest christians of all time with the greatest message of all time and actually the shepherds that heard about jesus's birth about him being on the earth at that time was the greatest of all messages let's listen to the quote coming to give these common herdsmen the greatest message of all times there have been many great messengers will you think of the noah's day and the prophets and and the great priests and so forth have been in the days gone by the great learning man kings pope tapes monarchs but here he comes in the greatest of all the messages that was the message messiah is here now and to make that known he bypassed all the trains to make it known to humble shepherds i certainly have more studying to do on this subject as to which is the greatest message of all time but i just thought i would show you a few quotes that plainly exposed the error of claiming we have the greatest message of all time which goes against these two quotes from god's prophet brother branham here are five quotes that seem to show brother branham battled the sin of pride or the pride of life more than any other but of course this is just my observation the first one is brother branham said he lost his first wife and daughter for failing to preach to the pentecostals so this was not lust of the eyes lust of the flesh this was pride of life second brother branham had amoebas for months because he took the denominational agenda in south africa rather than god's itinerary through the angel of the lord and again that was not lust of the flesh lust of the eyes that was pride of life thirdly brother bran told the story about the purple haired woman in ohio and he wished his children did not have to see such sin but god showed him jesus's blood veil and then brother branham asked her for forgiveness so again that was not lust of the eyes lust of the flesh that was pride of life a fourth example is brother branham told god you owe me an understanding brother brandon said it was like a black sheep came down and he felt like he couldn't contact god for a little while i'm not sure if it was a couple weeks or something so again that was not lust of the flesh or lust of the eyes and the fifth example is brother i am told about his complex in his sermon standing in the gap where he almost left the field of ministry because he lost the feeling for the people the people he preached to for so long wouldn't respond to his preaching they wouldn't believe the word of god so again not lust of the eyes not lust of the flesh likely pride of life prideful declarations from today's message preachers friends before i read the exact quotes from today's message preachers recall the quote played earlier in which brother ram said to never call one another great i'd like to play another quote wherein brother branham explains how pride can happen in a preacher's life which is the same mistake israel king uzziah made brother iran lists five things that can happen to preachers first they can feel secure second they can build a kingdom or ministry third they can have a lot of influence fourth they can have large attendance and fifth they can have people applaud them let's listen to the quote and is that help this standard he was a great influence as i've said isaiah the prophet and then made that fatal mistake just like many other people done when he got felt secured felt that he just had the whole thing in his hand he got lifted up in his spirit he got lifted up to pride now there's a real example for us all you know that's been the trouble i'm speaking to christians and and ministers and i i want to be honest about these things that's where many ministers even make a mistake we've heard so many times about the ministers the the acts that they do and and the things some of them may be to doing things they should not do i think sometimes they're a good man a wonderful christian that's been used of the lord and then finally they get a little kingdom built around them or a lot of influence many people attending their meetings until they get careless and they entirely lift it up the people applaud them and stand up and uh we shouldn't really do that we remember we're just all there's no big people among us [Applause] [Applause] because we're all connected together to one god and we all come off of one tree and now we find that many times ministers gets the feeling just a little secure and uh they keep leading out the first thing you know they'll the fact that these message preachers who are declaring themselves the greatest of all time ignore these two quotes from brother branham whether on purpose or ignorantly shows they are caught up in a prideful spirit of this laodicean age they are caught up in their own goat debate about who is the greatest message preachers of all time friends that is just like the world the sports world loves to debate who is the goat is it tom brady or joel montana in football is it michael jordan or lebron james and basketball even some of our recent united states presidents have repeatedly said that america is the greatest it has ever been and promised we are only going to get greater it's just sinful pride plain and simple message preachers and all christians who are not preachers should be focusing on serving if they want to be great in god's sight according to jesus and if they were doing that they would be concerned with the poor the sick and the afflicted and they'd be concerned about fasting praying giving secret alms and doing works in secret in order that they would not be seen of men and praised this is according to matthew 23 11 but he that is greatest among you shall be your servant and really all of matthew chapter 6 where jesus tells us to pray in secret give alms in secret and fast and secret here are five prideful declarations i have heard from the same group of fivefold message preachers who often preach conventions together i'll read the list of five declarations and then go through each one individually and read the exact quotes from the preachers without naming their names of course the first declaration is that brother branham and their group of preachers and their young people and their mothers are the greatest christians of all time and some of the most powerful preachers on the earth second they made prideful predictions that have not come to pass third they've pridefully declared brother branham cannot be corrected fourth they've pridefully declared they will not answer questions and are not willing to debate and fifth they've pridefully said we don't need scriptures to support brother graham's quotes the first declaration brother branham their group of preachers their young people their mothers are the greatest christians of all time and some of the most powerful preachers on earth the first quotes are from joseph branham which i've already read he said brother branham is the greatest prophet of all time and brother branham gathered the greatest people of all time notice joseph never said except for jesus brother branham is the greatest of all time and joseph never used any scripture nor a quote from his father whose tapes he exalts to be equal with scripture saying everything on the tape is thus saith the lord this is idolatry or tape worship so without scripture or quotes joseph's statement is a prideful opinion recall friends brother brahm said don't never do that there's no great ones among us there's only one great one and that's god it's wrong to declare who is the greatest or who will sit on the right and left hand of jesus as we'll look at later at the current time it seems two of the greatest christians are two of the 24 elders in heaven right now that are sitting on the right and left hand of jesus in the seventh dimension as revelation chapter 4 and 5 details but it could change perhaps we don't know since the bible does not say who's gonna sit by jesus in the millennium or the future home and friends even jesus did not know who would sit on his right and left hand when he was on the earth so it's similar to the unknown day and hour of the rapture it's information jesus's human side does not know and notice that joseph branham is basically saying he knows more than jesus jesus didn't know who was the greatest of all time but now joseph branham says he does know who's the greatest of all time his father if jesus told that to joseph branham why doesn't he tell us that with a thus saith the lord's statement if there's no thus saith the lord and no scripture then it's just his human opinion the next statement by a preacher is by preacher a i'll call him quote i'm not ashamed to say this it or the message has produced the greatest preachers that have ever stood in a pulpit and preached the word it has produced the greatest mothers it has produced come on church this message is jesus christ end quote notice like joseph branham he did not say except for jesus instead he seemed to make this message generation equal to jesus christ but we are not there is no comparison between us and the lovely lord jesus jesus is all holy we like brother branham are sinners saved by grace preacher a said the message is jesus christ but brother branham said i am not jesus christ let's listen to the quote i remember i am not jesus christ i am your brother a sinner saved by grace i'm like you are also preacher a contradicts brother branham in the church age book when he says the philadelphian age had the greatest preachers outside of jesus of course let's listen to the quote the preaching of the word was never greater as satan raised up his hordes of free thinkers as the originators of communism rose up as liberal theologians spread their filthy wares god raised up mighty warriors of faith and the greatest works of christian literature and teaching and preaching came from this era never has its preachers and teachers been matched and never will they be the spurgeons parkers mclarens the edwards onions mueller's brainerds barns bishops all came from this era they preached taught and wrote the word they glorified his name i've also heard preachers from this group say you can't correct a prophet and you must only say what the tapes say if that is the case they're breaking their own rules because they are correcting the philadelphia church age book quote and refusing to say what brother branham said about the preachers from the philadelphian church age preacher a also said the mothers were the greatest what about brother graham's quotes regarding susannah wesley which mother today in the message prays more than her each day with more children than her remember the greatest are the servants so which mother is a greater servant than susannah wesley and of course i'm not exalting susannah wesley as the greatest woman of all time but she just came to my mind when i thought about women that brother branham complemented very highly for their works of service and how does preacher a's declaration that today's preachers are the greatest preachers that have ever stood in a pulpit fit with first corinthians chapter 3 verses 3-9 paul said all preachers are one in the fact they are neither anything they're just tools in the hand of god they're not the great ones only god can give the increase paul magnifies god in these scriptures because he says but god that giveth the increase next preacher b said quote i said god you raised a boy up to be one of the greatest men to ever preach in the whole world end quote again brother branham said don't never do that and how can preacher be correct brother branham saying a living preacher today was one of the greatest men to ever preach in the whole world when again brother branham said in the church age book the philadelphian age had the greatest preachers and notice preacher b did not say except for the preachers of the philadelphian church age like brother branham taught other preachers in this group of preachers say you cannot correct the prophet and you won't correct the prophet when you have the baptism of the holy ghost so do these preachers have the baptism of the holy ghost because they are correcting brother iran's quote about the philadelphian church age preachers next preacher c said quote they demons are coming against the greatest generation of young people that have ever been on the face of the earth our credential is we have met the lord jesus christ ourself end quote friend how can the laodicean young people be the greatest young people of all time where is the scripture for that what about the young people that were on the earth when jesus was on the earth like stephen stephen was killed and martyred around the age of 29. james and john left their father for full-time ministry with no air conditioning or plane flights like today's young people have which young people today have left their father's business in order to preach the gospel and travel the difficult way by boat or walking only and friends didn't james john stephen and moore have the credentials that they met jesus christ to even face to face which young people today have not done weren't their credentials more than today's young people when eventually they gave their lives as martyrs for jesus christ again recall brother brahm said don't never do that in other words don't call the young people the greatest of all time again preacher c said in another message quote whenever the lord brought me to himself and his grace and then allowed me to stand with what i consider to be some of the greatest men alive today end quote now friends why isn't preacher c saying what the tapes say don't never do that there's no great ones among us next preacher d who i'm going to be quoting a number of times said speaking of a living canadian preacher quote he's a seasoned minister one of the greatest that's ever preached that has went around the world over and over and over again preaching that this message has fulfilled malachi 4 5 and 6 end quote again recall brother ram said don't never do that there's no great ones among us next preacher d said again quote preacher i don't like this kind of preaching hang around i'm only getting greater end quote my friends it's true we go from glory to glory and faith to faith but that's not something we should publicly declare so we've seen preacher d call other people some of the greatest of all time and then publicly declare that he's only getting greater in the next quote preacher d was invited to come preach and pray for a sick person and he self-proclaims himself as a general in the army of the lord and then exalts the people as the most powerful people in the earth greater than the angels in heaven people with checkbook authority quote when a certain woman gets in trouble you got to have some generals come in i stand before the most powerful people in the earth greater than the angels that are in heaven people with checkbook authority end quote notice friends i see these preachers always leaving out the requirement to find the will of god first before we pray for sick people as brother and i'm taught in numerous places but one clear example is works is faith express 1965. let's listen to the quote that saved your soul can he heal your [Applause] [Music] [Applause] it's body the same revealed you he's your healer as you as your savior but it's got to be revealed first that's the difference you've got to first find the will of god now you've got to find the will of god this morning as you're coming to be prayed for you've got to find the will of god whether it's god's will to heal you or not also preacher d called this woman he was called to pray for the queen of the state she lived in now how did preacher deed know she was the spiritual queen of that state what authority did he have to exalt that woman above all the other women in that state so that seems to be a prideful exaltation of one specific woman in the church in another quote from preacher d quote god sent you some of the most powerful men on earth to preach to you end quote now preacher dee expressed this but how does that line up with those who plant in water being nothing as paul said in first corinthians chapter three so this statement contradicts saint paul's writings in his epistles also preacher dee's focus on power contradicts the following quotes from brother branham where he says we can't judge our life by how much power we have to perform miracles and brother brahm says american people always fall for it when preachers say i've got power in my hands glory hallelujah he said don't you never let anybody tell you they got power to heal they haven't and also brother ram said i have no power to heal and he says none of us does we have authority let's listen to the you have to quotes miracles and we don't judge yourself for how much knowledge you have of the world but always judge yourself look back and take an inventory of what kind of a fruit that the life you presently live now is dead i said there's many people in the country they call themselves divine healers said i got power in my hands [Music] american people fall for it like i don't know what my heart takes and they and they they think that's right they're getting healed closer your faith is in the finished work of jesus christ that's what healing ladies but you never let anybody tell you they've got power to heal [Applause] now when jesus christ heals the sick now i don't say they'll be healed i can tell you that remember i have no power to heal i don't have power you don't have any power none of us does we have authority how many understand that so let's pray for our brothers to be more humble not to talk about how much power they have but to spend their time taking inventory of what kind of fruit they're presently bearing again preacher d said quote i'll stand with generals on that day end quote speaking of either in heaven or the future home again recall brother branham said don't never do that there's no great ones among us now i did find one quote where brother branham alluded to ministers as captains but i rarely if ever hear brother random calling himself the captain or the greatest of all time let's listen to the quote and the chief commanding general of course is jesus christ in the church his ministers are his uh captains of the companies that that's representing him here on earth i also want to show how brother branham was so humble brother ram said he could not even prove his name was there on the lamb's book of life and he said god could use me as a tool for something let's listen to the quote now we don't know you say brother bran can you prove that you're there no sir i cannot prove it god could use me for a tool of something else and use you the same way but i believe and by faith i am saved not but knowledge i'm saved by faith that's why you're safe that's where we're all safe in the next quote brother ram said lovers of self speak of how great they are so notice how close this is to someone saying i'm a general or i'm one of the greatest of all time or i am the greatest of all time let's listen to the quote and the bible says again preacher d said this recently in may of 2022 quote tomorrow morning you're going to have one of the greatest preachers that ever lived in history preached to you i know i'm on sacred ground i've got thick skin i can handle it end quote again remember brother brahma said don't never do that the shocking part about this quote is that the next day the preacher that preacher dee was talking about called him a politician making some in the congregation laugh showing friends their lack of discernment for exalting others as great ones even though brother branham said never do that and again i have video proof of all these statements next i have two other message preachers i'm just going to call them grandfathers who said that their musicians were the greatest musicians in the message i don't have quotes for these i heard one online i could go find it but i don't have it right now and the other one i heard while attending a meeting a number of years ago but again friends what is it in a grandfather a more mature preacher that would want to exalt his musicians as greater than everybody else remember the greatest among us are the servants now we're on to the second declaration prideful predictions in march of this year preacher d said quote in a few days you'll have a head full i don't believe that you stay around and the rapture happens you look over at brother and i remember the service preacher d said you'd have a hair full end quote so to summarize this preacher d was saying the rapture is going to happen in a few days and friends it's been over a hundred days since this bold prediction and the rapture has not happened yet where is the countability for such a statement as this notice again preacher d likely anointed with the spirit of pride predicting the rapture in a few hours and it doesn't happen where is the humility where's the repentance where's the public apology two weeks later preacher d said quote we're just hours before the rapture and we're believing we're getting ready to step over end quote friends it's been almost three thousand hours since this prediction when is preacher d going to be held accountable a third example is again preacher d presuming a healing would happen quote when god heals sister blank it will not diminish his healing power one little iota end quote friends preacher d announced a woman was going to be healed and then the woman died just a few days later after the preacher declared god would heal her friends was there any public repentance for this prediction the third declaration is pridefully declaring brother branham cannot be corrected and again this has to be the sin of the pride of life because it's not lust of the eyes or less of the flesh a new preacher preacher e said quote baptism of the holy ghost and when that revelation is caught then it stops the questioning of the prophet's words nobody sets before a prophet to correct him that's rapture condition god has not entrusted any man to correct a prophet of god end quote friends this quote basically makes brother branham infallible and brother branham said prophets are not infallible people let's listen to the quotes also i have over 50 statements that prove not everything brother branham said was thus saith the lord it's likely that this preacher who says you can't correct brother branham does correct brother branham by choosing one side of a quote when brother branham has quotes on both sides of a subject such as the white horse rider i just wonder would this preacher or any preacher take the quotes before the seven seals where brother branham said the white horse rider was the holy spirit or do they take the quote during the seven seals where brother branham said the white horse rider is the antichrist notice friends preacher e is basically saying i and everyone like me have the baptism of the holy ghost because we do not question any of brother brahms words and of course the brother's wrong and just a few simple examples prove that brother brahm said martin luther king jr would lead millions to a death trap and he never did that brother branham said total annihilation would happen to the united states by or before 1977 that did not happen brother branham said arizona could not have another another generation because of the high birth rates of children with mental retardation brother branham had a slip of the tongue and said rebecca married her bride a woman and brother branham said the rapture is in second thessalonians chapter four which doesn't exist it's first thessalonians chapter four the fourth statement is pridefully not answering questions about the message and being unwilling to debate preacher e said to me i don't have any time if someone wants to raise a question about this message i don't have any time for you and for a person that wants to even try to straighten things out well god has never called me or any other minister to qualify this message in the scripture god's already vindicated it end quote friends this is opposite of what brother branham said brother branham said i always have time to be corrected let's listen to the quote a baptist minister a few weeks ago come up and to my house and said i like straightening out on the god head sometime when he got the time called me up brother i said i got time right now because i want to be straight and we lay aside everything else to do it also recall first peter 3 verse 15 peter commands us through the holy spirit that we ought to always have an answer for the hope that we have within us also remember birth pains 1965. brother random hoped there would be men that could make more sense of the message and bring it to life i thought we're supposed to say what the tapes say why aren't we saying what birth pain up this it goes says with it they can make more sense to it see to bring it to a place you i just want to lay this seat but i hope they make it come to life notice friends the baptism of the holy ghost inside a god called preacher qualifies him to rightly divide the word of truth on all subjects because the tapes of brother branham are not infallible as brother brown told us he said there's mix up on the tapes any honest person will admit that to deny this birth pains quote is to not say what the tapes say friends saint paul debated often about jesus christ so did the minister apollos and you'll find that in acts 17 and acts 18. so if holy ghost-filled men before debated and they were baptized with the holy ghost and jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever then holy ghost-filled men today will be led by the holy spirit to hold debates at times and here's some quotes from brother branham where he talked about debates he had been a part of let's listen to the quotes when i first with him in this debate that brother leo was anxious to get on tape here i suppose i said i guess he's got it running now i would not want you by leo to use this to hurt or anything but yes i know you wouldn't and i wouldn't say you better if a man speaks with tongues all right he doesn't speak with tongues that still is no sign he hasn't got it as i've often said i hit a little spot last night in the church that i didn't know i was saying it but how this satan is not a a healer and the lutheran college where all those were converted recently when i the man debated with me on the subject said satan could heal and when you hear anyone say think and heal he's wrong and that night while we were laying there brother lee had a dream and it always debated with me about the water baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ also going back to preacher c he was against debate and said why spending time with serpent seed i ain't got time to debate end quote so again this preacher denies the first church age messenger paul who debated often about jesus christ along with the seventh church age messenger brother branham who debated about jesus christ divine healing the godhead and other topics like speaking in tongues so preachers not wanting to debate or answer questions seems to go along with their prideful lifestyles of lavish living flying first class taking no questions offering no counseling surrounding themselves with yes men rarely correcting each other and receiving hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars in ties the fifth and final statement is saying you don't need a scripture to support brother branham's quotes preacher c said quote bless god i believe brother branham whenever he's got a scripture for every quote and where did you get that in the bible it's sad to say it but some of our message preachers are preaching that tommy rot i don't think they ought to be in the pulpit it's evident they don't know what a prophet is end quote it's sad but this preacher see has decades of preaching experience and yet he says the bible doesn't say you need a scripture for every quote friends our brothers greatly deceived the bible plainly says prove all things in first thessalonians chapter 5. let's listen to quotes where brother branham says we must prove all things by the bible and also every doctrine must be based upon this new testament the new testament church and every doctrine must be based upon the word of god not just one place but from genesis to revelation let's listen to the quotes now we must prove all things by the scripture so heavens and earth as the way god's word will never pass away every doctrine and everything else of the bible that we have in the church must be based upon the word of god must come from the word not just one place but from genesis to revelation have to say the same thing as we cannot base our thoughts upon one little scripture while the bible said in the mouth of two three witnesses let every word be established and strictly as fundamental if anything doesn't come from this bible it isn't true i believe that this is god's truth and everything every doctrine must be based upon this new testament the new testament church the true goat the lord jesus christ friends the acronym goat stands for the greatest of all time today's message preachers are saying they and their congregations are the greatest of all time but they're sadly mistaken in philippians 2 verses 3 through 11 the scripture says jesus humbled himself wherefore god hath highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name so we know the lord jesus christ is the greatest of all time and none of us have any business calling ourselves the greatest of all time here's a quote from the second seal where brother branham speaks about philippians chapter two brother abraham says first it was humility in the lord jesus and then he become great brother ram says let god exalt you he that humbles himself god will exalt let's listen to the quote that's what the world thought of me didn't have a place to lay his head kicked out by every organization but when god [Applause] heaven is named after you and every family they're there all the family on earth is named jesus all the families in heaven named jesus amen and such [Applause] [Applause] see but first it was humility then it become great let god exalt he that humbles himself god will exalt in the next quote from trying to do god a service brother ram says how god come down from ivory palaces of glory to become one of us now who is the great one he washed the very clay that he created now who is great let's listen to the quote notice god himself come from the ivory palaces of glory to become one of us now who's the big one not come down here take the form of a priest but a servant wash the very clay that he created the feet of his apostles now who's great while i was preaching this series about overcoming the sin of pride the thought came to me that jesus was typified by two goats on the day of atonement this is found in leviticus chapter 16 verses 1-34 both goats typified the lord jesus christ one goat was slain to be sacrificed and the other goat had all the sins put upon it and it was sent out in the wilderness to die alone these two goats showed israel how god would deal with their sin god would put their wretched sins on an innocent sacrifice the two goats and this is what god did to our lord jesus christ the son of god god put all of our sins upon jesus he died for our sins and also he carried our sins far away as a song lyrics tell us living he loved us dying he saved us buried he carried our sins far away rising he justified freely forever one day he's coming o glorious day so we again see how the true goat the true greatest of all time is the lord jesus christ and friends god will not share his glory with anyone else let's listen to two quotes one from 1959 living dying buried rising coming where brother ram says these two goats type the lord jesus christ and also one from questions and answers part 1 1964 where brother brahm says the same thing let's listen to the quotes the old testament at the sin offering when they got two goats and these goats and jesus represented both of them or they represented him rather and one goat was killed and the other was the sins of the nation was placed upon this goat called the scapegoat and that goat had to go out into the wilderness to die and to be out there alone amongst the beasts and so forth jesus had to be that that goat i want you to notice he was a lamb he was sheep but he was made goat for you now that we being goat might become sheep we being sinners guilty of death subject to death and all sold out under condemnation yet christ become me that i through his grace might become him a son of god seated at the right hand of god and glory the love that he had how he expressed it how he had to make himself what he was to die to save us no more than dr smith on a seven-day adventist on the sacrifice goat he said one goat that was killed two goats into the day of the sacrifice a day of atonement and one goat was killed and the other and turned loose and then he said the goat that was killed represented jesus our sin barrier that died but the goat that was turned loose represented the devil that bears our sins and goes away into eternity with it now you see any to my opinion uh if this ever gets back to an adventist brother i'm not saying anything about that great man dr smith oh he was a smart intelligent fine cultured christian a believer but to me you see it doesn't make sense when you do that you're sacrificing to the devil land they both represented christ death burial and resurrection he also died for our sins and carrying our sins far away both of them was christ so friends it's without question jesus christ is the greatest person of all time and it is an absolute shame that preachers are calling themselves and their congregations the greatest of all time basically making themselves equal to the lord jesus christ [Music] besides jesus among sinners saved by grace who might be the greatest christian servants with the greatest rewards when you look at scriptures about the greatest believers of all time you might start at matthew 11 verse 11 where jesus says among them that are born of women there has not risen a greater than john the baptist notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he so it's clear john the baptist was the greatest old testament believer of all time and brother brahm said this was because he introduced jesus christ to the world let's listen to the quote jesus said yes he is so he never was a man born of a woman as great as that man there that's right the hobbit believes the kingdom of heaven is greater than john but if you've never been a man born every woman is greater than you why are all the other problems spoke of but john introduced into the world this is behold the lamb of god introduced into the world he's the greatest among the prophets also theologian adam clarke from the philadelphian church age added two other points quite powerfully in my opinion another reason he may have been the greatest was because john was prophesied of by other prophets like isaiah and malachi in isaiah 40 verse 3 and malachi 3 verse 1 and he continued and said where jesus christ himself seems to be the speaker so john was so great because jesus christ was speaking through isaiah and malachi about john clark said because he had the privilege of showing the fulfillment of their predictions by pointing out that christ has now come which they foretold should come and third because he saw and enjoyed that salvation which they could only foretell humbly i might add another reason john the baptist lived an impeccable life of holiness consecration and integrity there were godly men used mightily by god in the old testament but their testimonies were scarred by murder like with moses and david a few of the most godly lives seem to be enoch joseph and joshua but yet jesus christ exalts john the baptist above them john the baptist lived in the wilderness in total consecration and fellowship with god under a nazarite vow awaiting his six months of ministry that would prepare the way for christ he would exalt every valley and lower every mountain straighten every crooked path and make playing the rough places according to isaiah 40 verses 3 and 4. this might be an appropriate place to show that brother random also said moses was the greatest prophet of all time which is different from what he said in other places and then he said john the baptist was the greatest prophet of all time and then said that jesus was the greatest of all the prophets so of course these quotes prove brother branham was not infallible but he grew in his understanding of the word of god let's listen to the quotes let's call another man by the name of moses a very outstanding character in the bible the greatest of all the prophets he was the type of the lord jesus christ the priests and the kings and the law givers and when jesus came he was considered the john was the greatest of all the prophets because the rest of them spoke of jesus but john said behold the lamb of god to take away the sin of the world and god promised the same thing and the greatest of all the prophets and all the king and lord and master of them but jesus now it's likely but i'm not sure that some message preachers will say this since the elijah forerunner of christ at the close of the old testament was the greatest then the elijah forerunner and restorer of the new testament would be the greatest that's certainly a possibility but again jesus never specifically said the elijah restore of the new testament would be the greatest new testament christian of all time nor did brother branham say it with us saith the lord or even as his opinion we have no bible evidence for this claim but we do have brother ram's own written words saying he thought the greatest preaching was done in the man age or the reformation period yet today's preachers will correct brother branham's opinion about the man age yet while claiming no one should correct brother branham consider also the following brother branham will be judged by paul's gospel and not the other way around paul will not be judged by brother branham's gospel this is according to romans 2 verse 16 in that day when god shall judge the secrets of men by jesus christ according to my gospel brother branham preached what paul preached in other words brother adam could not add to what jesus had already given paul brother branham said he could not add or take away one word from what paul preached and taught this leads me to think paul might be the greatest christian servant of all time but again i'm only guessing since jesus did not tell us who would be the greatest new testament believer and only the father knew who would sit on his right and left hands i think it's normal to meditate on which believer would be the greatest in the father's eyes in the new testament after reading matthew 11 16 but i think it's wrong to emphatically declare its brother branham and us current message believers with no biblical support speaking of our lord jesus he dealt with the goat debate during his earthly ministry when his disciples argued about who was the greatest as seen in mark 9 verses 33-37 jesus had a child placed among his arguing disciples and urged them to become humble like a child which they would be in the 10 days leading up to the day of pentecost for that was the moment in acts chapter 2 when they were born again into the kingdom of god and had childlike faith note also that jesus says the greatest is the servant of all and other words from jesus show the greatest reward which is a hundred fold reward is for the missionary who leaves family wife etc to preach the gospel as jesus taught in matthew 19 verses 27 through 30. it's also important to recognize that jesus disciples were arguing the goat debate before they were born again and we never saw them discussing this issue after they were born again in the book of acts so where does that place the preachers who today do not argue but as i observed online seem to rather take turns exalting one another as the greatest or among the greatest of all time it would seem either they're not born again or they could be born again with awful prideful sinful complexes because the book of acts saints did not discuss how great they were paul did note that he labored more than all the apostles but he did it to assure the corinthians that he was indeed one of the firsthand witnesses of the resurrection of the lord jesus christ like the 11 other apostles in 1st corinthians 15 verses 1 through 10. and he also told the corinthians in second corinthians 11 verse 5 he was not a wit behind the very chiefest apostles because he was trying to prove that he was a genuine apostle and to persuade the corinthians not to listen to the false apostles it's important to see that it's likely that the 11 faithful apostles of jesus christ with the 12th apostle possibly being saint paul or matthias who argued about being the greatest seem to be elevated to the greatest seats of honor up in heaven's seventh dimension or the third heaven during this current church age time period as seen in matthew 19 28 and revelation 4 verse 4. in matthew 19 28 jesus said the apostles would sit upon 12 thrones judging the 12 tribes of israel and this may be in the millennium or the future home in revelation 4 4 we see that 24 seats around the throne of god in heaven 12 of them were for the apostles and 12 were for the sons of jacob another major text is matthew 20 verses 21-24 which shows the mother of james and john requesting that her two sons sit on the right and left hand of jesus to which jesus says it's up to the father who would sit closest to him and it was not given to jesus to assign the seats with the highest honor here we learn a great lesson that if jesus himself did not know which saints were the goats or the ones that deserve the highest honor how can message preachers today know and publicly declare that they are the goats or the greatest christians of all time i humbly ask do message preachers have greater knowledge than jesus himself i think the answer is no so it seems the greatest sinner saved by grace the greatest servants are the twelve apostles because they will judge the twelve tribes of israel and they currently already have seats around jesus throne in heaven right now during the church ages and this makes sense because most of them were missionaries most of them traveled and spent years preaching the gospel in other lands and 11 out of the 12 gave their lives as martyrs saint john the divine was the only one who did not die as a martyr he just died of natural old age and that fits with what jesus said jesus told peter that because they had left houses families and their occupations he would give them a hundred fold reward i want to notice too that brother branham judged the current preachers of his day in comparison against the apostles in this quote from presuming 1962 brother branham noted how the preachers of his day were totally different than the apostles because of their attitude towards money brother random said preachers of his day were concerned about being billionaires and bragging about how much money they had he said how different it was from the original pentecost when they got the holy ghost they sold everything and gave to the poor so do today's message preachers resemble the poor apostles who constantly remember the poor or do today's message preachers resemble the rich preachers of brother branham that were bragging about how much they had and about how great they were and of course this is based upon acts 2 45 acts 4 verse 33 through 35 acts 3 verse 6 and galatians 2 verses 9 and 10. let's listen to the quote i see what they're thinking about what are you telling them they belong to these big former marks and they're prosperous or billionaires i said how different you are always bragging about what you got how much you accumulated in this much time i said how different it is from the original pentecost they sold everything to have you to the poor i said you vice versa that people knows all about what it means to be rich they want to find something that satisfies it's got some life in it here's another important quote from the laodicean church age 1960 brother branham said jesus didn't commend this church the laodicean church he had a complaint against it not a command he didn't commend this for nothing this laodicean age now to me this quote is very important because brother ram said we do not need commending by jesus we need rebuked so how can message preachers commend themselves as the greatest of all time and yet jesus did not commend this age brother branham said for nothing let's listen to the quote now now the next verse would be to the other churches come in but he didn't command this church he had to complain against it not a command he had a complaint for this church not a command it's also important to know that jesus promised the overcomers of laodicea the highest compliment ever paid to a humble steadfast group in revelation 3 verse 21 as brother am taught in the church age book but again remember this promise is not just for the laodicean saints it's for every overcomer of every church age as he that overcometh inherits all things let's listen to the quote yet in verse 21 to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also overcame and am set down with my father in his throne we find the true vine true spirit true church people exalted to the very throne of god with the highest compliment ever paid to a humble steadfast spiritual group now now ladies that's the last church ages could be some overcomers in that watch they remember each church age that one preceding it inherits all that the other one is offered watch up here in this quote from how can i overcome 1963 brother ram said laodicea is the grandest of all ages because it blends into eternity but a few moments before that he said it needed a sharp rebuke he never said we were the greatest christians though we might have the greatest amount of revelation of the word of god the restored word of god including the seven seals but jesus christ's description of laodicea says nothing about us being greater than any other age let's listen to the quotes we see that knowing that this is the lady of age and knowing that this age needs a sharp rebuke from god it needs a sharp review and when uh our clergy gets so soft and dirty we see this age that we're living in it's one of the grandest ages of all ages this ladies church age is the grandest of all the church ages because it's the ending of time and the blending of eternity and then it's the greatest sinful age it's more sin in this age than it's ever been and the powers of satan is as many times harder to fight against than it was in any age in one place brother branham called laodicea the grandest of all ages but here in this quote from does he change 1965 brother branham said we're in the worst age of them all let's listen to the quote now i claim that he is alive today and his spirit after the church ages were in the ladies and churches the last call the worst of all of them because he was plucked out of the church remember son of man and he was put out of the church not an organization out of an organization but a person out of an organization none of the other church agents had that since the lady i'll see you if you're spiritual you'll understand remember matthew 5 verse 19 jesus says the great ones in the kingdom of heaven do and teach the truth there are so many message preachers today that attack true doctrine they attack the preaching of doctrine and friends sadly they're modeling a prideful attitude before their congregations and even the children by exalting themselves as the goats of christianity jesus said whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments and shall teach men so he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven but whosoever shall do and teach them the same should be called great in the kingdom of heaven a plea for humility in first peter 5 5 peter says be clothed with humility friends humility is an attitude we must put on daily as paul said we must die daily he said be renewed in the spirit of your mind day by day as we humble ourselves we will serve others for the greatest among us will be the servants so today's preachers and all message believers must ask themselves am i serving or are others serving me friend one way to increase your humility is to increase your secret acts of service to god as brother branham said in the church age book and also as jesus says in the sermon on the mount let's listen to the quote from the church age book where brother ram says we increase our service unto god i know thy works and the last to be more than the first this is certainly remarkable as the darkness of the age increased as the honor roll of the martyrs grew lengthier day by day they worked all the harder they served all the more and their faith increased how tragic it was that in the ephesian age love waned and truly nothing is said of the increased labor of love in the other ages but in this age and the darkest of all ages they served him even more what a lesson that is there is no ceasing of this gracious service of love unto the lord but rather an increasing of it that is the secret let the enemy attempt to thwart our service to the lord our reply is increased service when the faint are crying in fear that is the time to shout the victory friends some preachers are exalting themselves rather than humbling themselves we should all humble ourselves and let god exalt us in god's time in season and not let others exalt us brother bran was so humble he never called himself the goat he never called himself the greatest of all time in fact in the seventh seal he said give all the credit to jesus christ he said i'm not fit to live and i'm not saying that to be humble he said let's be gems in the crown of jesus christ let's listen to the quotes um i'm open and trusting that you people realize that i'm trying to put this grace on jesus christ who is the author of all of it and the only reason you never heard me talk like this before in your life but this hour is approaching amen may you always bear that in mind to be a gem in the crown of jesus christ paul said to the church you are you are the jewels the gems of his crown we want to be the gems of the crown of jesus christ we don't want never put a man in it you forget anything about me i am your brother a sinner saved by grace not fit to live that's exactly the truth i stand out to be humble that's facts there's nothing in me not one sound thing at all but the grace of god has left my poor dimming eyes look beyond [Music] in this next quote from questions in answers 59 brother branham said he said when you act like jesus that's where you find the holy spirit and the holy spirit makes you meek makes you humble makes you forgiving how can the holy spirit be upon preachers that are exalting themselves as the greatest of all time that's a prideful thing to do not a humble thing to do it would seem either they're not born again or they could be born again with awful prideful sinful complexes let's listen to the quote now if the spirit of elijah upon john would make john act like elijah the spirit of god upon you will make you act like jesus now there's where you find the holy spirit that's what the holy spirit does it makes you unique makes you humble makes you forgiving next is a beautiful quote from influence 1963. brother graham said he had to constantly plead that god would not lift his hands from him he said all men are subject to mistakes and brother ram said he would fall if god ever lifted his hand off his life let's listen to the quote now that's us any man any he's subject to man because he's human he's subject to the violations of god's laws and he's subject to many things because satan tempts him and he's just a human being and god ever lifted his hands and fall that's all and um i've heard people say oh satan can't do it yes you just let god lift his hand one time and watch what happened it's uh i constantly plead god don't send him have mercy on me keep him away from you see i need god's mercy and we all need that friends let's do what the scripture says let's humble ourselves let us pray in secret fast and secret give alms in secret jesus said when you hold a feast invite the people who cannot pay you back when peter and paul left one another in galatians chapter 2 the bible said their last words were to remember the poor that's what the early apostles cared about and that's what we should care about today and lastly friends here's a quote from power transformation where brother brahm says we have no brag only on jesus christ we only brag on jesus christ friends preachers should not be bragging on one another we should not be exalting one another calling each other the greatest of all time or some of the greatest in history we should only be exalting the lord jesus christ let's listen to the quote come forth god ordained it so that there must come forth them seven seals must be open it was supposed to be done in this lady of sea and age and i think beyond any shadow of doubt not as we brag we have no brag only on jesus christ none of us we only brag on jesus christ but we are thankful for the privilege of knowing but only beyond any shadow of doubt god has chosen us in this last days and has proven it by the signs and the heavens and the earth and every one of them coming right straight back to the word to prove that it's so this age that we live in the message and how it is we're not a cult we're not a bunch of fanatics we are servants of god that's been called by the holy ghost you'll have all kinds of names tagged to you but that don't mean it's so in closing friends there's so much more on this topic i was overwhelmed by the amount of quotes and scriptures on the subject of the sin of pride each one of us need to examine ourselves daily to make sure we're in the faith as ii corinthians says humbling ourself under the mighty hand of god let us pray for the preachers who are exalting themselves and their congregations as the greatest of all time let's pray they humble themselves before god has to humble them let us only brag on the lord jesus christ let us not worry about where we are ranked among the greatest of all time let's be concerned about doing the father's business spreading the gospel winning souls praying for the sick prayer fasting giving of alms being a true child of the heavenly father as jesus said let us be children of our father and friends if we're a continuation of the book of acts church then we should do what they did we should be so concerned about the members in our church if any of them lack anything we should be the first ones to help them out to make sure we have all things in common because the spirit of jesus christ is divine love and divine love is a thing we need to make it over there by the grace of god if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me god bless you and may jesus christ be the desire of your heart
