TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] We feel today that there's not too much time left, but we must be up and doing. We must be urging and compelling that every member that's been ordained beforehand to the body of Christ that we spread this message till everyone hears so we're sure that every effort that we could have put forth has been done. Greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of this video is to share the different reasons I started a YouTube channel back in 2013 by God's grace. This coming October will be the 11th year that I've done YouTube videos. My first video was called True Repentance, part one of three, released October 3rd, 2014. So, it's hard to believe it's been that many years already, but here we are 459 videos later by God's grace. And I guess the first reason that I started the YouTube channel was just for general outreach. I've always loved outreach, whether it's books or videos or tracks or pamphlets about the revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ for this day, the end time message. There's been numerous tracks, sermons, books that have helped me over the years. Especially tracks about water baptism in the Godhead. Those were very effective for me seeing the history of how baptism was changed and how the trinity dogma was added to the Bible. It was added to the false church system. But I'm so thankful for people that took the time to write the books or the pamphlets or make the videos that spread the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. I made a recent video about the radio ministry of brother Neville that brother Brandham supported so positively. Of course, brother Ram did outreach with his campaigns, but also with his tapes. He talked about how the tapes would go into the jungles of Africa and so forth. And the message is still going around the world today. That's my humble belief about the shout voice Trump. The shout is still going out. As I said a couple years ago, this former Amish group down in central Ohio received the shout. They heard the shout to get them ready for the bridegroom's coming by the grace of God. So, I just love outreach. Whether God uses a book or a pamphlet or a postcard, I love how God's word will not return void. A precious brother named Mike Durle who passed away a number of years ago. I always remember his testimony. He was living in sin, blatant, obvious, abominable sin. And one day, somebody handed him a small business card that just talked about brother Brandham being sent as a prophet. He wrote a letter. This was before the internet. He wrote a letter to Voice of God Recordings, got free books, and came into the message and he left his abominable lifestyle and served the Lord faithfully until the Lord took him home. So, I just love outreach. Second reason, and this is kind of related to outreach, is that there was a lot of loved ones in my family, even my parents, of course, aunts, uncles, cousins that did not believe the message right away. And so I wanted a platform where they could hear the truth straight from me and I'd be smiling at times and happy not always preaching with all the emotion that I I do perhaps the seriousness although that can be effective as well. I've had different family members come to our services and thoroughly enjoy them and there is a lot of motion. There's a lot of noise, a lot of worship. The Bible says praise him with a loud noise. But in my heart, I just wanted uh family members to be able to hear the truth that I received because it was life-changing to me. As some of you know, my testimony, the first sermon I ever heard was Serpent Seed, not preached by Brother Brandham, but preached by Chris Hall, who has left the message. But the truth of that sermon or those two sermons on Serpent Seed opened my eyes and I've never been the same by God's grace. The Bible became a new book, a new Bible as brother Ram said, because of the revelation of Jesus Christ. And brother Ram said, "Serpent seed doesn't save you, but it just shines more light on the truth that we're all trying to see." And so that was monumental for me to hear the truth of the serpent seed. And I wanted my family to be able to hear the truth. Even if they were afraid to come to church, that's fine. Perhaps they would go on my YouTube channel and hear the truth there. And I've gotten numerous reports over the years that my family would do that. I used to be on Facebook. I'm not anymore. Perhaps I'll get back on at some point in order to spread the gospel. But I used to share links to my YouTube videos on my Facebook page and family members would email me or text me and say they watch my videos. So that was a huge blessing to me. That's all I really want is for each person to have a chance to hear the gospel. Just like brother Ram said, everybody deserves a chance to hear the gospel of Jesus Christ. The third reason I felt led to start a YouTube channel was because previous to 2013, I'd made about four overseas trips to South America. I was invited to go along. My former pastor would invite me and I just loved to go. It was so wonderful. Sometimes I'd go for 7 8 9 10 I think one time up to 13 days. But around 2013, I think I made my fourth and final trip. And that's because we started having the ability to do FaceTime. And I would FaceTime with my wife and children. By that time, I had four children and my wife was pregnant with our fifth. And we already live as a family. We live 3 hours away from any other family. And we're a very small church. Everybody's working busy. And so all the burden of taking care of the children was all my wife and she's pregnant. And so both she and I would miss each other. so much. 13 days is a long time uh for me to be away from my wife and children and we would just cry and I would miss my children so much and my wife of course I love the work of the Lord, the ministry of the Lord, but I just kind of had to make a decision there. Do I continue in evangelism or should I just focus on pastoring to be with my family? So, I felt led of the Holy Ghost to focus on pastoring which is fine. Uh the Bible talks about convenient seasons. There's convenient seasons to do certain ministries. Even look at the Proverbs 31 woman. There's no way she was doing all of those ministries at the same time. She's probably focusing in her early days as a wife and mother on rising early, getting the children's clothes, getting the meals ready, and everything like that. And then later on, she was probably looking at fields, buying them, purchasing them. So, as the Bible says, there's a time and season for everything. And I was also given advice from older ministers saying, I should stay with my family as much as possible. try not to leave them. One minister in particular told me that he felt bad he left his children behind too many times. And so he advised me as a young father, stay with your children as much as possible. And then on top of that, I kept getting invites from people around the world. And I'm also a school teacher, so I only have a few months really to travel. It's really June, July, and the beginning of August. And so I felt bad turning down these invitations, but at the same time, I got to make a choice. Do I support my family or do I leave my family? So, I wanted to support my family, be with my children more, support my wife cuz she has no help really being that we're 3 hours away from our natural families, our in-laws and our parents by God's grace. And so, making a YouTube channel would allow these preachers that invited me to preach to hear my ministry if they felt led to. Of course, they don't have to, but they're the ones that invited me. So, I thought I would make a YouTube channel so these foreign ministers could hear my preaching if they felt they enjoyed what the Holy Spirit was preaching through me. I'm nothing. I'm a sinner saved by grace, but everybody has one gift. If you're a preacher, you have one of the five gifts, perhaps more. If you're not a preacher, you have at least one of the nine gifts of the Holy Ghost. So, if these brethren that invited me felt I had some type of a gift, well, then they could enjoy that gift as I yielded to the Holy Ghost. But I'm nothing. As John 15:5 says, "Apart from me, Jesus says you can do nothing." So this YouTube channel gave me the feeling where I could somehow help these brothers who invited me to hear the ministry that God had given me by the grace of God. And the fourth reason and final reason I started this YouTube channel was because in 2012, the Believe the Sign website switched over from being supportive of Brother Brandham to being against Brother Brandham. And so that came as a big shock to me because I had links on our church's website and so forth to believe the signs website because they were supportive of brother Brandham. And then I had to take the links down of course. And even in my 2020 debate, I told the man I debated, Rod Bergen, I told him one of the reasons I started my channel was to help people like him, people that did not believe the message any longer, to try to show them what I felt was the truth of the message, that Brother Brandham was a genuine prophet of God. And in recent years, I've just called it defending brother Brandham because he was a Bible-based prophet of God. And when uh Believe the Sign did their switch over to being against Brother Brandham, I didn't have a lot of the answers to their questions. And that kind of bothered me. And I wanted to find the answers. And through these years of studying, making videos and so forth, it's really helped me to provide answers for people that have questions. And I wanted to be honest and humble. Like if I don't have an answer, well, I want to go search an answer because the Bible says that be ready to give every man an answer for the hope that he has within him. Of course, I know there's other verses in Proverbs where it says to not answer people if they're being foolish or something like that. But if people have genuine questions, they're not name calling, they're not berating me or something like that, then I want to try to answer their questions humbly as the scripture says, the Bible does say prove all things. So, we need to do that as well. And I have honestly so enjoyed the questions because it sharpens me. If I'm not sure of something, I got to go back to the scripture. I got to go back to the quotes. I got to find the balance because the Bibles are absolute. If brother Ram said something, then I want to find it in the Bible. And if not, well, then he's allowed his own humble opinions just like everybody else. Brother Ram said his opinion was no different than anybody else's opinion. So, Brother Ram was a humble, godly, holy ghostfilled Christian by the grace of God. And I think it's okay to ask questions. There's nothing wrong with asking questions. And so for me, I wanted to be able to answer questions through the scripture. And answering questions has certainly sharpened me, my faith, and I wanted to prove to myself and others that what I believe is based upon the Bible. And if there is things Brother Ram said that aren't in the Bible, well, that's fine. He's allowed to have his opinion. Then those aren't my core beliefs. But all of my core beliefs come from the scripture because the scripture is my absolute. And if we have the Holy Ghost, it'll always point us back to the word. Jesus said every man should live by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God. So that's what we want to do. We want to take all our beliefs back to the word of God. And I've enjoyed this online ministry so much as this visual shows. You know, my channel reached a peak there at the end of 2018 and 2019 and then it's just been decreasing since then, which is okay. So, at the beginning of my ministry started with larger topics, more general topics, makeup in the Bible, repentance, Godhead, marriage and divorce, general topics. And now recently, I've been able to reach out to lots of other topics, questions and answers, quote videos. I'd also say I started off with a lot of majors and now I'm down into minors by the grace of God. Minor subjects, but it's a blessing. It's always a a help to me. It's a good way to stay in the word of God. I believe Paul told Timothy, "Give yourself h wholly to these things, studying the scripture, exhortation." And so that's one benefit of the YouTube channel as well. Helps me stay focused in the word of God. Iron sharpens iron. So when I get questions or emails, even against the message, that does sharpen me. I try to humbly answer the questions and do the best I can by the grace of God. No man's perfect. I don't have all the answers, but I know Jesus Christ has all the answers. We'll learn a lot of them on this side, but we're going to learn even a lot more on the other side by the grace of God. So friends, I hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God. Thanks for all your support, all your comments, all your questions. I love the word of God. I love Jesus Christ. I love the Holy Ghost. I love the message of the hour. It's a joy to make videos. Yes, it's a labor at times as well, but as Paul said, it's a labor of love. I love the word of God. I love spreading the word of God. If you feel led to share these videos, please do by the grace of God. If you have any questions, concerns, or testimonies about this video, please contact me. God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart. Very happy to be here this afternoon and again in defense of the gospel of Jesus Christ to bring the good tidings, the good news that Jesus raised from the dead, living among man today, his church. The same Jesus that was yesterday will be today and forever. It never fails. [Music]
