[13:12] prayers
[13:13] for complete victory i will pray for my
[13:16] wife's
[13:16] sense of smell i believe to come back by
[13:19] god's grace
[13:20] let's pray for that also my mother's uh
[13:24] recovering she said she turned the
[13:25] corner doing better i just still needs
[13:27] prayer to get back to work
[13:29] let's pray for my brother paul as well i
[13:31] haven't heard any updates from him

[13:44] uh
[13:45] sends greetings of course obviously to
[13:48] our family and your family of course
[13:50] but he said pray for ghana because they
[13:52] may
[13:53] lock everything down again i guess so
[13:56] he's concerned about that so he asked
[13:58] for prayer
[13:59] so let's pray for the country of ghana
[14:01] and ask god to guide the leaders
[14:04] where they make the right decisions so

[29:34] we'll just read one verse tonight uh
[29:38] romans 11 25 i'd like to look at this
[29:40] next chapter
[29:43] uh the mystery of israel's spiritual
[29:46] blindness so let's look at that here
[29:51] i'm sorry romans 11 25.
[30:04] romans 11 25.
[30:11] just one verse sorry wrong
[30:22] romans 11 25 by god's grace
[30:26] let's read that together on three one
[30:28] two
[30:29] three for i would not brethren
[30:32] that ye should be ignorant of this
[30:35] mystery
[30:36] lest ye should be wise in your own
[30:39] conceits
[30:40] that blindness is in part is happened
[30:44] to israel until the fullness
[30:47] of the gentiles become in
[30:50] so let's have a word of prayers ask god
[30:52] to minister to us let's not forget as
[30:54] we're looking at israel
[30:55] let's remember let's not look away from
[30:58] ourselves we just want to look at them
[31:00] and see what god did
[31:01] and ought to raise our faith to
[31:03] understand what god is doing right now
[31:06] and the confidence we should have that
[31:08] he's going to finish this gentile age
[31:10] all the fullness of the gentiles will be
[31:12] brought in right before the rapture
[31:14] so it all ties together by god's grace
[31:16] let's pray ask god to meet
[31:18] all the needs heavenly father we love

[31:30] not holy
[31:30] but you share your spirit with us and
[31:32] that makes us holy lord god
[31:34] to the degree that a human could be holy
[31:37] in our souls lord we know your spirit
[31:39] abides there that makes us holy
[31:41] and we're grateful for that eternally
[31:43] lord god as you've given us
[31:45] eternal life but father we need your
[31:47] holiness in our minds
[31:48] and in our bodies lord god so we pray

[32:06] tonight lord god help us to
[32:08] get our eyes lord god and praying for
[32:10] others of course
[32:11] uh the lost but also israel the blinded
[32:14] and remember your people lord remember
[32:16] to pray for peace
[32:18] in israel so father we bless your name
[32:20] tonight thank you god for your mercy we
[32:22] pray you anoint me anoint your people
[32:24] in jesus christ's name the saint said
[32:27] amen god bless you
[32:34] lord willing we'll need some readers
[32:35] children so if you've got your bibles we
[32:37] appreciate that
[32:40] uh tonight we're uh looking forward to
[32:42] this little lesson on uh
[32:45] israel's spiritual blindness
[32:50] you know i just had a few thoughts uh
[32:52] you know recently you know with israel
[32:54] we've seen how uh
[32:56] you know the united states has led the
[32:58] way in helping israel
[33:00] uh make a few peace deals i believe i'm
[33:02] not mistaken there's three or four
[33:04] i was reading a little bit before
[33:06] service but didn't have a chance to read
[33:07] as much as i'd like
[33:09] but people were shocked there hadn't
[33:10] been peace deals in over 25 years
[33:14] so people were very surprised at these
[33:17] people that care about israel
[33:18] sinners don't care but those of us who
[33:21] are believers and know the scripture
[33:22] know the history of god's word
[33:25] uh we're very encouraged by that now one
[33:27] article there may one
[33:28] article i read tonight made it sound
[33:29] like uh one one country may only have
[33:32] peace with israel be
[33:33] recognized israel for financial gain of
[33:36] course that's not real peace right
[33:38] uh so we understand that uh we know some
[33:40] of the reasons why
[33:42] uh that peace may be between israel and
[33:44] other countries uh
[33:46] is is not because they respect judaism
[33:49] or
[33:49] israel's god it's because it's a
[33:51] financial gain or a political gain we
[33:54] understand that
[33:54] and we know at the end time you know uh
[33:57] we know there will be a peace treaty
[33:59] i believe uh through my most recent
[34:01] study
[34:02] that the peace deal will be seven years
[34:04] uh between rome and israel
[34:06] and the world but then it'll be broken
[34:08] in the midst of the week after three and
[34:10] a half years
[34:11] and then nations will come up against
[34:13] israel but that time jesus christ will
[34:15] come
[34:16] michael will stand up actually before
[34:18] that according to
[34:19] daniel chapter 12. michael will stand up
[34:22] for the people
[34:23] of israel and the bible said those whose
[34:26] names are on the book
[34:27] will be saved so
[34:30] uh we see you know israel having a
[34:33] little more peace
[34:34] aren't you glad god's heard our prayers
[34:35] right no doubt their prayers as well
[34:38] as they pray constantly at the western
[34:41] wall they're just constantly praying
[34:43] offering prayers to god
[34:44] uh and yet god hears them certainly
[34:47] because
[34:48] they're blinded so we know israel plays
[34:51] an important part
[34:52] because as we read here in the scripture
[34:54] tonight we read that
[34:56] israel is blinded until all the gentiles
[35:00] are come in that are going to be saved
[35:01] that includes the wise virgin
[35:03] and the foolish virgin praise god so we
[35:06] know there's a certain number and as
[35:08] soon as god is done with that number
[35:10] of souls that are saved then god is done
[35:13] with the gentiles the bible
[35:15] likens it unto cutting off a branch so
[35:17] god cuts off the access to his life
[35:20] to the prayer answers to the healings
[35:22] all these things and then judgment
[35:24] strikes the gentiles of course
[35:26] in the tribulation period but then
[35:29] israel's grafted back in
[35:31] uh and given the life of god through the
[35:34] two prophets right
[35:35] and we know they'll rebuild their temple
[35:37] they'll have animal sacrifices until
[35:39] uh sometime after the two
[35:42] prophets come uh and and die and are
[35:46] resurrected and raptured and then the
[35:49] the the the remnant will glorify god
[35:53] it won't be long after that after all
[35:55] the armies come up against israel
[35:57] jesus christ will come and protect those
[36:00] hundred forty four thousand of course
[36:01] he'll reveal himself
[36:02] to them as well uh so we
[36:06] understand that about israel we'll get
[36:08] to maybe more of that lord willing in
[36:09] the next few weeks
[36:11] by god's grace but i just want to remind
[36:14] uh everyone of some good scriptures here
[36:17] so i have a scripture i like to read in
[36:20] first corinthians 2
[36:22] verse 10. so lydia can you get that
[36:24] first corinthians
[36:26] 2 10.
[36:32] this is a beautiful scripture about the
[36:33] deep things of god
[36:36] and as our church knows don't ever be
[36:38] critical of the mysteries of god i know
[36:40] some people are critical of them but
[36:42] we're not critical of the mysteries we
[36:44] know the mysteries
[36:46] reveal they're there to hide it from the
[36:48] wise and prudent but
[36:50] they're there so god can then reveal the
[36:52] revelation of the mystery
[36:54] to those who truly believe his children
[36:58] those uh those who really want to become
[37:01] his family and and understand that the
[37:04] things of god
[37:05] those who want to do the will of god god
[37:08] reveals it to them
[37:09] so lydia if you could read first
[37:11] corinthians
[37:12] 2 10 please but god hath revealed them
[37:16] unto us by his spirit for the spirit
[37:18] searches all things yea the deep things
[37:20] of god
[37:21] okay so those who have the holy spirit
[37:24] those who are really born again in
[37:26] church i hope everybody's
[37:28] catching this next thought if you're
[37:31] born again the spirit will guide you
[37:33] into the deeper things right remember
[37:35] even jesus one time said we need to
[37:37] launch out into the deep
[37:38] he had some more teaching to do and some
[37:40] miracles he had to launch out into the
[37:42] deep to reveal himself
[37:44] uh in a special situation right he said
[37:46] launch out into the deep
[37:47] to reveal more of himself well here the
[37:50] scripture is clear on that
[37:52] um the spirit searches right the deep
[37:55] things of god
[37:57] okay so it's not two persons searching
[37:59] out you know
[38:00] the holy spirit searching out the things
[38:02] of the first person right it's not the
[38:03] third person searching out the first
[38:05] person
[38:05] it's the holy spirit in us uh the spirit
[38:08] searching the deep things of god of the
[38:11] spirit
[38:12] okay so if we are born again we will
[38:15] naturally
[38:16] be drawn to the mysteries we know around
[38:19] the message a lot of people recognize
[38:20] god sent a prophet
[38:22] but they get cold and complacent and
[38:24] they fail
[38:25] to get born again but if they get born
[38:27] again the spirit will guide them into
[38:29] the deeper things right
[38:30] into the promised land into their
[38:32] inheritance into their possessions
[38:33] praise god
[38:35] uh and then into the deep things of god
[38:38] which the deepest things that god would
[38:40] have to reveal to us would be mysteries
[38:42] and we know revelation 10 7 said the
[38:44] mystery of god
[38:45] would be finished it would be eaten and
[38:48] then by john it would be taken around
[38:50] the world
[38:50] to every nation kindred tongue people to
[38:53] the gentiles
[38:54] so we know it is prophecy from the holy
[38:56] spirit that
[38:57] everyone uh or every nation will hear
[39:00] the revealed mystery of god we're
[39:02] privileged to be able to hear it for
[39:04] many years praise god
[39:05] since the time brother left the scene
[39:07] about 55 years ago we've been privileged
[39:09] to hear the mysteries of god
[39:12] so if you have the holy spirit it will
[39:14] cause you to search your bible
[39:17] it should be your favorite book and the
[39:18] children said
[39:20] i said amen it should be your favorite
[39:22] book because the spirit is going to
[39:24] guide you
[39:24] to search the deep things of god now of
[39:27] course god
[39:28] can lead us into history of course god
[39:29] can lead us into the arts and you know
[39:31] sciences and things like that
[39:33] but while we're in that we should be
[39:34] able to find knowledge about god as well
[39:37] and it should always draw us back to the
[39:38] bible because the holy spirit will guide
[39:41] us to search the deep things
[39:43] of god okay it's just like a marriage
[39:45] right
[39:46] any happy marriage the couple learns
[39:48] more and more about each other over the
[39:50] years
[39:51] right because they're truly in love but
[39:53] if a couple's not truly in love or they
[39:56] fall out of love or they backslide out
[39:57] of love then they don't care to spend
[39:59] any time with
[40:00] each other anymore or learn more about
[40:02] it or or hear about how their
[40:05] uh their their life is going you know
[40:07] have that godly relationship
[40:09] that a marriage couple should have it's
[40:11] the same thing with god
[40:12] if you're truly jesus's bride if you
[40:14] truly love jesus
[40:15] you want to learn more about him okay so
[40:18] i just want to bring that scripture out
[40:20] and it's the same thing daniel 2 22 says
[40:22] he revealeth the deep and secret things
[40:25] he knoweth what is in the darkness and
[40:28] the light
[40:29] dwelleth with him okay
[40:32] so this is god's character god reveals
[40:35] deep things
[40:37] to those who want to receive it to those
[40:39] who want
[40:40] uh the light to be turned on right the
[40:42] bible said we were in gross darkness
[40:43] right the bible said we were dead in
[40:45] sins we were children of the night but
[40:47] when you come to christ
[40:48] the light turns on has anyone ever been
[40:51] thankful for a light to be turned on in
[40:52] the night time
[40:54] so you don't stumble and crash into
[40:55] something i do it all the time
[40:57] that's why i put my phone on the
[40:59] flashlight mode
[41:00] i gotta have some light because i'm
[41:02] gonna have trouble if i don't have light
[41:04] well god's
[41:05] spirit reveals turns on the light
[41:09] to reveal his plan his
[41:12] secret things then they're no longer
[41:14] secret right
[41:15] now their secret to the world because
[41:16] the bible said we speak the wisdom of
[41:18] god
[41:19] in a mystery praise god and so when we
[41:22] talk when we preach many people can't
[41:23] understand our sermons
[41:24] because they're deeper they're more
[41:26] mysterious you have to have a
[41:28] more revelation to understand the
[41:31] current revelation
[41:33] so uh we thank god for that and we're
[41:36] not better than anybody but
[41:38] uh we are hung we're more hungry than
[41:40] other people to know the deep things of
[41:42] god
[41:42] and by god's grace we receive more
[41:44] revelation than others not
[41:45] not because of anything we've done but
[41:47] because of god's grace and god's mercy
[41:49] to us
[41:50] as we've said is lord show all your
[41:52] truth to me and god has poured out
[41:53] abundantly from heaven praise god so
[41:58] let's now i just want to read that
[42:00] scripture there that you saw that the
[42:01] spirit
[42:02] has to guide us into deeper things if
[42:04] we're born again
[42:06] because it searches the deep things okay
[42:09] so before getting to the blindness i
[42:10] just want to tonight lord willing
[42:12] tonight's
[42:13] service i'll set the timer for about 30
[42:16] more minutes we've probably done
[42:18] uh 10 already
[42:22] uh we like to uh just do a quick
[42:25] brief history of israel's history
[42:28] interacting with god
[42:30] okay so we'll look at that and lord
[42:32] willing tonight we'll look at some
[42:33] numerous scriptures so
[42:35] please have your bibles handy children
[42:37] so if you start at adam and eve you find
[42:39] his godly seedline was going to go
[42:42] through abel but he was killed so god
[42:43] raised up another seed
[42:45] seth and then you see that that
[42:48] godly seed from seth to noah
[42:52] of course remember seth after seth the
[42:53] men begin to call upon the name of the
[42:55] lord praise god
[42:57] see it's that it's that new seed right
[42:58] that calls upon the name of the lord
[43:01] praise god uh then noah had three sons
[43:04] ham
[43:04] shem and japheth shem is the faithful
[43:07] servant to god
[43:08] in all things and then uh
[43:12] out of uh shem uh god promised
[43:15] uh to bless father abraham he's the
[43:18] ninth descendant
[43:19] from shem so nine descendants later
[43:23] abraham comes forth and god recognizes
[43:28] that the seed of abraham is going to be
[43:31] a blessing
[43:32] to the entire world so god is going to
[43:34] use this special
[43:37] believing seed line right to bless the
[43:40] whole world
[43:41] and that's in genesis 17 19 and 20 21.
[43:45] malachi can read that
[43:46] genesis 17 19 20 and 21 genesis 17
[43:52] 19-21
[44:00] yes and god said sarah thy wife shall
[44:05] bear thee a son indeed and thou shalt
[44:06] call his name
[44:07] isaac and i will establish my covenant
[44:09] with him for an everlasting covenant
[44:11] with this eat after him
[44:12] and as for ishmael i have heard thee
[44:14] behold i have blessed him will make him
[44:16] fruitful
[44:16] [Music]
[44:17] exceedingly twelve princes shall he
[44:19] beget and i will make him a great nation
[44:22] but my covenant y established with isaac
[44:24] which sarah shall bear unto thee at this
[44:26] set time in the next year
[44:28] amen so notice the everlasting covenant
[44:30] goes with
[44:31] abraham i believe it was last summer if
[44:34] i'm not mistaken or maybe two summers
[44:35] ago
[44:36] these years go really fast remember we
[44:38] taught on the covenants children
[44:39] remember the eight covenants we taught
[44:40] on
[44:41] i know we did some of our services out
[44:43] there on the deck i don't know when it
[44:44] was really warm
[44:45] it might have been last spring actually
[44:47] i can't remember yeah it might have been
[44:48] last spring because the covet i think
[44:49] that's what it was
[44:51] um so i've already preached that part of
[44:54] this chapter
[44:56] but god gives the everlasting covenant
[44:58] to the believing seedline
[45:00] through abraham and isaac now five
[45:03] generations from
[45:04] isaac comes moses god's prophet
[45:07] to deliver israel out of egypt and
[45:10] slavery
[45:12] uh and once you get to moses time you
[45:14] see a lot of god's
[45:16] compassion of his love for his people
[45:19] these are some
[45:20] beautiful uh descriptions of god's love
[45:24] for his people so three months after the
[45:27] exodus and they're out in the wilderness
[45:29] god instructs moses to tell israel
[45:31] they're a special
[45:33] treasure to him so when was the last
[45:36] time anyone's told you you're a treasure
[45:37] to them
[45:39] that's very very very rare right you
[45:41] know it's it's a it's a beautiful
[45:43] description you are
[45:44] a special treasure not just a treasure
[45:47] you're a special treasure
[45:49] and that's in exodus 19 4 5 and 6. i'll
[45:52] read that one lydia because i'm already
[45:53] there
[45:54] he said you have seen what i did unto
[45:56] the egyptians and how i bury you on
[45:58] eagle's wings and brought you unto
[46:00] myself now therefore
[46:01] if you will only obey my voice indeed
[46:03] and keep my covenant
[46:04] then ye shall be a peculiar treasure
[46:07] unto me
[46:07] above all people for all the earth is
[46:12] mine
[46:13] and ye shall be unto me a kingdom of
[46:15] priests and holy nation
[46:17] these are the words which thou shalt
[46:19] speak unto the children of israel now
[46:21] can we just stop a moment church
[46:23] how many know that we are kings and
[46:25] priests unto god
[46:27] now this is under the blood of bulls and
[46:28] goats god said
[46:31] of all the nations you are the most
[46:33] special you're a peculiar
[46:35] uh special treasure unto me and you're a
[46:39] kingdom of priests so you're the ones
[46:41] that are interceding you're the ones
[46:43] that are
[46:44] dealing with uh god and man right
[46:47] and so how much more us we're under the
[46:49] blood of jesus christ oh my
[46:51] think about that of all the churches in
[46:53] akron and ohio
[46:54] akron area god looks on ours right
[46:58] has a very special fellowship because we
[47:00] believe
[47:01] more of his word because we've left the
[47:04] things of the world like
[47:05] abraham right we've left everything
[47:06] we've known and we've
[47:09] uh come out into the wilderness
[47:10] sanctified go in the promised land the
[47:12] baptism of the holy ghost
[47:14] and god sees our church as one that's
[47:16] following in the ways of god
[47:18] uh just not just justification
[47:19] justification is glorious
[47:21] but in onto sanctification where your
[47:24] whole life
[47:25] is cleaned out and set aside for service
[47:28] and then the holy ghost puts us
[47:29] into service praise god what a treasure
[47:31] we are to god
[47:33] in this hour praise god that we'll let
[47:35] god take away cussing
[47:37] uh and worldliness and cigarettes and
[47:40] and immodest clothing
[47:41] and immoral videos right and all the
[47:44] lust of the flesh
[47:45] we will let god take all that away and
[47:48] god says you're a special treasure under
[47:50] me so now i don't feel
[47:51] uh any uh conviction remember when i
[47:53] preach that uh
[47:54] how you're god's favorite yep see this
[47:58] is it right here this is it
[47:59] if israel was god's favor under blood of
[48:02] bulls and goats what about us under the
[48:03] blood of jesus christ
[48:05] see it's a it's a dearly beloved it's a
[48:08] special treasure peculiar people
[48:11] peculiar treasure
[48:12] church if you love jesus christ in that
[48:14] way you're a treasure to christ
[48:16] amen your love your songs tonight is a
[48:20] treasure to the king of kings and lord
[48:22] of lords let's say hallelujah you ready
[48:24] hallelujah thank you jesus what
[48:27] what i tell you those aren't those
[48:28] beautiful words those are just some of
[48:30] the
[48:32] most comforting words you could read
[48:34] that you're a treasure unto god
[48:36] and you're his priest you're the one
[48:39] who's going to deal
[48:41] with his dealings with other humans your
[48:44] family your friends
[48:45] your loved ones your associates your
[48:48] co-workers your your
[48:49] classmates god is going to use you
[48:53] and me to minister to those individuals
[48:57] and grant them grace or grant them
[48:58] warnings
[49:01] uh whatever god uh declares about their
[49:03] destiny
[49:04] because he has predetermined everything
[49:06] by his foreknowledge
[49:08] praise god so you couldn't hardly find
[49:12] any more beautiful comforting words than
[49:13] that could you they're just beautiful
[49:17] remember so israel was above egypt above
[49:20] persia above greece
[49:21] china japan russia you name it rome
[49:24] israel was above all them
[49:28] right uh and all of these the bible says
[49:32] we're
[49:32] aliens according to ephesians 2 12. so
[49:35] lydia can you get ephesians 2 12.
[49:37] bible said these were all aliens so you
[49:40] and i
[49:41] were previously aliens but israel was
[49:44] the chosen
[49:46] special privileged peculiar people
[49:50] in the earth all around all the earth
[49:53] if it is round uh
[49:56] israel was god's special people treasure
[50:00] because of god's grace to abraham and
[50:03] his seed
[50:04] so lydia uh ephesians 2 12
[50:08] that at the time you were without christ
[50:10] being aliens from the commonwealth of
[50:12] israel and strangers from the covenants
[50:13] of promise having no hope
[50:15] and without god in the world wow so look
[50:17] at that
[50:18] all these countries had no hope no
[50:21] covenants
[50:22] no guarantee from god god was just
[50:24] dealing with israel
[50:27] and church remember we got to look at
[50:28] that for today there's a very similar
[50:30] situation today
[50:31] anyone that denies the name of christ
[50:33] jesus said if you deny me before men
[50:35] i'll deny you before the father and the
[50:37] holy angels
[50:38] so look where people place themselves
[50:40] think about all the the
[50:42] the billions of muslims maybe the
[50:44] billions of hindus
[50:46] that deny jesus christ oh god be
[50:48] merciful
[50:49] is my prayer may god may some of them be
[50:51] watching tonight
[50:52] so they can know that they can have a
[50:53] covenant with god through jesus christ
[50:58] now this is a beautiful promise as we
[51:00] saw but remember it's by condition god
[51:03] said
[51:03] if israel obeyed if they kept a covenant
[51:07] they remain a kingdom of priests and a
[51:09] holy nation
[51:11] unto god but of course as we know they
[51:15] often wavered right
[51:17] uh and then uh some hundred eight so i'm
[51:20] sorry some 800 years before christ
[51:23] god anointed isaiah to foretell that
[51:26] spiritual blindness would come on them
[51:28] as a result of their rebellion
[51:31] now if you know i was looking this up
[51:33] earlier moses's covenant lasted about
[51:35] 1500
[51:36] years so that means about 700 years
[51:38] after the mosaic covenant
[51:40] god foretold and said this isn't going
[51:42] good i'm going to have to blind you
[51:44] right so after 700 years
[51:49] so that's maybe seven or eight nine
[51:50] generations right
[51:53] uh after that time god knew he was gonna
[51:56] have to blind them so he lets them know
[51:58] about 800 years in advance
[52:07] why don't you let her go and let her she
[52:09] can't stand back there
[52:12] sorry church just a moment
[52:19] so it was god knew it was going to be a
[52:21] covenant that lasted 1
[52:23] 500 years but 700 years almost halfway
[52:26] into it god lets isaiah know
[52:28] tell them that eventually i'm going to
[52:30] blind them he blind them about 800 years
[52:32] later
[52:33] through a spiritual blindness okay so
[52:35] the scripture says this it's isaiah 6
[52:38] 9-10 and he said go and tell this people
[52:41] hear ye indeed but understand not
[52:44] and see indeed and perceive not make the
[52:47] heart of this people fat and make their
[52:49] ears heavy
[52:50] and shut their eyes lest they see with
[52:52] their eyes and hear with their ears and
[52:54] understand with their heart
[52:56] and convert and be healed so god lets
[52:59] him know 700 years in
[53:01] he's gonna have to blind them
[53:04] okay next then in jeremiah's day about
[53:07] 200 years
[53:08] after isaiah the lord himself called
[53:13] israel a backsliding israel
[53:16] okay so that's now over halfway through
[53:19] that 1500 year period right
[53:21] that's about 900 years into that 1500
[53:23] year period god
[53:25] literally calls them a backslidden
[53:27] people and that's in
[53:29] jeremiah 3 6. now they had some godly
[53:31] men right like joshua
[53:33] samuel david solomon hezekiah josiah but
[53:36] the majority were evil men
[53:39] that led people into sin children you
[53:42] remember that
[53:43] trivia question which king was known as
[53:45] the one that led israel into sin
[53:50] jeroboam jeremiah i missed it and you
[53:53] guys told it to me
[53:54] it was jeroboam i even read it uh
[53:55] yesterday when i finished uh
[53:57] second kings jeroboam was known as the
[54:00] one who
[54:01] made israel to sin at church we want our
[54:04] testimony
[54:05] to be making people holy praise god
[54:08] we want our children to make help their
[54:10] friends become holy
[54:11] i want my preaching by god's grace to
[54:14] make you holy
[54:15] i don't want to make you sinful or
[54:17] compromise or lukewarm
[54:18] i want to make you holy on fire for
[54:21] jesus christ hallelujah
[54:23] thank the lord i believe it's happening
[54:25] hallelujah thank you jesus
[54:29] so even in israel's disobedience he
[54:32] couldn't they couldn't override god's
[54:34] grace
[54:36] because god's promises
[54:40] all right now 42 generations after
[54:44] abraham god sent his promised son
[54:46] jesus christ and we know in matthew
[54:48] chapter 10 verses 5 through 7
[54:50] jesus tells the disciples don't go to
[54:52] the gentiles
[54:54] who do you say to go to the lost
[54:57] sheep of the house of israel that's
[54:59] right the jews
[55:00] he said go not in the way of the
[55:02] gentiles into any of the samaritans
[55:05] any enter not in their cities go rather
[55:07] to the lost sheep
[55:08] of the house of israel and as you go
[55:10] preach saying the kingdom of heaven is
[55:12] at hand
[55:13] isn't that gracious think about that
[55:15] children god knows he's gonna
[55:17] god knows his own people are gonna
[55:18] reject him but he gives them one more
[55:20] chance
[55:21] one more chance to receive him and have
[55:24] their eyes open
[55:25] and their hearts open and their ears
[55:27] open
[55:29] he gives them one more chance and he
[55:31] doesn't send somebody else to come
[55:33] he comes himself amen
[55:36] before he said abraham and moses and and
[55:39] joshua and solomon and hezekiah josiah
[55:42] nehemiah he says all these men of god
[55:44] but this time he says i'm coming myself
[55:46] praise god i'm going to create a body
[55:49] god in flesh jesus christ the word
[55:52] became flesh
[55:53] and dwelt among us he was sent to his
[55:55] own but his own didn't receive him
[55:57] his own received him not what a
[56:00] beautiful
[56:02] expression of god's love because there
[56:05] is treasure because there is
[56:06] his dearly beloved he comes himself
[56:10] and offers his love to them and even
[56:12] when he turns it down he says father
[56:14] forgive them
[56:15] they know not what they do he spreads
[56:16] his arms
[56:18] open on the cross showing he was he had
[56:20] open arms of love
[56:22] to any that would believe on him and
[56:24] receive him
[56:26] what amazing love
[56:30] remember israel's literal words can you
[56:32] imagine saying these words
[56:33] away with him away with him crucify him
[56:37] we have no king but caesar that's what
[56:40] the churches are saying today away with
[56:41] holiness
[56:42] away with the baptism only goes uh we'd
[56:45] rather we have no
[56:46] uh king but the media right or we have
[56:48] no king but hollywood we have no king
[56:50] but celebrities but our our cry ought to
[56:54] be
[56:54] come lord jesus come lord jesus you're
[56:57] our king
[56:58] make us holy you're the king of kings
[57:00] and lord of lords amen
[57:02] that ought to be our desire we ought to
[57:04] pray at church come lord come come into
[57:06] the service
[57:07] come in my home come in my job come in
[57:09] my life fill my mind fill my thoughts
[57:11] fill my
[57:12] lips with your word calm be closer to me
[57:15] because i want to feel your presence i
[57:17] want to please you i want to be
[57:18] one who receives you in this end time
[57:22] before the gentiles are pruned off or
[57:25] it off
[57:30] now because god gave the if god
[57:33] had to give them what they wanted they
[57:36] wanted unbelief they didn't want to
[57:37] believe they said away with him
[57:39] we don't want him as our prophet so
[57:41] because god has to give them
[57:43] their free more agency he gives them
[57:46] over to
[57:47] unbelief and most of the israelis are
[57:50] blinded
[57:52] to seeing jesus as the messiah
[58:01] so let's look at uh let's look at uh
[58:04] well there's four of them let's just
[58:05] look at one
[58:07] jesus quotes what we read earlier
[58:10] remember in isaiah 6 9-10 we read
[58:12] that prophecy about shut their eyes make
[58:16] their ears heavy lest they see with
[58:18] their
[58:19] their eyes and hear with their ears and
[58:21] understand with their heart
[58:22] and be converted now this is pretty
[58:24] amazing church all four gospels record
[58:28] that scripture and even paul says it in
[58:31] acts 28
[58:33] so this is not just a regular old
[58:35] testament scripture
[58:36] this is a major turning point scripture
[58:39] for the old testament
[58:41] god was going to finally say okay i'm
[58:43] going to give you over to blindness i'm
[58:44] going to give you over to deafness
[58:46] i'm going to give you over to having no
[58:48] sense no understanding
[58:50] because i gave you 1500 years now look
[58:52] at that church
[58:54] the gentiles have had 2 000 years right
[58:57] and look how merciful god is to us
[59:00] israel had 1500
[59:05] okay so let's just read one malachi can
[59:07] you get matthew 13
[59:09] verses 14 and 15. now remember this is
[59:12] in
[59:12] all four gospels plus the book of acts
[59:15] this is a very often quoted scripture
[59:17] this isaiah 6
[59:19] 9-10 about ears but can't hear
[59:22] so malachi it's matthew 13 verses 14 and
[59:25] 15.
[59:30] and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of
[59:33] isaiah which saith
[59:34] by hearing ye shall hear and shall not
[59:36] understand then seeing ye shall see and
[59:38] shall not perceive
[59:39] for this people's heart is waxed gross
[59:41] and their ears are dull appearing
[59:43] and their eyes they have clothes at any
[59:45] time they should see with their eyes
[59:47] and here with their ears and should
[59:48] understand with their heart and should
[59:50] be converted and i should heal them
[59:52] praise god now think about that church
[59:54] that scripture laid there for 800 years
[59:57] we've only been waiting 55 for the
[59:59] rapture right brother and tell us about
[1:00:00] the rapture
[1:00:01] shot voice trump we've been only waiting
[1:00:03] 55 they waited
[1:00:04] 800 years for these scriptures and the
[1:00:08] messiah came
[1:00:09] the government's on his shoulder all the
[1:00:11] but there was also the consequences when
[1:00:12] they would reject him
[1:00:14] but these scriptures waited 800 years
[1:00:16] then jesus
[1:00:17] quotes that scripture and brings it this
[1:00:19] day this scripture is fulfilled oh my
[1:00:21] one of these days
[1:00:23] the scripture of the rapture is going to
[1:00:24] be fulfilled praise god and we want to
[1:00:26] be a part of that
[1:00:27] by god's amazing grace now
[1:00:31] um paul quotes this in acts
[1:00:34] 28 verses 25 to 28 it's rather long
[1:00:39] but let's just read the last verse
[1:00:40] solidity can you read acts 28
[1:00:42] 28 because paul specifically says god is
[1:00:45] going to blind
[1:00:46] israel but then open the eyes of the
[1:00:48] gentiles
[1:00:50] so that's acts 28 28.
[1:00:54] be it known therefore unto you that the
[1:00:56] salvation of god is sent
[1:00:57] to the gentiles and that they will hear
[1:00:59] it
[1:01:01] all right so see salvation of god is
[1:01:03] sent to the gentiles it was first sent
[1:01:06] by jesus during his life to the the jews
[1:01:08] the lost sheep or the house of israel
[1:01:10] but now because god is blind of them he
[1:01:13] goes now and sends salvation
[1:01:15] to the gentiles and they will hear it
[1:01:18] aren't you glad you're one of those that
[1:01:19] heard it praise god
[1:01:20] i've heard the salvation of jesus christ
[1:01:23] and it's changed
[1:01:24] my life it's delivered me from my sins
[1:01:27] my dead and sins condition and it's
[1:01:29] quickened me
[1:01:30] in the power of the holy spirit unto
[1:01:32] life praise god
[1:01:34] amen now there's
[1:01:37] uh four scriptures paul writes in romans
[1:01:40] 11
[1:01:43] that explain israel's blindness
[1:01:46] okay so let's look at those
[1:01:50] so malachi romans 11 that you can go to
[1:01:52] romans 11 2.
[1:01:53] um
[1:01:59] so we can pick up uh numerous things
[1:02:01] here so malachi romans 11
[1:02:03] can you read seven and eight
[1:02:07] what then israel hath not obtained that
[1:02:09] which he seeketh for
[1:02:11] what the election hath obtained and the
[1:02:12] rest were blinded
[1:02:14] the coordinates is written god has given
[1:02:16] them the spirit of slumber
[1:02:17] eyes that they should not see and they
[1:02:19] should not hear unto this day
[1:02:21] thank you lydia can read verses 9 and
[1:02:23] 10.
[1:02:24] and david says that their table be made
[1:02:27] a snare and a trap and a stumbling block
[1:02:29] and a recompense unto them
[1:02:31] that their eyes be dark and that they
[1:02:32] may not see and bow down on their back
[1:02:34] all the way
[1:02:35] amen now we see from these scriptures
[1:02:38] there's an elected group of
[1:02:40] israelites that believe okay they're
[1:02:42] called the remnant group that received
[1:02:44] christ
[1:02:45] and the rest were blinded let me go back
[1:02:48] and look at romans 11
[1:02:50] 25 real quick here malakai can you read
[1:02:52] romans 11 25
[1:02:55] for i would not rather that you should
[1:02:57] be ignorant of this mystery
[1:02:59] unless you should be wise in your own
[1:03:00] conceits that blindness in part
[1:03:02] is happening in israel to the fullness
[1:03:04] of the gentiles we come in
[1:03:05] all right that's right thank you that
[1:03:06] was our opening scripture as well
[1:03:10] yep so the rest are blinded and these
[1:03:12] scriptures are actually quoting paul's
[1:03:14] actually quoting
[1:03:15] isaiah 29 verse 10 and psalm 69 verses
[1:03:19] 22 and 23. i love how paul
[1:03:22] writes the new testament constantly
[1:03:24] quoting the old testament right
[1:03:27] it's like a prophet referring to other
[1:03:29] prophets a genuine prophet
[1:03:30] will always quote previous prophets
[1:03:32] right and believe
[1:03:34] their prophecies praise god so the
[1:03:37] purpose of the blinding of israel was to
[1:03:39] save the gentiles
[1:03:40] we can see it clearly now
[1:03:44] i'm going to read romans 9 31 and 32 and
[1:03:47] 33
[1:03:48] but israel which followed after the law
[1:03:50] of righteousness
[1:03:51] hath not attained to the law of
[1:03:52] righteousness wherefore
[1:03:55] they sought it not by faith but as it
[1:03:57] were by the works of the law
[1:04:00] for they stumbled at that stumbling
[1:04:02] stone as it is written behold
[1:04:04] i lay in zion a stumbling stone
[1:04:07] and rock of offense and whosoever
[1:04:09] believeth on him
[1:04:10] shall not be ashamed praise god
[1:04:13] so the reason they're blinded went
[1:04:15] unbelief because they stumbled at the
[1:04:18] stumbling stone
[1:04:19] they failed to believe in jesus christ
[1:04:22] they failed to step on that stone right
[1:04:25] or to
[1:04:25] to uh to benefit from that stone instead
[1:04:28] they stumbled over it and
[1:04:30] fell they tripped over it rather than
[1:04:33] uh benefiting from the stone
[1:04:38] all right remember the scripture says uh
[1:04:40] literally read romans 11
[1:04:41] 24. uh i i just want to go through this
[1:04:44] so it's clear
[1:04:45] as we approach the main text of this
[1:04:48] chapter romans 11 24 huh
[1:04:53] which is wild foreign nature and were
[1:04:54] grafted contrary to nature to a good old
[1:04:57] tree
[1:04:57] how much more shall these which be the
[1:04:59] natural branches be grafted into their
[1:05:01] own olive trees
[1:05:02] amen so this scripture again proves that
[1:05:04] israel was part of that holy tree
[1:05:07] but they were cut out but they'll be
[1:05:09] grafted back in
[1:05:10] praise god
[1:05:15] okay malakai you read romans 11 27
[1:05:18] this scripture says the merciful god is
[1:05:20] going to remember his covenant
[1:05:22] and eventually take away israel's sins
[1:05:24] we know brother and preached that and we
[1:05:26] know it's part of daniel
[1:05:28] uh chapter nine i believe about
[1:05:30] gabriel's
[1:05:31] six-fold purpose and his visit to daniel
[1:05:35] so how can i go ahead for this is my
[1:05:37] covenant unto them when i should take
[1:05:38] away their sins
[1:05:40] praise god so god is going to keep his
[1:05:42] covenants
[1:05:43] and he will he will take away all
[1:05:46] israel's sins just like he's washed away
[1:05:48] our sins
[1:05:49] through faith in jesus christ
[1:05:52] all right so that's the background we
[1:05:55] made it through
[1:05:56] good i still got about 15 minutes okay
[1:05:58] great
[1:05:59] so we'll get started on this and we'll
[1:06:01] see how far we go
[1:06:04] by the grace of the lord so this is a
[1:06:07] mystery
[1:06:08] so what is the confusion right almost
[1:06:10] every church can recognize that israel
[1:06:12] is blind spiritually because they just
[1:06:14] got to read the verses we just read
[1:06:16] they just got to read romans 11 right
[1:06:18] but what's the
[1:06:19] what's the mystery about it uh the
[1:06:22] mystery centers on this
[1:06:24] can spiritually blinded jews be saved
[1:06:28] or they are they all destined for hell
[1:06:31] right so this this mystery covers
[1:06:35] salvation uh are all blinded jews who've
[1:06:39] lived for the past two thousand years
[1:06:42] uh saved or not is it possible
[1:06:46] for blinded jews to be saved
[1:06:49] can blinded jews living now be saved
[1:06:52] and so here's the revelation that god
[1:06:55] has given to us through his prophet
[1:06:57] the revelation of the mystery of
[1:06:58] israel's spiritual blindness
[1:07:00] is this the covenant keeping god still
[1:07:04] saves
[1:07:04] blinded jews who faithfully follow
[1:07:08] old testament commands promising them
[1:07:11] white robes of eternal life and of
[1:07:14] course we get that revelation
[1:07:16] from the fifth seal where they cry out
[1:07:18] or the jews are under the altar crying
[1:07:20] out for
[1:07:21] vengeance and jesus says wait a little
[1:07:24] while
[1:07:24] until your fellow servants have been
[1:07:26] killed as well
[1:07:28] and then the bible said and white robes
[1:07:30] were given unto them
[1:07:32] at a future time of course we know that
[1:07:34] will be the white throne judgment
[1:07:37] okay so that's the revelation now it
[1:07:40] seems
[1:07:42] on the surface level but do we want a
[1:07:45] surface level understanding the bible
[1:07:46] children
[1:07:47] no we don't want to we want a deep
[1:07:49] revelation in the bible
[1:07:50] it seems on the surface level
[1:07:53] that jesus says i am the way the truth
[1:07:55] and the life and no man comes to the
[1:07:57] father but by me
[1:07:59] and so we we hear a lot of evangelicals
[1:08:01] say no you have to have faith in christ
[1:08:03] to be saved jews are all lost jews are
[1:08:04] all lost
[1:08:06] but they fail to go deeper in the
[1:08:09] scriptures that we're going to get into
[1:08:10] in the next few services
[1:08:12] lord willing as we preach on the
[1:08:15] revelation of israel's blindness and
[1:08:18] it's because of this we've already
[1:08:19] looked at it last spring
[1:08:21] but just to remind ourselves it's
[1:08:23] because of this when god gives a
[1:08:25] covenant
[1:08:26] it stands forever until he ends it
[1:08:29] right you should remember the uh
[1:08:33] noahic covenant the noah covenant
[1:08:36] doesn't that still stand today
[1:08:37] have we had a worldwide flood since
[1:08:39] noah's day no
[1:08:40] because that covenant still stands right
[1:08:44] think of the other covenants there's the
[1:08:46] david covenant now that was conditional
[1:08:49] the eden covenant many uh
[1:08:52] promises still stand from the eden
[1:08:55] covenant
[1:08:56] right with uh men leading their wives
[1:08:59] so headship of the man over the woman
[1:09:01] that's the eden covenant or the adamant
[1:09:03] covenant i'm sorry the
[1:09:04] adamic covenant adam's covered in other
[1:09:06] words
[1:09:09] and so that's the revelation that we get
[1:09:11] when we read the bible so in other words
[1:09:13] a blinded jew
[1:09:14] even though he's rejecting the current
[1:09:16] message of the hour
[1:09:17] the new covenant well god
[1:09:21] knows that he's blind to them they can't
[1:09:23] see it so god lets them
[1:09:25] be received by keeping the previous
[1:09:28] covenant
[1:09:28] they were under since they can't receive
[1:09:31] the current covenant
[1:09:32] god lets them live under the previous
[1:09:34] covenant and if they're faithful to that
[1:09:35] covenant
[1:09:37] then god receives them amen now that's a
[1:09:39] real
[1:09:40] good holy ghost deep understanding of
[1:09:42] god's word praise god
[1:09:44] the only way you get that is by reading
[1:09:45] the scripture and hearing god's prophet
[1:09:47] teach it in the seals
[1:09:48] amen that's the only way our only place
[1:09:51] i heard it
[1:09:53] and the beautiful part was he ends many
[1:09:55] of those sermons with that's
[1:09:56] thus saith the lord praise god so we
[1:09:59] have to worry about
[1:10:00] people you know i get it many times
[1:10:03] people shooting surface level
[1:10:05] scriptures at me saying oh no jews can't
[1:10:07] be saved john 14 6 and all these things
[1:10:10] that doesn't move us because we've gone
[1:10:12] deeper in the scripture
[1:10:14] the holy spirit has taken us deeper in
[1:10:16] the mind of god
[1:10:17] praise god we don't have a surface level
[1:10:19] understanding we have a deep
[1:10:20] understanding of the heart of god and we
[1:10:22] see god keep all of his covenants
[1:10:25] until it's his time to end them but if
[1:10:27] he hasn't entered them
[1:10:28] they're still in effect and people
[1:10:31] benefit we still benefit
[1:10:33] from the adamant covenant right the noah
[1:10:35] noahic
[1:10:36] covenant we still benefit from the
[1:10:38] abrahamic covenant praise god
[1:10:40] we still benefit from all these
[1:10:41] covenants and so jews are still
[1:10:44] benefiting from the mosaic covenant
[1:10:46] hallelujah amen
[1:10:48] thank the lord sometimes i just enjoy
[1:10:50] the word so much i gotta amen what i'm
[1:10:52] saying praise god
[1:10:55] so um now in our last few minutes here
[1:10:58] we've got about 10 minutes by god's
[1:11:00] grace
[1:11:02] in the book i'm showing six biblical
[1:11:05] evidences
[1:11:07] that solidify the fact even blinded jews
[1:11:10] can be saved and i'll list them now
[1:11:13] we'll just get to the first one tonight
[1:11:15] the first proof is jesus's prayer for
[1:11:19] forgiveness for israel on the cross
[1:11:22] that's the first proof jews can still be
[1:11:25] saved
[1:11:27] the second proof is paul's teaching in
[1:11:30] romans 11. the third proof is
[1:11:35] the foreshadowed events of joseph's
[1:11:38] life from the old testament
[1:11:41] okay the third proof is the fifth seal
[1:11:44] i'm sorry the fourth proof
[1:11:46] is the fifth seal the fifth proof
[1:11:49] is god's righteous judgment based upon
[1:11:52] knowledge
[1:11:54] and the sixth proof is god's
[1:11:56] unconditional covet
[1:11:57] covenant with israel through abraham you
[1:12:00] guys remember that
[1:12:01] that covenant is unconditional right
[1:12:05] as far as god is going to keep that
[1:12:06] unconditionally anyone who does their
[1:12:09] part of the covenant
[1:12:10] god will receive him because it's
[1:12:11] unconditional right there wasn't going
[1:12:13] to be an ending time
[1:12:15] during human history praise god
[1:12:19] so let's get our bibles to let's just go
[1:12:20] through this section here and then we'll
[1:12:22] be done tonight by god's grace
[1:12:24] while hanging on the cross and dying
[1:12:27] after being beaten worse than
[1:12:28] any man could ever be beaten in the past
[1:12:32] present or future jesus utters these
[1:12:35] beautiful words lydia can you read
[1:12:36] luke 23 34 some of the most
[1:12:40] beautiful words uh recorded in scripture
[1:12:46] luke 23 34.
[1:12:51] then said jesus father forgive them for
[1:12:53] they know not what they do
[1:12:55] and they parted his arraignment and cast
[1:12:57] lots amen
[1:12:59] this reminds me of that song this is
[1:13:01] amazing grace
[1:13:02] praise god amazing this is amazing
[1:13:06] unmerited favor although his own people
[1:13:09] according to the flesh
[1:13:11] called for the blood of their own
[1:13:13] messiah
[1:13:14] he breathed mercy on many of them
[1:13:18] instead of judgment okay and so
[1:13:21] see see how jesus says he says there
[1:13:24] have to be some blinded because they
[1:13:26] don't
[1:13:26] know what they're doing right now some
[1:13:29] of them did right we know judas knew
[1:13:31] what he was doing right children
[1:13:33] because the bible said he was the son of
[1:13:34] perdition so he was going to go to
[1:13:36] destruction
[1:13:37] his soul was going to be is eventually
[1:13:38] going to be destroyed
[1:13:40] so when jesus said father forgive them
[1:13:42] he meant the ones that were blinded to
[1:13:44] it
[1:13:46] didn't mean the ones that were
[1:13:47] purposeful doing it and the ones that
[1:13:49] are going to have to answer
[1:13:51] because they purposely were killing the
[1:13:53] messiah
[1:13:55] but this is amazing grace to the group
[1:13:57] that was blinded there
[1:13:59] that didn't know they were crucifying
[1:14:02] the messiah
[1:14:04] so see jesus words reveal why some blind
[1:14:07] jews from his time period
[1:14:09] could still be saved they didn't know
[1:14:11] what they were doing
[1:14:13] how many of you would hold it against
[1:14:14] somebody if they didn't know what they
[1:14:15] were doing
[1:14:16] you wouldn't hold it against them
[1:14:20] it might hurt you right you might be
[1:14:21] disappointed you might be sad
[1:14:23] but if they didn't know then you
[1:14:26] wouldn't hold it against them
[1:14:28] so the principle is spiritually blinded
[1:14:30] jews
[1:14:31] cannot fully understand the consequences
[1:14:33] of accepting
[1:14:34] i'm sorry i'm rejecting christ just like
[1:14:37] a natural man
[1:14:38] innocently trips over an object in his
[1:14:41] path
[1:14:43] uh so so the same thing happened to
[1:14:45] blinded jews
[1:14:47] they unintentionally stumbled over the
[1:14:49] stumbling stone they stumbled over
[1:14:51] jesus's life right they didn't
[1:14:52] understand it
[1:14:53] they didn't understand his actions they
[1:14:54] didn't understand his miracles they
[1:14:56] didn't understand his words
[1:14:57] but praise god we understand that praise
[1:14:59] god we understand his life
[1:15:02] his actions his words we understand the
[1:15:04] gospel it's good news to us tonight
[1:15:07] is it not it's such glorious good news
[1:15:09] for us tonight
[1:15:11] but there was a group at the cross not
[1:15:13] everybody but there was a group at the
[1:15:15] cross and of course that didn't even
[1:15:17] attend the crucifixion
[1:15:18] that were blinded to it they didn't know
[1:15:21] what was happening
[1:15:22] they didn't know it was the messiah
[1:15:23] dying
[1:15:25] okay and this is true because of jesus
[1:15:28] christ's
[1:15:29] own words and notice he offers them what
[1:15:31] forgiveness
[1:15:33] blinded groups that don't know what
[1:15:34] they're doing god can offer them
[1:15:36] forgiveness and mercy
[1:15:41] now let's look at the other side the the
[1:15:43] sad part there was a group in malachi
[1:15:45] turn to psalm 69 if you could
[1:15:47] there was a group at the cross that knew
[1:15:50] he was the messiah right because
[1:15:51] remember nicodemus come up and said
[1:15:53] master we know we know you're a master
[1:15:55] in israel
[1:15:56] and no man could do these things except
[1:15:58] god was with you
[1:16:00] so many of those sanhedrin leaders
[1:16:02] imagine caiaphas and other ones
[1:16:04] they knew he was the messiah
[1:16:08] and like judas is scared he sold out the
[1:16:10] son of god
[1:16:12] uh a holy man so he knew what he was
[1:16:15] doing he'd seen the miracles for three
[1:16:16] and a half years judas knew what he was
[1:16:18] doing
[1:16:19] so malachi can you read psalms
[1:16:23] 69
[1:16:24] [Music]
[1:16:26] and let me look up the exact scripture
[1:16:29] there's i
[1:16:29] i list eight in the book but i don't
[1:16:32] want to read all those for time's sake
[1:16:33] here tonight
[1:16:36] so i'm 69 it's 20 through 28
[1:16:43] but they're just such a beautiful
[1:16:45] portion here
[1:16:47] 20 to 28. well you know
[1:16:51] why don't you why why do we split it
[1:16:52] malcolm you're not uh so malakai read 20
[1:16:54] through 24.
[1:16:57] reproach has broken my heart and i'm
[1:16:59] full of heaviness
[1:17:00] and i looked for some to take pity but
[1:17:02] there was none for comforters but i
[1:17:03] found them
[1:17:04] they gave me also a goal for my me and
[1:17:06] in my thirst they gave me vinegar to
[1:17:08] drink
[1:17:09] let their table become a snare before
[1:17:10] them and that would should have been for
[1:17:12] their welfare they'd become a trap
[1:17:15] but their eyes be darkened that they see
[1:17:16] not and make their wounds continually to
[1:17:18] shake
[1:17:19] far out that indignation upon them
[1:17:21] unless they wrathful anger take hold of
[1:17:23] them
[1:17:24] okay so here we see the suffering
[1:17:26] servant jesus christ
[1:17:29] his heart was broken remember brother
[1:17:31] ram said he died of a broken heart
[1:17:32] look what it says reproach hath broken
[1:17:35] my heart
[1:17:37] his own people reproaching him
[1:17:40] railing at him accusing him mocking him
[1:17:44] he was full of heaviness i imagine
[1:17:45] that's probably like a
[1:17:48] important greek word i can't look that
[1:17:50] one up on here
[1:17:52] now you ever thought of that he looked
[1:17:53] for pity but nobody had pity on him
[1:17:56] when something bad happens don't you
[1:17:57] want somebody to feel sorry for you
[1:17:59] oh go get somebody some ice they hurt
[1:18:01] themselves right have pity on them
[1:18:03] nobody had pity on jesus
[1:18:07] he said i found no one to give me pity
[1:18:11] they offered him gall for meat
[1:18:15] they gave him vinegar to drink which
[1:18:17] would make it worse
[1:18:20] so the judgment is put on them in verses
[1:18:22] 22 23
[1:18:23] 24 25 let their habitation be desolate
[1:18:26] none dwell in their tents for they
[1:18:29] persecute him whom not a smitten
[1:18:32] and they talk to the grief of those whom
[1:18:34] thou has
[1:18:35] wounded now look at verse 27
[1:18:39] add iniquity unto their iniquity so see
[1:18:42] they knew what they were doing
[1:18:43] iniquities when you know
[1:18:44] you purpose you already know it's right
[1:18:46] i'm sorry you already know it's wrong
[1:18:48] and you do it anyway so add iniquity
[1:18:51] onto their iniquity
[1:18:53] and let them not come into thy
[1:18:55] righteousness
[1:18:57] so there were some that were going to be
[1:18:59] totally blotted out and we'll get to it
[1:19:01] right here verse 27
[1:19:03] let them be blotted out of the book
[1:19:06] of the living and not written with the
[1:19:10] righteous
[1:19:11] so see church that gives us the idea
[1:19:13] there's multiple books right there's a
[1:19:15] book of
[1:19:15] people that are living currently and
[1:19:18] when they die
[1:19:20] their name must be removed from that
[1:19:22] book
[1:19:23] but then there's a group that's written
[1:19:24] with the righteous
[1:19:27] so see there was people that because
[1:19:29] they crucified christ because they said
[1:19:31] away with him away with him
[1:19:32] their names were removed off the book of
[1:19:34] life
[1:19:36] because they turn down the author of
[1:19:38] life
[1:19:43] all right so that's a
[1:19:46] scripture hopefully that's new to some
[1:19:48] of you maybe you haven't found that one
[1:19:49] before was that new to you children have
[1:19:50] you
[1:19:51] kind of knew or had you read that one
[1:19:53] before okay
[1:19:55] i thought that'd be a blessing i i
[1:19:57] hadn't read that one for a long long
[1:19:58] time
[1:19:59] that was a beautiful scripture to see
[1:20:00] that there were some there
[1:20:02] that were they were saying crucify him
[1:20:04] crucified and they didn't know what they
[1:20:05] were doing
[1:20:06] but there was some there that were
[1:20:07] saying crucify him crucify away with him
[1:20:09] and they knew what they were doing
[1:20:11] god said i'll forgive the one that
[1:20:12] doesn't know but we're going to add
[1:20:14] iniquity
[1:20:16] to the ones that did know and their
[1:20:18] names will be removed from the book of
[1:20:20] life
[1:20:24] that's amazing that's quite astonishing
[1:20:25] and only god is the one right
[1:20:27] god lets the angels know i remember her
[1:20:28] brother ben rod say that
[1:20:30] the angels will come and sever the
[1:20:32] righteous away from the wicked
[1:20:34] or vice verse of the wicked away from
[1:20:35] the righteous
[1:20:37] only god and the angels truly know
[1:20:46] so see there were some in the multitude
[1:20:48] that were just ignorantly caught up
[1:20:51] in the moment and they joined the mob
[1:20:53] maybe unintentionally
[1:20:55] for this group jesus prayed for mercy
[1:21:00] jesus wouldn't pray for their
[1:21:01] forgiveness in vain right would jesus
[1:21:02] pray a
[1:21:03] vain prayer is god going to turn down
[1:21:06] the prayer of jesus christ
[1:21:07] absolutely not that's his son that's his
[1:21:10] holy son
[1:21:11] so jesus's prayer cannot be denied
[1:21:14] anyone that says jews can't be saved
[1:21:17] doesn't know the scripture
[1:21:19] jesus christ prayed forgive them that
[1:21:22] don't know
[1:21:23] they're missing out on salvation they
[1:21:25] don't know they're crucifying the lamb
[1:21:28] that's why i believe more and more that
[1:21:30] people can be saved
[1:21:32] on the day of judgment and not even
[1:21:34] realize
[1:21:35] because right here they didn't even
[1:21:37] realize what they were doing
[1:21:39] and yet jesus prayed father forgive them
[1:21:42] when they don't know what they're doing
[1:21:45] see god definitely heard jesus prayer
[1:21:49] he'll pardon the blind of jews who
[1:21:51] didn't know what they were doing
[1:21:53] when they turned their backs on their
[1:21:55] own savior
[1:21:56] god's forgiveness is so great he pardons
[1:21:59] jesus
[1:21:59] own disciples who desert him in his
[1:22:02] greatest
[1:22:04] hour of trial what do you want to be
[1:22:06] there
[1:22:07] to help your friend or your brother or
[1:22:09] your sister in their
[1:22:10] worst moment what did you want to be
[1:22:12] there
[1:22:14] well jesus even jesus didn't have
[1:22:15] anybody in his hardest moment
[1:22:17] no one to pick him up no one to help him
[1:22:20] yet he says father forgive them
[1:22:27] we know of course though john and the
[1:22:29] few women were present at the cross
[1:22:31] but none could save him none could save
[1:22:34] him
[1:22:37] now that doesn't show god's love i don't
[1:22:40] know what it does
[1:22:43] god is so merciful even when some get
[1:22:44] caught up in it they get caught up in
[1:22:46] crucifying
[1:22:47] and condemning the son of god jesus
[1:22:50] still says i'll forgive those that
[1:22:52] didn't know what they were doing
[1:22:54] but i'm not going to forgive those that
[1:22:56] knew what they're doing
[1:22:57] so malachi if you'll come
[1:23:12] praise god hallelujah thank you jesus
[1:23:23] thank god for his amazing love let's see
[1:23:25] him there
[1:23:26] oh love of god how rich and pure
