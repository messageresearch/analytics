[0:03] God, we just feel unworthy
[0:05] and to look upon this
[0:09] audience today and see this [music]
[0:11] birthday cake playing here.
[0:15] I'm sorry, Father. You forgive me. I
[0:17] [music]
[0:18] just can't talk. But I pray, God, that
[0:21] somehow somehow that this stream of
[0:24] divine love will
[0:27] help everyone. bless these people who
[0:29] has done this great thing. Father,
[0:33] &gt;&gt; thanks a million.
[0:36] &gt;&gt; Greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:38] of the Lord [music] Jesus Christ. The
[0:40] purpose of this video is to answer a
[0:41] viewer's question about birthday [music]
[0:43] cakes and birthday parties. I was asked
[0:46] if it's wrong to have a birthday party
[0:49] or give someone a birthday cake. [music]
[0:51] I think the answer is no. It's okay.
[0:54] It's fine to have a birthday party and
[0:56] to give someone a birthday cake as long
[0:58] as it's done humbly and not too
[1:01] extravagant because we want to be
[1:03] careful not to go overboard. We don't
[1:05] want to make anyone an idol and we
[1:07] certainly don't want to cause anybody to
[1:09] stumble and we'll talk about that here
[1:10] in the video by the grace of God. One
[1:13] brief story. When I first started
[1:15] pastoring, someone asked me about having
[1:18] birthday parties and so forth. And and I
[1:20] think this individual was against
[1:21] birthday parties, but I said just
[1:23] humbly, "What's wrong with taking one
[1:25] day out of the year or maybe two if you
[1:27] give Christmas gifts? What's wrong with
[1:29] taking one or two days out of the year
[1:30] just to show someone you love them, you
[1:32] appreciate them, and you're so thankful
[1:34] God has placed them in your life?" And
[1:37] that's why I held a few birthday parties
[1:39] for my children. But as I got older, I
[1:41] stopped holding birthday parties because
[1:42] I started having multiple children, many
[1:44] children, and it would be too many
[1:46] parties. But again, that's the
[1:47] conviction that was on my heart. What's
[1:49] wrong with having a party and just
[1:51] celebrating someone you love, care for,
[1:54] appreciate? None of us are guaranteed
[1:56] tomorrow. So, I don't believe with a
[1:59] humble, sincere Christian heart that
[2:01] it's wrong to give someone a birthday
[2:03] cake or have a party for them as long as
[2:06] it's done in humility and with a sincere
[2:08] heart by God's grace. Let's start with
[2:10] some scriptures here. I wrote down some
[2:12] scriptures by the grace of God. Titus
[2:15] 1:15 says, "Unto the pure all things are
[2:17] pure, but to unto them that are defiled
[2:20] and unbelieving is nothing pure, but
[2:23] even their mind and conscience is
[2:24] defiled." So, if you have a pure heart,
[2:27] there's nothing wrong with having a
[2:28] birthday party or getting a birthday
[2:30] cake. You just want to make sure that
[2:31] your mind is pure. Your mind has no
[2:34] defilement. Your intentions are pure by
[2:37] God's grace. Second, we want to avoid
[2:40] legalism and not let your good things be
[2:43] spoken evil of. Paul talks about this in
[2:45] Romans 14, 16, and 17. Let not then your
[2:48] good be evil spoken of. For the kingdom
[2:50] of God is not meat and drink, but
[2:52] righteousness and peace and joy in the
[2:54] Holy Ghost. So, if you held a birthday
[2:56] party for someone and you just wanted to
[3:00] express joy for their life and you're
[3:02] just thankful for their life, there
[3:04] would certainly be nothing wrong with
[3:05] that by the grace of God. As you'll see,
[3:06] brother Brand was given birthday
[3:08] presents. Brother Brand was given
[3:09] birthday cakes and he always said,
[3:10] "Thank you and God bless you." Third, we
[3:13] don't want to cause anyone to stumble
[3:16] even in the liberty of having birthday
[3:18] parties and birthday cakes. In other
[3:19] words, we don't want to make them too
[3:20] extravagant. Romans 14:13, "Let us not
[3:23] therefore judge one another anymore, but
[3:25] judge this rather that no man put a
[3:27] stumbling block or an occasion to fall
[3:29] in his brother's way." So, I imagine
[3:31] it's possible if people overdid a
[3:33] birthday party, it might cause other
[3:34] people to stumble, maybe with
[3:35] extravagant gifts or worldly music or
[3:39] sinful birthday cards or something. I'm
[3:41] just trying to think of different things
[3:43] that the Lord wouldn't be pleased with,
[3:45] worldly things, carnal things. And then
[3:47] 1 Corinthians 8:12-13 says, "But when ye
[3:50] so sin against the brethren and wound
[3:52] their weak conscience, ye sin against
[3:53] Christ. Wherefore, if meat make my
[3:56] brother to offend, I will eat no flesh
[3:58] while the world standeth, lest I make my
[3:59] brother to offend." I just always love
[4:01] this verse. Paul said with Christian
[4:03] liberties, "I'm not going to do anything
[4:05] that would cause a brother or sister to
[4:07] be offended as long as the world is
[4:08] standing." And that's quite a statement
[4:10] to make. In other words, Paul was
[4:11] willing to go to any lengths to keep
[4:12] someone from stumbling in their
[4:15] Christian walk. a weaker Christian. And
[4:18] so if you have a birthday party or get a
[4:20] birthday cake, you want to make sure
[4:21] it's humble. You don't want to cause
[4:22] anybody to stumble. Again, with
[4:25] extravagant gifts, excessive amounts of
[4:28] money being spent, excessive praise
[4:30] being given to the person. We're
[4:32] supposed to give honor and then double
[4:34] honor to those who labor in the word of
[4:36] God. But we shouldn't praise them. We
[4:37] shouldn't worship them. Every Holy
[4:39] Ghostfilled Christian knows what I'm
[4:41] talking about by God's grace. And then
[4:43] fourth, again, a warning verse is that
[4:45] Herod in Matthew 14:6 had a birthday and
[4:47] it was kept. And so, a lot of people
[4:49] will point to this verse and say, "Well,
[4:51] that's why we shouldn't have birthday
[4:52] parties." But what about the pure
[4:54] people? What about those who were
[4:56] thankful for Brother Bram's life and
[4:58] gave him birthday cakes, as we'll see in
[5:00] just a moment here. So, again, it's we
[5:02] should take it as a warning to keep
[5:04] celebration simple, spiritual, sincere,
[5:06] and reverent by the grace of Almighty
[5:09] God. And then fifth, be impartial with
[5:11] birthdays. He's not. And now I found as
[5:13] a pastor and then as a father of nine
[5:15] children, this is quite a challenge. You
[5:18] got to make sure you do the same amount
[5:19] of celebrating for each child and then
[5:22] for each member in the church by the
[5:24] grace of God. The Bible talks about in
[5:26] James 3:17 that we not to have
[5:29] partiality. The wisdom of God is pure,
[5:32] peaceable, gentle, easy being treated,
[5:33] full of mercy and good fruits without
[5:35] partiality and without hypocrisy. So we
[5:38] want to make sure we treat everyone the
[5:40] same by the grace of God. We know the
[5:41] body of Christ is spoken of in 1
[5:43] Corinthians 12 and we should have the
[5:45] same care one body member for another.
[5:48] So now let's look at some quotes here by
[5:49] God's grace. There's two quotes about
[5:50] birthday cakes that I could find. It
[5:52] seems like brother Random got a birthday
[5:53] cake when he turned 47 in 1956 and when
[5:56] he turned 55 in 1964. But before I
[5:59] forget, um I made a video last year
[6:01] about how brother Brandon reacted to
[6:03] Christmas gifts receiving them and he
[6:04] always said thank you and God blessed
[6:06] you. He wished he could get everybody a
[6:08] gift in return but he couldn't afford
[6:09] it. So I'll leave a link to that video
[6:11] in the description. I think that'd be
[6:13] helpful. You see brother Brandham
[6:14] receiving gifts and he just appreciated
[6:17] the people and wanted God to bless them.
[6:19] So the first quote is from what is a
[6:21] vision April 8th am 1956. I used the
[6:25] details from this quote to make the AI
[6:28] generated thumbnail of brother Ram
[6:30] praying at a pulpit and somewhere around
[6:32] the pulpit was a birthday cake because
[6:34] brother Ram says a birthday cake is
[6:36] laying here.
[6:38] So, brother Ram says, "Shall we pray?"
[6:40] This is the beginning of the sermon to
[6:42] look upon this audience today and see
[6:43] this birthday cake laying here. I'm
[6:46] sorry, Father, you forgive me. I just
[6:48] can't talk. But I pray, God, that
[6:49] somehow somehow that this stream of
[6:51] divine love will help everyone.
[6:53] Bless these people who has done this
[6:55] great thing, Father. And I just ask that
[6:56] your blessings will be with us so great
[6:58] today until the whole building will be
[7:00] flooded with your glory. So, if I'm not
[7:03] mistaken, it seems like brother Ram is
[7:04] calling this birthday cake a great
[7:05] thing. And again, he's turning 47 years
[7:08] old here in Chicago. So, here's the
[7:10] first quote that I found about birthday
[7:12] cakes, and it was a positive thing. He
[7:13] was humbled. Sounds like he's almost
[7:16] crying. He was so overwhelmed by the
[7:18] love of the people. Let's listen to the
[7:19] quote.
[7:21] &gt;&gt; Thank you very much.
[7:22] &gt;&gt; Shall we pray?
[7:23] &gt;&gt; Our heavenly father, we thank you for
[7:25] all your goodness to us.
[7:28] God, we just feel unworthy.
[7:31] [clears throat] And to look upon this
[7:35] audience today and see this birthday
[7:38] cake laying here,
[7:41] I'm sorry, Father, you forgive me. I
[7:44] just can't talk. But I pray, God, that
[7:47] somehow somehow that this stream of
[7:50] divine love will
[7:53] help everyone. Bless these people who
[7:55] has done this great thing, Father. And I
[7:58] just ask that your blessings will be
[8:00] with us so great today until the whole
[8:03] building will be flooded with your glory
[8:05] and and think at the very time looking
[8:09] at that deaf and dumb people passing by
[8:12] going to the other side.
[8:14] Oh, I pray God somehow do something in a
[8:18] great way for us today. We ask that in
[8:20] Jesus name. Amen.
[8:24] Next, in 1964, a trial, April 5th, he
[8:28] wanted to thank a lady and her husband
[8:29] who baked me a birthday cake and give it
[8:31] to me. Many of you has given me cards
[8:33] and things. Thank you very much. God
[8:35] bless you. And I like this. He said, "I
[8:37] hope you have we all spend an eternal
[8:39] birthday over yonder
[8:42] where we'll sit down. I want a 10,000
[8:45] years with each one of you. Just sit
[8:46] down and talk." Now, I thank you for all
[8:48] that you've done. Beautiful quote here.
[8:50] Let's listen to the quote
[8:51] &gt;&gt; before I forget it. Uh, my son told me a
[8:54] while ago some little lady and her
[8:56] husband from Arkansas baked me a
[8:58] birthday cake and give it to me. Many of
[9:00] you is giving me cards and things I
[9:01] haven't even had time to get into yet.
[9:03] Thank you very much. God bless you and I
[9:06] hope you have a we all spend an eternal
[9:08] birthday over where we'll sit down and I
[9:11] want to I want a 10,000 years with each
[9:14] one of you just sit down and talk and we
[9:16] won't have any less time to talk than we
[9:18] did when we began. That's the truth.
[9:20] Now, I thank you for all that you've
[9:23] done.
[9:24] &gt;&gt; And here's three more quotes about
[9:25] birthdays in general. In 1956, April 7th
[9:30] there in Chicago, Brother M kind of
[9:32] makes a joke and talks about how he was
[9:35] getting birthday presents and he was
[9:36] hoping some of the birthday presents
[9:38] would be song specials such as German
[9:40] boy singing and then brother Ekberg
[9:43] singing Down from His Glory. He said
[9:45] that's his favorite hymn. Let's listen
[9:46] to the quote. The little German boys, I
[9:49] don't guess they're here tonight. They
[9:51] sang it this morning and it would just
[9:53] say, "I'm getting really birthday
[9:55] presents to hear brother Eckberg s down
[9:57] from his glory." That would be
[9:59] marvelous. And the reason I like that,
[10:02] it just expresses in the way I I love
[10:04] him. All right, how many loves that
[10:06] song? Let's see your hand.
[10:08] &gt;&gt; Just remember that's my favorite hymn.
[10:11] All Brother Ed.
[10:14] &gt;&gt; Second quote is again from Chicago,
[10:15] April 8th, 1956. What is a vision? The
[10:19] ram said, "A little girl, a little
[10:21] envelope in there and it was her tiths
[10:23] of about 8 cents, I think it was. She
[10:25] sent it to me for a birthday present.
[10:27] Her tithings." He said, "Oh God, richly
[10:30] repay you, my dear brothers and
[10:31] sisters." Let's listen to the quote.
[10:34] &gt;&gt; There's only one thing I can say, and
[10:36] this is not exactly what it says. Say
[10:39] with a prayer, God bless you. And if I
[10:44] never be able and God never lets me do
[10:48] it in this life to to show my
[10:50] appreciations for all these gifts from
[10:53] everyone. Even a little girl had a a
[10:56] little envelope in there and it was her
[11:00] tithings of about 8 cents I think it
[11:03] was. She sent it to me for a birthday
[11:05] present for her tithe. From that to
[11:08] these great presents here. Oh, God.
[11:12] Richly repay you, my dear brothers and
[11:15] sisters. I just I didn't think you
[11:18] really thought that much, haven't I?
[11:21] I do appreciate it.
[11:23] &gt;&gt; And the final quote is from the time is
[11:25] at hand. Again, 1956, April 8th. He
[11:28] said, "I was just thinking a few moments
[11:30] ago, I wish I could put on a list of
[11:31] names of all who had gave me a birthday
[11:34] present why I'd have a sheet of paper
[11:36] like that." And imagine he's talking
[11:37] about a large sheet of paper. And I just
[11:39] want to say this and surely you
[11:41] understand what I mean. Heartily God
[11:42] bless every one of you. Let's listen to
[11:45] the quote.
[11:45] &gt;&gt; I was thinking just a few moments ago, I
[11:48] wished I could uh put down a list of
[11:51] names of all who had gave me a birthday
[11:54] present and why I'd have a sheet of
[11:57] paper like that. And I just want to say
[12:00] this and surely you you understand what
[12:02] I mean. A heartily God bless every one
[12:05] of you. And I was undoing one of the
[12:08] little packages a while ago and a little
[12:11] pair of rompers fell out for my little
[12:13] Joseph and
[12:17] I
[12:18] oh I I just something in my heart. Did
[12:22] you ever get to a place where you
[12:23] couldn't express what you wanted? See
[12:26] and the only thing you know to do is
[12:27] just say God bless you. That's all I can
[12:30] say. Thanks a million.
[12:32] In closing, friends, I hope this video
[12:35] was a blessing by the grace of God.
[12:36] Again, it's awesome to see how Brother M
[12:37] reacted to receiving Christmas gifts or
[12:40] receiving birthday gifts and presents. I
[12:42] hope it was helpful to you by the grace
[12:43] of God. Here in Leodysia, you know, it's
[12:46] 2025, almost 2026. We just got to be
[12:48] careful not to go overboard on birthdays
[12:50] and birthday gifts, birthday cakes and
[12:52] so forth. We just want the Holy Spirit
[12:54] to remind us to be humble, to stay
[12:56] humble, stay sincere, keep ourselves
[12:59] little, do not lift people up too
[13:01] highly. Do not get overextravagant. If
[13:04] we give gifts, if we have parties, do it
[13:07] by the leading of the Lord, by the grace
[13:08] of Almighty God, keeping all these
[13:11] attributes that we read about in the
[13:12] scripture. Purity, considering others
[13:15] feelings so we don't cause them to
[13:17] stumble, being impartial. As the Bible
[13:20] said, may God help us to redeem the time
[13:22] because the days are evil. It's okay to
[13:24] spend a little bit of time thanking
[13:26] people, honoring them, being grateful
[13:28] that God has given you, family members,
[13:30] friends, maybe church members,
[13:33] and one day by God's grace, we'll all
[13:35] have that eternal birthday together. And
[13:37] that's all possible by the blood of
[13:39] Jesus Christ through faith in the Lord
[13:41] Jesus Christ. If you have any [music]
[13:43] questions, concerns, or testimonies
[13:44] about this video, please contact me.
[13:48] God bless you and may [music] Jesus
[13:49] Christ be the desire of your heart.
[13:54] &gt;&gt; Very happy to be here this afternoon and
[13:56] again in defense of the gospel of Jesus
[13:58] Christ to bring the good tidings, the
[14:01] good news that Jesus raised from the
[14:03] dead, living among man today, his
[14:05] church. [music]
[14:06] The same Jesus that was yesterday will
[14:09] be today and forever. He has never
[14:12] [music] failed.
