God bless you as you're being seated praise God okay now I got uh a lot of notes and uh we'll just try to go here as as good as we can by God's grace um so brother R when he preaches it if you want a full kind of lesson on it these are the of course these are the scriptures brother RAM used there's a lot of them in there uh 2 Peter 3 brother man deals with that he reads the whole chapter uh when he starts the sermon that's why it's three and a half hours amen which is great it's just a phenomenal sermon uh if you haven't listened to it you need to do it by God's grace make time for it Hallelujah um brother R said this was an important blessed subject uh brother random said I very important subject it's a very blessful one and I'm going to skip down here he says uh where they're going to live so this is about where we're going to live but remember this is is not the Millennium this is after the Millennium okay I preached on the Millennium a few weeks ago uh when we were here well by now it must have been a month ago by now so sorry I'm not really good on time I'm awful exaggerating I'm awful I'm awful at remembering details my wife has to tell me after service Jesse you said that wrong I'm like oh that's right sorry hun thank you sweetie I've always got to make it right because I just can't remember all the details as long as I can remember that Jesus Loves Me amen that's the most important by God's grace and brother r remember he just preached the highlights but man said I suppose if I would take my time it would take me weeks to preach this he says I wrote down some scriptures some notes just to hit the highlights to where it'll let you study so this is a job Church you got to go study this too I have I I preached this in 2016 and I just studied or listen to it again today eight years later and it sounds like a brand new sermon so you need to listen to it if you haven't by God's grace you'll be so blessed brother brandham uh this this sermon so impacted brother brandham he would think about it for weeks at a time have ever had that where you've been in a service and you just you can't forget about it it was just like wow that time was awesome wow that was awesome that's how I'm feeling about those Iowa Services amen right just wow God moved and God brought God did so much that's what this sermon did to brother brandham two weeks later he was still talking about it uh he said last week I'm sorry last Sunday a week ago I spoke on the subject the future home I'm going to skip down down here I've been feasting on that ever since knowing that when this life is over I'm going to that City I'm Bound for that City and nothing else matters hallelujah amen church when you love Jesus Christ you really know nothing else matters other than pleasing Jesus Christ Hallelujah you want to do your best uh to please the Lord Jesus Christ we're not saved by works but the Bible says when you get saved then you want to be zealous for good works then because of your love brother said because of your appreciation you want to show oh God how much you appreciate he saved you by doing something for him hallelujah oh I love it but R said by the way he said I got so many letters on the future home that sure hit home somewhere there's a lot of them it did me too I've never gotten over it so two weeks afterwards he's like wow I never got over that sermon may God give you a sermon where you can't get over it I'll say like this you can't get over it but it gets inside of you amen may God give you a sermon that gets inside of you Hallelujah what am I what am I talking about the Holy Spirit getting inside of you and it so impacts you you can't get away from it praise God Amen so then brother B begins teaching on this subject and brother R pulls from The Book of Revelation 21 he says John tells about the new Earth but Peter explains how it comes about okay so John brother man said re basically Revelation 21 uh doesn't explain how we get the new city but Peter explains how we get it all right because John just said I saw a new Heavens A New Earth the first Heaven the first Earth passed away there was no more see that's what we read I'm going to skip down here but we turn back to the second Peter now to find out Peter explains how this process will come about okay so in second Peter chapter 3 Peter describes three different conditions of the world what the world was in like in the past what the world's like now and what the world will be like in the future and I have all the verses up here I don't you know I don't have time to have you guys read your your Bibles tonight usually I do but I don't have time for that tonight just have to bear with me by God's grace 2 Peter 35 and 6 for this they willingly are ignorant of that by the word of God the heavens were of old and the Earth standing out of the water and in the water whereby the world that then was being overflow with water perished so this is speaking of the flood of Noah remember Before the Flood there was water inside the Earth and there was water above the Earth remember that that's where the rain came from there was a layer of ice or some type of water out you know above the atmospheres of the Earth but God brought that down and the Bible said the Springs broke open so Peter says this is the process the earth goes through the Earth had to go through a flood first all right that's how the world was but now but the heavens and the Earth which are now by the same word are kept in store reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and predition of Godly men so in the same chapter Peter talks about how the world was how the world is now and then he's going to talk about how the world will be in the future verse 13 nevertheless we according to his promise look for a new heavens and a new Earth wherein dwelleth righteousness how many are looking for that new world I'm looking for a new world where there's no more transn where there's no more homosexuality hallelujah amen that's the world I'm looking for where there's no more murders amen am that's the world I'm looking for and that's what Peter says that's what we're looking for Hallelujah a world where righteousness dwells there Hallelujah and Jesus will be the king of that world hallelujah amen now we know he rules the spiritual Kingdom now but he allows Satan to have rule the Bible calls it in 2 Corinthians chapter 4 the Bible calls Satan the God of this world so because because Satan deceived Eve and then Adam gave into sin they gave up their rights they they gave up their dominion over the Earth and now Satan has a sort of dominion over the Earth as long as God allows it how many know that remember the remember remember the story of Job Satan can only do what God allows how many remember that so whenever there's something evil God allowed it but remember God promised I'll make all things work together for good to them that love the Lord to them that are the called according to the purpose of almighty God hallelujah now brother Ram says uh yeah brother I'm just going to skip down here brother Ram says the old world that stood out the water that was before the flood Genesis 1:1 and now the world that is now present and then again he refers to another one the world that is to come the new world three worlds three stages of the world now I mentioned this when I preached on uh the three works of Grace last time I mentioned this the Earth is redeemed in three stages just like you okay so let's say the stages if you know what's the first stage justif ation that means god declares you righteous right you're forgiven what's the second stage sanctification that means to purify and set apart and what's the third stage the baptism of the Holy Ghost or the new birth or the filling of the Holy Ghost those are the three stages that God redeems a man or woman by praise God and brother brother R said brother R tells us from the Bible God does the same thing to the Earth God has to take the Earth through three stages of redemption just like the our bodies that come from the Earth Glory now brother Ram gets a lot of these teachings uh at least eight I counted eight brother Adam gets eight teachings from Clarence Lin Clarence Lin was a Baptist pastor in the late 1800s early 1900s he was a tremendous artist he was a real scholar of the Bible but he didn't have everything right okay um and brother Ram gets at least eight of his details from Lin to preach this but then God gave brother brandom this thought about three stages Clarence l didn't teach that Clarence Lin didn't realize uh the the water of Noah the blood of Jesus's cross and the fire to burn the outside of the earth represented justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm going to get real deep and rich in the word of God here tonight so brother man said you better put on your anointing jacket everybody put on your anointing jacket you're G have to do that by God's grace brother R said if you want to catch the anointing Hallelujah no it's just it's a funny joke by God's grace he says now notice God makes plain to us his Plan of Redemption oh this just thrilled my soul brother R says when I saw it how he makes plain to us here now his Plan of Redemption he says what God has done to redeem his world he's done the same plan to redeem his people for the unchangeable god changes not in any of his plans or anything Hallelujah okay so God is unchanging whatever God does he have to continue you doing praise God hallelujah he says how he led us to himself to a Tabernacle in Us by three stages of Grace and he's just led the world in three stages to come to the world as God will come to the world after it's gone through the three different stages of purification that's exactly how he comes to us through three stages of Grace I've taught that at the beginning I've never changed since it's God's word okay so we know we know we have to be Justified then we have to be Sanctified then we have to get the baptism of the Holy Ghost we know that most churches don't know that most churches just say say a sinner's prayer and now you're saved and now you're filled with the Holy Ghost that's wrong that's only one step you have to go through three steps to be saved Jesus said I'm the way the truth and the life hallelujah amen hallelujah we'll get to all these examples he said notice how God makes it plain if that wasn't a great confirmation a loving blessing in from God when I see this and see that sense a boy first time Christ ever dealt with me I've still always taught those three stages of Grace that's why I preach the three works of Grace I think I was led by the Holy Spirit to do it because uh you have to know that in order to understand this all the way all right now that's from my old website uh but there's three three Works to redeem the Earth justification right the water in Noah's flood represents that sanctification the blood pour out at the side of of Jesus side uh when he crucified was crucified and then the baptism of the Holy Ghost the fire to cleanse the Earth after Armageddon okay so just like God Saves you with justification sanctification baptism Holy Ghost God redeems the Earth through the flood of Noah the blood that Jesus shed when they pierced him that was blood that was sanctification blood cleanses right there's no forgiveness without shed blood the Bible says that amen and then God's going to send fire on the earth just like he sent fire in your soul hallelujah amen that's why on the day of Pentecost they had fire above them Hallelujah because God had fully redeemed their being hallelujah oh my that's beautiful so there's three Works to redeem the Earth just like there's three uh steps God redeems a man or woman now remember Ezekiel for told this I'm sorry that's a picture Ezekiel Ezekiel 36 says God's going to give you a new heart a new spirit and my spirit amen okay and I just got to go fast through these Israel possessed the promised land they first left Egypt through the waters of the Red Sea see again water like the Noah's flood see the water they they were proved and tried in the wilderness for 40 years and then they passed over Jordan into their permanent dwelling right they they'd arrived right they they were they they crossed Jordan and now they're sealed into the land amen hallelujah even the life of Abraham has three stages he was called out of uh Chala out of er he was CAU out of that and that was represented when he got saved in Genesis 12 and then from Genesis 13- 16 that's the time he got Sanctified and then Genesis 17 he got a token or he got a a permanent Mark right in his loins he had a circumcision and that was a permanent Mark just like when a person's saved they're permanently saved they're permanently sealed until the day of their Redemption praise God it's a type that was a type of what happens to us in the New Testament all right a baby boy like I told you last time or a baby girl I've seen it eight times my wife has had eight babies I've seen it it's like this every time amen the water breaks and then there's blood and then the spirit comes water blood spirit Hallelujah now my wife said it's not bloody show all the time so just put blood there okay my wife does a good job helping me like I told you last time see and that and so many things have three stages to Perfection man is perfected in three stages there's do you know there's three types of bodies there's a terrestrial body that's a flesh body there's a Celestial body that's a like an Angelic body and then there's a glorified body which is a combination of both of them this one eats this one doesn't this one eats Hallelujah that's the difference between this one and that one this is a spirit and a flesh body combined and it can eat and drink water hallelujah amen there's three kinds of bodies the earth goes through three stages for Perfection the flood of Noah Jesus's blood and the fire that Peter talks about fervent heat a baby again is born in three steps water blood spirit the bride the Bride of Jesus Christ was restored through three three Messengers Martin Luther John Wesley William brandham hallelujah praise God Amen three steps uh these are my oh yeah yeah the gifts faith hope and charity there's three right that that perfects the gifts faith hope and charity the greatest of these is what charity all right you're a good Bible reading Church there good job good job Hallelujah brother love you brother Howard the godhead is perfect in three manifestations father son Holy Ghost not three persons three manifestations the Bible calls them manifestations and a plant we saw this brother irin and brother John know this for sure a a wheat gra wheat goes through three stages the stock the tassel then the grain there's three stages Jesus said that in Mark 4: 28 all right and these are all that's all repetition so I'm just trying to skip past that I'm going to go fast I don't know why I repeated that that was my fault now I'm going to skip past this uh because I think you're pretty uh pretty good on this here I'm going to skip down that's slide number 31 now I'm watching my slides here so I can go to the right one now what I'm SK skipping is that the new Earth is not the Millennium but I've been over that with you and I'm going to skip down to slide looks like 55 yeah I want you to see this here in these slides brother Ram says uh in this slide brother Ram says the new Heaven and new earth is not going to be like a brand new Earth God has to create a brand new Earth that's not what it means it means God's going to burn all the sin on the outside he's going to leave the framework of the earth and then then he's going to cause a brand new uh you know a brand new vegetation and all the all the all the trees and and that's all going to grow again brand new but he's keeping the same Earth okay so brother says see the old world framework was not destroyed by the water of Noah's time the world was only washed off that got its baptism it was baptized you know the Earth got baptized so did I so did you amen hallelujah you ought to be because God's got to redeem the the the the the man the same way he redeems the Earth praise God because that's where our bodies come from our bodies come from the earth so will the framework remain though it be burnt by fire it doesn't destroy the Earth sea it just destroys the sin that's on the earth okay so this is some picture right you got your inner core of the Earth outer core inner mantle I do teach science but I don't teach this okay this this is beyond me but I'm just showing you you got your you know outer crust and everything like that but the Bible said you know right now sin is present on the outside side right but then that that represents fire see that orange and now there's just a fire that's what God's going to do there in second Peter 3 he's going to send a fervent heat he's just going to burn the outside he's not going to burn the inside the inside's already burning Hallelujah just like you amen the inside's already burning hallelujah how many hearts are burning for Jesus tonight see the inside's already burning he's just got to clean the outside off he's got to get all the sin on the outside Hallelujah because it's already on fire on the inside thank God Amen that we're burning on the inside Hallelujah Glory see and now the sin is cleansed once he burns the outside the sin is cleansed and now the framework remains right all these parts inner outer inner mantle outer mantle All That Remains but now we can start a brand new Earth with the outside of the Earth all right now I'm going to have to skip some of these uh by God's grace oh yeah I love this quote brother man say he quotes Peter Peter says the Earth shall pass away and melt the elements with ferv heat see doesn't mean that the Earth the planet's going to pass away but the world Cosmos how many happy the politics are going to pass away the sinners now we don't want to see them lost but they got to make their choice the system how you looking forward the sin being burned up everybody should have said Amen on that how you looking forward to disease being burned up germs everything that's wrong will pass away Hallelujah that's why God's got to send a a spiritual fire some type of spiritual natural fire and burn all the sin and the politics and the uh the debauchery the lasciviousness he's got to burn it all up so he can start again Hallelujah and he can put the Earth in the right condition the way it was at the beginning hallelujah amen now let me check my my notes here yeah brother said he's going to burn up but not the planet just the works of men all their politicians their schemes their denominations aren't you glad the denominations are going to get burned up I'm talking about the buildings and the systems and their Creed books and their bylaws we want the people to be saved we're not against the people we're against the Antichrist system we're against their Antichrist doctrines Hallelujah because our only Doctrine is the word of God hallelujah that's right yeah remember the Bible says see the Earth also and the works that there shall be burned up so God's going to destroy all the outside of the Earth the struggling nature he's also going to burn up all the evil works as well they'll all be burnt up praise God for that Hallelujah now I'm going to skip ahead here because again I can't cover all this uh just got to listen to the sermon oh yeah I like this one so brother yeah the Bible says there's going to remember Peter said there's going to be a great noise do I have that verse up here I don't have the verse but the Bible said the the the fervent heat will explode with a loud noise and brother Braham Likens that to when you get the Holy Ghost you make noise amen he said you know when a man receives a baptism of fire there's a lot of noise around there they think that's a shame to hear people scream and shout like that just wait till this Earth gets her baptism of fire amen see when you get the Holy Ghost something brother man say some the Bible says something has to happen you can see it and hear it Hallelujah I know I made a lot of noise when I got the Holy Ghost amen I seen other people they make a lot of noise when they get the Holy Ghost Hallelujah there there'll be some type of noise Hallelujah because that's what's going to happen there's an explosion and fervent heat that's what happens in your soul when you get born again Hallelujah Glory now this is the word brother Ram uses the Earth gets renovated but not annihilated Annihilation is to totally destroy right God's not going to annihilate the Earth to make a new Earth he's just going to renovate the outer crust of it okay and just burn the outside is everybody clear on that these are the main points he said just like you're renovated when God does the three works on you God doesn't annihilate you he renovates you and the church said I love what brother said Hallelujah he says it won't be annihilated and then he says this he says uh like he did us his creation to live in before he come in it he had to give us the baptism of fire then the Holy Ghost can come in and live the baptism of Fire Hallelujah remember the Bible said blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth see church if you just live a a Meek humble what does meek mean it means humble it means putting God above you if you just put God above you God is going to let you inherit a portion of this Earth and I mean in its best condition hallelujah amen in a perfect sinless condition if you can just live a Meek humble life you if you can just say Jesus I want to follow your leading all the days of my life God will bless bless you and you'll get to inherit this Earth it's okay if you don't have much now but God promises he'll give you much later hallelujah amen all right all right now I'm going to skip uh here let me look at my notes okay now we went over this earlier but the new Earth is not the Millennium okay I got to skip uh here the new Earth is different from the Millennium the Millennium is not the end of it there will still be time after the Millennium the Millennium is a space of time but not the new Earth I'm trying to get to my uh I want to give you a visual yeah here's a visual okay all right now everybody see this this is the time of Adam 6,000 years ago okay here's where we are right now okay 2,000 years after Christ 2024 so brother Ram says God has given us six 6,000 years of History each each thousand year is like uh is like one day with God right A Thousand Years is as a day with God Peter says that okay and so brother R explains if you if you pay attention to the Bible you'll see the Bible give you clues about how God is going to finish the Earth and bring in a New Jerusalem okay so here's there's day one so day one was you know from Adam until a thousand years after Adam day two is from the the next thousand year and then there's a flood there's a flood after about two thousand years after Adam okay then there was another Thousand Years another thousand years and then there's calvary or the blood of Jesus Christ so there's a second step right water blood see but we haven't had the fire yet Hallelujah but the fire's coming okay and so that that was this is a thousand years after Christ was crucified and the next one is where we are that's also called the seven Church ages okay is that pretty familiar by God's grace it's just a different way look at human history this is just human history on a timeline and how God is going to redeem the Earth the same way he redeems man all right next is coming a fire I believe it's right after Armageddon because the Bible said in the Millennium we walk upon the ashes of the wicked think of that will walk on the ashes of the wicked all those that blasphemed Jesus Christ all those that wouldn't repent of their idolatries and their fornications and their uh their wickedness God burns them up and then we walk on the ashes of the wicked so see God's going to put let me say it like this God's going to put all enemies under your feet every hear me on that one I'm going say it again that was good amen any enemy you're struggling with I'm talking about demonic powers or anything any bad habits God's going to put all enemies under your feet praise God and he proves it in the Millennium because you walk upon you walk upon the ashes of of all the Sinners right the ashes on any government building you're going to walk on the ashes of it Hallelujah God's going to put you above all these systems of man Hallelujah because you were Meek and the meek inherit the earth Hallelujah so when Amazon's all gone you'll still be here is that right Church Glory hallelujah amen when Walmart's all gone you'll still be here you'll walk on the ashes of Walmart and Amazon Hallelujah not pridefully like I'm you know I'm walking like I got some strength and some energy you know but but you but the Bible say see those are those all those companies support you know homosexuality all these things God's got to burn it he's got to clean it off Hallelujah he's got to start all over again and bring it back to righteousness Hallelujah if you live a righteous life you'll walk upon the ashes of the wicked the Bible says so there's the fire the Earth will go through that fire after Armageddon and then that's the Millennium there's a Thousand-Year Millennium everybody see that it's hard to see it's Millennium I preached on that a month ago I got the recording if you want to hear it so the Millennium is like the seventh day or the seventh group of a Thousand-Year Peri periods okay everybody see that remember brother R said the Rapture here is like the wedding ceremony then we go to the wedding supper in heaven and then the Millennium is our honeymoon amen hallelujah oh if you never got a good good honeymoon over here you're going to get the best honeymoon Hallelujah you get a thousand year honeymoon with Jesus amen hallelujah and then after the Millennium brother Braham said the next after that 7,000 years the next next set of thousand breaks into eternity and it's like the eighth day it's like the the week starts over right after seven days you start over you start the week over and brother man said that's like a cycle of Eternity it's like you're just going to break back into a cycle of Eternity the time's going to end you're going to break into eternity he calls it the Eighth Day Hallelujah you get the new heavens of the new Earth the new Earth of Jerusalem is like the eighth day it's after the 7,000 years now you step into the future home and now it's the Eighth Day the week is over amen the seven days are over now you step into the next week but this week has no time hallelujah amen and you see the Earth moved up there and then this is what we're talking about now now that's your home that's your Eternal home come down to earth and that's where you live Hallelujah everybody see that by God's grace all right I see a lot of smiles out there that's making me happy Hallelujah and if I see frowns you talk to me after Serv I'll apologize if I said something wrong okay if I said something wrong you correct me after service I'm I'm open to correction but you better make sure you're right right you want to correct me that's fine but you better make sure you got scripture to do it Hallelujah okay now there we go now so the new Earth is not the Millennium okay now this is a good chart too this is what brother Ram explains in the sermon he said every 2,000 years God does something major after the first 2,000 years Noah's flood the second 2,000 years the blood of Jesus Christ this last 2,000 years brother R's Ministry came as a prophet Ministry brother R spoke with thus sayith the Lord I have six examples where brother said thus sayi the Lord and He predicted the future and it came to pass another brother has 10 examples where brother said thus say the Lord you're going to be healed and the people come back later and they got healed that's 16 times who do you know who's prophesied 16 times and it came to pass nobody none because none of them had a gift of a prophet but we've received a prophetic gift Hallelujah and how do I know because he pointed me back to the Bible Hallelujah not only did he have a gift of Prophecy not only did he do that but he pointed me back to the true teachings of the Bible He restored our faith back to the faith of St Paul St Peter St John St James we have the original Faith Church hallelujah amen hallelujah Glory that's the seven Church ages all right that's in Revelation chap 2 and 3 all right now I'm going to skip past this now I I showed this last time hone you remember that anybody remember this this is how these are just three simple ways how the Millennium is different from the New Jerusalem this is what I'm preaching on tonight and I'm already 30 minutes in I don't know how this time goes so fast now the Millennium it's a thousand years Sinners are still cursed in the Millennium right they'll uh the Bible said they'll they'll argue and fuss and you've got to come man and you've got to solve all the problems and you will because you have a perfect body you have a perfect body that means you never get tired Hallelujah you have a perfect mind that means you'll never get confused that's what the Bible says you'll Reign you'll Reign Over cities you'll Reign Over Nations now the more sacrifice the more the larger territory you'll Reign Over Jesus says hallelujah but see Sinners get a curse and the Bible said if they won't come up to Jerusalem to worship Jesus will say no more rain on you and their all their crops will die because they won't come up in worship hallelujah amen it's a curse Jesus will put curses on these nations if they won't come up and worship at Jerusalem that's during the Thousand-Year Millennium but the Bible said Revelation 22:3 there's no more curse in the future home Hallelujah there's no more curse in the New Jerusalem praise God because all the sin has been done away with every person's been judged Jesus has separated the Sheep he saves the Sheep but the goats get cast in the Lake of Fire alive during the Millennium Nations get deceived right Satan goes out after the thousand years he goes to the Four Corners one 2 3 4 and he draws all these people the numbers of sand of the sea and he brings them up against Jerusalem but then God Saves us God sends fire isn't that awesome fire saves us hallelujah fire lives in our soul and then fire saves us amen hallelujah God is always using this fire Hallelujah to be with us but see they can be deceived but in revelation 22 the the nations are healed remember the Bible said that the the leaves will be for the healing of the Nations brother raham said a king let's say a king of uh let's say a king of Africa a king of Africa will take a leave Leaf off and brother said he'll hand that to a king of a neighboring country because that's what the dove did when God healed the Earth the dove remember the dove found a leaf and brought it back to Noah and that leaf represented the healing of a Nation Hallelujah Glory Hallelujah praise God amen the dove handed the the leaf back showing God is going to heal the Earth and so in the future home the Nations imagine whoever's in charge of the United States maybe it be some of us by God's grace you will give that healing there to the uh maybe the the the nation of Mexico right let's heal our relations now there's going to be no more sin now there's going to be perfect peace by the grace of God healing so the Nations get healed in the future home but during the Millennium some of them are deceived all right and the last thing uh nations are killed so death is in this time period Nations I think that's the wrong word uh I think I meant people are killed huh let me check that out Revelation 20:9 if you have your Bible you can go to that one but like I said I'm going to try to go fast because I got a long way to go okay Revelation 20:9 and they oh okay okay and they went up on the bread of the earth Encompass the camp of the Saints about and the Beloved City and fire came down out of heaven and devoured them okay yes so these are the Nations repres that are talked about in the previous verse Revelation 20:8 yes and shall go out to deceive the Nations okay yes so when God sends fire down at goag and Magog yes the nations are burnt up right there so there's death in this time period but friends there's no more death in the future home Jesus Takes death hell and throws them in the Lake of Fire do you know that death and hell are demons right the angel the death angel remember Egypt right Moses in Egypt Jesus Takes death and hell and he cast him in the Lake of Fire now there's no more death Hallelujah Glory okay so that's how you know the difference can everybody say Amen all right good got it all right now I'm going to skip ahead here let me look at my notes Here I want to go to slide after that um let's go to slide 108 I'm I want to show you I want to show you the pictures too let's see okay I already did that one I really want you to see the pictures I think it'll help you friends as we speak right now uh Jesus Christ is preparing that pyramid City for us right now now it's amazing there's Jesus does so much in heaven do you ever think of this this this blew me away Jesus has to prepare he said I go to prepare your place right that's the next next Slide John 14 let not your heart be troubled but believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions that means an abode or dwelling if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you aren't you glad Jesus is thinking about you I mean I know I know I know he's putting up billions of mansions but one of those is mine so when he makes that one it's just how I like it he's thinking about me brother that means a lot that Jesus thought about me to make me a home praise God and he thought about you isn't that beautiful if he's building a house for you he's got to think about you he knows you he's Eternal Hallelujah he's God he knows everything about you he knows the very number of the hairs on your head if you still have hair on your head Hallelujah for our dear brothers thank God I still got mine by God's gra but you never know what's going to happen Hallelujah so we see it we see that Jesus is going to prepare us a mansion now again I gota watch my time maybe I can finish this uh this is an interesting point you might want to know the New Jerusalem that City that comes down is not heaven right it's actually heaven uniting with Earth some people think oh when we when I die I'm just going to heaven I'll be in heaven forever no you'll be there for a while but after everything everybody's judged Heaven comes down to earth Heaven and Earth unite like a husband and wife hallelujah amen that's what that's what the Bible said that City comes down as a bride adorned for her what husband so the Earth is the husband and the city is the wife the city is the uh is heaven it's the it's the home of Jesus and the husband and wife come together a perfect union Hallelujah amen so brother man makes this point see I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband brother said remember it's not heaven John said I saw it coming down out of Heaven it's to be on the earth see not this Earth is going to pass away it's a redeemed Earth God didn't say he was going to raise up a new generation he's going to redeem the one that's here he he ain't going to raise up a new generation he redeems the one that's already here he ain't going to make a new world it's the one right here hallelujah so see the Throne of God comes down to earth Heaven's Throne comes down to Earth and Heaven and Earth unite praise God there's a song that we somebody sang it was really good uh the song says uh I'll be gone when the tribulation comes I'll be gone but then the next verse is but I'm coming back when the tribulation is over I'm coming back Hallelujah and that's how it is whoever dies here or if we go in the Rapture we'll be going gone from the earth for a little while but friends we're coming back and we'll send spend eternity on this Earth by God's grace Hallelujah I'll be gone but I'm coming back by God's grace Hallelujah all right now yeah I'm going to skip past this here yeah I want to kind of close with that one that's 123 okay now there's a lot of good things in here I'm just going to read a few by God's grace uh the Throne of Heaven comes down to earth and then the city will be just like the bride likes yeah let me just go this I I think I'll show you this it's just I like to show you some visuals the new Earth the Throne of Heaven comes down to earth brother manam said now notice how we go after the world's fire baptism all germs is gone makes it a fit place then for heaven to dwell here on Earth so Heaven's Throne comes down to earth Heaven and Earth unite okay I'm GNA skip past that so there's my Earth there's my there's my common animation that's as good of a animation as I can do okay all right and there's a more beautiful picture of it you know you got the I just love that view now remember there's no sea but there there looks like there could be lakes in the future home because like my daughter was saying how could God not have any whales in in in there like God made this beautiful whale you know there's got to be some whales there right God's not going to say I'm done with whales no more whales we want to see whales amen I like to go swimming with some whales amen and not have to worry about drowning or anything like that or swallow like Jonah praise God you see so there's got to be something there now there there's there's so much my so the the New Jerusalem coming down where we're going to live is just like when the Dove came down on Jesus you'll appreciate that but it's it's a it's a it's a foreshadowing it's the Dove came down Heaven and Earth United there it is amen the dove from Heaven United with the Earth the body of Jesus Christ see that it's it's and just when you got the Holy Ghost the same thing Hallelujah glory amen Heaven and Earth United Hallelujah so it's a good it's a good foreshadow all right now I want to show you some pictures here now brother R says the measurement of the city is uh each side is 1,500 miles wide okay so Revelation 21:15 the city's Four Square so it's like a square at the base okay it's uh 7even 12,000 furong the length and breadth and height of it are equal so 12,000 furlongs equals 1,500 miles okay so brother R went and he measured it out on a map okay there there's the calculation from Good Old I'm sorry from Bad old Google not good old Google bad old Google so if you put 12,000 fur longs it equals 1,500 miles okay so brother mam said he went measured it on a map and so here's the size of the city for us it reaches from Maine all the way down to Florida that's just one side and there's three gates on this side 1 2 3 one two 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 where people can come where the kings of the Earth can come back into the city Hallelujah that's a pretty big city Hallelujah but that's the home of Jesus's bride he said I go prepare a place for you that where I am you shall be also amen who you long yes you're longing to see some of your loved ones in heaven no doubt about it but who do we long to see most the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah he said I'm going to go prepare a place for you that where I am you shall be also all right now that's unnecessary I don't have to do that now here's the location so that that's about the same size right of where it would be and I just slid that over there there's my there's that's all the animation I can do in my life okay so that's exactly where it's going to sit that that's just to give you an idea of the size of it but that's how big the future home is going to be on the entire on the earth when it comes it's going to be that large okay now you're going to like some of these here too let me skip ahead here yes brother man says the city must be a pyramid you'd be surprised most people think this city is going to be a cube but brother man proves it can't be a cube anybody know why okay we'll see brother bam said he he said there's another geographical measure that the dimensions are the same that is a pyramid four square and all the walls were the same he said let me draw it okay then he draws it okay so most people think the future home's this but it can't be that it has to be this for one very important reason ah I see our sister smiling there amen she probably knows what it is amen now have you got that City see it's a Holy Mountain it's a mountain who's ever seen a cube mountain now come on I have never seen a cube Mountain I've flown across the different continents I've never seen a cube Mountain it's always like a pyramid shape and the church said the Bible calls it a Holy Mountain the city is not a cube it's a mountain I'm going skip ahead it's just a great Mountain like a pyramid and the city's on the mountain Glory see here's the key here's how you know the throne could not be seen if the walls are straight up and down like a cube right so it has to be a pyramid Hallelujah ever catch that if it's a cube and you're you know down here at the base you you're not going to see Jesus but the Bible said everyone will see Jesus Hallelujah you won't need the sun because the light of Jesus will be shining on all of us hallelujah Glory sister Rachel amen hallelujah God bless you Sister Melinda God bless you Amen brother brother Noah God bless you isn't this beautiful amen the revelation of God where the Bible has to make sense it has to all fit together and church the Holy Ghost fit it together amen the Holy Ghost rightly divides the word of truth if the walls were straight up and down the city could only be seen from the outside or from the inside the throne can only be seen from the inside if it's a cube in other words if you're on the earth you can't even see the Throne of God where's Jesus where's the throne you can't see if it's a cube so it has to be a pyramid Hallelujah so that wherever you are to some degree you can see Jesus hallelujah amen and brother Bram says the Pyramid of Giza right now in Egypt is a witness of this pyramid even its location is a witness right and brother man tells us he believes Enoch built it I believe that too it had to been a Believer and the reason is because the Capstone is not on the pyramid how many you know that there's no Capstone it's missing a headstone it's not complete this bride is missing Jesus the bride's not complete but she's going to be complete Hallelujah she's complete when Jesus comes back Hallelujah Oh Glory so see there's Giza right there's the Pyramid of Giza and there's Israel so see just the very witness that close to Israel there's a pyramid that no man I'm sorry that uh that men can't build today I watch a I I watched a uh a video one time China tried to build one and they tried to build the Pyramid of Giza in their country and they couldn't do it on a grand scale so they just did a very small one as smart as they are and even as smart as American scientists are Americans uh at least learned from that they they learn not even to try don't even try to build it because you can't it was built by some Supernatural Powers it was built by the word of God hallelujah Enoch or whoever it was I believe it's Enoch he he was a prophet somehow he tapped into some powers of God and built that Pyramid of Giza Hallelujah now they think they got some ideas well that somebody else bu Egypt build it well then build another one they're not going to because they can't hallelujah amen okay so there there's what it looks like in real life look how small these people are but there's no Capstone on it because it was a sign that the Capstone is coming Jesus Christ is coming back Amen to cap off the church okay that's where it'll be the missing Capstone on Enoch's pyramid types Christ The Headstone who's coming to this world to cap the Bride of Jesus Christ at the Rapture all right let me check my progress here I want to show you the picture so you got it and brother oh yeah brother said even the whole world witnesses to it right even your dollar bill witnesses to it everything Witnesses brother man said every time you write your a check and you put 2024 you're witnessing of Jesus's life because it's 2024 in the year of Our Lord glory amen every dollar you spend every time you write a check everything you do you can't escape Jesus Christ Hallelujah so if you can't escape him get him inside your heart praise God Amen Hallelujah he's all around us he he the Bible said he's not far from each one of us if we just reach out and try to feel after him that's in Acts chapter 17 all right now let's read this uh where's my verse yes okay so here's here's what I want to show you next now these are just some mountains right there in Israel okay this this is my very childlike animations okay I'm I'm not a computer specialist I wish I was but I'm not well maybe I don't wish I was um but this is what's going to happen the Bible said let me go back the Bible said the Earth is going to raise up like that in order to receive the future home it needs a flat that's what the Bible says I'm going to show it to you and then that City holy city can come down and rest on it that's what the Bible says hallelujah God has to raise up a platform right you you construction workers and know that you got to have a flat flat PL platform right you have to have a firm foundation Hallelujah Jesus Christ is our foundation Hallelujah see the new city is a mountain on top of a mountain oh yeah here's where brother says it Isaiah 2:2 it shall come to pass in the last days that the mountain of the Lord in the mountain of the Lord's house shall be established in the top of the mountains and shall be exalted above the hills and All Nations shall flow into it Hallelujah all right now let me find the other verse yes here it is yeah there's Isaiah 2 1 through3 teaches this all right so the mountain is established in the top of the mountains Hallelujah all right oh yeah and here's why it also has to be here's why it also has to be a pyramid because the city had no need of the sun think about that as powerful as the sun is this city that we live in it won't need the sun because the glory of God lightens it and the lamb is the light thereof all right now brother man talks about other mountains Mount Si Mount Transfiguration okay so now here's my here's my picture right now that's Jesus on the throne you can't see because I don't have a very good quality uh picture there but that's Jesus on his throne right and so as Jesus sits there it has to be a pyramid because see the light has to go out that represents light it's a triangle but it's it just represents light if it's a cube you you couldn't see the light of Jesus you still need the sun if it was a cube right Glory you see it brother it has to be a pyramid amen just like Giza it represents Giza represents the future home see people live in here if it was a cube and you live right here you would need the sun because there' just be a shadow all the time right but it has to be a pyramid that way the light can shine down on you hallelujah amen we walk in the light such a beautiful light Hallelujah comes where the due doops of Mercy are bright and see he's Shin light I me he just shines light in every direction by God's grace okay just my yeah those are my those are my elementary animations there okay yeah that's a picture there's Jesus he's at the top of the pyramid right and he's giving out light now it's just the best picture I got right does it just to gives you an idea all right you've been a good audience now I want to um move ahead now now the Bible says there's a wall how many know there's a wall around the city remember that from Revelation 21 it has 12 found founds and in them are the names of the TW Apostles of the Lamb think about that God honors them so much why did God honor them remember he told Peter because you left fathers mothers children houses and lands for my name's sake see missionaries that leave their families and things their family suffers so God rewards them and he put He even put their name inside the foundations Hallelujah and the wall that's around this had 12 foundations and they were the same stones that were on Aaron's breastplate so here's the 12 type of stones Jasper Sapphire I can't even pronounce some of these Emerald sardonic sardus chrysolite Barrel topaz chry of praus jacin I can't even say him amethyst so I don't I don't I don't know my gems as you know I I don't know very good but these are the same stones that the high priest wore on the Yurman thumin and he was go into the Hol of holies right each Stone represented a tribe and God uses those same stones to build the foundation of his of your home I'm going start calling it your home Hallelujah so see now this is no particular order but right you have Thomas Matthew Bartholomew philli John James Andrew Peter Simon the Canaanite James and thus because I I didn't have enough colors I didn't have enough they ran out of colors here so they ran out of stones but see their names are going to be in there Hallelujah because what did they do they they started the gospel the Gospel of Jesus Christ Hallelujah the kingdom of God hallelujah so God puts their name in The Stone amen that should sound familiar Revelation said you're going to get a stone with your name in it Hallelujah now this is not drawn to scale but here's here's a city and remember there's three gates on each side and the gates are pearly gates Hallelujah let's see do I have any animation on this one no okay now no animation on that one but that's kind of what it looked like from the side now even would be even even more wonderful of course way wonderful than this but just gives you an idea all these nations will flow into the City and the Bible said they're going to bring their Glory and Honor into it by the grace of God okay now I'm going to uh the height of the wall is 144 cubits and again I used uh Google to calculate that it's 19 it's basically 20 stories high so if you find a 20 story building this is a some building in Virginia it's 20 stories high that's how tall the wall is and all these people don't want a wall around our nation God puts a wall around your home Hallelujah and the church said God believes in walls amen the Bible said these walls are salvation deliverance and the gates Our Praise hallelujah amen but this and and this wall is 1,500 miles long hallelujah it's has 12 foundations of those 12 types of stones and each each each Stone has a name of a disciple in it by God's grace that's how it's all so next time you see a 20 20 story building that's how tall our our wall of our city of our home is going to be God puts a very strong wall around his brother Pride Hallelujah now the 12 gates are pearly gates I just love this I want to share this one uh and and in the in the gates are the names of the 12 tribes of Israel okay and every several gate was of one Pearl so the gates are made of one Pearl each gate is a pearl now here and so and then here here's the 12 names Simeon Ruben Gad Manasseh Joseph Benjamin Asher II napali isachar Judah and zebul those represent the gates of pearl that each gate has a name of one of the 12 tribes of Israel one of the 12 sons of Israel right but here's the beautiful part now Asher Judah Levi Benjamin now look there's there's a gate and the gates made a pearl a't that amazing why would God have the Pearl right there at the gate to go into his City well it's very simple I believe because Jesus said he is the pearl of of great price amen remember the remember the parable man had many pearls but then he saw the one Pearl he went and sold out all of his pearls to get the great pearl of great price amen that's what that's what you did you might have had good things in your life there was probably some good things in your previous church right there mind Holiness that's for sure amen hallelujah there's some good things I had some good things in Pentecost I mean people got healed of cancer that was good but they cut their hair wore makeup and you know all kinds of evil things there were some good things we had some pearls oh but when we saw the Pearl the Lord Jesus Christ the true interpretation of the Bible the baptism of the Holy Ghost when we saw the pearl of GRA price we sold everything out so we could have that Pearl in other words in other words each one of us had to come into the into Jesus Christ through Jesus Christ because he's the door he's the gate Hallelujah and he's so valuable he's like a great Pearl hallelujah amen I wish I could say it if I can't say it right May the Holy Ghost show you what I'm talking about okay I'm not smart enough to give the right words but I think you understand what I'm saying Jesus Christ is the gate Jesus Christ is the door and he's so valuable he's like the great pearl of great price you gave up everything for Jesus Christ or you should if you haven't Hallelujah and then there there will be a witness of that in the future home every person that walks in has to come by the pearl of great price recognize Jesus Christ is the way the truth and the life he is the door hallelujah oh my glory to God Amen see after preaching like this I have a hard time sleeping ton night you know cuz I got all the adrenaline pumping anybody ever experienced that before I wish I could fall asleep I got all this adrenaline going I gotta wait till the adrenal when's this adrenaline going to wear off it's already 12 o00 Hallelujah brother said brother R said I bought the pearl of great price I accepted Jesus Christ as my savior hallelujah praise God Amen Jesus Christ is our pearl of great price and then every person that walks into his city has to recognize he's the Pearl great price Hallelujah Lord he says I am the door okay now I'm I'm at uh I'm at an hour so give me maybe about 15 more minutes Hallelujah if you were a sinner if I was a sinner I used to watch a movie for two hours and I had no problem doing that well surely I can listen to a sermon for two hours and the church said I could waste two hours watching a football game or basketball game it felt like that tonight it feels like it's going like this Hallelujah which is good Hallelujah feels like it's going fast tonight Hallelujah so the New Jerusalem yes yes oh yeah beautiful okay the New Jerusalem will be where the current Jerusalem is right now the Bible tells us that okay let let's look look at Zechariah 14:4 and his feet shall stand in that day upon the Mount of Olives that's right next to um Mount Zion and uh what's the other one where the Temple of the mount is there in Jerusalem can never think of that uh what's the name of that mountain right next to Mount Zion I can't think of it now forgive me Lord he says but okay so you have Mount Zion then you have another Mountain that's where the Dome of the Rock is then you have a valley then you have Mount olives right next to it he says which is before Jerusalem on the East and the Mount of Olives shall cleave in the midst thereof toward the East and toward the west okay so that's what I showed you uh where that ground raises up right has to raise up and there should should be a very great valley and half of the mountain yeah half okay yeah half of the mountain shall remov toward the North and the other half towards the South so so a mountain can rise up I didn't have that on my animation but that's look that's what the Bible says half the mountain has to go to the north half South right and then a mountain can raise up to be on the mountain okay and that's where it is that and that's about the that's about the size of it too right there's Jerusalem that's where the very center Jesus will stand above the Center of Jerusalem right at the Throne of that pyramid City Hallelujah the very center of it Hallelujah right where he died amen hallel right where he died Hallelujah right where he was crucified Hallelujah he'll stand right there that's his holy city Hallelujah now I love this I just want to share this this will bless you Saints here this will bless you but said are you ready this is the city Abraham was looking for remember the Bible said Abraham was looking for a city whose Builder maker was God oh I love this amen wow 4,000 years ago Abraham was looking for the city that we are going to live in Hallelujah that's right he says see being a prophet he know that city was somewhere the Bible said so he forsook the city he lived in ER of chalis and he went over look where he went exactly where it'll be that's where Abraham went right that's where he met mezc amen Abraham met mezc in Salem Salem means people and that's where Jerusalem is now so he met mezic in Jerusalem mzc became Jesus Christ hallelujah amen and now Abraham seed meets Jesus Christ hallelujah oh my glory he was looking for a city whose Builder and maker was God being a prophet that's what the Bible said remember Abraham Hebrews 11:10 for he looked for a city which hath foundations whose Builder and maker is God isn't that amazing 4,000 years ago brother Irvin he was like I know there's going to be a city some here there's got to be a city somewhere right around here in Jerusalem there's going to be a city Hallelujah I'm looking for a city I know there's a city there Hallelujah he was just 4,000 years early Hallelujah and look what brother ramam says I love this he said Abraham sought a city on Earth you know he was looking for it because he was going to live here someday Abraham is in that City and and he went around looking for it he was looking where is this city where is this city and brother said and right on the same grounds where he looked it was just above him he was looking all down here Church all he had to do was look up amen it's that City Jesus is working on Hallelujah it was right above him Hallelujah of course he couldn't see it but brother said all he he had to do is look up CU he had the right location which just the city was still being uh it was in construction by God's grace oh it amen but he will return in the Millennium and he'll live in that City he was looking for glory amen so will you hallelujah we're looking for a city whose Builder maker is God and the reason you're looking for it is because that you have a mansion there you have a place you have a home there that God has prepared for you amen there's something deep inside of you calling out to a deep there's got to be a perfect City somewhere there's got to be a home for me somewhere there's got to be a place for I can be with Jesus somewhere and God has that place for you it's the city that's Builder maker is God and you got a mansion there Hallelujah I love preaching amen hallelujah thank you Jesus Glory being a prophet he was ordained and inspired he know there's a city somewhere and he was looking for it all right now of course that's Abraham you see that's where Jerusalem right there remember he met mezic right there he met God in a flesh body but later that God created a body to live in right and then God came and dwelt in that body of Jesus so mzc became Jesus Christ Hallelujah all right beautiful see now Salem means peace Jerusalem means the teaching of peace and mzc became Jesus Christ Abraham met God there that's because it was a foreshadowing of of when Abraham would meet Jesus Christ there Hallelujah he meet God in the body of Jesus Christ in a holy city a city that comes down from from Earth and church that's the city I want to be a part of I want to be a part of a peaceful City praise God the city of Peace the Bible said he is our peace Jesus is our peace the king of that city is peace personified Oh Glory okay now let me try to find some place to stop here I got leaves for the healing of Nations I already kind of went through that uh the tree of life has fruits for the Overcomers so you have a glorified body that can eat food as well you won't have to have it but it's just it's a benefit of being uh one one of God's children praise God you won't need it but you can have it if you want it by God's grace every month that tree will yield its fruit oh there be a River of Life flowing right on the throne of God uh the lamb will be the temple thereof okay now I want to go through this here briefly everybody take a deep breath can you take a deep breath it's kind of like resetting your brain hallelujah or your your human Spirit remember there's there's still Nations even though there's a city there's still Nations outside on the whole Earth and there's Kings outside of that City now I don't know if that's going to be you and I we'll get sent out at sometime I don't know I don't know if that'll be the foolish virgin and they'll have some or if God's going to take some of the some of the wise virgin from the city and kind of let them go out there remember brother man said you can travel in a thought you can travel like that right so you could live in the city and just like boom you could go out to Africa or go out to Australia or wherever you might go right so you want you won have to jump on any plane Hallelujah you won't have to get in any car and drive H 15 hours to get anywhere you'll be there in a split second but there's Nations brother Ram said outside the gates spread across the new Earth Nations will dwell in Eternal peace honored Kings will bring their Glory into it I love what brother Ram said says here no sin can be there no more bobbed haired women will enter that City remember the Bible says if a woman cuts her hair it's a shame and disgrace upon her husband right the word shame means a repulse right repulsive is like oh L because it shows she she doesn't want to be under the headship of her husband so she cuts her hair that's what the Bible says but there there won't be any of that in the new city Hallelujah there'll be no sin in the new city he said I'll guarantee you that no more short wearing like we saw Cas and I we went to the fair today right to do for we saw so many short wearing people with barely any clothes on there'll be none of that the Bible tells you what you're going to wear you're going to wear a white robe hallelujah it's going to be all the way from your shoulder down to your your feet because that's what Jesus had on in the Book of Revelation everybody's going to have a white robe on ain't they going to be beautiful it says shows we're all unified we're all children of the most high God hallelujah there be no cigarettes smoking no hor mongers no no Liars no idolators won't enter that City no it'll be all over sin will be gone nothing to defile its Holiness shall ever enter therein so see the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of Jesus right and the kings of the earth do bring their Glory and Honor into it and here it is and there shall be in no wise enter into anything that defil neither whatsoever worketh Abomination so be no Abomination there nothing abominable will enter into that Holy City Hallelujah that's the kind of City I don't know they been or maketh a lie there'll be no lies in that City no one ever would tell a lie in that City but they which are written in the Lamb's Book of Life Hallelujah glory to God brother Ram said these nations will bring in their tithes and offerings so see they're going to be they're going to be Farmers well there's going to be farmers in the in the future home too they're going to bring their Glory and Honor what can a king from a nation do to honor God bringing their tithes and offerings to the temple of God cuz Jesus is the Temple there is not going to be a temple because Jesus is the temple Hallelujah Glory see the Bible says honor the Lord with thy substance and with the first fruits of thine increase so see that's their tithes and offerings the kings of the Earth are going to plant all these Vineyards and farms and they're going to bring their ties and offerings to Jesus see that's why you should bring your ties and offerings now prise the Lord hallelujah ties go to the pastor which you guys are praying for one offering go for the bill building to handle all the other Affairs right but ties are for the pastor so he can live and just preach the gospel now I'm still praying for our church to get big enough so I can just preach full-time but God hasn't granted that but that's okay because Paul never Paul Paul was a he wasn't a full-time preacher either do you know that Paul's a Tent Maker you know that Paul made tents and then he go preach I go to school I go teach lessons and then I go preach Hallelujah so I'm not alone Paul was like that too I'm hoping someday could be a full-time pastor but see in most churches if the church is big enough they all their ties 10 10% of everybody's income could support one man so he can just preach the gospel pray fast and then minister to the congregation all right now I'm going to try to skip ahead yeah brother man said all the kings of the earth bring their honor into it see it's like the tribe of Levi all the rest of them paid ties to him you see so brother through all all these Kings of the countries they'll be bringing in with their horses and and their buggies and everything and their their trailers they're going to be bringing in the ties of the Corn and the oil and the wine they're going to be paying their tithes to Jesus Christ what about the people that don't pay ties and offerings now I got a feeling they won't be there right right the Bible said how how could a man rob God and not give God 10% of his income a man robs God when he won't pay his tithes and offerings and the church said I have paid tithes since I became a pastor I don't think I've ever missed a tie payment God has poured out so many blessings on me I can't even I couldn't even begin to tell you how many blessings poured out on me remember I told you got my identity stolen somebody stole my identity I lost $1,000 well guess what I went and preach to that Kentucky Church a man walked up and gave me 2,000 and another man gave my children 300 so God paid me back and he paid me with a lot of interest in there too right God will owe no man anything I'm a wit of that by God's grace it's just one sign of God's love church if you honor God God will honor you Hallelujah now here's one I don't know if you ever heard this I can prove there's degrees in heaven and they'll not all be the same equal but you'll have equal eternal life the Bible said the kings of the earth bring their Glory and Honor into the city that proves there'll be kings in the new Earth Kings and rulers Jesus told them they said what will we have after we left father mother and all to follow you so see there's going to be degrees just like there's degrees of angels right there's archangels there's seraphim there's cherubims there's wormwood there's all these angels they have they have levels some have more Authority than others so it is with you and I there's going to be some of us who are kings and queens Hallelujah other people won't be kings and queens they'll just be Governors over Nations or there'll be rulers over cities Jesus said if you're faithful with five talents and you make 10 he said I'll make you ruler over 10 cities Hallelujah see God is going to he's going to find who are the faithful ones that love to serve me who are the ones that love to sacrifice who are the ones that love to pray give alms give tithes give offerings uh fast and seek my face and God's going to reward them and they're going to be kings and queens there's going to be all kinds of rulers in this future home how many you want to be there by God's grace and church I don't care if I'm a king or I'm the lowest peasant as long as I'm there Hallelujah oh Jesus just let me be there hallelujah praise God I don't care if I'm the lowest of the lowest peasants just let me be with Jesus for all eternity praise God because I know I'm not worthy and I know I fall short of God's glory but I do love Jesus Christ and I am trusting in the grace of Jesus Christ how many trusting in God's grace tonight I'm almost done you've been a wonderful audience here remember Revelation 225 I'm going to go here and then jump up here and there should be no night there there's no night in that City and they need no candle neither light of the Sun for the Lord God giveth them light and they shall rain forever and ever see if you can Reign Over sin now God's going to let you be a Reign or ruler in the future city amen if you can just like I've heard a preacher say if you can just overcome smoking God will make you a ruler in the future home like I preached there if you can just overcome pornography if you can just beat that God will make you a ruler in the future home Hallelujah now other countries if they can just give their life as a martyr like in Nigeria or China if they can just lay their head on a chopping block and have their head cut off if they can just rule over that God will make them a ruler in the future home hallelujah amen we in America we're so pampered and so blessed God help us just to overcome what the the the trials that we have so if we rule now over sin God will make us a ruler over over cities and Nations there in the future home praise God hallelujah glory to God it's a faithful saying for if we be dead with him that's why we got to die every day right we shall also live with him if we suffer we shall also reign with him see it's promised if you can just get through your suffering maybe you lost a loved one or lost a child or you suffered some other way or had cancer if you can just suffer through those trials and still serve God and still Reign Over sin God will make you a ruler in the future home and the Millennium I'm going to bring that back in you'll rule in the Millennium and also the future your home if you can just suffer for Jesus Christ now how many want to suffer for Christ now I do too you can't reain unless you suffer on this earth now for me and brother even brother the greatest suffering he said he went through was being rejected by all the churches he went from having crowds of uh tens of 20 thousands over a whole week he might have 300,000 people there he went from that to barely having just a real small Church all because he preached the Bible truth serpent seed godhead there's only one person in Godhead Lord Jesus Christ baptism women and men should dress holy he got rejected he said that was the hardest thing he went through we had to move out to Arizona he left his whole family God called him out there so he could get the revelation of the Seven Seals amen hallelujah hey Church what's been the hardest thing I've seen we have a guy in our church his dad kicked him out because he came to believe the message he was homeless and guess who let him in I let him in to live with me for a couple months until he could afford his own apartment that's the suffering we have to deal with here in America right but you know what people call me the devil I've been called Satan I've been called Judas I've been called everything but as long as God calls me forgiven that's all I care about praise God I got to be called names I got to have people mock me or make fun of me or walk out of my service that's fine as long as Jesus Christ loves me and forgives me I I I'll take any rejection I'll take any persecution because I want to reain over sin that I'm sorry I want to suffer now so I can reain later Hallelujah and some of you yeah some of you your family rejects you that might be the suffering you're called to overcome that might be the suffering that you have to overcome you still have to love them you have to love your enemies right that might be the suffering but if you can overcome that and still show Divine love and still pray for them and still ask God deal with them God bring them to Salvation God will put a crown on your head someday well done good and faithful servant because you suffered now you shall reain Hallelujah that's right church I'm trying to close I wish I could close there'll be animals

tree of life I mean the River of Life the Pearly Gates those are all great but Church what's the one reason you want to be there because Jesus is there that's the real reason you want to be there yeah your family and that's going to be awesome too thank God God Saves our families but the real reason we want to be there is because Jesus is that City and we get to have fellowship with Jesus for all eternity where we never run out of time he always have more time for you Hallelujah that City can you see it there is where the bride and the groom will settle now if you think it's wonderful when we drive hundreds of miles to sit here and feed on this word which is only a shadow what will it be when we live in this city with him when I live next door neighbor to you brother irin maybe we'll be neighbors brother brother John maybe we'll be neighbors brother and when we eat of those trees we'll walk in those streets I say Hey Brother John hey let's go for a walk Brother come on let's go for a

Hallelujah walk in the paradises of God with angels hovering the earth singing the anthems so brother while we're walking to get some water we're going to hear the angel singing How Great Is Our God sing with me great I love that song Glory oh there's Amazing Grace the Angels picked up Amazing Grace there we are walking up to get a drink from the fountain oh what a what a time it's going to be Church what a time it's going to be what a day that will be the Bible said they shall walk with me in white for they are worthy see the blood has made you worthy because you confess your sins God gave you a new heart then he gave you a new spirit then he gave you his holy spirit so in his eyes he's worthy he's gone through the Redemption process he's gone through all three stages just like I took my Earth Hallelujah water Blood Fire for us it's justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost he's redeemed He's Worthy and they shall walk with me we're going to walk with Jesus and brother Noah well as we're walking maybe Jesus will step out like he did on the road to EMAs amen we're talking about Jesus Oh remember that song remember those meetings in jokes City remember when we used to have those meetings out in the basement praise God didn't even have a church but it don't matter wherever we are that's where the church is hallelujah and we're walking along talking about remember those days back there Jesus steps out of the background and he puts his arm on both of us come on come up come come up with me Sons let's go get a drink of water I'm going to take you to The Fountains of Life they shall walk with me in white that is what God says he'll bestow upon them for his upright walk see if we can Glory if we can just walk right now we'll walk with him in white in the new city Hallelujah God helped us to walk the right way that is part of their inheritance that he has reserved for them so see I'm not I'm not like like I said I'm not interested in inheriting a 100 acres I just want to inherit Walking With Jesus that will be enough for me that' be enough just let me have a chance to stroll with Jesus down the transparent streets of gold I love look at this quote if they were willing to walk with him listen through the toils and snares of this life if you can just make it through the toils in your life if you can just overcome the snares that the Satan traps there like with with maybe lying or adultery or fornication or or stealing or money laundering if you just overcome those snares and walk the right way here you'll walk with Jesus over there Lord It's thus say the Bible they shall walk with me in white because they're worthy Lord and if you can be an honor to him like he's honored you he's going to reward you he's not forgetful of our labor of love love that's what the Bible says the Lord God will always recompense us for our efforts to please him yes they'd walked through the world and had not partaken of it see like we went to the fair today all these people are partaking of all these evil dance they're dancing for the devil they're they already got any clothes on they're drinking beers people drinking beers but see my my daughter and I we walk through the world we don't partake of that we're like strangers looking at why is she dressed like that why is he dressed like that couple of people saw my Jesus shirt they said hey I'm a Christian too I say glory to God Amen Hallelujah but see we have to walk through this world and not touch the things of the world they not let the World Systems overcome them now he would honor them in return for they shall walk with him in white he would identify himself with them in the New Jerusalem how marvelous would be that identification it makes me rejoice and yet it makes me weep to think of his condescension how he's so great but yet he condescended to to become visible to us for you will note that he's not dressed in any other different color from the Saints as Earthly leaders would do so today no they are like him he's like them they are like him even as John said for they shall see him as he is all right yes let's read this one the bride goes wherever the bridegroom is she will never be left by him she will never leave his side she will share the throne with him she will be crowned with his glory and honor Hallelujah is this the last one let me read two more things okay this is the second and last one and I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God last one I found this one earlier and all up and down here in the city will be the redeemed is that isn't that going to be awesome every new person you meet it's going to be like oh you're you know about Jesus you you've repented of your sins you've got the whole you got the Holy Ghost when you were on Earth praise God every person it's not like here where you meet people hardly anybody's saved hardly anybody knows Jesus but in that City everyone you meet is going to be your redeemed brother and sister I can't wait for that Hallelujah there will be houses
