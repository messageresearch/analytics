Description:
The Lord Jesus Christ inspired a brother from England to cancel the financial debt of a member of our church who recently repented and returned after five years of running from the presence of the Lord. We give all the glory to Jesus Christ and want to thank our precious brother from England for obeying the Holy Spirit. We have never seen love expressed like this from a brother we have never met, but it proves that the body of Christ is one in the Spirit.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] greetings friends in the mattress name of the lord jesus christ i'd like to just make a quick testimony video here about something recently that the lord did in a very wonderful and supernatural way by the grace of god i've had it on my heart to share this testimony and also thank the brother from england who has led to the lord to meet this need in our local assembly to begin with this is a testimony of a brother in our local church who i'll call alan of course that's not his real name he's a 25 year old man allen came to our church around 2015 or 16 and he stayed at our church for about a year and a half he attended nearly every service i baptized him in the name of the lord jesus christ and he faithfully served the lord for that year and a half he was such a wonderful brother to me and also he was like a big brother to my children he would play with them laugh with them and show them a lot of love after that year and a half he was with us he started having mind battles and decided to leave our church and he told me that he knew from the moment he left our church his life would go downhill because he was basically running from the presence of the lord and he said that is what happened for the next five years so for the next five years alan gave himself holy over to the world drugs the occult you name it he still had desires for worldly things and perhaps one day we'll make a video where he can share his own testimony himself i wanted to get out a quick testimony video because i think it would encourage the saints and also our brother peter from england alan said he would do so many drugs that he should have died many many times but the lord spared his life because he knew in the very depths of his being that the message was right god's bible-based message to william branham and the fact that he didn't die proves that god had his hand on allen's life and god had a purpose for alan's life that he is still going to fulfill during this five-year time period i would hear from alan every once in a while we would keep in touch through facebook and i would go on his facebook page and just be saddened by the pictures and things that i saw him write and it was discouraging because we had invested so much in allen during that year and a half but god kept us encouraged and during the whole five years alan was gone at least two of my daughters and perhaps more would put weekly prayer requests in for alan and another friend to return to our church now currently these daughters of mine are now 12 10 and 8 years old so that means when alan first left they were three five and seven years old as a father it truly warms my heart that jesus christ heard all the prayers of my little girls over this five-year time span even when sometimes i had doubts in my mind if allen would return or not then in 2021 allen decided he was ready to return to the church seek the baptism of the holy ghost and and fully serve god and stop running from the lord finally in december 2021 alan returned by the leadership of the holy spirit and also brought his girlfriend with him who also desires to seek the lord as alan returned we put him right to work i gave him a job here painting at the church until he could find a regular job alan and i had many times of rejoicing after the first service that he attended he came up for prayer and he said he felt burning on the inside of his body which we know was the holy spirit cleansing him out and later that week after that supernatural experience he observed how god gave him overcoming grace and he noticed his temper was gone so the holy spirit was doing a sanctification work through our brother and he literally felt it on the inside of him as i would talk with alan about his situation of course finances would come up and i'm a pastor that's one of my desires to help out the saints financially and i found that allen had a lot of debts and our church is a small church we've always tried to be generous and give as much money as we possibly can so our church wasn't able to help him out with any of his debts one day after fellowshipping with allen i was leaving his apartment and i was at a red light sitting in the car just thinking about a situation i just whispered a humble prayer to the lord jesus i said something like lord you own the cattle on a thousand hills and i know that you can send the finances that he needs to get out of debt so he won't worry about all the debts he accumulated while he was in the world sinning and running away from you i'd even consider taking out a personal loan to help out our brother because i was so blessed that he left everything and traveled across the entire united states just to move into our local church because he knew the presence of jesus christ was in our church and he needed a home church he knew god chose the foolishness of preaching to save them that would believe for some reason though i could never call the bank to get the personal loan i just kind of kept waiting on the lord for it and then one tuesday morning i turned on my phone and checked my email and i had an email from paypal and i looked at the money someone was trying to send me i was completely shocked the amount of money was in thousands of dollars and i knew when i looked at that screen that it was jesus christ answering my prayer to help cancel our brother's debts and of course that email was from our brother peter from england and apparently he had listened to a few of our live streams or archive services on youtube and he heard me talk about a financial need but i never said the amount but the holy spirit put it on our brother's heart to help out this couple who had left everything to follow the lord jesus christ and this end time message why waited for the money to be cleared into my account and i didn't tell alan about it until a wednesday night service when i preached about the disciple whom jesus loved of course the sermon was about saint john the one that knew he was loved by jesus christ at the end of the sermon i talked about how each one of us should realize that we are the ones that jesus loves i could say i'm jesse the disciple whom jesus loved and each member of the church could say i'm so-and-so the disciple whom jesus loved at that moment i had thought to make the end of this sermon the announcement about how god had provided for allen's financial debts so i finished the sermon by saying allen the disciple whom jesus loved it was a special moment as i showed on the screen how we had received thousands of dollars to get alan completely out of debt and i told aon i said and i said just as jesus christ took away your sin debt now jesus christ is going to take away your financial debt it was a beautiful moment of weeping and worshiping and giving god glory and it proved to alan and his girlfriend that jesus christ can provide every need we may have to wait on it we certainly have to wait on his perfect will for every prayer request but we know jesus christ is jehovah jireh the god who provides brother allen says now this weight of burden worrying about the financial debts has lifted off his shoulders and he no longer stays up at night or wakes up at night worrying about the financial debts that we as a church couldn't help him out with because we're such a small church he's now free from that worry he's free from that anxiety and he and his girlfriend were so moved by this expression of love from jesus christ through our brother peter from england that they immediately wanted to go be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ both of them were re-baptized a few days ago as a sign of recommitment to the gospel of jesus christ and the god who loves them in closing i want to thank brother peter from england brother peter the lord led you to do something that i could not do you followed the leadership of the lord and did something that not even the church could do for our brother brother peter you fulfilled the scripture from second corinthians 8 verse 7 because you have abounded in generosity toward the needy saints therefore as ye abound in everything in faith and utterance and knowledge and in all diligence and in your love to us see that ye abound in this grace also thank you brother peter for abounding in the grace of generosity and care for god's saints you've also manifested the love of god in philemon 1 verse 18 where paul said if he hath wronged thee or oweth thee ought put that on mine account of course paul was speaking to philemon about philemon's servant who had deserted him named onesimus and paul said put his debt on my account and i'll pay it off brother peter from england that's what you've done you've shown the love of paul you have taken allen's debt upon yourself and paid it off thank you brother and i hope this video has expressed our gratitude first towards the lord jesus christ for putting that on your heart and also for obeying the lord jesus christ to help our brother get out of debt and have a true supernatural sign from god that jesus christ is with him as he leaves and forsakes everything of the world all of his family friends and everything else to follow this bible-based message this end time message that god sent our prophet our brother william branham i'll leave everyone with the premier scripture proverbs chapter 3 verses 5 and 6 trust in the lord with all thine heart and lean not unto thine own understanding in all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct thy paths trust in the lord with all your hearts friends god hears all your prayers he heard the prayers of my little girls for the last five years he heard my prayer sitting at that red light there in downtown akron and he hears your prayers too god bless you and may jesus christ be the desire of your heart
