[1:47] findly him over bring him back and there
[1:50] was a plane setting waiting to take me
[1:52] over that morning bring me back at night
[1:53] to Germany the heidleberg Germany for
[1:57] the resurrection of this baby I said
[1:58] sure God can do it but let's see what
[2:00] his will is then I went out prayed all
[2:03] night nothing happened come back the
[2:04] next morning nothing happened and I
[2:06] started into the room just then I looked
[2:09] there and there stood that light hanging
[2:10] there in the door said don't put your
[2:12] hand on that don't rebuke that that's a
[2:15] hand of God I got her on the phone I
[2:18] said sister STL bury your baby it's a
[2:20] hand of the lord it's God's will
[2:23] something Happ that baby down along the
[2:25] line you live go right where God knows
[2:27] where it's at you can go to it now it
[2:29] lives W you leave it right like that
[2:32] that great Lutheran preacher in Germany
[2:34] wrote a letter and said how I can
[2:36] appreciate what brother brandom waiting
[2:38] for that clear-cut decision of God
[2:40] before he said anything that's it all to
[2:44] God's decision no matter what others say
[2:47] whatever it is don't proposition Satan
[2:49] at all if Satan says now water baptism
[2:53] name father that he proposes you leave
[2:55] it alone God said otherwise he said
[2:57] you're a good man you don't have to be
[2:59] your good woman you don't have to do
[3:00] don't you proposition if the word says
[3:02] something different you stay with the
[3:03] word regardless what is that's the
[3:06] example Jesus give to you and there's
[3:08] that major assault you see that he made
[3:10] on him sister stats Cliff you're not
[3:13] long ago that really had my heart
[3:15] whirling around a little
[3:18] mother she lost her baby and the
[3:22] Lord was seen fit to take it away and
[3:25] she'd call me and she wanted to go to
[3:28] fly me over to Germany and the doctor
[3:30] was so kind to wait let the baby lay
[3:33] there the little fell died suddenly a
[3:35] sweet little plumpy girl and sister stas
[3:38] Cliff had lost her mother and she's
[3:40] pretty well broke up this baby certainly
[3:44] had got the best of her and she got on
[3:45] the phone long distance from Germany and
[3:48] wanted to fly over and I said sister
[3:49] stat
[3:50] Cliff she confessed her faith that she
[3:54] believed that the Lord Jesus had sent me
[3:56] for the work in the last days and such a
[3:58] loyal testimony
[4:00] no one could give him she meant it with
[4:02] all of her heart she hadd seen the Lord
[4:04] God do such things as that raise up the
[4:07] dead after they were dead but you see
[4:10] you really as much as I how a glory that
[4:14] would have been to God in Germany and
[4:15] everything if I could have done it
[4:17] myself I would have done it but the
[4:19] first thing we mustn't go until we know
[4:22] what we're going for so I went out and
[4:25] prayed and I think she stayed on the
[4:27] phone part of the time through the night
[4:28] and the next day I and there was nothing
[4:30] again mey said my wife said sister Sasa
[4:33] called twice any worded from the Lord
[4:35] yet I said not a thing and I said well
[4:38] when I pray again as in the woods that
[4:40] night then of course the little baby had
[4:43] to be taken care of and then just as I
[4:45] was coming in the Lord Jesus Vision
[4:47] struck standing front of me and I heard
[4:49] his voice said don't rebuke that that's
[4:52] the hand of the Lord so I knew then that
[4:56] God for some reason had taken her baby
[4:58] to Glory and it was certainly against
[5:01] the will of the Lord for me to say
[5:03] anything contrary to it and then I
[5:07] thought well that'll be a big let down
[5:08] but the one thing I did I minded the
[5:10] Lord I did what he told me you're not
[5:12] long ago I got a letter from a minister
[5:14] over there and he had made a statement
[5:17] by some more ministers he said the one
[5:20] and he was I think he might have been a
[5:22] German Luther I'm not sure but he said
[5:24] there's one thing that I can admire
[5:26] about brother brandom when all the
[5:28] excitement is going on he St study till
[5:30] he got a clear-cut decision from God
[5:32] then he know what he was doing that's
[5:34] the only way you can do those things is
[5:36] first hear from the Lord when he tells
[5:39] if he told me tonight that to go up
[5:42] there and raise out of that Cemetery
[5:45] President Kennedy I'd invite the whole
[5:48] world to come watch it done for i' have
[5:52] thus sayeth the
[5:54] Lord now but how can I say thus sayeth
[5:57] the Lord until the Lord has said thus
[6:01] many times people gets all excited and
[6:03] go under Impressions and things like
[6:05] that and what the best of their mental
[6:07] can think that ain't always true wait
[6:10] till he tells you and you know it then
[6:12] you've got exactly don't have to guess
[6:14] about it he's done told you it's thus
[6:16] sayith the Lord then he's told you and
[6:18] then you can go say what he said until
[6:21] then you can go and do everything you
[6:23] can do what you can yourself but you
[6:26] can't be sure until God has said so then
[6:29] you're positive on the tape of what time
[6:33] is it sir as many of you's got the tape
[6:35] I could speak for the chapters and
[6:38] anywhere else and say it's thus sayeth
[6:40] the Lord I'll meet seven angels and
[6:42] it'll be known the countryes over see
[6:45] and something's fixing to happen for he
[6:47] told me there it was just three months
[6:50] afterwards see all these other things
[6:53] when you when you the Lord has spoken
[6:55] it's got to
[6:57] happen that's the reason that I know
[7:00] that his word is
[7:02] perfect no matter what people think
[7:04] about it it's the word of God that's
[7:07] right that's thus sayeth the
[7:11] Lord that's and we know that that's true
[7:14] Jesus is coming when I don't know what
[7:18] farm how you come I have an idea but I I
[7:21] don't know it's roting here he said I if
[7:24] I be taken up you draw a man to him and
[7:27] he would come again I know he's coming
[7:30] right amen oh that's positive that's
[7:33] right and it doesn't matter to me when
[7:35] it is see if it's tonight or if it's
[7:38] next year or if it's a thousand years
[7:40] from now just so he comes I got eternal
[7:44] life I ain't going to be any older I'm
[7:46] just going to be there when he comes
[7:47] that's all that's it doesn't matter me
[7:50] when how which way he does it just so
[7:53] I'm there and he promised me that I
[7:55] would be there and he has already given
[7:57] me eternal life because he said he that
[8:00] can receive my words and Believe on him
[8:04] that sent me has eternal life and shall
[8:07] not come to the Judgment but pass from
[8:09] Death to life that's good enough for me
[8:12] right there I that's my
[8:14] absolute that's my absolute he promised
[8:17] it there's no way for it to ever fail it
[8:20] just cannot fail no more than God can
[8:23] fail it's impossible for God to fail
[8:26] that's one thing that God cannot do fail
[8:30] he can't fail aren't you happy for
[8:32] that oh my
