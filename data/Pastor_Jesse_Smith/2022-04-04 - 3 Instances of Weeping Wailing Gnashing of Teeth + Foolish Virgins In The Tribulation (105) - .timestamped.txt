[0:01] [Music]
[0:08] greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:10] of the lord jesus christ
[0:13] the purpose of this video is to show the
[0:15] three instances of weeping wailing and
[0:18] gnashing of teeth with two of them
[0:20] happening during the great tribulation
[0:22] period and the third happening in hell
[0:25] and at the heart of this video is also
[0:27] the state of the foolish virgin and it's
[0:29] of my opinion that the foolish virgin is
[0:31] saved as numerous scriptures show and
[0:34] also numerous quotes from god's prophet
[0:36] william branham's show
[0:38] the subject of the foolish virgin is
[0:40] quite a deep subject brother branham
[0:42] said it was quite a lesson when he
[0:44] taught on it in 1960 in the sermon
[0:47] called the patmos vision and i think all
[0:50] believers agree with that as well
[0:52] so this video is another exercise in
[0:54] rightly dividing the word of truth by
[0:56] the revelations god has given us through
[0:58] his prophet brother branham and again
[1:00] i'm always open to correction from the
[1:02] holy ghost as he can correct me
[1:03] privately or he can correct me publicly
[1:06] through saints of the lord
[1:08] and every christian should be open to
[1:09] correction just as brother branham
[1:11] modeled that
[1:12] the first instance of weeping and
[1:14] gnashing of teeth
[1:16] is the foolish virgin during the first
[1:18] three and a half years
[1:19] of the seven year great tribulation
[1:21] period
[1:22] the foolish virgin christians must give
[1:24] their lives as martyrs to the beast
[1:27] system in order to reject the mark of
[1:30] the beast
[1:31] and all foolish virgin christians will
[1:32] be saved at the great white throne
[1:34] judgment
[1:36] the second kind of weeping and gnashing
[1:38] of teeth is that of all the sinners who
[1:41] take the mark of the beast and this
[1:43] weeping and wailing and gnashing of
[1:44] teeth takes place during the second half
[1:47] of the seven year great tribulation
[1:48] period or in other words the last three
[1:51] and a half years of the tribulation
[1:53] this last three and a half years is the
[1:55] time when the wrath of god is poured out
[1:58] we must believe the scriptures that say
[2:00] the trumpets and vials bring forth the
[2:02] wrath of god and they cannot be poured
[2:05] out until after the 144 000 jews are
[2:09] sealed with the holy ghost in their
[2:10] foreheads according to revelation 7
[2:13] verse 3
[2:14] and revelation 8 verse 7.
[2:16] revelation 7 3 says this plainly saying
[2:19] hurt not the earth neither the sea nor
[2:22] the trees till we have sealed the
[2:24] servants of god in their foreheads
[2:27] notice the trees cannot be hurt until
[2:29] after the 144 000 are sealed with the
[2:32] holy ghost
[2:33] if you read revelation 8 verse 7 a third
[2:36] part of the trees are hurt after the
[2:38] sounding of the first trumpet this means
[2:40] the trumpets cannot be sounded until
[2:42] after the 144 000 are sealed with the
[2:45] holy ghost
[2:46] this helps us understand the order of
[2:48] the great tribulation then the first
[2:50] three and a half years is a time of
[2:52] torment but not the wrath of god for
[2:55] revelation 11 says these two prophets
[2:57] have a ministry of torment but it's also
[2:59] a time of peace that is made between
[3:02] israel and rome according to daniel 9
[3:04] verse 27 which says and he shall confirm
[3:07] the covenant with many for one week
[3:09] that's the antichrist making a covenant
[3:11] with the jews and the world for one week
[3:14] or seven years
[3:15] and then finishing verse 27 and in the
[3:17] midst of the week he shall cause the
[3:19] sacrifice of the oblation to cease and
[3:22] for the over spreading of abominations
[3:24] he shall make a desolate even until the
[3:25] consummation and that determined shall
[3:28] be poured upon the desolate
[3:30] so the bible is clear that the
[3:32] antichrist pope makes a covenant with
[3:34] the jews and the world for seven years
[3:37] this allows the jews to sacrifice
[3:39] animals for the first half of the seven
[3:41] year covenant because they have a newly
[3:43] rebuilt temple and this is also the
[3:45] first three and a half years of the
[3:46] ministry of the two prophets probably
[3:48] moses and elijah or men anointed with
[3:51] their spirits but it's clear the hundred
[3:53] forty four thousand cannot get sealed
[3:54] with the holy ghost until after the two
[3:56] prophets die and are resurrected then
[3:58] jesus will show himself to the 144
[4:00] thousand they'll say where did you get
[4:02] your wounds he'll say in the house of my
[4:04] friends they'll weep and go from house
[4:06] to house mourning but then the bible
[4:08] says the nation will be born in one day
[4:10] 144 000 will be born of the holy ghost
[4:13] baptism in one day
[4:15] so here's a visual to show the two
[4:17] instances of weeping and gnashing of
[4:19] teeth notice the foolish virgin have
[4:21] weeping and gnashing of teeth because
[4:22] they have to give their lives as martyrs
[4:24] for christ during the first half of the
[4:27] great seven year tribulation period
[4:29] and here's the second case of weeping
[4:31] and gnashing of teeth
[4:33] this is experienced by all the sinners
[4:35] who took the mark of the beast during
[4:37] the great tribulation period
[4:38] and the third happening in hell
[4:41] which we will show with numerous
[4:42] scriptures and quotes
[4:46] the reason the foolish virgin subject is
[4:48] quite a lesson as brother graham said is
[4:50] because it's part of three mysteries of
[4:53] god
[4:54] as described by the bible itself
[4:56] last year i wrote a book about the 12
[4:58] new testament mysteries of god
[5:00] which god revealed to brother branham
[5:02] because brother branham fulfilled
[5:03] revelation 10 7
[5:05] the mystery of god had to be finished
[5:06] before the end time
[5:08] so the subject of the foolish virgins is
[5:10] found in at least three or perhaps four
[5:13] new testament mysteries
[5:15] the first is the new testament church as
[5:17] the bride of christ
[5:19] the reason the foolish virgins are part
[5:20] of this mystery is because they're not
[5:22] the bride of christ because they have
[5:24] not been born again in their souls by
[5:26] the baptism of the holy ghost
[5:28] they don't have the oil of the baptism
[5:30] of the holy ghost according to the
[5:32] parable of the 10 virgins in matthew 25
[5:34] verses 1 through 13.
[5:36] a second mystery the foolish virgin is a
[5:39] part of is the mystery of godliness
[5:41] because the mystery of godliness shows
[5:43] how godliness or the anointing and
[5:45] character of christ is restored to man
[5:48] as soon as a christian is saved he has
[5:50] the anointing of faith
[5:52] and as the stature of a perfect man
[5:54] teaches you must get seven anointings
[5:56] before your being is capped off with
[5:58] charity which is the baptism of the holy
[6:00] ghost
[6:01] so foolish virgins have at least the
[6:03] anointing of faith but they can also get
[6:05] the anointing of virtue knowledge
[6:07] temperance patience godliness and
[6:09] brotherly kindness
[6:10] these seven anointings and then the
[6:12] eighth that caps off the believer's soul
[6:14] is how god restores godliness to man
[6:17] the foolish virgin never completes the
[6:19] stature of a perfect man they never
[6:21] received charity or the baptism of the
[6:24] holy ghost due to their cares of the
[6:26] world as jesus taught in the parable of
[6:28] the foregrounds in mark chapter 4 verse
[6:31] 19.
[6:33] the third mystery is the mystery of
[6:35] christ in you the hope of glory also
[6:37] called the baptism of the holy ghost so
[6:39] the foolish virgin are foolish and do
[6:42] not redeem their time in order to
[6:44] receive the baptism of the holy ghost
[6:46] only the wise virgins redeem their time
[6:49] and obey the word of god to the point
[6:51] where they can be baptized with the holy
[6:53] ghost according to acts 5 verse 32
[6:56] the scripture says god gives the holy
[6:58] ghost to them that obey him so the
[7:00] foolish virgins didn't obey in
[7:01] everything so god could not fill them
[7:03] with the holy ghost
[7:05] and the fourth mystery is the mystery of
[7:06] the kingdom of heaven the foolish
[7:08] virgins are mentioned in a few of these
[7:11] parables of the kingdom of heaven
[7:13] most notably in the parable of the king
[7:16] son in matthew chapter 22 which we'll
[7:18] show soon
[7:19] and of course the other mention is in
[7:21] the parable of the ten virgins found in
[7:23] matthew 25 verses 1 to 13.
[7:28] so here's the outline for the video
[7:30] we'll first look at defining context
[7:34] and then we'll look at the nine examples
[7:35] from the bible about weeping wailing and
[7:38] gnashing of teeth
[7:39] and lastly we'll listen to brother
[7:41] braham's quotes about this subject
[7:45] defining context
[7:47] friends it's important as we look at the
[7:49] subject of foolish virgins and also
[7:51] weeping wailing and gnashing of teeth to
[7:53] understand context in the dictionary
[7:56] context means the circumstances that
[7:58] form the setting for an event
[8:01] statement or idea and in terms of which
[8:03] it can be fully understood and assessed
[8:06] it also means the parts of something
[8:08] written or spoken that immediately
[8:10] precede and follow a word or passage and
[8:13] clarify its meaning
[8:15] if you look up the word context in the
[8:17] thesaurus it uses similar words like
[8:20] circumstances conditions
[8:22] surroundings
[8:24] or situation
[8:25] and that's what this video is going to
[8:26] do we're going to look at the seven
[8:28] situations in which jesus talked about
[8:31] weeping wailing and gnashing of teeth
[8:33] and also there are two portions of
[8:34] scripture in revelation about wailing
[8:37] and weeping
[8:38] we're going to examine the context of
[8:40] each use looking at the scriptures
[8:42] beforehand and afterward so we can fully
[8:45] understand what the bible's teaching
[8:48] and it's my humble opinion after
[8:49] studying about these praying about them
[8:52] and searching the quotes of brother
[8:53] branham that there have to be three
[8:55] instances of weeping wailing and
[8:57] gnashing of teeth one for the foolish
[8:59] virgins and then one for the sinners who
[9:01] took the mark of the beast
[9:03] and the third happening in hell
[9:06] the nine bible references to weeping
[9:08] wailing and gnashing of teeth
[9:11] friends there are seven instances where
[9:13] the bible talks about weeping wailing
[9:15] and gnashing of teeth but one of them is
[9:17] a parallel passage so there's really six
[9:19] different times it's spoken of in
[9:21] scripture in the four gospels
[9:23] the book of revelation talks about
[9:25] weeping wailing and gnashing of teeth as
[9:27] well which we'll show but let's start by
[9:29] looking at the first instance the first
[9:31] scripture is from matthew 8 verses 10
[9:33] through 12
[9:34] and this one has a parallel passage in
[9:36] luke 13 verses 27 through 29
[9:40] these are the first two bible references
[9:42] to weeping wailing and gnashing of teeth
[9:44] so please read this entire scripture on
[9:47] your own for context
[9:49] but we can clearly see the context of
[9:51] the weeping wailing and gnashing of
[9:53] teeth here is hell
[9:55] because of the surrounding verses and
[9:56] their situations
[9:58] so this is a story about the roman
[10:00] centurion's gentile faith
[10:02] jesus said there would be many which
[10:04] likely refers to gentiles that would
[10:06] come from all four directions to sit
[10:08] next to abraham isaac and jacob in the
[10:10] kingdom of heaven so this sitting next
[10:12] to the three patriarchs would either be
[10:14] the millennium or the new jerusalem
[10:17] and so the weeping and gnashing of teeth
[10:18] seems to be hell in this case
[10:20] because jesus is saying the jews would
[10:22] be cast out of the future millennial
[10:24] reign or the new jerusalem kingdom
[10:27] and in the parallel passage in luke 13
[10:30] christ called these ones that were cast
[10:32] out workers of iniquity and we know
[10:34] according to matthew 7 verses 21 through
[10:36] 23 jesus said he never knew the workers
[10:39] of iniquity and he said depart from me
[10:42] so of course these workers iniquity
[10:43] would go to hell
[10:45] so again the context is jews who
[10:47] blasphemed and rejected christ it's
[10:50] likely they'll be cast into the lake of
[10:51] fire where there's weeping wailing and
[10:53] gnashing of teeth
[10:55] the third scripture is matthew 13 verses
[10:58] 41
[10:59] and 42
[11:00] so the context of this scripture makes
[11:03] it seem like the weeping wailing
[11:04] gnashing of teeth is hell again
[11:07] this is the parable of the wheat and
[11:08] tares and jesus gives us his own
[11:11] interpretation of the parable here jesus
[11:13] says the tares or children of satan are
[11:15] cast into a furnace of fire
[11:18] causing a wailing and gnashing of teeth
[11:20] jesus also called them workers of
[11:22] iniquity which matches the tares with
[11:24] the workers of iniquity that he
[11:25] described again in matthew 7 21-23
[11:30] so the workers iniquity would be ones
[11:32] who took the mark of the beast and their
[11:34] destiny would be hellfire
[11:36] a fourth scripture is matthew 13 verses
[11:38] 48 through 50 and again the context is
[11:41] likely hell
[11:42] because this is a parable of christ the
[11:45] parable of the net cast into the sea
[11:47] jesus gives the same context the end of
[11:49] the world and also again mentions a
[11:51] furnace of fire
[11:53] meaning the lake of fire after the great
[11:55] white throne judgment and of course he
[11:57] connects us with wailing and gnashing of
[11:59] teeth which speaks of punishment and
[12:01] torment
[12:03] the fifth mention of weeping wailing and
[12:05] gnashing of teeth is matthew 22 13.
[12:08] i believe this is the only scripture out
[12:10] of the six different scriptures that the
[12:12] context means the great tribulation
[12:14] period for the foolish virgins
[12:17] the context is the parable of the king's
[12:19] son
[12:20] and it speaks of a supper for the king's
[12:22] son which means the marriage supper of
[12:24] the lamb as revelation chapter 19
[12:26] mentions as well
[12:28] and notice in this parable in matthew 22
[12:31] verses 1 to 14 there's no mention of a
[12:34] furnace of fire
[12:35] so jesus never said those without the
[12:37] wedding garment would be cast into a
[12:38] furnace of fire he just said they would
[12:40] be cast out into outer darkness where
[12:43] there's weeping and gnashing of teeth
[12:45] the fact that the man without the
[12:47] wedding garment was gathered with those
[12:49] who had the wedding garment showed he
[12:51] wanted to be in the rapture
[12:52] or the wedding of jesus christ and his
[12:54] bride church but was speechless and had
[12:57] no testimony of overcoming by the blood
[12:59] of the lamb
[13:00] and had no word for his testimony
[13:03] since the wedding supper symbolizes
[13:05] where the true holy ghost-filled bride
[13:07] goes after the rapture the man that's
[13:09] kicked out without a garment has to go
[13:10] to the great tribulation period or stay
[13:13] upon the earth so we can see how outer
[13:15] darkness symbolizes the great
[13:16] tribulation period there's no more light
[13:18] to the gentiles as jesus said in luke 21
[13:21] 24 the times of the gentiles is over
[13:24] there's no more mercy to the gentiles
[13:26] they've had their day of grace the wild
[13:28] olive branch according to romans 11 has
[13:30] been cut off and the holy branch israel
[13:32] has been grafted back in
[13:34] so the guest without the wedding garment
[13:36] represents believers who respond to
[13:38] preaching about the end times and gather
[13:40] worship with the holy ghost-filled
[13:42] saints but they themselves fail to
[13:44] receive the gift of the holy ghost
[13:46] for more on the subject of the foolish
[13:47] virgin i want to reference two videos
[13:49] that will help you the first is two
[13:51] kinds of christians and two
[13:52] resurrections
[13:53] it's video number 66 on my youtube
[13:55] channel
[13:56] and also a more recent video you can be
[13:59] saved but not born again which is video
[14:01] 101 on my youtube channel as well
[14:05] i want to show two other scriptures that
[14:07] show how the foolish virgin will weep
[14:09] wail and have gnashing of teeth during
[14:11] the tribulation period yet they can
[14:13] still be saved
[14:14] the first is matthew 25 verse 6 and
[14:17] verses 11 through 13 in the parable of
[14:20] the ten virgins notice there was a cry
[14:22] to go meet the bridegroom at midnight so
[14:25] again this is a time of darkness which
[14:27] would match the outer darkness spoken of
[14:29] in the parable of the king's son in
[14:31] matthew chapter 22
[14:32] and then remember the wise virgins go
[14:34] out to meet the bridegroom while the
[14:36] foolish go get oil will the foolish
[14:38] eventually come to the bridegroom's
[14:39] house and knock and try to get in but
[14:42] the bible says the lord answered and
[14:44] said verily i say unto you i know you
[14:46] not watch therefore for you know neither
[14:48] the day nor the hour wherein the son of
[14:50] man cometh
[14:51] notice jesus never mentions hellfire or
[14:54] furnace of fire for the foolish virgins
[14:56] and the fact that their virgins
[14:58] is a good sign their virgin to christ
[15:01] which means they don't have any
[15:02] spiritual intercourse with idols the
[15:04] foolish versions were true to the word
[15:06] of god that they held and of course they
[15:08] were foolish to go on with the lord and
[15:10] receive the full revelation of the word
[15:12] of god and eventually the baptism of the
[15:14] holy ghost
[15:15] the third scripture that goes along with
[15:17] matthew 22 and matthew 25 1-13
[15:21] is the scriptural context of revelation
[15:23] chapter 13 verses 11 through 18. this is
[15:27] a portion of scripture about the
[15:29] catholic church working through the
[15:30] united states of america and remember
[15:33] brother branham told us to watch the
[15:34] purple curtain so that's why we watch
[15:37] how the united states government makes
[15:38] laws today as we're watching the us
[15:41] government we're really watching the
[15:42] purple curtain
[15:43] because rome is the beast that rose up
[15:46] out of the sea at the beginning of
[15:47] revelation 13 but also is the same beast
[15:50] that rose up out of the land in the
[15:51] second half of revelation chapter 13.
[15:54] so in revelation chapter 13 verses 12
[15:57] 15 16 and 17 we see the beast or the
[16:01] united states with the satanic anointing
[16:03] of the spirit of rome is giving power to
[16:05] lay down its mark and the foolish
[16:07] virgins then are given a life or death
[16:09] choice
[16:10] and verse 15 says those that don't take
[16:12] the mark should be killed
[16:15] so that completes the three scriptural
[16:17] references where the foolish virgin
[16:19] would have weeping wailing and gnashing
[16:20] of teeth matthew 22 13
[16:23] matthew 25 verses 1 to 13 and revelation
[16:27] 13 verses 11 through 18.
[16:30] later in this video i'll show quotes
[16:31] where brother rahm says specifically
[16:33] that the foolish virgin will be martyred
[16:35] and will have weeping and wailing and
[16:37] gnashing of teeth in the tribulation
[16:38] period
[16:40] the sixth mention of weeping wailing and
[16:41] gnashing of teeth is in matthew 24 verse
[16:45] 51 the context is chapter 24 verses 32
[16:49] through 51
[16:51] the context is hell
[16:53] as jesus calls this servant evil in
[16:55] verse 48 this evil servant is not
[16:58] faithful and is not a wise servant as
[17:00] jesus described earlier in the parable
[17:02] this evil servant cannot be the foolish
[17:04] virgin because the foolish virgin would
[17:05] not get drunk alcoholism is an idol it's
[17:08] something people go to that they love
[17:10] more than god
[17:11] they go to alcohol to take care of their
[17:13] problems rather than the mercy and blood
[17:15] of jesus christ
[17:16] also foolish virgins do not smite their
[17:19] people
[17:20] they are god-fearing people like the
[17:22] church age book says
[17:23] here's a quote from chapter 7 where
[17:25] brother brahm says the foolish virgin is
[17:28] a separated god-loving people trying to
[17:30] abide in the word it is the second
[17:32] resurrection wherein the five foolish
[17:34] virgins come up
[17:36] notice that they were virgins
[17:38] they did not have the holy spirit so
[17:40] they missed being in the bride while the
[17:42] five wise who had oil became a part of
[17:45] that bride
[17:46] but these people being a separated god
[17:48] loving people and trying to abide in the
[17:51] word according to what they knew of it
[17:53] and being a help in the work of the lord
[17:55] will come up at the end of time
[17:58] they will miss the millennium which you
[18:00] can begin to see by these truths is much
[18:02] more important and wonderful than we
[18:03] have ever thought or believed
[18:07] jesus also said this evil servant gets a
[18:09] portion with the hypocrites and he gets
[18:12] cut asunder
[18:13] so again foolish virgins are not evil
[18:16] they're virgins but they're just foolish
[18:18] and don't go all the way with god they
[18:20] don't surrender fully to the holy ghost
[18:23] the seventh mention of weeping wailing
[18:24] and gnashing of teeth is matthew 25 30.
[18:28] the context is verses 14 through 30 and
[18:31] the context here again is hell
[18:34] this is the parable of the talents jesus
[18:36] calls
[18:37] this one talent man wicked and slothful
[18:41] this parable is also speaking of
[18:43] reckoning according to verse 19 or
[18:45] judgment or giving account before jesus
[18:48] in his holy presence
[18:50] as i mentioned earlier there are two
[18:51] portions of scripture in revelation
[18:54] about wailing and weeping which i'd like
[18:56] to read
[18:57] and these verses are the eighth and
[18:58] ninth mentions of weeping wailing and
[19:01] gnashing of teeth the last mentions of
[19:03] this subject in the new testament at
[19:05] least according to the verses i could
[19:07] find
[19:08] the first one is revelation 1 verse 7
[19:11] and the second portion is revelation 18
[19:13] verses 11 15 and 19.
[19:16] revelation 1 verse 7 says behold he
[19:19] cometh with clouds and every eye shall
[19:21] see him and they also which pierced him
[19:24] and all the kindreds of the earth shall
[19:26] wail because of him even so amen
[19:30] this scripture proves there's wailing at
[19:32] the battle of armageddon for that is the
[19:34] context of this scripture
[19:36] the only time every eye will see jesus
[19:38] is when he returns for the battle of
[19:40] armageddon
[19:41] this is the scripture that shows there's
[19:43] weeping during the second half of the
[19:45] seven year tribulation period when the
[19:48] trumpets are sounding and the vows are
[19:49] being poured
[19:50] out the second portion of scripture from
[19:53] revelation was chapter 18 verses 11 15
[19:57] and 19
[19:58] they read and the merchants of the earth
[20:00] shall weep and mourn over her for no man
[20:02] buyeth their merchandise anymore the
[20:05] merchants of these things which were
[20:07] made rich by her shall stand afar off
[20:09] for the fear of her torment weeping and
[20:12] wailing
[20:13] and they cast dust on their heads and
[20:14] cried weeping and wailing saying alas
[20:17] alas that great city wherein were made
[20:20] rich all that had ships in the sea by
[20:22] reason of her costliness for in one hour
[20:24] is she made desolate
[20:27] the weeping and mourning of these verses
[20:29] is when the vatican is destroyed and
[20:31] brother brahm told us this would happen
[20:33] through russia bombing the vatican with
[20:35] thus saith the lord this weeping wailing
[20:37] and mourning then would take place
[20:38] during the second half of the seven year
[20:40] great tribulation period
[20:45] as i conclude this section about the
[20:46] nine scripture witnesses a weeping
[20:48] wailing and gnashing of teeth i hope you
[20:50] can see how there's now three instances
[20:53] of weeping wailing and gnashing of teeth
[20:55] the foolish virgins will have to weep
[20:57] whale and gnash their teeth during the
[20:59] first half of the seven years of great
[21:01] tribulation
[21:02] and the sinners who take the mark of the
[21:03] beast
[21:04] will have weeping wailing and gnashing
[21:06] of teeth
[21:07] during the last half of the great
[21:08] tribulation period and also as jesus
[21:10] mentions in the lake of fire
[21:13] quotes from brother branham about
[21:15] weeping wailing and gnashing of teeth
[21:18] friends like numerous subjects within
[21:20] the ministry of william branham the
[21:22] foolish virgin has quotes on both sides
[21:25] just as you have quotes on both sides
[21:26] about the daniel 70 weeks some people
[21:29] think there's only three and a half
[21:31] years left others think there are seven
[21:33] years
[21:34] i believe there are seven years left in
[21:35] daniel's 70 weeks
[21:37] and again i could be wrong
[21:39] but i've written about it in my 2021
[21:41] book and
[21:42] and i'm looking forward to anyone trying
[21:43] to contact me and help me understand if
[21:45] i'm wrong
[21:46] the first quote i'll start with is the
[21:47] one wherein brother branham says the man
[21:50] with the wedding garment was lost and
[21:52] went to hell this is from questions and
[21:54] answers on the seals 1963.
[21:57] so this is a quote on the side that i
[21:58] would disagree with
[22:00] because i believe according to context
[22:01] the man without the wedding garment was
[22:03] cast in the tribulation period but i
[22:05] believe he could still be saved as
[22:06] you'll see brother branham also agrees
[22:08] with in other quotes
[22:10] so let's listen to this quote from 1963.
[22:13] brother brahms greetings in the name of
[22:16] the lord jesus please explain
[22:18] who the man in matthew 22 11
[22:23] the man that didn't have on a wedding
[22:26] garment
[22:26] wedding garment on i know this man
[22:30] could
[22:31] couldn't get into
[22:33] heaven without the wedding garment on
[22:36] this was a guest i know
[22:39] not the bride
[22:41] yes that's right
[22:44] he would be again yeah he just slipped
[22:45] in see now look
[22:48] now
[22:49] i i did take a whole sermon on that now
[22:51] i got 10 minutes to pray for to sit and
[22:53] finish this out
[22:54] and i've got one half of them done again
[22:57] that was but i'm going to hurry right
[22:58] back to this
[23:03] now this man had come by some
[23:06] organization
[23:08] back at the window over here some
[23:10] slipping hole and he got into the table
[23:12] and sat down and then when the
[23:14] bridegroom comes up and looks around his
[23:16] uh he
[23:17] these have been objects before now he's
[23:19] the
[23:20] octo what you're doing here like that
[23:23] without the baptism of the holy ghost
[23:24] and all these things
[23:27] how did you ever get in here
[23:29] well uh he come in somewhere besides the
[23:31] door and he come without the proper
[23:34] invitation okay
[23:37] he calmed by some educational system
[23:41] they hear something like that he got in
[23:44] and he said to him find him
[23:46] hand and feet
[23:48] cast him out of here in the outer
[23:50] darkness
[23:51] where there will be weeping and wailing
[23:52] in national teeth
[23:54] he went into the tribulation period
[23:57] he did not come in by the door so all
[24:00] right
[24:03] now let's look at the other side where
[24:05] brother branham says the man with the
[24:06] wedding garment could be saved at the
[24:08] white throne judgment if he gave his
[24:10] life as a martyr during the tribulation
[24:12] period
[24:13] the first one is from the patmos vision
[24:15] december 4th 1960. here brother braham
[24:18] said the foolish virgin would go into
[24:19] the great tribulation period
[24:21] and also called it outer darkness where
[24:23] there would be weeping wailing and
[24:25] gnashing of teeth
[24:27] it's important to note that this was the
[24:29] evening service in the morning service
[24:31] brother branham said the sleeping virgin
[24:33] or foolish virgin would be saved even
[24:35] though they had to endure weeping
[24:37] wailing and gnashing of teeth in other
[24:39] words on the same sunday in which
[24:41] brother adam preached two sermons in the
[24:43] morning he said the foolish virgin was
[24:45] saved and then the evening service said
[24:47] the foolish virgin would have to endure
[24:48] weeping wailing and gnashing of teeth
[24:51] let's listen to the first quote
[24:53] brother venom
[24:55] are the five foolish virgins of matthew
[24:57] 25
[24:59] counted as the gentile remnant
[25:02] i understand that the five foolish
[25:05] virgins were saved
[25:07] but had to go through the great
[25:10] tribulation period
[25:12] is this correct if so
[25:15] what will be their final destination
[25:18] could they be the sheep which are
[25:20] divided from the goats in matthew 25 33
[25:24] and 34.
[25:26] pretty good theologian according to what
[25:28] i have
[25:30] think of too
[25:31] that they are the remnant
[25:33] the sleeping virgin
[25:35] is the remnant spoke of in revelation
[25:38] of the woman's seed
[25:40] that keeps the commandments of god and
[25:41] have the testimony of jesus christ
[25:43] a woman will take a a piece of goods and
[25:45] lay it down
[25:47] well now that is what she's cutting her
[25:49] uh
[25:50] takes her pattern and lays anywhere she
[25:53] desires which way she's going to cut
[25:55] that and then what she has left over is
[25:57] called the remnant
[25:59] but
[26:00] she chooses to cut it from a certain
[26:02] place by her own
[26:04] free thinking
[26:06] but what's left over is called the
[26:07] remnant
[26:08] now if you notice there were five
[26:11] foolish and five wise virgins
[26:14] all of them as virgins made all the same
[26:16] material
[26:17] but by election
[26:20] god chose his bride by election before
[26:23] the foundation of the world
[26:26] put their names on the lamb's book of
[26:27] life slain before the foundation of the
[26:29] world before the world ever began
[26:32] god in his mind in infinite
[26:37] so then the foolish virgin was the one
[26:41] who did not have oil in her lamp that i
[26:43] believe that was cast out in the outer
[26:45] darkness whether it be weeping wedding
[26:47] and as you can see you think you'll
[26:48] compare that or your footnotes write
[26:51] right back again to the great
[26:52] tribulation now i think they're the ones
[26:54] that stays back and goes through the
[26:56] great tribulation quite a lesson there
[26:58] we had time to go into it
[27:03] now
[27:04] back to this remnant before we leave the
[27:06] question i hope i get it clear
[27:09] this uh
[27:10] i truly believe that the remnant
[27:13] is chosen by god
[27:16] i i believe it that god chose the
[27:20] remnant before the foundation of the
[27:22] world
[27:23] and has by his poor knowledge
[27:29] now let's listen to the second quote
[27:31] that brother branham spoke earlier in
[27:33] the morning service in the sermon called
[27:35] the revelation of jesus christ
[27:37] here he said the sleeping virgin or
[27:39] foolish virgin were saved yet they had
[27:41] weeping wailing and gnashing of teeth
[27:43] let's listen to the
[27:47] it be a quote
[27:48] time for the jews who rejected him as
[27:51] messiah but it'd be a mournful time for
[27:53] them left gentiles back here who has
[27:55] accepted who has rejected him as their
[27:58] messiah
[28:00] they'll be wailing and weeping the
[28:02] sleeping virgin will be wailing that's
[28:05] that church that refused to get oral in
[28:07] his life
[28:08] there were ten virgins went out all good
[28:10] people but five of them had oral in
[28:13] their land
[28:14] the other five were good people good
[28:17] people but failed to get oral in their
[28:20] land
[28:21] and they were cast down into outer
[28:22] darkness where to be weeping wailing and
[28:24] gnashing of teeth
[28:25] here it is they'll be wailing the bible
[28:28] says you're they'll be wailing and so
[28:31] broken-hearted
[28:32] until even
[28:35] just like the virgin the word virgin is
[28:37] pure holy i'm adultery thank you bye
[28:40] five head on five did not follow the
[28:42] field and
[28:50] now you can be saved without being
[28:52] sanctified you can be thanked if i have
[28:54] not had the holy ghost
[28:56] all right
[29:01] and notice he says you could be saved
[29:03] without being sanctified that'd be the
[29:04] foolish virgin who just had the
[29:06] anointing of faith and then he also said
[29:08] you can be sanctified and not have the
[29:09] holy ghost in other words you could have
[29:11] faith virtue knowledge temperance
[29:13] patience godliness brotherly kindness
[29:15] and still not have charity which is the
[29:17] baptism of the holy ghost which is also
[29:19] the capping of the building of god or
[29:22] your vessel or your being
[29:25] next let's look at two quotes from 1961.
[29:28] in the first one from god being
[29:30] misunderstood brother branham is asked
[29:32] now were the five of the virgins lost
[29:36] brother ram says they were not lost he
[29:38] said they had to suffer persecution and
[29:40] be martyred so this is why i believe the
[29:42] man who didn't have the wedding garment
[29:44] could be cast into outer darkness suffer
[29:47] be martyred but still be saved at the
[29:49] white throne judgment let's listen to
[29:51] the quote
[29:52] now
[29:55] were the five of the virgins
[29:58] lost
[29:59] i presume that they are
[30:02] asking the questions the five virgins
[30:05] the five wise and the five foolish now
[30:08] if you were with us
[30:10] in the last teachings in revelations
[30:13] you find out there that those virgins
[30:16] the
[30:18] the five
[30:20] foolish virgins were not lost
[30:23] but they were not permitted to go into
[30:26] the
[30:26] wedding supper
[30:28] but they suffered
[30:30] persecution
[30:32] and was martyred and raised again as the
[30:35] general resurrection in the last days
[30:37] those are the people where he separated
[30:40] the sheep from the goats
[30:43] see they stood before judgment
[30:47] here's the second quote
[30:49] from questions and answers 1961 october
[30:52] 15th the morning service brother bran
[30:54] plainly said the foolish virgins will be
[30:56] saved at the white throne judgment let's
[30:58] listen to the quote
[31:01] i see brother what happens to the people
[31:03] that are
[31:05] are considered the sleeping virgin when
[31:08] they are judged at the judgment well
[31:12] the sleeping virgin will be saved of
[31:14] course should be saved at the gentleman
[31:16] she'll never be the bride but she is a
[31:18] saved group of people that will come in
[31:20] the judgment that will not be included
[31:23] in the bride but as long as they are
[31:25] virgins they are before god see they are
[31:27] to be saved he separates they'll be the
[31:29] sheep on his right side and the unsaved
[31:32] will be the goats on his leg at the
[31:34] great white throne judgment extend a lot
[31:36] of time on that but
[31:37] it's getting a little late
[31:41] in closing
[31:43] friends i hope this video has been a
[31:45] blessing this video was actually
[31:47] recommended to me by a wonderful brother
[31:48] in the lord named brother russ
[31:51] so i want to thank you brother russ for
[31:52] suggesting this topic
[31:54] i'm sure it will help numerous people
[31:56] and hope you're able to share it with
[31:57] those who had questions about this
[31:58] subject friends as brother branham said
[32:01] this is quite a lesson
[32:02] the bible is a deep eternal book we
[32:05] should be constantly seeking god for
[32:06] more of the same revelation brother
[32:09] branham talked about in the church age
[32:10] book god cannot give a different
[32:12] revelation he gives one revelation but
[32:14] then he gives more information about the
[32:16] same revelation
[32:18] that's what we're seeing today here we
[32:19] are 56 years after brother brown left
[32:21] this scene but more scriptures are being
[32:23] given to us as more information from the
[32:25] holy ghost
[32:26] so we can understand the wise and
[32:28] foolish virgins so we can understand the
[32:30] purple curtain so we can understand the
[32:32] stature of perfect man the correct way
[32:35] and all these other wonderful subjects
[32:37] including all the mysteries of god as
[32:39] revelation 10 verse 7 says the mystery
[32:42] of god should be finished in this last
[32:43] day
[32:45] i'll close by saying friends let's
[32:46] redeem the time the wise virgin redeems
[32:49] the time devote more of your time to
[32:51] prayer bible study
[32:53] seeking the face of god through prayer
[32:55] and surely god will honor your faith and
[32:57] baptize your soul with his holy ghost
[33:00] the rapture is more near than ever
[33:02] before and the bride is making herself
[33:04] ready right now and let's remember to
[33:06] pray for our lost loved ones let's
[33:08] remember to pray for the foolish virgins
[33:10] as abraham prayed for lot if god honored
[33:13] abraham's prayer for lot and lot was
[33:15] saved then surely he's the same
[33:17] yesterday today and forever and god will
[33:19] honor our prayers and we'll see some of
[33:21] our lost loved ones be saved they'll
[33:24] become foolish virgins by the grace of
[33:26] god
[33:27] and hopefully some become wise virgins
[33:29] as well
[33:31] if you have any questions concerns or
[33:33] testimonies about this video please
[33:35] contact
[33:36] me god bless you and may jesus christ be
[33:40] the desire of your heart
