========================================
restoring christian modesty god's perfect will for your outward appearance written by jesse smith read by jesse smith copyright 2019 jesse smith bride of christ ministries incorporated introduction the introduction contains footnotes one through three are long dresses part of your religion i see all of your daughters are wearing them a sales associate asked me recently i was so happy to receive her respectful question about our personal convictions yes we believe men and women should wear separate garments as god taught israel in deuteronomy 22 verse 5. thinking on this exchange i really appreciated the manner in which this person asked about our clothing choices in my 16 years of following the bible's standard of separate garments for men and women i have had very few people ask why i hold this conviction most people including myself and my own family and friends seem to be uncomfortable addressing others faith-based convictions especially out in public not long after this friendly encounter i felt a great burden to write this book so i could clearly and fully explain what god's word teaches about a modest outward appearance i have approached this book in the same manner as the sales associate approached me with kindness and respect i realize that most people have been raised unaware of god's standards for a sanctified life when a person watches one of my teaching videos on youtube or reads this book it is likely that he or she is hearing this truth of god for the first time therefore i take the responsibility of presenting god's unchanging truth very seriously if you can receive god's requirements for holiness as taught in this book major changes will certainly take place in your life the changes will not be as difficult if you can sense the goodness of god that has brought you to the knowledge of holiness for it is god's goodness that leads us to repentance i want to present god's standards for our outward appearance with a biblical and historical foundation so you have assurance of the perfect will of god for your life jesus is the word of god and our rock when you believe god's words about living a holy life and apply them to your life you can be certain you are pleasing god and building your life upon the rock the eternal infallible unchanging word of god keep your bible handy as you read through this book as i will reference hundreds of scriptures you will be delighted to read with your own eyes all that god's word teaches about this subject i desire that you'll know and obey god's perfect will for your outward appearance at the conclusion of this book may you be a willing participant in god's restoration of christian modesty i plan to revisit the sales associate so i can hand her a free copy of this finished book you are holding in your hands chapter 1 a biblical foundation for your outward appearance chapter 1 contains footnotes numbers 4 through 89 but as he which hath called you is holy so be ye holy in all manner of conversation first peter 1 verse 15 the word of god is our foundation the biblical foundation for the doctrine of holiness in appearance begins with the word of god forever settled in heaven it is so enduring that heaven and earth will pass away while god's words can never pass away jesus christ taught that every detail of the word would be fulfilled scriptural knowledge makes us wise unto salvation and is profitable for doctrine reproof correction and instruction in righteousness when we read the bible with a hungry heart the holy spirit reveals god's perfect will for every area of our lives even our outward appearance the word delivers a standard of truth that transcends ages generations and societies because god's holy nature is always the same and does not change god's standards or rules for outward appearance have remained unchanged from genesis 3 verse 21 to revelation 22 verse 21 you and i can have confidence that this standard is the same today as it was for adam and eve the new testament gospel that christ gave to paul will be used to judge the secrets of men's hearts on the day of judgment humanity will not be judged by any denomination's understanding but rather by god's own revelation of his word since the word of god is the standard for judgment you must diligently seek god until he reveals this true interpretation of the bible to your heart you must also apply the many thoughts in the bible correctly to your life recall that even satan quoted the word of god to jesus at his three temptations in the wilderness but satan's applications were always rooted in idolatry unbelief or pride you should study every word in the bible and pray for god's understanding of scripture and its application to your life the rightly divided word of truth the savior taught that you are to live by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of god if you must live by every word of god you must know how portions of scripture pertain to you thankfully god promised to send men who are gifted with five different but complementary preaching gifts to bring unity to the faith and bring believers to a state of spiritual completion additionally paul stated that gifted preachers would be able to rightly divide god's word to his people true gospel preaching and teaching will save the preacher and those that believe him i pray that the lord jesus would use my teaching gift to rightly divide god's truth to you in this often misunderstood area of outward appearance i am simply teaching what the holy spirit has taught me privately and what faithful men have taught me over the years in accordance with second timothy 2 verse 2 and the things that thou has heard of me among many witnesses the same commit thou to faithful men who shall be able to teach others also knowing the rightly divided word of god isn't enough we need obedience to it in matthew 7 verses 24 through 29 our lord jesus taught that obedience to the word of god is the foundation on which our lives should rest those who do the commands of god will have a life able to withstand any trial in contrast jesus then revealed that those who disobey god's word are in danger of falling from truth when the storms came the predicted falling away the bible actually predicted a global falling away from obedience to the word of god before the antichrist would be revealed in the end days other portions of scripture support this prophecy that obedience to the word of god would continually decrease and obedient christians would become a very small minority based upon these prophecies you would expect the majority of those claiming to be christians would not honor god's word in many areas of biblical doctrine but would fall away from the truth of the bible in relation to modest clothing holiness and appearance and hair length among other things you cannot call your creator lord if you do not obey his word though there are many who will honor god with their lips and yet their hearts will be far from him run from that group and join the faithful obedient and diligent followers of the holy scripture our lord jesus christ asked a very pointed question in luke 6 46 that you must ask yourself today and why call ye me lord lord and do not the things which i say your heart should answer this question by saying dear jesus my obedience to your commands proves you are truly my lord what is holiness a life of holiness is a state of constant obedience to god's word the greek lexicon describes holiness as consecration purification sanctification of heart and life scripture describes a holy life as living without any sin or filthiness in body and mind your calling from god is to perfect holiness in reverential fear or respect of almighty god in broad terms holiness includes every action in life the focus of this book is conforming your outward appearance to god's standard for holiness chapter 3 covers god's four guidelines for modest clothing chapter 4 teaches you how long hair should be if you want to live a life of holiness unto god chapter 5 examines whether makeup tattoos jewelry high heels and earrings are holy in the sight of god god requires holiness god requires his new testament followers to be holy or set apart from sinful behaviors and lifestyles our entire lives should be wholly devoted to serving and pleasing our god scripture literally states our purpose that we should be holy and without blame before him our god required holiness or a separated lifestyle in the old testament and also requires it today in the new testament first peter 1 verses 15 and 16 instructs us to be holy in all manner of conversation which in the greek means manner of life conduct and behavior peter was quoting the old testament scriptures from leviticus 11 verses 44 and 45 and 20 verse 7 making us aware that many of god's principles of the old testament are still in effect today chapter 2 explores this concept in depth god requires holiness because he purchased us with the precious blood of his son jesus christ he is the god of the living and dead and earned the right to be our lord or ruler over every soul through the sacrifice of his son on the cross of calvary paul said we are holy temples or tabernacles if you will not submit to your creator and become holy god will destroy you living a holy life is an important issue and should be on the minds of anyone serious about loving and serving a holy god every man and woman has been given a conscience for the purpose of moral perception which is to understand if something is right or wrong when you truly believe in and accept the sacrifice of jesus christ in your life you can now experience a clean pure conscience that is free from corruption and fully devoted to the service of god thereby you can perceive you are justified from your sins and living right before your creator how we become holy the process of becoming holy or separated from the world is plainly taught in numerous new testament passages paul wrote that jesus sanctifies and cleanses his church with the washing of water by the word followers of christ are washed by the word as they lay apart all filthiness and receive the word of god the key to your washing is to voluntarily lay aside all sin and do the will of god peter wrote that we purify our souls through obedience to the word of god obedience can only occur when you die to your own will and do the will of god as taught by jesus's submission in gethsemane conversely a soul that will not obey the spirit of god is known as subverted unstable and ultimately lost being sanctified unto god completely and holy is the absolute will of god for all believers to do the will of god is god working in us to do his good pleasure to reject the will of god is to become a worker of iniquity without holiness no man shall see the lord holiness is beautiful psalm 96 verse 9 teaches that we should worship the lord in the beauty of holiness o worship the lord in the beauty of holiness fear before him all the earth it is strengthening to know that god sees holy living as beautiful and as an act of true worship hollywood false religions and the world will never see god's holiness standards as attractive or beautiful so we do not expect the world to fall in love with modesty but we can rest assured that the same god who called us to be holy is the same god who looks down upon his obedient children and sees their character conduct and clothing as beautiful in his sight jesus christ is the very epitome of beauty not because of his attractive appearance or clothing but because of his holy sinless lifestyle and character some artists represent jesus as having an attractive face shiny hair and elegant robes but this idea is completely contrary to isaiah's description of christ when he said there is no beauty that we should desire him jesus's character was beautiful because he always did that which pleased the father christians who live holy have the same attitude for paul wrote that we have the same mind of christ your life is beautiful in god's sight when you apply christ's attitude to your life satan often disguises his temptations by using beauty satan's own beauty lifted up his heart and pride against god and led to his being cast out of heaven cain tried to offer a more beautiful sacrifice than abel's but his offering was rejected those who want to appear beautiful to the world standards today must take heed that they do not repeat the same prideful and devilish mistake as satan promoting your beauty has a strong tendency to lead you away from god's standard of beauty proverbs 31 verse 30 tells us that beauty is vain and the most valuable possession we can have is the fear of the lord which causes us to hate evil when you hate evil and abstain from it you are holy and beautiful in god's sight love is the greatest motivator many people consider standards for holy living as legalism however a true understanding of legalism will help you know the difference between an unhealthy legalistic attitude driven by fear versus a healthy obedient attitude driven by love love is the greatest and only motivation needed for the believer to meet god's requirement for a holy life obedience is accepted by god when love is its motivation first corinthians chapter 13 teaches that love is the greatest of all gifts miracles knowledge and understanding all mysteries do not profit believers unless they have the love of god in their hearts as their motivation for every action or work love empowers faith which then produces works always obey god in the correct order love faith works in saint john chapter 14 the lord jesus teaches that love is the only accepted motivation for obedience in the sight of god in four separate verses jesus teaches that love will cause a true believer to keep the commands of god you are known as a lover of god if you keep the sayings of jesus the earthly life of the lord jesus christ epitomized obeying the commandments of god based upon love jesus loved the father and knew he always pleased him because he never disobeyed one command despite being tempted in every way jesus's love for the father empowered him to love his neighbors as himself fulfilling all the law of god legalism one definition of legalism is excessive adherence to law or formula meaning that the legalist standard is more than necessary legalism then in christianity is adding some requirement to the bible that god does not require there are grave consequences to adding requirements to the bible proverbs says add thou not unto his words lest he reprove thee and thou be found a liar revelation says plagues will be added to those who add to the book and those who take away will have their heavenly inheritance taken away god's pure words are sufficient for our complete earthly journey god's standards for holiness are not legalism since no requirements have been added to the bible paul specifically denounced legalism concerning the doctrine of circumcision teaching that requiring circumcision in the new testament would be a fall from grace paul's encounter with men who taught circumcision was required for salvation led the apostles to have a counsel about the matter concluding that gentiles were not required to be circumcised this pattern should be followed today when believers sense a legalistic teaching may be creeping into the body of christ elders or leaders of the church should gather together to pray and search the scripture in order to provide a clear concise biblical answer to the teaching in question they should also prayerfully seek out wisdom from other seasoned ministers and come to a bible-based conclusion modesty the term modesty will show up often in this book and is a command of god i use this word to focus on the clothing that we wear on our bodies the context of this term comes from a scripture about apparel in 1st timothy 2 9. in like manner also that women adorn themselves in modest apparel with shamefaceness and sobriety the greek definition of modesty is well arranged to clarify modesty a modern definition is showing regard for the decencies of behavior speech dress when you dress modestly you are not drawing attention to your own body instead you redirect attention away from your body by wearing clothes which cover areas of nakedness chapter 3 thoroughly explains the four bible guidelines for covering the parts of the body that god considers nakedness the beginning and ending of modest clothing genesis the book of beginnings is where we see the beginning of modest clothing before their fall unto sin adam and eve were both naked and unashamed immediately after eve was deceived into sinning by the serpent she gave the forbidden fruit to adam and he willingly sinned by partaking of it with her sensing the shame of their nakedness for the first time adam and eve sewed fig leaves together to cover their nakedness with aprons the hebrew lexicon defines apron as a loin covering loincloth loins refer to the reproductive parts around the area of the hips it is crucial to observe that adam and eve covered only their private parts or loins later god himself visited adam and eve and gave them coats of skins the hebrew lexicon defines a co as a long shirt-like garment like a tunic that covers from the breast down nearly to the feet here we see god as the originator of modest clothing and adam and eve as the originators of immodest clothing adam and eve at first chose to cover only the loins but god chose to cover nearly the entire body including the breasts abdomen and thighs god's choice of clothing required more covering than adam and eve's choice proving that god will always require more than the sinful human mind thinks that god requires the ending of modest clothing or last reference to it is found in the book of revelation white robes are the clothing that god chooses for his believers as they worship the lamb around the throne of god in revelation 7 verses 9 to 17. the greek lexicon defines these white robes as a loose outer garment extending to the feet what a beautiful picture of god's people worshiping him in the beauty of holiness wearing modest white robes that extend to their feet you can rest assured that god's unending eternal plan for your outward appearance is modest clothing today is like the days of noah it has become fashionable for women to dress immodestly or like harlots jesus christ prophesied of these immoral conditions when he said that the days of his second coming would be like the days of noah in noah's day the beautiful daughters of men were so attractive that the sons of god men in the godly lineage of adam and seth were intermarrying with these unbelieving women solely upon the basis of their beauty the daughters of men were unbelievers or they would have been called the daughters of god these weak compromising sons of god were just one more reason god said his spirit would not always strive with man and their failures helped usher in the judgment of the worldwide flood history is truly repeating itself young men and women who are raised in godly homes are stumbling over prospective unbelieving spouses who are immodestly dressed and marrying outside the faith of jesus christ the results of these ungodly unions are generations of disobedient faithless families our spiritual eyes should see that the same evil spirits which caused the beautiful daughters of men to draw away the sons of god in the days of noah are the same evil spirits causing men and women to stumble today because spirits do not die they just move from one believer to the next we are living in the days of the second coming of the son of man which mirror the days of noah the root of immodesty immodesty is caused by the power of darkness or the influence of evil spirits that cause women and men to unclothe their bodies and present themselves immodestly before the public as clearly written in scripture two notable bible examples demonstrate that evil spirits strip people of their clothing first evil spirits were credited with unclothing the man from gadara in luke 8 verses 26-35 after jesus had cast the legion of demons out of the delivered man he was then clothed and sat at the feet of jesus in his right mind a legion of demons stripped this poor man of his clothing but once those demons left he was soon fully clothed this illustrates that someone who dresses in modestly and reveals parts of their body that god considers nakedness is not in his or her right mind a second example is found in acts 19 verses 14 to 16. seven jewish sons of skiva were trying to cast out an evil spirit in the name of jesus but they were not believers in christ or did not have genuine faith in christ the evil spirit from the possessed man leaped on the sons overcame them and prevailed against them so much so that the seven sons fled out of the house naked and wounded the lesson is that evil spirits strip off clothing the power of the holy spirit causes us to dress modestly and keep the commandments of god scripture says the holy spirit quickens or makes alive the word of god to the believer and causes him to keep god's commands outward nakedness signals spiritual nakedness outward nakedness indicates spiritual nakedness when a woman yields to the influence of evil spirits and presents her body in a sexually attractive way before the public it is one outward sign of the inward nakedness of her soul this means that person is not born again she does not possess the spirit of jesus christ her soul is naked or absent of the spirit's abiding presence the bible calls this presence the seal of the holy ghost a believer who is truly born again of the holy ghost possesses the spirit of christ and his righteousness and is thereby clothed or endued with the power of god the soul of the born-again christian is clothed or dressed with power the holy ghost has written the word of god upon her heart the soul's clothing is an extremely important concept jesus christ's words to the church in laodicea pronounced the most harsh denunciation to any people in human history because of their naked souls those in laodicea were rich increased of goods had need of nothing but were naked and did not know it the laodiceans did not have to combat persecution poverty or any other life-threatening enemy they had only to battle riches and increase of goods and prosperity and yet they could not crucify the lust of the flesh lust of the eyes and pride of life therefore these laodiceans deserve the greatest rebuke of all time due to their love of the world this misplaced love proved their souls were not clothed with christ's righteousness we live in the exact same state as the laodiceans today having increased goods prosperity and riches but lacking spiritual power thankfully the lord jesus gave us the prescription on how to overcome the spirit of laodicea zealous repentance through communion with christ to zealously repent means to eagerly destroy any sinful habits with an intense motivation to obey jesus christ if you zealously repent christ will call you an overcomer and grant you a seat or throne near his own after genuine repentance your soul will be clothed with jesus's own righteousness the dangers of immodesty the dangers of immodesty include causing others to stumble and being taken captive to the will of evil spirits any individual who dresses immodestly and leads others to lust after his or her body is guilty of sinning against christ by leading others to stumble into sin scripture is clear about our responsibility to present our bodies in modest apparel for our bodies are living sacrifices unto god and temples of the holy ghost two important new testament texts teach us a great deal about our responsibility not to set a stumbling block in anyone's way romans 14 verses 12 through 23 and 1st corinthians 8 verses 7 through 13. in context of these scriptures the examples of the sins that cause others to stumble include eating meat sacrificed to idols and drinking wine while the sin of immodest clothing is not listed in these two particular texts it is listed in the following passages proverbs 7 verse 10 proverbs 6 verse 25 and matthew 5 verse 28 proverbs 7 verse 10 mentions the attire or clothing of a harlot this passage brings us to the obvious conclusion that harlots or prostitutes dress in a specific immodest way in order to tempt men to pay them for sexual sin the harlot's clothing or any woman's immodest clothing ignites a man's sexual passions like a lit match ignites spilled gasoline additionally consider the pure selfishness in a harlot or woman's heart to present herself immodestly for her own gain knowing she is weakening men's spiritual conditions and their marriages this level of selfishness is the complete opposite of the golden rule which encourages living for the benefit of others and putting their needs first therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you do ye even so to them leading others to stumble through sinful thoughts of lust is a serious danger proverbs warns that men must not lust after women in their minds and that women seduce men with seductive looks our lord jesus teaches that lusting in the heart is the same as committing the very act of adultery jesus's command to avoid lusting in our hearts is part of the gospel or good news those who do not hearken in repentance unto all of christ's words including his words about our thought lives will be destroyed on the day of judgment proverbs 7 verse 27 supports jesus's teaching as we read about harlots leading men to hell whether a man stumbles at the harlot's immodest clothing committing adultery in his heart or fulfills the act in the flesh he's in danger of destroying his soul clearly there may be times a woman cannot keep a lustful man from having evil thoughts about her even though she has dressed modestly in this case the woman is innocent if she follow god's command for modest clothing the person lusting is the only guilty one many men are so addicted to lust that they will fulfill their evil thoughts about a modestly dressed woman despite her efforts to honor god in our hyper-sexualized culture women are now becoming as lustful as men so it is increasingly important for both sexes to avoid inciting sexual passions by dressing modestly titus 1 verse 15 states that the pure and heart are not guilty of someone else's sin saying unto the pure all things are pure but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure but even their mind and conscience is defiled god's principle from genesis 18 verse 23 declares that he will not destroy the righteous with the wicked so you can rest assured that god will not hold you responsible for another person's lust if you are dressed modestly being taken captive by an evil spirit or trapped in addiction is another danger of immodest clothing addiction can take place only when a person willingly submits to the evil spirit by his or her own free will since the devil cannot make us do evil an addict is in a slave-like condition where he or she is under such a strong demonic influence that he or she regularly obeys an evil spirit and does not have the power or faith to obey christ's word jesus described this condition as being bound by a greater power and being spoiled from all godly possessions including joy faith hope love and other godly blessings being trapped in an addiction is commonly called captivity in scripture lust addicts live completely contrary to god's calling to be his children obeying fleshly sexual lust makes men and women resemble beasts rather than children of god beastly lustful behavior is responsible for many evils in society such as divorces pornography sexual violence and sexually transmitted diseases a sensual carnal lifestyle is proof that the holy spirit is absent from a person's life the only hope for an addicted individual is repentance which starts with confessing his sin and exposing the evil spirit in his life once the sin is confessed and forgiven by the blood of jesus christ satan's evil spirit no longer has the power or influence it once had the individual can now resist the devil or evil spirit with a righteous vengeance if a believer continually resists the temptation and stands faithful in obedience to god's word the evil spirit must flee from him according to the promise of god my experience with immodesty modest clothing holiness and appearance and god honoring hair length were certainly not a big part of my background while i have many reasons to be thankful for being raised in a home that attended a charismatic denominational church my siblings and i learned very little about modesty and holiness perhaps because my parents were not taught god's standards in these areas in the fall of 2001 as a 21 year old college student i first learned about god's standards for a holy appearance i quickly changed churches so i could hear more truth preached every service upon hearing and reading the bible truth about these subjects the bible felt like a new book to me by worshiping with new believers in a church that believed in god's modesty and holiness standards i quickly gained the understanding that god wanted all believers to walk according to the same rule or standard of investigating judging living and acting as i witnessed firsthand a group of spirit-led believers who wore modest clothes and kept holiness standards i immediately felt the presence of the holy ghost in a greater way than i'd ever felt before seeing other believers obey this higher level of modesty and holiness made me hunger to duplicate this same degree of dedication in my own life which jesus called a hunger and thirst for righteousness after months of persistent prayer and study the lord led me to make two major changes first i began to dress modestly at all times i stopped taking off my shirt to pridefully show off my upper body in the past i'd enjoyed undressing in order to get compliments and even heard females do the wolf whistle at me second the holy spirit led me to cut my hair which at the time resembled the mullet look as i wanted to honor the lord with my hair by making it look undoubtedly masculine i'd like to share a personal story from my childhood about the devastating effects that immodesty had upon my young mind which led to years of addiction to the spirit of lust as a child in sunday school i remember singing be careful little lies what you see but it seems i was almost powerless to overcome the temptation of immodestly dressed women when first presented with a temptation for certain i was unaware that the bible taught temptation would always come in three channels lust of the eyes lust of the flesh and pride of life my story begins when i was in grade school and one of my friends invited me to spend the night at his house while there we traded baseball cards but late into the night we started watching mtv with his older brother my eyes were glued to the screen as i witnessed music clothing and dancing i had never seen before those few moments had a lasting effect upon my mind when i returned home the next day those images of immodestly dressed women remained in my mind along with the explicitly sexual lyrics after a short time past our family was sitting down to enjoy our weekly ritual of watching the cosby show normally i was front and center of the television sure not to miss one second of the show i thought was the funniest of all but this night was different because of the immodest clothing and dancing i'd witnessed at my friend's house i was off in my bedroom all alone drawing women in bikinis on baseball cards the music dancing and immodest clothing of mtv had so captured my mind that i combined the new lustful images in my mind sexy clothing with my childhood hobby baseball card trading my mind was officially addicted to the spirit of lust at some point during the cosby show my mother walked into the room and asked me what i was doing instantly i felt ashamed and embarrassed and my mother confiscated my homemade baseball cards my mother was not one to purposely embarrass me but she would try to separate me from evil i have never forgotten this moment and now that i have a greater understanding of the bible and spiritual matters i can easily see how the spirit of lust entered and filled my mind through seeing immodestly dressed women on mtv as the years passed i would jump upon every opportunity to watch tv shows commercials or movies with immodestly dressed women the lustful images fill my mind and i let the stronger spirit of lust spoil the spiritual blessings from my mind and heart when i was in my late teens another friend introduced me to free pornographic material on the internet and i spent the next few years under a greater bondage to the lust of the eyes this addiction continued into my college years and i remember renting the library's laptops to write papers but spent substantial time on lustful websites by the grace of almighty god through much prayer bible study and hearing the preaching of the word of god i was given complete victory over the pornographic empire around 2002 and have never gone back the goodness of god brought me to true repentance and i confess my sin and shame to my heavenly father i remain ever grateful to god that he delivered me from this evil spirit of lust before i entered into my marriage covenant with my darling wife these memories of my childhood have created a strong desire my heart and soul to protect myself and my children from the evil spirits that promote immodest clothing and ultimately a sin slaved ungodly life while i am ashamed that i became addicted to the spirit of lust at eight years old i am eternally thankful that god has delivered me from this evil spirit and has given me the scriptures i needed to personally overcome this spirit and help others to do the same conclusion the word of god is the one and only foundation we need for our lives god wants us to live in a way that fulfills the holy purpose spelled out in scripture modesty matters to god's people because it is commanded christians recognize the short and long-term effects of immodesty and choose to cast down any and all of satan's lustful temptations that contradict the word of god although satan constantly exalts in modesty through the addictive spirit of lust god's promises provide every single spiritual blessing we need for our journey christians obtain these blessings by christ's own gift of faith using his faith we obey god's holy calling for a god-honoring outward appearance our consciences rest assured that god sees our lives as obedient and beautiful with the understanding that the eternal word of god is our sure foundation we can now learn how to apply scripture to our lives
