[0:12] greetings friends in the matches name of
[0:14] the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of
[0:17] this video is to present without bias
[0:19] what the Bible plainly teaches about
[0:22] homosexuality We Begin by stating from
[0:24] the outset that the King James Holy
[0:27] Bible is 100% against homosexual
[0:30] as we will show with nearly 50
[0:32] scriptures from the word of God there is
[0:35] not one scripture in the Bible that
[0:37] justifies gay marriage or any homosexual
[0:39] act despite what many teachers today may
[0:42] try to say Jesus Christ the son of God
[0:46] is the same yesterday today and forever
[0:49] and the Bible has the same judgment upon
[0:51] homosexuality throughout the entire
[0:53] Bible God was against homosexuality
[0:56] yesterday or in the past he is against
[0:59] it today day and he will always be
[1:01] against it because the act of
[1:03] homosexuality pridefully and unashamedly
[1:06] defies his design and perfect
[1:10] will please know that we are not
[1:12] engaging in hate speech we do not hate
[1:15] any homosexual person real Christians do
[1:18] not hate homosexuals nor does a real
[1:21] Christian condone any violence toward
[1:23] homosexuals we are not judging
[1:25] homosexuals and saying that we know for
[1:28] sure where they are going after after
[1:30] they die whether Heaven or Hell only God
[1:33] knows their Destinies but the Bible says
[1:36] a homosexual person who does not repent
[1:38] of their sin will not inherit the
[1:40] kingdom of God but also Liars murderers
[1:44] teachers of heresies adulterers
[1:47] fornicators and more will not inherit
[1:49] the kingdom of God if they do not repent
[1:51] of their sins so the main desire of a
[1:53] Christian is to lead people away from
[1:55] their sins into repentance and a new
[1:58] walk and a new life with the Lord Jesus
[2:01] Christ so our pure desire for this video
[2:04] is that it will lead Sinners to
[2:05] repentance I was so thankful when a
[2:07] preacher came and preached the truth to
[2:09] me that I could get delivered from my
[2:11] specific sins that I struggle with may
[2:14] God help us all to overcome sin to hate
[2:17] sin and love the righteousness of Jesus
[2:21] Christ Bible teaching on
[2:24] homosexuality concerning the topic of
[2:27] homosexuality the Bible is completely
[2:29] one-sided
[2:30] as the Bible condemns homosexuality and
[2:33] all those who partake of the ACT but it
[2:35] pleads with homosexuals and all Sinners
[2:38] to repent of all their
[2:39] sins the specific sin of homosexuality
[2:42] is condemned in the following two Old
[2:45] Testament scriptures and three new
[2:47] testament scriptures Leviticus
[2:49] 18:22 Leviticus
[2:52] 20:3 Romans chap 1:
[2:55] 26-32 1 Corinthians 6: 9-1 and 1 Timothy
[3:01] 1: 10 and 11 please understand that the
[3:04] pure words of the Bible describe the act
[3:06] of homosexuality as the
[3:09] following an Abomination or disgusting
[3:13] thing vile or disgraceful dishonorable
[3:18] shameful against nature or
[3:21] unnatural a lust or forbidden
[3:25] craving unseemly or shame of nakedness
[3:30] not convenient or
[3:33] unfit abusers of
[3:36] themselves wh mongers and them that
[3:39] defile themselves with
[3:43] mankind perhaps the most infamous group
[3:46] of homosexuals in the Bible were the
[3:48] people of Sodom and Gomorrah from The
[3:50] Book of Genesis chapters 18 and 19 these
[3:53] disobedient ones were destroyed by fire
[3:55] and brimstone from the Lord Out of
[3:57] Heaven according to Genesis
[4:00] 19:4 Sodom is spoken of 53 times in the
[4:04] Bible 12 times the Bible just mentions
[4:06] the literal name of the city and the
[4:08] name of the king of Sodom but 41 of 53
[4:12] times Sodom is spoken of deal with the
[4:15] sin and wickedness of Sodom and the
[4:17] condemnation that God brought upon those
[4:19] people because of the sin of
[4:23] homosexuality in the Old Testament the
[4:25] following Bible writers condemn Sodom
[4:28] and the act of homosexual ity
[4:32] Moses the writers of first and 2
[4:36] Kings the prophet
[4:39] Isaiah the prophet
[4:42] Ezekiel the prophet
[4:45] Amos the prophet
[4:49] Zephaniah in the New Testament the
[4:51] following Bible writers condemn Sodom
[4:53] and the act of
[4:55] homosexuality the Lord Jesus Christ
[5:00] St
[5:02] Paul St
[5:05] Peter St
[5:08] Jude and St
[5:11] John based upon this Bible examination
[5:15] which group of preachers will you stand
[5:16] with today will you stand with the
[5:18] preachers and Prophets who wrote the
[5:20] Bible and condemned the act of
[5:23] homosexuality or will you stand with
[5:25] many of the modern day preachers today
[5:28] that say homosexuality is acceptable
[5:30] unto God and yet God never commissioned
[5:33] these modern-day preachers to do
[5:35] Miracles and prophesy or write the Bible
[5:38] like the other Old Testament and New
[5:40] Testament Bible
[5:42] writers as for me in my house in our
[5:45] church we will believe the Bible and the
[5:47] men God commissioned to write his
[5:49] eternal unchanging words of truth
[5:52] homosexuality was and still is a sin
[5:55] according to the Eternal unchanging word
[5:57] of God
[5:59] Jesus is teaching about
[6:03] homosexuality I have heard it preached
[6:05] before that Jesus never addressed the
[6:07] issue of homosexuality in the four
[6:10] gospels and so according to these
[6:12] preachers Jesus must have supported
[6:15] homosexuality we believe that is a false
[6:17] interpretation while it may be true
[6:19] Jesus never directly referenced Old
[6:21] Testament scriptures about homosexuality
[6:24] such as Leviticus 18:22 and
[6:28] 20:3 Jesus did directly mention the
[6:31] people of Sodom and Gomorrah as we
[6:33] presented earlier in Matthew 10:15
[6:35] Matthew 11:23 and 24 Mark 6:11 Luke 17:
[6:42] 24-36 and Luke
[6:44] 10:12 each time he mentioned the people
[6:47] of Sodom it was in the context of the
[6:49] day of judgment which Associated
[6:52] sodomite Behavior with God's
[6:55] Wrath Jesus also connected the increase
[6:58] of homosexuality directly with the end
[7:00] of the world and his second coming which
[7:03] we will teach more on later in this
[7:05] video we must also point out that Jesus
[7:08] indirectly addressed the issue of
[7:10] homosexuality because each time Jesus
[7:12] taught on marriage his emphasis was upon
[7:15] marriage between a man and a woman
[7:18] Jesus's teaching on marriage always
[7:19] supported the Genesis account of God's
[7:22] original design for marriage one man and
[7:25] one woman Jesus's main emphasis was to
[7:28] try and take the people back to the
[7:30] beginning Adam and Eve male and female
[7:34] no divorce lifelong commitment and
[7:37] powered by God himself according to
[7:39] Matthew 19: 1-12 and Matthew 5:
[7:43] [Music]
[7:45] 27-32 before we move on WE recall that
[7:48] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[7:50] and forever according to Hebrews 13:8 so
[7:53] if Jesus supported only marriage between
[7:55] a man and a woman yesterday 2,000 years
[7:57] ago then today he would only support the
[8:00] same Union and he will forever support
[8:03] the same
[8:03] [Music]
[8:09] Union if you would like more Bible
[8:11] teaching about homosexuality and also
[8:14] prayer for deliverance from this
[8:15] temptation please contact us God bless
[8:19] you and may Jesus Christ be the desire
[8:22] of your heart
[8:25] [Music]
