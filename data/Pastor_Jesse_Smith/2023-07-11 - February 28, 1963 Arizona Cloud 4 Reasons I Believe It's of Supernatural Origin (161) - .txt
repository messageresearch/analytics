TRANSCRIPT
========================================
greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to give a brief summary of why I believe the mysterious Arizona cloud from February 28 1963 was of Supernatural origin and I'm making this video at the request of a viewer previously on April 22nd 2022 I put a short six minute segment about the Arizona cloud in my 107th video called the round bear Vision was a conditional promise plus brief responses to other accusations and this segment is around the 54 minute and 40 second mark I'll add this six minute segment to the end of this video as this first part of the video will be a brief summary of the content so it's a little more organized I'll begin with four reasons why I believe the cloud was of a supernatural origin first brother Branham had a reputation as a faithful Bible teacher friends I've been a Christian since about the year 2000 and I've never heard a man Teach so much Bible truth which has led to so much Revelation from the Holy Spirit as brother William Branham I've been listening to brother Branham since the year 2002 and I've been preaching his Revelations from God and Bible teachings since 2004 and I continue to teach the Bible revelations God gave to brother Branham to this day of course there are numerous minor doctrines brother Adam taught or may have believed that may or may not be correct but on brother Ram's major doctrines he was completely correct and then he would speak thus saith the Lord that they were correct and we know they're right because they're true according to the Bible the sad part is many of other brands accusers don't even listen to brother Brandon's sermons with an honest heart they don't hear him pleading with Sinners to repent and give their lives to Jesus Christ for 15 or 30 or 45 minutes they don't hear brother Brandon weeping and rejoicing and giving God praise when Sinners get saved they only listen to criticize brother Branham which I believe is a sin that they're committing I cannot over emphasize the importance of brother branham's Bible revelations that he taught us they've influenced my entire life they've transformed my life have made over 160 videos about brother Brandon's Bible teachings and also written two books about brother Brands Bible teachings brother Ram's preaching about the Bible and Bible teachings has made the Bible a brand new Bible to me because I was raised in the Assembly of God denomination my entire life and the Bible made no sense but as soon as I heard brother Adam's Revelations the Bible finally made sense and God showed me his power and Revelation through the word of God which brother Brandon preached ultimately all the credit goes to the Holy Ghost of course because as brother Adam said no man can interpret the word of God Jesus Christ has to interpret God's word and then reveal it to the prophets which God did God revealed it to brother Branham in our day the second reason I believe the cloud was of Supernatural origin is because brother random gave two prophecies about the cloud and he prophesied according to the vision that God gave him about the seven angels and he prophesied on December 30th 1962 and January 14 1963 saying the Visions were in the name of the Lord and you can hear those quotes towards the end of this video third reason I believe the cloud was of Supernatural origin is because of Bill rostrand's scientific evidence bill rostran is a message believer I believe from South Carolina if I'm not mistaken I've never met him but he has almost six hours of Bible teaching and also scientific facts proving the cloud was made by a supernatural origin and the fourth reason I believe the cloud was of Supernatural origin is because of the supernatural revelation of the Seven Seals that God gave to brother Branham brother Ram's accuser say brother random plagiarizes Seven Seals that is utter nonsense I don't know how they can say that with a straight face I have videos proving all Seven Seals brother random taught were revealed to him by the Holy Ghost and there are over 38 differences between brother rand's Revelations on the Seven Seals and Clarence Larkin Charles Taze Russell and Uriah Smith's teachings on the Seven Seals and Friends there's even more than 38 differences because with each of the seals brother man's accusers only compared brother Rand to one of those Bible teachers and not the other two moving on now I want to share four additional points about the cloud topic that need to be addressed first this case is ultimately brother Ram's accuser's word against brother branham's word and brother Brandon is not here to share his side of this discussion and remember friends government data and records are not infallible according to Matthew chapter 4 and Jesus Satan is in charge ultimately of every government so how can we make government records or NASA records or any government records infallible of course any honest person will agree with that government records are not infallible and remember friends brother M's accusers were not there on February 28 1963 in Arizona to witness firsthand that the cloud was formed by a Thor rocket they're just taking someone else's word for it they were not eyewitnesses the second point is that brother Braham never said with thus saith the Lord he was under the cloud on February 28 1963. of course the record show he was probably in Texas I believe pleading for a young man's life to be spared but whether he was there or in Texas or some other location it doesn't matter because brother Branham never said thus saith the Lord I was under the cloud third point is that brother Branham could have been under the cloud by vision and that happened to Ezekiel in Ezekiel 8 verse 15 of course I've been criticized and kind of made fun of just for saying this could be a possibility but if we're Believers in the Bible and Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and it's very possible brother random could have been in Texas and had a vision and he could have been transported by Vision to be under the cloud that's what happened to Ezekiel Ezekiel was sitting in his house in chaldea which was probably over 100 miles away from Jerusalem and he was translated in the vision from chaudia to Jerusalem the fourth and final point is that brother bran did not say cloud before the event happened we admit that but brother random called the cloud a snow white pyramid on December 30th 1962 and of course any honest person would admit the cloud looks like a snow white pyramid so by God's grace now I'll play the six minute segment previously released on April 22nd 2022 it covers a lot of the same information I just stated but I wanted to State those facts in a more organized way of course there's probably more questions about the cloud but I believe these four reasons and then the Four Points about the cloud experience are enough to prove to any honest person that the cloud was of a supernatural origin so if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me and friends it's easiest to contact me through my email address so here's the six minute segment from April 22nd 2022 God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart the February 28 1963 Arizona cloud again this case is ultimately brother Ram's word against brother Adam's accusers words brother Ram's accusers cannot fully prove with absolute certainty that the cloud was formed by a rocket they try to make their data and paperwork and absolute but that doesn't mean it is also I cannot prove that the cloud was formed by seven angels I'm taking brother Brown's word because of his bible-based teaching because of the cloud Prophecy from sirs is this the end time December 30th 1962 Bill rostrand's evidence that the Arizona Cloud was formed by Supernatural means and not human means and the supernatural Revelation and Vindication that God gave to brother Branham regarding the Seven Seals sermons but there's a brother in the message named Bill Rostrum and you can watch his videos proving that the cloud could not have been formed by a Thor rocket I've listened to the entire messages which was over six hours and all the scientific facts are proven and show that the shape of the cloud where it was located the time it appeared the density of the material required to make it all point to the fact that this was not a man-made Cloud it was not made by a Thor rocket it was a supernatural cloud another point is that brother Branham never said thus saith the Lord I was under the cloud when the photo was taken so we cannot jump to a conclusion and make every word of brother Branham thus say the Lord some people attacked brother Brandon because they say he wasn't there under the cloud when the photo was taken but to me that doesn't matter because brother Graham never said thus say the Lord I was under the cloud when the photo was taken a very important point is that the vision of the cloud and its fulfillment was in the name of the Lord it was prophesied on December 30th 1962 and January 14 1963. here's the first quote saying it's in the name of the Lord let's listen to the quote I'm standing in an awful place if you but knew it remember I tell you in the name of the Lord I told you the truth in the next quote from January 14th President of vision sent him here of course that was the vision of the pyramid and constellation of seven angels let's listen to the quote I'm here in Phoenix tonight in the name of the Lord I would would not try to explain what's happened many of people that take the tapes be sure to get that one what time is it sir uh just before left home a vision secondly here because I don't know why I don't I'm not a tape salesman and I don't uh stress those things we get them and we gotta tape a business around the world way into the jungles and everywhere they have a little something you put in the ears they got and can tape it into the tape and stand there and translate that right into the language and it goes around the world and um but the one that I had that uh what time is it serves or is this the time sir some uh Saturday night three weeks ago at the church after all my life of seeing visions I've never had anything like this before in my life and I don't know what it is I'm just here but he sent me here I don't know what it means I've just I'm just here and here on March 24th 1963 brother Branham said the vision was fulfilled with thus saith the Lord let's listen to the quote I could truly say that to the best of my understanding and according to the word of God and the vision and the Revelation the interpretation thereof is thus saith the Lord another point I want to make is that brother Branham could have been under the cloud on February 28th by translation just like Philip God could have transported his physical body there for a moment and then brought him back or he could have been transported there by Vision like Ezekiel in Ezekiel 8 verse 15 Ezekiel was taken to Jerusalem in the visions of God while sitting in his house in chaldia which was probably over 100 miles away ezekiel's Vision was not a translation like Philip because ezekiel's body stayed in chaldia Philip's body was literally translated to another area according to acts 8 verses 39 and 40. and of course I've been mocked and made fun of because of these two possibilities that I believe in but at the same time they are biblical possibilities an important point is that brother Brown did not say the word cloud before the event but he did call This Cloud a snow white pyramid so brother Ram's accusers failed to recognize this saying there's no prophecy about it but there is he just didn't say the word cloud he said Snow White pyramid let's listen to the quotes I could see those angels those shaped back wings traveling faster than sound to travel they come from eternity in a split like a twinkle level enough The Bachelorette is a twinkle they were there I didn't have time to count I didn't have time or this look Mighty ones great powerful angels Snow White means sitting heads and they were and what it did I was caught up into this pyramid constellation and I thought now this is it I was dumbed all over
