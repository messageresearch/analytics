[0:03] if Billy only submit his way to God and
[0:05] believe in God the ministry of M would
[0:07] just be a little bitty thing I know
[0:09] what's in the
[0:11] boy greetings friends in the matchless
[0:13] name of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[0:16] purpose of this video is to show a quote
[0:18] I found recently from God's Prophet
[0:20] brother brandham and he was referring to
[0:22] his son Billy Paul branam and brother
[0:25] brandham said that Billy Paul's gift
[0:27] would be greater than his gift if he
[0:29] could just surrender to the Lord Brother
[0:32] Bram said his own Ministry would be a
[0:34] little bitty thing compared to Billy
[0:36] Paul's Ministry so I'm making this video
[0:39] in brotherly love it's a correction
[0:42] video in hopes to correct some people
[0:45] who are in the tape worship movement the
[0:47] Press Play and Obey idolatrous false
[0:51] movement that currently deceives those
[0:54] that follow the current brandom
[0:56] Tabernacle as they worship every word on
[0:59] William brand tapes and of course this
[1:01] is a video about speaking the truth in
[1:04] love according to Ephesians 4:15 the
[1:07] truth is not always easy to speak but
[1:10] when it's spoken it must be spoken in
[1:12] love so that's what I'm doing today I'm
[1:14] speaking this truth in love with
[1:16] brotherly kindness showing again how my
[1:18] precious Brethren if they are saved in
[1:21] the tape Church press play and Obey
[1:24] false movement that they are deceived
[1:26] and they need to come out of their
[1:27] deception by the grace of God of course
[1:29] of course we're going to prove all
[1:30] things through the quotes and the
[1:31] scriptures by the grace of almighty God
[1:34] so the origin of this video is a couple
[1:36] days ago I was studying and I was
[1:38] reading in brother Ram's Africa trip
[1:40] report from
[1:41] 1953 and he was telling how he took the
[1:45] wrong itinerary and he was going to
[1:46] suffer for it you're probably very
[1:48] familiar with that if you follow the
[1:49] ministry of God's Prophet brother
[1:51] William brandham and the angel Lord told
[1:53] Brother Bram to wake up Billy Paul and
[1:55] brother Ram said the angel had respect
[1:57] to Billy if billy'd only submit his way
[1:59] to God and believe in God the ministry
[2:01] of mine would be just a little bitty
[2:04] thing and when I read that I was caught
[2:08] off guard I'd forgotten this if I'd read
[2:10] it before and brother Ram said I know
[2:12] what's in the boy so brother Ram thought
[2:14] there was a great gift in Billy
[2:16] Paul and then brother Ram tells a quick
[2:18] story that he thinks Billy Paul saw a
[2:21] vision brother Ram said that gift is
[2:24] laying so close to him if he just move
[2:27] over into it it would be wonderful and
[2:29] brother ramam said he's praying that God
[2:30] would settle Billy Paul down someday and
[2:32] put him on a platform that'll give him a
[2:34] Ministry that'll just bring millions of
[2:37] souls to Christ I do now with the
[2:40] understanding we have now here in 2025
[2:43] of course Billy Paul never had a
[2:45] preaching Ministry he never had any
[2:48] Ministry that even came close to his
[2:50] father's Ministry the late Prophet
[2:52] brother William Mary and Bram so as a
[2:54] follower of the bible-based teachings of
[2:56] God's Prophet brother William brandham
[2:58] and as a believer that brother Bram was
[3:00] a true prophet of God I believe this was
[3:03] just brother bram's human love for his
[3:05] son his fatherly love thought Billy Paul
[3:08] had a gift thought that perhaps he had a
[3:11] vision or prophecy but a tree is known
[3:14] by its fruit and throughout the entire
[3:16] lifetime of Billy Paul his ministry was
[3:19] a testimony Ministry a Ministry that
[3:21] promoted listening to the tapes of his
[3:23] father which is good in one way but if
[3:26] you worship those tapes that's awful
[3:28] that's heresy and that's what Billy Paul
[3:30] and his brother Joseph are into they say
[3:33] every word on the tapes is thus sayith
[3:34] the Lord I've got numerous videos on
[3:36] that so I'll leave links to that in the
[3:38] description if you want to watch that
[3:40] they openly declare that that every word
[3:42] is infallible the tapes are infallible
[3:45] the tapes have no mistakes that's
[3:48] idolatry he say that you have to
[3:52] realize that brother every Brother
[3:55] Joseph believes everything that brother
[3:57] brandom says is thus sayth the Lord
[4:05] amen amen I believe everything say say
[4:10] the
[4:11] Lord now there is one other possibility
[4:13] there is a possibility that Billy Paul
[4:16] did in fact see a vision there in South
[4:19] Africa and I think the trip was in 1951
[4:21] if I'm not mistaken and early into 1952
[4:24] I could be wrong on that but that would
[4:26] mean that one of the nine gifts of the
[4:28] holy spirit off operated maybe once or
[4:31] twice in Billy Paul's life and then
[4:33] never again as far as we know it's a
[4:35] gift that's in the body working around
[4:38] to all of you Milling through the body
[4:40] nine spiritual gifts this is might
[4:43] prophesy tonight that's where we get
[4:46] trouble one might prophesy and tell the
[4:49] truth that doesn't make you a prophet it
[4:52] might never come to you again a prophet
[4:55] is a Vindicated person from birth coming
[4:57] down with the word of the Lord so it's a
[4:59] listen to this quote from Africa trip
[5:01] report
[5:02] 1953 said you can go and if you want to
[5:05] go all right but remember you're going
[5:07] to pay for he said tomorrow morning go
[5:10] wake up your boy he had respects to
[5:13] Billy if Billy had only submit his way
[5:16] to God and believing God the ministry of
[5:18] mine would just be a little anything I
[5:20] know what's in the boy but he's just an
[5:23] adolescent age and you just this you
[5:25] don't know where he's standing I know
[5:27] that boy sat here the other night and he
[5:29] said Daddy I was going down the road and
[5:30] something you just tell him say he'll
[5:32] say daddy you know we never been on this
[5:33] road before said right along another
[5:35] place is go to be a barn setting in a
[5:36] certain place and a certain what sure be
[5:38] just exactly that way see and that gift
[5:41] is laying so close to him if he just
[5:43] move over into it it would be wonderful
[5:46] but he just that Frolic age you know and
[5:49] Adolescent and you know what I mean and
[5:51] so I pray that God will settle him down
[5:53] someday and put him on a platform
[5:55] that'll give a Ministry that'll just
[5:57] bring millions of souls to Christ
[6:00] I do you pray for him too and so he's
[6:03] got a lot of front but I know what Billy
[6:05] is in the back so
[6:08] then now that we've heard that remember
[6:10] 6 years later in
[6:12] 1959 brother brandom said that it seems
[6:15] Billy Paul didn't have a calling to be a
[6:18] preacher but yet six years before that
[6:21] brother R thought Billy Paul had a
[6:23] calling to be a prophet and be a greater
[6:26] Prophet than even brother brandom this
[6:28] is from let usy God November 29th 1959
[6:32] he said Billy's been my Chum but it
[6:34] seems he doesn't have a call to be a
[6:36] preacher he's bashful backward and so
[6:38] forth a lot like his mother
[6:40] shy as the saying goes hindsight is 2020
[6:43] so I think it's obvious to see that
[6:45] brother Bram had high hopes for his son
[6:47] Billy Paul that he'd have a greater
[6:49] Ministry than brother brandom himself
[6:52] but then six years later brother Ram's
[6:53] convinced he doesn't even have a call to
[6:55] preach so let's listen to the
[6:58] quote Billy
[7:00] has been my Chum I raised him his mother
[7:02] died when he was just 18 months old and
[7:06] have been father and mother both to him
[7:08] but he seems like he doesn't have a call
[7:10] to be a preacher he's bashful backward
[7:14] and so forth whole lot like his mother
[7:17] shy but he's been a great help to me
[7:20] along in the meeting because I've
[7:21] trusted him take him out there and give
[7:23] him a responsible
[7:26] job and then another quote I want to
[7:28] share about Billy Paul is that 1951
[7:30] brother brandham believed Billy Paul was
[7:32] his promised Joseph of course the Lord
[7:34] told Brother brandham he'd have a
[7:35] promised Joseph in the early 1950s his
[7:39] son Joseph wasn't born till 1955 but
[7:41] before that previous to that brother
[7:43] randam thought there wouldn't be enough
[7:44] time for him to have another son that
[7:46] would grow up to be a preacher so he
[7:48] actually thought Billy Paul was his
[7:50] promised Joseph so again if every word
[7:52] is thus sayith the Lord then Billy
[7:54] Paul's a promised Joseph and so is
[7:56] Joseph A promised Joseph so again if
[7:58] every word is thus said the Lord there's
[8:00] only confusion there's only deception so
[8:02] let's listen to that quote about the
[8:04] promised Joseph
[8:05] 1951 my little boy which is with us now
[8:09] soon be 16 years old he was he seemed to
[8:14] be a good boy he minded me him his very
[8:17] lovely little fellow but I talked to him
[8:20] about being baptized and making his
[8:21] public confession of Christ he lived
[8:24] good and everything a little fell but
[8:26] about a week
[8:28] after but about a week after that I
[8:31] walked into the
[8:33] house but I talked to him about being
[8:36] baptized and making his public
[8:38] confession of Christ he lived good and
[8:40] everything a little fell but about a
[8:42] week after that I walked into the house
[8:45] and he come without me asking or
[8:47] anything he said Daddy I want to be a
[8:49] Christian I want to serve the Lord my
[8:51] Joseph was right with me I didn't know
[8:54] it the little baby that I thought would
[8:56] be Joseph a little girl and I called her
[8:58] Sarah
[9:01] [Music]
[9:03] I'm thankful for her amen I love her
[9:05] with all my heart I had a boy and a girl
[9:09] it which way it went would be all right
[9:11] but I so wanted a a a boy and for so I
[9:16] he could be a minister of the
[9:18] gospel and I believe that God is calling
[9:20] my little boy back there go to be a
[9:22] minister of the
[9:23] [Music]
[9:25] [Applause]
[9:26] Gospel seeing the wisdom of God now I
[9:30] more understand if you ask God God will
[9:34] give you the desire of your heart I
[9:37] don't believe if the little baby would
[9:39] have been born to have come up to the
[9:41] age to be a minister Jesus will be here
[9:43] before that time I believe and God just
[9:46] thr it over on my little boy back there
[9:48] and that and we thank you for your
[9:51] kindness and God bless you now getting
[9:53] back to the Africa trip report quote
[9:55] from 1953 where brother brandom said
[9:57] Billy Paul's gift would be so much
[9:59] greater than his brother Rams would only
[10:01] be a little bitty gift compared to Billy
[10:03] Paul's if that is thus sayith the Lord
[10:06] then wouldn't brandom Tabernacle
[10:08] followers have to admit that Billy Paul
[10:10] failed to submit to God and that would
[10:13] mean that Billy Paul lived a life of
[10:15] rebellion now I'm not saying this to
[10:17] criticize Billy Paul or anyone else but
[10:19] to show the insanity of how tape
[10:21] worshippers worship every word on tape
[10:25] we cannot make every word on tape thus
[10:27] sayith the Lord we cannot make every
[10:29] word word on tape infallible it's
[10:31] complete Insanity if you do again if
[10:34] that's the case if every word is
[10:35] infallible then Billy Paul is the
[10:36] promised Joseph well then what is Joseph
[10:38] brandham see it causes so much confusion
[10:42] and then if every word's infallible then
[10:43] Billy Paul could have had a greater
[10:45] Ministry than brother brandham and
[10:46] brother bram's gift would have been
[10:47] little bitty compared to Billy Paul's
[10:50] but of course we know brother Bram had
[10:52] the greater Ministry he was a prophet he
[10:54] was Malachi 45 and6 he was Revelation
[10:57] 10:7 he was Luke 17 30 he was the
[11:00] seventh Church age messenger Revelation
[11:02] 3:14 he was the Forerunner to the second
[11:05] coming of Jesus Christ so Billy Paul's
[11:07] Ministry is not greater than brother
[11:09] bram's Ministry also here's a few quotes
[11:11] Angel Lord 1951 brother brandham says
[11:14] this is not the Lord speaking this is
[11:16] your brother brother brandham so this
[11:19] again shows not every word is from the
[11:21] Lord Brother BR plainly says it this is
[11:22] not the Lord so someone would have to be
[11:25] insane to say every word is from the
[11:27] Lord every word on tape is thus say the
[11:28] Lord when brother BR said it's not from
[11:30] the Lord let's listen to the quote now
[11:33] remember this now this is not the Lord
[11:35] speaking this is your brother brother
[11:39] brand and the best of my knowledge now
[11:42] just remember this and watch it
[11:44] close then here's another one questions
[11:46] that answers 1961 brother Ram said these
[11:49] answers are not infallible and yet tape
[11:51] worshippers will say every word on tape
[11:53] is infallible let's listen to the quote
[11:56] and these answers are not infallible
[11:59] see because the scriptures is
[12:02] infallible and as far as I know they're
[12:06] line with the scriptures I hope that
[12:08] makes it plain and the tape is to be uh
[12:12] kept now and anyone would want it
[12:16] well could have it but now I know the
[12:19] scriptures are infallible but my answers
[12:22] are not infallible so I'm sure everyone
[12:26] understands that and if it's not the if
[12:28] it's not
[12:29] infallible then you have a right maybe
[12:32] to ask me at any time if there's
[12:35] somebody else's question next I want to
[12:38] replay that quote about sister Rebecca
[12:40] God Rest her soul they're in heaven by
[12:42] God's grace but brother R thought she
[12:44] had a vision too and then brother Ram
[12:45] said she had her first Vision recently
[12:48] so maybe she's going to take my place
[12:51] someday so brother Ram's talking about
[12:53] having visions and that Rebecca had her
[12:55] first vision and maybe Rebecca would
[12:57] take his place someday day now did that
[13:00] ever happen did Rebecca ever take
[13:01] brother Ram's Place seeing visions I
[13:04] believe the answer is no if we're humble
[13:06] and if we're honest by the grace of God
[13:08] but again we're just seeing how brother
[13:09] R had High Hopes And desires and prayers
[13:12] for his children to have even greater
[13:14] Ministries than him but none of them did
[13:17] of course by the grace of God so let's
[13:19] listen to that quote about sister
[13:20] Rebecca all night long I couldn't get
[13:24] that POS of my mind the next morning
[13:27] early I went out as I started out little
[13:31] Rebecca who I believe is going to maybe
[13:34] take my place someday she seen her first
[13:37] Vision just
[13:39] recently and she's a very tenderhearted
[13:41] little thing and then lastly here's a
[13:44] quote again about Joseph from let us see
[13:46] God
[13:48] 1959 brother Ram said he wasn't thinking
[13:50] when he dedicated Joseph and said Joseph
[13:52] my son thou are a prophet he said that's
[13:54] my prayer anyhow so he didn't say that's
[13:57] my prayer with thus sayi the Lord he
[13:58] just said that's that's my prayer anyhow
[14:00] and I believe it'll be someday God will
[14:03] take everything that he ever gave me and
[14:05] double it times double and put on that
[14:07] boy then when I leave that he'll take my
[14:10] place so double * double double is two
[14:13] so 2 * 2 is four so brother BR prayed
[14:15] Joseph would have four times everything
[14:17] he had now has that come to pass of
[14:20] course not Joseph has not done four
[14:22] times the amount of prayer lines brother
[14:24] brandham has nor preached four times the
[14:27] amount of sermons as brother brand did
[14:29] nor traveled around the world four times
[14:32] as many times as brother brandham did so
[14:34] again this is just a father's loving
[14:37] prayer hopeful prayer for his child and
[14:39] of course we know Joseph brandham is not
[14:41] a prophet at least not yet I've talked
[14:43] to two of his childhood friends and they
[14:45] said they've never heard him speak or
[14:47] foretell anything in the name of the
[14:49] Lord that is the very requirement for
[14:51] being a prophet you have to speak
[14:53] something and it comes to pass in the
[14:55] name of the Lord and both these
[14:56] childhood friends love Brother Joseph
[14:58] and follow Brother Joseph Joseph they're
[14:59] not against Brother Joseph they're for
[15:01] him and they've never witnessed him in
[15:04] the role of a real prophet of God so
[15:06] let's listen to the
[15:07] quote when I dedicated him to the Lord
[15:10] the morning there was many little babies
[15:11] standing had mothers with him along the
[15:13] altar when I picked up Joseph in my arms
[15:16] not thinking of what I saying I said
[15:18] Joseph my son thou art a
[15:22] prophet that's my prayer anyhow and I
[15:24] believe it'll be that God will take
[15:27] everything that he ever give double
[15:29] times double and put on that boy that
[15:31] when I leave that he'll take my
[15:34] place so with that friends I'm going to
[15:36] end the video so I hope this was a
[15:38] blessing by the grace of God again
[15:39] speaking the truth in love and again
[15:41] looking at this quote from Africa trip
[15:43] report where brother Ram said my gift
[15:45] will be a little bitty thing compared to
[15:47] Billy Paul's where he'll win millions of
[15:49] Souls of course Billy Paul did not do
[15:51] that brother Ram said he felt he won
[15:54] perhaps 2 million souls and so any
[15:57] honest person would realize brother was
[15:59] just hopeful for his children these
[16:02] statements about his children having
[16:03] greater Ministries or taking his place
[16:05] someday or doing four times as much as
[16:08] he did were not thus sayi the Lord they
[16:10] did not come to pass because they're not
[16:12] prophecies they were just hopeful
[16:14] prayers from a loving father friends
[16:16] let's keep rightly dividing the word of
[16:17] Truth as the Holy Ghost commands us as
[16:19] brother Bram taught us as well brother
[16:21] Bram echoing the scriptures the Holy
[16:23] Ghost will lead and guide us into all
[16:25] Truth by the grace of God John 16: verse
[16:29] 13 if you have any questions concerns or
[16:32] testimonies about this video please
[16:33] contact
[16:35] me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[16:38] the desire of your heart
