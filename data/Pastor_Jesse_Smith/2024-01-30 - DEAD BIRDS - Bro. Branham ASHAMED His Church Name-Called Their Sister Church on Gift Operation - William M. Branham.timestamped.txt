[0:01] now also in here I might bring this out
[0:03] I see my I don't think my brother's here
[0:05] tonight but somebody made fun of
[0:07] somebody leaving the Tabernacle and went
[0:10] down to brother Junior Jackson's for a
[0:11] church said they went down amongst the
[0:13] dead
[0:15] birds aren't you ashamed to make a
[0:17] remark like that ever who you are if
[0:20] you're my kid here in Christ I'm ashamed
[0:22] of
[0:23] you don't do a thing like that Junior
[0:26] Jackson is my
[0:27] brother Don rutle is my brother
[0:31] well the reason of it because when I set
[0:33] the church here in a certain order when
[0:34] I come back to see if I could get the
[0:36] manifestation of the gifts half of them
[0:38] pulled away from
[0:39] it because when you would start to speak
[0:43] or preach or something it got it was
[0:45] getting in such a place that you could
[0:46] hardly preach unless there was somebody
[0:48] spoke in Tong somebody somebody give
[0:50] interpretation and half of it never even
[0:52] come to
[0:53] pass now I believe in speaking in
[0:55] tongues I believe in interpretation but
[0:58] it must be something directly to the
[1:00] church not the Lord is coming soon or
[1:01] something which is all right but don't
[1:04] use vain repetitions Jesus said as
[1:07] heathens do it must be something go tell
[1:09] brother so and so a certain thing he
[1:11] done and and get well go tell brother
[1:14] sister so and so when she did a certain
[1:15] thing down there other day she
[1:17] transgressed the laws of her husband's
[1:19] the vow to her husband unless she makes
[1:21] this lot right the holy spirit will cut
[1:23] her off there you've got thus sayith the
[1:25] Lord then bring that sin in amen that's
[1:29] when we got a Church like it was when
[1:31] aniz 5 come in Lord then we got a church
[1:35] to stand solid oh you say brother Bram
[1:37] one guy told him that he said well you
[1:39] put us too much on the spot I said ain't
[1:41] I on the spot up there amen The
[1:44] Strangers will never seen in my life but
[1:46] I got faith and confidence in my God who
[1:49] sent me to do this and never one time
[1:51] has it been wrong or never will be as
[1:53] long as it's
[1:54] God right not speaking in tongues and
[1:58] things like that I believe it those
[1:59] tongues and people got them gifts if
[2:01] they're real genuwine Christians and
[2:02] interested in it they'll meet themselves
[2:04] together because and give the tongues
[2:06] and interpretations and see what they
[2:08] can do to further the kingdom of
[2:10] God they got a Ministry of their own but
[2:13] it don't belong here in the middle of
[2:14] the audience where the Sinners are being
[2:16] dealt with and so forth the Bible said
[2:18] they say you're unlearned sometimes it
[2:20] get so irreverent with it and and so
[2:22] forth not our gang haton but I let him
[2:24] go ahead a while I said watch it now I
[2:26] told the brethen his Witnesses here to
[2:28] know this I said let it alone own after
[2:31] a while I'll we'll find out whether it's
[2:33] of God or not if it cannot stand
[2:35] chastisement then it's a bastard child
[2:38] exactly what the Bible said and when the
[2:40] chastisement come what
[2:42] happened did I tell you that long
[2:44] ago asked the pastor here he said what
[2:47] about this and that I said just let it
[2:48] alone they're babies we can't judge it
[2:51] but watch when it really comes to pin
[2:53] down to the word now brother Junior
[2:56] Jackson had a right to disagree with
[2:58] that he wants his church the people all
[3:00] want to speak with tongues and things in
[3:02] the audience that's brother Junior's uh
[3:05] troubl that's that's up to him but
[3:07] Junior Jackson believes this message the
[3:09] same as and the rest of us does he's one
[3:12] of us and it's not a dead bird to go
[3:14] there Junior Jackson is a man of God
[3:16] that I love with all my heart amen it's
[3:19] not here tonight so I can really pour it
[3:21] on the way I want to and and Don rutle I
[3:24] don't think Don's here tonight because
[3:25] they got church of their own but if I
[3:27] seen every person come to this
[3:29] Tabernacle walk out and go to Don rutle
[3:31] or or brother JT Parnell or brother any
[3:33] of these brothers here that's our
[3:35] brothers here and fellow citizens of the
[3:37] Kingdom I'd be so happy I wouldn't know
[3:39] what to do I'd say Lord fill this one
[3:41] back up again let's pour it out and fill
[3:42] up another
[3:43] one I'd love it I'd love to see those
[3:47] boys they're my they're my
[3:49] children now JT or or any of the rest of
[3:53] them don't have to believe just like I
[3:54] do they don't have to do that as I told
[3:56] you this morning I don't even agree with
[3:58] my wife or she don't agree with with
[4:00] me what if I went to table and Junior
[4:02] got apple pie and I got cherry pie
[4:05] brother we're both eating pie we'd agree
[4:07] that but and we both preach the same
[4:11] gospel his church discipline you know
[4:13] Peter and Paul had differences not in
[4:16] their doctrines but the way Peter was
[4:19] behaving himself they had a little
[4:22] difference in it but it never separated
[4:24] them they were brothers well sure we're
[4:27] going to have differences not
[4:29] differences I disagree with Assemblies
[4:31] of God I disagree with their systems but
[4:33] there's a many Assembly of God man is a
[4:35] precious brother I disagree with the
[4:38] Wess Doctrine but there's a many of
[4:40] those men are precious man I agree
[4:43] disagree with the Baptist with the
[4:44] Presbyterians in their systems but in
[4:47] there there's genuine
[4:49] Christians amen somehow other afternoon
[4:51] I picked up a telegram I missed it a
[4:54] brother a Baptist preacher said he been
[4:55] seeking for a long time to come to a
[4:58] place or get to a place where man
[5:00] respected God and instead of respecting
[5:02] one another and a precious brother comes
[5:04] to this church said I'll take you to
[5:06] such a place he was long to get here a
[5:09] Baptist you see they're scattered
[5:12] everywhere I wouldn't agree with their
[5:14] system but I certainly love the party so
[5:16] don't say that about the brother now in
[5:18] here these gifts are got to be watched
[5:21] no gift had to watch it Satan can
[5:23] impersonate any gift look at these
[5:25] Beatles now go to impersonate Divine
[5:26] Healing filthy dirty rotten borned Out
[5:30] of Hell amen see all
[5:34] right
