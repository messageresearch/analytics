TRANSCRIPT
========================================
foreign [Music] God bless you and welcome to the defending the message podcast I'm your host Pastor Jesse Smith in today's podcast I'd like to do a rebuttal on a recent podcast that attacked brother branham's February 1965 sermon marriage and divorce this podcast was released August 21st and normally I don't call names of the accusers of brother Branham and I'll try not to do that again in this podcast but I felt a response and rebuttal to this podcast was necessary I'd been recently studying marriage and divorce myself and then this podcast came out so I felt it was led to the Lord that I should respond and show how brother random sermon on marriage and divorce was certainly inspired of the Holy Ghost so by God's grace I have 12 points I want to make about this podcast 12 points I want to refute from their sad podcast from August 21st but first I want to share a few quotes from marriage and divorce that have meant a lot to me over the years the first is that brother Branham said what caused all the Mix-Ups and he said two reasons false teaching and not waiting on the Lord and friends I found that as a pastor with counseling people and talking to people the reason people have problems with their marriages is many times they did not wait on the Lord before getting married they didn't pray and fast enough about who they should marry and then secondly they were taught wrong about marriage and divorce they didn't have the full scriptural Revelation on marriage and divorce so let's listen to the quote good man all mixed up I've done it false teaching [Music] exactly not waiting on the Lord second I love this quote from brother Brandon where he said sisters and brothers must flee to the cross so we know brother Branham hammers immoral women in marriage and divorce but I love this quote because he says man also have to flee to the cross let's listen to the quote he still got her she better flee to the cross like man too the third and final quotes are brother Ram saying this is an awful strong thing so he knew his sermon was making a very strong case against immoral women and then he says I'm not talking to you sisters he said I'm talking of the immoral women now so it's very important to understand this was a strong sermon against immoral women brother random's marriage and divorce sermon was not attacking Godly sisters sisters who live holy who walk under the anointing of the Holy Ghost it was an awful strong sermon against him or women let's listen to the quotes this is an awful strong thing I didn't know how to bring it out I'm talking to the immoral now not two sisters and one last thing before we get into the 12 points of rebuttal is that I should add a disclaimer this podcast is going to cover a few sensitive subjects so I do not recommend it for children so adults and parents if you're listening please do not allow your younger children to listen to this podcast thank you let's begin with Point number one point number one is that the accusers of brother Branham claim they were going to do a deep dive into this sermon and they claim this was the most anti-biblical sermon brother Branham ever preached this is a bunch of nonsense and of course as proof that they did not do a deep dive they ignored the scriptures brother random use to teach marriage and divorce like Matthew 5 32 where Jesus said whosoever shall put away his wife saving for the cause of fornication causes her to commit adultery this is one of the main scriptures on marriage and divorce and of course these accusers of brother Branham did not cover this scripture secondly they spliced some of my brother Ram's quotes and they left out important context such as when brother Branham said Satan was co-equal to God but they left out the part all but Creator so shame on them for criticizing certain phrases and neglecting the entire statement the entire context of brother Branham and also regarding context they misunderstand brother Ram's statement about his newspaper articles regarding women and how snakes were able to give women certain Sensations which we'll get to a little later Point number two is that brother random said this marriage and divorce sermon was thus saith the Lord all the way through and brother braham's accusers are completely misunderstanding this statement this statement thus saith the Lord all the way through does not mean every single word on the sermon anyone who've studied brother Brown's messages knows you have to be very careful how you interpret his thus say the Lord's statements there's two examples that prove not every word in the entire sermon was thus say the Lord brother Brandon said Jacob had at least a dozen wives scripturally That's not accurate he only had four wives and of course I'm open to correction if anybody can show me how Jacob had more than a dozen wives Genesis 31 verses 48 to 55 show that Jacob swore to Laban he'd take no other wives other than the four that he already had and then a second example that not every word was thus saith the Lord in the sermon is that brother random said David was not pretty but had character and of course we don't believe David was pretty like a woman but the Bible said David was fair countenance and that word fair in Hebrew means Fair beautiful or handsome so in the context brother Brown was trying to show an attractive outward appearance is one of Satan's deceptions to try to deceive people and that's true but here it just seems like brother Brandon forgot that David was called a fair countenance which means a very handsome countenance in other words David was handsome but the Lord Jesus was not because Isaiah 53 says he has no beauty that we would desire him let's listen to the quote about Jacob and let's listen to the quote about David Jacob Jacob he married two sisters and had concubine wise besides that common law women that he lived with and those Patriarchs is born right out of those concubine women amen good is that right amen so you have to make the word run smooth oh I got pages on them you say go get him and while David come in the sight of the Prophet The Prophet remember the heart and poured it up on his head said this is God's children [Music] not pretty but character God looks at character Man look and also getting back to how we have to be careful how we interpret brother randoms thus say the Lords there's a couple examples of this in the seventh seal 1963 brother random said it was thus saith the Lord he said the church ages plus the Seven Seals plus history it was all thus saith the Lord now friends anyone that knows the Seven Seals and have listened to them they know there's human mistakes in those sermons for example brother random said there's only 700 that did not bow the knee to Baal in the Days of Elijah but then brother Ram corrected it in the questions and answers sermon and realized there was seven thousand he said it was just the slip of the tongue but the fact that brother Brandon would say it's thus saved the Lord all the way through in the Seven Seals when he knew there were mistakes that he said proves he was talking about it was thus say the Lord on the revelations and not every word so that's how we understand the sermon on marriage and divorce as well he didn't mean every word all the way through he meant the Bible revelations the Bible teachings all the way through on marriage and divorce another example is from the sermon the God of this evil age August 1st 1965. brother Ram said if she cuts it off I don't care how much he dances sings She is dead that's thus saith the Lord the word of God first Corinthians 14 yeah so notice brother random says a woman that cuts her hair no matter how much she gets in the spirit she's dead which means she's not born again her soul is not born again but then he quotes the wrong scripture he says First Corinthians 14. any Bible reader knows First Corinthians 14 is not about hair it's about speaking in tongues So within one breath brother random was right with thus say the Lord but then he moved to the human side and quoted the wrong scripture so again these are just two simple examples of how we have to be very careful how we interpret brother branham's thus say the Lord's statements let's listen to the quote from God of this evil age if she cuts it off I don't care how much she dances sings send a choir speaks in tongues runs up and down or has all kind of AIDS decided she's dead that's thus saith the Lord the word of God first Corinthians 14. the third point I want to make is that brother Ram's accusers did not like how brother Branham said women can stoop to be one of the lowest things in creation and friends this is true because clearly brother Branham is showing a woman has a soul which animals do not have souls and then a woman has the power to say yes or no to a man so she often but not always has the power of control to either allow or disallow an immorality so this is why an immoral woman is one of the lowest things in creation and also I would put in there so is an immoral man because an immoral man could rape a woman and that's just as low as an immoral woman and also we can connect this to the Book of Proverbs where Solomon says three times that an immoral woman is the gates To Hell Proverbs 5 verse 5 said her feet go down to death her steps take hold on Hell Proverbs 7 27 her house is the way to Hell going down to the chambers of death and Proverbs 9 verse 18 said but he knoweth not that the Dead are there and that her guests are in the depths of hell a fourth point I want to refute is that brother Ram's accusers misunderstand brother branham's statement where brother Brandon said Satan was Eve's designer now friends clearly brother Ryan was not saying Satan created Eve because clearly Brothers said in the sermon Satan does not have the power of creation brother was saying that Satan designs the immoral clothes that reveal the bodily shape of a woman that make her seductive like the Bible says he makes women wear the attire of harlots as I believe Proverbs chapter 7 verse 10 says and I admit friends the word design is probably not the best word but brother Ryan was human in the sermon he said he was up all night he was probably mentally drained but either way a real honest person an honest Christian will take everything back to the word of God rather than criticizing brother Branham and neglecting all the other truth that was in the sermon and here's a few quotes where brother random said God made Eve so obviously brother random was not saying Satan created Eve the first is from 1953 questions and answers brother Graham said now God made Eve from Adam's side and then in perseverance 1962 brother Brown said God made Eve was the prettiest woman ever lived she was God's early specimen of Womanhood let's listen to the quotes now God made Eve from Adam's side no sir Anna Adam he looked like some prehistoric giant I've never seen such a thing you know God made him perfect God made Eve was the prettiest woman ever lived she was God's early specimen of Womanhood certainly it was and the fifth point is one I already addressed but brother Ram's accusers claimed brother Brown was rebuking all women but clearly brother Adam said he was only talking about immoral women so if you want to hear those quotes just go back to the beginning of this podcast and you'll hear it brother Brandon said this is an awful strong thing and he said I'm talking to the immoral now not you sisters the six point I want to make is that brother Ram's accusers misunderstood his statement that Satan was co-equal with God and so the first point is that brother brahm's accusers spliced this quote he said sure it was all but a Creator he was everything and look what brother Brandon said he stood at the right hand of God in the heavens the great leading cherubim so here brother Adams of course using hyperbole he's trying to make a point that Satan was the anointed cherub that covereth he was very close to God in other quotes he says Satan was God's right man hand to fellowship and we understand the point of this that Satan was very close to God and friends this statement is hyperbole but it makes a lot of sense because we have to consider how did Satan convince a third of the angels to leave their first estate the only way he could have done that is because God made himself so humble so God allowed Lucifer to be right there by his throne I believe also Michael because there were two cherubims that stood upon the mercy seat on the Ark of the Covenant and Moses got this pattern from God and no doubt God got this pattern from his Heavenly throne so it's likely the Angels saw a lot of similarities between God and Lucifer because Lucifer was so beautiful as the Bible says in Ezekiel 28 he was perfect in Beauty in verse 12. and then in verse 15 it says Thou was perfect in thy ways from the day that thou was created and then verse 17 says thine heart was lifted up because of thy Beauty the seventh misunderstanding is or the random statement about immoral women being a human garbage can of sexual disposal now friends I admit this is very harsh language but brother Branham admitted that he said this is an awful strong sermon and brother Branham said excuse me young ladies before he said this but friends I believe this is an accurate statement especially when you consider the lowest thing in the entire Book of Revelation is the mother Harlot because she was a to Every Nation All Nations on the earth and of course speaking of the Roman Catholic Church being a harlot to Every Nation all the kings of the earth and nothing is lower of course than this mother Harlot Church so the mother Harlot church is a spiritual representation of a natural woman who would be a who would receive many men and be an absolute disgrace to the Godly calling of how a woman should act and live also on their podcast they said that the Bible says sin came in the world through one man and that's true Romans 5 verse 12. states that wherefore is by one man's sin entered into the world and death by sin but there's also a scripture that says first Timothy 2 14 Adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression so it's clear by one man's sin entered in the world so this either means one of two things it could mean first Adam was guilty of neglect because think about it how in the world did Eve get a loan to be with the serpent and receive the forbidden fruit which any honest person realizes it was an adulterous act the forbidden fruit was adultery between the serpent and Eve or the statement by one man sin entered in the world refers to Adam plunging the whole Humanity into death because Eve was deceived and sinned as first Timothy 2 14 says but Adam had the choice he could have let Eve die but he didn't he chose the partake of the forbidden fruit which was having relations with Eve and he plunged the whole Humanity into death but of course Adam partaking of the fruit allowed two seeds to be planted in Eve and it brought forth twins from two different seeds so again I believe brother Branham is Vindicated in this statement and also friends remember the scripture first Timothy 5 6. but she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth here Paul is talking about a woman who's a widow but she chooses to live in pleasure rather than living off the support of the church or marrying a Godly Man and Paul says she's dead while she lives in other words her soul is dead it's not Anointed with faith it's not Anointed with the Holy Ghost so this scripture shows an immoral woman is one of the lowest things in the entire world and many women who are immoral are dead while they live as the Bible says few there be that find the narrow road that leads to life please pardon the interruption I'd like to remind our listeners about two resources that will greatly strengthen your faith according to my humble opinion in 2019 I wrote the book called restoring Christian modesty it's over 120 Pages showing the Bible foundations for a modest and holy appearance it covers all the guidelines for modest clothing and also covers bracelets necklaces Rings earrings nose rings and many more topics one of the most useful parts of this book is the chapter that shows the history of the United States and how they slowly rejected modest clothing and it Chronicles all these changes decade by decade from the 1800s to the present and the second resource is my 2021 book it's an 812 page book about the 12 New Testament Mysteries that brother Branham finished according to Revelation 10 verse 7 brother random said the seventh Church age messenger would finish all these mysteries in the sermon called is this the sign of the answer from December 1962 friends this is an extensive Bible teaching on the major doctrines that Brethren gave us proving he was the seventh Church age messenger a genuine prophet of God and the Elijah Prophet to restore all things in a time when so many people are falling away from the message I feel these two resources will strengthen your faith if you want God to draw closer to you you've got to draw closer to him and many times that's through prayer Bible study worship so I know these two resources will be a great help to you they're available on Amazon I'm not a book salesman so if you can't afford them I'll gladly email you the free PDFs you can read them on your phone or tablet or print them off if you like recall acts 17 verse 11 seven the brains were more noble because they searched the Scriptures Daily to prove the things that Paul taught were true and so we must do the same thing today if we're spiritual nobility if we're spiritual royalty in the family of the Lord Jesus Christ the family of King Jesus then we should search the Scriptures Daily to prove brother Brown's teachings were thus saith the word of God thank you for your time now back to the content foreign is that brother Ram's accusers said he had papers of sex to hand out to the men after the service and this is a misunderstanding let's listen to the quote and you'll hear Brother Branham talk about how the serpent is no longer a beast the serpent is a snake that goes on its belly and then brother random makes a strange but interesting statement that says there's still the same sin Works around a woman and so it seems like from this quote brother random has some newspaper articles where a snake could somehow give a woman some very powerful feelings again I have no other information on this other than the quotes from Brother Branham he said he's got all the papers and things laying right there so brother Ram is making a connection between snakes and women here in 1965 which is 6 000 years basically since the serpent first deceived Eve let's listen to the quote I said it's here not knowing where he said it's a serpent it's exactly what it was for he's no longer a beast he was cursed and put on his belly for the rest of his days he's here is that right and still in that act that he done that's still the same sin Works around a woman like a male sex like that that's where she has her walleye conditions and things when she has her Sensations far beyond what any man could ever do I'll stop there because we're in a mixed crowd I get the man I'll we'll talk more about it got all the papers and things laying right here right at my hand right now now let's go to bring to you this morning let's go take the full day in this but I'll close now I'm saying this so now that you've heard the quote brother Brandon's accusers are misunderstanding this statement they claim brother random is talking about how a man can cause a woman to have these walleyed conditions but that's not what brother Brown's talking about brother Ryan was not talking about a man and a woman he's talking about a snake and a woman because he says it's still the same sin Works around a woman he says it goes far beyond what any man could ever do so Brothers not talking about a man and a woman he's talking about a snake and a woman so I don't know what papers brother random had on that but he's referring to the connection between the serpent and Eve from the past and the current connection with snakes and women the ninth point is that brother random's accusers say it's wrong for brother random to share the story about meat as tumor now this quote about sister media developing a tumor after she slammed the door and brother Brown's face is not in the marriage and divorce sermon it's actually in Look Away to Jesus 1963. but I disagree with brother Brown's accusers it's not wrong for brothers to tell this story because the entire Bible tells stories of saints sinning falling short of the glory of God like Moses David Adam and Eve and of course every other man of God Abraham and so forth and brothers also very open about his mistakes and his failures he shared many of them so while it may have been uncomfortable for sister Mita to have brother around tell that story God still allowed it and sister meet us still love brother Bynum and brother Ram telling that story would not be outside of the program of God the character of God again because God tells about Saints and their mistakes all throughout the Bible and again friends there's no proof of brother Brandon being an abusive husband that's another Point brother Andrew accusers try to make again they're always jumping to conclusions trying to attack God's messenger which ultimately takes everybody's eyes off the messenger's message which is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever Hebrews 13 8 Acts 2 38 all the script pictures from The Holy Bible that give us the baptism of the Holy Ghost and eventually will give us rapturing faith the tenth point is that brother's accusers claim brother random performed the remarriages of his brothers in this case it's the accuser's word versus brother branham's word it's the accusers documents supposedly and we don't know if they're doctored or not against brother branham's words but I'll just share this quote because I just heard it recently from questions and answers 1961. brother random said his brother asked him to marry a second time and brother Ram said not at all and then he quotes Matthew 5 32 which shows there's no remarriage after divorce except it be in the case of unconfessed adultery let's listen to the quote if you notice what Jesus said I hear him I've got a brother my own blood brother that's fixing to marry a woman and my brother has been married before and got a child by a good woman and he come to me to marry him I said not at all Jesus said in Matthew 5 whosoever puts away his wife and marries another saving the cause of fornications which she had to do before she was married and didn't tell him about it causes her to commit adultery whosoever marries her that is put away in liveth in adultery so don't do that no you cannot go back to your to your first wife if she's been married again but if you she divorced you and put you away then you said am I free let me read it again I was married to a woman that had never been married before we divorced and she has been married twice I suppose this person has remained single the Bible states that if we desire to marry to turn to first again no sir get over levitical laws you go back to that woman she's somebody else's property you've defiled and made yourself worse off than ever no you should not take a wife back he's been married to somebody else now could I turn to her who has been married before or should I or should I be free you are free stay free yeah you don't go back again no sir she's married somebody else stay away from it that's right no that's the file you understand we add a little more time I'll get into that but just for your question my brother whoever you are no sir don't you go back and take that woman when she's been married two or three times since she married you that's wrong the 11th statement is that brother Brian's accusers say brother Branham accidentally introduced polygamy in the marriage and divorce sermon again this is a bunch of nonsense when brother random said polygamy was thus saved the Lord he meant polygamy was in the Bible and God allowed it in the Bible and that's thus saith of scripture and that's true God did allow it in the Old Testament but not in the New Testament and the proof of that is that there's many quotes from Brother Branham where he says he does not believe in polygamy let's listen to two of those from the supernatural 1956 brother Graham said now remember don't you say that I believe in polygamy I don't and then the second one is the 17th week of Daniel 1961. he said and yet polygamy is wrong we know let's listen to the quotes in the Nations where they have polygmy it's a thousand times better and yet plague me is wrong we know I remember don't you said I believe and played me I don't know and then also the marriage and divorce sermon brother Brandon said when you've got a direct Revelation from God that's your wife the same thing that's yours the rest of your life see so here brother Branham says the one you marry is the one you got to live with the rest of your life let's listen to the quote what God has joined together let no man put us and I want man join together what God joined together when you got a direct Revelation from God that's your wife and the same thing that's yours the rest of your life and Friends it may be true that people are on the message have accepted polygamy but that's because they haven't waited on God as brother Adam said they have false teachings they haven't prayed about it they haven't listened to all the other quotes from Brother Branham on the topic of marriage and divorce these people that allow polygamy are led by the spirit of lust instead of the Holy Spirit and they'll be judged for that one day if they do not repent the 12th and final statement is brother Ram's accusers misunderstand when brother random said he can but she can't for the Brandon's accusers are saying that somehow brother random allowed men to remarry and divorce but women can't and that's now boy brother Ryan was saying again brother bran was not a polygamist he did not permit polygamy I want to reference my two videos about marriage and divorce in those videos I clearly taught Through the Bible and brothers quotes what brother random taught about marriage and divorce and the true Bible Revelation from Jesus is that a man and woman are married until death just one man and one woman the only way a man can divorce a woman and put her away and marry another is if he finds out the wise vow about her being a virgin was a lie and that's the one and only case where a man could divorce his wife put her way and remarry and this is what brother Adam taught in numerous places it's from the verses Matthew 5 32 and Matthew 19 verse 9. Jesus said saving for the cause of fornication that's the only way a man can divorce and remarry of course that means a woman that had fornication before they were married and she didn't confess it and Jesus said again in Matthew 19 9 except to be for fornication and this is also found in Matthew chapter 1 verses 19 and 20. Joseph was going to put away Mary privately rather than publicly because it seemed to him she had already known a man before they were married but the angel Lord appeared unto Joseph and said if you're not to take unto thee Mary thy wife for that which is conceived of hers of the Holy Ghost so the Bible interprets itself there's only one cause that a man can put away a woman and remarry another that's if the woman gave a false vow and said she was a virgin but she'd actually committed fornication and it is true that only a man can do that a woman can't because that's what Jesus said Jesus said it causes her to commit adultery not him because the man is head over woman as the Bible plainly teaches and just like the type brother random said the church can't put Christ away only Christ could put away the church the same is true in the natural the last point I want to make is that brother Adam teaches his true Revelation on marriage and divorce also in questions and answers 1962 to May 27th brother random uses First Corinthians 7 15 to show that a woman and man can separate but they cannot remarry another the Bible says they're free and not under bondage but brother Adam says that doesn't mean you're free to remarry he says you've got to remain single because you vowed to be married to them until death and that's also according to Romans chapter 7. it's Romans 7 verse 2 the woman which hath and husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she's loose from the law of her husband verse 3 so then if while her husband liveth she'd be married to another man she should be called an adulteress but if her husband be dead she's free from that law so that she is no adulterous though she'd be married to another man so I'll give you the words to look for if you start looking for the words now and answering these questions they are the best of my knowledge and if I'll try to answer them by scripture so it's paragraph 27 and then it goes from paragraph 27 all the way down to paragraph about 44. and then he also addresses in another quote from 1961 questions and answers October 15th it starts with question 159 brother Branham I was married to a woman that had been married before we divorced and she's been married twice since so here brother random says they have to remain single if they've been divorced they cannot remarry their first spouse if their first spouse had went and married somebody else thank you well we come to the end of this podcast friends I hope this was a blessing Again by the grace of God I felt led to the Lord to correct the lies that came out of one of Brothers accusers podcasts they show their cognitive dissonance on their podcasts on a weekly basis they will not accept correction they will not admit they're wrong they will not interpret brother random correctly nor the Bible but friends we're grateful for marriage and divorce if you heard my wife's testimonies at first sermon she listened to and although it was strong she recognized it was the truth even while just coming out of the Lutheran Church now of course we've been serving God in this message since 2002 and we're grateful for it over 21 years in the message it's been a complete blessing a complete transformation because it's the word of God revealed to us it's the Bible revealed to us the message of the hour the scriptures God is fulfilling right now so thank you for your downloads friends and if you feel led please pray about it and share this podcast with someone if you think it might help them God bless you and may Jesus Christ anoint you to defend this message that was yesterday never failed [Music] thank you
