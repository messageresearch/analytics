TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Revelation chapter 7 the themes of this chapter include the sealing of the 144,000 Israelites and the Gentile multitudes worship of the Lamb around the heavenly throne the sealing of the 144,000 Israelites which include 12,000 believers from each of the 12 tribes of Israel takes place on Mount Zion and Jerusalem as revelation 14 one through five provides us with more wonderful detail of the same scene we see in Revelation 7 1 through 8 this is the moment when the nation of Israel is born of the Holy Ghost at once in one day by Jesus Christ the Lamb himself this is the moment when the nation of Israel be grafted back into God's new covenant the baptism of the holy ghost the Gentile multitude from all nations of Revelation 7 verses 9 to 17 is the wife or bride of Jesus Christ and has seen worshiping the Lamb around his throne in heaven the timing of the events of this chapter are as follows the sealing of the 144,000 Israelites takes place at the end of the Tribulation Period following the three-and-a-half year ministry of the two witnesses or prophets Moses and Elijah after the 144,000 have witnessed the death resurrection and rapture of the two prophets they will be ready to receive the Messiah that the two men were preaching about for the last three and a half years the timing of the Gentile multitude worshipping around the throne in heaven is unknown to us but it seems to be either a scene that takes place during the marriage supper the lamb which is during the tribulation but takes place in heaven so that the wife of Christ is kept from wrath or it is a scene from the 1000 year millennial reign for these Gentile believers are seen in the temple which could be the earthly Millennial temple that will be built in Jerusalem we can rule out that this scene is not the New Jerusalem because there is no temple at that time according to Revelation 21 verse 22 the symbols and key revelations in this chapter include the seal of the Living God in the foreheads and the blood washed white robes the seal of the Living God represents the baptism of the holy ghost that is a seal or mark unto the day of the believers Redemption or the day when they receive their new celestial body this seal is the indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit in the believers soul which Jesus foretold he would send and st. Paul said was the mystery that all the Old Testament believers longed for Christ in you the hope of glory the Gentile church has and is receiving this seal now but the Israelite church cannot be born again of this seal at this time because God has left the Jews and gone to the Gentiles to get a bride for his namesake the blood washed white robes represent the same thing as the seal of God God's Spirit indwelling the believer clothing them in the power of the Holy Ghost to have a white robe is to have the righteousness of Jesus Christ and His righteousness only comes to those who are born again of the Holy Ghost furthermore to be blood washed does not mean to be washed in the literal blood of Jesus but rather it means that the life of Jesus's blood or spirit of Christ has cleansed the mind and life of the believer if you like more bible scriptures quotations or if you have any questions about the book of Revelation please contact us god bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
