TRANSCRIPT
========================================
chapter 11 the mystery of god's will chapter 11 contains footnotes numbers 1693-1792 having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself ephesians 1 verse 9 multitudes of religious people say they want to know god's will for their lives for certain this is an admirable confession but how many would accept it if they knew god was calling them to holiness in the greek lexicon holiness means sacred physically pure morally blameless paul emphatically states god's call upon every christian's life is a holy calling in second timothy 1 verse 9 who hath saved us and called us with an holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose and grace which was given us in christ jesus before the world began first note that god loves you so much that his purpose for you started before the world began the bible tells you where you came from god's mind and where you're going back to god's presence ephesians 1 verse 4 agrees saying we should be holy based upon our love for god according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love you will learn where you are now in relation to god's will and how to remain in his perfect will god calls us to holiness away from the world you cannot live immorally and claim to be obedient to god's will you're not called to enjoy sin in first thessalonians 4 verses 7 and 8 paul claims we are not called to uncleanness but to holiness men despise us for this calling but our leading to be holy is through the holy spirit within us jesus's holy voice daily calls you to live holy in fact holiness is a requirement to see jesus in his mercy hebrews 12 verses 14 and 15 read follow peace with all men and holiness without which no man shall see the lord looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of god you read that correctly religious people can fail or fall short be destitute lack god's grace and miss heaven many fail or reject grace by disobeying jesus's commands god's warning for this is recorded in hebrews 10 verse 29 of how much sore punishment suppose ye shall he be thought worthy who hath trodden underfoot the son of god and hath counted the blood of the covenant wherewith he was sanctified an unholy thing and hath done despite unto the spirit of grace doing the will of god is at the core of the christian experience and is a requirement to enter heaven in the greek will means choice desire or pleasure since god is eternal infinite omniscient and omnipotent his will or choices for us are our joy and comfort humans constantly make disastrous choices so god's will saves us from our helpless fallen sinful selfish and failing condition jesus's prayer in gethsemane in the moment of his greatest anguish marked by bloody sweat drops is likely the most memorable and famous quote regarding god's will luke 22 42 records this prayer saying father if thou be willing remove this cup from me nevertheless not my will but thine be done the father's will superseded the will of jesus flesh and mind which did not want to suffer let alone die the brutal death of the cross yet jesus chose god's will and christ is exalted glorified and worshiped because of his momentous surrender of his own will jesus's ability to always do the father's will is what made him a worthy substitutionary sacrifice for mankind he said in john 8 verse 29 for i do always those things that please him your ability to surrender to and obey god's will is what makes you worthy of heaven according to our lord in matthew 7 verse 21 not every one that saith unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven the confusion about the mystery of god's will the confusion about god's will centers on whether or not it can be known and if so how can it be known is his will known by just reading the bible or does god speak in other ways additionally many wonder if it's their responsibility to seek god for his will or if god is obligated to initiate his will by supernaturally revealing himself and his will to them the revelation of the mystery of god's will is that god initiates and reveals his will to every person making them responsible for responding to him and seeking his future desires biblical evidence for the revelation about god's will scripture teaches god initiates a relationship with every human undeniably revealing himself and his eternal power romans 1 verses 19 and 20 proclaims because that which may be known of god is manifest in them for god hath showed it unto them for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even his eternal power and godhead so that they are without excuse god makes everyone know his existence by giving them proof in close proximity to them in their body mind and all creation in the universe around them as preacher ray comfort correctly reasons atheists believe the scientific impossibility that nothing created everything every building is proof of a builder every painting is proof of a painter creation is proof of a creator it's impossible for it to make itself there will be no excuses on judgment day for denying god's existence grace and mercy his love is proven in the air you just breathed the grass you walk on and the 35 million times your heartbeat in the past year without needing your help or permission through god's mercy we live and move and have our being life is such a beautiful opportunity to experience god's love and share with others solomon states the glory of life's opportunities but perfectly balances it with god's requirement for accountability in ecclesiastes 11 verse 9 rejoice o young man in thy youth and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth and walk in the ways of thine heart and in the sight of thine eyes but know thou that for all these things god will bring thee into judgment armed with this inward spiritual knowledge and outward scientific evidence all men are responsible for responding to god by searching after knowing and doing his will every soul has a thirst for god and truth psalm 42 verse 2 reads my soul thirsts for god for the living god god mercifully grants each person the gift of life an awareness of his creator's existence and free moral agency but god is going to demand back or require each soul to give account of his choices luke 12 20 says of the lost soul thou fool this night thy soul shall be required of thee the wise soul will seek after god and find him through the cross of jesus the sinful foolish soul will deny his creator and spurn his mercy validated by john 3 16 and verse 19 the sad truth is god loves the humanity he created but most men greatly love darkness those who love god will be with him eternally those who hated and despised him will be separated from him eternally our lord is too gracious and loving to force anyone to be in his presence eternally god's sovereign will there are three aspects to god's will first god's sovereign immutable eternal unconditional will second god's known will for man third god's progressive unknown or future will of man ultimately god's will is sovereign immutable and eternal before the foundation of the world the eternal god pre-planned all human history based upon his foreknowledge of every human decision beginning with believers 1st peter 1 verse 2 says we are elect or chosen based upon god's foreknowledge elect according to the foreknowledge of god the father through sanctification of the spirit unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of jesus christ god never had to neither had need to ask anyone about how to plan human existence he needs no counselor as isaiah 40 verses 13 and 14 proclaims who hath directed the spirit of the lord or being his counselor hath taught him with whom took he counsel and who instructed him and taught him in the path of judgment and taught him knowledge and showed to him the way of understanding the obvious answer is no one god declares the beginning from the end and does exactly what he wants isaiah 46 verses 9 and 10 reads remember the former things of old for i am god and there is none else i am god and there is none like me declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times the things that are not yet done saying my counsel shall stand and i will do all my pleasure what pleases god he does it pleased god to plan the flood in noah's day nearly two thousand years afterwards he planned jesus's substitutionary death beforehand along with his resurrection his future plans for the rapture tribulation battle of armageddon millennium white throne judgment and new jerusalem future home are all steadfast sure and unchangeable we can't stop his will nor delay it or alter it but we can embrace it and prepare for it if you haven't yet done it make your plans to repent of your sins and live with jesus in his future home every nation under heaven is subject to god's will worldly rulers cannot alter god's eternal purposes our lord allows them freedom in decision making but he alone ultimately decides what will happen based upon his eternal plan psalm 33 verses 10 and 11 declares the lord bringeth the council of the heathen to naught he maketh the devices of the people of none effect the council of the lord standeth forever the thoughts of his heart to all generations daniel 2 verse 21 says god alone changes the times and seasons of earthly leaders removing and setting them up after being humbled by god for seven years one of the world's most powerful leaders of all time nebuchadnezzar described god's sovereign will over the earth thusly i bless the most high and i praised and honored him that liveth forever whose dominion is in everlasting dominion and his kingdom is from generation to generation and all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven and among the inhabitants of the earth and none can stay his hand or say unto him what doest thou job's life teaches that everything the devil does must first be allowed by god giving us great trust in our heavenly father as we go through trials and tests chapters 1 and 2 show satan having to ask permission to tempt job and god allowed it because he knew in his foreknowledge job would eventually overcome the temptation and not fall to it first corinthians 10 13 says all temptations upon man are similar and shared and god will only allow a test in your life that he has already equipped you to overcome yes god works everything according to his own counsel and pre-plans every event for the spiritual benefit of his children believers ephesians 1 verse 11 says we are predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the council of his own will romans 8 verse 28 deuteronomy 6 verse 24 deuteronomy 8 verse 16 and deuteronomy 10 13 all agree that god works every event for our good always you never have to wonder why good or evil happens to you your heart rests in heaven's assurance that every event that occurs in your life will make you love god more the best way to prove your love to god is by believing in a sovereign will and choosing thankfulness and joy while you go through trials of faith that his infinite wisdom allowed to come to pass jesus promises you peace that passes all understanding and a life free from anxiety as you prayerfully thank god for everything in your life while making your personal request known to him god's known will for man moving to man's perspective of god's will there is a will of god he makes known to men and then a progressive future will men must seek for starting with god's known will he first gives every soul an awareness and thirst for fellowship with him the individual's inward conscience and knowledge of his maker's desire to save his soul makes him thirst to respond to god and seek him he either quenches his soul thirst by seeking and finding christ or hushes and silences it with sinful pleasures god's will is further known through the holy bible which contains all his holy commands simply put god's will is his word notice ephesians 1 verse 9 says the mystery of god's will is purposed in himself and he is the word there are two crucial aspects of god's known will his desire for every human to be saved and then be born again or filled with his spirit first the eternal god wants all men to be saved from hell but in his love will not force anyone to love him in return he will patiently wait until every person who longs to be saved is saved second peter 3 verse 9 states the lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but is longsuffering to us word not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance paul agrees to this in 1st timothy 2 verse 4 who will have all men to be saved and to come unto the knowledge of the truth do not allow the devil to tell you god doesn't love you and doesn't want you saved here's biblical proof he wants you saved trust god and his word for satan is the father of lies and jesus is the faithful and true witness jesus promises it is not the will of your father which is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish jesus wants you and every believer in heaven with him for he said in john 6 40 this is the will of him that sent me that everyone which seeth the son and believeth on him may have everlasting life and i will raise him up at the last day galatians 1 verse 4 says it is god's will to deliver us from this present evil world our god does not delight in the death of the wicked for he wants and pleads for the souls to love him and live ezekiel 33 verse 11 declares say unto them as i live saith the lord god i have no pleasure in the death of the wicked but that the wicked turn from his way and live turn the eternity from your evil ways for why will ye die o house of israel when a soul hears the good news of jesus christ preached and explained he knows the revelation of the mystery of god's known will paul says the revelation of god's will is that all things in heaven and earth will be gathered in christ and believers will have an unending inheritance as they praise jesus glory eternally having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the council of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in christ the second truth about god's known will is his desire for christians and all men to be born again god loves when believers hear the good news accept it and get saved because part of the known will of god is obeyed giving god great pleasure however full redemption is a three-step process justification sanctification and the filling of the holy ghost see chapter five this was tight by israel coming out of egyptian bondage deuteronomy 6 verse 23 says god brought them out to bring them in and he brought us out from thence that he might bring us in to give us the land which he swear unto our fathers jesus brought you out of sin justifying you but he doesn't want you to stop there he wants you to come through the spiritual wilderness of sanctification and into the promised land of the holy ghost baptism in your soul 2 corinthians 5 verse 17 says you are a new creature when you are in christ jesus first commands all to be born again in john 3 verse 7. ye must be born again remember israel leaving egypt she must reach canaan or else she would fall short of god's will then christ invites all to be born again in john 7 verses 37-39 crying if any thirst let him come unto me and drink this spake he of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the holy ghost was not yet given the universal invitation to the new birth is also resounded by the holy spirit and the bride church in revelation 22 17 and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that heareth say come and let him that is a thirst come and whosoever will let him take the water of life freely again cast down any doubt satan puts in your mind about god not wanting to fill you with the holy ghost deny the seducing serpent and accept the loving lamb if you want to obey both aspects to god's known will being saved and spirit filled you need only genuine love all jesus precepts are summarized and fulfilled in one word love in matthew 22 verses 37 through 40 jesus says loving god with all your heart and loving your neighbor fulfills every command three times paul echoes jesus summary saying love is the fulfilling of the law if you can truly love god you will do his will in first john 5 verses 1 through 4 the apostle john writes that being born again is the source of this divine love empowering christians to keep all jesus commands whosoever believeth that jesus is the christ is born of god and everyone that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him by this we know that we love the children of god when we love god and keep his commandments for this is the love of god that we keep his commandments and his commandments are not grievous for whatsoever is born of god overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith friend if you are seeking salvation through jesus christ and the filling of his holy spirit in your soul you can undoubtedly know you're doing the will of god god's known will through the holy bible is your spiritual food after a believer is saved he comes in contact with earth's greatest book the holy bible man begins to satisfy his soul's thirst to know god through daily reading of scripture while meditating upon his readings he finds more of the known will of god some of the following doctrines have been mentioned previously in this book but bear repeating to emphasize their place in your spiritual diet the known will of god let these commands as god's will be your meat or spiritual food jesus says my meat is to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work jesus christ desires or wills all christians to experience sanctification or purification of thoughts and actions also called the second work of grace before a christian is born again as jesus's seed cast into the ground parable teaches mark 4 verses 26 through 28 john 3 verse 7 john 17 verse 17 first thessalonians 4 verse 3 first peter 1 verse 23 abstain from sexual immorality meaning no sexual activity before marriage called fornication no homosexuality and marrying only one person matthew 19 verses 1 through 9 romans 1 verses 26 through 32 first corinthians 6 verses 9 through 11 and 1st thessalonians 4 verses 3 and four find a home church listen to male preachers only and gather increasingly more as the rapture approaches first corinthians 14 verses 34 through 36 1st timothy 2 verses 11 through 15 hebrews 10 verses 24 through 25 give tithes 10 of income and offerings any free will amount to the home church first corinthians 9 verses 9 through 14 abstain from all substance abuse including tobacco alcohol marijuana etc romans 14 verse 21 first corinthians 3 verse 17 first corinthians 6 verses 19 and 20 and first corinthians 8 13 abstain from wicked and lustful movies and television shows psalm 101 verse 3 first thessalonians 5 verse 22 where modest clothing proverbs 7 verse 10 first timothy 2 verse 9. allow the correct hair length for gender uncut hair for women and short hair for men first corinthians 11 verses 1 to 16 keep three physical ordinances water baptism feet washing and communion mark 16 verse 16 john 13 14 first corinthians 11 verses 23-26 pray continually express thanksgiving fast and give alms to the poor matthew 6 verses 1 through 21 first thessalonians 5 verses 17 and 18. financially support oneself if single or their families by working hard to supply their needs first timothy 5 verse 8 first thessalonians 4 verses 11 and 12 obey government laws unless they contradict god's commands acts 5 verse 29 first peter 2 verses 13 through 15 worship god in the spirit and in truth john 4 verses 23 and 24 plainly stated if you're guilty of breaking any of these commands you're disobeying god's will committing sexual sin skipping church gatherings abstaining from charitable giving smoking drinking dressing and modestly and breaking the law put you out of god's will for your life it's possible you're learning about these commands for the first time if so know that it's god fulfilling prophecy from matthew 17 verse 11 acts 3 verse 21 and malachi 4 verses 5 and 6. the lord promised to restore all biblical truths in the last days he loves you and wants you to know truth god orchestrated his mysteries to be finished in your lifetime so he could lead you to the revealed word for your day see chapter 13. he's getting his bride ready for her rapture wedding day god has made a way for you to know his plan to restore all things and be established in the present truth be like your messiah who focused on and sought after god's will saying i seek not mine own will but the will of the father which has sent me john 6 38 teaches christ's purpose for coming down from heaven was not to do mine own will but the will of him that sent me that's your purpose as well and peter says you lived for your own will before being saved but now that you're a christian you live for god's will that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men but to the will of god have a humble hungry heart like david who said teach me to do thy will in psalm 143 verse 10 ask god for wisdom to understand his will and he'll bountifully give it to you ephesians 5 verse 17 states wherefore be not unwise but understanding what the will of the lord is james 1 verse 5 promises if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of god that giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not and it shall be given him patience is the key attribute you need as you follow god's will god's order for answering prayers is ask in prayer do god's will wait and then receive the promise hebrews 10 verses 35 through 38 declares this truth cast nine away therefore your confidence which hath great recompense of reward for ye have need of patience that after you have done the will of god you might receive the promise forget a little while and he that shall come will come and will not tarry now the just shall live by faith but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him the stature of a perfect man in connection to the known will of god through peter's stature of a perfect man teaching you can know your spiritual location in the known will of god hebrews chapter 4 types israel's journey from egypt to canaan as the christians growth from sinner to holy ghost-filled saint hebrews 4 verse 11 tells us to labor to enter into that rest as israel labored to reach canaan jesus says he gives us rest for our souls in matthew 11 29 which must be the holy ghost baptism he repeatedly urged his disciples to receive breathing receive ye the holy ghost just as moses joshua and caleb could know exactly where they were on their journey whether the baptism at the red sea the wilderness of sanctification at the border of canaan or crossing jordan so can you know where you stand with god chapter 5 explained god's eight-step plan for bringing christians from salvation to the new birth called the stature of a perfect man faith the first work of grace comes at the moment you get saved and water baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ then you begin the second work of grace called sanctification herein god imparts or adds more character attributes of his own life to yours virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness and brotherly kindness the third work of grace is the baptism of the holy ghost or god's charity his love coming to dwell in your soul remember paul said god has already made known to us the mystery of his will you know it's god's will for you to be saved faith sanctified virtue through brotherly kindness and spirit-filled born again with charity two principles governing god's progressive will for man after following god's known will being saved spirit-filled and obeying the bible doctrines you naturally begin to wonder what else god has in store for the rest of your life god's future plans for your life can be called the progressive will of god the plans are eternally known to god but unknown to you he reveals his future desires to you as you seek his guidance traveling on your earthly pilgrimage abraham is your example for seeking god's progressive future will god called him to leave his country and family and he didn't know where he was going hebrews 11 8 says abraham was called out and obeyed not knowing whether he went abraham obeyed the known will of god but god didn't tell him all the details about his travels nor his final destination abraham was content seeking god's progressive will daily and as a spiritual faith child of abraham you'll do the same be faithful to god's most recent revelation of his will until the next revelation comes as abraham live by faith moving from city to city you live from faith to faith from revelation to revelation from glory to glory two principles govern god's progressive will it'll align perfectly with his known will revealed in the holy bible and will happen in his ordained time and season god's future will always harmonizes with his known will expressed in holy scripture and also through the prophets satan's threefold temptation of christ in matthew 4 exemplifies this truth about obeying the known word one particular temptation was for christ to immediately rule over the nations rather than wait jesus knew he'd rule the nations at some point in the future but was it now how did jesus know god's progressive will in the exact moment of temptation jesus triumphed over the wicked one not by miracles but by obeying the known will of god which said to never worship anyone but god in second samuel 6 david attempted to bring the ark of the covenant into jerusalem but his first attempt failed causing uza's death for one reason he disobeyed the known will of god that said the ark must be carried on the shoulders of the levites david first put the ark on a new cart but when the oxen shook it and uza touched the ark to steady it god smote him three months after the tragedy david fully obeyed the known will of god pleasing god this time he again worshiped god with all his might in the same manner he previously did and brought the ark to jerusalem with joy in daniel 9 verses 1 and 2 daniel was seeking god to know his progressive will for his people israel how did daniel know god was going to soon move on israel's behalf and let them return to jerusalem verse 2 says he knew the 70-year exile period was about up due to reading jeremiah's books god's progressive will for israel was known by one prophet daniel through its harmony with another prophet jeremiah jeremiah's victory over the false prophet hananiah in jeremiah 28 is an example of god's progressive will aligning with his own previous prophecies how did jeremiah know hananiah was wrong by saying god would break nebuchadnezzar's yoke upon israel within two years he knew because god had already spoken the yoke would last 70 years through jeremiah's own lips showing a true prophet's prophecies will always agree with his previous predictions spoken in the lord's name applying this to your life means no matter how strongly you may feel about a potential decision first see if it obeys god's known will for example if you're a woman and someone pleads with you to cut your long uncut hair for any reason even to help make wigs for cancer patients you know not to because of god's known will rather than cutting your hair god's word says to lay your hands on the sick in prayer and ask for healing or if you're a married man and you're tempted to commit adultery with another man's wife or divorce your wife and remay or another you know it's not god's progressive will god's known will command you to remain married to one wife until death never trust a sign or wonder if it contains instructions that disagree with god's known will deuteronomy 13 verses 1 through 5 expresses this lesson as moses tells israel not to follow a prophet who urges you to worship false gods even if he shows a sign or wonder that comes moses says it's a test of your love for god if you love god you'll always keep the known will of god as you're trying to discern his progressive will signs and wonders and the messages that follow must all harmonize with god's known will as exodus 4 verses 8 and 9 demonstrate god's signs have a voice or instructions that follow them and they will always point you to holiness and obedience perhaps you have a beautiful dream you think comes from god and it's allowing you to break his word jesus himself might appear in the dream but if the command is against scripture you know it's satan disguised as an angel of light don't trust any dream nor angel or preacher if they contradict jesus's holy words in the bible god works in specific times and seasons and his progressive will always aligns with his predetermined timing believers must obey god's known will and patiently wait until it's god's time to fulfill his promise you don't want to try and enforce god's will too early nor miss god's moment in which he wants to move one reason god rejected king saul was because he couldn't wait upon god's timing in 1st samuel 13 verses 8 through 14 saul was told to wait seven days for the prophet samuel to come and offer sacrifices before battling the philistines towards the end of the time period saul took it upon himself to offer sacrifices encroaching into the prophet's office as soon as the sacrifices were offered samuel arrived and pronounced god's displeasure with saul forcing himself into an office not assigned to him saul by missing god's progressive will by a few hours lost out on generations of blessings david's adulterous sin with bathsheba happened when he was out of position in the season of battle second samuel 11 verse 1 tells that the kings went out to battle at a particular time of the year but instead of being in position in battle david neglected his position leading to his adultery with bathsheba and murder of uriah this serves as a lesson for christians to be in position or obeying all the known will of god in every season second timothy 4 verse 2 says preach the word be instant in season out of season reprove rebuke and exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine there is also great sin in refusing to act in god's season missing his leading and jesus rebukes a multitude for not discerning his supernatural ministry jesus chides the multitude in luke 12 56 saying ye hypocrites you can discern the face of the sky and of the earth but how is it that ye do not discern this time in my short time as a christian i've seen many erroneously attempt to predict the season of the rapture in 2011 the late herald camping rented billboards across america declaring the rapture would occur on may 21st 2011. it miserably failed the next year 2012 many believe the mayan calendar predicted the world's end but it came and went without a fulfillment blood moons in 2015 were next in line to predict the rapture but this phenomenon came and went without ending history thankfully spirit-filled christians are promised to know the time and season of the rapture based upon first thessalonians 5 verse 1 and don't spend their time trying to force the rapture season to occur service submission and suffering in god's progressive will new christians and sometimes seasoned ones often ask themselves about god's will for their relationships vocations locations ministries and gifts they say who should i marry or what job should i have many ask where should i live and what gifts has god given me these are legitimate worthy questions god knows you're considering and he has answers for all of them you'll have to ask god about some of these subjects and remember to honor the two principles for god's progressive will he'll never ask you to break commands in scripture and everything must be done in his season not yours before diving into knowing god's will for relationships and more understand service submission and suffering are at the heart of god's will for every life you are called to serve and submit to others david's life exemplifies service and new testament authors expound on christian submission and suffering serving others is at the core of your calling for each of these areas for example acts 13 36 states for david after he had served his own generation by the will of god fell on sleep and was laid unto his fathers and saw corruption david's vocation and location are easy to identify as god chosen to be king over all israel in jerusalem because he was a man after god's heart acts 13 verse 22 declares the very reason god chose david was because he knew david would do all of his will i have found david the son of jesse a man after my own heart which shall fulfill all my will david served god's will feeding protecting and judging israel for 40 years david's marriage with bathsheba began in sinful disgrace but god still used this couple to serve his purpose in shaping israel's future their second son solomon was loved of the lord and later became the wisest and richest king of his time period at the end of david's life it was bathsheba's service to god her influence and efforts that stopped adenija from stealing the throne from solomon who eventually ascended to his kingly god-given authority david served god's purpose for both the music and military ministries in first chronicles 15 and 16 david established levitical worship using various instruments to continually and skillfully thank and praise god with his military david served god's purpose for expanding israel's borders to boundaries they were promised under joshua but never achieved until david's lifetime these victories were possible because david always inquired of the lord before battles and each time scripture records him seeking god before battle he was undefeated as you learn to humble yourself and pray before decision making you'll see constant victories as well history affirms david's gifts to write songs and prophecy served god's purpose for his life david contributed more than 70 of the 150 songs in the book of psalm many of which are sung to this day in christian churches worldwide described as a prophet in acts 2 verse 30 david served god's will to foretell many details of jesus crucifixion and resurrection nearly one thousand years beforehand it is also god's will that you submit to others beginning with god james 4 7 commands submit yourselves therefore to god resist the devil and he will flee from you then learn to sacrifice your selfish desires and submit to others ephesians 5 verse 21 says submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of god every christian should submit to godly leadership in their local church obey them that have the rule over you and submit yourselves for they watch for your souls as they that must give account that they may do it with joy and not with grief for that is unprofitable for you peter tells us submission to government is the will of god and silences those who criticize christianity in first peter 2 verses 13-15 submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the lord's sake whether it be to the king as supreme or to governors as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evil doers and for the praise of them that do well for so is the will of god that with well-doing you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men suffering is a necessary but often unwanted part of doing god's will as humans we need a renewed vision of suffering's purpose the lord has chosen suffering as your teacher and his lesson is obedience even god's spotless holy son jesus learned obedience through suffering hebrews 5 verse 8 declares though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered you know jesus is suffering during his gethsemane prayers but this scripture tells us much of his life was spent suffering for the gospel expect suffering in your earthly journey as all that will live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecution there is no escaping suffering for christians as it's required for future responsibility if you hope to reign with and for christ in the millennium embrace your sufferings second timothy 2 verses 11 and 12 says it is a faithful saying for if we be dead with him we shall also live with him if we suffer we shall also reign with him if we deny him he will also deny us peter's first epistle constantly deals with your required suffering chapter 2 verse 20 claims god accepts you when you endure suffering with patience in chapter 3 verses 13-17 the apostle tells you to be happy if you suffer for righteousness sake next first peter 4 verse 19 says to commit the keeping of your soul to god in constant well-doing when you're suffering according to god's will in the times god desires you to suffer remember the vast eternal benefits one benefit is your perfection or completion you'll never be what god intended you to be without a little suffering chapter 5 verse 10 reads but the god of all grace who hath called us unto his eternal glory by christ jesus after that you have suffered a while make you perfect establish strengthen settle you paul says all suffering is only momentary light affliction that produces a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory your suffering allows god's power to manifest through your life paul explains the following order for powerful instances of god's spirit suffering weakness then strength second corinthians 12 verses 1 through 10 provides insight on paul's physical sufferings from a satanic messenger to keep him humble after three prayer requests for it to be removed jesus tells paul his strength is perfect in paul's weakness paul then glories in his weakness because christ's power rested on him you also see how god's power is not always seen in healing the sick or raising the dead sometimes its power to give thanks in the midst of suffering and weakness in everything give thanks for this is the will of god in christ jesus it's through suffering that you develop intimacy with christ most christians want to know jesus's power but few his sufferings paul knew both were mandatory philippians 3 verse 10 tells you that i may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death how well do you want to know jesus enough to suffer for him if so you'll not only suffer for him but fellowship with him as he'll never leave you nor forsake you how to find the perfect will of god for your life romans 12 verses 1 and 2 provides two simple steps to finding the perfect will of god for your life i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god observe in verse 2 that there is a perfect will and permissive will of god for your life the perfect will of god is full obedience to the word of god while the permissive will is a path of disobedience and compromise david says the word of god is the lamp unto our feet and light unto our path disobeying god's word and struggling through life in god's permissive will is like losing your light source in the dark and fearfully stumbling about jesus is the only person to ever walk in god's perfect will for his entire life but many saints recorded in scripture spent much of their lives in the perfect will of god such as abraham joseph david daniel and paul these men's lives are marked by constant obedience to god's commands their mistakes god allowed recorded in the bible show brief missteps into the permissive will of god with appropriate consequences but god's grace always guides them back into the perfect will all who willingly disobeyed god's word in bible records are examples of walking the permissive will of god four examples include cain balaam saul and hezekiah the first two men were lost the last two were saved satan inspires people into the permissive will of god for they choose their own will over gods lucifer said i will five times in isaiah 14 verses 12 through 15 like christ and say i will do god's will not my will cain disdained god's perfect will requiring animal sacrifice before murdering his brother abel the son of the wicked one cain even turned down god's plea for his repentance in a personal supernatural encounter with the holy one balaam heard god's first command his perfect will to avoid visiting balak but prayed again to see if god would allow it the lord gave him permission to take the permissive will and go see balak but balaam was ultimately slain in disgrace for his sins king saul started his kingship in great victory and obedience but ultimately rebelled against god's direct commands causing him to lose out on god establishing his kingdom forever king hezekiah lived in the perfect will of god for much of his life but staggered into the permissive will of god when he asks for more years for his life once granted 15 more years hezekiah catered to the babylonian ambassadors showing them all the treasures in the lord's house the first step in finding god's perfect will is to present your body as a living sacrifice unto god paul says to consider god's mercy and then willingly offer your body to god for his service sacrificing opportunities to make your body feel good god won't force you to offer yourself but his mercy will plead with you to do so this means forcing your body to serve god when your body sin nature doesn't want to usually this equates to eating less food and eating the healthy kinds when you do and voluntarily starving your body at times called fasting by jesus in matthew 6 18 benefits of fasting are many including powerful healing and deliverance focused to feed the poor and getting answers from god since you're a living sacrifice your altar is also your own personal cross in luke 9 verse 23 christ says if any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me your cross is the loss of your desires for the next verse says for whosoever will save his life shall lose it but whosoever will lose his life for my sake the same shall save it you must learn to let god lead your life every single day he will lead you only into holy separation not lust of the flesh also keep your body out of harm's way avoid all appearances of evil not walking in lasciviousness lusts excess of wine reveling banquetings and abominable idolatries keep your body out of bars sporting events concerts movie theaters and all sinful gatherings control your work hours as well satan has enslaved many a well-meaning christian into the idolatry of money making and position seeking indeed if you're to be a sacrifice and reasonably serve god's purpose for your life something has to die you must die daily as paul says i die daily remember your living sacrifice which requires a daily crucifixion of your lusts and selfish will secondly your mind needs renewed daily though our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day jesus says to seek the kingdom of god first so pray and read your bible first every morning reading your bible once a week isn't enough daily reading is essential to renew your mind this daily renewing of your thinking causes your spiritual transformation recall your mind has five channels conscience memory reason affection and imagination second corinthians 10 verses 4 and 5 says any evil thought pattern or mental complex that exalts itself against god's word must be pulled down cast down and forgotten through the mighty weapon of god's word when satan floats a hurtful memory near your mind cast it down if you're building a complex by imagining someone's hatred for you and planning how to counter a possible attack pull down that sinful stronghold if you're affectionately admiring and coveting earthly riches cast on those thoughts and set your affections on things above yes the key to mind renewal is simply putting off old sinful thoughts or the old man and putting on the new man or new holy thought according to ephesians 4 verses 22-24 that ye may put off concerning the former conversation the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts and be renewed in the spirit of your mind and that you put on the new man which after god is created in righteousness and true holiness give your mind holy to the word think upon all eight of paul's subjects whatsoever is true honest just pure lovely of good report virtuous and praiseworthy meditate all day and pray without ceasing you now see doing god's perfect will requires complete consecration of your body presented as a living sacrifice and mind daily renewed you know your being has three parts body mind spirit and soul but did you notice how paul never mentioned the soul of man in romans 12 verses 1 and 2. the reason is because paul knew the christian soul was already housing god's nature sealed by his holy spirit which directs all actions a christian soul is already perfect before god it cannot sin for possesses god's own seed his life paul is showing you how to bring your two outward parts into subjection to your inner core your soul prayer is one indispensable tool to know god's will in jesus model prayer he says the daily pray for god's kingdom to come and his will to be done in earth as it is in heaven in fact jesus says this kind of consistent prayer will be hard to find on the earth at a second coming so be one of those faithful prayer warriors praying jesus's way through the holy spirit raises your faith and faith does the works god desires for your life jude 1 verse 20 states but ye beloved building up yourselves on your most holy faith praying in the holy ghost paul writes in ephesians 2 verse 10 god created you to do his will or good works for we are his workmanship created in christ jesus unto good works which god hath before ordained that we should walk in them through your prayers you can support other believers in doing god's will paul's helper epiphanes had this special burden as a prayer warrior in colossians 4 verse 12. epiphanus who is one of you a servant of christ saluteth you always laboring fervently for you in prayers that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of god paul prayed similarly for the colossians for this cause we also since the day we heard it do not cease to pray for you and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding if you can't do anything else to help others you can pray for them to do all the will of god proving god's perfect will in your relationships vocations locations ministries and gifts daily renewing of your mind leads to transformed living equipped with a transformed being a fully consecrated body and mind you can now prove god's perfect will for your life as he progressively reveals it to you you won't have to guess about it you'll know and do jesus's perfect will always diligently obey all the known will of god before deciding upon relationships vocations locations ministries and gifts relationships paul's first letter to the corinthians helps establish god's will for relationships chapter 7 addresses virgins the unmarried married and the widowed read the whole chapter for a complete understanding single believers should pray and seek god to know whether they have the gift to be single or whether they should seek marriage marriage is the second most important decision you'll make in life outside of salvation so pray fast and seek god before agreeing to mary quote james 1 verse 5 aloud in prayer and god will freely give you the wisdom to know whom to marry and when it's crucial to know that your vow to marry a person cannot be broken too often engagements become official and then are broken off this is sin because a promise or vow is what marries two people in god's sight matthew 1 verses 18 through 20 shows the power of the vow as the angel of the lord appeared to joseph in his dream called mary his wife and they were only espoused or engaged numbers 30 offers added insight on vows if you're single in committing fornication with your partner you know you are out of god's will it's not wise to jump into marriage with a partner just so you can have sexual relations without seeing if god is leading you to marry this person stop fornicating begin living in sanctification and wait upon the lord for his will if you are already in a marriage relationship and you wonderfully come to christ as a new convert paul says to stay married even if your spouse is not a christian he encourages you that your sanctified life may help win your spouse and children to christ notice paul emphasizes how marriage is about pleasing and serving your spouse through love when marriage infatuation ends let god's love motivate you to serve and please your mate malachi 2 verse 16 says god hates divorce and anyone who divorces and remarries another becomes adulterers and if left unconfessed keeps them from the kingdom of god jesus teaches the only occasion a person can remarry after divorce is a man who puts away his wife due to unconfessed fornication committed before marriage read matthew 5 verses 31 and 32 and matthew 19 verses 1 through 9 for more on this this one and only divorce and remarry clause exist because the woman made a false vow claiming to be pure when she wasn't joseph and mary best teach this truth as he was going to put her way for fornication but god supernaturally intervened to validate mary's virginity adultery is not a cause for remarriage only unconfessed fornication according to jesus christ all marriage vows last until death god's will for parents is to diligently love teach discipline and provide for their children read proverbs 19 verse 18 proverbs 20 verse 11 proverbs 22 6 proverbs 22 15 proverbs 23 verse 13 proverbs 29 verses 15 through 17 proverbs 29 verse 21 and colossians 3 21 for these truths psalm 127 verses 1 through 5 proclaimed children are god's heritage possession rewards from his creative hand and are arrows you must sharpen increasing their godly character to defeat future enemies for all non-family relationships endeavor to live at peace with all men as much as possible have answers ready for those who ask about your faith and season them with grace jesus says bless and love enemies rather than cursing them overcoming evil with good vocations god's will for your job can be an urgent question for some know first that parenting is the most important vocation if you have children never abandon your child the rod and reproof give wisdom but a child left to himself bringeth his mother to shame if the choice is between more money through a job or staying at home to parent your children and have less choose less in the natural and more in the spiritual you can work the rest of your life after your children grow up love and invest in your children's souls while there is hope proverbs 19 verse 18 admonishes chasten thy son while there is hope and let not thy soul spare for his crying as with relationships ask god for wisdom when deciding upon a vocation if you love god he'll use your choices for his glory and all will work together for your good be open to god doing something different from your first plans you might follow in your parents footsteps like jesus working as a carpenter paul made and sold tents luke was a physician matthew was a tax collector peter was a fisherman and lydia was a seller of purple god will provide a vocation for you too no matter the vocation god's will is for you to work diligently as if you're working for him ecclesiastes 9 verse 10 says whatsoever thy hand findeth to do do it with thy might for there is no work nor device nor knowledge nor wisdom in the grave wither thou goest paul expresses the same urgency in romans 12 verse 11 not lawful in business fervent in spirit serving the lord ephesians 6 verse 6 records paul's instructions for servants to serve from their hearts not with eye service as men pleasers but as the servants of christ doing the will of god from the heart always remember your vocation is not given you to become rich it's not a sin to be wealthy nor to be poor but god's goal for you is contentment first timothy 6 6 teaches but godliness with contentment is great gain money is a means to an end the end is loving god and your fellow man god loves a cheerful giver locations where should you live this answer is most often determined by your vocation but no god determined your physical location so you would learn to seek him acts 17 verses 26 and 27 declares and hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth and hath determined the times before appointed and the bounds of their habitation that they should seek the lord if haply they might feel after him and find him though he be not far from every one of us god determined your starting location so trust him to guide all the places you'll inhabit you might never leave the region of your birth or there may be surprises about your future dwellings abraham by god's will moved at least 15 times from ur to egypt to damascus to hebron despite the constant activity from his many movings he was a friend of god and father of faith it wasn't easy for joseph when god allowed him to be sold into slavery at age 17. he was completely surprised and his life was turned upside down joseph was moved from canaan across the sinai peninsula to egypt god's purpose for joseph's life as savior of many lives caused his move all god-directed moves glorify god and position man for his service lot nephew of abraham demonstrates the importance of your physical location in genesis 13 lot and abraham agreed they could not live together due to spacing limits so lot chose the well-watered plains of jordan and pitched his tent towards sodom this turned out to be a disastrous choice as eventually he lost his wife turned into a pillar of salt and other family members in fire and brimstone lot's location choice seemed to be made upon financial prospects only he may have prospered financially but suffered great loss spiritually he was daily vexed by the things he saw and heard especially the violent homosexual lifestyle of sodom's men choose to put your family among godly people and influences even if it means less money and benefits let your place of worship your home church be a major factor in your location frequent increasing gathering with christians while hearing live preaching from the fivefold ministry is god's will for your life so choose a location that allows you to fulfill this command satan wants to scatter the sheep congregation from their shepherd pastor so his wolves can devour the flock your location should allow you to have a pastor and church family you regularly serve and worship with ministries important christian ministries outside local church ministry include missionary work prayers and providing relief for the poor and needy ask god which ministry you are to support fulfill jesus command to seek first the kingdom of god god's will must be sought for each move in missionary work for instance some have said all missionary efforts are the will of god acts 16 verse 6 proves otherwise as paul is forbidden of the holy ghost to preach the word in asia while on a second missionary trip god's will for paul cut him off from doing missionary work in asia minor at that time acts 13 verses 1 through 3 shows paul fasting denying his body food before deciding where to go and who to take with him on his trips you must constantly see god's progressive will in every ministry effort for missionary efforts you'll find paul frequently leaning on god's will and timing for his visits he knew everything had to be done in god's time and season not his christians must recognize and accept the same paul tells the romans he's hoping for a prosperous journey by the will of god to come unto them with joy by the will of god so they could all be refreshed he wanted to visit his christian family but everything depended upon god's will his actual ability to visit provisions joy and refreshment your every missionary or evangelistic trip should follow this pattern prayer is a crucial ministry for saints as paul prayed and fasted before trips but all saints can join in praying to heaven for successful missionary efforts and general christian needs acts 12 records the unceasing prayers of the church during peter's imprisonment and in response god sent an angel to rescue him out of prison providing relief to the poor needy is a god called ministry referred to as helps in first corinthians 12 28. in the greek helps means aid relief jesus calls this almsgiving and saints like joanna tabitha phoebe and the macedonian christians are examples of relief ministries joanna wife of chuza herod steward teamed up with susannah and many others to provide food and other needs for jesus as he preached in cities and villages tabitha was full of good works and alms deeds making coats and garments for the needy paul urged the romans to assist phoebe in her business of securing or aiding the needy for she had previously helped meet paul's needs paul rejoices in the efforts of the deeply poor macedonians who sent paul and his ministry provisions scripture says the macedonians first gave themselves to the lord and then unto paul by the will of god this harmonizes with this entire chapter as you find god's will after you yield yourself completely to him this pattern of saints non-preachers helping and supporting preachers is foundational as seen in jesus ministry luke 8 and in acts new converts saw such holiness in the preachers and cared so much for other believers that they laid financial offerings at the apostles feet assured the money would be used wisely for god's kingdom the twelve apostles in the early church soon ordained deacons through prayer and reports of honest men to provide relief to hungry christians in acts 6 verses 1 through 8. take paul's advice and find within your home church a family who diligently serves the needy and then offer to help them first corinthians 16 verses 15 and 16 says i beseech you brethren you know the house of stephanus and that it is the first fruits of a chao and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints that you submit yourselves unto such and to everyone that helpeth with us and laboreth stephanus's addiction to serving believers was a testimony that refreshed paul's spirit would to god adults and teenagers would be addicted to serving others by the will of god rather than suffering addiction to drugs and alcohol be like david serving your generation by the will of god gifts of the holy ghost paul lists the nine gifts of the holy ghost in first corinthians 12 verses 8 through 10. gifts are extraordinary powers god bestows upon all to help all paul teaches gifts are given to every man to profit others romans 11 29 says god gives gifts and callings regardless of whether a person repents or not your gifts are in you before birth two people have told me they knew i was a preacher before i stepped into the pulpit to minister a high school friend said she saw a leadership gift in my life even when i was a sinner seven years before i began preaching years later a pastor's wife told me she knew i'd be a preacher the very first time we met well before i even considered preaching jeremiah 1 verse 5 is true god knew us before our birth and ordained us for his purpose since your gift is not for yourself you only operate it in love seek not to use your gift for your benefit but use your gift that sinners might testify to god's manifest presence god gives you a gift or gifts because there is a need for your service you'll never have to force your gift into a situation or church ministry because proverbs 18 verse 16 declares a man's gift maketh room for him and bringeth him before great men your gift has a god-ordained place for it to fit into gifts edify or build the church and keep it clean paul says prophecy is greater than one person's ability to speak in tongues because it helps more believers i would that ye all spake with tongues but rather that ye prophesied for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues except he interpret that the church may receive edifying peter's gift of discernment cleaned the spirit of deception out of the early church when ananias and sapphira tried to lie to him afterwards great fear came upon all the church and upon as many as heard these things many seek gifts like unknown tongues rather than the giver of the gifts jesus christ seek first to be born again and afterwards follow charity desiring spiritual gifts get born from above and god will naturally lead you to using your gifts first corinthians 14 verse 1 proves this follow after charity and desire spiritual gifts but rather that ye may prophesy you should not be ignorant of gifts and it is godly to desire the best gifts so that more saints are helped while everyone has a gift the apostle also stresses realistically assessing your portion of faith or whichever gift you possess our gifts have different measures of power your faith might move mountains while mine moves only hills romans 12 6 says to operate your gift according to the proportion of your faith another's gift of healing might cure a cancer case while another might relieve a headache in his wisdom jesus gave differing amounts of talents to each person and we must happily invest in our portion definitions and examples of the nine gifts all nine gifts will now be defined accompanied by both bible and real life examples the word of wisdom listed first by paul wisdom is the chief gift because it manages all others solomon says it is the principle thing god honors solomon because he asked for wisdom and wrote proverbs a treasure trove of practical wisdom however he had only the gift of wisdom and in his later years he failed to apply it to his life when his many wives turn his heart from the lord jesus christ is the fullness and essence of wisdom this ability sometimes referred to as sound advice manifests skill and discretion in timely decision making jesus says wisdom is validated by the results it bears saying wisdom is justified of her children the bible says wisdom hath builded her house and a wise man builds his house upon a rock like a project manager building a house wisdom tells you what to do and when to do it here are some examples jesus's answer about paying taxes to caesar and also giving money to god matthew 22 verses 15 through 22 the wise virgins preparing extra oil for light in case the bridegroom tarried while the foolish neglected to prepare matthew 25 verses 1-13 paul's perception to share his belief in the resurrection before a divided angry jewish council thereby saving his life acts 23 verses 6 through 11. a minister said i gave him a word of wisdom about how to decide upon and manage extracurricular activities for his children after he was wrongly accused of being an unfit father another minister said i gave him a word of wisdom to continue in his ministry when he had almost decided to give up the word of knowledge if wisdom tells you how to build a house knowledge is your raw building materials you need both to build a house so you'll find knowledge and wisdom associated together over 30 times in scripture knowledge is information from god usually a scripture from the bible another divine illustration is jesus calling knowledge a key allowing you to enter into the door of god's will in luke 11 52. knowledge is an understanding of god's word needed to possess his promises and escape satan's devices peter says we escape the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the lord and savior jesus christ here are some examples peter and philip both gave scriptural knowledge citing joel 2 verses 28 through 32 and isaiah 53 verses 7 and 8 respectively allowing 3 000 souls and the ethiopian eunuch to enter the door of salvation through repentance and water baptism in acts 2 verses 1 through 47 and acts 8 verses 26 through 40. acts 19 verses 1 through 6 shows paul opening the door of the baptism of the holy ghost to 12 believers in ephesus who previously had no knowledge of the new birth after receiving the knowledge of first corinthians 6 verse 12 god opened the door to my deliverance from tobacco addiction my wife gave me a word of knowledge i shared with the brother struggling to know whether or not he could be both a preacher and deacon setting him free from doubt and allowing god to use him repeatedly in supernatural ways in our assembly faith this gift is an assurance and inner substance of god's desire and power to move obstacles problems sicknesses or adversaries figuratively described as mountains by speaking god's word jesus teaches that faith a revelation of god's will about a specific work makes anything possible here are some examples jesus commends the roman centurion's great faith for requesting jesus to speak the word only for his servant's healing which happened the same hour matthew 8 verses 1-13 paul and a crippled man in lystra both had faith for healing causing paul to loudly command the man to walk for the first time acts 14 verses 7-10 a friend's gift of faith pronounced a barren couple would have a baby after we prayed for them and about a year later their baby boy was born on my birthday similarly one morning in prayer i felt led to command another couple's mountain of baroness to leave and less than a year later they embraced their godsend baby girl after months of battling a critical spirit on a couple in our assembly i felt led to stand by their seats while praying alone in church commanding the evil spirit to leave and 11 days later the husband and officer in our church abruptly resigned and left restoring peace a pastor friend of mine felt led to tell his friend to speak his faith in god's word regarding his hunting trip the day beforehand the hunter spoke an eight-point buck in faith and harvested it the next day the gifts of healing healing is the deliverance from the oppression of the devil from both body and mind as mental torment often causes physical ailments there are numerous gifts of healing such as laying on hands speaking the word and natural remedies divine healing isn't spontaneous which differentiates it from miracles here are some examples saul's mental torment from an evil spirit troubled his body but david's skillful heart playing cast the demon from him first samuel 16 verses 13 through 23 ezekiel 47 verse 12 declares leaves and plants can be used as medicine and figs were used to heal boils second kings 20 verse 7 isaiah 38 21 jesus christ promises to heal the sick when we lay hands on them mark 16 verses 16 and 17. paul prayed and laid his hands on publius's father and he was healed of fever and bloody flux an intestinal infection acts 28 verse 8 women on two separate occasions one in pennsylvania and another in our ohio church were healed of arm weakness or paralysis using jesus's keys to the kingdom in prayer after battling a throat sickness for over a week which hindered me from singing a visiting minister from india prayed for me and i left the church building with full ability to sing and praise god loudly as i preached on divine healing in the service my wife felt god reveal her healing from migraines and through faith and a healthier lifestyle has not suffered from them since the working of miracles these are instant spontaneous manifestations of healings or other phenomenon performed by faith galatians 3 verse 5 says he therefore that ministereth to you the spirit and worketh miracles among you doeth he it by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith jesus's innumerable healing miracles included stopping a woman's bleeding and delivering souls from life-threatening fevers other miraculous phenomenon included raising the dead turning water to wine and multiplying fish and bread more biblical and modern examples include casting out certain types of demons mark 9 verses 38-39 jesus causing a lame man to walk and leap by the hand of peter and john acts 3 verses 1 through 11 and acts 4 verse 16. using handkerchiefs paul had touched to drive out demons from the sick acts 19 verses 11 and 12 god's healing my mother from liver cancer as my father laid his hand upon her and prayed in jesus name in 1988 while praying for the sick and guyana i witness god instantly heal a young mother from a kidney stone as well as an elderly man suffering from arthritis prophecy this ability foretells the future giving believers edification exhortation and comfort prophecies can be spontaneously pronounced aloud with thus saith the holy ghost like agabus in acts 21 verse 11 or god can send a prophetic dream as he did with nebuchadnezzar in daniel chapter 2. when prophecies are pronounced in a public gathering they are to be judged by two or three witnesses according to first corinthians 14 verse 29 and 1st thessalonians 5 verses 19 through 21 here are some examples jesus foretold peter's three denials matthew 26 verses 34 and 75 activists prophesied a famine acts 11 verses 27 through 28. philip had four virgin daughters who prophesied acts 21 verse 9. in 2013 a pastor friend of mine foretold the passing away of numerous preachers during that year my wife and i have had prophetic dreams come to pass warning individuals of satan's snares discerning of spirits this gift judges or distinguishes between the source or motivation behind actions prophecies or words all actions come from either the holy spirit or one of the many unholy spirits fallen angels and discernment identifies if it's from god or a demon whether a spirit of divination lying spirit or other discernment is the gift that judges publicly announce prophecies and interpretations of unknown tongues let the prophets speak two or three and let the other judge hebrews 4 verse 12 likens discernment to a sword that divides a man's soul and spirit and discerns the thoughts and intents of the heart god's word ministers to the unique individual needs of the body human spirit and soul see chapter 5 discernment allows secrets of hearts to be made manifest below are some biblical and modern examples solomon used a sermon to reveal the good intentions of the real mother of a baby when another woman falsely claimed to be its mother first kings 3 verses 16-28 jesus discerned both nathaniel's guileless spirit and the woman at the wells sexual immorality with six men john 1 verses 47 through 51 and john 4 verses 4 through 29 peter exercised a sermon by revealing ananias secret lie and simon the sorcerer's wicked heart condition in acts 5 verses 1 through 5 and acts 8 verses 18-24 paul says sinners will recognize god's spirit in a local church when their secrets are revealed through gifts of prophecy interpretation and discernment first corinthians 14 verses 24 and 25 through dreams god gave a couple in our church discernment about the source of contention in a matter likening the evil spirit as a wolf acts 20 verses 29 and 30. god help me discern and deny a lying spirit on a former church member when he requested permission to share his false teachings in front of the church to draw away members after his group diverse kinds of tongues this gift allows believers to speak in unknown or known human languages or even tongues of angels jesus promised believers would speak in new tongues in mark 16 17. tongues may be given in public worship but only if they are interpreted and judged paul says publicly spoken tongues without interpretations create a barbaric insane atmosphere with no interpreter tongues are strictly for private prayer and individual edification first corinthians 12 30 says not all christians speak with tongues paul strongly supported prophetic interpreted tongues because they edify the entire church rather than just one believer on the day of pentecost the 120 spirit-filled believers were speaking in unknown tongues so the hears from 17 different regions could hear them in their own native languages all tongues were known and understood you can speak in an unknown tongue at the moment you're born again but it should be understood by here close by modern churches err greatly when they allow instant constant and uninterpreted tongues in public services leading to confusion and chaos which god does not author below is a list of examples where tongues were used appropriately while peter preached at corneos's house the holy ghost fell upon the hears who spoke in tongues and magnified god acts 10 verses 44-48 paul laying hands on 12 ephesians who being filled with the holy ghost spoke in tongues and prophesied acts 19 verses 1-6 in 2010 a visiting minister to our church spoke in an unknown tongue and interpreted it with three people testifying the message was a warning to them about their spiritual backsliding three other times our church has had unknown tongues spoken and we've prayed for interpretations as paul commanded in first corinthians 14 13 but none came and we are always open to more interpretation of tongues this gift directly connects to diverse kinds of tongues the examples above also apply to it begin seeking god first to be born again and afterwards seek to know his gift or gifts in your life paul says follow after charity and desire spiritual gifts you might have more than one gift as paul had multiple gifts including speaking in tongues miracles and divine healing remember with love is your motivation you're commanded to desire and covet gifts first corinthians 12 31 reads but covet earnestly the best gifts and yet show i unto you a more excellent way may you covet god's supernatural power and ministry in both your daily life and church services study god's way to use your gifts and prayerfully ask god to help you operate them after you double the impact of your spiritual gifts jesus will say well done thou good and faithful servant thou hast been faithful over a few things i will make thee ruler over many things enter thou into the joy of thy lord my testimony about finding god's will for my life reading my testimony about finding god's will may help you find his will for yours currently i'm 40 years old happily married with eight children my two vocations are teaching in public school and pastoring a small church humbly i truly believe with all my heart i'm living in god's perfect will for my life how did i get here relationship my wife and i joke we met in a sandbox because we were both long jumpers in track and began dating in 1998 at 17 and 15 years old respectively we weren't saved at this point but we knew we shared a special bond after i left for college we both repented and gave our hearts to jesus christ on the same night completely unaware of it she and toledo and me in columbus we had obeyed god's known will for salvation but was it god's will for us to be married before our engagement we had been dating for over four years and we had seriously prayed asking god to show us his will for our relationship we were both open to god separating us as well since we wanted only his will after multiple conversations i had with pastors and married couples god's peace settled into my heart that i did not want to live without her i admired everything about her and knew her strengths would complement my weaknesses our wedding in june of 2003 still stands as the second happiest day of my life right after the day we were saved from our sins through faith in jesus christ vocations while on college visits i realized i didn't want to become a doctor as i had previously hoped completely naive to the workload after my first college semester in akron jesus wonderfully saved my soul but i was still undecided on my major trying course after course i joined a friend in a child development class and instantly fell in love with the classroom it became a joy to go to class and learn about teaching and learning in 2004 god supernaturally opened up a teaching position for me right out of college when jobs were scarce and despite hundreds of applicants seeking it multiple parents have told me having their child in my classroom was the answer to their prayers additionally the lord has inspired me to help lead two bible clubs one before school at the middle school and one after school at an elementary building hundreds of children and teens have heard the gospel of jesus my second job is pastoring as my friends and i started our own church in 2006 and i've served as the only pastor the reason i knew god had called me to preach was because i began to feel a strong burden to minister after receiving an invitation to preach i prayed and fasted asking god to clearly show me if he was calling me the lord answered in full assurance seconds before i began preaching jesus anointed a sister in the audience to give a loud word of discernment making known the very subject i was going to preach at the sermon's conclusion the altar was full of saints repenting seeking deliverance and more i've known it's god's will for me to preach ever since locations i've lived in only two ohio locations my entire life toledo and akron you know god brought me to college in akron before mercifully saving me but you might be surprised to know he used a full-ride football scholarship to do it being that my parents were divorced our family was poor and it was impossible for me to attend college without it being paid for i now see god's hand in the scholarship to move me away from all that i ever knew and loved this separation showed me my need for jesus's love and guidance and he was also providing a pastor for his small akron church after my 2004 college graduation and subsequent hiring at a local school district we started the church two years later i've never felt god's leading to leave this city but i am open to god moving my family according to his pleasure ministries my family's main ministry is providing three weekly church services to our akron church members a few my older children have began to serve in music ministry in which i also perform a small role i believe god gave me my eight children for song in the house of the lord and for service of the house of god like a man father of 17 children from the days of david it's my joy to do most of the preaching and all the church's deacon and financial work our church supports missionaries helps the poor needy and provides bible studies for new converts over the past eight years i felt led to work in video making and book writing ministries i waited on these ministries for almost 10 years but since investing heavily into these works god has given us wonderful testimonies of his spirit helping believers around the world gifts you've read some of the testimonies god has done through the gifts of my life whether in preaching or in faith healing or miracles jesus's words in john 15 5 are my testimony to any good happening through my life i am the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and i in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me ye can do nothing i am nothing without jesus absolutely nothing i can honestly say i feel unworthy during the times god has gently and mercifully used me to help others in the moment of any supernatural work jesus has captured my entire thought process and i'm just doing what seems right or natural as romans 12 verses 1 and 2 declares being used of god happens as i lay myself on his altar laying aside my thoughts time plans and preferences my dearest prayer is that i can always be his living sacrifice that he may be exalted more the rewards for receiving the revelation of god's will eternal life is the first and greatest reward for doing the will of god first john 2 verse 17 expresses and the world passeth away and the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of god abideth forever living god's will in this short fleeting life entitles you to an unimaginably amazing eternal life to come a second reward is joining by the new birth and fellowshipping with god's eternal family jesus teaches your spiritual family is in fact your real family while preaching jesus was interrupted and told that his mother mary and siblings were seeking him jesus's answer about who is his true family astounds the hears mark 3 verses 33-35 says and he answered them saying who is my mother or my brethren and he looked round about on them which sat about him and said behold my sister and my brethren for whosoever shall do the will of god the same as my brother and my sister and mother doing god's will makes you a part of his forever family natural family relationships are important but pale in comparison to being in god's spiritual family you must love jesus your savior more than anyone else jesus knew his preaching would divide family relationships within houses but whosoever shall deny me before men him will i also deny before my father which is in heaven think not that i am come to send peace on earth i came not to send peace but a sword for i am come to set a man at variance against his father and the daughter against her mother and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law and a man's foes shall be they of his own household he that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me and he that taketh not his cross and fouleth after me is not worthy of me in this life you'll benefit from being in god's family when peter tells jesus he's left everything for him implying about his losses jesus informs him of his gains in mark 10 verses 29-30 and jesus answered and said verily i say unto you there is no man that hath left house or brethren or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for my sake and the gospels but he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time houses and brethren and sisters and mothers and children and lands with persecutions and in the world to come eternal life holy ghost-filled christians have great heavenly inheritances awaiting them but all inherit a loving family in this earthly journey more rewards for doing god's will include being blessed by god abiding in his love and assurance that jesus hears our prayers our lord promises those who do his will and teach others to do the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven as you confidently wait upon god's will for a little while you gain three more great rewards first you eventually receive the promise whether it's a bodily healing knowledge of whom to marry or financial supply hebrews 10 verses 35 through 38 notes cast not away therefore your confidence which hath great recompense of reward for ye have need of patience that after ye have done the will of god you might receive the promise for yet a little while and he that shall come will come and will not tarry now the just shall live by faith but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him while patiently waiting for god to make his progressive will known and manifest your promise the second reward of renewed strength isaiah 40 31 says but they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary and they shall walk and not faint hasty believers who try to force their will instead of waiting on god's will grow weaker in faith not stronger jesus strengthens your faith as you wait upon his time and season the third reward is understanding god's progressive will as paul describes in ephesians 5 verses 14-21 with christ's light of understanding you walk precisely in god's will redeeming the time notice paul separates wise from foolish by their use of time just like jesus separates the wise and foolish virgins wise virgins use their time to do exactly god's will for their lives you can understand your purpose doing god's will moses says the same as paul telling israel that god's commands are your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the nations your life makes sense as you read the bible for god's known will for your life and pray for his progressive will in john 7 verses 16 and 17 jesus says you gain a witness inside your being when you do god's will you'll feel know and understand true doctrine through the spirit's presence in your soul the consequences for rejecting the revelation of god's will the most serious consequence of rejecting god's known will is being lost to hell and eternally separated from god via the lake of fire jesus's teaching about true and false prophets in matthew 7 verses 13 through 29 explains the severe punishment for false prophets who have enough faith in god to operate their spiritual gifts correctly yet afterwards devote their lives to iniquity verses 21-23 read not everyone that saith unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven many will say to me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works and then will i profess unto them i never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity it's not enough to do miracles and operate spiritual gifts god wants simple humble obedience to his will both known and progressive the evils of these false prophets are the worst because they knew god's will and blatantly refused to obey loving sin more than righteousness a second consequence is unfulfilled potential which applies to the saved or foolish virgins who are truly christians but live with some disobedience to god's will they could have potentially attended the wedding supper but failed to prepare enough oil or live close enough to god's will to receive the baptism of the holy ghost jesus also says they miss out on producing fruit likening them to having thorny hearts which care for the world riches and pleasures more than christ king saul is a prime example of falling short of his potential yet being saved samuel promised saw he would be saved with him in paradise after his death in battle but saul lost out on untold blessings wasting years embroiled with jealousy and murderous hatred for his son-in-law david god would have established saul's kingdom forever if only he had done his will a third consequence is inward confusion sadness sorrow and grief mark 10 verses 17-25 records jesus offering the highest calling in the church apostle to the rich young ruler parallel passages prove jesus love this man as he kept nearly all the commandments but to gain god's will for his life and the eternal life he lacked jesus asked him to forfeit his trusts and riches which the man refused verse 22 says and he was sad at that saying and went away grieved for he had great possessions although he may have grown to possess even greater riches he would always possess an even greater sorrow for turning down eternal life he may have even kept the commands on giving his money in tithes and offerings to the temple which would have been a sacrifice but he always lived with the grief of loving money more than jesus obedience to god's will is greater than sacrifice you can live in the joy assurance and confidence of obedience conclusion god's power is limitless and he's predestined and ordained everything in human history and your life perfectly weaving his sovereign will with man's freemore agency he chose the location of your nativity that you'd respond to his loving invitation to be saved and know him intimately you might go from the shepherd's field to the throne like david or from pharisee fame to the prison like paul but you can trust jesus plan purposes timing and commands you easily identify god's known will by simply reading the bible but his progressive will is a mystery you must seek out for yourself it's not a maddening arduous task rather it's a joy comparable to a gold prospector who is guaranteed to strike it rich proverbs 2 verses 4 and 5 illustrates if thou seekest her as silver and searches for her as for hid treasures then shalt thou understand the fear of the lord and find the knowledge of god it's like the queen of sheba enduring travel pains but eventually experiencing the indescribable joy of having all her questions answered by solomon in god's holy presence you're guaranteed to know god's will if you'll search for it as you seek him he promises to be found the infallible christ says everyone that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be opened serve your family church community and generation by god's will live in the perfect will of god and pray like epiphanes for others to obey all of god's will lastly my prayer for you is everyday service to god's will like zechariah prayed in luke 1 verses 71-75 may we serve him without fear in holiness and righteousness before him all the days of our life action steps number one do the known will of god first obeying every bible command repent and be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ if you haven't been saved then go through sanctification the second work of grace so you can be born again by the holy ghost in the third work of grace step two after the new birth develop the daily habits of romans 12 verses 1 and 2 being a living sacrifice taking up your cross and allowing your renewed mind to transform your life step 3 before any decision relationship vocation ministry etc patiently wait on god's timing while keeping every commandment ask seek and knock and jesus will let you receive find your desire and open every door he wants you to walk through
