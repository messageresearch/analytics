[0:10] greetings friends in the name above all
[0:13] names the lord jesus christ
[0:15] the purpose of this video is to explain
[0:17] the four types of revivals that we see
[0:20] described by god's prophet brother
[0:22] branham
[0:23] my prayer is that the content of this
[0:25] video will dissolve any doubts about
[0:27] whether or not the bride of jesus christ
[0:29] is in revival
[0:31] if the souls of the members of the bride
[0:34] are born again
[0:35] their souls will be in a perpetual state
[0:37] of revival unto the day of redemption
[0:40] and bride members will have daily
[0:42] revival in their minds or human spirits
[0:45] but different from these two is the
[0:47] latter rain revival or the anointing of
[0:50] rapturing faith to change the bodies of
[0:52] the holy ghost-filled bride members in a
[0:54] moment and twinkling of an eye
[0:57] and this latter rain revival has not
[0:58] happened yet and it's the revival we're
[1:01] waiting on
[1:03] and also i want to apologize in advance
[1:06] if you hear noises in the background you
[1:07] know the air conditioner runs at times
[1:09] and then i have eight children so you
[1:11] might hear them running upstairs or
[1:12] talking upstairs so i'm sure if you have
[1:15] children you understand that
[1:17] the outline for the video is first we'll
[1:18] look at the four kinds of revivals
[1:22] and second look at how the soul needs
[1:24] one filling or baptism only and not many
[1:27] refillings
[1:30] four different revivals
[1:33] friends it seems god's prophet brother
[1:34] william branham describes at least four
[1:37] different kinds of revivals and there
[1:39] could be more i'm always open to
[1:41] correction
[1:42] the first revival is the national
[1:44] revival of the people living in the
[1:46] united states of america
[1:48] brother branham plainly said with thus
[1:50] saith the lord that a national revival
[1:52] will not take place
[1:54] which matches the book of revelation
[1:56] prophecy in revelation chapter 13 verses
[1:59] 11 through 18 that the united states is
[2:02] the beast out of the land that will
[2:04] cause the mark of the beast to be laid
[2:06] down
[2:07] let's listen to the thus saith the lord
[2:08] quote from jehovah jireh 1961.
[2:16] [Applause]
[2:19] she'll never rise again just sayeth the
[2:23] lord
[2:25] 1956 she made her fatal move
[2:30] we learned from this quote that we
[2:32] should not pray for a nationwide revival
[2:34] in the united states but this quote
[2:36] should not stop us from praying for our
[2:38] lost loved ones to be saved
[2:40] and should not stop us from having
[2:42] revivals that bring them to
[2:43] justification and or sanctification and
[2:46] or the baptism of the holy ghost
[2:49] also this quote should not stop us from
[2:52] praying for our elected leaders and for
[2:54] peace in our countries
[2:56] as well as for souls to be saved as paul
[2:59] said it was good and acceptable to do so
[3:01] in 1st timothy chapter 2 verses 1-4
[3:04] i exhort thee therefore that first of
[3:06] all supplications prayers intercessions
[3:08] and giving of thanks be made for all men
[3:11] for kings and for all that are in
[3:13] authority that we may lead a quiet and
[3:15] peaceful life in all godliness and
[3:17] honesty
[3:18] for this is good and acceptable in the
[3:20] sight of god our savior who will have
[3:22] all men to be saved and to come unto the
[3:24] knowledge of the truth
[3:27] other verses encourage us to keep
[3:28] praying for souls within our nation and
[3:31] of course not a national revival
[3:34] i've recently seen god witness to this
[3:36] truth of praying for individual souls as
[3:39] i prayed numerous times over the past
[3:40] three or four years for the roe vs wade
[3:43] supreme court ruling to be overturned
[3:45] based upon ezekiel 9 verse 4
[3:48] and ezekiel 22 verses 30 and 31 and god
[3:51] heard the many prayers of the saints
[3:53] when roe v wade was overturned on june
[3:56] 24 2022
[3:59] ezekiel 9 4 spoke of sighing and crying
[4:02] for all the abominations done in the
[4:03] midst thereof
[4:04] in ezekiel 22 verses 13 31
[4:08] said god was looking for a man among
[4:09] them that should make up the hedge and
[4:11] stand the gap before god for the land
[4:14] that i should not destroy it
[4:16] and friends we know jesus christ is the
[4:18] same yesterday today and forever meaning
[4:20] we should be praying today sighing and
[4:22] crying for all the abominations done in
[4:24] america and of course every other
[4:25] country we also know god is looking for
[4:27] men and women who will be prayer
[4:29] warriors
[4:30] as kings and priests unto god they'll
[4:31] make intercessions unto god for the
[4:33] individuals in our countries that will
[4:35] still be saved
[4:36] furthermore numerous message churches
[4:38] around the united states and even the
[4:40] world are reporting revivals
[4:43] which i believe in and support as i've
[4:45] been a part of revivals in the past as
[4:47] well
[4:49] the second revival is the bride's
[4:50] revival or latter rain which is yet to
[4:53] come in the future
[4:55] it's my opinion that when brother
[4:56] branham spoke that the bride hasn't had
[4:58] a revival yet
[5:00] he was referring to the last and final
[5:02] revival before the rapture which he
[5:04] taught was the latter rain
[5:06] let's listen to the first quote from the
[5:07] third seal when brother branham says the
[5:09] bride hasn't had a revival yet
[5:12] oh they've got millions and millions and
[5:14] millions of church members but not a
[5:16] revival number
[5:18] no
[5:20] uh the bride hasn't had a revival yet
[5:23] there's been no revival there no
[5:25] manifestation of god to stir the bride
[5:27] yesterday we're looking for him
[5:30] he'll take those seven unknown thunders
[5:32] back there to wake her up again
[5:35] [Applause]
[5:36] he'll send it
[5:40] here's another quote from the first seal
[5:42] where brother branham links
[5:43] rapturing faith with the seven thunders
[5:45] that he had previously mentioned in the
[5:47] third seal quote
[5:48] so again we get a connection between
[5:50] brother branham linking rapturing faith
[5:52] the seven thunders and a revival for the
[5:55] bride together
[5:56] so this would be a different kind of
[5:57] revival this would be the latter rain
[5:59] revival
[6:00] let's listen to the quote
[6:02] all right i believe that through those
[6:05] seven thunders will be revealed in the
[6:08] last days in order to get the bride
[6:10] together for rapture and faith because
[6:13] right now
[6:14] we would be able to do it
[6:16] there's something we've got to step
[6:18] forward there we we can't have enough
[6:20] faith for divine healing hardly we've
[6:22] got to have enough faith to be changed
[6:25] in a moment and be swept up out of this
[6:27] earth
[6:30] and again here's another quote from the
[6:31] first seal linking the rapturing faith
[6:33] to the seven thunders let's listen to
[6:34] the quote
[6:36] but when these seven thunders over in
[6:37] revelation utter he said don't write
[6:39] them at all
[6:41] there are mysteries we don't know what
[6:42] they are yet
[6:44] but my opinion they'll be revealed right
[6:45] away
[6:47] i want to do it it'll give faith to that
[6:48] rapture and grace lecture
[6:52] we've just moved through everything that
[6:54] we know of through all the dispensations
[6:56] we've watched everything we've seen the
[6:57] mysteries of god we've seen the
[6:59] appearing of the of the great uh
[7:01] gathered together of the bride in the
[7:03] last days
[7:06] and friends i also want to say that i
[7:07] believe brother ram grew in his
[7:09] understanding of the seven thunders
[7:11] i believe when he preached about the
[7:12] seven thunders during the seven seals
[7:14] series it was before he had the full
[7:16] understanding of the seven thunders
[7:19] which he told us later in 1964 and also
[7:22] in the church age book he told us the
[7:24] seven thunders were the revelations
[7:26] contained in the seven seals so it's my
[7:29] opinion that we already have the
[7:30] revelation of the seven thunders because
[7:32] we have the revelation of the seven
[7:34] seals according to revelation chapter 10
[7:36] verses one through seven earlier this
[7:38] year i preached two sermons about the
[7:40] seven thunders and the seventh seal
[7:42] please contact me if you'd like a link
[7:44] to those sermons
[7:47] here's two more quotes from the church
[7:49] age book where brother braham says
[7:50] there'll be a showdown at the latter
[7:52] reign and brother branham said there'd
[7:53] be a second forerunner of christ which
[7:55] was his ministry and he would plant for
[7:58] the latter rain or so for the latter
[7:59] rain
[8:00] so brother ram said that in chapter 5
[8:02] and then in chapter 10 brother branham
[8:04] calls the latter rain rapturing faith
[8:06] let's listen to the quotes
[8:09] then in the latter rain will come a
[8:10] mount carmel showdown
[8:12] watch this carefully now to see it in
[8:15] the word
[8:16] john was the forerunner of malachi 3.
[8:19] he planted the former rain and was
[8:20] rejected by the organizations of his day
[8:23] jesus came and had a mount
[8:25] transfiguration showdown
[8:27] the second forerunner of christ will sew
[8:29] for the latter reign
[8:31] jesus will be the showdown between the
[8:32] denominations and creeds for he will
[8:35] come to back up his word and take his
[8:37] bride in the rapture
[8:38] the first showdown was mount carmel
[8:41] the second was the mount transfiguration
[8:44] and the third will be mount zion
[8:47] he is doing it as started in verse 23 by
[8:50] the teaching or former reign
[8:52] next will come to harvest reign or
[8:54] rapturing faith
[8:57] the third revival is the holy ghost
[8:59] baptism revival caused by the message
[9:02] from the holy ghost to the angel or
[9:04] messenger to each church age
[9:07] there are numerous quotes wherein
[9:08] brother branham speaks about the revival
[9:10] that god started in his ministry and how
[9:12] it had not yet denominated and would not
[9:15] denominate
[9:17] this is the third kind of revival which
[9:19] is the holy ghost baptism revival to
[9:21] each church age
[9:24] here's one example from a quote
[9:26] referring to this kind of revival from
[9:28] harvest time 1964. let's listen to the
[9:31] quote
[9:32] listen friends what day are we living in
[9:35] we've had a 15-year revival how many to
[9:37] say amen today
[9:39] what organization raised up
[9:42] none they tried to get me to make an
[9:44] organization brother graham on your
[9:46] ministry it'll be not me i talk about me
[9:48] i'm talking
[9:52] also here's an important quote where
[9:54] brother branham said the bride had
[9:55] already been awakened
[9:57] which is opposite of what he said in the
[9:58] third seal 1963
[10:01] which could mean a couple different
[10:02] things
[10:03] first it could be the revelation of the
[10:05] seven seals awaken the bride's
[10:06] revelation of the bible specifically the
[10:09] finishing of the mystery of god as
[10:11] spoken of in revelation chapter 10 verse
[10:13] 7 or second it could mean the awakened
[10:15] bride in this quote meant the true bride
[10:18] was awakened with the baptism of the
[10:19] holy ghost message that brother branham
[10:21] delivered as the angel or messenger to
[10:24] this church age which i call the third
[10:26] revival for the sake of this video
[10:29] let's listen to the
[10:31] they're quote believing that they will
[10:32] be awakened
[10:34] they're good people
[10:36] why is it
[10:37] what have they done they have not
[10:39] recognized
[10:41] the awakening of the bride
[10:43] the
[10:44] by being a christian they feel the pull
[10:47] of the hour
[10:48] but they haven't recognized what's been
[10:50] done
[10:51] that's what's making them feel that way
[10:54] they know something's supposed to happen
[10:56] but see they're looking for a way off in
[10:58] the future to come when it's already
[11:00] happening right by you
[11:03] a fourth kind of revival is the daily
[11:05] revival we need in our human spirits or
[11:08] minds
[11:09] every single day
[11:11] note specifically this is not a revival
[11:13] of the human soul as i'll teach at the
[11:16] end of this video
[11:17] this is proven by both the holy
[11:18] scripture and quotes from brother
[11:20] branham
[11:21] two scriptures out of others no doubt
[11:23] prove this truth
[11:25] the first is second corinthians 4 16
[11:28] which says though our outward man perish
[11:30] yet the inward man is renewed day by day
[11:34] and the same author saint paul wrote
[11:36] ephesians 4 verse 23 be renewed in the
[11:39] spirit of your mind
[11:41] you never see paul saying renew your
[11:43] soul there's no scripture that says your
[11:45] soul needs renewed every single day
[11:47] here's a quote from how can i overcome
[11:49] 1963
[11:50] uh wherein brother branham taught the
[11:52] same let's listen to the
[11:55] and i quote to take my subject this
[11:57] morning
[11:58] of this how can i
[12:02] overcome
[12:04] now i chose this because
[12:07] i think that it's a time that we should
[12:10] never let the spirit of revival die amen
[12:13] we've got to keep in revival constantly
[12:16] revive every day amen paul said he had
[12:19] to die daily that christ believed and we
[12:22] must
[12:28] the soul needs one filling or baptism
[12:31] only
[12:33] friends some believers think their soul
[12:35] needs refilled and can have many
[12:37] refillings
[12:39] if we rightly divide this idea by the
[12:41] scripture though we find this is not
[12:43] true
[12:44] the truth is the soul gets one filling
[12:47] also called a ceiling
[12:49] or seal unto the day of redemption as
[12:52] taught in ephesians 4 30.
[12:54] it's the human mind or spirit that gets
[12:57] many refillings and really has the
[12:58] potential of this refilling happening
[13:01] every single day
[13:03] notice the new testament never uses the
[13:05] language of
[13:06] refilled in the soul or sealed again
[13:10] or sealed a second time
[13:13] the bible speaks of only one quickening
[13:16] ephesians 2 verses 1 and 5
[13:19] you hathy quickened who were dead in
[13:21] trespasses and sins and verse 5
[13:24] when ye were dead in sins hath quickened
[13:26] us together with christ
[13:28] also colossians 2 verse 13 you being
[13:31] dead in your sins and the uncircumcision
[13:33] of your flesh hath he quickened together
[13:35] with him
[13:37] having forgiven you all trespasses
[13:39] friends search the scriptures the book
[13:41] of acts never says refilled with the
[13:44] holy ghost in their souls
[13:46] so we cannot add to the word of god and
[13:48] say that the soul needs refilled again
[13:50] and again or many baptisms in the soul
[13:52] there's only one baptism in the human
[13:54] soul
[13:55] the only bible language is that we are
[13:57] sealed in the soul one time unto the day
[14:00] of redemption according to ephesians 4
[14:01] verse 30 grieve not the spirit of god
[14:04] whereby you are sealed unto the day of
[14:06] redemption also ephesians 1 13
[14:09] after that you heard the word of truth
[14:11] you were sealed with that holy spirit of
[14:13] promise
[14:15] second corinthians 1 verse 22 who hath
[14:17] also sealed us
[14:19] and given us the earnest of the spirit
[14:21] in our hearts
[14:22] and again second corinthians 4 verse 16
[14:25] proves the renewing or refilling of the
[14:27] human spirit or mind can potentially
[14:30] take place every day which is only
[14:32] possible through dying to self daily as
[14:34] paul said in first corinthians 15
[14:37] 31 i die daily
[14:40] i want to share two quotes from god's
[14:41] prophet brother branham that teach this
[14:43] truth
[14:44] the first is from the token 1964
[14:47] february 8th brother ram said you can
[14:49] backslide but it does not mean
[14:51] in your soul
[14:52] and he quoted ephesians 4 verse 30. so
[14:55] this means you can only backslide in the
[14:57] mind if your soul is sealed by the holy
[14:59] ghost baptism let's listen to the quote
[15:02] dear friends if you ever healed if you
[15:05] live long enough you'll get sick again
[15:07] if you one time take that token
[15:10] you've had it
[15:12] forever
[15:13] greed not the holy spirit of god whereby
[15:16] you are sealed until the day of your
[15:19] redemption
[15:20] not to the next revival you wasn't
[15:22] sealed you got emotionally worked up
[15:25] but you are dead
[15:27] and your life is hitting god through
[15:29] christ and you're sealed by the holy
[15:31] ghost
[15:32] if you are once baptized into that holy
[15:35] spirit and you can backslide that is
[15:37] true
[15:38] but
[15:43] lastly in the sermon souls that are
[15:45] imprisoned now brother branham said the
[15:47] seal is in the soul
[15:49] and although he didn't say ephesians 4
[15:51] 30 he basically said the same words so
[15:54] we know there's only one ceiling there's
[15:55] only one filling of the soul but the
[15:58] human mind can be filled and refilled
[16:00] every single day
[16:02] let's listen to the quote
[16:04] now the soul of man is not the body of
[16:07] man it's the soul
[16:09] and the soul is something that's uh the
[16:12] nature of the spirit
[16:14] and then when the nature
[16:16] of a man when he said
[16:18] we are dead
[16:19] the scripture plainly tells us that we
[16:22] are dead and our lives are hitting god
[16:23] through christ sealed there by the holy
[16:25] spirit now it wasn't that your body died
[16:29] it wasn't your spirit died
[16:31] it was the nature of your spirit dying
[16:34] see
[16:35] the nature which is the soul the nature
[16:38] of your soul is
[16:40] uh
[16:41] is god
[16:43] if you're born again if it's not it's
[16:45] not the world anything that begin has to
[16:48] end
[16:49] so therefore the only way that you can
[16:51] have eternal life
[16:53] is to have a life that never did begin
[16:57] i'd like to add another quote from 1963
[16:59] what shall i do with this jesus called
[17:01] christ brother branham said the dynamics
[17:03] of the church will be a refilling of the
[17:05] holy spirit
[17:07] so based upon the bible scriptures and
[17:08] other quotes from brother branham this
[17:10] can only mean a refilling in the human
[17:12] spirit or mind because as we've already
[17:15] showed there are no scriptures that
[17:16] support a refilling of the soul or a
[17:19] second baptism of the soul or another
[17:22] sealing of the soul let's listen to the
[17:24] quote
[17:25] the dynamics of this church will be a
[17:28] refilling of the holy spirit
[17:30] that we have worked in a small measure
[17:32] while the headstone is coming down to
[17:34] unite with the body but when that head
[17:36] and body unites together the full power
[17:38] of the holy ghost razor up just exactly
[17:40] like even the dead is dead in christ for
[17:42] hundreds of years ago
[17:47] the dynamics is the holy spirit
[17:51] in closing
[17:53] friends i hope this video has been a
[17:54] blessing you know this question has been
[17:56] on my heart for numerous years
[17:58] especially after i would listen to the
[17:59] third seal and hear brother branham say
[18:01] the bride hasn't had revival yet
[18:04] then of course if you listen to all the
[18:06] sermons from the seven seals you realize
[18:07] he's talking about the revival for the
[18:09] rapture or the latter rain
[18:12] and remember friends there's numerous
[18:13] quotes from brother branham where he
[18:14] says his ministry started a revival
[18:17] that's gone 10 15 or more years and
[18:19] hasn't stopped and would not be
[18:21] denominated
[18:22] so if brother rams ministry started a
[18:24] revival that has to be the holy ghost
[18:25] baptism revival in the soul and if the
[18:28] bride hasn't had a revival yet that
[18:30] could only be the latter rain revival
[18:32] which would be rapturing faith a short
[18:34] time before the literal rapture the body
[18:37] change which is the moment in twinkling
[18:38] of an eye when death is swallowed up in
[18:40] victory and our mortality puts on
[18:42] immortality may i encourage you to get a
[18:45] refilling of the holy ghost in your
