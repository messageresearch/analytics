========================================
[Music] But the main thing is right in the middle of the road with the old spirit in you to keep you warm and moving. Amen. Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; And knowing enough to keep yourself under obedience to the spirit and move just as the spirit moves, not till or not after, just as the spirit moves. &gt;&gt; Greetings, friends, in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of this video is to look at the prophet of God's statement about the main thing being staying in the middle of the road by the grace of God. This is a biblical teaching, a biblical principle by the grace of God. So, we'll look at that and look at some real life examples here by the grace of God. I was recently inspired by this thought by listening to sermons from other brothers in the message, which I greatly appreciate. I don't agree with everything they say, but I like the history of the message that the brothers were bringing out. And I think it's helpful to see where the message has come, where it is now, and where the Holy Ghost wants to take us in the future should the rapture ty the grace of God. So let's begin with a biblical foundation by the grace of God. Brother Brandham uses this verse often. Isaiah 35:8, "And highway shall there be and a way, and it shall be called the way of holiness. The unclean shall not pass over it, but it shall be for those the wayfairing men, though fools shall not heir therein." So, I'll be showing a visual in a moment of a path, a road between two streams, two ditches, we might say. So, that's my symbol of the way of holiness by God's grace. This topic also relates to some videos I made a few years ago called How Far Cans into Sin. So, I'll leave links to those in the description by God's grace. Speaking of the straight and narrow way, Jesus talked about that in Matthew 7:13 and 14. Narrow is the way which leadth unto life, and few there be that find it. So, praise God, we found the narrow road. And it's our desire to stay right in the middle of that road. Proverbs 4:25, 26, and 27 tell us to let our eyes look right on. Ponder the path of thy feet. Turn not to the right hand, nor to the left. Remove thy foot from evil. And there's some very beautiful special verses. 1 Thessalonians 5:21, prove all things, hold fast that which is good. And verse 22, abstain from all appearance of evil. 1 John 4:1, "Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God, because many false prophets are gone out into the world." I love 2 Timothy 2:15, "Study to show thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth." I love what God told Joshua in Joshua 1:7. Only be strong and very courageous. Turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest prosper whethersoever thou goest. Two more beautiful scriptures. I love this one. 2 John 1:9. Whosoever transgressth and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the father and the son. Then Hebrews 2:1, "Therefore, we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, less at any time we should let them slip." So there is a definite Bible foundation of staying in the middle of the road, staying in the truth, not turning to the left or the right. And this is helpful again because of 2 Corinthians 13:5. Examine yourselves whether ye be in the faith. Prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be repribates. So, we're told to examine how we're walking on the straight and narrow way by the grace of God. Now, each time we might sin or teach a false doctrine or make a mistake, it's like a step away from the middle of the road. A good example is Galatians 2:1 and 12 where Peter, a holy ghostfilled man, separates himself from eating with the Gentiles because of fear of the Jews. And we often see that in our lives. Fear will sometimes cause us to leave the truth. But we're thankful that the Holy Ghost sent correction to Peter through Paul. Paul said he was to be blamed to his face. And so there's times God corrects us and gets us back on the straight and narrow. And remember Peter was a bornag again holy ghostfilled believer who got a little off the beaten path. We'd say there's numerous quotes where brother Ram talks about the middle of the road. Here's two that are very special to me and I'm sure to you. The Patos vision 1960. Brother Ram said, "When a good road is built, the highest part is in the center because it lets all the trash wash off to both sides." When a man really comes to Christ, he got his eyes centered on Christ. If he's a little a bit emotional, he'll be a fanatic. If he's a little bit cold, he'll get on the other side and be just a cucumber over on that side. C is intellectual. But the main thing is right in the middle of the road with enough spirit in you, keep you warm and moving. Amen. and knowing enough to keep yourself under obedience to the spirit to move just as the spirit moves. Not till or not after, just as the spirit moves. Let's listen to the quote. &gt;&gt; See, it shall be a highway and a way and it shall be called the way of holiness, not a highway of holiness. See, a roads built a way a good road is built highest parts in the center because it lets all the trash wash off to both sides. &gt;&gt; That's it. When a man really comes to Christ, he's got his eyes centered on Christ. If he's a little bit emotional, he'll be a fanatic. If he's a little bit cold, he'll get on his other side and be just a cucumber over on that side. See, is intellectual. But the main thing is right in the middle of the road with enough spirit in keep you warm and moving. Amen. &gt;&gt; And knowing enough to keep yourself under obedience to the spirit and move just as the spirit moves, not till or not after, just as the spirit moves. Next, God hiding himself in simplicity. March 1763, Brother Ram said, "One side's highly intellectual, cold and indifferent. They deny everything there, and the others got on the other side. The other side's a radical bunch of emotion and denying the word, but the real true church stays right in the middle of the road. It's got the Bible knowledge of what God said, and it's spiritual enough to be warm in its heart." And then he mentions Isaiah 35:8. Let's listen to the quote. There's one side that's highly intellectual, cold and indifferent. They deny everything there. And the others get on the other side on the other side of the radical bunch of emotion and deny the word. &gt;&gt; But the real true church stays right in the middle of the road. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, if you notice, it's it's it's got the Bible knowledge of what God said, and it's it's spiritual enough to be warm in its heart, and it's just a road. Isaiah said it would be that way. He said, "There shall be a highway." &gt;&gt; So, here's a simple visual I made here by God's grace. Here you can see the balance is in the middle of the road. It's the middle mark. And I'm taking that from Paul's words where he said, "Let us press towards the mark of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus, the most obedience we can give to the Holy Ghost." But each one of us are subject to the human spirit that we're given. Some of us will be emotional. So that's on the right side of the road. Maybe we're a little too emotional and we might lack doctrine at times. The other side is we're too intellectual, which might develop some legalism at times. But as we show with Peter, Peter kind of went to the legalism side where he wouldn't eat with the Gentiles, but the Holy Ghost was faithful to bring him back to the balance, back to the middle by the grace of God. I also then would add terms in here, Bible terms to help us understand more about this. I believe the wise virgin will stay on the path. They'll stay as close as they can to the middle of the road. I believe the foolish virgin kind of get off the beaten path out in the weeds, we'd say, out in the grass. as you can see in the picture. But then the makebeliever like the Judas Escaric group, the Balum group, the Esau group, they totally fall off the path into the water. And those are the ones that are lost. So here's a couple quotes I like to share. The first one is from perfect strength and perfect weakness. Brother Ram said, "Paul was concerned lest he'd step off the path somewhere." So now you can see where I'm bringing this visual in. I'm making these lines on both sides of the center line just to show how sometimes we take a step away from the center of the road. We get a false doctrine or we start majoring on a minor, we might say. So Peter clearly took a step away from the middle when he separated himself from the Gentiles. And now I just want to use a quick example of two groups that I see in the United States. The first group I've called the goat group, but as I've listened to more of their sermons, I think a better title might be the open book group. And this was not an observation I made first. It was first from a brother from another country, a European country. He listened to all their recent youth meetings and revival meetings and they kept using the term open book, open book, open book and that's what he shared with me. So I think if they had their own title, they'd call themselves the open book group. And then also here in the USA we have what's called like a seventh seal group. And as I go through this we'll talk about the differences the major differences between these two groups. Okay. So one major differentiation between these groups is the type of music that they play. And I've heard them preach against each other over the years like the last six or seven years. So the open book group allows a lot more music variety which I believe is right. So that's my personal preference. It's okay to have variety as long as you don't insert rock and roll. But the other side, the seventh seal group, they limit the variety of music. And I believe they grieve the Holy Spirit by doing this. So on my visual here is another quote where it says, "Lord, brother was praying,"Lord that I'll not step out of your blessed path from March 22nd 57." So as you can see in the picture, I made a dot step to the left of the path. That would be an intellectual decision where you grieve the Holy Spirit by not having drums perhaps not letting the people dance, shout, scream when we see that in the Bible such as when Israel came out of Egypt on the day of Pentecost. Brother Ram said they were shouting, jumping, leaping, praising God. So that's the first example with music. Second example is regarded to the open book group. They preach basically that it's always God's will to heal. Now, the circle for the emotional group has taken a step to the right. We know it's not God's will to heal always. Perhaps I'll make a video about that in the future. But what I've even witnessed from these preachers is that they claim publicly someone's going to heal. And I've seen two cases where the people have died and then they say, "Well, they still got their healing because they got a theophony body." But that wasn't the healing that everyone was expecting and desiring. So it's a little disingenuous to say that oh God answered our prayer for healing because that's not what people were expecting. People were expecting the people to continue to live. The next topic is about exalting brother Brandham too highly. So, the emotional group or the open book group now takes another step away cuz I just recently heard one of their most popular preachers say that they must believe every word from 47 to 65 just like every word from Genesis to Revelation. So, this is a sin or step away from the truth that's on the same level as the press play and obey false denomination of the current Brandom Tabernacle leadership. So now that's two steps away from the beaten path right down the middle of the road to my humble opinion by the grace of God. So this shows this emotional open book group doesn't have enough teaching to bring the rightly divided truth on these particular topics by God's grace. And the final subject I'll talk about is interracial marriage. I've made numerous videos about that. I talked to some friends last year that went to this seventh seal group even in my own home state here in Ohio and they were already married and it's a black woman and a white man. They were already married. They've been married for over 20 years and they walked into this seventh seal group church and the people didn't know that they were already married. So when they got the couple separated, they tried to convince the black woman to leave the white man because brother Brandon was against interracial marriage and they didn't even know that they were already married. So to me, this is a form of racism. So that's a step away from the solid beaten path of the Bible. There's over six examples of believers intermaring between nations and peoples. And brother Ram called Moses and Zapora God's perfect will and God's choice, as a recent video showed. So, I'll leave a link to that video in the description as well. Also, from watching other videos, too, the emotional group or the open book group, they also reject interracial marriage. So, that's another step away from the beaten path to the right for them. So, the circle moves to the right. So, just to even it out, I'll say one more thing about the seventh seal group. I have videos of some of these preachers saying you can only get saved through a member of the message. And to me, that's a lie. Brother never taught that. So that dot on the intellectual side goes one step further to the left. So now both groups are at least three steps away from down the middle of the road by God's grace. Brother Ram never taught that you can only get saved through a message person. Brother even believed Catholics could be saved as long as they were trusting in the blood of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; I've took this stand that if the Catholic Church, a Catholic, a Roman Catholic or Orthodox or whatever he may be, if he's looking to the Catholic church for salvation, the person's love. If the Baptist is looking to the Baptist church for salvation, love. If the Pentecostal is looking to the Pentecostal church for salvation, he's lost. &gt;&gt; But if the Catholic Pentecostal or Baptist, Presbyterian, or whatever, if he's solemnly trusting in Jesus Christ, he's saved. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because it's by faith are you saved? And that by grace, Catholics can be saved. Baptists can be saved, Pentecostals are saved. because that we all accept what Christ did for us. That's it's our own personal faith in a finished work that Christ did for us. Therefore, I have never draw a denominational boundary or had a barrier. I've tried to reach out, take everyone in my arms and point them to the cross. And that so I believe that a person is saved if he's a Methodist, Baptist, Catholic, or whatever he might be, if he's solemnly trusting Jesus Christ for his grace. But if he's a Catholic and believing the church saves him, then he's lost. If he's a Pentecost and believing the church saves him, he's lost. Amen. &gt;&gt; But no matter what he is, what church he goes to, if he is solemnly depending on the blood and merits of Jesus Christ, he's saved. I don't care what church he's in. For it's by faith are we saved. That by grace. &gt;&gt; In closing, friends, hope this video was a blessing here. By the grace of God, I thought it'd be helpful to give a visual of how groups sometimes get off the beaten path. They take steps away from the truth of God's word. And friends, please know that I put myself on that chart every day. Every time I study, as the Holy Spirit brings it to my remembrance, I try to ask myself, am I in the middle of the road? Is my heart warm for the Lord Jesus Christ? Are my emotions yielded to the Lord Jesus Christ? And also, am I using my knowledge and understanding that God's given me, the wisdom God's given me in order to obey all the word of God? I'm not claiming I'm perfect. I've never claimed that. I've got areas I can grow. And I think if I would judge myself on that road, I probably leaned towards the more intellectual side, but then the other Wednesday, I danced around the church. I didn't plan it as a song leader. I just started singing I could sing of your love forever. And I danced all around the church. It just struck me. That anointing just fell on me. I was shouting, rejoicing, dancing all over the church during the first song of the song service. And when we have guest preachers, I might be the loudest amen corner at our church. I've always loved to make noise, praise the Lord, clap, stomp, dance. So, by God's grace, I just try to do my best to stay in the middle of the road. Of course, there are times I get cold on God. I need to return to my first love. Just like Jesus said in Revelation chapter 2, every person goes through that. There's times, Brother Ram said he needed revival in his life. Then he says we need a daily revival. Brother Ram says, "Every time the Holy Ghost comes back on me, like it came on me when I was born again, I have a boohoo experience." So, I have a quote video about that perhaps. I'll link that up in the video as well. So, again, the main thing is 2 Corinthians 13:5. Examine yourselves whether you be in the faith. Prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves how that Jesus Christ is in you, except you be reprobates. We don't want to be repbates. Repbates are rejected from the faith. They're the ones that fall off into the ditch or into the waters or the streams on on the sides of the highway of holiness. We want to stay on the highway of holiness by the grace of God. And the way to do that is to have Christ in you. That's the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Christ in you, the hope of glory. So friends, if you're not born again, repent, be baptized. That justifies you. Get sanctified. That gives you a new spirit according to Ezekiel 36. New heart is justification. New spirit sanctification gets your habits and daily life cleaned out. And then God will give you his spirit. The baptism of the Holy Ghost is the seal of God unto the day of your redemption. Praise God that Jesus Christ can keep us in the middle of the road. If you have any questions, concerns or testimonies about this video, please contact me. God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart. &gt;&gt; Very happy to be here this afternoon and again in defense of the gospel of Jesus Christ to bring the good tidings, the good news that Jesus raised from the dead, living among man today, his church. The same Jesus that was yesterday will be today and forever. He never failed. [Music]
