[0:10] God bless you and welcome to the
[0:12] defending the message podcast I'm your
[0:14] co-host Pastor Jesse Smith today in
[0:17] episode 27 I'll be again recording solo
[0:20] as brother amen was unavailable for this
[0:23] recording he and I hope to record
[0:24] Another podcast together in a few weeks
[0:27] by the grace of God
[0:28] in today's podcast we're going to
[0:30] complete part two on the topic of are
[0:33] you the message yesterday on March 28th
[0:36] I put out part one and so today I'll
[0:39] finish this subject with a part two in
[0:41] part one we covered a message definition
[0:43] is essential
[0:45] then we covered defining the message and
[0:49] ended with Bible uses of the word
[0:51] message here in part two we'll cover six
[0:54] foundational quotes from Brother Branham
[0:56] that help us Define the message and
[0:58] lastly we'll look at the written
[1:00] Epistles question
[1:07] so let's begin with six foundational
[1:09] quotes that help Define the message the
[1:11] first foundational quote is what I call
[1:13] the think it through quote from Brother
[1:15] Branham
[1:16] this quote comes from questions and
[1:18] answers part 3 1964.
[1:21] brother Branham is asked if he is more
[1:23] than a man since he can create and Jesus
[1:26] can look just like brother Branham
[1:28] I love brother Brandon's answer he says
[1:30] you're so close to being the truth yet
[1:32] you're so far from the truth
[1:34] and he tells the people they're close to
[1:36] making an antichrist statement but
[1:39] brother random explains he's just
[1:41] Anointed with his spirit and doesn't
[1:43] have the fullness of the anointing like
[1:45] Jesus had because the Bible said in
[1:47] Colossians chapter 1 and Colossians
[1:49] chapter 2 that the fullness of the
[1:51] godhead dwelt in Christ bodily
[1:54] so Jesus had the fullness of the Holy
[1:56] Ghost anointing but we have the Holy
[1:57] Ghost anointing in a small measure and I
[2:00] only play a portion of this quote
[2:02] because this is a long quote and I'll
[2:04] play the parts that help us understand
[2:05] this topic by God's grace
[2:08] let's listen to the quote
[2:21] just like brother bran
[2:24] now
[2:26] let me the person said this whoever it
[2:29] might be I don't know
[2:32] and I am your brother
[2:35] see Jesus is your savior I cannot be
[2:39] your savior for he has already saved you
[2:42] now you're so close to being the truth
[2:45] there and yet so far from the truth the
[2:48] person that told this person this not
[2:50] sister now brother Brandon uh could
[2:53] Jesus look like you or you be Jesus or
[2:56] something like that
[2:57] one says the word that's exactly the
[3:00] truth another sense the word is an
[3:02] antichrist
[3:03] that's the difference between right and
[3:05] wrong
[3:06] to make me the person of the Lord Jesus
[3:09] Christ would be an antichrist amen
[3:11] amen for that person of the Lord Jesus
[3:13] is sitting at the right hand of the
[3:15] Majesty owner and will come again in
[3:18] great power and Glory but for his life
[3:21] that was in him being upon me and upon
[3:24] you who have him
[3:26] exactly the truth and you become Christ
[3:31] remember my message on Messiahs
[3:34] see you are the word Messiah means on
[3:39] the anointed one
[3:41] now you are if you have the Holy Spirit
[3:44] you become the anointed one
[3:47] see then there's all kinds of anointed
[3:50] ones now watch if it's a Bible anointed
[3:54] one I remember we are not the word but
[3:57] we are the word
[4:02] now you got it
[4:04] Jesus was not God but he was God
[4:08] he was a man yet he was God now you
[4:10] understand we are not we are Messiahs
[4:13] but not that
[4:15] Jesus
[4:16] he is our father we're just Anointed
[4:19] with his spirit and that's reason his
[4:20] life and that because people see if you
[4:22] don't sit and thinking through it gives
[4:24] people to believe well this guy would be
[4:25] the Messiah
[4:26] sure he is
[4:28] this one over here it could be they both
[4:30] are
[4:31] how can it be two of them there's
[4:33] thousands of them see so now that we've
[4:36] heard that quote remember friends we
[4:37] have to think it through when we're
[4:39] making a declaration perhaps it would be
[4:41] a new declaration in this case we must
[4:44] think it through and people say you are
[4:47] the message that's so close to the truth
[4:49] but yet it's so far from the truth
[4:51] for example what if somebody told you
[4:53] you know brother or you know Sister you
[4:55] really need to go study the message more
[4:57] what does that mean does that mean you
[4:59] need to study my life more because I am
[5:01] the message of course not what we mean
[5:03] is listen to brother Ram's tapes read
[5:05] your Bible because the message is the
[5:07] scriptures the Holy Ghost is fulfilling
[5:09] right now I remember friends brother
[5:11] random said one sense of a word can be
[5:13] truth but then another sense of the same
[5:15] word could be an antichrist so that's
[5:17] what Satan's trying to do Satan's trying
[5:19] to make message people exalt themselves
[5:22] so they get Glory but the Bible said God
[5:24] will not share his glory with anyone
[5:26] else
[5:27] so friends when we hear preachers preach
[5:29] if we're hearing something new we got to
[5:31] make sure we set and think it through
[5:33] like brother random says so we don't go
[5:35] overboard on a thought and start
[5:38] believing in Antichrist thought now
[5:40] closely related to this first
[5:42] foundational quote is this statement by
[5:44] Brother Branham when he says prophets
[5:46] are the word of God so I'm going to play
[5:49] a quote from the way of a true Prophet
[5:51] from May 13 1962 brother Branham says
[5:54] the prophet is the word of God because
[5:56] he's carrying the word of God
[5:57] but then the month before brother
[6:00] Branham said prophets wasn't the word
[6:02] but the word came to them now this is
[6:05] such an important topic because
[6:06] Jeffersonville and the voice of God
[6:09] company say brother Branham is the word
[6:12] of God because he's a prophet and then
[6:14] they make every word of brother Branham
[6:16] thus saith the Lord because brother
[6:17] random said a prophet is the word of God
[6:20] so this is the quote voice of God in
[6:22] Jeffersonville has not sat and thought
[6:25] through as brother Ram told them
[6:27] Jeffersonville has taken an antichrist
[6:29] Spirit by calling every word brother
[6:31] Branham said thus saith the Lord they've
[6:33] made brother Branham infallible by
[6:35] saying every word he said was thus saith
[6:37] the Lord so let's begin by listening to
[6:39] the first quote from the way of a true
[6:41] prophet of God
[6:42] he only goes in the name of the Lord
[6:48] for one thing
[6:51] he's got him a mission
[6:54] and he said of the Lord and He is the
[6:58] word of God
[6:59] because he's carrying the word of the
[7:01] Lord
[7:07] that is a true prophet of the Lord
[7:10] my text is the way of a true prophet of
[7:14] God
[7:17] so in one sense of the word yes the
[7:19] prophet is carrying the word of God but
[7:21] he is not fully the word of God a human
[7:24] Prophet is not a hundred percent God
[7:26] again if he's born again in the soul
[7:30] he has a measure of God's spirit as the
[7:32] Bible says but he is not 100 percent
[7:35] divine nature
[7:36] now let's listen to the quote from the
[7:38] restoration the bride tree one month
[7:40] previous when brother Branham said
[7:41] prophets wasn't the word but the word
[7:44] came to them and then he says Jesus was
[7:46] the word because Jesus was the fullness
[7:48] of the godhead bodily let's listen to
[7:51] the quote
[7:57] Jesus wouldn't have had to do that for
[8:00] he was the word and we are not the word
[8:03] the word of the Lord came to the
[8:06] prophets they wasn't the word but the
[8:08] word come to them
[8:10] and Jesus wiser
[8:12] he didn't have to pray he was God
[8:15] himself
[8:19] so I like this quote from restoration
[8:21] the bride tree where brother Brown says
[8:23] the prophet is not the word but the word
[8:25] comes to him this is the best way to say
[8:27] it regarding brother Branham or Saint
[8:29] Paul or any other Prophet or else you
[8:32] get unbalanced like voice of God
[8:33] Recordings and the Branham Tabernacle
[8:36] today and then you make every word of
[8:38] brother Branham thus saith the Lord but
[8:39] that's Antichrist there's numerous times
[8:41] brother Branham said this is not the
[8:43] Lord this is just me brother Ram said
[8:45] there's Mix-Ups on the tapes so I hope
[8:47] these examples with this first
[8:49] foundational quote and these quotes
[8:50] about prophets being the word have
[8:53] helped clarify more on this subject for
[8:56] you now we see the importance and
[8:58] necessity of understanding quotes
[9:00] friends most people in the message don't
[9:02] seek understanding they don't study
[9:04] enough nor do they pray for Revelation
[9:07] they just want an easy believism they
[9:10] don't want to understand because it
[9:11] takes too much time and friends I think
[9:14] many people are just consumed with the
[9:15] cares of this world and they only spend
[9:17] time with God at church and that's
[9:19] really sad
[9:20] but God commands us to grow in wisdom
[9:23] judgment and understanding as we showed
[9:25] in part one and that's what will
[9:27] separate the wise virgin from the
[9:28] foolish virgin
[9:30] wise versions understand the will of God
[9:32] and do not exalt themselves in Pride
[9:36] that's according to Ephesians 1 7 and 8
[9:39] where the Bible said God has abounded
[9:40] toward us in all wisdom
[9:43] Colossians 1 verses 9 10 and 11 where
[9:46] Paul prays that we might be filled with
[9:48] the knowledge of his will in all wisdom
[9:50] and spiritual understanding and we would
[9:52] be increasing in the knowledge of God we
[9:55] see the same thought in Philippians 1
[9:57] verses 9 and 10 Paul prayed our love
[9:59] would abound and we'd have more
[10:01] knowledge and all judgment so we could
[10:04] approve things that are excellent so
[10:06] this is why we approve of truth that has
[10:08] been rightly divided but we disapprove
[10:10] of Lies coming out of Jeffersonville and
[10:13] other churches that call themselves The
[10:15] Greatest Christians of all time and so
[10:16] forth second Peter 3 Verse 18 says we're
[10:19] to grow in Grace and in the knowledge of
[10:21] our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[10:24] we can't get stagnant as message
[10:25] Believers we've got to rightly divide
[10:27] the word of Truth we've got to prove all
[10:29] things study ourselves approved unto God
[10:32] the second foundational quote is that
[10:34] brother Branham said the message was not
[10:37] his message so if every word is thus say
[10:39] the Lord friends then brother Ram's
[10:41] message was not his own if the message
[10:43] was not his own how could he be one with
[10:45] the message so you can see again that
[10:47] thinking falls apart brother Ram could
[10:50] not be the message and then not have the
[10:52] message and we'll also look at another
[10:54] quote where brother Brown says the
[10:55] message was his message so we learned
[10:58] from this that in one sense the word or
[11:00] message that brother random preached
[11:02] wasn't his message because it did not
[11:04] originate from his own mind the message
[11:06] originated from the mind of God
[11:09] but then in another sense it was his
[11:11] message to preach as the seventh Church
[11:13] age Messenger as the fourth Elijah
[11:15] anointed Prophet to the Gentiles so
[11:18] let's listen to the quotes
[11:30] to be the truth
[11:32] that was from birth pains
[11:35] 1965. now the next quote is from a shame
[11:37] 1965. brother random says he's like
[11:40] Ellie easer Abraham's faithful servant
[11:43] and he says that's right with his
[11:45] message pulling out the bride
[11:51] 24 7.
[11:54] and my ease are
[11:55] Abraham's faithful servant the model
[11:58] server of the Bible
[11:59] being sent to help the bride
[12:03] for Isaac kills run over me
[12:07] cheers
[12:15] so let's do his brother Brandon said
[12:16] let's think it through brother random
[12:18] said the message wasn't his will that
[12:20] make sense in one sense because it did
[12:22] not originate from Brother Branham it
[12:24] came from God
[12:25] but in other sense it was his message to
[12:28] preach that was his calling from God it
[12:31] was his duty from God to preach the
[12:33] bible promises for his day now the third
[12:36] foundational quote is brother random
[12:38] separated himself from being the message
[12:40] this quote is from Look Away to Jesus
[12:42] 1963 brother random said I may not do it
[12:45] but this message will introduce Jesus
[12:47] Christ to the world he said the message
[12:50] will go on let's listen to the quote I
[12:53] may not do it but this message will
[12:55] introduce Jesus Christ to the world all
[12:58] right John the Baptist was sent the
[13:00] forerun the first coming
[13:01] so is the message before on the second
[13:04] coming and John said Behold the Lamb of
[13:07] God that takes away the sin of the world
[13:09] so it's parallel it in every way and I
[13:13] know it will a message Will Go On
[13:17] friends now let's think this quote
[13:18] through like brother random said this
[13:20] quote shows brother random was not the
[13:22] message because he said I may not do it
[13:24] and I remember in the previous quote
[13:26] brother random said it was not his
[13:28] message so we got to balance all these
[13:30] quotes and rightly divide the word of
[13:32] Truth so this quote again proves brother
[13:35] Branham was not the message he was a
[13:37] carrier of the message but he was not
[13:38] the message
[13:40] brother and makes it clear the message
[13:42] would go on but he would not go on in
[13:44] other words he would die and friends
[13:46] that's exactly what happened
[13:48] brother Brandon passed away in 1965 but
[13:50] the message has gone on and you and I
[13:52] have received it by the grace of God
[13:55] here's the fourth foundational quote but
[13:56] the branch says take the message into
[13:58] your heart
[14:00] this is from the token sermon September
[14:02] 1st 1963. let's listen to the quote
[14:14] [Applause]
[14:15] that's good but that's just that's just
[14:18] being able to read
[14:21] take the message take
[14:23] your heart
[14:25] must have the token the very light that
[14:29] was in Christ being you
[14:33] asked for you
[14:35] now friends think this quote through
[14:37] brother Brown said take the message take
[14:38] it into your heart how can I take myself
[14:41] into my own heart
[14:43] I can't because I'm not the message I'm
[14:46] a carrier of the message so based upon
[14:48] this quote here's four things we have to
[14:49] gain from the quote the message is
[14:52] Christ or the Holy Spirit since the
[14:54] Corporal body of Jesus is in heaven but
[14:57] the Rams had come into Christ we can't
[14:59] come into Jesus's Corporal body up in
[15:01] heaven but we can come into the body of
[15:03] Christ by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[15:06] second Christ's message can be on paper
[15:09] or the word of God in written form
[15:11] remember brother Branham said that's
[15:13] just being able to read
[15:15] this shows the absolute can be in two
[15:17] forms spirit and letter
[15:20] the Holy Ghost is the absolute in spirit
[15:22] form but the Bible the word of God is
[15:25] the absolute in letter form so that's
[15:28] where some people stumble today they
[15:29] don't realize the absolute has another
[15:31] form it has the Holy Spirit form and
[15:34] also has the written form
[15:37] as brother Ram said the word of God was
[15:39] his absolute brother Bram never said my
[15:41] tapes are the absolute third you have to
[15:44] obey the messenger who's who is pointing
[15:47] you to receive Christ if I am the
[15:49] message why do I need to obey anything I
[15:51] already am the message so that makes no
[15:53] sense friends we got to sit down and
[15:55] think it through
[15:56] and fourth and finally the message is on
[15:58] paper and is Spirit we take the spirit
[16:02] into our heart or Soul not the paper
[16:04] form of the message so based upon this
[16:06] quote you cannot be the message because
[16:08] you are not the token which is the
[16:10] message and you cannot receive yourself
[16:13] and you are not Christ Christ is the
[16:16] sender of the message
[16:18] the fifth foundational quote is where
[16:20] brother Brown says the message will be
[16:21] right with us this quote's from
[16:23] questions and answers part 2 1964.
[16:26] brother Ram's talking about the future
[16:27] home and he says you won't have to drive
[16:29] over from Birmingham to hear the message
[16:32] the message will be right with us then
[16:34] won't it so friends think it through how
[16:36] can the message be right with us if we
[16:38] are the message that doesn't make sense
[16:41] but first let's listen to the quote
[16:53] it'll be a wonderful wonderful time
[16:56] we're looking for that day God hasten it
[16:59] to come that great City sitting there I
[17:02] think it will not you think 1500 miles
[17:05] high that's what the Bible said
[17:08] now based upon this quote friends you
[17:10] cannot be the message because first you
[17:12] are not the message in the future home
[17:15] second the message will be heard from
[17:17] the lips of Jesus Christ in the future
[17:18] home making Jesus the sender of the
[17:22] message and his word the message
[17:25] and third the message was being preached
[17:27] by Brother Branham in different cities
[17:28] around the U.S so the message was the
[17:31] word of God shared from God
[17:33] through brother Branham to us and if the
[17:36] people were the message why were they
[17:37] driving from City to city or state to
[17:40] state to hear themselves that makes no
[17:42] sense the people who are driving from
[17:44] City to City because they wanted to hear
[17:46] the message more Revelation from the
[17:48] Holy Ghost about the scriptures God was
[17:50] fulfilling in their day
[17:51] the sixth and final foundational quote
[17:54] is from the Rapture sermon 1965 where in
[17:57] brotherbraham defined the message I love
[18:00] this quote brother Branham says the
[18:01] message is God's promise of the hour
[18:03] it's the bible promises God was
[18:05] scripturally vindicating in brother
[18:07] Ram's life let's listen to the quote
[18:10] many of you strangers perhaps hear these
[18:12] men get up and they make these remarks
[18:14] about a message at this hour and so
[18:16] forth what they are getting at is God's
[18:19] promise of this hour that he promised
[18:22] what he would do and we seem
[18:23] scripturally vindicating just exactly
[18:26] what he said he would do in the same
[18:28] manner we're told it's just
[18:30] exactly perfectly each time because it's
[18:33] God saying it
[18:34] now based upon this quote you cannot be
[18:36] the message because first the message is
[18:39] the Bible verses God was vindicating in
[18:41] brother Ram's time just like the verses
[18:43] God was vindicating in the prophet
[18:45] Paul's Ministry in Acts 17 verse 11. the
[18:48] hearers of the message in Paul's day
[18:50] were the bereans and they could search
[18:51] the Scriptures Daily to make sure Paul's
[18:54] message lined up with the Old Testament
[18:56] message and it did
[18:58] because it was the Fulfillment of Old
[19:01] Testament prophecy the same is true
[19:03] today we heard brother random's message
[19:05] then we searched the Scriptures Daily to
[19:07] confirm brother random's message was the
[19:08] right message second the Bible verses of
[19:11] brother Ram's message were foretold up
[19:13] to two thousand years ago well before
[19:15] any of us were born
[19:17] so we cannot be the message because we
[19:19] weren't even here 2000 years ago and
[19:21] third the message is what God Said which
[19:24] all of God's word has to be thus saith
[19:26] the Lord but very little of what we say
[19:29] is thus saith the Lord so we cannot be
[19:31] the message
[19:32] foreign
[19:38] ly let's look at the written Epistles
[19:40] question friends after I wrote a podcast
[19:42] about
[19:43] these statements where preachers were
[19:45] calling themselves the message a dear
[19:48] brother a precious Pastor asked me a
[19:50] question about second Corinthians 3 1-3
[19:53] it was a great question he said do these
[19:55] verses prove we are the message so let
[19:57] me read them first second Corinthians 3
[20:00] 1-3 Do We Begin Again to commend
[20:02] ourselves or need we as some others
[20:05] Epistles of commendation to you or
[20:08] letters of commendation from you ye are
[20:11] our epistle written in our hearts known
[20:12] in red of all men for as much as ye are
[20:15] manifestly declared to be the Epistle of
[20:17] Christ ministered by US Written not with
[20:19] ink but with the spirit of the Living
[20:21] God not in tables of stone but in
[20:24] fleshly tables of the heart
[20:26] so this is a great scripture and a great
[20:28] question I highly respected this
[20:30] question because the Bible says we are
[20:32] declared to be the Epistle of Christ the
[20:34] letter of Christ now my reply was no
[20:37] these verses do not prove we are the
[20:39] message
[20:40] first if we are the message then we
[20:42] would have to deny the previous six
[20:44] quotes on this podcast for example the
[20:48] sixth quote from the Rapture 1965 said
[20:50] the message was God's thus saith the
[20:52] Lord foretold promises if we think it
[20:55] through friends we are not Gods thus
[20:57] saith the Lord foretold promises and if
[20:59] we were then we would have to believe
[21:01] everything every one of us said who
[21:03] believe this message and say everything
[21:05] we said was thus saith the Lord but we
[21:07] all know we're fallible creatures I am
[21:10] not infallible no one is infallible
[21:12] outside of Jesus Christ and like the
[21:14] previous quote brother Branham said
[21:15] where they had to drive from Birmingham
[21:17] to other cities to hear the message they
[21:19] weren't driving to see themselves they
[21:22] weren't driving to hear themselves they
[21:24] were driving to hear more of the message
[21:25] more of God's promised truce for their
[21:27] day so getting back to Second
[21:29] Corinthians 3 1-3 in the context this
[21:33] means Paul was saying preachers carried
[21:36] letters of recommendation with them when
[21:38] they were traveling and meeting new
[21:40] believers in different home churches or
[21:42] gatherings and Paul said the lives of
[21:45] the believing Corinthians were his
[21:47] letters of recommendation so Paul didn't
[21:49] need to carry letters of recommendation
[21:51] because the Believers he preached to
[21:53] were his living written Epistles
[21:55] now friends this scripture does prove
[21:57] our lives are like letters of
[21:59] recommendation for those that preach to
[22:01] us the word of life or the message of
[22:03] the hour
[22:04] so again this scripture shows we are
[22:06] carriers of the message but we cannot be
[22:08] the message because we are fallible
[22:10] we do not always represent Christ and
[22:13] Obey him plus we have six other quotes
[22:15] we read earlier that prove we are not
[22:17] the message so friends C sometimes
[22:19] scriptures are so close but yet so far
[22:21] away as brother Branham said let me go
[22:24] back to this previous example I'll close
[22:25] with this if I say I am the message and
[22:28] then I say yet you need to go study the
[22:30] message this is a deceptive comment
[22:32] because it doesn't make sense if I say
[22:34] I'm the message and you need to study
[22:36] the message then essentially you're
[22:37] saying you need to study my life you
[22:39] need to hang around me and study me so
[22:42] in that sentence I am the message yet
[22:43] you need to study the message the word
[22:45] message has lost its definition and
[22:48] that's the same deception as someone
[22:49] saying God is three persons yet one God
[22:52] the word person has lost its meaning so
[22:55] friends we cannot say we are the message
[22:57] we need to tell people you need to
[22:59] receive the message the message is Jesus
[23:01] Christ the same yesterday today and
[23:02] forever and all the other scriptures God
[23:04] is fulfilling in this day so I want to
[23:07] thank God for his strength to rightly
[23:09] divide the word of truth I want to thank
[23:11] God for his Simplicity and ask God to
[23:13] help us continually show humility
[23:17] foreign
[23:22] friends now these two latest podcasts
[23:25] have paved the way for the next topic
[23:27] which is 26 Bible verses brother random
[23:30] used to define the message by God's
[23:33] grace I've been teaching our children in
[23:35] our church these truths in our Sunday
[23:36] School classes which are basically our 3
[23:39] P.M Sunday Services because we don't
[23:41] have any Sunday school teachers other
[23:43] than myself
[23:44] friends there could be more than 26
[23:46] Bible verses I'm sure there's more than
[23:48] 26 but as of right now that's how many
[23:50] I've found and brother random uses all
[23:52] these verses to Define what the message
[23:54] is so Lord willing maybe next week or in
[23:57] a little while I'll be able to make the
[23:58] podcast or videos on this topic
[24:01] God bless you friends as the Holy Ghost
[24:03] anoints you to defend the Gospel of
[24:05] Jesus Christ as Paul also said in
[24:07] Philippians 1 verse 17 he said knowing
[24:10] that I am set for the defense of the
[24:12] Gospel
[24:12] [Music]
[24:22] news that Jesus
[24:24] [Music]
[24:27] rethane Jesus
[24:31] forever
[24:33] Hammer never fail
