[0:03] you want to make the Rapture amen how
[0:06] many's interested in making the Rapture
[0:07] say God I want to make it with all my
[0:12] heart greetings friends in the matchless
[0:15] name of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[0:17] purpose of this video is to answer a
[0:20] viewer's question he ask can people
[0:22] outside the message of the hour make the
[0:25] Rapture my brief summary of my answer by
[0:28] God's grace is that I think no people
[0:32] outside the message of the hour cannot
[0:34] make the Rapture that's based upon the
[0:36] holy scriptures the King James Bible but
[0:39] I also want to say it's possible God
[0:42] could Rapture people outside the message
[0:44] if they were born again since God can do
[0:47] anything hi friends my name is Jesse
[0:49] Smith I'm Pastor bride of Christ
[0:51] Fellowship here in akan Ohio been
[0:54] pastoring here for 17 years and by God's
[0:56] grace I defend the Bible revelations
[0:58] that Jesus Christ revealed to to his
[1:00] true Prophet The Late William brandham
[1:02] 1909 to 1965 and I also defend brother
[1:06] branham's Godly Christian character so
[1:08] let's begin with the Bible proof that I
[1:11] believe scripture teaches only Believers
[1:14] inside the message of the hour can go in
[1:16] the Rapture now it's clear according to
[1:19] two Parables a person must be born again
[1:22] which means their soul is filled with
[1:23] the Holy Ghost in order to go in the
[1:26] Rapture of course there could be more
[1:28] scriptures but we find these two
[1:30] examples in Jesus's two Parables the
[1:33] first is the wise and foolish virgins
[1:35] from Matthew 25
[1:37] 1-13 and the second is the parable of
[1:40] the King's son in Matthew 22
[1:43] 1-14 in the wise and foolish virgin
[1:46] Parable the wise virgin was the only one
[1:48] to go out and meet the bridegroom so we
[1:51] believe that's a type of getting caught
[1:53] up to meet the Lord in the air according
[1:55] to 1
[1:56] Thessalonians 4: 16 and 17 for the Lord
[2:01] himself shall descend from heaven with a
[2:03] shout with the voice of the Archangel
[2:05] and with a trump of God and the dead in
[2:06] Christ shall rise first then we which
[2:09] are alive and remain should be caught up
[2:10] together with them in the clouds to meet
[2:12] the Lord in the air and so shall we ever
[2:15] be with the Lord so that scripture about
[2:18] getting caught up to meet the Lord in
[2:20] the air we see the parallel of that in
[2:23] the parable of the wise and foolish
[2:25] virgins only the wise go out to meet the
[2:27] bridegroom and of course the only
[2:28] difference between the wise and foolish
[2:30] was the oil so oil types the Holy Ghost
[2:33] according to Zechariah 4 the Bible says
[2:36] not by might not by power but by my
[2:38] spirit sayith the Lord that's Zechariah
[2:40] 4:6 then of course there's two anointed
[2:43] ones and they're likened into two trees
[2:45] two olive trees so of course olive trees
[2:48] produce olives and olives give us olive
[2:51] oil and it was the oil from the olives
[2:54] that was giving light to the seven lamps
[2:56] on the Candlestick in Zechariah 4:2 now
[2:59] let's go a little further here by God's
[3:01] grace looking at more Bible proof so I
[3:04] ask myself this question can people
[3:05] receive the Holy Ghost outside the
[3:08] message so see you have to have the Holy
[3:10] Ghost to go in the Rapture but can you
[3:12] get the Holy Ghost outside the message
[3:15] now my Bible answer is no and that's
[3:18] according to Acts chapter 2 where the
[3:20] Holy Ghost fell on the people inside the
[3:23] message of the hour we'd say and then
[3:25] Acts chapter 8 the Samaritans who
[3:27] receive the Holy Ghost after Peter and
[3:29] John prayed for them these Samaritans
[3:32] had to have contact with the preachers
[3:34] from the message of the hour we see the
[3:36] same thing in Acts chap 10 with
[3:37] Cornelius and his house they had to
[3:39] receive the preachers preaching the
[3:41] message of the hour which was Peter and
[3:43] then they received the Holy Ghost and
[3:45] then Acts chapter 19 the Ephesians they
[3:48] were Justified and Sanctified following
[3:50] Apollos but they needed to hear Paul a
[3:53] preacher of the message of the hour in
[3:55] order to be born again so it seems from
[3:57] the scripture that only people inside
[4:00] the message of the hour or in contact
[4:02] with preachers of the message of the
[4:03] hour can be born again but I also want
[4:07] to say God could fill people with the
[4:09] Holy Ghost outside the message so for
[4:11] example I've met a Muslim a former
[4:14] Muslim who said Jesus appeared to him in
[4:17] a dream and vision he got converted and
[4:19] then he found a message church and
[4:21] received the Holy Ghost in the message
[4:23] church since preachers often can't get
[4:25] into Muslim nations it seems like Jesus
[4:27] is appearing to some of them through
[4:29] dreams and Visions which is an awesome
[4:32] thing that God is doing God is so
[4:34] gracious and merciful so it seems God
[4:36] could reveal himself to people outside
[4:38] the message but then the Bible says that
[4:40] we're to come out of her my people so
[4:42] every True Believer would want to come
[4:44] out of any false religion the mother
[4:46] Harlot religion or any of her daughters
[4:48] it's according to Revelation
[4:50] 18:4 then Hebrews 10 says we should
[4:52] gather more as we see that day
[4:53] approaching that's Hebrews 10:24 and 25
[4:57] so it seems any person filled with the
[4:58] Holy Ghost with then want to gather with
[5:00] Holy Ghost filled Christians and leave
[5:02] false churches and to go along with that
[5:05] it seems the Bible is teaching Holy
[5:08] Ghost filled Saints are gathering
[5:10] together with other Holy Ghost filled
[5:12] Saints and they're Gathering unto Christ
[5:15] unto the Rapture like 2 Thessalonians
[5:17] 2:1 says our gathering together unto him
[5:22] and then Ephesians 4 8-6 says the five
[5:25] full ministry will bring us all to the
[5:27] unity of the faith so again Holy Ghost
[5:30] filled Believers being
[5:31] unified and then 1 John 2:19 says they
[5:34] went out from us because they were not
[5:36] of us so anyone who's not elect will
[5:39] leave the elect and of course we see
[5:41] this in the parable the King's son as
[5:42] well which we'll get to in a moment the
[5:44] Rapture o is with an elect group a
[5:47] chosen group just like in Matthew 27:52
[5:51] the Bible said many bodies of the Saints
[5:53] which slept arose and were seen of many
[5:56] and brother Brandon pointed this out in
[5:58] the Seven Seals series
[6:00] the Bible said many Old Testament Saints
[6:02] not all the Old Testament Saints it was
[6:05] an elect group the group that was living
[6:07] near Jerusalem that's why Joseph said he
[6:10] wanted his bones buried in the promised
[6:12] land so he could be a part of the
[6:13] Rapture the resurrection of his day and
[6:16] of course that was the fourth Rapture
[6:18] we're taught there's six raptures in the
[6:20] scripture so even for the fourth Rapture
[6:23] the Believers had to be in an elect
[6:25] group in order to be in the Rapture they
[6:28] had to be planted in the promised land
[6:30] they' to be buried in the promised land
[6:33] and we believe that's a type of being
[6:35] buried with Christ by baptism in the
[6:37] name of the Lord Jesus Christ and then
[6:39] being filled with the Holy Ghost here in
[6:40] the New Testament and now looking at
[6:43] these two Parables you know the wise and
[6:44] foolish virgin Parable the wise virgins
[6:48] had to have prepared oil to go to meet
[6:50] the bridegroom the Bible said they took
[6:52] oil as they went forth to meet the
[6:54] bridegroom both the wise and foolish
[6:57] heard the Midnight Cry and Jesus end
[7:00] that Parable by saying watch therefore
[7:03] so the foolish virgin were not watching
[7:05] like the wise so it appears again only
[7:09] people inside the message with the
[7:11] baptism of the Holy Ghost will be
[7:12] watching for the Rapture and then
[7:15] secondly the king's son's Parable I love
[7:18] this Parable Matthew 22
[7:20] 1-14 in verses 1-8 it shows how Israel
[7:23] rejected Christ and then the Gentiles
[7:26] are spoken of in verses
[7:28] 9-14 I like the scripture the king
[7:30] visits the Gathering for the final
[7:32] separation of the guests the guests who
[7:35] have the wedding garment and the guests
[7:37] who don't have the wedding garment and
[7:39] one man is found without a wedding
[7:40] garment I believe this wedding garment
[7:43] types the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[7:45] which is also the oil from the wise and
[7:47] foolish virgin Parable because both
[7:50] Parables teach there's one thing the
[7:52] believer needs in order to make this
[7:53] marriage supper of the Lamb we'd say in
[7:56] the Virgin Parable it was oil in this
[7:58] Parable it's the wedding garment so
[8:00] these two symbols must be the same thing
[8:03] the baptism of the Holy Ghost just as
[8:05] Ephesians 4:30 says we're sealed by the
[8:07] Holy Ghost unto the day of our
[8:09] Redemption Romans 8 says the Holy Ghost
[8:11] is the first fruit of the resurrection
[8:15] and so this man without the wedding
[8:16] garment is speechless he has no
[8:18] testimony of the baptism of the Holy
[8:19] Ghost and he's taken away and again
[8:22] Jesus says watch therefore and I believe
[8:25] this Parable teaches that the Holy Ghost
[8:26] will come down through the church I
[8:28] believe in the rain which is rapturing
[8:31] Faith the time of the squeeze and the
[8:33] Holy Ghost will separate the foolish
[8:36] virgin from the wise virgin and I
[8:38] believe this is more proof that people
[8:41] that are born again inside the message
[8:43] of the hour only those people who are
[8:44] born again will make the Rapture so I
[8:47] hope this answer is sufficient by God's
[8:48] grace it's the best to my understanding
[8:50] right now and of course I'm always open
[8:52] to correction I think I'll close this
[8:54] video by just showing the six reasons
[8:56] the Rapture is pre-tribulation I've a
[8:59] video about this so I'll leave a link in
[9:01] the description also wrote about it in
[9:03] my 2021 book beginning on page 709 and
[9:07] going to page 718 reason number one the
[9:10] Great Tribulation is described as
[9:11] trouble for Israel trouble for the
[9:14] foolish virgins trouble for the Sinners
[9:16] but not for the Holy Ghost filled bride
[9:19] second reason is there's no mention of
[9:21] Christ's bride or church in the
[9:23] tribulation text in the Book of
[9:26] Revelation the third reason is the bride
[9:28] or the true church is specifically
[9:30] promised a pardon from God's Divine
[9:33] wrath the fourth reason is the bride or
[9:36] true church is foreshadowed to receive a
[9:38] pardon from God's Divine wrath the fifth
[9:41] reason is Jesus and Paul taught the
[9:43] Rapture was imminent at an unknown day
[9:46] and hour as an approaching Thief while
[9:49] other views can number or count to the
[9:52] day of Jesus's return and the last
[9:55] reason number six the Rapture is the
[9:57] removal of the grace of God for Gentiles
[9:59] in preparation for the antichrist's
[10:02] public Revelation and God's return to
[10:04] the Jewish
[10:07] people you want to make the Rapture am
[10:10] how many's interested in making the
[10:12] Rapture say God I want to make it with
[10:14] all my heart hold to God's unchanging
[10:17] hand are your heads bowed in this in
[10:20] mine knowing that we are bowing our
[10:23] heads to the dust from which we were
[10:25] brought someday will return knowing that
[10:29] you got a soul in there that has to
[10:32] answer to God and if you feel that
[10:35] you're not just ready for that Rapture
