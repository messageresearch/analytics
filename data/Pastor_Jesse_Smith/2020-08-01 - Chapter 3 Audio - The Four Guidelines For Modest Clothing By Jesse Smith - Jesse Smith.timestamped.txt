[0:00] chapter three four guidelines for modest
[0:03] clothing
[0:05] includes footnotes 178
[0:08] to 226.
[0:13] in like manner also that women adorn
[0:15] themselves in modest apparel
[0:17] with shame-facedness and sobriety not
[0:20] with broided hair
[0:21] or gold or pearls or costly array
[0:25] first timothy 2 verse 9
[0:28] how should a christian dress in modest
[0:30] apparel you may have wondered
[0:33] how do i know i have enough clothes on
[0:35] no doubt some christians have struggled
[0:37] with the balance of wanting to look
[0:39] fashionable
[0:40] and modern but not become seductive
[0:43] scriptures will give you confidence to
[0:44] know you are dressing in a way that
[0:46] honors god
[0:47] people around you will know that you
[0:49] love the lord jesus christ
[0:50] when you present yourself according to
[0:52] the modesty guidelines of the bible
[0:55] modesty guidelines the clothes we wear
[0:59] are very important to god
[1:01] modest clothing is not a suggestion as
[1:03] paul commands christians
[1:05] specifically women to wear modest
[1:07] clothing in 1st timothy 2 verse 9.
[1:10] paul undoubtedly received the revelation
[1:12] about modest clothing from jesus christ
[1:15] for he claims all his writings were
[1:17] inspired by christ
[1:19] this further proves jesus earnestly
[1:21] wants his followers
[1:22] to wear modest clothing modesty is a
[1:25] commandment for both
[1:26] women and men as the book of genesis
[1:29] teaches
[1:30] after adam and eve sinned modest clothes
[1:32] were so important that god himself came
[1:34] down to eden
[1:35] to provide a sacrifice for their sins
[1:37] and to clothe them in coats or
[1:40] tunics of skins we must stand for
[1:43] modesty because the bible teaches it
[1:45] just like we stand for the sanctity of
[1:47] life because god does
[1:49] teaching followers of christ to observe
[1:51] the commandments of christ is not
[1:52] legalism
[1:54] it is being loyal to jesus's commands
[1:56] just as jesus was loyal to all the
[1:58] father's commands
[2:00] in fact ministers are actually
[2:02] fulfilling jesus's great commission
[2:04] by teaching his disciples to observe the
[2:06] command for modest clothing
[2:08] for jesus admonishes his disciples to
[2:11] observe
[2:12] all his commandments
[2:15] every church was taught modesty
[2:18] every church paul visited heard the same
[2:21] course of conduct
[2:22] including the command for modest
[2:23] clothing does your church teach modest
[2:26] clothing
[2:27] it should god loves unity among his
[2:29] churches
[2:30] god knew that christians would serve god
[2:32] best when they all had the same
[2:34] expectations and course of conduct
[2:38] paul encouraged all christians to have
[2:39] one faith one mind
[2:41] and walk in the same judgment early
[2:44] christians were of one heart and soul
[2:46] and before the second coming of jesus
[2:48] christ all christians will come to a
[2:50] unity of faith
[2:51] in the word of god the true churches of
[2:54] jesus christ will be united on all of
[2:56] their teachings when jesus returns
[2:58] and modest clothing will be included in
[3:00] that group
[3:02] the apostle admonished the philippians
[3:04] to all mine the same rule
[3:05] or standard the greek word for rule is
[3:08] canon
[3:09] which means a carpenter's measuring tape
[3:11] or standard
[3:13] every christians use the same standard
[3:15] the word of god
[3:16] for measuring their lives
[3:19] redirecting attention to christ
[3:22] two dictionary definitions of modest are
[3:25] not revealing or emphasizing the figure
[3:28] and dressing to avoid indecency
[3:31] especially to avoid sexual attention
[3:34] a person who dresses modestly tries to
[3:36] redirect the attention
[3:37] from themselves to someone else our lord
[3:40] and savior jesus christ
[3:42] christians should be humble meaning that
[3:44] they should have a modest opinion
[3:46] of themselves as they consider their
[3:48] weaknesses
[3:49] faults and tendency to fail they should
[3:52] be so impressed with the strength
[3:54] righteousness and prevailing power of
[3:56] christ that they willingly redirect all
[3:59] attention to their lord
[4:02] just as institutions and businesses have
[4:05] guidelines
[4:06] or a course of conduct god's kingdom has
[4:08] its guidelines
[4:10] modest clothing guidelines provide
[4:11] protection boundaries assurance and
[4:14] safety
[4:15] you have probably seen school children
[4:17] wearing uniforms or sports teams
[4:19] clothed identically their outward
[4:22] appearance helps you identify their
[4:23] cause
[4:24] purpose and mission the same is true
[4:26] with christians
[4:27] their modest clothes proclaim their
[4:29] mission to magnify and glorify
[4:31] the lord jesus christ best of all
[4:35] when you choose to dress modestly in
[4:36] obedience the holy spirit gives you the
[4:39] invaluable
[4:40] blessed assurance that you desire in
[4:42] your daily life
[4:43] you will feel pure in your soul peter
[4:46] says obedience produces a feeling
[4:48] of a purified soul he wrote
[4:51] seeing ye have purified your souls in
[4:53] obeying the truth through the spirit
[4:55] unto unfeigned love of the brethren
[4:58] see that you love one another with a
[5:00] pure heart fervently
[5:02] paul says there are three parts to your
[5:04] being mind
[5:05] body and soul your mind and body may not
[5:08] feel pure as the mind is the battlefield
[5:11] of good and evil thoughts
[5:13] but your soul will feel clean from your
[5:15] obedience
[5:18] defining parts of the body by the bible
[5:22] in daniel chapter 2 the bible provides a
[5:24] five-part division of the human body
[5:26] we can use as an outline to help us
[5:29] understand boundaries
[5:30] for each body area daniel was allowed by
[5:33] god to see
[5:34] and interpret nebuchadnezzar's dream of
[5:36] the great image
[5:38] that represented the time of the
[5:39] gentiles led of god
[5:41] daniel saw god's division of the image's
[5:44] body into five parts
[5:46] the head the breast and arms the belly
[5:49] and thighs
[5:50] the legs and the feet this god-ordained
[5:54] division of the human image
[5:56] defines the five different areas of the
[5:58] body
[5:59] first the head division would include
[6:01] the head and neck
[6:03] with the lower boundary being the
[6:04] shoulder next the breasts and arms would
[6:07] include
[6:08] the area from the shoulder down to the
[6:10] bottom of the rib cage
[6:12] third the belly and thighs would begin
[6:15] under the ribs and continue
[6:16] down to the knee this region includes
[6:19] the area referred to in scripture as the
[6:21] loins
[6:22] which is the hips and reproductive area
[6:25] fourth the legs are the area from the
[6:27] shin down to the ankle
[6:29] last the foot division entails the area
[6:32] from the ankle
[6:33] down to the toes with these five
[6:36] divisions in mind
[6:37] god in his mercy has given us a clear
[6:40] upper and lower boundary for our bodies
[6:42] that he wants us to cover with clothing
[6:45] as a rule of thumb
[6:46] christians should cover from their
[6:48] shoulders down to their shins
[6:51] or put another way using the five
[6:52] divisions bible terminology
[6:55] from the breast and arms down past the
[6:57] belly and thighs
[6:59] the upper boundary must be the shoulder
[7:01] because exposed breasts
[7:02] can arouse lustful thoughts the shin or
[7:06] upper leg area below the knees
[7:08] is the lower boundary because exposed
[7:10] thighs and loins are nakedness
[7:13] undoubtedly inciting lustful thoughts
[7:16] whether a person is seated or standing
[7:22] 4 guidelines for modest clothing the
[7:24] bible defines the perfect will of god on
[7:26] how to dress modestly
[7:28] over time and through much study god
[7:30] revealed to me that there are four
[7:31] guidelines
[7:32] though possibly more christians should
[7:35] honor concerning their outward
[7:36] appearance
[7:38] cover nakedness thick clothing or
[7:41] multiple layers
[7:43] clothing loose clothing
[7:47] number one guideline cover nakedness
[7:51] the first guideline is to cover all
[7:52] areas of the body that god considers
[7:54] nakedness
[7:55] the scriptures that teach this guideline
[7:57] are genesis 3 verse 7
[7:59] and verse 21 isaiah 47 verses 1 through
[8:03] 3
[8:04] 1st kings 18 verse 46 and proverbs 31
[8:08] verse 17. in genesis 3
[8:12] verse 7 and 21 god provides the upper
[8:15] and lower boundaries for modest clothing
[8:17] the shoulder and the shin chapter 1
[8:19] covers god's own choice
[8:21] for clothing in the section titled the
[8:23] beginning and ending of modest clothing
[8:26] just as the unchanging god clothed adam
[8:28] and eve with modest
[8:29] full-length tunics we are sure he wants
[8:32] us closed so that our breasts
[8:34] belly loins thighs and knees are fully
[8:38] covered
[8:39] in isaiah 47 verses 1 through 3
[8:42] isaiah told the virgin daughter of
[8:44] babylon or people in the city of babylon
[8:47] that god would allow their nakedness to
[8:49] be uncovered
[8:51] in this case nakedness meant uncovered
[8:53] thighs
[8:54] or the area from the hips down to the
[8:56] knee
[8:57] thighs are clearly defined as one of the
[8:59] five divisions of the human body
[9:01] and christians should always wear
[9:03] clothes that cover the thighs
[9:04] and knees first kings
[9:08] 18 46 and proverbs 31 verse 17
[9:12] prove that the lower boundary for modest
[9:14] clothing is the shin
[9:15] when elijah ran to jezreel he girded up
[9:18] his loins
[9:19] meaning he gathered up the end of his
[9:21] loose robe
[9:22] which probably extended to his feet and
[9:25] tucked it into his belt
[9:26] or girdle so he could freely run by
[9:29] girding up his loins elijah would have
[9:31] exposed his feet
[9:32] ankles and shins but not his thighs
[9:36] the same idea is seen for women in
[9:37] proverbs 31 verse 17
[9:40] as the distinguished proverbs 31 woman
[9:43] girdeth up her loins with strength at
[9:46] times
[9:46] israeli men and women had to gird up
[9:48] their loins to do physical labor
[9:50] exposing their shins but were still able
[9:53] to cover the nakedness of their thighs
[9:55] it is important to note that unless
[9:57] israelis were involved in physical labor
[10:00] they spent the rest of their time with
[10:01] their robes untucked from their girdles
[10:04] presenting a more modest appearance that
[10:06] covered nearly all their legs
[10:10] more support for covering the shoulders
[10:12] breasts loins
[10:14] and legs there's much more scriptural
[10:17] support for covering the body
[10:18] from the breasts or shoulders down to
[10:21] the upper leg
[10:22] or shins i will start at the top of the
[10:24] body and work my way down
[10:28] some people wonder if the shoulder
[10:29] should be covered exposing the shoulders
[10:32] is nakedness in the sight of god based
[10:34] upon the definition of the tunic
[10:37] in genesis 3 21 a long shirt-like
[10:40] garment
[10:41] an ancient tunic would have certainly
[10:43] covered the shoulders
[10:44] and there are no scriptures that support
[10:46] exposing shoulders
[10:48] in public scripture proves exposing the
[10:51] breast
[10:52] or bosom area is considered nakedness
[10:55] the breasts of a woman are strictly
[10:56] accessible
[10:57] and visible to her lawful husband only
[11:00] whoredom either adultery or fornication
[11:03] is committed when anyone other than her
[11:05] husband presses or handles the breast of
[11:07] a woman
[11:09] women should wear clothes that cover
[11:10] their breasts and the rest of the body
[11:12] parts considered nakedness
[11:14] because jesus taught that men are often
[11:16] tempted to look upon women
[11:18] and lust with sexual desires in their
[11:20] hearts
[11:21] if these sexual sins whether committed
[11:23] in the mind or body
[11:25] are unconfessed those guilty will not
[11:27] inherit the kingdom of god
[11:29] and will burn in the lake of fire
[11:32] additionally there are 75 scriptures in
[11:35] the king james bible
[11:36] that reference the shoulders and none of
[11:38] them teach that exposing the shoulders
[11:41] is a godly act the israeli high priest
[11:44] is an example of covering the shoulders
[11:46] as he wore a garment called an ephod an
[11:49] apron-like garment
[11:50] which completely covered his shoulders
[11:52] before going into the presence of god
[11:54] this ephod was worn on top of the
[11:56] longest
[11:57] tunic-like garment the robe which
[12:00] covered the shoulders and extended to
[12:02] the feet
[12:04] god expresses that the uncovered loins
[12:06] and thighs are nakedness
[12:08] the lord instituted holy garments to
[12:10] cover the nakedness of the regular
[12:12] israeli priests during acts of worship
[12:15] in the tabernacle and temple
[12:18] god commanded the priests to wear
[12:20] breaches to cover from the waist to the
[12:22] thighs
[12:22] which were worn under the long outer
[12:24] robe
[12:25] as the priest ascended the elevated
[12:28] brazen altar
[12:29] worshipers may have seen the linen
[12:31] breeches under the priest's robe
[12:33] rather than the priest's nakedness
[12:37] the legs are not an area of nakedness
[12:39] but christians should wisely choose to
[12:41] cover more of their legs
[12:42] more of the time while both israeli men
[12:45] and women cover their legs
[12:47] one bible almanac writes that israeli
[12:49] women's robes
[12:50] always covered more of their legs than
[12:52] men as
[12:53] women usually covered all of their legs
[12:56] including the ankles and feet
[12:58] when physical work needed done both men
[13:00] and women girded their loins and god
[13:02] allowed their shins to be exposed
[13:04] for short periods of time
[13:08] the section ancient hebrew clothing in
[13:11] chapter 7
[13:12] elaborates on traditional hebrew
[13:14] clothing
[13:15] the book of revelation gives evidence
[13:17] that all of our legs will be covered in
[13:19] heaven
[13:20] as jesus christ's garment covered his
[13:22] breast and arms
[13:23] and extended all the way to his feet
[13:25] revelation 1 verse 13
[13:27] says john the apostle whom jesus loved
[13:31] saw a vision of jesus in his glorified
[13:33] body representing christ's supreme deity
[13:36] jesus was clothed in a garment down to
[13:38] the foot the greek lexicon defines
[13:40] garment as
[13:41] reaching to the feet ankles observe
[13:44] first that jesus was not showing off
[13:46] tone
[13:47] muscular arms abs legs and thighs
[13:50] like many do today he was not showing
[13:53] off any body part
[13:55] jesus was clothed modestly
[13:58] the lesson is that jesus christ himself
[14:00] will set the example for modest clothing
[14:02] in heaven
[14:03] jesus is the great shepherd according to
[14:05] hebrews 13 verse 20
[14:07] he leads the way for the sheep to follow
[14:10] jesus as a man
[14:11] models complete modesty and holiness in
[14:14] the clothing he wears throughout
[14:16] eternity what a blessing it is to know
[14:18] that god delights in modesty standards
[14:21] in this world and in the eternal world
[14:23] to come
[14:27] application to apply the cover nakedness
[14:31] guideline
[14:32] common sense tells you that exposing
[14:34] your breasts down to your thighs
[14:36] incites lustful thoughts in others
[14:39] remember to cover from your shoulders to
[14:40] your shins
[14:41] which is the minimum god's spirit
[14:43] convicts me to cover
[14:44] all of my legs down to my ankles for
[14:48] myself
[14:48] a man god calls me to spiritually lead
[14:51] my family and the church i pastor
[14:54] so i lead in modesty as well my clothing
[14:57] always covers from my shoulders down to
[14:59] my ankles
[15:00] i never wear shorts because they would
[15:02] expose my thighs
[15:03] all my pants reach at least to my ankles
[15:07] although christians do not wear robes
[15:08] today the bible does not command
[15:11] us to wear robes we must still cover the
[15:14] same
[15:14] real estate or body divisions that god
[15:16] considers nakedness
[15:21] number two guideline thick clothing or
[15:24] multiple layers the second guideline is
[15:26] to wear thick
[15:27] opaque clothing or multiple layers of
[15:30] clothes
[15:30] in order to redirect attention away from
[15:33] your body
[15:34] the scriptures that teach this guideline
[15:36] are genesis 3 21
[15:38] matthew 5 40 judges 3 16
[15:41] and john 21 verse 7. genesis 3 21
[15:45] teaches that god clothed adam and eve
[15:47] with coats of skins
[15:49] these skins were probably lambskins
[15:52] since it would fit god's nature to have
[15:54] the first
[15:54] animal sacrifices foreshadow the
[15:57] crucifixion of jesus christ
[15:59] who is the lamb of god who takes away
[16:01] the sin of the world
[16:03] if this was the case a lambskin tunic
[16:06] would be very thick
[16:07] this apparel would not reveal the form
[16:09] of the body nor would it be
[16:11] see-through making it very modest an
[16:14] easy example of the thickness of this
[16:16] type of clothing is to picture in your
[16:17] mind
[16:18] shearling or sheepskin boots god wanted
[16:21] thick clothing that did not reveal the
[16:23] form
[16:24] or private parts of the body god's
[16:26] fashion choices are so different from
[16:28] modern fashions
[16:30] layers of clothing are mentioned by
[16:32] jesus in matthew 5 40
[16:34] in which our lord spoke of one person
[16:36] owning both coats and cloaks
[16:38] in jesus time people needed multiple
[16:41] layers of clothes to keep warm during
[16:43] the cold conditions
[16:45] the coats jesus spoke of were thin
[16:47] shirt-like undergarments
[16:48] like tunics worn next to the skin
[16:52] these coats were the undergarment layer
[16:54] like underwear today
[16:55] but with much more cloth or material
[16:58] than our modern day underwear
[17:00] because tunics were like a very long
[17:02] shirt
[17:03] the cloak was the outer garment or
[17:05] outside garment worn on top
[17:07] of the tunic or coat another word for
[17:09] cloak is robe
[17:11] which is like the scarlet robe the roman
[17:13] soldiers put upon jesus
[17:15] this robe or cloak was an outer garment
[17:18] usually worn
[17:19] over the tunic judges 3 verse 16
[17:22] provides another example of these two
[17:24] layers
[17:25] coats and cloaks e hood the israeli
[17:29] deliverer
[17:29] hid a dagger under his outer garment by
[17:32] girding it
[17:33] to his right thigh girding the dagger
[17:35] meant binding or securing it
[17:37] in place using a belt or girdle ehood's
[17:41] dagger was hidden
[17:42] from the evil moabite king eglon because
[17:45] it was under his outer raiment
[17:47] or cloak
[17:52] it is important to state that god
[17:54] considered a person to be naked
[17:56] when he took off his outer garment his
[17:58] cloak or robe without the outer garment
[18:01] the person would be viewed in only his
[18:03] thin tunic
[18:04] undergarment while fishing peter had his
[18:07] outer garment
[18:08] off the fisher's coat and the bible
[18:10] records peter as being
[18:11] naked the reason peter was not sinning
[18:14] though
[18:15] was because he was among men only the
[18:17] other apostles
[18:19] jesus did a similar thing when he laid
[18:20] aside his garments before washing the
[18:22] apostles feet
[18:24] both peter and jesus did not sin for
[18:26] they were not around women
[18:28] when they took off their outer garments
[18:29] during work fishing
[18:31] or worship feet washing
[18:35] some erroneously believe david danced
[18:37] naked in public before the lord
[18:40] but according to scripture he wore at
[18:41] least two layers of clothing
[18:43] a robe of fine linen and an ephod of
[18:45] linen
[18:47] david's wife macau said he uncovered
[18:49] himself shamelessly in front of the
[18:51] hand-made servants
[18:53] based upon the context the only
[18:55] plausible meaning for
[18:56] uncovered is that david took off his
[18:58] royal clothing
[18:59] in order to be dressed in the same
[19:01] manner as the levites
[19:03] singers and chenanaya nevertheless the
[19:06] text proves
[19:07] michal's accusation against david was
[19:09] wrong for she died
[19:11] childless david on the other hand became
[19:14] more honored in his servant's eyes
[19:16] because he increased his rejoicing
[19:18] dancing and leaping before god
[19:23] application
[19:25] applying the second guideline means
[19:27] wearing at least two layers
[19:28] or one thick layer of clothing and
[19:31] abstaining from walking around in your
[19:33] underwear
[19:34] or undergarments in public appearing in
[19:37] public or at a pool
[19:38] or beach in a bathing suit would break
[19:40] god's word
[19:42] as most bathing suits and shorts only
[19:44] have one layer of thin clothing
[19:47] swimsuits almost always reveal the form
[19:49] of the body seductively
[19:51] exposing areas of the body that god
[19:53] considers nakedness
[19:58] number three guideline gender specific
[20:00] clothing
[20:02] the third guideline is to wear
[20:03] gender-specific clothing
[20:05] meaning men should wear men's clothing
[20:07] and women should wear women's clothing
[20:10] the scripture that directly teaches this
[20:11] guideline is deuteronomy 22 verse 5.
[20:15] three more scriptures support this
[20:16] guideline by emphasizing god's
[20:19] immutability
[20:20] and jesus example of not cross-dressing
[20:23] malachi 3 verse 6 hebrews 4 15
[20:27] and hebrews 13 verse 8.
[20:30] although deuteronomy 22 verse 5 is an
[20:33] old testament scripture
[20:35] there are two reasons it applies to
[20:36] christians
[20:38] first cross-dressing is called an
[20:40] abomination
[20:41] or disgusting thing and no new testament
[20:44] scripture permits it
[20:46] the reason old testament abominations
[20:48] remained detestable in the new
[20:50] is because god said he is unchanging his
[20:53] holy nature
[20:53] abhorred all evil aboundable acts
[20:56] yesterday
[20:57] and abhors them today and will abhor
[21:00] them forever
[21:01] for jesus christ is the same yesterday
[21:03] today and forever
[21:05] in the days of moses and jesus men and
[21:07] women could be easily differentiated
[21:10] visually just by looking at their outer
[21:12] clothing based upon deuteronomy 22 verse
[21:15] 5.
[21:16] obedient god-fearing jews wore
[21:18] gender-specific outer garments
[21:21] and so do christians today
[21:25] second jesus never cross-dressed like a
[21:27] woman
[21:28] hebrews 4 15 teaches that jesus never
[21:31] broke one old testament commandment
[21:34] since crossdressing was strictly
[21:36] forbidden in the law of moses
[21:38] jesus never wore clothes that pertained
[21:40] to a woman
[21:41] furthermore jesus instituted the new
[21:43] testament
[21:44] and the kingdom of god upon this earth
[21:47] while wearing men's garments
[21:49] jesus modeled and lived this standard
[21:51] during his earthly life
[21:53] if jesus is the same forever then he
[21:55] will remain dressed like a man forever
[21:57] throughout time
[21:58] and then into eternity
[22:04] two other bible references support the
[22:06] fact that god wants specific
[22:09] differences in the outward appearances
[22:11] of men and women
[22:13] first god commanded men to have short
[22:15] hair in women to have long
[22:16] uncut hair this means men and women need
[22:19] different
[22:19] hair lengths and outer garments second
[22:23] in king david's time
[22:24] great emphasis was placed upon the
[22:26] virginity of the king's daughters
[22:28] who wore garments of virginity while we
[22:31] find no record of virgin garments in the
[22:33] new testament
[22:34] this example shows that god's people
[22:36] always have a pattern
[22:38] of visually separating genders god wants
[22:41] his society
[22:42] to operate with defined god-given roles
[22:45] easily determined by gender outer
[22:47] garments and hair length
[22:52] when a society allows gender and
[22:54] clothing to become indistinguishable
[22:56] a state of confusion or babel occurs
[22:59] and god is not the author of confusion
[23:02] in 2015
[23:04] when bruce jenner publicly declared
[23:05] himself transgender
[23:07] and changed his name to caitlyn he was
[23:09] both widely praised and heavily
[23:11] scrutinized
[23:13] according to deuteronomy 22 verse 5 god
[23:15] considers this transgender act an
[23:17] abomination
[23:19] because a man bruce jenner is wearing
[23:21] the clothes of a woman
[23:23] what most people do not realize though
[23:26] is that the same public scrutiny that
[23:27] bruce jenner received
[23:29] partly for his cross-dressing as a woman
[23:32] was the same public scrutiny that women
[23:34] such as marlene dietrich and catherine
[23:36] hepburn
[23:37] received for wearing pants and dressing
[23:40] as men
[23:41] in the 1930s and 1940s
[23:44] not even 100 years ago the book
[23:47] women and pants by katherine smith and
[23:50] cynthia gregg
[23:51] fully documents the undeniable history
[23:54] of the scrutiny that surrounded women
[23:56] who first began cross-dressing and
[23:58] wearing men's pants
[24:02] application based upon america's
[24:05] judeo-christian foundation
[24:07] american men should always wear pants
[24:09] and women should always wear dresses or
[24:11] skirts
[24:12] without compromise at all times and in
[24:15] all situations
[24:16] other nations may have different types
[24:18] of clothes that pertain to gender
[24:21] for nearly 200 years our country honored
[24:24] the gender-specific clothing guideline
[24:26] but acceptance for cross-dressing became
[24:29] popular in the 1960s and 1970s
[24:32] as chapter 6 details
[24:38] number four guideline loose clothing
[24:42] the fourth guideline is to wear loose
[24:43] clothing as taught in genesis 3 verse 21
[24:46] first kings 19 verse 13 mark 16
[24:50] verse 5 revelation 6 verse 11
[24:53] revelation 7 verse 14 and proverbs 7
[24:57] verse 10.
[24:59] in genesis 3 verse 21 and 1st kings 19
[25:02] verse 13
[25:03] the outer garments coats for adam and
[25:06] eve and a mantle for elijah
[25:08] were loose-fitting garments as
[25:10] previously taught adam and eve's animal
[25:13] skin tunics
[25:14] were thick and long but also loose
[25:16] fitting
[25:17] god never asked anyone to wear tight
[25:19] clothing so loose clothes
[25:21] are his unchanging holy pattern elijah's
[25:24] mantle was
[25:25] undoubtedly loose as he could not have
[25:27] wrapped a
[25:28] skin-tight mantle around his face since
[25:31] robe materials
[25:32] like linen and camel hair are not
[25:34] stretchy
[25:36] the entire heavenly host of angels wear
[25:39] loose-fitting robes
[25:40] mark 16 verse 5 describes the angel's
[25:43] attire
[25:44] on resurrection morning as a long white
[25:47] garment
[25:48] the greek lexicon defines garment as a
[25:50] loose outer garment
[25:52] for men extending to the feet
[25:58] loose long clothing is the will of
[26:00] heaven in revelation 7 verse 14
[26:03] multitudes of christians who are washed
[26:05] in the blood of jesus
[26:06] will also wear loose white robes in
[26:08] heaven
[26:09] similar to those the angels wear the
[26:12] word robes in revelation 7
[26:14] 14 has the same greek meaning as garment
[26:17] from mark 16 verse 5 a loose outer
[26:20] garment for men
[26:21] extending to the feet it is clear that
[26:24] every person with eternal life
[26:26] will be clothed in loose long white
[26:28] robes for all eternity
[26:30] if we are going to spend all eternity
[26:32] with loose clothes
[26:33] that cover our bodies according to the
[26:35] wisdom and design of god himself
[26:37] then we should be happy to start wearing
[26:39] loose clothing right now
[26:41] when you live your life here on earth
[26:43] according to the will of heaven
[26:45] and wear loose long clothing you are
[26:47] letting the will of heaven come down to
[26:49] earth
[26:50] this is the fulfillment of the lord's
[26:51] prayer thy will be done
[26:53] in earth as it is in heaven
[26:57] proverbs 7 verse 10 speaks of a harlot
[26:59] or prostitute
[27:00] with an evil heart she has the attire of
[27:04] an harlot
[27:05] even in the old testament days certain
[27:07] garments pertain to harlots
[27:09] as genesis 38 verses 14
[27:12] through 19 speaks of in reference to
[27:15] tamar
[27:16] according to god's truth that there is
[27:18] nothing new under the sun
[27:20] harlots today just like thousands of
[27:22] years ago
[27:23] dress in a way that attracts the
[27:25] attention of men
[27:26] prostitutes are known for wearing tight
[27:29] revealing clothing
[27:30] breaking the bible commands for loose
[27:32] clothing that also
[27:34] covers areas of the body god considers
[27:36] nakedness
[27:38] from a logical standpoint christians
[27:39] must avoid wearing tight clothing
[27:41] because it draws the wrong kind of
[27:43] attention to the body
[27:46] application christians should wear loose
[27:49] clothes at all times
[27:50] not drawing sexual attention to
[27:52] themselves god never asks
[27:54] anyone to wear tight outer garments and
[27:57] he won't start now
[27:59] loose clothes make up both our earthly
[28:01] and heavenly wardrobes
[28:05] putting your clothes to the test based
[28:08] upon these four
[28:08] modest clothing guidelines you can now
[28:11] begin to recognize
[28:12] examples of immodest clothing and give
[28:14] your clothes
[28:15] the word test you can keep the clothes
[28:17] that pass the four guideline tests
[28:20] and send the immodest clothes to your
[28:22] local second hand store
[28:24] to help you get started i made a list of
[28:26] clothes that would most certainly be
[28:28] considered
[28:29] immodest according to the four bible
[28:31] guidelines
[28:32] mini skirts sun dresses high slit skirts
[28:36] low cut dresses shorts short shorts
[28:39] skinny jeans yoga pants halter or tube
[28:43] tops sheer blouses
[28:45] most swimsuits and bikinis and tank tops
[28:48] just to name a few if you have a
[28:51] question about whether an article of
[28:53] clothing
[28:53] is modest use the four guidelines to
[28:56] determine if the clothing is pleasing to
[28:58] god
[28:58] if you feel the four guidelines still do
[29:01] not answer your question
[29:02] then you should ask god to reveal his
[29:04] wisdom while waiting for god's
[29:06] revelation from the bible
[29:08] you should refrain from wearing the
[29:09] questionable clothing until you can
[29:11] prove by scripture
[29:12] that it is pleasing to god scripture
[29:15] declares that god seeks to give us
[29:16] abundant wisdom but we must not doubt
[29:19] that god will provide
[29:20] the correct course of action for doubt
[29:23] will lead us
[29:23] to missing the wisdom of god refraining
[29:26] from wearing questionable clothes
[29:28] shows that you have patience the fear of
[29:31] the lord
[29:31] and a desire to please god more than men
[29:34] ask god for patience for in patience you
[29:37] will possess your soul
[29:38] and have need of nothing
[29:43] conclusion the bible declares that its
[29:46] words are inspired of god
[29:48] and are profitable for doctrine reproof
[29:50] correction and instruction
[29:52] that the christian may be complete and
[29:54] furnished unto every good work
[29:56] in regards to the four guidelines for
[29:58] modest clothing a sufficient amount of
[30:00] scripture provides us
[30:02] with an unwavering doctrinal stand upon
[30:05] the witnesses of holy writ
[30:07] through nearly two decades of bible
[30:09] study i have never found the bible
[30:10] supporting clothes
[30:12] that contradict the four guidelines i
[30:14] have confidence in my creator
[30:16] that his desire and command for modest
[30:18] clothing has never changed and never
[30:20] will
[30:21] it is possible that god may reveal to me
[30:23] a fifth or perhaps sixth guideline
[30:26] in the future as i wait upon the lord
[30:28] for further revelation
[30:29] he will certainly renew my strength as
[30:31] the eagle
[30:32] god will empower me to run the christian
[30:34] race without weariness
[30:36] and walk without fainting
[30:39] i conclude this chapter in hope that you
[30:41] will now have an answer to anyone who
[30:43] asks you about the reason you choose
[30:45] to clothe yourself in such a modest
[30:48] beautiful
[30:48] but often times unpopular way you can
[30:51] say with confidence
[30:53] god has four clearly defined guidelines
[30:55] for modest clothing
[30:56] and i am following his commands in
[30:58] meekness and fear
