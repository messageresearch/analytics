TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] I agree disagree with the Baptist but the Presbyterians and their systems but in there these genuine Christians greetings friends in the mattress name of the Lord Jesus Christ purpose of this video is to answer a viewer's question about the Asbury Revival that's going on in Wilmore Kentucky so as message believers who follow the bible-based revelations that God gave to his Prophet William Branham what should be our reaction to this so-called Revival by God's grace our reaction should be to examine it by the word of God and hope that some people are genuinely getting saved which means justified by the Holy Ghost and hopefully by God's grace some are getting partial sanctification by the Holy Ghost as well which we'll explain in this short video I'll begin with what is the Revival and what is it producing on February 8th of this year 2023 at a chapel service at the University of Asbury in Wilmore Kentucky college students stayed after the service and kept worshiping and apparently seeking God and praying repenting of sins and this service has never stopped it's been ongoing for about 11 days if I'm not mistaken by the grace of God there's lots of videos online that you can see about this revival there's testimonies of people repenting of their sins there's also testimonies of physical healings there's lots of worship and praise going on and it's possible that even one demon was cast out in these meetings now if these are genuine works of the Holy Spirit then as a message believer I would Rejoice if people are genuinely getting saved repenting of their sin drawing closer to God and if a demon was cast out I would rejoice in that as well remember friends even David cast out demons out of Saul in the Old Testament and while Jesus was on Earth remember there was a man who was not following Jesus that was casting out devils and Jesus let him keep casting out devils and said he that is not against us is for us so I have not physically attended the Asbury Revival I live about six hours north of Wilmore but now let's look at what is Revival according to the Greek definition in the New Testament Revival has at least two meanings the first is to live again as in Jesus's resurrection so this is a physical Revival from the dead the second definition is probably what defines the Asbury Revival it's to be restored to a correct life of one who returns to a better moral State and it can also mean to regain strength and vigor so the second definition is probably what's going on at Asbury if indeed people are getting a genuine Holy Ghost Revival what's happening is college students or even adults are getting restored to a correct life they've probably heard about Jesus maybe they've claimed to believe in Jesus Through the anointing of the Holy Spirit and the worship going on perhaps some of them are repenting of their sins that they know are wrong and trying to live a correct Life Again by the grace of God perhaps some of the college students and adults had been weakened in their faith and now in this group worship they're finding strength maybe they're finding the joy of the Lord after repenting of their sins now what's interesting about this revival is that I've been preaching on the Azusa Street Revival since January 29th so a little over a week before this revival broke out in Asbury and brother Branham said the Azusa Street Revival was the greatest Revival or outpouring of the Holy Ghost since the day of Pentecost so let's listen to the quote a man in California a negro one crossed out give him the experience of the baptism of the Holy Ghost from there formed Azusa Street the old Azusa Street Mission from that scattered to a sweat the whole nation from Nation went to Nation after Nation God had provided for them one of the greatest revivals that this nation has ever known I don't care what it was there's never been a Revival like the Pentecostal Revival right Wesley never had none of him Wisconsin Calvin Knox great reformers but they never had to revive like the Pentecostal Revival the greatest thing that struck the Earth since the Holy Ghost fell on the day of Pentecost also I think it's important to show that through the study of scripture I found at least six types of Revival I have a video about this but at that point I only had recognized four of the types of Revival but now I believe they're six by God's grace so let's go through these as we go through these six type of revivals we'll be able to see what kind of Revival may be happening in Asbury the first type of Revival is National Revival and of course this is not happening in the United States brother random said it's thus saith the Lord the United States will never have a national Revival the Bible does record National revivals for Israel of course in the days of David Solomon when the Queen of Sheba visited she'd never seen such a Revival like that Revival and brother Brandon said it was because all the people rallied around Solomon's gift of course I was a short-lived Revival because Solomon fell away from his wisdom and built Alters unto every false god of his thousand wives but also in the days of Hezekiah there's great Revival which is recorded in Second Kings 18. they tore down all the high places or worship of false Idols they crushed all the physical idols and they restored the house of God also you see a Revival in the days of Josiah in second chronicles 34. they found the word of God they rent their clothes because they were so ashamed of all the sins they'd been committing but the word of God they read impacted them and they repented their sins and started keeping the Commandments of God the second type of Revival is a church age Revival and of course this is the Revival that started in 1906 for the laodicean church age through William Seymour whom brother Branham spoke very highly of and Friends history says that as the Azusa Street Revival went on Seymour realized tongues were not the evidence of the Holy Ghost Seymour realized that the Divine love of Jesus Christ was the evidence and that lines up with what brother random said as well because God is love when God comes into your soul and abides there permanently that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that will produce all the fruits of the spirit that will help you believe and receive the message of your hour so it's likely Asbury is not getting the church age Revival unless they go all the way on to the baptism of the Holy Ghost the third type of Revival is the latter rain Revival this is spoken of at James 5 verse 7 the early and the latter rain we know brother Adam's Ministry was the early Reign the teaching rain and we know rapturing faith is the latter rain so it does not appear that the Asbury Revival is the lateran Revival because that will be falling upon the Bride of Jesus Christ who believes all the Bible revelations that God gave to his Prophet brother Branham the fourth type of Revival is the Soul Revival this is a personal one-time Revival of the Soul or this is called the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's unlikely Asbury students and faculty are receiving this four type of Revival and here's the proof of that recently I made a video about milk Christianity versus me Christianity from Hebrews chapter 5 verses 10 through chapter 6 verse 3. and as you can see on your screen here's six beginning or Elementary doctrines a Christian has to receive before they can move on to Perfection which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost so the first one is repentance from dead works hopefully some people at the Asbury Revival are repenting of their sins but how many will repent of all their dead works such as watching porn watching dirty movies watching sports how many will put on Modest clothes on some of the videos I saw girls in shorts and of course they're revealing their thighs and thighs our nakedness according to Isaiah chapter 47 I saw girls with short hair and a woman who cuts her hair is a dishonor to her husband if she's married or it's a dishonor to her father if she's single so we don't really know the depths of repentance that those at Asbury are actually receiving and pressing into second Faith towards God are those who are getting Revival in Asbury is there faith in God or the word the word of this hour the mysteries of God being finished justification entire sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost third do they have the doctrine of baptisms do they know there's a lord Jesus Christ water baptism and a soul baptism the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's likely they don't on the statement of faith website for Asbury University they State they are trinitarians so we plainly know they don't have the correct water baptism that's a shame but will they have such a Revival where they press into the things of God in order to understand the doctrine of baptisms only time will tell fourth laying on of hands do they recognize the power of laying on hands praying for the sick casting out Devils it seems they may have some understanding of this if indeed a woman did get a devil cast out of her but then the question arises well that woman who was set free will she clean out her house as Jesus taught in Matthew chapter 12 and fill it with the Holy Ghost so more demons don't come in fifth resurrection of the Dead do they have the understanding that there's two resurrections and not just one there's a Rapture Resurrection which is called the first resurrection and then there's the resurrection of the Dead to the white Throne judgment and six and finally Eternal judgment friends it's unlikely they understand that hell is not eternal Asbury University is a Wesleyan University so they follow some of the teachings of God's messenger John Wesley but of course not all do they believe that hell is not Eternal as the Bible says or do they believe that Sinners will burn eternally and of course we know Sinners cannot burn eternally because they do not have eternal life moving on to the fifth type of Revival this is the Revival in the human Spirit which Paul says it is a transformation of the Mind in Romans 12. and he says in the book of Ephesians that were to be renewed day by day so this is the daily Revival of the human spirit I believe this is the type of Revival some people are probably experiencing it Asbury they let their minds get focused on the things of the world maybe politics or as we said Wicked sins like pornography or maybe the NFL or NBA worldly things worldly music money riches cares of this life and they've realized they've sinned and so they're coming to God they're drawing night to God and regaining strength in their human mind to focus on things of God more often than the things of the world so to me that's likely the Revival that they're having at Asbury they're getting their minds more focused on God but again that doesn't mean their souls are baptized with the Holy Ghost because they've got to be justified saved Sanctified and this is the step most of them are probably lacking living a full Sanctified life and then having their souls baptized with the Holy Ghost and the sixth type of Revival is the physical Revival like Jesus's body was revived at his resurrection this was in Romans 14 verse 9 for to this end Christ both died and Rose and revived and also we wonder what will this revival eventually produce well it's my guess it'll probably produce the same thing that the 1970 Asbury Revival produced so this University had a Revival in 1970 about 52 or 53 years ago and there's videos about it I watched some of them on YouTube and It produced justification for people people claim to get saved and some level of sanctification now some of the people they interviewed were men and women some of the men went into full-time preaching Ministry or became missionaries for the Wesleyan Church or the Methodist Church which is good but we know that's not the full word of God that's not a full baptism of the Holy Ghost message and of course there were women that got saved and they testified and on the videos they had makeup on they had cut hair they were wearing pants so again the 1970 Revival didn't produce a fully Sanctified and cleaned out life so it's my guess that this current Asbury Revival will probably produce the same thing and again I'm not criticizing these individuals but I'm examining all of their lives according to the full revealed word of God which God promised to do in Revelation 10 verse 7 finish the mystery of God Jesus said in Matthew 17 11 Elijah would become and restore all things so he's restored modesty he's restored Holiness he's restored entire sanctification Saints I believe this revival is also this generation's chance to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost as brother Branham said each generation gets a shot at receiving the word of God and it reminds me of Matthew 25 with the parable of the wise and foolish virgins both virgins get the wake-up call in every generation to receive the holy ghost or not so I believe this is this generation's opportunity they're in Asbury to get Justified Sanctified and go all the way to the Holy Ghost it's my humble opinion if they stay at that University they probably won't get the full baptism of the Holy Ghost but by God's grace some of them will be justified and partially Sanctified and if those are genuine experiences and they keep those experiences I believe they'll be saved friends I do believe that Asbury people can be saved just like the type of the wise and foolish virgins Abraham was the separated holy ghost-filled type he was separated unto God lot was the type of the foolish virgin closely associated with things of the world and yet the Bible called him a righteous soul in second Peter chapter two so we have wise Christians and we have foolish Christians are the Asbury Christians are they wise enough to repent of watching the Super Bowl the wicked halftime show the filthy commercials are they willing to delete all their worldly music and stop watching filthy movies are they ready to pray and fast for the baptism of the Holy Ghost are they ready to pay tithes and offerings are they ready to gather more with Saints as they see that day approaching are they willing to dress modestly and live holy unto the Lord and Friends brother Brandon believed denominational people could be saved as long as they were sincerely trusting in the blood of Jesus Christ in the seventh seal sermon brother Branham said any individual Catholic Jewish or whatever it might be Methodist Baptist Presbyterian any organization God has children sitting out in there so brother Ram said plainly God has children this must mean foolish virgins out there in the Catholic Church the Jewish Church Methodist Baptist Presbyterian any questions and answers part 1 1964 brother Ram said he sent three quarters of a million of his converts to the Assembly of God Church he said he's not against the people he's against every system that separates men and then he said he'd be a hypocrite to send his own children to death so he was telling the people the Assemblies of God is Not death there are some people that are saved in there and then in part two he said the same thing I disagree with the Assemblies of God but there's a many Assembly of God man that's a precious brother I disagree with Oneness Doctrine but but there's a many of those men are precious men I disagree with the Baptist with the Presbyterians and their systems but in there there's genuine Christians so I would say the same thing for the Asbury Revival there's probably genuine Christians in there but remember Jesus said few there be that find it and the same thing applies to message churches few there be that find the narrow road that leads to life in closing friends I hope this short video has been a help to you if you've been wondering about the Asbury Revival or just revivals in general again I've been praying for Revival this year for myself and our local church which is what we should all be praying for according to Saint Paul but ultimately friends we should be praying for the latter rain Revival again found in the book of James and brother Brown said the latter rain is rapturing faith we're looking for that final Revival the bride's Revival where God pours out rapturing Grace upon the Saints so their bodies can be changed in a moment and twinkling of an eye of course no man knows the day or the hour of the rapture but the Bible says we know the seasons of The Rapture in first Thessalonians chapter 5. so may each one of us seek daily Revival for our minds if we're not born again may we seek that one Revival of the soul the baptism of the Holy Ghost the Sea of the Holy Ghost and may we press toward the mark of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus friends this is our opportunity in our generation to receive the Revival that we need as message Believers we want the Revival in our souls the baptism of the Holy Ghost so we'll be the wise virgins and ready to meet Jesus at his appearing if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
