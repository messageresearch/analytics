TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Long hair is a a Nazerite bow. It showed that you've cut yourself from the world to obey the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Samson, let his hair grow out for a Nazerite bow. &gt;&gt; Greetings, friends, in the mattress name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of this video [music] is to answer a viewer's question about Samson. This is an excellent question and I'll just read his question here. I received through email. So it says in 1 Corinthians 14:1, it is said that it is a shame [music] for a man to have long hair. And I say amen to that. But I am a little bit confused [music] about Samson who had long hair. Please could you shed some light on this for me? [music] Again, an excellent question. If it's a shame for a man to have long hair according to 1 Corinthians 11, then why could Samson have long hair? And that's what we'll look at here today by God's grace. Let's start with the scripture. 1 Corinthians 11 1-16. It's important to look at the beginning of this chapter because Paul gives the eternal headship for the entire universe. At the head of everything is God, the invisible spirit. Under God is Christ, the son, the body of God. Since God's invisible, he needed a visible body. That's his son, Jesus Christ. Under Jesus Christ is man and under man is woman. And then Paul after laying this out goes into the meaning of hair. In verse 6 he says it's a shame for a woman not to be covered with her covering which is her long uncut hair whether she's shorn or shaven. It's a shame whether it's trimmed cut or totally shaved off. It's a shame for a woman to either trim shorn or shave her head because she's in the image of man. She's to the glory of man. And then the Bible says in verse 14, "Does not even nature itself teach you that if a man have long hair, it's a shame unto him?" Verse 15 is the key verse for women because it says, "Her hair is given her for a covering, not a doily, not a hat, not a cap. No man-made hair covering is required for a woman by God. God only requires her long uncut hair as a covering." So again, in verse 14 says, "It's a shame for man to have long hair. Why did Samson and other men have long hair in the Old Testament? That's a great question. The answer is in Numbers chapter 6 where God says, "If any man make a vow unto me, then he's going to separate himself for God's purpose for a time and season of his life." And so from this text, it looks like men and women could take vows to God and they would either last a lifetime or a short-term vow by the grace of God. We know Samson's was a lifetime vow as the book of judges tells us. So it was not a shame for Samson to have long uncut hair because he was under a vow to God. He was under a purpose to God. And the long uncut hair symbolizes full obedience to God, under the full authority of God. And that's what it represents for a woman in the New Testament as well and the Old Testament. Her long uncut hair represented she was under full obedience to her husband. So when a woman cuts her hair, she's showing she's not under the headship of her husband. And that denies and shames her head, which is her husband. And then that shames the head of the husband, which is Christ. And then that shames the head of Christ, which is God Almighty, the invisible spirit of God. So long uncut hair represents being under complete headship according to 1 Corinthians 11:1-16 and Ephesians 4:24, where the Bible says the woman should be subject to her husband in everything. Listen, a hair to a woman is a Nazerite bow. Hair to Samson was a Nazerite bow. And when a woman cuts off her hair, she she absolutely denies her Nazerite bow that she is a bride to Christ. Because there that one thing, she spoils the whole picture. correctly. A Nazerite is one that is consecrated for a purpose. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; Samson was consecrated to a age and to a purpose. Therefore, he had long hair. The woman that's a child of God lets her hair grow to show she's consecrated to every word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. If she cuts it off, I don't care how much she dances, sings, send a choir, speaks in tongues, runs up and down, or has all kind of aid society, she's dead. &gt;&gt; That's thus saith the Lord. &gt;&gt; The word of God. 1 Corinthians 14. Amen. &gt;&gt; She has denied her NAZERITE VOW AND SOLD OUT TO THE GOD OF THIS MODERN AGE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; She doesn't. Now, shame on you, lady or woman. &gt;&gt; Now, I have six videos about hair length. If you like to watch those, I'll put links to those in the description. Two on long hair and the Bible. One on braided or braided hair. Another on hair tinting or hair coloring. A fifth one on women are spiritually dead if they cut their hair according to 1 Corinthians 11 and other verses on the video where a woman cannot be born again if she shames her head because that shames Christ and God. And then lastly, can a man divorce his wife if she cuts her hair? So if you're interested in this topic, please watch those videos by God's grace and share them if you feel led by the Holy Ghost. So Samson was under a lifelong full headship under Jehovah. Those men that were not under the lifelong Nazarite vow for hair would cut their hair at the end of the vow as we see Paul did in the book of Acts. So in the Old Testament when people would see Samson with long uncut hair, they knew he was a Nazarite. He was set apart for the service of the Lord. It was not a shame for him to have that because they knew God has a purpose for his life. He needs to obey God in everything. But if any man would just grow his hair long in the Old Testament, that would have been a shame as well. We can see clearly it was a shame for Abselon to have that long flowing locks of hair because it's what caused him to get his hair caught in the tree and then that led to his death as well. So we can see how it's so important for a man to cut his hair today. And the Old Testament, it was important as well. Unless you were under a Nazerite vow. &gt;&gt; Long hair is a a Nazerite vow. It showed that you've cut yourself from the world to obey the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Samson let his hair grow out for a Nazerite bow. Now we realizing these things and women dressing and acting AND DOING MAN PERMITTING HIM TO DO IT. &gt;&gt; Big bunch of sissies. It seems like there's not even man anymore. You see men wearing pink shoes AND AND PREACHERS ON THE PULPIT SOMETHING LIKE THAT. THAT'S A DISGRACE. &gt;&gt; I LIKE TO SEE MAN AGAIN. THAT'S ABSOLUTELY MAN. LOOK LIKE THERE'S A POWER THAT DRIVES THEM TO DO IT. IT'S A DEVIL IN the pressure of this name. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Now, let's go a little further and look at more revelations on Samson typing Christ. This is what I emailed the brother as well. And then I went and did some other research on it. So, we can see some of these types here by God's grace. In Judges 13 and 14, Samson has this experience with this deceased lion. And then honey is found in the lion. And he tells us in Judges 14, this is a riddle of out of the eater comes sweetness. And so this is a beautiful type of Christ. Christ is the lion of the tribe of Judah. And in his death, we find honey. In his death, we find sweetness. In his death, we find healing and strength because he was wounded for our transgressions. He was bruised for our iniquities. The chastisement of our peace was upon him. And with his stripes, we were healed. The Bible says we already were healed. So it's a beautiful type of Jesus Christ dying for our sins and through his death we gain healing. We gain everything we need for this earthly journey through the death of the lion of the tribe of Judah. Second, we also see in Judges 14 that Samson wanted a gentile wife and then had a feast that lasted seven days. This is a beautiful type of the seven gentile church ages from Revelations chapters 1, 2, and 3. as brother N wrote the exposition of the seven church ages and then the mystery of the riddle was fulfilled on the seventh day which I believe is a type of revelation 10:7 brother's ministry because the mystery of God was finished by the seventh angel and someone recently criticized me saying brother Ram didn't finish the mysteries of God well you're too late to tell me that by God's grace I wrote a book about 12 New Testament mysteries brother Brandham finished six of them are with thus sayith the Lord so we can clearly see how brother Brandham finished the mystery of God All the Bible defined mysteries, Brother Ram taught us the true revelation on them. And as I just read this morning, never forget the keystone of the Bible that God is unchanging and so are his ways. That relates to the seven church ages, the seven church age messengers and the bride of Jesus Christ down through the seven church ages. We must always try to be like the book of Acts church. Strive to be like the book of Acts church. And thankfully, God said he'd restore the book of Acts. The fullness of Pentecost would be in the bride with us, sayith the Lord. as brother Ram said in the church age book in the last chapter of the resume of the ages and his verse was Joel 2:23-26. So please read that. You'll see God vindicate that in the years to come before the rapture. He's already vindicating it but he'll continue to do that because it's thus sayith the Lord. Let's look at a few more types here of Samson. He destroyed more in his death than in his life. And that's what Jesus did. that Jesus destroyed more spiritual wickedness, principalities through his death than he did in his life. The book of Colossians says this in chapter 2. The Bible said he spoiled principalities and powers. He made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it. in Colossians 2:15 and it connects to Calvary because verse 14 in Colossians 2 says he blotted out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us which was contrary to us and took it out of the way nailing it to his cross. Next, Samson was born to destroy the Philistines and Jesus was born to defeat Satan according to 1 John 3:8. For this purpose the son of God was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil. That means destroy them in our lives. Of course, we know the devil's still working right now. Jesus did not destroy all the works of the devil yet, but he will. But he's destroying the works of Satan in the lives of the believers. As I believe the book of Romans says, Jesus will bruise Satan shortly under our feet by God's grace. Yes, it's Romans 16:20. By God's grace. So, let's look at a few more types here. Both had miraculous announcements before their birth. Speaking of Samson and Jesus, Samson's miraculous birth was announced in Judges 13:3. His mother was barren, but the angel said, "Thou shalt conceive and bear a son." In Luke 1:31, Mary was told, "Thou shalt conceive in thy womb, bring forth a son, and shall call his name Jesus." Next, both were born to be deliverers. Judges 13:5, "He shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines." and Matthew 1:21, he shall save his people from their sins. And we know the word save is salvation. It means deliverance. Both were Nazerites. Although Samson was a physical Nazarite. Jesus was a spiritual Nazarite. We know Jesus drank a little wine, but the wine of his day is not the same as wine today. From what I've read, it's a lot less alcoholic content. And Jesus also said, "I sanctify myself for their sakes." In John 17:1 19, the main thing is that Jesus was a Nazerite against sin. He [clears throat] was a Nazerite from sin. Jesus never sinned. Hallelujah. Next, both were betrayed for silver. In Judges 16:5, Delilah sold out or betrayed Samson for,00 pieces of silver and Jesus was betrayed for 30 pieces of silver according to Matthew 16:15. Both betrayed by someone close to them. betrayed for money and handed over to their enemies. Both were bound by their enemies. Samson was bound in Judges 15 verse 13. And Jesus was bound and led away in Matthew 27:2. Both were mocked by their enemies. Samson was mocked in Judges 16:25. Call for Samson that he may make a sport. And in Matthew 27:29, they bowed the knee before him and mocked the Lord Jesus. They were publicly humiliated, treated as entertainment, and surrounded by enemies at their weakest point. Both had outstretched arms in their death. In Judges 16, 29 and 30, Samson took hold of the two middle pillars and bowed himself with all of his might. So, we see the outstretched arms of Samson. And of course, Jesus had his arm stretched out, nailed down to the cross. Samson stretched himself between two pillars. And Jesus was stretched out on a cross between two thieves. And again, Samson's greatest victory came through death. He slew more in his death than they which he slew in his life. Judges 16:30. And we went through Colossians 2:14 and 15. Jesus's greatest victory came through his death. Both achieved victory through their weakness. After Samson was blinded, bound, and mocked, then the victory came. And of course, as Jesus was smitten, beaten, bruised, bloodied, after that came the victory of the cross. Second Corinthians 13:4 says, "For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by the power of God." So it looked like total defeat and weakness became a total victory. Next, both died surrounded by their enemies. Samson died in the Philistine temple and Jesus died surrounded by Roman soldiers, Jewish leaders, and mockers. So the victory came in the middle of the camp of the enemy. Both were rejected by their own people. In Judges 15:11, the Israelites said, "Knowest thou not that the Philistines are rulers over us? What is this that thou hast done unto us?" And then John 1:11, he came unto his own, and his own received him not. God's deliverers were rejected by the very people they were sent to save. And lastly, both had a final cry right before their death. In Judges 16:28, Samson said, "Oh Lord God, remember me. I pray thee that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines." And Jesus on the cross in Luke 23:46 said, "Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit. Both died praying to God Almighty." How beautiful. Now remember friends, there's differences in types. Very rarely are there perfect types. So we have to be careful how we use typology because we see some clear differences between Samson and the Lord Jesus. Samson was a sinful man. Jesus was a sinless man, a sinless God man. Samson wanted revenge. Jesus wanted redemption. Jesus prayed for forgiveness. Samson killed physical enemies. Jesus defeated spiritual enemies. Satan, death, hell, and the grave. And Samson died and stayed dead until Jesus died and then rose again and brought up many of the Old Testament saints with him. According to Matthew chapter 27, we believe Samson would have been resurrected as well because he was in the Hall of Fame of faith in Hebrews chapter 11. In closing, friends, I hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God. Excellent question there from the brother on the email. And then as I thought about it more and more, I wanted to find all these types of Christ and Samson. Beautiful picture there. May we be like Samson and cry, "Oh Lord," once more, Lord, give us the power again. Give us grace. Give us favor. Give us victory over our enemies. May that be our prayer today. My brother Cam preached that to us years ago in 2010, and we cried out to God, and God gave us many wonderful testimonies of his power. So, let's do that again by the grace of God. I'm sure all of us can relate to Samson at some point. Maybe at one time we had the power of God with us. We were operating under the power of God. So submissive to it. But then we made mistakes. But we can learn from Samson's life that we cry out just once more, Lord. Like Samson remembered. He had the hair grown back. He remembered the covenant. Let us remember the covenant God has made for us. God kept the covenant for us. He brought us into the covenant. It's the greatest covenant so far. The blood of the Lord Jesus Christ. Where God writes his word upon the fleshly tables of our hearts. where God's spirit causes us to keep the word of God. Brother Rand often prayed for revivals for his own life. Here's two quotes in particular. Why Christ speak? This is after the seals July 1463. He says, "What ought it to do to us? We need a repentance. We need a revival. I'm saying myself, see, I need a shaking. I need something. I said I was speaking to myself this morning or about myself. I I I need awakening up." So, brother Rams recognized even after the seals, he needed revival, a personal revival in his life. And then in images of Christ 1959, so four years before that, while the Brandham tabernacle is having a revival, I want one myself. I just don't want it to happen in the building. I want it to happen in me. I want a closer walk. So, if you feel that way today, cry out to God. God is faithful. God hears our requests. Let us wait upon the Lord. He'll renew our strength like the eagle. just once more. Lord, if you have any questions, concerns or testimonies about this video, please contact [music] me. God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart. Very happy to be here this afternoon and again in defense of the gospel of Jesus Christ to bring the good tidings, the good news that Jesus raised from the dead, living among man today, his church. The same Jesus that was yesterday will be today and forever. He has never failed.
