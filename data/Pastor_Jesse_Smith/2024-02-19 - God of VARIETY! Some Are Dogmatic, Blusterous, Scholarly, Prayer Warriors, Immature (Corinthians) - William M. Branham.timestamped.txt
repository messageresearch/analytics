[0:01] in my father's house is many kinds of
[0:05] mansions I don't believe that when we
[0:07] get to heaven that we will be just
[0:10] everybody look just exactly alike I
[0:12] don't believe it at all will be uh
[0:15] blondes or brunetts or or little or or
[0:18] all big or or all Giants I believe that
[0:21] God is a god of
[0:24] variety the world proves that he's got
[0:26] big mountains and little mountains he's
[0:28] got Plains he's got got deserts he's got
[0:31] different things because he made it the
[0:34] way he wanted it and he made the season
[0:37] summer winter spring autumn he made the
[0:40] season that show us he's a god of
[0:42] variety he made you in a variety some
[0:46] man are real blusterous and some are
[0:48] real dogmatic and others are fine others
[0:51] are kind and you just find all different
[0:53] kinds of people and in his kingdom see
[0:56] look at St Peter and judge him by
[0:59] Andrews see Andrew is that prayer
[1:01] Warrior just stayed on his knees all the
[1:03] time and the Apostle Peter was one of
[1:05] those fire brands that preached and and
[1:07] so forth and Paul was more scholarly
[1:10] like more of the uh like the prophet or
[1:12] something and set back and see Moses
[1:15] wrote the first four books of the Old
[1:17] which he wrote the Old Testament the
[1:19] rest of it was the laws and kings and
[1:21] Psalms and so forth and what someone
[1:23] wrote of the prophets but Moses wrote
[1:25] the laws the first four books of the
[1:27] Bible Genesis Exodus IUS of Deuteronomy
[1:31] and then Paul wrote the New Testament
[1:34] that's true Matthew Mark Luke and John
[1:36] wrote the acts of what taken place and
[1:38] so forth but Paul separated law and
[1:41] Grace and put it into its place see he
[1:44] was the writer of the New Testament he
[1:47] gave us the writings of the New
[1:50] Testament set in the word of God and
[1:52] order now notice many many mansions many
[1:56] kinds of mansions like many kinds of
[1:59] Hills like many kinds of rivers Springs
[2:01] Lakes they were here when you come here
[2:05] first because the kindness of your
[2:07] heavenly father place them here because
[2:11] some man likes mountains some people
[2:14] likes Waters some likes deserts so you
[2:17] see your coming he knew your nature and
[2:20] what you would be so he made it just the
[2:22] way that you could enjoy it oh I think
[2:25] that's a wonderful father see uh though
[2:28] that he made it like this I'm glad he
[2:31] made mountains I I like the mountains
[2:33] and I I I like that where the other so I
[2:36] can't stand all they must have empted
[2:38] his mortar box out there well he Ed out
[2:40] so I could enjoy it you see so then I
[2:43] like the PLS where I see a long ways
[2:45] well the two different Natures both of
[2:46] us Christians but the father knew that
[2:49] you would be here and prepared
[2:52] everything for you before you got here
[2:55] amen your first coming here he had it
[2:58] ready for you when he got here isn't
[3:00] that marvelous to think of what he done
[3:03] now now but remember these are only
[3:06] temporal gifts in pipe now we know that
[3:10] Moses in right building the Tabernacle
[3:12] in the wilderness or preparing it he
[3:14] said he made all things after the order
[3:18] of what he saw in heaven see so the
[3:20] Earthly things only express what the
[3:24] Eternal things are am and if this Earth
[3:26] that we live in today being so great as
[3:28] we love it love to live and breathe the
[3:31] air and see the flowers and things if if
[3:34] that if this year is the expression one
[3:38] that's dying is only expressing one
[3:41] that's Eternal when you see a tree
[3:44] struggling pulling trying to live that
[3:46] means there's a tree somewhere that
[3:48] doesn't have to do that when you see a
[3:50] man you're struggling to live somebody
[3:53] in a hospital or on a sick bed or in an
[3:56] accident struggling and the death
[3:58] rattles in their throat and pull in and
[4:00] crying and screaming for Life what does
[4:02] that mean there's a place somewhere
[4:04] there's a body that doesn't struggle and
[4:06] scream for that see it just doesn't do
[4:09] it now there are temporal gifts to us
[4:12] these things only expressing that there
[4:15] is one where it's the Eternal one that's
[4:18] what Jesus has gone away to prepare the
[4:20] Eternal one for us now they only express
[4:24] there's a greater of the same kind
[4:27] because these are a same kind
[4:31] Paul didn't have any trouble with the
[4:33] church of
[4:35] Ephesus they were
[4:38] schols they were men who
[4:42] understood but his trouble wasn't with
[4:44] the Roman
[4:46] Church and he exalts them before God and
[4:50] talks of their
[4:52] faith but the trouble he had was with
[4:57] k k was the place that that he had the
[5:00] trouble for they could not take the word
[5:04] each one wanted a
[5:06] sensation said why is it when I come
[5:08] among you one's got a tongue and one's
[5:11] got a Psalm and one's got a this and got
[5:13] a
[5:13] that some kind of a little foolish
[5:17] sensation he said you're Believers but
[5:20] you're not
[5:22] established now you know Paul wouldn't
[5:25] have preached things to the Corinthian
[5:28] Church and come back and preach the
[5:30] Ephesian Church something else and the
[5:32] Church of Thessalonians something else
[5:35] he preached the same gospel
[5:39] everywhere but that Ephesian church he
[5:44] could speak to them some of the great
[5:45] Mysteries that God had revealed to him
[5:47] down in
[5:49] Arabia he could preach predestination to
[5:52] him he could preach that to Corinthian
[5:54] Church well they still had they didn't
[5:57] have a on out their hands or some kind
[5:58] of sensation or something other they
[6:00] wouldn't believe what the word said they
[6:02] had to have a tongue or Psalm or some
[6:04] kind of little signs or something but
[6:07] Paul couldn't preach solid Doctrine to
[6:09] them I said this brother sister this may
[6:13] be the last sermon I ever
[6:15] preach but I'll be free of all man's
[6:18] blood listen
[6:21] brother Paul could not preached to them
[6:24] I said I found two things in my life I
[6:27] found the Fundamentalist Baptist
[6:31] Presbyterian I found the
[6:34] Pentecostal being a Baptist myself was
[6:37] already in the Baptist Church I turned
[6:39] them down to come be with
[6:41] you I love
[6:43] you and I've seen the ER of some of your
[6:46] some of your doings but I come with you
[6:49] so I could bring you
[6:52] back I went with you not because I'm
[6:55] turned out of a Baptist
[6:57] Church no sir find out if that's right
[7:00] or on I was not turned down the Baptist
[7:03] Church I chose to come with the
[7:05] Pentecostals cuz I love you and I come
[7:09] with you so I could try for the Bible to
[7:12] shake you from your aor and bring you
[7:14] back to a solid Faith God's unlovable
[7:18] word and The Hours come one of the
[7:21] American Pentecost is either on some
[7:23] kind of fantastic or ISM are so cold and
[7:25] starchy you can't touch them at all
[7:28] that's a you CL
[7:30] hardly in the middle of the road
[7:32] anymore and I
[7:35] notice I find that the Baptist people
[7:38] positionally and the Lutheran
[7:41] Presbyterian they are Bible scholars
[7:44] they positionally know where they
[7:48] stand but they got the word without the
[7:52] spirit they haven't got any faith with
[7:54] that word they got and new Pentecostals
[7:58] has got the faith
[8:00] but you don't know where you're
[8:01] standing if you know the Bible you
[8:04] wouldn't be so wishy-washy to fall for
[8:07] [Applause]
[8:10] everything you know that's
[8:13] true now if we could only get
[8:15] Pentecostal faith in Baptist theology or
[8:20] Baptist Theology and Pentecostal Faith
[8:22] would have
[8:23] it it's just like a man's got money in a
[8:26] bank and he don't know how to write a
[8:28] check and y's got ain't got no money to
[8:31] bank and he knows how to write a
[8:32] check that's just as
[8:35] foolish if we could only get the man
[8:38] that's got the money in the bank knows
[8:40] where he's standing by the word it would
[8:42] be settle we could draw dividends off of
[8:46] the glory of God by the death of Christ
[8:49] where signs wonders of the Bible would
[8:51] follow and we wouldn't need any of these
[8:54] kind of silly
[8:56] things you know that's the truth what's
[8:59] the use of accepting a counterfeit that
[9:01] the Devil Hand you when the skies and
[9:04] Heavens are full of blessings trying to
[9:05] give to
[9:07] you why would I eat out of a garbage can
[9:09] when I can eat at a nice
[9:11] table certainly and I laid that a whole
[9:15] lot on the
[9:16] preachers that's right they R old
[9:19] garbage can out somewhere and they every
[9:20] want to get like a bunch of cockroaches
[9:22] in the
[9:23] summertime that's right I don't say that
[9:26] for jokes this is not a joking place
[9:28] this this is where the word of God's
[9:30] going forth listen brother if you want
[9:32] to make roaches scatter just turn the
[9:34] light on one time why is it there bugs
[9:37] of
[9:38] Darkness it takes the light of the
[9:41] Gospel to show up things exactly right
[9:45] the light of the Gospel you believe in
[9:47] SS and wonders brother benam absolutely
[9:49] but it's got to be Bible SS and wonders
[9:52] because the devil's got a counterfeit in
[9:54] the last days to to see the People by
[9:57] and I'm on the lookout for it
[10:01] right I'm warning
[10:03] you stay
[10:06] clear the Corinthians they just could
[10:09] believe anything but they didn't believe
[10:12] the right thing but now look do you
[10:15] believe the Ephesian Church spoke in
[10:16] tongues certainly do you believe they
[10:18] had signs and wonders yes sir but they
[10:21] know how to play them they their pastors
[10:24] know how to S them and put the church in
[10:26] order but the Corinthians didn't each
[10:29] one had to do this and do that and do
[10:30] this and do that they had the gifts Paul
[10:33] said uh you got great gifts I'm thankful
[10:36] for them but they didn't know how to use
[10:38] them that's the way it is in the church
[10:41] today and it's one long enough till the
[10:43] devil's begin to slip in and give you
[10:44] some false signs and
[10:46] wonders could you imagine brother we
[10:49] need the Bible an oldfashioned St Paul's
[10:53] Revival and the Bible Holy Ghost the
[10:56] real true spirit of
[10:58] God
