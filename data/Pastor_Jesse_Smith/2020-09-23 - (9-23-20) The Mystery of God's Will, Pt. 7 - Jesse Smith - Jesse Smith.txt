up our bibles here first corinthians 12 let's continue on this will of god series we'll look at part seven here tonight i still want to do that uh kind of go over the debate uh just gotta get more time to kind of look at it been a busy week you know things at school are really getting busy and then the kids are coming back on monday so it's really busy there but god is simple and there's always enough time to worship the lord praise god there's always enough time to meditate on jesus praise the lord so first corinthians 12 we'll look at the gifts and the lord willing we'll get into some of the rewards and consequences of the mystery of god's will paul said the mystery of god's will is made known to the saints praise god we know it's to get saved and to get filled with the holy ghost that's just a general way to say it god's will is holiness for without holiness no man shall see the lord how do you get holy get saved get sanctified get baptized and then get filled with the holy ghost praise god first corinthians 12. by god's grace i think i'll read uh why don't i read four five six and seven and then as a church we'll read eight nine and ten because those are the scriptures about the gifts of the holy spirit so let me read four five six and seven now there are diversities of gifts but the same spirit there are differences of administrations but the same lord and there are diversities of operations but is the same god which worketh all in all but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all so everyone has at least one gift of the holy spirit and as we know like jesus is parable if someone's not faithful with their talent that may be given to someone else the man talked about the the woman uh uh preacher of course i don't know how she got that one but then it went over to her husband uh i think we've seen in our church you know god's gift on piano transfer over to malachi i think we've seen that in our church just one simple example was on our previous piano player and now has kind of come over uh to malachi so we're thankful for that by god's grace not that our previous piano player locks any gift but we needed a gift and god supplied a gift praise god so we thank the lord for that so verse eight let's read eight nine and ten together i know it's a little bit of reading but let's try that we got it on the screen if you need it let's read that on three one two three four to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge by the same spirit to another faith by the same spirit to another the gifts of healing by the same spirit to another the working of miracles to another prophecy to another discerning of spirits to another diverse kinds of tongues to another the interpretation of tongues and i'll read verse 11 but all these worketh that one and the self-same spirit dividing to every man severally as he will praise god aren't you glad god's a god of variety he doesn't have everybody just operate the same way with healing or the same way with wisdom or knowledge or prophecy they can be different and there's beauty in variety let's have one more word of prayer if you ever need on your heart let's make it known unto god here tonight heavenly father lord i lift my hands to you i'm in need of you lord i have needs in my life lord and uh i have needs that i want to meet for the church lord god i want to i want you to meet their needs and we know the way to do it is through the preaching of the word so father i pray your people lord would pull on your word tonight lord and physically bless those who press their way out to the house of god bless those live streaming lord god those that will hear it on archive the father may our hearts and as paul said in philippians may we have one mind lord god may we be uh same minded lord everything lord god servant to one another a real body of christ a real church that cares about one another's needs lord god that we can do it selflessly by charity lord that nothing would be done selfishly the lord done by the holy spirit for lord what good is it to move a mountain if we don't have charity lord god so help us to have charity to follow uh the holy spirit charity and desire spiritual gifts bless us now in your divine presence in jesus christ's name and the saint said amen praise god god bless you as being seated praise the lord so let me uh just briefly real quick i just want to just look at the highlights of this chapter so far i took a little bit of time off and we had sunday off we really enjoyed the time with brother keith and i really enjoy his gift i know he's an older man and i i just love it because he's so different from everybody else talk about variety that's a good a good example and i love how he's he was telling me out there by the cars like brother jesse said everything i told is exactly the truth he said i've been through all those things and he said i need to tell him and i i want to tell him and i said i said my children really love your stories brother and they really blessed my heart too they really encouraged me i think of that man if he's 73 and he can still be out there preaching and he's you can tell each time he comes he gets a little slower you know walking around it's a little harder you ever see that it's kind of hard to them for take that step up here but he's still precious he's still pressing the battles right he ain't giving up he ain't quitting he knows god has him here for a purpose and he's fulfilling his purpose he told me out there he said i'd probably die if i stop preaching because you you lose your purpose right you you lose uh your focus and uh your purpose your vision in life and i think that's a great testimony so i want to keep having him back uh we're so blessed and my so many people came up for prayer so i thank the lord for that and i'm sure god answered uh some of those prayers i hope he did one of the prayers from one of the saints was that they would know their gifts i thought that was a great as a fitting request for our little series we've been on with the will of god because as we know it's god's will he he entrusted you with some valuable uh gold or silver now i imagine it's gold right because gold is deity the baptism of the holy ghost is deity god's spirit in you part of that is a gift of god right or gifts of the holy spirit so god has imparted deity in our lives and we want to be faithful with them and that's my prayer that god would help us all to be faithful with all of our gifts the bible said he has made known ephesians 1 9 he's made known to us the mystery of his will and it's a holy calling so the way you get holy is to get saved justified declared righteous right so there it is holy calling and the bible said god would that every man be saved and then the bible said let everyone who wants the holy ghost and everyone who wants to be even more holy the high calling come to me i'll give him the waters of life amen and so we saw god's will though means choice desire or pleasure and god first puts a desire in everybody's heart and uh he reaches out to them and he he he commands and uh he he he he desires right he requires everyone to reach out to him and respond to his love praise god and so we know god has a sovereign will it's going to be done unconditional but then we know uh god makes his known will to man through the word of god and through visions and dreams and then he has a progressive will that we must search out and i'm searching out for that tonight praise god i know brother cam i haven't heard update but i know he's searching up the next step for his life and i'm sure you are too you just want to know what god wants you to do god controls the nations he raises them up pulls them down and then he makes his will known to us praise god and then uh he wants everyone to be saved he invites everyone to be saved and filled with the holy spirit god makes known uh his will through our daily spiritual bible reading you know i read a good scripture today why don't i pull it up real quick uh first kings nine i don't know the verse but if you just pull that up i was just really in shocked when i read this first kings nine was my chapter this morning and the scripture says that they it says again that israel uh this is uh solomon's prayer the second time that god appeared to solomon let me see if i can find it uh it says again yeah now verse 20 and 21 and all the people that were left of the amorites hittites para perazzites hivites and jebusites which were not of the children of israel their children that were left after them in the land whom the children of israel also were not able utterly to destroy upon those did solomon levy a tribute of bond service unto this day now how does that relate i just want to say it like this uh remember when god told joshua to take the land remember he said drive out all of them how many remember that you drive out the perizzites the amorites uh the canaanites he said drive them all out now let me look up the year on that real quick because that just kind of came to my mind so joshua one that just take a about 10 seconds here hopefully i can find it quickly what year was that so joshua 1 is about wow 1451 bc and now solomon is praying here in 992 bc so almost 500 years later 500 years later god tells solomon you know you've got to put these other nations on tribute because they didn't drive them out now church if you know joshua 1 god said every place you put the soul of your foot shall be your possession let me know what i'm talking about and he said the coast he said from the coast from the river jordan all the way to the uh the red sea and that was thus saith the lord so what am i trying to say i'm trying to say god's will sometimes is conditional god said if you can just possess the land if you can take the land and overcome by obeying he said you have the potential to do this amen and church we have great potentials in this day praise god joshua had great potentials but they didn't reach them all joshua was faithful but the the rest of the people they didn't reach uh the the borders or coast they were supposed to because many times god's will god has to give you your own choice god can't force you to do something how many could say amen to that god couldn't force israel to drive out all the amrites it's up to them and there's many so many promises right there's so many promises like repent and be baptized and you shall receive the holy ghost how many people have we seen walk up to that promise but then walk away the bible says if you just really repent and and if you just really believe this word you will receive the holy ghost and the promise is there the promise is there to possess the land amen but the people people shy away from it they're they're they're too fearful to do it they get comfortable in their daily lives my prayers lord don't let me be comfortable let me be a conqueror let me drive out all the amorites the parasites the canaanites the hittites the gergescites god help me praise god to drive out all the inhabitants of the land that i can be a real overcomer and i can possess all that god calls me to possess praise god amen my 500 years later church look at that i'm going to mark that off in my bible real quick here i'll probably reference that again that was 500 years before god gave a conditional promise and that was his will that was his perfect will if you want to do god's perfect will he told joshua's generation drive everybody out don't leave any left right don't leave any left but 500 years look they look at that church 500 years later they had compromised they were okay god's people were okay with compromising with sin is that the testimony the bride of jesus christ is gonna have i don't think so praise god i don't think her testimony is well it's okay if we smoke and drink a little bit or watch you know a little bit of netflix here and there or you know listen to a little bit of rock and roll or rapid i don't think that's going to be the testimony of the true bride of christ praise god i think the true bride of christ is going to be living by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of god glory and so i just thought i'd bring that back up because that's a great scripture i read it this morning it applies perfectly the will of god many times it's conditional god's not going to force us like brother ram said god wants to see what you're going to do about it praise god god wants to see what you and your freemore agency will surrender to him so again just like it joshua just like god bringing israel out and joshua leading them in so is the statue of a perfect man you got to grow up into the things of god you've got to progress in the things of god you got to get closer and closer to god just like they got closer and closer to the possession you and i must grow up into christ and get closer and closer in the possession and church that just that just applies to joshua as well once they're in the land they still got to drive people out and once we get the holy ghost we still got to drive habits out right we still got to drive troubles out and and temptations out we still have a battle to fight praise god thank the lord remember we have two principles that govern the will of god uh it'll be perfectly with his known will in the bible but it must happen in his time in season we saw that a while back in part three it's always with the word and always in the right season and then along with that there's always service involved submission and suffering in the will of god all of those accompany god's perfect will and how do you find it romans 12 says you find it by bringing your body and making it a living sacrifice praise god unto god you have to set aside your body that means everything you you eat right everything you think every everywhere you go uh everything you put in front of your eyes everything every all the clothes you put on everything about your body has to be a living sacrifice unto god and then with that you'll be dedicated to the word and your mind will be transformed by the renewing of your mind by the word of god praise god that's how you find the perfect will of god very simple just consecrate dedicate your entire life to god i know it's a hard thing to do in this hour but of course it doesn't really matter what we got to overcome as long as we know how to overcome and that's by the word amen now we saw you need to fight we we need to find i need to find god's perfect will for my relationships vocations locations ministries and gifts uh i got some good feedback on those i'm glad that people enjoyed those but let's finish up here let's just review the gifts real quick uh the wisdom is is advice that's very timely and you know it was a word of wisdom when it the what you desire comes to pass and you can see the blessings from that decision afterwards it was the right time it was the right thing to do the word of knowledge unlocks something for you it opens a door for you it gives you information from the bible and helps you to enter into a promise praise god and then we we looked last time at faith faith is a substance that is god's desire and power to move problems or sicknesses or adversaries like mountains just by speaking god's word amen that's the gift of faith praise the lord now let's look at tonight so this is new in review uh let's look at gifts of healing now healing is deliverance from the oppression of the devil of both the mind and the body because it's mental torment that often causes physical ailments right many times people have physical pain because of their mental pain or their spiritual pain right things they have allowed to torment them and that it affects their lives like a lot of doctors will tell you my doctors even told me stress will cause heart trouble just mental stress right just worrying about this and worrying about that just letting stress get to you will cause heart trouble so spiritual oppression causes physical oppression right you just gotta let the weight just gotta like the bible said just let off the pressure praise god just cast your cares upon the lord for he cares for you praise god amen that's what the house of god does that's what worshiping does that's what praising god does amen it just lets off the pressure get your mind off those things that it casts all those things aside and you come into the presence of the king of kings and lord of lords praise god mental torment will often cause physical torment and there's many gifts of healing such as laying on of hands speaking the word natural remedies lately we've heard like brother amen's uh father and stepmother uh they went to a brother who has a gift of healing uh to pray touch their foreheads and they pass out remember that we told the story a couple months ago that they just have that prayer the anointing gets so strong on them they can just lay hands on and people fall over i've done that a few times as far as praying for people and they've fallen over just under the anointing of the holy spirit but that's a different kind of gift right there's many kinds of gifts so divine healing isn't spontaneous and that differentiates it from miracles now remember king saul had mental torment he was so jealous of david uh and he was so jealous he couldn't get that picture of his mind of all the women playing tambourines and saying saul's killed his thousands and david is ten thousands he was such a jealous person right he couldn't get over his jealousy oh how could the women sing for david when i'm the king instead of being happy that they're they weren't slave to philistines he got jealous over the man that had faith to overcome if he was so concerned why didn't he rise up in faith because he was a slave to fear right so instead of being happy that somebody got a victory he got frustrated about it right and he got angry about it he got a a murderous spirit about it instead of being happy for the victory of god oh church i hope no matter what age no matter what gender when someone gets a victory our i hope our church will just rally around it and praise god for it amen no matter if it's older like brother keith or younger uh or even younger than me you know children it don't matter to me uh we we want to see devils driven out we want to see goliath removed amen we want to see the canaanites driven out we want to see the amorites driven out we want to see god's people in liberty and victory praise god amen not be jealous of other people now with preachers it's you know the thing with preachers that i found too is that uh any new preacher comes in i've got to battle the devil because it seems like everybody pays better attention you know or they they seem to be happier when the new preacher comes and so that's one thing i've noticed that i've gotta be very careful and that that's and that's why church i'm one of the loudest ones saying amen right like when that's why i'll sit on the edge of my seat physically on purpose so that i'm not looking at the man i'm looking past the man and looking at the god preaching through the man and i want to support that man and that gift of god in his life so i purposely have to train my mind and body to do that uh to get the victory praise god just because we all battle something so saul was able uh to get under the anointing that david was playing on the piano right i'm sorry not piano on the uh the string instruments the harp and liar and worship and then those evil spirits delivered him from his mental trouble how many ever been delivered from stress be because of music just listening to the right music just putting on the worship of god in the home or in your car and you can start worshiping i don't know how many times have i driven to work and uh i'll just be all worried about work or something frustrated about all the work or load or and some i'll just put on a song and it just seems like all that pressure goes away and i can i can smile again and i can just be happy and i can walk into work feeling good about it praise god because the spirit of god uh delights in worship it doesn't delight in worry frustration or jealousy like saul let uh come upon him he let he invited those demons upon him and so it tormented him that was first samuel 16 where david so music is a gift of healing and notice church is not usually the first song right it takes a couple songs right because if if it was instant that'd be a miracle but it's you know as even with when i gave my heart to lord you know kim's cam's car i borrowed his car unless it was christian music it wasn't the first song that gave my heart to the lord it was it was numerous songs over months and months and months and then i probably started listening to that in september of 1999 and then i gave my heart to lord beginning of the year 2000. you know so it wasn't something that was instant but it took time and uh we got to give god time praise god that's a gift of healing so malachi lydia and amen and kesha was singing and haven was singing all the ones that we're starting to see and gifts naomi sing in different ones my wife singing song specials and jose and whenever whenever god leads you to sing uh it's for the people it's to help the people to be healed praise god and to worship god amen is to clear the minds of any clutter right it's a to clear the minds and clean out the holy spirit i'm sorry clean out the evil spirits by the holy spirit in our minds to open the doors uh to all of our thought lives right every area of our thoughts to open the conscience memory reason affection imagination the songs are supposed to open those doors right and clean out whatever's wrong in there in order that the christ might live in our minds we might in other words we might uh we might uh just hold captive the word of god right we might we would just uh hold the word of god in our thoughts praise god couldn't think of the exact word i was thinking of now this is a new one i don't think i've ever read this one uh let's go to ezekiel 47 12. this might be brand new this is where my wife has been a blessing god many times use leaves and plants as medicine and figs were used to heal boils at times in the bible so ezekiel 47 12 we got three scriptures on this where you can see god used plants and natural things herbal remedies i think and by the river upon the bank thereof on the side and that side shall grow all trees for meat whose leaf shall not fade neither shall the fruit thereof be consumed it shall bring forth new fruit according to its months because they're waters they issued out of the sanctuary and the fruits thereof shall be for me and the leaf thereof for medicine okay uh go to second kings 20 verse seven second kings 20 verse 7. i'm right there and isaiah said take a lump of figs and they took and laid it on the boil and he recovered why didn't he just say speak the word brother why did he just say that because god has a different variety praise god god wants to use that for his glory amen uh let's go to isaiah 38 21. isaiah 38 21 many times god will use something natural right in order to bring about a healing for isaiah had said let them take a lump of figs and lay it for a plaster paster on the boil and he shall recover and the church said just but it's got to be led of the lord right it's got to be led to the lord when the lord leads it right uh you apply the figs or the leaves and uh what the scripture says and it brings healing i believe moses right came to the waters of mara if i'm not mistaken and then he three throw a rod in there i can't remember that story right now but the bitter turn to sweet waters i forget what he cast into the water but there's something natural right bitter waters and he casts something in and they become sweet they become good waters and god used that water to give his children a drink praise god so see god does these gifts of healing there's many varieties of it so those are good to read i think that's the first time i've ever read those in a live service but that is a gift of healing so someone has the ability to know about herbs and leaves and figs and they can put a salve together and it can be used for the glory of god to bring about healing all right now jesus christ now promises to heal the sick when we lay hands on them in mark 16 verses 17 and 18. of course we've seen that many times lay hands on the sick and they shall recover praise god i forget who was telling me there i can't remember the testimony but they literally felt uh might have been amen yeah it might have been amen and who the last time amen was sick he woke up in the middle of the night sick and sister hua laid uh her hand on brother amen and she said her hand got numb and she said she felt the power of god flowing in the brother amen and amen was healed that's a good testimony praise god i said i said that's something to be rejoicing about praise god there's uh divine healing he said lay hands on the sick and they shall recover paul prayed and then laid his hands on publius's father and he was healed of fever and a bloody flux and his intestinal infection all he did was praise and speak loud and lay his hands and his intestines healed amen how many believe god is almighty praise god just by placing a hand on someone's shoulder or forehead or joining hands the power of god can flow out of that person it's called healing virtues amen hallelujah virtue float out of jesus amen and just by laying on someone's hand on their shoulder it can the power of god can flow down into their stomach and heal their stomach praise god that's our god amen the great healer the giver of every good and perfect gift and i forgot to review it but i'll get to get there in just a minute you know i've seen two women on two separate occasions uh i prayed for them they either had arm weakness or arm paralysis um and i prayed i forget the sister's name we used to come here we prayed for her arm tanya thank you so hers was an instant she went home when we prayed and used the keys of the kingdom she went home that night and while cooking supper uh she said she felt her arm get healed and she raised her hand and she said she couldn't use it at work that friday she couldn't use her work because it was kind of weak or paralyzed but then when we prayed for her she went home cooking dinner and the power came back praise god so we thank the lord for that one time i was preaching in pennsylvania i think i told this story i was preaching on our face seeking god's face and i'd preach on how uh we see god's face which means his presence in fact uh the shoe bread actually means the bread of his presence which is awesome you start eating on the word of god and if you come into god's presence you come into his face praise god amen that's what we should be doing tonight praise god amen feasting on god's word and we feel closer to god that's the bread of his presence but anyways i preach it on the christian's face seeking god's face and then i preach how the sinners turn their face from god i was preaching on even jezebel and how she painted her face and how god doesn't want pain on our faces uh he wants the glory of god on our faces like moses had the glory of god and sister beatrice this old woman was sitting in the back with her husband she had pants on and makeup and short hair and she said she felt she told the pastor afterwards she said she felt somebody tap her shoulder and she thought it was her husband and she she couldn't raise her arm she had armed paralysis she felt something tap her shoulder and she raised her shoulder and she was completely healed brother jim invited her back but they never come back to church and she had pain on her face now you tell me that's god's mercy to someone that god would deliver the word and give them a vindication of healing they didn't even come up for prayer it was while the word was being preached amen now that might be a miracle actually because it was instant so i think i've got to change that one in the book uh if it happened instantly that's a miracle and i never got a chance to shake her hand brother jim just testified about it afterwards uh when i was sick one time with throat sickness brother samson shedding prayed for me i couldn't sing during the song service but after church i was singing as loud as i ever did uh and i felt healed i felt god heal my throat and then i told the testimony of my wife having migraines and i was preaching on healing and she the thought came to my wife's mind that i'm a daughter of god i eat the children's bread i don't get the crumbs i eat the children's bread and my wife said through a healthier lifestyle and through faith she's not suffered with migraine sins by god's grace now let me go back to what i want to review remember this church that in ephesians 4 12 there's five purposes of the five-fold ministry to perfect the saints that's equip the saints so give them equipment and church what other equipment can i give you than the word of god i can buy you books i could buy you all kinds of nice trinkets right i give the kids changes for easter or something i gave them the trinkets last year with easter but that's not the gifts we're trying to equip with we're trying to equip with knowledge of the gifts of the word of god right understanding we're trying to equip the saints with knowledge and understanding of the gifts in their life so they can operate them properly glory so perfecting of the saints that's the equipping of the saints the work of the ministry to undertake the ministry so preachers are supposed to help us understand how to undertake a ministry how do i how do i continue a ministry that's what the preaching of the word is supposed to do and that's what we've been preaching on right purpose over the last few years find your purpose and then dedicate your body uh present your body a living sacrifice unto god so if you've got a gift of healing if you've got a gift of knowledge we should set aside time to pray about that right that's for the work of the ministry to undertake the ministry so we're equipped by the knowledge of god to know what the gifts are and then we're we're supposed to undertake we're supposed to recognize mine i have a ministry i need to be faithful with that and if and i know i know the bride of jesus christ is gonna they're gonna believe that quote brother branham said that every person is just as important as the preacher tonight tonight church every person person is just as important as the preacher because everybody has a part in the service so preaching is to equip us show us the equipment right tell us about the equipment tell us how to use it undertake the ministry find a ministry and be devoted to the ministry and stay with the ministry and to edify the body of christ promote growth this is how you grow in the word of god this is how you grow in your in your mind battles right this is how you grow uh into faith and and become a better christian this is how you live a more sanctified life help the saints grow promote growth in their lives this is how you go from faith to virtue and knowledge and and temperance and patience and godliness and brotherly kindness you stay in the word you daily read your bible you daily pray and you daily obey praise god amen peter said god gives the holy ghost to them that obey him praise god jesus said the father will give you the holy ghost if you ask praise god and jesus said if you abide in me and my words he said then ask what you will and it shall be done praise god but you got to abide like a wheat plant you got to abide in the word that means every day the plant stays in position the plant stays uh uh gathering in the nutrients and minus minerals we stay in the word we stay feasting on the things of god and we grow up into god the fourth thing it does is it makes us agree on faith agreement of faith the unity of the faith agree on beliefs and i think with uh i think with numerous people now this is just my observation i think with numerous people it's just trying to help them to believe which gifts they have right what gifts do i have what do i see working repeatedly in my life what have i seen once working in my life what do i see working over and over and help them believe right to be unified that we believe this gift lays in our lives it's god's will for me to do this this is the work of the preaching of the fivefold ministry and lastly the unity to be welcome in the unity of the knowledge of the son of god that's precise truth that's why i think it's so important to know precisely what is the gift of faith what is the gift of healing what is the gift of wisdom and knowledge if the when you stay in the in the mind of the holy spirit he directs you to precise truth right we're all we're all kind of guessing at certain things for a while but but if we stay in tune with the holy spirit we should precisely know what god has called us to do all right so i just want to review that and let me uh read this one too i got another one i wanted to read here i don't know if you remember this from the church age book paul irenaeus ephesus smyrna the submergent church age with uh the messenger iranians he was militant against any form of organization also his life history where he served the lord was one of much manifestation in the holy spirit and the word was taught with unusual clarity and conformity to its original precepts his churches in france were known to have the gifts of the spirit among them for the saints spoken tongues prophesied raised the dead and healed the sick by the prayer of faith he saw the danger of any kind of organizat organized brotherhood among the elders pastors etc he stood solely for a unified spirit-filled gift manifesting local church and god honored him for the power of god manifested among the saints amen hallelujah praise god church that's what i believe our church can have we can have unusual clarity how do you know because sister beecher if i've had numerous people in the last two weeks contact me about the clarity that i taught the message in that debate they were blown away they're like wow i never heard the message explained like that that's exactly the way i believe it church i believe here we have a special thing i believe cam church brother brooks is church these churches have a special thing we have unusual clarity of the word of god we just we just got to continue to surrender ourselves put ourselves on the altar of god which is our reasonable service right and ask god to help us to grow up and grow into the understanding of our gifts that we can come to church expecting god to do something supernatural praise god hallelujah we have we have unusual clarity with this message praise god i've had numerous people contact me about that on youtube and email and uh facebook messenger people that are they're they're uh i got a i got a voicemail where the brother said that was outstanding or he said spontaneous i forget what he said he was just blown away by and that's just that's not to exalt me or anything it's not because there's nothing good in me without jesus we can do nothing but if we're staying close to jesus we should have unusual clarity of the word of god the word should make sense amen the message should be the apostolic faith restored praise god i never set my timer so let me do that now i just looked up at the clock for the first time my iranians he taught the people so clearly what the gifts of the spirit are and that's why this chapter i believe will be so important to you and i if we can really focus on what the word of god says and honestly look at our lives and see what gifts have manifested in our lives so like i said for my life i've really wanted to speak in tongues but i never have i've asked god to let me speak in tongues i felt like i could but i just i didn't want to make it up everybody i've talked to said you don't you don't have to make it up it just flows out of you everybody i've talked to that speaks in tongues so i never i just never tried to do it but i've seen gifts of gifts of faith right that's in my testimony i've seen wisdom people have told me that did i have any knowledge no i didn't have any knowledge oh but i oh yeah but i've given people scriptures they got delivered from cigarettes and they got delivered from video games and i preached different things where people got delivered so i believe that would be a word of knowledge uh i've seen people healed in my ministry i've seen miracles now some of these are more than others right repeated things over and over uh from time to time they happen and maybe we'll do that on sunday if i pre if i'm preaching what what because i mean we might have a guest minister there's a brother brother randy's in town at cams and he might swing by we'll see god bless you nature god bless you so he might he he's got you know he's got a certain schedule he's got to keep so i don't know if he's coming by or not we haven't uh finalized plans but maybe on sunday we lord willing if i preach we could take some time to look at gifts and just look at our lives and you know spend some time praying about that because irenaeus was known as a supernatural church and we want to be known as a church that has a supernatural praise god how many can say amen on that we want to be known as a church that has a supernatural among us just like iranians as church but it's going to take putting ourselves on the altar right and then letting the word of god transform our minds it's a spirit-filled unified gift manifesting local church look at that what a phrase amen lee vale must have put that one together of course he got off as he went later on in life that's one of those things those guys tried to debate me on what about lee vale what about gene and leo they were actually turned into child molesters and homosexuals i said well that doesn't just because there's one bad person or a couple bad people around your ministry doesn't mean the ministry's bad if that's the case then judas what about judas and jesus right that's why i told him on the debate i said you we've all seen that meme i already seen that meme where judas had the best pastor there was and he still deserted the gospel i mean you can have the best pastor in the world but it's up to you many of the promises are conditional god's not going to force you you've got to desire it praise god you've got to love god's word more than the things of this present world amen and so who knows maybe sounds like lee vale was living a good life while brother bran was here i don't know what happened afterwards jean and leo maybe they were living a good life while brother man was here i don't know but once for sure after brother bam left yes they had a huge backslide in into some of the most awful things you could ever imagine that doesn't mean uh that they were doing it while brother brown was here we don't know so that's why church we earnestly contend for the faith and that's why church we have to wait for the holy spirit to give us an answer we don't know what people are going to say we must just be humble in the present hour not attacking people not trying but just in love say god give me something that will help them because love you can't help somebody unless you love them and numerous people tell me that that they of all the people they could feel the love of god in my life so that's all glory to god that's not it's all god's glory so see church we want to be a gift manifesting church and have unusual clarity wow the word is so clear about the gift of faith it's so clear about the gift of healing it's so clear about miracles it's so clear about prophecy and tongues and interpretation word of knowledge and is so clear now i can put it to action in my life that i can see god move through my life that's what we want in our church miracles are instant spontaneous manifestations of healing or other phenomenons performed by faith so see faith and miracles are often closely associated galatians 3 5 says he therefore that ministereth to you the spirit and worketh miracles among you doeth heed it by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith so how do people do miracles they just preach god's word and people hear it and they receive it praise god in other words they just got to come to church knowing i'm going to get something from god today god has revealed to me he's going to do something in my life but they got to be in contact with god at home praise god because paul says among you see among you in the church of galatia how do these people do miracles among you they get anointed with the spirit they say what the spirit wants them to say and the hearers are ready to receive the miracle praise god hallelujah jesus had innumerable number of healing miracles he stopped a woman's bleeding he delivered souls from life-threatening fevers he raised the dead turned water to wine multiplied fish and bread he cast out certain demons by fasting in prayer jesus used peter and john to do a notable miracle causing a lame man to walk and leap in acts chapter 3. special miracles were performed in paul's life using handkerchiefs paul touched to drive out demons from the sick praise god like with brother bang's dad amen glory thank the lord amen the bank said he just remember he just took the tape and he taped that brother prayer cloth to his dad's arm he just taped it there two days later he woke up praise god amen that might be divine healing praise god it wasn't instantaneous divine healing special maybe that's a special divine healing god you're my mom of liver cancer in 1988 instantly i saw a kidney stone healed in guyana arthritis healed in guyana instantaneous things didn't take long instantaneous all right prophecy is the ability to foretell the future and church when you tell someone that when we know the future the bible says it gives edification exhortation and comfort to know the future one thing that i thought was striking was benjamin's grandpa after benjamin's former girlfriend was shot 10 times i went to her hospital room and i thought oh how is she going to make it she was so bloated and uh benjamin called his grandpa's grandfather prayed and he said don't fret she's going to be all right and i honestly had a hard time believing that when i heard that she was on life support coma mom's there weeping and crying i pray with them you know and leave and then two years later i was with benjamin we go over there to see benny and this here's a skinny little girl you know young lady i'm like how in the world is that one the same as the one i saw at the hospital room and you know dressed like a morally i've got to turn the lift the other way you know little children running around there to me that was prophecy she's going to be all right anyone would have thought it's impossible shot 10 times so to me that looks like it's prophetic and what a and you know i remember i was with benjamin he looked like he got comforted by that because prophecy comforts you it's going to be all right it's going to be all right see they can be spontaneously pronounced allowed with thus saith the holy ghost like agabus remember in acts people of acts 21 11 or it can be just through a prophetic dream the dreams can foretell the future like nebuchadnezzar in daniel chapter two that was prophetic right the four uh the four parts of the image the times of the gentiles right the gold head and the uh the silver chest and then the the brass and then the iron that was prophetic but it was over thousands of years three thousand years and when he was come this is agabus he took paul's girdle and bound his own hands and feet and said thus saith the holy ghost so shall the jews at jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle and shall deliver him into the hands of the gentiles now what a statement thus saith the holy ghost praise god so agabus he declares the prophecy it says thus saith the lord and it comes to pass what a supernatural power what a comfort that is praise god what a edification what a building up that is to know that god is foretelling you something that's going to come to pass see church we we just can't hear about it we got to desire it remember the bible said if you are following love if you and i are following the holy ghost we'll desire spiritual gifts pray god you can't you can't separate if if our church is truly born again they'll desire all these love gifts from the heavenly husband praise god these are love gifts to his wife and i've got a zeal i hope you do too i've got a zeal i want to see our church desire more gifts and do something about it pray about it create an atmosphere during the worship create an atmosphere during the preaching of the word because some of these miracles are performed just by hearing the word amen just by hearing the word remember brother brian he prayed for that uh mary ellen used to come here remember mary ellen i don't remember she was a sweet woman but she was i remember she was sitting right there i think it was a third seed over and brian prayed for her she fell and she hurt her tailbone and could hardly walk i remember when she walked in here and she you know stumbled in here and brian hawkins prayed for her she said and the wednesday she come back and testified of it she said as soon as she sat down all the pain left her tailbone that she had for over a week right just by hearing brian preach about jesus christ it might have been the line of judah sermon and the jesus christ the lion of the tribe of judah the ferocious one the power of god and and she had faith heard the word and just a prayer and received it right there praise god amen now i've kind of got back to divine healing or miracles but i was on prophecy see prop when prophecies are pronounced in a public gathering they're to be judged by two or three witnesses pull it up please first corinthians 14 29 now this doesn't happen very much right hardly ever but if we believe it how many believe in restoration if this is the hour if if if restoration is thus saith the lord then one of these generations is going to come to church and they're going to have this happen praise god they're going to have to list they're going to have to be mature enough to have somebody raise up could be a child could be an adult and say thus saith the lord and then after that the people who are judges got to come together and say was that the lord or not so likewise he accept the utter by the tongue words easy to be understood how shall it be known what is spoken for ye shall i'm sorry that wasn't i said the wrong one it's 14 29 i'm sorry honey 29 14 29 talk about maturity now all of you judge the preaching just by your attitude right and sometimes your amens like when the people are amen and i'm like okay that's that was the holy spirit and sometimes i'll preach and you won't amen and you're trying to judge was that the right thing or the wrong thing but you'll hear it with me too i will amen some things some people say you know because i'm not sure if that's god or not you know so we're constantly judging not not uh not worried or anything not living in fear but just trying to write is that the truth or not is that the do i want to believe that and accept that and trust in that or not or is that just somebody's opinion like for example brother keith said it was sin not to vote for donald trump no i don't believe that uh i respect that um i didn't vote for trump the first time and i didn't think i was committing a sin because i didn't trust the man i he's and he and i are good friends and not donald trump keith and i and uh and but that's just his opinion you know i didn't say amen to that we were just chatting about that this time i probably will uh because he's kept his word he's got many promises and he's backed up israel and we've never had a president like that well not at least in my lifetime i don't know what ronald reagan did but you know since that the ones that i've been aware of i haven't seen it now let the prophet speak two or three and let the other judge so we believe the book of acts is going to be restored we have to have some people that are willing to stand up against a brother or sister if they say it wrong and say no that was wrong you have to have enough love for them and enough love for truth that we don't let things slide and take the wrong spirit if we're going to grow into the true church of god but see we got a desire we got to desire someone to prophesy right we have to desire somebody to give us a word of knowledge gotta follow charity and desire these things now for some reason i had first thessalonians 5 19. can you pull it up honey let me turn there real quick i got first corinthians 5 19. uh for some reason that's not oh okay i remember that one now yeah the spy is not prophesized yeah so quench not the spirit now how many message churches are guilty of that in other words people don't clap like they're really they really don't really sing like they're into it they just the same thing happens oh we always got to do three songs and prayer and then two more songs and preaching see people are sometimes we just get in the routine of pharisee-like worship right but we gotta let the holy spirit have his way praise god we gotta just uh just feel free to love god and worship god amen so you've you've heard me a few times i'll say after a preacher i'll say let's just see if the lord will say anything we'll just have a little moment of silence remember that you got a few of those just because i'm i feel the presence of god so strong i just want to see if maybe god will speak something to somebody or maybe somebody could walk over and give somebody a word of wisdom or a word of correction or a discernment right discern a spirit we had a sister from this church i'm not going to say who was but they felt like numerous times that god gave them a word of discernment for someone in the congregation but didn't want to go give it to them because they weren't sure or maybe didn't want to offend them but i encouraged the person i said that'd be good to do that if you feel led of the lord they felt like it and recently we've been talking and some people feel led to speak in tongues that's something we're praying about too i've had two people tell me recently they feel led to speak in tongues and i've tried to tell them pray about it and then if you feel it it's going to come out just be open to it in other words don't quench it don't stop it just let your whole body be taken over by the holy spirit praise god now when i prayed for the sick church this is something i got to pray about too when i pray for the sick the times i've seen healings many times i'm praying really loudly you know i'm not like whispering although god could do that but i just noticed i looked over the past and i have a video of one time where her sister uh sister uh her name was beatrice too mr beatrice from columbus i was praying for her and i was going like this and she got healed her knee her back her nerve trouble uh god healed like three or four things in one prayer that was done in columbus i got the video of it of her just me praying for her and i just noticed and then i think of the times when people got healed in trinidad and guyana i was just really loud so i don't know so i'm almost feeling like i if i'm under the spirit i've got to surrender all my voice all my emotion i've got to just surrender all my body right we don't want to quench the holy spirit we want to let the holy spirit flow and this is a new area right gifts aren't you know we're not prose at gifts right we're not super mature with gifts but we are somewhat mature because we're not getting off on the wrong end either right we're not trying to practice miracles but here malachi pull out your shoe and let me try to you're you're you know you got one leg longer than the other i'll try to push it back in you know just that's what people do charismatic churches or like they told me just say i love you jesus i love you jesus let me pretty soon you'll speak in tongues that's what i tried to do you know we're not so we're mature to some degree but church we got to go higher in christ amen because if you're really following love your desire for god's powers his supernatural powers to flow through your life and the lives of the saints the bride of christ fellowship i just better let me close up here yeah quench not the holy spirit verse 21 despise not prophesying so there was something going on in their church where they just despised when people would foretell events isn't that sad now this should tell us all the opposite so we should hunger for the holy spirit not quench the holy spirit but we should welcome the holy spirit right we should we but we got to act like it we got to come here and act like lord you're welcome here we want to see your power we want to see your glory we want to see you help people heal people give them wisdom and knowledge and and faith and we want us we want to see you new miracles amen and we've got to say lord send us a prophecy send us a word of the lord to go before us verse 21 prove all things hold fast that which is good so i've used this scripture just to prove doctrine but really in context it's proving the prophecies right it's proving that if god did something supernatural here you can prove it by the results it bears right that's that's in context what it's talking about but yes it applies because remember the bereans search the scriptures daily whether these things were so so every day they proved it what paul was saying it was the scripture every day they proved it every day they read their bibles to make sure their their prophet was saying the word of god amen praise god that's right jesus foretold peter's three denials he foretold it against prophesied of a famine and that kind of reminds us of that corona virus prophecy but it was given after the fact right we didn't hear it beforehand the one thing that was spiritual was i told my wife and i were talking and she's a witness of it too we're talking about taking a break from bible club and right after we were talking about taking a break from bible club that's when the i told that i even told the bible club parents that i said we're going to take a break from bible club and then the coronavirus came in and we've had a huge break from it so that that was one thing where i look well that looks pretty spiritual you know i need i need a break i just need time to get in the word i just need time and god sent this huge break uh it looks a little bit phillip had four virgin daughters who prophesied imagine that four people that could prophesy in the church see look and notice it points out their physical consecration because if you operate gifts you got to have spiritual consecration too and they go together right present your body a living sacrifice unto god they go together and brother brooks told about the numerous pastors passing away in 2013 that was a time time stamp prophecy he said he said i'll tell you that in the name of the lord i remember that it was like in january 2013. then we saw lee vale joseph coleman and i think it was lonnie jenkins i think it was numerous brothers uh some of them want good brothers good brothers some of them off the word and then my wife and i i told you have the prophetic dreams where we went to warn individuals of satan's snares and both uh turned it down and both fell into the same thing that we had warned them about and let's stand to our feet i'm gonna stop right there let's stay north because i don't want to go too late if we follow the holy ghost we will desire spiritual gifts that's what i love about how god's been leading me to write this book and now i'm done i'm right now i'm just working on one of the appendix i'm waiting on the sister from alabama to send me her edits i'm waiting for cam dave uh dustin and simon no pressure on them if they're watching no pressure they have church tonight anyway but now i'm just waiting on everybody else send me your edits and uh it's ready to go but that's one thing because this is the first place i've ever seen gifts of the holy spirit clearly taught like what do you say about iranians let me get that again he said uh unusual clarity and conformity to the word of god i hope as i preach on gifts i hope they're becoming more clear to everybody that's my prayer that they're clear and then you can start looking at your life and see wow i see some of that talent here i see some of that talent there and god help me to be faithful with those talents musicians if you'll come i think i want to read that scripture here yep first corinthians 14 1 follow after charity and desire spiritual gifts but rather that you may prophesy so we need to come to church right let's not say the bible we need to come to church desiring all the gifts but especially god give us a prophecy now we've heard so many people prophesy about presidents well you got a 50 50 chance that's not really a hard prophecy right but it would be wouldn't it be so comforting or edifying to know something about the future i'm not even talking about their presidential race i'm just talking about something in the future like what about a prophecy that god was going to save uh my mother and bring her into the messenger you know just think about something like that would that be so uplifting wouldn't that be so powerful that make you excited to come to church i mean you're you're happy to come to church but i'm talking about excited and really zealous to come to church to hear from god that's what and see the message churches i've lost that everybody you talked to brother brooks uh sister karen any beatrice we talked about last week people used to come to church so excited right and there was still a little bit of that when we first came in what i mean by that people really praying they'd pray before service and after service people just get on their knees and pray especially the young people we i remember that they still do it kind of a camp church some of the saints will stick around they'll pray on their knees but that that's what everybody who's been around the message says there was such desire for and then they had more miracles well why is there less because people are not following charity right they're not following the baptism of the holy ghost because they aren't born again but the bible says if you follow the holy ghost charity you'll desire spiritual gifts and more prophecy more prophecy thank the lord and i'll just be honest i don't know how we're going to get there i'm trusting god to get there charis i'll just keep preaching on it wednesday after wednesday sunday after sunday and god's going to do it at some point we don't cover this church in vain right how many times has god answered our prayers helped us bless us we know he's here praise god and we're the ones that got to get in the in order with the word and then we got to wait for the time and season to do it but in the meantime we can be a church of unusual clarity on these supernatural things and we can conform to the apostolic teachings of god's word i long for the day i long for the day when saints come 40 brother man said 45 minutes early hour early and come specifically to pray and see if there's any prophecies tongues interpretations can you imagine that the brotherhood said they'd have to he said when it's done right you write out the prophecies and you bring them before i've said them on the pulpit and they're announced beforehand and judged can you imagine that think about what we had this week right the supreme court justice died and she was one of the most pro-abortion justices ever that god had mercy on your soul but what what if we were to come to church uh that's uh two sundays ago and said thus saith the holy spirit this one of the supreme court justices is gonna die and this one's going to be appointed now what about that and we would have to stand there and judge that say wow i don't i'm not sure not from god or not and you know the president's going to announce it on saturday who he's going to nominate for that can you imagine that though that that's i don't know how that would relate to the church the living god but i'm just giving you a solid example something told beforehand and then it's got to be judged before the church can you imagine being the one to judge that you better be prayed up but then if you make a mistake you better be ready to repent and say lord try me again try me again i judged it wrong i made a mistake maybe i didn't i wasn't in my bible that week or maybe i had some unconfessed sin i had to confess that's why i missed the judgment you imagine coming to church like that would that be glorious that's what my heart longs for i know yours does too let's have a word of prayer follow after the baptism of the holy ghost [Music] see when we really love god that's falling out your heart you really love god's people that you want to come to church and see god [Music] if i'm following charity that means i'm following love that means when i come around the church with god's people i desire god to supernaturally help us that's all that means and then i greatly desire prophecy to know the future so i can be stronger [Music] what's up [Music] so [Music] charity desires to see god [Music] supernaturally [Music] [Applause] tonight thank you for the unusual clarity [Music] supernatural new gifts lord and above all the scriptures prophecy that
