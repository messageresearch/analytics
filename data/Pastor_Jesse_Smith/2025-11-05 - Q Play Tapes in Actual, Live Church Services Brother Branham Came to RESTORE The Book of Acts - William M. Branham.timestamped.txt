[0:03] Brother Brandon, we have no preacher
[0:05] where we live. Brother Brandham, we have
[0:08] no preacher where we live, but we have
[0:13] tape service on Sunday night only.
[0:16] If you don't have a church to go to,
[0:19] should you just listen to the tapes?
[0:22] Yes, that's I' that'd be fine. Now to
[0:26] bring up this faith in Christ, there's
[0:28] ministers. That's the most important
[0:32] thing of the day is a good God-scent
[0:34] preacher.
[0:36] I admire them. And their gift is far
[0:40] beyond anything could be done in
[0:42] anything else is a preacher. A man who
[0:44] knows how to rightly divide the word of
[0:46] God.
[0:48] that he said IN REVELATIONS THE 22ND
[0:50] CHAPTER, WHOSOEVER SHALL TAKE ONE WORD
[0:53] OUT OF THIS book or ADD ONE WORD TO IT,
[0:56] his his part will be taken out of the
[0:59] book of life. We are not to TAKE AWAY
[1:02] FROM THE Bible or add to it. Just say
[1:04] what it says.
[1:07] Greetings, friends, in the matchless
[1:09] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The
[1:11] purpose of this video is to answer a few
[1:13] viewers questions about my convictions
[1:15] on the tapes. Should tapes be played in
[1:19] actual church services? But we'll start
[1:21] with the first question regarding a
[1:23] video I put out called no tapes no
[1:26] token. It was an excellent question. So
[1:28] we'll start with that one. By the grace
[1:30] of God. But first friends, I want to
[1:32] thank the Lord Jesus Christ for his
[1:33] grace and mercy for saving my soul. I'm
[1:36] sure you feel the same way. The greatest
[1:39] miracle is a soul that is saved. A
[1:42] sinner becoming a saint. a sinner's
[1:45] filthy garments being washed white by
[1:47] the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[1:50] going from a heart of stone to heart of
[1:52] flesh. We praise the Lord God for
[1:54] sending the gospel of our Lord Jesus
[1:56] Christ, giving us the good news of
[1:58] salvation and the beautiful revelation
[2:01] that not only does he save us, he
[2:03] sanctifies us, which is the second work
[2:05] of grace. Salvation is the first work of
[2:07] grace. Justification is another term for
[2:09] that. He saves us, sanctifies us. And
[2:11] the third work of grace is the baptism
[2:13] of the Holy Ghost. Christ in you, the
[2:15] hope of glory as Paul said in Colossians
[2:17] 1. So we first thank God for the blood
[2:20] of Jesus Christ and the filling of the
[2:22] Holy Ghost in the believer's soul. So
[2:24] the first question was about what I
[2:27] thought about paragraph 299 in the token
[2:30] message from September 1st, 1963
[2:33] on that one video called No Tapes, No
[2:36] Token. I said I agreed with the quote.
[2:38] And so this wonderful person asked a
[2:42] question. Let's look at the quote. It
[2:44] said, "But there must have been some
[2:45] tape boys slipped in somewhere for the
[2:47] predestinated seed. They slipped over to
[2:48] her house and played some tapes. She
[2:51] made her her own house a church to
[2:53] receive the message." End quote. Now
[2:56] friends, as I said, I agree with that
[2:58] quote if it's taken in the context. To
[3:01] understand the context, I would suggest
[3:02] watching the video that I made called
[3:05] tape boys are not the true five-fold
[3:07] ministry. Here's the thumbnail to that
[3:09] so you can get a visual of that. I'll
[3:11] leave a link to that in the description.
[3:13] Friends, Brandon Tabernacle says, "The
[3:16] true five-fold ministry just presses
[3:19] play and do not preach." That is an
[3:21] awful false doctrine. So, what they're
[3:24] implying is that the true five-fold
[3:26] ministry plays tapes. That would mean
[3:28] the false five ministry preaches. That's
[3:30] what they're implying. And they said
[3:32] only the royal seat of Abraham will play
[3:35] tapes, press play and obey and believe
[3:37] every word on tape. That's idolatry.
[3:39] That's heresy. So that's what they say.
[3:43] They say tape boys are the true
[3:44] five-fold ministry or the correct way
[3:46] for the five-fold ministry to operate.
[3:48] That's a false doctrine. You'll never
[3:50] find that in the Bible. That's a
[3:52] man-made creed or dogma as Jesus said in
[3:56] Matthew 15:9. And that's vain worship
[3:59] according to the Lord Jesus Christ. So
[4:01] in that video called tape boys are not
[4:04] the true five-fold ministry I start by
[4:05] showing the biblical foundation for
[4:07] preachers. Ephesians 4 7-16 Romans 10:14
[4:11] and 15 Mark 16:15
[4:14] Matthew 28 19 and 20 Jesus only ordained
[4:19] living men who were still in their
[4:21] corporal physical body to preach the
[4:23] gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[4:26] Ephesians 4 gives five purposes for the
[4:28] five-fold ministry. For the perfecting
[4:30] of the saints, that's the equipping, the
[4:32] work of the ministry, which is the
[4:34] undertaking of the ministry. The
[4:35] edifying of the body of Christ, that's
[4:37] promoting growth, the unity of the
[4:39] faith, which is the agreement of faith
[4:41] and beliefs, and the unity on the
[4:43] knowledge of the son of God, the unity
[4:45] of knowledge or precise truth that only
[4:47] comes through living preachers according
[4:50] to the Bible. And remember, Jesus Christ
[4:51] is the same yesterday, today, and
[4:53] forever. A lot of these tape boys miss
[4:56] the keystone of the Bible. Brother
[4:57] Brandham said that God is unchanging and
[5:00] so are his ways. So God's not going to
[5:02] change the five-fold ministry. God's not
[5:04] going to change his word. So we know
[5:06] God's program will always be to have
[5:08] living preachers. Now here's the
[5:10] beautiful quotes from that video.
[5:11] Brother Random says tapes are a
[5:14] secondarily way or they're a secondary
[5:17] ministry. Brother Ram talks about people
[5:19] who take his tapes and people are
[5:22] getting saved and healed, which is
[5:23] wonderful. He said, "Maybe they're not
[5:25] preachers, but they're trying to get the
[5:26] message to the people. God can use these
[5:29] things in a secondarily way like this."
[5:32] End quote. So, tape playing is not a
[5:35] primary way to preach the gospel. It's a
[5:38] secondary way, preaching the gospel.
[5:40] It's the highest form of getting the
[5:43] word of God to the people according to
[5:44] brother Brandham. And of course the
[5:46] Bible because the Bible had it first and
[5:48] brother Brandham got the revelation of
[5:49] it and then shared it with us. He said
[5:51] this in what is a vision 1956 quote
[5:54] that's the highest form. Preaching the
[5:56] gospel is the highest form. Then if you
[5:59] notice the Bible places it that way and
[6:01] he quotes Ephesians 4:11.
[6:04] So why don't the tape boys address these
[6:06] quotes? Why don't they use these quotes?
[6:08] Because it doesn't fit their man-made
[6:10] creed and dogma there. It doesn't fit
[6:12] their denominational creed. Remember
[6:14] friends, they got a deity spirit that
[6:16] doesn't want to obey the word of God.
[6:18] It's in rebellion against the plain
[6:20] written word of God. So that's why we
[6:23] pray for them. Pray for their repentance
[6:24] and so forth. Brother Random also says,
[6:27] quote, "We got a tape business around
[6:29] the world." End quote. In 1963, so the
[6:32] tape ministry was a secondary ministry.
[6:35] It was a business. He calls it a
[6:37] society. Quote, "We send them tapes free
[6:39] on a society, the church." End quote.
[6:43] So, the tapes were never to take the
[6:44] place of the five-fold ministry.
[6:47] And Brother Bram loved preachers.
[6:49] Brother Bam loved listening to
[6:50] preachers. He said, quote, in 1957, "I
[6:53] tell you the reason I love to hear
[6:55] Brother Neville speak. Not mainly
[6:57] because he's a good preacher, but
[6:59] because I know that he lives what he
[7:00] preaches." End quote. Friends, Brother
[7:03] Brandham never told Brother Neville to
[7:05] sit down and just press play. When
[7:07] brother Brandon was here, he believed in
[7:09] living preachers because that's what the
[7:11] Bible teaches. I found a quote recently
[7:14] that I'll make a separate video about
[7:16] from 1959 where brother Brandham
[7:18] actually says he follows the other
[7:20] preachers. And if that's thus sayith the
[7:23] Lord, what will the tape boy say about
[7:24] that? Brother Brandham said, "So I just
[7:27] listen to what they say and say amen and
[7:29] go on because they're men of God. I
[7:32] follow them. I find there in the Bible
[7:35] and tell the truth.
[7:38] Why didn't brother Ram tell all these
[7:39] ministers to sit down and press play?
[7:41] Why would Brother Ram say amen to living
[7:43] preachers if everybody's supposed to
[7:44] just press play? So, we can see it in
[7:46] every act of Brother Ram's life. He
[7:49] supported the five-fold ministry. He
[7:51] would sit down and say amen to Brother
[7:52] Neville, these other preachers out in
[7:54] San Jose, California, because that's the
[7:57] Bible foundation. That's the apostolic
[7:59] form. That's the apostolic pattern. And
[8:02] remember Abraham said, "Thus sayeth the
[8:03] Lord, the fullness of Pentecost will be
[8:05] in the bride." On the day of Pentecost,
[8:07] friends, was there any form of the
[8:10] apostles, the Holy Ghost fil saints
[8:12] pressing, play, and obey? I know there
[8:14] was not the technology to press, play,
[8:16] and play tapes and so forth. But was
[8:18] there any equivalent? Did the preacher
[8:19] just sit down and someone read straight
[8:22] from the Old Testament? No. They were
[8:24] filled with the Holy Ghost. And while
[8:25] yet Peter spake these words, the Holy
[8:28] Ghost fell on them that believed. So I'm
[8:30] combining Acts 2, Acts 8, Acts 10. The
[8:34] Holy Ghost came through living
[8:35] preachers, not by silencing or limiting
[8:38] preachers. So that's quite a foundation
[8:40] to get to this first question. I didn't
[8:42] really plan to do all that, but the
[8:43] first question is, how do you agree with
[8:45] paragraph 299? I agree with it because
[8:49] if you look at the story of Rahab,
[8:51] brother Brandon makes it seem like the
[8:53] two spies were like tape boys in a
[8:56] secondary way to go in and get the
[8:57] elect. But where was the ark of God?
[9:00] Where was the word of God? Where was the
[9:02] prophet of God? It was Joshua. And he
[9:04] was with the priests and with the ark,
[9:06] the presence of God. So in the type,
[9:08] Rahab is the last few believers that get
[9:11] saved before destruction. But the
[9:14] five-fold ministry we'd say or the
[9:16] ministry of that day was with Joshua the
[9:18] prophet and the priesthood, the Levites
[9:21] who had the presence of God. So the
[9:24] primary ministry of that day was Joshua
[9:27] the prophet and the Levitical priesthood
[9:29] who had the presence of God, the ark of
[9:31] God, thus sayeth the Lord. And then
[9:33] there was a secondary ministry that went
[9:35] down into Jericho to minister and save
[9:38] the final few souls before destruction
[9:41] hit. So that's why I agree with that
[9:43] quote. And then remember friends, the
[9:45] second time brother Brandon preached it
[9:47] in February of 64, he said he said
[9:50] somebody went in there or something. So
[9:52] it wasn't so he left it open. It could
[9:54] have been tape boys, could have been
[9:55] preachers and they played a tape or
[9:57] something another which means they could
[9:59] have played a tape. They could not have
[10:01] played a tape but the Ram was just using
[10:03] it as a hypothetical situation a type
[10:07] somehow there was a secondary ministry
[10:09] outside of the primary ministry that
[10:11] saved some souls. So that's why I agree
[10:13] with paragraph 299 by God's grace from
[10:16] the token message. I hope that's
[10:18] helpful. And again, remember Tabernacle
[10:20] is majoring on a minor. They're taking
[10:22] one paragraph, which is three sentence
[10:24] long, and they're completely changing
[10:26] the Bible. They're completely denying
[10:28] all these other quotes from Brother
[10:29] Brandom where he supports the five-fold
[10:30] ministry. They're in an awful spiritual
[10:33] condition. And if they don't repent,
[10:34] there's got to be some severe
[10:36] repercussions for taking away all those
[10:39] Bible scriptures about the five-fold
[10:41] ministry. They're taking away from the
[10:42] word of God. All right. Now, let's get
[10:44] to the second question here. by God's
[10:46] grace. I want to say first that I could
[10:48] appreciate the sincerity and the
[10:50] kindness of this question here online.
[10:54] The person's username on YouTube has
[10:56] David in it. So perhaps it's a brother.
[10:59] It says, "Dear brother Smith, it's my
[11:00] impression that Brother Joseph wants to
[11:02] make it clear that it is important for
[11:04] believers to hear the message from God
[11:06] through Brother Random for themselves,
[11:08] listening to exactly what Brother Ram
[11:09] says, not just listening to preachers
[11:12] who rephrase what he has already said on
[11:14] the tapes. I don't remember ever reading
[11:17] or hearing Brother Joseph say it wasn't
[11:19] okay for any church to have both live
[11:22] preaching and tape playing." Okay, so
[11:25] there's a lot in here, but let's try to
[11:27] break it down here. So, the first kind
[11:29] of criticism here is that preachers
[11:32] rephrase what's already been said on
[11:34] tapes. But you have to remember down
[11:36] through the 2,000 years of church
[11:38] history, preachers have always done
[11:40] that. They've tried their best to quote
[11:42] the word of God first and then other
[11:45] gifts of God. But remember, the word of
[11:46] God is the absolute. Not one word can be
[11:48] added or taken away from the word of
[11:50] God. And friends, any true Holy Ghost
[11:52] fil man of God is not trying to rephrase
[11:54] what's on tape or rephrase what's in the
[11:56] Bible. They're just trying to say what
[11:58] the Bible says. So here it looks like
[12:00] this commenter, of course, is probably
[12:02] upset with preachers who have given
[12:05] false doctrine, which I'm upset with
[12:06] that, too. I hate that, too. I pray for
[12:08] those people to repent, those preachers
[12:10] who preach false doctrine. But remember,
[12:12] for 2,000 years, the Holy Ghost has
[12:14] guided the church into all truth. The
[12:17] Holy Ghost has revealed his word to the
[12:19] seven church age messengers, and then
[12:21] all those that hear the voice of the
[12:23] messenger echo the same message. It's
[12:25] the word of God. So real preachers are
[12:28] not trying to rephrase something.
[12:29] They're just trying to preach the same
[12:31] thing. And then secondly, this person
[12:33] doesn't remember brother Joseph saying
[12:35] it wasn't okay to have both living or
[12:38] live preachers or tape playing. Well, I
[12:40] got numerous videos on this. Our
[12:42] precious brother Joseph said preachers
[12:44] got to catch the vision. They've got to
[12:46] play the tapes. That's a mandate. That's
[12:49] a denominational mandate where they've
[12:51] got to do it. Or else he calls them
[12:53] deeis or makeelbelievers. Well, how can
[12:56] it be okay to be a deemist or make
[12:58] believer? So that's what I said in my
[13:00] previous video. The pastor brom
[13:02] tabernacle is taking both sides. You
[13:04] can't take both sides. It's okay to
[13:06] preach, but no, they got to catch the
[13:08] vision. They got to play the tapes or
[13:09] else you're a deus and a makebeliever.
[13:12] That's what the pastor said. That's not
[13:14] what I said. So this person probably
[13:16] hasn't heard the exact quotes of Joseph
[13:18] Brandom. So I'll leave links to those in
[13:20] the description. There's over 24 plus
[13:23] lies coming out of Brandom Tabernacle
[13:25] and they failed to address any of them.
[13:26] So that shows something's wrong with
[13:28] them if they won't address their false
[13:31] doctrines and their false statements.
[13:34] Okay. Second paragraph. Do you think
[13:36] it's fine to have live preaching by a
[13:38] pastor or assistant pastor and also have
[13:40] the tapes played in the church as well?
[13:43] That seems like the best and overall
[13:44] most sensible and sane way to go about
[13:46] it. Many churches do that. that they
[13:48] have both regular preaching by the
[13:50] current local pastor and some services
[13:52] are tape services. The Brandom
[13:54] Tabernacle often did that. When Brother
[13:57] Collins was pastor, they often played a
[13:59] tape on Wednesday evenings. Sometimes
[14:01] brother Collins preached the message on
[14:02] Sunday morning. Sometimes a tape often a
[14:04] longer tape would be played on Sunday.
[14:06] Wednesday nights were frequently saved
[14:08] for shorter out of town tapes such as
[14:11] some from other cities away from Jeff
[14:14] with healing lines and lots of
[14:16] discernment.
[14:18] Okay, so the question was, do I think
[14:20] it's fine to have living preachers and
[14:23] play tapes? That's up to the local
[14:25] pastor. Now, for me, I don't believe
[14:27] that's the right way to do it, cuz
[14:29] that's not how Brother Brandham did it.
[14:31] And that's not how the Holy Ghost fil
[14:32] saints have done it throughout the 2,000
[14:35] years of church history of preachers
[14:37] filled with the Holy Ghost. But let's
[14:39] focus on Brother Brandham's day. Brother
[14:41] Brandham never had Brother Neville
[14:43] press, play, and obey. So that's why I
[14:46] do not think it's fine to do that. Now
[14:47] if a pastor wants to take some time and
[14:50] play a tape in separate services, then
[14:52] that would be fine. But the model that
[14:54] brother left us was for living preachers
[14:57] to always preach the living word. It was
[14:59] to never sit down the preachers and just
[15:01] press play. I'll just say this, friends.
[15:04] Anyone I know that has the baptism of
[15:06] the Holy Ghost loves to listen to
[15:08] Brother Brandham in their free time when
[15:10] they're away from church is what I'm
[15:12] talking about. If people need to go to
[15:14] church and listen to brother Brandham,
[15:15] they're not born again. Brother Brandham
[15:17] said, "If you've got the Holy Ghost, it
[15:19] can only feed on the word of God." So
[15:21] that means you read your Bible, you
[15:22] pray, you listen to Brother Brandham,
[15:24] you read the church age book, or you
[15:26] read the seven seal book, you are
[15:28] staying in the word of God. If you've
[15:30] got it, go to church to hear brother
[15:31] Brandham, you're probably not born
[15:33] again. Now, the next point on this was
[15:35] Brother Collins. Well, Brother Collins
[15:37] didn't do the same thing brother Neville
[15:39] did. So I think that's where a lot of
[15:41] the problems started with Brandham
[15:42] Tabernacle once brother Neville left and
[15:45] you started getting this hybrid type of
[15:47] ministry of sometimes playing tapes,
[15:49] sometimes preaching. That's not what
[15:50] brother Brandham did. That's not what
[15:52] St. Paul did. That's not what any true
[15:55] Holy Ghost fililled preacher down
[15:56] through the years did. It's only been an
[15:59] issue or hybrid form of worship since
[16:02] Brother Collins took over. And God rest
[16:05] his soul, I don't know his salvation. I
[16:08] don't know anything about him really.
[16:10] But if he changed what brother Neville
[16:12] did who was obeying what brother
[16:14] Brandham said, then there's a problem
[16:16] with that. The next paragraph says, "A
[16:19] variety of both the current pastor and
[16:21] tape services seems the way to go."
[16:23] Brother Brandham said, "The best way is
[16:25] the middle of the road. Not going off on
[16:26] a tangent to the far right or to the
[16:28] left. That seems like the very best way
[16:30] to do it." Okay, so this is misapplying
[16:33] a quote, friends. This person, bless
[16:35] their heart, they're applying the middle
[16:37] of the road quote to tape playing in a
[16:40] church service, which Brother Brandham
[16:41] never did. When Brother Brandham talked
[16:43] about the middle of the road, I just put
[16:44] out a video about it recently, the
[16:46] middle of the road. He was talking about
[16:48] being in the middle road between emotion
[16:51] and intellectualism.
[16:54] He wasn't talking about in the middle of
[16:55] the road between playing tapes and live
[16:57] preachers. In the Bible days and when
[17:00] brother Brandham was here with brother
[17:01] Neville, there was no middle of the road
[17:03] of well, we'll play tapes on Wednesday,
[17:05] we'll preach on Sunday. That it was all
[17:07] preaching. It was all living men
[17:09] preaching the living word because Jesus
[17:12] Christ is the same yesterday, today, and
[17:13] forever. I just can't wrap my mind
[17:15] around these people that are trying to
[17:16] bring a hybrid gospel. Change Acts
[17:20] chapter 2. Change the book of Acts into
[17:22] somehow preaching sometime, tape playing
[17:24] another time. Friends, you're changing
[17:27] the gospel of Jesus Christ. You cannot
[17:29] do that. You cannot add one word. You
[17:32] cannot take one word away. Again,
[17:34] there's no Bible verse that says living
[17:36] preachers will sit down, the five-fold
[17:38] will sit down and press play at the end
[17:40] time, part-time or full-time. It's
[17:43] full-time preaching by men who are
[17:46] baptized with the Holy Ghost. That's the
[17:48] gospel pattern. And Jesus Christ is the
[17:50] same yesterday, today, and forever. The
[17:53] next paragraph says, "Brother Joseph
[17:54] seems to me anyway to be stressing that
[17:56] it is wrong for any pastor of a church
[17:58] to absolutely prohibit tapes from being
[18:00] played in the church. If a pastor
[18:02] prohibits tapes from being played the
[18:04] church, whether people want to admit it
[18:06] or not, is certainly comes across that
[18:08] the pastor, whether truly intentional or
[18:10] not, is trying to keep the people from
[18:11] listening directly to the prophet's
[18:13] words. Sort of like the idea of a
[18:15] spiritual leader in the times past to
[18:16] say to his congregation, "Do not read
[18:19] what Moses or Isaiah wrote. I will
[18:21] rephrase it and explain it to you what
[18:23] Moses really meant.
[18:25] So, I don't agree with this, brother.
[18:27] From everything I've heard from brother
[18:28] Joseph, I don't believe that's what he's
[18:29] saying. Remember, he said they've got to
[18:32] catch the vision. They've got to play
[18:34] the tapes. So, that was a denominational
[18:36] mandate from our dear brother Joseph.
[18:39] So, I think tapes would be good if
[18:40] there's no preacher available. For
[18:42] example, there's been a few times I was
[18:44] sick over the 19 years I've been pastor
[18:46] and there was no preachers. So, I asked
[18:49] the brethren to play a tape. So, I
[18:50] believe tape playing is for when there
[18:52] are no living preachers available. And
[18:55] that's what brother Brandham said twice
[18:56] in questions and answers 1964. There's
[18:59] only two times brother Ram said it was
[19:01] okay to play tapes and it was when there
[19:03] was no living preacher. And think about
[19:05] all the message preachers. I don't know
[19:08] if they're all faithful, but just to
[19:09] make the point, there are so many
[19:10] message preachers, living men of God,
[19:13] preaching the living word of God in the
[19:14] Jeffersonville area, and yet these
[19:16] people will sit at home, they'll disobey
[19:19] Hebrews 10 24 and 25 and not go to
[19:22] church, which Brother Bram never
[19:24] supported. Brother Ram said, "You can't
[19:25] be as good of a Christian if you sit
[19:28] home and don't physically go to church."
[19:30] He said, "The awfulst cults don't go to
[19:32] church and won't work." Then how can you
[19:35] SAY YOU CAN STAY HOME AND BE JUST AS
[19:37] GOOD a Christian as you would be a
[19:38] church?
[19:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:39] &gt;&gt; You can't do it.
[19:42] [clears throat]
[19:43] &gt;&gt; Read the word. The Holy Spirit feeds on
[19:46] the word.
[19:48] &gt;&gt; The Bible is God's spiritual diet
[19:54] &gt;&gt; for his church. And the Holy Spirit is
[19:57] the one who brings it to you
[20:00] &gt;&gt; and places it in the heart. and with
[20:03] thanksgiving you water.
[20:05] &gt;&gt; So, it's cult mentality to not go to
[20:08] church. It's cult mentality to not have
[20:10] living preachers. As a pastor, I tell
[20:13] the people, listen to the tapes at home.
[20:15] If not, you're going to get spiritually
[20:16] weak. You're going to get distracted.
[20:18] You're going to get your eyes on the
[20:20] things of the world. True Holy Ghost fil
[20:22] people will be in the word all the way.
[20:25] Like brother Ram said in the church age
[20:27] book, they will search the scriptures
[20:29] daily. As Acts 17:11 says, whether these
[20:32] things, brother Ram said, were so
[20:33] because that's what they did to St. Paul
[20:35] in the book of Acts. And we are getting
[20:37] the book of Acts restored. It's thus
[20:39] sayith the Lord. The fullness of the
[20:41] book of Acts will be in the bride. The
[20:44] next paragraph about the quote referring
[20:45] to Rahab, the harlot, and the tapes. I
[20:47] think I can skip that paragraph because
[20:49] there's no questions there. I agree
[20:51] there were no tapes in the days of
[20:53] Rahab. I explained that earlier. The
[20:55] next paragraph says, "Brother Brandham
[20:57] stressed so many times that he was
[20:58] carrying a message from the Lord. His
[20:59] message were thoughts of God concerning
[21:01] this end time and what needed to be
[21:03] understood by the elect that were being
[21:06] transmitted to the people through
[21:07] brother Brandham and they were being
[21:09] recorded for reason." So believers then
[21:11] in the times to come would recognize the
[21:13] voice and go back and listen for
[21:14] themselves to what God was trying to get
[21:17] across to those who were predestinated
[21:19] for eternal life. I agree with
[21:21] everything in there, but brother Ram
[21:23] said, "Go listen to them in the hotel or
[21:24] in the private the quietness of your
[21:26] home." Brother Ram never said, "Brother
[21:28] Neville, sit down and just press play."
[21:31] Remember the last time Brother Ram
[21:32] preached in Brandham Tabernacle, he felt
[21:34] led the Lord to have Brother Neville
[21:35] preach in the morning. He honored the
[21:38] five-fold ministry. Brother Ram sat down
[21:40] and said, "Amen." And Brother Neville
[21:42] preached a wonderful message. And then
[21:44] Brother Ram preached, I believe it was
[21:45] Satan's Eden in the evening if I'm not
[21:47] mistaken. So go look that up. Why don't
[21:49] the tape boys go look that up and see if
[21:51] that's right or not? It's right. The
[21:52] word of God is right. There's quotes
[21:54] where brother Ram says, "Pastors are
[21:56] higher offices than his office."
[22:02] There's quotes where brother Ram says,
[22:03] "He can't interpret the word of God. No
[22:04] man can interpret the word of God."
[22:08] So, tape boys ignore all these quotes.
[22:11] They're just trying to push their one
[22:12] agenda, their own false doctrine, their
[22:15] own pet doctrine that breaks the word of
[22:17] God because they're led by the wrong
[22:19] spirit. The spirit that denies the word.
[22:22] They're not preaching Jesus Christ is
[22:24] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[22:26] Brother Brandham never told people to
[22:28] sit down and press play and obey and
[22:31] silence living preachers because they'd
[22:33] be neglecting their gifts. And the last
[22:36] paragraph said, "Anyway, I think it is
[22:38] perfectly reasonable and good to hear
[22:39] the tapes for yourself in both churches
[22:41] and homes and listen to other preachers
[22:44] too if you desire." Now, pause right
[22:47] there. Yes, I believe it's okay to
[22:48] listen to other preachers who are filled
[22:50] with the Holy Ghost and listen to tapes
[22:52] in both your homes and church if there's
[22:55] no living preacher or if the living
[22:58] pastor wants to let the people hear a
[23:01] specific sermon. That's fine. But it
[23:03] should not be the regular pattern of the
[23:06] church because that's not the pattern of
[23:07] the book of Acts. It's living men filled
[23:10] with the living word of God. Look at
[23:11] Acts chapter 2. What did they do? They
[23:13] continued steadfastly in the apostles
[23:15] doctrine and fellowship. That means the
[23:17] apostles were preaching, teaching the
[23:19] word of God. Living men preaching the
[23:22] truth by the Holy Ghost to the new
[23:24] believers to feed their souls.
[23:26] tape boys are breaking the pattern of
[23:28] Acts chapter 2 and the entire book of
[23:30] Acts by just saying press play and obey.
[23:32] It's sin. It's heresy. It's a lie. It's
[23:35] false doctrine. It's idolatry. So true
[23:38] men of God who are filled with the Holy
[23:40] Ghost will believe Hebrews 13:8 in
[23:42] regards to the five-fold ministry and
[23:45] how brother Brandham modeled that
[23:47] throughout his ministry. He never told
[23:50] the preachers to sit down and just press
[23:52] play. Finishing the paragraph. Brother
[23:54] Jesse, are you yourself against the idea
[23:56] of permitting message believing churches
[23:58] to play Brother Ram's tapes in actual
[24:00] church services? I'm not sure if I
[24:02] understand. Thank you and God bless you.
[24:04] Yes, God bless you as well to this
[24:06] precious brother whoever wrote this. So
[24:08] yes, I am against message churches
[24:11] playing Brother Random's tapes in actual
[24:13] church services if they have living
[24:15] preachers because that's the pattern of
[24:17] the book of Acts. That's the pattern
[24:19] brother Brandham set forth through his
[24:21] entire ministry. I wish these tape boys
[24:23] would go listen to what house will you
[24:25] build me in 1965 November. Brother Ram
[24:28] says Perry Green church. He said this is
[24:29] my church.
[24:32] And he said I don't want to take up all
[24:34] the pastor's time speaking of Perry
[24:35] Green. He's a gifted brother. He can
[24:37] really preach the word of God. So
[24:39] brother Bam hurried with his dedication
[24:42] and ordained Perry Green. And then
[24:43] Brother Bam sat down and listened to a
[24:45] living man of God. Why don't the T boys
[24:48] ever talk about that? Why don't they
[24:50] look at that pattern? A month before
[24:52] brother Brandham passed away, he tries
[24:54] to hurry so he can sit down and hear a
[24:57] living man preach the living word of
[24:59] God, not press, play, and obey. And I
[25:02] just wish these tape boys would remember
[25:04] the quotes from Brother Brandham from
[25:05] 1964. Brother Ram said, "He's not the
[25:08] only one that should preach." So tape
[25:10] boys are going against that quote by
[25:12] having only brother Random preach.
[25:13] Brother Random said, "We need them."
[25:15] speaking of the preachers with a call of
[25:16] God to preach questions answers 64 part
[25:19] three and he said don't change a thing
[25:21] about the evangelical ministry questions
[25:23] answers on the seal 64 the Brandham
[25:26] tabernacle has no evangelists they only
[25:28] have tape boys who give out agapo
[25:30] tablets and say press play obey
[25:33] completely changed the evangelical
[25:35] ministry why don't they address that
[25:37] question why don't they address that
[25:38] topic because they have a false doctrine
[25:41] because they have a deity spirit that
[25:43] worships brother Brandham and the tapes
[25:45] So in closing, I just want to thank this
[25:47] precious brother for this humble
[25:48] question and of course the sister who
[25:49] asked the first question. Hope this is
[25:52] clear. I hope people know that brother
[25:54] Ram's goal was to give us a true
[25:57] relationship with Jesus Christ and Jesus
[25:59] Christ is the same yesterday, today and
[26:01] forever. And the gospel of Jesus Christ
[26:04] cannot change. Brother Random did not
[26:06] change it. He came to restore it.
[26:08] Brother Ram's ministry was a restoration
[26:10] ministry of the book of Acts. And you
[26:12] don't have any equivalent to just
[26:13] sitting down preachers and just saying
[26:15] press play and obey. You don't have any
[26:18] equivalent of this false ministry of the
[26:21] current tape ministry in the book of
[26:23] Acts. True Holy Ghost-filled men of God
[26:26] will not change the five-fold ministry
[26:28] that started on the day of Pentecost
[26:30] 2,000 years ago. They can't because they
[26:33] have the Holy Ghost in them. They have
[26:34] the seal of the Holy Ghost and they
[26:36] won't add to the word or take away from
[26:38] the word. Tape boys have to delete so
[26:41] many Bible scriptures and delete so many
[26:43] quotes from brother Brandham in order to
[26:45] get to their radicalized unbiblical
[26:48] heretical teaching of just press play
[26:50] and obey. Friends, just keep praying for
[26:52] some of these people to repent and leave
[26:54] the idolatry of the tape church
[26:57] movement, the press play and obey
[26:59] movement. May God have mercy on them and
[27:02] we pray they'll come back to the word of
[27:04] God which is forever settled in heaven.
[27:07] And Jesus Christ is the same yesterday,
[27:09] today, and forever.

[27:16] God bless you and may Jesus Christ
[27:18] [music] be the desire of your heart.
[27:22] &gt;&gt; Very happy to be here this afternoon and
[27:24] again in defense of the gospel of Jesus
[27:26] Christ to bring the good tidings, the
[27:30] good news that Jesus raised from the
[27:31] dead, living among man today, his
[27:34] church. [music]
[27:35] The same Jesus that was yesterday will
[27:37] be today and forever.
[27:40] He never failed.
