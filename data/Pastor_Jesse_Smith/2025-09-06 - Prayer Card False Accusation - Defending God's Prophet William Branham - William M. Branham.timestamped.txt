[0:00] [Music]
[0:03] You don't even have to have your prayer
[0:04] cards. You know that. My hardly any of
[0:07] them last evening had prayer cards. The
[0:09] prayer card just keep everybody from
[0:10] rushing up at once so they can be in
[0:12] order and have some kind of a system to
[0:14] it.
[0:15] &gt;&gt; Greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:17] of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of
[0:20] this video is to defend God's prophet
[0:22] William Brham and his use of prayer
[0:24] cards. Some of Brother Brandham's
[0:27] accusers have tried to accuse Brother
[0:30] Brandham of using prayer cards in a
[0:33] dishonest way, accusing Brother Brandham
[0:36] of pretending to have the gift of
[0:38] discernment. Of course, we know that's a
[0:39] lie. Brother Brandham had a genuine gift
[0:41] of discernment given to him by the Lord
[0:44] Jesus Christ. So, in this video, we'll
[0:46] go through the simple answers that prove
[0:49] brother Brandham used prayer cards
[0:51] honestly and he had a genuine gift of
[0:54] discernment by the gift of the Holy
[0:55] Ghost. Before getting into that, let's
[0:58] review the impeccable Christian
[1:00] character of God's prophet, Brother
[1:01] William Brandham. From the very first
[1:03] moment I heard brother Brandham preach,
[1:04] I started weeping when he gave his life
[1:07] story. Brother Brandham is the most
[1:09] faithful Bible teacher I have ever
[1:10] heard. He meets the six qualifications
[1:13] to be a prophet. And remember, there
[1:14] could be more qualifications. First, he
[1:16] had thus sayith the Lords that came to
[1:18] pass. I have a video with at least six
[1:20] thus sayith the Lords that came to pass
[1:22] spoken before the event in 1958. Thus
[1:26] sayith the Lord, Marilyn Hickey would
[1:27] have a baby. She had it 10 years later.
[1:30] Second, 1961, no greater gift to the
[1:32] Gentiles than Brother Ram's gift. 1962,
[1:35] women would continue to strip
[1:36] themselves. 1965, the vision of the
[1:39] United States, America, dancing to rock
[1:42] and roll with bobta women. 1965, the
[1:45] death of Florence Shicaran. And 1965, no
[1:48] denomination will break up and come back
[1:50] to the word. The second qualification,
[1:52] he revealed the secrets of the Bible,
[1:54] most notably the revelation of the seven
[1:56] seals in fulfillment of Amos 3:7,
[1:59] Revelation 10:7, of course, Revelation
[2:01] 6, and Revelation chapter 8. Thirdly,
[2:04] brother Brandham had godly life with
[2:06] good fruits of his ministry. Fourth, he
[2:09] had fruit to his ministry which are
[2:11] saved souls. Fifth, he taught the word
[2:13] in its purity. And six, he had
[2:15] supernatural works, dreams, and visions
[2:18] from the Lord Jesus Christ. So, it's
[2:20] undeniable William Brandham was a
[2:22] genuine prophet of God. Some people have
[2:24] questions about other events in Brother
[2:26] Brham's life. I have a short section in
[2:28] my brown bear vision video that goes
[2:30] through numerous other topics such as
[2:33] the brown bear vision. God fulfilled his
[2:36] part. Brother Brandham failed his part
[2:37] and there's 10 Bible examples of
[2:39] believers who failed visions yet they
[2:41] were still true believers. The 10th
[2:44] vision, brother Ram was confused about
[2:45] it his whole life, but I think all the
[2:47] evidence is clear that it was fulfilled
[2:50] the week he preached the seven seals in
[2:52] March of 1963.
[2:54] The municipal bridge prophecy is Brother
[2:56] Ram's word against Brother Ram's
[2:58] accuser's words. They admit two people
[3:00] died in the construction of the bridge.
[3:03] So it wouldn't be a stretch for 16
[3:05] people to have died in some type of
[3:07] cover up. So again, it's Brother Ram's
[3:09] word against them. So it's Brother Ram's
[3:12] word against the accuser's word. I'm
[3:13] going to go with brother Brandon because
[3:14] he's a genuine prophet of God. I'm going
[3:16] to give him the benefit of the doubt.
[3:18] The vision of the 300,000. And I believe
[3:20] that was fulfilled in 1954 in Bombay,
[3:23] India because the mayor estimated
[3:25] 500,000 came to the meetings. And
[3:28] remember friends, prophets can get
[3:29] confused with visions just like John the
[3:31] Baptist. He said, "Should we look for
[3:32] another or is Jesus the Messiah?" And
[3:35] also Elijah was told to do three things.
[3:37] Anoint three men and Elijah only did
[3:39] one. So God could interpret his word any
[3:42] way he wants. So, Brother Brandham could
[3:44] have went to India and had a large group
[3:47] and maybe not the entire number of
[3:49] 300,000, but then God could have done it
[3:51] through ministries that came after
[3:52] brother Brandham that preached the same
[3:54] gospel, the saving healing gospel of the
[3:57] Lord Jesus Christ. Hebrews 13:8, God
[3:59] could have fulfilled it through other
[4:00] preachers anointed with the same spirit.
[4:03] And lastly, the Arizona cloud, February
[4:06] 28th, 1963. Twice, Brother Ram said, "In
[4:08] the name of the Lord, something was
[4:09] going to happen with a snow white
[4:11] pyramid. It was prophesied beforehand
[4:13] and it came to pass. The vindication was
[4:16] the revelation of the seven seals was
[4:18] unlike any other teaching. It was unlike
[4:22] Clarence Larkin. It was unlike Charles
[4:23] Day's Russell and Uriah Smith. I have a
[4:25] video series on that. There's over 38
[4:27] differences between brother Ram's
[4:28] revelation from the Lord Jesus Christ on
[4:30] the seven seals versus Larkin Russell
[4:33] and Uriah Smith. In my 2021 book, I have
[4:36] 30 thus sayith the Lords from God's
[4:38] prophet, brother Brandham. 11 of them
[4:40] are future thus sayith the Lords that
[4:42] will come to pass. Six of them are thus
[4:44] sayith the Lord related to the 12 New
[4:46] Testament mysteries. Eight thus sayith
[4:48] the Lords are related to doctrinal
[4:51] subjects from the Bible restoring Paul's
[4:53] gospel. And the rest of them are the
[4:56] prophecies that have come to pass. As I
[4:57] mentioned earlier,
[4:59] friends, we also want to remember the
[5:01] character of some of Brother's accusers.
[5:02] Not all of them, but some of Brother
[5:04] Ham's accusers are very disingenuous.
[5:06] I've offered free copies of my books to
[5:08] them. They don't want them. They won't
[5:10] research the other side. That shows me
[5:12] they're not true researchers. They're
[5:14] not interested in facts and truth. And
[5:16] yet, I'll listen to their podcast. I'll
[5:18] watch their videos and respond to them.
[5:20] And I never get any reply. For example,
[5:22] my video series on the seven seals. I
[5:24] show pictures from Larkin's books,
[5:27] Russell's books, proving Brother Ram did
[5:29] not plagiarize them, but the accusers
[5:31] won't reach out and respond to those. I
[5:34] made a video showing how Brother Ram did
[5:36] not pretend to speak in tongues, proving
[5:38] it's a false accusation, and Brother
[5:41] Ram's accusers never reply to that. I
[5:44] wrote an entire book on Christian
[5:46] modesty. Brother Ram's accusers won't
[5:48] read it, won't respond to it. So, as
[5:50] Jesus said, a tree is known by its
[5:52] fruit. All right, friends. So, let's
[5:53] start talking about the prayer cards.
[5:55] The accusation is that brother Brandham
[5:57] memorized the prayer cards and was
[5:59] pretending to discern the thoughts
[6:00] intents of the heart. But we know that's
[6:02] not true. We know brother Brandham had a
[6:04] genuine prophetic gift. It was the son
[6:07] of man anointing a son of man. The Lord
[6:09] Jesus Christ anointed brother Brandham
[6:11] with the gift of discernment. A
[6:13] prophetic gift. First, it's ridiculous
[6:15] to say brother Random memorized all the
[6:17] prayer cards. Some delusional accusers
[6:20] of brother Random contradict themselves
[6:22] by claiming brother Random memorized the
[6:24] cards. At the same time, they slander
[6:26] him by saying he couldn't remember all
[6:28] the details about the stories and
[6:30] testimonies he would repeatedly share
[6:32] around the nation and around the world.
[6:34] So, do they think brother Brandham had a
[6:36] good memory or not? See friends, they
[6:38] contradict themselves. So, that's the
[6:40] first clue they're falsely accusing
[6:41] brother Brandham. Second, it's
[6:43] ridiculous to say Billy Paul whispered
[6:45] the information to brother Brandham in
[6:47] the prayer lines. That doesn't explain
[6:48] the many, many prayer lines when Billy
[6:50] Paul was not up on the platform or near
[6:53] the pulpit and God was still using
[6:54] brother Brandham to reveal the thoughts
[6:56] and intents of the heart of the sick who
[6:59] were in the prayer line. I don't believe
[7:01] Billy Paul was ever whispering the
[7:03] information to brother Brandham. Brother
[7:05] Brandham had a true gift of discernment
[7:07] from the Lord Jesus Christ. Now friends,
[7:09] brother Bram told us one reason he used
[7:11] the prayer cards. It was to keep
[7:13] everybody from rushing up at once.
[7:15] Brother Ram said this in 1951 at thy
[7:17] word. So brother Ram did not use prayer
[7:19] cards in deceit. He used it for order
[7:23] and for a system. Let's listen to the
[7:25] quote.
[7:26] &gt;&gt; You don't even have to have your prayer
[7:27] cards. You know that. My hardly any of
[7:30] them last evening had prayer cards. The
[7:32] prayer card just keep everybody rushing
[7:34] up at once so they can be in order and
[7:36] have some kind of a system to it.
[7:38] The next obvious truth concerning the
[7:40] prayer lines that shows the ridiculous
[7:42] nature of the false accusation is how
[7:45] brother Brandham would often speak
[7:46] numerous secret details about the
[7:49] believers who were standing before him
[7:51] in the prayer lines. And this was proof
[7:54] he was in fact seeing visions from the
[7:56] Holy Spirit about the sick person's
[7:58] life. And this was a great thought a
[8:00] brother from Germany shared with me. So
[8:02] I want to thank that brother. He and I
[8:04] are in contact on the Telegram app. So I
[8:06] appreciate this precious brother and
[8:08] this is true because all these details
[8:09] brother revealed on the platform through
[8:12] visions could not fit on a prayer card.
[8:15] So as the thumbnail of this video shows
[8:18] here's an example of a prayer card. It
[8:21] says brand campaigns as the person's
[8:23] name the address are you a Christian and
[8:27] the card number and then a place to name
[8:30] their affliction. From what I can tell
[8:33] and from what I've seen, I've never seen
[8:35] different prayer cards that have a lot
[8:38] more space to list all the details that
[8:40] would be needed for brother Random to
[8:42] memorize and share in the prayer lines.
[8:45] And this proves Brother Ram did not
[8:47] pretend to discern. He had a genuine
[8:49] gift of discernment by the Holy Ghost.
[8:51] There's many testimonies of believers
[8:53] online sharing that that they were
[8:55] discerned by the gift in Brother Ram's
[8:57] life. Things Brother Ram could not have
[8:58] known. One simple example of this is the
[9:01] sister named Eva York from 1954, The
[9:04] Deep Calleth into Under the Deep. I
[9:06] showed this section on a video called
[9:07] Three Prophecies of William Brham.
[9:10] Brother Random reveals 15 secrets of Eva
[9:13] York from this 1954 video. First, she's
[9:17] sick. There's a dark spirit around her.
[9:18] Second, third, it's a spirit of death.
[9:20] Fourth, it's a form of cancer. Fifth,
[9:22] it's breast cancer. Sixth, she was
[9:25] examined by a strong person. Now, think
[9:27] about that. She could have been examined
[9:29] by a weaker, older male or female. But
[9:32] here, Brother Bram knows the secret of
[9:34] her heart because it's a gift of
[9:36] discernment from the Holy Ghost.
[9:38] Seventh, it was a ruptured condition in
[9:40] the boughels. Eighth, stomach trouble.
[9:42] Ninth, severe heart trouble causing
[9:44] fainting. Friends, this information
[9:46] could not have fit on Eva's prayer card.
[9:49] 10th, she nearly passed out sitting on a
[9:50] bed. And then 11th, there's another dark
[9:52] spirit. 12th is her name. 13th is her
[9:55] address. 14th is she lives in the city.
[9:58] 15th, she's going home to be well. Let's
[10:00] watch the video. By God's grace,
[10:02] &gt;&gt; of course, you're sick
[10:04] and you're suffering with a condition
[10:08] that's it's a dark spirit around you.
[10:10] It's death
[10:12] and it's in a form of cancer.
[10:15] And the cancer is located on the breast.
[10:19] and you're senior examined by someone
[10:23] strong and it's a you got a a ruptured
[10:26] condition and the rupture is in the
[10:28] bowel and you have a stomach trouble
[10:32] also a severe heart trouble that caused
[10:35] you fainting
[10:37] here a few days ago you're sitting
[10:39] sideways on the side of a bed and nearly
[10:41] passed out looking towards your window
[10:47] [Music]
[10:48] are those things truth. Yes,
[10:50] &gt;&gt; that was all true.
[10:51] &gt;&gt; All true.
[10:52] &gt;&gt; Or whatever it was, of course, it's gone
[10:54] from you. But what do you think that was
[10:57] that knows your lie? Was it Jesus
[11:00] Christ? You accept it to be that.
[11:03] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[11:04] &gt;&gt; I do.
[11:05] &gt;&gt; You're willing. You know that something
[11:07] supernatural is here.
[11:09] &gt;&gt; And if you believe it to be the Lord
[11:10] Jesus as I have preached it out of the
[11:13] word and you believe it to be the Lord
[11:15] Jesus.
[11:16] &gt;&gt; Yes, I do.
[11:17] &gt;&gt; I know there's a dark spirit. see it
[11:18] hanging at you yet? It's something very
[11:20] serious.
[11:22] Say, "I see you.
[11:25] Your name is uh Eva."
[11:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[11:31] &gt;&gt; And your last name is York.
[11:33] &gt;&gt; And you live in this city.
[11:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[11:35] &gt;&gt; And your house number is 6136 Street. Is
[11:39] that right?
[11:40] &gt;&gt; You're going home to be well.
[11:42] &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ, may you go
[11:46] and be made well.
[11:48] [Music]
[11:54] I'd like to add one more quote here. I
[11:56] remember this from 1960. This is from As
[11:58] I Was with Moses. So, uh, so will I be
[12:00] with thee. In this quote, brother Ram
[12:02] seems to regret using prayer cards to
[12:05] some degree because he said he was
[12:07] focusing too much emphasis on the sign
[12:10] instead of the commission. And there's
[12:12] numerous quotes like this, of course, if
[12:14] you know, if you listen to God's
[12:15] prophet, Brother Brandham. But I just
[12:16] thought I would share this one. It seems
[12:18] Brother Ram used these prayer cards
[12:20] again because of the rush of people that
[12:22] would want to come forward and be prayed
[12:24] for and perhaps have a discernment or
[12:27] have brother Ram break out into a vision
[12:28] of their life as they're pulling on the
[12:30] gift of God. But here in 1960, brother
[12:33] Ram says, "All the Pentecostal people
[12:34] like signs, but the commission was to
[12:37] pray for the sick." And then he says
[12:38] these humble words. Listen. He said,
[12:40] "And tens of thousands times thousands
[12:43] that I have failed to pray for because
[12:45] they all desired the sign. They all
[12:48] desire it." End quote. So here, Brother
[12:50] Ram's over 13 years or likely 13 or 12
[12:53] years into his ministry, and it seems
[12:56] like he realizes I'm putting too much
[12:57] emphasis on the discernment, the prayer
[13:00] lines, the prayer cards because it
[13:02] slowed down the number of people I could
[13:04] pray for. A very humble thing for a
[13:06] prophet of God to say. But again, it's
[13:08] just like every Bible prophet. Abraham
[13:10] made mistakes. Noah made mistakes. Moses
[13:14] made mistakes. Joshua made mistakes.
[13:17] John the Baptist was human, made
[13:18] mistakes. So, we can see here how
[13:21] Brother Brandham in his humanity wasn't
[13:23] perfect. He had to rely upon the grace
[13:25] of God just like every other sinner
[13:27] saved by grace. Let's listen to the
[13:28] quote.
[13:30] &gt;&gt; I've wronged. I've done wrong. That's
[13:34] why I base these sermons the way I have
[13:36] because he said, "As I was with Moses',
[13:39] so I be with you."
[13:41] And when that hand come down and pointed
[13:43] that very same scripture, for a long
[13:45] time I've wondered because I didn't know
[13:46] what the commission was. I've looked for
[13:49] something supernatural beyond that. God
[13:51] cannot get away from his commission.
[13:54] &gt;&gt; God gives a commission. That's what it
[13:56] must remain. But all the Pentecostal
[13:58] people like signs.
[14:00] &gt;&gt; They like to see it. The Bible said a
[14:02] wicked indulterous generation seeks
[14:04] after signs.
[14:07] But the commission was pray for the sick
[14:10] and tens of thousands times thousands
[14:13] that I failed to pray for because they
[14:16] all desired the sign they all desire.
[14:22] In closing, friends, hope this video was
[14:25] a blessing by the grace of God. Again, I
[14:27] want to thank my brother from Germany
[14:29] for that wonderful thought about the
[14:31] accusation about memorizing prayer cards
[14:33] cannot stand because brother Random gave
[14:35] so many details through the visions. God
[14:37] gave him so many details that would not
[14:39] fit on prayer cards. So, praise the Lord
[14:42] for God sending his prophet, brother
[14:45] William Brandham, to fulfill the
[14:47] scriptures. Revelation 10:7, finishing
[14:49] the mystery of God. Malachi 45 and 6,
[14:52] turning our hearts back to the apostolic
[14:54] fathers. Matthew 17:11, restoring all
[14:57] things. Luke 17:30,
[15:00] a son of man, a prophet, revealing the
[15:03] son of man, the Lord Jesus Christ. Just
[15:05] like every prophet was revealing the
[15:07] Lord Jesus Christ through their
[15:09] discernment, through their prophecy, the
[15:11] spirit of Jesus Christ is the spirit of
[15:13] prophecy. We thank God for an honest
[15:15] prophet, a genuine prophet, a Holy
[15:18] Ghostfilled prophet like William Mary
[15:20] and Brandham. And it is an absolute joy
[15:22] to follow this Bible message that God
[15:26] gave to brother Brandham. I heard a
[15:27] preacher say it recently. It was so
[15:28] beautiful. He was noticing the
[15:30] difference between Joseph Smith and
[15:32] brother Brandham. He said, "Joseph Smith
[15:34] met an angel and added books to the
[15:36] Bible, which is a sin." But William
[15:38] Brham met an angel and revealed the
[15:42] Bible itself. Not adding anything to the
[15:44] Bible, not taking anything away, just
[15:47] revealing the truths already contained
[15:50] in the scripture. Thank God for a
[15:52] genuine prophet of God, William Marin
[15:54] and Brandham. Friends, if you're not
[15:56] saved and assured you're going to
[15:57] heaven, you need to repent of your sins,
[16:00] confess all your sins to the Lord Jesus
[16:01] Christ, and then call upon his name, be
[16:04] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[16:06] Christ. That's called salvation. That's
[16:08] called justification.
[16:10] You're declared righteous. You've
[16:12] accepted Jesus forgiveness for your
[16:14] sins. He became cursed so you might
[16:17] receive the righteousness of Christ. You
[16:19] might be blessed. Your faith is in the
[16:21] blood of Jesus Christ. Then the Holy
[16:23] Spirit will come into your human spirit,
[16:26] sanctify you, purify you, clean you out,
[16:29] give you a new spirit. He saves you and
[16:31] gives you a new heart. And then he
[16:33] sanctifies you, gives you a new spirit.
[16:34] And then some glorious day, he'll fill
[16:36] your soul with the baptism of the Holy
[16:39] Ghost. Your soul will be immersed with
[16:41] the spirit of God. You'll be able to say
[16:43] amen to every word of God. And then
[16:46] you'll have power to be a witness unto
[16:49] Jerusalem, Judea, the uttermost parts of
[16:51] the earth, to Akran, Ohio, to the city
[16:54] in which God has called you to be a
[16:56] witness of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[16:59] If you have any questions, concerns, or
[17:00] testimonies about this video, please
[17:02] contact me.
[17:04] God bless you, and may Jesus Christ be
[17:06] the desire of your heart.
[17:09] very happy to be here this afternoon and
[17:11] again in defense of the gospel of Jesus
