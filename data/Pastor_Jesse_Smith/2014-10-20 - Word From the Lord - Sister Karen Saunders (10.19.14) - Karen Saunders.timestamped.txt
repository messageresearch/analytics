[0:11] you about
[0:13] and you lived
[0:14] when uh brother camp brother simon
[0:17] and sister beth i stay with them when i
[0:19] come up here normally i did stay at your
[0:20] house one time
[0:22] but when we were having meetings at
[0:23] their house
[0:25] i had talked to you about something
[0:28] god don't you don't have no respect for
[0:30] a person
[0:31] and he brought a message through you
[0:34] that liked to kill me
[0:37] but it hurt me
[0:39] and he taught me that things that hurt
[0:42] instruct amen
[0:46] and so god bless you and
[0:49] i this is a this is a good testimony
[0:54] for me
[0:55] to show you how god in the real small
[0:57] things of our lives everything matters
[1:01] i asked god if i could give
[1:04] brother dave luella
[1:07] you know
[1:09] one of those
[1:10] books i wanted to give him from my heart
[1:14] and i said lord
[1:16] i want to have more you let me give them
[1:19] so when i got here
[1:22] and things started moving around where
[1:23] the craig brought one up and i saw
[1:26] brother dave walking around with the
[1:27] book
[1:29] and i said lord
[1:30] how did you get that book
[1:32] i said well i asked you for good luck
[1:36] i said lord please
[1:38] take it back
[1:52] he said he said brother craig
[1:55] had given it to him and then a little
[1:57] later
[1:58] i found out through him and i said oh do
[2:01] you do you have a book
[2:03] he said well no sister he said
[2:05] you know what happened i said what he
[2:07] said brother craig actually brought up
[2:09] her brother jesse
[2:10] he said but he gave it to me and he gave
[2:13] it to somebody and he gave it his
[2:15] brother
[2:17] for
[2:18] him and then
[2:20] the wrong person got it and he said and
[2:23] i said lord you don't give it back and
[2:24] they had to give it back and give it to
[2:26] the right person
[2:27] so last yesterday over to sister
[2:30] bessie's name i said so for the dave do
[2:32] you have a book he said
[2:34] well no not really he said but i'll give
[2:37] one i thought you know
[2:43] he said here's what happened it went
[2:44] through the wrong channels he said and
[2:46] what happened he said that so i gave it
[2:48] back
[2:52] friday night
[2:55] these messages were dangerous
[2:57] i know that
[2:59] i know that i don't have to think about
[3:01] it i don't have to you know i know it i
[3:04] know it in my own life i know my own
[3:05] heart
[3:06] the message that came friday night was
[3:08] so compelling
[3:10] by saturday
[3:12] i got here i was sweeping and crying
[3:15] in my
[3:16] heart and i thought oh lord
[3:18] so the lord left with me and i think
[3:20] some of you saw me approach sister beth
[3:21] now sister beth
[3:23] and brother side didn't do anything i
[3:25] had to go to them and apologize
[3:27] but the lord dealt with my heart and he
[3:29] showed me that i i didn't repent
[3:32] that these meetings they would not go to
[3:35] spirit because one person would have
[3:37] stopped everything
[3:39] and so i had to get that out of my life
[3:40] because i didn't want to stop god
[3:44] in your life
[3:46] and so when god brought the message
[3:48] today
[3:49] and the blood of the spirit began to
[3:51] move
[3:52] i knew that obedience
[3:54] it always is the right thing to do yay
[3:57] my people i would say unto thee this day
[4:01] i the lord thy god have called these
[4:04] meetings yea i will speak to your heart
[4:07] today
[4:08] yay i have caused you to have a great
[4:11] time in my spirit but yes said the lord
[4:15] now i shall bring thee a warning said
[4:18] the lord yea saith the lord
[4:21] you must repent
[4:23] except ye repent saith the lord you will
[4:27] not make it i will cause you said the
[4:30] lord to stand in stagnant waters and
[4:33] thou will not move until i have spoken
[4:37] yes said the lord search thy heart
[4:41] search thy soul repent
[4:43] run to the altar said the lord for the
[4:45] hour is late for the time is at hand and
[4:49] yes said the lord hear my voice just say
[4:52] think not of the flesh but thank you the
[4:54] living god yes saith the lord for i am
[4:57] with thee i am with thee in repentance
[5:00] if thou not repent surely i shall leave
[5:04] the lord
