[0:13] to either follow the word of God
[0:18] who will lose extreme
[0:22] to believe every word that you say to be
[0:25] true but
[0:27] they do believe that their own actions
[0:29] prove that they don't
[0:31] I can't interpret his word
[0:37] not Machinery mechanical devices
[0:42] greetings friends in the mattress name
[0:44] of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of
[0:47] this video is to continue the series
[0:49] showing the 24 plus Lies coming out of
[0:52] Branham Tabernacle located in
[0:54] Jeffersonville Indiana USA
[0:57] today by God's grace we'll cover the
[0:59] 11th and 12th lies but before that I
[1:03] just want to address a few comments I've
[1:05] received on these YouTube videos overall
[1:08] the videos have been well received and
[1:10] I'm grateful for that I'm thankful for
[1:12] that there's just been a few people that
[1:15] feel I shouldn't make these videos so
[1:17] let me address that just briefly I want
[1:19] to remind everyone that I privately
[1:21] contacted leadership at Brenham
[1:23] Tabernacle about four years ago about
[1:25] these issues and they failed to repent
[1:27] and then I kept contacting them via
[1:30] email over the last three or four years
[1:32] and they fail to repent and then friends
[1:34] the number of Lies continued to grow and
[1:37] it grew so large that I felt like I
[1:39] needed to share some of these lies
[1:40] publicly I just thought I would share
[1:42] all of random Tabernacles lies publicly
[1:44] because they influence so many people
[1:46] and because brother Branham did the same
[1:49] thing yes brother Branham himself
[1:51] publicly rebuked the deity spirit that
[1:55] was making him Jesus Christ
[1:57] and friends I know Brenham Tabernacle is
[1:59] not calling William Branham Jesus Christ
[2:01] but in effect they're doing the same
[2:04] thing in the sermon Revelation chapter 5
[2:06] part 1 from June 11 1961 brother Brandon
[2:10] Begins the sermon in a shocking way
[2:12] saying that he's leaving the field and
[2:14] that he'll probably only minister in
[2:16] Jeffersonville because there was a group
[2:18] of Brethren that were baptizing in the
[2:20] name of William Branham and saying that
[2:21] William Branham was Jesus Christ brother
[2:24] random said quote it's a spirit on
[2:25] precious people end quote he hoped that
[2:28] it would receive a deadly wound and die
[2:30] out quickly now according to brother
[2:31] Branham the brothers repented of this
[2:33] Spirit shortly thereafter the sermon but
[2:37] then we know this Spirit became more
[2:38] deceptive and instead of calling William
[2:41] Branham Jesus Christ this evil spirit
[2:43] made every word of William Branham thus
[2:46] saith the Lord in other words every word
[2:48] of William Branham was infallible well
[2:51] that's the same as the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:52] every word the Lord Jesus Christ said
[2:54] was and is infallible so the spirit just
[2:58] became more deceptive this evil
[3:00] Antichrist Spirit brother random calls
[3:02] it he also said he saw a vision of it
[3:04] and it was like a serpent
[3:06] and so this evil spirit never died it
[3:08] just changed its form and then a few
[3:10] years after brother random died the
[3:12] spirit Came Upon Branham Tabernacle and
[3:14] removed Ormond Neville as pastor and
[3:16] then went to a series of pastors who
[3:19] basically idolized every word on tape of
[3:21] brother Branham of course it continues
[3:23] today and just seems to get worse with
[3:25] each passing year so that's my answer to
[3:28] people that would say why are you
[3:29] publicly addressing Brenham tabernacle's
[3:31] lies well my answer is because brother
[3:33] Branham would address these type of evil
[3:37] spirits and he would do it publicly
[3:39] and Friends brother random said
[3:40] repeatedly that prophets make mistakes
[3:44] I could say I'm a man
[3:50] anything else they made their mistakes
[3:53] brother Ram said he was not infallible
[4:02] Ram said be careful how you're listening
[4:04] to differentiate between The Human Side
[4:06] versus the prophetic side
[4:08] see I've always asked you to be careful
[4:12] what you're listening to I think there's
[4:15] so much of it that it's just the human
[4:18] side but always if there is something
[4:21] that goes forth it will speak it it's
[4:24] thus saith the Lord
[4:27] and that's reason I say that now that
[4:29] there is any uh any prophecy concerning
[4:32] and I have nothing on it from the Lord
[4:36] I could be all together wrong am I
[4:38] thought about Martin Luther King I don't
[4:40] know I can't say if that's just my
[4:42] opinion
[4:44] Brother Brad said he made mistakes all
[4:47] the time on tape such as saying 700
[4:50] instead of 7 000 that did not bow the
[4:52] need to bail and of course all my videos
[4:54] have taught this over the last few years
[5:01] I'm
[5:06] another person asked me don't you think
[5:07] you're doing more harm than good by
[5:09] making these videos about
[5:10] jeffersonville's lies I think the answer
[5:13] is no I think I'm doing more good than
[5:15] harm I don't think I'm doing any harm at
[5:17] all
[5:18] because if you read First Corinthians 13
[5:20] the Bible says charity rejoices in the
[5:22] truth and charity is the Holy Ghost so
[5:25] the spirit of Truth is the Holy Ghost
[5:27] anyone who has the spirit of Truth in
[5:29] their soul they're born again will
[5:30] rejoice in these videos that expose
[5:32] Satan's lies and friends it's a shame
[5:35] some people think it does damage to
[5:38] expose false preachers and false
[5:40] prophets yet the Bible plainly tells us
[5:43] to rebuke them that sin and to Mark
[5:45] those who cause divisions and avoid them
[5:48] and there's numerous other Bible
[5:49] scriptures that tell us to rebuke and
[5:52] correct false teachers and false
[5:54] prophets and so I asked one person on a
[5:56] comment I said do you think it's good to
[5:59] not say anything about a preacher or
[6:01] Pastor spreading over 24 lies from his
[6:05] pulpit and then even more lies from his
[6:07] blog post you think it's better just to
[6:10] let those lies go out and have no voice
[6:12] that's going to correct it of course the
[6:15] answer is no we should correct lies that
[6:17] preachers are telling and just like
[6:20] brother Branham said love is corrective
[6:22] so if we have the real genuine love of
[6:23] Jesus Christ we'll correct our brothers
[6:25] by the grace of God sometimes privately
[6:28] sometimes publicly brother Branham
[6:30] publicly corrected numerous people and
[6:32] so if brother Brown was led by the Holy
[6:34] Ghost to correct people publicly in
[6:36] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[6:38] and forever then the spirit of God will
[6:40] do that at times today as well
[6:42] there's no verse that says only prophets
[6:44] can correct people and the bibles are
[6:46] absolute as brother random said the
[6:48] Bible was his absolute Paul told Timothy
[6:50] to rebuke them that sin before all Paul
[6:53] told Timothy to rightly divide the word
[6:55] of Truth and so Timothy was likely just
[6:57] a local pastor and so the prophet was
[7:00] telling the local pastors to correct
[7:02] these lies and to stand upon the truth
[7:04] so that's what we're doing today by
[7:06] God's grace and we'll continue to do it
[7:07] as the Lord gives us inspiration and
[7:09] Grace
[7:10] so now review the first 10 lies before
[7:13] we get into the 11th and 12th lie lie
[7:15] number one is every word on tape is thus
[7:17] saith the Lord plus the tapes can never
[7:19] be wrong plus the tapes have no mistakes
[7:21] plus the tapes have every answer the
[7:24] second lie is all answers are on the
[7:27] tapes
[7:28] the third lie is to unquestionably
[7:30] believe every word on tape is thus safe
[7:33] is thus say the Lord even if brother
[7:34] Branham lied
[7:36] the fourth lie is
[7:38] a false vision
[7:40] of a denominational mandate to play the
[7:42] tapes and every church is a tape Church
[7:45] the fifth lies that the tapes are the
[7:47] token and being a part of a tape church
[7:50] is the token
[7:52] the six lies that tape boys are the true
[7:54] faithful Ministry and tapes are number
[7:56] one in the fivefold ministry
[7:59] the seventh lies that brother random
[8:01] spirit and soul are are identical to
[8:04] Jesus Christ's spirit and soul
[8:07] the eighth lie is that brother Branham
[8:09] still has a living Ministry and anyone
[8:11] that doesn't believe that is equivalent
[8:13] to Demas
[8:16] the ninth lie is that revelation 22
[8:18] verse 16 is Jesus telling us all to be
[8:22] taped churches as the perfect will of
[8:24] God
[8:25] and the tenth lie is that the angel of
[8:28] revelation 22 verses 6 through 9 and
[8:31] verse 16 is brother Branham
[8:34] now moving on to the 11th lie the
[8:37] eleventh lie is closely related to the
[8:38] first lie random tabernacle's leadership
[8:40] said the tapes are the absolute and I
[8:43] have three evidences of this false
[8:46] Doctrine before I go through those three
[8:48] evidences remember I just want to
[8:50] reference I made a video directly on
[8:52] this topic so if you like more quotes
[8:54] from Brother Branham on this topic watch
[8:56] the video called William branham's
[8:57] absolute was Jesus Christ not his tapes
[9:00] it's my 73rd video
[9:04] so there will be some overlap with this
[9:06] video and the 73rd video
[9:08] so the first evidence is audio of
[9:11] Branham tabernacle's leadership saying
[9:13] they believe every word on tape is thus
[9:15] saith the Lord because the tapes are
[9:18] their absolute let's listen to the audio
[9:20] of this lie
[9:26] [Music]
[9:34] brother Minister brother had spoken to
[9:36] you
[9:40] about speaking about myself
[9:43] he said that you have to realize
[9:47] [Applause]
[9:47] [Music]
[9:50] everything that broke around
[9:57] [Music]
[9:59] amen
[10:00] I believe everything man says
[10:08] [Music]
[10:10] to be my
[10:11] absolutely
[10:19] now that we've heard this lie we must
[10:22] Define the word absolute as brother
[10:23] Branham did Brother Branham used a
[10:25] Webster's dictionary to define the word
[10:27] absolute and brother Ram said absolute
[10:29] means Unlimited in power
[10:38] it's perfect in itself
[10:41] Unlimited in its power
[10:43] we are nearly an ultimate
[10:51] so Branham Tabernacle is saying the
[10:53] tapes are Unlimited in power every word
[10:56] on tape is Unlimited in its power
[10:58] and this is a complete contradiction to
[11:00] what brother Brando said brother Ram
[11:02] said quote I have no power within myself
[11:04] to do anything
[11:06] end quote and he said quote I don't have
[11:08] power you don't have any power none of
[11:10] us does end quote
[11:14] the son of God
[11:16] myself
[11:22] I have power to stop you I am tired to
[11:27] make any of these women clean up but in
[11:29] this man just listen to this paper or
[11:31] whatever it is
[11:35] I'm careless
[11:37] but I do have the authority of God's
[11:39] word
[11:42] if I had power to heal anybody I
[11:45] certainly would do it
[11:47] I sure would
[11:48] I know what it means to be sick I have
[11:51] no power to heal no other man does if he
[11:54] does then what happened to Calvary
[11:58] so these two simple quotes prove brother
[12:01] Ram's words cannot be the absolute
[12:03] because by definition the absolute means
[12:05] Unlimited in power
[12:07] friends we all know there's only one
[12:08] person Unlimited in power and that's the
[12:10] Lord Jesus Christ
[12:12] so the Lord Jesus Christ is the absolute
[12:14] and the absolute appears in two forms
[12:17] the first form is Jesus's spiritual
[12:19] theophany that he's in right now and
[12:22] that theophany can also change his form
[12:24] and be the Holy Ghost in our church
[12:26] services in our lives in our souls
[12:28] that's one form of the absolute and the
[12:31] other form of the absolute is the Holy
[12:32] Bible as brother Branham said it's the
[12:34] absolute record it's the record that's
[12:36] Unlimited in power Unlimited in truth
[12:39] it's the Judgment standard it's the word
[12:42] of God that contains the mysteries of
[12:43] God the revelation of God it's the mind
[12:45] of God on paper and that's another form
[12:47] of the absolute as brother Ram said his
[12:50] absolute is the word of God is the Holy
[12:53] Bible
[12:54] so this simple definition of the
[12:56] absolute proves Brenham tabernacle's
[12:58] leadership as a spirit of idolatry
[13:00] anointing them they idolize the tapes
[13:04] of course this is ridiculous but it's
[13:06] also evidence of a strong spiritual
[13:08] delusion they've rejected the spirit of
[13:10] Truth and they have a spirit of a lie a
[13:13] spirit of error and this Spirit of error
[13:15] that they have on them is so apparent
[13:17] because they can't even answer five
[13:18] simple questions with a yes or no answer
[13:21] I've repeatedly emailed the people at
[13:24] vog and Branham Tabernacle these five
[13:26] simple questions and they will never
[13:27] respond they will not give me a yes or
[13:29] no answer
[13:30] because if they did they would
[13:32] contradict the statements of brother
[13:34] Branham on tape for example if number
[13:37] one is Billy Paul that promised Joseph
[13:39] or not brother Branham said he was in
[13:41] 1951 but they won't answer that because
[13:44] if they say yes well then Joseph is in
[13:46] the promise Joseph
[13:48] if they say no then they deny brother
[13:49] Ram's quote so they're trapped in a
[13:52] corner like brother Ram said that's what
[13:54] the Holy Spirit does it puts Satan in a
[13:55] corner and then Satan can't get out of
[13:57] the corner so this Antichrist Spirit
[13:59] won't answer yes or no it'll just avoid
[14:01] the question
[14:02] and yet the Bible says in First Peter 3
[14:04] 15 that we should always have an answer
[14:06] ready of the hope that's within us so
[14:08] thankfully by the grace of God the true
[14:10] five-fold Ministry preachers who are
[14:12] anointed with the true Holy Ghost can
[14:14] answer this question and the answer is
[14:16] no Billy Paul was not the promise Joseph
[14:18] Joseph Branham was a promise Joseph
[14:21] other brand I had to grow in his
[14:22] understanding of the prophecy that God
[14:24] gave to him about his second and final
[14:26] son
[14:28] second question does the third person of
[14:30] the Trinity burn in your heart yes or no
[14:32] brother random said in 1952 the third
[14:35] person of the Trinity burned in his
[14:36] heart and the believer's hearts I asked
[14:39] this question to the pastor Branham
[14:40] Tabernacle and he didn't say yes or no
[14:42] he just said I believe every word on
[14:44] tape
[14:49] so again because of the spirit of
[14:51] idolatry that they have on them they
[14:53] can't say yes or no if they say yes then
[14:56] they're a trinitarian and brother
[14:57] Branham said trinitarianism is of the
[14:58] devil if they say no then they have to
[15:00] deny this quote from brother Brandon
[15:02] from 1952 and say it's not inspired well
[15:05] what's the truth the truth is brother
[15:06] random at first believed in the Trinity
[15:07] but then he grew to understanding God
[15:10] showed them the Revelation that God is
[15:12] only one person
[15:13] so he was wrong in 1952 and God gave him
[15:17] greater understanding and then he
[15:18] corrected it later on in his ministry
[15:20] the third question is does brother
[15:22] random have anything to do with the
[15:23] seventh Church age messenger or not yes
[15:25] or no and they won't answer this
[15:26] question in 1961 brother random said
[15:29] quote
[15:30] I'm going to be as honest as I can be I
[15:32] don't think I'd have anything to do with
[15:33] that messenger end quote so if they say
[15:36] yes
[15:37] brother RAM does have something to do
[15:39] with the seven Church age messenger and
[15:41] they go against this quote they
[15:42] contradict brother Branham if they say
[15:44] no
[15:45] then they're saying they don't believe
[15:47] brother Branham was the seventh Church
[15:48] A's messenger
[15:49] so again the devil is trapped in a
[15:51] corner and they can't say yes or no it
[15:53] reminds us that the Pharisees in math in
[15:56] Mark 11 when they asked Jesus about his
[15:58] authority Jesus asked them to answer a
[16:00] question first before he would answer
[16:02] their question and he asked him about
[16:03] John the Baptist the baptism of John was
[16:06] it from heaven or of men answer me and
[16:08] of course they wouldn't answer that's
[16:10] just like Branham Tabernacle and vog
[16:12] today they just won't answer these
[16:14] questions
[16:15] think how sad it is that Branham
[16:17] Tabernacle can't tell whether Billy Paul
[16:20] or Joseph is the promise Joseph they
[16:22] can't tell whether the third person
[16:24] Burns in their heart or not they can't
[16:26] tell whether brother Branham has
[16:27] anything to do with the seven churches
[16:29] messenger or not
[16:31] a fourth question is did Arizona have
[16:33] another generation after 1965 yes or no
[16:36] brother Branch said quote we can't have
[16:38] another generation end quote in God's
[16:40] provided place of worship
[16:42] the real answer is yes Arizona did have
[16:45] another generation
[16:46] and the fifth and final question is did
[16:48] Rebecca in Genesis chapter 24 marry a
[16:50] woman yes or no
[16:52] brother Ram said Rebecca married quote
[16:54] her bride end quote brother random said
[16:57] it on numerous occasions of course it
[16:58] was just a slip of the tongue but random
[17:00] Tabernacle leaders can't answer the
[17:02] question did Rebecca marry a woman or
[17:04] not in Genesis chapter 24 they can't
[17:06] answer it of course the answer is no
[17:08] Rebecca married Isaac a man
[17:10] but they can't admit that because they
[17:12] worship every word on the tape they have
[17:14] the spirit of idolatry
[17:16] and Friends remember that 73rd video I
[17:18] made in that video I have quotes for
[17:20] brother William said the absolute is a
[17:22] person
[17:22] so the tapes are not a person the tapes
[17:25] cannot be the absolute
[17:26] well the ram said there's only one
[17:28] absolute not 1 180 plus sermons are the
[17:32] absolute there's only one absolute
[17:34] and brother random said there is no
[17:35] other absolute
[17:37] so it's a person it's one person so it
[17:40] cannot be tapes
[17:41] Amber the ram said the absolute is
[17:43] always Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ is
[17:45] not a tape friends remember brother
[17:47] random never said the tapes were the
[17:50] absolute brother Brandon said quote God
[17:52] is the absolute end quote and God is not
[17:55] a set of tapes
[18:00] foreign
[18:04] amazing
[18:07] Christianity
[18:09] arguments the Bible said so
[18:12] makes it right
[18:14] yes sir
[18:15] before moving on just remember a few of
[18:18] these statements brother Branham said
[18:19] about the absolute I'm going to go
[18:21] through these kind of quickly but he
[18:22] said the absolute was the person of
[18:23] Jesus Christ he said any christ-centered
[18:26] life is the absolute a christ-centered
[18:28] call is the absolute Christ is the
[18:31] absolute Jesus Christ is the absolute
[18:33] and then he said the word the Bible is
[18:35] the absolute Christ's word is the
[18:37] absolute God's absolute is the word well
[18:40] the ram said quote that word end quote
[18:42] is the absolute well Ram said the word
[18:44] of God and the word of the Living God is
[18:47] the absolute and then he said the new
[18:49] birth is the absolute
[18:51] and he said fill with the Holy Ghost
[18:52] that's your absolute and then he said
[18:54] it's the same absolute the same Pillar
[18:56] of Fire
[18:57] friends anyone who can't see what the
[18:59] absolute is is deceived and they're in
[19:01] danger of not being the elect the Bible
[19:03] said the elect cannot be deceived now of
[19:06] course every elect child will wake up
[19:08] from their spiritual blindness and put
[19:10] the I Salvo the anointing of the Holy
[19:12] Ghost on their eyes and be able to see
[19:14] the truth and recognize the truth that
[19:16] Jesus Christ his Bible and his own
[19:19] spiritual person are the two forms of
[19:22] the one absolute God is the absolute and
[19:25] his character is expressed to us in the
[19:26] written form of the Bible
[19:28] the second evidence is a letter from
[19:30] Branham tabernacle's leadership and
[19:33] friends I have the letter right here
[19:34] I'll probably show a few screenshots of
[19:36] it on the video here but the leadership
[19:38] at Branham Tabernacle said quote
[19:40] it must be all or nothing I have to
[19:43] believe that everything on tape is thus
[19:44] say the Lord and the absolute the token
[19:47] for our day and I must unquestioning
[19:48] believe every word of brother random on
[19:50] tape end quote
[19:53] this is a sad delusional statement
[19:56] brother Branham never made all of his
[19:59] words All or Nothing
[20:01] brother Ram never said all my words are
[20:03] thus saith the Lord in fact there's many
[20:05] quotes for brother bam says this is not
[20:06] the Lord saying this brother bran
[20:08] literally said be careful what you're
[20:10] listening to like in he cares you care
[20:13] in 1963. again brother Ram never set his
[20:15] tapes for the absolute nor was every
[20:18] word on tape the absolute brother
[20:20] Brandon never said my tapes are the
[20:22] token brother random never said believe
[20:24] my every word unquestionably and I have
[20:27] an entire video about brother Branham
[20:29] welcoming correction
[20:31] another man was corrected by the angel
[20:32] of the Lord by his wife by brother
[20:35] sharet
[20:36] my brother Brandon wanted ministers who
[20:38] are theologians sitting on the platform
[20:40] with him to correct him if he was wrong
[20:46] theologians behind me and uh maybe
[20:50] they'll correct me when I'm wrong but I
[20:54] hope so
[20:57] brother Branham said I'm not infallible
[21:00] I'm your brother
[21:02] and friends if Brandon tabernacle's
[21:04] leadership believes every word on tape
[21:06] is thus say the Lord and the tapes have
[21:07] all the answers then why won't the
[21:10] leaders and their workers answer my five
[21:12] simple questions because the tapes have
[21:14] all the answers
[21:15] the fact is they're deceived and so they
[21:17] cannot answer the questions just like
[21:19] the Pharisees
[21:20] and Fifth and finally is a blog post
[21:22] from Branham tabernacle's website from
[21:24] October 22nd 2022 the blog post says
[21:28] quote do you think brother Branham and
[21:29] or his tapes are the absolute brother
[21:31] random is not my absolute but the
[21:33] message he spoke on tape is absolutely
[21:35] my absolute many people say that is
[21:38] incorrect the Bible's the absolute my
[21:41] friend the Bible and the message on tape
[21:43] are the same thing that is the very
[21:45] essence of the message the message on
[21:48] tapes is the interpretation of the Bible
[21:50] they are one in the same end quote
[21:53] of course friends this is a delusional
[21:55] statement
[21:56] the Bible and the tapes are not the same
[21:58] like brother random said the tapes point
[22:01] us to the Bible because the Bible is the
[22:03] absolute
[22:09] that's where we point to Jesus Christ
[22:11] the son of God grant that he'll be so
[22:14] real to everyone here today even to the
[22:16] little children that he'll become the
[22:18] absolute of the entire congregation we
[22:22] asked in Jesus name amen
[22:25] there's numerous quotes where a few
[22:27] different people tried to tell brother
[22:29] Branham that his sermons could be
[22:31] Revelation chapter 23 and brother Ram
[22:33] said no you can't do that because you
[22:36] can't add one word or take one word away
[22:38] from the Bible because the Bible was the
[22:40] absolute and revelation 22 verses 18 and
[22:43] 19 warns us we cannot add to the Bible
[22:45] or take away from the Bible
[22:47] so Branham tabernacle's leadership has
[22:49] this deity spirit this idolatrous Spirit
[22:52] on them where they want to idolize
[22:54] everything on the tapes
[22:56] friends it's an easy fact to prove that
[22:59] the tapes are not the same as the Bible
[23:00] there are so many things on tape that
[23:02] are not in the Bible
[23:04] for example the Bible doesn't say total
[23:06] Annihilation will come to the United
[23:07] States and the world before 1977. the
[23:11] Bible never says that the Bible never
[23:13] says women have sperm like brother
[23:14] random said in 1965. and Friends there's
[23:17] over 80 more examples of things brother
[23:19] Branham said that were not in the Bible
[23:20] and things that he said that were just
[23:22] mistakes human mistakes yet he's still a
[23:25] prophet of God
[23:26] here's a quote where other Brandon said
[23:28] God will never add one word to the Bible
[23:29] so brother Ram's tapes cannot be the
[23:32] same thing as the Bible let's listen to
[23:34] the quote
[23:42] you never add one word or take one word
[23:44] away from it from it you'll stay exactly
[23:47] on that
[23:48] you'll never leave that Bible
[23:52] here's a quote from the unveiling of God
[23:54] 1964 where someone tried to catch
[23:56] brother Branham saying that brother
[23:58] branham's word could write a Bible but
[24:00] brother random picked up on that deity
[24:02] spirit and said you can't do that
[24:04] because the Bible cannot be added to nor
[24:06] taken away from let's listen to the
[24:08] quote
[24:09] is always
[24:15] write it not
[24:28] he said
[24:30] say that you read it not see these seven
[24:33] Thunders under their voices see and he
[24:36] said don't write that
[24:37] see but it's be sealed up in the boat
[24:40] until the last days
[24:46] if the Lord God said if if with your
[24:49] experience that the Lord has given you
[24:51] for his people humbly seeing this said
[24:54] you'd be eligible to add up a Bible
[24:56] yourself you're aware of God is
[24:58] manifested I said that might be true see
[25:01] he's trying to catch me
[25:08] one word cannot be added or taken away
[25:16] I said no sir it would be adding
[25:18] something to her taking something that's
[25:19] all revealed in there and the Seven
[25:21] Seals opened up the Revelation what that
[25:23] was
[25:29] still never leave that word it'll stay
[25:32] right with the word blinding Simon Open
[25:34] the Eyes they will always do that
[25:37] and notice friends random tabernacle's
[25:40] leadership uses the word essence just
[25:42] like the trinitarians use the word
[25:45] essence to say well there's one God but
[25:47] in essence he's three persons or three
[25:50] persons have the same Essence but it's
[25:52] still one God whose three persons
[25:55] so they use this word essence to try to
[25:57] make two things the same that are not
[25:59] the same the tapes are not the same as
[26:01] the Bible just like three individual
[26:03] persons co-equal persons are not the
[26:06] same as one person so I think it's
[26:08] fitting that Brenham Tabernacle is using
[26:10] the same word a Catholic uses in order
[26:13] to convince people of a false Doctrine
[26:14] because that's what they're doing
[26:15] they're using the word essence to make
[26:18] the tapes and the Bible the same just
[26:19] like trinitarians are using the word
[26:20] essence to make three persons the same
[26:22] as one person
[26:24] on this October 22nd 2022 blog post
[26:27] Brenham Tabernacle leadership goes on to
[26:29] say quote the simple fact is number one
[26:31] the Bible is the word number two the
[26:33] word comes the prophet and number three
[26:35] the prophet is the only Divine
[26:37] interpreter the word end quote
[26:39] now friends I believe the Bible's plain
[26:42] that prophets give the revelation of the
[26:44] word the Bible says numerous times that
[26:46] the word of the Lord comes to the
[26:48] prophet but Branham Tabernacle
[26:50] leadership is contradicting other quotes
[26:52] from Brother Branham where brother
[26:54] Branham says he can't interpret God's
[26:56] word so Branham to Tabernacle says
[26:58] brother Branham is the only one who
[26:59] interpret God's word but then brother
[27:00] Brown says I can't interpret God's word
[27:02] so who's right of course the Bible's
[27:05] right
[27:05] the truth is profits can only interpret
[27:08] the word of God that God sends to them
[27:10] prophets can only interpret what God
[27:12] lets them interpret but let's first
[27:14] listen to this quote from 1964 where
[27:16] brother Branham says God don't need any
[27:18] interpreter I can't interpret his word
[27:20] neither can anybody interpret his word
[27:22] end quote let's listen to the quote
[27:31] [Music]
[27:41] that settles it
[27:43] 'll tell this event
[27:45] he does it himself
[27:48] now friends in context brother randoms
[27:50] right no man with his own ability can
[27:52] interpret the word of God
[27:54] but God will share the interpretation
[27:56] with a prophet and then the prophet will
[27:58] make it known to the people so this
[28:00] statement is true from Brother Branham I
[28:01] can't interpret his word nobody can
[28:04] prophets have to wait on God for any
[28:06] interpretation and then the prophet
[28:08] receives God's interpretation and shares
[28:10] that with the people
[28:11] now what's interesting is eight days
[28:13] later after brother Ram said he can't
[28:15] interpret the word he said the
[28:17] characteristic of a prophet is that he
[28:19] can interpret the word so first glance
[28:21] these two quotes look like they
[28:22] contradict each other but they don't
[28:24] when you really think about it deeply
[28:26] like brother Ram told us we got to think
[28:27] really deeply on subjects or else we're
[28:29] going to get deceived the truth is a
[28:32] prophet cannot interpret the word by
[28:34] himself he needs God the prophet needs
[28:37] God to interpret the word share it with
[28:39] him and then the prophet shares God's
[28:40] interpretation with the people
[28:43] the other quotes have to be true too
[28:44] where God doesn't need any
[28:46] interpretation to his word
[28:48] so in summary I think all these quotes
[28:50] from brother Brandon and these
[28:51] scriptures from the Bible prove that
[28:53] brother Ram's tapes are not the absolute
[28:55] the Bible is the absolute Jesus Christ
[28:57] is the absolute it's a shame Branham
[29:00] Tabernacle doesn't have the same
[29:01] absolute as brother Branham the man that
[29:04] their Tabernacle is named after
[29:06] the 12th lie is that make Believers and
[29:10] unbelievers will not play tapes
[29:13] primarily in their worship services
[29:17] here's audio from Bradham tabernacle's
[29:19] leadership saying the make-believer
[29:21] doesn't know whether or not they should
[29:22] play tapes or preach the gospel
[29:25] let's listen to this live
[29:29] [Music]
[29:38] is the truth you know that that's the
[29:41] believer
[29:43] unbeliever you guys are nice man I mean
[29:46] you're talking about this God God
[29:48] inflation lived in place
[29:51] the unbeliever the make-believer said
[29:54] man I don't know
[29:57] I don't want to play in the tapes is
[29:58] really right or not it could be I don't
[30:02] know my pastor says if I play tapes in
[30:05] church if we listen to them I'm just a
[30:06] lazy Pat
[30:07] and make believe
[30:10] look it's the worm
[30:13] it's the word that's that one she don't
[30:15] know if you don't know I don't know
[30:17] maybe it is maybe it's right maybe it's
[30:19] not
[30:25] my friends previously I showed the LIE
[30:28] where Branham Tabernacle leadership
[30:30] called anyone a Demas who didn't believe
[30:33] brother random still had a live Ministry
[30:34] that brother Branham wasn't dead so now
[30:37] Branham Tabernacle leadership is doing a
[30:39] second instance of name calling first
[30:41] they called the fivefold ministry
[30:43] preachers Demas and now they're calling
[30:45] five full ministry preachers
[30:46] make-believers
[30:48] well it doesn't stop there on a July 10
[30:51] 2022 blog post random Tabernacle
[30:54] leadership said quote
[30:56] you've got to leave every Tittle and
[30:58] every jot and everything that's said in
[31:01] there it's got to be true if you say I
[31:03] don't believe that some is God some is
[31:05] man some of it is just hunting stories
[31:07] well then you're an unbeliever the
[31:09] believer don't question
[31:11] the believer believes it regardless of
[31:13] what it sounds like or what anybody else
[31:15] has got to say about it how impossible
[31:17] it seems to be we believe it end quote
[31:21] so now Branham Tabernacle leadership
[31:23] does a third instance of name calling so
[31:26] think about this Brenham Tabernacle is
[31:28] calling the men who are actually obeying
[31:30] Ephesians 4 verse 11 Freedom Tabernacles
[31:33] calling them Demas make-believers and
[31:36] unbelievers
[31:37] and Friends remember Satan is the
[31:39] accuser of the brother
[31:40] remember there are no quotes from
[31:42] brother Brandon where he says every word
[31:44] I say is from God well the brand never
[31:47] says every word on my tapes is thus
[31:49] saith the Lord renam Tabernacle is
[31:51] constantly saying things brother Graham
[31:53] did not say
[31:54] their slogan is press play and Obey but
[31:57] they completely contradict the slogan
[31:59] that they say they believe they won't
[32:02] obey the quotes or brother Branham says
[32:03] I won't always be your pastor where
[32:06] brother bran says be very careful what
[32:07] you're listening to where brother Ram
[32:09] says I make their mistakes all the time
[32:11] on tape where brother Ram said there's
[32:13] Mix-Ups on the tapes
[32:15] friends remember when Branham Tabernacle
[32:18] tells people they have to believe every
[32:20] word on the tape and it's all from God
[32:22] they're actually contradicting even more
[32:24] scripture like acts 17 11 where the
[32:26] bereans search the Scriptures Daily to
[32:28] prove whether the thing were from God
[32:31] that Paul was preaching and Branham
[32:33] Tabernacle also neglects first
[32:34] Thessalonians 5 21 prove all things and
[32:37] brother Brandon repeatedly said that
[32:39] prove me by the Bible test me by the
[32:41] word prove all things
[32:43] and also first John chapter 4 says try
[32:46] every spirit and second Timothy says
[32:48] rightly divide the word of Truth
[32:58] and I don't know
[33:02] I don't plan the tapes is really right
[33:03] or not it could be a
[33:12] kind of the make-believer
[33:16] every matter and feels a call of God
[33:20] upon his life get into the ministry
[33:22] start preaching we need them
[33:26] any man is called of God he's the preach
[33:29] the gospel how can
[33:31] evangelists continue on the field
[33:36] in this hour of course want to meet
[33:37] certainly
[33:39] by all means don't change the thing
[33:43] to bring up this
[33:45] [Applause]
[33:49] time
[33:53] [Applause]
[34:04] [Applause]
[34:08] and to be a minister
[34:10] please
[34:14] what is this
[34:46] in closing
[34:49] friends I hope this video has been a
[34:50] blessing I know I said some harsh things
[34:52] I said some very straightforward things
[34:54] but please know that I pray often for
[34:57] the people at Branham Tabernacle I pray
[34:59] for them to repent of all their lies
[35:02] there's over 24 lies and so each time I
[35:04] make these videos I pray for them and
[35:06] when I think of it at church I'll pray
[35:08] for them as well
[35:09] friends as Matthew Chapter 13 tells us
[35:12] this is Harvest Time all seeds must come
[35:15] to maturity and they'll reveal by their
[35:17] fruit either genuine fruit or corrupt
[35:20] fruit what kind of seed they are so
[35:22] let's pray for people to repent and
[35:24] manifest the true seed of God like First
[35:27] Peter 1 23 says Born Again of The
[35:30] Incorruptible seed the word of God and
[35:32] if you're born again of the word of God
[35:34] you won't deny the revelation of the
[35:36] word of God
[35:37] you will not worship brother Branham you
[35:39] will not idolize the tapes if you're
[35:41] really born again by the Holy Ghost
[35:43] if you have any questions concerns or
[35:45] testimonies about this video please
[35:47] contact me
[35:50] God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[35:53] the desire of your heart
