[0:03] And there's only one thing eternal.
[0:05] Satan's not eternal.
[0:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:07] &gt;&gt; No. Amen.
[0:08] &gt;&gt; He He becomes Satan. Hell is not
[0:11] eternal. Hell was created.
[0:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:13] &gt;&gt; It's not eternal.
[0:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:16] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[0:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[0:19] &gt;&gt; Greetings [music] friends in the
[0:20] matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[0:23] The purpose of this video is to look at
[0:24] a current event related to [music] the
[0:26] revelations that God revealed to his
[0:29] prophet, Brother William Brandham. This
[0:31] past week, a famous [music] evangelical
[0:34] named Kirk Cameron went on record saying
[0:37] he's not settled about hell and has
[0:41] asked for further discussion about hell
[0:42] to determine whether it is eternal or
[0:45] not. So this topic of course just piqu
[0:47] my interest as a end time message
[0:50] believer of the revelations that God
[0:52] revealed to William Brandham, God's true
[0:55] prophet. William Brandham taught that
[0:57] hell was not eternal
[1:00] as I have a few videos about this. So
[1:02] I'll leave links to those in the
[1:03] description so you can watch those.
[1:06] And so this week the evangelical
[1:08] Christian community mostly in America I
[1:10] would imagine or United States has been
[1:13] up in arms about Kirk Cameron. He's a
[1:15] famous former actor and he's open to the
[1:19] idea that hell is not eternal. And it's
[1:21] refreshing from my point of view to see
[1:24] Kirk Cameron being honest and it's sad
[1:26] to see his opponents attack him the way
[1:28] they do. Now, I don't support Kirk
[1:30] Cameron in any way. I did like a little
[1:34] bit of the work he did with the Way of
[1:35] the Master series, but that was a work
[1:38] mostly of justification because it
[1:40] reminded me of St. Paul in Athens in
[1:43] Acts chapter 17 where he's trying to
[1:44] convince sinners who are intellectual
[1:47] giants to accept the truth of the
[1:49] resurrection of Jesus Christ. I
[1:51] appreciate that work of justification.
[1:53] But of course, they did very little work
[1:55] on sanctification and very little work
[1:57] on the baptism of the Holy Ghost because
[1:59] if I'm not mistaken, they believe a
[2:01] person is filled with the Holy Ghost as
[2:03] soon as they believe the gospel. And of
[2:05] course, that's wrong. The Bible foretold
[2:07] it in Ezekiel 36. There's three works of
[2:09] grace. justification, sanctification,
[2:11] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Ezekiel
[2:13] called it a new heart, a new spirit, and
[2:16] then God's spirit. Jesus even breathed
[2:19] on his disciples who were already saved
[2:20] and ministered with him for over 3
[2:22] years. He breathed on them and said,
[2:23] "Receive the Holy Ghost. Go up to
[2:25] Jerusalem until you're endued with power
[2:27] from on high." So, the baptism of the
[2:29] Holy Ghost was more power for the
[2:31] believer in the soul. And Jesus is the
[2:34] one that originated the language of the
[2:36] baptism of the Holy Ghost in Acts 1:5.
[2:40] He said, "You shall be baptized with the
[2:42] Holy Ghost not many days hence." So,
[2:44] let's start with the videos here on Kirk
[2:47] Cameron. Just two short videos here by
[2:48] God's grace. The first video will show
[2:50] Kirk Cameron saying that he's open to
[2:54] believing that there's not a continual
[2:56] eternal torment. Here's the video.
[2:59] So my position as it stands today and
[3:02] again I'm I'm I'm I'm we're the beauty
[3:05] of this is that we're always learning
[3:06] and growing, right? So I'm open to new
[3:08] light. If you guys have a position that
[3:09] you can share with me, I will gladly
[3:11] change my mind. I used to hold the
[3:13] position of conscious eternal torment
[3:15] because that's just what I was taught by
[3:16] people that I love and trust. I've
[3:19] learned that there are other positions
[3:21] and a very robust argument can be made
[3:23] for conditionalism or annihilationism as
[3:26] Edward Fudge uh posits here and it it
[3:30] fits the character of God in my
[3:34] understanding more than the the
[3:37] conscious eternal torment position
[3:39] because it brings in the mercy of God
[3:42] together with the justice of God. It
[3:45] doesn't leave judgment out. It is just,
[3:47] but it also fits with the Old Testament
[3:51] picture of the fate of the wicked, which
[3:52] is to be uh destroyed. It is to die and
[3:55] it is to perish, not live forever in an
[3:58] eternal barbecue. And the classic verses
[4:01] that used to get me into eternal
[4:03] torment, you know, the punishment, uh,
[4:05] everlasting punishment, everlasting
[4:07] destruction, um, fits beautifully with a
[4:10] destruction, punishment, judgment that
[4:13] is irreversible and lasts forever. That
[4:15] is the eternalness of that punishment
[4:18] and that destruction. So that's where I
[4:20] am today.
[4:21] &gt;&gt; Now I want to play a video from Ray
[4:22] Comfort who worked with Kirk Cameron for
[4:24] over 10 years with Living Waters
[4:26] Ministries. And he said he talked to
[4:28] Kirk Cameron on the phone and Kirk
[4:30] Cameron clarified and said he's not
[4:33] settled on the issue and is asking for
[4:35] further discussion. So here's the video.
[4:39] Some of you are aware of the fact that
[4:40] Kirk recently shared his questions and
[4:42] developing thoughts about the biblical
[4:44] nature of hell and the fate of the
[4:46] wicked. On his show, his son asked him a
[4:48] question and Kirk gave his honest
[4:50] thoughts, indicating that he finds the
[4:52] view known as conditional mortality or
[4:54] annihilationism to be both compelling
[4:57] and possibly biblically supported. While
[5:00] it certainly seemed from some of the
[5:01] things Kirk said on his podcast that he
[5:04] was indicating that this is now his
[5:05] official view, when I spoke with him
[5:07] personally on the phone, he told me that
[5:09] while he believes the Bible appears to
[5:11] point in the direction of this view,
[5:13] he's not settled on the matter and has
[5:15] asked for further discussion. Now
[5:17] friends, hopefully Kirk Cameron will
[5:18] have the courage to stand upon the
[5:20] truth. I consider this topic of
[5:22] non-eternal hell a minor. Sort of like
[5:24] serpent seed. It's a minor, but it is
[5:26] more light that is shining for the
[5:29] believer to see in order to further
[5:31] illuminate the word of God. Like brother
[5:34] Ram said about the serpent seed we put
[5:35] out on a recent video that it just
[5:38] shines more light on the truth that
[5:39] we're all trying to see. Of course, we
[5:42] realize that that doesn't save a man.
[5:44] Neither does it condemn a man. But it
[5:47] only brings light upon the subject that
[5:49] we're all trying so hard to get the
[5:51] people to see.
[5:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:52] &gt;&gt; It only brings light.
[5:54] So hell being not eternal is a minor.
[5:58] You don't have to believe that hell is
[6:01] not eternal in order to be saved. In
[6:03] other words, you don't have to believe
[6:04] in annihilationalism in order to be
[6:07] saved. Nor do you have to believe in the
[6:08] serpent seed to be saved. But it just
[6:10] shines more gospel light on the word of
[6:13] God. And truly believing the truth about
[6:16] hell not being eternal and the serpent
[6:18] seed. It is a restoration of the
[6:20] apostolic faith, the biblical faith that
[6:23] was once delivered to the saints.
[6:25] So, I've watched some other videos about
[6:28] responses to Kirk Cameron amongst other
[6:30] evangelicals,
[6:32] and none of them can prove by the Bible
[6:34] that Kirk Cameron is wrong. They cite
[6:36] their regular scriptures, but then sadly
[6:39] they cite their church fathers or church
[6:41] creeds rather than the Bible. They
[6:44] normally cite Matthew 18:8 where Jesus
[6:47] said cast into everlasting fire. And so
[6:51] they just focus on that one verse. And I
[6:53] know there's a few other verses they
[6:54] focus on, but the truth is there's more
[6:57] verses that testify that hell is not
[7:00] eternal and that sinners do not go
[7:03] through punishment eternally. Now, I
[7:06] think you'll find the most thorough
[7:08] teaching from God's prophet, Brother
[7:10] Brandham, in the church age book,
[7:11] chapter 4. It's in the Samriian church
[7:14] age under the reward for overcoming
[7:16] section. Brother Ram breaks it down.
[7:18] It's so simple. It's so scriptural to
[7:20] show that hell is not eternal. And it's
[7:22] so important to know that the Bible
[7:24] never says they burn eternally. It never
[7:27] uses the word eternal to speak of
[7:29] burning or torment eternally. Yes, the
[7:32] Bible says everlasting, but anytime
[7:35] everlasting is not applied to God. It
[7:37] does not mean eternal. So everlasting
[7:40] fire or everlasting burning does not
[7:43] mean eternal because it's not applied to
[7:45] God. It's applied to the sinner and
[7:47] their punishment and their torment. So
[7:49] it's that simple. Brother Random there
[7:51] in the church's book shows how the word
[7:54] forever can be used lots of different
[7:55] ways and it doesn't always mean eternal
[7:58] such as God judging the house of Eli
[8:01] forever. And when you search the
[8:03] scriptures, God didn't judge it
[8:05] eternally. He judged it four generations
[8:07] later. So everlasting in that context
[8:10] just meant a vanishing point. Eventually
[8:13] it would end.
[8:15] Then brother M shows how destruction and
[8:17] perish are always used in relation to
[8:20] God's judgment upon sinners which means
[8:23] they have an ending point. Any
[8:25] unbeliever has an ending point. But the
[8:27] believer does not have an ending point
[8:28] because the believer has eternal life or
[8:31] life everlasting or life eternal. And I
[8:34] love this quote. quote, brother Brandham
[8:35] says, "Now, if a sinner is going to go
[8:37] to hell and then suffer the same as you
[8:39] are going to heaven and enjoy heaven,
[8:41] then he has the same kind of life you
[8:43] already have." And that's the main point
[8:45] of this topic. If someone is going to
[8:47] suffer consciously eternally, they
[8:50] already have eternal life. They already
[8:52] have the same life that the believer
[8:53] has. And of course, that's a lie. They
[8:55] do not have eternal life. That's why I
[8:57] suggest for every person on the fence
[8:59] about this, the accusers of brother
[9:01] Brandham or those who don't even know
[9:02] about brother Brandham, do a Bible
[9:04] concordance study on eternal life and
[9:06] life eternal. If you do, you'll find 30
[9:09] verses only in the New Testament that
[9:11] talk about eternal life and life
[9:13] eternal. And if you read them in
[9:14] context, you'll see how life eternal is
[9:17] only promised to the believer, not the
[9:19] unbeliever. Eternal life and life
[9:22] eternal is only promised to the
[9:24] believer, not the unbeliever.
[9:26] Even if you look at the first occurrence
[9:28] of eternal life in Matthew 19:16, the
[9:30] rich young ruler says, "What may I do
[9:32] that I might obtain eternal life?" So
[9:34] this proves he did not have eternal
[9:36] life. And that's what I saw from some of
[9:37] the videos of these attackers of Kirk
[9:40] Cameron. They believe through their
[9:42] creeds that everyone already has eternal
[9:44] life. That's why they can burn
[9:45] eternally. That's a lie. This proves it
[9:48] with the very first occurrence of
[9:49] eternal life. This rich young ruler did
[9:51] not have eternal life. He knew he
[9:53] didn't. That's why he came to Jesus to
[9:54] ask for it. And then he went away sadly
[9:56] because he refused to receive it. He
[9:58] refused to sell out all that he had,
[10:00] give to the poor, and follow the Lord
[10:02] Jesus Christ. First John, the book of
[10:04] First John will give you the most truth
[10:06] on this topic. Although all 30 verses
[10:08] are great, 1 John proves that eternal
[10:11] life is only for the believer, and no
[10:13] murderer or no sinner with sin
[10:15] unconfessed has eternal life. 1 John
[10:18] 3:15, "And ye know that no murderer hath
[10:21] eternal life abiding in him." So we get
[10:23] so much revelation here. Eternal life
[10:25] must be inside the believer. No murderer
[10:28] with unconfessed sin of murdering has
[10:30] eternal life in them. Therefore, they
[10:32] cannot live eternally. Now, their human
[10:34] spirits will last many thousands of
[10:36] years. Think of Cain. He's been dead o
[10:38] almost 6,000 years. And his human spirit
[10:41] and human soul is still being tormented
[10:43] in lake of fire right now. So, those
[10:45] human spirits can last thousands.
[10:47] Brother Ram says perhaps millions of
[10:48] years. They can burn millions and
[10:50] millions of years, billions of years. We
[10:51] don't know. But at some point they will
[10:53] be annihilated and cease to exist. They
[10:55] will perish. They will be destroyed. And
[10:57] Satan will be destroyed as well. Satan
[11:00] is not eternal. There will come a time
[11:02] when there's no more sin, no more devil,
[11:04] no more temptation. The Bible says the
[11:06] last enemy that's to be defeated is
[11:08] death in 1 Corinthians chapter 15. Thank
[11:11] God. And once death is done away with
[11:13] and annihilated, then God's people can
[11:15] live eternally in the new Jerusalem with
[11:17] the Lord Jesus Christ. 1 John 2:25 says,
[11:21] "This is the promise that he hath
[11:22] promised us even eternal life." It's not
[11:25] promised to unbelievers. And this is the
[11:27] record 1 John 5:11, "That God hath given
[11:30] to us eternal life, and this life is in
[11:32] his son. He that hath the son hath life,
[11:35] and he that hath not the son of God hath
[11:37] not life." It's so clear. Unbelievers do
[11:40] not have eternal life because they have
[11:41] not accepted the Lord Jesus Christ.
[11:43] They've not repented of their sins, been
[11:45] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[11:47] Christ, and they have not received the
[11:48] baptism of the Holy Ghost. These things
[11:51] have I written unto you that believe on
[11:52] the name of the Son of God, that ye may
[11:54] know that ye have eternal life, and that
[11:56] ye may believe on the name of the Son of
[11:58] God. 1 John 5:1-13.
[12:02] And lastly, 1 John 5:20. And we know
[12:04] that the Son of God has come, and hath
[12:06] given us an understanding, that we may
[12:08] know him that is true, and we are in him
[12:10] that is true, even in his son, Jesus
[12:12] Christ. This is the true God and eternal
[12:16] life. So we get the truth that God is
[12:18] one person. God is invisible but he's
[12:20] manifested in his son Jesus Christ. This
[12:22] is the true God. Not a second God, not a
[12:25] second person. Jesus Christ is God,
[12:28] supreme deity, the image of the
[12:31] invisible God. And Jesus Christ is
[12:34] eternal life. In closing, friends, I
[12:36] hope this video was a blessing by the
[12:37] grace of God. I just thought I'd do this
[12:39] current event because it relates
[12:41] directly to the message of the hour. for
[12:42] this beautiful revelation God gave us
[12:44] through his prophet brother William
[12:46] Brandham. No doubt brother Brandham
[12:47] finished the mystery of God. So here's a
[12:49] mystery all these evangelicals still
[12:50] arguing about is hell eternal or not but
[12:54] God's prophet brother Brandham gave us
[12:55] the revelation many many decades ago. So
[12:58] we rejoice in the truth of God's word.
[13:01] See, and if you got life without in, HOW
[13:04] CAN YOU PERISH?
[13:07] &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE BECOME A PART OF THE ETERNAL.
[13:10] AND THERE'S ONLY ONE thing eternal.
[13:12] SATAN'S not eternal.
[13:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:15] &gt;&gt; No.
[13:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:15] &gt;&gt; He He becomes Satan.
[13:17] &gt;&gt; Hell is not eternal. Hell was created.
[13:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:20] &gt;&gt; It's not eternal. AND THESE BODIES are
[13:24] not eternal.
[13:25] &gt;&gt; They were created. BUT THE SPIRIT OF GOD
[13:28] IS ETERNAL.
[13:30] &gt;&gt; AMEN. IT NEVER HAD A BEGINNING OR it
[13:32] never has an end. And the ONLY WAY WE
[13:34] CAN HAVE ETERNAL LIFE FROM THAT GREEK
[13:36] WORD ZOEY, WHICH MEANS GOD'S OWN LIFE,
[13:38] WE HAVE WE BECOME A PART OF GOD WHEN WE
[13:42] BECOME SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD. AND WE
[13:45] HAVE A LIFE.
[13:47] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[13:48] &gt;&gt; SO THE PART THAT LIVES US [laughter]
[13:50] THAT RECOGNIZES THIS WORD FROM HERE TO
[13:52] THERE THAT RECOGNIZES IS A ONION LIFE.
[13:55] LIFE WITHOUT IN IS GOD'S OWN LIFE IN US.
[13:58] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN.
[14:01] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[14:02] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[14:03] &gt;&gt; Just as Jesus said, the Holy Ghost will
[14:05] guide us into all truth. So, those of us
[14:06] who've been message believers have
[14:08] already been guided into this truth. We
[14:09] don't have to wonder about this, debate
[14:11] about this. The Bible's clear on this.
[14:14] You only have eternal life when you have
[14:16] faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. Saving
[14:18] faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. And if
[14:20] you don't have that today, repent of
[14:22] your sins. Get on your knees. Cry out to
[14:25] God for mercy for all your sins. Confess
[14:27] all your sins. Call upon the name of the
[14:29] Lord and you shall be saved. Be baptized
[14:31] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for
[14:33] the remission of sins and you shall
[14:35] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. I
[14:38] made this saying through scripture. If
[14:41] you want the Holy Ghost daily read
[14:43] Bible, pray obey every day. You've got
[14:46] to read the Bible. Pray every day. Obey
[14:49] the Bible. And the Bible said God gives
[14:51] the Holy Ghost to them that obey him in
[14:53] Acts 5:32. Friends, we rejoice in the
[14:56] blood of Jesus Christ. That is what
[14:58] saved us. And then the life of the blood
[15:00] now comes upon us to sanctify us and
[15:03] then fill our souls. We call the baptism
[15:05] of the Holy Ghost cuz that's what Jesus
[15:07] called it. And through that baptism of
[15:09] the Holy Ghost, we are made ready for
[15:11] Jesus's secret coming, the second coming
[15:13] of Jesus Christ, the pre-tribulation
[15:16] rapture of the bride of Jesus Christ,
[15:18] snatching his bride away. They'll be
[15:21] caught up or snatched away to meet the
[15:23] Lord in the air. And then God will go
[15:25] back to the Jews and pour out his wrath
[15:27] upon the Gentiles. Praise God for his
[15:30] mercy and his love. Praise God for his
[15:32] son Jesus Christ, the shedding of his
[15:34] blood and the sending of the Holy Ghost
[15:36] that we can have life eternal with Jesus
[15:39] Christ our Lord. If you have any
[15:41] questions, concerns or testimonies about
[15:43] this video, please contact [music] me.
[15:46] God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[15:48] the desire [music] of your heart. Very
[15:52] happy to be here this afternoon and
[15:53] again in defense of the gospel of Jesus
[15:56] Christ [music] to bring the good
[15:58] tidings, the good news that Jesus raised
[16:00] from the dead, living among man today,
[16:02] his church. [music] The same Jesus that
[16:05] was yesterday will be today and forever
[16:09] is never failed.
