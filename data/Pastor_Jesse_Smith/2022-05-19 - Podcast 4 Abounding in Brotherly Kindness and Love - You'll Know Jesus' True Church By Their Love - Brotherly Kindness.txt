========================================

Description:
Jesus said all men would know His true disciples by their love one for another (John 13:35). Accusers of Brother Branham and his Bible Message say there is no love in Message churches, which is false generalization. While no church is perfect at expressing love, true followers of Jesus Christ will express love because Jesus' Spirit dwells in their souls. 

In this podcast, brotherly kindness and divine love are defined. We discuss Jesus' evidence of being born again, which includes expressing love. Good and bad examples are discussed in order that believers can grow and learn to express love more abundantly. Lastly, love in the context of church discipline is taught through the Holy Scripture.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] god bless you and welcome to the defending the message podcast i'm your co-host pastor jesse smith and here's our other co-host um i'm amen god bless you everyone we just want to thank you guys for coming and joining us today for our podcast today and we're here to defend the faith and defend the message today's topic is about love especially about love in the churches as we want to have brotherly kindness towards one another i think this is a very big topic that a lot of churches sometimes struggles with and this is why we want to bring it forth so in this podcast we want to defend the true followers of the message because when this message is taught from the bible it produces genuine brotherly kindness and love in churches today some of the people that have left message churches recently have criticized message churches for not having love which could be true in some individual churches but certainly not all i think it's safe to say that even the churches of brother graham's accusers the churches that they attend are not perfect and they don't always express the love of god no message church is perfect but the sincere ones are pressing on toward the mark of the high calling of god in christ jesus which is growing in broadly kindness and divine love so we're here to defend that this message the bible-based revelations that god gave to brother branham will produce broadly kindness and divine love in genuine worshipers of jesus christ for today's podcast we have four sections so here's the outline first we'll define brotherly kindness and divine love by the bible including six evidences from jesus christ himself that a person is born again with the love of god second we'll share some good experiences with brotherly kindness and love and some bad experiences when we felt a lack of brotherly kindness and love and of course we won't call names in this episode but we want to use these examples so that we can all learn to be better christians and express broadly kindness and love more often thirdly we'll discuss five ways christians can show love to the saints in their home church and lastly we'll discuss how church discipline is an expression of broadly kindness and love it's very helpful of course to give definitions so let's define brotherly kindness if you look in the greek lexicon the word for brotherly kindness is philadelphia which is familiar to all of us it means love of brothers or sisters the love which christians cherish for each other as brethren so brother kindness is a cherished love that christians share and it's unique to christianity because only christians can express the genuine love of jesus christ because they have the spirit of jesus christ in their souls and also anointing their minds daily and their bodies as well in order to find love we just call it charity as first corinthians 13 talks about and to simplify it we would just say it is the character of jesus christ because in first corinthians 13 they give us 16 attributes of love such as suffereth long kind envieth not vaunteth not itself not puffed up doth not behave itself unseemly seeketh not her own not easily provoked thinketh no evil rejoiceth not iniquity rejoiceth in the truth beareth all things believeth all things hope with all things endureth all things and charity never fails so brother amen which scripture would you start with that you think would be the most helpful place to start for us i think first corinthians 13 1-3 i think this one's a really big one for us because we know so much about the word the revelation of god's word and we have to be careful not to be prideful or to exalt ourselves among one another thinking that we're better than one in life because we have more of a revelation of the word or we've been in the messes for way longer than someone else you know that does not give us a reason to be prideful or to be boastful and not want to fellowship or talk about the word and i'll read first corinthians 13 for us though i speak with tongues of men and of angels and have not charity i become a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol and though i have the gifts of prophecy and understanding all mysteries and all knowledge and though i have all faith so that i can remove mountains and have not charity i am nothing and though i bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though i give my body to be burned and that charity it profits me nothing there are so many things in that scripture brother that is a beautiful choice the holy spirit led you to that i think for our day we know the mystery of god is finished according to revelation 10 7 god fulfilled it through his prophet brother william branham but that scripture hits the nail on the head the fact that we can understand all the mysteries of god but if we don't have charity it profits us nothing in other words we can understand all the mysteries god revealed through brother branham's ministry but if we are not born again with the baptism of the holy ghost it doesn't profit us anything because like like you said brother amen we can be prideful and so we've got to make sure that we don't exalt ourselves above other people in the message or exalt ourselves above non-message people or we'd say denominational christians because we know we're going to be tempted in one of three areas lust of the eyes lust of the flesh pride of life a lot of message people are able to overcome the lust of the eyes lust of the flesh but as we've noticed recently and also as we'll probably do future podcasts or youtube videos about many times pride gets into people's hearts and lives and so we got to be very careful to not let satan deceive us into thinking we're better than other people because of the revelations we've received also there's a good scripture from matthew 24 12 because of iniquities about the love of many wax cult we might be too worthy sometimes or love the things of the world too much where we don't love our brother as we ought to maybe we put our eyes off from god and to other things you know maybe like making money or starting your business you know sometimes life just gets in front of you and you forget about your brother to care for your brother and life's not always about us but we ought to serve one another yeah this is the age of self-love as paul said i believe it's in second timothy chapter three they'll be lovers of their own selves and lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god so if there's ever been an age where we need love it's this age because jesus said because iniquity abounds as you read the love of god will wax cold and i think we can feel it in our lives um no doubt even brother branham could feel it if you listen to that sermon or if our listeners would listen to that sermon what house will you bill me 1965 brother branham talked about how he felt the brother is getting a little cold in the spirit and how he longed for that feeling when he first got saved so i think it's something that everybody feels as they get older in the lord you know they get more tired they get more worn out but especially here in laodicea where self-love and worshiping of money riches and all these things is is so valued that we have to be very careful that the cares of the world don't spring up in our lives and choke out the love of god in our lives we've got to as brahman said get our eyes off ourselves and get them onto other [Music] one of people if you feel like i do i am so hungry to see the spirit of god moving i just can't hardly stand it some experiences i've said up in the mountains just to feel that once again that's something that when i was first saved that was so glorious to my heart and we can come into a place we can set and we see it among us that we're drying as we sit here in the desert i get among my brothers and they talk with me and i'll talk with them always in a little way of watching feeling out there in the spirit as it was to see just the condition of that brother to see what's wrong i begin to feel this all reclining getting away from the spirit it's become too natural a thing to us we must worship in the spirit for the spirit of god not only our message should be the flame uh of the hour this should be the flame in our hearts amen see it's got to be in our hearts or we can't we can't rightly present it to the people the spirit has to pack the message itself and i'm trusting and believing in every one of you to be a real christian now let's look at six evidences of being born again with the love of god from jesus christ himself so one of the marks of being a real genuine christian is having brotherly love and charity as we'd say jesus christ says all men so even sinners will know we're christians because of how we love each other and of course how we love them as well so now we're getting into kind of the evidence of the holy ghost what is evidence a person is truly born again now we know we can summarize and just say it's believing all the word of your day well that's true but what is the word of our day it's the whole bible it's all the bible scriptures that pertain to holy ghostfield christians and so that includes loving one another as john 13 35 says it also includes supernatural signs and wonders done by the holy ghost according to mark 16 verses 17-18 it includes remembering jesus's words john 14 26 the holy ghost shall bring all things to remembrance whatsoever i have said unto you so that's where the holy ghost will remind you oh go make this right go apologize about that or remind you oh i need to humble myself because i was prideful the holy ghost brings all these words of jesus to our remembrance also testifying about and glorifying jesus john 15 26 and 16 14 say the spirit of truth he shall testify of me and the spirit of truth shall glorify me someone that really has the love of god they'll want to glorify jesus christ they want to worship and praise his wonderful name they want to testify about jesus that's what we're doing today we're testifying about the love of jesus christ how it's been expressed to us and then also the holy ghost will tell us future events john 16 13 the spirit of truth will show you things to come and then one more listening to and believing the human messenger sent to preach during their lifetimes jesus said this in john 17 verses 20 and 21 he said neither pray i for these alone but for them also which shall believe on me through their word that they all may be one so people that really love jesus christ they just got to hear brother branham preach and if they hear brother ben preach about jesus and the cross and the holy ghost and the laodicean age we live in and how god is going to rapture his true bride out of this age they will recognize the love of god in brother branham's life because he loved jesus christ more than money he loved jesus christ more than popularity or any other thing like that he was a true servant of god so when we receive brother branham we receive christ who sent brother branham and also the holy father who sent christ as well according to jesus's own words based upon first thessalonians 3 verse 12 we want to talk about some wonderful times when god has shown his love to us through other saints or maybe even people that weren't in the message that we just knew and recognized it was the love of god now the scripture says and the lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another and toward all men even as we do toward you so one of the first ones that comes to my mind is when we had our fourth child we just moved to a different house and there was a brother who lived in pennsylvania he lived two hours away well there's a wonderful message church in pennsylvania two hours away from us and they had it on their hearts they knew our baby was coming and once we had the baby they loaded up their entire truck bed full of frozen foods and the brother drove two hours on a saturday to drop off an entire truckload of food and thankfully just got an extra freezer down in the basement and so we had two freezers we were able to fill up both and they just fit inside of our freezers and the one that wouldn't fit that's what we had for supper that night and i just remember tears were coming to my eyes i just couldn't believe how another church could think so much about someone else from the church and then drive all that way with all that food to bless this humble little family of four and then later when we had like our seventh child i remember that same church sent us a 300 gift card to giant eagle because they knew we liked eating that giant eagle after services and things like that so again people we don't even see every week we don't even see these people maybe once or twice a year if that but they have so much love of god in their hearts that all these sisters can cook all these meals and send the food over it just meant a lot to us and that's where i could say their love abounded one toward another i remember meeting some other people um just when i first first started meeting some other message believers it's always wonderful when you can talk to someone and you just have you feel the holy ghost coming from them you just have that same connection it's it's like you just feel the love of god pouring from that person and it just makes it so easy just to talk to one another and i remember a few of our brothers that i've met for the first time and we just hit it off the bat because this is the love of god it's great to know that someone else has to experience the same love that you experience with god and to able to talk to someone like that and just be able to connect and just to grow as a brother just to know that this man is your brother that really loves god and know that he will really love you too and it's great to have those brothers there are just so many examples of how christians have poured out their love to us i mean there's been numerous times i've just gone out to the mailbox and inside the mailbox are letters with checks for 1 000 or 1500 or 2 thousand dollars sometimes there's names on the checks and i know who sent them you know other preachers or just friends and other times they're anonymous so the only way i can understand this is that god has placed his love in people's hearts and when i've received those cash offerings or whatever i've really needed them one time i needed to pay off my car that helped me pay off my car one time i needed money for my next college course that came in very handy other times i needed offerings to pay off my books which god has always provided i've not had to spend one cent of my own money on those books god has always provided graciously and then there's a time when i prayed for god to help get a brother in our church out of debt and god sent twelve thousand five hundred dollars from a man i didn't even know he just always enjoyed our youtube ministry and he felt led to send it and it just came at the right time and the right season again unparalleled love i never saw this love when i was in the denominational churches although i did feel loved to some degree but here when we come into the message of the hour i felt love in abundance as the scripture says here and i can see that love growing toward one another yeah that's what really drew me to the message just to love when i first met you i just felt the love of god just come from you and that just that's what drew me to this message to experience that know that god is real and there's people that actually really love god and because they love god they can love each other i think as there's a scripture that says um they shall know us by our love towards one another in john 13 35 says by this shall all men know that ye are my disciples if you have loved one to another that's a really good scripture especially when we have guest visitors that come and they always say wow we feel the love of god just coming from your church we're not breaking or boasting or anything but it's just you know god is god has saved us by his grace and we just love god so much that we just want to give and love other people just as he has loved us hallelujah you know that reminds me brother last year towards the end of 2021 we had a sister visit our church and she come in we greeted her and everything and we talked and fellowshipped and she visited a couple of times over the course of a few months but the last time she visited she said i just want to thank you she said i feel so much love in your little church and we only have 25 30 and half of those are kids you know but she said i go to a church where there's 300 she said i feel like it's a mega church and she said i hardly feel any love in the church and she said i just want to thank you that you expressed love to me and so that has always stuck with me over these you know last six months or so i need to remember to always show god's love to visitors and stay humble and not get prideful and remember where i came from and really remember that the greatest gift of all faith hope and charity the greatest of these is charity another good example of is when i first came in the message we were college students and we were visiting this church up in sheffield wonderful saints i believe holy ghost-filled saints well we were just kind of you know college students and there was one certain brother named brother bill and almost every sunday we'd walk up shake his hand and when i shake his hand i'd pull my hand back and there'd be a 20 bill in my hand this brother knew we were poor college students or we didn't really have any other jobs you know so he just made an active effort to show his love in that way here's 20 bucks for gas i know you guys are driving an hour and a half for an hour and 15 minutes to come to services we appreciate your fellowship we love you guys and we just kind of laugh and joke that this man showed his love with a 20 handshake and 20 years later when i talked to this brother he said you guys were such a blessing you young people were such a blessing when you came to our church you sat in the front row you said amen you stood up you clapped you shouted you praised the lord you were such an inspiration to the older generation that you guys helped bring us a revival and so you know when i was younger in college i didn't know i was bringing a revival i didn't know i was a breath of fresh air in the church i was just on fire with the love of god i knew jesus loved me he forgive me my sins i love this message i knew the water baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ was right that's about all i knew at that time but i was just in love with god i was in love with the bible and that goes to show like the love of god is like a fire in your heart right and if somebody else is cooling down you know just put your fire with their fire their lick of fire and it will stir everybody up and bring a revival so that's really what brings revival is the love of jesus christ in our hearts now we'd like to share some negative experiences we've had with some who've had a lack of broadly kindness but this is in order to help us examine ourselves so we can be more loving and remember we can learn from both good examples and also bad examples for jesus said remember lot's wife clearly she was a bad example of someone who would look back to the world and miss the world but jesus said we can learn from that so we've all got to learn how to overcome times when we felt a lack of brotherly kindness and then take the initiative to express and show love to others who might not be very easy to love but as brother rahm said if we have the love of jesus christ we should be able to love even the unlovable can i bring some um some of my experiences that i've had with this um the reason why i wanted to do this podcast about this topic was because i just felt like we went to matches some message churches that we've never gone to and i'm not going to say which church it was but it was a really big church and my wife and i we went there and no one greeted us no deacon nobody from the door holding the door open no one greeted us and it was the most saddest thing i've ever felt even before service and after service no one ever said a thing to us but yet the service was anointed it was wonderful worship wonderful sermon everything was great but there was no fellowship no love it's like everyone else had their own their own clique their own people to go to and no one bothered saying hi to us that really hurted our feelings we're like i thought we were all brothers and sisters i thought we all loved god so why isn't anyone showing love to people who never came to this church before most recently we went to a wedding and my wife was telling me the most i want to say troubling but disheartening experience she had was she went up to they were before the wedding was going on she went to go use the restroom and she met a sister there and she just went up there and gave her the best christian greeting you can give up give a sister you know you know introduce yourself be really nice and give them a hug love them and that lady respondus is like who are you do i know you and that really hurt my wife because i thought we were all brothers and sisters in christ you know soon we just you know have a common ground where we can just love each other even though we're strangers you know why are why do we have to be treated in such a way where if we don't know each other then we shouldn't talk or you know we should feel like we're left out because we're not part of your church or anything yeah concerning that story about the big church that's an example of how even denominational churches can show some form of love better than some message churches that's so true i mean the last denomination church we went to go visit they had so much love for us a lot of love a little surprising that they loved us so much compared to some of the message churches we've been to yeah it's really surprising so it just makes you wonder what happened to this message church what happened over the course of the decades of their ministry what has happened where they don't even feel enough love of god to greet people at the door thank them for coming offer to take them out to eat and so it's something that we can learn from you know we can learn from good examples we can also learn from bad examples and so in this case we can learn out our church to always greet and love the visitors clap for them make them feel at home offer them free books and sermons of brother branham anything we can possibly give them we can invite them out to lunch so these are things that we see and we can see how the love of god is lacking in some ways and we want to be able to learn how we can love better from these situations so it makes me think like i know that we shouldn't be numbering people or counting people like to see who who has god or not you know but i kind of see like makes me really wonder like do these people really have like the holy ghost or like are they born again because in the statue of perfect man barley kindness is right under there and love is on top the capping stone of it all you know what's what's missing in their life are they not born again they say at least have some kind of degree of love for another or love for our brethren unless they have a really deep complex that they're still trying to go through that i mean that's the only thing i can think of you know absolutely brother that's it's either one or the other either they have reach brotherly kindness and they have the anointing of brotherly kindness and brotherly love but at that particular moment when we meet people they're going through struggles you know they're having mind battles they're in a deep complex and they're not able to express it or the other explanation is they've not reached broadly kindness yet maybe they're at faith virtue knowledge temperance patience but for sure if they're not able to express love they don't have the anointing of brotherly kindness now remember there's also the other option if someone isn't loving they could reach out and then apologize later and come back and say you know i'm sorry i wasn't loving but if they don't have your phone number or something like that they couldn't do it so maybe the next time we see them maybe they would express more love or say i'm sorry i wasn't loving i recently had that i had a brother send some really harsh texts to me some of the harshest texts i've ever received in my life i didn't know what to do so i just waited on it a week later we had a preacher come in from south carolina and he said sometimes god takes people out of your lives and they reject you and you just got to let them go i knew it was god talking to me i wept at the altar i was asked for prayer a month and a half later this brother texts me and says i'm sorry i said such harsh words god has convicted me of that i'm now delivered from my critical spirit and so i just praise the lord in that and it shows with each and every situation we got to take it to god in prayer wait upon the lord i mean i was tempted to text right back and say fine if you want to do this and that that i was tempted to get in the flesh and not show love but through the preaching of the word through waiting and learning and growing as a christian i learned to just wait on god and then jesus worked it out we're on good terms again but i told the brother i said i may i might feel a little nervous around you next time i see you but i appreciate your humility i said we all need the blood of jesus christ and we're all trusting in the blood of jesus christ i make mistakes we all make mistakes but that was a good example of how a man who i believe has the holy ghost can get a critical spirit sound very unloving and make it seem like he didn't have early kindness but then a month and a half later the spirit of god corrects him brings him back into fellowship with the holy spirit and now restores our fellowship so this proves here this man did have brotherly kindness but just some cares of life perhaps or some complexes came up in his heart and mind but now the spirit has brought him back into fellowship i know god's been telling me sometimes i get too judgmental at times where i am pretty judgmental against another church because of their lack of love and god will always tell me and my wife will always tell me instead of saying that why don't you just pray for them and i get convicted of that all the time that i shouldn't be the one to judge people but i should just pray for them that god would move in their lives and god would forgive them and god would restore the love in their lives and he could do the same for us all the time too that's something i think every honest christian would admit to you know again if we don't struggle with lust of the eyes and lust of the flesh well then the area we're going to battle the most is pride of life i think you see that in brother graham's life as well it seems pride of life was the area brother rams struggle with most and four examples come to my mind on november 14 1953 brother brahm said he contacted amoebas because he left god's perfect will in south africa by accepting the itinerary of the denominational ministers rather than obeying the lord's itinerary so when brother ram disobeyed the lord's itinerary was that lust of the flesh lust of the eyes or pride of life that would have been pride of life a second example was from october 3rd 1954 brother ram said he developed a critical spirit and he said quote it haunts me end quote so a critical spirit would be under the pride of life it wouldn't be lust of the eyes or lust of the flesh third examples from june 23 1963 from the sermon standing in the gap this whole sermon is about brother abraham's battle with a spiritual complex he admitted he had a complex of not wanting to go preach to groups that wouldn't obey the word he'd already preached to them and he said he had lost the feeling of the people like moses lost his feeling for the people so again that has to be pride of life and the final example on july 24 1963 brother ram told god you owe me an understanding when god took home a young mother when brother ram thought she was going to live and then brother ram said god left him sitting alone so again that had to be pride of life because that wasn't the lust of the eyes or lust of the flesh and remember you know brotherly kindness is the last character quality god gives a christian before he's born again and brings him into the family of god it's as if god is saying i've graciously built you up into a godly spiritual being but before i officially adopt you into my family by the sea of the holy ghost i'm going to give you broadly kindness so you'll serve and love my other children that i've adopted in other words it's like god gives you that last anointing to make sure you're going to treat his body well so we're all learning we're all growing in the grace and knowledge of the lord and so we're just trusting in god that will express divine love and broadly kindness to message people to non-message peoples sinners saints everyone that we come in contact with because as jesus said this proves we're his children because god is good to the just and the unjust he sends his reign upon the just and the unjust and so we want to be just like our heavenly father i know we talked about this um recently but what do you think about like guest preachers who come preach the word but then yet they don't want to listen to any saints when they come to fellowship time because i know i had that experience quite a few times when we had guest preachers come and great sermon wonderful sermon on a full anointing but when we go to do fellowships they don't want to talk about the word they don't want to listen to anybody tell their testimony or have anything to do with that have any any input on that yeah i would think you know i've just done a little bit evangelism myself before i was pastor i would feel like uh if a man was like that it's probably one of two things have happened he's either been hurt in the past by fellowshipping with people and they've maybe criticized him and so he has built up a complex and he's cut himself off from that fellowship and he doesn't want to put himself out there because he he doesn't want to get hurt again i would say that because really the bible says ministers are servants preachers are servants we're supposed to serve the people you know that we're preaching to and help them out and try to encourage them and the bible says to humble ourselves and to go amongst brothers who are least esteemed so as ministers we need to find the people that are least esteemed go to them help them out give them a word of courage be a blessing to them but then the other side might be the preacher might not be born again i mean judas hung around in justification and sanctification for three and a half years and on the night of the last supper no one knew that judas was going to betray them at the beginning he lived such a good life but then at some point he started getting the love of money in there and he lost his anointing he lost his his christian virtue as we know you can lose it before you're born again so that could be the case as well brother might not be born again so maybe he doesn't have the love of jesus christ in his heart to be able to humble himself and condescend to men of lowered estate as the scripture says so i think one of the biggest issues is pride as you said brother and pride is self-confidence thinking so high of yourself well that's the opposite of humility humility is thinking lower of yourself and the bible says be clothed with humility so it's something you have to actively put on in your mind you have to actively say lord anoint me with humility so i think other people are more important than me and so that when i come into a church service or i come into a fellowship i see myself as a servant not the one to be served but the one to serve others and meet other people's needs but it's a difficult thing it's a battle and we've got to put that on we've got to humble ourselves and become a servant to other people and actually a third reason a preacher may not talk with other saints is because maybe he's just shy and doesn't have a lot to say or maybe he hasn't learned yet how to reach out to others start conversations and be loving and friendly i'm a scripture that's not quite exactly aligned with loving loving but it's something that god's been helping me with for the past month it's as he would that meant should do unto you do ye also to them likewise luke 6 31 god's been reminding me the golden rule is we have to if we want someone to love us the way we want to be loved then we should go love other people just do it because you want that kind of experience back that's right god is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him and the bible gives that that law that whatever a man sows that will he reap and so the golden rule is such a beautiful rule to live by right if we want to reap people being kind to us then we need to be kind to other people that's what brother branham said as well but ram said if you want people to say good things about you say good things about them that's that law of reaping and sewing beautiful lesson here's just my observation i think just sometimes there are people in message churches that who were born in the message but yet they have not experienced the love of god in their lives and they were so swayed by the world where it lists looks so tempting for themselves to get up and leave and i know that people who are outside of the world or who are born in the world come into the message they just love god so much more because they never experienced god like this before and they're willing to let go of everything yeah that's beautiful that reminds me of the story of jesus at the house of simon when the woman came in and all the pharisees were criticizing jesus for letting this woman wash his feet and then jesus forgave the woman and he asked simon who would love me the most and jesus said she that's forgiven much loveth much and so i've seen that same thing too brother a lot of people that were not raising the message they experienced jesus christ powerfully when they come in because they're actually choosing to come into the message they're choosing to forsake everything and they experience jesus's love and victory and deliverance and so they truly love god and they love to raise their hands they love to sing and cry and pray and worship and say amen to the word of god now the other side that's dangerous is those who are raised in the message if they never have a true experience with christ true repentance and experience that genuine forgiveness and they're just hanging in church just for the sake of being religious or out of fear uh thinking that well people are going to think i'm backslid if i leave the church they never have a true experience whether it's repentance or sanctification so i've seen the same thing and so when we see those things we've got to talk about those things we've got to pray for the people that they have a real experience with god because if they ever meet jesus christ and jesus christ forgives them of their sins they'll love jesus christ like we love jesus christ i'm really concerned for the youth and the young generation i've been talking to um someone young and they made a mention that they know some friends inside message churches that say they don't even know if god's real and they go to message churches and it's kind of like a routine for them it's just they go because their parents go and i don't know they just don't love god the way they ought to or they don't know god in a way in a deep relationship yeah that's a serious concern i mean it could be one of two things it could be either their fault because they're not listening to their parents and the preacher and perhaps they're the ones that are not seeking after god so god isn't real to them or it could be the fault of the leadership maybe the pastor is not born again maybe their parents aren't born again so again these are really serious cases these are burdens on our hearts because we have the love of god just like i'm sure our listeners many of our listeners have the same love of god they wonder where is the love of god how come there's not more love in the messes churches how come there's not more young people really seeking the lord and confessing their sins and really enjoying worship and just coming to the house of god and being in the presence of god and the answer is because of iniquity iniquity when people know to do right but they fail to do right and it basically comes down to each individual's choice you know is that person going to repent of their sins experience the cross and the resurrection power of the lord jesus christ for themselves or not so our prayer is that they'll do that they'll experience jesus's love can we kind of go in the opposite of that direction so my wife and i we went to the store earlier today and we saw they were celebrating pride day and their big statement is to love we love one another or everyone has to love one another something around that line and they're just pretty much stealing off from the bible saying oh we we have to love one another because of our differences do you want to make any mention on that that's a great question brother so obviously pride month or pride day or pride month is supporting homosexuality transgenderism all these things now we don't judge their eternal destinations that's only up to god but we are called to judge fruits jesus said we have to take the plank out of our eye first and then we can judge other people's situations and again we never judge their eternal destinations but we do warn them that their eternal destination will be held in the lake of fire of course not for eternity but that's the that'll be the place of their torment and punishment if they fail to repent of the truth of god's word so they say we're to love them because they're in sin but they just perverted the meaning of love jesus define love love is to believe god and keep his commandments jesus said if you love me keep my commandments and jesus explained what real love in marriage is he said it's between one man and one woman in matthew chapter 19 i believe in matthew chapter 5 as well if i'm not mistaken he said a man shall cleave unto his one wife so jesus said we must go back to the beginning adam and eve male and female one male one female that's real marriage and then remember romans chapter one says it actually speaks of homosexuals and says they're actually haters of god they hate the knowledge of god because they've changed the use of their body parts that god gave them god gave them their reproductive body parts to fit into his system to fulfill the male and female reproductive system that god created and so by defying that they actually hate god they hate to retain god's knowledge in their minds but it's mass behind this oh we love everybody and just love us so it's an act of deception by satan he's cloaking hatred for god with the word love so satan loves to take the scriptures and twist it like he did with jesus he tempted him three times and say he said if you're the son of god cast yourself down and he quoted psalms where the angels of god will catch you but jesus said you shall not tempt the lord your god so he was twisting the scriptures and we know the pope and all these people in the economical movement they're twisting the scriptures where jesus said we must be one well we can't be one unless we have the same doctrine and the same power and the same belief so we will not be one with the roman catholic church because they worship the eucharist and we know the eucharist is not the literal body and blood of the lord so there's another example where satan is twisting the scripture and he's hiding behind this scripture of oh we must all be one and we must all love each other but it's a perverted oneness it's a perverted love it's a lie it's not the truth and what it comes down to is they worship the creation instead of the creator if you worship the creator you worship god's word or the creator's word and you obey him and you love him now let's look at five simple concrete ways a christian can show love to the saints in his or her home church as i was preparing for this podcast i was reminded of a portion i wrote on barley kindness in my 2021 book and and i showed there's five ways a christian should show love to his christian church or his home church or his real family we'd say the spiritual family of the body of jesus christ first brotherly kindness moves believers to meet the physical needs of other christians like james says you have dead faith if you tell a brother who's cold well i hope you get warm real faith will get him a coat real faith will get him some food if he's hungry second brother kindness promotes radical forgiveness towards fellow christians jesus told peter forgive them 70 times seven not just seven times but 490 times we should forgive our brothers paul told philemon put onesimus's debt on my account in other words i'll pay off the brother's debt even though he was your slave and he owes you money or put that debt on my account and i'll pay it off that's radical forgiveness you don't see that kind of forgiveness very often and god always says that you should love your enemies how much more so we love our brothers thirdly we can show love for our family by gathering with christians more as we see that day approaching according to hebrews 10 verses 24 and 25. i told brother amen this before but as soon as i see brother amen something jumps in my heart whether it's sunday or saturday i'm like praise god i haven't seen him all week i just i just want to go give him a hug and ask him how his week was well that's how it is with every christian i'm just so encouraged every time i see another christian it makes me want to just praise god and be more dedicated to jesus and live for them as pastor i'm supposed to i'm supposed to feed them and shepherd them and do the best i can to watch over their souls but just the reality of seeing another christian should make us fall more in love with them and want to see them more often by the grace of god fourth christians should offer broadly kindness with impartiality regarding anyone's socio-economic status so no matter whether a christian is rich or poor believers should love each other the same james talks about that again we shouldn't give a better seat in the church to a rich person and tell the poor person to stand you know there's different people in our church that we've talked to and they used to go to message churches where if you were not rich then you did not fellowship with those message believers so it's sad but the message church was divided based upon socio-economic status the rich only fellowship with the rich and then the rich looked down upon the poor people if you didn't have brand new clothes on every week or if you didn't drive a certain vehicle you were looked down upon those things should not be so in those cases those people that were rich probably weren't born again they probably didn't have brotherly kindness you know we don't know for sure but by their fruits we know them if they carry these type of behaviors on for years and years they either have the most awful complex a real christian could ever have or they don't have the genuine broadly kindness or charity that jesus wants them to have and lastly brother kindness leads christians to pray for one another paul said in ephesians 6 18 praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit watching there unto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints it should be our joy to pray for other people we are priests unto god who else do we know in this world that's praying for the war in ukraine to end other than christians who else do we know in this world who's praying for abortion to end in america and around the world except for christians we're a very small group we're going to get smaller and smaller as we see that day approaching but we should pray for sin to end we should also pray for strength for the saints that they'll be strengthened with god's might in their inner man we should pray for those who are suffering from famines pray for the sick and the afflicted we should pray for miracles we should pray for deliverance it's our duty and it also should be our joy to pray for other people as christians i think brother brahms said uh the most important thing you can do is pray out of you know reading your bible and worshiping prayer is the most important thing yeah brother ram said you can worship too much he said you can sing too much read your bible too much he said but you'll never pray too much amen hallelujah let's pray again lord please lord oh i am i saying too much i might preach too much i might shout too much of my cry too much but i'll never pray too much oh god search me and try me so in this last section before we close we want to just show how church discipline is balanced with love how can you be loving and show church discipline this is an important topic as some churches don't have any church discipline but real christians should have church discipline because we know love is corrective in hebrews 12 it talks about every son of god is chastened to the lord and that word actually means to punish or to spank or to hit in other words god has to give us sometimes spiritual spankings to get us back in line and jesus talked about it in matthew 18 about church discipline and so there's numerous scriptures in the bible that talk about how church discipline must be carried out but it's the love of god carrying out church discipline it's the love of god cleaning out the church what do you think about people going up to other brothers and telling them oh god you shouldn't be doing this because it's in the word do you think that's right of a brother to go do that or is would that be their responsibility to go and tell the brother that they're in the wrong or should we just leave that up to god that he would be the one doing it maybe like behind the pulpit or something that's a great question brother as long as he's in the right spirit galatians 6 verses 1 and 2 tells us that it actually tells us if you see a brother overtaken in a fault then the bible says you which are spiritual go to that person and try to bring reconciliation so as long as that brother has or sister you know has the right approach and there's a love of god in their heart trying to bring correction that that's something they should do one-on-one and that could also manifest brother a gift of the holy spirit so that person might have the gift of discernment god might let them know the secrets or the thoughts intents of that person's heart in order to correct them or they might had a dream about it which could be another form of prophecy or a warning coming through a prophecy that if this person doesn't repent they might have to suffer some consequences could be a gift of knowledge god gives them a scripture of knowledge about the word that they need to help them overcome as well yeah the love of god tells us to mark them that cause divisions in romans 16 verse 17 and avoid them so when we see preachers or individuals who are causing divisions in churches or preaching false doctrine we're to mark them amongst our brethren that means point them out and avoid them and so that is the love of jesus christ keeping the saints united and keeping the leaven out of the church there's other scripture like in first corinthians five and six i believe it is the bible says you shouldn't even eat with a fornicator who says they're a brother because the bible says when you do that when you won't have fellowship with them that makes them ashamed and that will make them want to live right and come back and serve god repent to their fornication so they can have fellowship with the saints again and then also the bible says in thessalonians if a man doesn't work he shouldn't eat well some people are so deceived you know they'll let homeless people or anybody just come to church and keep feeding them but if they have the ability to work and they don't work and they claim to be a part of the church or claim to be a christian we shouldn't feed them that's a hard thing to say but paul saw it was a problem in the church at thessalonica and the only way that love would correct that is to say i'm not going to give you food unless you work because you're just being a busybody you're wasting your time you're not carrying your your weight so i have a scripture i like your opinion on it it says if a man say i love god and hate of his brother he is a liar for he have not the love of his brother if he that loveth not his brother whom he have seen how can he love god whom he has not seen i was just wondering you know if if we have people in our our churches that cause division or intentionally do something wrong against our brother how would you handle that in the church that's a great question you know jesus told us within a church in matthew 18 he says if someone sinned against you i think it's 1815. he said go to that person one on one if they hear you you've gained your brother if not take a witness with you and then if they hear you you've gained the brother because in the mouth of two or three witnesses let every word be established the third time if you go and he doesn't hear you then let the man be as a sinner and republican unto you in other words avoid them and that's church discipline they're according to the lord jesus christ what if it's like a pastor that's like that that's a good question you know so it seems like a pastor could be corrected in one of two ways so first if he personally offended you as a brother maybe not behind the pulpit and it wasn't a public sin then you would go to him one on one like matthew 18 15 says but then second if he sinned in front of the whole church or out in public in front of many witnesses then the scripture says against an elder receive not an accusation except in the mouth of two or three witnesses so you kind of have to see which case it was was it a case where the pastor offended you privately one on one or did the pastor sin publicly and therefore needs to repent publicly paul says if you have an accusation against them an elder you have to have two or three witnesses and go to the pastor that way so again you go the same way you go one on one to the pastor if you don't receive you then you have to take a witness with you if you don't have a witness you just got to pray for that person and you have to trust god that in time god will bring correction to that man in a couple different ways either in his own private life the holy spirit will convict him of that he'll repent and come to you and apologize or if he doesn't repent of that that sin can only grow it's like leaven it's just going to get more and more sinful all the time and then he'll be exposed in another area of his life or maybe there you'll talk to somebody and they'll have a witness against him doing the same thing then you would have two witnesses but that's really the way to do church order brother is as how jesus said love makes you go to the person who's offended you love makes you cast your cares on the lord well one way to do that is to follow jesus's words and go to that person and try to be reconciled that's the real spirit of christ is reconciliation in closing we just want to encourage you guys to continue to love one another to love your church and even if you don't feel love at your church you should take courage and try to be the first one to show love it takes a friend to make a friend you know so in the same case you know if you want to be loved go love someone at your church that's beautiful brother we need to take initiative we can't wait for other people to love us if we have the love of jesus christ in our hearts we gotta go love them first i think i'd like to end with this beautiful quote from brother branham where brother ram says even if we bitterly disagree with our brother and our brother would cut us up and down about how we're wrong afterwards we should still be able to put our arms around that brother and love him and brother brahm said i love it he said and think just as highly about that person as christ does well how much does christ think about that person he thinks immensely about that person because he gave his life for that person on the cross god proved his love to us through the death of jesus christ on the cross you don't want to get like uh oswald see if you can't disagree with a man and things then shake his hand and still have the same feelings towards him then there's something wrong with you if i can't disagree with the man bitterly from one side to the other and still think as much of him as as christ would then there's something wrong with my spirit i haven't the spirit of christ if he says well brother adam i believe that you are teaching is this uh all right brother let's come together to reason you and i we'll take it ourselves we'll go over here in the room to ourselves we'll reason out and he just cuts me to pieces now i have to say things back to him if in my heart i can't feel the same about him and he's still my brother and i'm trying to help him then i'll never help him there's no way for me to help him if i don't love him what's used to going over there telling the first place first brother i don't love you and let me get that out of my heart right here before we go in there because i can't help you until i love you just a
