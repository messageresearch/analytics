[0:09] God bless you and welcome to defending
[0:12] the message podcast I'm your co-host
[0:14] Pastor Jesse Smith and I'm Eamon Lee
[0:16] this is part three of our sister Naomi's
[0:18] testimony hopefully the first two parts
[0:20] have been a blessing in part one we saw
[0:22] how God got a hold of our sister at a
[0:25] very young age raising the message and
[0:27] we felt this would be a great blessing
[0:29] to all of our children in our church who
[0:31] are raising the message the Bible
[0:33] revelations that God gave us through his
[0:35] Prophet William Branham and then in part
[0:37] two we got into our sisters battles and
[0:38] victories as she went to high school and
[0:41] college and the Lord was with her
[0:43] despite all the persecution and negative
[0:46] words and attacks from the enemy the
[0:47] Lord helped her overcome especially
[0:49] using Philippians 2 12 about how we're
[0:51] to seek out our own salvation with fear
[0:54] and trembling so here in part three by
[0:56] God's grace we're looking at our
[0:57] sister's testimonies here how God has
[0:59] used her in a great way in our humble
[1:01] little home church here and we trust
[1:03] these testimonies will be a great
[1:04] blessing to you let's start with our
[1:06] first testimony uh we remember the time
[1:08] when he's spoken tongues and during one
[1:11] of our services and can you tell us how
[1:13] that came to be and what you went
[1:15] through so that was some time 2018 and I
[1:18] think I was I was going through a lot of
[1:20] struggles I was battling whether I was
[1:22] filled with the Holy Spirit or not and
[1:25] I remember praying like out of nowhere
[1:28] he just came pray pray that you speak in
[1:31] tongues for a confirmation of the Holy
[1:34] that you have the Holy Spirit and
[1:37] I was praying about it it's something I
[1:39] have never done before I've never spoken
[1:40] in tongues and I prayed about it for a
[1:43] while and then
[1:44] I had forgotten about it and then it
[1:47] happened I came to church I forgot this
[1:49] the sermon that was preached but then it
[1:53] happened in that service and
[1:55] I was like whoa so when I got home I
[1:57] called my dad and I'm like I spoke in
[2:00] tongues
[2:01] I was like and then he said that was his
[2:03] example he's like whoa that's a
[2:05] confirmation that she have the Holy
[2:06] Spirit that was what he said
[2:08] but I had forgotten I was praying about
[2:11] the fact that I wanted to speak in
[2:13] tongues for a confirmation of the Holy
[2:15] Spirit then after a couple of months I
[2:19] remember I was I think I gave a
[2:21] testimony in church
[2:23] and then after that testimony I was
[2:26] battling so strong like you just gave
[2:28] your testimony in church how sure are
[2:30] you that you are saved and it was so
[2:32] strong I was battling it so much like
[2:34] maybe I shouldn't have done that because
[2:37] it's like okay you think you're standing
[2:39] how about if you fall
[2:40] so it was it was a hard time for me then
[2:43] it came to my remembrance that you
[2:47] remember you prayed for the whole you
[2:48] prayed that you speak in tongues for a
[2:50] confirmation of the Holy Spirit and you
[2:52] actually did so immediately that came to
[2:55] my remembrance I'm like oh thank you
[2:57] Jesus like whatever burden it was it
[2:59] just left me and I felt like so free I
[3:02] was I was so free and happy so I prayed
[3:06] about it forget about it God answered it
[3:08] and then he brought it to my remembrance
[3:10] yeah I remember that service when you
[3:12] spoke in tongues I was led to the Lord
[3:14] to preach on spiritual gifts that
[3:16] morning I didn't preach on gifts for
[3:18] years probably and for some reason I
[3:20] remember working really hard on
[3:21] spiritual gifts on my sermon that
[3:23] Saturday the next morning I preach it
[3:25] and then everybody was in one Accord it
[3:28] was a great time of worship and then you
[3:29] spoke in tongues we prayed for the
[3:30] interpretation it never came but it was
[3:34] such a Vindication to me that I was
[3:36] under the right leadership of the Holy
[3:38] Spirit and then you know that tongue
[3:40] also had a major impact on Austin
[3:41] remember Austin's testimony that tongue
[3:44] actually kind of put the fear of God in
[3:46] him and then he left the church shortly
[3:47] after that
[3:48] and brother Austin admitted like he
[3:50] still was loving worldly music and he
[3:53] didn't love the music of God and of
[3:55] course we know God did a lot of things
[3:56] cleaning him out in Arizona God saved
[3:58] Lena and brought it all back here and
[4:01] now everything works together for good
[4:03] to them that love the Lord and I'd love
[4:05] to see how God was working on both sides
[4:07] working through your dad and working
[4:09] through you about the tongue both had
[4:11] the same understanding this was God's
[4:13] confirmation that you are baptized with
[4:15] the Holy Ghost it reminds me of sister
[4:17] Bruce's interview in 1964 when brother
[4:20] Branham saw in the spiritual realm she
[4:22] was born again but brother man prayed
[4:23] God give her a chance to speak in
[4:25] tongues as a confirmation because in her
[4:28] spiritual composition she's the kind of
[4:29] person that would need a sign she would
[4:31] need something emotional to happen and I
[4:34] don't know if it ever did or not but I
[4:35] just thought it was very interesting
[4:36] brother random told her to pray for the
[4:39] gift to speak in tongues now we know in
[4:41] the in the message tongue is a minor
[4:43] gift but it's still a gift of God and
[4:45] it's still the Holy Ghost flowing
[4:46] through somebody but again this all
[4:48] shows us the importance of seeking God
[4:50] and our sisters sought for a sign that
[4:52] she was born again and God was faithful
[4:54] and brought it to her so we want to
[4:56] rejoice in that testimony that's a
[4:57] beautiful testimony
[5:03] next we'll look at a situation that's
[5:05] kind of personal to me my eldest
[5:07] daughter has been such a wonderful
[5:09] Christian example over the years and
[5:12] she's been baptized and filled with the
[5:14] Holy Ghost and just spent in subjection
[5:16] to everything in our home she's been a
[5:17] real good example for us a real model of
[5:20] Christianity but in one season of her
[5:22] life she went through a battle with
[5:23] confusion it was about a six-month
[5:25] battle with this Spirit of confusion she
[5:27] wasn't sure whether she was born again
[5:29] or not and we had prayed numerous times
[5:31] for her and the confusion remained and
[5:35] so God had allowed this test to continue
[5:37] but then one Sunday the Lord was working
[5:39] on sister Naomi's heart we didn't know
[5:42] it we found out later but then God moved
[5:45] using our sister Naomi's gifts and
[5:47] helped deliver my daughter brought her
[5:49] out of confusion into understanding so
[5:52] we'll have our sister share a little bit
[5:54] of background on what the Lord was
[5:55] dealing with her that morning
[5:57] okay so we came it was a Sunday morning
[5:59] we came to church and immediately I got
[6:01] into church I had like this strong
[6:04] feeling
[6:06] that I had to do something I wasn't sure
[6:08] what it was but it was it was so strong
[6:11] on me and then through the song service
[6:14] I was just crying I'm I was asking
[6:16] myself why am I crying I was
[6:19] like I felt I felt the strong power on
[6:22] me and I wasn't sure what it was through
[6:24] the service I was crying and I'm like
[6:26] what's going on so after the service you
[6:30] called us all in front to pray for her
[6:33] and then
[6:34] so immediately you called I was like oh
[6:36] this is what it was
[6:38] so we came forward and then we prayed it
[6:41] was it was good prayer we prayed and
[6:43] then afterwards we went back to our
[6:46] seats we sang and then
[6:48] as the service was ending it was
[6:50] something I I see a lot of my teenage
[6:53] years in her so I kind of relate I
[6:56] really relate with her
[6:58] and we've been talking but as the
[7:01] service was ending something was like go
[7:03] talk to her
[7:05] and I'm like what am I going to say to
[7:07] her her dad is the pastor she knows
[7:09] everything what am I going to say to her
[7:11] but the the edge was so strong and
[7:15] immediately church service and then I
[7:17] was praying but I just got out of my
[7:19] seat and went straight to her and when I
[7:20] was going I'm like what am I going to
[7:22] say to her what what do I have to say so
[7:25] we got there and then
[7:27] I don't know where the words came from
[7:29] but I believe it was from God and then
[7:32] we started talking and then the other
[7:35] sisters also came and then yeah we
[7:37] talked to her and after that I'm like I
[7:40] hope I hope the little we said was a
[7:42] blessing and she said yes it was
[7:44] so it was the next service that we came
[7:47] and then he gave the testimony that it
[7:49] was it was a really good help to her and
[7:51] I was like okay thank God and then
[7:53] afterwards after when I spoke to her
[7:56] like I felt relieved that whatever it
[7:59] was I've been able to accomplish it yeah
[8:01] when I think about that situation you
[8:03] know it was my own daughter coming up
[8:05] for prayer and I remember I was
[8:07] screaming and crying and I was praying
[8:09] for my daughter to get the Victory and I
[8:11] was just rebuking Satan as much as I
[8:13] could and just trusting in the Lord but
[8:15] I noticed you know even when we finish
[8:16] the prayer she was still a little bit
[8:18] looked sad to me I remember after the
[8:20] service I went in my office I came back
[8:22] out and then after a few minutes I came
[8:24] out of the sanctuary and I saw my oldest
[8:26] daughter and she was just glowing a big
[8:29] smile was all over her face and I
[8:31] thought wow maybe God did hear my prayer
[8:33] you know I was thinking maybe like the
[8:35] victory had to come through my prayer
[8:37] you know or something like that but it
[8:38] was a great prayer I mean all the saints
[8:40] were up here praying for my oldest
[8:42] daughter it was a wonderful prayer but
[8:43] when I went back and talked to her it
[8:44] seemed like God used a gift in our
[8:46] sister's life here since Mr Naomi's life
[8:48] Naomi's mother also gave her a word of
[8:50] wisdom and then another sister in our
[8:52] church sister who uh so it seemed like
[8:54] God used these sisters to team up and
[8:57] kind of bring their faith together to
[8:59] talk to my oldest daughter after service
[9:00] and I was thinking about the gifts of
[9:02] the Spirit how every person has a gift
[9:05] of the spirit all the brothers have a
[9:06] gift one of the nine gifts of the Spirit
[9:08] all the sisters have at least one gift
[9:09] to the spirit and when I talked to my
[9:11] oldest daughter she was saying she was
[9:13] in the state of confusion but when
[9:14] sister Naomi and sister Beatrice started
[9:17] talking and the other sisters it's as if
[9:19] all the confusion left well when you
[9:21] look at the scripture when confusion
[9:23] leaves understanding comes and there's a
[9:25] gift for understanding it's called The
[9:27] Gift of knowledge so God in that moment
[9:29] had given our sister Naomi and her
[9:30] mother and the other sisters an
[9:32] understanding of how to help my oldest
[9:34] daughter in that moment it wasn't
[9:36] something that would come through my
[9:37] preaching it wasn't something that was
[9:39] going to come through my prayer in
[9:40] particular God was anointing another
[9:42] member of the body with the same Holy
[9:44] Spirit and God was anointing all of our
[9:46] sisters to bring bring them to bring my
[9:48] oldest daughter words of wisdom and
[9:50] words of knowledge to help set her free
[9:52] and relieve her of all the confusion and
[9:55] now my oldest daughter is rejoicing in
[9:57] the Lord in the service of the Lord
[9:58] constantly serving the lord through her
[10:01] music Ministry often bringing others up
[10:04] in prayer in her role as a spiritual
[10:06] Priestess unto God
[10:08] because we're all Kings and Priests unto
[10:10] God and so God has used our sister Naomi
[10:12] and Beatrice and the other sisters the
[10:14] the gifts of the holy spirit in their
[10:16] lives to help my daughter be free and
[10:18] it's just led to a great season of
[10:20] blessing and peace and victory by God's
[10:22] grace
[10:23] foreign
[10:28] testimony where God used our sister
[10:30] Naomi and her mother was when my wife
[10:32] was expecting our eighth child in the
[10:34] fall of 2020. towards the end of this
[10:36] pregnancy our baby boy was transverse
[10:39] and we'd prayed about it and he wouldn't
[10:42] go head down and so this was quite
[10:44] alarming to my wife and I especially my
[10:46] wife because she was aware that if he
[10:50] doesn't go head down then she would have
[10:51] to have a C-section and anyone that's
[10:53] had a C-section or knows about
[10:54] C-sections knows their their major
[10:56] surgeries and the last thing I want as a
[10:59] husband is see my my wife cut and having
[11:01] to go through a major operation so we
[11:03] come to service on a Wednesday night I
[11:06] don't remember what I preached at all
[11:07] all I remember is that I was really
[11:09] afraid for my wife this is one time
[11:11] where I could say the spirit of fear was
[11:12] on me because I did not want to see my
[11:15] wife have to be cut
[11:17] and um I did not want a major surgery to
[11:21] happen at that time we had a ecv
[11:23] scheduled for the next day which would
[11:25] have been a Thursday and so I called my
[11:27] wife up for prayer and as my wife came
[11:30] up I kind of looked out into the uh the
[11:32] really small church congregation that we
[11:34] have
[11:35] and I think the only people that were in
[11:37] church that night uh because it's a
[11:38] Wednesday night a lot of our people work
[11:40] second shift the only people in church
[11:42] that night were Naomi and her mother
[11:43] Beatrice and so something just came on
[11:45] me I remember the quote where brother
[11:46] Branham said prayers are more effective
[11:49] when you can feel someone's pain
[11:51] and so he had said a mother who has
[11:54] experienced certain things can pray for
[11:56] another mother or a father could pray
[11:58] for another father because they feel it
[12:00] and so I looked out there you know and
[12:02] our sisters had their heads bowed and I
[12:04] thought of that quote from brother
[12:05] Brandon it just kind of came to me I
[12:06] felt like it was the Holy Spirit so I
[12:08] said
[12:08] uh sister Beatrice sister know me can
[12:10] you come up and pray for my wife she's
[12:12] got this ecv tomorrow
[12:15] and we were asking for God's grace and
[12:17] my wife so it goes successfully so my
[12:19] wife doesn't have to have a C-section
[12:21] the last thing we want is a C-section
[12:22] and so then we uh we called our sisters
[12:26] up for prayer
[12:27] okay so I I remember you called us up
[12:30] for prayer and then we came and we're
[12:32] praying and we all wept together and
[12:36] trusting God for a miracle and then
[12:39] after the prayer we hugged and
[12:42] and I could see like uncertainty and
[12:45] into the Christian's eyes like what's
[12:47] gonna happen and it's it's it broke my
[12:51] heart I'm like
[12:52] because I could I could I couldn't even
[12:55] imagine like what she was going to and
[12:58] then after the service we talked and
[13:00] even when we talked like I could I could
[13:03] feel it
[13:04] but then we kept encouraging her it's
[13:07] it's gonna be okay and then
[13:09] you know Satan comes to you okay now
[13:12] that you're telling her it's going to be
[13:13] okay what if it's not okay what if
[13:17] tomorrow she calls she text you or
[13:19] something and it's like a whole
[13:20] different thing so it means that
[13:22] whatever you're saying did not come true
[13:25] my mind we are trusting God we've prayed
[13:28] so the only thing we can do is to trust
[13:30] him and then be be confident that he's
[13:33] had our prayer and then he would answer
[13:35] it and then I remember my mom also
[13:38] talking to you about it and we went home
[13:40] and then we prayed
[13:42] so I did not touch them on Thursday
[13:46] it was on Friday that I texted her and I
[13:49] did not hear anything just still hoping
[13:51] that everything is going to be fine then
[13:54] he sent a picture of the baby I was like
[13:56] whoa
[13:58] when I saw the picture of the BB I just
[14:00] started crying I'm like wow
[14:03] that's that's how quick God can answer
[14:05] prayer it was it was amazing it was
[14:07] amazing yeah it really was a beautiful
[14:09] testimony because I know I was battling
[14:11] fear um and I remember walking out the
[14:14] church door to go outside and shook both
[14:17] your hands and either both of you or one
[14:20] of you just looked at me with such
[14:21] confidence and said all is well brother
[14:22] Jesse it's all going to turn out right
[14:25] and I appreciated your faith but in that
[14:28] moment I was just battling but your
[14:30] faith in that moment really lifted our
[14:32] faith I remember the next day we were
[14:34] driving down to Orville and I remember
[14:37] their prayer so I put on some Christian
[14:39] music and I was just trying to pray
[14:40] while we were going down there and we
[14:42] started seeing God's hand as soon as we
[14:44] got in the hospital for this ecv
[14:46] procedure as soon as we got in the room
[14:48] a nurse came in and somehow we started
[14:51] talking about Jesus right away so I
[14:53] started smiling I started feeling a lot
[14:55] better after that talked about Jesus
[14:57] talked about the Lord and everything was
[15:00] going good we just really felt confident
[15:03] you know we had to wear our ridiculous
[15:04] masks and everything like that but then
[15:06] when the doctor come in he was so kind
[15:08] he was so gentle and he just talked to
[15:11] us real briefly I felt like the
[15:13] atmosphere just stayed really really
[15:14] sweet and I remember he just walked over
[15:16] he took Zion's bottom in his head and
[15:19] just Twisted it
[15:20] he's like we're done
[15:22] like is it over
[15:24] and he's like yep he's all set to go
[15:26] he's head down now
[15:28] and I just started I don't know if I
[15:29] cried or what but I felt like crying I
[15:31] know I feel like crying now
[15:32] because I knew the words that our
[15:34] sisters had spoken and we'd prayed for
[15:36] had come to pass
[15:37] yeah so if this procedure would have not
[15:39] worked she would have had to been
[15:40] admitted for a C-section because our
[15:42] baby was late and so the next day was a
[15:45] Friday and that's the day baby eight
[15:47] came by God's grace little Zion so far
[15:50] we've been through three testimonies and
[15:52] then two of them have deeply impacted
[15:54] our family I remind our listeners that
[15:57] God sent sister Naomi thousands of miles
[15:59] across continents and placed her in our
[16:03] tiny little humble church and God Is Now
[16:06] using her and her gifts directly to
[16:09] impact our family my oldest daughter and
[16:11] now our youngest son as well by God's
[16:13] grace so this I'll encourage any
[16:15] listener God has ordered your footsteps
[16:18] the foot says the righteous are ordered
[16:19] of the Lord sometimes God may call you
[16:21] to leave the ones you love the most God
[16:23] May separate you from your family God
[16:25] May separate you from your Homeland but
[16:27] God has a purpose for your life and he
[16:29] he wants to use you to help support the
[16:31] body of Christ
[16:33] foreign
[16:38] let's go to our next testimony we
[16:40] remember when brother Randy was here as
[16:42] our guest preacher and
[16:44] your daughter Eden got sick with a fever
[16:46] and could you talk about that and how
[16:48] God healed her from her fever so my
[16:51] daughter had had fever for I think three
[16:53] or four days and
[16:55] I was starting to get concerned because
[16:57] she didn't look like she was getting
[16:59] better she was getting weaker and weaker
[17:01] every day and she could get like so hot
[17:05] and I was thinking of taking it to the
[17:07] hospital to the emergency
[17:09] because it wasn't getting better and
[17:11] that evening we came for it was a
[17:13] special service we were having and then
[17:15] we came to church and
[17:18] she was sleeping the whole time and
[17:21] she was so hot like I could feel her
[17:23] body heat she was so hot
[17:25] and I was I was like
[17:28] should I take her to the hospital
[17:30] because
[17:31] it wasn't it wasn't too good and she was
[17:35] she was sleeping the whole time she
[17:37] wasn't active or anything
[17:39] and then after the service
[17:42] they said if you have need of prayer
[17:44] come up so I brought her up
[17:46] and then
[17:48] we prayed
[17:50] and then immediately I went back to my
[17:52] seat I realized her body temperature had
[17:55] normalized like she was she was no
[17:57] longer as hard as she she was
[18:00] and then I mean through the service she
[18:02] was sleeping
[18:04] she got up and then she started singing
[18:06] and clapping her hands and I was like
[18:08] whoa
[18:10] okay
[18:12] and then after church she was talking to
[18:15] she was talking to the kids
[18:17] and this is something she hasn't done in
[18:19] like three four days and I was like wow
[18:22] so I was like God healed her and you
[18:25] know Satan always comes what if it's
[18:28] your mind maybe she's just
[18:30] I'm like no this is not how she came to
[18:33] church I was like okay let's wait till
[18:35] the next day and see
[18:37] so I had a little bit of Doubt God
[18:39] forgive me
[18:40] and then the next day she was fine she
[18:43] was playing with her sisters and I was
[18:44] like she actually got healed she was she
[18:48] was healed I I can I can Satan can talk
[18:51] me out of it she was healed because she
[18:54] had had it for a couple of days so to
[18:55] see her like instantly
[18:58] changing then start playing and talking
[19:02] with her sisters yeah God definitely
[19:04] healed her yes this testimony again
[19:07] shows us how Jesus Christ is the same
[19:08] yesterday today and forever I mean over
[19:11] the years how many people have we prayed
[19:12] for with fevers right and I always go to
[19:14] I always think of the scripture where
[19:15] Jesus laid his hands on Peter's
[19:17] mother-in-law when she had a fever and
[19:19] she was instantly healed and what did
[19:21] you she instantly got up and served and
[19:23] so in Eden's case she was prayed for
[19:25] Jesus touched her and she instantly got
[19:28] up and praised the Lord and she's been
[19:30] praising the Lord ever since that's
[19:31] right by God's grace singing and
[19:33] worshiping the Lord how she does so
[19:35] we're very grateful for how the Lord
[19:36] Jesus Christ healed her proving that
[19:39] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[19:41] and forever now we've prayed for
[19:43] different fevers and the people get well
[19:44] the next day but never had we seen one
[19:46] instantly this was the first time we'd
[19:48] ever seen someone lay their hands on the
[19:52] sick with a fever and the the child
[19:54] instantly recovered and so we just
[19:56] rejoiced in that this was a great
[19:58] testimony you know for Naomi's family
[19:59] but also for brother Randy I share with
[20:01] brother Randy it was a great blessing to
[20:03] him he had never had that type of what
[20:05] we would call like a miracle because
[20:07] it's instantaneous there was no medicine
[20:09] involved or anything like that it was
[20:10] just instant power of God to take down
[20:13] the body temperature so I know that was
[20:15] a great blessing to him and that was a
[20:17] great way to start off our weekend
[20:18] because we had uh we had Services uh
[20:21] Friday Saturday Sunday and that was a
[20:23] Friday night service it led into the
[20:24] Saturday night where brother Randy gave
[20:26] his testimony we had a long line I
[20:27] remember we had like eight to ten people
[20:29] come up for prayer and it was just a
[20:31] highly anointed service
[20:32] and God God used our brother in a great
[20:35] way and of course we have to say God
[20:37] used our sister's Faith as well because
[20:39] she had Faith to bring the child to
[20:40] church
[20:41] after three or four days of having a
[20:43] fever and then bring her up for prayer
[20:45] so it's again a great testimony of uh of
[20:48] God using someone's faith
[20:50] to bring about supernatural work by the
[20:52] Holy Spirit
[20:54] foreign
[20:58] for the fifth testimony we want to look
[21:00] at a testimony relating to Sister Nomi
[21:02] as a mother and like all mothers you
[21:05] know she desires her children to be
[21:06] saved and baptized Sanctified filled
[21:08] with the holy spirit so in October 2021
[21:11] it was a Wednesday night service and
[21:14] that was the night where the Lord moved
[21:16] on two of Naomi's daughters to be
[21:18] baptized so we'd like her to be able to
[21:19] share about that God had been working on
[21:21] them for over a year and we think this
[21:23] would be a wonderful testimony
[21:25] encouraging our parents to wait upon the
[21:27] Lord seek the Lord for their children's
[21:29] salvation and trust that God hears all
[21:32] of our prayers and he'll save our
[21:34] children
[21:34] so my oldest daughter had been asking to
[21:38] be baptized I think probably when she
[21:41] turned six
[21:42] but I thought she was she was too young
[21:44] and I wondered whether she understood
[21:46] what
[21:47] baptism was all about she had asked a
[21:50] couple of times sometimes at home when
[21:52] we are praying she would cry and say she
[21:55] wants to be baptized by
[21:57] I always felt like it wasn't the right
[21:59] time she probably did not understand
[22:00] what she wanted
[22:02] and then I remember some time too she
[22:05] came to church and I had no idea she had
[22:07] done this but she went to the pastor and
[22:09] told the pastor she wanted to be
[22:11] baptized
[22:12] that was after church that the pastor
[22:15] told me and I was like oh okay
[22:18] and I did not want it to be like I was
[22:20] hindering her from
[22:22] getting baptized but I wanted her to
[22:24] also understand
[22:26] I wanted to be sure that she understood
[22:28] what the baptism was about so she had
[22:31] done it for a while and then one time
[22:34] we're praying at home and then after the
[22:37] prayer she was like I wonder when I
[22:40] could ever get baptized and I felt so
[22:43] bad I'm like am I preventing her so I
[22:46] started praying about it
[22:48] I'm like good like show me if it is time
[22:53] for her to baptize to be baptized if she
[22:55] understands what she's trying to get
[22:57] into
[22:58] then after a while
[23:00] my second daughter also started so I was
[23:02] like oh she's probably copying her older
[23:05] sister that was the first thing that
[23:07] came to my mind she's copying her older
[23:09] sister so I remember
[23:11] um it was in the I think in 2020
[23:16] she had asked I think she that was when
[23:18] she went to the pasture to Accent then I
[23:21] remember you said you had gone to um
[23:23] take your friends is it like a tub or a
[23:27] pool something so she went to the she
[23:30] came to you to ask to be baptized and
[23:33] then you talked to me about it and I was
[23:34] I wasn't too sure but I mean once she
[23:37] had come forward to she was bold enough
[23:40] to come to you to ask I was like okay
[23:42] and then I think we had scheduled it
[23:45] then I went to talk to her and I I kind
[23:48] of talked her out of it
[23:50] because I felt like she was not ready
[23:52] then she was like oh okay yeah she's not
[23:54] ready for it
[23:56] so I think I came back to you and told
[23:58] you she's not ready so
[24:00] she you took it back and then we we had
[24:03] been going back and forth with it she's
[24:05] been coming to tell me she wanted to get
[24:07] baptized and
[24:08] I always brush it off so that Wednesday
[24:11] service we came and then you preached
[24:13] about repentance and salvation and it
[24:15] was just a few of us in the church and
[24:18] my eyes were closed after the service we
[24:21] were praying my eyes were closed and
[24:22] then you asked if anybody wanted to be
[24:25] baptized
[24:26] and then my eyes were closed I heard you
[24:29] say two people have lifted up their
[24:31] hands and I'm like
[24:32] who are these
[24:34] I'm definitely sure nature is one but
[24:37] who is the second person
[24:39] and I knew your daughters to like those
[24:42] who were old enough were already
[24:44] baptized so I was like
[24:46] I I never thought it was my second
[24:48] daughter no way
[24:49] so when you called for me to come and I
[24:52] opened my eyes and I'm like
[24:54] I was like whoa okay I mean and and the
[24:59] spirit of God like the presence of God
[25:00] was so strong in that service so
[25:03] I mean if she had lifted up she has
[25:05] lifted up her hands then
[25:07] I I couldn't object it and I was I had
[25:10] been praying about it I'm like God I
[25:12] want to be sure that this is it so I
[25:16] believe that Wednesday evening was an
[25:18] answer to prayer and then
[25:20] we prayed and days after service I
[25:23] talked to them and they seemed like they
[25:25] really understood what they wanted to do
[25:27] so by God's grace they got baptized then
[25:31] it was awesome I felt like it was just
[25:34] the right time for them to do it like
[25:36] God had answered my prayer and it was
[25:38] the right timing and it wasn't just for
[25:40] the one I was praying for but it was for
[25:43] both so very thankful for that
[25:46] yeah so it kind of turned out to be a
[25:47] double blessing right you know you we we
[25:49] knew for sure you knew for sure one of
[25:51] them wanted to be baptized and then it's
[25:53] like God was gracious and gave you the
[25:55] other daughter to be baptized as well
[25:57] that was certainly a highly anointed
[25:59] service see how the spirit of the Lord
[26:00] was dealing heavy with me on my on my
[26:03] heart because we had visitors and I
[26:05] wanted them to hear the gospel and it
[26:06] fit what the series I was currently
[26:08] teaching at that time so I labored on
[26:10] what real repentance is
[26:11] I think I went through like 23 examples
[26:13] of sins that keep you from getting the
[26:15] Holy Ghost and at the end I since we had
[26:19] visitors I wanted to invite anyone to
[26:20] get saved or baptized and the first two
[26:23] hands I saw love for
[26:25] Naomi's daughters and it was such a
[26:27] special moment I still remember I
[26:28] kneeled down and started talking to them
[26:30] about the Lord and we're all crying it
[26:33] was such a beautiful anointing of the
[26:35] holy spirit because I realized these are
[26:37] really sincere genuine Hearts coming to
[26:40] the Lord
[26:41] I always think about my life I couldn't
[26:42] surrender I wanted to surrender to God
[26:43] before many times in my life but I never
[26:46] could surrender so it just made me full
[26:48] of joy to see a seven-year-old and a
[26:51] five-year-old weeping as I pray and lead
[26:53] them through this a sinner's prayer from
[26:55] the scripture just how we're we're all
[26:57] guilty of sin we all just we all fall
[26:59] short of the glory of God but Jesus died
[27:00] for me
[27:01] and the cross paid for all my sins and
[27:05] took away all my transgressions and now
[27:07] I'm saved I'm going to heaven and I'm
[27:09] such a wonderful moment and then the
[27:11] visitor's daughter came up for prayer as
[27:13] well and I led her in the very similar
[27:15] prayer repented of her sins and then it
[27:18] was a maybe a week or two later and we
[27:20] went out to the lake and baptized him in
[27:23] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[27:24] you know your two daughters have been
[27:26] here Faithfully serving God singing with
[27:30] all their hearts all the boldness in
[27:31] their hearts praising the Lord they've
[27:34] just been wonderful examples of
[27:35] Christians feet washing taking communion
[27:38] asking great Bible questions whenever we
[27:40] do the children's Bible studies ask
[27:41] great questions and have a lot of
[27:44] understanding of the scriptures we've
[27:46] had visitors come and notice how these
[27:49] children in particular and all the
[27:50] children but Naomi's children in
[27:51] particular have a lot of biblical
[27:53] knowledge and a lot of biblical
[27:55] understanding and so God has given them
[27:58] a lot of understanding for their age and
[28:00] so people can notice that that the
[28:02] spirit of God is working on them and
[28:04] drawing them closer to him so we rejoice
[28:06] in a Mother's desire for her children's
[28:10] baptism to be sincere and genuine her
[28:13] patience to wait on the Lord and most
[28:15] importantly God's faithfulness to save
[28:17] the Sheep
[28:23] let's get to our last testimony and our
[28:25] last testimony happened
[28:27] in February of this year and it's our
[28:30] most recent one and we're thankful that
[28:32] God answered our prayer and you sister
[28:34] Naomi's to answer this prayer and could
[28:36] you go more into that with that sister
[28:37] on me of what happened during the
[28:39] service and what led you to pray for
[28:42] sister Lino's mom it was a it was a
[28:45] Wednesday service and then
[28:48] after this someone he she came up
[28:51] instantly and I came up for prayer
[28:54] and then I remember
[28:56] Jesse calling us to come and pray with
[28:59] her when he called I was like wow um
[29:02] I mean he has he has that confidence to
[29:05] call
[29:06] to to pray with her so
[29:09] we came and then we all prayed it was I
[29:12] mean everyone in the church we all came
[29:14] and then we prayed and it was it was it
[29:17] was quite an intense prayer
[29:20] so it was the next day I received a text
[29:22] from
[29:23] from the pastor that
[29:25] she had been found and
[29:27] I remember I was sitting in the house
[29:29] and I just started crying I'm like it is
[29:32] it is amazing to know that in our own
[29:36] little humble way when we pray like this
[29:40] big God hears us and he's concerned
[29:43] about us to to answer our prayers I mean
[29:46] he doesn't have to but it is comforting
[29:49] to know that we can we can go into his
[29:51] presence and go there with confidence
[29:53] and live with the assurance that he
[29:56] answers prayers and and once we pray
[29:59] With all sincerity he would answer it
[30:02] and what amazed me is how quickly he
[30:04] answered it like how quickly and I think
[30:07] so so you had been preaching at the
[30:10] beginning of the year the disciple whom
[30:11] Jesus loved and then you put us in there
[30:14] that we are loved of the Lord so it was
[30:17] it was really
[30:19] um encouraging to me to know that we are
[30:21] loved of the Lord and he listens to us
[30:24] when we pray and he's he's gracious
[30:26] enough to answer our prayers like that
[30:29] quickly it was It was a
[30:31] a big blessing to me
[30:34] yeah again that was a very highly
[30:35] anointed Wednesday night service as well
[30:37] that's what I've been sharing with the
[30:38] church and just as a reminder to all of
[30:40] us I need the reminder too but God can
[30:42] move any day of the week it don't have
[30:43] to be Sunday morning you know usually we
[30:45] have the most strength on Sunday morning
[30:47] but God has really been moving a lot on
[30:49] Wednesday nights and also Sunday nights
[30:52] you know but from my perspective you
[30:54] know I had I heard Lena's requests and
[30:56] it was for her mother she's bound this
[30:58] sickness and just drove away and Nina
[31:02] didn't know where her mother was and
[31:04] she'd been missing for numerous days and
[31:06] so this was a and with her disease it
[31:08] was a very desperate moment
[31:10] Lena didn't want to lose her mom so
[31:12] before service Lena's boyfriend Austin
[31:15] had asked me to pray for Lena's mother
[31:17] who had been missing for a couple of
[31:19] days due to her disease she took the car
[31:21] and left and brother Austin had said can
[31:23] you and brother Jose pray for her mother
[31:26] that she'll be found and so I said yeah
[31:28] brother I said at the end of the service
[31:29] we'll do that well our brother Jose
[31:31] wasn't able to make service that night
[31:32] and as we were closing service I'd
[31:34] preached about the disciple whom Jesus
[31:35] loved and as I was leaving stepping away
[31:38] from the pulpit I remembered that's
[31:39] right Austin wanted me to pray for
[31:41] Lena's mom
[31:42] so then I announced it and I invited up
[31:45] all the saints sister Naomi sister
[31:47] Beatrice sister Lena brother Austin and
[31:50] we just came up here to the front and I
[31:51] said let's just join hands and let's
[31:53] plead for Lena's mother's life and we
[31:55] just join hands and as we prayed uh the
[31:59] prayer got more and more sincere more
[32:02] desperate we must have prayed for 5 10
[32:05] 15 minutes I don't know how long we
[32:06] prayed but I Remember by the time we got
[32:07] done my hands were hurting because I was
[32:09] squeezing squeezing Austin's hands so
[32:11] hard
[32:11] just believing in faith just crying out
[32:14] that God will save this lost mother and
[32:18] as we pray the prayers got louder and
[32:20] more intense than our the Holy Spirit
[32:21] came on sister know me and she shouted
[32:23] out twice she said Jesus
[32:25] Jesus
[32:26] and that's when we really started crying
[32:28] and really started praying I heard Lena
[32:30] crying and praying shouting and
[32:32] rejoicing I was shouting and we were
[32:35] just really moved by the Holy Spirit it
[32:37] was one of those just special moments
[32:39] where you know like you know God's
[32:41] presence was there and then brother
[32:43] Austin started shouting Satan get out
[32:46] Satan get out Satan get out and he was
[32:49] shouting at the top of his lungs
[32:52] and so I just recognized that he was he
[32:55] was rebuking Satan and uh and so we
[32:58] prayed we were you know all crying and
[32:59] then we brought it to a close and then
[33:01] the next day I got a text from from
[33:03] Sister Lina and brother Austin saying
[33:05] that the cops had found her mother thank
[33:08] God she was alive and uh right there I
[33:11] just started rejoicing praising the Lord
[33:13] and again just I was so encouraged
[33:15] because God had answered a prayer so
[33:18] quickly and Lena's sister then called me
[33:20] the next day and I gave her some
[33:22] Biblical scriptures about how her mom
[33:24] can repent of certain things that she'd
[33:27] done and so I gave her a list of
[33:29] scriptures
[33:30] and uh Nina's sister shared it with her
[33:33] mother and a few days after that Lena's
[33:35] mother called her and apologized for a
[33:37] few things she had done and so after I
[33:39] heard that I was even more blessed
[33:41] because when I went back to the prayer
[33:43] that we had that Wednesday night our
[33:45] sister Naomi was shouting Jesus Jesus
[33:47] Jesus dropped down and then also was out
[33:50] shouting Satan get out Satan get out for
[33:51] the wrongs Lena's mother had done she
[33:54] repented of those and so it was like
[33:56] Jesus came down
[33:57] and then Satan had to leave and Lena's
[34:01] mother was able to get repentance and
[34:04] forgiveness through that situation a
[34:06] wonderful testimony by the grace of God
[34:09] foreign
[34:14] ful testimonies that the Lord has done
[34:17] of course these are not all the
[34:18] testimonies but these are the ones that
[34:19] I could think of on a short notice and
[34:22] we're so thankful God has used our
[34:23] sister in these wonderful ways it
[34:25] reminds me when brother random said
[34:26] sisters
[34:27] can be used by God in all nine gifts of
[34:30] the Holy Spirit and of course you find
[34:31] that in the Bible Philip had four virgin
[34:34] daughters who prophesied Anna was a
[34:36] prophetess in the time of the birth of
[34:38] our Lord Jesus God used her through
[34:40] prophecy and revelation
[34:42] whenever each time you may have no
[34:44] questions to get to it if I can but this
[34:47] was an important question I want to know
[34:49] if it was wrong for women to test people
[34:51] or to sing or give messages
[34:56] or prophecy and the church no it isn't
[35:00] wrong it's uh as long as it comes in the
[35:02] place of order I think the church is an
[35:05] honor and not only when
[35:08] the real true way to do it is for those
[35:10] who speak with tongues and things their
[35:12] messages are given before the message
[35:14] from the pulpits never doing that town
[35:16] called the holy spirit's moving just
[35:18] from one place
[35:20] up there but women are
[35:23] activities with prophecy and gifted with
[35:26] tongues and interpret interpretations
[35:27] and everything with new preachers
[35:30] they're not to be preachers they're
[35:32] forbidden to preach in the churches
[35:34] that's right basically or be a teacher
[35:36] or anything in the church but as far
[35:38] against the woman has all those that can
[35:41] occupy one or any of those nine
[35:43] spiritual gift cards First Corinthians
[35:45] 12
[35:48] times message should not come forth in
[35:51] its place it's in each message waits for
[35:53] its Clues
[35:55] [Laughter]
[36:08] he comes forward begins to move through
[36:11] him see then when he's finished then
[36:13] messages again come here than just
[36:15] before it's the only reason
[36:17] I've always been a woman does have life
[36:21] and so we fell our sister's testimony
[36:23] would be a great encouragement to other
[36:25] sisters in the message who want to be
[36:27] used by God they want to see their
[36:29] families saved and they want the Lord
[36:31] Jesus Christ to have full preeminence in
[36:33] their lives so sister as we close are
[36:36] there some words of encouragement we
[36:37] want to give to other sisters who in the
[36:39] message and who are Desiring for the
[36:41] Lord Jesus Christ to use them in a
[36:44] wonderful way to be a blessing to others
[36:46] and just be led by the Holy Spirit
[36:48] okay I would say that you
[36:51] you should know God for yourself and and
[36:53] hold on to him
[36:55] don't let anybody or any situation talk
[36:58] you out of it like be convinced and then
[37:01] hold on hold on to your faith
[37:04] if you're not rock solid then whatever
[37:06] trial whatever situation that comes you
[37:09] find yourself wavering so no God and
[37:12] then be sincere I I strongly believe
[37:15] that God honors the sincerity of our
[37:18] hearts be as sincere as possible and and
[37:21] put God first I mean yeah you're going
[37:24] to fall short so many times but
[37:27] it's your sincerity with God that is
[37:29] that is what will help you come out of
[37:32] those shortfalls
[37:33] and then um believe in your prayer I
[37:36] mean of course most of the time we fill
[37:39] in adequate we feel like and when you're
[37:42] called up for prayer or you're praying
[37:44] that's when Satan brings up like all the
[37:47] wrongs that you have done
[37:49] and it's kind of
[37:51] shakes you up a bit you're wondering if
[37:53] God is actually listening but then the
[37:56] blood of Jesus has taken care of that
[37:57] the Bible says once we confess our sins
[37:59] is faithful and just to forgive us I had
[38:02] a preacher say that God forgives us but
[38:04] you have to also forgive yourself you
[38:06] have to get past the guilt so once you
[38:10] confess your sins and you come to God in
[38:12] sincerity like believe in your prayer
[38:14] believe that God answers when you come
[38:17] into the presence of God in your prayer
[38:18] you pray with all confidence that God
[38:21] will answer it he may not answer it
[38:24] there and then but he definitely has had
[38:27] it and at the right time he's gonna
[38:30] answer it so have have confidence in the
[38:32] god that she said amen praise the Lord
[38:35] sister thanks for sharing what was on
[38:36] your heart to be an encouragement to our
[38:38] sisters you know your words remind me of
[38:40] Hebrews 10 35 cast not away therefore
[38:43] your confidence which hath great
[38:45] recompense of reward such an
[38:47] encouragement for us to have confidence
[38:49] in Christ he died so we could have
[38:51] confidence in him he sent us holy ghost
[38:53] so we could have confidence in him so we
[38:56] follow Philippians 2 12 like you
[38:58] suggested in part two how that
[39:00] scriptures helped you so much if we
[39:01] approach the Lord with fear and
[39:02] trembling working out our own salvation
[39:04] and if we keep the confidence in the
[39:06] Lord Jesus Christ then surely God will
[39:08] perform his perfect will in our lives
[39:09] and we can have rejoicing and that God
[39:11] is in full control of our lives and give
[39:13] us the victory

[39:32] you in everything you do praise the Lord
