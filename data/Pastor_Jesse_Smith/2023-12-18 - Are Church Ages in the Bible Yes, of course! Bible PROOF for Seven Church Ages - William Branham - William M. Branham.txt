TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] we're going to write a commentary on the seven Church agents to S to all the world that we can and the Holy Spirit began to reveal to me to to warn the people and to place this greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to answer the question our church ages in the Bible of course the answer is yes and anyone that knows my Ministry would know that I believe in the seven Gentile Church ages by God's grace I'll show Bible support for this but my name is Pastor Jesse Smith I pastored bride of Christ Fellowship here in akan Ohio for the last 17 years and I defend the Bible revelations that Jesus Christ revealed to his Prophet The Late William brandham who lived from 1909 to 1965 recently as I've listened to podcasts and videos of the people that have left the message I call them brother Ram's accusers I've heard numerous people say the church ages are not in the Bible and Friends it Grieves my spirit and just shocks me that these people cannot find the church ages in the Bible so I thought I'd make this video by the grace of God as a help hopefully to them and anyone else who has questions about whether or not the church ages are in the Bible most of the proof on this subject came from my studies and what I wrote in my 2021 book it's in chapter 7 The Mystery of the seven stars and seven golden candlesticks most of this information is on page 407 through 415 beginning on page 409 there's five proofs on the biblical evidence for the revelation of the Seven Stars and seven golden candlesticks and you can listen this for free on my YouTube channel the book's available on Amazon I'm not a book salesman so if you can't afford it I'll send you a free PDF copy of the book and on this video I'm going to summarize the main points about the seven Church ages the first point is that Jesus calls these seven stars seven angels proving their seven literal men because Jesus said unto the angel of the Church of Ephesus write why would Jesus tell John to author a handwritten letter to a Heavenly Angel at Ephesus God speaks directly to Heavenly Angels sending them from his throne to minister to Believers the Lord does not need men to write letters to Angels second the seven angels are symbolic of human preachers because sometimes human preachers are referred to as angels in scripture the word angel means messenger and John the Baptist is called God's messenger in Matthew 11:10 the prophet David is called an angel of God twice 1st Samuel 299 2 Samuel 19:27 Paul says the Galatians received him as an angel of God in Galatians 4:14 and then the angel that showed John all the revelations in the Book of Revelation was called a prophet in Revelation 22: 8 and 9 the third fact is that God uses men to help save men Angels assist men but men are God's primary tool for sharing his way to Salvation like Romans 10:14 says how should they hear without a preacher fourth notice the location of the Seven Stars they're in Jesus's right hand God's right hand of power or authority is reserved for Christ and the men that would inherit God's power as winess es of his resurrection it's according to Acts 1:8 and acts 4:33 and lastly Abraham's seed are faithfield humans are referred to as stars in Genesis 15:5 Daniel 12:3 also says the saved and soul winners are like stars and in John 5:35 John the Baptist is called a burning and Shining Light and that's what a star is next Jesus interprets the seven golden candlesticks as seven churches they are seven Gentile cities located in Turkey notice that no Jewish churches are mentioned because John wrote this around 95 ad and God had already blinded Israel or the Jews because of their unbelief and turned to the Gentiles nearly 50 years prior that's according to acts 13: 14- 48 and Romans 11: 1-8 and Romans 11: 25-29 Jesus Christ calls God's Focus on saving the Gentiles the times of the Gentiles in Luke 21:24 so another synonym for church ages is times of the Gentiles you can use either one so Jesus Calls the time God is dealing with the Gentiles after he blinded Israel he calls it the times of the Gentiles and then he tells us there are seven Church ages during this times of the Gentiles then the Bible said he'll go back to Israel after the last Gentile Believers are saved according to Luke 21:24 and Romans 11 as mentioned earlier also in Matthew 21: 33-46 Jesus plainly teaches he's going to take the Kingdom from Israel and give it to the Gentiles notice Jesus and Paul teach the times of the Gentiles or the church ages have an ending point again that's Luke 21:24 where Jesus said it and it's Romans 11:25 where Paul said it so the times of the Gentiles are also called seven Church ages notice there are seven churches the many member Gentile bride is called Jesus's Church on many occasions but most notably in Romans 16:16 Ephesians 3:21 and Ephesians 5: 23-32 again proving the term Church ages is biblical and maybe most importantly the scriptures that literally call them ages are found in Ephesians 3:5 Colossians 1:26 and Ephesians 3: 21 now it just struck me one reason the accusers of brother Bram may not believe in church ages is because they read the wrong Bible translations the wrong Bible versions I was looking online earlier and some of the modern Bible versions do not use the word ages but if you read the King James version it uses the word ages and that's where we get it and that's where we get the terminology for church ages or times of the Gentiles so twice Paul says the Old Testament had ages in Ephesians 3:5 and Colossians 126 and then in Ephesians 3:21 Paul says unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages World Without End so two verses speak of past ages Ephesians 3:5 Colossians 1:26 and Ephesians 3:21 speaks of all future ages so if there is past ages and future ages there must be ages now so again the Bible plainly teaches there are Church ages any person that would deny that is either dishonest or completely ignorant of the Bible the scripture also foretold this 2,000-year Gentile Church ages in Hosea 6: 1-3 the Bible said God will revive Israel on the third day or after the 2,000 years of dealing with the Gentiles because one day is with the Lord as a thousand years second Peter 3:8 that verse also goes with acts 2:17 how Peter said this spirit will be poured out in the last days or the last 2,000 years before God goes back to Israel and Paul said in the last days perilous times shall come in 2 Timothy 3:1 again days speaking of 2,000 years notice in Revelation 1: 13 through 16 Jesus's location is standing in the midst of the seven candlesticks proving his constant presence with the one Church of Jesus Christ Jesus stands with the church during the seven Church ages this is what he also promised in Matthew 28:20 he said Lo I'm with you always even unto end of the world in Hebrews 13 says he would never leave us nor forsake us also beginning on pages 412 through 415 I show three applications for the seven letters the seven letters to the seven Gentile cities have three applications first they applied literally to the Christians around 95 ad or whenever John wrote those letters some people say 90 ad some people say 100 AD but they literally appli to those seven Gentile churches the second interpretation they were prophetic to the Future ages there's three simple clear-cut examples that prove this first Jesus warned the church in samna would have tribulation 10 days but must be faithful unto death in Revelation 2:10 the 10 days are historically accurate in one or two ways either the 10 persecutions on the anti- Nan church or Diocesan 10year persecution the Bible says one day can be symbolic of a year that's in numbers 14:34 and Ezekiel 4: 5 and 6 second Jesus foretold there would be an openo missionary age to the Church of Philadelphia and this was from 1750 to 1906 during this age the world saw the greatest missionary efforts through men like William kery and David Livingstone the final example is a lukewarm condition of the final Church age leoa which represents today's churches falling away from the faith putting Jesus's Spirit outside of their churches and this lines up with jesus' Prophecy of the end times in Luke 18:8 Jesus said when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth third and finally the seven letters speak prophetically to individuals in all ages every honest Christian knows what it's like to desire to return to his first love as taught in Revelation 2:4 we all gain inspiration from Sam's letter that tells us to fear none of those things which we shall suffer in Revelation 28-10 and all Christians benefit from the warning to Le oysa against lukewarmness and that they must constantly strive to be on fire for Jesus's sake and the lukewarm condition was of course mentioned in Revelation 3:16 the letter to the church at Le oia and I want to remind all of our viewers that I have numerous videos about the church ages I have a video about the Book of Revelation all 22 chapters but especially the video on the church ages in chapters 2 and three I have a video about did Columba live during his church age I have another video about the seven Church ages being foreshadowed in the Old Testament and lastly I have a video about how brother Brandon received revelation of the seven Church ages from the Lord and how he reference some of Clarence larin's work to preach the seven Church ages brother Brandon referenced historians over 20 times when he preached the seven Church ages he referenced Lin's work on at least three occasions although he didn't use the name Lin later he did later he than Lin for his work on Daniel 70 weeks and the Seven Seals and brother Ram said he got the dates of the seven Church ages from historians but he says the revelation of The Messengers came from the Holy Spirit and that's accurate by God's grace I'll try to leave those links there in the description for you in closing I hope this short video has been a blessing friends again it just broke my heart when I heard these accusers of brother brandham say the church ages are not in the Bible made me incredibly sad I was shocked and it just goes to show many of these people never really studied the Bible they call themselves bereans but they really don't search the scriptures with an open heart possibly they're using the wrong Bible from my experience talking with these people they will only only research the negative information about brother brandom the gossip about brother brandham the slander about brother brandham and they will not read the two books I've written about the bible-based ministry of brother brandham they won't read research that supports brother brandham they only want to criticize brother brandom and so I'll end this video with a prayer for them dear heavenly father I pray God your Holy Spirit would have mercy on these accusers of brother brandham may they open their hearts to the word of God and may they open their Bibles with an honest heart and believe the holy scriptures father forgive them many of them don't know what they're doing and I pray this video could be used to help some we know all that the father has given to Jesus will come so I pray for them that they will come to know you come to recognize the truth and I ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your [Music] heart
