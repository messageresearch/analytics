[0:03] Jesus Christ was talking and God was
[0:06] talking in him also. Sometimes it was
[0:09] Christ himself. Sometimes it was the
[0:11] father that dwelt in him. You see, and
[0:13] he they couldn't understand some things
[0:16] he would say. They talked in riddles to
[0:18] them.
[0:20] Greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:22] of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of
[0:25] this video is to answer a viewer's
[0:27] question about Hebrews 1:8. Does Hebrews
[0:30] 1 prove that God is a trinity? The
[0:33] answer is again, no. Similar to the
[0:35] video that I did recently about John 17.
[0:39] In fact, it was the same viewer asked
[0:40] about both texts. And so, in the
[0:43] previous video, I forgot to talk about
[0:44] Hebrews 1. So, I'll make a separate
[0:46] video here on Hebrews 1. by the grace of
[0:48] God. Hebrews 1:8 is a quotation of Psalm
[0:53] 45:6.
[0:55] Thy throne, oh God, is forever and ever.
[0:57] The scepter of thy kingdom is a right
[1:00] scepter. So no, Hebrews 1:8 does not
[1:05] show two persons talking in the Godhead,
[1:08] but it does show God's invisible spirit
[1:11] speaking to his visible son. If you have
[1:14] two persons talking in Hebrews 1:5, you
[1:17] have tri-theism, which is the worship of
[1:20] three separate gods, it's polytheism.
[1:23] Because remember the erroneous
[1:25] definition of the trinity is three
[1:28] co-equal, co-eternal persons. And in the
[1:32] previous video, we saw the illogical
[1:35] application of that thought. The example
[1:37] was when Jesus was filled with the
[1:40] spirit of God. According to the
[1:42] definition of the trinity, he was
[1:43] already co-equal with the spirit of God.
[1:46] So why does one co-equal person need
[1:49] filled with a second co-equal person?
[1:51] And then Jesus said in the book of John
[1:53] that the father dwelt in him as well. So
[1:56] now we have one fully God person being
[1:59] filled with two other fully co-equal
[2:02] persons. That makes no sense. Why does a
[2:05] person who's already co-equal with God
[2:07] need to be filled with two other
[2:09] co-equal gods? That's heathenism. There
[2:12] is only one God according to the
[2:14] scripture. There's only one person in
[2:16] the Godhead. As Hebrews 1:3 says, that's
[2:19] been my challenge to trinitarians ever
[2:21] since I received the truth of the Bible
[2:24] through the ministry of God's prophet,
[2:25] Brother William Brandham. Show me one
[2:27] verse that says God is three persons and
[2:30] trinitarians cannot do it because they
[2:32] have no Bible verse that says that. I
[2:35] love how brother Brandham explained
[2:36] this. He said with Jesus he was fully
[2:38] man and also fully God. He said
[2:41] sometimes the body was talking. In other
[2:43] words, sometimes the humanity was
[2:45] talking and sometimes the divinity was
[2:48] talking. So here's a quote on that. It's
[2:50] the curtain of time 1955. Brother Ram
[2:53] said the person Jesus Christ was talking
[2:55] and God was talking in him also.
[2:57] Sometimes it was Christ himself.
[2:59] Sometimes it was the father that dwelt
[3:02] in him. I like what brother Ram said. He
[3:04] talked in riddles to them. One time he
[3:07] said, "I come from God and I go back to
[3:09] God." Of course, that's in the book of
[3:10] John. The person Jesus Christ was
[3:15] talking and God was talking in him also.
[3:18] Sometimes it was Christ himself.
[3:20] Sometimes it was the father that dwelt
[3:22] in him.
[3:24] You see, and he they couldn't understand
[3:26] some things he would say. They talked in
[3:28] riddles to them. Jesus finally said when
[3:31] he was talking to him one day, I had
[3:33] came from God. I come into the world and
[3:38] I go back again to God.
[3:41] And friends, it is scriptural that Jesus
[3:44] spoke in riddles or mysteries. Matthew
[3:47] 13:34 and35 say, "All these things spake
[3:50] Jesus unto the multitudes in parables,
[3:53] and without a parable spake he not unto
[3:55] them, that it might be fulfilled, which
[3:56] was spoken by the prophet, saying, I
[3:58] will open my mouth in parables." And I
[4:01] love this, "I will utter things which
[4:02] have been kept secret from the
[4:04] foundation of the world." Matthew 13:35
[4:07] is a quotation of the Old Testament
[4:10] book, Psalm 78:2. Look at this prophecy
[4:13] of the Messiah. I will open my mouth in
[4:15] a parable. I will utter dark sayings of
[4:19] old. So Jesus was uttering secrets
[4:22] hidden from the foundation of the world.
[4:24] Now in the Hebrew dark sayings is
[4:27] defined as this, a riddle, difficult
[4:29] question, an enigma or hard to
[4:33] understand saying, a perplexing saying.
[4:36] So Jesus purposely spoke in riddles,
[4:39] hard sayings, mysteries. And the Bible
[4:42] said he did this to hide himself from
[4:44] the sinners, the wise and prudent. And
[4:47] then he would reveal himself to the
[4:48] babes, to the humble. That's according
[4:50] to Matthew 11:25 and 26. Jesus looked up
[4:54] and thanked God and said, "Oh father,
[4:56] Lord of heaven and earth, because thou
[4:57] has hid these things from the wise and
[4:59] prudent, hast revealed them unto the
[5:01] babes. Even so, Father, so it seemed
[5:03] good in thy sight."
[5:05] So, in other words, it was God's good
[5:07] pleasure to hide the truth from the
[5:10] prideful and the arrogant and the
[5:11] workers of iniquity. And this ties in
[5:14] perfectly with water baptism. Matthew
[5:15] 28:19. Jesus is speaking in a riddle
[5:18] here. Jesus is speaking in a mystery, an
[5:20] enigma. Go ye therefore teach all
[5:22] nations, baptizing them in the name of
[5:24] the Father and of the Son and the Holy
[5:26] Ghost. Jesus is not saying he's a
[5:29] trinity of three persons. Jesus is
[5:32] speaking in a riddle saying there's one
[5:34] name to the father son holy ghost. He's
[5:37] speaking in a mystery and 10 days later
[5:39] Jesus Christ filled Peter with his holy
[5:42] ghost and Peter baptized in the literal
[5:44] name of Jesus Christ. And we know if we
[5:46] put all the baptism examples together
[5:49] the true baptism is the Lord Jesus
[5:51] Christ but it's a hidden mystery and
[5:53] Jesus thank God for it and we're
[5:55] thankful that Jesus has revealed it unto
[5:57] us by his grace. I think I'll read 1
[6:00] Corinthians 8:6. But to us there is but
[6:03] one God, the Father, of whom are all
[6:05] things, and we in him. Now notice in
[6:08] Colossians 1, it says, "All things are
[6:09] from Jesus." That's because Jesus is the
[6:12] manifestation of the Father, God's
[6:15] visible image, and one Lord Jesus
[6:18] Christ, by whom are all things, and we
[6:20] by him. Now, notice Paul doesn't
[6:22] reference the Holy Ghost here because
[6:24] Paul was not a trinitarian. Paul knew
[6:26] the father was a spirit and the father
[6:29] was holy because Jesus called him holy
[6:32] father. So Paul knew God the father was
[6:36] the same person as the holy ghost. So
[6:39] God is one God, not three persons.
[6:42] Before we read Hebrews 1, let's go over
[6:45] some important points again. Remember
[6:47] there's eight problems with the Trinity
[6:49] dogma. So I'll insert a repeat of those
[6:53] eight problems right now. Just real
[6:54] quick, I want to review the eight
[6:56] problems with the Trinity Dogma. I wrote
[6:58] about this in my 2021 book, pages 23 to
[7:02] 32. The first problem is the Trinity
[7:06] Dogma adds to the Bible. The second
[7:09] problem is Jesus and his apostles taught
[7:11] and affirmed pure monotheism rather than
[7:13] trinitarianism.
[7:16] The third proof is the Aanian creed or
[7:18] sixth century trinitarian confessional
[7:20] contains multiple contradictions to
[7:22] biblical teaching on the godhead and
[7:24] there are six examples in my book. The
[7:26] fourth problem is major Bible
[7:28] contradictions and inconsistencies exist
[7:31] among trinitarians. They can't even
[7:33] agree on what they believe. Fifth, the
[7:36] early trinitarians did not affirm the
[7:37] Holy Spirit was divine until the council
[7:39] of Constantinople in 381 AD. Six,
[7:43] Trinitarian images and artwork are often
[7:45] deceptive, creating false
[7:46] representations of the Godhead. Seventh,
[7:49] some Trinitarians use two fear tactics
[7:51] to persuade others to believe in the
[7:53] Trinity, heresy and hell. Eighth, and
[7:56] finally, God sending prophet named
[7:57] William Brandham to warn Christians
[7:59] about the false trinity doctrine with
[8:01] thus sayith the Lord. So that was the
[8:03] first point. The second point is again
[8:05] the Bible never says three persons and
[8:07] it's a sin to add to the Bible. Proverbs
[8:09] 30:5 and 6 says, "Add thou not unto
[8:13] God's pure words, lest thou be called a
[8:15] liar." So many people will be called a
[8:17] liar on the day of judgment because they
[8:19] added to the word of God. But we're not
[8:21] going to do that. We're just going to
[8:22] believe everything the Bible says about
[8:24] the Godhead. A third point is that the
[8:27] Godhead, remember, is a mystery
[8:29] according to Colossians 2:2. And the
[8:32] mysterious part is not the father and
[8:34] the holy ghost. The father and the holy
[8:36] ghost are the self-same person. The
[8:38] mysterious part is the father and the
[8:40] son. As we looked at in the last video,
[8:42] how Jesus would use plural pronouns. And
[8:45] God had to use plural pronouns because
[8:46] there were two manifestations or two
[8:50] elements. You had the father and the
[8:52] son. Invisible visible. So two elements,
[8:55] invisible, visible, two nouns, God,
[9:00] manifestation. So you have to use plural
[9:02] nouns. The fourth point is that we as
[9:05] humans are in the image of God according
[9:07] to Genesis chapter 1. And if we are in
[9:10] the image of God, each one of us are not
[9:12] three persons, but we have three
[9:14] elements or three aspects to our being,
[9:17] our body, our spirit, our mind, and then
[9:20] our soul.
[9:22] So if God was three persons, then each
[9:24] one of us would be three individual
[9:26] persons. But we're not. We're one person
[9:29] with three aspects to our being. And
[9:31] that's how God is. God the Father
[9:33] invisible person. God in the flesh,
[9:37] Jesus. God visible. God with us,
[9:40] Emmanuel. That's the son of God. And
[9:43] then God in us, the Holy Ghost. One God,
[9:46] one person with three aspects or
[9:49] elements or you could say three
[9:51] manifestations. God above us, God with
[9:53] us, God in us. And I had this thought
[9:55] before, but humans are one person a
[9:59] piece. But yet they can talk to the
[10:01] other aspects of them. And this is
[10:03] scriptural. It might sound kind of
[10:04] funny, but it's true. The scripture
[10:06] tells us this. The first is Luke 12:1
[10:10] 19. The rich fool says, "And I will say
[10:12] to my soul, soul, thou has much goods
[10:15] laid up for many years. Take thine ease,
[10:17] eat, drink, and be merry." So who is
[10:20] this rich man talking to? His spirit is
[10:23] speaking to his soul. Another example is
[10:27] Psalm 42:5.
[10:29] Why art thou cast down, oh my soul? And
[10:32] why art thou disquited in me? Hope thou
[10:35] in God. So the psalmist encourages his
[10:38] own soul to trust in God. I can relate
[10:41] to this. Sometimes I'll say, Jesse, just
[10:43] get up. Why you sleeping in? Just get
[10:45] up. Or Jesse, go do this. You know you
[10:47] should do this. See, I'm talking to my
[10:48] own soul. Yet I'm one person. I'm not
[10:51] three persons. I'm one person. So God
[10:54] can do the same. Of course, it's the
[10:55] invisible spirit speaking to the visible
[10:58] son.
[10:59] And the last point I want to make is
[11:00] that Jesus's human body was and always
[11:04] will be subject to the invisible father,
[11:07] the invisible spirit. We see this in 1
[11:09] Corinthians 11 1-3. I'll just read verse
[11:12] three. But I would have you know that
[11:14] the head of every man is Christ and the
[11:16] head of the woman is the man and the
[11:19] head of Christ is God. Christ means the
[11:22] anointed. So again, we go with the order
[11:24] woman, man, Christ, the anointed. What
[11:28] is Christ anointed with? The spirit of
[11:30] God, the invisible spirit. So, woman,
[11:32] man, Christ, God. Christ is the body of
[11:36] Jesus. The glorified body of Jesus. Now,
[11:38] but before that, before Jesus was on the
[11:41] earth, before Jesus' body was conceived,
[11:42] it was the theophony of Jesus. We call
[11:45] it the logos, the word. And the head of
[11:48] that logos word or even the glorified
[11:50] body of Jesus now is the invisible
[11:53] father. We also see this playing out in
[11:55] 1 Corinthians 15:24-28.
[11:58] A very mysterious but amazing scripture.
[12:01] Then cometh the end. This is speaking of
[12:03] the new Jerusalem when he shall have
[12:05] delivered up the kingdom to God, even
[12:07] the father, when he shall put down all
[12:09] rule and all authority and power. For he
[12:12] must reign till heath put all enemies
[12:14] under his feet. The last enemy that
[12:16] shall be destroyed is death. For he hath
[12:18] put all things under his feet. But when
[12:20] he saith all things are put under him,
[12:22] it is manifest that he is expected which
[12:25] did put all things under him. And when
[12:28] all things shall be subdued unto him,
[12:30] the Son, then shall the Son also himself
[12:33] be subject unto him that put all things
[12:35] under him, that God may be all in all.
[12:39] What an amazing verse. Deep, mysterious,
[12:41] no doubt, an enigma, a dark saying,
[12:44] without a doubt. But yet, it's true.
[12:46] It's fact. The body of Jesus will always
[12:49] be submissive to the invisible father
[12:52] because again the body of Jesus could
[12:54] die when it was on earth. Even Jesus
[12:57] said the son doesn't know the day and
[12:58] hour of the rapture only the father. So
[13:01] the body of Jesus was limited in its
[13:03] humanity and therefore that body is
[13:05] always in subjection to the eternal
[13:08] invisible spirit of God. Okay, let's get
[13:11] to Hebrews chapter 1 here. by God's
[13:13] grace. Hebrews 1:es 1 and 2 speak of God
[13:18] speaking to us through his son. Verse
[13:21] one said, "In time past he spoke to the
[13:23] fathers by the prophets." Verse two hath
[13:26] in these last days spoken unto us by his
[13:28] son.
[13:30] So this is true. It's emphasizing the
[13:32] difference between the Old Testament and
[13:34] the New Testament. Some people
[13:36] erroneously use this to say there's no
[13:38] more prophets. And so they try to make
[13:40] Brother Brandham not a prophet. Of
[13:42] course, that's a lie. All you have to do
[13:44] is go to Ephesians 4 8-16 and you'll see
[13:46] that Paul said Jesus ascended on high.
[13:49] Then he sent gifts down to men. And God
[13:52] would use these five preaching gifts
[13:53] till we all come in the unity of faith.
[13:55] And of course, we haven't done that yet.
[13:57] That's speaking of the time of the
[13:58] rapture when we all come into unity with
[14:00] the rapture anointing, the latter reign,
[14:03] rapturing faith we call it. So to say
[14:06] there's no more prophets would be to
[14:07] also say there's no more of the four
[14:10] other gifts, preaching gifts in the
[14:12] five-fold ministry. But of course there
[14:14] are still pastors, prophets, teachers,
[14:16] apostles, evangelists. So to get rid of
[14:19] prophets, you have to get rid of all the
[14:20] others. So that's a false doctrine to
[14:22] say that God no longer has prophets.
[14:25] Verse three is excellent for the
[14:26] godhead. Here's the verse where God says
[14:29] he's one person. Jesus is the express
[14:31] image of his person.
[14:34] That means faximile the exact
[14:36] reproduction of God's character in a man
[14:39] Jesus Christ.
[14:41] Verse four, being made so much better
[14:43] than the angels as he hath by
[14:44] inheritance obtained a more excellent
[14:46] name than they. For unto which of the
[14:48] angels said he at any time, thou art my
[14:50] son. This day have I begotten thee and
[14:53] again I will be to him a father and he
[14:55] shall be to me a son. So these verses
[14:58] show how the son is greater than angels.
[15:00] And of course this is speaking of
[15:01] theophony form. The first creation was
[15:04] the son the logos of god and then the
[15:08] bible says the logos of the word created
[15:10] all things. All things were created by
[15:12] Jesus Christ according to Ephesians 3:9.
[15:15] Specifically, Hebrews 1:8 was a quote of
[15:18] Psalm 45:6.
[15:22] Hebrews 1:6 says, "And again, when he
[15:24] bringeth in the first begotten into the
[15:25] world, he saith, and let all the angels
[15:27] of God worship him." So here the logos
[15:31] or the word of God or the son of God is
[15:35] called the first begotten. That means he
[15:37] was the first thing that came forth out
[15:38] of God. And then God must have made
[15:40] angels right after that in order to
[15:42] worship his son. Verse 7. And of the
[15:44] angels he saith, who maketh his angels
[15:46] spirits and his ministers a flame of
[15:49] fire. Now Hebrews 1:8 is probably where
[15:52] the question is about the godhead. But
[15:54] unto the son he saith, "Thy throne, oh
[15:56] God, is forever and ever. A scepter of
[15:58] righteousness is the scepter of thy
[16:00] kingdom." Hebrews 1:9 also goes with
[16:03] this. It's quoting Psalm 45. Thou hast
[16:06] loved righteousness and hated iniquity.
[16:08] Therefore, God, even thy God, hath
[16:10] anointed thee with the oil of gladness
[16:12] above thy fellows.
[16:14] So, of course, Hebrews 1:8-9 is a
[16:17] quotation of Psalm 45:6 and 7. So, these
[16:21] verses do not prove God is three
[16:23] persons. It shows the father speaking to
[16:25] the son. So, here we have the father
[16:28] calling the son god and that trips up
[16:31] trinitarians. But again, if you do that,
[16:33] now you have three gods or tritheism.
[16:36] Now in the Greek this word God is the
[16:38] word for God's supreme deity, a deity.
[16:42] And one of the definitions is God's
[16:45] representative.
[16:47] So that's what Jesus was. Jesus the
[16:49] logos was a visible representative of
[16:52] the father God. So in other words, it
[16:54] could have said, "Thy throne, O
[16:56] representative." Of course, he also
[16:58] could have said, "Thy throne, oh son, is
[17:00] forever and ever." So, we can't let this
[17:02] one word give us a license to add to the
[17:05] Bible. Now, there's numerous other
[17:08] scriptures where Jesus calls the father
[17:10] God. So, let's go over those as well.
[17:13] John 20:17,
[17:15] Jesus said unto her, "Touch me not, for
[17:17] I'm not yet ascended to my father, but
[17:19] go to my brethren and say unto them, I
[17:21] ascend unto my father and your father
[17:24] and to my God and your God." So, this
[17:27] shouldn't stumble us. Jesus was
[17:29] ascending to the invisible spirit. He's
[17:31] ascending to my God. He's ascending to
[17:34] my father, my creator, right? For the
[17:37] body of Jesus was created. The theophony
[17:39] of Jesus was created. So, he had to send
[17:41] to his creator. So, we could just
[17:43] interchange that word God with creator,
[17:45] to my creator and to your creator. And
[17:48] this is what brother was talking about.
[17:50] Sometimes the body was speaking,
[17:51] sometimes God was speaking. So, in this
[17:53] case, the body of Jesus is speaking. The
[17:55] body was ascending to its creator.
[17:58] Another great one is Revelation 3:12.
[18:01] Him that overcomemeth will I make a
[18:02] pillar in the temple of my God, and he
[18:04] shall go no more out, and I'll write
[18:07] upon him the name of my God, and the
[18:09] name of the city of my God, which is a
[18:11] new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of
[18:13] heaven from my God, and I'll write upon
[18:16] him my new name. So again, Jesus says my
[18:20] God three times. In other words, my
[18:22] creator, my father. He's not saying my
[18:25] other co-equal person because remember
[18:28] the body of Jesus was not co-equal with
[18:30] God. Jesus said the father is greater
[18:32] than I. Jesus said the son can do
[18:34] nothing of himself but what he see the
[18:35] father doeth the son doeth likewise. And
[18:38] there was knowledge Jesus didn't know
[18:40] the human body. He didn't know the day
[18:42] or hour. Only the father knew the day
[18:44] and hour of his second coming. Another
[18:47] thing to look at which might be another
[18:49] video is the use of gods. Because God
[18:52] even called prophets gods and God even
[18:55] called the faithful Israelites gods. One
[18:58] example is Psalm 82:1, a psalm of Asaf.
[19:02] God standeth in the congregation of the
[19:04] mighty. He judgeth among the gods. Now,
[19:07] this verse is not talking about fake
[19:08] gods. It's talking about the believers
[19:11] who are in the congregation of God. So,
[19:14] this word, if you click on the word in
[19:16] the Hebrew, he judges among the gods.
[19:18] This word means rulers or judges or
[19:22] godlike one. So the best definition of
[19:25] this would be rulers or judges. God
[19:27] judges among the judges of Israel or the
[19:30] spiritual leaders of Israel, the mighty
[19:33] ones of Israel. And this reminds us of
[19:34] the New Testament how we're called kings
[19:36] and priests unto God. So what do kings
[19:39] do? They judge. They rule. So he judges
[19:41] among the kings and priests in the Old
[19:43] Testament because remember Israel was a
[19:46] nation, a priesthood unto God, a nation
[19:49] of kings and priests. John 10:35, Jesus
[19:52] is quoting Exodus. If he called them
[19:53] gods unto whom the word of God came and
[19:56] the scripture cannot be broken. So here
[19:58] prophets are called gods. So I believe
[20:00] this is Jesus speaking in his dark
[20:02] speeches, his enigmas, his mysteries,
[20:05] his riddles. Again, this means God's
[20:08] representative. So prophets are God's
[20:10] representatives.
[20:12] Another word in the New Testament that
[20:14] might help you is ambassadors.
[20:16] 2 Corinthians 5:20. Now then, we are
[20:19] ambassadors for Christ. So all these
[20:21] words are interchangeable. Gods, judges,
[20:24] rulers, kings, priests, ambassadors.
[20:27] So we just have to believe what the
[20:28] Bible says and not add our own
[20:30] interpretation. Adding three persons to
[20:32] the Godhead is adding your own
[20:34] erroneous, false interpretation to the
[20:36] Bible. So let's finish Hebrews 1:10. And
[20:39] thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid
[20:41] the foundation of the earth. The heavens
[20:42] are the works of thine hands. They shall
[20:44] perish, but thou remainest, and they all
[20:46] shall wax old as doth the garment, and
[20:48] as a vesture shalt thou fold them up,
[20:51] and they shall be changed. But thou art
[20:53] the same, and thy years fail not. But to
[20:55] which of the angels said he at any time,
[20:57] sit on my right hand until I make thine
[20:59] enemies thy foottool? So this tells us
[21:02] the invisible spirit had his son sit at
[21:05] his right hand. and right hand is not
[21:07] literal. It's representative of power
[21:10] and authority. In other words, sitting
[21:11] on God's throne. Verse 14, are they not
[21:15] all ministering spirits sent forth to
[21:16] minister for them who shall be heirs of
[21:18] salvation? So, I think I'll close with
[21:21] this visual here. It's the God of the
[21:22] sun. So, we have these three phrases in
[21:25] the scripture. Oh God, speaking of
[21:28] Hebrews 1:8, thy throne, oh God, is
[21:30] forever and ever. Jesus said he'd
[21:32] descend to your father, your God, and my
[21:35] God. And here's another good one um
[21:38] quoting David. The Lord said unto my
[21:40] Lord,
[21:42] Psalm 110:1, a Psalm of David, the Lord
[21:45] said unto my Lord, sit thou at my right
[21:47] hand until I make thine enemies thy
[21:49] foottool. So this means the father said
[21:53] unto the son. There's not two lords.
[21:56] There's not two persons in the godhead.
[21:58] There's not two gods. It's the father
[22:01] saying to the son. It's the invisible
[22:03] one speaking to the visible one. So
[22:06] again, the invisible father is the god
[22:08] or supreme deity of the son. The deity
[22:11] of the father created the image of the
[22:14] son and then dwelt in his son. The son
[22:18] is the logos or the word. And remember
[22:21] according to 1 Timothy 6:16, the
[22:24] divinity of God, the father dwells in
[22:26] the light. the father is in the son. So
[22:30] I think that's a good thought. This
[22:32] scripture, the Lord said unto my Lord,
[22:34] is the same idea or revelation as
[22:38] Hebrews 1:8, thy throne, oh God, is
[22:41] forever and ever. There's not two lords,
[22:44] there's not two gods, but it's
[22:45] recognizing the son is subject to the
[22:48] father just as 1 Corinthians 15 shows.
[22:52] In closing, friends, hope this study was
[22:53] a blessing by the grace of God. This has
[22:55] been wonderful to tie all these
[22:56] scriptures together. And again, the most
[22:58] important thing is adding not unto God's
[23:01] word as God tells us numerous times.
[23:03] Proverbs 35 and 6, Revelation 22 18 and
[23:07] 19. Remember, if people add to the word
[23:09] of God, plagues will be added to them in
[23:12] this life perhaps, but certainly in the
[23:14] next life. So, we don't want to add to
[23:16] the word. We don't want to take away
[23:17] from the word of God. Let's be humble
[23:19] enough just to accept what the Bible
[23:21] says and just say what the Bible says.
[23:24] That's a point I shared with somebody
[23:25] recently. What's astounding is that
[23:27] trinitarians say they're solless
[23:29] scriptor, which means by scripture
[23:31] alone. They only believe the scripture,
[23:34] yet they insert their threeperson false
[23:37] doctrine, their trinity dogma. So see
[23:40] friends, trinitarians just are blind in
[23:43] many ways. And I believe some of them
[23:45] can still be saved, but spiritually
[23:46] they're blind. They say they're solar
[23:48] scripura, but they're not because they
[23:50] add three persons. They add trinity.
[23:53] They add co-equal, co-distinct persons
[23:56] to the Bible. We don't need a creed. We
[23:58] just need the Bible. So, we're thankful
[24:00] for the Holy Ghost today. He's the
[24:02] dissolver of all doubts. So, hopefully
[24:03] this video has dissolved any doubts
[24:05] people have about the Godhead. The Son
[24:08] will always be subject to the Father,
[24:10] the visible image of God will always be
[24:13] subject to the invisible God. And so, we
[24:16] friends, we we are the children of God.
[24:18] We're the offspring of God. And we will
[24:20] always be subject to God.
[24:23] If you have any questions, concerns or
[24:24] testimonies about this video, please
[24:26] contact me.
[24:28] God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[24:30] the desire of your heart.
[24:33] Very happy to be here this afternoon and
[24:35] again in defense of the gospel of Jesus
[24:37] Christ to bring the good tidings, the
[24:41] good news that Jesus raised from the
[24:43] dead, living among man today, his
[24:45] church. The same Jesus that was
[24:47] yesterday will be today and forever.
[24:51] is never fails.
