[0:02] you Tabernacle here I told you we're
[0:04] going to change the name and this is not
[0:06] right for it to be Brandon Tabernacle
[0:08] that's just a man see we're going to
[0:10] change the name of it make it some other
[0:12] name we'll get on that after a while I
[0:14] wish it wasn't brandom Tabernacle I wish
[0:16] to just call the Tabernacle didn't even
[0:19] have my name attached to it my name
[0:21] taken off of it I don't think my name
[0:23] ought to be on that church it ought to
[0:24] be a brandom tabernacle it just be a
[0:26] church the church of the Lord Jesus
[0:29] Christ or something like that
[0:31] greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:33] of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of
[0:35] this video is to share quotes from
[0:38] Brother brandham about the name of
[0:39] brandham Tabernacle and asked the
[0:42] question why isn't the name of brandham
[0:44] Tabernacle changed since brother random
[0:46] said it's wrong for it to be called
[0:48] brandom Tabernacle hi friends I'm Jesse
[0:51] Smith pastor bride of Christ Fellowship
[0:53] here in akan Ohio USA for the past 18
[0:56] years and I defend the true Gospel of
[0:58] the Lord Jesus Christ as he revealed it
[1:01] and restored it to his late Prophet the
[1:03] true Prophet William brandham 1909 to
[1:07] 1965 and I also defend brother braham's
[1:09] Godly Christian character by the grace
[1:11] of God so the purpose of this video is
[1:14] again to share two quotes about how
[1:17] brother brandham wanted to change the
[1:18] name of brandham Tabernacle and then
[1:20] make two important points about these
[1:23] quotes and the origin of this video is I
[1:25] was recently preaching on the serpent
[1:28] seed brother Brandon preached in 1958
[1:31] and at the end of the sermon I heard him
[1:33] say it was wrong for the brandham
[1:35] Tabernacle to be named after him I'd
[1:38] forgotten about this quote uh and it
[1:39] made me think of these two points I want
[1:41] to address in this video so this video
[1:44] is in defense of brother brandham
[1:45] defending brother brandom against the
[1:47] idolatry that he faced during his
[1:49] lifetime and also the current idolatry
[1:53] today by The Same Spirit coming out of
[1:54] brandom Tabernacle it's clear that
[1:57] brandom Tabernacle idolizes brother
[1:58] brandom because they say every word on
[2:00] brother bram's tapes was thus sayi the
[2:02] Lord and that's a lie that's idolatry
[2:05] here's the video again of leadership
[2:07] saying every word on tape is thus sayi
[2:09] the Lord he say that you have to
[2:14] realize that every Brother Joseph
[2:16] believes everything that brother brandom
[2:18] says is thus sayth the
[2:25] Lord amen amen I believe everything
[2:29] brand
[2:32] amen now I want to share two quotes that
[2:35] this video is based upon and I do want
[2:38] to say if there's any other quotes on
[2:40] this topic I would love to know them I
[2:42] searched for a little bit and I couldn't
[2:43] find any other quotes so please share
[2:46] any quotes with me related to this topic
[2:48] what's interesting too is these two
[2:50] quotes came from the same day it was
[2:53] September 28th 1958 brother Ram talked
[2:56] about changing the name of the brandom
[2:58] Tabernacle in both the morning morning
[3:00] service and the evening service the
[3:02] morning was the baptism of the Holy
[3:03] Spirit that's the title of the sermon
[3:05] and the evening was the serpent seed of
[3:06] course so the first point I want to make
[3:08] about these quotes is if brother
[3:11] brandham said it's not right for the
[3:13] church to be named brandham Tabernacle
[3:15] then why hasn't Bram Tabernacle changed
[3:17] their name if they believe every word on
[3:19] tape is thus sayith the Lord so again if
[3:23] every word is thus sayith the Lord then
[3:24] it's thus sayith the lord it's not right
[3:26] for the church to be named brandham
[3:28] Tabernacle and brother brand said we're
[3:30] going to change the name of this so why
[3:33] haven't the leaders at BAM Tabernacle
[3:35] changed the name of it since according
[3:37] to them supposedly it's thus sayith the
[3:39] Lord that it's not right and they're
[3:40] going to do it so let's listen to both
[3:43] quotes here we'll start with the evening
[3:44] service the quote from the serpent seed
[3:47] and then we'll play the quote from
[3:48] baptism of the holy spirit so here from
[3:50] the serpent seed brother Bram said I
[3:52] told you we're going to change the name
[3:53] of this it's not right for it to be
[3:54] brandham Tabernacle so again if that's
[3:56] thus sayith the Lord then it's not right
[3:58] currently that brandham Tabernacle has
[4:00] the name brandom brother BR told us why
[4:02] he said that's just a man see we're
[4:04] going to change the name of it make it
[4:05] some other name I want it to be a Church
[4:08] of the Living God I don't want it
[4:09] Methodist Baptist Presbyterian
[4:11] Pentecostal let's listen to the quote
[4:14] you Tabernacle here I told you we're
[4:16] going to change the name of this is not
[4:17] right for it to be Brandon Tabernacle
[4:19] that's just a man see we're going to
[4:22] change the name of it make it some other
[4:23] name we'll get on that after a while I
[4:25] just want it to be a a Church of the
[4:27] Living God I don't want it Methodist
[4:29] Baptist Presbyterian Pentecostal all
[4:31] those people I love with all my heart so
[4:35] friends one more thing I love about this
[4:36] quote is brother BR said that's just a
[4:37] man and I'll get to more on that in just
[4:39] a moment here's the quote from earlier
[4:41] that same morning brother R said I don't
[4:43] think my name should be on the church he
[4:45] said brother Seward and them just
[4:47] attached my name to it when they put it
[4:49] on the deed down there brother BR said I
[4:52] wished it was just called The Tabernacle
[4:54] and didn't even have my name attached to
[4:57] it so again why doesn't the current
[4:59] brand Tabernacle do the wishes of
[5:02] brother brandham why don't they do his
[5:03] wishes and remove the name brandom and
[5:05] just call it Tabernacle or the
[5:07] Tabernacle brother BR goes on to give a
[5:10] different set of names for the church he
[5:12] said it oughtn't to be brandom
[5:14] Tabernacle it should be just a church
[5:16] the church of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[5:18] Tabernacle Lord The Dwelling Place the
[5:20] House of Prayer brother Ram said I'm
[5:22] just a man my name don't deserve to be
[5:24] on this not no more than nothing and he
[5:26] said it shouldn't be there it should be
[5:28] a Community Church
[5:30] I wish it wasn't brandom Tabernacle I
[5:32] wish it just called The Tabernacle
[5:34] didn't even have my name attached to it
[5:36] I'm fixing to turn this church you all
[5:38] know when we bought it I bought it when
[5:40] I work for the Public Service Company
[5:43] and put this thing up here and it just
[5:45] call it that because that brother Seward
[5:48] attach my name to it when they put it on
[5:49] the deed down there just as soon as I
[5:51] can get clear of this thing that we're
[5:53] in now this church is going to be turned
[5:55] over to this a community and just given
[5:57] my name taken off of it I don't I don't
[5:59] think my name ought to be on that church
[6:01] it ought to be a brandom tabernacle it
[6:03] just be a church the church of the Lord
[6:05] Jesus Christ or something like that the
[6:07] Tabernacle of the Lord see The Dwelling
[6:10] Place House of Prayer or something other
[6:12] given some kind of a name let the
[6:13] congregation choose her name my name I'm
[6:16] I'm just a man my name don't deserve to
[6:18] be on this not more than nothing the
[6:20] reason I had to put my name on this
[6:22] because my name was on the deed said
[6:24] Billy Brown see and it shouldn't be
[6:27] there no sir it should be a Community
[6:29] Church this this should be to the the
[6:31] congregation here this church is
[6:34] Sovereign you ain't no Board of Trustees
[6:36] or deacons go tell you what to do this
[6:37] church and a whole vote tells you what
[6:39] to do so again if every word is thus
[6:41] sayi the Lord and brother Ram's name
[6:43] shouldn't be there why is it there today
[6:46] this just goes to show Friends that the
[6:48] tape Church movement is under an evil
[6:51] spirit they constantly contradict
[6:53] themselves they don't even really know
[6:55] what they believe if they really
[6:57] believed every word was thus sayith the
[6:58] Lord then they should change the name of
[7:01] their Church to just the Tabernacle or
[7:03] something like that they say they
[7:05] believe every word but their actions
[7:06] prove different as brother brandham said
[7:09] now brother brandham are we missing out
[7:13] on something these people claim to
[7:15] believe every word that you say to be
[7:17] true but they
[7:19] don't they don't believe it their own
[7:21] actions prove that they
[7:23] don't so friends that's the first point
[7:25] if every word is thus sayith the Lord
[7:27] then why don't they change the the name
[7:29] of brandom Tabernacle to just the
[7:31] Tabernacle it's not right it shouldn't
[7:34] be in brother Ram's name the second
[7:36] point is I believe that this set of
[7:38] quotes shows brother Ram's true
[7:40] Christian Godly character brother Bram
[7:43] was a humble man he was a genuine Holy
[7:45] Ghost filed Christian of course brother
[7:48] Bram knew there were people around him
[7:49] that exalted him too highly even as he
[7:51] said in
[7:52] 1961 I made a video about this I think
[7:54] last year brother Rand said the people
[7:57] who baptized in his name were Antichrist
[8:00] horrible disgraceful ungodly the devil's
[8:04] gutter pipe and that evil spirit was
[8:06] represented by yellow and black serpent
[8:09] so those are all the names brother Ram
[8:11] called the evil spirit that would
[8:12] baptize in his name or make him
[8:14] infallible or make him equal to Jesus
[8:17] Christ and because of that it forces me
[8:22] to say I'm leaving the
[8:25] ministry uh is because that there is
[8:29] something arose up amongst the people
[8:32] that's caused me to do
[8:34] it that is that I have been taken from
[8:37] my bracket of a minister or a brother
[8:40] and being called Jesus
[8:43] Christ and so uh called and that would
[8:46] brand me as an
[8:49] antichrist so uh uh saying that I was
[8:54] Christ
[8:56] Brethren that is a hor able disgraceful
[9:02] ungodly lie of the
[9:05] devil I am your
[9:08] brother now that would run any person
[9:12] from the field and I just couldn't stand
[9:15] it any longer to think that 31 years of
[9:18] ministry went down the devil's gutter
[9:20] pipe into the when I'm gone what will he
[9:22] say there he is that's exactly what it
[9:24] was all the influence that it had upon
[9:26] the people then you see where to be I be
[9:28] an Antichrist and I just couldn't stand
[9:31] it I thought I'd rather die a few nights
[9:34] ago to make it
[9:35] sure I had a a visitation from the
[9:39] Lord and I seen a precious one a baby a
[9:45] serpent which was yellow and black and
[9:47] telling me right along and the thing
[9:50] struck me on the leg brothers sisters
[9:54] haven't I tried to be a true servant of
[9:57] Christ before you
[9:59] I tried to be your brother I wherever it
[10:03] is it's a spirit on precious
[10:07] people many people has asked me that but
[10:10] it's it's a
[10:12] spirit and remember if you've ever
[10:14] believed me if you've ever believed me
[10:18] to be a servant of Christ remember that
[10:21] is an
[10:23] era it's falsely thus sayith the
[10:27] Lord it is is wrong have nothing to do
[10:32] with it I am your
[10:34] brother remember brother said it's Tommy
[10:37] rot to make him infallable let's listen
[10:39] to that quote that's what gets things
[10:41] scrupled up you see that they claiming
[10:43] here that some brethren up there that
[10:45] said that I sent them up there and
[10:47] they're preaching that men should leave
[10:49] their wives and hunt for their spiritual
[10:51] mate and that um that I am perfectly
[10:55] infallible that there's nothing and all
[10:58] some of the awest things you ever heard
[11:00] and the Ministerial Association got a
[11:02] hold of it and they're writing me a
[11:04] letter about it and um I sent them up
[11:08] there and it's causing a lot of
[11:10] confusion and some of them prophesying
[11:12] and saying that one man should leave
[11:13] this wife and go marry that one uh this
[11:16] church knows that we don't stand for No
[11:18] Such Tommy Rod as that we believe in the
[11:20] Bible we believe that when man takes a
[11:22] woman that's his wife and death only can
[11:25] separate him that's only so we see
[11:28] brother Ram's humility in the quotes he
[11:29] didn't want a man in it he didn't want a
[11:32] man or a man's name on the church that's
[11:35] the humility of a real Christian and I
[11:38] believe another quote shows how brother
[11:40] ran was aware people were looking at him
[11:42] too much it's from an absolute January
[11:45] 27th 63 in Phoenix Arizona brother brand
[11:49] said I'm nothing I'm your brother don't
[11:50] pay any attention to a messenger you
[11:52] watch the message don't watch the
[11:54] messenger God will take it away from you
[11:56] God will share his glory with nobody so
[11:59] this is a beautiful quote a very humble
[12:01] quote from brother brandham but brandham
[12:02] Tabernacle and other tape churches have
[12:04] done exactly the opposite they focus too
[12:06] much on the messenger and not the bible
[12:09] message that brother brandom brought and
[12:11] again friends this is one reason I think
[12:13] Perhaps Perhaps this is why God took
[12:15] brother brandom home in 1965 we don't
[12:17] know but brother brandom said if you
[12:19] don't watch the message more than the
[12:21] messenger God will take the messenger
[12:23] away from you let's listen to the quote
[12:26] I'm only telling you the truth friend
[12:27] don't let it pass by you I'm not
[12:29] claiming I'm nothing I'm your brother
[12:33] don't you pay attention to a messenger
[12:35] you watch the message don't watch the
[12:37] messenger God will take it away from you
[12:40] he'll share his glory as nobody right
[12:44] glory to God don't you watch the
[12:45] messenger watch the message also I do
[12:48] want to State friends I don't think it's
[12:49] a sin for a man's name to be connected
[12:51] to a building uh because John 10:23 says
[12:54] Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's
[12:57] porch so there's at least one witness
[12:59] there's probably others as well where a
[13:01] man's name was attached to a building
[13:05] for worship to the Lord God now what's
[13:08] interesting also is that there's not a
[13:10] lot of scriptures that call it Solomon's
[13:12] Temple or David's Tabernacle or Moses's
[13:15] Tabernacle like for example with Moses
[13:17] it's often called The Tabernacle in the
[13:19] wilderness and then moses' name will be
[13:21] connected later on in the scripture
[13:23] somewhere later so that's the second
[13:25] Point friends I think brother Brandon
[13:26] was being very humble I think I'll play
[13:28] the video also also from the seventh
[13:29] seal where brother B said forget
[13:31] anything about me put all this grace on
[13:32] Jesus Christ I'm not fit to live and
[13:35] brother B said I'm not saying that to be
[13:36] humble he said it's facts so let's
[13:38] listen to the quote May you always bear
[13:42] that in mind to be a gy in the crown of
[13:44] Jesus Christ Paul said to the church you
[13:47] are you are the jewels gems of his crown
[13:50] we want to be the gems of the crown of
[13:53] Jesus Christ we don't want never put a
[13:56] man in it you forget anything about me
[13:59] I am your brother a sinner saved by
[14:02] grace not fit to live that's exactly the
[14:06] truth I say that to be humble that's
[14:09] facts there's nothing in me not one
[14:11] sound thing at all but the grace of God
[14:15] has let my poor dimming eyes look beyond
[14:19] the curtain of p and see those things on
[14:23] and lastly before closing I just want to
[14:24] share three more quotes uh brother Ram
[14:27] said in God's provideed place of worship
[14:29] if you want to be at God's provided
[14:30] place of worship he said I wouldn't
[14:32] point you to Bram Tabernacle he said
[14:34] it's just the same as any other church
[14:36] he said there's only one place I can
[14:37] point you to for true worship that's
[14:40] Jesus Christ let's listen to the quote
[14:43] now friends I don't want to hurt
[14:44] feelings but I'm responsible for a
[14:48] message and that message has come out of
[14:51] this
[14:52] mess and if I asked you to come out
[14:54] where am I going to take you to that's
[14:56] right would I take you to the brandom to
[14:59] Tabernacle it's as much fault as any the
[15:01] rest of them amen but there's one place
[15:03] I can take you to where you're safe and
[15:07] protected from Death Hallelujah that's
[15:09] in Jesus Christ it's God's place of
[15:12] worship
[15:14] God that's the place I'm introducing to
[15:16] you tonight where God put his name where
[15:18] he promised he'd meet every person to
[15:20] come in there he'd worship with him and
[15:22] feast with him that's in Christ not in
[15:25] no church no Tabernacle but in Christ he
[15:28] is God's Tabernacle he is a place that
[15:31] God came into himself second quote is
[15:34] brother BR said the Tabernacle would
[15:35] lose its power now what's interesting is
[15:38] after brother Neville passed away
[15:40] different leadership took over and
[15:42] that's when this movement towards a tape
[15:44] Church really started and so that's
[15:46] personally what I believe I believe
[15:48] brother R was talking about the
[15:49] Tabernacle would lose its power after
[15:51] brother Neville passed away but anyways
[15:53] that's just my thought I'm not saying
[15:54] it's right let's listen to the
[15:56] quote don't forget this Tabernacle will
[15:59] lose its strength remember that this is
[16:02] a target where Satan's got every gun in
[16:05] Hell trained on he'll cause one person
[16:08] to do something is contrary to watch the
[16:09] other things he's doing that he's up to
[16:12] it that's his
[16:14] business the third and final quote is
[16:17] when brother brandom said you can sit in
[16:18] the brandom Tabernacle and not be
[16:20] quickened by the holy spirit in fact he
[16:22] said being able to believe the message
[16:24] is just being able to read but you've
[16:26] got to be quickened and have the baptism
[16:27] of the Holy Ghost now those might be one
[16:29] or two quotes so I'll just put them
[16:31] together here by God's grace when I edit
[16:33] let's listen to the quote or
[16:35] quotes don't just come this far say I
[16:38] believe the message you obey the message
[16:42] come into Christ you so I believe every
[16:45] word said brother Brandon that's good
[16:47] but that's just that's just being able
[16:50] to
[16:51] read take the message take it into your
[16:54] heart that you must have the token the
[16:58] very life that was in Christ be in
[17:02] you the sun has shined across you set in
[17:05] this Tabernacle you've listened to tape
[17:07] and yet the spirit has never Quicken you
[17:09] so you could follow the word of
[17:11] God that you women you man could obey
[17:15] every word that he's
[17:17] written in
[17:19] closing friends I hope this video was a
[17:21] blessing by the grace of God it seems
[17:23] this week the Lord was giving me more
[17:25] thoughts and quotes related to Bam
[17:27] Tabernacle the current leadership and
[17:29] how we've got to rightly divide the word
[17:30] of Truth and we can't go to the extreme
[17:32] of idolizing brother brandom of course
[17:34] real Christians don't want to idolize
[17:36] anything they just want to Worship the
[17:38] Lord Jesus Christ in spirit and in truth
[17:41] but it seems this week I had more
[17:42] thoughts related to this subject the
[17:44] extreme of the sin and heresy of
[17:47] worshiping every word on the tape so I
[17:49] thought it'd be good to revisit some of
[17:50] these quotes by God's grace as you
[17:52] probably know earlier this week I was
[17:53] asked about is Joseph Brenham a prophet
[17:55] so I'll put a link to the two videos I
[17:57] have about that in the description
[17:59] friends let's do what brother Bram said
[18:00] brother Bram said prove All Things by
[18:01] the Bible every Bible Doctrine must run
[18:03] from Genesis to Revelation and I love
[18:06] that church age Book quote from chapter
[18:07] 3 brother brandom said that we should go
[18:10] to people and say if you're not saying
[18:13] what Paul said you are false and so I've
[18:15] tried to do that you know with the Bram
[18:17] Tabernacle movement numerous times they
[18:18] haven't accepted my correction so that's
[18:21] why I'm sharing these things publicly in
[18:22] Christian love in brotherly kindness to
[18:25] help people it seems like every time I
[18:27] put one out it does help some people by
[18:29] the grace of God that's why I feel led
[18:31] of the Holy Spirit to do it but remember
[18:33] brother Ram said that the true prophet
[18:36] of God at the last days would give us
[18:39] the gospel as exactly as Jesus Christ
[18:42] gave it to Paul so I want to finish with
[18:44] that quote from the church age book it's
[18:45] a beautiful quote let's remember that
[18:47] True Believers today true Holy Ghost
[18:49] filled Believers the wise virgins of
[18:51] today that truly believe the message of
[18:52] the hour keep the gospel in its Purity
[18:55] just as Jesus Christ gave it to Paul and
[18:58] we know the Saints beond the curtain of
[18:59] time are resting on the fact that
[19:00] brother R pointed us to the genuine
[19:02] Gospel of St Paul as Jesus Christ gave
[19:05] it to him let's listen to the quote they
[19:07] looked those false Apostles in the eye
[19:09] and said you are not saying what Paul
[19:12] said you are therefore false oh that
[19:15] sets my heart on fire get back to the
[19:18] word it is not you that really tries the
[19:21] Apostle and prophet and teacher it is
[19:24] the word that tries them one of these
[19:26] days there is going to come a prophet to
[19:28] the leodan Church age and you will know
[19:31] if he is the real one sent from God or
[19:33] not yes you will for if he is of God he
[19:37] will be in that word exactly as God gave
[19:40] it to Paul he won't deviate from that
[19:42] word for a moment not by one
[19:45] iota if you have any questions concerns
[19:47] or testimonies about this video please
[19:48] contact
[19:50] me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[19:53] the desire of your heart
