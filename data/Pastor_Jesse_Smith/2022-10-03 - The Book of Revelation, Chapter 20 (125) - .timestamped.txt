[0:00] foreign
[0:01] chapter 20.
[0:05] the themes of this chapter include the
[0:08] Thousand-Year reign with Christ upon the
[0:10] Earth
[0:10] the Battle of Goga Magog
[0:13] and the Great White Throne judgment
[0:17] the Thousand-Year reign of Christ upon
[0:19] the Earth is described in verses one
[0:21] through six and John gets to see a
[0:24] glimpse of what will take place after
[0:25] the awful tribulation period this one
[0:28] thousand year reign is often called the
[0:30] millennium the Millennium is likened
[0:32] unto the honeymoon of Christ and his
[0:34] wife the New Testament Church
[0:36] the Rapture is first and is likened unto
[0:39] the wedding ceremony next the marriage
[0:41] suffer the lamb is likened unto the
[0:43] wedding reception and then the
[0:45] millennial honeymoon follows it
[0:48] this 1 000 year reign is God's
[0:50] opportunity to finally have his seventh
[0:53] day or day of rest that Satan
[0:55] interrupted in Genesis chapter 3 after
[0:58] God's first six days of creation or the
[1:01] first six thousand years
[1:03] this is true because second Peter 3
[1:04] verse 8 states that one day is with the
[1:07] Lord as a thousand years and a thousand
[1:10] years as one day
[1:12] during this Reign not only will Christ
[1:14] have his own Throne as son of David but
[1:17] all the born-again Christians will sit
[1:18] upon Thrones of judgment as Christ had
[1:21] promised them in Revelation 3 verse 21
[1:23] and First Corinthians 6 verse 2 because
[1:26] they willingly gave their lives as
[1:28] Martyrs for Christ or they refused to
[1:30] worship the Beast which is the false
[1:32] Christian system of the Roman Catholic
[1:35] church and its Protestant daughters who
[1:37] share false doctrines and abominable
[1:39] works with the mother harlot
[1:42] because these born-again Christians
[1:44] reigned in life over sin the flesh the
[1:47] world and Satan by the Holy Spirit of
[1:49] Christ as Romans 5 17 States Jesus can
[1:53] now trust them to Reign on the earth for
[1:55] one thousand years
[1:58] the Battle of Gog and Magog is described
[2:00] in verses 7 through 10 and is the final
[2:03] battle recorded in holy writ Satan who
[2:06] will be recently loose from the
[2:08] bottomless pit after one thousand years
[2:09] of being locked in the pit Will deceive
[2:12] the Nations that have grown up and
[2:13] multiplied to the number as the sand of
[2:16] the sea during the 1 000 years of peace
[2:19] Satan's Army will Compass or surround
[2:21] the camp of the Saints and the Beloved
[2:23] City Jerusalem according to Psalm 48 2
[2:26] Lamentations 215 Zechariah 8 verse 3 and
[2:31] Psalm 132 verses 13 and 14.
[2:34] a fire will come down from God out of
[2:36] heaven and devour the deceived Army and
[2:39] then the deceiver himself Satan will
[2:42] finally be done away with for eternity
[2:44] as he will be cast into the lake of fire
[2:46] and brimstone and receive torment day
[2:48] and night forever and ever
[2:51] the great white Throne judgment is
[2:53] described in verses 11-15 and is also
[2:56] detail in Daniel 7 verses 9 and 10 John
[2:59] 5 verses 28 and 29 and Matthew 25 verses
[3:03] 31-46
[3:06] this is the day when all men and women
[3:07] shall stand before God to be judged from
[3:10] the open books by their works and either
[3:13] given eternal life or the second death
[3:15] which is the Lake of Fire
[3:17] the Lake of Fire is eternal separation
[3:19] from God's presence and ultimately
[3:22] complete annihilation of The Souls of
[3:24] unbelievers who will cease to exist at
[3:27] some point
[3:29] it is important to see that those whose
[3:31] names are found in the Book of Life are
[3:33] allowed to go into life eternal Matthew
[3:36] 25 46 for being kind and gracious to
[3:40] even the least of Jesus's Brethren as
[3:42] Matthew 25 40 States
[3:45] but a true born-again holy ghost-filled
[3:47] Christian already has eternal life
[3:49] during their time of service on Earth as
[3:52] seen in first John 5 13 John 5 verse 24
[3:56] Romans 8 verse 10 and Colossians 1 verse
[3:59] 27.
[4:00] so this tells us that the holy
[4:02] ghost-filled Christians will be seated
[4:04] with Christ on the throne at the great
[4:07] white Throne judgment just as they sat
[4:10] on Thrones during the Millennium to
[4:12] serve as a witness on this day of
[4:14] judgment as Jesus said the queen of the
[4:16] South would raise up in judgment against
[4:18] the first century generation in Matthew
[4:20] 12 42.
[4:24] the symbols and key Revelations include
[4:26] the old Serpent and the first
[4:28] resurrection
[4:31] the old serpent in Revelation 20 verse 2
[4:34] is a symbol of Satan as earlier taught
[4:36] in Revelation 12 verse 9. Satan has
[4:39] numerous symbols such as Serpent and
[4:42] dragon and numerous titles such as the
[4:44] devil Satan and Lucifer
[4:47] having multiple symbols and names does
[4:49] not make Satan more than one person just
[4:52] as God has multiple titles such as
[4:54] father son Holy Ghost and yet God is
[4:57] only one person not three persons as
[5:00] most so-called Christians claim for the
[5:03] Bible never calls God three persons
[5:05] instead Christ is the image of the
[5:08] invisible God according to Colossians 1
[5:10] verse 15 the image of the one and only
[5:13] person of God according to Hebrews 1
[5:15] verse 3. Jesus is the express image of
[5:19] the person of God
[5:22] the symbol of Satan as the old serpent
[5:24] reminds us that he was the originator of
[5:27] sin in heaven before coming to Earth and
[5:29] possessing the body of the serpent in
[5:31] the Garden of Eden Satan is called the
[5:33] father of lies and so he was the first
[5:36] liar in heaven and the first liar on
[5:38] Earth
[5:39] Satan has two main forms revealing his
[5:42] tactics the power of the dragon and the
[5:45] subtlety of the serpent
[5:47] Satan is both powerful and subtle he
[5:50] overpowers the weak and deceives those
[5:52] who are not watchful
[5:55] Christ justly casts Satan into the Lake
[5:57] of Fire where Satan will receive
[5:59] constant torment day and night as a
[6:02] recompense for all the pain and death
[6:03] his lies have caused
[6:07] the first resurrection is a key
[6:09] Revelation mentioned in Revelation
[6:10] chapter 20 verse 5. most churchgoers are
[6:14] unaware that there are two resurrections
[6:17] the first resurrection is the rapture of
[6:19] the New Testament Church spoken of in
[6:21] first Thessalonians 4 verse 17 and First
[6:24] Corinthians 15 verses 51-54 which is
[6:28] also called The Wedding of Christ and
[6:30] his wife
[6:31] this wedding was mentioned in Revelation
[6:33] chapter 19 as well the Rapture changes
[6:36] the bodies of the dead and living Saints
[6:38] into Incorruptible bodies before the
[6:41] Great Tribulation period and allows them
[6:43] to live in heaven and enjoy the marriage
[6:45] supper of the lamb and also gives them
[6:47] the right to live and reign with Christ
[6:49] for one thousand years in the millennium
[6:53] the second Resurrection According To
[6:56] Jesus is called the resurrection of life
[6:57] and resurrection of damnation in John 5
[7:01] verses 28 and 29. this is when all men
[7:04] and women in their graves will be called
[7:05] to stand before God and be judged out of
[7:08] God's books for their works only the
[7:10] Holy Ghost filled Christians and Jews
[7:12] will live during the 1 000 year
[7:14] Millennium for the rest of the Dead live
[7:16] not again until the thousand years were
[7:18] finished as Revelation 20 verse 5 says
[7:21] which means they can only be raised at
[7:23] the second Resurrection since they
[7:25] missed out on the first resurrection
[7:27] which was the rapture
[7:30] the timing of events is as follows
[7:32] this entire chapter is completely
[7:34] chronological sometime after the
[7:36] tribulation period Satan is Bound for
[7:39] one thousand years which allows Christ
[7:41] and his people to complete their one
[7:43] thousand year honeymoon on the Earth
[7:45] at the completion of the 1000 Years
[7:47] Satan is loose for a short season and
[7:50] deceives the Nations to come to Gog and
[7:53] Magog and battle against Christ his wife
[7:55] and Jesus's beloved City
[7:58] fire comes down from heaven to Devour
[8:00] the deceived Army and Satan is cast into
[8:03] the Lake of Fire and the second
[8:05] Resurrection gathers all men and women
[8:07] to stand before God at the great white
[8:09] Throne judgment and receive either
[8:12] eternal life or the second death in the
[8:14] Lake of Fire
