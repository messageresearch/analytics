[0:06] greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:08] of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of
[0:12] this video is to show what the Bible
[0:14] teaches about wise stewardship and how
[0:17] it condemns all forms of gambling I'm
[0:20] making this video after a believer
[0:22] requested this topic so I pray it's a
[0:25] blessing to many souls yes all gambling
[0:28] is sinful whether in the form of lottery
[0:30] tickets online fantasy sports leagues
[0:33] casinos and all other forms gambling
[0:37] falls under two of the three categories
[0:39] of sin first the lust of the eyes and
[0:42] second the pride of life as John says
[0:45] there are three categories of sins first
[0:48] John 2:16 for all that is in the world
[0:51] the lust of the flesh and the lust of
[0:53] the eyes and the pride of life is not of
[0:55] the Father but is of the world in man's
[1:00] pride he rejects God's plan for his own
[1:03] life coveting after worldly pleasures
[1:06] rather than God's eternal treasures
[1:09] through the lust of the eyes seeing
[1:12] potential riches and power gamblers
[1:15] become covetous and lovers of pleasures
[1:17] more than lovers of God both of these
[1:20] conditions are found in Paul's prophetic
[1:22] endtime prediction about the sins of men
[1:25] in 2nd Timothy 3 verses 2 & 4 know this
[1:29] also that in the last days perilous
[1:31] times shall come
[1:32] for men should be lovers of their own
[1:34] selves covetous of pleasures more than
[1:38] lovers of God friends pride and
[1:42] covetousness are great temptations but
[1:45] God has promised to always make a way
[1:47] out for us in times of temptation
[1:49] according to 1st Corinthians 10:13 there
[1:53] hath no temptation taken you but such is
[1:55] as common to man but God is faithful who
[1:58] will not suffer you to be tempted above
[2:00] that ye are able but will with the
[2:02] temptation also make a way of escape
[2:04] that you may be able to bear it God
[2:08] calls you to be a fully armored
[2:10] Christian soldier and you must take the
[2:12] shield of faith the corn Ephesians 616
[2:15] and faith is a revelation of God's will
[2:18] that you are trusting up
[2:20] and so with the shield you quench the
[2:22] fiery dart or arrow of pride and
[2:25] covetousness not letting it destroy you
[2:27] and your family you must stay safe and
[2:30] protected behind God's will then take
[2:34] the sword of the Spirit according to
[2:35] Ephesians 6:17 and cut down Satan's
[2:38] temptation by speaking God's Word
[2:40] against Satan or the evil spirit Jesus
[2:44] defeated Satan by saying it is written
[2:46] and it is written again in Matthew
[2:49] chapter 4 verses 4 & 7 st. Paul said our
[2:53] weapons are mighty through God to the
[2:55] pulling down of strongholds and in this
[2:58] case the stronghold of gambling 2nd
[3:01] Corinthians 10 verses 4 and 5 for the
[3:04] weapons of our warfare are not carnal
[3:05] but mighty through God to the pulling
[3:07] down of strongholds casting down
[3:10] imaginations and every high thing that
[3:12] exalteth itself against the knowledge of
[3:14] God and bringing into captivity every
[3:16] thought to the obedience of Christ
[3:21] along with pride and the lust of the
[3:24] eyes here's six more reasons Christians
[3:26] should abstain from gambling number one
[3:29] money is to be gained God's Way not
[3:32] through man's way just like salvation
[3:35] has one provided way
[3:37] so does gaining money money should be
[3:40] gained through humility the fear of the
[3:42] Lord hard work and sound investments
[3:45] rather than risky unsafe decisions here
[3:49] we see humility and the fear of the Lord
[3:51] bring blessings in proverbs 22 for by
[3:54] humility and the fear of the Lord are
[3:56] riches honor and life next with hard
[4:01] work Christians are to work hard for
[4:02] their needs
[4:03] according to Ecclesiastes 9:10
[4:05] whatsoever thy hand find it to do do it
[4:08] with thy might for there is no work nor
[4:11] device nor knowledge nor wisdom in the
[4:13] grave whither thou goest Paul even tells
[4:16] Christian slaves to work heartily as to
[4:18] the Lord and not to men in Colossians 3
[4:22] verses 22 to 25 servants and whatsoever
[4:27] you do do it heartily as to the Lord and
[4:30] not unto men
[4:33] Paul also says if you make honest
[4:36] investments you'll reap honest rewards
[4:38] Galatians 6 verses 7 and 8 be not
[4:41] deceived God is not mocked for
[4:43] whatsoever man soweth that shall he also
[4:46] reap for he that soweth to his flesh
[4:48] shall reap corruption but he that so it
[4:51] to the spirit shall of the Spirit reap
[4:53] life everlasting
[4:56] concerning sound investments Jesus
[4:58] strictly says sound investments are
[5:00] required for faithful stewards or
[5:02] managers of his resources in the parable
[5:06] of the talents in Matthew 25 verses 14
[5:09] to 30 concerning this parable do
[5:12] faithful stewards gamble with their
[5:13] masters money of course not
[5:16] Jesus will call faithful investors good
[5:18] and faithful servants making them rulers
[5:20] of many things in the Millennium and the
[5:23] New Jerusalem Jesus will call unfaithful
[5:26] stewards wicked and slothful because
[5:28] they failed to invest their resources in
[5:30] the simplest easiest ways
[5:33] also david says all money comes from God
[5:36] and therefore belongs to him in first
[5:39] chronicles 29 11 to 14 then Oh Lord is
[5:43] the greatness for all that is in the
[5:46] heaven and in the earth is thine both
[5:49] riches and honor come Avey and in thine
[5:51] hand is to make great for all things
[5:54] come of thee and of thine own have we
[5:56] given thee money gained through gambling
[6:00] will probably be lost according to
[6:03] proverbs 13 11 wealth gods and by vanity
[6:05] shall be diminished but he that
[6:08] gathereth by labour shall increase you
[6:11] know your heart is evil if you want
[6:13] quick riches proverbs 28 22 says he that
[6:17] hast ahthe to be rich hath an evil eye
[6:19] and considereth not that poverty shall
[6:22] come upon him number 2 we should seek to
[6:27] gain contentment rather than riches
[6:30] gambling breeds sinful wicked
[6:32] covetousness but Christ is calling you
[6:35] and I to contentment which is a more
[6:37] valuable gain than millions or billions
[6:40] of dollars Paul literally states this in
[6:43] 1st Timothy 6 verses 6 to 12 but
[6:47] godliness with contentment is great gain
[6:49] for we brought nothing into this world
[6:52] and it is certain we can carry nothing
[6:54] out and having food and raiment let us
[6:57] be therewith content Paul continues and
[7:01] says riches are accompanied by great
[7:02] temptations which Christians must flee
[7:05] from but they that will be rich fall
[7:08] into temptation and a snare and into
[7:10] many foolish and hurtful lusts which
[7:12] drown men in destruction and perdition
[7:14] for the love of money is the root of all
[7:16] evil which while some coveted after they
[7:19] have erred from the faith and pierced
[7:21] themselves through with many sorrows but
[7:25] Thou O man of God flee these things and
[7:28] follow after righteousness godliness
[7:29] faith love patience and meekness fight
[7:34] the good fight of faith lay hold on
[7:36] eternal life whereunto thou art also
[7:39] called and has professed a good
[7:41] profession before many witnesses
[7:44] proverbs 30 verses 7 & 8
[7:47] towards a simple beautiful prayer of
[7:48] contentment I've often prayed we should
[7:51] ask God to keep us from being so poor
[7:53] that were tempted to steal but also keep
[7:57] us from getting rich
[7:58] if those riches will make us forget him
[8:00] two things have i required of thee deny
[8:04] me them not before i die
[8:06] remove far from me vanity and lies give
[8:09] me neither poverty nor riches feed me
[8:12] with food convenient for me lest i be
[8:14] full and deny thee and say who is the
[8:17] lord or lest i be poor and steal and
[8:19] take the name of my god in vain
[8:24] number three God's plan for your life
[8:27] may include having less money as
[8:30] Christians we should seek God to
[8:32] understand his calling for our life as
[8:34] some believers are called to be faithful
[8:36] with riches like Abraham and Solomon
[8:39] while others are called to be faithful
[8:41] to Christ yet being financially poor
[8:44] like Paul and the beggar named Lazarus
[8:47] proverbs 22 verse 2 says the Lord makes
[8:50] some rich and others poor the rich and
[8:53] poor meet together the Lord is the maker
[8:55] of them all first samuel 2:7 says
[8:59] something similar the Lord maketh poor
[9:01] and maketh rich he bringeth lo and
[9:04] lifteth up if you know God's will for
[9:07] your life regarding your finances it is
[9:09] easier to be content wherever God calls
[9:12] us on the continuum of money and wealth
[9:15] God wants us to be a witness with a
[9:17] testimony of receiving God's grace for
[9:20] our trials on Judgment Day on the
[9:24] wealthy side
[9:25] Abraham seems to be an excellent example
[9:26] of handling riches faithfully Genesis 13
[9:30] to shows evidence he was very wealthy
[9:32] saying and Abram was very rich in cattle
[9:35] in silver and in gold but God saw his
[9:39] love for truth and how he faithfully
[9:41] trained his family and servants to obey
[9:43] God's Word God's own words say this in
[9:46] Genesis 18:19 for I know him that he
[9:50] will command his children and his
[9:51] household after him and they shall keep
[9:53] the way of the Lord to do justice and
[9:56] judgment that the Lord may bring upon
[9:58] Abraham that which he has spoken of him
[10:00] Abraham and his servants were so brave
[10:03] and courageous that they rescued the
[10:04] people and goods of Sodom and Gomorrah
[10:06] from four heathen kings in Genesis 14
[10:10] verses 11 to 16 moving to Solomon we
[10:14] know Solomon was extremely rich and
[10:16] prosperous by God's hand as he only
[10:18] asked God for wisdom to rule his people
[10:20] in first Kings three verses 9 to 13
[10:24] God made him rich as a reward because he
[10:27] did not ask for riches sadly though it
[10:29] was Solomon's many wives who turned his
[10:31] heart away from serving the Lord in his
[10:33] later years according to 1st Kings 11
[10:36] verses
[10:37] three and four Christians can conclude
[10:40] it's not a sin to be rich but God is
[10:42] looking for the rich to have a
[10:44] surrendered heart Paul says rich
[10:47] Christians should be rich in good works
[10:48] according to first Timothy 6 verses 17
[10:51] to 19 charge them that are rich in this
[10:54] world that they be not high-minded nor
[10:56] trust in uncertain riches but in the
[10:58] Living God who giveth us richly all
[11:01] things to enjoy that they do good that
[11:04] they be rich in good works ready to
[11:06] distribute willing to communicate laying
[11:09] up in store for themselves a good
[11:11] foundation against the time to come that
[11:13] they may lay hold on eternal life on the
[11:17] poor side st. Paul's own writings to the
[11:19] Corinthians defends his testimony has an
[11:22] apostle and says he suffered much for
[11:24] Christ being whipped five times beaten
[11:27] with rods thrice but also in hunger and
[11:30] thirst in fastings often and in cold and
[11:33] nakedness Paul's ministry was not one in
[11:37] great wealth and physical comfort as he
[11:40] was left hungry and thirsty many times
[11:42] at the end of Paul's life he asked
[11:45] Timothy to bring his one cloak to him in
[11:47] prison when he came to see Paul and a
[11:50] cloak is a heavy coat used for
[11:52] protection against stormy weather
[11:54] according to the Greek 2nd Timothy 4:13
[11:57] the cloak that I left at Troas with
[12:01] Karpis when thou comest bring with thee
[12:03] and the books but especially the
[12:05] parchments jesus' story of the rich man
[12:09] and beggar named Lazarus in Luke 16:19
[12:12] 231 shows how the Lord made one rich man
[12:16] and the other poor after death lazarus
[12:19] the poor man was saved in Abraham's
[12:22] bosom while the rich man was lost to the
[12:24] torments of Hell the story alludes to
[12:27] the fact that the rich man didn't
[12:28] believe and obey the Old Testament the
[12:30] law of Moses meaning that the poor man
[12:33] Lazarus did while in hell the rich man
[12:37] asked Abraham to send Lazarus back to
[12:39] the earth in a miraculous resurrection
[12:42] in order to convince his five brothers
[12:44] to serve God and avoid hell Abraham's
[12:47] answer is that America would not
[12:49] convince them the
[12:51] Moses was more than enough to convict
[12:53] his brothers and grant them salvation
[12:56] this story should remind us of Jesus's
[12:59] other words that the rich are hardly
[13:01] saved Matthew 19 23 then said Jesus unto
[13:05] his disciples verily I say unto you that
[13:07] a rich man shall hardly enter into the
[13:09] kingdom of God this story also reminds
[13:13] us some scriptures are promises based
[13:15] upon probability like David's testimony
[13:18] that he'd never seen the righteous
[13:20] beggin bread in psalm 37:25 i have been
[13:24] young and now am old yet have i not seen
[13:27] the righteous forsaken nor his seed
[13:29] begging bread indeed david never saw the
[13:32] righteous begging bread but in jesus's
[13:35] story lazarus was righteous yet begging
[13:38] bread his righteousness despite his
[13:41] necessity to beg for food caused God to
[13:44] save his soul and take it to Abraham's
[13:46] bosom
[13:47] Lazarus overcame the temptations of
[13:50] being poor having to beg for food and
[13:52] yet was saved the rich man could not
[13:55] overcome the temptations that came along
[13:57] with riches and was lost number 4 God
[14:03] has ordained seasons of less and more
[14:05] for your life this reason is closely
[14:07] related to reason number 3 but is worth
[14:10] examining by itself over 3,000 years ago
[14:14] the Holy Ghost inspired Solomon to say
[14:16] that we'll go through seasons of life in
[14:18] which we have less money and more money
[14:21] Ecclesiastes chapter 3 verses 6 and 11
[14:24] say this a time to get and a time to
[14:27] lose a time to keep and a time to cast
[14:29] away he hath made everything beautiful
[14:32] in his time also he has set the world in
[14:35] their heart so that no man can find out
[14:38] the work that God maketh from the
[14:39] beginning to the end Ecclesiastes also
[14:42] says your human flesh and mind will
[14:45] never be satisfied with the amount of
[14:47] money you have so settle it in your
[14:50] heart now that no matter the season
[14:52] you're in you will always be content
[14:54] with what God has given you Ecclesiastes
[14:57] 5:10 he that loveth silver shall not be
[15:00] satisfied with silver nor he that loveth
[15:02] abundance with increase
[15:04] this is also vanity additionally Solomon
[15:08] says you have increased goods in order
[15:11] to feed your increasing family size
[15:13] which is a season of life please last YZ
[15:16] 511 when Goods increase their increase
[15:20] that eat them and what good is there to
[15:22] the owners there of saving the beholding
[15:25] of them with their eyes friends because
[15:28] we will likely go through seasons of
[15:30] gain and loss we should save money for
[15:32] the times of loss or less this is God's
[15:36] wisdom teaching us proverbs 6 verses 6
[15:39] to 8 go to the ant thou sluggard
[15:41] consider her ways and be wise which
[15:44] having no guide overseer or ruler
[15:46] provided through me in the summer and
[15:49] gathereth her food in the harvest
[15:51] proverbs 21:5 the thoughts of the
[15:54] diligent tend only to plenteous nests
[15:56] but of everyone that is hasty only to
[15:59] want proverbs 21 23rd to be desired in
[16:04] oil in the dwelling of the wise but a
[16:06] foolish man spent ahthe it up be content
[16:10] since you know from God's Word that part
[16:13] of your testimony in life may be to lose
[16:15] rather than to gain there are seasons
[16:19] for both remember godliness with
[16:21] contentment is great gain part of your
[16:25] testimony and test of your faith may be
[16:27] to become poor like Joseph as a slave
[16:30] and prisoner but later he became rich as
[16:33] second-in-command under Pharaoh job was
[16:37] first rich then lost all his wealth and
[16:39] children but eventually God restored his
[16:42] wealth and multiplied children to him
[16:45] Paul when he was known as Saul and a
[16:48] Pharisee no doubt had all his needs met
[16:51] but as a Christian he was used mightily
[16:53] by Christ to spread the gospel but at
[16:56] times lacked food and drink remember at
[16:59] the end of his ministry he even lacked
[17:01] the ability to quickly get a coat and he
[17:03] had to ask Timothy to bring him his one
[17:05] coat as he sat in prison preparing for
[17:08] the cold winter months our duty is to
[17:11] love God in the midst of all trials
[17:13] because we know he holds our lives and
[17:15] future in his hands all things worked
[17:18] for good to them that love the Lord
[17:21] number five gambling is a demonic social
[17:25] sickness without a doubt gambling
[17:28] destroys millions of individuals and
[17:30] families gambling often leads to a
[17:33] generational curse this is because the
[17:36] sins of pride and covetousness are often
[17:38] unconfessed within families causing
[17:41] children to mimic the sinful habits of
[17:44] their parents Exodus 20 verse 5 says I
[17:47] the LORD thy God am a jealous God
[17:49] visiting the iniquity of the father's
[17:52] upon the children unto the third and
[17:54] fourth generation of them that hate me
[17:57] gambling addiction seems to hurt the
[18:00] poor more than anyone else because they
[18:02] have no savings to fall back upon
[18:04] millions are addicted seeking a quick
[18:06] financial cure and ruin their lives
[18:09] through gambling second these demons
[18:12] maintain a strong influence in physical
[18:15] areas like homes towns and cities such
[18:19] as Las Vegas this principle is proven by
[18:22] Scripture as the Legion of demons Jesus
[18:25] cast out of the man in Ghaderi did not
[18:27] want to leave that area in mark 5 verse
[18:30] 10 it says and he besought him much that
[18:34] he would not send them away
[18:35] out of the country friends if you're a
[18:38] parent you want to pass on the legacy of
[18:41] Christ and a holy godly Christian
[18:44] heritage like Timothy's mother and
[18:46] grandmother
[18:47] second Timothy 1 verses 4 to 6 and 2nd
[18:52] Timothy 3 verses 13 to 17 prove this
[18:55] principle Paul saw the unfeigned faith
[18:58] in Timothy but knew at first dwell in
[19:01] his grandmother Lois and mother Eunice
[19:03] Paul told Timothy to continue in the
[19:06] things which he had learned knowing of
[19:09] whom he had learned them from a child
[19:12] Timothy knew the Holy Scriptures thanks
[19:14] to the godly legacy of his mother and
[19:17] grandmother parents should model God's
[19:19] teaching to Moses in Deuteronomy 6
[19:22] verses 4 to 9 as God told the Prophet
[19:25] Moses to diligently train the children
[19:28] in righteousness by their conversations
[19:31] and
[19:32] even home decorations and thou shalt
[19:34] teach them diligently unto thy children
[19:36] and shalt talk of them when thou sittest
[19:38] in thine house and when thou walkest by
[19:41] the way and when thou liest down and
[19:43] when thou risest up and thou shalt bind
[19:45] them for a sign upon thine hand and they
[19:48] shall be as frontlets between thine eyes
[19:51] and thou shalt write them upon the posts
[19:53] of thy house and on thy gates number 6
[19:58] God values generosity in your
[20:01] stewardship of his money it's already
[20:04] been proven that God does not love the
[20:06] sin of covetousness or gambling but God
[20:09] loves a cheerful Giver as specifically
[20:11] taught in 2nd Corinthians 9:7 every man
[20:15] according as he hath purposed in his
[20:16] heart so let him give not grudgingly or
[20:19] of necessity for God loveth a cheerful
[20:22] Giver God wants us to cheerfully give in
[20:25] a variety of ways such as enticing
[20:28] offerings to our local churches
[20:30] according to 1st Corinthians 9 13 and 14
[20:33] palms which are seeker gifts of charity
[20:36] to the poor according to Christ in
[20:38] Matthew 6 verses 1 to 4 and also in
[20:41] meeting people's basic needs according
[20:44] to Paul in Philippians 4:12 2:19 these
[20:48] cheerful givings are investments for
[20:50] eternity because they ultimately are
[20:53] done to God's glory and are actually
[20:55] done to Jesus himself Christ taught this
[20:59] in Matthew 25 verses 34 to 40 because
[21:02] jesus said the giving of clothes food
[21:04] drink and housing to the needy was the
[21:07] same as giving Jesus himself these gifts
[21:10] we must redeem our time according to
[21:12] Ephesians 5:15 by investing in eternal
[21:16] things you have one life to live then
[21:20] comes judgment or eternity
[21:22] there's no reduce you either invest in
[21:25] God's kingdom or in Satan's Kingdom
[21:27] gambling and games provide no eternal
[21:30] significance
[21:30] they are simply fantasy and Paul said
[21:33] not to be given over to tales or fantasy
[21:36] first Timothy 4:7 but refused profane
[21:40] and old wives fables and exercise
[21:42] thyself rather unto godliness
[21:46] use your creativity your freetime your
[21:49] mind your strength for good and not evil
[21:52] live for others not for yourself reject
[21:55] the selfish life and live a life that
[21:58] invests eternally in the things of God
[22:01] all we have is given to us by
[22:04] stewardship as Jesus's parables teach us
[22:07] Christians are generous stewards of the
[22:09] money God has allotted to them gambling
[22:14] is a tragic waste it's a failure of
[22:16] stewardship gambling often leads to loss
[22:19] which limits and erases one's ability to
[22:23] be generous as God called us to be in
[22:27] closing I hope you can see God's views
[22:30] on the evils of gambling and also his
[22:33] eternal wisdom about how to use money
[22:36] for his glory please contact me with any
[22:38] questions concerns or testimonies about
[22:41] this video god bless you and may Jesus
[22:45] Christ be the desire of your heart
