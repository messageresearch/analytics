TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] well then the same god that said don't make yourself any engraved images the same god said build two chirping greetings friends in the matchless name of the lord jesus christ is it sinful for our church and other churches to display pictures of jesus christ i believe the answer is no as long as the picture is used as a reminder and no worship is directed to the picture or image over the years our church has been accused of being idolaters because we have a picture of the lord jesus christ that we display here in the church and people see it on our live stream services and i've always responded to these comments in the same manner a bible-based manner and i want to share a public response to all of our viewers that might help other believers worldwide i'll begin by reading the comment of the viewer accusing me of being an idolater for having a picture of jesus christ in our church and then i'll share my convictions about hoffman's painting of christ which is displayed in our church and lastly show the sin of veneration of statues and images the viewer wrote and i quote i do appreciate the teachings you share according to the word of god thank you so much i have learned tremendously from your ministry but i do have a problem with the false god on the background behind you to your left exodus 20 verses 4 and 5 end quote i'll read exodus 20 verses 4 and 5. of course you know it's out of the 10 commandments thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above or that is in the earth beneath or that is in the water underneath the earth thou shalt not bow down thyself to them nor serve them for i the lord thy god am a jealous god visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me so my brief reply was this quote regarding your question with all due love and respect you are mistaken i believe exodus 20 verses 4 and 5 but did you consider exodus 25 verses 18-22 god himself told aaron to worship him between two man-made statues of cherubim was aaron an idolater you might think he was but he was not the statues were simply reminders of the presence of the holy angels and they also helped aaron moses and the children of israel to know what the heavenly sanctuary was like as well because moses built this earthly sanctuary based upon the heavenly pattern that god showed him again notice the words that god told moses in exodus 20 he specifically said thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above so of course cherubims would be in heaven above and remember a few chapters later god told moses to have israel make images or statues of two cherubim that would go upon the mercy seat so god's meaning must be never worship any image whether two-dimensional or three-dimensional but it's undeniable that god commissioned moses aaron and israel to build images on earth to represent the two cherubim in heaven above god is unchanging meaning we like aaron can worship the one true god with visual reminders my reminder is the painting of jesus christ but i don't worship that painting the same was true for aaron he did not worship the angelic statues he worshipped god between the statues i hope this helps you to stop rebuking me and others that worship with reminders like aaron had as well god bless you and again this is written in brotherly love and fellowship please repent of your words toward others about false gods you are clearly wrong and unbalanced because jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever and quote here's a quote from brother branham that i heard years ago which i use to help give an answer to the person who is criticizing our church for having a painting of jesus christ on the wall let's listen to the quote you say why do you need that you shouldn't have an image well then the same god that said don't make yourself any engraved in images the same god said build two turbans and tip their wings together and put them at the mercy seat where the people pray you see it's without understanding i love the balance that the holy ghost gave brother branham in this quote which is why i use it when people either accuse me or ask me about this topic friends if you condemn our church for having hoffman's painting displayed as we worship jesus christ because it's an image or picture then you have to condemn aaron for worshiping and talking to god in the midst of the two non-living images of angels or cherubim you would also have to condemn every wooden cross displayed around the world whether in public or in the church buildings so i see displaying pictures of christ or crosses as a christian liberty and of course we have to be careful with christian liberties but paul said not to let your good be spoken evil of in romans 14 verse 16 let not then your good be evil spoken of my convictions about hoffman's painting of christ the picture of jesus we display in our church was artwork by german heinrich hoffman who lived from 1824 to 1911 according to a couple different websites the name of the painting is christ and the rich young ruler painted around 1888 or 1889. i have no information about which church hoffman belonged to if he did belong to a church i only know that one website said he read his bible daily and he and his wife had no children the three reasons we display hoffman's painting are first it's a reminder of christ jesus our lord second it matches the isaiah 53 description of jesus having no calmlyness a man of sorrows and with no beauty and third god's prophet william branham said this painting was the closest to looking like the visions he had had of the lord jesus christ during his lifetime i'm going to give more detail now about these three reasons first pictures or images are acceptable as reminders of god in his word in deuteronomy chapter 6 god told moses to tell israel to constantly talk about his commands and even write his commands on the posts of their houses and on their gates displaying the images of god's word was pleasing to god as reminders as verse 12 shows god's warning to israel that they should not forget god once they moved into the promised land which the generation that knew not joshua and joshua's testimonies fulfilled to their shame deuteronomy 6 verses 6 through 9 say and these words which i command thee this day shall be in thine heart and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children and shall talk of them when thou sittest in thine house and when thou walkest by the way and when thou liest down and when thou rises up and thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes and thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house and on thy gates and then verse 12 says then beware lest thou forget the lord which brought thee forth out of the land of egypt from the house of bondage since jesus is the word of god according to john chapter 1 his words written out are images of himself or his nature or his character god did not forbid these visual reminders of himself but encourage them which is why we believe pictures of jesus and visual representations of scriptures and also jesus's words are completely acceptable just as god allowed the images of the cherubim another example is the brass serpent that god had moses form for the snake bitten people of israel they were told to look and live at the image but the brass image itself had no healing virtue in it it was representing what god was going to do with sin through the sacrifice of jesus christ israel looked and they were healed of their snake bites hundreds of years later though this image became an idol so we see god using images and statues like the cherubim and the brass serpent and as long as they were used correctly they were a blessing to the people of god but when the people became carnal these images became worthless or an object of worship such as in the case of the brass serpent which hezekiah had to destroy in second kings 18 because it had become such an idol to israel second we display the painting of jesus because isaiah 53 verses 2 and 3 describe jesus as the following for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of a dry ground he hath no form nor calmliness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him he is despised and rejected a man a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not notice verse 2 says he had no comeliness which means ornament splendor or majesty in the hebrew it also says jesus had no beauty that we should desire him in verse 3 it says christ was a man of sorrows now as we look at hoffman's picture of christ and the rich young ruler the rich young ruler has the splendor with his extravagant clothing and he looks beautiful and young even having a shaved face christ on the other hand looks sad like a man of sorrows as isaiah 53 says and he looks more rugged with a long beard and wavy uncombed hair hoffman's painting therefore seems to depict christ as isaiah 53 describes him third we display this painting of christ because god's prophet brother william branham said hoffman's painting of christ most resembled his visions of jesus which led him to have hoffman's painting of christ displayed in this home let's listen to the quote the first time i ever seen him look like a head of hoffman i'd never seen that before in a philly sunday's tabernacle years later i saw it my house had never been without one of the pictures since additionally some think acts 17 verse 29 forbids any artwork of jesus but they're wrong it reads for as much then as we are the offspring of god we ought not to think that the godhead is like unto gold or silver or stone graven by art and man's device this scripture doesn't forbid pictures images or anything else it says we should not think that the godhead is like gold silver or stone artwork made by man paul said this because at that moment in athens he was surrounded by idolaters who worshipped every false god and there were gold silver stone idols surrounding paul true holy ghost filled believers do not think the godhead can be captured or contained in any man-made artwork here's a helpful quote from gotquestions.org quote of course simply having a picture of jesus hanging in a home or church does not mean people are practicing idolatry it is possible that a portrait of jesus or a crucifix can become an object of worship in which case the worshiper is at fault but there is nothing in the new testament that would specifically forbid a christian from having a picture of jesus such an image could well be a reminder to pray to refocus on the lord or to follow in christ's footsteps but believers should know that the lord cannot be reduced to a two-dimensional image and that prayer or adoration is not to be offered to a picture a picture will never be a complete image of god or accurately displays glory and should never be a substitute for how we view god or deepen our knowledge of him and of course even the most beautiful representation of jesus christ is nothing more than one artist's conception of what the lord looked like end quote catholic veneration of statues and images friends catholics and other protestants venerate or honor pictures statues and other images which is sinful according to the american heritage dictionary venerate means first to regard with deep respect or reverence and second to regard with reverential respect to honor with mingled respect and awe to reverence to revere so true christians do not stand in awe at any two-dimensional or three-dimensional image of jesus or a cross or any other religious symbol my church and i do not give any worship or sinful veneration or sinful honor to picture statues or other images because there is no life in them we devote all worship and praise to the supernatural person of the lord jesus christ who currently sits on the right hand of the majesty on high and whose holy ghost abides in our souls on the other hand many catholics protestants and independents devote sinful veneration to statues and images which is why i wrote the following in my 2021 book about mystery babylon the roman catholic church pertaining to images the catechism of the catholic church states that the seventh ecumenical council at nicaea in the year 787 justified the veneration of images of christ the mother of god angels and all the saints which is in paragraph 21 31 in the catechism of the catholic church while this council may have justified the veneration of images and statues the bible never did catholics worldwide bow down to images kiss them rub them weep on them and further exalt them in a way that god never commanded towards any image or man-made statue as those behaviors bowing in worship kissing rubbing weeping while touching an image break the first commandment about having no other gods and making no graven image unto any likeness that is in heaven or on earth or in the water without a doubt due to the veneration of statues and images the spirit of idolatry lives in the roman catholic church and her daughters who follow her dogmas the spirit of idolatry is real in the roman catholic church and in many protestant churches who follow roman catholic traditions last fall a brother in christ named william and i visited numerous catholic churches in order to give them our christian books and resources that they might know the heir of their ways at one church the priests highly encourage his members to go out into their vestibule and purchase statues from a vendor from jerusalem who was selling them there was hundreds of statues and images out in the vestibule the priest encouraged them to use these statues as they said their monthly prayers which had a certain theme i can't remember what it was which no doubt would include idolatrous behaviors like bowing in worship to the images kissing the images and rubbing the images as the catechism of the catholic church plainly states in the book in closing i hope this video has been helpful to understand pictures images and other visual representations of christ the cross and other bible themes or persons again this is a wonderful exercise in rightly dividing the word of truth so there has to be a balance to this and thank god the holy spirit through the word of god and god's prophet to this age brother branham helped give us that much needed balance if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me god bless you and may jesus christ be the desire of your heart
