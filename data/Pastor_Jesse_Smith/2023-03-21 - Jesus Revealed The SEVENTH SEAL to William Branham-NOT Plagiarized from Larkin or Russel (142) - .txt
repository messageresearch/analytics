TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] wait a minute what is it it's the thing that Jesus said even the angels of heaven didn't know nothing about it greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to prove hopefully once and for all by God's grace that God's Prophet brother Bynum did not plagiarize the seventh seal from Charles Tay's Russell nor Clarence Larkin before we look at the seventh seal let's recall that so far within the first six seals there have been 33 differences between brother Branham and Charles Taze Russell and Clarence Larkin on the first four seals while the Rams accuser compared brother Branham to Charles Taze Russell only and there were 26 differences between brother Branham and Charles Taze Russell on the first four seals then on the fifth and sixth seals brother Ram's accuser compared brother Branham to Clarence Larkin only and there were seven more differences so 26 plus 7 comes to a total of 33 differences between brother Ram's Revelation from God and the incorrect teachings of Charles Taze Russell and Larkin on the first six seals and of course there were some similarities between brother Bynum and Clarence Larkin and Charles Taze Russell on the first six seals but the difference is greatly outweighed the similarities and remember this number 33 does not include the differences between brother Brenham and Clarence Larkin and Uriah Smith on the first four seals and also does not include the differences between brother Branham and Charles Taze Russell and Uriah Smith on the fifth and sixth seals so imagine the number of differences between brother Branham and those men on the other seals is likely in the 40s 50s or perhaps 60s and now with this video on the seventh seal there are five more differences between brother Branham and Charles Taze Russell and Clarence Larkin on the seventh seal for a grand total of 38 differences let's begin with the accusation on May 5th 2022 brother Rams accuser made a video called the theft of the seventh seal did William Branham intentionally mislead his followers and his accusations were quote it should be no surprise however that what he did say on the seventh seal was also copied from the writings of Charles Taze Russell and Clarence Larkin end quote and then brother Graham's accuser displayed the following words quote the revelation of the Seven Seals is simply cut and paste plagiarism end quote so obviously these are false accusations but of course I do want to say that brother Branham obviously used some of Larkin's work and wording on the seventh seal but as you'll see there was two great differences between brother Branham and Clarence Larkin also on brother Brown's accusers video from May 5th 2022 he used the quote from Brother Branham from the seventh seal where brother Adam said now I want to make this real clear everything ever believed on them and has read of other people has been contrary to what came to me in the room now in a previous video I said that this quote was likely brother and I'm using hyperbole so in one sense this quote could be hyperbole because brother Ram said everything he ever read and so of course brother random used some of Larkin's work especially on the Sixth Seal and as we'll see here some work on the seventh seal so this statement by Brother Branham is likely hyperbole but in another sense the statement by Brother Branham can be true so if brother random was just speaking generally about the Seven Seals then overall the 38 differences he had with Larkin Russell and Uriah Smith make his Revelation very different as a whole in the general sense now let's begin comparing brother random's Revelation on the seventh seal and Charles days Russell there are three main differences between Charles Taze Russell and brother Branham on the seventh seal first Charles says Russell said the Christian Church goes through persecution during the Great Tribulation period on page 143 of his book called The Finnish mystery Russell said quote about the space of half an hour on the scale of a year for a day this would mean but a week and indicates that as soon as the full number to complete the body of Christ have been sealed with the present truth persecution in a public way and on an unprecedented scale may be expected to begin almost immediately end quote now of course this differs from Brother Branham brother Ram said the bride of Christ does not go through persecution let's listen to two quotes one from the Feast of trumpets and then the second from questions and answers part one but here you again the bride will not go through that time [Applause] the church will but not the bride can't you see it ministers can't you see that brethren he said the church has to go through the persecution for the for the Perfection of it the blood of Jesus Christ perfectses the bride brother Branham will the bride go through the persecution as the early Apostolic Church did no I just explained that a few minutes ago no next thing is a Rapture now how anyone can get the church going through the tribulation I don't know but once you've got to go through the tribulation for it when God has not a sin I mean I don't mean the church the church will go through the tribulation but I'll talk about the bride the bride oh God bleached out it's not even a uh not even a snare of it nothing left before God but what's the intribulation to purify them but the others do the church does go through the tribulation but not the bride now of course brother Branham taught the foolish virgin goes through persecution but not the bride of Christ and Charles Hayes Russell did not teach this difference between the wise and foolish virgins the second difference is that Charles Hayes Russell taught the 144 000 believers who were sealed in their foreheads in Revelation chapter 7 was the Christian church as Russell's book says that Russell was likely from the tribe of Judah and of course brother random differed with this let's read Russell's quote on page 130 Russell wrote quote of the tribe of Judah were sealed twelve thousand Judah signifies celebrated lauded praised nothing is more praiseworthy than Justice noble-mindedness the doing to everybody as one would wish to be done by our Lord was the just one of the tribe of Judah all who knew Pastor Russell intimately recognized that Justice was the foundation principle of his character end quote and now play two quotes that show brother Ram taught the 144 000 was Israel or 144 000 Jewish believers who get sealed with the baptism of the Holy Ghost when Jesus returns to the Jews the first quote is from the 17th week of Daniel and the second quote is from the sardisian church age chapter 7 from the church age book let's listen to the quotes for now Israel is back in Palestine and soon the Lord will seal 144 000 of them the third difference is Charles Tays Russell said the seventh seal was fulfilled in Revelation 7 verse 2. notice that Russell said the seventh seal was actually the Seal of the Living God from Revelation 7 verse 2 that's different from Brother Branham brother Branham said the seventh seal is fulfilled and begins at the Rapture of the Gentile Church in Matthew 24 36. let's quote Russell on page 143 of his book he said quote had opened the seventh seal the Seal of the Living God Revelation 7 verse 2 the opening of The Seven Seals Progressive the opening and unfolding of the truth goes on as the Saints are sealed end quote of course brother Branham uses Matthew 24 36 to say the seventh seal begins at the Rapture of the Bride of Jesus Christ the Gentile Church it is the day and hour of the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ here are two quotes that plainly say that the first is from Christ is the mystery of God revealed 1963 and the second is from Souls that are imprisoned now again from 1963. let's listen to the quotes God's great mystery of how it's a secret he kept it a secret nobody know nothing about even the angels didn't understand it he he didn't reveal it that's the reason under our seventh um uh mystery when the seventh sea was open there was silence Jesus when he was on Earth they won't know when he would come he said it's not even the son himself don't know when it's going to happen see God has this all to himself it's a secret that's reasonable silence in heaven first base the Empire and seven Thunders are their voices and John was even forbidden to write it see the cunning of the Lord that's one thing he hasn't revealed yet and how he will come and when he will come it's a good thing that he doesn't a lamb took his book from the seventh seal is ready for it to be open The Sixth Seal remember he hid the seventh seal promise no one knew it was the coming of the Lord so our conclusion with Russell is that brother random did not plagiarize Charles Taze Russell as brother Ram's accusers video showed yes Russell believed the Revelation 10 verse 7 7th Angel was also the seventh angel of Revelation 3 verse 14. so that's the one thing brother Branham and Charles days Russell agreed on but of course Charles Tay's Russell was not that seventh angel brother Branham was that seventh angel and again there are three main differences between brother Bynum and Charles Taze Russell the first is that the Christian church does not go through the persecution in the tribulation the second is that the 144 000 are Jews who receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost when Jesus returns during the Great Tribulation period and not the Christian church and the third is that the seventh seal is the day and hour of Jesus's Rapture of the bride of Christ and not the ceiling of the 144 000 Jews in Revelation 7 verse 2. now let's compare Clarence Larkin and brother Branham on the seventh seal to begin with anyone who studied the seventh seal from Brother Branham and Clarence Larkin know that brother Branham quoted a few of Larkin's statements on the seventh seal such as Larkin saying the seventh seal extends down to the ushering into the millennium and the Seven Seals like a rocket fired in the air that may burst into seven stars and also of how the half hour silence was a nerve-breaking tension but in this video I want to show the two main differences between brother Branham and Clarence Larkin on the seventh seal the first is the very definition of the seventh seal Larkin said the definition is simply the period of Silent preparation before the trumpets Larkin said quote it was the period of Silent preparation for the awful judgments that were to burst forth in the earth under the trumpets and vials end quote so as you can see here's Larkin's timeline of the seventh seal notice it's in the first half of Daniel's 70th week and here the Seven Seals the silence and the golden sensor and also includes the golden altar and notice how the Seven Seals after the Sixth Seal the physical changes and the interval where a blood wash multitude is saved and also the 144 000 are sealed so brother bran did not teach this brother Ram said the seven seal begins with the day in hour of the Rapture of the Gentile bride and brother Ram defines the Seven Seals all the time from the Rapture a till the future home let's listen to the quote the things written in the seventh seal book sealed up of the Plan of Redemption from before the foundation world and every bit ends it is the end it is the end of the struggling world and end of struggling nature it's the end of everything in there is the end of the trumpets it's the end of the vials it's the end of the Earth it's a it's even the end of time time Runs Out the Bible said so Matthew the seventh chapter I mean Revelations the seventh chapter and one the seven first lyrics it's the end of the church age it's the the end of a seventh seal it's the end of the trumpets it's the end of the vowels and even in the ushering in of the millennium that's on the seventh seal recall the two previous quotes from Christ's mystery of God revealed Souls that are imprisoned now where brother Adam said the seventh seal was the coming of the Lord also here's another quote from the seventh seal sermon itself where brother Graham says the seventh seal is the day and hour of Jesus is coming for the Gentile bride let's listen to the quote at that time chance stand right he said go at it Jesus never spoke of it John couldn't run Angels know nothing about it amen what is it it's the thing that Jesus said even the angels of heaven didn't know nothing about it he didn't do it himself amen he said only God would know it amen but he told us when we begin to see these signs coming up yeah so without a doubt Larkin and brother Branham disagreed on the definition of the seventh seal brother random seven seal was more than just a period of Silent preparation it includes the moment of the Gentile Rapture and then the seven year Great Tribulation period followed by the battle of Armageddon followed by the fervent Heat that burns the outside of the earth before the Saints walk out into the Millennium and then it includes the millennium and also the Battle of Gog and Magog at the end of the millennium and then also seems to include the great white Throne judgment and then the seventh seal ends when the future home begins the second difference between brother Branham and Clarence Larkin is the timing Larkin said the seventh seal is after the Sixth Seal again let's look at Larkin's chart here so you can see the seventh seal starts about the middle of first half of Daniel's 70th week after the rise of the Antichrist and also after the ceiling of the 144 000 Jews brother Ram did not teach this brother random said the seven seal starts at the Rapture of the Gentile Church it is the unknown day and hour when Jesus comes to snatch away the Gentile bride so brother Ram 7 seal starts well before Clarence Larkin's seventh seal regarding the timing of the seventh seal notice on Larkin's chart here you can see Larkin seven seal starts where the red highlight is and it's at about the middle of Daniel's first half of his 70th week but notice also the green highlight that's where brother branham's seventh seal starts and if anyone studies brother random seals very carefully you'll understand that the fifth sixth and seventh seals begin almost simultaneously for example we've heard how brother random said the Seven Seals the day and hour of the Rapture that's true immediately after the seven seal starts the Sixth Seal starts because then God goes back to Israel after he's raptured his Gentile bride off the Earth and the six seal as brothers also said was the entire 70th week of Daniel so right after the Rapture of the Gentile Church the seven seal opens it's the moment of the seven seal opening and then after the church is raptured up the Sixth Seal begins and then also sometime after the Rapture the souls that are under the altar in the fist seal cry out and say Lord how long until our blood is Avenged on them that are on the earth so that's a little deeper understanding on the fifth six and seven seals that brother gave us but of course also remember on the fifth seal those Jewish Souls included Jews from the time of Jesus crucifixion through the entire church ages including those Jews martyred in the Holocaust and then we'll include Jews that have to be martyred during the Great Tribulation period so here's a timeline of what brother random seventh seal would look like seven sea would open at the day and hour of Jesus Rapture the bride would go up and then the Sixth Seal would instantly begin which is the seven year Great Tribulation period shortly after the Sixth Seal the fifth seal the mapping in reality form where the souls would cry out for vengeance and then the Sixth Seal would end after the battle of Armageddon but the seventh seal would keep going on into the Millennium the Battle of Gaga Magog the great white Throne judgment and then time would be no more at the future home and that's when the seventh seal would end when time would be no more friends one reason there's so much confusion about whether the seven seal is open or not is because people don't understand that brother Branham said there's three forms to each seal the ram said this in the first seal he said quote the first seal opened the first seal when it was open in the symbol form it thundered now what about when it's opened in its reality form first is with God next it's in a symbol then it's revealed three things end quote so here's a simple chart I made years ago that show the dates of each form so the first seal was also the first Thunder of the seven Thunders the symbol form was given us around 90 A.D the reality was in 30 to 385 A.D and the Revelation was March 18 1963 when brother random preached it the second seal was also the second Thunder its symbol form was 90 A.D the reality form was through about 385 to 1095 A.D and the Revelation form was given to us on March 19 1963. the third seal was also the third Thunder the symbol form was given around 90 A.D to Saint John the reality form was about 1095 to 1906 A.D and the Revelation form came on March 20th 1963. the four seal was also the fourth Thunder the symbol form was given to us in 90 A.D from Saint John the Rowdy Forum was from 1906 to the present time and the Revelation form was given to us on March 21 1963. the fifth seal was also the fifth Thunder the symbol form was given by John in 90 A.D the reality form is still in the future it's right after the Rapture where those literal Jewish Souls under the altar will cry out for vengeance the Revelation form was given on March 22 1963. The Sixth Seal was also the sixth Thunder the symbol form was given by John 90 A.D the reality form is still in the future it is the entire seven-year Great Tribulation period and the Revelation was given on March 23 1963. now this seal the seventh seal was also the seventh under brother random observed there was no symbol given for the seventh seal but only one description the silence in heaven [Music] you omitted revealing even any symbol of the seven ones perfect secret with God notice and we're going to read in the Bible in the the seventh seal that's found in Revelations the eighth chapter and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of a half hour and that's all we have the reality form is in the future it's the unknown day and hour of Jesus Rapture of the Gentile bride of Christ the Revelation form was given to us on March 24th 1963 when brother Brandon said he saw a fold of it was open and of course that was the understanding that it was the day and hour of the Rapture according to Matthew 24 verse 36 as brother Branham quoted in the sermon let's listen to the quote notice Jesus never spoke of it John couldn't run Angels know nothing about it amen what is it it's the thing that Jesus said even the angels of heaven didn't know nothing about it okay he didn't do it himself amen he said only God would know it amen but he told us when we begin to see these signs coming up right all right now you're getting somewhere and next let's compare brother Branham and Uriah Smith on the seventh seal brother Branham and Uriah Smith agreed that the seventh seal was the personal appearing of Christ on page 453 of his book Uriah Smith said quote the personal appearing of Christ must therefore be allotted to the next seal end quote nowhere brother Bynum and Uriah Smith differed is that Uriah Smith said the raptured saints were the 144 000 of the tribes of Israel in Revelation chapter 7 and he said the Seal of the Living God was the fact that these 144 000 Christians kept Saturday as the Sabbath day on page 443 Uriah Smith said quote we conclude then that the angel ascending from the East having the seal the Living God is a Divine messenger in charge of a work of Reform to be carried on among men in reference to the Sabbath the fourth Commandment the Agents of this work on the Earth are of course Ministers of Christ for to men is given the commission of instructing their fellow men in Bible truth end quote of course brother Branham disagreed as we've already showed brother Brandon believed the 144 000 were Jewish people or the Israelis that will accept Jesus Christ as Messiah and be seal with the baptism of the Holy Ghost in their souls and of course this means Uriah Smith believes the Rapture is after Revelation chapter 7 verse 2 the sealing of the 144 000 and that's much different than brother Brandon brother Brown believe the Rapture was before God seals the 144 000 Jews another difference is that Uriah Smith said the half hour of Silence was seven days urisma said quote the length of this period of Silence if we consider it prophetic time would be about seven days end quote now of course brother Rand never told us the length of the silence when the seventh seal opened all he told us is that it was Jesus coming down from heaven with a dead in Christ and the heavens had to be silent because God's spirit was in Christ and Christ left heaven to come down and Rapture the Saints so let's listen to the quote it's from the sardisian church age 1960. where is this big fell of God damn amen see he's in Christ so we conclude brother Brown did not plagiarize Uriah Smith on the seventh seal in closing friends I hope this video has been a blessing now we're at the total of 38 differences between brother Branham and Charles Taze Russell and Clarence Larkin on the revelation of the Seven Seals so we can say without a doubt that Jesus the Lord Jesus Christ by his Holy Spirit and also through his Angel revealed the revelation of the Seven Seals to brother Branham let's pray again for brother Ram's accusers as I have not heard from any of them regarding my videos on these Seven Seals but Lord willing in the future I'll share them with them and hopefully they'll humble themselves and repent if not I'll keep praying for them by God's grace father God please be with brother bram's accusers God I pray the truth on these videos would be so clear that brother Ram's accusers would repent of their misinterpretations of their Slanders and would humble themselves in your holy presence may they do honest research and may they speak what is honest and true Lord Jesus all things are possible with you so Lord I ask that their hearts would be humbled and they could repent and correct their false assumptions their false research and lies about your true Prophet brother Branham ask all this in the Holy Name of Jesus Amen if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
