TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] to either follow the word of God who will lose extreme to believe every word that you say to be true but they do believe that their own actions prove that they don't I can't interpret his word not Machinery mechanical devices greetings friends in the mattress name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to continue the series showing the 24 plus Lies coming out of Branham Tabernacle located in Jeffersonville Indiana USA today by God's grace we'll cover the 11th and 12th lies but before that I just want to address a few comments I've received on these YouTube videos overall the videos have been well received and I'm grateful for that I'm thankful for that there's just been a few people that feel I shouldn't make these videos so let me address that just briefly I want to remind everyone that I privately contacted leadership at Brenham Tabernacle about four years ago about these issues and they failed to repent and then I kept contacting them via email over the last three or four years and they fail to repent and then friends the number of Lies continued to grow and it grew so large that I felt like I needed to share some of these lies publicly I just thought I would share all of random Tabernacles lies publicly because they influence so many people and because brother Branham did the same thing yes brother Branham himself publicly rebuked the deity spirit that was making him Jesus Christ and friends I know Brenham Tabernacle is not calling William Branham Jesus Christ but in effect they're doing the same thing in the sermon Revelation chapter 5 part 1 from June 11 1961 brother Brandon Begins the sermon in a shocking way saying that he's leaving the field and that he'll probably only minister in Jeffersonville because there was a group of Brethren that were baptizing in the name of William Branham and saying that William Branham was Jesus Christ brother random said quote it's a spirit on precious people end quote he hoped that it would receive a deadly wound and die out quickly now according to brother Branham the brothers repented of this Spirit shortly thereafter the sermon but then we know this Spirit became more deceptive and instead of calling William Branham Jesus Christ this evil spirit made every word of William Branham thus saith the Lord in other words every word of William Branham was infallible well that's the same as the Lord Jesus Christ every word the Lord Jesus Christ said was and is infallible so the spirit just became more deceptive this evil Antichrist Spirit brother random calls it he also said he saw a vision of it and it was like a serpent and so this evil spirit never died it just changed its form and then a few years after brother random died the spirit Came Upon Branham Tabernacle and removed Ormond Neville as pastor and then went to a series of pastors who basically idolized every word on tape of brother Branham of course it continues today and just seems to get worse with each passing year so that's my answer to people that would say why are you publicly addressing Brenham tabernacle's lies well my answer is because brother Branham would address these type of evil spirits and he would do it publicly and Friends brother random said repeatedly that prophets make mistakes I could say I'm a man anything else they made their mistakes brother Ram said he was not infallible Ram said be careful how you're listening to differentiate between The Human Side versus the prophetic side see I've always asked you to be careful what you're listening to I think there's so much of it that it's just the human side but always if there is something that goes forth it will speak it it's thus saith the Lord and that's reason I say that now that there is any uh any prophecy concerning and I have nothing on it from the Lord I could be all together wrong am I thought about Martin Luther King I don't know I can't say if that's just my opinion Brother Brad said he made mistakes all the time on tape such as saying 700 instead of 7 000 that did not bow the need to bail and of course all my videos have taught this over the last few years I'm another person asked me don't you think you're doing more harm than good by making these videos about jeffersonville's lies I think the answer is no I think I'm doing more good than harm I don't think I'm doing any harm at all because if you read First Corinthians 13 the Bible says charity rejoices in the truth and charity is the Holy Ghost so the spirit of Truth is the Holy Ghost anyone who has the spirit of Truth in their soul they're born again will rejoice in these videos that expose Satan's lies and friends it's a shame some people think it does damage to expose false preachers and false prophets yet the Bible plainly tells us to rebuke them that sin and to Mark those who cause divisions and avoid them and there's numerous other Bible scriptures that tell us to rebuke and correct false teachers and false prophets and so I asked one person on a comment I said do you think it's good to not say anything about a preacher or Pastor spreading over 24 lies from his pulpit and then even more lies from his blog post you think it's better just to let those lies go out and have no voice that's going to correct it of course the answer is no we should correct lies that preachers are telling and just like brother Branham said love is corrective so if we have the real genuine love of Jesus Christ we'll correct our brothers by the grace of God sometimes privately sometimes publicly brother Branham publicly corrected numerous people and so if brother Brown was led by the Holy Ghost to correct people publicly in Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever then the spirit of God will do that at times today as well there's no verse that says only prophets can correct people and the bibles are absolute as brother random said the Bible was his absolute Paul told Timothy to rebuke them that sin before all Paul told Timothy to rightly divide the word of Truth and so Timothy was likely just a local pastor and so the prophet was telling the local pastors to correct these lies and to stand upon the truth so that's what we're doing today by God's grace and we'll continue to do it as the Lord gives us inspiration and Grace so now review the first 10 lies before we get into the 11th and 12th lie lie number one is every word on tape is thus saith the Lord plus the tapes can never be wrong plus the tapes have no mistakes plus the tapes have every answer the second lie is all answers are on the tapes the third lie is to unquestionably believe every word on tape is thus safe is thus say the Lord even if brother Branham lied the fourth lie is a false vision of a denominational mandate to play the tapes and every church is a tape Church the fifth lies that the tapes are the token and being a part of a tape church is the token the six lies that tape boys are the true faithful Ministry and tapes are number one in the fivefold ministry the seventh lies that brother random spirit and soul are are identical to Jesus Christ's spirit and soul the eighth lie is that brother Branham still has a living Ministry and anyone that doesn't believe that is equivalent to Demas the ninth lie is that revelation 22 verse 16 is Jesus telling us all to be taped churches as the perfect will of God and the tenth lie is that the angel of revelation 22 verses 6 through 9 and verse 16 is brother Branham now moving on to the 11th lie the eleventh lie is closely related to the first lie random tabernacle's leadership said the tapes are the absolute and I have three evidences of this false Doctrine before I go through those three evidences remember I just want to reference I made a video directly on this topic so if you like more quotes from Brother Branham on this topic watch the video called William branham's absolute was Jesus Christ not his tapes it's my 73rd video so there will be some overlap with this video and the 73rd video so the first evidence is audio of Branham tabernacle's leadership saying they believe every word on tape is thus saith the Lord because the tapes are their absolute let's listen to the audio of this lie [Music] brother Minister brother had spoken to you about speaking about myself he said that you have to realize [Applause] [Music] everything that broke around [Music] amen I believe everything man says [Music] to be my absolutely now that we've heard this lie we must Define the word absolute as brother Branham did Brother Branham used a Webster's dictionary to define the word absolute and brother Ram said absolute means Unlimited in power it's perfect in itself Unlimited in its power we are nearly an ultimate so Branham Tabernacle is saying the tapes are Unlimited in power every word on tape is Unlimited in its power and this is a complete contradiction to what brother Brando said brother Ram said quote I have no power within myself to do anything end quote and he said quote I don't have power you don't have any power none of us does end quote the son of God myself I have power to stop you I am tired to make any of these women clean up but in this man just listen to this paper or whatever it is I'm careless but I do have the authority of God's word if I had power to heal anybody I certainly would do it I sure would I know what it means to be sick I have no power to heal no other man does if he does then what happened to Calvary so these two simple quotes prove brother Ram's words cannot be the absolute because by definition the absolute means Unlimited in power friends we all know there's only one person Unlimited in power and that's the Lord Jesus Christ so the Lord Jesus Christ is the absolute and the absolute appears in two forms the first form is Jesus's spiritual theophany that he's in right now and that theophany can also change his form and be the Holy Ghost in our church services in our lives in our souls that's one form of the absolute and the other form of the absolute is the Holy Bible as brother Branham said it's the absolute record it's the record that's Unlimited in power Unlimited in truth it's the Judgment standard it's the word of God that contains the mysteries of God the revelation of God it's the mind of God on paper and that's another form of the absolute as brother Ram said his absolute is the word of God is the Holy Bible so this simple definition of the absolute proves Brenham tabernacle's leadership as a spirit of idolatry anointing them they idolize the tapes of course this is ridiculous but it's also evidence of a strong spiritual delusion they've rejected the spirit of Truth and they have a spirit of a lie a spirit of error and this Spirit of error that they have on them is so apparent because they can't even answer five simple questions with a yes or no answer I've repeatedly emailed the people at vog and Branham Tabernacle these five simple questions and they will never respond they will not give me a yes or no answer because if they did they would contradict the statements of brother Branham on tape for example if number one is Billy Paul that promised Joseph or not brother Branham said he was in 1951 but they won't answer that because if they say yes well then Joseph is in the promise Joseph if they say no then they deny brother Ram's quote so they're trapped in a corner like brother Ram said that's what the Holy Spirit does it puts Satan in a corner and then Satan can't get out of the corner so this Antichrist Spirit won't answer yes or no it'll just avoid the question and yet the Bible says in First Peter 3 15 that we should always have an answer ready of the hope that's within us so thankfully by the grace of God the true five-fold Ministry preachers who are anointed with the true Holy Ghost can answer this question and the answer is no Billy Paul was not the promise Joseph Joseph Branham was a promise Joseph other brand I had to grow in his understanding of the prophecy that God gave to him about his second and final son second question does the third person of the Trinity burn in your heart yes or no brother random said in 1952 the third person of the Trinity burned in his heart and the believer's hearts I asked this question to the pastor Branham Tabernacle and he didn't say yes or no he just said I believe every word on tape so again because of the spirit of idolatry that they have on them they can't say yes or no if they say yes then they're a trinitarian and brother Branham said trinitarianism is of the devil if they say no then they have to deny this quote from brother Brandon from 1952 and say it's not inspired well what's the truth the truth is brother random at first believed in the Trinity but then he grew to understanding God showed them the Revelation that God is only one person so he was wrong in 1952 and God gave him greater understanding and then he corrected it later on in his ministry the third question is does brother random have anything to do with the seventh Church age messenger or not yes or no and they won't answer this question in 1961 brother random said quote I'm going to be as honest as I can be I don't think I'd have anything to do with that messenger end quote so if they say yes brother RAM does have something to do with the seven Church age messenger and they go against this quote they contradict brother Branham if they say no then they're saying they don't believe brother Branham was the seventh Church A's messenger so again the devil is trapped in a corner and they can't say yes or no it reminds us that the Pharisees in math in Mark 11 when they asked Jesus about his authority Jesus asked them to answer a question first before he would answer their question and he asked him about John the Baptist the baptism of John was it from heaven or of men answer me and of course they wouldn't answer that's just like Branham Tabernacle and vog today they just won't answer these questions think how sad it is that Branham Tabernacle can't tell whether Billy Paul or Joseph is the promise Joseph they can't tell whether the third person Burns in their heart or not they can't tell whether brother Branham has anything to do with the seven churches messenger or not a fourth question is did Arizona have another generation after 1965 yes or no brother Branch said quote we can't have another generation end quote in God's provided place of worship the real answer is yes Arizona did have another generation and the fifth and final question is did Rebecca in Genesis chapter 24 marry a woman yes or no brother Ram said Rebecca married quote her bride end quote brother random said it on numerous occasions of course it was just a slip of the tongue but random Tabernacle leaders can't answer the question did Rebecca marry a woman or not in Genesis chapter 24 they can't answer it of course the answer is no Rebecca married Isaac a man but they can't admit that because they worship every word on the tape they have the spirit of idolatry and Friends remember that 73rd video I made in that video I have quotes for brother William said the absolute is a person so the tapes are not a person the tapes cannot be the absolute well the ram said there's only one absolute not 1 180 plus sermons are the absolute there's only one absolute and brother random said there is no other absolute so it's a person it's one person so it cannot be tapes Amber the ram said the absolute is always Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ is not a tape friends remember brother random never said the tapes were the absolute brother Brandon said quote God is the absolute end quote and God is not a set of tapes foreign amazing Christianity arguments the Bible said so makes it right yes sir before moving on just remember a few of these statements brother Branham said about the absolute I'm going to go through these kind of quickly but he said the absolute was the person of Jesus Christ he said any christ-centered life is the absolute a christ-centered call is the absolute Christ is the absolute Jesus Christ is the absolute and then he said the word the Bible is the absolute Christ's word is the absolute God's absolute is the word well the ram said quote that word end quote is the absolute well Ram said the word of God and the word of the Living God is the absolute and then he said the new birth is the absolute and he said fill with the Holy Ghost that's your absolute and then he said it's the same absolute the same Pillar of Fire friends anyone who can't see what the absolute is is deceived and they're in danger of not being the elect the Bible said the elect cannot be deceived now of course every elect child will wake up from their spiritual blindness and put the I Salvo the anointing of the Holy Ghost on their eyes and be able to see the truth and recognize the truth that Jesus Christ his Bible and his own spiritual person are the two forms of the one absolute God is the absolute and his character is expressed to us in the written form of the Bible the second evidence is a letter from Branham tabernacle's leadership and friends I have the letter right here I'll probably show a few screenshots of it on the video here but the leadership at Branham Tabernacle said quote it must be all or nothing I have to believe that everything on tape is thus say the Lord and the absolute the token for our day and I must unquestioning believe every word of brother random on tape end quote this is a sad delusional statement brother Branham never made all of his words All or Nothing brother Ram never said all my words are thus saith the Lord in fact there's many quotes for brother bam says this is not the Lord saying this brother bran literally said be careful what you're listening to like in he cares you care in 1963. again brother Ram never set his tapes for the absolute nor was every word on tape the absolute brother Brandon never said my tapes are the token brother random never said believe my every word unquestionably and I have an entire video about brother Branham welcoming correction another man was corrected by the angel of the Lord by his wife by brother sharet my brother Brandon wanted ministers who are theologians sitting on the platform with him to correct him if he was wrong theologians behind me and uh maybe they'll correct me when I'm wrong but I hope so brother Branham said I'm not infallible I'm your brother and friends if Brandon tabernacle's leadership believes every word on tape is thus say the Lord and the tapes have all the answers then why won't the leaders and their workers answer my five simple questions because the tapes have all the answers the fact is they're deceived and so they cannot answer the questions just like the Pharisees and Fifth and finally is a blog post from Branham tabernacle's website from October 22nd 2022 the blog post says quote do you think brother Branham and or his tapes are the absolute brother random is not my absolute but the message he spoke on tape is absolutely my absolute many people say that is incorrect the Bible's the absolute my friend the Bible and the message on tape are the same thing that is the very essence of the message the message on tapes is the interpretation of the Bible they are one in the same end quote of course friends this is a delusional statement the Bible and the tapes are not the same like brother random said the tapes point us to the Bible because the Bible is the absolute that's where we point to Jesus Christ the son of God grant that he'll be so real to everyone here today even to the little children that he'll become the absolute of the entire congregation we asked in Jesus name amen there's numerous quotes where a few different people tried to tell brother Branham that his sermons could be Revelation chapter 23 and brother Ram said no you can't do that because you can't add one word or take one word away from the Bible because the Bible was the absolute and revelation 22 verses 18 and 19 warns us we cannot add to the Bible or take away from the Bible so Branham tabernacle's leadership has this deity spirit this idolatrous Spirit on them where they want to idolize everything on the tapes friends it's an easy fact to prove that the tapes are not the same as the Bible there are so many things on tape that are not in the Bible for example the Bible doesn't say total Annihilation will come to the United States and the world before 1977. the Bible never says that the Bible never says women have sperm like brother random said in 1965. and Friends there's over 80 more examples of things brother Branham said that were not in the Bible and things that he said that were just mistakes human mistakes yet he's still a prophet of God here's a quote where other Brandon said God will never add one word to the Bible so brother Ram's tapes cannot be the same thing as the Bible let's listen to the quote you never add one word or take one word away from it from it you'll stay exactly on that you'll never leave that Bible here's a quote from the unveiling of God 1964 where someone tried to catch brother Branham saying that brother branham's word could write a Bible but brother random picked up on that deity spirit and said you can't do that because the Bible cannot be added to nor taken away from let's listen to the quote is always write it not he said say that you read it not see these seven Thunders under their voices see and he said don't write that see but it's be sealed up in the boat until the last days if the Lord God said if if with your experience that the Lord has given you for his people humbly seeing this said you'd be eligible to add up a Bible yourself you're aware of God is manifested I said that might be true see he's trying to catch me one word cannot be added or taken away I said no sir it would be adding something to her taking something that's all revealed in there and the Seven Seals opened up the Revelation what that was still never leave that word it'll stay right with the word blinding Simon Open the Eyes they will always do that and notice friends random tabernacle's leadership uses the word essence just like the trinitarians use the word essence to say well there's one God but in essence he's three persons or three persons have the same Essence but it's still one God whose three persons so they use this word essence to try to make two things the same that are not the same the tapes are not the same as the Bible just like three individual persons co-equal persons are not the same as one person so I think it's fitting that Brenham Tabernacle is using the same word a Catholic uses in order to convince people of a false Doctrine because that's what they're doing they're using the word essence to make the tapes and the Bible the same just like trinitarians are using the word essence to make three persons the same as one person on this October 22nd 2022 blog post Brenham Tabernacle leadership goes on to say quote the simple fact is number one the Bible is the word number two the word comes the prophet and number three the prophet is the only Divine interpreter the word end quote now friends I believe the Bible's plain that prophets give the revelation of the word the Bible says numerous times that the word of the Lord comes to the prophet but Branham Tabernacle leadership is contradicting other quotes from Brother Branham where brother Branham says he can't interpret God's word so Branham to Tabernacle says brother Branham is the only one who interpret God's word but then brother Brown says I can't interpret God's word so who's right of course the Bible's right the truth is profits can only interpret the word of God that God sends to them prophets can only interpret what God lets them interpret but let's first listen to this quote from 1964 where brother Branham says God don't need any interpreter I can't interpret his word neither can anybody interpret his word end quote let's listen to the quote [Music] that settles it 'll tell this event he does it himself now friends in context brother randoms right no man with his own ability can interpret the word of God but God will share the interpretation with a prophet and then the prophet will make it known to the people so this statement is true from Brother Branham I can't interpret his word nobody can prophets have to wait on God for any interpretation and then the prophet receives God's interpretation and shares that with the people now what's interesting is eight days later after brother Ram said he can't interpret the word he said the characteristic of a prophet is that he can interpret the word so first glance these two quotes look like they contradict each other but they don't when you really think about it deeply like brother Ram told us we got to think really deeply on subjects or else we're going to get deceived the truth is a prophet cannot interpret the word by himself he needs God the prophet needs God to interpret the word share it with him and then the prophet shares God's interpretation with the people the other quotes have to be true too where God doesn't need any interpretation to his word so in summary I think all these quotes from brother Brandon and these scriptures from the Bible prove that brother Ram's tapes are not the absolute the Bible is the absolute Jesus Christ is the absolute it's a shame Branham Tabernacle doesn't have the same absolute as brother Branham the man that their Tabernacle is named after the 12th lie is that make Believers and unbelievers will not play tapes primarily in their worship services here's audio from Bradham tabernacle's leadership saying the make-believer doesn't know whether or not they should play tapes or preach the gospel let's listen to this live [Music] is the truth you know that that's the believer unbeliever you guys are nice man I mean you're talking about this God God inflation lived in place the unbeliever the make-believer said man I don't know I don't want to play in the tapes is really right or not it could be I don't know my pastor says if I play tapes in church if we listen to them I'm just a lazy Pat and make believe look it's the worm it's the word that's that one she don't know if you don't know I don't know maybe it is maybe it's right maybe it's not my friends previously I showed the LIE where Branham Tabernacle leadership called anyone a Demas who didn't believe brother random still had a live Ministry that brother Branham wasn't dead so now Branham Tabernacle leadership is doing a second instance of name calling first they called the fivefold ministry preachers Demas and now they're calling five full ministry preachers make-believers well it doesn't stop there on a July 10 2022 blog post random Tabernacle leadership said quote you've got to leave every Tittle and every jot and everything that's said in there it's got to be true if you say I don't believe that some is God some is man some of it is just hunting stories well then you're an unbeliever the believer don't question the believer believes it regardless of what it sounds like or what anybody else has got to say about it how impossible it seems to be we believe it end quote so now Branham Tabernacle leadership does a third instance of name calling so think about this Brenham Tabernacle is calling the men who are actually obeying Ephesians 4 verse 11 Freedom Tabernacles calling them Demas make-believers and unbelievers and Friends remember Satan is the accuser of the brother remember there are no quotes from brother Brandon where he says every word I say is from God well the brand never says every word on my tapes is thus saith the Lord renam Tabernacle is constantly saying things brother Graham did not say their slogan is press play and Obey but they completely contradict the slogan that they say they believe they won't obey the quotes or brother Branham says I won't always be your pastor where brother bran says be very careful what you're listening to where brother Ram says I make their mistakes all the time on tape where brother Ram said there's Mix-Ups on the tapes friends remember when Branham Tabernacle tells people they have to believe every word on the tape and it's all from God they're actually contradicting even more scripture like acts 17 11 where the bereans search the Scriptures Daily to prove whether the thing were from God that Paul was preaching and Branham Tabernacle also neglects first Thessalonians 5 21 prove all things and brother Brandon repeatedly said that prove me by the Bible test me by the word prove all things and also first John chapter 4 says try every spirit and second Timothy says rightly divide the word of Truth and I don't know I don't plan the tapes is really right or not it could be a kind of the make-believer every matter and feels a call of God upon his life get into the ministry start preaching we need them any man is called of God he's the preach the gospel how can evangelists continue on the field in this hour of course want to meet certainly by all means don't change the thing to bring up this [Applause] time [Applause] [Applause] and to be a minister please what is this in closing friends I hope this video has been a blessing I know I said some harsh things I said some very straightforward things but please know that I pray often for the people at Branham Tabernacle I pray for them to repent of all their lies there's over 24 lies and so each time I make these videos I pray for them and when I think of it at church I'll pray for them as well friends as Matthew Chapter 13 tells us this is Harvest Time all seeds must come to maturity and they'll reveal by their fruit either genuine fruit or corrupt fruit what kind of seed they are so let's pray for people to repent and manifest the true seed of God like First Peter 1 23 says Born Again of The Incorruptible seed the word of God and if you're born again of the word of God you won't deny the revelation of the word of God you will not worship brother Branham you will not idolize the tapes if you're really born again by the Holy Ghost if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music] foreign [Music]
