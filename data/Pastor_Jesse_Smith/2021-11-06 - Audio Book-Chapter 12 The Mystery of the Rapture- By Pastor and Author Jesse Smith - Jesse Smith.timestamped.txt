[0:00] chapter 12 the mystery of the rapture
[0:04] chapter 12 contains footnotes numbers
[0:06] 1793-1897
[0:12] behold i show you a mystery we shall not
[0:15] all sleep but we shall all be changed in
[0:18] a moment in the twinkling of an eye at
[0:21] the last trump for the trumpet shall
[0:23] sound and the dead shall be raised
[0:25] incorruptable and we shall be changed
[0:28] first corinthians 15
[0:30] verses 51 and 52
[0:34] it is only fitting that the final
[0:36] mystery is the rapture of jesus christ
[0:38] bride the new testament church because
[0:41] the rapture will be the final event of
[0:43] the times of the gentiles
[0:45] immediately after the rapture of the
[0:46] gentile bride god will graft israel back
[0:49] into the holy tree and send her the two
[0:52] prophets mentioned in revelation 11
[0:54] verses 3 through 13.
[0:58] the rapture is the unknown day and hour
[1:00] jesus christ secretly and physically
[1:02] comes back to earth christ will stop in
[1:05] the air not touching the sin soaked
[1:07] earth
[1:08] to eagerly receive his bride for their
[1:10] wedding day before returning to heaven
[1:13] with her for the wedding reception the
[1:15] marriage supper the lamb
[1:18] as recorded in the epigraph paul
[1:20] specifically calls this event a mystery
[1:23] thankfully the bible promised that all
[1:25] the mysteries of god including the
[1:27] rapture mystery would be revealed in the
[1:30] end times
[1:31] revelation 10 verse 7 says the mystery
[1:33] of god would be finished or revealed and
[1:36] then the revelation would be taken and
[1:37] prophesied before many peoples and
[1:40] nations and tongues and kings
[1:43] god is currently fulfilling this
[1:44] prophecy by anointing and sending
[1:47] apostles and evangelists to prophesy
[1:49] again all the revelations of the new
[1:51] testament mysteries
[1:54] the word rapture is not in the king
[1:56] james bible but many christians use it
[1:58] because it gives us a common term
[2:01] referring to this momentous future event
[2:03] however the bible also gives other names
[2:06] for the rapture the caught up meeting or
[2:09] the first resurrection
[2:12] some may argue that christians should
[2:13] not use the word rapture because like
[2:16] the trinity it is not found in the bible
[2:18] the difference is that the definition of
[2:20] the rapture is fully scriptural while
[2:23] the definition of the trinity god in
[2:25] three persons is completely absent from
[2:27] god's word it's completely acceptable to
[2:30] use the term rapture
[2:33] the holy spirit will perform six
[2:35] raptures with four already occurring and
[2:38] two upcoming
[2:39] enoch in genesis 5 24
[2:43] elijah in second kings 2 verse 11
[2:46] jesus ascending to the father alone
[2:49] in john 20 17.
[2:52] jesus ascending with the old testament
[2:54] saints leading captivity captive to
[2:56] heaven in mark 16 verse 19 and ephesians
[3:00] 4 verse 8
[3:01] the gentile bride rapture first
[3:04] thessalonians 4 verses 15-17
[3:07] and the rapture of the two witnesses in
[3:09] revelation 11 verses 11 and 12.
[3:14] the confusion about the rapture
[3:16] the confusion about the rapture centers
[3:18] around when it will occur
[3:21] bible students believe the rapture will
[3:22] take place in one of three different
[3:24] future times
[3:26] centering around the major event of the
[3:28] great tribulation
[3:29] will the rapture take place before
[3:32] during or after the great tribulation
[3:36] the revelation of the rapture mystery is
[3:38] jesus uses a shout voice and trump to
[3:42] secretly and suddenly snatch away his
[3:44] holy spirit filled bride off the earth
[3:48] as the last climatic culminating event
[3:51] of the times of the gentiles before the
[3:53] wrathful tribulation
[3:56] a fourth and smaller group believes the
[3:58] rapture has already taken place
[4:00] thankfully we can know surely that the
[4:02] rapture has not yet happened and is a
[4:05] future event
[4:06] paul's last letter before his martyrdom
[4:09] condemned those who said the rapture or
[4:11] resurrection was passed already saying
[4:14] their false doctrine was overthrowing
[4:16] the faith of some
[4:18] the apostle also wrote to titus saying
[4:20] that christians should deny worldly
[4:22] lusts in this present world
[4:24] looking for that blessed hope and the
[4:26] glorious appearing of the great god and
[4:29] our savior jesus christ
[4:32] the rapture is the future event all
[4:34] christians are still looking for 2 000
[4:36] years later the appearing of our lord
[4:38] jesus christ in the air
[4:42] there is also confusion about who will
[4:43] be in the rapture
[4:45] is it for everyone on earth all those
[4:47] who call themselves christians or just a
[4:49] small faithful spirit-filled remnant of
[4:52] christians
[4:55] biblical proof for the revelation about
[4:57] the rapture
[4:59] to begin with the bible defines the
[5:01] rapture mystery as the caught up
[5:03] experience paul teaches about in first
[5:06] corinthians 15
[5:07] verses 51-54 and first thessalonians 4
[5:11] verses 15-18 respectively
[5:15] behold i show you a mystery we shall not
[5:18] all sleep but we shall all be changed in
[5:20] a moment in the twinkling of an eye at
[5:23] the last trump for the trumpet shall
[5:25] sound and the dead shall be raised
[5:27] incorruptible and we shall be changed
[5:30] for this corruptible must put on
[5:32] incorruption and this mortal must put on
[5:34] immortality
[5:36] so when this corruptible shall put on
[5:38] incorruption and this mortal shall put
[5:40] on immortality
[5:42] then shall be brought to pass the saying
[5:44] that is written death is swallowed up in
[5:46] victory
[5:48] for this we say unto you by the word of
[5:50] the lord that we which are alive and
[5:52] remain unto the coming of the lord shall
[5:55] not prevent them which are asleep for
[5:57] the lord himself shall descend from
[5:59] heaven with a shout with the voice of
[6:01] the archangel and with the trump of god
[6:04] and the dead in christ shall rise first
[6:06] then we which are alive and remain shall
[6:08] be caught up together with them in the
[6:10] clouds to meet the lord in the air and
[6:12] so shall we ever be with the lord
[6:15] wherefore comfort one another with these
[6:17] words
[6:19] the question as to who will be in the
[6:21] rapture can now be answered
[6:23] these texts teach two groups of
[6:25] christians will have their bodies
[6:26] changed at the moment of the rapture so
[6:28] they can be caught up to meet jesus in
[6:30] the air
[6:31] the dead in christ and the living
[6:33] christians the dead in christ are the
[6:36] holy ghost-filled christians who have
[6:37] died over the past 2000 years
[6:40] this group will be resurrected in
[6:42] immortal bodies first as paul says the
[6:45] dead shall be raised incorruptible and
[6:47] shall rise first
[6:49] john correctly describes the rapture as
[6:51] the first resurrection because the dead
[6:53] in christ are being resurrected
[6:57] the living christians the second group
[6:59] will be changed from mortal bodies to
[7:01] immortal
[7:02] and will be like enoch and elijah who
[7:04] never had to taste death
[7:06] paul says their mortal bodies will be
[7:08] swallowed up in victory
[7:10] this group of christians which are alive
[7:12] and remain unto the coming of the lord
[7:14] receive the oil of the baptism of the
[7:16] holy ghost or eternal life
[7:19] during their lives being called wise
[7:21] virgins by jesus christ in matthew 25
[7:25] verses 1 through 13.
[7:28] the rest of the entire world population
[7:31] who denied christ as unbelievers along
[7:33] with those foolish virgin christians who
[7:36] did not receive the oil or baptism of
[7:38] the holy ghost will have to die during
[7:40] the tribulation period or the battle of
[7:42] armageddon and will miss the one
[7:44] thousand-year millennial reign with
[7:46] christ
[7:47] the foolish virgins missed the
[7:49] millennium because they foolishly chose
[7:51] to live lives void of the holy ghost
[7:53] baptism on earth
[7:55] being unfit to rule and reign with
[7:56] christ revelation 20 verse 5 explains
[8:00] the rest of the dead live not again
[8:02] until the thousand years were finished
[8:05] the bodies of the rest of the world
[8:06] population and foolish virgin christians
[8:09] will remain in the graves according to
[8:11] jesus and will be resurrected for their
[8:13] day of judgment at the great white
[8:15] throne which is called the second
[8:17] resurrection detailed in matthew 25
[8:20] verses 31-46
[8:22] and revelation 20 verses 11-15
[8:26] the souls of the foolish virgin likely
[8:28] go to a heavenly dimension to peacefully
[8:31] wait for the second resurrection just
[8:33] like the faithful yet blinded to christ
[8:36] jews who had a heavenly waiting place
[8:38] under the altar of god in heaven
[8:40] according to the fifth seal of
[8:42] revelation 6 verses 9-11 the souls of
[8:45] unbelievers will undoubtedly go down to
[8:48] the heart of the earth hell's prison
[8:50] house to await judgment
[8:53] it's crucial to understand how the greek
[8:55] word for caught up in first
[8:57] thessalonians 4 17 supports a
[9:00] pre-tribulation rapture
[9:02] in the greek lexicon caught up is
[9:05] harpazo
[9:06] meaning to seize carry off by force to
[9:09] seize on
[9:10] claim for oneself eagerly to snatch out
[9:14] or away
[9:15] the rapture is jesus eagerly seizing or
[9:19] snatching away his bride his wife so
[9:22] that he may take these christians to
[9:23] heaven or the father's kingdom with him
[9:27] for a wedding in the sky followed by a
[9:29] marriage supper
[9:31] simultaneously the inhabitants of the
[9:33] earth are being judged and tormented for
[9:36] their sins in the tribulation for
[9:38] rejecting the gospel
[9:41] six reasons the rapture is
[9:42] pre-tribulation
[9:44] six reasons prove the rapture is before
[9:46] the great tribulation not during nor
[9:49] afterwards
[9:52] reason number one the great tribulation
[9:54] is described as trouble for israel the
[9:56] foolish virgins
[9:58] and sinners but not for the holy
[10:00] ghost-filled christians the spirit
[10:02] sealed christians are already washed in
[10:04] the blood of jesus christ and are not in
[10:06] need of purifying purging or trouble
[10:10] during the great tribulation
[10:12] daniel 12 1 and jeremiah 30 verse 7
[10:16] refer to the season of unparalleled
[10:18] trouble by similar names
[10:20] time of trouble and jacob's trouble
[10:23] both clearly reference israel
[10:27] the foolish virgins or christians
[10:29] without the baptism of the holy ghost
[10:31] will experience some degree of trouble
[10:33] in the tribulation because two of
[10:35] jesus's parables describe it
[10:38] first jesus describes these foolish
[10:40] christians as being locked out obvious
[10:42] trouble of the marriage in matthew 25
[10:46] verses 10 through 12.
[10:48] this corresponds to missing the marriage
[10:49] supper in heaven mentioned revelation 19
[10:52] verse 7 despite living virgin or pure
[10:55] lives
[10:56] because they had no oil or the holy
[10:58] ghost baptism another parable from
[11:01] christ in matthew 22 verses 10 through
[11:03] 13 describes those without the wedding
[11:06] garment which represents the holy ghost
[11:08] baptism
[11:09] cast into outer darkness with weeping
[11:12] and gnashing of teeth notice god's
[11:14] repeating pattern that despite making
[11:16] great human effort to be part of the
[11:18] supper or rapture only those who are
[11:21] born again of the holy ghost will
[11:23] qualify for this holy gathering
[11:27] sinners will face the worst trouble
[11:28] during the great tribulation for god is
[11:30] going to execute judgment upon all
[11:33] and to convince all that are ungodly
[11:36] among them of all their ungodly deeds
[11:38] which they have ungodly committed and of
[11:40] all their hard speeches which ungodly
[11:42] sinners have spoken against jesus christ
[11:45] and his bride
[11:47] reason number two there is no mention of
[11:50] christ bride or church in the
[11:52] tribulation texts in the book of
[11:54] revelation
[11:56] the word church appears 19 times in
[11:58] revelation but is absent from chapter 3
[12:01] verse 22 to chapter 22 verse 16. the
[12:05] reason christ bride or wife
[12:08] is not mentioned during the great
[12:09] tribulation
[12:10] taking place on the earth is because she
[12:12] will be with jesus at the heavenly
[12:14] marriage supper of the lamb christ will
[12:16] rapture his bride at the end of the
[12:18] laodicean church age see chapter 7
[12:21] and the next time she is seen near earth
[12:23] is when she returns to the earth from
[12:25] heaven with jesus christ for the battle
[12:28] of armageddon in revelation 19 verses 5
[12:31] through 21 which takes place at the very
[12:34] end of the great tribulation
[12:37] the true church is not mentioned in
[12:39] revelation chapter 8 during the first
[12:41] four trumpets nor in revelation chapter
[12:43] 9 in the fifth and sixth trumpets and
[12:46] when the first woe passes
[12:48] revelation chapter 10 deals with the
[12:50] completion of the gentile bride's great
[12:53] commission so it's not a tribulation
[12:55] text
[12:56] when the second will passes in
[12:58] revelation 11 the bride is still not
[13:00] mentioned
[13:01] israel is the theme of revelation 12 and
[13:04] doesn't deal with jesus jesus's gentile
[13:05] bride in revelation 13 you see the
[13:08] beast's transition to papal rome her
[13:11] influence in the united states and her
[13:13] war with the jewish saints in the
[13:15] tribulation but there's no mention of
[13:17] jesus's church
[13:19] during the final harvest of the 144
[13:21] thousand israeli believers in revelation
[13:24] 14 there is again no mention of the
[13:26] bride of christ
[13:28] jesus's wife is not mentioned in
[13:30] revelation chapter 15 and 16 when the
[13:33] seven last plagues and seven vials are
[13:35] poured out upon the earth
[13:37] revelation chapters 17 and 18 reveal
[13:40] mystery babylon's union with earth's
[13:42] kings as well as her day of destruction
[13:45] in the tribulation
[13:47] some wrongly point to revelation 14
[13:50] verses 6 through 10 and revelation 16
[13:53] verse 15 to prove jesus's bride goes
[13:56] through the tribulation
[13:57] these scriptures are simply warnings for
[14:00] jesus church to be rapture ready as she
[14:03] reads through the book of revelation
[14:04] during the 2000 year time period of the
[14:07] times of the gentiles before the
[14:09] tribulation
[14:10] revelation 18 verse 4 is another plea
[14:13] for bible readers to come out of babylon
[14:16] before it's too late
[14:18] reason number three the bride or true
[14:21] church is specifically promised a pardon
[14:23] from god's divine wrath
[14:26] the following seven scriptures speak of
[14:28] god's gracious promise beginning with
[14:30] paul's two records of pardon
[14:33] in context directly after the caught up
[14:36] description from first thessalonians
[14:39] but ye brethren are not in darkness that
[14:41] that day should overtake you as a thief
[14:44] first thessalonians 5 verse 4
[14:47] for god hath not appointed us to wrath
[14:50] but to obtain salvation by our lord
[14:52] jesus christ
[14:54] first thessalonians 5 verse 9
[14:57] and to wait for his son from heaven whom
[15:00] he raised from the dead even jesus which
[15:02] delivered us from the wrath to come
[15:05] first thessalonians 1 verse 10
[15:08] much more than being now justified by
[15:11] his blood we shall be saved from wrath
[15:13] through him romans 5 verse 9
[15:17] because thou has kept the word of my
[15:19] patience i will also keep thee from the
[15:21] hour of temptation which shall come upon
[15:24] all the world to try them that dwell
[15:26] upon the earth revelation 3 verse 10
[15:30] watch ye therefore and pray always that
[15:32] ye may be accounted worthy to escape all
[15:35] these things that shall come to pass and
[15:37] to stand before the son of man luke 21
[15:41] 36
[15:42] for in the time of trouble he shall hide
[15:44] me in his pavilion in the secret of his
[15:47] tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set
[15:50] me up upon a rock
[15:52] psalm 27 verse 5.
[15:55] in the seventh scripture take notice
[15:57] that david mentions being hidden from
[15:59] trouble so this prophecy can only
[16:01] pertain to the bride of christ for the
[16:03] three other groups specifically israel
[16:06] in daniel 12 1 endure trouble during the
[16:09] great tribulation
[16:12] the word wrath is used 13 times in
[16:14] revelation and refers to god's wrath
[16:16] upon the religious system of mystery
[16:19] babylon and those who align themselves
[16:21] with her during the tribulation the
[16:24] final mention of wrath in revelation 19
[16:26] 15
[16:27] is jesus treading out god's wrath
[16:29] against satan and the ungodly at
[16:32] armageddon
[16:34] consider christ's affection for his wife
[16:37] the new testament bride and compare it
[16:39] with a natural husband preparing to
[16:41] marry his wife
[16:43] would a loving husband purposely allow
[16:45] his espoused wife to endure his wrath
[16:48] before their wedding
[16:49] no a godly husband would have no wrath
[16:52] towards his future wife
[16:53] because she has already found favor in
[16:55] his sight
[16:56] on the contrary he would do everything
[16:58] in his power to keep his wife from wrath
[17:01] and suffering
[17:02] how much more will jesus christ
[17:04] keep his espoused wife from his wrath
[17:07] listen to scripture's testimony about
[17:09] jesus's wife
[17:10] she's a glorious church not having spot
[17:13] or wrinkle or any such thing
[17:16] bride members are blameless and harmless
[17:18] without rebuke
[17:20] jesus blood has forgiven all her
[17:22] trespasses
[17:23] christ's wife has no condemnation and no
[17:26] man shall lay anything to the charge of
[17:28] god's elect for it is god that
[17:30] justifieth undoubtedly jesus christ will
[17:34] not allow his wife to endure his wrath
[17:36] because she is the wife of his choosing
[17:39] already justified in his eyes
[17:42] revelation 3 verse 10 and chapter 13
[17:45] verses 16 and 17 seem to suggest that
[17:48] the true church will experience a great
[17:50] trial just before the rapture
[17:52] but surely this will be a light
[17:53] affliction compared to the divine wrath
[17:56] reserved for the wicked
[17:58] jesus promised christians would be kept
[17:59] from living through the worldwide mark
[18:02] of the beast temptation
[18:03] called the hour of temptation in
[18:06] revelation 3 verse 10.
[18:08] it seems inevitable that true believers
[18:10] will feel some of the mounting political
[18:13] ecclesiastical and financial pressure
[18:16] moments before revelation 13 verses 16
[18:19] and 17 is fulfilled
[18:21] and he calls us all both small and great
[18:24] rich and poor free and bond to receive a
[18:27] mark in their right hand or in their
[18:29] foreheads and that no man might buy or
[18:31] sell save he that had the mark or the
[18:34] name of the beast or the number of his
[18:36] name
[18:37] but just as one in the form like the son
[18:40] of god speedily stepped into the fiery
[18:42] furnace
[18:43] milliseconds before the three hebrew
[18:45] children were burned so will the true
[18:47] son of god snatch us away his bride the
[18:50] church moments before the tribulation is
[18:54] unleashed reason number four the bride
[18:58] or true church is foreshadowed to
[18:59] receive a pardon from god's divine wrath
[19:03] three historical old testament events
[19:05] and two of jesus's parables foreshadow
[19:07] the bride's pardon from divine wrath
[19:11] enoch whose name means dedicated in
[19:14] hebrew foreshadowed the true church
[19:16] because he was raptured not tasting
[19:18] death
[19:19] and enoch walked with god and he was not
[19:22] for god took him being the seventh
[19:25] generation from adam enoch typed the
[19:27] current seventh gentile church age the
[19:30] laodicean age which will escape the
[19:33] wrath of the tribulation
[19:36] noah the tenth generation from adam was
[19:38] spared from the wrath of god because he
[19:41] found grace in god's sight
[19:43] ii peter 2 verse 5 says noah was a
[19:46] preacher of righteousness and was spared
[19:48] from the worldwide destruction of the
[19:49] flood
[19:50] jesus validated that the end times would
[19:53] resemble noah's day in matthew 24 verses
[19:56] 37-39
[19:58] and luke 17 verses 26 and 27
[20:01] thus noah types the foolish virgin group
[20:04] of christians who miss the enoch-like
[20:06] rapture before judgment and thereby
[20:09] experience the great temptation to take
[20:11] the mark of the beast
[20:13] revelation 13 verses 15-17 seems to
[20:16] point to all foolish virgins being
[20:18] martyred due to their rejection of the
[20:20] mark of the beast
[20:22] their deaths would mean being spared
[20:24] from the wrath of the seven trumpets
[20:26] seven vows and three woes
[20:29] righteous lot nephew of abraham was
[20:32] spared from god's wrath poured out on
[20:34] sodom and gomorrah in genesis 19 verses
[20:37] 1-29
[20:39] abraham's merciful intercession for lot
[20:42] and all righteous people in the wicked
[20:44] cities was remembered by god and proved
[20:47] he would not destroy the righteous with
[20:49] the wicked
[20:50] lot like noah types the foolish virgin
[20:53] group of christians who will not be
[20:55] raptured but will escape the
[20:56] indescribable wrath of the trumpets vows
[20:59] and three woes
[21:01] herein we see god's faithful principle
[21:03] he will not destroy the righteous with
[21:05] the wicked
[21:06] the two kinds of believers holy and
[21:08] righteous always escape god's wrath upon
[21:11] the wicked as jesus's sower and the
[21:13] foreground's parable denotes
[21:17] continuing on lot's story jesus said his
[21:20] second coming would occur when world
[21:22] conditions resembled the days of lot in
[21:24] luke 17 verses 28-30
[21:27] we are living in a modern sodom as the
[21:30] growing global acceptance of
[21:32] homosexuality and the lgbt movement
[21:36] shows the fulfillment of jesus's
[21:37] prophetic words
[21:40] jesus is the king's son parable in
[21:43] matthew 22 verses 1 through 14
[21:45] foreshadows true christians escaping
[21:47] god's wrath
[21:49] christ tells of a king making a marriage
[21:51] for his son
[21:52] typing god the father preparing the true
[21:54] church for their marriage to his son
[21:56] jesus christ at the caught up rapture
[21:59] when the king came in to see the guests
[22:01] gathered for the wedding he found a man
[22:03] that did not have the wedding garment
[22:05] he was bound and cast into outer
[22:07] darkness where there was weeping and
[22:09] gnashing of teeth
[22:10] outer darkness symbolizes the great
[22:12] tribulation since the wedding represents
[22:14] the rapture
[22:16] wedding garments represent the spiritual
[22:18] power or clothing from on high of the
[22:21] holy ghost baptism because endude means
[22:24] clothed with any person who's not born
[22:27] again of god's spirit will not partake
[22:29] of jesus christ's wedding and will have
[22:32] to give his life by denying the mark of
[22:34] the beast in the tribulation
[22:37] jesus tells a second parable about a
[22:39] wedding or the future rapture in matthew
[22:42] 25 verses 1-13
[22:44] two groups of virgins hear the cry to
[22:47] attend the wedding but only one group
[22:49] has the oil or the baptism of the holy
[22:51] ghost as described in zechariah 4 verses
[22:54] 1-6
[22:56] wise virgins have oil meaning they are
[22:58] born again
[22:59] foolish virgins have no oil and are
[23:01] therefore shut out of the marriage
[23:03] rapture
[23:04] those shut out of the rapture will
[23:06] endure the tribulation being forced to
[23:08] give up their lives rather than take the
[23:10] mark of the beast
[23:13] reason number five jesus and paul taught
[23:16] the rapture was imminent at an unknown
[23:18] day as an approaching thief
[23:20] while other views can number or count to
[23:23] the day
[23:24] jesus taught this truth on four
[23:26] occasions and paul twice
[23:29] first jesus says but of that day and
[23:32] hour knoweth no man no not the angels of
[23:34] heaven but my father only
[23:37] later in the same chapter christ says
[23:39] but know this that if the good man of
[23:41] the house had known in what watch the
[23:43] thief would come he would have watched
[23:45] and would not have suffered his house to
[23:47] be broken up therefore be also ready for
[23:51] in such an hour as you think not the son
[23:53] of man cometh
[23:54] the third reference is in the succeeding
[23:57] chapter when our lord says watch
[23:58] therefore for ye know neither the day
[24:01] nor the hour wherein the son of man
[24:03] cometh revelation 3 verse 3 is the
[24:06] fourth witness
[24:07] as jesus says remember therefore how
[24:09] thou hast received and heard and hold
[24:12] fast and repent
[24:13] if therefore thou shalt not watch i will
[24:16] come on thee as a thief and thou shalt
[24:18] not know what hour i will come upon thee
[24:22] in first thessalonians 5 verses 2
[24:24] through 4 paul twice describes christ's
[24:27] coming as a thief saying christians will
[24:30] escape the great tribulations sudden
[24:32] secret destruction time
[24:34] for yourselves know perfectly that the
[24:37] day of the lord so cometh as a thief in
[24:38] the night for when they shall say peace
[24:40] and safety then sudden destruction
[24:43] cometh upon them as travail upon a woman
[24:46] with child
[24:47] and they shall not escape but ye
[24:49] brethren are not in darkness that that
[24:51] day should overtake you as a thief
[24:54] the two other erroneous views and
[24:57] timelines of the rapture mid-tribulation
[24:59] and post-tribulation could potentially
[25:01] calculate the day of christ coming
[25:04] mid-tribulation supporters could count
[25:06] three and a half years or
[25:09] 1260 days
[25:10] after israel's two prophets appear and
[25:13] calculate the day they believe jesus
[25:15] will return
[25:16] likewise post-tribulation supporters
[25:18] could count seven years or
[25:21] 2520 days after the two prophets appear
[25:24] and pinpoint the day of christ's return
[25:27] the pre-tribulation rapture is the only
[25:29] teaching that allows christ to return at
[25:32] an unknown day and hour before the
[25:34] worldwide great tribulation
[25:38] the rapture must remain a secret for two
[25:40] reasons first satan could do great
[25:42] damage if he knew the timing of jesus
[25:44] second coming the rapture
[25:47] satan and a third of his angels did
[25:48] awful damage at jesus's first coming
[25:51] when they anointed herod and his
[25:52] soldiers to slay all the children that
[25:55] were in bethlehem
[25:56] and in all the coasts thereof from 2
[25:58] years old and under
[26:00] what type of killing spree would satan
[26:02] inspire if he knew jesus was going to
[26:04] come and take away his people this year
[26:06] or the next
[26:09] second a secret rapture reveals both
[26:11] good and evil hearts according to jesus
[26:14] christ's parable in matthew 24 verses
[26:17] 45-51
[26:19] a good-hearted faithful and wise servant
[26:21] will be ready for the rapture while
[26:23] serving spiritual meat in due season to
[26:26] his fellow servants the evil servant
[26:28] will behave as though the rapture is
[26:29] delayed smiting his fellow servants in
[26:32] his drunken state
[26:34] peter explains that love motivates true
[26:36] christians to endure trials of faith in
[26:39] anticipation of jesus's appearance
[26:43] reason number six the rapture is removal
[26:45] of the grace of god for gentiles in
[26:48] preparation for the antichrist public
[26:50] revelation and god's return to the
[26:52] jewish people
[26:54] gentiles are now receiving salvation by
[26:57] the grace of god and will retain this
[26:59] privilege until the fullness of the
[27:01] gentiles become in
[27:03] god has blinded israel from recognizing
[27:05] christ as their messiah that we the
[27:08] gentiles might know christ and be saved
[27:11] jesus defines this current time period
[27:13] as the times of the gentiles in luke 21
[27:16] 24.
[27:18] once the last gentile christian has come
[27:20] in
[27:21] been saved and sealed by the holy ghost
[27:23] into the kingdom of god
[27:25] the rest of the unbelieving gentiles
[27:27] will be cut off from the mercy of god
[27:29] and israel be grafted back into
[27:31] fellowship with god their own olive tree
[27:35] in 2 thessalonians 2 verses 2 through 13
[27:39] paul labels the person of the antichrist
[27:41] as the man of sin
[27:42] and son of perdition who has not yet
[27:45] been revealed but will be revealed after
[27:48] a great falling away or apostasy occurs
[27:51] by churches
[27:52] as apostasy increases verses 7 and 8
[27:56] further declares the antichrist will be
[27:58] revealed after god takes his holy spirit
[28:00] out of the way the rapture is god taking
[28:03] holy spirit-filled christians
[28:05] out of the antichrist way to jerusalem
[28:08] where he will sit in the jewish temple
[28:09] of god showing himself that he is god
[28:13] christians need not fear the apostasy
[28:15] movement
[28:16] nor the antichrist
[28:18] paul identifies their characteristics
[28:20] declaring they will exalt themselves
[28:22] above god's word not love the truth of
[28:25] god's word have pleasure in doing
[28:27] unrighteous acts and believe lies
[28:30] if you believe god's word is truth love
[28:33] the truth and do righteousness god's
[28:35] grace will remove you from the earth in
[28:37] the rapture before the antichrist is
[28:40] revealed god's perfect love casts out
[28:43] all fear about the antichrist's
[28:45] appearance
[28:47] the conditions or times and seasons of
[28:50] the rapture
[28:52] having proved the rapture's
[28:53] pre-tribulation god's grace has also
[28:56] revealed even more about the world's
[28:58] conditions at the time of the rapture
[29:01] jesus clearly taught the rapture takes
[29:04] place at an unknown day and hour
[29:06] but many people fail to recognize paul's
[29:08] bold claim that christians will know the
[29:11] times and seasons of jesus's coming
[29:14] immediately after teaching on the caught
[29:16] up event
[29:17] in 1st thessalonians chapter 4
[29:19] paul follows up in the proceeding
[29:21] chapter by assuring christians they'll
[29:23] be ready for jesus's return but of the
[29:26] times and the seasons brethren ye have
[29:28] no need that i write unto you
[29:31] for yourselves know perfectly that the
[29:32] day of the lord so cometh as a thief in
[29:35] the night
[29:36] for when they shall say peace and safety
[29:38] then sudden destruction cometh upon them
[29:41] as travail upon a woman with child and
[29:44] they shall not escape
[29:45] but ye brethren are not in darkness that
[29:47] that day should overtake you as a thief
[29:50] ye are all the children of light and the
[29:52] children of the day we are not of the
[29:54] night nor of darkness
[29:56] therefore let us not sleep as others do
[29:59] but let us watch and be sober
[30:01] for they that sleep sleep in the night
[30:03] and they that be drunk and are drunken
[30:05] in the night but let us who are of the
[30:07] day be sober putting on the breastplate
[30:10] of faith and love and foreign helmet the
[30:12] hope of salvation
[30:14] for god hath not appointed us to wrath
[30:17] but to obtain salvation by our lord
[30:19] jesus christ who died for us that
[30:22] whether we wake or sleep we should live
[30:24] together with him
[30:26] the apostle describes the times and
[30:28] seasons of the rapture with two
[30:30] descriptors
[30:31] first sinners will be unaware of the
[30:33] rapture just as drunken sleeping robbery
[30:36] victims are caught off guard by a
[30:38] nighttime thief
[30:40] jesus teaches the same idea when he
[30:41] likens the day of the lord as the days
[30:44] of noah
[30:45] in which the lost kept eating drinking
[30:48] and marrying right up until the flood
[30:51] came and took them all away
[30:53] paul compares the sinners to sleeping
[30:55] drunks
[30:56] second
[30:57] paul proclaims the world's mantra will
[30:59] be peace and safety at the time of
[31:01] christ's sudden rapture event it's
[31:04] striking to imagine how contrary the
[31:06] thoughts and plans of sinners will be
[31:08] compared to those of god
[31:10] as god is planning worldwide war
[31:13] armageddon
[31:14] and destruction with earth's sinless
[31:17] holy restoration in mind
[31:19] the world is planning albeit in vain
[31:22] world peace and safety are christians
[31:24] living in a world that matches these
[31:26] descriptions
[31:27] partially no doubt and each day we're
[31:29] closer to seeing the full rapture
[31:31] conditions
[31:33] building upon these two descriptions the
[31:36] bible provides further proofs that we
[31:38] are near the time and season of jesus's
[31:40] return
[31:41] scoffers will be mocking jesus's second
[31:43] coming
[31:44] second peter 3 verses 3 and 4.
[31:47] the conditions of noah's time will be
[31:49] repeated violence lust-based marriages
[31:53] continually evil thoughts luke 17 verses
[31:56] 26 through 30 genesis 6 1-13
[32:00] the sodomite conditions of lot's time
[32:02] will be repeated luke 17 verses 28-30
[32:07] evil men and deceivers will grow more
[32:09] evil with greater deceptions second
[32:11] timothy 3 13.
[32:14] many churches will commit a great
[32:15] falling away from god's truth second
[32:18] thessalonians 2 verse 3.
[32:20] few will have genuine faith expressed
[32:22] through regular prayer luke 18 verses 1
[32:25] through 8.
[32:27] pestilences
[32:28] swine flu coronavirus etc and
[32:31] earthquakes will increase as sorrows
[32:34] before the tribulation matthew 24 verses
[32:36] 7 and 8
[32:38] men will love themselves more than god
[32:40] and be covetous boasters proud
[32:43] blasphemers disobedient to parents
[32:46] unthankful unholy without natural
[32:48] affection truce breakers false accusers
[32:51] incontinent fierce despisers of those
[32:54] that are good traitors heady high-minded
[32:57] and having a form of godliness but
[33:00] denying the power thereof second timothy
[33:02] 3 verses 1-7
[33:05] the new testament gospel will have been
[33:08] preached to all the world matthew 24 14.
[33:12] through unified efforts of false
[33:14] churches and politicians new laws will
[33:16] stop true churches from preaching and
[33:19] pressure them to join the evil
[33:21] ecumenical move but jesus anoints with
[33:23] the latter rain and rescues them in the
[33:26] rapture
[33:27] psalm 27 verse 5 revelation 3 verse 10
[33:31] revelation 13 verse 16
[33:34] israelis will be physically returning to
[33:36] live in the holy land and seeking to
[33:38] rebuild a new temple
[33:40] deuteronomy 30 verses 1 through 10 luke
[33:43] 21 24 revelation 11 verses 1 and 2.
[33:49] nominal churches will be in a laodicean
[33:51] lukewarm condition
[33:53] concerned with riches and goods having
[33:55] no need of more truth and unwilling to
[33:58] repent revelation 3 verses 15-19
[34:03] fully armored in the rapture season
[34:06] paul says a christian's only hope for
[34:08] being spiritually awake and soberly
[34:11] watching for christ's return is by
[34:13] putting on the full armor of god
[34:15] in 1st thessalonians chapter 5 paul
[34:17] describes two of the six pieces of armor
[34:20] fully detailed in ephesians 6 verses 10
[34:23] through 18.
[34:24] it behooves christians to understand and
[34:27] put on each piece of armor that we may
[34:29] be able to withstand in the evil day and
[34:32] having done all to stand
[34:34] here's a brief summary of your spiritual
[34:36] armor
[34:37] breastplate of faith love and
[34:39] righteousness
[34:40] first thessalonians 5 verse 8 ephesians
[34:43] 6 14
[34:45] a physical breastplate protects the
[34:47] heart and other vital organs from the
[34:50] chest down to the waist
[34:52] just as a righteous obedient christian
[34:54] life of integrity protects our heart
[34:57] from satan's attacks on our character
[34:59] christians trust in christ's
[35:01] righteousness imputed to us and not our
[35:04] own
[35:05] helmet of salvation
[35:07] first thessalonians 5 verse 8 ephesians
[35:10] 6 verse 17
[35:12] a physical helmet protects the head the
[35:14] command center and most complex organ in
[35:16] the human body just as the hope of
[35:19] salvation the assurance that we are
[35:21] saved and forgiven by jesus's sacrifice
[35:24] protects us from satan's attempts to
[35:26] make us doubt our salvation
[35:28] jesus's helmet makes us victorious in
[35:31] the battlefield of the mind the greatest
[35:33] battle ever fought as we cast down every
[35:36] imagination that exalts itself against
[35:38] the word of god
[35:40] loins gird about with truth ephesians 6
[35:43] 14.
[35:45] girded loins meant a man could tuck his
[35:47] long flowing robe into his belt enabling
[35:50] him to travel run or work
[35:53] in the same way a christian's mind is
[35:55] gird up in bible truth
[35:57] calmly prepared to be victorious in
[35:59] spiritual mind battles and successful in
[36:01] his ministry's work
[36:04] feet shod with the preparation of the
[36:05] gospel of peace ephesians 6 15
[36:09] soldiers feet and lower legs were
[36:11] protected by sandals and greaves to
[36:14] ensure their protection in traveling or
[36:16] war
[36:17] in the same way the christian's daily
[36:18] travels and decisions are made only
[36:21] after prayerful preparation produces
[36:23] god's peace in his heart
[36:26] shield of faith ephesians 6 verse 16
[36:30] just as a soldier's shield protected all
[36:33] the aforementioned pieces of armor from
[36:35] fiery arrows faith in christ completely
[36:38] protects a christian's armor by
[36:40] extinguishing or stifling every
[36:42] falsehood satan shoots from the bow of
[36:45] his lying tongue
[36:47] sword of the spirit ephesians 6 verse 17
[36:51] just as a soldier's sword was his main
[36:54] offensive and lethal weapon the word of
[36:56] god spoken through a christian's mouth
[36:59] will resist wound even bruise the devil
[37:02] eventually putting to flight his evil
[37:04] forces
[37:05] jesus used the spoken word three times
[37:08] during satan's temptation in the
[37:09] wilderness causing the devil to flee him
[37:12] for a season
[37:13] at christ's physical return to the earth
[37:16] after the great tribulation a sword of
[37:18] judgment comes from his mouth smiting
[37:20] all his enemies
[37:23] it is no wonder paul admonishes us to be
[37:25] alert soldiers of the daytime if we want
[37:27] to go to heaven in the rapture
[37:29] if you want to be ready for the rapture
[37:31] you must be willing to fight for this
[37:33] privilege
[37:34] god's most successful soldier jesus
[37:36] christ says the kingdom of god is
[37:38] experienced when soldiers take it by
[37:41] force
[37:42] amazingly the greek word for force is
[37:44] the same word paul uses for caught up
[37:47] meaning christians must actively snatch
[37:49] away their spiritual victories from
[37:51] satan as jesus is going to snatch away
[37:54] his bride from satan's great tribulation
[37:58] satan the god of this world system has
[38:01] laid many traps and snares around us the
[38:03] devil's angels have been and will
[38:05] continually be sent to war against our
[38:07] cause but we are fully equipped and more
[38:10] than conquerors fighting the good fight
[38:12] of faith with our divine armor
[38:16] where will the rapture take place
[38:18] the rapture will be a universal event
[38:21] meaning it will take place on a global
[38:23] scale and believers will not have to be
[38:25] in one physical location in order to be
[38:27] part of the rapture
[38:29] in matthew 24 verses 23 23-28
[38:32] jesus plainly teaches us not to be
[38:34] deceived by men who claim to be christ
[38:36] and call us out to the desert or secret
[38:39] chambers
[38:40] christ's coming will be as fast as
[38:42] lightning in a moment in the twinkling
[38:44] of an eye so there is no need to gather
[38:46] physically for the exact moment of the
[38:48] rapture
[38:50] at the precise moment of the rapture
[38:53] wise virgin christians might be working
[38:55] or sleeping in their beds on the other
[38:57] side of the world according to christ's
[38:59] teachings in luke 17 verses 34 through
[39:03] 36 and matthew 24 verses 40 through 42
[39:07] jesus says i tell you in that night
[39:10] there shall be two men in one bed the
[39:12] one shall be taken and the other shall
[39:14] be left two women shall be grinding
[39:17] together the one shall be taken and the
[39:19] other left two men shall be in the field
[39:22] the one shall be taken and the other
[39:23] left
[39:25] you are admonished to be ready watching
[39:27] for christ's return whether you are
[39:29] sleeping or working
[39:31] let us pray sincerely before bed and
[39:33] before the work day begins each morning
[39:35] for our savior is coming back as quick
[39:37] as lightning
[39:40] it will not matter where a true believer
[39:42] is physically located at the moment of
[39:44] the rapture as long as he possesses the
[39:46] oil or the wedding garment of the
[39:48] baptism of the holy ghost
[39:50] wise virgins will be ready for the
[39:52] rapture and jesus will call them to the
[39:54] air to meet the rest of the saints in
[39:56] the sky
[39:59] don't miss this there is one spiritual
[40:01] location not physical
[40:03] a christian must be concerned about for
[40:05] the rapture for a true christian must be
[40:07] located in christ according to romans 8
[40:10] verse 1 there is therefore now no
[40:13] condemnation to them which are in christ
[40:15] jesus who walk not after the flesh but
[40:18] after the spirit
[40:19] believers are spiritually in christ when
[40:22] christ is in them by the baptism of the
[40:24] holy ghost according to colossians 1
[40:27] verse 27
[40:28] to whom god would make known what is the
[40:31] riches of the glory of this mystery
[40:32] among the gentiles which is christ in
[40:35] you the hope of glory
[40:37] galatians 3 27 says christians have been
[40:40] baptized into christ
[40:42] meeting christ's direct command to be
[40:44] baptized with the holy ghost
[40:46] paul announces that if the holy spirit
[40:49] that raised up jesus from the dead dwell
[40:51] in you he that raised up christ from the
[40:53] dead shall also quicken your mortal
[40:55] bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in
[40:57] you
[40:59] jesus foretold his disciples about his
[41:01] desire to dwell in them by his spirit in
[41:04] john 14 17 saying
[41:07] even the spirit of truth whom the world
[41:09] cannot receive because it seeth him not
[41:12] neither knoweth him but ye know him for
[41:15] he dwelt with you and shall be in you
[41:17] a few verses later in john 14 20 messiah
[41:21] revealed a most glorious truth about
[41:23] those he would dwell in
[41:25] he revealed that those believers were
[41:26] already in him in his mind and plan
[41:30] before the foundation of the world
[41:32] at that day ye shall know that i am in
[41:34] my father and ye and me and i in you
[41:37] paul elaborates on this fact teaching
[41:40] according as he hath chosen us in him
[41:42] before the foundation of the world that
[41:45] we should be holy and without blame
[41:46] before him in love
[41:48] praise god for the revelation of where
[41:51] christians need to be for the rapture
[41:53] we must be in christ meaning that
[41:55] christ's spirit is dwelling in our souls
[41:58] by the baptism of the holy ghost
[42:01] jesus does though give us a clue about
[42:03] where christians will be frequently
[42:05] gathering physically as the rapture
[42:07] draws closer
[42:09] matthew 24 28 says holy ghost-filled
[42:11] christians will be gathered together
[42:13] like eagles feasting on a carcass
[42:16] representing constant increasing church
[42:18] attendance in which believers feast on
[42:21] the preaching of god's word
[42:23] paul validates that five preaching gifts
[42:25] will perfect edify and bring total unity
[42:28] to the body of christ god likens himself
[42:31] to an eagle and so we as his children
[42:33] must be eaglets
[42:35] just as eagles are carnivores christians
[42:38] feast on the meat or deeply spiritual
[42:40] insights that help us to discern good
[42:42] and evil in our daily lives
[42:44] believers cannot remain on a milk diet
[42:47] and expect to go in the rapture just as
[42:49] eagles cannot expect to soar in the
[42:51] heavens without a steady meat diet
[42:55] why will the rapture occur the caught up
[42:58] rapture occurs because christ is
[43:01] snatching away his wife from the earth
[43:03] rescuing her from the awful wrath of god
[43:06] meant to purge the earth before the
[43:08] millennium
[43:09] our lord says because thou has kept the
[43:12] word of my patience i will also keep
[43:14] thee from the hour of temptation which
[43:16] shall come upon all the world to try
[43:18] them that dwell upon the earth
[43:20] what amazing grace christ offers us
[43:23] being now justified by his blood we
[43:25] shall be saved from wrath through him
[43:29] according to john 14 verses 1 through 3
[43:32] christ desires to be married with his
[43:34] eternal companion the holy separated
[43:37] many-membered bride church christ wants
[43:40] to receive his people his bride unto
[43:42] himself and take her to the place he has
[43:44] prepared for her to live eternally as
[43:47] pilgrims and strangers on this earth the
[43:50] holy ghost-filled bride shares the same
[43:51] desires as her husband and wants to
[43:54] leave this world to be with christ just
[43:56] as paul desired to depart and to be with
[43:59] christ
[44:01] the rapture is the moment we shall ever
[44:03] be with the lord because we were ready
[44:05] to go in with him to the marriage
[44:08] truly the lamb's wife is blessed to be
[44:11] able to make herself ready for her
[44:12] marriage to christ
[44:15] god's rich marvelous and long-suffering
[44:18] grace gives every man and woman
[44:20] opportunity to repent before the rapture
[44:23] the perfectly just and fair savior
[44:25] offers space to repent to every
[44:27] generation even as christ announced to
[44:30] the gentile city of thyrotira in
[44:32] revelation 2 verse 21
[44:34] and i gave her space to repent of her
[44:36] fornication and she repented not
[44:39] nearly 4 000 years ago god's grace was
[44:41] equally offered to the amorites
[44:43] possessors of canaan in abraham's
[44:45] lifetime
[44:46] the lord told abraham he would give the
[44:48] amorites a space of 400 years to repent
[44:51] until their iniquity would be full
[44:53] of course the omniscient god knew the
[44:55] amorites would not repent and thus
[44:57] ordained for joshua to lead israel into
[45:00] canaan as a possession for abraham's
[45:02] seed
[45:04] today god's grace is extending to
[45:06] mystery babylon the roman catholic
[45:08] church and her daughters the
[45:10] denominational and non-denominational
[45:12] churches who practice iniquity harboring
[45:15] every unclean and hateful spirit but
[45:17] there will come a day when their
[45:18] iniquity will be full and like the
[45:21] amorites they will be destroyed for
[45:22] their unbelief and hard unrepentant
[45:25] hearts
[45:26] god's word says come out of her my
[45:28] people that ye be not partakers of her
[45:30] sins and that you receive not of her
[45:32] plagues
[45:33] for her sins have reached into heaven
[45:35] and god hath remembered her iniquities
[45:37] reward her even as she rewarded you and
[45:40] double under her double according to her
[45:42] works
[45:43] in the cup which she have filled fill to
[45:45] her double
[45:46] if you are christ's bride you will come
[45:48] out of sin loving churches and into
[45:50] christ by the baptism of the holy ghost
[45:55] how will the rapture occur
[45:57] the rapture will occur by the power and
[45:59] authority of jesus christ's spirit
[46:01] through a shout voice and trump
[46:04] for the lord himself shall descend from
[46:06] heaven with a shout with the voice of
[46:08] the archangel and with the trump of god
[46:10] and the dead in christ shall rise first
[46:14] first the word shout in the greek
[46:16] means the order command stimulating cry
[46:20] from jesus christ to get his people
[46:22] ready for the wedding or rapture
[46:24] this shouter cry must be the same
[46:26] midnight cry described in matthew 25
[46:29] verse 6
[46:30] because both texts deal with jesus's
[46:32] wedding to his bride which is the
[46:34] rapture
[46:35] the cry that awoke the ten virgins both
[46:37] wise and foolish
[46:39] caused them to trim their lamps
[46:41] sanctification but only the wise filled
[46:43] their lamps with oil baptism of the holy
[46:46] ghost
[46:47] in order to go meet the bridegroom
[46:50] history witnesses that god's ministry
[46:52] through the late william branham was the
[46:54] shout or cry that awakened the christian
[46:56] church worldwide
[46:58] the supernatural preaching and healing
[47:00] ministry of branham was introduced in
[47:02] chapter 7 and is fully developed in
[47:04] chapter 13 but for now you can rejoice
[47:07] that the first of the three steps in the
[47:09] rapture plan is in progress
[47:11] god's bible message preached through
[47:13] branham is still being preached by
[47:15] ministers being taken around the world
[47:18] awakening both wise and foolish
[47:20] christians
[47:21] as you've read this book you've been
[47:22] made aware of this worldwide shout and
[47:25] now it's your responsibility to obey it
[47:29] second the voice of the archangel is a
[47:31] future event that will be the voice of
[47:33] the resurrection for the dead in christ
[47:35] group mentioned in first thessalonians 4
[47:38] 16
[47:39] the voice of the archangel is the same
[47:41] voice that resurrected lazarus in john
[47:43] 11 43 and will one day resurrect all the
[47:47] dead in christ who faithfully serve the
[47:50] lord jesus christ during the past two
[47:52] thousand years
[47:53] the literal bodies of the dead in christ
[47:55] will rise first being united with
[47:57] glorified bodies and then sometime
[47:59] afterwards at the last trump we which
[48:02] are alive and remain on the earth will
[48:04] receive our body change
[48:07] it's possible that wise virgin
[48:08] christians who are alive and remain may
[48:11] see the glorified bodies of the
[48:13] resurrected dead in christ saints for a
[48:15] short period of time before the rapture
[48:18] immediately following jesus resurrection
[48:20] the bible says and the graves were
[48:22] opened and many bodies of the saints
[48:24] which slept arose and came out of the
[48:27] graves after his resurrection and went
[48:30] into the holy city and appeared unto
[48:32] many
[48:33] if the future rapture resurrection is
[48:35] patterned the same as jesus's
[48:37] resurrection from the grave in matthew
[48:39] chapter 27 then we may see paul peter
[48:43] james and john in their glorified bodies
[48:46] for a short time before our bodies are
[48:48] changed
[48:49] what a faith building experience it
[48:51] would be to see with our own eyes the
[48:53] saints we read about in the holy bible
[48:55] all of our lives
[48:57] oh how exciting it is to be a holy
[48:59] ghost-filled christian and imagine the
[49:01] wonderful things god has in store for
[49:03] his son's bride
[49:06] third the trump of god or last trump
[49:09] will sound to finish the three-step
[49:10] rapture plan which will change the
[49:13] bodies of the living saints and call for
[49:15] the gathering of the dead and living in
[49:17] christ to the sky to meet jesus in the
[49:20] air at the wedding ceremony paul writes
[49:23] then we which are alive and remain shall
[49:25] be caught up together with them in the
[49:27] clouds to meet the lord in the air and
[49:30] so shall we ever be with the lord
[49:32] the apostle continues
[49:34] behold i show you a mystery we shall not
[49:36] all sleep but we shall all be changed in
[49:39] a moment in the twinkling of an eye at
[49:42] the last trump for the trumpet shall
[49:44] sound and the dead shall be raised
[49:45] incorruptible and we shall be changed
[49:48] for this corruptable must put on
[49:49] incorruption and this mortal must put on
[49:52] immortality
[49:55] just as the bride's processional music
[49:57] signals for the bride to come forward to
[49:59] meet her waiting bridegroom during an
[50:01] earthly wedding so the last trump
[50:04] signals for the union in the sky of
[50:06] jesus christ and his bride
[50:09] the last trump is also known as the
[50:11] seventh seal recall chapter seven's
[50:14] teaching that the book of revelation
[50:16] seven seals are seven revelations the
[50:19] new testament church needs to understand
[50:21] the bible
[50:22] the last and seventh seal was the
[50:24] unknown day and hour of the rapture
[50:26] known only to the father according to
[50:29] mark 13 32 making the last trump and the
[50:33] seventh seal identical
[50:36] the shout voice and trump are all
[50:38] performed by the holy ghost which is the
[50:40] same spirit that quickened jesus's own
[50:42] body at his resurrection from the dead
[50:44] but if the spirit of him that raised up
[50:46] jesus from the dead dwell in you he that
[50:48] raised up christ from the dead shall
[50:50] also quicken your mortal bodies by his
[50:53] spirit that dwelleth in you
[50:56] the last sign before the rapture
[50:59] genesis 18 verses 9 through 15
[51:02] powerfully foreshadows god's last sign
[51:04] before the rapture
[51:05] before referencing the last sign observe
[51:08] the context of this story
[51:10] in genesis 18 verses 1 through 8 god and
[51:13] two angels visit abraham and sarah
[51:15] appearing in flesh bodies and eating
[51:17] butter milk and veal
[51:19] verses 9-15 detail god confirming to
[51:22] abraham that he will have a son through
[51:24] sarah
[51:25] standing behind them sarah overhears
[51:27] this and laughs within herself
[51:30] instantly god discerns her doubt and
[51:32] questions abraham about sarah's laughter
[51:35] asking is anything too hard for the lord
[51:38] sarah hears god and proceeds to lie to
[51:40] him
[51:41] saying she did not laugh but god says
[51:43] nay but thou didst laugh
[51:45] genesis 19 describes lot's escape as
[51:48] sodom and gomorrah is destroyed
[51:50] genesis 20 shows abraham's second lapse
[51:54] in lying about sarah being his wife to
[51:56] abimelech and also god's graceful
[51:58] restoration of sarah to abraham
[52:01] god keeps his word and visits sarah in
[52:03] genesis 21 allowing isaac to be born to
[52:06] the 100 year old abraham and 90 year old
[52:09] sarah
[52:11] foreshadowing is seen in the arrival of
[52:13] the promised son isaac who represents
[52:16] jesus the promised son arriving for the
[52:19] rapture before isaac arrived though
[52:22] abraham and sarah's bodies needed
[52:23] changed because his ability to reproduce
[52:26] was dead and the deadness of sarah's
[52:28] womb wouldn't permit a pregnancy
[52:31] their body change from infertility to
[52:34] fertility foreshadows the body change at
[52:36] the rapture for we shall all be changed
[52:39] in a moment in the twinkling of an eye
[52:41] at the last trump for the trumpet shall
[52:43] sound and the dead shall be raised
[52:45] incorruptable and we should be changed
[52:49] what was god's last sign to abraham and
[52:51] sarah before each experienced a body
[52:54] change
[52:55] genesis 18 verses 9 through 15 reveals
[52:58] god's last sign to abraham and sarah
[53:00] before the promised son arrived was a
[53:02] man god
[53:04] discerning sarah's doubtful heart
[53:06] through a supernatural gift of
[53:07] discernment
[53:09] since god is the word john 1 verse 1 he
[53:12] was a discerner of the thoughts and
[53:14] intents of sarah's heart despite the
[53:16] fact that she was standing behind him
[53:18] and made no noise with her voice
[53:22] notice this biblical pattern god in a
[53:24] flesh body discerning the thoughts and
[53:26] intents of the heart this same pattern
[53:29] repeated in the son of man ministry of
[53:31] jesus christ during his earthly ministry
[53:34] a son of man is simply a prophet as
[53:36] ezekiel was given this title over 90
[53:38] times and the lord jesus the only god
[53:41] prophet
[53:42] bore this title over 80 times
[53:45] as son of man jesus twice used his
[53:47] discernment to reveal the thoughts and
[53:49] intents of believers hearts
[53:51] in john 1 christ discerned nathanael's
[53:54] thoughts telling him that he saw him
[53:56] under a fig tree when philip called him
[53:59] aware that only christ could have known
[54:00] his previous whereabouts and
[54:02] conversation with philip nathanael
[54:04] instantly identified jesus as the son of
[54:07] god the king of israel
[54:09] jesus's supernatural discernment proved
[54:11] he was god's prophet
[54:14] later in john 4 christ discerned the
[54:16] thoughts and intents of the samaritan
[54:18] woman at jacob's well
[54:20] she told jesus she had no husband to
[54:23] which christ agreed
[54:24] but then told her she had had five
[54:26] husbands and the current man she was
[54:28] living with was not her husband
[54:30] convinced of the supernatural gift of
[54:32] discernment she uttered sir i perceive
[54:35] that thou art a prophet
[54:37] notice jesus used his gift of
[54:39] discernment among the jewish people in
[54:41] john 1 and then among the samaritans in
[54:43] john 4.
[54:44] the gospels often differentiate three
[54:47] races jews samaritans half jew and half
[54:50] gentile and gentiles
[54:53] jesus then used his discernment gift
[54:56] with two races
[54:57] jew and samaritan but never with the
[54:59] gentiles wouldn't the ethical and just
[55:02] god be obligated to manifest jesus
[55:04] discernment gift to the gentiles
[55:08] in luke 17 30 the lord promised that the
[55:11] son of man would be revealed in the day
[55:13] when societal conditions mirrored the
[55:16] days of noah and lot
[55:18] this was one of the 14 conditions for
[55:20] the rapture previously listed in this
[55:22] chapter this son of man ministry must be
[55:24] intended for the gentiles because god is
[55:26] currently dealing with the gentiles
[55:28] having blinded the jews to their messiah
[55:31] thankfully tape recorders from the 1940s
[55:34] through 1960s have preserved evidence
[55:37] that the gentiles have already received
[55:39] this final gentile son of man
[55:42] discernment ministry
[55:43] yes you read that correctly the gentiles
[55:46] have already received the son of man
[55:47] ministry as it came and went in god's
[55:50] ordained time and season
[55:53] the prophetic supernatural ministry of
[55:55] the late william branham
[55:57] 1909-1965 fulfilled jesus promise from
[56:01] luke 17 30 to send a son of man ministry
[56:04] to the gentiles
[56:06] branham's ministry is fully explained in
[56:07] chapter 13 but know that the holy spirit
[56:10] vindicated his ministry with the same
[56:12] gift of discernment jesus used in john
[56:14] chapters 1 and 4.
[56:16] in a 1954 prayer line branham told a
[56:19] female patient 15 secrets by god's
[56:21] discernment power including her name
[56:24] address and many details about her
[56:26] sicknesses
[56:27] discernments like these were commonplace
[56:29] in branham's ministry as tape recordings
[56:31] of his sermons contain hundreds of these
[56:33] same amazing occurrences
[56:36] branham's discernment ministry was not
[56:37] done in a corner just as paul testified
[56:40] before most noble festus of his
[56:42] obedience to the heavenly vision
[56:44] hundreds even thousands were
[56:46] beneficiaries of branham's obedience to
[56:49] his heavenly commission
[56:52] furthermore on six occasions the spirit
[56:54] of god prompted branham to publicly
[56:56] declare that his discernment gift was
[56:58] the last sign the gentile church would
[57:00] receive before the rapture
[57:03] all six declarations can be read or
[57:05] listened to online
[57:06] not only was the last sign declared but
[57:09] it was stamped with thus saith the lord
[57:11] the authoritative phrase signaling god's
[57:13] literal self-revelation
[57:16] on april 11 1961 in bloomington illinois
[57:20] branham said remember let me tell you
[57:22] thus saith the spirit of god that's all
[57:23] me this is the last sign to the gentile
[57:26] church before the rapture
[57:28] three days later in bloomington branham
[57:30] added remember thus saith the holy
[57:32] spirit this is your last sign write it
[57:35] in your bible and if something rises
[57:37] besides this and greater than this call
[57:39] me a false prophet
[57:41] on may 19 1961 in dawson creek british
[57:45] columbia branham announced just remember
[57:48] thus saith the lord you will never in
[57:50] any no more gentile church age ever see
[57:53] any sign to succeed this go greater this
[57:56] is the last sign of the church
[57:58] on july 7 1962 in grass valley
[58:01] california branham declared you'll never
[58:04] receive another sign this is it thus
[58:06] saith the lord would a prophet of god
[58:08] make a statement like that if it wasn't
[58:10] true
[58:11] you're receiving your greatest sign and
[58:13] your last sign before the appearing of
[58:15] christ
[58:17] on april 11 1964 in birmingham alabama
[58:21] branham charged the believers this is
[58:23] the last sign remember thus saith the
[58:25] lord did you ever hear me say that but
[58:27] what it was true you are seeing your
[58:29] last sign that's scriptural you've seen
[58:31] your last sign pentecost
[58:34] on april 26 1965 in los angeles
[58:37] california branham prophesied
[58:39] and remember abraham and his group never
[58:42] received one more sign from god until
[58:44] the promised son arrived how many know
[58:46] that's true
[58:47] that sign of discernment and the royal
[58:49] seat of abraham let me hear you
[58:52] let me tell you thus saith the lord
[58:54] you're receiving your last sign that's
[58:56] according to the scriptures and the
[58:57] revelation of god that's in my heart
[59:00] that speaks that this is the truth
[59:03] a few years back i had the pleasure of
[59:04] meeting two people
[59:06] unfortunately both are now deceased who
[59:08] experienced branham's discernment gift
[59:10] in very personal ways my first meeting
[59:12] was with tom brown a lima ohio resident
[59:16] who attended branham's home church in
[59:17] jeffersonville indiana for nearly five
[59:20] years 1960 through 1965.
[59:23] brown described multiple instances in
[59:26] which branham would discern his
[59:27] questions and provide answers before tom
[59:30] even asked the questions
[59:32] a second witness i met of branham's son
[59:34] of man ministry was florence humes
[59:37] healed of tuberculosis after branham
[59:39] prayed for her on august 6 1965.
[59:43] this supernatural interaction is
[59:45] recorded on tape and available to read
[59:47] or listen to online
[59:49] god's spirit led branham to foretell
[59:50] florence's healing saying that she would
[59:53] gain weight on two consecutive mondays
[59:55] as a sign of her healing
[59:57] florence's healing took place exactly as
[59:59] foretold by god's prophet
[1:00:01] florence who already had three daughters
[1:00:03] before the tuberculosis lived to birth
[1:00:06] another daughter and four sons leading
[1:00:08] to 25 grandchildren and over 40
[1:00:11] great-grandchildren
[1:00:13] branham's discernment gift appeared at
[1:00:15] the correct time chronologically just as
[1:00:18] god in flesh appeared to abraham and
[1:00:20] sarah at the right time
[1:00:22] god and flesh appeared before both the
[1:00:24] destruction of sodom and gomorrah and
[1:00:26] isaac's birth
[1:00:27] the son of man ministry of branham
[1:00:29] appeared before the rapture and great
[1:00:31] tribulation
[1:00:33] even though you like me probably missed
[1:00:36] experiencing the gentile son of man
[1:00:38] ministry firsthand it is no cause for
[1:00:41] discouragement most prophetic gifts are
[1:00:43] rejected by the ones god intends should
[1:00:45] receive them for instance jesus taught
[1:00:48] that both his ministry and that of john
[1:00:50] the baptist were sent to the jews but
[1:00:52] rejected by the majority
[1:00:54] be encouraged that you now have the
[1:00:56] chance to receive god's last sign to the
[1:00:58] gentiles just before the rapture
[1:01:00] you can listen to branham sermons and
[1:01:02] discernments online and then see god do
[1:01:04] similar things through the living bride
[1:01:06] church today blessed are your eyes if
[1:01:09] they can see god's last sign to
[1:01:10] abraham's seed and receive the bible
[1:01:13] instructions preached by god's prophet
[1:01:17] rewards for receiving the revelation of
[1:01:19] the rapture
[1:01:21] the eternal rewards for receiving the
[1:01:22] revelation of the rapture are perfectly
[1:01:24] beautiful you'll need an active
[1:01:26] imagination in your attempt to fathom
[1:01:29] the immensity of christ's rewards for
[1:01:31] his bride
[1:01:33] previously in this chapter you read a
[1:01:35] few rewards worth recalling such as
[1:01:37] escaping the wrath of god during the
[1:01:39] great tribulation period and knowing
[1:01:41] when the times and seasons the rapture
[1:01:44] occurs
[1:01:45] accepting god's truth right now ensures
[1:01:47] you'll be prayerfully prepared for jesus
[1:01:50] return and miss the global destruction
[1:01:52] and torment of the seven trumpets seven
[1:01:55] vows and three woes
[1:01:58] there are at least four more rewards for
[1:02:00] receiving this revelation
[1:02:01] first you'll have much assurance in
[1:02:03] knowing you are part of christ's bride
[1:02:05] or true church
[1:02:07] scripture refers to this assurance as a
[1:02:09] seal which in the greek means security
[1:02:12] from satan and a mark upon by the
[1:02:15] impress of a seal or a stamp
[1:02:17] the seal is the baptism of the holy
[1:02:19] ghost so it's even more apparent that
[1:02:21] our gospel comes not in word only but
[1:02:24] also in power and in the holy ghost and
[1:02:26] in much assurance
[1:02:29] another way scripture describes this
[1:02:31] seal of assurance is a token
[1:02:33] old testament examples of tokens include
[1:02:36] the rainbow circumcision the passover
[1:02:38] lamb's blood upon the doorposts aaron's
[1:02:41] rod and the scarlet cord given to rahab
[1:02:44] in particular it behooves you and me to
[1:02:47] meditate on two tokens the blood of the
[1:02:50] passover lamb and rahab scarlet cord
[1:02:53] the public display of the passover
[1:02:55] lamb's blood was required for israel's
[1:02:57] exodus out of egypt in fact without the
[1:03:00] blood publicly displayed the death angel
[1:03:03] destroyed the firstborn of every family
[1:03:06] similarly the blood or life of jesus
[1:03:08] christ must be publicly displayed in the
[1:03:11] lives of christians in order for them to
[1:03:13] make an exodus from this world to the
[1:03:15] rapture in the air and escape the
[1:03:17] oncoming great tribulation
[1:03:21] rahab's scarlet cord was publicly
[1:03:22] displayed so she and her house would be
[1:03:24] spared from jericho's destruction
[1:03:27] through her observable token she and her
[1:03:29] family made an exodus from god's wrath
[1:03:32] again the red cord represents a public
[1:03:34] testimony of the red blood of jesus
[1:03:36] christ
[1:03:37] since the bible teaches the life is in
[1:03:39] the blood these old testament symbols
[1:03:41] represent the life of jesus christ which
[1:03:44] is the holy spirit baptism must be
[1:03:46] publicly displayed by christians because
[1:03:48] the spirit is life
[1:03:50] just as your boarding pass is the
[1:03:52] assurance you'll have a seat on a flight
[1:03:55] the baptism of the holy ghost is your
[1:03:56] seal token or assurance you'll have a
[1:03:59] ticket for the rapture
[1:04:02] a second reward is escaping death for
[1:04:05] those who are alive and remain will not
[1:04:07] die but will instead have their vile
[1:04:10] mortal bodies changed into immortal ones
[1:04:12] though countless funerals have been
[1:04:14] observed for thousands of years there
[1:04:16] will be a small group of christians that
[1:04:18] will not need funeral services
[1:04:21] the rapture is a one-time worldwide
[1:04:23] death pass
[1:04:25] this miraculous event will be the first
[1:04:27] and only time a large group of saints
[1:04:29] will escape death this has never ever
[1:04:32] happened in world history up to the
[1:04:34] current time only two individuals have
[1:04:36] had the high calling of missing death
[1:04:38] only elijah and enoch
[1:04:41] all their saints have had to die think
[1:04:43] of it we may be that fortunate blessed
[1:04:46] privileged generation to join elijah and
[1:04:49] enoch as raptured saints
[1:04:51] if not us it will certainly be a
[1:04:53] generation in the near future because
[1:04:55] the signs of the rapture are evident
[1:04:59] a third reward is experiencing two
[1:05:01] glorious events in heavenly places while
[1:05:04] the earth is being plagued during the
[1:05:05] great tribulation
[1:05:06] the meeting in the air and the wedding
[1:05:08] supper of the lamb
[1:05:10] imagine meeting paul peter mary the
[1:05:12] mother of jesus tabitha and the rest of
[1:05:15] the saints in the sky at the rapture
[1:05:17] picture in your mind shaking hands with
[1:05:19] and instantly recognizing martin luther
[1:05:21] and john wesley how will you feel seeing
[1:05:24] your loved ones who have died but now
[1:05:26] you're reunited with them in young
[1:05:28] youthful new bodies
[1:05:30] this event includes the greatest reward
[1:05:32] finally seeing jesus christ god's only
[1:05:34] begotten son the risen lord of glory
[1:05:37] face to face
[1:05:39] oh how my heart races and tears begin
[1:05:42] forming in my eyes when i think of this
[1:05:43] moment when i shall not see through a
[1:05:46] glass darkly but shall see christ face
[1:05:49] to face
[1:05:50] not only will we see him but he shall
[1:05:52] change our vile body that it may be
[1:05:54] fashioned like unto his glorious body
[1:05:57] our eyes shall behold the desire of
[1:05:59] nations the bright morning star the
[1:06:02] fairest of ten thousand the root and
[1:06:04] offspring of david the holy one of
[1:06:06] israel and the faithful bridegroom your
[1:06:09] faith will become sight at the rapture
[1:06:11] no longer will we be able to say peter's
[1:06:14] words having not seen ye love
[1:06:17] i have seen my jesus the one i have
[1:06:19] loved
[1:06:21] the wedding supper takes place in heaven
[1:06:24] after the meeting in the air while
[1:06:25] scripture does not offer many details
[1:06:27] about this wedding reception
[1:06:29] it for sure entails both a bride
[1:06:31] presentation and communion service
[1:06:35] paul reveals the bride presentation in
[1:06:37] second corinthians 11 verse 2.
[1:06:39] for i am jealous over you with godly
[1:06:41] jealousy for i've espoused you to one
[1:06:43] husband that i may present you as a
[1:06:45] chaste virgin to christ
[1:06:47] the corinthian church was supernaturally
[1:06:49] birthed under paul's ministry in acts 18
[1:06:52] verses 1 through 17 by christ's divine
[1:06:55] direction
[1:06:56] the apostle writes about his duty to
[1:06:58] present the corinthian believers as
[1:07:00] chaste virgins to christ and the only
[1:07:02] logical time this could occur would be
[1:07:05] at the wedding supper of the lamb
[1:07:07] no doubt the believers died one by one
[1:07:09] after paul left their city leaving paul
[1:07:11] no chance to present them to christ but
[1:07:14] every faithful corinthian who receive
[1:07:16] paul's preaching about the baptism of
[1:07:18] the holy ghost will be resurrected for
[1:07:20] the rapture and will be gathered in
[1:07:22] heaven at the wedding supper
[1:07:24] this is when paul can present the bride
[1:07:25] members from corinth to their husband
[1:07:28] jesus christ
[1:07:29] it seems possible that all seven stars
[1:07:32] or human messengers to the seven
[1:07:33] churches will present the bride of his
[1:07:36] church age to jesus christ
[1:07:39] following the bride's presentation
[1:07:41] raptured saints will partake in the
[1:07:43] heavenly communion service
[1:07:45] just as jesus desired with desire to
[1:07:47] have communion with his disciples before
[1:07:49] his crucifixion and ascension to heaven
[1:07:52] the bishop of our souls will desire
[1:07:54] sweet communion with his bride after the
[1:07:56] gentile church ages have finished
[1:07:59] christ held communion with his disciples
[1:08:01] to signal the end of their intimate
[1:08:04] earthly communion but promised the next
[1:08:06] communion service would signal renewed
[1:08:08] intimate eternal fellowship
[1:08:11] melchizedek's communion with abram
[1:08:13] foreshadowed this communion in genesis
[1:08:15] 14 verses 14-20
[1:08:18] how entirely appropriate for christ to
[1:08:21] conduct communion after the trials of
[1:08:23] life are finished
[1:08:25] abram having defeated four kings with
[1:08:27] his trained army and restoring his
[1:08:29] nephew lot was met with bread wine and
[1:08:32] blessings by melchizedek
[1:08:35] communion at the wedding supper will
[1:08:36] also express that blessings and
[1:08:38] fellowship follow victorious battle
[1:08:41] christ the great promise keeper will
[1:08:43] fulfill the promise he gave to his
[1:08:45] disciples but i say unto you i will not
[1:08:48] drink henceforth of this fruit of the
[1:08:50] vine until that day when i drink it new
[1:08:53] with you in my father's kingdom
[1:08:56] experiencing christ's one thousand-year
[1:08:58] millennial reign as kings and priests is
[1:09:00] the fourth reward this millennial period
[1:09:03] represents the honeymoon period for
[1:09:05] christ and his bride naturally following
[1:09:07] the wedding ceremony rapture and
[1:09:10] reception marriage supper the lamb
[1:09:13] only a select group of people will enjoy
[1:09:14] this blessed sinless one thousand year
[1:09:17] day
[1:09:18] for one day is with the lord as a
[1:09:20] thousand years and a thousand years as
[1:09:22] one day
[1:09:24] revelation 20 verses 4 through 6 states
[1:09:26] exactly who will reign on the earth for
[1:09:29] one thousand peaceful years
[1:09:31] and i saw thrones and they sat upon them
[1:09:34] and judgment was given unto them and i
[1:09:36] saw the souls of them that were beheaded
[1:09:38] for the witness of jesus and for the
[1:09:40] word of god
[1:09:41] and which had not worshipped the beast
[1:09:43] neither his image neither had received
[1:09:45] his mark upon their foreheads or in
[1:09:47] their hands and they lived and reigned
[1:09:49] with christ a thousand years
[1:09:51] but the rest of the dead lived not again
[1:09:53] until the thousand years were finished
[1:09:55] this is the first resurrection blessed
[1:09:58] and holy is he that hath part in the
[1:10:00] first resurrection on such the second
[1:10:02] death hath no power but they shall be
[1:10:05] priests of god and of christ and shall
[1:10:07] reign with him a thousand years
[1:10:10] catch the fact that the rest of the dead
[1:10:12] do not live during the millennium only
[1:10:14] faithful christians who worship jesus in
[1:10:17] spirit and truth will live and reign
[1:10:19] with christ
[1:10:20] the foolish virgin will miss the
[1:10:22] millennium because she foolishly
[1:10:23] neglected the oil the baptism of the
[1:10:26] holy ghost
[1:10:27] christians are warned and admonished to
[1:10:30] not neglect the powerful holy ghost
[1:10:32] gospel
[1:10:33] additionally untold billions of
[1:10:35] believers will not experience the glory
[1:10:37] and beauty of a one thousand year period
[1:10:39] without sin
[1:10:42] imagine a millennium without the devil
[1:10:44] temptation lust greed murder destruction
[1:10:48] and politics
[1:10:49] for
[1:10:50] 365 000 straight days you'll enjoy only
[1:10:54] pure peace grace victory beauty and joy
[1:10:59] some christians will even reign over
[1:11:00] nations while others over small regions
[1:11:03] of the earth for jesus promised good
[1:11:06] faithful servants would have authority
[1:11:08] over ten cities
[1:11:10] submitting only to christ's spirit in
[1:11:11] this life
[1:11:13] as a cross-caring follower of jesus
[1:11:15] entitles you to lead cities perhaps even
[1:11:18] nations in the next life
[1:11:20] christ's words remain true he that is
[1:11:22] faithful in that which is least is
[1:11:24] faithful also in much
[1:11:26] a christian faithful over a few things
[1:11:29] will be made ruler over many things
[1:11:31] branham writes and now he jesus says
[1:11:35] that he who keeps doing his works
[1:11:37] faithfully until the end will be given
[1:11:39] power over nations and will be a strong
[1:11:42] capable unbending ruler who can cope so
[1:11:45] powerfully with any situation
[1:11:47] that even the most desperate enemy will
[1:11:49] be broken if need be his demonstration
[1:11:51] of rule by power will be like unto the
[1:11:54] very sons this is very amazing
[1:11:59] consequences for rejecting the
[1:12:01] revelation of the rapture
[1:12:03] the main consequence for rejecting the
[1:12:04] revelation of the rapture is
[1:12:06] unpreparedness for christ's return
[1:12:09] learn from jesus's teaching on
[1:12:11] stewardship to be prepared for the
[1:12:13] rapture by honoring those in your care
[1:12:16] being sober and doing christ's will
[1:12:20] god's shout has sounded and is now
[1:12:23] sounding in your ears neglecting this
[1:12:25] divine shout or bible-based message god
[1:12:28] sent through william branham produces a
[1:12:30] spiritual state of slumber paul says
[1:12:32] most people will be overtaken when jesus
[1:12:35] returns likewise the apostle admonishes
[1:12:38] christians to not let this opportunity
[1:12:40] to be baptized with the holy ghost and
[1:12:42] exit the earth in the rapture slip away
[1:12:45] from our minds god's mercy is placed in
[1:12:47] end time exodus right in our laps
[1:12:50] foolish is the only word suitable for
[1:12:52] describing those who reject this christ
[1:12:54] indwelling experience that was hid from
[1:12:56] ages and from generations but now is
[1:12:59] made manifest to his saints
[1:13:02] believers who reject the rapture
[1:13:04] revelation but die before the rapture
[1:13:07] will not have to experience the awful
[1:13:08] great tribulation period
[1:13:10] their consequences for rejection include
[1:13:13] being absent from the rapture
[1:13:15] the marriage supper the lamb and
[1:13:16] millennium
[1:13:18] believers who reject the rapture
[1:13:20] revelation but live long enough to
[1:13:22] physically miss the rapture will have to
[1:13:24] die in the tribulation
[1:13:26] being righteous yet not filled with the
[1:13:27] holy ghost god will not let them suffer
[1:13:30] the worst torments with the wicked
[1:13:32] before death jesus teaches that the
[1:13:34] foolish virgins will ask for an opening
[1:13:37] into the rapture after it has happened
[1:13:40] but christ's voice will answer back in
[1:13:41] their heart saying verily i say unto you
[1:13:44] i know you not
[1:13:45] the way to know jesus is to possess oil
[1:13:48] the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:13:51] indescribable torments of hail fire
[1:13:54] brimstone and inescapable demonic
[1:13:57] oppression contained in the seven
[1:13:59] trumpets and seven vowels await
[1:14:01] unbelievers the bible rejecting group
[1:14:04] sudden destruction and travail is
[1:14:06] determined upon them a time of trouble
[1:14:09] such as never was since there was a
[1:14:11] nation even to that same time
[1:14:15] conclusion
[1:14:17] clearly defined by pause a mystery the
[1:14:19] rapture or caught up experience is now
[1:14:21] revealed as a secret sudden going away
[1:14:24] of christ's bride with her beloved
[1:14:26] bridegroom to their marriage supper just
[1:14:28] before the great tribulation sets in
[1:14:31] upon the rest of humanity
[1:14:33] knowing the six reasons that prove the
[1:14:35] rapture occurs before the tribulation is
[1:14:37] a great blessing and should inspire
[1:14:39] christians to be awake and alert daily
[1:14:42] wearing and utilizing the full armor of
[1:14:44] god
[1:14:45] by god's amazing grace we'll accept his
[1:14:47] invitation and be prepared for this once
[1:14:49] in history event
[1:14:51] the privilege of skipping death with a
[1:14:53] small group of christians as jesus
[1:14:55] spirit changes our bodies for the
[1:14:57] meeting in the air
[1:15:00] now that all 12 mysteries are revealed
[1:15:02] chapter 13 shows how they were foretold
[1:15:05] to be revealed or finished nearly 2 000
[1:15:08] years ago in revelation 10 verse 7
[1:15:11] but in the days of the voice of the
[1:15:12] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[1:15:14] sound the mystery of god should be
[1:15:16] finished as he hath declared to his
[1:15:18] servants the prophets
[1:15:20] just as jesus identified the fulfillment
[1:15:22] of scripture at his first coming in luke
[1:15:25] 4 21 we too can echo his declaration of
[1:15:28] another scripture being fulfilled this
[1:15:31] day this scripture revelation 10 7 is
[1:15:34] fulfilled
[1:15:37] action steps to be in the rapture
[1:15:39] step 1 be sure you are baptized in the
[1:15:42] name of the lord jesus christ and fill
[1:15:44] with the holy ghost baptism
[1:15:47] step 2
[1:15:48] find grow in and remain in your position
[1:15:52] in your family local church and
[1:15:54] ministries
[1:15:56] step 3 daily watch and pray for the
[1:15:59] imminent return of jesus christ and
[1:16:01] you'll be prepared because all that love
[1:16:03] him will see his appearing 2 timothy 4
[1:16:06] verse 8.
