[0:03] Revelation chapter 12 the theme of this
[0:09] chapter is simply Israel as she is the
[0:12] woman clothed with the Sun who brought
[0:14] forth a man child Jesus Christ whom the
[0:17] great red dragon Satan tried to devour
[0:20] but failed because this chapter is
[0:25] highly symbolic we will combine the
[0:27] timing symbols and key revelations and
[0:30] go from the beginning of the chapter to
[0:32] the end
[0:33] the timing of verses 1 & 2 was just
[0:37] before the birth of Jesus Christ the
[0:41] woman with a crown of twelve stars was
[0:43] the people of Israel for the twelve
[0:45] stars represent the 12 tribes of Israel
[0:48] the woman's clothing of the Sun
[0:50] represents God's grace or his
[0:53] righteousness apart from the law that
[0:55] she was promised and will be given
[0:58] through this man child the moon
[1:01] represents the law that was under her
[1:03] feet because the moon constantly has a
[1:06] shadow on it and the Bible said the law
[1:09] having a shadow of good things to come
[1:11] in Hebrews 10 verse 1 the timing of
[1:16] verses 3 & 4 was again just before the
[1:19] birth of Jesus Christ
[1:21] the great red dragon was Satan as we are
[1:25] told this interpretation in verse 9
[1:27] notice in verse 4 that Satan drew a
[1:30] third part of the stars of heaven and
[1:32] cast them to the earth which represents
[1:35] Satan deceiving a third of the angels in
[1:37] heaven and bringing them to earth to
[1:39] help him carry out his plans to steal
[1:42] kill and destroy
[1:46] the dragon then stood before the woman
[1:48] Israel ready to devour the Christ child
[1:51] which was fulfilled in Matthew 2 verses
[1:54] 16 through 18
[1:55] when Herod slew all the children in
[1:57] Bethlehem from two years old and under
[2:02] the timing of verses five and six was
[2:05] during the first coming of Jesus Christ
[2:07] to the earth
[2:09] verse five speaks of the birth and life
[2:11] of Christ and the prophecy of his rule
[2:14] with a rod of iron during the 1,000 year
[2:17] millennial reign as taught in Revelation
[2:20] 19 verse 15 and revelation 20 verses one
[2:23] through six
[2:25] the manchild Christ was caught up unto
[2:29] God and his throne when he ascended to
[2:31] the Father 40 days after his
[2:34] resurrection according to Acts chapter 1
[2:36] verses 3 through 9 Hebrews 8:1 and
[2:39] revelation 3:21 this is where Christ is
[2:43] currently seated right now as High
[2:46] Priest according to Hebrews 7 verses 24
[2:49] through 26 and Hebrews 8 verse 1 in
[2:53] verse 6 the fleeing of this woman Israel
[2:56] into the wilderness represents that the
[2:59] Jews rejected their Messiah and were
[3:01] broken off from the life of Christ in
[3:04] the New Testament according to Romans 11
[3:07] verse 19 God foreknew they would reject
[3:10] his son so he blinded them in order to
[3:12] call out a Gentile bride for his
[3:15] namesake according to Romans 11:25 and
[3:18] Acts 1514 yet our merciful God had a
[3:22] place prepared for them meaning he would
[3:25] not forsake them as the fifth seal
[3:27] proved and promised to feed them with
[3:30] the preaching of the two witnesses
[3:32] during the 1260 days or
[3:35] three-and-a-half-year ministry during
[3:37] the Tribulation Period taught in
[3:39] Revelation chapter 11 verse 3
[3:43] the timing of verses seven through nine
[3:46] was sometime before Adam and Eve fell
[3:48] into sin because we are told how the
[3:51] dragon Satan was first cast to the earth
[3:54] Satan and his angels had fought a war
[3:57] against Michael the Archangel and his
[3:59] angels
[3:59] according to Jude 1 verse 9 and lost
[4:02] being cast to the earth a key revelation
[4:06] from chapter 12 verse 9 is that Satan
[4:09] deceives the whole world
[4:15] as also taught in Revelation 13:7
[4:21] 14-8
[4:26] eighteen three
[4:30] and 1823
[4:35] as every Kingdom is ultimately
[4:38] influenced and controlled by Satan
[4:40] according to Jesus Christ himself in
[4:43] Matthew 4 verses 8 & 9
[4:46] Satan's tool for deception is the false
[4:49] Church the Roman Catholic Church who is
[4:52] Mystery Babylon which we will cover in
[4:54] Revelation chapters 13 17 and 18
[5:00] the timing of verses 10 through 12 is at
[5:03] the beginning of and during the
[5:05] Tribulation Period
[5:07] the Lord's Day is coming in these verses
[5:09] meaning the kingdoms of men are going to
[5:12] fall to Christ and his kingdom Satan the
[5:15] accuser of the brethren is cast down out
[5:18] of heaven
[5:19] immediately after the rapture of the New
[5:21] Testament Bride of Christ Satan knows
[5:24] his time is short only three and a half
[5:26] years and so he comes to the earth with
[5:29] great wrath ready to lay down his evil
[5:31] mark of the beast but the 144,000 Jews
[5:35] will overcome Satan by the blood of the
[5:38] Lamb and the word of their testimony
[5:39] even loving Christ more than their own
[5:42] lives
[5:45] the timing of verses 13 through 17 is
[5:48] again during the Tribulation Period in
[5:51] verse 13 we learn more about Satan's
[5:54] plan to persecute Israel even going to
[5:56] make war against Israel but God will
[5:59] nourish her for three and a half years
[6:00] through the Ministry of the two prophets
[6:03] or witnesses of revelation 11 verse 3
[6:07] God's love for Israel will swallow up a
[6:10] flood that Satan tries to bring against
[6:12] her
[6:14] a key revelation is the woman's remnant
[6:17] which must be the 144,000 mentioned
[6:20] earlier in Revelation 7 verses 1 through
[6:23] 8 for the Bible records this remnant as
[6:26] having both the commandments of God
[6:28] which is faith in the infallible
[6:31] teachings of the Old Testament and the
[6:33] testimony of Jesus Christ the New
[6:36] Testament faith if you would like more
[6:40] bible scriptures quotations or if you
[6:42] have any questions about the book of
[6:44] Revelation please contact us god bless
[6:48] you and may Jesus Christ be the desire
[6:50] of your heart
