[1:10] god bless you and welcome to the
[1:12] defending the message podcast i'm your
[1:14] co-host pastor jesse smith and here's
[1:17] our other co-host
[1:18] um i'm amen and nice to meet you guys
[1:20] and glad to be here it's a real blessing
[1:23] to start a podcast our desire is to
[1:26] defend jesus christ's message for this
[1:29] day
[1:30] along with his messenger for the day as
[1:34] well so this first initial topic will be
[1:37] about
[1:38] what is the message so we'll start with
[1:40] brother amen and we'll let him share
[1:42] what he feels the message is to him
[1:45] the message is god's word being revealed
[1:48] to the saints the ones that will believe
[1:50] it everything in the bible
[1:53] and it's much more than
[1:54] jesus accept jesus in your heart it's a
[1:57] lot more than that it's preparing god's
[1:59] people for a rapture
[2:01] and to restore the word of god that's
[2:03] what i feel the message is
[2:06] amen that's beautiful i would agree
[2:08] and uh so through this podcast we're
[2:10] gonna point to numerous scriptures
[2:12] because we want to start with the bible
[2:13] first yes definitely like brother amen
[2:16] and i were talking uh and we agree that
[2:18] the bible is the absolute i really like
[2:21] how some scriptures say
[2:23] you know every let god's word be the
[2:25] truth and every man be a liar you know a
[2:28] lot of people have a lot of different
[2:29] opinions different doctrines
[2:32] different teachings you know it's like
[2:34] there's so much out there you don't know
[2:35] who to believe and that's why you need
[2:37] the bible to be a filter take everything
[2:39] back to word of god what does the bible
[2:41] say if you have a man opinion and
[2:43] another man's opinion you're gonna
[2:44] believe you wanna believe the word of
[2:45] god
[2:47] absolutely yeah just like jesus said
[2:48] heaven earth shall pass away but my
[2:50] words will never pass away
[2:52] that's right
[2:53] let's share some scriptures about god's
[2:55] word being the absolute okay i have one
[2:58] from numbers 23 19
[3:00] god is not a man that he should lie
[3:02] neither the son of a man
[3:04] that he said repent half he said and ha
[3:07] sally not do it or have he spoke and
[3:09] certainly not make it good it just shows
[3:12] that god whatever god says is going to
[3:14] come to pass it's like keeping the
[3:16] promises to god you know it's going to
[3:18] come to pass and it's due time and due
[3:20] season but it's never going to fail or
[3:22] come back empty yeah the bible is
[3:24] certainly our absolute at our church as
[3:27] it is at many churches
[3:29] i'm thinking of romans 3 4 where paul
[3:31] said god forbid yea let god be true but
[3:34] every man a liar so we know men are
[3:37] saved right men and women are both saved
[3:40] and this scripture is not saying that
[3:42] men and women always lie
[3:44] but this scripture is emphasizing that
[3:46] god can never lie god can never deceive
[3:50] and so the only one who can be the
[3:51] absolute the ultimate authority with no
[3:54] mistakes no lies
[3:57] no deception is god himself and then
[3:59] john chapter 1 says in the beginning was
[4:02] the word and the word was with god and
[4:04] the word
[4:05] was god and the scripture says the word
[4:08] was made flesh and dwelt among us so we
[4:11] see how jesus christ
[4:13] is the word and the bible is his
[4:16] revelation of himself to us
[4:19] well let's talk a little bit about
[4:22] the king james version and why we
[4:23] believe the only king james version
[4:25] yeah certainly we'll probably do a whole
[4:27] another video on the king james itself
[4:29] but just as a short summary
[4:32] i think i listed at least seven reasons
[4:34] why i use the king james bible and we
[4:37] believe it is the most reliable
[4:39] translation
[4:41] known to man today so just briefly the
[4:43] king james has a supernatural origin
[4:46] it was an answer of prayer
[4:49] as william tyndale was martyred
[4:52] and god heard his prayer and gave us an
[4:54] english translation second the king
[4:56] james version is an accurate word for
[4:58] word translation
[5:00] every word of god is pure and other
[5:02] translations are thought for thought but
[5:04] they could be the wrong thought
[5:07] third other versions of the bible delete
[5:09] portions
[5:11] of the king james version and make
[5:13] changes but you cannot add or take away
[5:15] one word of god
[5:17] fourth the language gives greater
[5:19] understanding
[5:20] every word is important in the king
[5:22] james and the translators gave us those
[5:24] words to understand it better if you
[5:27] take those away
[5:29] the bible loses its meaning
[5:31] fifth mighty men of god use the king
[5:33] james like spurgeon jonathan edwards
[5:35] george whitfield
[5:37] other revivalists even william branham
[5:40] god's prophet for this day
[5:42] my own mother was healed of cancer by
[5:44] quoting the king james version so i've
[5:47] seen it do great miracles as well
[5:49] sixth
[5:50] the pure words of the king james created
[5:52] the most holy civilization in history
[5:55] which is the united states of america
[5:57] this is because the king james is the
[5:59] incorruptible seed
[6:01] word of god so america was built upon
[6:04] the king james version and seventh the
[6:06] king james has no copyright so it's free
[6:08] in public domain other bible
[6:10] translations are sometimes after your
[6:11] money yes uh here's a good example that
[6:14] i i personally really like i remember
[6:17] when i had a dream where i met jesus
[6:20] and i was buying on before him and he's
[6:22] like because you've done this i'm gonna
[6:24] give you the morning star
[6:25] and i remember you went and you preached
[6:27] on the different bible translations and
[6:29] i believe it was the niv that called
[6:31] satan the morning star or lucifer the
[6:33] morning star which was an nfp
[6:35] translation i'm like that's not right if
[6:37] you look in revelations jesus said i'll
[6:39] give you the morning star if you
[6:41] overcome so jesus doesn't say i'm going
[6:43] to give you lucifer you overcome so that
[6:45] definitely is a bible translation error
[6:48] and that's why we stick to the king
[6:49] james version because it doesn't call
[6:51] lucifer the morning star jesus christ is
[6:53] only the morning star
[6:55] going back to your morning star example
[6:57] brother amen you're right modern bible
[6:59] versions cause much confusion like the
[7:01] example you gave of isaiah 14 12 which
[7:04] calls satan lucifer son of the morning
[7:07] in the king james the king james is
[7:09] correct because it's the original but in
[7:11] the niv lucifer is taken out and he's
[7:14] called simply morning star
[7:16] this causes confusion because lucifer's
[7:18] name is deleted in the niv and satan now
[7:21] takes the title morning star which was a
[7:23] title for jesus in the king james from
[7:26] revelation 22 16 where jesus said i am
[7:29] the morning star it's plain to see that
[7:31] nivea is attempting to make lucifer
[7:33] equal to jesus in order to ultimately
[7:36] steal worship from christ
[7:38] and to go along with that the niv also
[7:40] deletes the latter portion of mark
[7:42] chapter 16 where it talks about these
[7:45] signs shall follow them that believe it
[7:47] also deletes first john 5 7 about the
[7:50] father the word and the holy ghost these
[7:51] three are one it doesn't say these are
[7:53] three different persons so there's two
[7:56] more good examples to go along with your
[7:57] example
[7:58] of course we are not scholars but the
[8:00] main point in the bible version debate
[8:03] is that if any version takes away from
[8:05] the king james it is deleting god's pure
[8:08] words and then should be avoided so we
[8:10] don't need to be scholars in order to be
[8:12] right on this subject because we just
[8:14] need to compare the bible versions and
[8:16] see which ones take away from the king
[8:18] james and if they do avoid them and this
[8:21] has been the case with every bible
[8:23] version i've compared to date
[8:25] every modern version takes away god's
[8:27] pure words
[8:28] that teaches sound doctrine in the king
[8:30] james version
[8:36] so the next part is what is the message
[8:40] and we believe it's in three parts god
[8:42] revealing the word god restoring the
[8:44] word back to the original
[8:46] and rapturing his bride or getting his
[8:49] bride ready for a rapture because
[8:50] everyone knows you know we're at the end
[8:52] of the world you can just look around
[8:54] and you see all everything's falling
[8:55] apart i mean even
[8:57] all the people like in the media the
[8:59] rich people everyone they all know it's
[9:02] the end of the world and you can already
[9:03] see satan already building his kingdom
[9:05] and while he's building his kingdom
[9:07] god's building his but he's keeping it
[9:09] secret from everyone the rest of the
[9:10] world
[9:11] that's right that's right the bible says
[9:13] the secret things belong to the lord
[9:15] that's exactly right i have to look up
[9:16] the scripture reference but that's
[9:18] deuteronomy 29 verse 29 the secret
[9:20] things belong unto the lord our god but
[9:22] those things which are revealed belong
[9:24] unto us and to our children forever that
[9:26] we may do all the words of this law and
[9:28] that goes with how jesus and paul both
[9:30] said jesus is coming we'll be like a
[9:32] thief in the night it'll be a secret
[9:34] coming
[9:35] of jesus christ the husband to rapture
[9:38] away his bride
[9:39] yes if you look in the world today it's
[9:42] not really well known what the message
[9:44] is or a lot of people don't know what
[9:45] the message is or never heard of it
[9:47] because it's really secret and if you're
[9:49] looking for god's truth he'll bring you
[9:51] into it if you desire to serve god and
[9:54] to know the truth of everything that's
[9:56] exactly right and the reason it is
[9:58] secret is because jesus said he was
[10:00] going to hide it from the eyes of the
[10:02] wise and prude it but reveal it unto
[10:04] babes such as would learn so the only
[10:07] reason it's secret is because the
[10:08] denominations or the independents
[10:11] or the major churches don't want to hear
[10:13] it they've suppressed it and they're
[10:15] actually keeping it away from their
[10:17] people
[10:18] but god's word will never return void
[10:21] all those that want to believe the truth
[10:22] of god's word all those that want to be
[10:24] in the rapture want to be filled with
[10:26] the holy ghost god will direct his word
[10:28] to them amen well let's go to the first
[10:31] one is revealing the word of god at the
[10:33] really first scripture that comes to
[10:35] mind is revelation 1 1-3
[10:38] uh let me read it real quick the
[10:39] revelation of jesus christ which god
[10:41] gave unto him to sow unto his servants
[10:43] things which must shortly come to pass
[10:46] and he sent and signify it by his angels
[10:49] unto his servant john who bear record of
[10:51] the word of god and the testimony of
[10:52] jesus christ and of all things that he
[10:54] saw blessed is he that readeth and they
[10:57] that hear the words of this prophecy and
[10:59] keep these things which are written
[11:00] therein for the time is at hand
[11:03] if you look at revelation we're living
[11:04] in that time right now and this
[11:07] scripture really pertains to us now even
[11:09] though it's written 2000 years ago it's
[11:12] pertaining to us because we're living
[11:13] these prophecies that are coming to pass
[11:16] and this is god revealing the word and
[11:18] showing us things to come
[11:19] absolutely that's a beautiful portion of
[11:22] scripture because we're blessed to read
[11:24] revelation and hear it and then
[11:27] as we'll move on eventually
[11:30] we'll show revelation 10 7 says the
[11:32] mystery of god
[11:34] has to be finished so we have to
[11:36] understand the book of revelation where
[11:38] we're not guessing at the major themes
[11:40] and the major prophecies
[11:42] but the holy spirit has showed them to
[11:44] us because it's prophecy he has to
[11:47] finish the mystery and he's of course
[11:49] going to share those mysteries with his
[11:52] people with his church
[11:53] i have another good scripture john 16 13
[11:56] it says how be it when he the spirit of
[11:59] truth has come he will guide you into
[12:01] all truth for he shall not speak of
[12:03] himself but whatever he shall hear that
[12:06] he shall speak and he will show you the
[12:07] things to come
[12:09] you know saying that if you have the
[12:10] holy ghost you're going to know and see
[12:13] the things that are going to come to
[12:14] pass and talking about revelation of the
[12:17] word of god revealing the word of god to
[12:19] you and opening your eyes to what's
[12:21] happening
[12:22] absolutely and that kind of goes how
[12:24] jesus said in matthew 24. you know
[12:26] before his second coming we would hear
[12:28] about wars and rumors of wars and
[12:30] there'd be pestilences
[12:33] but these are the beginning of birth
[12:35] pains or sorrows
[12:36] and so because jesus foretold these
[12:38] things now we can be prepared for things
[12:41] like more viruses or we can be prepared
[12:44] to handle rumors about russia and the
[12:46] united states having wars
[12:48] all these things because he's foretold
[12:49] us these things and he said i'm gonna
[12:52] jesus also said i'm gonna leave you my
[12:54] peace so we don't have to worry about
[12:55] these things we have to fret he's
[12:57] foretold us the future and we also know
[13:00] about the mark of the beast that's to
[13:02] come and how the true church will not
[13:04] accept the mark of the beast the true
[13:06] church will actually be spared from the
[13:08] pouring out or the issuing out of the
[13:10] mark of the beast because jesus said i'm
[13:12] going to keep you from that hour
[13:18] okay with the next point we're talking
[13:20] about is restoring the word of god which
[13:22] is a really big topic a lot of churches
[13:25] teach about things that are man-made
[13:29] a big one would be the beginning of adam
[13:31] and eve with eve eating a fruit which is
[13:34] not the case according to the bible and
[13:37] that's a big false teaching so god came
[13:39] back to restore the original word and
[13:42] there's a um the bible verse in joel 2
[13:44] 25 says and i will restore to you the
[13:46] years that the locusts have eaten they
[13:48] can't get warm the caterpillar and the
[13:50] palmer worm my great army which i sent
[13:52] among you
[13:53] that's sowing god's restoring the word
[13:54] of god
[13:56] that's a great point and then you also
[13:58] combine that with acts 3 verse 20 and 21
[14:02] where peter says jesus remains in heaven
[14:04] until the restitution of all things so
[14:07] there's a restoration that has to take
[14:09] place at the end like brother amen said
[14:11] revelation takes place and now
[14:14] restoration has to take place as well
[14:16] god has to reveal his word and that
[14:18] restores our hearts yes malachi 4 5 6
[14:22] behold i will send you elijah the
[14:23] prophet before the coming and great and
[14:26] dreadful day of the lord and he shall
[14:28] turn the heart of the fathers to the
[14:29] children and the heart of the children
[14:31] to their fathers lest thy cometh smite
[14:33] the earth with a curse and as god said
[14:36] he'll send elijah before the coming of
[14:38] the great and dreadful dead lord that
[14:40] that obviously is the tribulation
[14:41] there's nothing else that's more
[14:42] dreadful than the tribulation and since
[14:44] we're living in this time god has to
[14:46] send elijah and people the misconception
[14:49] is people think that the prophets are
[14:51] done or there's no more prophets
[14:53] ever since jesus came but that's not the
[14:55] case because paul was a prophet and
[14:57] after paul there were other more
[14:58] prophets that came we'll show we'll
[15:00] still that more in the future absolutely
[15:03] agabus in the book of acts and then you
[15:04] had john was a prophet who
[15:07] you know wrote the book of revelation so
[15:08] yeah we should dedicate a whole podcast
[15:10] just go showing how profits were after
[15:13] jesus and we've had profits throughout
[15:15] the last 2000 years we might call some
[15:18] major we might call some minor but the
[15:20] fact is the profit office has never left
[15:24] although many churches do away with it
[15:26] it's still a genuine office of god i
[15:29] would add to that as well matthew 17
[15:31] verse 11 jesus said elias or the spirit
[15:34] of elijah truly shall first come and
[15:36] restore all things here's another
[15:38] scripture to go along with joel 2
[15:40] acts 3
[15:41] matthew 17 says elijah's going to
[15:44] restore all things so anyone who looks
[15:46] at just the church broad with over 30
[15:49] 000 denominations you'd look at it and
[15:52] think not every church looks like the
[15:54] book of acts church how could god allow
[15:56] this well we know god has allowed every
[15:58] man their free choice and they've made
[16:00] choices to leave the word of god but we
[16:02] have a promise that god is going to
[16:04] restore the true church at the end times
[16:07] so that's what we believe we're a part
[16:08] of we're not perfect but we look at our
[16:11] lives and we see the holy ghost moving
[16:13] in our lives and we see our lives in
[16:16] ministry closely matching the book of
[16:18] acts and that's what we're desiring to
[16:19] do to let the holy spirit restore our
[16:22] hearts and our teachings back to the
[16:24] book of acts this is a scripture where
[16:27] god says god takes the man but not his
[16:29] spirit so in that particular case
[16:32] elijah's spirit is upon some of the
[16:35] saints of old and even to now if you
[16:37] look in the scripture there elijah comes
[16:39] five times which is elijah the first
[16:41] time elisha who had a double portion of
[16:44] elijah he had john the baptist and then
[16:46] the fourth one who believed his brother
[16:48] branham in this end time and then the
[16:50] last one would be elijah again with the
[16:51] two prophets in the book of revelation
[16:54] when he comes back to the jews
[17:00] and the rapture one that's just the one
[17:02] that gets people's attention the most
[17:04] because that's the one thing that people
[17:05] don't want to miss is the rapture and
[17:07] with the rapture there's a lot of things
[17:10] in it that people don't see or
[17:12] understand but then they'll think
[17:14] they'll make the rapture which is
[17:16] very scary but also
[17:18] you have to go over god's blueprint in
[17:21] order to make it and that's why we have
[17:22] the word of god to reveal these things
[17:24] so that we're ready for the rapture
[17:26] and there's a there's a good rapture
[17:28] scripture which is the parable the 10
[17:31] virgins five wives five foolish showing
[17:34] that there's two types of christians
[17:36] which is a really good topic to talk
[17:38] about there are two types of christians
[17:40] the foolish and the wise and they're
[17:42] both virgin unto the lord
[17:44] both looking for the coming of the lord
[17:46] but only five of them have the holy
[17:48] ghost who were ready for the coming of
[17:50] the lord and that's when we look at it
[17:53] the five foolish virgins are the ones
[17:55] who i believe are in denominations who
[17:58] love god and are pure to god but they
[18:00] can't live fully the word of god because
[18:03] they don't understand it or because they
[18:05] never taught it
[18:07] yeah that's the scripture of matthew 25
[18:10] verse 1 to 13.
[18:12] and there's two groups there's a wise
[18:14] foolish the wise had oil and oil
[18:16] according to zechariah chapter four
[18:19] is the holy ghost not by might not by
[18:22] power but by my spirit saith the lord so
[18:25] there's two groups of christians one
[18:27] have the baptism the holy ghost and the
[18:29] others don't oh to go along with that
[18:31] there's also a shout or cry that the
[18:34] bridegroom is coming and so that's what
[18:37] has happened in this day that's what the
[18:39] message is today a shout has gone forth
[18:41] behold the bridegroom cometh behold the
[18:44] rapture is coming behold jesus christ is
[18:46] returning and if you go to revelation 19
[18:48] it says
[18:49] his wife hath made herself ready so
[18:51] that's part of the message that we're
[18:53] talking about today is the bride of
[18:55] christ making herself ready
[18:57] i think a big misconception with the
[18:59] whole how the world views christianity
[19:01] is they lump christianity into one big
[19:03] group thinking everyone's
[19:05] oh they all love jesus but they all
[19:07] treat everyone kind of bad because some
[19:09] christians do it and that's a big
[19:11] misconception like the catholics they
[19:13] don't represent the whole christianity
[19:15] or the protestants you know there's
[19:17] different groups within christianity
[19:18] they don't represent the pure word of
[19:20] god
[19:21] and the prayer word of god only comes to
[19:23] those who receive the prophet and the
[19:25] teachings of it
[19:27] beautiful thought brother like jesus
[19:29] said jesus breaks up christians into two
[19:31] groups
[19:32] wise and foolish and then you have
[19:34] as jesus taught in the parable of the
[19:36] four grounds then you have another group
[19:38] who are impersonating christianity those
[19:40] are called the workers of iniquity those
[19:42] are the ones like judas is scared who
[19:44] hang around for a while but then sell
[19:46] out the gospel at the end of course in
[19:49] this group you'd have modern day false
[19:50] prophets like we could name many of them
[19:52] on youtube or
[19:54] on christian television networks where
[19:56] they are
[19:57] lying false prophets well they're
[19:59] another group as well so
[20:01] jesus gives us the divisions you have
[20:03] the wise holy ghost filled you have the
[20:05] foolish
[20:06] that are pure to the word of god they're
[20:08] virgin to the word of god but they don't
[20:10] have the baptism of the holy ghost and
[20:12] then you have another group
[20:14] that jesus calls also tares and they
[20:17] live off the anointing of the holy
[20:19] spirit they do
[20:20] miracles signs and wonders but in their
[20:22] teaching they deny him and are
[20:24] ultimately lost as false prophets
[20:27] that's a really good scripture you bring
[20:28] up with the parable of the four kinds of
[20:30] grounds with just the four different
[20:32] kinds of people that live here there's
[20:34] also one in revelation where jesus said
[20:36] he that is holy then be holy still he
[20:38] that's righteous let it be righteous
[20:40] though he is that filthy let me filthy
[20:42] still so also supports that there are
[20:44] different types of christians and
[20:46] different types of people here on earth
[20:48] so the rapture is jesus secretly and
[20:51] suddenly snatching away his holy ghost
[20:54] phil bride off the earth as the last
[20:57] climatic culminating event before the
[21:00] tribulation period yeah that says in
[21:02] revelation 3 10 because thou has kept
[21:04] the word of my patience i will also keep
[21:06] thee from the our temptation which shall
[21:08] come upon the earth the world for them
[21:10] to try them that dwell upon the earth
[21:13] i've listened to a lot of people who
[21:14] talk about having dreams about the
[21:16] rapture but sometimes it might be
[21:18] deceiving i would say because jesus said
[21:21] many who have a call but only few are
[21:24] chosen and many people have dreams about
[21:26] the rapture but look at their lives they
[21:28] don't live here they don't live holy
[21:30] they don't obey the word and yet they
[21:31] have dreams that they see the rapture oh
[21:33] they're gonna make it god's calling them
[21:35] that they can make it and they can be
[21:37] part of it or just because you have
[21:39] those dreams and you think you'll make
[21:40] it doesn't mean you'll you'll be called
[21:42] to partake in the rapture it's just
[21:44] there to show you that hey you have to
[21:46] get ready for this coming of the lord
[21:49] absolutely and that goes along with what
[21:51] revelation 19 said the bride makes
[21:54] herself ready
[21:55] and that would be a life that is
[21:59] led by every word of god like jesus said
[22:01] in matthew chapter 4 he said man does
[22:04] not live by bread alone but by every
[22:06] word that proceeds out of the mouth of
[22:07] god so people all around the world feel
[22:10] the pull that the rapture is going to
[22:12] happen so they're dreaming about it
[22:14] there they're talking about it all the
[22:16] time
[22:17] but just having dreams or talking about
[22:19] it doesn't prepare you for the rapture
[22:21] it takes you submitting to the holy
[22:23] ghost in your life where you're saved
[22:26] you're sanctified and you're filled with
[22:28] the holy spirit and if you do that then
[22:29] the bible says in first john all those
[22:32] who have this hope of seeing jesus at
[22:34] his second coming
[22:35] purify themselves
[22:37] yep and that's the one way to make the
[22:39] rapture is getting the baptism of the
[22:41] holy ghost that is the only way to make
[22:43] it
[22:44] two major scriptures talk about the
[22:46] rapture first corinthians 15 and then
[22:49] also first thessalonians chapter four
[22:52] here let me read um first thessalonians
[22:54] 4 14-17 for if we believe that jesus
[22:57] died and rose again even so them also
[23:00] would sleep in jesus will god bring with
[23:02] him for this we say unto you by the word
[23:04] of the lord that which we are alive and
[23:06] remain unto the coming of the lord shall
[23:08] not prevent them which are asleep for
[23:10] the lord himself shall descend from
[23:12] heaven with the south and with a voice
[23:14] of the archangel and with the trump of
[23:16] god and the dead in christ shall rise
[23:18] first then we which are alive and remain
[23:20] shall be caught up together with them in
[23:22] the clouds to meet the lord in the air
[23:24] so shall we ever be with the lord
[23:27] and we believe that the shout already
[23:29] happened with brother branham preparing
[23:31] the bride and getting them waking them
[23:33] up and preparing them for the lord and
[23:35] the voice has not happened yet which is
[23:38] the resurrection of the saints
[23:40] and the trump which is the media we
[23:42] haven't seen that yet which is the
[23:44] rapture
[23:45] and paul's scriptures there coincide
[23:47] with the words he wrote to the
[23:49] corinthians in first corinthians 15
[23:51] 51-52
[23:53] behold i show you a mystery we shall not
[23:55] all sleep but we shall all be changed in
[23:57] a moment
[23:58] in the twinkling of an eye at the last
[24:01] trump
[24:02] for the trumpet shall sound and the dead
[24:04] shall be raised incorruptable and we
[24:06] shall be changed so notice it mentions
[24:08] the last trump like brother amen just
[24:10] read shout voice
[24:12] trump so that's the order and that's the
[24:15] hope of the church to be ready for this
[24:18] moment because it's a secret snatching
[24:20] away of christ's bride off the earth
[24:22] before the awful tribulation period i
[24:25] just want to clarify something that the
[24:27] word rapture is not in the bible but the
[24:30] definition of the word rapture is
[24:32] supported through the bible but if you
[24:34] look at the word trinity it is
[24:36] not the same definition
[24:38] and you can't use that in the bible
[24:40] because there's no such thing as a three
[24:41] gods in one
[24:43] i agree
[24:44] the difference between the rapture and
[24:45] the trinity is that the definition of
[24:47] the rapture is in the bible but the
[24:49] definition of the godhead is not you
[24:51] never see god saying i'm three persons
[24:54] or jesus saying i'm a second separate
[24:56] co-equal person then the father and the
[24:59] holy ghost
[25:00] there's no doubt a great mysterious
[25:02] element to the godhead but jesus clearly
[25:04] said the father is greater than i so
[25:07] right there just that one verse dispels
[25:09] all the trinity dogma that says they're
[25:11] co-equal
[25:12] co-powerful co-eternal persons because
[25:15] jesus said the father is greater than i
[25:17] god is only one person jesus of nazareth
[25:20] was god's image for god is invisible and
[25:23] never has been nor ever will be seen
[25:26] jesus of nazareth was both fully human
[25:28] and fully god and the fully god part of
[25:30] jesus was greater than the human part of
[25:32] jesus which is why jesus said the father
[25:35] is greater than i
[25:36] the father dwelt in jesus the son and
[25:39] the father dwelling in jesus made jesus
[25:41] supreme deity one person not three
[25:43] persons
[25:49] okay so let's talk about this um we have
[25:52] i know we have a lot of different
[25:54] beliefs or doctrines which support the
[25:56] bible so where are we getting all this
[25:58] from so we believe that we got it from
[26:00] william branham we believe is the son of
[26:02] angel so if you look at revelations 10 7
[26:06] it says but in the days of the voice of
[26:08] the seventh angel which he shall begin
[26:10] to sound the mystery of god should be
[26:12] finished as he have declared to unto his
[26:14] servants the prophets
[26:16] saying that god sent elijah which is the
[26:18] son of angel who is going to restore the
[26:21] original word which is what we believe
[26:23] is there's only one god not three gods
[26:25] there's a lot of more things in the
[26:27] doctrines that we believe in but it's
[26:29] all supported by scripture and we all
[26:31] got this from our prophet brother brown
[26:33] william brandon
[26:35] yeah brother branham was born around
[26:36] 1909 and died in 1965
[26:39] had a worldwide amazing supernatural
[26:42] healing ministry god progressed his
[26:45] ministry as he went along and by the end
[26:47] of his ministry he was finishing the
[26:49] mystery of god in other words fulfilling
[26:51] revelation 10 7. throughout his whole
[26:53] ministry though he was doing prophetic
[26:55] ministry which would fulfill luke 17 30.
[26:58] so brother amen will read luke 17 30.
[27:01] even thus shall be in the day when the
[27:03] son of man is revealed
[27:05] so jesus talks about his second coming
[27:07] as being a son of man coming and son of
[27:10] man always represents a prophet see
[27:12] ezekiel ezekiel was called son of man
[27:15] scores of times so jesus said before i
[27:18] come the second time it'll be a son of
[27:20] man ministry and so brother branham had
[27:22] a prophetic ministry he foretold
[27:25] numerous things in the name of the lord
[27:27] that came to pass
[27:29] i have a video about it on my youtube
[27:31] channel called three prophecies of
[27:32] brother branham and then there's
[27:34] numerous people i've met where brother
[27:35] branham told them the future
[27:37] and it came to pass such as with
[27:39] florence humes who was healed of
[27:41] tuberculosis in the 1950s and lived to
[27:44] about 2010 and she was told the future
[27:47] by brother branham in the name of the
[27:49] lord jesus and it came to pass
[27:51] there's a lot of videos of preachers who
[27:54] are who love the ministry of bible brown
[27:56] but are against this doctrine and
[27:58] they've a lot of people
[28:00] don't understand that the things he
[28:02] preached actually come back to the bible
[28:04] and because their beliefs don't agree
[28:06] with his doctrine or the doctrines from
[28:08] the bible they are against him and say
[28:10] he's a false preacher
[28:12] and they only enjoy the healing miracles
[28:15] and you look at that that types jesus
[28:16] christ too because jesus did a lot of
[28:18] miracles a lot of healings but then when
[28:20] he preached the doctrine people started
[28:22] falling away especially when he said eat
[28:24] my flesh and drink my blood and over 70
[28:26] disciples left them except for the
[28:28] twelve that stayed with him so it just
[28:30] tells you that the ministry of god is
[28:32] going to get less and less popular
[28:35] only people only come for the miracles
[28:37] but once they receive
[28:38] what they wanted they just leave it and
[28:41] go back to what they were doing
[28:43] and kind of leave the word of god alone
[28:45] yeah especially while brother brown was
[28:46] alive people
[28:48] flocked to his meetings just for the
[28:49] miracles and they would even admit
[28:52] that they just kind of waited through
[28:53] the preaching not really paying
[28:55] attention to the word and they were
[28:57] anxious just to get to the healings only
[28:59] which jesus talked about in matthew 7
[29:01] jesus said many will come to him and say
[29:03] lord lord have we not prophesied have we
[29:05] not spoken tongues have we not cast out
[29:06] devils and jesus say i never knew you ye
[29:09] that work iniquity so we see these
[29:11] people that love the anointing they love
[29:13] the miracles of god but then they choose
[29:15] later to live a life of sin and they do
[29:18] not allow the holy spirit to do more
[29:19] than just heal their bodies they must
[29:21] allow the holy spirit to live in their
[29:23] souls which will also transform their
[29:25] minds in order to give them the mind of
[29:27] christ they can follow christ daily and
[29:30] live for him in every area of their
[29:31] lives
[29:33] if you look at jesus's life he did a lot
[29:35] of teaching every single day and the
[29:37] miracles were just kind of there to draw
[29:39] let people in so he could teach them the
[29:42] word of god the original word of god
[29:44] that's the same thing with brother
[29:45] branagh's ministry was to draw the
[29:47] people in with the miracles but teach
[29:48] them and those who hear the word of god
[29:51] who are really god's children will
[29:52] actually hear the word of god and will
[29:54] believe it because it always goes back
[29:56] to the bible so william branham had a
[29:58] worldwide healing ministry which is
[30:00] undeniable i've met numerous people and
[30:03] thousands of other people have met
[30:05] others who were in brother brown's
[30:06] meetings or knew people in brother
[30:08] brown's meetings that were healed by the
[30:10] supernatural presence of the holy ghost
[30:13] brother ram also spoke with authority of
[30:15] thus saith the lord regarding prophecy
[30:18] as i mentioned earlier but also with
[30:20] doctrine he would tell us certain
[30:22] doctrines were thus saith the lord for
[30:24] example the three persons in the trinity
[30:26] brother brahm said was thus saith the
[30:28] lord that's of the devil god is not
[30:30] three persons so we have more than just
[30:32] a man's opinion now we have the lord
[30:35] telling us that that the lord does not
[30:37] want to be known as three persons he
[30:39] also gave us the evidence for the
[30:41] baptism of the holy ghost with us saith
[30:42] the lord
[30:43] saying it's a life that keeps all the
[30:45] word of god saying i don't care if a
[30:47] person runs shouts dances screams if
[30:51] they deny one word of god and say god's
[30:53] word isn't true or doesn't apply to them
[30:55] they're not born again their soul is not
[30:57] quickened by the word of god he also
[31:00] gave us thus saith the lord on marriage
[31:01] and divorce most churches today
[31:03] unfortunately allow people to marry two
[31:06] or three times well the bible says
[31:08] that's adultery so we see the wisdom of
[31:11] the holy ghost giving brother branham
[31:13] thus saith the lord to give us the right
[31:15] way to conduct our marriages and to be
[31:17] married one time until death do us part
[31:20] so all these proofs work together to
[31:22] show how brother branham had the
[31:23] prophetic ministry but also a pure
[31:25] teaching ministry as well
[31:27] well let's talk about the other side
[31:29] where people are worshiping program or
[31:32] taking it to the extreme thinking he's
[31:33] jesus well there's two sides of it one
[31:36] that don't believe brother brown or
[31:37] there's the other side which people
[31:39] believe that brother brown is jesus or
[31:41] they exalt him out so high that every
[31:43] word he said it does say the lord which
[31:45] is false
[31:46] if you look in the bible some some good
[31:49] examples is elisha when the three
[31:51] children were
[31:53] making fun of him and mocking him that
[31:55] he called
[31:56] an animal to kill them all that wasn't
[31:58] blood of god that was just him but that
[32:00] was god fulfilling his word through the
[32:02] prophet
[32:04] whatever he said would come to pass even
[32:06] though that wasn't the right
[32:07] thing he did same with there's some
[32:09] examples with brother brown where he he
[32:11] failed as a human being too because
[32:13] we're all humans no one's perfect
[32:14] besides jesus christ like brother brown
[32:16] would lie to the irs but then he will go
[32:19] and make that right
[32:20] some examples like that
[32:22] and god honored brother branham's gift
[32:24] just like elisha like brother amen just
[32:26] said there at the beginning of his
[32:28] ministry he was so moved by god
[32:30] that in prayer lines he would say bring
[32:32] me the hardest cases first now later the
[32:35] angel lord rebuked him for that but god
[32:38] still honored his gift to pray for the
[32:40] sick he still healed all the the hardest
[32:43] cases at the beginning and god let it go
[32:45] on for months and months until he
[32:47] corrected him also the same thing
[32:49] happened with moses god told moses to
[32:51] speak to the rock but moses smote the
[32:53] rock and water still came forth and so
[32:56] we see that same idea where god many
[32:58] times will honor a prophet's gift even
[33:00] though they're human and they make
[33:02] mistakes just to honor his prophet
[33:05] there's a major move around the ministry
[33:07] of william branham now where where
[33:09] people are exalting every word brother
[33:10] branham said as thus saith the lord this
[33:13] is actually heresy it's the spirit of
[33:15] idolatry brother random said in numerous
[33:18] cases i'm not infallible brother branham
[33:20] said i make mistakes so we have direct
[33:23] quotes from brother branham saying he's
[33:24] not infallible saying not every word on
[33:26] the tape is thus saith the lord
[33:28] in 1964
[33:30] questions answers part one brother
[33:31] branham said there's mix-ups on the tape
[33:33] so he said these four beautiful words if
[33:35] there's a mix-up look in the bible and
[33:38] that's just what the holy spirit said
[33:39] through jesus he says search the
[33:41] scriptures for in them you think you
[33:42] have eternal life and there they which
[33:45] testify of me
[33:46] that's also one of the saddest things in
[33:49] the message there are people who
[33:51] know more about the quotes of brethren
[33:53] than they know about the bible and
[33:55] that's the really sad part because
[33:56] brother abraham all he did was point
[33:58] back to the scripture back to the
[33:59] scripture so when man when we see people
[34:02] exalting brother brown they're always
[34:04] disputing with quotes and that's where a
[34:06] lot of doctrine issues come from is what
[34:09] are brother brown saying what they're
[34:09] brian brown saying why don't you just go
[34:11] back to the bible and say what did the
[34:12] bible say that would clear a lot of
[34:14] things up with doctrine
[34:16] yeah absolutely we would listen to
[34:18] brother branham and then see what he
[34:20] said and look to see where that's in the
[34:23] bible so we have to verify what the
[34:25] prophet said by the bible because every
[34:27] man has opinions every man make mistakes
[34:30] every man can change his mind but god
[34:32] can never change his mind the bible says
[34:34] for i am the lord thy god and i change
[34:36] not jesus christ is the same yesterday
[34:39] today and forever so we look at it as we
[34:42] have to rightly divide the sermons of
[34:44] brother branham because the sermons of
[34:46] brother branham are not infallible so
[34:48] just like paul told timothy he said
[34:49] rightly divide the word of truth give
[34:52] yourself to the study of the word of god
[34:56] read the word of god and now for us we
[34:58] have a prophet on tape with over
[35:01] 100 sermons
[35:03] so we have to listen to those and then
[35:05] take everything he said back to the word
[35:07] which the bible says the bible says
[35:09] prove all things in first thessalonians
[35:12] 5. the bible says in acts 17 that the
[35:14] bereans searched the word daily to see
[35:17] whether the things paul said were so
[35:19] well the same thing is true for us now
[35:21] we listen to a modern day prophet
[35:22] brother branham and we have to search
[35:24] the scriptures to make sure what he said
[35:26] is in the word of god
[35:32] let's talk about how you heard about the
[35:34] message so wherever jesse how did you
[35:36] hear about this message
[35:37] it was a wonderful time of my life 2001
[35:40] was when i first heard the message now i
[35:42] just got saved about about two years
[35:44] earlier and i was loving the word of god
[35:47] i had left as much worldliness as i
[35:49] possibly could i'd been going to
[35:51] denominational churches different ones
[35:53] trying them off and on i had no idea god
[35:55] had sent a prophet i had no idea there
[35:57] was an end time message like all those
[35:59] scriptures said that we went through at
[36:01] the beginning but to make a long story
[36:03] short my brother simon went to a bible
[36:05] study he was invited to after the
[36:07] attacks of 9 11 rocked the nation and
[36:10] really rocked the world and he happened
[36:12] to go to a bible study that was
[36:14] preaching the revelations god gave to
[36:16] brother branham well simon was on fire
[36:19] he come and he said i know jesse's going
[36:20] to receive it so he came to me on
[36:22] thanksgiving night 2001 and played me a
[36:25] sermon about the two seeds in genesis 3
[36:29] 15 the seed of the serpent and the seed
[36:32] of the woman i was blown away i had
[36:34] never heard a preacher preach like that
[36:36] so that was the starting point
[36:38] of doing bible studies prayer attending
[36:41] services where i learned the revelations
[36:43] and god revealed his word to me that he
[36:45] had originally given to his prophet
[36:47] brother banham and that was 21 years ago
[36:49] and here i am today continuing to grow
[36:52] in the grace and knowledge of the lord
[36:53] still listening to brother branham
[36:55] taking everything he says back to the
[36:56] word of god and also open to receiving
[36:58] any revelation the holy ghost would give
[37:00] me as i study as i pray as i preach as i
[37:04] seek the face of the lord
[37:06] amen how about you how did you come to
[37:08] know the message that god sent for this
[37:09] day it's very similar to yours um i grew
[37:12] up with the cnn church christian
[37:14] missionary alliance big believers in
[37:17] billy graham and follow his teachings
[37:19] and
[37:20] as i grew up the one thing that always
[37:22] got me was why didn't people obey the
[37:24] word of god like i would read it and
[37:27] people would be like oh it's not far a
[37:29] day that was for the old days it doesn't
[37:31] pertain to us that never made sense to
[37:33] me like i believe the bible i thought
[37:35] all christians believe the bible and i
[37:37] grew up with that mentality when like
[37:39] why does why is everyone not taking the
[37:41] bible seriously or why is it why aren't
[37:43] people taking christianity seriously so
[37:46] there's one time
[37:47] around 21 when i was around 21. i was
[37:50] pretty miserable in my life and i went
[37:52] down and i prayed this prayer i said god
[37:54] i know that you're real but where's the
[37:56] god of abraham jacob isaac where are you
[38:00] god why don't i see you
[38:02] and that's when i've met my pastor right
[38:04] now pastor jesse
[38:06] and when i first met him when god led me
[38:08] to go to his church one time i just knew
[38:10] that
[38:11] pastor jesse had god with him there was
[38:14] just something different about his
[38:15] character his personality that man has
[38:18] the holy ghost and that would that is
[38:20] what drew me to this message i'm like
[38:22] there's actually a real christian
[38:24] reliving a real christian life
[38:27] and from that point on i just started
[38:28] coming to his church and that's when i
[38:30] found out about the message and the
[38:32] truth about the bible and it just makes
[38:34] so much sense why people aren't living a
[38:36] christian life and why there's only a
[38:38] small group that lived pure christian
[38:40] lives according to the word of god
[38:43] and that's how i came into this message
[38:44] i remember one thing about your
[38:46] testimony brother that proves brother
[38:47] amen was a foreknown child of god do you
[38:51] want to tell about how you would attend
[38:53] church when you were younger all by
[38:54] yourself
[38:55] yes so when i was younger my parents
[38:57] divorced which a lot of families are
[38:59] like that which is sad so
[39:01] i always wanted to go to church
[39:04] and there'd be so many times where my
[39:06] entire family did not go to church and i
[39:09] was the only one and i'd be walking
[39:10] through snow rain just to go to church
[39:13] and this was a denominational church i
[39:15] just loved god and just loved to be
[39:17] around i love fellowshipping with people
[39:19] and just being around god and talking
[39:21] about god and that's what drove me
[39:24] to doing that and i was using all my
[39:26] passion and drive for the cma church and
[39:28] when we moved down to akron it was the
[39:30] same thing same passion but i figured i
[39:33] found out that that was the right
[39:35] passion but you're using it the wrong
[39:36] way for not a church that loves god but
[39:39] now i found a church that loves god and
[39:41] now i can give my whole heart to it
[39:43] knowing that they love god the same
[39:45] i love that story because it shows
[39:47] that a real love for god god will
[39:49] satisfy that love sounds like brother
[39:51] amen you had this desire this deep call
[39:53] for god right and so if you had a deep
[39:55] call for god like the book of psalms
[39:57] says there had to be a god to respond
[39:59] that's right
[40:00] i have a similar story like after i got
[40:03] saved around the year 2000 or so before
[40:05] i came to this message
[40:07] i was into the word as much as i could
[40:10] the church that i went to just kind of
[40:12] taught on four themes they would cycle
[40:14] through four themes every year and after
[40:16] year or two i kind of got fed up with
[40:18] that and i started reaching out for more
[40:20] revelation i got into the baptist
[40:21] preacher john piper and other preachers
[40:24] and i was just eating it up and i and i
[40:26] always knew there had to be more truth
[40:28] one example was i was reading matthew 7
[40:30] which we mentioned earlier
[40:32] where jesus tells people that had done
[40:34] miracles that they would not inherit the
[40:36] kingdom of god and he said depart from
[40:38] me you workers of iniquity i never knew
[40:41] you and this honestly
[40:43] was so difficult for me to understand i
[40:45] struggle with this how could god
[40:47] send these people to hell that did
[40:50] miracles well i struggled with that for
[40:52] a long time
[40:53] until the ministry of william branham
[40:55] came and he preached a sermon called the
[40:56] anointed ones of the end time
[40:58] in 1965 and i still remember listening
[41:01] to that sermon that sermon showed how
[41:03] people can take the anointing of the
[41:05] holy spirit on the outer courts of their
[41:07] body
[41:08] meaning the body and the mind the human
[41:10] spirit but yet reject it in the soul
[41:13] and in their souls love sin
[41:15] and reject salvation and ultimately be
[41:18] lost this is another example like
[41:21] our brother amen who had a deep call for
[41:23] god why did deep call to understand the
[41:24] mysteries of god i had a deep call to
[41:27] hunger and thirst for more of god so
[41:29] there had to be a deep to respond and
[41:30] god gave me that response through the
[41:32] ministry of william branham and gave us
[41:35] thus saith the lord on the scripture
[41:37] that's a really good point especially
[41:39] with churches that have people that look
[41:41] really holy and look like they serve god
[41:43] but yet they live even lives so when
[41:46] that god gets to operate their gift
[41:48] within them but yet they'll still be
[41:50] lost
[41:51] and if you look in the bible look at
[41:52] balaam he had the gift to prophesy but
[41:54] yet he wanted he told israel to commit
[41:56] for vacation
[41:57] you know saying that god will use you in
[42:00] the right time and season but doesn't
[42:01] mean that you're his that's exactly
[42:03] right the bible says gifts and callings
[42:05] of god are without repentance so balaam
[42:07] had this gift to prophesy and his
[42:09] prophecies were correct he prophesied of
[42:12] the star that would rise out of jacob
[42:13] the star the wise men would use to find
[42:16] the infant christ there in jerusalem but
[42:19] then later we find out he rejects the
[42:21] word of the lord he denies god's own
[42:24] word and fights against the people of
[42:26] god and then ii peter 2 says that his
[42:29] soul is lost and he is in the midst of
[42:32] darkness forever so just because someone
[42:34] has a gift or just because someone has
[42:36] supernatural experiences doesn't mean
[42:38] they're saved we know they're saved when
[42:40] they repent of their sins they've been
[42:42] baptized in the name of lord jesus
[42:44] christ and they're serving god but they
[42:46] must go on to sanctification and
[42:47] ultimately the baptism of the holy ghost
[42:50] just want to clarify that there are
[42:52] christians that are saved who are not in
[42:55] this message that will still be saved at
[42:58] the end of the world at the great jones
[43:00] white judgment and it goes back to the
[43:02] two types of christians the wise virgin
[43:04] and the foolish virgin i know that there
[43:06] are a lot of foolish virgins who don't
[43:08] have the holy ghost who are in a lot of
[43:10] denominations but yet they have
[43:12] salvation
[43:13] and salvation is a free gift the
[43:15] difference between
[43:17] a wise virgin and a foolish virgin is
[43:19] they both have salvation but the wise
[43:21] virgin they're able to bear fruit and
[43:24] they have the holy ghost
[43:25] and that goes back to jesus's parable
[43:27] the four grounds
[43:28] only the final ground had fruit that was
[43:31] the what kind of heart was that jesus
[43:32] said it's a good and honest heart that
[43:35] actually bears fruit the third kind of
[43:37] ground was the thorny ground and that's
[43:39] where we would see the foolish virgin
[43:41] where cares of the world crop up or grow
[43:43] up in their lives they're not able to
[43:45] bring forth real fruit of the holy ghost
[43:47] like real holy ghost long-suffering real
[43:49] holy ghost love for all the word of god
[43:52] you know like there's arguments in their
[43:53] churches there's division their churches
[43:55] but a real church that's baptized with
[43:57] the holy ghost will have the fruit of
[43:58] love they'll have struggles but they'll
[44:00] work through it we can learn from all of
[44:02] jesus teaching to help us understand the
[44:05] state of christianity right now and we
[44:07] can find ourselves in the wise virgin
[44:09] group and recognize at the same time
[44:11] though there's foolish virgins and they
[44:13] are virgins they're spiritually pure to
[44:16] god's word but they haven't gone all the
[44:18] way they haven't redeemed their time as
[44:20] paul said paul said the wise walk
[44:22] circumspectly and redeem their time and
[44:25] are sure they're born again of the holy
[44:27] ghost but the foolish haven't yet done
[44:29] that but surely they'll be saved
[44:36] um to review this lesson
[44:38] what is the message is revealing the
[44:40] word of god restoring it back to the
[44:42] original word
[44:43] and getting a bride ready for a rapture
[44:46] and we all know that jesus has a bride
[44:48] and we are his bride which is the bride
[44:50] of christ we really appreciate you
