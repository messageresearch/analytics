[0:00] I Know Thy works and the last to be more
[0:03] than the
[0:04] first this is certainly remarkable as
[0:07] the darkness of the age increased as the
[0:09] honor role of the martyrs grew lengthier
[0:11] day by day they worked all the harder
[0:13] they served all the more and their faith
[0:16] increased how tragic it was that in the
[0:19] Ephesian age love waned and truly
[0:22] nothing is said of the increased labor
[0:24] of love in the other ages but in this
[0:27] age and the darkest of all ages they
[0:28] served him even more what a lesson that
[0:32] is there is no ceasing of this gracious
[0:35] service of Love unto the Lord but rather
[0:37] an increasing of it that is the secret
[0:40] let the enemy attempt to thwart our
[0:42] service to the Lord our reply is
[0:44] increased service when the faint are
[0:47] crying in fear that is the time to shout
[0:49] the
[0:52] Victory and um now if we could just stop
[0:56] thise let me get let so you be sure to
[0:58] see this that that's kind of might be a
[0:59] little little puzzling to you but let's
[1:01] get that over here watch and see if it
[1:04] isn't a a a laboring church you see and
[1:07] to the angel of the Church of
[1:10] thara write these things sayth the Son
[1:13] of God
[1:15] who his eyes are like the flames of fire
[1:19] and his feet are like fine brass I Know
[1:22] Thy
[1:24] Works see becoming all works now see
[1:28] because that's the the one was riding
[1:29] with
[1:30] and uh charity and service see it's all
[1:34] just and faith and patience and thy
[1:39] works again twice thy works and the last
[1:44] to be more than the first see that shows
[1:47] that the thyra age after the Antichrist
[1:51] got settled down and come into the th
[1:54] age the little church could do nothing
[1:58] but just just simply labor and another
[2:02] thing the ox is a also is a beast of
[2:09] sacrifice see they give their lives just
[2:13] as freely as they could give them in the
[2:15] Dark Ages a thousand years there the
[2:17] Catholicism controlled the world and
[2:20] they just went right in yes or no they
[2:23] didn't mind
[2:24] Dy if it was death that's all right amen
[2:28] it wouldn't died anyhow amen why the
[2:31] very Spirit of the
[2:37] age let me tell you about a man one time
[2:40] before closing there was a man named
[2:43] David and when the Ark of God had been
[2:46] down in the Philistine land and had come
[2:48] across pull by Ark old oxes are pulling
[2:52] them when David saw that Ark coming he
[2:55] had a little gown on him he run out
[2:57] there and kicked his feet in the air and
[2:59] jumped around and screamed and jumped
[3:02] and danced and jumped and danced and him
[3:04] the king of
[3:08] Israel and his wife looked out of a
[3:11] window and saw him acting so strange she
[3:14] despised him why she must have said the
[3:17] idiot look at him out there the way he's
[3:19] acting throwing his feet up in the air
[3:21] and jumping around and acting like that
[3:24] why he must be crazy and that night one
[3:27] come in she said in words like this why
[3:29] you embarrass me why you the king my
[3:32] husband out there doing like that acting
[3:35] like that David said tomorrow I'll do
[3:37] better than that yes sir he said don't
[3:41] you know I was dancing unto the
[3:47] Lord he crossed over he was in the land
[3:50] of the promise he' lost all self Styles
[3:55] and buck of the world he was so happy to
[3:59] know
[4:00] that the ark was coming into his own
[4:03] City oh I tell you some people's afraid
[4:07] to receive the Holy Ghost afraid that
[4:09] they might speak with tongues they're
[4:11] afraid that somebody would say now he's
[4:13] one of them tongues guys they're afraid
[4:16] to come to the church to be baptized in
[4:18] the name of Jesus Christ because they're
[4:20] ashamed of
[4:22] it
[4:25] oh somebody said i' have to recall my
[4:28] tapes because I preached to been
[4:30] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ I
[4:32] ain't recalling him I'm making more amen
[4:34] that's
[4:36] right making more that is the Bible if
[4:40] they don't like what we did yesterday
[4:42] just watch what we're going to do
[4:43] tomorrow that's the thing to
[4:45] do just keep on going there's no end to
[4:48] it because it is of the lord it's God
[4:53] you know what God did God looked down
[4:56] out of the heaven and said David you're
[4:57] a man after my own heart
[5:01] amen David wasn't
[5:03] ashamed he was a servant of the Lord he
[5:07] loved the Lord and he was so happy so
[5:10] Overjoyed though he didn't think about
[5:13] human
[5:16] prge and we're happy to have all of you
[5:19] with us through the day and the times
[5:22] when we when if you're around here in
[5:25] the city anywhere near come out we want
[5:28] to assemble and gather our ourselves
[5:30] together we want to sit under the
[5:32] teaching of our brother here brother
[5:35] naville and um and partake of the things
[5:38] that's of God as he finds them from God
[5:41] he gives them out and we want to learn
[5:44] of God and seeing the day approaching we
[5:47] must assemble ourselves more of together
[5:51] we must love in our hearts to come to
[5:54] church if we don't love church love God
[5:58] coming together what we call called
[5:59] church is coming together to
[6:02] worship if we love Christ we worship
[6:06] could you imagine a man saying he loved
[6:07] his wife and he hadn't seen her for a
[6:09] long time passed right by and say well
[6:11] I'll see her some other time see that
[6:13] isn't wife saying she loves her husband
[6:16] or a parent saying they love their child
[6:19] well it it shows see and I think our
[6:21] Expressions that we should constantly
[6:24] long to be in worship anywhere to
[6:26] Worship the Lord when we come together
[6:28] to worship Him worship him at home
[6:30] worship him while we're driving our cars
[6:33] wherever we are Worship the Lord just
[6:36] pray the Bible said let everything that
[6:38] has breath praise the Lord and then he
[6:41] said praise ye the Lord even if you
[6:43] haven't got any breath still praise the
[6:45] Lord see pra every he has breath praise
[6:48] the Lord and then praise you the Lord I
[6:49] think Psalms 100 100
[6:53] psalm
