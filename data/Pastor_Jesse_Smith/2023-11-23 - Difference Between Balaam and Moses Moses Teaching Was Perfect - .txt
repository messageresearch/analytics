TRANSCRIPT
========================================
what was the difference the teaching of Moses is perfect Moses a man sent from God with the word of God and on his journey taken Israel into the promised land strictly with the Commandment of God he met another Prophet another anointed one that had a genuine anointing of the holy spirit that was upon Moses right he was a prophet the Holy Spirit was upon this man his name was balum we're all acquainted with him well the very things the same the things the things that the man said is still taking place about 2,800 years ago th like a unicorn old Israel who whoever blesses you will be blessed whoever curses you will be cursed your strength Mighty how righteous are their tents oh Jacob see he couldn't help himself he come there purposing in his heart to curse the people oh you false teachers listen these tapes all these years and seeing God confirm exactly what he said and you said in your study I know it's a truth and because of your denominational differences you dispute them and tell your people they're not so War unto you your time is close at hand amen bam Anointed with the same spirit that was up on Moses what was the difference the teaching of Moses was perfect the Bible said here in second Peter that it was a teaching of balum that Israel received that God never did forgive unpardonable sin not a one of them got saved though they had come out under the blessings of God and seen the hand of God moving by this Mighty prophet and seen exactly Vindicated by God and because another Prophet come in with a teaching contrary and disputed with Moses and tried to prove to the people that Moses was wrong and D Kora many of them agreed with him and taught the children of Israel to commit fornications to go after his organization that we're all the same where we Methodist Baptist Presbyterian of Pentecostals and what more we're all the same we're not the same you are a separated people holy unto the Lord dedicated to the word and the spirit of God to bear fruit of his promise of this day and you're not of them I know that's awful strong but that's the truth just the same dedicated to a service in this last days come out from amongst us now the teaching of balum not the prophecy of balum that was all right that was God how many believes that amen the prophecy of bam was exactly right because he couldn't speak nothing else the anointing of God wouldn't speak nothing else and God Vindicated it by proving it was the truth but it was the teaching of bam now compare that Matthew 24:24 on anointed ones but their teaching is false the trinities and all things like that wrong Antichrist I hope your feelings don't get hurt and don't turn that that phones off and don't get up and go out just sit still and let's see if the Holy Spirit won't reveal it to us and prove it to us say but that just whatever you believe is sit still listen ask God to open your heart then you'll find out whether you're a bra or thistle or wherever you're standing
