podcast we hope you enjoy it so now we'll begin our first podcast called what is the message [Music] god bless you and welcome to the defending the message podcast i'm your co-host pastor jesse smith and here's our other co-host um i'm amen and nice to meet you guys and glad to be here it's a real blessing to start a podcast our desire is to defend jesus christ's message for this day along with his messenger for the day as well so this first initial topic will be about what is the message so we'll start with brother amen and we'll let him share what he feels the message is to him the message is god's word being revealed to the saints the ones that will believe it everything in the bible and it's much more than jesus accept jesus in your heart it's a lot more than that it's preparing god's people for a rapture and to restore the word of god that's what i feel the message is amen that's beautiful i would agree and uh so through this podcast we're gonna point to numerous scriptures because we want to start with the bible first yes definitely like brother amen and i were talking uh and we agree that the bible is the absolute i really like how some scriptures say you know every let god's word be the truth and every man be a liar you know a lot of people have a lot of different opinions different doctrines different teachings you know it's like there's so much out there you don't know who to believe and that's why you need the bible to be a filter take everything back to word of god what does the bible say if you have a man opinion and another man's opinion you're gonna believe you wanna believe the word of god absolutely yeah just like jesus said heaven earth shall pass away but my words will never pass away that's right let's share some scriptures about god's word being the absolute okay i have one from numbers 23 19 god is not a man that he should lie neither the son of a man that he said repent half he said and ha sally not do it or have he spoke and certainly not make it good it just shows that god whatever god says is going to come to pass it's like keeping the promises to god you know it's going to come to pass and it's due time and due season but it's never going to fail or come back empty yeah the bible is certainly our absolute at our church as it is at many churches i'm thinking of romans 3 4 where paul said god forbid yea let god be true but every man a liar so we know men are saved right men and women are both saved and this scripture is not saying that men and women always lie but this scripture is emphasizing that god can never lie god can never deceive and so the only one who can be the absolute the ultimate authority with no mistakes no lies no deception is god himself and then john chapter 1 says in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the scripture says the word was made flesh and dwelt among us so we see how jesus christ is the word and the bible is his revelation of himself to us well let's talk a little bit about the king james version and why we believe the only king james version yeah certainly we'll probably do a whole another video on the king james itself but just as a short summary i think i listed at least seven reasons why i use the king james bible and we believe it is the most reliable translation known to man today so just briefly the king james has a supernatural origin it was an answer of prayer as william tyndale was martyred and god heard his prayer and gave us an english translation second the king james version is an accurate word for word translation every word of god is pure and other translations are thought for thought but they could be the wrong thought third other versions of the bible delete portions of the king james version and make changes but you cannot add or take away one word of god fourth the language gives greater understanding every word is important in the king james and the translators gave us those words to understand it better if you take those away the bible loses its meaning fifth mighty men of god use the king james like spurgeon jonathan edwards george whitfield other revivalists even william branham god's prophet for this day my own mother was healed of cancer by quoting the king james version so i've seen it do great miracles as well sixth the pure words of the king james created the most holy civilization in history which is the united states of america this is because the king james is the incorruptible seed word of god so america was built upon the king james version and seventh the king james has no copyright so it's free in public domain other bible translations are sometimes after your money yes uh here's a good example that i i personally really like i remember when i had a dream where i met jesus and i was buying on before him and he's like because you've done this i'm gonna give you the morning star and i remember you went and you preached on the different bible translations and i believe it was the niv that called satan the morning star or lucifer the morning star which was an nfp translation i'm like that's not right if you look in revelations jesus said i'll give you the morning star if you overcome so jesus doesn't say i'm going to give you lucifer you overcome so that definitely is a bible translation error and that's why we stick to the king james version because it doesn't call lucifer the morning star jesus christ is only the morning star going back to your morning star example brother amen you're right modern bible versions cause much confusion like the example you gave of isaiah 14 12 which calls satan lucifer son of the morning in the king james the king james is correct because it's the original but in the niv lucifer is taken out and he's called simply morning star this causes confusion because lucifer's name is deleted in the niv and satan now takes the title morning star which was a title for jesus in the king james from revelation 22 16 where jesus said i am the morning star it's plain to see that nivea is attempting to make lucifer equal to jesus in order to ultimately steal worship from christ and to go along with that the niv also deletes the latter portion of mark chapter 16 where it talks about these signs shall follow them that believe it also deletes first john 5 7 about the father the word and the holy ghost these three are one it doesn't say these are three different persons so there's two more good examples to go along with your example of course we are not scholars but the main point in the bible version debate is that if any version takes away from the king james it is deleting god's pure words and then should be avoided so we don't need to be scholars in order to be right on this subject because we just need to compare the bible versions and see which ones take away from the king james and if they do avoid them and this has been the case with every bible version i've compared to date every modern version takes away god's pure words that teaches sound doctrine in the king james version so the next part is what is the message and we believe it's in three parts god revealing the word god restoring the word back to the original and rapturing his bride or getting his bride ready for a rapture because everyone knows you know we're at the end of the world you can just look around and you see all everything's falling apart i mean even all the people like in the media the rich people everyone they all know it's the end of the world and you can already see satan already building his kingdom and while he's building his kingdom god's building his but he's keeping it secret from everyone the rest of the world that's right that's right the bible says the secret things belong to the lord that's exactly right i have to look up the scripture reference but that's deuteronomy 29 verse 29 the secret things belong unto the lord our god but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children forever that we may do all the words of this law and that goes with how jesus and paul both said jesus is coming we'll be like a thief in the night it'll be a secret coming of jesus christ the husband to rapture away his bride yes if you look in the world today it's not really well known what the message is or a lot of people don't know what the message is or never heard of it because it's really secret and if you're looking for god's truth he'll bring you into it if you desire to serve god and to know the truth of everything that's exactly right and the reason it is secret is because jesus said he was going to hide it from the eyes of the wise and prude it but reveal it unto babes such as would learn so the only reason it's secret is because the denominations or the independents or the major churches don't want to hear it they've suppressed it and they're actually keeping it away from their people but god's word will never return void all those that want to believe the truth of god's word all those that want to be in the rapture want to be filled with the holy ghost god will direct his word to them amen well let's go to the first one is revealing the word of god at the really first scripture that comes to mind is revelation 1 1-3 uh let me read it real quick the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to sow unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signify it by his angels unto his servant john who bear record of the word of god and the testimony of jesus christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep these things which are written therein for the time is at hand if you look at revelation we're living in that time right now and this scripture really pertains to us now even though it's written 2000 years ago it's pertaining to us because we're living these prophecies that are coming to pass and this is god revealing the word and showing us things to come absolutely that's a beautiful portion of scripture because we're blessed to read revelation and hear it and then as we'll move on eventually we'll show revelation 10 7 says the mystery of god has to be finished so we have to understand the book of revelation where we're not guessing at the major themes and the major prophecies but the holy spirit has showed them to us because it's prophecy he has to finish the mystery and he's of course going to share those mysteries with his people with his church i have another good scripture john 16 13 it says how be it when he the spirit of truth has come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatever he shall hear that he shall speak and he will show you the things to come you know saying that if you have the holy ghost you're going to know and see the things that are going to come to pass and talking about revelation of the word of god revealing the word of god to you and opening your eyes to what's happening absolutely and that kind of goes how jesus said in matthew 24. you know before his second coming we would hear about wars and rumors of wars and there'd be pestilences but these are the beginning of birth pains or sorrows and so because jesus foretold these things now we can be prepared for things like more viruses or we can be prepared to handle rumors about russia and the united states having wars all these things because he's foretold us these things and he said i'm gonna jesus also said i'm gonna leave you my peace so we don't have to worry about these things we have to fret he's foretold us the future and we also know about the mark of the beast that's to come and how the true church will not accept the mark of the beast the true church will actually be spared from the pouring out or the issuing out of the mark of the beast because jesus said i'm going to keep you from that hour okay with the next point we're talking about is restoring the word of god which is a really big topic a lot of churches teach about things that are man-made a big one would be the beginning of adam and eve with eve eating a fruit which is not the case according to the bible and that's a big false teaching so god came back to restore the original word and there's a um the bible verse in joel 2 25 says and i will restore to you the years that the locusts have eaten they can't get warm the caterpillar and the palmer worm my great army which i sent among you that's sowing god's restoring the word of god that's a great point and then you also combine that with acts 3 verse 20 and 21 where peter says jesus remains in heaven until the restitution of all things so there's a restoration that has to take place at the end like brother amen said revelation takes place and now restoration has to take place as well god has to reveal his word and that restores our hearts yes malachi 4 5 6 behold i will send you elijah the prophet before the coming and great and dreadful day of the lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers lest thy cometh smite the earth with a curse and as god said he'll send elijah before the coming of the great and dreadful dead lord that that obviously is the tribulation there's nothing else that's more dreadful than the tribulation and since we're living in this time god has to send elijah and people the misconception is people think that the prophets are done or there's no more prophets ever since jesus came but that's not the case because paul was a prophet and after paul there were other more prophets that came we'll show we'll still that more in the future absolutely agabus in the book of acts and then you had john was a prophet who you know wrote the book of revelation so yeah we should dedicate a whole podcast just go showing how profits were after jesus and we've had profits throughout the last 2000 years we might call some major we might call some minor but the fact is the profit office has never left although many churches do away with it it's still a genuine office of god i would add to that as well matthew 17 verse 11 jesus said elias or the spirit of elijah truly shall first come and restore all things here's another scripture to go along with joel 2 acts 3 matthew 17 says elijah's going to restore all things so anyone who looks at just the church broad with over 30 000 denominations you'd look at it and think not every church looks like the book of acts church how could god allow this well we know god has allowed every man their free choice and they've made choices to leave the word of god but we have a promise that god is going to restore the true church at the end times so that's what we believe we're a part of we're not perfect but we look at our lives and we see the holy ghost moving in our lives and we see our lives in ministry closely matching the book of acts and that's what we're desiring to do to let the holy spirit restore our hearts and our teachings back to the book of acts this is a scripture where god says god takes the man but not his spirit so in that particular case elijah's spirit is upon some of the saints of old and even to now if you look in the scripture there elijah comes five times which is elijah the first time elisha who had a double portion of elijah he had john the baptist and then the fourth one who believed his brother branham in this end time and then the last one would be elijah again with the two prophets in the book of revelation when he comes back to the jews and the rapture one that's just the one that gets people's attention the most because that's the one thing that people don't want to miss is the rapture and with the rapture there's a lot of things in it that people don't see or understand but then they'll think they'll make the rapture which is very scary but also you have to go over god's blueprint in order to make it and that's why we have the word of god to reveal these things so that we're ready for the rapture and there's a there's a good rapture scripture which is the parable the 10 virgins five wives five foolish showing that there's two types of christians which is a really good topic to talk about there are two types of christians the foolish and the wise and they're both virgin unto the lord both looking for the coming of the lord but only five of them have the holy ghost who were ready for the coming of the lord and that's when we look at it the five foolish virgins are the ones who i believe are in denominations who love god and are pure to god but they can't live fully the word of god because they don't understand it or because they never taught it yeah that's the scripture of matthew 25 verse 1 to 13. and there's two groups there's a wise foolish the wise had oil and oil according to zechariah chapter four is the holy ghost not by might not by power but by my spirit saith the lord so there's two groups of christians one have the baptism the holy ghost and the others don't oh to go along with that there's also a shout or cry that the bridegroom is coming and so that's what has happened in this day that's what the message is today a shout has gone forth behold the bridegroom cometh behold the rapture is coming behold jesus christ is returning and if you go to revelation 19 it says his wife hath made herself ready so that's part of the message that we're talking about today is the bride of christ making herself ready i think a big misconception with the whole how the world views christianity is they lump christianity into one big group thinking everyone's oh they all love jesus but they all treat everyone kind of bad because some christians do it and that's a big misconception like the catholics they don't represent the whole christianity or the protestants you know there's different groups within christianity they don't represent the pure word of god and the prayer word of god only comes to those who receive the prophet and the teachings of it beautiful thought brother like jesus said jesus breaks up christians into two groups wise and foolish and then you have as jesus taught in the parable of the four grounds then you have another group who are impersonating christianity those are called the workers of iniquity those are the ones like judas is scared who hang around for a while but then sell out the gospel at the end of course in this group you'd have modern day false prophets like we could name many of them on youtube or on christian television networks where they are lying false prophets well they're another group as well so jesus gives us the divisions you have the wise holy ghost filled you have the foolish that are pure to the word of god they're virgin to the word of god but they don't have the baptism of the holy ghost and then you have another group that jesus calls also tares and they live off the anointing of the holy spirit they do miracles signs and wonders but in their teaching they deny him and are ultimately lost as false prophets that's a really good scripture you bring up with the parable of the four kinds of grounds with just the four different kinds of people that live here there's also one in revelation where jesus said he that is holy then be holy still he that's righteous let it be righteous though he is that filthy let me filthy still so also supports that there are different types of christians and different types of people here on earth so the rapture is jesus secretly and suddenly snatching away his holy ghost phil bride off the earth as the last climatic culminating event before the tribulation period yeah that says in revelation 3 10 because thou has kept the word of my patience i will also keep thee from the our temptation which shall come upon the earth the world for them to try them that dwell upon the earth i've listened to a lot of people who talk about having dreams about the rapture but sometimes it might be deceiving i would say because jesus said many who have a call but only few are chosen and many people have dreams about the rapture but look at their lives they don't live here they don't live holy they don't obey the word and yet they have dreams that they see the rapture oh they're gonna make it god's calling them that they can make it and they can be part of it or just because you have those dreams and you think you'll make it doesn't mean you'll you'll be called to partake in the rapture it's just there to show you that hey you have to get ready for this coming of the lord absolutely and that goes along with what revelation 19 said the bride makes herself ready and that would be a life that is led by every word of god like jesus said in matthew chapter 4 he said man does not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of god so people all around the world feel the pull that the rapture is going to happen so they're dreaming about it there they're talking about it all the time but just having dreams or talking about it doesn't prepare you for the rapture it takes you submitting to the holy ghost in your life where you're saved you're sanctified and you're filled with the holy spirit and if you do that then the bible says in first john all those who have this hope of seeing jesus at his second coming purify themselves yep and that's the one way to make the rapture is getting the baptism of the holy ghost that is the only way to make it two major scriptures talk about the rapture first corinthians 15 and then also first thessalonians chapter four here let me read um first thessalonians 4 14-17 for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so them also would sleep in jesus will god bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that which we are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with the south and with a voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air so shall we ever be with the lord and we believe that the shout already happened with brother branham preparing the bride and getting them waking them up and preparing them for the lord and the voice has not happened yet which is the resurrection of the saints and the trump which is the media we haven't seen that yet which is the rapture and paul's scriptures there coincide with the words he wrote to the corinthians in first corinthians 15 51-52 behold i show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptable and we shall be changed so notice it mentions the last trump like brother amen just read shout voice trump so that's the order and that's the hope of the church to be ready for this moment because it's a secret snatching away of christ's bride off the earth before the awful tribulation period i just want to clarify something that the word rapture is not in the bible but the definition of the word rapture is supported through the bible but if you look at the word trinity it is not the same definition and you can't use that in the bible because there's no such thing as a three gods in one i agree the difference between the rapture and the trinity is that the definition of the rapture is in the bible but the definition of the godhead is not you never see god saying i'm three persons or jesus saying i'm a second separate co-equal person then the father and the holy ghost there's no doubt a great mysterious element to the godhead but jesus clearly said the father is greater than i so right there just that one verse dispels all the trinity dogma that says they're co-equal co-powerful co-eternal persons because jesus said the father is greater than i god is only one person jesus of nazareth was god's image for god is invisible and never has been nor ever will be seen jesus of nazareth was both fully human and fully god and the fully god part of jesus was greater than the human part of jesus which is why jesus said the father is greater than i the father dwelt in jesus the son and the father dwelling in jesus made jesus supreme deity one person not three persons okay so let's talk about this um we have i know we have a lot of different beliefs or doctrines which support the bible so where are we getting all this from so we believe that we got it from william branham we believe is the son of angel so if you look at revelations 10 7 it says but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel which he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he have declared to unto his servants the prophets saying that god sent elijah which is the son of angel who is going to restore the original word which is what we believe is there's only one god not three gods there's a lot of more things in the doctrines that we believe in but it's all supported by scripture and we all got this from our prophet brother brown william brandon yeah brother branham was born around 1909 and died in 1965 had a worldwide amazing supernatural healing ministry god progressed his ministry as he went along and by the end of his ministry he was finishing the mystery of god in other words fulfilling revelation 10 7. throughout his whole ministry though he was doing prophetic ministry which would fulfill luke 17 30. so brother amen will read luke 17 30. even thus shall be in the day when the son of man is revealed so jesus talks about his second coming as being a son of man coming and son of man always represents a prophet see ezekiel ezekiel was called son of man scores of times so jesus said before i come the second time it'll be a son of man ministry and so brother branham had a prophetic ministry he foretold numerous things in the name of the lord that came to pass i have a video about it on my youtube channel called three prophecies of brother branham and then there's numerous people i've met where brother branham told them the future and it came to pass such as with florence humes who was healed of tuberculosis in the 1950s and lived to about 2010 and she was told the future by brother branham in the name of the lord jesus and it came to pass there's a lot of videos of preachers who are who love the ministry of bible brown but are against this doctrine and they've a lot of people don't understand that the things he preached actually come back to the bible and because their beliefs don't agree with his doctrine or the doctrines from the bible they are against him and say he's a false preacher and they only enjoy the healing miracles and you look at that that types jesus christ too because jesus did a lot of miracles a lot of healings but then when he preached the doctrine people started falling away especially when he said eat my flesh and drink my blood and over 70 disciples left them except for the twelve that stayed with him so it just tells you that the ministry of god is going to get less and less popular only people only come for the miracles but once they receive what they wanted they just leave it and go back to what they were doing and kind of leave the word of god alone yeah especially while brother brown was alive people flocked to his meetings just for the miracles and they would even admit that they just kind of waited through the preaching not really paying attention to the word and they were anxious just to get to the healings only which jesus talked about in matthew 7 jesus said many will come to him and say lord lord have we not prophesied have we not spoken tongues have we not cast out devils and jesus say i never knew you ye that work iniquity so we see these people that love the anointing they love the miracles of god but then they choose later to live a life of sin and they do not allow the holy spirit to do more than just heal their bodies they must allow the holy spirit to live in their souls which will also transform their minds in order to give them the mind of christ they can follow christ daily and live for him in every area of their lives if you look at jesus's life he did a lot of teaching every single day and the miracles were just kind of there to draw let people in so he could teach them the word of god the original word of god that's the same thing with brother branagh's ministry was to draw the people in with the miracles but teach them and those who hear the word of god who are really god's children will actually hear the word of god and will believe it because it always goes back to the bible so william branham had a worldwide healing ministry which is undeniable i've met numerous people and thousands of other people have met others who were in brother brown's meetings or knew people in brother brown's meetings that were healed by the supernatural presence of the holy ghost brother ram also spoke with authority of thus saith the lord regarding prophecy as i mentioned earlier but also with doctrine he would tell us certain doctrines were thus saith the lord for example the three persons in the trinity brother brahm said was thus saith the lord that's of the devil god is not three persons so we have more than just a man's opinion now we have the lord telling us that that the lord does not want to be known as three persons he also gave us the evidence for the baptism of the holy ghost with us saith the lord saying it's a life that keeps all the word of god saying i don't care if a person runs shouts dances screams if they deny one word of god and say god's word isn't true or doesn't apply to them they're not born again their soul is not quickened by the word of god he also gave us thus saith the lord on marriage and divorce most churches today unfortunately allow people to marry two or three times well the bible says that's adultery so we see the wisdom of the holy ghost giving brother branham thus saith the lord to give us the right way to conduct our marriages and to be married one time until death do us part so all these proofs work together to show how brother branham had the prophetic ministry but also a pure teaching ministry as well well let's talk about the other side where people are worshiping program or taking it to the extreme thinking he's jesus well there's two sides of it one that don't believe brother brown or there's the other side which people believe that brother brown is jesus or they exalt him out so high that every word he said it does say the lord which is false if you look in the bible some some good examples is elisha when the three children were making fun of him and mocking him that he called an animal to kill them all that wasn't blood of god that was just him but that was god fulfilling his word through the prophet whatever he said would come to pass even though that wasn't the right thing he did same with there's some examples with brother brown where he he failed as a human being too because we're all humans no one's perfect besides jesus christ like brother brown would lie to the irs but then he will go and make that right some examples like that and god honored brother branham's gift just like elisha like brother amen just said there at the beginning of his ministry he was so moved by god that in prayer lines he would say bring me the hardest cases first now later the angel lord rebuked him for that but god still honored his gift to pray for the sick he still healed all the the hardest cases at the beginning and god let it go on for months and months until he corrected him also the same thing happened with moses god told moses to speak to the rock but moses smote the rock and water still came forth and so we see that same idea where god many times will honor a prophet's gift even though they're human and they make mistakes just to honor his prophet there's a major move around the ministry of william branham now where where people are exalting every word brother branham said as thus saith the lord this is actually heresy it's the spirit of idolatry brother random said in numerous cases i'm not infallible brother branham said i make mistakes so we have direct quotes from brother branham saying he's not infallible saying not every word on the tape is thus saith the lord in 1964 questions answers part one brother branham said there's mix-ups on the tape so he said these four beautiful words if there's a mix-up look in the bible and that's just what the holy spirit said through jesus he says search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and there they which testify of me that's also one of the saddest things in the message there are people who know more about the quotes of brethren than they know about the bible and that's the really sad part because brother abraham all he did was point back to the scripture back to the scripture so when man when we see people exalting brother brown they're always disputing with quotes and that's where a lot of doctrine issues come from is what are brother brown saying what they're brian brown saying why don't you just go back to the bible and say what did the bible say that would clear a lot of things up with doctrine yeah absolutely we would listen to brother branham and then see what he said and look to see where that's in the bible so we have to verify what the prophet said by the bible because every man has opinions every man make mistakes every man can change his mind but god can never change his mind the bible says for i am the lord thy god and i change not jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever so we look at it as we have to rightly divide the sermons of brother branham because the sermons of brother branham are not infallible so just like paul told timothy he said rightly divide the word of truth give yourself to the study of the word of god read the word of god and now for us we have a prophet on tape with over 100 sermons so we have to listen to those and then take everything he said back to the word which the bible says the bible says prove all things in first thessalonians 5. the bible says in acts 17 that the bereans searched the word daily to see whether the things paul said were so well the same thing is true for us now we listen to a modern day prophet brother branham and we have to search the scriptures to make sure what he said is in the word of god let's talk about how you heard about the message so wherever jesse how did you hear about this message it was a wonderful time of my life 2001 was when i first heard the message now i just got saved about about two years earlier and i was loving the word of god i had left as much worldliness as i possibly could i'd been going to denominational churches different ones trying them off and on i had no idea god had sent a prophet i had no idea there was an end time message like all those scriptures said that we went through at the beginning but to make a long story short my brother simon went to a bible study he was invited to after the attacks of 9 11 rocked the nation and really rocked the world and he happened to go to a bible study that was preaching the revelations god gave to brother branham well simon was on fire he come and he said i know jesse's going to receive it so he came to me on thanksgiving night 2001 and played me a sermon about the two seeds in genesis 3 15 the seed of the serpent and the seed of the woman i was blown away i had never heard a preacher preach like that so that was the starting point of doing bible studies prayer attending services where i learned the revelations and god revealed his word to me that he had originally given to his prophet brother banham and that was 21 years ago and here i am today continuing to grow in the grace and knowledge of the lord still listening to brother branham taking everything he says back to the word of god and also open to receiving any revelation the holy ghost would give me as i study as i pray as i preach as i seek the face of the lord amen how about you how did you come to know the message that god sent for this day it's very similar to yours um i grew up with the cnn church christian missionary alliance big believers in billy graham and follow his teachings and as i grew up the one thing that always got me was why didn't people obey the word of god like i would read it and people would be like oh it's not far a day that was for the old days it doesn't pertain to us that never made sense to me like i believe the bible i thought all christians believe the bible and i grew up with that mentality when like why does why is everyone not taking the bible seriously or why is it why aren't people taking christianity seriously so there's one time around 21 when i was around 21. i was pretty miserable in my life and i went down and i prayed this prayer i said god i know that you're real but where's the god of abraham jacob isaac where are you god why don't i see you and that's when i've met my pastor right now pastor jesse and when i first met him when god led me to go to his church one time i just knew that pastor jesse had god with him there was just something different about his character his personality that man has the holy ghost and that would that is what drew me to this message i'm like there's actually a real christian reliving a real christian life and from that point on i just started coming to his church and that's when i found out about the message and the truth about the bible and it just makes so much sense why people aren't living a christian life and why there's only a small group that lived pure christian lives according to the word of god and that's how i came into this message i remember one thing about your testimony brother that proves brother amen was a foreknown child of god do you want to tell about how you would attend church when you were younger all by yourself yes so when i was younger my parents divorced which a lot of families are like that which is sad so i always wanted to go to church and there'd be so many times where my entire family did not go to church and i was the only one and i'd be walking through snow rain just to go to church and this was a denominational church i just loved god and just loved to be around i love fellowshipping with people and just being around god and talking about god and that's what drove me to doing that and i was using all my passion and drive for the cma church and when we moved down to akron it was the same thing same passion but i figured i found out that that was the right passion but you're using it the wrong way for not a church that loves god but now i found a church that loves god and now i can give my whole heart to it knowing that they love god the same i love that story because it shows that a real love for god god will satisfy that love sounds like brother amen you had this desire this deep call for god right and so if you had a deep call for god like the book of psalms says there had to be a god to respond that's right i have a similar story like after i got saved around the year 2000 or so before i came to this message i was into the word as much as i could the church that i went to just kind of taught on four themes they would cycle through four themes every year and after year or two i kind of got fed up with that and i started reaching out for more revelation i got into the baptist preacher john piper and other preachers and i was just eating it up and i and i always knew there had to be more truth one example was i was reading matthew 7 which we mentioned earlier where jesus tells people that had done miracles that they would not inherit the kingdom of god and he said depart from me you workers of iniquity i never knew you and this honestly was so difficult for me to understand i struggle with this how could god send these people to hell that did miracles well i struggled with that for a long time until the ministry of william branham came and he preached a sermon called the anointed ones of the end time in 1965 and i still remember listening to that sermon that sermon showed how people can take the anointing of the holy spirit on the outer courts of their body meaning the body and the mind the human spirit but yet reject it in the soul and in their souls love sin and reject salvation and ultimately be lost this is another example like our brother amen who had a deep call for god why did deep call to understand the mysteries of god i had a deep call to hunger and thirst for more of god so there had to be a deep to respond and god gave me that response through the ministry of william branham and gave us thus saith the lord on the scripture that's a really good point especially with churches that have people that look really holy and look like they serve god but yet they live even lives so when that god gets to operate their gift within them but yet they'll still be lost and if you look in the bible look at balaam he had the gift to prophesy but yet he wanted he told israel to commit for vacation you know saying that god will use you in the right time and season but doesn't mean that you're his that's exactly right the bible says gifts and callings of god are without repentance so balaam had this gift to prophesy and his prophecies were correct he prophesied of the star that would rise out of jacob the star the wise men would use to find the infant christ there in jerusalem but then later we find out he rejects the word of the lord he denies god's own word and fights against the people of god and then ii peter 2 says that his soul is lost and he is in the midst of darkness forever so just because someone has a gift or just because someone has supernatural experiences doesn't mean they're saved we know they're saved when they repent of their sins they've been baptized in the name of lord jesus christ and they're serving god but they must go on to sanctification and ultimately the baptism of the holy ghost just want to clarify that there are christians that are saved who are not in this message that will still be saved at the end of the world at the great jones white judgment and it goes back to the two types of christians the wise virgin and the foolish virgin i know that there are a lot of foolish virgins who don't have the holy ghost who are in a lot of denominations but yet they have salvation and salvation is a free gift the difference between a wise virgin and a foolish virgin is they both have salvation but the wise virgin they're able to bear fruit and they have the holy ghost and that goes back to jesus's parable the four grounds only the final ground had fruit that was the what kind of heart was that jesus said it's a good and honest heart that actually bears fruit the third kind of ground was the thorny ground and that's where we would see the foolish virgin where cares of the world crop up or grow up in their lives they're not able to bring forth real fruit of the holy ghost like real holy ghost long-suffering real holy ghost love for all the word of god you know like there's arguments in their churches there's division their churches but a real church that's baptized with the holy ghost will have the fruit of love they'll have struggles but they'll work through it we can learn from all of jesus teaching to help us understand the state of christianity right now and we can find ourselves in the wise virgin group and recognize at the same time though there's foolish virgins and they are virgins they're spiritually pure to god's word but they haven't gone all the way they haven't redeemed their time as paul said paul said the wise walk circumspectly and redeem their time and are sure they're born again of the holy ghost but the foolish haven't yet done that but surely they'll be saved um to review this lesson
