TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] Paul with the Holy Ghost had caught that in the spirit and the Holy Ghost was warning them of the last days don't you remember how Jesus spoke of it the Deeds of the nickens which finally become a Doctrine and then become an organization Brethren we're not in darkness now remember see here we are greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to define the Deeds the nickads identify examples that hinder churches today both message churches and those are churches that follow the Bible revelations of God's Prophet brother William brandham and non- message churches and then also to show by the Bible how we overcome the Deeds of the nicians just a brief introduction for those who don't know me I'm Pastor Jesse Smith I have believ the Bible revelations of God's Prophet William brandham since late 2001 and I preached these Bible revelations for nearly 20 years and I pastored the same church for 17 years I've written two books defending God's Prophet brother brandham and his bible-based message and I'll gladly email you the PDFs for free if you cannot afford them here's outline for this video first we'll give the definition of and summarize the Deeds of the nians second we'll look at the origin of the Deeds third we'll see the four-step process of death in both the Old and New Testaments fourth we'll look at brother Ram's teachings on 14 examples of the Deeds and doctrines of the nians fifth we'll look at nine doctrines of devils which are examples of doctrines of the nicians six we'll look at how Holy Ghost filled Christians can only allow Deeds for a short time seventh we'll listen to a 1951 Rapture Prophecy from Brother William Brenham about denominational bears being broken down before the Rapture and eighth and finally will end with how to overcome the Deeds of the nicians so let's begin with definition of and summary of the Deeds of nicians the Deeds of the nicians are the first step in a four-step process of antichrist religion another way to say it is the first step in the four-step process of spiritual death in Revelation 2 Jesus says he himself and the True Vine the True Believers hate the Deeds of nicians the word deeds in the Greek means Acts or undertakings and nians means victory of the people which can also mean Conquering the leoty and so these Deeds are undetected acts the Antichrist Spirit injects into churches and these Deeds later progress into doctrines so Satan uses what seem to be harmless Deeds to get victory over people and often begins by deceiving religious leaders who legalize sinful deeds in churches James 1:4 14 and 15 show this four-step process of death the scripture says but every man is tempted when he's drawn away of his own lust and enticed then when lust hath conceived it brings forth sin and sin when it's finished brings forth death so the four-step process is enticed by sin the second is lust conceived the third step is sin and the last step is death now let's look at the origin of the Deeds mentioned earlier in Revelation 2: 5 and 6 Jesus tells the Ephesian Church age that they left their first love and then in verse 6 the scripture says but this thou Hast that thou hatest the Deeds of the nickens which I also hate Jesus Christ identifies the Deeds as the first step of antichrist religion and then he defines the Second Step as doctrine of the nians seen in Revelation 2:15 the third step is bism found in Revelation 2:14 also called the doctrine of balum and the fourth and final step is Jezebel religion also called the depths of Satan found in Revelation 2:20 and Revelation 2:4 Third let's look at the four-step process of death in the Old Testament and the New Testament here's a visual to explain this four-step process of spiritual death in both the Old and New Testament we'll start in the far left column which is the column listing the four types of horses from the first four seals the first horse is white second red third black fourth pale and anyone that follows brother Ram's bible-based ministry will know brother ROM preached the revelation of the Seven Seals and these four horse riders were defined as the spirit of antichrist the spirit of death now in the second column from the left is where we get the Deeds of the nicadan this is the meaning of the first four seals out of the Seven Seals so the white horse represents deception and this deception is done through the Deeds of nicians it's the first step of the Antichrist process to try to bring spiritual death upon people remember friends this Antichrist spirit is defeated by the lion anointing the Holy Ghost anointing the red horse represents the Antichrist Spirit killing influence of real Believers this is where the Deeds of the nicians advance to false doctrines or doctrines of the nicians and the doctrine of nicians is defeated by the Holy Ghost anointing of the ox third the black horse is the Antichrist Spirit capturing wealth and bringing false Unity this Antichrist Spirit produces the doctrine of balum remember balum United Israel with the moabites I believe it led to 24,000 deaths of Israel if I'm not mistaken this Antichrist spirit is defeated by the man anointed fourth and finally is the pale horse rider the pale horse rider is spiritual death that's the name of the rider According To Jesus and this is also known as Jezebel religion or the depths of Satan but the Pale Rider is defeated by the Flying Eagle anointing that's prophetic anointing that God sent through the ministry of brother William brandham this four-step Antichrist Spirit was foretold in the Old Testament through the Book of Joel chapter 1 and 2 where it speaks of the cankerworm caterpillar worm and Locust notice it's the same insect in four stages just like the four horse riders were the same Rider just in four different stages now brother Bram told us the meaning of these in the sermon restoration of the brid tree from 1962 Easter Sunday brother Ram said the cankerworm eats away the fruits of the Holy Spirit such as Joy from the Believers the next stage of the insect is the caterpillar and brother Ram says this is the caterpillar eating the leaves of the Bride tree or taking away the Fellowship of the Saints the third step is the Palmer worm and brother Ram tells us that's the Antichrist Spirit eating away the doctrine or the bark of the Bride tree and the fourth and final step is the Locust the mature insect and this Locust eats the pulp of the tree or the life of the tree eats away the salvation of the tree and that's a great Revelation perhaps I'll do a video on that how some people if they're not born again can lose their salvation According To Jesus Revelation 3:5 is Jesus's own word saying he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white rment and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life but I will confess his name before my father and before his angels so there it is the Lord Jesus Christ says if someone is not born again and they choose to leave the faith they can have their names blotted out of the book of life but of course Holy Ghost filled Saints have their names written in the Lamb's Book of Life and their names can never never be blotted out same truth is found in Jesus's parable of the four grounds in Luke 88:13 the second kind of ground where the seed falls on a Stony ground Jesus said they receive the word with joy and these have no root for which for a while believe and in the time of Temptation fall away so these are people like Judas es scarat who beli for a while their names were written on the Book of Life in heaven because they had a confession of Faith but then in the time of test they fell away and their names were blotted out of The Book of Life moving on to the fourth section here let's look at brother Brand's teaching on 14 examples of deeds and doctrines of the nians and Friends these examples are coming from Brother brandom's Church age book pages 91-96 then also on pages 366 through 381 so on these Pages brother random says with the Deeds of the nickol leans Holy Ghost leadership gets replaced by man's leadership and the clergy become a holy priesthood that stands above the leoty brother Ram said they go right back to the aonic system so legalism but we must have the leadership of the Holy Ghost through men Anointed with the Holy Ghost as brother randam used Hebrews 13: 7 and 8 this is the leadership the apostles had in the book of Acts so the first two examples brother R gives is Apostolic success ession and church membership these were the first Deeds of the nickol adans that turned into doctrines so this is seen most easily in the Roman Catholic Church they have Apostolic succession claiming they have popes all the way back to St Peter which of course is a lie and they have all these man-made requirements for church membership those are deeds and doctrines of the nicians a third example brother Rand gives is about the anointing of the Holy Ghost brother Ram says Roman Catholics replace the real real baptism of the Holy Ghost with transubstantiation the wafer and the wine given from the Roman Catholic priest to the believer the fourth example of the Deeds that turn to doctrines is water baptism brother brandham said that Catholics pour water on people instead of full immersion in water so message Believers should be careful that the water baptism is not perverted by baptizing in the name of William brandham that's blasphemy that's heresy we should only baptize In The Name Of The Lord Jesus Christ fifth example brother brandham gives is that priests become holier than the leoty or preachers become holier than the Ley brother Ram said every L member should have a leading of the Holy Ghost and brother Ram cites 1 Corinthians 14:26 every one of you have a Psalm haveth a Doctrine have a tongue have a revelation ha an interpretation so I believe this affects message churches and non- message churches the leoty and message churches cannot expect all the anointing to be on the PRI preachers each Ley member each believer in Jesus Christ should have an anointing of the Holy Ghost a leading of the Holy Ghost to edify the congregation every service brother Braham tells us that each person must be as interested as the pastor in getting their Ministry into the local church that's from church order 1963 let's listen to the quote and then like this if brother Neville say well I let me pardon me let me say this if brother Collins speaks with tongue and brother Hickerson gives the interpretation then they have a Ministry together for the church now that isn't the ministry of brother naville that's your ministry to the church I'm giving this as example then you Brethren should be just as interested in getting your ministry in the place in the house of God as a pastor is interested in getting his because it's just essential that you do it next brother random gives the sixth seventh eth and Ninth examples of Deeds of the nicians the sixth one is the pope is called the Vicor of Christ the seventh is Purgatory the eighth is mass the ninth is paying money to get out of hell moving on to Pages 366 through 381 brother random gives the 10th example of the Deeds of nicadan he said the clergy set themselves in ranks one above the other in my humble opinion this is starting to manifest in message churches because as my video last year showed there's a goat debate amongst message Believers the tape church ministry call themselves the greatest of all time and then there's message preachers that are not in the tape Church movement who call themselves the greatest of all time to my humble opinion this is an example of the Deeds of the nicians getting into these churches they're exalting themselves as the greatest of all time according to the Bible the only believers who argued about the greatest of all time were those who were not born again Jesus's disciples were disputing among themselves who was the greatest in Mark 9:34 so that's Bible proof that people who debate about who's the greatest probably are not born again the 11th example brother ROM gives is overseers holding that their title Bishop meant a little more than just a local responsibility now in my opinion I think this is rare at least in the United States but no doubt overseas this happens it's when pastors try to Pastor more than one church or travel too much while still taking ties from their home Church of course there are times when there's a brand new church and they don't have a pastor and one Pastor may have to help them out for a while but the goal of every Pastor should be to lead just one Church be the Sovereign leader appointed by the Holy Ghost over just one Church three more examples I found of the early church battling the deeds and doctrines of the nicians was from my 2021 book about the 12 New Testament Mysteries I found that the churches of Rome started compromising on holidays so that's the 12th deed or doctr the nicadan they started partaking in the sinful parts of holidays 13th they started idolatry when poar visited Rome in 155 ad there was an idol of St Peter and the so-called Roman Christians lit candles placed it before the statue of St Peter and bowed to the Statue 14th example is the Eucharist making the wafer or bread equal to the body of Jesus Christ which we know it is not the bread is just a symbol of the broken body of Christ moving on to part five let's look at nine doctrines of devils by God's grace I preached on this last year in 2022 and these are examples of Deeds that became doctrines of devils and the doctrines of devils is spoken of in 1 Timothy 4:1 in the latter times some shall depart from the faith giving heeds to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils the first one is mandatory celibacy that's 1 Timothy 4:3 doesn't really impact message churches more so Roman Catholics second is a mandatory vegetarian diet 1 Timothy 4:3 the third deed or doctrine of the nicians is the rapture has already happened it's in the past that's according to 2 Timothy 2:8 and this is equivalent to message people saying we're already in the Millennium so that's a doctrine of a devil fourth there's a doctrine of a devil that we no longer have to fast that's according to Philippians 3:19 and Mark 2:20 I had a message Pastor tell me one time that the Lord returned in the 1963 Cloud so we had no need to fast and of course that led to his unhealthy lifestyle a lot of health problems and that's a false Doctrine the fifth doctrine of a devil is turning Grace into lawlessness or Lous out of Jude 1:4 and Hebrews 12:14 now the equivalent to this is once saved always saved that's the extreme calvinistic view or everyone will go to heaven which is universalism yes God gives Grace but Grace must be received Grace cannot be Trot in underfoot and once saved always saved only applies to the predestinated elect the wise virgin and the foolish virgin who are saved but once saved always saved does not apply to people like Judas scariot and that's according to Jesus's own words as in Luke 8:13 and Revelation 3:5 because Jesus said he will blot out names out of The Book of Life six is that false doctrine of the Prosperity Gospel God always wants you Healthy and Wealthy this is a doctrine of a devil according to 2 Peter 2 18-20 James 2:5 and 2 Corinthians 12 6-12 brother R plainly tells us it is not always God's will to heal brother Ram told us to first get a clear-cut decision from God about whether it's God's will or not to heal as in the case of sister stuff's dead baby from Germany and I made a quote video about that if you'd like to watch that and his brother Bram told us and works as Faith Express 1965 he said Your Divine Healing quote it must be revealed first end quote the seventh doctrine of a devil is presuming and exalting brother brandham and his followers as the greatest of all time and the people that propagate this lie never say except for Jesus and of course I made a video on that if you'd like to watch that this is according to Matthew 20:23 and 2 Corinthians 10:12 the eighth doctrine of a devil is that rapturing faith is literally on the tapes of brother brandham this is against the Bible the Bible plain L says rapturing faith is an anointing Sent From Heaven it's going to be poured out from Heaven according to James 5:7 Joel 2:23 through 26 and Zechariah 10:1 this is a doctrine of a devil of course propagated by the tape Church movement who worship every word on the tapes and the ninth doctrine of a devil is making a tradition out of brother brandom's life this is according to Psalm 101:3 and John 5:45 and the example I gave while preaching ing this sermon is some people will take brother Ram's quotes out of context where brother Ram said he watched certain movies but brother Ram doesn't tell us how much he watched of the movies and so then the enemy will get into that and he'll anoint preachers to allow themselves and other people to watch any movies they want and of course present sinful things before their eyes and so that breaks Psalm 101:3 we must not make a tradition out of brother brenham's life brother bham taught us this in the world is falling apart 1963 brother Bram said and then about another generation you wake up and realize that that was a prophet and then what do you do you garnish the tomb what do you do make a tradition of his life that's exactly what Israel had done had taken the prophet Moses and made a tradition of his life next in the sixth section let's look at how Holy Ghost filled Christians can only allow Deeds of course this is my opinion as far as I understand by the word of God so just briefly reviewing the four-step process starts with deeds and then doctrines and doctrines of balum and then Jezebel religion or the depths of Satan so I believe a holy ghost filled Christian can only go into sin to the level of Deeds the reason I believe this is because of Galatians CH 2: 11-4 where Peter had separated himself from the Gentiles and Paul came to him and told him he was to be blamed he did it to his face and so this is a segregation that Peter did he segregated himself from other believers and it was a sin and so it doesn't look like Peter made this a Doctrine it was just a deed that he was allowing in Antioch but thankfully the Holy Ghost corrected him and so this is the Bible proof where I believe a holy ghost filled person and remember Peter had the Keys of the Kingdom he was a spokesperson on the day of Pentecost even he allowed this sinful deed of segregation in his church but then the Holy Ghost corrected him so I believe Holy Ghost filled Believers can be deceived or can sin to the first step the Deeds but then the Holy Ghost will correct them another example is polycarp brother the random said in the church age book on page 111 polycarp was not militant against the nicadan system he leaned toward organization and this was a trick of the enemy that tricked polycarp just like we would say Peter was tricked into segregation away from Gentile Believers but of course polycarp had a tremendous testimony as a martyr for Jesus Christ a true man of God taught under St John so here's two examples that make me believe that Holy Ghost filled Saints can only backslide or have a complex into the first step of this four-step process of death they would only go the first step of Deeds of the nicians but then the Holy Ghost would correct them moving on to the seventh section in this section we'll look at the 1951 Rapture prophecy brother Ram gave about God breaking down denominational bearers before the Rapture so I'm going to play this quote from the works that I do bear witness of me from 1950 1 April 13th in the quote you'll hear brother brandom say someday these denominational barriers will be taken away God will bring his church together and take it home he says I spoke that in the name of the Lord remember that you can put that down in the book that was true I've known about this quote for years I made a video about it about 10 years ago future Prophecies of William brandom thus sayith the Lord but what stuck out to me is as I studi this topic of deeds and nickens brother brandom says denominational barriers God has has to break down and then I thought about St Peter and his denominational Bearer he wouldn't eat with the Gentiles and polycarp's denominational barrier and how God will break all these down or God allowed them because we're all Sinners saved by grace we're all doing our best to overcome the enemy but we got to be tested and tried to perfect our faith and so this quote just stuck out to me and it shows God's faithfulness that no matter what we might struggle with no matter what trials we might have or even Deeds might allow God is faithful to cleanse us of all our iniquity he's faithful as the quote shows to smooth every stone that will go into Solomon's Temple which brother R uses as a type of the Rapture God will cut away our Deeds God will cut away our human leadership and he'll bring us together in perfect Christian character for the Rapture let's listen to the quote look when Solomon built the temple it was cut out from all over the world but when they come together there was the buzz of a song or the sound of a hammer every block no matter this might have been cut like one this and this and two this and this and three this and this and Fess or whatever it was but when they come together they went D tail one with the other that's right and it wasn't any Argan there wasn't any buzzing there wasn't any fussing they just went together and made the temple of God that's right and I believe that God is cutting out everywhere Born Again children of God and go to bring them together I may not to see it but I hope I do but someday you're going to have you remember these young people sitting here someday those denominational barriers and ideas that Fanatics has got out there and scooped around and separated the people will be taken away and God will bring his church together and take it home just as certain as anything in the world it was going to come that's prophecy remember that I spoke that in the name of the Lord now you can put that down upon the book now that was true I didn't know I saying going to say that now that's right that's how God will bring his church together you can depend on that and as long as you Argy and fusser one another you're in the kindergarten God will just keep you there till you learn enough to get out of it but oh amen well praise the Lord all right try get out have Fai step on the word of God Jesus said the disciples come said we've seen one cast out devils and we forbid him there start your denomination again said forbid him not amen be one with him that's all go John up they won't Jo up don't forbid him G that's the way to do moving on to the eighth and final section how to overcome the Deeds of the nicians the Bible gives us simple instructions on how to overcome the Deeds of G adans I would start with Matthew 6:33 seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things will be added unto you I think as a holy ghost filled Christian is seeking the kingdom of God God will reveal to him his sins his faults his failures and God will add the anointing of the Holy Ghost that we need but notice this is an everyday thing we must seek the kingdom of God every day and this seeking is also talked about in Hebrews 51 12-14 Paul's talking about mature Christian he say strong meat belongs to them that are of a full age that means mature and they have exercised their senses to discern both good and evil so as we seek the kingdom of God daily God gives us discernment or the spirit of judgment the Holy Ghost anointing of judgment and discernment to identify good and evil in our daily lives every day as we seek the good and not the evil so we discern or judge every action in our lives every day and this is based upon the love of God because the love of God keeps Jesus's commands as Jesus told us three times in John chapter 14 another way to say this is we must prove All Things by the Bible as 1 Thessalonians 5 tells us our doctrines must be biblical and if all of our doctrines are biblical then that proves we are born again 2 John 1: 9-10 tells us that plainly if we abide in the true doctrine of Christ we have both the father and the son the invisible Spirit and the image of the visible God Jesus Christ our high priest and also all of our Traditions or Christian Liberties must be true Christian Liberties and not sins there are some actions that Christians do that are just Liberties and they're not sins these Liberties don't make us any more holy or any less holy and Paul talks about this in a couple places 2 Thessalonians 2:15 he talks about our doctrines the Commandments that we've heard from the word but also our traditions and Paul also talked about it in Colossians 2: 16 and 17 any holy days any holidays any Traditions that we hold he says don't let any man judge you over those because they're all Shadows of the main thing Christ so we overcome the Deeds of the nicians we overcome by the anointing the Holy Ghost today which is his flying eagle anointing this is the same anointing that will help us discern good and evil the same anointing that helps us prove all things the same anointing that gives us the true doctrines and acceptable tradition within Christian Liberties and as we pray to our Lord Jesus Christ he will guide us into all truth as John 16-13 tells us the constant communion and prayer with the Lord Jesus Christ will keep us clean as Jesus said in John 153 now you are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you in closing friends I hope this video has been a blessing this is my first time really preaching on the deeds and doctrines of the nicadan I hope this was a help by the the grace of God and humbly I'll just say I haven't preached in depth on this topic This was meant to be an introduction to the deeds and doctrines of the nians we'll see where the Lord leads me after this but I just want to get this video out since I preached on it last night would have been November 22nd 2023 so the main thing to do is be humble be under the anointing of the Holy Ghost as 2 Corinthians 13:5 says examine yourselves whether you be in the faith prove your own selves know not your own selves how that Jesus Christ is in you except you be reprobates so each day we must seek the kingdom of God first we must be open to correction we must have the anointing of the Flying Eagle the Holy Ghost anointing for today and see ourselves as a tree that's planted by rivers of Living Water we must have salvation the life the doctrine the bark the leaves the fellowship and all the fruits of the Holy Spirit just as the bible promises that in Psalm 1 and Galatians CH 5 Psalm 1: 1-3 speaks of this this we Delight in the word of the lord we meditate in it day and night we're like that tree that brings forth the fruit in due season our leaves do not wither see the caterpillar cannot eat our fellowship whatever we do it prospers by the grace of Christ and Galatians 5:22 tells us the fruit of the spirit that's produced in our life love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness Faith meanness Temperance against such there is no law and Galatians 5:24 says they that are Christ have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts so he crucified the Deeds of nians and they never Advanced to the doctrine or the doctrine of balum or The Jezebel religion as Titus 21 and 12 tell us the grace of God teaches us to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts as we live soberly righteous and godly in this present world looking for that blessed hope the Glorious appearing of the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact prot me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
