[0:02] Revelation chapter 22.
[0:06] [Music]
[0:08] the themes of this chapter include the
[0:10] Throne of the New Jerusalem the Supreme
[0:13] deity of Jesus Christ
[0:15] warnings and blessings
[0:19] the Throne of the New Jerusalem is
[0:21] described in the first six verses
[0:24] a pure River of Water of Life proceeds
[0:27] out of the Throne of the lamb and the
[0:29] tree of life will bear 12 manner of
[0:31] fruits
[0:32] and its leaves also will be for the
[0:34] healing of the Nations
[0:36] the Servants of God shall see the Lamb's
[0:38] face and serve him the lamb will give
[0:40] light to everyone during his unending
[0:43] reign
[0:45] Jesus Christ Supreme deity is a major
[0:48] theme of this final chapter as Christ
[0:51] ends this book by reminding the readers
[0:53] of his titles from the opening chapters
[0:55] Alpha Omega
[0:57] beginning in the end the first and the
[1:00] last the root and offspring of David and
[1:02] the bright and Morning Star
[1:05] Jesus Christ has fully persuaded us that
[1:08] he is not a second person of the godhead
[1:10] but he is the image of the one person of
[1:13] God
[1:13] and all the godhead dwells in him bodily
[1:16] according to Colossians 2 verse 9.
[1:20] Jesus Christ gives multiple warnings and
[1:22] blessings in this closing chapter of the
[1:25] Bible
[1:25] Jesus warns us three times that he's
[1:28] coming quickly as verses 7 12 and 20
[1:31] state
[1:32] Christ also gives multiple blessings the
[1:35] first is for those who keep the sayings
[1:37] of the prophecy of this book
[1:39] the second is Jesus promise to bring
[1:41] each person's reward with him at his
[1:43] coming
[1:44] as he will give to every man according
[1:46] to his work
[1:50] the symbols and key Revelations include
[1:52] Tree of Life
[1:54] the servants at the throne
[1:56] the four still conditions
[1:59] the spear and the bride and a warning to
[2:02] keep from adding or taking away from
[2:04] this book
[2:07] the tree of life is said to return to
[2:09] the Earth and be near the Throne of God
[2:11] on either side of the River of Life
[2:15] in Genesis chapters 2 and 3 the tree of
[2:17] life was in the midst of the Garden of
[2:18] Eden but the sin of Adam and Eve the
[2:21] husband and wife had caused them to be
[2:23] denied access to the tree of life but
[2:26] now in the New Jerusalem the pure
[2:28] sinless holy conditions of the original
[2:30] Garden of Eden have been restored
[2:33] God's Great Plan of Redemption has been
[2:35] completed as he first gained preeminence
[2:37] in his son Jesus Christ then gained
[2:40] preeminence in the Gentile bride of
[2:42] Jesus Christ and now God again has a
[2:45] sinless husband and wife Jesus Christ
[2:47] and his wife back in perfect fellowship
[2:49] and an eternal Eden with the Tree of
[2:52] Life
[2:54] just like in Genesis chapters 1 2 and 3
[2:57] the tree of life is a symbol of the
[3:00] spirit of Jesus Christ for there can
[3:02] only be one way to eternal life
[3:06] the servants at the throne seem to refer
[3:09] to all those Born Again holy
[3:11] ghost-filled Believers which includes
[3:13] the New Testament Church and the 144 000
[3:16] Jewish Remnant according to Daniel 7
[3:18] verse 10 Revelation 14 verse 4.
[3:22] we believe this because who serves the
[3:24] husband Christ but his wife the bride of
[3:27] Christ
[3:28] these servants are said to have the
[3:29] right to Reign forever and ever
[3:31] fulfilling the Bible promise that new
[3:33] testament Saints would be Kings and
[3:35] Priests and Reign on the Earth according
[3:37] to Revelation 1 verse 6 and Revelation 5
[3:40] verse 5.
[3:42] the four still conditions of revelation
[3:45] 22 verse 11 is a key Revelation fully
[3:48] taught throughout the entire Bible this
[3:50] Revelation shows that all people will
[3:52] end up in one of four spiritual
[3:54] conditions two of which are worthy of
[3:57] eternal life and two that are worthy of
[3:59] the second death the Lake of Fire
[4:02] every person will have one of two
[4:04] Destinies either saved or lost the saved
[4:07] are believers and the lost are either
[4:09] make Believers or unbelievers there are
[4:12] two kinds of Believers holy and
[4:14] righteous
[4:15] just as there are two kinds of the Lost
[4:17] filthy and unjust
[4:19] these four conditions were also taught
[4:21] by Saint Paul as he said we are all one
[4:24] of four types of vessels in second
[4:26] Timothy 2 verse 20 either gold silver
[4:30] wood or Earth
[4:32] the Believers would be gold and silver
[4:34] the wise and foolish virgins the
[4:37] unbelievers would be wood and Earth
[4:39] which are make-believers and unbelievers
[4:42] the Lord Jesus taught that there were
[4:44] four kinds of heart conditions in
[4:46] Matthew 13 verses 3 through 9. good
[4:49] thorny Stoney and Wayside
[4:53] in the days of the Earthly Ministry of
[4:55] the Lord Jesus there were four different
[4:57] crosses one for Jesus the Holy One
[5:00] one for the saved thief the righteous
[5:04] one cross for Judas Iscariot the
[5:06] make-believer and one cross for the Lost
[5:09] thief the unbeliever
[5:11] if we examine the two types of Believers
[5:13] holy and righteous we will find that
[5:16] they type the wise and foolish virgins
[5:18] of Matthew 25 verses 1 through 13.
[5:22] the main difference between these two
[5:23] believers who were both virgin or free
[5:26] from intercourse with idolatry is that
[5:29] the wise virgins had oil
[5:31] and oil is the symbol of the baptism of
[5:34] the Holy Ghost according to Zechariah 4
[5:36] verse 6 and verses 11 through 14.
[5:40] Believers must make their calling
[5:42] election sure II Peter 1 verse 10 and be
[5:45] positive their life is filled with the
[5:47] oil of the Holy Ghost and this oil also
[5:50] represents that they are clothed with
[5:52] power according to Luke 24 49 and have
[5:55] boldness according to acts 4 verse 31
[5:59] for the name of Jesus Christ
[6:02] the invitation of the spirit and bride
[6:04] to come and take of the Water of Life is
[6:07] a key revelation of how God will always
[6:09] use men who are filled with the Holy
[6:11] Ghost to save the Lost
[6:14] the holy spirit always has and always
[6:16] will speak through the bride the New
[6:18] Testament Church and the spirit does
[6:20] this through the five preaching gifts in
[6:22] the church which are the Apostle Prophet
[6:25] evangelist pastor and teacher according
[6:27] to Ephesians 4 verses 10 through 16. the
[6:31] true bride of Christ and her preachers
[6:32] are the mouthpiece of God on the Earth
[6:34] today
[6:35] if you and I expect to be made ready for
[6:38] the second coming of Jesus Christ we
[6:40] must submit to the pattern that Christ
[6:41] left for us
[6:43] we must follow the faith of the Holy
[6:45] Ghost anointed preachers that Jesus has
[6:47] sent down Through the Ages
[6:49] and their preaching will bring us unto
[6:51] the unity of Faith unto a perfect man
[6:53] according to Ephesians 4.
[6:56] we must obey the word they preach
[6:58] following their faith according to
[6:59] Hebrews 13 verse 7 and Hebrews 13 verse
[7:03] 17.
[7:04] we know this pattern will not change for
[7:07] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[7:09] and forever according to Hebrews 13
[7:11] verse 8.
[7:15] the warning about the contents of this
[7:17] book is a key Revelation showing that
[7:19] God demands respect accountability and
[7:22] reverence for every word of God Jesus
[7:25] commanded that we live by every word
[7:26] that proceeds out of the mouth of God in
[7:28] Matthew 4 verse 4.
[7:31] revelation 22 verses 18 to 19 states
[7:34] that anyone who adds to the Book of
[7:35] Revelation will have plagues added to
[7:38] them
[7:38] anyone who takes away from The Book of
[7:40] Revelation will have his part taken out
[7:42] of the book of life and the holy city
[7:45] preachers and all those who speak about
[7:47] the Bible must say only what the Bible
[7:49] says as Saint Paul taught his converts
[7:53] the whole Council or will of God
[7:55] according to Acts 20 verse 27. if we
[7:58] find ourselves hearing preaching that
[8:00] adds or takes away from The Book of
[8:01] Revelation we are bound by love to try
[8:04] and correct the preacher
[8:06] if we stay under that Ministry or seek
[8:09] out a different Ministry that is pure to
[8:10] every word of God
[8:12] even the changing of one word of God
[8:14] will bring great heartache and
[8:16] destruction as seen in Genesis 3 verse 4
[8:18] when the serpent added just one word to
[8:21] God's word saying ye shall not surely
[8:23] die
[8:25] proverbs 30 verses 5 and 6 shows us that
[8:28] we must not add to any part of the Bible
[8:30] including the Book of Revelation
[8:32] proverbs 30 verse 5 and 6 say every word
[8:35] of God is pure he's a shield unto them
[8:38] that put their trust in him add thou not
[8:40] unto his words lest he reprove thee and
[8:43] thou be found a liar
[8:46] the timing of events is as follows
[8:49] this chapter seems to be chronological
[8:51] when it references events in the time of
[8:54] the New Jerusalem in the first five
[8:56] verses
[8:57] beginning in verse 6 until the end of
[8:59] the book there's a break in the visions
[9:01] of the New Jerusalem and we are given
[9:03] repeated warnings and blessings about
[9:05] the quick coming of Jesus as three times
[9:08] Christ says I come quickly
[9:11] May these unfailing words of Jesus
[9:13] Christ inspire you to get your life in
[9:16] order for Jesus's Second Coming
[9:18] recall Revelation 19 verse 7. let us be
[9:22] glad and rejoice and give honor to him
[9:24] for the marriage of the Lamb has come
[9:25] and his wife hath made herself ready
[9:29] this concludes our series on the Book of
[9:31] Revelation even so come Lord Jesus
[9:37] if you'd like more Bible scriptures
[9:39] quotations or if you have any questions
[9:41] about the Book of Revelation please
[9:43] contact us
[9:45] God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[9:48] the desire of your heart
