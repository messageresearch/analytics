[0:02] well then the same god that said don't
[0:05] make yourself any engraved images the
[0:07] same god said build two chirping
[0:12] greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:15] of the lord jesus christ
[0:17] is it sinful for our church and other
[0:19] churches to display pictures of jesus
[0:22] christ
[0:23] i believe the answer is no as long as
[0:25] the picture is used as a reminder and no
[0:28] worship is directed to the picture or
[0:31] image
[0:32] over the years our church has been
[0:34] accused of being idolaters because we
[0:36] have a picture of the lord jesus christ
[0:38] that we display here in the church and
[0:40] people see it on our live stream
[0:42] services
[0:43] and i've always responded to these
[0:44] comments in the same manner a
[0:46] bible-based manner and i want to share a
[0:48] public response to all of our viewers
[0:50] that might help other believers
[0:52] worldwide
[0:53] i'll begin by reading the comment of the
[0:56] viewer accusing me of being an idolater
[0:58] for having a picture of jesus christ
[1:00] in our church and then i'll share my
[1:02] convictions about hoffman's painting of
[1:04] christ which is displayed in our church
[1:06] and lastly show the sin of veneration of
[1:08] statues and images
[1:11] the viewer wrote and i quote i do
[1:13] appreciate the teachings you share
[1:15] according to the word of god thank you
[1:16] so much i have learned tremendously from
[1:18] your ministry but i do have a problem
[1:20] with the false god on the background
[1:22] behind you to your left exodus 20 verses
[1:26] 4 and 5 end quote
[1:28] i'll read exodus 20 verses 4 and 5. of
[1:30] course you know it's out of the 10
[1:32] commandments
[1:33] thou shalt not make unto thee any graven
[1:35] image or any likeness of anything that
[1:37] is in heaven above or that is in the
[1:39] earth beneath
[1:40] or that is in the water underneath the
[1:42] earth thou shalt not bow down thyself to
[1:45] them nor serve them for i the lord thy
[1:48] god am a jealous god visiting the
[1:50] iniquity of the fathers upon the
[1:51] children unto the third and fourth
[1:53] generation
[1:54] of them that hate me
[1:57] so my brief reply was this quote
[1:59] regarding your question with all due
[2:01] love and respect you are mistaken
[2:04] i believe exodus 20 verses 4 and 5
[2:06] but did you consider exodus 25
[2:09] verses 18-22
[2:12] god himself told aaron to worship him
[2:14] between two man-made statues of cherubim
[2:19] was aaron an idolater
[2:21] you might think he was but he was not
[2:24] the statues were simply reminders of the
[2:26] presence of the holy angels
[2:29] and they also helped aaron
[2:30] moses and the children of israel to know
[2:33] what the heavenly sanctuary was like as
[2:35] well because moses built this earthly
[2:37] sanctuary based upon the heavenly
[2:39] pattern that god showed him
[2:41] again notice the words that god told
[2:43] moses in exodus 20 he specifically said
[2:46] thou shalt not make unto thee any graven
[2:49] image or any likeness of anything that
[2:52] is in heaven above
[2:53] so of course cherubims would be in
[2:55] heaven above
[2:56] and remember a few chapters later god
[2:58] told moses to have israel make images or
[3:02] statues of two cherubim that would go
[3:04] upon the mercy seat
[3:06] so god's meaning must be never worship
[3:09] any image whether two-dimensional or
[3:11] three-dimensional but it's undeniable
[3:13] that god commissioned moses aaron and
[3:15] israel to build images on earth to
[3:18] represent the two cherubim in heaven
[3:20] above
[3:22] god is unchanging meaning we like aaron
[3:25] can worship the one true god with visual
[3:27] reminders
[3:28] my reminder is the painting of jesus
[3:30] christ but i don't worship that painting
[3:33] the same was true for aaron he did not
[3:35] worship the angelic statues he
[3:38] worshipped god between the statues
[3:40] i hope this helps you to stop rebuking
[3:42] me and others that worship with
[3:44] reminders like aaron had as well
[3:47] god bless you and again this is written
[3:49] in brotherly love and fellowship please
[3:51] repent of your words toward others about
[3:53] false gods you are clearly wrong and
[3:55] unbalanced because jesus christ is the
[3:58] same yesterday today and forever and
[4:01] quote
[4:02] here's a quote from brother branham that
[4:03] i heard years ago which i use to help
[4:05] give an answer to the person who is
[4:07] criticizing our church for having a
[4:09] painting of jesus christ on the wall
[4:11] let's listen to the quote you say why do
[4:14] you need that you shouldn't have an
[4:17] image well then the same god that said
[4:20] don't make yourself any engraved in
[4:21] images the same god said build two
[4:24] turbans and tip their wings together and
[4:26] put them at the mercy seat where the
[4:28] people pray
[4:29] you see it's without understanding
[4:34] i love the balance that the holy ghost
[4:35] gave brother branham in this quote which
[4:37] is why i use it when people either
[4:39] accuse me or ask me about this topic
[4:42] friends if you condemn our church for
[4:44] having hoffman's painting displayed as
[4:46] we worship jesus christ because it's an
[4:49] image or picture then you have to
[4:51] condemn aaron for worshiping and talking
[4:53] to god in the midst of the two
[4:55] non-living images of angels or cherubim
[4:58] you would also have to condemn every
[5:00] wooden cross displayed around the world
[5:02] whether in public or in the church
[5:04] buildings
[5:05] so i see displaying pictures of christ
[5:07] or crosses as a christian liberty and of
[5:10] course we have to be careful with
[5:12] christian liberties but paul said not to
[5:14] let your good be spoken evil of in
[5:16] romans 14 verse 16
[5:19] let not then your good be evil spoken of
[5:23] my convictions about hoffman's painting
[5:25] of christ
[5:27] the picture of jesus we display in our
[5:28] church was artwork by german heinrich
[5:31] hoffman who lived from 1824 to 1911
[5:35] according to a couple different websites
[5:37] the name of the painting is christ and
[5:39] the rich young ruler painted around 1888
[5:42] or 1889.
[5:44] i have no information about which church
[5:46] hoffman belonged to if he did belong to
[5:49] a church
[5:50] i only know that one website said he
[5:52] read his bible daily and he and his wife
[5:54] had no children
[5:56] the three reasons we display hoffman's
[5:58] painting are
[6:00] first it's a reminder of christ jesus
[6:02] our lord second it matches the isaiah 53
[6:05] description of jesus having no
[6:07] calmlyness a man of sorrows and with no
[6:09] beauty
[6:11] and third god's prophet william branham
[6:13] said this painting was the closest to
[6:15] looking like the visions he had had of
[6:18] the lord jesus christ during his
[6:19] lifetime
[6:20] i'm going to give more detail now about
[6:22] these three reasons
[6:24] first pictures or images are acceptable
[6:26] as reminders of god in his word
[6:29] in deuteronomy chapter 6 god told moses
[6:31] to tell israel to constantly talk about
[6:33] his commands and even write his commands
[6:35] on the posts of their houses
[6:37] and on their gates
[6:39] displaying the images of god's word was
[6:42] pleasing to god as reminders as verse 12
[6:44] shows god's warning to israel that they
[6:47] should not forget god once they moved
[6:49] into the promised land which the
[6:51] generation that knew not joshua and
[6:53] joshua's testimonies fulfilled to their
[6:56] shame
[6:57] deuteronomy 6 verses 6 through 9 say and
[7:01] these words which i command thee this
[7:02] day shall be in thine heart and thou
[7:04] shalt teach them diligently unto thy
[7:06] children and shall talk of them when
[7:08] thou sittest in thine house and when
[7:10] thou walkest by the way and when thou
[7:13] liest down and when thou rises up and
[7:15] thou shalt bind them for a sign upon
[7:18] thine hand and they shall be as
[7:19] frontlets between thine eyes and thou
[7:22] shalt write them upon the posts of thy
[7:24] house
[7:24] and on thy gates
[7:26] and then verse 12 says then beware lest
[7:29] thou forget the lord which brought thee
[7:31] forth out of the land of egypt from the
[7:33] house of bondage
[7:35] since jesus is the word of god according
[7:38] to john chapter 1 his words written out
[7:41] are images of himself or his nature or
[7:44] his character
[7:45] god did not forbid these visual
[7:47] reminders of himself but encourage them
[7:50] which is why we believe pictures of
[7:52] jesus and visual representations of
[7:54] scriptures and also jesus's words
[7:57] are completely acceptable just as god
[7:59] allowed the images of the cherubim
[8:01] another example is the brass serpent
[8:03] that god had moses form for the snake
[8:05] bitten people of israel they were told
[8:08] to look and live at the image but the
[8:10] brass image itself had no healing virtue
[8:13] in it it was representing what god was
[8:15] going to do with sin
[8:17] through the sacrifice of jesus christ
[8:20] israel looked and they were healed of
[8:22] their snake bites
[8:23] hundreds of years later though this
[8:25] image became an idol
[8:27] so we see god using images and statues
[8:29] like the cherubim and the brass serpent
[8:32] and as long as they were used correctly
[8:34] they were a blessing to the people of
[8:35] god
[8:36] but when the people became carnal these
[8:38] images became worthless or an object of
[8:41] worship such as in the case of the brass
[8:43] serpent which hezekiah had to destroy in
[8:45] second kings 18 because it had become
[8:47] such an idol to israel
[8:51] second we display the painting of jesus
[8:53] because isaiah 53 verses 2 and 3
[8:56] describe jesus as the following
[8:58] for he shall grow up before him as a
[9:00] tender plant and as a root out of a dry
[9:02] ground he hath no form nor calmliness
[9:06] and when we shall see him there is no
[9:07] beauty that we should desire him
[9:10] he is despised and rejected a man a man
[9:12] of sorrows and acquainted with grief and
[9:15] we hid as it were our faces from him he
[9:17] was despised and we esteemed him not
[9:21] notice verse 2 says he had no comeliness
[9:24] which means ornament splendor or majesty
[9:26] in the hebrew it also says jesus had no
[9:29] beauty that we should desire him
[9:32] in verse 3 it says christ was a man of
[9:34] sorrows now as we look at hoffman's
[9:36] picture of christ and the rich young
[9:38] ruler the rich young ruler has the
[9:40] splendor with his extravagant clothing
[9:43] and he looks beautiful and young even
[9:45] having a shaved face
[9:47] christ on the other hand looks sad like
[9:49] a man of sorrows as isaiah 53 says and
[9:52] he looks more rugged with a long beard
[9:55] and wavy uncombed hair
[9:57] hoffman's painting therefore seems to
[9:59] depict christ as isaiah 53 describes him
[10:04] third we display this painting of christ
[10:06] because god's prophet brother william
[10:08] branham said hoffman's painting of
[10:10] christ most resembled his visions of
[10:12] jesus which led him to have hoffman's
[10:15] painting of christ displayed in this
[10:17] home let's listen to the quote
[10:19] the first time i ever seen him look like
[10:21] a head of hoffman i'd never seen that
[10:23] before in a philly sunday's tabernacle
[10:25] years later i saw it my house had never
[10:27] been without one of the pictures since
[10:30] additionally some think acts 17 verse 29
[10:34] forbids any artwork of jesus but they're
[10:36] wrong it reads for as much then as we
[10:39] are the offspring of god we ought not to
[10:41] think that the godhead is like unto gold
[10:44] or silver or stone graven by art and
[10:46] man's device
[10:48] this scripture doesn't forbid pictures
[10:50] images or anything else
[10:52] it says we should not think that the
[10:54] godhead is like gold silver or stone
[10:58] artwork made by man paul said this
[11:00] because at that moment in athens he was
[11:03] surrounded by idolaters who worshipped
[11:05] every false god
[11:06] and there were gold silver stone idols
[11:09] surrounding paul
[11:11] true holy ghost filled believers do not
[11:13] think the godhead can be captured or
[11:15] contained in any man-made artwork
[11:18] here's a helpful quote from
[11:20] gotquestions.org
[11:21] quote of course simply having a picture
[11:24] of jesus hanging in a home or church
[11:25] does not mean people are practicing
[11:28] idolatry it is possible that a portrait
[11:30] of jesus or a crucifix can become an
[11:33] object of worship in which case the
[11:35] worshiper is at fault but there is
[11:37] nothing in the new testament that would
[11:38] specifically forbid a christian from
[11:40] having a picture of jesus such an image
[11:43] could well be a reminder to pray to
[11:45] refocus on the lord or to follow in
[11:47] christ's footsteps
[11:49] but believers should know that the lord
[11:51] cannot be reduced to a two-dimensional
[11:53] image and that prayer or adoration is
[11:55] not to be offered to a picture
[11:57] a picture will never be a complete image
[12:00] of god or accurately displays glory and
[12:02] should never be a substitute for how we
[12:04] view god or deepen our knowledge of him
[12:06] and of course even the most beautiful
[12:08] representation of jesus christ is
[12:10] nothing more than one artist's
[12:12] conception of what the lord looked like
[12:15] end quote
[12:17] catholic veneration of statues and
[12:19] images
[12:21] friends catholics and other protestants
[12:24] venerate or honor pictures statues and
[12:26] other images which is sinful according
[12:29] to the american heritage dictionary
[12:31] venerate means
[12:32] first to regard with deep respect or
[12:34] reverence
[12:36] and second to regard with reverential
[12:38] respect to honor with mingled respect
[12:41] and awe
[12:42] to reverence to revere
[12:44] so true christians do not stand in awe
[12:46] at any two-dimensional or
[12:48] three-dimensional image of jesus or a
[12:51] cross or any other religious symbol
[12:53] my church and i do not give any worship
[12:56] or sinful veneration or sinful honor to
[12:59] picture statues or other images because
[13:01] there is no life in them
[13:03] we devote all worship and praise to the
[13:06] supernatural person of the lord jesus
[13:08] christ who currently sits on the right
[13:10] hand of the majesty on high and whose
[13:12] holy ghost abides in our souls
[13:15] on the other hand many catholics
[13:16] protestants and independents devote
[13:19] sinful veneration to statues and images
[13:21] which is why i wrote the following in my
[13:23] 2021 book about mystery babylon the
[13:26] roman catholic church
[13:29] pertaining to images the catechism of
[13:31] the catholic church states that the
[13:33] seventh ecumenical council at nicaea in
[13:35] the year 787 justified the veneration of
[13:39] images of christ the mother of god
[13:41] angels and all the saints which is in
[13:43] paragraph 21 31 in the catechism of the
[13:47] catholic church
[13:48] while this council may have justified
[13:50] the veneration of images and statues the
[13:52] bible never did
[13:54] catholics worldwide bow down to images
[13:57] kiss them rub them weep on them and
[13:59] further exalt them in a way that god
[14:01] never commanded towards any image or
[14:03] man-made statue as those behaviors
[14:06] bowing in worship kissing rubbing
[14:08] weeping while touching an image break
[14:11] the first commandment about having no
[14:12] other gods and making no graven image
[14:15] unto any likeness that is in heaven or
[14:18] on earth or in the water
[14:20] without a doubt due to the veneration of
[14:22] statues and images the spirit of
[14:24] idolatry lives in the roman catholic
[14:26] church and her daughters who follow her
[14:29] dogmas
[14:30] the spirit of idolatry is real in the
[14:32] roman catholic church and in many
[14:34] protestant churches who follow roman
[14:36] catholic traditions
[14:38] last fall a brother in christ named
[14:40] william and i visited numerous catholic
[14:42] churches in order to give them our
[14:45] christian books and resources that they
[14:47] might know the heir of their ways
[14:49] at one church the priests highly
[14:51] encourage his members to go out into
[14:52] their vestibule and purchase statues
[14:55] from a vendor from jerusalem who was
[14:57] selling them there was hundreds of
[14:59] statues and images out in the vestibule
[15:01] the priest encouraged them to use these
[15:03] statues as they said their monthly
[15:05] prayers which had a certain theme i
[15:07] can't remember what it was which no
[15:09] doubt would include idolatrous behaviors
[15:12] like bowing in worship to the images
[15:14] kissing the images and rubbing the
[15:16] images as the catechism of the catholic
[15:18] church plainly states in the book
[15:21] in closing
[15:23] i hope this video has been helpful to
[15:24] understand pictures images and other
[15:27] visual representations of christ the
[15:30] cross and other bible themes or persons
[15:33] again this is a wonderful exercise in
[15:35] rightly dividing the word of truth so
[15:37] there has to be a balance to this and
[15:39] thank god the holy spirit through the
[15:41] word of god and god's prophet to this
[15:43] age brother branham helped give us that
[15:45] much needed balance
[15:47] if you have any questions concerns or
[15:49] testimonies about this video please
[15:51] contact me
[15:54] god bless you and may jesus christ be
[15:56] the desire of your heart
