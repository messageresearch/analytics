[34:55] minutes on wednesday night so
[34:56] i would try to do that uh i forgot last
[35:00] week i think i preached about an hour
[35:02] 15 or 20 last wednesday night so forgive
[35:04] me
[35:05] um let me do a 40 minute timer there we
[35:07] go we'll see how this goes tonight by
[35:09] the grace of the lord
[35:11] so we look let's look at part 15 tonight
[35:13] by god's grace
[35:14] uh i wanna if you would uh let's just
[35:17] look at a few
[35:18] great definitions here paul open
[35:21] and a ledge you never think about those
[35:23] words there open
[35:24] is open the mind or cause somebody to
[35:28] understand so
[35:29] paul three sunday or three saturdays in
[35:31] a row
[35:32] was trying to get people to open their
[35:34] minds you ever feel like that you're
[35:35] trying to get your family to open their
[35:36] mind
[35:37] would you you know i think we do it all
[35:39] the time right we think my what
[35:41] what avenue or what angle could i try to
[35:43] take with my friends or my family
[35:46] to try to get them to think about the
[35:47] message right to get
[35:49] to think about the truth that's what
[35:51] paul was doing
[35:52] paul was using the scripture
[35:55] and he was trying to open their mind to
[35:57] look look what
[35:59] look at this little scripture here look
[36:00] at look at this and this morning i was
[36:02] actually working on i'm actually going
[36:04] to change my document real quick
[36:05] uh this morning i was looking on it and
[36:08] there were so many
[36:09] old testament scriptures that pointed to
[36:12] god
[36:14] opening the gospel to the gentiles
[36:17] david wrote of it twice david said twice
[36:20] all nations
[36:21] will worship the lord isaiah said it
[36:25] five times that there would be a great
[36:28] light to the gentiles
[36:29] amen he said
[36:32] he said the root of jesse he said would
[36:35] bring rest
[36:36] to the gentiles the bible said to uh
[36:39] to to the messiah would the gentiles
[36:42] seek
[36:42] for rest praise god amen hallelujah
[36:46] foretold that was 800 years maybe 900
[36:48] years before the messiah
[36:50] uh isaiah said the jesus would or the
[36:53] messiah
[36:54] would bring judgment to the gentiles
[36:57] and he said in isaiah 49 that uh the
[36:59] jesus
[37:00] or i'm sorry that god would bring a
[37:02] light to the gentiles
[37:04] in isaiah 6 60 verse 3 uh the bible said
[37:07] god would show light
[37:08] unto the people and to the gentiles
[37:11] praise god
[37:12] and hosea the bible said that god would
[37:15] offer salvation
[37:16] to the gentiles jeremiah also said so
[37:20] look there's four prophets already
[37:22] uh you have david isaiah hosea
[37:25] and jeremiah jeremiah said the gentiles
[37:28] shall
[37:28] know the lord and in his name
[37:32] should will the gentiles trust in the
[37:34] name of the lord amen
[37:36] ah just and so paul can you imagine paul
[37:39] was citing some of those in his letters
[37:41] he was citing hosea
[37:42] he was signing isaiah he was citing
[37:45] these men
[37:45] trying to get them to open their mind
[37:47] would you just open your mind
[37:49] and try to understand that these are
[37:51] scriptures jesus fulfilled
[37:53] remember how many believe did everybody
[37:55] believe no some believe
[37:57] i'm glad i'm one of those some praise
[37:59] god i'm some
[38:00] of those that believe the message of
[38:02] this day with thus saith the lord amen
[38:05] i'm glad i'm one of them i'm glad the
[38:07] lord could open my mind
[38:08] praise god amen that god could open my
[38:11] mind through brother bran's preaching
[38:13] and
[38:13] brother craig's teaching and brother
[38:15] brooks is preaching amen
[38:16] i'm glad god could open my mind through
[38:18] those brothers amen
[38:20] and cause me to understand what god
[38:23] promised for this day he promised it
[38:26] like the days of noah
[38:27] he promised it like the days of lot that
[38:29] there would be a son of man
[38:31] in the end times to restore all things
[38:34] praise god i'm glad
[38:35] amen that he showed it to me my mind
[38:38] could be open
[38:39] and he could cause me to understand now
[38:41] alleging is more simple just means
[38:43] explaining
[38:45] so paul had to explain here's what
[38:46] isaiah said here's what hosea said
[38:49] and here's here's what jesus did he had
[38:51] to take the scripture
[38:53] and he had to try to convince him and
[38:54] show that jesus needed to suffer
[38:57] jesus had to be the suffering servant of
[39:00] isaiah 53
[39:01] and he had to rise again he had to
[39:04] defeat death
[39:06] and he said this is the man i'm
[39:08] preaching unto you praise god
[39:11] now i want to just give an example
[39:14] and i i think i mentioned it on sunday i
[39:16] just never got to it
[39:17] and i thought well i think i'll throw it
[39:18] or not throw it i think i'll place it in
[39:20] here tonight
[39:21] so everybody can see this uh how
[39:23] important it is to rightly divide
[39:25] the word of truth now on the debate the
[39:27] brother said
[39:28] if you believe william branham is a
[39:29] prophet you have to believe everything
[39:31] he said to be a follower of him i said
[39:33] no i don't
[39:35] i don't have to believe everything he
[39:36] said i got to believe what he said
[39:38] as it's vindicated in the word of god
[39:40] right
[39:41] i don't have to believe everything he
[39:42] said but i've got to believe what he
[39:44] said from the word
[39:45] that's what i've got to believe praise
[39:47] god and it's got to be back the bible
[39:49] he said test me by the word but the man
[39:51] said prove all things test me by the
[39:53] word
[39:53] and he said and he said uh any doctrine
[39:56] has to have two
[39:57] or three witnesses praise god and so
[40:00] we've done
[40:01] we've done what brother graham told us
[40:02] to do test him by the word
[40:05] prove all things make sure in the mouth
[40:07] of two or three witnesses
[40:09] every word is established praise god see
[40:11] how they try to pin you in a corner
[40:13] well you got to believe everything no i
[40:15] don't the bible never said you had to
[40:16] believe everything
[40:17] elijah said you never had to leave
[40:19] everything moses said thank god
[40:21] thank god we don't have to believe
[40:22] everything abraham said because he lied
[40:26] right we we don't have to believe that
[40:28] sarah's not what wasn't his uh
[40:30] wife right we don't have to believe that
[40:32] although he told that to the king of
[40:34] egypt and
[40:34] we don't have to believe everything he
[40:36] said we just got to believe what he said
[40:38] with thus saith the lord
[40:40] and the word right so let me give you an
[40:42] example
[40:44] now i've heard numerous preachers preach
[40:46] i said i'm not bastion preachers i love
[40:48] preachers
[40:48] especially those well those that preach
[40:50] the truth but everybody makes mistakes i
[40:52] make mistakes as a preacher
[40:53] but look i've heard many people i've
[40:55] heard numerous preachers even here at
[40:57] our church over the years
[40:59] read this quote now i wonder how many of
[41:01] us said amen
[41:03] well after tonight i don't think you'll
[41:05] say amen if anybody reads this quote
[41:06] anymore
[41:08] at least these words in the quote these
[41:09] words by faith you're saved that's
[41:12] that's your faith in god amen the blood
[41:15] keeps you clean from sin because it
[41:16] makes a sacrifice amen
[41:18] the blood doesn't save you i don't say
[41:22] amen to that
[41:24] the blood the blood keeps you clean i'll
[41:26] say amen to that
[41:28] but i can't say amen to that
[41:32] right and church i listened to i went
[41:34] back and listened to it last saturday
[41:35] when i was studying
[41:37] brotherham says that he says the blood
[41:38] doesn't save you it only keeps you clean
[41:40] now look what his reasoning see he must
[41:43] have read this somewhere because it
[41:44] sounds okay
[41:46] but it's not all the truth
[41:49] he says how you say you're saved by
[41:51] faith you're saved and that by
[41:53] foreknowledge god calling you now that's
[41:55] true
[41:56] right because you're predestinated god
[41:59] knew you'd believe by faith so god
[42:00] predestinated you would be saved
[42:03] right that's true you are saved and the
[42:05] blood makes an atonement that's true
[42:07] amen
[42:08] constantly keeping you clean amen and
[42:10] then by one spirit you're baptized in
[42:11] the holy ghost
[42:12] into the fellowship of the believers
[42:14] amen in the fellowship of the holy
[42:15] spirit amen to be led by the spirit amen
[42:17] doing signs and wonders amen
[42:20] so i can say amen to almost everything
[42:22] in that quote
[42:23] except that little phrase
[42:26] the blood doesn't save you and i've had
[42:30] preachers
[42:30] here preach that i thought
[42:35] now i i'll just be silent in that in
[42:37] those times
[42:39] i'll be silent you might be silent uh
[42:42] because
[42:43] i was telling you that i was listening
[42:44] to the message communion
[42:46] his last sermon now really wasn't even a
[42:48] sermon brother perry greene
[42:50] preached and brother ram comes up he and
[42:52] brother branham serves communion
[42:55] and they record him talking for i think
[42:56] it was like 27 minutes so
[42:58] listen to it if you get a chance so i
[43:00] was listening brother said
[43:01] on the same basis we could absolutely
[43:04] justify the salvation army
[43:06] they do not believe in any form of water
[43:07] baptism and said we don't need it now
[43:10] if we don't need water baptism why are
[43:11] you baptized said the water can't save
[43:14] you the blood saves you
[43:15] i'll agree with that how you doing
[43:18] sister god bless you
[43:19] so look so brother adam says in his very
[43:22] last recorded
[43:23] uh talk i'll say like that brother adam
[43:27] said
[43:27] the blood saves you okay so brother man
[43:30] makes this argument with salvation army
[43:32] but man the salvation army said you
[43:33] don't need baptism the brotherhood says
[43:36] because the salvation army says water
[43:38] saves you
[43:39] you know you know they say that you're
[43:41] saved by going to the water the water
[43:42] saves you
[43:43] can you imagine that the water at their
[43:45] pool saves you
[43:47] can you imagine but that's what
[43:48] salvation army believe you gotta
[43:50] you gotta go to the water and brother
[43:52] man's argument is the water don't save
[43:54] you the what saves you
[43:56] well i i thought he just said the blood
[43:58] don't save you
[44:00] isn't that what he just said the blood
[44:01] done satan so see church as a
[44:04] as a student of the message like you are
[44:06] too you are too if you listen to
[44:08] it and study it and you compare thoughts
[44:10] and
[44:11] as a student of the message brother said
[44:12] the blood doesn't save you
[44:14] but then at the end of his message he
[44:15] says the blood does save you and church
[44:17] there's many other
[44:18] scores of quotes where he says the blood
[44:20] saves you it's just that one quote from
[44:23] uh adoption so he must have been
[44:25] studying he must have read like a
[44:26] different author or something like that
[44:28] and he just must have tried he was he
[44:30] was majoring a little bit on
[44:32] ephesians 2 8 where you're saved by
[44:34] grace through faith
[44:35] he was kind of too hard on that and for
[44:37] some reason he said the blood doesn't
[44:39] save you
[44:41] but then many many other times when ram
[44:43] said the man says the water doesn't save
[44:45] you the blood saves you
[44:49] i'll agree with that that's right the
[44:52] blood saves you
[44:53] not the water so i got an email back you
[44:57] know from brother joseph branham
[44:59] a few weeks ago uh and he said i believe
[45:02] every word on tape so
[45:04] brother joseph believes the blood
[45:05] doesn't save you and the blood does save
[45:07] you
[45:08] because i wrote him back i said well
[45:09] which one do you believe and he don't
[45:11] email me back now
[45:13] so see when it comes down they'll say
[45:14] general things but when it comes down to
[45:16] giving a real
[45:17] yes or no answer whether no they'll be
[45:19] wrong they don't even write you back
[45:22] when you try to when you finally pin
[45:24] them in a corner and say uh
[45:25] is billy paul the joseph are you the
[45:27] joseph
[45:28] see you later we'll talk about it same
[45:32] thing that's just
[45:33] i'm not comparing well i shouldn't say
[45:34] that i'm gonna skip that
[45:36] uh so see that's all they can say
[45:40] they all they can say is well i believe
[45:41] everything i don't believe everything
[45:42] brother brahms said
[45:43] i believe what brother brahm said as
[45:45] it's backed up by the word of god
[45:47] and the holy spirit right and god
[45:49] almighty in jesus christ praise god
[45:51] which is the one self same person praise
[45:53] god
[45:54] so see you have one that says we're not
[45:56] saved by the blood you know the one that
[45:58] says we are saved by the blood
[46:00] but we must take the water as an outward
[46:03] emotion
[46:03] that an inward work of grace has been
[46:06] done see
[46:07] so we must communion so see church water
[46:10] doesn't say
[46:10] communion doesn't save but jesus says to
[46:13] do it in remembrance of me
[46:16] and he says because it's part of your
[46:18] testimony
[46:20] right when you get to heaven you can
[46:21] stand there and say yes one time
[46:23] i walked down to that lake and my daddy
[46:25] baptized me haven you can say that
[46:27] that's part of your testimony
[46:28] my daddy buried me in the name of jesus
[46:30] christ in other words
[46:32] i wasn't ashamed to declare to the to
[46:34] the world remember when you're baptized
[46:36] there's all those people swimming around
[46:37] there half naked and everything like
[46:39] that
[46:39] you were a witness your testimony that
[46:41] you believe
[46:42] in the righteousness and the modesty of
[46:44] jesus christ amen
[46:46] praise god it's a testimony praise god
[46:48] the water doesn't save you
[46:50] but obeying that gives you a testimony
[46:53] you overcame
[46:54] you're a public witness your faith is
[46:56] real praise god
[46:58] amen but the water doesn't save you
[47:01] neither does the when we had the bread
[47:03] and wine last month that doesn't save us
[47:05] but it it gives us something to do uh to
[47:09] show our faith right
[47:10] so we can testify and we can be a
[47:13] witness that we follow jesus christ
[47:15] and we follow him in every word and the
[47:18] saint said
[47:19] and we follow him in every word and the
[47:21] saint said
[47:22] every word if he said baptized if he
[47:24] said a wine if he said bread we'll do it
[47:27] we'll do whatever jesus says
[47:28] because we believe every word he said
[47:31] praise god
[47:34] now church what do you got to do with
[47:36] everything with brother brahm like they
[47:37] tried to corner me
[47:38] and i said no i said every word of
[47:41] brother brand you got to take every word
[47:42] back to the bible
[47:44] so they brought this quote uh they have
[47:46] two quotes they brought also i'll
[47:47] probably maybe i'll get to it tonight
[47:49] there's one quote brother brahms says
[47:50] the trinitarians and the oneness
[47:52] all bow at the cross of jesus and
[47:55] they're all saved
[47:57] and then they use a quote from anointed
[47:58] ones in the end time where brother brahm
[48:00] says
[48:00] if a man can't believe he's one person
[48:03] he's lost
[48:04] that's quite a harsh statement and so he
[48:07] asked me well
[48:07] how can how can they be at the cross in
[48:10] one quote in the vision
[48:12] and then they're lost another quote well
[48:13] i said this all i can say
[48:15] is this quote didn't have thus saith the
[48:17] lord the one about their loss that
[48:19] doesn't have those saith the lord
[48:20] but the vision was thus saith the lord
[48:24] right so see you gotta and i said
[48:26] brother ram is a very zealous person
[48:29] he was he was a very dogmatic person he
[48:32] thought he was right
[48:33] all the time which is okay some of you
[48:35] are like that
[48:36] i didn't get very many amens on that
[48:38] that's true anyhow
[48:40] some of you just right we just we just
[48:42] think we're right i'm kind of like that
[48:43] sometimes
[48:44] sometimes my wife tries to tell me i'm
[48:46] wrong no i don't say that but
[48:48] that's what i feel like sometimes we're
[48:51] all a little prideful right and the
[48:52] church said
[48:53] i'll say amen amen sometimes i'm a
[48:56] little prideful
[48:57] but brother ram he's a man he was very
[49:00] dogmatic
[49:02] uh yeah can you go get jen there thanks
[49:04] yeah sorry she was sleeping
[49:06] she likes that she likes that nap on the
[49:08] way to church she likes that neck
[49:11] but church this is a good exercise for
[49:13] us if brother adam says that
[49:14] the blood doesn't save us and then he
[49:16] says it does well
[49:18] let's go to the word if there's any
[49:20] disagreement what does the word say
[49:22] well if the real revelation is this
[49:25] we're saved by grace
[49:26] through faith in the blood right because
[49:30] what are you trusting in
[49:31] are you trusting in the physical cross
[49:33] of jesus no
[49:35] are you trusting in the blood of jesus
[49:37] yes amen
[49:39] he he had holy blood the bible said it
[49:42] was the blood made by god amen
[49:44] god is a spirit doesn't have blood so he
[49:47] made a holy blood for his son
[49:49] and that blood was poured out and shed
[49:52] that we might be forgiven
[49:54] that blood was cursed that we might be
[49:55] blessed amen
[49:58] he became cursed that we might be
[50:00] blessed
[50:01] so see it's that blood we have faith in
[50:04] the blood in other words i'm trusting
[50:06] in jesus and shed blood to cover my sins
[50:09] amen
[50:10] i don't physically lay a hole sister
[50:12] beatrice of a goat remember we talked
[50:14] about it again
[50:15] we i don't lay a hold of a goat and
[50:17] bring it here and trust that that
[50:19] all my sins are on the head of that goat
[50:21] no but one day
[50:23] i went to the altar and i trusted that
[50:25] my sins were put on the head of the son
[50:27] of god amen
[50:29] the lamb of god and when he died he paid
[50:32] for
[50:33] my sins he paid my price i'm redeemed
[50:36] i'm repaid the ransom for my sins and
[50:39] now i
[50:40] inherit his righteousness amen just like
[50:43] i
[50:44] in the old testament i inherit that
[50:45] righteousness of that goat or that lamb
[50:48] or that bullock now i inherit the
[50:50] righteousness of god's lamb
[50:52] jesus christ amen so see i'm saved
[50:55] we have to accept ephesians 2 8 i'm
[50:58] saved by grace through faith
[50:59] but what about romans 3 25
[51:03] whom god has set forth to be a
[51:04] propituation through
[51:07] faith in his blood so you've got to put
[51:10] this together with this
[51:11] if we're saved through faith but the
[51:13] bible said we we're saved through faith
[51:15] in his blood we got to put them together
[51:18] faith is the word actually means
[51:20] assurance or
[51:21] trust because it's revealed right right
[51:24] we know faith is revelation
[51:25] so when you have faith god is revealed
[51:28] that you can trust in his word
[51:30] right so we're saved by assurance
[51:33] in the blood of jesus christ praise god
[51:36] that it was shed
[51:38] for our sins and the the righteous died
[51:41] for the unrighteous
[51:42] that the righteousness of the righteous
[51:44] one might come upon the unrighteous
[51:46] praise god
[51:48] amen
[51:51] so see i i do this all the time sister
[51:54] naomi all the time i get quotes like
[51:55] this
[51:56] and i've learned over these uh 15 or 16
[52:00] years of preaching
[52:01] not every word brother adam says now
[52:02] said the lord and you've got to take it
[52:04] back to the bible
[52:05] every time but see people like to be
[52:08] lazy
[52:09] and they don't want to study the bible
[52:10] right we see we've seen preachers
[52:12] they don't want to study so they'll just
[52:14] they'll use any quote just to
[52:15] try to it's a new quote people never
[52:17] heard it try to get them excited
[52:18] but that i mean it's okay to get excited
[52:20] about quotes right so if it's the word
[52:22] of god
[52:23] that's okay but when we when we know in
[52:26] our heart that
[52:26] that something is a little off there or
[52:28] we maybe it doesn't that quote doesn't
[52:31] actually go with all the scripture
[52:32] then we're the ones we're supposed to
[52:34] labor we're supposed to labor and
[52:36] doctrine and the bible gives double
[52:37] honor to those who labor and doctrine
[52:39] praise god
[52:41] god gives a double honor to them and so
[52:43] do his people
[52:44] but see we just don't just draw any
[52:46] quote and not uh
[52:48] and not rightly divide it it's got to be
[52:50] rightly divided
[52:51] all right now and then this one too
[52:54] here's the one
[52:55] brother i'm talking about if we walk in
[52:57] the light as he's the light we have
[52:58] fellowship
[52:58] with one another and the blood of jesus
[53:00] cleanses us see brother i was saying see
[53:02] the blood
[53:03] cleanses you he said it doesn't save you
[53:05] it cleanses you well he had a scripture
[53:06] for that
[53:07] but of course he corrected it later
[53:09] right and he said the blood does save
[53:11] you
[53:12] and the blood keeps you why are you here
[53:14] tonight because the blood cleanses you
[53:16] tonight praise god
[53:18] it cleanse you for your sins this week
[53:20] right we all sin this week we all fell
[53:22] short of god's glory but we had a blood
[53:24] there to cleanse us again praise god
[53:26] in other words cleanse us anew in our
[53:28] minds
[53:30] the blood has forever saved us it's
[53:32] eternally saved us
[53:33] and we're our name is on the book of
[53:36] life praise god
[53:37] but in our minds we and here on earth
[53:39] and time we make
[53:40] mistakes and satan tries to take to take
[53:43] it up to god
[53:44] but and he has a right to condemn us or
[53:46] accuse us
[53:47] as long as we don't confess but once we
[53:49] confess it's forgiven praise god
[53:52] and he cleanses us he cleanses us
[53:54] tonight from all sin praise
[53:56] god yet in god's mind as far as eternity
[53:59] our name is already on the last book of
[54:01] life it's just as good as done
[54:04] but we get current accusations well lord
[54:07] did you see malachi did this
[54:08] lord did you see lydia did that did you
[54:11] see
[54:12] the uh dad did that jesse did that you
[54:13] see that well
[54:15] he's got a right to do that right
[54:17] satan's got a right to accuse
[54:18] but we've got the right to confess
[54:20] praise god and be forgiven amen
[54:23] and to be cleansed so see this proves we
[54:26] must
[54:26] walk in the light of our day
[54:30] that's one thing to believe the signs
[54:31] hate they hate that doctrine but it's
[54:33] scriptural
[54:34] you have to walk in the light of your
[54:37] day acts 19 is the one we read on sunday
[54:39] right we finished with that on sunday
[54:41] morning
[54:42] uh if if the ephesians didn't walk in
[54:45] the light of their day they would have
[54:47] stayed under john's baptism they would
[54:49] have been bold
[54:50] they would have been excited all these
[54:51] things and had scripture
[54:53] but they would not have had the baptism
[54:55] of the holy ghost amen
[54:57] they had to walk in the light of the day
[54:59] and it came through a man
[55:01] it came through paul praise god it came
[55:03] through a prophet he was
[55:05] filled with the holy spirit praise god
[55:07] amen
[55:09] so see the ephesians had to walk in the
[55:13] light with other saints
[55:14] and then jesus blood keeps us clean and
[55:17] it kept them clean as well does that
[55:19] make sense
[55:21] so see church if you ever hear that
[55:22] quote just
[55:24] just kind of hold your peace because you
[55:27] know people are going to use it
[55:28] people preachers love the adoption
[55:29] series right because who doesn't want to
[55:31] be adopted
[55:33] bible says if you got the holy ghost
[55:34] you're adopted or you started the
[55:36] adoption
[55:37] the bible says you finish adoption when
[55:38] you get a new body
[55:40] so if any of us are born again tonight
[55:42] which i'm trusting many of us are
[55:44] if some of us are born again we are in
[55:46] the stages of
[55:47] of adoption if we just got born again
[55:50] we're just brand new to adoption
[55:51] god's showing us now a son and daughter
[55:54] my your name
[55:55] on the word is just as good as my name
[55:58] right right church that's what adoption
[56:01] is
[56:02] you take you take ownership of the
[56:04] family business
[56:06] and jesus said i'm always about my
[56:08] father's business
[56:10] adoption praise god
[56:13] see that's what adoption is you're born
[56:15] again and now
[56:16] you know how the king's business
[56:18] operates amen
[56:20] you know how to run the father's
[56:22] business but you don't know everything
[56:23] right away right but you can be trusted
[56:25] with it
[56:25] and it'll slowly uh the bible said you
[56:28] go from glory
[56:29] to glory from faith to faith he can
[56:32] trust you more and more as long as you
[56:33] stay sincere
[56:34] and as long as you stay cleansed under
[56:36] that blood
[56:37] god will you'll increase your faith
[56:39] you'll increase your your
[56:41] responsibility praise god and you'll be
[56:43] a true servant of god
[56:45] man or woman true servant of god
[56:49] not preaching of course but just serving
[56:50] god doing god's will
[56:52] praying for the sick women can pray for
[56:54] the sick women can cast out devils women
[56:55] can prophesy women can have
[56:57] words of knowledge right words of
[56:59] prophecy right all these
[57:00] words of wisdom now let's get back to
[57:03] the debate here i
[57:04] just want to start a few minutes on that
[57:06] wow so i did 20 minutes 22 minutes on
[57:08] that well just that one thought
[57:10] praise god anyways i hope that helps
[57:13] somebody by god's grace i hope that
[57:14] helps somebody
[57:15] because you know we all i do it all the
[57:17] time brother branson man you just come
[57:18] across
[57:19] thoughts that he was just sharing like
[57:21] the one i shared a few months ago
[57:23] he said he said jesus is not on his
[57:25] throne in heaven he said jesus is in
[57:27] heaven he's on the throne of your heart
[57:29] now can you imagine that jesus is not in
[57:31] heaven
[57:33] but he said it he said it in the church
[57:35] age series in 1960 he said that jesus is
[57:37] not in heaven
[57:38] he's on the throne throwing your heart a
[57:40] few months later he says jesus is on the
[57:42] throne right now
[57:44] well we know he didn't go back and forth
[57:45] we know the body sits there but the
[57:47] spirit is in
[57:48] on the throat of our hearts so he cracks
[57:50] it later
[57:51] but i've heard preachers go and say
[57:53] deity is not in heaven
[57:54] deities in you now can you imagine them
[57:56] saying that god's not in heaven
[57:58] right now god is not in heaven to see
[58:00] church we got to have an understanding
[58:02] we got to be patient and we we can't
[58:04] just swallow anything i'll tell you this
[58:06] a real born again child of god can't
[58:07] swallow everything
[58:09] right you just can't say amen to
[58:12] everything that's preached
[58:13] you got to go study it out yourself
[58:15] right
[58:17] now see that's where they get the bride
[58:20] worship
[58:21] if if there's no jesus in heaven then
[58:23] who you praying to you're just praying
[58:24] to myself
[58:25] oh jesus live in me i'm jesus i'm jesus
[58:29] right the bible said our father which
[58:31] aren't in he said well how do you teach
[58:33] us how to pray jesus
[58:34] my father in heaven that's that's why
[58:37] they get to this place in the
[58:38] philippines they have that bride worship
[58:40] doctrine where we're the bride
[58:42] and we get the we get the worship
[58:43] seekers he ain't in heaven anymore he's
[58:45] in us
[58:47] well the thing is is he is in heaven and
[58:49] he is in us at the same time
[58:51] praise god all right let's look at this
[58:54] uh the brother's third question for me
[58:56] was at what point does exaggeration
[58:59] become
[58:59] lying he just he's got a complex against
[59:02] brother branham he just
[59:03] i love the guy but he's just got a
[59:05] complex so it's so incredibly uh
[59:08] aggressive how could the seventh angel
[59:11] be so lacking in credibility that was
[59:13] his question for me
[59:15] and he gave examples like he said all
[59:17] the details about the 1933
[59:19] ohio river uh baptism
[59:23] and the cl and the pillar of fire coming
[59:24] down he said that was all made up
[59:26] uh visiting buddha's grave confucius is
[59:29] great muhammad's grave he said brother
[59:30] ram never did that
[59:32] he said brother ram wasn't under the
[59:34] arizona cloud
[59:35] he said brother m didn't go around the
[59:37] world seven times so let me share with
[59:39] you
[59:39] a little bit about what i said here uh
[59:42] just give me a moment here that was
[59:43] question what three
[59:44] question three just a moment here
[59:48] all right so here's what i said um i
[59:51] said only
[59:52] god knows at what point exaggeration
[59:54] becomes lying
[59:56] because we've all exaggerated things
[59:58] right and sometimes church humans are
[1:00:01] just forgetful of their memories
[1:00:03] i forget i've forgotten a lot of stories
[1:00:05] over the years
[1:00:07] uh the only way to know is if you talk
[1:00:09] how would you know brother brown was
[1:00:10] lying well you have to talk to him he'd
[1:00:12] have to admit he was lying
[1:00:14] or that's the real the only way either
[1:00:16] god would show you that's the only way
[1:00:17] you would know
[1:00:19] uh that they admitted it on purpose uh
[1:00:25] and brother branham uh he said many
[1:00:26] times he said he said
[1:00:28] i've sinned thousands of times he said
[1:00:29] i'm trusting in the blood
[1:00:31] to forgive me he said when i say i've
[1:00:34] done wrong i said brother forgive me i
[1:00:36] didn't mean to do that
[1:00:37] he said there's blood sacrifice he says
[1:00:41] certainly god knows my
[1:00:42] heart there's power in the gospel that
[1:00:44] holy church moving on
[1:00:46] okay so i'm just trying to show that uh
[1:00:48] brother branham
[1:00:50] we don't know when exaggeration becomes
[1:00:52] line because we're not god
[1:00:54] god would have to show us or uh we have
[1:00:57] to admit it
[1:00:59] now guys you close that door there or
[1:01:01] thanks sister i didn't want to have
[1:01:02] course i asked you something there thank
[1:01:05] you
[1:01:07] i appreciate that thank you so only god
[1:01:09] knows
[1:01:10] now he says how could the seventh angel
[1:01:12] be so lacking credibility
[1:01:14] so i turned it around i said i believe
[1:01:16] brother ram was very credible
[1:01:19] that's what i said he said oh how could
[1:01:21] he be so he's lacking credibility i'm
[1:01:23] like he was extremely credible
[1:01:26] i said especially pointing the people to
[1:01:28] the bible
[1:01:29] right divine healing salvation water
[1:01:32] baptism doctrine
[1:01:34] i met the sister hume she was healed of
[1:01:37] tuberculosis in 1955. i met her
[1:01:40] that sounds pretty credible to me if
[1:01:42] somebody tells you to go weigh yourself
[1:01:43] two mondays in a row
[1:01:45] and you're gonna overcome uh
[1:01:46] tuberculosis that's that's pretty
[1:01:48] credible to me if that happens
[1:01:50] right uh
[1:01:53] and and i said in my own study i've
[1:01:56] heard what brother branham
[1:01:57] preached and i went and acted on it and
[1:01:59] i've cast out devils
[1:02:01] i've seen god stop a woman's bleeding
[1:02:03] i've seen god heal a kidney stone and
[1:02:04] arthritis
[1:02:05] and bring two barren wombs forth with
[1:02:08] babies
[1:02:09] i just saw what he said and the
[1:02:10] brotherhood said it well i believed it
[1:02:12] because it's in the bible praise god
[1:02:14] that's credible to me i don't know about
[1:02:16] you but that's pretty credible to me
[1:02:18] but i agreed i said yes there are
[1:02:21] changes in his stories
[1:02:22] but that comes with anybody
[1:02:25] and i tried to say this brother branham
[1:02:27] was not a scholar
[1:02:29] brother adam drove around constantly
[1:02:31] praying for the sick he just got a
[1:02:32] couple weeks off here and there every
[1:02:34] now and then
[1:02:35] to go rest his body but he was still in
[1:02:38] visions all the time
[1:02:39] still he saw visions and then he had all
[1:02:42] those letters coming into his house
[1:02:44] and then he said the phone rang all day
[1:02:46] that's why i'm glad i got a cell phone
[1:02:48] so i can just turn on silence
[1:02:51] i remember when that stinker used to
[1:02:53] ring all the time and we had a
[1:02:54] landline
[1:02:58] i remember unplugging it at our first
[1:02:59] house lydia won't remember that but i
[1:03:02] unplugged the thing i'm like
[1:03:03] enough of that well brother ram said his
[1:03:04] wife got white hair because of so many
[1:03:06] calls
[1:03:08] and she was what 20 years younger than
[1:03:09] him
[1:03:11] she got white hair because all the calls
[1:03:13] now can you imagine
[1:03:14] trying to study sister beecher's you
[1:03:16] guys are trying to study
[1:03:18] and write down all of your vision sister
[1:03:20] naomi all the visions he had
[1:03:22] and all the prophecies can you imagine
[1:03:24] trying to study that and bring
[1:03:26] bring but today we can
[1:03:30] silence the phone oh i can find where
[1:03:33] brother graham oh this doesn't line up
[1:03:34] this
[1:03:35] this doesn't line up and you can study
[1:03:36] it memorize it you can sound like a
[1:03:38] scholar
[1:03:40] i'm sorry brother man wasn't a scholar
[1:03:42] he was a prophet
[1:03:44] praise god now paul was a scholar and a
[1:03:46] prophet so there's nothing wrong with
[1:03:47] being a scholar
[1:03:48] as long as it's the holy ghost in you
[1:03:50] but see brother brown was this kind of
[1:03:51] man he was
[1:03:52] kind he was a servant he was given his
[1:03:54] life for the gospel praise god he wasn't
[1:03:56] a scholar like many people get to be
[1:03:58] today
[1:04:00] and i said it's impossible for you i
[1:04:03] told this man
[1:04:04] to say all those examples are false i
[1:04:06] said because you weren't there
[1:04:10] right and i and i even told this i said
[1:04:14] i've heard brother tell those stories
[1:04:15] and on some of those stories
[1:04:17] he'll say now brother so-so you were
[1:04:19] there can you say amen so that they can
[1:04:20] get you on the tape
[1:04:23] the very same stories they say
[1:04:24] brother-in-law lied on yeah brother man
[1:04:26] will call i love how he does that
[1:04:28] because he wants there to be a witness
[1:04:29] against it
[1:04:31] right now look here's what i told him i
[1:04:33] said now as far as the 1933 ohio river
[1:04:37] uh well i'm sorry i got these mixed up
[1:04:38] that was the municipal bridge i'm sorry
[1:04:41] so change this in your mind to the
[1:04:42] municipal bridge the prophecy
[1:04:44] brother ram said he predicted 16 men
[1:04:47] died right
[1:04:48] now there's only two men that died on
[1:04:50] record at least in jeffersonville's
[1:04:52] record
[1:04:54] well there's a couple things perhaps
[1:04:56] brother brown forgot the number of men
[1:04:58] from the vision maybe he said to
[1:05:00] maybe he said hey we don't know because
[1:05:02] we don't have the original recording
[1:05:04] or perhaps the construction company
[1:05:06] covered up more deaths
[1:05:08] which they cover up all the time church
[1:05:10] i've talked to saints in new york
[1:05:12] they saw the twin towers fall and they
[1:05:15] know it was an inside job
[1:05:17] and yet today they say oh it was the
[1:05:19] taliban or whatever
[1:05:21] a bunch of nonsense see i'm not a
[1:05:24] conspiracy theorist
[1:05:25] but i know when there's a conspiracy and
[1:05:27] i know when it's not a theory praise god
[1:05:30] and so uh a construction company covered
[1:05:32] up 16 people that wouldn't be any
[1:05:34] problem at all there's a video on
[1:05:36] youtube
[1:05:37] uh of a man in jeffersonville who
[1:05:39] doesn't believe brother ram's a prophet
[1:05:41] but he's interviewed and he remembers
[1:05:43] his parents talking about the 16 people
[1:05:45] dying on the bridge
[1:05:48] but yet there's no record in the
[1:05:49] government of jeffersonville
[1:05:51] who cares that doesn't so
[1:05:54] it comes out of this i can't prove 16
[1:05:56] men died neither can he
[1:05:59] he can't prove 16 men didn't die
[1:06:02] right so what does it come down to a
[1:06:04] prophet's word against these guys word
[1:06:06] and i'll take that prophet's word
[1:06:08] anytime praise god i'll take that every
[1:06:10] time amen
[1:06:11] because he's credible with the word
[1:06:13] praise god he's credible as a man of god
[1:06:17] now the ohio river now that one i didn't
[1:06:18] get a chance to study
[1:06:20] but there's people i've heard in the
[1:06:21] congregation they testified it now they
[1:06:23] say
[1:06:24] there was only a hundred people there
[1:06:25] when brother graham baptized those 17.
[1:06:27] i'm sorry baptized and this and this on
[1:06:29] the 17th one the pillar of fire came
[1:06:31] down and said as john the baptist was
[1:06:33] full run
[1:06:34] for forerunner the first coming so will
[1:06:36] you forerun the second coming
[1:06:38] well these guys leave the signs say it
[1:06:40] never happened
[1:06:42] but there's people that were witnesses
[1:06:44] and said it did well watching brother
[1:06:46] ministry knowing he talked to angels
[1:06:49] seeing his discernment i believe it
[1:06:51] and they can't prove it didn't happen
[1:06:52] because they weren't there praise god
[1:06:57] now visiting buddha confucius muhammad's
[1:07:00] graves
[1:07:01] on the on the on the debate i say show
[1:07:03] me some proof
[1:07:05] i said you've shown me no proof and and
[1:07:07] all they say
[1:07:08] they don't they don't say any proof on
[1:07:10] the debate they just say he lied
[1:07:13] and that's why some people say i won the
[1:07:14] debate because i actually gave bible
[1:07:16] examples real examples
[1:07:18] but this guy said well show me some
[1:07:20] proof in fact my question was
[1:07:22] you've made all these assumptions and
[1:07:24] you've never showed any proof of it
[1:07:26] are you just assuming he said no and so
[1:07:29] i was waiting to hear the proof
[1:07:30] and there was none it was just like no
[1:07:33] he lied about this he lied about that
[1:07:34] lied about that lied about that
[1:07:36] i'm sorry you couldn't that wouldn't
[1:07:37] work in a court of law church
[1:07:40] just saying jesse lied or so-and-so lied
[1:07:44] show me some proof right you got to show
[1:07:47] you got to present something they don't
[1:07:48] present anything
[1:07:50] there's no so i'm just going to believe
[1:07:51] brother brown that he did visit those
[1:07:53] graves i don't know that he did
[1:07:54] but neither do you know that he didn't
[1:07:57] the only way to know is to follow him
[1:07:59] along around his whole entire life
[1:08:02] right that's the only way you would know
[1:08:04] that he lied or anything like that which
[1:08:06] i don't believe he did
[1:08:07] now there are quotes where ram said he
[1:08:10] was under the cloud when the picture was
[1:08:11] taken
[1:08:12] by his own receipts brother brahm was
[1:08:14] not in
[1:08:15] arizona on february 28th but
[1:08:19] he could have been there by vision and
[1:08:21] that's what ezekiel
[1:08:23] 8 15 is ezekiel sitting in uh
[1:08:26] saudi arabia i think or iraq and the
[1:08:29] bible said god
[1:08:30] picks him up by the lox and carries them
[1:08:32] a hundred miles
[1:08:33] right back to the temple of jerusalem
[1:08:35] that was by vision
[1:08:37] so brother adam could have been he was
[1:08:39] in texas at that time
[1:08:41] he could have been taken by vision and
[1:08:43] he could have been under that cloud
[1:08:45] when the picture was taken on february
[1:08:46] 28th
[1:08:48] right but either way even if he wasn't
[1:08:51] brother ram never
[1:08:52] said this he never said he never said
[1:08:54] thus saith the lord i was under that
[1:08:56] when it was taken he never said that he
[1:08:59] just said he did
[1:09:00] he just said he was there but it wasn't
[1:09:02] thus saith the lord
[1:09:03] now the cloud was prophesied of
[1:09:06] right the cloud was in the name of the
[1:09:08] lord this is going to happen
[1:09:10] he called it a pyramid before he called
[1:09:11] in the cloud so that was thus saith the
[1:09:14] lord and it happened
[1:09:15] amen praise god amen so see
[1:09:18] now and they see they say oh there was a
[1:09:21] it was a thor rocket that made that
[1:09:23] cloud
[1:09:24] well it might have been but it might not
[1:09:26] been and the other thing is they're
[1:09:27] using the data which they they weren't
[1:09:29] even a witness of it
[1:09:31] so see they're taking information that
[1:09:33] they're not a witness
[1:09:34] of and saying this proves it was a a lie
[1:09:37] that was just your witness
[1:09:38] anybody can make up a false document a
[1:09:40] government document
[1:09:42] in fact that's what they're trying to
[1:09:43] get trump for now that russian document
[1:09:45] that was all made up by the democrats
[1:09:47] and they're finding that out now that
[1:09:49] whole russian uh conspiracy theory
[1:09:51] that was all laid up and they're finding
[1:09:52] documents now but they made up documents
[1:09:55] to make it look like
[1:09:57] he was interacting with the russians and
[1:10:00] i'm not a
[1:10:01] uh i'm not a foo i didn't even vote for
[1:10:03] trump the first time i'll probably vote
[1:10:04] for him this time
[1:10:05] uh but i'm not a trump conspiracy
[1:10:08] theorist or anything like that
[1:10:09] i wouldn't even vote for the man the
[1:10:10] first time but it's it's
[1:10:13] it's an idea where you can't make a
[1:10:14] document thus say the lord
[1:10:16] the bible thus saith the lord praise god
[1:10:19] now did he go seven times around the
[1:10:21] world
[1:10:22] i don't know but they didn't show me any
[1:10:24] proof like how could you show me proof
[1:10:27] he never went around the world seven
[1:10:29] times how could you prove that
[1:10:30] another way is the other idea is he
[1:10:32] never said this he never said thus saith
[1:10:34] the lord i'm going around the world
[1:10:36] seven times he never said that
[1:10:37] so it's not about saith the lord
[1:10:41] and i still asked i said show me one
[1:10:42] shred of evidence they couldn't show me
[1:10:44] anything
[1:10:47] so here's some additional thoughts oh
[1:10:49] yeah they said brother graham's
[1:10:50] introduction to pentecostalism was was
[1:10:52] wrong remember how he said he went to
[1:10:53] mishawaka
[1:10:54] and he met the pentecostals there and he
[1:10:57] preached for them remember that
[1:10:58] story he said they said brother man made
[1:11:00] that all up but i've never studied the
[1:11:01] topic
[1:11:02] but their newspaper article is and thus
[1:11:04] saith the lord
[1:11:05] so they they have a newspaper article
[1:11:07] that says brother branham went to a
[1:11:08] pentecostal tabernacle
[1:11:10] roy e davis was his pastor and brother
[1:11:13] ram said
[1:11:14] see i never was a pentecostal until i
[1:11:16] met the chewaka pentecostals
[1:11:18] and so they see say see uh he went to
[1:11:20] pentecostal church he lied that's not
[1:11:23] that newspaper doesn't prove anything
[1:11:25] right
[1:11:26] it could have had a pentecostal name
[1:11:28] without the experience
[1:11:30] praise god just like a lot of people
[1:11:33] have a luther name but they don't have
[1:11:35] the luther experience
[1:11:37] luther had the experience his testimony
[1:11:40] says
[1:11:40] that the just shall live by faith fell
[1:11:43] like lightning from heaven praise god
[1:11:45] amen have you ever had a scripture fall
[1:11:48] like lightning from heaven and zap you
[1:11:51] praise god that's what martin luther had
[1:11:53] now how many luthers
[1:11:55] have that experience hardly any
[1:11:59] where it actually falls it falls from
[1:12:01] heaven and it transforms your life
[1:12:03] and instead of going along with the
[1:12:04] system you try to change the system
[1:12:08] i don't think many lutherans have had
[1:12:09] that same experience
[1:12:11] so it's possible it's possible his his
[1:12:14] church's name
[1:12:14] roy davis name was pentecostal but they
[1:12:17] didn't have the experience
[1:12:18] or it's possible that's a false
[1:12:20] newspaper article and it wasn't true it
[1:12:22] was just doctored up
[1:12:24] we don't know we weren't there neither
[1:12:27] was he
[1:12:28] neither was glee the sign they weren't
[1:12:29] there either
[1:12:32] and they say brother ram never saw
[1:12:34] vicarius filet day at the vatican
[1:12:36] although he said it numerous times
[1:12:39] well i said prove it they didn't have
[1:12:42] any proof
[1:12:42] they just said he lied well you don't
[1:12:45] get away with that right you can't do
[1:12:46] that in a court of law
[1:12:48] you can't say somebody lied without
[1:12:49] proof as i said
[1:12:51] they you know what they would do they
[1:12:53] dismiss that and that's what we do we
[1:12:54] that's why we dismiss their lies
[1:12:56] right we dismiss their assumptions we
[1:12:59] dismiss their
[1:13:00] uh uh their attacks because we know
[1:13:03] brother man preached this word
[1:13:05] and that's what we live on the word of
[1:13:06] god that he preached
[1:13:08] amen i'm almost out of time here
[1:13:13] now so i said he was extremely credible
[1:13:17] with the word truth healing i said it's
[1:13:19] impossible to say all these are false
[1:13:20] because he wasn't there
[1:13:22] offered no proof now there's a few
[1:13:24] things i didn't get to i'm going to skip
[1:13:26] these tonight
[1:13:27] uh yeah he makes all these he
[1:13:30] misinterprets john
[1:13:32] 16 13 and he says the flagstaff uh cloud
[1:13:35] was one of the biggest lies that's a
[1:13:37] that's a bunch of nonsense that's a
[1:13:38] bunch of nonsense
[1:13:40] let me get to something uh i got a
[1:13:42] little more time on
[1:13:43] uh now here's a little more on the cloud
[1:13:46] uh remember the four
[1:13:47] four points on the cloud it's believe
[1:13:49] the signs word against brother branham
[1:13:51] the thor rocket that is not the absolute
[1:13:53] brother braham said never said thus
[1:13:55] saith the lord i was under the cloud
[1:13:56] when the photo was taken so it's not a
[1:13:57] prophecy
[1:13:59] the the vision of the seven angels was
[1:14:01] prophesied in the name of the lord
[1:14:02] and brother could have been there by
[1:14:04] vision according to ezekiel 8 15.
[1:14:07] yeah let's finish with the godhead can
[1:14:08] we finish with the godhead i know
[1:14:10] y'all like the godhead right
[1:14:15] i love it praise god oh my the more i
[1:14:16] think about it the more i enjoy it
[1:14:18] so my third question is i heard on their
[1:14:22] uh
[1:14:22] i heard on their podcast he had a he had
[1:14:25] a muslim turned christian he interviewed
[1:14:27] a muslim turned christian
[1:14:28] and there they spent like three podcasts
[1:14:30] discussing the godhead
[1:14:32] and the guy said well really three
[1:14:34] persons is like three minds
[1:14:37] and i was like what
[1:14:40] i'm like oh my goodness and that it
[1:14:42] stuck with me because you know i've
[1:14:43] listened to almost all their podcasts
[1:14:45] because i like to prove them wrong
[1:14:47] because that's what god's called us to
[1:14:48] do he said uh answer all things the
[1:14:50] bible said
[1:14:51] ever have an answer for every man for
[1:14:52] the hope that lies within us
[1:14:54] that's first peter 3 15. and i heard
[1:14:56] that thought three separate minds
[1:14:59] and so i said so my question was does
[1:15:01] god have three separate minds as your
[1:15:03] podcast said and if so
[1:15:04] which scriptures explicitly teach
[1:15:08] this and claim he's three persons
[1:15:13] okay so i'll close with this just give
[1:15:15] me a few more minutes okay
[1:15:16] so he starts off by saying i
[1:15:18] misunderstood the podcast
[1:15:20] no i didn't i understood exactly what he
[1:15:23] said
[1:15:24] or the other guy said now he has he has
[1:15:26] some good scriptures here
[1:15:28] go to romans 8 27 let's read that one
[1:15:30] romans 8 27
[1:15:33] i'll say it like this god doesn't have
[1:15:35] three minds
[1:15:36] but god has a divine mind but jesus's
[1:15:40] humanity has a different mind
[1:15:43] okay did you catch that the eternal
[1:15:46] spirit of god has only one mind
[1:15:48] but god made himself an image a body
[1:15:51] that did have a human mind and it wasn't
[1:15:55] exactly the same
[1:15:56] because it was limited on purpose
[1:16:01] now i don't want to say god has two
[1:16:03] minds i'm not saying that
[1:16:06] god has one mind but his son has a human
[1:16:09] mind
[1:16:11] and that human mind listen church i hope
[1:16:13] this is clear that human mind
[1:16:15] while it was on earth was not equal to
[1:16:18] god's mind because jesus said i don't
[1:16:21] know the day or the hour of my second
[1:16:23] coming
[1:16:25] so that human mind of jesus was not
[1:16:27] divine does everybody understand that
[1:16:30] jesus said who touched me and he didn't
[1:16:32] know but ramsay wasn't lying he wasn't
[1:16:34] lying he said who touched me the woman
[1:16:35] with the blood issue
[1:16:36] he didn't know right jesus said i only
[1:16:40] do that which i
[1:16:41] see the father do amen praise god he
[1:16:44] said i do nothing of myself
[1:16:46] but what i see the father do
[1:16:49] so see we god doesn't have two minds god
[1:16:52] has
[1:16:52] one mind but he allowed his son his
[1:16:55] image to have a human mind but now
[1:16:57] now this is why i'm not sure this is
[1:16:59] where we gotta this is further
[1:17:00] revelation
[1:17:01] now is that mind fully the mind of god
[1:17:04] i don't know does jesus right now know
[1:17:07] the day and the hour
[1:17:08] i don't know if anybody does let me know
[1:17:13] i don't know does jesus human body right
[1:17:15] now it's a glorified body sitting on the
[1:17:17] throne
[1:17:18] does that human body that glorified mind
[1:17:21] does that glorified mind know the day
[1:17:24] and the hour
[1:17:24] i don't know well
[1:17:28] i guess we'll find out i don't know
[1:17:31] i because because church brother brahm
[1:17:34] says when we get a theophany if you die
[1:17:36] you get a theophany he calls it a word
[1:17:37] body
[1:17:38] he says it's the word body so you
[1:17:40] believe the word
[1:17:41] but even paul and his word body doesn't
[1:17:44] know the day of the hour
[1:17:46] because jesus said only the father knows
[1:17:49] the day of the hour
[1:17:51] okay so even our idea of a word body
[1:17:53] well that's got to have a little
[1:17:55] tweaking to it
[1:17:56] because it doesn't know everything if
[1:17:58] that's the case then
[1:17:59] we won't need god for out eternity but
[1:18:01] eventually he's going to answer our
[1:18:02] questions all throughout eternity
[1:18:04] well if we knew everything we wouldn't
[1:18:06] ask any questions
[1:18:07] right so some of these things we've
[1:18:11] heard and thought
[1:18:12] and believed all these years sometimes
[1:18:13] we need correction right
[1:18:16] we've got to be careful what we say what
[1:18:17] we believe
[1:18:20] now romans 8 27 you got it malcolm
[1:18:24] that's okay no that's okay i got it i
[1:18:26] didn't know if you had it i didn't ask
[1:18:27] you my fault
[1:18:28] uh here's where it says the holy spirit
[1:18:30] has a mind
[1:18:31] and he that searches the hearts knoweth
[1:18:33] what is the mind of the spirit
[1:18:36] because he maketh the intercession for
[1:18:38] the saints according to will of god okay
[1:18:40] so see so brother the brother rod saying
[1:18:42] see there's three different minds
[1:18:44] but it's one person i'm sorry three
[1:18:46] different persons with three different
[1:18:47] minds but one god
[1:18:48] that's what he says so there's the mind
[1:18:51] of the spirit
[1:18:51] and then first corinthians 2 16 says the
[1:18:54] mind of christ
[1:18:55] and paul said in philippians 2 he
[1:18:56] preached it a few months ago we must
[1:18:58] have the mind of christ
[1:18:59] so he's he uses scripture to show it
[1:19:02] looks like there's three minds but
[1:19:03] there's not three minds
[1:19:06] right there's one divine mind and then
[1:19:08] there's one human mind of jesus
[1:19:10] because the mind of the spirit is the
[1:19:12] mind of the father how many can say amen
[1:19:14] to that
[1:19:15] the father is not a different person
[1:19:17] than the holy spirit jesus had two dads
[1:19:20] right jesus admitted he didn't know all
[1:19:22] things he prayed to avoid the cross
[1:19:25] and he says the trinity is the only way
[1:19:27] to explain jesus humanity i don't
[1:19:29] believe that
[1:19:30] our way is the only way to understand
[1:19:32] jesus humanity
[1:19:34] right god is invisible so jesus is the
[1:19:37] image of the invisible god
[1:19:40] right and this this brother even said
[1:19:43] god died on the cross
[1:19:45] god the spirit did not die on the cross
[1:19:48] you can't
[1:19:48] kill a spirit on a cross praise god
[1:19:52] you can't kill a spirit right god's the
[1:19:54] one who's got to get rid of he's got to
[1:19:56] annihilate that spirit
[1:19:58] i'm talking about demons now right and
[1:20:00] satan
[1:20:01] god's the only one that can annihilate a
[1:20:03] spirit you can't nail a spirit onto the
[1:20:05] physical cross and yet that brother
[1:20:06] believes god died on the cross
[1:20:08] well i said a image of god died the son
[1:20:11] of god died
[1:20:12] the lamb of god died the temple of god
[1:20:15] died but god the spirit did not die
[1:20:18] amen think man what do these people
[1:20:21] think
[1:20:24] some of them don't think as much as they
[1:20:25] think they do
[1:20:27] they don't think as much as they think
[1:20:29] they do
[1:20:31] he kept saying i don't believe in three
[1:20:32] gods and i said i i said i know you say
[1:20:34] that
[1:20:35] but you're teaching you're creating say
[1:20:37] that the creed say
[1:20:39] the father is not the son and the son is
[1:20:42] not the holy spirit and the holy spirit
[1:20:43] is not the
[1:20:43] the father the creed say it
[1:20:47] oh they say uh almost like 99
[1:20:50] they don't come out and say three gods
[1:20:52] but if one is not the other and they're
[1:20:54] all three out the other that's got to be
[1:20:55] three
[1:20:56] there's got to be three gods
[1:21:00] and they quoted augustine which this man
[1:21:02] turned out to be a pretty awful man
[1:21:04] he said augustine of hippo he's the one
[1:21:07] that gave the catholic church the right
[1:21:09] to kill people
[1:21:10] if they wouldn't uh proselyte into the
[1:21:13] catholic church
[1:21:14] remember that that was saint augustine
[1:21:17] hippo
[1:21:18] he said if you deny the trinity you'll
[1:21:19] lose your soul so he said try to
[1:21:21] describe it you'll lose your mind
[1:21:25] and then his question he said jesse he
[1:21:27] said what giant of the faith of the last
[1:21:30] 500 years
[1:21:31] would deny the trinity
[1:21:36] and i said well i said i heard no
[1:21:37] scripture for three minds
[1:21:39] i said but the spirit's mind is the same
[1:21:41] as the father's mind the trinity
[1:21:43] essentially teaches three gods because
[1:21:45] the creed says the father's not the
[1:21:46] spirit
[1:21:47] did jesus have two fathers i said the
[1:21:49] revelation of the one person that god
[1:21:50] had was lost
[1:21:51] at the beginning of the church ages
[1:21:52] jesus taught it he said a woman
[1:21:55] injected three measures of leaven in the
[1:21:57] bread that was father son holy ghost
[1:22:01] at the beginning of the church age then
[1:22:02] it grew in this 11
[1:22:04] lump and that's what their religion is
[1:22:06] 11. church we should have a
[1:22:08] unleavened church here praise god we
[1:22:11] should have a sin free church praise god
[1:22:13] because we don't have any false doctrine
[1:22:15] injected into our faith
[1:22:16] we should have a pure unleavened gospel
[1:22:19] praise god
[1:22:20] amen hallelujah thank you jesus
[1:22:24] if there is any leaven let's ask god to
[1:22:26] get it out
[1:22:29] and what does it produce now it produces
[1:22:31] pedophilia
[1:22:33] all right every nation under heaven
[1:22:35] where the catholic church is
[1:22:36] there's sex abuse claims everywhere
[1:22:38] every single one of them
[1:22:40] that's what their fathers and holy
[1:22:41] ghosts produced so you get one thing
[1:22:43] wrong it'll start leading them you'll
[1:22:45] get another thing wrong
[1:22:46] another thing wrong another thing wrong
[1:22:48] and i said paul never taught
[1:22:50] three persons i said jesus had a human
[1:22:52] mind
[1:22:53] but brother adam said thus saith the
[1:22:54] lord trinity is the of the devil
[1:22:56] but they can still be saved because the
[1:22:58] trinity is not salvation
[1:22:59] the trinity is a mystery right because
[1:23:02] there's no trinity it's the godhead as
[1:23:04] one person
[1:23:06] and i'm gonna close with this thought
[1:23:07] down here
[1:23:10] oh yeah he said can you he challenges me
[1:23:12] he said jesse said can you point out one
[1:23:14] giant of faith
[1:23:15] in the last 500 years who believed in
[1:23:17] one person i said i don't know any giant
[1:23:20] uh who believed in one person but it's
[1:23:22] not required for salvation but i said
[1:23:24] all the bible writers were true giants
[1:23:27] including jesus and they all taught god
[1:23:29] was one person
[1:23:31] so he talked about all the giants the
[1:23:32] last 500 years well i went back to the
[1:23:34] last 2000 years
[1:23:36] what about those giants that wrote the
[1:23:38] bible praise god amen
[1:23:41] i'm not talking about the giants the
[1:23:42] last five years the real giant was jesus
[1:23:44] amen he was the
[1:23:45] giant praise god the giant of faith the
[1:23:47] giant of deity praise god
[1:23:50] amen these teachers see how they with
[1:23:53] their words they try to trap you
[1:23:55] so i said i'm not looking at this 500
[1:23:57] i'm looking at the beginning
[1:23:59] paul was a giant of faith james
[1:24:02] john peter praise god these giants of
[1:24:05] faith never taught god was three persons
[1:24:07] he's one
[1:24:08] one person let's stand to our feet i
[1:24:10] better stop
[1:24:15] i said jesus and the bible writers all
[1:24:17] taught monotheism
[1:24:19] not triatheism that's what they teach
[1:24:23] triath trithesism is three gods that's
[1:24:26] basically what they teach they won't say
[1:24:27] it but it's basically what they teach
[1:24:31] did i have something else i really want
[1:24:33] important i want to say
[1:24:39] yeah as you're saying i'm going to just
[1:24:40] read proverbs 30 verse 5 and say and
[1:24:42] this is one regret i wish i would've had
[1:24:43] i wish you would have labored more on
[1:24:44] this
[1:24:48] proverbs 30 5 and 6 especially for the
[1:24:51] godhead
[1:24:53] now church here's one of the biggest uh
[1:24:56] concerns i got about the godhead
[1:25:00] now all these got now he's talking about
[1:25:01] all these people that lived 500 years
[1:25:03] ago
[1:25:04] no in that age church 500 years ago they
[1:25:06] had this saying called sola scripture
[1:25:08] which means by scripture alone i've
[1:25:10] never heard of that
[1:25:11] sola scriptura luther used it wesley
[1:25:14] they all used it
[1:25:15] they wanted to be sola scriptura by
[1:25:17] scripture alone
[1:25:19] they all want to say i just use
[1:25:20] scripture alone i'll only use scripture
[1:25:22] alone
[1:25:23] and these brothers say the same thing
[1:25:24] they only use scripture
[1:25:27] but what about proverbs 35 and 6 every
[1:25:29] word of god is pure
[1:25:31] he's a shield unto them that put their
[1:25:33] trust in him add thou not unto his words
[1:25:35] lest he reprove thee
[1:25:37] and thou be found a liar
[1:25:41] so the same people that say we're only
[1:25:43] scripture only scripture only scripture
[1:25:44] they're the ones that say he's three
[1:25:46] persons he's got three minds
[1:25:49] and the bible says they're gonna be
[1:25:51] found liars
[1:25:53] because they claim i only use the bible
[1:25:54] i only use the bible but then they
[1:25:56] add their lie in there in order to fit
[1:25:59] their agenda right and fill their
[1:26:00] churches
[1:26:01] of course a lot of them now because the
[1:26:03] covenant are getting
[1:26:04] they're actually decreasing but they'll
[1:26:07] say anything
[1:26:08] to keep the people in there rather than
[1:26:10] tell them just the word of god
[1:26:12] look what happens when we just tell the
[1:26:13] people the word of god
[1:26:15] you find out who really loves god right
[1:26:18] they'll hang around for you
[1:26:19] a few services never see them again
[1:26:21] right because they don't love the word
[1:26:22] of god
[1:26:23] but all of us that love the word of god
[1:26:25] that believe every word of god is pure
[1:26:27] we hang around because it's what we live
[1:26:29] for
[1:26:30] it is our life musicians if you'll come
[1:26:33] the word of god is our life
[1:26:34] so i got a few more i think we got maybe
[1:26:36] one or two more
[1:26:38] messages yeah and then i got i still got
[1:26:40] another hour to go through on the
[1:26:42] on the debate i hope that's a help by
[1:26:44] god's grace is that okay church by god's
[1:26:46] grace is that okay
[1:26:47] hope everybody enjoyed that tonight
[1:26:52] the scripture is clear the scripture is
[1:26:55] clear
[1:26:56] that men of god are credible yet they're
[1:26:58] fallible sometimes in their human mind
[1:27:00] they make mistakes but they won't make a
[1:27:03] mistake with thus saith the lord
[1:27:06] the church we can rest assured that god
[1:27:09] has revealed the mystery of
[1:27:10] the godhead to us and we're just
[1:27:12] clinging to scripture alone
[1:27:14] we're going to cleave to the pure word
[1:27:17] of god
[1:27:18] how many believe god is your shield
[1:27:19] tonight amen the bible said faith
[1:27:22] is a shield bob said every word of god
[1:27:24] is a shield
[1:27:25] everywhere god is pure the word of god
[1:27:27] is your shield against those lies
[1:27:31] let's thank god for that tonight by
[1:27:33] god's grace let's have a word of prayer
[1:27:34] let's bow our heads here
[1:27:37] [Music]

[1:27:48] guess a little zealous tonight
[1:27:50] for the truth
