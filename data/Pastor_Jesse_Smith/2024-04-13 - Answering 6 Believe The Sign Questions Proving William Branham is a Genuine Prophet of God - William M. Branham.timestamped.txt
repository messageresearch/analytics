[0:02] what about the people that believe in
[0:05] the Lord now and don't and not the way
[0:09] you preach they don't have to believe
[0:11] this they don't have to believe the way
[0:12] I preach it see don't have to believe
[0:14] that but those who can accept the word
[0:16] in its fullness not me preaching it
[0:18] because it's a Bible
[0:21] sessle greetings friends in the
[0:23] matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[0:26] the purpose of this video is to answer
[0:28] respectfully a challenge from the
[0:30] believe the sign YouTube channel and the
[0:32] challenge was to answer their six simple
[0:34] questions so I'm going to do that now by
[0:36] the grace of God hi friends I'm Jesse
[0:39] Smith pastor bride of Christ Fellowship
[0:41] here in akan Ohio USA and I defend the
[0:44] bible-based ministry of God's Prophet
[0:47] The Late William brandham 1909 to 1965
[0:50] Jesus Christ revealed Revelations to
[0:52] brother brandham and also defend brother
[0:54] bram's Godly character so by God's grace
[0:56] I'll give six brief answers to these
[0:58] questions the believe the sign website
[1:01] said they have asked a couple of really
[1:03] simple questions which have never been
[1:04] answered by message ministers or message
[1:07] Believers so by God's grace let's answer
[1:09] them number one can you please show us
[1:11] where William brandham is Vindicated as
[1:13] a prophet of God scripturally yes that's
[1:16] easy to do by God's grace uh one video I
[1:19] have goes over five requirements of a
[1:21] genuine prophet of God here's the
[1:23] screenshots you can see it requirements
[1:25] of a genuine
[1:26] prophet and this is from the video three
[1:29] Prophecies of William brandham it's my
[1:31] sixth video it was released October 4th
[1:34] 2014 I'll leave a link in the
[1:36] description to this so requirement one
[1:38] he had to live a Godly life of Holiness
[1:41] and that brother random did he taught
[1:43] the word of God in its Purity that he
[1:45] did had converts to Christ as fruit of
[1:47] his ministry that he did and number four
[1:50] is really important reveal secrets from
[1:53] the Bible that were previously hidden
[1:55] according to Amos 37 brother random
[1:57] certainly did this the main Secrets
[1:59] brother random revealed
[2:00] through Jesus Christ were the revelation
[2:03] of the Seven Seals of course and I have
[2:05] multiple videos about this subject and I
[2:08] proved by God's grace there's over 38
[2:10] differences between brother ROM's
[2:11] Revelation from Jesus Christ on the
[2:13] Seven Seals compared to the teachings of
[2:16] Clarence Larin Charles T Russell and
[2:17] Uriah Smith and of course this is the
[2:20] information that believe the sign will
[2:22] ignore for example with the first seal
[2:25] believe the sign says brother random
[2:27] plagiarized it that's a lie Clarence Lin
[2:31] said the first seal is during the Great
[2:33] Tribulation period which is still yet in
[2:36] the future brother Ram said the first
[2:37] seal started at the beginning of the New
[2:39] Testament Church nearly 2,000 years ago
[2:42] so any honest person knows brother Ram
[2:44] did not plagiarize the Seven Seals in
[2:46] fact there's only one seal that brother
[2:48] brandom had the same as Lin and that's
[2:50] the Sixth Seal also my 2021 book The 12
[2:53] New Testament Mysteries shows many more
[2:55] secrets that Jesus Christ revealed to
[2:58] brother brandham and of course to
[3:00] fulfill Revelation 10:7 to finish the
[3:02] mysteries of God and then the fifth
[3:04] requirement for a prophet was having the
[3:06] anointing of the Holy Ghost for
[3:07] Supernatural signs and prophecies
[3:10] brother Bram had many Supernatural
[3:11] testimonies of healings and prophecies
[3:14] regarding prophecies there was at least
[3:16] six prophecies brother R spoke in the
[3:18] name of Jesus Christ or in the name of
[3:20] the Lord that have come to pass it is
[3:22] undeniable brother random was a genuine
[3:24] prophet of God and I put that video out
[3:27] on August 23rd 202 3 6 thus sayith the
[3:31] Lord statements from William brandom
[3:33] that have come to pass it's video number
[3:36] 173 question number two why did William
[3:39] brandom change his mind and his
[3:40] doctrines through his ministry on topics
[3:42] such as the Trinity and water baptism
[3:45] and the verbal formula or
[3:47] formula that's simple you know 2 Peter
[3:50] 3:18 says but grow in Grace and in the
[3:53] knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[3:54] Christ so every Christian grows in Grace
[3:57] and grows in the knowledge of the Lord
[3:59] Jes Jesus Christ and the man who wrote
[4:01] this Peter he definitely grew in Grace
[4:03] and knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ
[4:05] even though he was called by Jesus to be
[4:08] an apostle while Jesus was alive on this
[4:10] Earth and then of course got the holy
[4:12] ghost in the book of Acts chapter 2 and
[4:14] then ministered for Jesus Christ the
[4:16] rest of his days and Peter of course
[4:19] grew in Grace and knowledge of the lord
[4:20] we see that in Galatians Chapter 2 where
[4:22] Peter had separated himself from
[4:24] fellowshipping with the Gentiles and he
[4:27] was already a holy ghost filled man he
[4:28] was already a prophet and of course this
[4:30] will get into an answer to a future
[4:32] question as well but every believer
[4:35] grows in Grace and knowledge of the Lord
[4:37] Jesus Christ that's what Jesus Promised
[4:39] in John 16:13 when the spirit of Truth
[4:42] is come he will guide you into all truth
[4:44] so once the Holy Ghost comes upon a
[4:46] person they're born again the Holy Ghost
[4:48] will guide them into all truth and again
[4:50] we see that through the life of Peter of
[4:52] course so brother Ram had to change his
[4:54] mind because the Holy Ghost was
[4:55] revealing more truth to him just as St
[4:58] Peter and Jesus said would happen
[5:00] regarding the Trinity though the Trinity
[5:02] is a false Doctrine it wasn't started by
[5:04] the apostles it was started over 300
[5:06] years after the apostles or around 300
[5:08] years I've got an entire video on that
[5:10] so I'll put a link in the description
[5:11] for that and the Trinity Dogma adds to
[5:14] the word of God so that's a lie that's
[5:16] false Doctrine that's heresy and God
[5:19] revealed to brother brandham that God is
[5:21] one person not three persons there is no
[5:23] verse that says God is three persons in
[5:26] fact Hebrews 1:3 says Jesus is the
[5:28] express image of the person of God
[5:30] there's only one person in the godhead
[5:33] that's according to the Bible
[5:35] furthermore again in my book The 12 New
[5:37] Testament mysteries from 2021 I show
[5:39] brother Brandon restored 14 Pauline
[5:42] doctrines that most churches miss or
[5:44] teach falsely about so brother raham
[5:47] turn the hearts of the children back to
[5:48] the apostolic fathers also eight of
[5:51] those doctrines have thus sayith the
[5:52] Lord behind them so of course because
[5:55] these doctrines are true brother Rams
[5:58] thus say the Lord's statement gives
[6:00] Authority and validation that these
[6:01] doctrines are right they're part of the
[6:04] apostolic faith the original Faith it's
[6:06] the one faith that we must earnestly
[6:08] contend for according to the book of
[6:09] Jude verse three I also want to say I
[6:12] hope brother Rams accusers are not
[6:14] asking this question with a
[6:15] self-righteous attitude acting like they
[6:18] know it all and they don't have anything
[6:20] to learn I'm sure each one of brother
[6:22] Ram's accusers have something to learn
[6:23] about the Bible it's obvious they do
[6:26] because they falsely accuse brother
[6:28] brandom they don't understand true Bible
[6:30] Doctrine and they don't understand all
[6:32] the scriptures about conditional
[6:33] Promises of God among other things so
[6:36] please accusers of brother brandham
[6:38] please don't be self-righteous and act
[6:39] like you don't learn anything and you
[6:42] know it all already because you don't
[6:44] numerous times brother brandham said
[6:45] anyone who claims to know it all is
[6:48] wrong brother brand plainly said he
[6:49] didn't know all things he didn't have
[6:51] all the answers and anyone that said
[6:53] they had all the answers was wrong I
[6:55] don't know I I if I don't know I'm just
[6:58] going to tell you I don't know see I I
[7:01] don't I don't know all the answers folks
[7:03] I I don't know and if I don't know I'm
[7:05] going to tell you I don't know if I do
[7:07] know I won't tell you till I do know see
[7:09] but I I don't know when you hear a
[7:13] prophet Rising that's got all the
[7:15] answers to every gimmick that you can
[7:17] bring up remember he's not a
[7:20] prophet amen today they've got to know
[7:23] everything when you're going to have a
[7:24] tooth AE when you're going to have a
[7:25] tummy ache and everything else and tell
[7:27] you all about it that isn't the nature
[7:30] of our
[7:31] God watch the prophets watch Jesus
[7:35] question number three can someone who
[7:36] claims to be a prophet of God have
[7:38] prophecies and visions that have failed
[7:40] to come to pass the answer is no and
[7:43] brother random had no failed Visions or
[7:46] prophecies now friends I made a long
[7:48] video about the brown bear Vision how it
[7:50] was a conditional promise of God so I'm
[7:52] not going to repeat all those teachings
[7:54] I taught on that video so please go
[7:56] watch that video if you want to
[7:58] understand more about this some
[8:00] prophecies and Visions are conditional
[8:02] others are unconditional any Bible
[8:04] reader knows that on the video I show
[8:06] how God can interpret his word his
[8:08] Visions or his prophecies in any way he
[8:10] wants I show 10 Bible truths about
[8:13] visions and conditional promises again
[8:15] friends that's 10 Bible truths about
[8:18] visions and conditional Promises of God
[8:20] the accusers of brother brandham are not
[8:22] gifted with the Holy Ghost to interpret
[8:24] the word of God for us they teach many
[8:27] false doctrines and some of them that
[8:29] talk about brother brandham aren't even
[8:31] preachers so they don't have a gift to
[8:32] rightly divide the word of God so they
[8:34] shouldn't be trusted with their false
[8:36] teachings and their slander and then
[8:38] towards the end of that video the brown
[8:40] bear Vision Video I show brief responses
[8:42] to other accusations such as the India
[8:45] Africa vision of 300,000 it was most
[8:47] likely fulfilled in brother branham's
[8:50] 1954 Bombay India trip because the
[8:53] Bombay mayor estimated around half a
[8:55] million people so was probably an
[8:57] exaggeration so that's probably when the
[8:59] 300,000 were there in brother bram's
[9:02] meetings the tth vision was most likely
[9:04] fulfilled when brother brandham preached
[9:05] the Seven Seals in March of
[9:08] 1963 I gave seven important points about
[9:11] the seven major Visions brother brandham
[9:13] had in
[9:14] 1933 and then I spoke about the Ohio
[9:16] Municipal River Bridge prophecy brother
[9:19] Ram's accusers cannot prove beyond a
[9:21] shadow of a doubt that this did not
[9:23] happen because they were not there
[9:24] physically they cannot exalt government
[9:27] records as the absolute if you make
[9:29] government records the absolute then
[9:31] Moses was a fictional character Moses
[9:33] never performed the Exodus and brought
[9:35] Israel out of Egypt if you go by Egypt's
[9:37] government records and Fifth and finally
[9:40] the February 28th Arizona Cloud I made a
[9:42] video about this recently I made a video
[9:45] on July 11th 2023 about that the
[9:48] February 28th 1963 Arizona Cloud four
[9:51] reasons I believe it's a four reasons I
[9:54] believe it's of Supernatural origin
[9:55] video 161 I'll leave a link in the
[9:58] description by God's
[10:00] Grace all right question number four was
[10:02] can someone who claims to be a prophet
[10:04] of God teach that which directly oppose
[10:06] scripture and the answer is yes but of
[10:09] course it will be nothing major it won't
[10:12] be a major sin as the Bible
[10:14] differentiates major and minor sins I
[10:17] made a video about that recently so you
[10:18] can watch that video if you like as well
[10:21] I'll leave links in the descriptions I
[10:23] believe it was a two-part series if I'm
[10:24] not mistaken but the Bible example in
[10:27] Galatians Chapter 2 with St Peter
[10:29] Galatians 2:11 said Peter was to be
[10:32] blamed and Paul withstood him to the
[10:33] face because he withdrew himself from
[10:36] the Gentiles and he caused others to do
[10:39] it as well such as Barnabas and other
[10:41] Jews that's in Galatians
[10:45] 21-14 so yes and Peter was a prophet
[10:48] Peter foretold the day of the Lord in 2
[10:50] Peter chapter 3 burning with fervent
[10:52] heat Peter saw Visions read acts chap 10
[10:55] Peter was a genuine prophet of God and
[10:58] so on a minor subject yes a prophet
[11:00] could teach something that was directly
[11:02] opposed to scripture but of course the
[11:05] Holy Ghost would bring correction and
[11:06] that's what God did for brother brandham
[11:08] the Holy Ghost gave understanding to
[11:10] brother brandham as he approached the
[11:12] end of his ministry God finished the
[11:14] mysteries of God through brother
[11:15] brandham and all the major doctrines
[11:17] were taught scripturally by the grace of
[11:20] God number five can someone who claims
[11:22] to be a prophet of God lie in the name
[11:24] of the Lord the answer is no a genuine
[11:26] prophet of God cannot lie in the name of
[11:28] the Lord and brother brandham never lied
[11:30] in the name of the Lord I've been
[11:32] studying brother bram's Ministry since
[11:34] the end of 2001 I've been preaching
[11:36] brother bram's Ministry since the
[11:38] beginning of 2004 I've never seen
[11:40] brother Bram lie in the name of the Lord
[11:43] that's because brother Bram was a
[11:44] genuine prophet of God feel free to
[11:46] leave comments on this video if you have
[11:48] specific questions about statements I'll
[11:49] be happy to answer that as soon as I can
[11:51] get time for it by God's grace the only
[11:54] lying that's really going on is brother
[11:55] R's accusers lying about brother
[11:57] brandham slandering brother brandham
[12:00] jumping to false conclusions about
[12:01] brother brandham and they lie and
[12:03] slander and make presumptions all while
[12:06] harboring evil spirits because they've
[12:09] accepted false doctrines which are
[12:10] seducing spirits and I recently put out
[12:13] two videos about that the dangers of
[12:15] leaving the message from February 27th
[12:18] 2024 and March 2nd
[12:21] 2024 called the dangers of leaving the
[12:23] message of William brandham plus Jesus
[12:24] revealed the bible message to brother
[12:27] brandham and a great video to go along
[12:29] with this is the January 27th video 2024
[12:33] the bride has hundreds of differences
[12:34] from all other churches absolute Bible
[12:37] proof we are Jesus's
[12:39] bride so again the same people that are
[12:41] accusing brother brandom of lying
[12:43] they're the ones lying about brother
[12:45] brandham they say brother brandham had
[12:47] no prophecies that came to pass I have a
[12:49] video proving there's at least six
[12:51] there's another Pastor here in the US
[12:53] working on finding more individual
[12:55] prophecies that were spoken to sick
[12:56] people and they were healed by the grace
[12:58] of God he had is over 10 so I look
[13:00] forward to digging into that maybe later
[13:02] this summer if the Lord allows by God's
[13:04] grace and six and finally where
[13:06] scripturally is it that the New Covenant
[13:09] relationship with Jesus Christ requires
[13:11] a gentile
[13:12] Prophet there is no Bible verse that
[13:15] says a person is required to recognize a
[13:18] gentile Prophet to have a relationship
[13:20] with Jesus Christ it's sad you know some
[13:23] of these accusers of brother brandham
[13:25] they left churches that were really
[13:26] sinful message churches they should not
[13:28] be called message churches but they're
[13:30] sinful churches and some of these sinful
[13:33] churches have false doctrines like this
[13:35] where you have to know about brother
[13:37] brandom in order to be saved that's a
[13:38] lie you have to know about the Gospel of
[13:40] Jesus Christ in order to be saved and
[13:43] Jesus says there's wise and foolish
[13:44] virgins so wise virgin churches are born
[13:47] again with the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[13:49] in their soul and they know about the
[13:51] prophetic Ministry of William branam but
[13:53] foolish virgin churches can still be
[13:55] virgin to the word of God they can still
[13:57] be saved but they'll be unaware of God's
[14:00] prophetic Ministry in this hour in other
[14:02] words they're ignorant of the
[14:03] bible-based ministry that God gave to
[14:05] William Brenham but they can still be
[14:07] saved of course because Jesus says there
[14:09] are two kinds of Christians wise virgin
[14:11] and foolish virgin Matthew 25
[14:14] 1-13 now if brother bram's accusers
[14:16] really want the verses that tell about a
[14:18] gentile Prophet all have to do is read
[14:20] Revelation 10 verse 7 says the mystery
[14:23] of God is finished and then if you read
[14:24] verses 8- 11 this message has to be
[14:27] taken to all the Gentiles
[14:29] this clearly shows brother brandham was
[14:31] a gentile prophet and his message would
[14:33] go to the gentile people because Jesus
[14:35] said in Luke
[14:36] 21:24 that Jerusalem would be Trot in
[14:38] under until the times of the Gentiles be
[14:41] fulfilled then if you connect that with
[14:43] Romans 11:25 God will be with the
[14:45] Gentiles until the fullness of the
[14:47] Gentiles become in so Revelation 10:7
[14:50] has to be a gentile Prophet because his
[14:52] message goes to the Gentiles Revelation
[14:54] 11 shows how there's two Jewish prophets
[14:56] that only minister to Israel you can see
[14:59] that in Revelation 11 and also in
[15:01] Zechariah 4 more verses include Acts 3:
[15:06] 20 and 21 it speaks of the restitution
[15:08] of all things Jesus will remain in
[15:10] Heaven until everything is restored or
[15:12] the restitution of all things the temple
[15:15] Institute people there in Israel helping
[15:17] restore Israeli Believers back to the
[15:19] Mosaic law so the 144,000 Jews will
[15:22] already be restored back to the law
[15:24] they're going to need the two prophets
[15:25] to point them to Jesus Christ so this
[15:28] scripture speaking of the restitution of
[15:30] all things has to be to the Gentile
[15:32] Church ages because it's the church ages
[15:34] that need restored to the book of Acts
[15:36] truths the book of Acts Foundation same
[15:39] is mentioned in Matthew 1711 and 12
[15:41] Jesus said Elijah truly shall first come
[15:44] and restore all things this has to be a
[15:46] gentile Anointed with the spirit of
[15:47] Elijah because again the Elijah that
[15:49] comes with the spirit of Moses in
[15:51] Revelation 11 is only to Israel they're
[15:54] only dealing with Israel because God
[15:56] will only deal with Israel after the
[15:58] fullness of the Gentiles become in again
[16:00] according to Luke 21:24 and Romans
[16:03] 11:25 then of course Malachi 4:5 and6
[16:07] Malachi 4:6 says John the Baptist turned
[16:09] the heart of the fathers to the children
[16:10] that's found in Luke 1:17 and then the
[16:13] second part of verse 6 Malachi 4 says
[16:16] turning the heart of the children to
[16:17] their fathers John the Baptist turned
[16:19] the hearts of the Believers at the time
[16:22] of Jesus's first coming and so then God
[16:25] needed a gentile Prophet with the spirit
[16:26] of Elijah for the people at the end time
[16:28] time to turn their hearts back to the
[16:30] apostolic fathers and this is true
[16:32] because the Elijah in Revelation 11 will
[16:35] not turn the hearts of Israel back to
[16:38] their fathers he's going to turn them to
[16:39] Jesus Christ the Elijah in Revelation 11
[16:42] is not going to turn them back to Moses
[16:44] he's going to turn them back to Jesus
[16:46] Christ Luke 17:30 takes a little more
[16:49] understanding the son of man would be
[16:50] revealed in the last times when it was
[16:52] like the days of Noah and Sodom clearly
[16:54] we can see those conditions on the Earth
[16:56] today violence on the earth and sodomy
[16:58] taking over Jesus's son of man or
[17:01] prophetic Ministry already ministered to
[17:03] the Jews and Samaritans but it never
[17:05] ministered to the Gentiles so Jesus had
[17:08] to come in the form of a prophet a
[17:10] gentile Prophet to show the Gentiles the
[17:12] son of man prophetic ministry as well
[17:14] and of course God did that through
[17:16] brother bram's Ministry brother Bram was
[17:18] a man a sinner saved by grace but his
[17:20] prophetic discernment gift was a form of
[17:22] the son of man Jesus's prophetic
[17:24] Ministry to the Gentiles what about the
[17:28] people that believe in the Lord now and
[17:31] don't and not the way you preach they
[17:34] don't have to believe this they don't
[17:36] have to believe the way I preach it see
[17:38] don't have to believe that for the last
[17:41] day message will they be saved yes if
[17:45] they believe the Lord see and if they
[17:47] they disagree and say I don't believe
[17:49] he's the word I don't believe that this
[17:50] is right I don't believe in the baptism
[17:51] of the Holy Ghost that's shows where
[17:53] they're headed for the tribulation
[17:54] period but those who can accept the word
[17:57] in its fullness not me preaching
[17:58] preaching it because it's a Bible says
[18:01] so those who accept that is free because
[18:04] the word's already been
[18:06] judged in
[18:08] closing friends I hope this video was a
[18:10] help by God's grace I just thought I
[18:12] would make a brief response to these
[18:13] questions and if these questions are
[18:15] honest well then I appreciate that I
[18:17] appreciate all honest questions and
[18:19] these are honest answers by God's grace
[18:21] try to be as humble and as kind as
[18:23] possible what I've often found with
[18:25] these people that have left the message
[18:26] they left the message because they were
[18:28] a part of sinful message churches that's
[18:30] not brother brandom's fault that's not
[18:32] God's fault that's not Jesus's fault
[18:34] that's the fault of those sinful leaders
[18:37] in the sinful churches don't forget
[18:39] friends over 71 preachers left Jesus
[18:42] according to the Bible 70 left him and
[18:43] Judas es scarat left him we don't know
[18:45] all the evils that these 71 Preachers
[18:47] did but there was a lot of evil that
[18:49] came out of people that left Jesus
[18:51] Christ the same thing as repeated in
[18:53] this day Jesus Christ's Revelation was
[18:55] given to brother brandham brother brand
[18:57] was faithful to the re ation that Jesus
[18:59] gave him but many people around brother
[19:01] brandom turned out to be evil people and
[19:04] that's because Jesus said few there be
[19:05] that find the narrow road that leads to
[19:07] life and again 71 preachers left Jesus
[19:10] so we can expect many of the preachers
[19:12] that were around brother brandham would
[19:13] leave his message would leave the Bible
[19:15] Holiness standard would leave the word
[19:18] of God because that's what happened to
[19:19] Jesus but thank God there's a small
[19:21] Remnant that's faithful we believe we're
[19:23] a part of that by the grace of God I'm
[19:25] sure you do as well if you're a believer
[19:27] of this end time message Mage the
[19:29] viewers here and the main thing to do is
[19:31] stay in connection with Jesus Christ cuz
[19:33] he said the Holy Ghost will guide us
[19:35] into all truth as John 16:13 says if you
[19:39] have any questions concerns or
[19:40] testimonies about this video please
[19:42] contact me God bless you and may Jesus
[19:44] Christ be the desire of your heart
