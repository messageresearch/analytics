TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] you don't have to wonder will I make it oh no it isn't whether I'll make it it's already made for me Christ in me has made it himself and I just trust in his anchor alone what a [Music] wonderful I remember when I was first converted and I begin to see the working of the spirit and how that some could just impersonate the real genuine Holy Spirit into such a way that it would why it would just impossible to tell which was right and wrong Harley and I seen a man that I knew and I and by discernment I knew that man was living with another man wife and here he was standing there speaking with tongues and interpreting and everything and giving messages and it and I got the other fell to a place to where I could speak to him a few moments and a real genuine Christian and I thought how can that Spirit The Same Spirit work I that's when I first seen Pentecost and it was at Mishawaka Indiana and I tell you it's certainly I thought for the first few hours I was there I was among angels and the next few hours I thought I was among demons when I seen that seen these two men one give a message one interpret I never heard speaking in tongues and things like that before I watched those Spirits how they move I thought oh my while the great Millennium has begun and then when I got a chance on the outside to talk to one of them and could tell what he was made from there was one as evil as he could be and and that night I watched him again and I thought oh get me away from here I can't understand how this is and I seen those things were in the Bible but here was one doing it that didn't have the spirit of God and the other one doing it that did have the spirit of God then I was all confused and I just left the whole thing go and years later after the flood was over I was going walking up the road going to Greens Mill Mr ier the state senator comes here to church he met me on the road and he put his arms around me he said Billy what does Christ mean to you now my father was gone my brother was gone and my wife was gone my baby was gone and I I said what does he mean I said Mr ier he means more than life to me I said something has happened within me a few years ago cry came to my heart and I I it's just become more than I am myself it's just something that's happened it wasn't because I was religious it wasn't it's just something that God through the grace did for me and I said though he would slay me I trust him just the same and if I was in hell and there was such a thing his love in hell I'd still love him that's all it's something in here he's right I deserve every punishment that I ever got you do the same amen but if that anchor that something that anchor of love of God that holds in the human heart other things become secondarily sitting on a log up there I was praying about something else and my Bible come open and I was reading in over in the book of Hebrews the 6th chapter and I was reading there how that it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and made partakers of the Holy Spirit see as they fall away to renew themselves again unto repentance for the rain cometh off upon the Earth to water it to dress it or which is prepared but that which is nine to rejection thorns and thistles which is nine to rejection is to be burned and the Holy Spirit kept speaking to me about that what is is that I'd read it over again and then a vision comes and I saw the world standing before me turning it was all disc it up and like cloud and ready for to plant and there went a man by white sowing seeds and after he went around the curvature of the earth another man come and black sewing seeds behind him and when the seeds there were a good man sold come up was wheat and the bad black man solded the seeds come up and dressed in black it come up and it was Weeds and oh one was contrary to the other a great drought comes in the vision and the little wheat bowed its head it was just so thirsty for a drink and the the weed bowed its head it was thirsty for a drink then a great Cloud come over and the rains come down and the little wheat raised up and begin to scream praise the Lord praise the Lord he was so happy to get that water and the little weed raised up holler praise the Lord praise the Lord for the same water then I understood see there it is the holy spirit will fall but by their fruits they are known said the Lord Jesus see not by the reaction of the spirit whether they heal the sick or whether they speak with tongues or whether they sing in the spirit or whether they Rejoice this way or that they can do all that and still be lost it's your life with with then you a born again experience now Paul was trying to get this to those Corinthians I'm more over Brethren I would have wouldn't have you ignorant how that our fathers were all under the cloud and passed through the sea and were baptized unto Moses every one of them went into the Wilderness Jesus said not all that say Lord Lord will ler in but the one that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven it isn't what you say you could preach the gospel and still be lost certainly this is not just little kid stuff this is absolutely it's Dean and Christianity is not to be just a little like fabulous thing like well I'll go over to church and I know it's my duty to go that's not Christianity brother Christianity isn't is something that God has done God has chosen you in Christ and presented you as a love gift to Christ and it's God's calling election and if we have the opportunity to become that type of person and turn it down for little old things of the world now listen as we go on and all did eat that same spiritual Mana did you hear that the third verse and all did eat the same spiritual Mana what's he speaking of the rituals of the church people come to church and say they have repented and are baptized unto Christ taking on the name of the Lord Jesus and they did that in the wilderness also Paul said that's what the Cor have done they come in and was baptized unto Christ took on Christ outwardly professionally had taken him on intellectually had accepted him but brother it's a lot more than intellectuals it goes beyond that it goes to a a genuine birth not just the mental conception and emotional work but a birth an experience something that goes from down deep into the heart and change of the innermost being that makes you do things that you would not have done other words it makes you love those who are unlovable it makes you act different than you ever thought that you would act and when situations arise it's your anchor amen you don't have to wonder will I make it oh no it isn't whether I'll make it it's already made for me Christ in me has made it himself and I just trust in his anchor alone what a wonderful notice they all took [Music] communion that life that was in we know that it was a natural process because it was Frost like that rained from Heaven little Wafers with honey on them the wafer was just a little like a cracker a little cookie and had honey over the top of it and they all were partakers of that everyone passed through the Red Sea and was baptized through the cloud and through the sea un to Moses following his instructions as God's servant they were all baptized unto him they were all followers as we are today led by the Holy Spirit the great instructor of the Christian church we are LED through to water baptism and he said they all taken of the same [Music] Mana what did it do that Mana fell far Kora and for his group just as same as it did for Moses Caleb and Joshua they were all mixed together all partakers of baptism all partakers of membership all partakers of confession now all partakers of the communion you get it look at that solemn warning and Tabernacle folks get that way down deep amen remember it's yours Eternal destination hangs right there don't just pass it by like a little flutter or something this is something we must come respective to it's something that means whether we live Hereafter or not oh god look into our hearts examine Us by thy Holy Spirit and let us see this morning if there's any evil thing in us if there is take it away father we now lay it on the altar to walk away and leave it there if it's idleness if it's temper if it's indifference if it's neglecting if it's whatever it may be if it's hatred if it's malice if it's strive if it's whatever it may be oh God take it from from us today and at this coming revival may we be just so full of your charm Lord until many will come in and be saved the little Community here where we've tried so hard the first Revival now in 10 years out of H now I pray that you'll give us that real real spirit in our hearts and may it anchor there for eternity granted Lord
