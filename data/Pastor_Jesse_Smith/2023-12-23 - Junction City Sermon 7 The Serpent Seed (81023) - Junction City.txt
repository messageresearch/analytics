TRANSCRIPT
========================================
so last time we looked at anointed ones at the end times and hopefully that was a blessing brother irin said you heard a very similar sermon from Brother Kyle that's wonderful it's nice how the Holy Spirit gave a second witness to that I like that that wasn't planned except by God hallelujah I had no part in that but I'd like to uh look at the seed of the serpent of course this is the um brother brandham calls it this is the killer so this is the doctrine that will sometimes kill fellowship with other people will not want to fellowship with you anymore if you believe this I just heard him say it today it's from 1961 um and it's because people aren't very spiritual and they um they don't want to dig deep into the deeper truths of God and people will disfellowship with you you know if you believe uh certain things and this of course um this of course the truth of this upsets the LIE coming out of most churches most churches say Eve went over took a bite of Apple and then she covered herself you know well that's not in the Bible the Bible says that she partook of the fruit but we're not told what fruit it was the Bible didn't say it was an apple and then she gave whatever fruit she partook of she gave it to her husband and they covered their private parts right so whatever they partook of caused them to know they were naked and of course eating an apple doesn't cause anyone to realize the shame of their nakedness if it did let's pass out the apples let's go down to the beaches and passed out out the apples praise God like that's a joke brother Bradon made let's pass out the apples if it does that way these men and women can put some clothes on right because they walk around 3/4 or four fifths naked right uh it's a shame of course but uh we want to uh look at this here and um teach it I'll try to I I want to try to shorten it a little bit I got a uh got a of course a long drive home tonight but then I have a a wedding rehearsal tomorrow and a wedding to preach on Saturday so I got to preach twice on Sunday so I got a busy weekend coming up here uh but it's wonderful you know before I marry people we have to do uh six or seven counseling sessions I make sure I teach them as much as I can about marriage I will not marry a person unless they go to my church and they sit through me kind of lecturing them on six lessons if you want me to marry you you better be prepared to be married praise God because I'm not going to marry somebody unless they really know what it's all about by God's grace but this couple's a lovely couple you might remember Austin and Le I don't know if you remember them or not but um that's the brother who left the message for five years came back God delivered him from drug addiction alcohol addiction you name it addiction um and now he sings for Jesus and he's really a faithful servant there at the church uh he's a wonderful brother now this serpent seed also explains why sexual sin is so prevalent in it's always been not just today it's always always been that way right Jesus said as it was in the days of Sodom and lot so shall it be in the days of the son of man right so the same sins the days of Noah's uh and the days of Sodom with Abraham and lot the same sins are prevalent today it's because sexual sin was the first sin the actual physical sin committed in the Bible now if you want to get real deep the first spiritual sin was just disbelieving God's word it was Eve dis believing God's word that was the that was the first spiritual sin but then the first physical sin or the the fruit that was partaken of of course was adultery that was the first sin in the Bible now if you want to go even further than that the first sin ever was in heaven when Lucifer tried to exalt himself above God right and he deceived a third of the Angels the Bible said with his tail he drew a third of the angels to follow him talk about a church split uh the chch the first Church split was in heaven Satan of course split the church but uh we can see here uh the serpent seed we read our text um the Bible says that sin came into the world through lust okay so any of us would look at an apple and you know even if we're really hungry wouldn't we wouldn't lust after an apple right uh let's read that second Peter uh 1 verse4 2 Peter 1 verse4 a lot of people don't realize this it was a great uh Revelation to me it says whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust so corruption came into the world through lust that means the first sin that was committed came through lust right and lust is a forbidden craving okay so Eve had to had given into the first lust the first craving forbidden craving and of course it was adultery now I want you to also go let's go to uh 1 Timothy Chapter 2 since this thought just come to my mind here 1 Timothy 2 actually let's go to verse 12 1 Timothy 2:12 so Eve lusted after the fruit but we know it wasn't an apple because the Bible doesn't say an apple and an apple doesn't produce the same effects today 1 Timothy 2:12 but I suffer not a woman to teach nor a serp authority over the man but to be in silence that's why a woman will never come to the pulpit and preach to men right in a real Church why because of what Eve did verse 13 for Adam was formed or first formed then Eve and Adam was was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression so Eve was deceived into lusting after the forbidden fruit she was deceived into it but Adam wasn't when Adam partook of the fruit he knew exactly what he was doing okay U now verse 13 of course notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing if they continue in faith and charity and Holiness and sobriety now some people misunderstand that verse they think I'm only saved if I have children and that's a misunderstanding of the scripture okay but we know that uh her her salvation of course comes by grace through faith and then she must keep a Godly condition of a woman she must keep The Godly requirements of a woman in other words praise God doesn't mean a woman is saved by having children that that would be a false Doctrine because the Bible said we're saved by grace through faith not of our works but it's a gift of God hallelujah how many thankful for that gift today Hallelujah just God just gives the gift out if you want salvation he gives you the gift I receive it praise God hallelujah I didn't earn it I just received it praise God now we see now sin comes in the world through lust and Eve was deceived into partaking of this fruit this of course fruit was adultery okay now notice uh as if you would uh remember back in Genesis 3:15 this was God speaking God said I will put hatred or enmity between thee The Serpent and the woman and between thy seed the Serpent's Seed and her seed Eve seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel now the word seed means Offspring or descendants or children God said I'm going to put hatred between the Serpent's children and Eve's children children now how could somebody deny that praise God the serpent has children right Hallelujah and of course whose child was the serpent it was Cain Cain was the the son of The Serpent and Eve okay that's also uh plain in the scripture so let's read that since we got it let let's go to uh 1 John 4:12 I believe it is 1 John 4:12 no that's that's the wrong verse here give me a second is it 312 thank you okay Hallelujah 1 John 312 brother John you want to read that when you get it brother 1 John 312 King who was of that Wicked one and LW his brother and wherefore slew he him because his own Works were evil and his brother's righteous amen praise God so the Bible plainly says Cain is of the wicked one now none of us are going to call Adam Wicked are we no he's a he's a he he sined right but he was a Son of God the Bible calls Adam the Son of God hallelujah so none of us would call Adam Wicked in fact Jesus calls Satan the wicked one three times in the Book of Matthew 13 so here John by the Holy Spirit gets a revelation Cain was not of Adam Cain was of the wicked one Hallelujah all right so we've just laid a little bit of a groundwork there and notice God is the one who originates serpent seed you know some people are so surprised by that they they think where do you get serpent seed from um God how about God is that good enough for you God is the one who originated the serpent seed he said I'm going to put hatred between your seed Serpent and the woman's seed all right so it's God that originates this do this this teaching rather and uh let's now uh let's just go through these uh evidences in my book I wrote a book couple years ago I have a serpent seed section in there and there's nine evidences that this is a truth this is a true teaching and so hopefully tonight in the next uh 45 minutes or so you know by God Grace we can go through these uh these nine evidences okay and just so you know it is scientifically possible for a woman to conceive two twins by two different fathers okay it's called hetero super funication that's a big fancy word I can hardly say it sometimes hetero super funication and you can look it up it's in the journal forensic Sciences you can look it up in in any Journal um when a woman ovulates uh if she's with two men in a certain space of time she can get twins from two different men and there's many there's many many uh Val validated cases of that where the two children have two different DN right same mother different fathers that's exactly what Cain and Abel were uh same mother different fathers Cain's father was a serpent Abel's father was Adam all right that's true and uh before I forget if I don't get to it there's also articles that came out about 8 years ago in 2015 University of Georgia and other universities found that snakes have DNA that prove they once had arms and legs it's in their DNA and and these these these sinful scientists will say well see uh they evolved they used to have arms and legs and they evolved and now they don't need arms and legs but we know what it is they don't know what it is but we know what it is the serpent was an upright creature before that he got cursed and when God cursed him for what he did to Eve God took away his arms and legs and he said on your belly you'll go the rest of these days hallelujah God is true God's word is Right Hallelujah as time goes on God's word becomes more true in other words it's validated more and more praise God it's always true but it we get more proof and evidence that it is true praise God Amen hallelujah thank God I found that you know my children a few years ago we got National Geographic magazine and it opened it up and they said Daddy my son comes R me dad look it says snakes had legs and it has a picture of this cartoon snake and he's got you know his tongue sticking out and I'm like wow the National Geographic is preaching the message Hallelujah now they weren't really doing that but they got a revelation through science God left that evidence in the snake's DNA that's exactly right now the first evidence is the Bible supports the serpent seed teaching from Genesis to Revelation okay I just showed you Genesis where we learn of the serpent seed Jesus wrote about the serpent seed I'm sorry Jesus spoke of the serpent seed and it was recorded in Matthew Chapter 13 it's the parable of the four kinds of grounds right I'm sorry it's a parable of the wheat and the tears I'm sorry the parable of the wheat and the tears now I don't have time to read it so I'm just going to read what I wrote about it here Jesus describes the children of God as wheat seeds they're called Good Seed all right while the tears are called Children of the wicked one okay Jesus planted The Good Seed Satan planted The Bad Seed okay in the parable but notice it's one field with two Planters can everybody see that one field gets wheat one field gets tears our Farmers ought to be able to say Amen to that right and that's how it was in in the Garden of Eden Eve was the one field and the two sers the two seeds came from The Serpent and Adam one field two sers okay hope that's plain hopefully everybody can see that by God's grace and notice you have children of God but you have children of the devil as well so Jesus preached the serpent seed Hallelujah because Jesus was God's Spar Hallelujah I was going to preach on the godhead tonight too but I thought well I think I'll do serpent seed this be the last time I'm with you for this summer summer's coming to an end and I'm starting work in a couple weeks here um I thought I thought this would be important one to teach here now I do want everybody to read 2 Corinthians 11 let's go to 2 Corinthians 11:2 you know when I first heard this church this blew me this blew my mind away I'd say it blew me out of the water you know you know I just I could not believe you know I I was raised in church for 19 years and then I I then I got saved and I was serving God for two years and I never saw a serpent seed until my brother showed it to me and of course he heard it from brother Brandon and if it just just just him pointing out these verses it felt like scales fell off my eyes like St Paul like how could I have not seen this before was I blind what was wrong with me well what was wrong with me I wasn't saved praise God hallelujah I was in one way I was blinded by the God of this evil world the Bible says Satan right once I became saved once I started trust in God and believing in God then God could reveal more and more to me he could and that's what he's doing with you you as well he's revealing more and more to you and I want God to re reveal more and more to me as I go on praise God I don't want it to stop praise God I want to keep going Hallelujah don't stop Jesus Keep revealing yourself to me praise God Amen Hallelujah Second Corinthians uh 11 2 and three now Paul is comparing the church to Eve this church in Corinth and you know if you read your Bible they were not a perfect Church they had a lot of problems they were taking each other they were suing each other going to the judges the one man was sleeping with his stepmother it was just awful uh some people were trying to speak in tongues uh without any interpreters in the church and Paul's like got to stop that if you don't have an interpreter keep silent because it's just it's confusion right now he says for I am jealous over you with Godly jealousy for I have espoused you to one husband that I may present you as a Chase virgin to Christ so Paul says I'm jealous that you're turning away from the faith I'm jealous of you because I'm the one that preached and you got saved I was the one that preached the gospel and now you're turning away from my teaching he said but when when you got saved you were like a virgin to Christ I engag you to Jesus and he's like what happened well he tells us in the next verse but I fear lest by any means as the serpent begal Eve through his subtility so your mind should be corrupted from the Simplicity that is in Christ isn't that something Paul compares the Corinthians were virgins until Satan started working on their minds and he's saying they lost their virginity right just like who Eve he said it right there just like Eve in other words Satan did this same thing to the Corinthian Church that Satan did to Eve she was virgin but then he deceived her and what happened she lost her virginity now so I know some the these things are plain but it's the truth anyhow sometimes I got to be plain like this but it's still holy because these are Bible words I'm just pre I'm just saying what the Bible says praise God all right so Moses preached serpent seed or wrote about serpent seed God God did in Genesis Jesus did in Matthew Paul Paul mentioned serpent seed in 2 Corinthians Peter oh yeah we already read second Peter chapter 1 Peter says sin came in the world through lust so Peter preaches serpent seed and then we already read uh 1 John 3:12 how Cain was of that Wicked one so John so look at this I got five preachers all preaching serpent seed do you think it sounds does it seem like it's pretty biblically accurate Saints of course everybody's writing about it the Bible never look up the word Apple in your concordance the Bible never says that they ate an apple right it never says that so we can't say what the Bible says we've got to say what the Bible says hallelujah we can we should only say what the Bible says praise God Amen now Cain was of that Wicked one Adam was not Wicked he was a Son of God Jesus calls Satan the wicked one in Matthew 13:19 and Matthew 13:38 and even John called Satan the wicked one three times in 1 John 2 13- 14 and 1 John 5:8 we're not we don't have time to read all these and church I'm not going to read this but Cain has a separate lineage from Abel how many know that God God has them record totally different lineages they're not even in the same lineage but they're Brothers why AR they're in the same lineage because they got different fathers right they have different fathers so uh we're not going to read it but Cain's genealogy is in Genesis 4 it's not the same as Abel's right and Abel of course he died but Seth took his place Seth's genealogy or Adam's genealogy is in Genesis 5 Hallelujah so they have different genealogies God separates the children of the devil here and the children of God amen amen how many know the Bible calls Eve the mother of all living how many know that it's Genesis 3:20 does the bible ever call Adam the father of all living no brother brand brought that out no Adam is never called the father of all living cuz he's not he wasn't the father of Cain but Eve was the mother of all living Hallelujah these are all important uh Bible truths oh yeah and brother Iran I have three videos on this topic plus I wrote about in the book so if you want more on it there's there's there's a lot of on it by God's grace there's whole lot on it and brother Simon does a good job he can teach even deeper than I can on this topic he'll just bring out more and more scriptures Hallelujah and then remember in Revelation 12:9 let's read that Revelation 12:9 what nickname is Satan given anyone remember before you read it you can Shout It Out anyone you remember what's what what nickname is Satan given you remember it Sister Sarah Dragon yeah that old serpent that old Dragon yeah the old serpent yep dragon's right too good one he actually has four titles he has four nicknames in that scripture Genesis 129 very good sister and the Great Dragon that's right good sister Sarah yes the Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceiveth the whole world so see he's called that old serpent because you know what happened Satan got in the serpent in the Garden of Eden he possessed that animal just like when those demons went into the swine in the days of Jesus right and ran them off the cliff remember that Satan can possess any living thing right and his demons can possess any living thing so Satan the Bible said he was in the garden of God the Bible says that plainly in uh ex Ezekiel 28 he was in the garden of God and then he possessed The Serpent and he he spoke through the serpent he deceived Eve through the serpent seduced her uh and then uh part they partook of the fruit of adultery and then he had a son the serpent had a son now it wasn't now let me get this clear too it wasn't Satan's son because Satan's not a man just be clear on that Satan's a spirit and Spirits don't have children and the church said so Cain wasn't Satan's son although Satan possessed the serpent to have him Cain was the Serpent's son all right is that is that is that clear Satan himself is a spirit he can't procreate with a woman because he's a spirit he can possess their bodies but he can't he can't uh he can't reproduce is the word I'm looking for is that clear all right so there there's there's a lot of Truth in here this is digging deep down the word of God this is not skin milk this is uh this is uh chewy meat this is real good organic meat right here by God's grace see it's organic there's nothing injected in here brother Howard so in other words same as God was manifested In the Flesh in Jesus Satan was manifested in the serpent beautiful beautiful he's got it yep good Revelation everybody yep both seeds that God talked about came apart from male instrumentality in other words uh uh from physical intercourse uh between a man right because it was serpent the serpent was not a man and the serpent uh he wasn't a he wasn't fully man the serpent laid with Eve and had Cain and the woman's seed who is the woman seed Christ and the Christ was conceived in Mary of the Holy Ghost right so Cain and Christ both did not have a Earthly human father right because the serpent was not fully human he was partially but not not fully okay that's very good brother very good good good thought it's good understanding that you got there now remember the Bible say Satan is the father of lies and he's a murderer from the beginning as John 8:44 says okay so there's your first evidence the first evidence again is the serpent seed is taught Through the Bible from Genesis to Revelation Amen in Genesis it's Satan in the serpent in Revelation uh Satan is called that old serpent because he possessed that serpent from the beginning all right now the second proof is the two trees in the midst of the garden were not literal trees okay now there was a garden with natural trees like apple trees lemon trees you name all the good trees citrus trees but the Bible said there was two trees in the midst of the garden but they were not literal trees that those two trees were symbolic of the Holy Spirit or Jesus Spirit God's spirit and Satan's Spirit that's what those two trees represent and the proof of that is in Genesis 2:9 let's read Genesis 2:9 so the Bible is speaking here in Parables which Jesus said that's Jesus did that a lot of his teaching was through Parable I'm going to prove it to you at the end here I'll show I'll show it to you now look at verse n and out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is Pleasant to the sight and good for food look there's a semic in there the tree of life also in the midst of garden and the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil now notice they said the trees were good for food how many how how many recognize that every tree God planted was good for food but if e partook of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil was it good for food if she died no any tree that will kill you is not good for food is that right e partook of the tree of knowledge good and evil and it killed her so it wasn't good for food so that means that tree was not a literal tree it was a spirit right amen isn't Jesus don't we know Jesus is the Tree of Life didn't he say I am the way the truth and the life the Bible even calls him the branch of David hallelujah hallelujah there's many symbols of Jesus he's the rock he's the water he's the tree he's the branch I mean whatever whatever symbol he represents himself he said I'm the Mana praise God I'm the bread amen he he he said I'm the wheat seed whatever you have need of whatever we need that's what he is praise God and church yeah I'll get to this in a little bit yeah I'll just say it right now um the third evidence that's the second evidence any tree that will kill you is not good for food so the tree of knowledge of good evil was not like all the other trees in the garden it was not good for food that means it wasn't a a natural tree it was a symbolic tree it was the spirit of Satan now the third proof is that the third proof of the serpent seed the tree of life was Jesus's spirit because there's only one way to eternal life there's only one way to eternal life so now denominational people they think there's a tree of life and tree of knowledge good and evil and Adam and Eve will go up to the tree of life and just eat like an apple for for eternal life that's impossible God never gave anybody eternal life by eating food right if if the tree of life was like a orange tree let's say that means there's two ways to eternal life there's eternal life through S salvation through the blood sacrifice like Jesus and there's eternal life through eating eating of fruit but that's wrong there's not two ways to eternal life there's only one way to eternal life praise God there's always only been one way eternal life that's by grace through faith it's a sacrifice right God gives us a sacrifice he forgives our sins so that's another proof the Tree of Life had to be the spirit of God because there's not two ways to eternal life there's only one way hallelujah amen hallelujah oh my thank you Jesus so if the tree of life was like a pear tree that would mean there's a second works-based way to in to inherit eternal life there's not there's not a we can't earn salvation it's a gift praise God eternal life has always been a gift it always will be a gift praise God hallelujah now the fourth evidence this is to me this is the most powerful one of course you know you can have your own opinion that's fine the serpent seed explains the purpose of the Virgin birth of Jesus Christ did you ever wonder growing up why did Jesus have to be born virgin birth why why what's so what was so different about that I never even thought about it right I mean I never even wondered why until I came to this message the revelation of the Bible and now I know why Jesus had to be born virgin birth since Mankind's fall into sin came by Sex God had to redeem Man Without a sex act and give them divine power over the sin nature praise God sin came in the world through a sex act so righteousness had to come in the world without that act amen hallelujah praise God and you know the Bible says in the Book of Job uh that every man man born of a woman is a a few days in full of trouble in other words and and even David said David said in sin my mother conceived me well you know the history David wasn't a bastard child David's uh father Jesse is a good man Jesse was a good man praise God Jesse and his wife uh they were married there was nothing sinful in their marriage so what was David saying David was saying through the sex act the sin nature passed into me through my mother my mother and father right I mean as much as I wish Sister Sarah my children were were perfect they're not my son's now 16 brother uh irin probably know and I see him battling the same things I did when I was 16 I'm like oh my goodness this I'm like seeing this is like deja vu or something like that he he's acting the same way I did battling the same things and I'm like oh this is this is strange it's strange to see it you know my in other words the sin nature that was in me as much as I love God I still got a sin nature I got to battle every day this Rascal I got to fight off every day it it came through my wife into him and now he's got that same nature ah but there's a greater nature from a greater father than me I'm nothing I'm a nobody I'm just a human father but our heavenly father gives us power over the sin nature amen amen and that's where my son can get victory over the sin nature he can get it from his Heavenly Father hallelujah amen hallelujah that if you want to write it down it Psalms 51:5 David said behold I'm shapen in iniquity and Inc did my mother conceived me but his parents were married it wasn't a sin he means the sin act or I'm sorry the sin nature passed through into him through his parents' Union their physical Union so God's lamb Jesus Christ had to come to Earth through the Virgin birth to B to bypass the way s sin came into the world see the sin nature wasn't passed down to Jesus because he wasn't conceived of man he was conceived to the Holy Spirit praise God Amen and because of that sin could not have dominion over him praise God hallelujah because he didn't have a natural father who struggle with sin he God had to bypass the seual act and God had to conceive Jesus of the Holy Spirit and that's why Jesus was holy praise God Amen that's why he was a spotless lamb without blemish Hallelujah without spot without blemish because he wasn't conceived the same way we we were in iniquity the sin passing the sin of iniquity the sin nature passing through our parents into us hallelujah because Jesus didn't have a sin nature he could live a sinless life Jesus did not have a sin nature we know he had a word nature because the Bible said the word became flesh and dwelt Among Us how many know that John 1 verse4 right the word became flesh the Holy Spirit created a flesh body and dwelt Among Us with no sin on the inside yes it could die yes it could uh feel pain and yes he could be tempted but he wasn't a he did not have a sin nature he had the word nature in other words let me explain like this Brothers uh when we're tempted what do we often do we often give into that you know the first thing we do is we give into that that temptation but Jesus when he was tempted the first thing he would do is go to the word amen right we we we we uh as men women we give into our flesh right we just easily give into that we just turn to our flesh but Jesus was not that way Jesus turned to the word he turned to prayer amen he turned to the father Hallelujah because he had a different nature natur he didn't have a sin nature he had a word nature Glory so the purpose of the Virgin birth had two purposes it prepared a sinless lamb sacrifice to pay for all our sins and begin a new human race hallelujah amen that's right now let me see the second one yeah yeah sinless sacrifice and then a a a new human race now we're not going to read it but in Revelation 5 how many you familiar with Revelation 5 John's weeping because there's a book in heaven and no man's worthy to take the book The Bible said no man in heaven so that would include Moses Enoch Elijah this is some pretty good names right there right no man on Earth no man under the Earth so in the heart of the earth no man was worthy to take the book why because all those men were born of a sex act Hallelujah you see that every man was born of of a sex act so the sin nature passed into him and John was crying he was weeping no man's worthy to take that book and loose the Seven Seals we preached on praise God but who prevailed the Bible the the Elder said weep not the Lamb of God has prevailed Hallelujah the Lamb of God Jesus Christ and he come forth and he looked like a lamb that had been slain and the Bible said Thou Art Worthy to take the book and loose the Seven Seals thereof oh my Hallelujah that's so beautiful other words the only person who could open the book and reveal God's Mysteries was the one who was born with a virgin birth hallelujah oh my that's beautiful praise God that's why the serpent Seed doctrine is so important God had to bypass a sex act or we call intercourse or reproductive act God had to bypass that in order to create a new human race Glory praise God and then Jesus was worthy than to take the book loose the Mysteries and send them down to earth praise God as you heard last week with Revelation 10 right in the cloud amen all right now I want to read these these ones um go to Revelation 3:14 let's read Revelation 3:14 [Music] [Music] brother uran you want to read that brother Revelation 3:14 chur begin amen wonderful so Jesus Christ was the beginning of the creation of God why because he wasn't born by a sexual act of man and woman he was born conceived of the Holy Ghost he was a new creation amen praise God and what did he have he had a sinless body with no sin nature and then what happened he died he rose and then he got a resurrected the Bible called it a glorified body notice he's the beginning guess what you're the ending amen Jesus was the beginning and you and I all the Believers are the ending of the creation of God in other words the last creation he's going to create is Believers he's going to restore our bodies and make us give us new bodies glorified bodies bodies that can never die bodies that can never sin Jesus was the first one without sin and we will be the last ones without sin praise God hallelujah oh my thank you Jesus it's beautiful now uh the fifth evidence is Adam and Eve covered their loins after eating the forbidden fruit let's read that Genesis 36 and 7 all right verse six and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food now that's spiritual food that's not physical food food right cuz this is symbolism right here CU remember that tree was not good for literal food because if she ate it she died so it wasn't literal F fruit it was spiritual fruit and that it was pleasant to the eye so see he was an attractive Serpent and a tree to be desired to make one wise Satan had deceptive false reasoning she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also unto her husband with her and he did eat and the eyes of them both were open and they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons now the word apron means a loin covering and loin is the reproductive areas in the middle of your body okay so as soon as now this is it's just ridiculous churches think they eat an apple and they cover their private parts that doesn't make any sense why would you do that when I eat an apple I got to wipe my mouth right because all the juices and that's what you do but they eat they whatever fruit they partake of it makes them cover their their their loins they sew together leaves and make like little shorts or whatever skirts or whatever and they know they're naked in other words the shame of their act that that that shame Came Upon them this was not a apple tree friends right right this was a Act of adultery now what's interesting I'll just lay this in I don't know where Adam was some people think Adam might have been taking a nap while Eve came over there and then after Adam woke up he came to find her and she'd already partaken so he's like well I I've got to partake of this and and brother does say that brother does say that Adam knew what he was doing he chose to die because Eve was a part of him right and that and that fits the type of Christ right we are Christ's bride we're sinful yet Jesus chose to take our sin upon him praise God Amen and die for our sins Amen brother said Adam loved her so much he just couldn't live without her which makes sense she was a part of him right they were one am when God first made them I'll just go like this they were one Spirit they were one Soul just hovering over like brother like the Holy Spirit they but then God put flesh on Adam but Eve was still on the inside of him and then God had to put him to sleep right take out a rib and then pulled out Eve Spirit pulled out Eve Spirit form Eve and now these two right I'm sorry now this one was was two now right but they were one Soul or one spirit in the beginning all [Music] right now if you know the Bible the Bible says uh the Bible says God does eye for eye tooth for tooth right so in other words the punishment always fits the crime so if Adam and Eve sins sin with their mouth by eating an apple why didn't God make them hoods to cover their mouth right why didn't God do that because whatever the sin is the punishment has to meet the crime if you poke somebody's eye out you lose your eyes if you sin with your mouth your mouth gets smacked right or whatever but God didn't do that the punishment uh the punish yeah the punishment and shame yeah we'll get to the punishment later the shame came in the the loins or the reproductive parts because that's what they use when they sinned because God has the law eye for an eye tooth for a tooth punishment always fits the crime right we saw that with David David laid with basba in private right so what' God say God said then son's going to lay with all your wives in public the punishment fit the crime right Moses remember last time Moses magnified himself and he smoked that rock God said because you did that you're not going in the promised land right you magnified yourself so you're not enjoying the glory of going into the promised land the punishment always has to fit the crime all right oh yes let's read this this is a good one Ezekiel 16:35 and 36 Ezekiel 16:35 and 36 Ezekiel 16:35 now look at this language here look at the language Ezekiel uses in this script in these scriptures sexual sin always produces shame when it's outside of the marriage covenant right always right because God's punishments have to fit the crimes look at verse 35 wherefore oh Harlot hear the word of the Lord thus sayith the Lord God because thy filthiness was poured out and thy nakedness discovered through thy whoredoms with thy lovers and with all thy the idols of thy Abominations and by the blood of thy children which thou did give unto them therefore will I gather thy lovers and God's going to uh destroy that but notice notice those words there thy nakedness was discovered through what whoredoms now look at that that's that's the Bible interpreting itself praise God Amen God said you discovered your nakedness you felt the shame of nakedness because of your sexual sin Glory that's that's the Bible trueu praise God now who's going to argue with that praise God and actually have a good argument you can't you can't argue with that it's plain Bible truth and brother Ram he preached it the Holy Spirit showed it to him he preached it and then a lot of people left him because they can't accept truth now I'm going to read you a quote here brother Ram said you don't have to you you don't have to believe this to be saved so I don't know how many knew that by God's grace but you don't have to believe serpent seed uh to be saved this is the same quote where he says the serpent seed is the killer he said yeah the seed of the serpent that's the killer many people don't believe that he said but if you'll just read Genesis the Bible said the serpent had a seed and then he said what Howard said he actually almost said exactly what you said he said and if the serpent seed was spiritual then Jesus was not a man so the woman's seed was spiritual they both had seeds and the emnity is still there the serpent had a seed and I love I love what brother random says he says and if you'll just take your Bible and get down and be real reverent before God I believe God will reveal it to you see that's the thing people aren't reverent with their Bibles they're not reverent before God so they'll never see it they'll just say oh John's crazy or irin's crazy or Howard and Daniel Jesse they're just crazy people they won't be reverent and really get down and read the Bible and seek God praise God they' rather go to the football game tonight or the I saw him playing the baseball game down there that's fine if you just do it once a week or something like that but I'm saying don't skip church don't skip prayer meeting amen seek God read your Bible pray be devoted unto God seek God and the Bible says if you seek him with all your heart you'll find him praise God Amen now here's what brother Ram says I love this I love brother Ram says and if you do not understand that he said I'm available any time to do my very best to help you [Music] don't you love that brother R is never like well I don't have time for you I don't have time for your questions look how humble he's like if I can help you in any way just let me know I'll help you today would be text me anytime shoot me an email anytime I'll try to help you right how many emails would brother be getting today if he was on Earth he'd get a lot for me brother John I'd be filling up his inbox now look now look look what brother R says next course we realize that doesn't save a man serpent seed has nothing to do with salvation like if if someone says I don't believe in serpent seed they can still be saved because salvation is through what the blood of Jesus Christ right brother said we realize that doesn't save a man neither does it condemn a man so if somebody doesn't believe it they're not going to get judged has nothing to do with salvation but I love this but it only brings light upon the subject that we're all trying so hard to get to the people to see see it only brings light hallelujah amen I love that what are we trying to see we're trying to see Jesus Christ today praise God Amen right we know about Jesus in the past with the anabaptist we know what Jesus in the past on the day of Pentecost but we need to know Jesus today praise God that's the day we're living in and when you see serpent seed now it helps us it shines light on what we're all trying to see we're trying to see Jesus Christ today isn't that beautiful hallelujah amen I mean there's another one Jeremiah 1326 says therefore will I discover thy skirts upon thy face that thy shame may appear so God says basically I'm going to show your shame I'm going to show that you're an adulterer uh you've you've removed your skirts for some men and I'm going to show your shame that's Jeremiah 13:26 in other words you're going to feel shame because of your sexual sin and that's what Adam and Eve did they felt shamed they knew they were naked so they cover their nakedness we're getting close to the end here now well kind of close evidence number six is God's punishments for Eve sins centered on her reproduction and her longing for Adam did you catch that when you read the Bible go to Genesis 3:16 Genesis 3:16 remember the punishments must always fit the crimes so if Eve sinned in a sexual way then God would have punished her in her sexual reproduction well that's exactly what he did praise God Amen Hallelujah it's exactly what he did is it is it amazing yeah wow exactly same thing I say unbelievable God's punishments always fit the crimes oh it's beautiful the revelation of God's word is beautiful Genesis 3:16 what does God tell the woman and unto the woman he said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception we just had a sister give birth last Sunday she only had a 5-h hour labor that was pretty good she that's not too bad right that's not too bad she had a 24-hour one one time I thought God bless that woman God bless that woman but where does God punish her in her pain in her conception of what conception of what seed why because she received the wrong seed in the beginning amen because she took the seed of the serpent God said I'm going to bring pain in every one of your daughters who bring who gets any seed they're going to have pain in conceiving and bringing forth the child and the church said every daughter of Eve now every daughter of Eve has pain in the bringing forth of seed because of what Eve did in the beginning that's thus saith God right why because of she received the wrong wrong seed that was verse 16 oh yes and in sorrow Thou shalt bring forth children you're going to have pain when you bring forth seed because you received the wrong seed in the beginning you took the serpent seed first instead of Adam that's right and now and then notice this God has to adjust her her her uh her desire why would God have to adjust her desire didn't she already desire Adam no this shows she desired the serpent because God has to make her desire her husband now oh look at verse 16 and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee right all these are consequences you got pain in conceiving seed because you receiv received the wrong seed now you're going to desire Adam because you didn't desire him at first you desired remember the Bible said she looked at the tree it was beautiful to look on and she desired well R said the servant was a handsome fell so way handsomer than all of us in here look at that God has to say now you got to desire Adam because you didn't desire Adam at first does everybody understand tonight you got paying bringing forth seed because you received the wrong seed and now you must desire your husband because you didn't desire him at the beginning you desired the serpent all [Music] right and again if Eve ate an apple why didn't God punish her mouth and all the apple trees God's punishments focus on her human reproduction her reproduction of seed and the body parts of the loins used for that process my goodness you know I've heard preachers you know I heard a preacher say it on his podcast he's in the message he's like I I don't know how ever I ever missed this for all these years how did I not see that when I was growing up how do we not see it well there's a time and season for all things praise God but in other words once you see it you can't unsee it they say you can't not see what happened there because God puts hatred between the seed lines and then God says the serpent has children he has Offspring well how do you get Offspring by eating an apple how did that happen how did that happen do you have people have children by eating apples no they don't see so it just shows most most churches don't want the truth they're not hungering and thirsting for truth amen they don't want the truth now that word desire means longing or craving there it is so God said your longing Eve is now going to be to Adam you're going to Crave Adam now because what' she do she craved the serpent earlier okay that's what the word means look it up in the Hebrew you can look it up she craved she had a forbidden there's there the corruption came in the world through lust there it is right there just like Peter said now how many would raise your hand and say it's starting to become more clear is any would anybody say that okay a couple more some of those children raise their hands hopefully not hopefully not yet even even in my church you I have the little ones in there I usually don't preach this very very clearly until they get to a certain age you know so um and of course we never really explain it fully until they get to a certain age also note let's read Genesis 3:20 oh yeah we read this before right and Adam called his wife's name Eve because she was the mother of all living now just stop for a moment in Genesis 3 the denominations don't even think anything sexuals happened they just think they ate an apple how can she be a mother already if she only ate an apple the denominations don't recognize Eve having relations until chapter 4 when it says Adam knew Eve his wife but Adam already calls her a mother in chapter three praise God she's already a mother why because God said she's got seed right the Serpent's God's seed she's God's seed Adam already calls her a mother not by eating an apple but by receiving the Serpent's Seed that's a blessing again all this is in my book if you want it's also in the church age book right brother R uran have you read the whole church age book or most of it or some of it okay so it's in uh it's in the chapter about the tree of life so I think it's the seventh or eighth or ninth chapter I think the sard sardian church age brother Braham goes through when when it says I'll give you the Tree of Life brother Braham says okay now let me show you the tree of life and let me show you the tree of knowledge good and evil and lays out the serpent seed in that book it's a phenomenal book all right the seventh evidence we're almost at number nine see we're getting close now we're only two away now evidence number seven is the serpent was humanlike before the fall so before God cursed the serpent he was very similar to a human the proof of that is in Genesis 3 he has three humanlike attributes the Bible said he was more subtle that means shrewd Sly or crafty he was the sest of all the animals the serpent was okay um second he was the only Beast that could talk in the garden think of that Adam could talk with the serpent he could have we don't know if he did but he could have because the serpent had the ability to talk when Eve is talking to the serpent Eve's not like oh a snake's talking to me ah what where's Adam where's Adam so see she had to been aware that the serpent could talk or else like me I would have screamed like what I'm I'm out here too I'm not talking to any talking snake I rebuke that snake in Jesus name but it just shows they were used to talk they were just having a conversation it was everything was normal there's no sin yet so the serpent was slier more Sly than slyer is not a word I'm making up words here the serpent was more Sly I'm a school teacher too what a shame I better get straightened out cuz school starts in a week and a half have here he was more Sly than any other animal and he could talk and he could reason he could say oh no you surely won't die he had the ability to reason and give reasons why he was right not just like a par a par can say hello Don hello Donnie hello Jesse hello hello John a parot can just mimic but a serpent gave you reasons why right so the serpent was so close to being human but what wasn't fully human and third uh the Bible says the serpent was an upright creature because in verse 14 God cursed him and said you'll go on your belly the rest of your days how many know that right okay so the curse put him on his belly that means before he wasn't on the ground he was an upright creature and science said he had DNA for arms and legs now who goodness gracious who couldn't see this praise God we should put this all over the Internet and guess who's going to watch five people cuz nobody cares they want to hear about the football game the baseball game with a way to make a million dollars on your phone which never works they don't people don't want it but God's people want the truth amen hallelujah the Bible said God said my word will not return void wherever I send it it will accomplish that what it's purpose to accomplish Hallelujah in other words God knew you'd want the word so somehow he made a way you could hear serpent seed the godhead the Seven Seals the water baptism in the name of Jesus Christ God had a way to get his word to you you ought to be happy about that praise God I'm happy about that amen amen think about that all the all those years for 21 years brother Howard I didn't even know about the serpent SC but God knew I'd believe it when I was exposed to it so God made a way I could hear it in fact this is the first sermon ever heard from the message was the serpent seed W Hallelujah I tell you I had a hard time going to sleep that night CU I was like wow what else is in the Bible I've never heard a man preach like that I think we stayed up till like 1 or 2: a.m. listen to those sermons that's that was some fresh Revelation right there by God's grace Hallelujah yes it was the University of Georgia in two in October 2015 I got the article if you want it discovered snakes once had legs they have DNA that controls the development and growth of Limbs it's already in every snake let's go find a snake after service brother if we if we had a mic if we had a microscope we could look under there there'd be DNA if we had a real good microscope there' be DNA it says has the ability to create limbs why because at one point the snakes were the serpent was upright and he looked a lot like a man and he had seed that could reproduce with human with a human now there's no animal like that brother says science is always looking for that missing link right that's what brother says where's the missing link between animal and man it was the serpent but God cut off that Missing Link and now they they'll never find it they never find it okay evidence number eight Cain was the Serpent's son and not Adams we've already covered this um so we aware this one not as Cain who is of that Wicked one who and slew his brother and wherefore slew him because his own Works were evil and his brothers were righteous so E's womb had two separate seeds from two separate impregnations and they were twins Cain's conception was some time before Ables and I have an article from July 1994 I was 14 years old when they wrote the article uh and it talks about uh heteros super funication it's it's proved by science this happens all the time with s when with sinful men and women right two seeds one woman twins all right um now I want to lay this in here brother R told us in the day days of Noah brother Bram said either Noah's wife was of the seed line of the serpent or Noah's sons married women who were of the sea line of the serpent so brother R said all of us are now intermixed with that with like a sinful nature okay which that's that's good news that's good news now why is it good news because it means you're not your salvation isn't dependent on who your mom and dad was Glory amen your salvation is depend on that God is your heavenly father praise God Amen Hallelujah your natural seed life doesn't determine if you're going to be saved or not anymore it used to it doesn't anymore that's why God had to send the seed of God which is the Holy Ghost praise God Amen let's go there first Peter 1:23 and brother how why don't you read that for us when you get there 1 Peter 1:23 now I have preached on the baptism of the Holy Ghost here right I talk about the filling of the Holy Ghost another way to say that is to receive God's seed the Holy Ghost is also called a seed it's called water fire it's called it's called n a dove it's called many oil it's called many things but it's also called a seed and so now God says I love it God says it doesn't matter who your parents were doesn't matter what seed line you're of now what matters is that you receive my seed amen and the Bible said whosoever will let him come and drink of the Waters of Life freely amen amen so everybody has a chance to be saved now we know very few will Jesus said few there be that find the narrow road that leads to life but all those who desire salvation can be saved and they can be filled with the Holy Ghost amen glory all right brother Howard can you read that um what did I say yeah 1 Peter 1:2 there you go sorry I forgot I got so many thoughts going through my mind go ahead brother being born again not of corruptable deed but of Incorruptible by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever and the church said amen what are you born again by receiving God's seed into your soul so now it doesn't matter our mom my mom and dad doesn't matter what doesn't matter that has nothing to do with whether I'm saved or not now it did in the Old Testament remember God got mad at it in the days of Noah God said that's one reason I am destroying the Earth is because the sons of God saw the daughters of men right brother amen right and God said because of that I'm destroying the Earth well guess what even God's own children intermarried with the serpent seed line because Noah's sons either Noah and his sons are just Noah's sons they all married a woman who is of the serpent seed line and church everyone here today you can trace your DNA do you know they have this now you can trace your DNA back to one of Noah's Three Sons you can do it do you know Ken Ham from the Creation Museum he is of the sea line of Shem they trace his DNA back now that's a good one too because that's Abraham sea line ham Shem and everyone here they they can do it now a DNA you can trace it back to one of those three men but I got good news for you it don't matter which one you those you came from as long as you get the heavenly father sea line amen you got a ticket to heaven and a ticket to the Rapture praise God Amen you got to make sure your heavenly DNA H you got to make sure you got God's Heavenly DNA praise God this D this DNA will fail me right I might get cancer I might get Alzheimer's you know I'm talking about just what's the bad stuff in the DNA but God give us a greater DNA than that praise God hallelujah God give us the Holy Ghost amen hallelujah God's Own Spirit Hallelujah so we have God we have a portion of God's own life and that proves were in God's family amen amen thank you Jesus we sang a song the other night and it says uh I've been born again into a family and now his blood runs through my veins now not natural but I got spiritual life I have the life of the Holy Ghost running through my body amen hallelujah in other words I've got the the the life of my father is inside of me the spiritual DNA is working itself out in my life Hallelujah right your little ones going to grow up and we're going to see is she going to look like Mom or dad or like a mixture of both the DNA is going to come out pretty soon I can see a little bit of Miriam and Mah maybe a little more dad there you know see the DNA is coming out the same thing's true in the spiritual praise God the longer you love God the longer you believe this word the more you'll be like Christ hallelujah amen because you're born of his Seed Life Hallelujah you're born of the Holy Spirit how many can say Amen to that amen hallelujah that's what I want to want people to see Jesus in me praise God I don't want them to see Jesse they're going to see my mistakes eventually but as long as I can I want them to see Christ in me because that's that's who I'm born of that's my DNA Hallelujah my spiritual DNA all right evidence number nine we got there already see that that wasn't too long that was that about an hour by God's grace yeah it's been an hour sorry it's been an hour and 10 minutes so I'm gonna try to closer I think this is what Howard was saying too the seed of the woman was a literal man Jesus right God told Eve you're going to have seed well that seed was eventually Jesus two uh 4,000 years later and so the seed of the serpent was a literal man as well so some people will look at you know Genesis 3:15 and they'll say well God was just talking about a spiritual seed the the Serpent's spiritual seed but no it had the serpent had to have a literal seed because Eve had a literal seed isn't that powerful it everything lines up with this it lines up to be the truth praise God I've never seen this Doctrine fail I've never seen this teaching fail all these people give me comments and emails on YouTube never has it ever fallen now I don't have all the answers but God has all the answers Hallelujah and they can't deny what the Bible says what are you going to say well well I I don't want to hear that verse well that proves you lost the debate there if you don't want to if you don't want to acknowledge the Bible if you don't want to believe the Bible you don't have to but that means you lost the debate that means you're wrong [Music] right okay a couple more scriptures here I'm almost done um go to Proverbs 30:20 this is the one I I read I think I think I preached this the first time I was with you Proverbs 30:20 I was going through a list of the Mysteries brother B brought us Proverbs 30:20 some of you might remember this so this verse is what Eve did this is what Eve did always think of Eve when you read Proverbs 30: 20 this is what Eve did she committed adultery with the serpent remember is God God made her punishment in her loins her reproduction and God changed her craving to Adam instead of the serpent Proverbs 30:20 such is the way of an adulterous woman she eateth and wipeth her mouth and saith I have done no wickedness so this this is symbolism a woman goes commits adultery with a man the Bible said the Bible said the symbolism is like eating and wiping her mouth so eating was symbolic of adultery okay is that right and Eve ate whatever she ate of it produce two different seed lines two different offsprings okay can everybody see that it's a Bible principle that eating represents marriage relations right now do you need another or how familiar are you with of Solomon do you know you know that's in the Song of Solomon too Solomon had his wedding night and the Bible said I'm Solon said I'm going into my garden and I'm going to eat my Pleasant fruits in my garden he's talking about his wife his wife was a garden isn't Eve a garden don't don't our married sisters don't our married sisters bring forth fruit of the loins fruit of the womb is that right y'all thinking really deep aren't you that's the word of God that's right it is the word it's truth and just so you know we're not going to read it but it's Song of Solomon 5 verse1 that's the wedding night uh and Solomon says I've come into my garden I've eat I've eaten my spices I've drink my uh juices and all these things he's talking about the wedding night because eating and drinking is symbolic of marriage relationship bedroom relationship all right all right last thing I want to share go to Genesis 41 now this may be kind of new to you so bear with me here hope this isn't over our heads too much so most church members will read Genesis 4:1 and they'll say oh here's the first uh marriage relationship between Adam and Eve but remember Adam already called her a mother in the previous chapter she's already a mother before chapter 4:1 won my goodness and I got this recorded if you guys want a recording of this later I can share it to brother Irving want to go back and listen to this of course I wrote I got videos I got books about it brother R preaches sermons on it it's a blessing it says and Adam knew his wife Eve and she conceived in be Cain and said I have gotten a man from the Lord now the word new Adam new means sexual relations now the revelation is this here's the Revelation Church Genesis 41 repeats what Genesis 3:6 said with a literal interpretation along with further information about the act so Genesis 4:1 is actually what happened in Genesis 3:6 when Eve gave the fruit to her husband okay in Genesis 3:6 Eve gave fruit to Adam that was really having marriage relationship well Genesis 4:1 is just a literal interpretation of that symbolism I know that's kind of deep there but it's the truth the Bible often switches between symbolic to literal and I've got numerous examples in in Revelation 17 the mother Harlot is described as having a seven-headed beast and she's an evil woman in Revelation 17 how many know that it's a Roman Catholic Church it says she's got seven heads and she's a woman but is she really a woman she's a church so the Bible lists the symbolism first and then it gives the literal interpretation later hallelujah praise God amen just like genesis Genesis gave the symbolism eating the fruit in Genesis 3:6 and then it gives the literal interpretation in Genesis 4:1 symbolism then literal the same thing in Revelation 17 symbol form and literal praise God hallelujah so what are the seven heads represent on the mother Harlot the Seven Mountains on which she sits the seven ancient Hills of Rome okay so that's some deep that's some deep uh Revelation there it's also in Genesis chapter 1 in Genesis chapter 1 God records Mankind's creation on day six right Adam and Eve are created in Genesis chapter 1 but Genesis 2 gives the literal interpretation of it God puts Adam in a flesh body breathes life into him but remember that God already described that in Genesis chapter 1 the symbolism was first and the literal interpretation came later now if you didn't catch that don't feel bad I didn't catch that till a couple years ago s been in the message says 2001 the end of 2001 it's really 2002 so I caught this in 2021 said have been about 19 years it took me 19 years to catch it so don't feel bad if you don't if you didn't catch it but you can text me like brother R said you can text me with any questions all right so remember you don't have to know serpent seed to be saved and you're not condemned if you don't understand it all it does is bring light upon what we're trying to see we're trying to see the Bible restored we're trying to see the mysteries of God finished how many you understand that that's Revelation 10:7 says all the Mysteries will be finished praise God let's stand to our feet you're very good audience I kept you an hour and 15 minutes and you're very good very good listening again if you have any questions on that
