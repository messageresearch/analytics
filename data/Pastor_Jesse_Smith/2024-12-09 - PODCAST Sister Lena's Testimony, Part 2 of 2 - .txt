TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] God bless you and welcome to the defending the message podcast I'm your host Pastor Jesse Smith in today's podcast we're the second and final part of our sister Lena's testimony we trust her first part of her testimony was a blessing to all the saints who were able to listen to it I know for me it's always encouraging as I go back and listen to the podcast when I edit the podcast it stir up Faith in my heart it reminds me of God's grace his love his compassion his provision so again it's a great reminder of the power of a testimony because we overcome by the blood of the lamb and the word of Our Testimony so with that let's get into part two of our sister Lena's testimony now we'd like to hear about our sister and her conviction to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so when I decided to be baptized I don't remember too much like prior to the baptism I just remember Austin and I were talking about it and believe we decided together to get baptized and believe Austin just like reached out to brother Jesse and then set a time up for us to get baptized um yeah I don't remember too much I just know like when we were talking about it like I was really excited to do it and I just like I just remember being excited and really wanting to do it cuz at first I didn't really understand it too much until it was explained and stuff and then Austin was I believe Austin was talking to me about it and then that's when we went to we went to the Sheffield Church to use their pool inside their Church to get baptized and I was really excited and then like but prior to the baptism I got like really sick like right when we got there so then I was just like I won't go into that but then I was dealing with that and then like after I went and got baptized it's probably cuz like I was really nervous and then my nerves probably made me like really sick I get nervous a lot so like I was just nervous but yet really excited to do it and then finally when it was my turn to get baptized I just I don't know I just I was just happy like definitely like Supernatural but like it wasn't like anything too crazy besides like me just being like really excited to do it and just like excited for this next step in my life so then when it happened I was just like I was just really happy and I was just like oh praise God the water was I was just really cold cuz it was cold that night after we left but other than that it was just like it was just I don't know it was just beautiful I was just happy after it was done I was just like really excited and happy to see where the Lord takes me yeah was a very memorable night you know we got recordings of those and we watched them a couple times since then and the awesome thing is you know we went up to Sheffield and uh they were willing to give us warm water and uh meet with us I think on a Saturday night if I'm not mistaken and then the wonderful part about those Saints from Sheffield they're such wonderful Christians you know we've known them since 2001 and they open up their church and then I don't know if I told you both but they did follow-up calls they've done a couple you know three or four follow-up calls how is the brother and sister doing how's Austin are they still serving the lord and each time I've been able to say yes Hallelujah by God's grace they're doing great and then they just Rejoice so it's been a source of strength it's been a a great testimony you know that we could call upon the Lord and uh see two lives changed there and that was the outward expression of what had happened on the inside now our sister would like to share a testimony about a time when God heard a prayer and we felt the power of God fall on us on a Wednesday night service the Lord Jesus mightily answered our sister's request for one of her family members who was in a very desperate situation so there was like one night where I couldn't really like I couldn't sleep at all I was just like laying there tossing and turning like I it was just like sleepless night and then it was probably super early in the morning probably like 4 in the morning or something I get a call from my siblings in Arizona saying you know a family member of ours is not right it's just like going through something and not really right in the mind like allowing bad spirits to take over which led this family member to make some very irrational decisions which led to them going in my not knowing where she was not knowing what happened to her so like Austin and I are like really stressed and then I call my brother in California like we're like in different states so we don't know what we're doing so we're talking to our siblings and we're like okay so what are you guys doing about we're like they're just like oh you know I don't know it is what it is you know this person's around they can do what they want I'm like what do you mean call the cops why are we like not doing anything you guys are there with her so then that's when Austin and I and my brother in California all decided like yeah well we're going to have to call the cops just you know put out a missing person on her because if she's not in her right mind you know allowing these bad spirits to lead her to make these crazy decisions then you know we need to make sure like she's okay so then we called L have upd um so they and they put out a missing person report on her so like if someone saw her like with her car whatever the case may be they will call us and let us know like what's going on and like if they found her or not um so then Wednesday night um we came to church you know we let brother Jesse know everything that's going on and after service but Jesse's like you know we're all going to you know we're going to pray so like few the Saints stayed back inside the sanctuary and we're all praying okay so yeah it was Austin me brother Jesse and sister Naomi and we're all praying and you know during the prayer I'm like really kind of like doubting and it's like I don't know what's going to happen like it was a very nerve-wracking situation so then we're all praying and then sister Naomi is shouting Jesus Jesus Jesus and then a moment later Austin starts shouting Satan get out Satan get out and then it was just like a very emotional prayer and it was beautiful and the Holy Spirit was definitely there in the midst of it all you know leading us through that prayer and by the end of it I was feeling a bit like I was definitely encouraged but I was still like I don't I don't know what going to happen not necessarily doubting but I was just like it was like scary situation to be in with this family member um and I think I believe the following day we got a call from the police department letting us know they found this family member and you know she was admitted to the hospital and they're just keeping an eye on her and that she ended up being fine um she was in the hospital for a few days or so recovering and then she was able to go home to recover from there and the Lord it was all by the grace of God like the Lord definitely moved in that situation and by the grace of God this family member hasn't fell back into that and or allowed those spirits to take over her again so I'm definitely grateful for that as well it was just definitely beautiful beautiful testimony there yeah I remember that prayer that was a very Supernatural moment one of the most maybe desperate prayers you know we've ever prayed here at the church and it was amazing to see God answer the next day really a life was on the line I mean there was a lot of things we can't share but a life was on the line and God stepped in and uh it was powerful to see the name of Jesus called upon and then a rebuke against Satan because no doubt Satan comes to steal kill destroy Satan was trying to destroy that life but uh the spirit anointed Naomi and then brother Austin and called Jesus on the scene rebuked Satan and it was a very happy ending to a situation that was very desperate very dark and uh that turned into a great testimony where I think it was good so Austin Lena could see the power of God In Prayer you know and of course it was a great reminder to us I I love seeing the power of God In Prayer that was one of those rare special moments brother brand called him red letter days where just something amazing something Supernatural happens by the power of the Holy Spirit really gave us a chance to see God speaking right through people as they pray you know the Bible says if we don't know what to pray for the spirit of God will give us groanings and so there's groanings right Naomi's groaning um Austin's groaning and God shows up and answers the prayer so just amazing testimony there by the grace of God we still Rejoice even yet this day three years later you know we still Rejoice for what God has done his protection over our loved ones and and how they're safe to this day next we're going have our sister share about when she received the baptism of the Holy Ghost before I received the Holy Ghost a week prior I believe it was a week um I had like a spiritual attack from the enemy like never before that I can recall um I was laying in bed and I started falling asleep but out of nowhere I just like felt like really heavy something like really heavy on top of me like I couldn't move and then like the scientific term for it would be called sleep paralysis but I believe it's definitely like more spiritual and I definitely took it as like an attack from the enemy um and I'm just laying there and it's like I couldn't move like my eyes were open and I was just like it was just like really eerie feeling and I don't it was like I was scared for a second and then like in my head I'm just like I don't remember what I was praying but I was just like I believe I just was like Jesus calling out to Jesus and then like I was able to like move again and then I just like got up and I just started praying like I just I was praying I was praying you know over my husband cuz I was just like I don't know what just happened that was scary and I definitely felt like it was like an attack from the enemy and like now I think about it I believe it was you know and went to sleep I put on like some Christian instrumentals that way like that's it's going in my head as I'm falling back to sleep again um it was just like it was scary for a moment it wasn't like too bad of a attack cuz sometimes like when people get sleep paralysis they it goes as far as like seeing like act like bad spirits or whatever you may see but I didn't go that far I just felt like really heavy and like this really dark Eerie feeling but after that you know after I prayed it was all fine and then probably like the following week I don't know I was just like the middle of the day and I just like decided to pray you know and um I'm in my room and I'm just praying you know I'm calling out to Jesus and I just was like you know like asking God like you know I don't I don't want to be in control you know um like sometimes like I feel like I'm stuck in my ways and I just want to feel like feel like I'm in control but like I'm not like I have to give it to God and I'm just praying I'm like you know I'm repentant I'm like I'm sorry Lord you know I don't want to be in control like I can't you know I can't do this like I can't do this without you like I don't I don't know what I'm doing and then um you know I'm praying and then like out of nowhere like I just started I just started shouting Jesus like I don't I've never prayed like this before and I was just like you know Jesus screaming his name you know and I was just like I you know I can't do this alone you know and then like it was just like for a second I just I just I just like it was just like not for a very long time but just for a second I just like saw like his nail scared hand reach out to me just and it was just like for a second so I was just like I don't know if I actually saw that or like did I come up with that in my head so like I was really doubting a while after like all this happen but like after I got down with the pray I just felt I don't know I felt different and um I don't know I felt different I felt free I felt happy and I was just like so joyful and then um but right after that I was just like it was definitely something Supernatural that I was really doubting um for a while after twoo cuz I'm just like cuz I was like I think I got the Holy Ghost but like I don't know like I don't was that what that was or was that just like a really just like just a supernatural prer or was but I was like no I I believe I did but I was still doubting cuz I'm just like I don't know so just like for a while after I'm just like praying you know talking to God I'm just like was that it like did you fil me with the Holy Ghost and then like it didn't click till like I believe it was a Sunday actually like we're in church and then like I'm praying at my seat and I'm just like yeah I did and then like I'm just writing in my journal because I like to write as much as I can because like if I don't write it's just in my head and I'll go crazy so I'm just like writing and then like after I was praying and stuff I was like yeah I did get the Holy Ghost and then I was writing and then like when I got done writing that whole testimony down I was just like I have to give it and then like this is true like I I really got the Holy Ghost like I he really filled me like and it was just amazing and I was just so happy cuz I was like I knew it like you know I was doubting but like I KN like I knew that's what it was so then I wasn't even going to give it but I just felt led to like write it down in my journal and and like you know give the test Tony and then that Sunday that's when you know I gave the testimony to the church and that's my story yeah I remember that Sunday morning when you gave your testimony what a wonderful testimony uh we can all see your sincerity we can all see your love for God uh the change uh everything you know everything in your life is growing more like Christ all the time more faith more joy more Victory and what was also Supernatural was that a sister in the church sister Hua had two dreams about uh sister Lena receiving the Holy Ghost beforehand and so again we know the spirit of Jesus Christ is the spirit of Prophecy so those dreams are quite prophetic uh in nature so we thank the Lord for given our sister those dreams and then she shared them with sister Lena and that gave her I'm sure Faith and Hope and courage uh to keep pressing on by God's grace but it's awesome to see God give us dreams and then uh come to pass by the grace of God another very special important day was uh the day brother Austin and sister Lena got married so we want to share a few testimonies about that God did a few Supernatural things there as a day we look back on and remember what a wonderful day God bringing two together and uh we certainly saw God's blessing on every part of the day so we'll let our sister share a little bit about that by God's grace so yeah so our wedding day was act like oh it was one of the best days of my life next to Salvation of course but it was definitely a wonderful day and it went by so fast which made me sad um but before the actual wedding um my brother and my sister-in-law you know they flew out here for my w for our wedding um and they're on the way to the wedding when my brother Dwayne said he saw a ball of light in the sky I believe it was um which is pretty crazy to hear because I was like oh wow you know I don't know that was just pretty awesome and then um just like my family being here experiencing like and meeting like my um Brothers and Sisters in Christ how they were you know they were just really shocked about how like how everyone's so loving and just like how was just like different from any other you know Church environment they've been in it was just like yeah there's love here you know my brother even mentioned to me just like how comfortable and happy he is just like seeing the people I'm surrounded by cuz you know as a brother he wants the best for me and just like want to make sure like you know the life I'm living here is just like for the best and so coming here and just like meeting everybody and realizing how God is in the center of it all it was just like really encouraging to to him and just like a really big blessing to him he was just like wow like this is amazing I'm happy like you're here with this surrounded by these people like they're they're like loving people you know and it's like it's all by the grace of God you know um so that was like really beautiful even like guest wise with the wedding like I feel like there was like a lot of people who like didn't show up last minute or you know just no showed on us but but it was just like I found that a blessing just because I felt like everyone who was supposed to be there was there and it was just like a small you know small to me from like um intimate wedding and it was just like really beautiful and I'm was really happy about that um just also just like hearing how blessed like people were by um even you know being there is like really beautiful a lot of people enjoy it even the sermon brother Jesse gave um that day my mom really loved it and just like talking to people they really loved it um so that was also really beautiful um I don't know and then just the wedding itself just getting married was just like I was just like so surreal the whole day I was just like wow I'm really I'm really becoming a wife and it was just it's amazing like I don't know I never I never been the one to really like think about like my wedding until you know I got with Austin and I'm like oh wow yeah this is real we're actually getting married and it's it's amazing like it it's beautiful and I'm just like it was all L of the Lord like everything that happened L of the Lord to this day like the Lord definitely brought us together and it's just like Vindication after Vindication of like seeing how I know like we're supposed to be together cuz I just see it in our lives like I can see that the Lord was like yeah you're you're his rip you know so it was just it's really that just that whole day was just amazing it was definitely a blessing and it turned out beautiful and I'm just really grateful for it all and just like being married I don't know just being a wife to Austin is just great by the grace of God and just being able to see like what the Lord is doing in our lives and like where he's bringing us together it's just amazing yeah it was such a special day um you know Sister Lena and all the Bridesmaids were dressed so modestly it's one of the most modest weddings you know uh I've ever seen that was very beautifully done the landlord was even a blessing um letting us rent out the room for free I mean God God put that on her heart and she's like oh yeah of course you guys can use it whenever you want you know and then to see all the work Austin Lena put into the deck decorations and then other people came around and helped and all the food you know we were worried I know I was worried about the number of people and if there's enough food we had a ton of food and it wasn't even an issue and all the people that were there just had a a fantastic time in the presence of God we got to talk to some of Austin Lena's work friends that didn't know the Lord I got to tell them about the Lord they got to hear that sermon um and uh enjoy the songs and I think Austin did one of the most romantic songs I've ever seen in my life I was so proud of him hopefully he can release that song to the world at some point I'm going to love you for the rest of my life it was so inspired such a beautiful song I hope uh the Saints get to hear that by God's grace and that's what Austin has done he's loved Lena and he's going to keep doing that by God's grace and uh they do compliment each other very well just like sister Lena said they're perfect for one another with their strengths and weaknesses and their love for the lord it's been awesome to see them grow together by the grace of God I didn't mention this but like how much of a bless think it was with the sisters in the Church of how like everyone came together and like made sure we had food I didn't mention that before but like I don't know it was waiting on me I was like wait I forgot so I wanted to mention that because I don't know without them I don't I don't by the grace of God we have them and then like couple of your daughters helping us I won't say their Nam you know helping us get the room together like just like just all the sisters in the church came together to make sure we had you know a beautiful wedding so just wanted to mention that as well yeah it was a real uh work of the body of Christ everybody came together it was certainly a highlight moment to Austin Lena returning in 2021 and then we're married the next year in 2022 you know it was really phenomenal how God worked it all out we are all looking forward to this um just one of the most Happy Days of our lives here in the last few years so we're thankful that God brought you together and everybody played their part to make it a beautiful day also it's been really wonderful to see how the spirit of God has been using sister Lena in different ways in particular it seems like with the gift of discernment we know the word discernment means to judge and uh it means of course to judge the motive or objective behind a person or situation uh judge is the spirit of God or is it not and so we have a number of testimonies here we'd like to share with how the spirit of God has been anointed our sister and using her of course this would encourage anybody who's looking to try to find their gift or um might have questions about the gift of God in their life you know it seems like God is using our sister in this particular channel so we'll let her share some of those brother Austin and and I can share some too by God's grace first testimony I'll give is about sister Kristen um I just remember her I don't remember if she mentioned that she wasn't feeling well but I just remember um we're standing and singing it praying I don't remember which one we were doing I think we were singing and I just felt led to go and put my hand on her shoulder and like pray for her I don't know it was like the first time I felt that way being here so I'm just and then like when it first came to me I just ignored it and I was just like I don't know like I was just like I don't know if I should should I do it I was second guessing I was like I don't know if I should do it should I and then it was just like getting stronger and I was just like all right so then I walked to the back and I placed my hand on her and I was praying for her I don't remember if I asked her if I could pray for her or if I just started praying um but I prayed for her um it was just a short prayer just I just felt led to do it and then after it was over I just went back to my seat believe I went back to my seat and I think I gave her a hug first and then I went back to my seat I don't remember my memories is not the best but um yeah I went back to my seat and then later on I remember her telling me how it was a blessing and how it really helped her by the grace of God yeah I don't remember too much but that's just what I remember and it's all by the grace of God Amen that reminds us of the scripture we read today about uh St Paul in Acts chapter 18 he was pressed in his Spirit to do something you know to basically start the the church there in Corinth and uh stay there and Minister there for a year and a half so wonderful to hear how God pressed your spirit uh to go pray for my wife and uh my wife said it truly blessed her just what she needed and that was January 1st 2023 so great way to start the new year get somebody to pray for you in the hour that you need them to pray for you and I'm just going to throw in a couple that I know of from the uh recent years made it really obvious that she has a gift of discernment is um just generally a lot of times I'll be thinking something and she'll ask me a question pertaining to what I was thinking and I'm like how do she it's really crazy it happens all the time actually or or I'll uh I'll be feeling like stressed out or overwhelmed but I won't be showing it or displaying it at all to where nobody knows and so just sent me down hey are you good you know you overwhelmed and I'm like how do you you know and I'll just you know it's it's really crazy um and it's it's not like it shows like it doesn't show is where it makes it very Supernatural where I'm just completely regular but she'll come out of nowhere when I'm acting normal laughing happy and she hey I feel like you're really overwhelmed and I'm like what you know how do you you know all right just a example that really has no purpose she uh like I guess this is kind of gift to discernment but one day we were talking and she was like I really want to do jury duty I like okay yeah that sounds pretty fun she's like I just looks so fun and she's like I really want to do jury duty and then literally three days three days later in the mail she got summoned for jury duty it was like I I can't make this up man it's insane or um you know we're driving she's like hey you're you're speeding a little bit she was like you know there's probably a cop up here and I'm like nah you know my bad you know it's probably not but my bad and you know I'm always in a rush but literally there was a cop that just popped up out of nowhere I was like oh there's actually an officer there I'm like man I got to really watch my speed and it's nothing crazy I'm not like going 50 and a 25 but just like maybe like seven eight nine 10 over and she's like hey what are you doing uh so that's a little stuff but something major recently that happened is um God helped me open a business and helped Lena and I just really learn how to run a business and so it's cool he's been helping us that way but recently um we trained dogs and we got a really bad review on our Facebook from a lady that was just trying to harass us we didn't actually do anything bad to this lady but she was just trying to harass us and it really uh stressed me out cuz everybody that knows me knows I really care about you know my my clients like deeply and I really do my best for them um so it really stressed me out for some reason I thought it was the end of the world you know we there just because you can't get rid of reviews and I'm like oh no what if somebody reads this and it steers them away and they're like this dude's awful whole time it it wasn't a true one but it just stressed me out it kept me up all night like it was really bad and Lena told me that God told her this was going to happen um the day before but she didn't really tell me because she didn't realize it was discernment she just got the thought she was like oh okay you know she didn't tell me until it happened and then once it happened she was like freaking out she was like oh God told me this was going to happen to you and the way I know was a spiritual attack it just wasn't some person giving us a review is then somebody connected to her also left bad review so that was double but the profile picture on Facebook of this new lady that left a review was like if you saw the it was like satanic it was literally a satanic picture um and the lady's Facebook page had nothing on it it was just literally an empty profile with a satanic profile picture and um you know so Lena told me that God told her this was going to happen but it's just a trial in which case it did stress me out I don't feel like I failed the trial though it just stressed me out but nothing happened so I was just stressed out over it but with hindsight the um the reviews are just gone magically so it's cool they're just I mean it's not magically but you know they're gone when you can't get rid of them uh but the reviews are gone and everything's good all of my clients saw it and we had all of our clients just flood our Facebook with great reviews honest ones I mean it was for me I didn't even need to stress about it but it was crazy because Lena God told Lena it was going to happen or another time we can be talking to people or she'll get a thought about her sister call her sister and then her sister will tell her something bad happened before she knew or and and she'll just go I got to call my sister um or her mom you know or like really anything so it's like she'll know things without knowing it and that's why I believe she has the gift of discernment because it's like she doesn't know that it's God when it happens she just goes huh I have this strange feeling and then she actually listens to the feeling and then it turns out to be true and she had no way of knowing that was even going on so that's why I believe it's the gift so this is an older example but we were getting an apartment and it was going really good we're talking to the realtor or the management lady and me and brother Jesse thought it was great experience right and then we get home and Lena goes hey I think that lady is a little a little messed up or a little uh what's the word I'm looking for little untrustworthy I guess there's a better word but when you know I had no clue brother Jesse thought it was great and she's like no that lady's something's up with her you know and then um we did go to the apartment and there was mold in it and that's why we didn't get the apartment cuz that's why we left our last apartment but there was something that indicated that she was a little um fishy of a person which I had no clue I didn't pick up on and and but basically with hindsight we were proven that this lady was a little fishy but our whole experience with her she didn't display anything to me her brother Jesse that indicated that she was even the slightest bit on trustworthy but Lena soon as we get home she was like there's something up with that lady you know and I was like huh that's interesting you know so that was true I can't remember what it was but that was true so it's been M multiple instances where she'll just come out of the blue to somebody and say something and it was like um she had no way of knowing or she can read a situation and go hey this is false or hey they're lying or um yeah so it's just really really wonderful because I'll look at her in a situation and going hey what is what is this you know how do you feel about like I I often find myself now asking her to pray certain things when we need a sign or when we need to know an answer for something because it God's showing us time and time again that she has a gift of discernment so I'll rely on her connection with God because I don't believe I have the gift of discernment you know and it's supernatural so I'll sometimes rely on her gift and ask her certain things how she feels or how is classic example we train dogs and dogs live with us now and when we're gone I get anxious because I'm like the dogs so I'll ask her every day hey how are the dogs how and it sounds funny but seriously I look at her I'm like hey how are the dogs and she'll go no no no they're good they're good they're good I'm like okay cool or she'll be like now we should go check on them and then we go and check on them and we go in and something actually did happen and I'm like oh yeah so recently like I usually am anxious to get home I got to go check on the dogs cuz they're not our dogs and I want them to be safe and stuff and uh recently I'm like how are the dogs and she's like I don't know we we should probably go check on the we were at church last Sunday and she was like she never is wor worried about the dogs when we leave but this last Sunday she was like we should probably go home and check on the dogs but this time I was like no we're good they're good every time we'll be good and she was like okay and then we get home and we come inside and one of our dogs broke out of the crate and just roam in the house happy as ever man ate all my birthday um jerky all my birthday snacks off the table I walk in the house he's just bouncing around he did nothing wrong he's like hey like thanks for coming went back he's just all happy tail waging he didn't destroy anything he just ate the snacks off the table he was just hanging out nothing bad happened but he did break out of the crate which this never happened and we had to buy a new crate because of it cuz I'm like that can't happen again but yeah so the one time she was like we should go check on the dogs and I was like no we're good and then she was we should have listened you know what I mean so she doesn't know it's God when it happens but when she goes off of that leading it's always true it's always been true and it's you know so that's shown to be the um gifted discernment to me like I so I I'll rely on that gift sometimes and I'll just ask her things because I really trust it because I trust her connection to God not that I'm trusting in her but I just rely on it where that's where we kind of help each other out you know because I I I literally rely on her with some questions and I just go off of how she feels and I trusted enough that she's prayed up you know and she's has a good relationship with God that whatever answer she gives me I just go with it I'm like well okay cool I'll just I just trust her you know and it helps me out with my anxiety so it's pretty good it's really cool very Supernatural thing happening there to go into the one like where the dog broke out the crate prior to that I was putting the dog away and I was just like we probably should get a new crate this crate is like kind of flimsy I feel like you know it's time for a new one I feel like a dog can break out of this one and then I just ignored it and then I had that thought again I was like we should probably lock this crate up better I feel like something could happen um and then I just ignored it I was like H whatever and then literally a couple days or so later the dog got out and I was just like awesome so don't ignore it by the grace of God that reminds me of Hebrews 4:12 the word of God is quick powerful sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to dividing a under the Soul and Spirit and of the joints and Marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart and I remember back at that apartment complex I thought that woman was very legitimate I was shocked when Austin told me you know what you had said sister Lena but then yeah when we heard back from her something with the contract or something with money it was going to lock you in too long or there was something dishonest about it and then God you know again Vindicated how you know he's been speaking to Sister Lena in that way a very good judge of character uh judging the spirits Discerning the thoughts intents of the heart so very thankful for that and uh and the Bible said iron sharpens iron you know so a married couple aelina they're sharpening one another helping one another out uh the Bible said three-fold chord how it's not quickly broken so Christ is anointing Austin and Lena uniting them together and helping them to serve God in this time and season of their lives by God's grace well we come to the conclusion of this podcast we're very thankful for our sister Lena and brother Austin giving the testimonies there it's been wonderful so encouraged by the grace of God I love going back with the old memories you know just like went through sister who's testimony brother amen and um sister Naomi's testimonies down through the years we're so thankful it's always it's always so encouraging to look back and see what God has done we always want to remember how God has uh moved amongst his people blessed us protected uh guided provided for us in all these ways so we'll let our sister give her closing remarks possibly some advice about people that have gone through poverty or domestic trouble or gone through uh big moves in life big changes in life maybe been raised in in very unfortunate circumstances but words of encouragement of how God has his eye on you and uh God is gracious and God is the great Redeemer something I would you know say is just basically just like you're not alone cuz like you may feel alone a lot me personally I did a lot in that growing up that way um have no not feeling secure just like you're not alone you know God's God's definitely watching over you and he has a plan for our lives and I definitely didn't feel it at the time but I'm I see it now and I see that the Lord allows everything and he definitely wouldn't give us anything we cannot handle you know with him on our side and and I'm actually crazy to say but I'm just grateful for the life I had just because it just it's molded me into this charact this person I am today you know and the Lord is still shaping me into the person he needs me to be and just being reminded all the time that he's with me you know and he was with me you know during the toughest parts of my life where I felt like my whole world is falling apart multiple times and feeling not really caring about myself not really taking care of myself not caring what happened but like the whole time God was with me pulling me through so I I just want to remind everyone that just like God's with you even when you don't feel like it he's there because I wouldn't have got through half of the things I've gotten through you know without him um and like the darkest parts of my life where I just was lost he was there and I definitely see that so that's just what I wanted to say to you guys just like if you grew up in that way and it's also just like being someone who's new to the message you know as a sister just and this is something I need to practice more as well but just like you know it's okay to go to the other sisters in the church who's also you know who's been here longer who can help you get through you know the tough times I need to you know practice this a bit more too but it's okay to like rely on them and like go to them when you're feeling lost because they understand you know they've been through it they've experienced it longer so that's just something I would say to the sisters just yeah wonderful words there beautiful words you know I just looked in my Bible app and there's 11 verses that specifically say I am with thee God told that to Jacob on numerous occasions uh Isaiah spoke it by the Holy Ghost numerous times twice God spoke it through Jeremiah five times and then the Lord Jesus told St Paul in Acts 18:10 for I am with thee so such wonderful encouraging words from our sister thank you for giving your testimony sister Lena it's a blessing I trust the Lord will use it to be a blessing to others as well thank you brother Austin for all you did as well wish your love brother Austin and sister Lena so that brings this podcast to a conclusion friends
