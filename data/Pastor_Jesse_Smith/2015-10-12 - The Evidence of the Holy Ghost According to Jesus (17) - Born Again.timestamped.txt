[0:13] greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:15] of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of
[0:18] this video is to teach what is the true
[0:20] evidence for the baptism of the Holy
[0:22] Ghost According To Jesus
[0:25] himself recall that the baptism of the
[0:27] Holy Ghost is the third work of Grace
[0:30] that very few people will receive and so
[0:32] the evidence of experiencing this third
[0:34] work of Grace we are about to teach from
[0:37] the words of Jesus himself will be
[0:39] rarely found in the world
[0:41] today the
[0:44] evidence let us Begin by plainly stating
[0:47] that Jesus's evidence for receiving the
[0:48] Holy Ghost was and still is the
[0:52] following the Holy Ghost is a seal
[0:55] according to Ephesians 4:30 inside of
[0:57] you guiding you into all truth of the
[1:00] the word of God that he has revealed in
[1:02] the age in which you
[1:07] live to State it in other words the Holy
[1:10] Ghost fil believer will do the following
[1:13] they will be in the word all the way
[1:16] they will live and obey the word of God
[1:18] for their day and hour they will receive
[1:21] the word from the human messenger who is
[1:23] preaching the true word of God to their
[1:26] generation they will have the spirit of
[1:28] Christ in them perform performing the
[1:30] same works that Jesus
[1:35] did the true evidence of the Holy Ghost
[1:38] is found in the following scriptures
[1:39] according to Jesus himself St John 6:45
[1:43] John 16:13 John 13:20 and John
[1:48] 14:12 John 6:45 it is written in the
[1:52] prophets and they shall be all taught of
[1:54] God every man therefore that hath heard
[1:57] and hath learned of the father cometh
[1:59] unto me
[2:00] Jesus taught that only the children of
[2:02] God can learn and be taught the word of
[2:05] God According To Jesus himself Children
[2:07] of the devil cannot understand the Bible
[2:10] and will not obey it John 8:43 why do
[2:14] you not understand my speech even
[2:16] because you cannot hear my word ye are
[2:18] of your father the devil and the lust of
[2:20] your father ye will do he was a murder
[2:23] from the beginning and Abode not in the
[2:24] truth because there is no truth in him
[2:28] when he speaketh a lie he speak of his
[2:30] own for he is a liar and the father of
[2:32] it and because I tell you the truth you
[2:35] believe me
[2:36] not furthermore Jesus said that make
[2:39] Believers or Sinners of the world could
[2:42] not receive the spirit of Truth in John
[2:45] 14:17 even the spirit of Truth whom the
[2:48] world cannot receive because it seeth
[2:50] him not neither knoweth him but ye know
[2:53] him for he dwelleth with you and shall
[2:55] be in
[2:58] you second we will will quote Jesus from
[3:00] John
[3:02] 16:13 how be it when he the spirit of
[3:04] Truth is come he will guide you into all
[3:07] truth so a true Holy Ghost filled
[3:10] believer today will be guided deeper
[3:12] into the understanding and living all
[3:14] the truth of the Bible they will hunger
[3:17] and thirst for righteousness according
[3:18] to Matthew 5:6 and seek to live by every
[3:21] word that proceeds out of the mouth of
[3:23] God according to Matthew
[3:26] 4:4 they will not be a lukewarm backslid
[3:29] Bible rejecting sin loving church
[3:34] member third we will quote Jesus from
[3:37] John 13 verse 20 verily verily I say
[3:40] unto you he that receiveth whomsoever I
[3:42] send receiveth me and he that receiveth
[3:45] me receiveth him that sent me Jesus
[3:49] taught that he himself would be sending
[3:51] messengers of his truth and if anyone
[3:53] receive those Messengers and their
[3:55] preaching it would be the same as if
[3:57] they receive the preaching of Jesus
[3:59] himself
[4:00] how important it is for us to receive
[4:03] the human messenger that has or will
[4:05] preach to Our
[4:07] Generation by the grace of God we
[4:10] believe God's Messenger to our
[4:11] generation has come and gone but not
[4:14] without leaving us infallible proofs
[4:16] that he was God's messenger for these
[4:18] last days William brandham who lived
[4:20] from 1909 to
[4:22] 1965 is in our opinion the most
[4:25] bible-based preacher and Holy Ghost
[4:27] Vindicated Prophet messenger Our
[4:29] Generation has ever witnessed his
[4:32] undeniable Supernatural prophetic son of
[4:36] man gift of discernment is without
[4:38] comparison in any realm or religious
[4:40] Circle because it was Jesus Christ
[4:42] himself manifesting through his humble
[4:44] servant brother brandham please see the
[4:47] video three Prophecies of William
[4:48] brandham for a detailed look at this
[4:51] Supernatural son of man
[4:56] Ministry we believe a true Holy Ghost
[4:59] fill belever will receive William
[5:00] brandham as the god-sent messenger for
[5:02] the last days for brother brandham
[5:04] preached the word of God by stating thus
[5:07] sayeth the Lord just as God told another
[5:09] genuine Prophet named Ezekiel to do
[5:12] Ezekiel 30:2 son of man prophesy and say
[5:16] thus sayeth the Lord God how ye woe
[5:19] worth the
[5:21] day fourth the person or Spirit of
[5:24] Christ himself the Holy Ghost will
[5:27] perform the same works in the life of
[5:28] the true Christian as Jesus did when his
[5:31] physical body was here on the earth John
[5:34] 14:12 verily verily I say unto you he
[5:37] that believeth on me the works that I do
[5:40] shall he do also and Greater Works than
[5:42] these shall he do because I go unto my
[5:46] father the evidence in
[5:50] action since the evidence of the Holy
[5:52] Ghost is receiving the word of God for
[5:54] your day we realize this could sound
[5:56] vague to some people so we want to share
[5:58] numerous actions s Jesus taught that
[6:01] True Believers would manifest in their
[6:03] daily life let's see what the evidence
[6:05] in action looks like in the life of a
[6:07] true
[6:08] Christian first Jesus said his true
[6:11] disciples would have love one for
[6:12] another John
[6:14] 13:35 by this shall all men know that
[6:16] you are my disciples if you have love
[6:19] one to
[6:22] another second Jesus said his true
[6:24] believers would have Supernatural and
[6:26] Powerful signs of the holy ghost
[6:28] following them in their Ministries and
[6:31] that is because they first received the
[6:32] true word of God signs always follow the
[6:35] true word of God Mark 1617 and these
[6:39] signs shall follow them that believe in
[6:41] my name shall they cast out Devils they
[6:43] shall speak with new tongues they shall
[6:45] take up serpents and if they drink any
[6:47] deadly thing it shall not hurt them they
[6:49] shall lay hands on the sick and they
[6:51] shall
[6:54] recover third Jesus said the Holy Ghost
[6:57] would abide or dwell with the true
[6:59] belever Believers
[7:00] always John 14:16 and I will pray the
[7:04] father and he shall give you another
[7:05] comforter that he may abide with you
[7:09] forever fourth Jesus said the Holy Ghost
[7:12] would bring his own words to the
[7:13] remembrance of the True Believers John
[7:17] 14:26 but the comforter which is the
[7:19] Holy Ghost whom the father will send in
[7:21] my name he shall teach you all things
[7:24] and bring all things to your remembrance
[7:26] whatsoever I have said unto you
[7:30] fifth Jesus said the Holy Ghost would
[7:32] testify or witness of Jesus and also
[7:35] glorify Jesus A True Believer will
[7:38] always glorify Jesus only and filter all
[7:40] their thoughts and teachings through the
[7:42] words of Jesus in the
[7:45] Bible John 15:26 and 27 but when the
[7:49] comforters come whom I will send unto
[7:51] you from the father even the spirit of
[7:53] Truth which proceedeth from the father
[7:55] he shall testify of me and ye also shall
[7:59] bear witness because you have been with
[8:00] me from the beginning John 1614 and 15
[8:05] he shall glorify me for he shall receive
[8:08] of mine and show it unto you all things
[8:11] that the father hath are mine therefore
[8:13] said I that he shall take of mine and
[8:16] shall show it unto
[8:19] you six Jesus said the Holy Ghost would
[8:22] reprove or convict or expose the world
[8:26] of their sin and convict them of the
[8:28] righteousness and judgments of God John
[8:32] 16:
[8:33] 7-1 nevertheless I tell you the truth it
[8:36] is expedient for you that I go away for
[8:38] if I go not away the comforter will not
[8:40] come unto you but if I depart I will
[8:43] send him unto you and when he has come
[8:45] he will reprove the world of sin and of
[8:48] righteousness and of Judgment of sin
[8:51] because they believe not on me of
[8:53] righteousness because I go to my father
[8:55] and you shall see me no more of judgment
[8:57] because the prince of this world is is
[9:01] judged Jesus will always urge his
[9:04] followers to repent of their sins in
[9:07] fact Jesus taught us to be zealous which
[9:09] means eagerly desirous to repent of our
[9:12] sins especially in these last days the L
[9:15] to see in church age Revelation 3: 19 as
[9:19] many as I love I rebuke and chasen be
[9:22] zealous therefore and
[9:25] repent the Bible teaches we should hate
[9:27] sin according to Romans 7 ver1
[9:30] 15 and strive for a perfect holy life
[9:33] according to 2 Corinthians
[9:36] 7:1 if you love Jesus and are born again
[9:39] you will hate your sin and strive to
[9:41] live a perfect life of Holiness before
[9:43] God Jude 1 123 says we should hate sin
[9:47] as well hating even the Garment spotted
[9:50] by the
[9:52] flesh seventh a True Believer will
[9:55] overcome the sin and Temptation Of The
[9:57] World the gates or c of Hell will not
[10:00] Prevail against the true Christian 1
[10:03] John 5:4 for whatsoever is born of God
[10:06] overcometh the world and this is the
[10:08] victory that overcometh the world even
[10:10] our
[10:12] faith eighth a True Believer will know
[10:16] about the future because the Holy Ghost
[10:18] will show them prophecy about what is to
[10:20] come John 16:13 through1 15 how be it
[10:25] when he the spirit of Truth is come he
[10:27] will guide you into all Truth for for he
[10:29] shall not speak of himself but
[10:31] whatsoever he shall hear that shall he
[10:33] speak and he will show you things to
[10:36] come we are so thankful that the Holy
[10:39] Ghost still prophesies and foretells the
[10:43] future we have produced two videos that
[10:45] share numerous prophecies about the
[10:46] future and we encourage you to view them
[10:49] God has foretold us about the following
[10:52] topics the mark of the beast Rome and
[10:55] the Vatican the United States advances
[10:58] in science and and reassuring prophecies
[11:00] for True
[11:01] Christians the spirit has shown us
[11:03] things to come just as Jesus
[11:08] Promised ninth true Christians will not
[11:11] add anything to the Bible or take
[11:13] anything away from the Bible according
[11:15] to Revelations 22: 18 and
[11:19] 19 most denominations and non-
[11:21] denominational churches began based upon
[11:24] their own interpretations of the Bible
[11:26] and this is very dangerous each set of
[11:29] Creeds or bylaws if not written by the
[11:31] Holy Ghost quickly becomes a cursed
[11:34] thing because the writing usually adds
[11:36] to the Bible or takes away from the
[11:39] Bible for example many churches add to
[11:42] the Bible by teaching that we should
[11:44] pray to Mary or other Saints who've
[11:46] already died Jesus and St Paul never
[11:48] taught intercession through Saints and
[11:51] so this is a clear addition to the word
[11:52] of God many churches take away from the
[11:55] Bible by not preaching simple Holiness
[11:58] standards that are clearly taught in the
[12:00] Bible such as women abstaining from
[12:02] wearing makeup and cutting their hair
[12:04] just to name a few simple
[12:06] examples So True Believers today will
[12:09] only have one Creed and that will be the
[12:11] full word of Christ everything in the
[12:13] Bible so that nothing is added and
[12:16] nothing is taken away the evidence has
[12:19] always been the
[12:21] same if Jesus Christ is the same
[12:23] yesterday today and forever according to
[12:26] Hebrews 13:8 then the evidence of being
[12:28] a true follower of his must have been
[12:31] the same in every age as well that means
[12:34] receiving and living the word of God for
[12:35] your age has always been and always will
[12:38] be the evidence of those who are truly
[12:40] born again or are True Believers in
[12:43] Jesus Christ this proves that speaking
[12:45] in tongues cannot be the evidence of
[12:47] being a True Believer today because that
[12:50] gift has never been the evidence in the
[12:51] past and never will be in the future
[12:54] either recently we produced a video that
[12:57] gave seven Bible proofs that tongues
[12:59] were not the evidence of the Holy Ghost
[13:01] we hope you will view this video and
[13:03] pray about the truths contained in it
[13:05] trusting you will find the true evidence
[13:07] of the Holy Ghost through the words of
[13:09] Jesus Christ himself as we have
[13:11] presented on this
[13:13] video Let's briefly look at four simple
[13:17] Bible examples of how the evidence of
[13:19] being a True Believer which is receiving
[13:21] and living the word for your age has
[13:24] always been the same as we will recall
[13:26] the lives and ministries of Noah Moses
[13:29] John the Baptist and St
[13:31] Paul in Noah's day eight True Believers
[13:34] were saved from the worldwide flood why
[13:37] were they saved they were saved because
[13:39] they received the word of God for their
[13:41] day which was repent of your sin and
[13:43] seek life and deliverance in the ark
[13:46] Noah and seven other genuine Believers
[13:48] obeyed and listened to the righteous
[13:50] words of God according to 2 Peter 2:5
[13:53] while the rest of the world were blindly
[13:55] worshiping the wicked imaginations of
[13:57] their hearts continually according to
[13:59] Genesis
[14:01] 6:5 in Moses's day only two Believers
[14:05] made it into the promised land Caleb and
[14:07] Joshua these two men had the evidence of
[14:09] being true believers because they were
[14:11] guided into all the truth of Moses's
[14:14] message they were Believers in the words
[14:16] of God all the way the Bible said Caleb
[14:19] had another spirit in numbers 14:24 so
[14:23] Joshua would have also had this Holy
[14:25] Spirit anointing him as
[14:27] well both men heard the word of God for
[14:30] their day from the human messenger god
[14:32] had chosen for that day which was Moses
[14:35] then Joshua and Caleb obeyed Moses's
[14:37] command from God and lived all the word
[14:40] for their day while the Bible said that
[14:42] the majority of the Israelites who died
[14:44] in the wilderness were destroyed because
[14:46] they did not believe God and his servant
[14:48] Moses according to Jude
[14:52] 1:5 in John the Baptist's day the Bible
[14:55] plainly teaches that the True Believers
[14:57] of his day heard his words and repented
[15:00] confessing their sins and being baptized
[15:02] by him in the wilderness according to
[15:04] Matthew 3: 1 2 and
[15:07] 7 obeying the word of God that came to
[15:10] John and being baptized in water was the
[15:12] evidence of being a True Believer in
[15:14] that day the Pharisees and lawyers
[15:17] rejected the counsel of God through
[15:18] John's preaching and refused to be
[15:21] baptized by John according to Luke
[15:23] 7:30 John the Baptist called those who
[15:25] rejected his message a Generation of
[15:28] Vipers according to Matthew 3:
[15:31] 7 in St Paul's day the Bible teaches how
[15:35] the Saints at Ephesus received the word
[15:37] of God for their day in Acts 19: 1-6
[15:41] these Believers had the evidence of
[15:43] being true believers because they
[15:44] willingly obeyed Paul's command to be
[15:47] re-baptized in water in the name of the
[15:49] Lord Jesus for the gift of the Holy
[15:52] Ghost so the 12 True Believers in
[15:54] Ephesus were re-baptized in water in the
[15:57] name of the Lord Jesus and then received
[15:59] the Spirit by immersion the baptism of
[16:01] the Holy Ghost they were able to live
[16:04] the word of God for their day despite
[16:06] how it Advanced so recently after the
[16:09] age of John the Baptist and into the age
[16:11] of the baptism of the Holy
[16:14] Ghost asking for the true
[16:17] baptism in closing we plead with you to
[16:20] ask for the real evidence of the Holy
[16:22] Ghost Luke
[16:24] 11:10 for everyone that asketh receiveth
[16:27] and he that seeketh findeth and to him
[16:29] that knocketh it shall be opened if a
[16:31] son shall ask bread of any of you that
[16:33] is a father will he give him a stone or
[16:35] if he ask a fish will he for a fish give
[16:38] him a serpent or if he shall ask an egg
[16:42] will he offer him a scorpion if ye then
[16:45] being evil know how to give good gifts
[16:48] unto your children how much more shall
[16:50] your heavenly father give the Holy
[16:52] Spirit to them that ask him remember
[16:55] Jesus taught very few would find the
[16:58] narrow road according to Matthew
[17:00] 7:14 very few people will actually
[17:03] receive the baptism of the Holy
[17:05] Ghost in order to receive the true
[17:07] baptism of the Holy Ghost the Bible
[17:09] teaches in Acts
[17:11] 5:32 that you must obey the word of
[17:16] God to obey the word of God you must
[17:19] live against the trends of society you
[17:21] must hate sin you must hate worldly
[17:23] entertainment and you must love the
[17:25] righteousness of Jesus
[17:27] Christ our prayer is that you receive
[17:30] the word of God for your day through the
[17:32] messenger that God has sent to us in
[17:34] this
[17:36] hour may God strengthen you to obey all
[17:39] the words of God and receive the true
[17:41] baptism of the Holy Ghost if you receive
[17:44] this baptism your life will be in the
[17:47] word all the way if you have any
[17:50] questions about the true evidence for
[17:51] the baptism of the Holy Ghost please
[17:53] contact us God bless you and may Jesus
[17:56] Christ be the desire of your heart
