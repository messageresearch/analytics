[23:09] also he gave testimony and said i have
[23:12] found david the son of jesse a man after
[23:16] mine own heart which shall fulfill all
[23:19] my will
[23:20] we always talk about wanting to be a man
[23:22] or a woman after the heart of god what
[23:24] does that do it obeys all the will of
[23:26] god
[23:28] we'll have a little stumblings here and
[23:29] there you know we'll make we'll make
[23:31] we'll have shortcomings and we'll slip
[23:33] and fall and but a righteous man rises
[23:35] seven times righteous woman rises seven
[23:38] times
[23:39] verse 36 let's read that
[23:41] uh on three one two three for david
[23:44] after he had served his own generation
[23:47] by the will of god fell on sleep and was
[23:50] laid unto his fathers and saw corruption
[23:53] let's have one more word of prayer if
[23:54] you have a need on your heart let's make
[23:56] it known unto god heavenly father we

[24:18] love you thank you for the great start
[24:20] to the school year for nature lord and
[24:22] let it be that way for all the children
[24:24] lord god we pray
[24:25] let your angels surround them lord i
[24:27] pray and father we'll give you all the
[24:29] glory all the days of our life in jesus
[24:31] christ's name the saint said amen god
[24:34] bless you being seated praise god
[24:41] just so you know um
[24:44] our church youtube channel got a strike
[24:46] against it because two three years ago i
[24:48] showed a video like a minute video
[24:51] and then the author of that video turned
[24:53] me in for doing it and
[24:54] and i forgot to delete it
[24:56] and have a strike against me so we can't
[24:58] do live stream on our church youtube
[25:00] channel
[25:01] so we're doing live stream through my
[25:02] personal youtube channel
[25:04] so if you ever like look for the link
[25:06] and it's not on there it's because
[25:08] we have a strike against us and i don't
[25:09] know i don't know how long i've emailed
[25:11] youtube i haven't heard back from them
[25:13] that's my mistake i will never show a
[25:14] video
[25:15] live from somebody else
[25:18] live on youtube
[25:20] so i had to learn the hard way but it
[25:22] doesn't matter i guess as long as as
[25:24] long as god is uh
[25:25] helping people you know really doesn't
[25:27] matter i guess
[25:29] so um i tried i emailed the gentleman to
[25:31] apologize he never emailed me back
[25:33] i mean i've done all i can do
[25:35] um
[25:36] so by god's grace let's uh just quickly
[25:39] review the will of god we started with
[25:41] what is god's will
[25:42] it's the desire of god god's will is his
[25:44] desire his choice his pleasure and it's
[25:47] a holy calling
[25:49] so whatever god's desire is for our
[25:51] lives holiness is at the heart of it
[25:54] we can't do god's will without
[25:56] uh living a holy life
[25:59] and then uh god initiates and reveals
[26:01] his will to every person
[26:03] remember that scripture came to my mind
[26:05] this week the bible said the eyes of the
[26:06] lord go to and fro upon the whole course
[26:09] of the earth
[26:12] that that didn't say half of the earth
[26:14] it said all the earth
[26:16] so god goes to every nation right his
[26:18] eyes go to every nation
[26:20] and that's why the bible said men are
[26:21] without excuse
[26:22] god is searching all over the world can
[26:24] i find a true worshiper is there anybody
[26:26] that wants to know me praise god
[26:28] he's made himself known in their bodies
[26:30] and in nature and then his holy spirit
[26:33] is constantly searching i'm glad he came
[26:35] looking for me praise god i'm glad he
[26:37] found me it took i was a stubborn fellow
[26:40] now i was raised in a church that knew
[26:41] the power of god but he was patient to
[26:43] wait 19 years for me praise god so i'll
[26:46] gladly praise him the rest of my days
[26:48] amen and i have now i've uh let's see i
[26:51] got saved in 19. so now i've given him
[26:53] more time because i'm almost 40. i've
[26:55] given him more years
[26:57] uh than i was in sin by god's grace so i
[27:00] i think that's a privilege praise god to
[27:02] serve god all the days of my life like
[27:03] brother man said i only have one regret
[27:05] i didn't do it sooner praise god
[27:08] and then we saw how god's will is
[27:09] sovereign uh it's immutable he doesn't
[27:12] ask for our desire he doesn't ask for
[27:13] our opinion he does what he wants
[27:16] and then he makes his will known to man
[27:18] through the word and then and then
[27:21] there's a future will that we must seek
[27:23] out called the progressive will of god
[27:25] we call it the progressive
[27:27] and then if we obey it it's called the
[27:29] perfect will of god if we disobey it
[27:31] it's called the permissive will of god
[27:33] praise god
[27:35] uh so let's pick up now we left off with
[27:38] there's two principles that guide god's
[27:40] future will
[27:42] uh the first one it will always be in
[27:44] the word amen if god is gonna ask us
[27:46] through anything it has to already be
[27:49] permission in the word of god
[27:51] okay we saw david bring in the ark we
[27:53] saw daniel found it in in jeremiah's
[27:55] writing he found the will of god to
[27:57] bring israel back after 70 years
[27:59] uh hananiah said two years but uh
[28:02] jeremiah stayed true to the word of god
[28:05] uh and then we we ended last time with
[28:07] you never trust a sign or wonder
[28:10] uh if the voice is wrong behind it
[28:14] okay
[28:15] um
[28:16] like for example last sunday night we
[28:18] preached on just 2020 the rapture right
[28:20] so if this if this man's dreams are
[28:22] right let's say they're right
[28:24] but his message is to load up on
[28:26] ammunition and food if
[28:28] that's the message and sit in your house
[28:29] and wait for somebody to come attack you
[28:32] that's the wrong voice
[28:33] that's not the voice for us praise god
[28:35] right yeah it might be the voice for
[28:37] somebody
[28:39] and amen and i were saying nothing's
[28:41] happened in september yet right now
[28:42] that's only been one week
[28:45] but we'll keep watching that by god's
[28:46] grace he said there was a tap three
[28:48] times on september we'll see
[28:50] and then he said uh november was smash
[28:53] but that's a that's a real application
[28:55] to our day
[28:56] even if something comes to pass
[28:59] the voice behind it has to be a
[29:00] scriptural voice
[29:02] has to lead us to the scripture of the
[29:04] hour praise god
[29:06] so we end it with that
[29:08] and then even if dreams whatever don't
[29:10] trust any dream preacher if it disagrees
[29:13] with god's word it has to believe i'm
[29:15] sorry it has to uh line up with god's
[29:17] word
[29:18] now let's go this is all new let's go to
[29:20] the second
[29:21] uh aspect it has to be god's will in his
[29:24] word and then it has to be in his time
[29:26] and season praise god
[29:28] uh often we try to enforce god's will
[29:31] too early right we try to do something
[29:34] before it's time
[29:36] uh and you know god is of course
[29:38] gracious if we repent king saul couldn't
[29:40] wait seven days in first samuel one he
[29:43] couldn't wait
[29:44] seven days
[29:46] uh to sacrifice so he forced himself
[29:49] into the past in the the prophet's
[29:52] office a church let's not be uh let's
[29:55] not be too harsh on saul because
[29:58] i think we all know this a lot of people
[29:59] try to push themselves into a prophet's
[30:01] office when they try to predict the
[30:02] rapture
[30:04] right right
[30:06] let's not be so harsh on saul
[30:08] saul went he forced himself into the
[30:11] prophet's office well in 2011 a man
[30:14] named harold camping
[30:15] you remember it he rented billboards all
[30:17] across i remember driving to lima and
[30:19] driving home in 2011 and there were
[30:21] billboards
[30:22] billboards saying the rapture is going
[30:24] to occur may 21st 2011.
[30:27] my pa my uh principal who was a
[30:29] homosexual at the time i'll never forget
[30:30] it the saturday before is may 20th i
[30:33] walked into the office he's staring at
[30:35] the screen with his mouth open like this
[30:37] and he said the world is supposed to end
[30:39] tomorrow
[30:40] and i was just studying that i looked at
[30:41] him i said no sir
[30:43] i said that man already predicted the
[30:45] rapture
[30:46] uh years ago he missed it i said he's
[30:48] wrong it's not going to happen
[30:50] i said that's according to deuteronomy
[30:52] 18. i said that's when i wasn't that
[30:54] bold you know i was kind of like real
[30:55] nice and
[30:57] i'm rarely ever that bold like yesterday
[30:59] i got the witness to this guy at home
[31:00] depot that jesus calling shirt you ever
[31:02] seen that it has a green
[31:04] uh button and a red button you can
[31:06] either accept jesus call
[31:08] he i said can you help me find this
[31:10] certain certain tool
[31:12] he's like i like your shirt i'm like oh
[31:14] you love jesus
[31:16] and he said uh he said no i just think
[31:18] it's a funny shirt and yesterday i've
[31:20] been trying to carry my books everywhere
[31:22] i go out in public in case i can give
[31:23] them out and i said hey i said i'm a
[31:26] christian i wrote a book about jesus do
[31:27] you want this book about jesus
[31:29] and he said no my heart was breaking you
[31:31] know i was like oh he's like i'm too
[31:33] busy i'm like okay okay okay and then
[31:36] you know another guy walked up to him to
[31:37] help him but as i walked away i thought
[31:39] wow
[31:40] jesus on my shirt said jesus is calling
[31:42] and that's exactly what jesus was doing
[31:44] to him
[31:45] and he turned it down
[31:47] yeah but i tried
[31:49] but i walked in there by the bang on my
[31:50] way and i said jesus please i just want
[31:51] to give out one book you know
[31:53] but he turned it down now i can't force
[31:55] him to do it i can't but all i can do is
[31:57] ask i'm glad i got a chance to ask
[31:59] praise god
[32:01] and so people force themselves into the
[32:04] prophet's office all the time
[32:07] remember do you remember that harold
[32:08] camping when he missed in may he turned
[32:10] he changed it to october do you remember
[32:12] that
[32:13] and then i knew for sure it ain't coming
[32:14] in october
[32:16] he died a year later
[32:18] he got diseased and died
[32:21] yeah
[32:22] he tried it miserably fared he he tried
[32:25] time and time again and then remember
[32:26] 2012 everybody said the mayan calendar
[32:30] down in south america runs out december
[32:33] 31st 2012 they counted the steps i guess
[32:35] their steps each step was a year and it
[32:38] was 2012 years and then it ran out well
[32:42] that day came and went
[32:44] here we are
[32:46] right and then 2015. i showed you that
[32:48] last week i was nervous for a while
[32:51] there was four blood moons that year
[32:53] pope came that year the president of
[32:56] china came that year
[32:58] there's a lot of things that happened
[32:59] but that came and went as well
[33:01] church a lot of people because it's the
[33:03] time and season of the rapture a lot of
[33:05] people feel like they need to predict
[33:07] because the timing is here but we've got
[33:10] to wait upon the holy spirit and paul
[33:12] said you'll know the times and seasons
[33:14] of the rapture
[33:15] we will know god will make it known to
[33:17] us praise god
[33:19] how many believe that amen i'll be with
[33:21] all my heart see you've got to know
[33:22] god's time in season david
[33:25] simon said a couple weeks ago david fell
[33:27] into
[33:28] adultery because he was out of season he
[33:30] should have been out to war against the
[33:32] kings
[33:33] see when we get when we're not ready for
[33:35] god's time season we either neglect it
[33:38] either we force it too early or we
[33:40] neglect it
[33:41] and we get in the permissive will of god
[33:44] it's a great sin to miss god's time and
[33:46] season that's why we've got to
[33:47] constantly live in his presence amen
[33:50] because luke 12 56 says you hypocrites
[33:53] now look at this jesus said you can
[33:55] discern the face of the skies of the
[33:57] earth but how is it that you not discern
[33:59] this time
[34:01] see even anyone that goes to church
[34:03] anyone that is spiritual that reads the
[34:05] bible knows this is the end time praise
[34:08] god did you see that this week church
[34:10] the fires in california have increased
[34:12] and they're worse than ever did you see
[34:13] that
[34:15] the fires are burning california more
[34:17] than ever look what they're at the same
[34:19] time they're burning the power went off
[34:20] two weeks ago remember that
[34:22] they lost power because they're trying
[34:23] to go
[34:24] uh green energy it's gonna fail they you
[34:27] can't do that there's not enough there's
[34:29] not enough light for that
[34:31] and at the same time they're the state
[34:33] that's shutting the church doors
[34:35] and taking churches
[34:38] to prison i'm sorry trying to take
[34:39] pastors to prison uh right now one
[34:41] church is being fined fifty thousand
[34:43] dollars every week
[34:45] and they're paying it people are just
[34:46] sending the money in there until they
[34:48] get the victory
[34:50] and you know too a couple years ago
[34:51] remember this they started putting the
[34:53] transgender curriculum into the schools
[34:54] out there they teach them from
[34:56] kindergarten up that they can change boy
[34:59] or girl and they marry whatever they put
[35:02] it in there now look at that god's
[35:04] judgment upon that place brother graham
[35:06] said in 64 he said judgment is striking
[35:08] the west coast
[35:11] that's a sad thing but if anybody should
[35:13] recognize
[35:14] the day or the coming of of the end
[35:17] times it should be us and we're glad we
[35:19] do praise god
[35:22] so see we must not force the season
[35:25] but then we can't miss the season as
[35:26] well
[35:28] so thank god that the bible says our our
[35:31] eyes are open and we are the children of
[35:33] the day
[35:34] we can't miss it because it's not dark
[35:36] to us it's light praise god we can see
[35:38] everything clearly praise god
[35:42] now that's the second part so it'll
[35:43] always be in the word but it must be at
[35:45] the right season
[35:47] okay now let's go into this next thought
[35:50] as i was studying the scripture
[35:51] i found so many verses that said when
[35:54] you do the will of god you're gonna have
[35:56] three things you have to do you have to
[35:57] serve
[35:59] which means you're not serving yourself
[36:01] you're helping other people
[36:02] so when you're in the perfect will of
[36:04] god you're serving
[36:06] you're submissive
[36:08] and you're suffering
[36:09] three s's
[36:11] okay
[36:13] now eventually we'll get to these
[36:14] questions who should i marry what job
[36:16] should i have where do i live what gifts
[36:18] do i have i have a section in the book
[36:19] of all those and i'll get to those lord
[36:21] willing next week but let's start with
[36:23] this
[36:26] we must do everything in god's season
[36:28] praise god
[36:30] now david is an example of service so
[36:33] these are some of the most beautiful
[36:34] like our scriptures we read today david
[36:37] served his own generation by the will of
[36:40] god amen
[36:42] the church when you find god's will you
[36:44] won't be serving yourself you'll be
[36:46] serving other people
[36:48] praise god
[36:49] god chose him to be king because of his
[36:51] heart now look at this you got to
[36:53] remember god chose you to do a hard
[36:55] thing when you do god's will it's hard
[36:57] but your heart's in it praise god amen
[37:00] it ain't easy for your body it ain't
[37:02] easy for your flesh all the time but one
[37:04] thing you always know your heart said it
[37:06] praise god amen that's why brother man
[37:08] said you never have to ask somebody uh
[37:11] to somebody else to do god's will it'll
[37:13] already be in you
[37:14] god already placed it in you praise god
[37:17] amen
[37:18] remember that acts 13 22 david a man
[37:21] after my own heart which shall fulfill
[37:23] all my will praise god
[37:26] so see he was he served his own
[37:27] generation
[37:29] and he did it by the will of god now
[37:31] remember this
[37:32] saul said that i'm sorry samuel said
[37:34] that david
[37:38] would feed israel
[37:40] remember that he said i took you from
[37:42] the sheep coast i'm sorry it's nathan
[37:43] nathan said god took you from the sheep
[37:45] coat
[37:46] and he set you to be king over israel to
[37:49] feed
[37:50] my people israel anybody catch that
[37:53] if you're feeding other people you're
[37:55] serving other people
[37:57] the parents should have said amen on
[37:59] that one amen
[38:01] amen i'll say it too
[38:03] see david part of being king was feeding
[38:06] everybody making sure all the tribes had
[38:08] food making sure everybody had jobs and
[38:10] positions that was part of serving other
[38:13] people so when you put food on the table
[38:16] you're doing god's will praise god right
[38:18] because a man that won't do it he's
[38:20] worse than an infidel
[38:22] so see david was called instead of
[38:24] shepherding sheep now he had to shepherd
[38:26] the the human sheep praise god
[38:29] so god's will was to feed protect and
[38:33] judge israel for 40 years all parents
[38:35] don't we know how much we got to judge
[38:37] all the time
[38:38] my girls are constantly asking me daddy
[38:40] is this right who's right here's a
[38:41] bickering here here's an argument here
[38:43] who's right i'm like
[38:44] okay help me to say it again yeah
[38:47] who's he'll help me now explain it again
[38:49] who's
[38:50] then other times i'm like just don't
[38:51] give me any details just let me ask you
[38:53] i can't i can't handle the whole story
[38:56] see we're called to feed protect and
[38:58] judge just like david did
[39:01] so see we're we're like kings on a small
[39:03] scale right in a spiritual way we're
[39:06] kings and priests unto god david natural
[39:09] and spiritual but we are certainly
[39:11] natural kings over our homes right but
[39:14] then spiritual kings over our family and
[39:16] we've got to feed protect and judge
[39:22] david served
[39:24] his generation by the will of god
[39:26] bathsheba even she found a place to
[39:29] serve she produced four sons
[39:32] solomon of course became the richest and
[39:34] wisest king of the time period my
[39:38] but without bathsheba solomon may not
[39:41] have been king because she had to use
[39:43] her influence and efforts to stop
[39:46] adenija from stealing the throne from
[39:48] solomon praise god
[39:51] so see how god used a woman there god
[39:53] used a woman she could have said
[39:55] well i made awful mistakes
[39:58] who am i to interfere with this right
[40:00] she could have she could have came up
[40:02] with any excuse well i did this and i
[40:04] was really i should not have bathed
[40:05] right there
[40:06] she could have come up with any excuse
[40:08] but she realized those things were in
[40:10] the past amen she forgot the past and
[40:13] she was pressing on toward the mark of
[40:15] the high calling in christ amen amen
[40:18] glory
[40:19] she knew they lost their child god had
[40:21] judged them right god had given that
[40:22] temporary punishment the consequence but
[40:25] now she knew that was in the past
[40:27] and she knew what god had said see she
[40:29] was standing for god's word she was
[40:32] going to do everything she could to make
[40:33] sure the son of david took the throne of
[40:35] god amen
[40:37] hallelujah and so she used her influence
[40:39] church
[40:40] and she did that and because of that
[40:42] they enjoyed many years of peace i don't
[40:44] know how many because remember after a
[40:45] while solomon baxter then god sent two
[40:48] kings against solomon because of his
[40:50] worship of idols so i don't know how
[40:53] many years it was some say 20 some say
[40:55] 30.
[40:56] but see because of her service because
[40:59] she kept she knew what david said by the
[41:01] word of the lord even though david was
[41:03] dying
[41:04] she she did everything in her power to
[41:06] bring god's will to pass to make sure
[41:09] solomon sat on the throne amen
[41:12] church david served also he served the
[41:14] people through music did you know he set
[41:16] up
[41:17] he established levitical worship using
[41:19] the instruments did you know he set that
[41:21] up he was the one that came up with that
[41:23] that was in uh first chronicles 15 and
[41:26] 16.
[41:27] dave is the one that came up with that
[41:28] that idea
[41:29] he's the one that taught him to play
[41:31] skillfully continually
[41:33] and ordain all those instruments you see
[41:36] today david's the one that set that up
[41:39] so god used him look look at all that
[41:40] david did he was truly a type of christ
[41:42] right
[41:43] he fed protected judge he set up the
[41:46] worship in the church
[41:49] and then he expanded their borders
[41:51] remember this we preached
[41:52] years ago
[41:53] in first kings 11 he expanded their
[41:55] borders to where joshua was promised to
[41:58] have him but he never reached him
[42:00] because israel was disobedient
[42:03] so not only did he serve in music he
[42:05] served through the military as well
[42:08] he helped all he helped the generation
[42:11] possess what was rightfully theirs
[42:13] praise god amen he restored
[42:16] the borders praise god he restored all
[42:19] god's promised word to god's people he
[42:22] restored it what a servant praise god
[42:24] amen
[42:25] you would say amen if you know you got
[42:27] your land back that you never had before
[42:29] wouldn't you yeah if somebody if
[42:31] somebody fought a victory for you and
[42:33] said well now here's 20 acres would you
[42:35] be sad about that or would you be happy
[42:37] i think you'd be pretty happy i have i
[42:39] have three quarters of one acre i'm
[42:40] pretty happy with that
[42:42] i wouldn't want to mow the other 9 or 10
[42:43] or whatever but
[42:47] he won the victory and because of that
[42:49] god's people possessed what was
[42:51] rightfully theirs
[42:53] he helped them enjoy
[42:55] god's blessings for them without him it
[42:57] would not happen praise god
[42:59] so he served the generation
[43:02] through expanding uh the borders of
[43:05] israel
[43:06] and helping them to achieve all their
[43:08] god-given potential ah oh hallelujah
[43:12] thank god that's what this message has
[43:13] done praise god
[43:15] right it's made you for you sisters it's
[43:17] made you a real woman praise god
[43:19] right it's made you reach your godly
[43:21] potential not some striptease out there
[43:23] right but a real saint of god amen
[43:26] you brothers it took you uh it made you
[43:28] a real man of god somebody who's got a
[43:30] backbone that can stand on the word

[43:36] not a laughing stop not a drunk laying
[43:38] uh on the couch while your wife does all
[43:40] the work but you're there to help if you
[43:41] need to i know vane does right i know
[43:43] you know
[43:44] he does a good job of that he's a real
[43:45] good man praise god see you got a good
[43:47] man right there
[43:49] real man i'm just i love him i just
[43:51] teased him
[43:52] my wife got a good man too brother
[43:54] i help out all the time
[43:58] but see god made us real men we're not
[44:00] pushovers praise god and we might take a
[44:03] little bit abuse you know we might take
[44:04] some teasing but
[44:06] we're not going to go back into the
[44:07] world
[44:08] we're going to stand on god's word
[44:10] hallelujah amen
[44:12] you see
[44:14] these were victories were possible how
[44:16] did david serve god because every time
[44:18] he had a battle he prayed first
[44:21] amen church before every decision pray
[44:24] first amen amen pray first ask god to go
[44:27] before you
[44:28] praise god
[44:31] he was undefeated every time
[44:34] he prayed and inquired of the lord oh i
[44:36] love it
[44:37] that's what we see as well that's why i
[44:39] believe you know that that quote from
[44:40] the church age book shall be a should be
[44:42] an invincible army i believe that's
[44:43] future but i also believe it's present
[44:45] tense
[44:46] who can defeat us when we're under the
[44:48] blood of jesus christ
[44:50] who's ever defeated you
[44:53] nobody can defeat you you might you lose
[44:55] a few battles but you're not going to
[44:57] lose the war
[44:59] you're not retreating and let's go back
[45:00] to evil this is too hard no i then went
[45:03] through them i went through the
[45:04] wilderness praise god i've set up my
[45:06] house and i've established my family and
[45:08] i'm living on the the wine and the oil
[45:10] praise god
[45:12] i'm eating honey and i'm drinking milk
[45:14] and honey
[45:15] i'm eating making spiritual milk and
[45:17] honey praise god amen
[45:19] i act the same way at work praise god
[45:21] i don't yell but i act with the same joy
[45:23] everybody knows i had the joy of the
[45:25] lord
[45:27] i told you all those teachers come in
[45:29] they say we like being in your room
[45:30] there's a special atmosphere in your
[45:32] room
[45:33] well not right now because the kids are
[45:35] at home but you don't understand
[45:37] see we're possessing god's promises and
[45:40] fulfilling god's will for our lives it's
[45:42] a beautiful thing
[45:44] feeding the next generation praise god
[45:46] protecting judging the next generation
[45:49] amen
[45:51] i see my children i'm starting to see it
[45:52] you start i start to see little fruits
[45:53] in my children
[45:55] yeah i'm gonna make them nervous i'm
[45:56] gonna make i might embarrass them a
[45:58] little bit here tonight
[46:01] i see the gifts of god in their lives
[46:03] in case you're singing like that malachi
[46:05] playing like that lydia playing like
[46:07] that
[46:08] i see like haven i mean she can sing
[46:11] really good
[46:12] harmony i mean i see i see him brother
[46:14] bang i see those little buds starting to
[46:17] sprout there
[46:18] now if they can all just get born again
[46:20] praise god
[46:21] and know it
[46:23] hallelujah
[46:24] just like you and i amen okay
[46:27] don't we want to see all them in the
[46:29] power of the spirit and walk in the will
[46:31] of god and
[46:32] led by the holy spirit praise god
[46:35] that's what we all want
[46:37] that's why we protect them and judge
[46:38] them and feed them because we're
[46:40] training them to to take their place in
[46:42] the kingdom of god amen
[46:45] and then on top of all that saints david
[46:47] wrote 70 songs at least
[46:50] there's 150 psalms he wrote at least 70
[46:53] of them
[46:54] how many songs have you and i written
[46:58] i was there when brother brooks wrote
[46:59] one song
[47:00] i was there we were driving the car and
[47:03] he's like
[47:04] he is my sword and shield my sword and
[47:07] she
[47:08] rock of ages
[47:10] lord jesus christ we've seen that a few
[47:12] years ago
[47:13] i was there when he's he came up with
[47:14] that one but that wasn't me
[47:16] 70 songs david wrote 9.
[47:19] and church many of them are sung today
[47:24] years later created me a clean heart oh
[47:27] god amen amen
[47:29] what a servant
[47:32] his whole life was when you write a song
[47:33] with amen when you sing a song you're
[47:35] serving us praise god sister who when
[47:37] you're on that computer you're serving
[47:38] us praise god
[47:40] i saw her earlier today adjusting the
[47:42] mic or just in the stand for brother
[47:43] amen right look at her serve you like
[47:45] that really man what a blessing
[47:48] what a blessing
[47:49] and all of us we gotta find our little
[47:51] ways to serve and to meet other people's
[47:54] needs right
[47:57] and david did all this
[47:59] he was a prophet and many of those songs
[48:01] prophesied of jesus crucifixion and
[48:03] resurrection a thousand years before
[48:06] they ever happened man
[48:08] what a servant
[48:09] that's the first thing so in david's
[48:11] life we see service the next s was
[48:14] submission
[48:15] when when you're in the will of god you
[48:17] can submit
[48:19] or obey commands
[48:21] now nothing sinful
[48:23] the holy spirit will never lead you to
[48:25] sin
[48:28] but the bible said first submit to god
[48:30] james 4 7 there's good old james
[48:33] james 4 7
[48:34] submit yourselves therefore to god amen
[48:38] see you'll never be able to submit to
[48:40] the church or your brother sisters until
[48:41] you submit to god first amen
[48:44] submit to god
[48:46] resist the devil and he'll flee from you
[48:50] then ephesians 5 21 submitting
[48:52] yourselves one to another in the fear of
[48:54] god
[48:56] that's why it was hard brother vang but
[48:57] when a couple of saints asked me
[48:59] uh three saints asked me to record my
[49:02] book my modesty book that was like i
[49:05] spent about 30 hours on that i dropped
[49:07] everything and i got it done in two
[49:09] weeks you know because i i kept hearing
[49:11] people ask me i'm like okay i'll submit
[49:12] to you i really didn't want to do it
[49:14] it was a lot of work
[49:16] but if somebody gets one blessing if the
[49:18] saints need it and if i can submit
[49:20] myself to them i'll do it by god's grace
[49:23] i just set aside whatever i was working
[49:25] on that's why it's taking me a little
[49:26] longer to get the book done
[49:27] i set aside about 30 hours because i
[49:29] want to submit to myself to other people
[49:31] i want to be in the habit of that
[49:36] and then you we should all submit to
[49:37] leadership
[49:39] hebrews 13 17
[49:42] obey them to have the rule over you
[49:43] submit yourselves for they watch for
[49:45] your souls as they must give an account
[49:47] that they may do it with joy not with
[49:48] grief for that is unprofitable unto you
[49:53] so i don't you know i don't really give
[49:54] many commands to the church outside of
[49:56] just obey what's being preached you know
[50:00] i mean i like we have our fall meetings
[50:02] coming up right and i would i would just
[50:04] ask everybody to fast as many of those
[50:07] as you can if you can only do one praise
[50:08] god
[50:10] that's just my humble request and then
[50:12] while you're praying while you're
[50:13] fasting spend a few extra minutes and
[50:15] pray right and say god send your holy
[50:17] spirit god send revival to the young
[50:19] people or god send me a revival you know
[50:23] pray right
[50:24] set aside the natural things for a
[50:26] little while and submit yourself
[50:28] to the leadership and then submit to god
[50:30] right fast and pray and intercede for
[50:32] other people
[50:36] and then peter says we must submit to
[50:38] the government
[50:39] that's why you know we gave the
[50:41] government 50 days
[50:43] tried to follow their rules and now we
[50:44] know it's not a pandemic right we
[50:46] thought it might be
[50:48] uh it hit certain cities in a in a
[50:50] pandemic way but not ours thank god
[50:52] but first peter 2 13 says submit
[50:54] yourselves to every ordinance of man for
[50:57] the lord's sake
[50:59] you probably saw that permit you see the
[51:01] permit out there on the cork board
[51:02] brother amen hung up
[51:03] i didn't want to pay that but i was
[51:05] forced to spend ten dollars
[51:07] i didn't want to do it
[51:08] ten dollars just to to so we have a
[51:11] permit that says
[51:12] we have a church in this building and i
[51:14] think it's ridiculous i fought it for
[51:16] months now shame on me i fought it for
[51:18] months so i'm fine like okay i'll pay
[51:20] ten dollars for that silly permit i
[51:22] didn't ask to pay that
[51:24] i didn't think we need to pay that but i
[51:26] submitted myself
[51:28] for the lord's sake
[51:30] and it wasn't maybe a good example but i
[51:32] didn't it wasn't a good example
[51:35] whether it be king as supreme or unto
[51:37] governors or as unto them that are sent
[51:40] to him for the punishment of evildoers
[51:41] and for the praise of them that do well
[51:43] for look church for so is what the will
[51:45] of god
[51:47] that with well-doing you may put the
[51:49] silence the ignorance of foolish men
[51:51] so by obeying the government we we obey
[51:54] god's will as long as it doesn't
[51:56] transgress the word of god
[51:58] and it's god's will
[52:00] right it is
[52:01] it's what god wants us to do now are we
[52:04] with the churches
[52:06] in california yes
[52:08] there's no reason they should be shut
[52:09] down you know they tell them they can't
[52:10] even sing
[52:12] can you imagine coming here and not even
[52:14] singing
[52:15] what would we do like lip sync or i
[52:17] don't know
[52:18] we just turn on a recording and just
[52:20] pretend we're singing they're not the
[52:21] government says you can't sing to god
[52:23] now i stand with them and say we must
[52:26] sing to god praise god that's the time
[52:28] to deny the government praise god
[52:30] because they can't tell you can't sing
[52:31] in jesus name
[52:34] we'll sing in the name of jesus we'll
[52:36] preach in the name of jesus we'll pray
[52:37] in the name of jesus we'll heal in the
[52:40] name of jesus amen whatever god's called
[52:42] us to do we'll do it in the name of
[52:43] jesus
[52:46] see so the holy spirit gives us wisdom
[52:48] when it goes too far right
[52:50] but if it's just something we should do
[52:52] like that permit i need to do better job
[52:54] submitting next time
[52:56] and i'm sure it'll come around next year
[52:58] and they'll probably raise it to twenty
[52:59] dollars next year and the year after
[53:00] probably thirty and they'll keep going
[53:01] up
[53:04] now the third s is suffering
[53:07] okay so we did uh
[53:10] service david submission
[53:12] god man
[53:14] church
[53:15] right other saints and now suffering now
[53:17] we looked at suffering this morning
[53:19] remember we saw that i will know him in
[53:21] the power of his resurrection and the
[53:22] fellowship of his sufferings how well do
[53:25] you want to know jesus you want to know
[53:27] him a little well or very well
[53:30] hope you say very well
[53:32] the only way to know jesus very well is
[53:35] to know him in both the power of his
[53:37] resurrection and the fellowship of his
[53:39] sufferings
[53:40] in other words we must suffer if we
[53:43] really want to know jesus but the best
[53:45] part is he'll be right there with you as
[53:47] you're suffering praise god he'll never
[53:49] leave you he'll never forsake you praise
[53:51] god
[53:52] and it's through suffering that you
[53:53] develop intimacy with christ
[53:56] so whenever god has called you to do his
[53:58] will you'll find these things
[54:01] suffering right
[54:03] submission service you'll find all these
[54:05] things
[54:07] it doesn't leave a whole lot of room for
[54:09] self that do we see self in here
[54:11] anywhere is that one of the s's
[54:14] no no self is not one of the s's
[54:17] service is actually opposite of self
[54:19] because it's
[54:20] acts for other people it's working for
[54:22] other people
[54:26] so yes church your
[54:28] lesson is obedience but your teacher is
[54:30] suffering
[54:33] your teacher is suffering
[54:35] welcome to the class of suffering
[54:39] and as i've said for me the suffering
[54:41] has been people reject me
[54:43] people leave the church for no good
[54:45] reason
[54:47] i'll preach the holy ghost truth to them
[54:49] we'll see the holy ghost fall and
[54:51] they'll accept some false doctrine and
[54:52] walk out
[54:54] what else can i do
[54:56] it's part of the suffering
[54:57] remember jesus ministry
[54:59] small small small muscle paul small
[55:01] small song
[55:03] many times it happened not all men of
[55:05] god but many times men of god
[55:07] instead of getting greater
[55:09] more popular
[55:11] they get less popular
[55:14] so i understand that
[55:16] jesus learned obedience for the things
[55:17] he suffered we read that this morning
[55:20] the bible says all that live godly in
[55:22] christ jesus shall suffer persecution
[55:26] there's no escaping it it's required for
[55:29] your future
[55:30] uh position praise god
[55:34] ii timothy says it's a faithful saying
[55:37] for if we be dead with him we shall also
[55:39] live with him if we suffer we shall also
[55:42] reign with him amen amen if we deny him
[55:45] he will also deny us so we must suffer
[55:49] and not deny his word we must suffer for
[55:52] righteousness sake and remember this is
[55:55] helping me to reign over the sinful
[55:57] nature this is helping me to reign over
[56:00] the kingdom of darkness and help me to
[56:02] be a a laborer a ruler in the kingdom of
[56:05] light
[56:06] amen that's right church
[56:10] peter
[56:11] three times i'm sorry four times
[56:14] in his first epistle deals with
[56:16] suffering
[56:19] first peter 2 20 says god accepts you
[56:22] when you endure suffering with patience
[56:27] first peter 3 13-17 says happy are ye if
[56:31] you suffer for righteousness sake
[56:34] first peter 4 19 says commit to the
[56:37] keeping of your soul to god and constant
[56:40] well-doing when you're suffering
[56:42] according to god's will praise god
[56:46] chapter 5 verse 10 but the god of all
[56:49] grace who has called us unto his eternal
[56:51] glory by jesus christ after that you've
[56:54] suffered a while
[56:58] make you perfect establish strengthen
[57:01] and settle you praise god oh if we can
[57:03] just make it through a little while
[57:05] church praise god can you make it a
[57:07] little while longer
[57:10] just a few more weary days and then
[57:13] praise god just a little while longer
[57:16] and then you'll be established then
[57:18] you'll be settled praise god then you'll
[57:20] be perfect then you'll be strengthened
[57:21] amen
[57:22] glory you can just hang on a little
[57:25] while longer praise god amen
[57:27] thank god
[57:29] remember i was in 2014 i was about the
[57:31] place to give up pastoring and then god
[57:33] sent along these two wonderful saints
[57:35] down here
[57:36] so what am i saying we're going through
[57:37] ups and downs praise god same thing when
[57:40] god said naomi and beatrice here same
[57:42] thing what an incursion the roles
[57:44] that was all within about the same year
[57:46] two year span
[57:48] i was about my you know and now i just
[57:51] go from from
[57:53] uh the depths of despair up to rejoicing
[57:55] praise god because now we've got people
[57:57] to preach to you praise god
[57:59] amen and we see god's word changing our
[58:01] lives amen
[58:03] glory
[58:04] we see god pointing us to his word
[58:06] keeping us in the truth amen
[58:09] and we see god's blessings in our life
[58:11] praise god
[58:14] what a blessing paul says all suffering
[58:16] is just for light affliction
[58:18] for a moment it's all momentary
[58:21] he said but it works it produces a far
[58:24] more exceeding and eternal weight of
[58:27] glory
[58:30] i don't know how to explain that somehow
[58:32] there's a weight of glory up in heaven
[58:34] there's a reward that can be measured
[58:36] like the paul said there's an account in
[58:38] heaven where your account grows as you
[58:40] suffer and do it willingly and keep
[58:43] praising god and keep waiting on the
[58:45] will of god your treasure in heaven it
[58:48] increases and it grows praise god
[58:52] if you can just wait a little while
[58:55] praise god
[59:00] let's go to uh second corinthians 12
[59:02] please
[59:03] let's look at paul's buffeting angel
[59:06] from satan
[59:08] now but god allowed it
[59:10] second corinthians 10 i'm sorry
[59:12] corinthians 12 forgive me
[59:26] now paul gives the order
[59:31] for uh
[59:32] instances of god's spirit
[59:36] so how many want god's spirit to
[59:37] manifest through their life
[59:39] no doubt well the order is
[59:42] suffering
[59:44] first
[59:46] and then weakness suffering makes you
[59:48] weak right
[59:49] and then
[59:50] strength comes
[59:53] okay
[59:54] so that's the order now we have to
[59:56] remember that praise god may the holy
[59:57] spirit remind it to us praise god that's
[59:58] my prayer bring it to our remembrance
[1:00:01] that's the order
[1:00:03] we're gonna have to suffer first
[1:00:06] that brings us to weakness where we
[1:00:07] realize oh i can't have confidence in my
[1:00:09] flesh
[1:00:10] i can't trust in the church i was raised
[1:00:12] in i can't trust in my own ability to
[1:00:15] keep god's word i need the strength of
[1:00:17] the lord
[1:00:18] amen
[1:00:19] praise god
[1:00:21] if you're trusting in christ's
[1:00:22] righteousness you do not trust in your
[1:00:24] own strength you wait upon the lord
[1:00:26] until he renews your strength praise god
[1:00:29] amen and it always comes in weakness
[1:00:31] praise god
[1:00:33] when you get to the spot like lord what
[1:00:35] can i do
[1:00:37] how can i overcome this i've i've tried
[1:00:39] everything i prayed right like paul i
[1:00:42] prayed three times
[1:00:45] so suffering comes first that makes you
[1:00:47] weak
[1:00:49] where you don't trust in the confidence
[1:00:50] in your flesh and then
[1:00:53] the strength of the lord comes
[1:00:55] let's look at the chapter
[1:00:57] now you know he got revelations and
[1:00:58] visions in verse one he was uh caught up
[1:01:01] to the third heaven that's uh the
[1:01:03] seventh dimension
[1:01:05] first heaven is earthly uh second is
[1:01:08] universe and third is the heavenly realm
[1:01:13] now verse four he was caught up into
[1:01:15] paradise he couldn't even other the
[1:01:16] things he saw
[1:01:22] all right now let's go down to verse 7.
[1:01:24] unless i should be exalted above measure
[1:01:27] through the abundance of the revelations
[1:01:29] there was given to me a thorn in my
[1:01:30] flesh the messenger of satan to buffet
[1:01:33] me lest i should be exalted
[1:01:35] above measure
[1:01:36] so what happened first suffered
[1:01:40] what is god trying to produce here
[1:01:42] humility
[1:01:44] how many want more humility amen and all
[1:01:47] that means is you put christ first you
[1:01:49] humble yourself you put yourself below
[1:01:51] christ in other words you're giving
[1:01:53] christ preeminence well we all want
[1:01:54] humility but it's all all of us have a
[1:01:57] hard time suffering
[1:01:58] because we're just human we don't like
[1:02:00] to suffer
[1:02:03] verse 8 for this thing i besought the
[1:02:05] lord christ said it might depart from me
[1:02:06] and he said to me my grace is sufficient
[1:02:08] for thee for my strength is made perfect
[1:02:11] in weakness most gladly therefore will i
[1:02:14] rather glory in my infirmities that the
[1:02:16] power of christ may rest upon me
[1:02:18] therefore i take pleasure in infirmities
[1:02:20] and reproaches and necessities and
[1:02:22] persecutions into stresses for christ's
[1:02:24] sake for when i am weak then i am
[1:02:27] strong
[1:02:29] all right
[1:02:31] so if we want to be more humble
[1:02:33] if we want to do god's will if we want
[1:02:35] to see the power of god in our lives
[1:02:38] suffering first
[1:02:40] weakness
[1:02:42] then strength
[1:02:43] i can see in my life the times where
[1:02:45] i've seen god move the most is after
[1:02:46] i've suffered like when i've left my
[1:02:48] family for 13 or 10 days over in guyana
[1:02:50] which is where i've seen as far as the
[1:02:52] most
[1:02:53] visible outward manifestation of the
[1:02:54] holy spirit
[1:02:56] suffer right suffer heart aches being
[1:02:58] away weakness tired fasting you know i
[1:03:01] don't sleep good over there because of
[1:03:02] the mosquitoes
[1:03:04] and then god's strength
[1:03:06] i have to oh i have to sacrifice
[1:03:08] financially too
[1:03:09] those are the times where i've seen
[1:03:10] god's greatest strength
[1:03:13] but yet there's a strength that we need
[1:03:15] every day praise god amen there's a
[1:03:17] strength i need i've only been there
[1:03:19] four times that's not much
[1:03:21] so i needed strength here and where do
[1:03:23] we find it in the prince of god amen
[1:03:26] daily and living in god's presence amen
[1:03:34] paul was given a buffeting
[1:03:36] demon
[1:03:38] to keep him humble no did no wonder he
[1:03:40] wrote whatever it takes
[1:03:42] he said by any means lord if by any
[1:03:45] means let me be a partaker of the first
[1:03:48] resurrection and he meant it brother
[1:03:50] amen
[1:03:51] he wasn't playing around he said i live
[1:03:53] with a demon in my flesh can you imagine
[1:03:56] that church here's a man who cast out
[1:03:59] demons
[1:04:00] yet he's willing to live imagine that
[1:04:03] with a demon in his flesh in his eyes
[1:04:07] okay lord
[1:04:08] now i'm going to be strong because i'm
[1:04:10] just trusting in you
[1:04:12] can you imagine that church
[1:04:15] see because remember he said if anybody
[1:04:18] can glory in their flesh
[1:04:19] that's me
[1:04:22] because he was the most zealous in his
[1:04:23] flesh
[1:04:25] he was the hebrew of hebrews
[1:04:27] the pharisees of pharisees
[1:04:31] this is amazing church
[1:04:33] because he was so con he was so strong
[1:04:35] physically god had to give him a demon
[1:04:38] in his physical body
[1:04:41] to keep him humble
[1:04:44] a man who cast out demons couldn't move
[1:04:47] this one and what about that
[1:04:50] a man who could move demons raise people
[1:04:52] from the dead heal people from incurable
[1:04:55] diseases couldn't move the own demon in
[1:04:57] his flesh
[1:05:00] so don't tell me divine healing is is
[1:05:02] going to happen every time
[1:05:04] i believe it happens 99 of the time i've
[1:05:06] said that maybe higher than that maybe
[1:05:07] 99.9
[1:05:09] but there's going to be times god takes
[1:05:11] people home there's going to be times
[1:05:12] god allows it for a certain time in
[1:05:14] season there's going to be times god
[1:05:15] allows it to humble us
[1:05:19] so the thing to do is
[1:05:20] find that mustard seed
[1:05:23] and use as much mustard seed as you got
[1:05:25] praise god amen use all the faith you
[1:05:27] got to speak against it and then just
[1:05:30] see what god does
[1:05:31] trust god amen
[1:05:33] trust in the lord with all your heart
[1:05:34] praise god lean not upon your own
[1:05:36] understanding praise god
[1:05:38] i'm gonna do it on time good
[1:05:40] everybody love the lord today amen
[1:05:42] let's all take a deep breath ready
[1:05:44] ah thank the lord it's kind of hot in
[1:05:46] here
[1:05:50] see we don't always see we don't always
[1:05:52] see god's power through raising the dead
[1:05:54] right
[1:05:56] sometimes we'll see god's power in just
[1:05:58] giving us grace
[1:06:00] to make it through our suffering
[1:06:04] one example i think of brother mike
[1:06:05] mccloskey in that wheelchair
[1:06:07] talk about grace
[1:06:09] church he's told me he's had numerous
[1:06:11] dreams where he felt the friends of god
[1:06:13] and he saw himself walk and run around
[1:06:15] and then he'll go for prayer and the
[1:06:17] brothers have tried to raise them out of
[1:06:18] it talk about faith they've tried to
[1:06:20] raise him out of this wheelchair i did
[1:06:21] that in the trinidad there's a brother
[1:06:23] there they wanted he was all deformed he
[1:06:25] has had a scar i said well let's raise
[1:06:27] him up i tried to raise him up in jesus
[1:06:28] name nothing came to no strength came to
[1:06:30] his body after about a minute so i let
[1:06:32] him down
[1:06:33] but i was i was going to try by god's i
[1:06:35] believe god can do it
[1:06:37] just probably wasn't the time and season
[1:06:38] or maybe it wasn't the will of god all i
[1:06:40] know is i was fastened that was the same
[1:06:42] service we had a prayer line and people
[1:06:44] were falling down in the line before
[1:06:46] they even got up to for me to pray for
[1:06:47] them
[1:06:48] i was just preaching on the holy ghost
[1:06:49] just a real simple message that was a
[1:06:51] glorious surface
[1:06:53] that was really that was the night after
[1:06:55] i saw the dove
[1:06:56] i still got the video i can show it to
[1:06:58] you
[1:06:59] i i went there and preached on a friday
[1:07:00] night and some of the guys were laughing
[1:07:02] at me
[1:07:03] a dog came in when i got home
[1:07:05] and i knew right there i got to preach
[1:07:07] on the holy ghost because the holy ghost
[1:07:08] is the deaf
[1:07:10] and the brothers after i left that
[1:07:11] sunday they said man
[1:07:13] they said we were laughing at you on
[1:07:14] friday but god moved and we've been
[1:07:16] preaching on the holy ghost for months
[1:07:18] they said waiting for the holy ghost to
[1:07:20] fall
[1:07:22] praise god aren't you glad church
[1:07:24] you might suffer a little while but keep
[1:07:26] serving god amen amen
[1:07:29] in your weakness he'll give you strength
[1:07:31] praise god amen amen
[1:07:35] see sometimes we we want to see god's
[1:07:37] power in a certain way it has to be a
[1:07:39] raise in the dead or it has to be
[1:07:40] healing this person or has to be a
[1:07:42] prophecy but what about suffering
[1:07:45] for god's will that's god's power too
[1:07:49] he said because my strength
[1:07:51] jesus strength
[1:07:53] is made perfect in our weakness
[1:07:55] amen
[1:08:00] remember god's waiting for you to
[1:08:01] fulfill the scripture in everything give
[1:08:03] thanks
[1:08:05] for this is the will of god in christ
[1:08:07] jesus even when it's a hot sunday yes
[1:08:10] and most of the church is traveling yes
[1:08:12] and there's not many people singing yes
[1:08:14] and there's not many people saying amen
[1:08:16] i'll still give god thanks amen because
[1:08:18] i've got life and breath and i've got
[1:08:20] i've got god in my heart and jesus has
[1:08:22] been good to me and he's faithful and
[1:08:24] his strength is made perfect in my
[1:08:26] weakness amen amen
[1:08:28] i've served god now for a long time i
[1:08:30] know there are seasons of life
[1:08:32] i know you just can't go go all like
[1:08:34] this all the time you got to go through
[1:08:35] valleys
[1:08:37] you got to go through seasons dark times
[1:08:39] rhodam caught him hot and cold times
[1:08:42] he said brother him and brother neville
[1:08:43] would stand there before jesus said look
[1:08:45] there he is there's the son of god look
[1:08:46] at him aren't you glad we stood through
[1:08:48] the hot and cold
[1:08:50] times oh thank you lord
[1:08:54] are you willing to serve church
[1:08:56] willing to suffer
[1:08:59] praise god what's the other one willing
[1:09:01] to uh submit
[1:09:03] submit to god's word
[1:09:05] let me close with this i've got about 15
[1:09:07] minutes so i'll close in 15 minutes lord
[1:09:08] willing
[1:09:10] now i i kind of simplified it i think
[1:09:12] there's two easy steps to finding god's
[1:09:15] will for any area of your life
[1:09:17] and it's in romans 12. so i'll read it
[1:09:20] uh okay olivia if you can get that
[1:09:21] romans 12 1-2 you're very familiar with
[1:09:23] this
[1:09:24] uh i might have preached on this
[1:09:25] sparingly over the last few
[1:09:27] um
[1:09:29] months i remember i remember when uh
[1:09:31] wendy was here and she was talking to me
[1:09:32] about it afterwards
[1:09:34] presenting your body a living sacrifice
[1:09:36] so to find the perfect will of god
[1:09:40] in any situation there's two things you
[1:09:41] must do the first thing is present your
[1:09:44] body as a sacrifice
[1:09:46] and the second thing is let your mind be
[1:09:49] transformed
[1:09:50] so it's two steps praise god
[1:09:53] we all know there's a perfect will which
[1:09:55] is obeying
[1:09:57] but the permissive will
[1:09:59] is like wandering or on a path at
[1:10:01] nighttime with no light because god's
[1:10:03] word is a lamp unto my feet
[1:10:07] and a light unto my path
[1:10:09] praise god so with god's word you know
[1:10:12] the next step you can see the next step
[1:10:14] but without so walking without god's
[1:10:16] word without the word of the lord
[1:10:17] without the perfect will of god you're
[1:10:18] just wandering
[1:10:20] you're not even sure if you're on the
[1:10:22] right path
[1:10:26] so god's word is the light his perfect
[1:10:28] will is the light for your path
[1:10:34] okay so romans 12
[1:10:38] i beseech you brethren i'm sorry
[1:10:40] therefore brethren now that's gonna beg
[1:10:42] you by the mercies of god
[1:10:45] that you present your bodies a living
[1:10:47] sacrifice now look how god deals with
[1:10:49] you in his mercy
[1:10:52] in god's mercy he's asking you he's not
[1:10:55] demanding it he's not going to force you
[1:10:56] to do it
[1:10:57] he said by the mercies of god i'm
[1:10:59] begging you by the mercies of god in
[1:11:01] other words god god's spirit is just
[1:11:04] lovingly asking you to do this
[1:11:07] he's not going to force you to do it but
[1:11:09] in his mercy he's asking
[1:11:11] please present your bodies as a
[1:11:13] sacrifice
[1:11:14] unto god
[1:11:17] present your bodies a living sacrifice
[1:11:19] holy acceptable unto god which is your
[1:11:22] reasonable service leave it right there
[1:11:24] uh if you can on that scripture see
[1:11:25] god's not gonna force you but he's gonna
[1:11:27] plead with you by his mercy
[1:11:33] and church usually what does this mean
[1:11:34] if we present our bodies it means eating
[1:11:36] less food
[1:11:40] maybe i didn't maybe i had something
[1:11:41] right here here let me try to fix that
[1:11:45] we got to eat less food
[1:11:50] and then fast at times
[1:11:55] present your body right because what
[1:11:57] usually drives your body what you eat or
[1:11:59] don't eat
[1:12:00] right
[1:12:03] jesus calls it fasting right voluntary
[1:12:06] voluntary voluntarily starving your body
[1:12:10] fasting
[1:12:11] and your altar present your body a
[1:12:13] sacrifice your altar is a cross which
[1:12:15] just means a death to self
[1:12:18] so he'll lead you away from the lusts of
[1:12:20] the flesh
[1:12:24] and then also you keep your body out of
[1:12:26] harm's way so you don't put too much in
[1:12:28] or you starve it right or you put the
[1:12:30] right foods in like daniel remember
[1:12:32] daniel on the 21 day fast of just eating
[1:12:33] vegetables
[1:12:35] rick warren's church called it the
[1:12:36] daniel fast
[1:12:38] which is pretty it's pretty smart you
[1:12:39] know it's pretty smart
[1:12:42] um
[1:12:45] so you
[1:12:46] starve your body or eat less or eat
[1:12:48] healthy real healthy and then you avoid
[1:12:51] all appearance of evil so you don't walk
[1:12:53] in lasciviousness
[1:12:55] uh it's uh first pete i'm sorry first
[1:12:57] peter 4 3
[1:12:59] you don't walk in the cheviots this
[1:13:01] lawlessness lusts
[1:13:02] excessive wine reveling banquetings and
[1:13:05] abominable idolatries now there's one
[1:13:08] couple i hate to say this but i'm going
[1:13:09] to share it anyway
[1:13:11] there's one couple that i thought was a
[1:13:12] real couple that had the holy ghost they
[1:13:14] don't go to this church it's another
[1:13:15] church
[1:13:17] but you know their trouble started when
[1:13:18] i told you about this when the brother
[1:13:20] let uh pornography into his marriage he
[1:13:22] encouraged his wife to watch it
[1:13:24] it didn't take root though until they
[1:13:25] went to a wedding reception
[1:13:28] and his wife was in the reading wedding
[1:13:29] reception and she went out on the dance
[1:13:31] floor and started dancing to that
[1:13:33] worldly music
[1:13:35] and it was like you know beyonce or
[1:13:39] britney spears or miley cyrus who knows
[1:13:41] i'm one shakira i don't even know
[1:13:44] i'm not up with their names anymore but
[1:13:46] i saw it on facebook that's how i know
[1:13:47] and then i talk to them later about it
[1:13:48] because i know about it they asked for
[1:13:50] some counseling i tried to help them but
[1:13:51] they
[1:13:52] they wouldn't accept my counseling
[1:13:55] but see they should have stayed out of
[1:13:56] the wedding reception but because all
[1:13:59] the other girls were doing it and
[1:14:00] because her husband back in the
[1:14:02] husband's fault he's the head of the
[1:14:03] home because he backs it in the home
[1:14:06] look what it opened up his wife and and
[1:14:08] the family member said that was when the
[1:14:10] mother changed now the mother's divorce
[1:14:12] and the kids live with dad and it's
[1:14:14] really awful situation awful situation
[1:14:18] but look if you presented your body
[1:14:20] living sacrifice you wouldn't go to
[1:14:21] those kind of banquets
[1:14:23] right church
[1:14:25] you wouldn't go
[1:14:27] like we've been to numerous family
[1:14:28] weddings and you know what we're always
[1:14:30] the first ones that leave at the
[1:14:31] reception
[1:14:33] because i'm going to hang around and see
[1:14:34] them get drunk and waste themselves and
[1:14:35] dance out there i'll say see you later i
[1:14:37] walk right up we'll walk right up to the
[1:14:39] couple love you god bless you see you
[1:14:41] later
[1:14:43] i'm going to hang around and
[1:14:44] partake in that trash
[1:14:46] all it is is satan's trap he's trying to
[1:14:48] get you caught in there it's his fly
[1:14:50] trap but the eagles of god fly away from
[1:14:53] there praise god amen they won't get
[1:14:55] trapped in that sticky nonsense
[1:14:58] i'm trying to tell you
[1:15:00] present our bodies we gotta physically
[1:15:02] many times keep our ourselves away from
[1:15:05] evil atmospheres
[1:15:09] bars sporting events concerts movie
[1:15:11] theaters any sinful gathering
[1:15:14] present your body as a sacrifice and
[1:15:16] stay away from it
[1:15:19] control your work hours as well because
[1:15:21] satan has put many men and slaves right
[1:15:23] to their their paycheck and their bosses
[1:15:27] but
[1:15:29] then they seek the lands right oh let me
[1:15:31] i can't go to the rapture i need to go
[1:15:32] check on my houses and my lands
[1:15:35] and my oxen
[1:15:37] awful decision
[1:15:40] now church if you're going to be a
[1:15:41] sacrifice something has to die paul said
[1:15:44] i die daily so you must daily crucify
[1:15:47] the lusts of your flesh and your own
[1:15:50] selfish will
[1:15:51] praise god how many can do that by god's
[1:15:53] grace how many are doing it amen amen
[1:15:57] how many are presenting yourselves on
[1:15:59] the altar i did it this morning i know
[1:16:00] about you but i presented my body on the
[1:16:03] altar of sacrifice this morning i could
[1:16:06] have chowed down on a real good
[1:16:07] breakfast i could have
[1:16:09] i could have chowed down on some other
[1:16:10] things and or spent my time watching
[1:16:12] other things i wanted you know news or
[1:16:14] something like that
[1:16:15] oh no i gotta present my body as a
[1:16:18] living sacrifice in the christ that's
[1:16:20] why many people don't get in the holy
[1:16:21] spirit they don't come to church ready
[1:16:23] with the anointing praise god
[1:16:25] they treat their body they stay up late
[1:16:27] saturday late friday eat all kinds of
[1:16:29] bad food you know they they don't
[1:16:31] present their body first god wants your
[1:16:33] body first so then the bible says if he
[1:16:35] can get your body he can get your mind
[1:16:37] praise god amen
[1:16:40] well that's just for preachers my
[1:16:41] brother said no it's not it's for every
[1:16:43] one of us
[1:16:45] every one of us have to separate
[1:16:46] ourselves
[1:16:48] present our bodies a living sacrifice
[1:16:51] let me close with this i got uh six
[1:16:52] minutes here
[1:16:54] thank the lord
[1:16:57] so the second part so first present your
[1:16:59] body separate your body from
[1:17:01] the wrong foods you know sleep good take
[1:17:03] care of your body
[1:17:04] stay away from bad gatherings the second
[1:17:07] thing is renew your mind that means you
[1:17:09] have to renew it every day
[1:17:11] the bible says though the outward men
[1:17:13] perish the inward man is renewed day by
[1:17:16] day
[1:17:17] amen sometimes you always got to read
[1:17:19] your bible church but some days you
[1:17:21] might just need to sing to god and that
[1:17:22] will refresh you
[1:17:24] how many times have i done it i'm tired
[1:17:26] then the day i put on no i this might
[1:17:28] sound silly to you but i wear gloves
[1:17:30] when i wash dishes i put on rubber
[1:17:31] gloves
[1:17:32] and they're purple
[1:17:34] so i look like the world's biggest fool
[1:17:35] you know
[1:17:37] even my mom or my wife's friend came
[1:17:39] over their day and said she i had my
[1:17:40] purple gloves on she's like you got
[1:17:41] purple gloves
[1:17:43] like yeah it takes a long time to wash
[1:17:45] dishes i don't want wrinkled hands and i
[1:17:47] can't i can't grab on anything because
[1:17:48] it slips out of my hands because they're
[1:17:49] all wrinkled
[1:17:53] the other ones cost more money or also
[1:17:54] i'd get like gray ones or whatever
[1:17:57] but you know the the point is the same
[1:17:59] how many times have i done that and i
[1:18:00] just put on a song i'm all tired i
[1:18:02] worked all day you know discouraged i
[1:18:04] just put on some shane and shane you
[1:18:06] know i said put on some phil wickham or
[1:18:08] i put on a sermon and pretty soon i'm
[1:18:10] you know praising the lord and praise
[1:18:12] the name of the lord our god praise his
[1:18:14] name i mean it just refreshes me praise
[1:18:16] god
[1:18:18] so that's the word in a different format
[1:18:20] right this is word just through the mind
[1:18:22] my mind but now singing is the word
[1:18:24] through your your spirit
[1:18:27] right through your spirit and your your
[1:18:29] fellowship with god worship
[1:18:33] so it's another avenue where the the
[1:18:35] bible says you can be renewed day by day
[1:18:38] through singing and also by reading the
[1:18:40] bible
[1:18:43] and this causes a spiritual
[1:18:45] transformation lydia's not there but we
[1:18:46] don't need to
[1:18:47] read it the bible said and be
[1:18:49] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[1:18:52] so remember that matt lightner was here
[1:18:54] he said you got to read the bible until
[1:18:56] you feel new remember he said that
[1:18:59] you got to sing until you feel good
[1:19:01] right
[1:19:04] see the bible says you got to transform
[1:19:06] the mind well it's not going to be
[1:19:07] transformed until you spend some time on
[1:19:09] it praise god
[1:19:10] invest some time on it he said pretty
[1:19:12] soon like matt lightner said read it
[1:19:14] until you have something to share oh i'd
[1:19:15] like to share this with brother a manner
[1:19:16] i like to share this with the saints
[1:19:19] whatever it takes for you to feel
[1:19:21] renewed if you can like i said other
[1:19:23] times i'll i'll be singing in the car
[1:19:25] and clapping that's where i'll get
[1:19:27] renewed you know
[1:19:30] the thing to do
[1:19:32] present your body
[1:19:34] and then renew your mind fill your mind
[1:19:36] with the things of god
[1:19:38] pull down right cast down anything that
[1:19:41] exalts itself the word of god forget the
[1:19:44] things in the past we saw this morning
[1:19:45] forget the things in the past leave in
[1:19:46] the past
[1:19:48] and set your affections on things above
[1:19:50] praise god
[1:19:53] the key simply
[1:19:55] is just thinking the right thoughts
[1:19:58] praise god it's that simple
[1:20:03] keep your mind holy on the word of god
[1:20:05] lydia pull up ephesians 4 22-24 i'm
[1:20:08] almost done here
[1:20:11] i haven't sweat like this for a while
[1:20:13] here
[1:20:14] i'm sure you too
[1:20:16] ephesians 4 22 that ye put off
[1:20:18] concerning the former conversation the
[1:20:20] old man see
[1:20:21] oh man which is corrupt according to the
[1:20:23] deceitful lusts
[1:20:25] see the old man is you do lustful things
[1:20:27] verse 23
[1:20:29] and be renewed in the spirit of your
[1:20:31] mind
[1:20:32] verse 24 that you put on the new man so
[1:20:35] how do you put on a new man think
[1:20:37] differently
[1:20:39] which after god is created in
[1:20:40] righteousness and true holiness
[1:20:43] so the only way to feel like a new man
[1:20:46] or a new woman is to change your
[1:20:48] thoughts
[1:20:49] okay so that can be done through worship
[1:20:51] that can be done through the word but
[1:20:53] surely the word of god is a part of that
[1:20:54] whether you're singing it or reading it
[1:21:00] paul said think upon eight things and it
[1:21:02] will keep your hearts and minds
[1:21:04] whatsoever things are true honest just
[1:21:07] pure lovely good report virtuous
[1:21:10] praiseworthy think on these things
[1:21:13] meditate all day on them and pray
[1:21:15] without ceasing praise god you'll have a
[1:21:18] new mind praise god yeah your mind will
[1:21:21] be made new praise god
[1:21:26] and did you ever notice church and all
[1:21:27] these scriptures about a new man did you
[1:21:29] notice paul never mentions the soul
[1:21:32] in these scriptures that i read did did
[1:21:34] you ever see put on the new man which is
[1:21:36] in your soul
[1:21:37] no
[1:21:38] because you're already new in your soul
[1:21:40] you've already got the baptism of the
[1:21:41] holy ghost in your soul but that's not
[1:21:43] where the greatest battle ever is the
[1:21:45] greatest battle is in your mind amen
[1:21:49] he never mentions renew your soul every
[1:21:51] day
[1:21:52] because it doesn't need renewed every
[1:21:53] day
[1:21:54] because it can't sin it's a seed life
[1:21:57] has entered there it's it's it's its own
[1:22:00] uh it's its own nature it's the nature
[1:22:02] of god
[1:22:03] and it's trying to grow and express its
[1:22:05] branches right it's trying to push its
[1:22:07] branches out into your mind so we gotta
[1:22:10] let him grow praise god
[1:22:13] he never paul never mentions the soul
[1:22:15] one time renew your soul
[1:22:18] oh my he says renew your mind
[1:22:24] so see paul is showing how to bring our
[1:22:26] two outward realms
[1:22:28] into obedience the word of god
[1:22:30] and that's how we find the perfect will
[1:22:32] of god first get that temperance right
[1:22:34] self-control control this body control
[1:22:37] this sin nature that wants to do what it
[1:22:39] wants to do and then once you present
[1:22:41] your body before god let your mind be
[1:22:43] transformed by thinking the right
[1:22:45] thoughts
[1:22:47] right meditating upon the word of god
[1:22:49] prayer is so key
[1:22:51] jesus said pray daily that jesus's
[1:22:54] kingdom come and god's will to be done
[1:22:57] on earth as it is in heaven praise god
[1:23:00] amen
[1:23:01] hallelujah so every day pray let your
[1:23:04] desire let your pleasure be done on
[1:23:06] earth as it is in heaven praise god
[1:23:10] it's part of the daily prayer that's my
[1:23:12] time that's my hour
[1:23:13] let's stand
[1:23:16] jesus said this kind of prayer will be
[1:23:18] rare he said shall i find this faith on
[1:23:21] the earth when i return someone that
[1:23:23] will actually pray to do god's will
[1:23:26] let's be that kind of prayer warrior
[1:23:28] praise god
[1:23:29] let's be that kind of prayer warrior
[1:23:31] somebody that jesus can find say oh
[1:23:33] they're praying for my will to be done
[1:23:36] not the will of the republican party not
[1:23:38] the will of the democratic party
[1:23:40] praise god not the will of
[1:23:42] jeffersonville right as much as we
[1:23:43] respect people love people but the will
[1:23:46] of god almighty let god's will be done
[1:23:50] not even my will right let god's will be
[1:23:52] done on earth
[1:23:54] as it is in heaven
[1:24:02] let me read these last two scriptures uh
[1:24:03] colossians 4 12. can you pull that up
[1:24:05] there lydia
[1:24:09] this is what we need we need an
[1:24:10] epi-fresh burden i i was kind of joking
[1:24:13] with my wife you know maybe we named
[1:24:15] zion epiphus you know
[1:24:17] and she's like
[1:24:19] and i really wasn't serious about it but
[1:24:21] i really like this name
[1:24:22] it's just so strange you know it's a
[1:24:25] but epiphys had the anointing to pray
[1:24:28] for people to do god's will
[1:24:32] ever first who is one of you a servant
[1:24:34] of christ glory
[1:24:36] amen saluteth you always laboring
[1:24:38] fervent for you in prayers that ye may
[1:24:41] stand perfect and complete in what will
[1:24:43] of god
[1:24:45] can you imagine
[1:24:46] but they meant one man's whole job in
[1:24:48] life was to pray
[1:24:51] god help the church in akron to do god's
[1:24:53] will that was his whole burden
[1:24:55] and the bible didn't say he prayed for
[1:24:57] it once
[1:24:58] this was his work this was his labor
[1:25:01] this was his battle oh god let the
[1:25:03] saints let brother vang and his family
[1:25:05] do god's will let brother jesse and his
[1:25:07] wife and the family let them do that
[1:25:09] that was his labor
[1:25:11] that was his mission in life epiphanes
[1:25:14] oh my what a blessing to know someone's
[1:25:17] praying for you praise god
[1:25:19] let the church do god's will
[1:25:21] grant it dear god that's the effortfish
[1:25:24] prayer warrior anointing
[1:25:28] and then paul paul had this prayer
[1:25:30] warrior anointing too this is my last
[1:25:32] scripture
[1:25:33] church if you can't do anything else
[1:25:35] pray
[1:25:37] for someone to do god's will it's
[1:25:40] totally scripture you just saw it it's
[1:25:41] scriptural
[1:25:43] and the last one was colossians 1 9
[1:25:46] for this cause
[1:25:49] so see i like this see epiphyse was
[1:25:51] under paul so epiphanes where'd he learn
[1:25:52] this from paul
[1:25:55] where are you going to learn it from
[1:25:56] god's prophet
[1:25:58] the bible said follow their example
[1:26:01] at the so this should be our main desire
[1:26:04] right pray that we can all do all the
[1:26:07] will of god amen for this cause we also
[1:26:10] since the day we heard it do not cease
[1:26:12] to pray for you and to desire that ye
[1:26:15] might be filled with the knowledge of
[1:26:18] his will
[1:26:20] in all wisdom and spiritual
[1:26:23] understanding all right hey church as i
[1:26:25] wrote these months ago my mind really
[1:26:26] even was like fireworks all the time
[1:26:28] like
[1:26:29] goodness i need to pray more for god's
[1:26:30] will
[1:26:32] no wonder these are mysteries
[1:26:34] people don't pray for that they just
[1:26:36] said god they say god send me a million
[1:26:37] dollars or god you know
[1:26:39] god sent me a new house they don't even
[1:26:40] ask if it's god's will
[1:26:42] oh god send me the nearest church i can
[1:26:44] go to instead of the church that god
[1:26:45] wants you to go
[1:26:46] there's nothing wrong with having a
[1:26:47] church i'm glad naomi's goes to the
[1:26:49] church and i'm glad you guys are i'm
[1:26:50] glad to be close to church too
[1:26:52] but the point i'm making is most people
[1:26:54] denomination they just they want the
[1:26:56] easiest lifestyle they want their will
[1:26:59] instead of god's will
[1:27:00] what do you want
[1:27:02] i want god's will
[1:27:04] so let's pray for that let's have our
[1:27:05] musicians come let's pray for god's will
[1:27:09] that was epiphysis prayer that was his
[1:27:11] that was his service to god

[1:27:18] constantly i'm praying for the church at
[1:27:21] colosse
[1:27:22] that they will do the will of god in all
[1:27:24] wisdom
[1:27:26] and understanding
[1:27:28] remember jesus said
[1:27:32] he said depart from me workers of
[1:27:33] iniquity i never knew you
[1:27:35] because they did not the will of god
