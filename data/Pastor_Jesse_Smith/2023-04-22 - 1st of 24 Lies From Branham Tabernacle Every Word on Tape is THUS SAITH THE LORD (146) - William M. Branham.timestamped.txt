[0:00] [Music]
[0:05] that's
[0:07] just been able to read
[0:13] and yes
[0:17] [Music]
[0:32] greetings friends in the mattress name
[0:35] of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of
[0:38] this video is to begin a series exposing
[0:41] the over 20 Lies coming out of random
[0:46] Tabernacle located in Jeffersonville
[0:48] Indiana
[0:50] and friends please know these videos are
[0:52] made with brotherly kindness after much
[0:54] prayer fasting seeking the Lord in an
[0:59] attempt to help the leadership repent of
[1:02] their lies and idolatry at Branham
[1:05] Tabernacle and by the grace of God
[1:07] hopefully save one or more souls out of
[1:10] this man-made denominational system
[1:13] that's been set up the tape Church
[1:15] movement or the Press Play movement
[1:17] headquartered of course in
[1:19] Jeffersonville Indiana
[1:21] as my previous videos have showed I've
[1:23] been in contact with the leadership at
[1:25] Branham Tabernacle they've always been
[1:27] kind and that's why I want these videos
[1:29] to be kind but the leadership has never
[1:31] repented they've never been able to
[1:33] receive any correction and they continue
[1:35] to influence Millions with their lies
[1:38] and false doctrines that contradict
[1:41] God's prophet of this church age brother
[1:43] William Branham
[1:45] and through this series I want you to
[1:47] hear the actual audio of the Branham
[1:50] Tabernacle leadership the actual words
[1:52] that they say and also I want you to see
[1:54] the words they actually post on their
[1:56] website because they are doubling down
[1:58] on their false doctrines and lies
[2:01] and I want you to see their lies
[2:03] compared to the audio of God's Prophet
[2:06] brother Branham and then we can all
[2:08] decide who's right today's leadership at
[2:11] Brenham Tabernacle or brother Bynum
[2:13] because it's obvious and apparent to any
[2:16] honest-hearted person that today's
[2:18] leadership at Branham Tabernacle
[2:20] contradicts the man that their
[2:22] Tabernacle is named after brother
[2:24] William Branham
[2:26] and friends I want to just briefly
[2:27] reference a video I made about this
[2:28] subject it's from March 25th 2020 called
[2:31] not every word William Branham said was
[2:34] thus saith the Lord
[2:36] and again this is the first video in a
[2:38] series that will show at least 24 lies
[2:41] or false doctrines coming out of the
[2:44] Branham Tabernacle
[2:45] so let's begin with the first lie the
[2:48] first lies that Branham Tabernacle says
[2:50] every word on brother Branch tapes are
[2:52] thus saith the Lord
[2:54] that's a lie and it's idolatry to make
[2:56] every word of brother Branham thus saith
[2:58] the Lord
[3:00] let's begin by watching the video of the
[3:02] leader from random Tabernacle speaking
[3:04] this lie
[3:12] believes everything that Brook Branham
[3:14] says is thus saith the Lord
[3:21] amen amen amen I believe everything
[3:25] friends say Amen thus saith the Lord
[3:29] as my previous video showed Branham
[3:32] tabernacle's leadership misunderstands a
[3:34] quote from trying to do God a service
[3:36] without being the will of God from 1965
[3:39] where brother Brown said quote so say I
[3:41] in the name of Jesus Christ don't you
[3:43] add one thing don't take put your own
[3:45] ideas in it you just say what is said on
[3:49] those tapes you just do exactly what the
[3:51] Lord God has commanded to do don't add
[3:53] to it end quote
[3:55] the key to understanding this quote is
[3:57] that brother random said do exactly what
[3:59] the Lord God has commanded to do and
[4:02] based upon other quotes from Brother
[4:03] Branham we know not every word brother
[4:05] random uttered was from the Lord
[4:08] and friends I've made numerous videos
[4:09] about this subject
[4:11] such as my three-part series called 60
[4:13] plus proofs the tapes of William Branham
[4:16] have mistakes yet he was a true prophet
[4:19] and by God's grace friends now I have
[4:20] over 83
[4:22] proofs brother Brown's tapes have
[4:24] Mix-Ups
[4:26] and friends it's undeniable brother
[4:27] Brandon was human not every word he said
[4:29] was thus say the Lord any honest person
[4:31] could admit that
[4:33] most recently I found where brother
[4:35] Brandon said
[4:36] a woman has sperm he said quote it's
[4:39] infertile to the woman's sperm end quote
[4:42] and brother Brandon said Enoch served
[4:44] God for 500 years yet Genesis 5 23 says
[4:47] all the days of Enoch were 360 and five
[4:50] years
[4:53] by the ram said quote look at Enoch he
[4:55] walked with God for 500 years end quote
[4:58] so perhaps I'll make a video in the
[4:59] future showing numbers 70 through 83 on
[5:04] the number of honest mistakes brother
[5:05] Brandon made on the tapes
[5:08] and friends I have emailed the
[5:09] leadership at Branham Tabernacle
[5:11] numerous times asking five simple
[5:12] questions and I asked them just give me
[5:14] a yes or no answer and they cannot
[5:16] answer any of these five questions they
[5:18] will not even respond question one is
[5:21] Billy Paul the promise Joseph or not yes
[5:23] or no because brother Ram said he was
[5:25] the promise Joseph in 1951. number two
[5:29] does the third person of the Trinity
[5:30] burn in your heart yes or no because in
[5:33] 1952 brother random said the third
[5:35] person of the Trinity burned in his
[5:36] heart
[5:37] question number three does brother
[5:39] random have anything to do with the
[5:40] seven Church age messenger or not yes or
[5:42] no because in 1961 brother Brandon said
[5:45] he didn't have anything to do with him
[5:48] question number four did Arizona have
[5:50] another generation after 1965 yes or no
[5:54] because brother Adam said we can't have
[5:55] another generation due to the rise of
[5:58] mental retardation in Arizona
[6:01] and then question five did Rebecca in
[6:03] Genesis 24 marry a woman yes or no
[6:06] because brother random said Rebecca
[6:08] married her bride or woman in 1960.
[6:12] the fact that the leaders of Brenham
[6:13] Tabernacle will not answer these five
[6:16] questions
[6:17] shows they're breaking the word of God
[6:18] first Peter 3 15 commands us to always
[6:21] have an answer for questions
[6:24] brother Brando said I'm not infallible
[6:27] made statements it said this is not the
[6:29] Lord this is me speaking brother Branham
[6:32] said I make mistakes all the time
[6:34] well the ram said it's one of the most
[6:36] awfullest things to do to make him
[6:38] infallible
[6:39] so now let's play these quotes back to
[6:41] back we'll play the LIE from Brenham
[6:43] tabernacle's current leadership against
[6:46] brother Adam's truthful statements from
[6:48] his tapes
[6:49] so let's first do the quote where
[6:50] brother Ram said I'm not infallible
[6:59] [Applause]
[7:02] now let's do the quote where brother
[7:04] Branham said the tapes have Mix-Ups
[7:13] yes
[7:21] it was a great teaching there I didn't
[7:23] touch the age of it but if you happen to
[7:26] catch that on your tape remember looking
[7:27] when you see it's seven months
[7:31] let's play the quote where brother
[7:33] Branham said it's one of the most
[7:34] awfulest things to say he's perfectly
[7:37] infallible
[7:39] I believe everything Brandon says
[7:53] so friends who is right is Branham
[7:56] tabernacle's current leadership right or
[7:58] is brother Brandon Wright of course we
[8:00] know the answer brother branham's right
[8:02] and Branham tabernacle's current
[8:04] leadership is lying
[8:06] along with that video of Brenham
[8:08] tabernacle's current leadership there's
[8:09] three more blog posts where random
[8:12] tabernacle's current leadership doubles
[8:14] down and says every word on brother Rams
[8:18] tapes is thus saith the Lord or
[8:20] infallible where brother M's tapes can
[8:22] never be wrong so here's the second
[8:25] proof
[8:26] and Branham Tabernacle posted this blog
[8:29] post on April 10 2021 you can see it
[8:32] here on the screen the leadership said
[8:34] quote dear bride there's only one Sure
[8:37] Way press play and hear ye him the
[8:40] prophet said men can truly be anointed
[8:42] of God with a right Revelation from God
[8:45] and be wrong but the tapes can never be
[8:46] wrong end quote
[8:49] this is an awful lie to say that the
[8:52] tapes can never be wrong so let's again
[8:55] play the quote where brother random said
[8:57] there's Mix-Ups on the tapes and
[9:00] remember Branham tabernacle's leadership
[9:02] says tapes can never be wrong and yet
[9:04] brother Brandon says the tapes have
[9:05] Mix-Ups let's listen to the quote
[9:17] next here's a quote from Brother Branham
[9:19] where he said his wife said he's wrong
[9:22] on so many things
[9:24] and brother Branham said that's right
[9:26] so brother Branham admitted he was wrong
[9:28] on so many things yet Branham Tabernacle
[9:31] says brother Ram's tapes can never be
[9:33] wrong so who's right is Branham
[9:36] Tabernacle or brother Branham of course
[9:38] brother branham's right let's listen to
[9:40] the quote
[9:50] next here's a third Witness
[9:52] that the brand of Tabernacle worships
[9:54] the tapes of William Branham is from
[9:56] July 30th 2020
[9:59] random Tabernacles said quote dear
[10:01] written word thus we learn what is on
[10:03] the tapes are the words of God and there
[10:04] are no mistakes in the words of God end
[10:07] quote
[10:09] I'm Tabernacle saying the tapes have no
[10:11] mistakes and yet brother random said he
[10:14] made mistakes all the time and they were
[10:17] mistakes that were on the tapes such as
[10:19] saying there was 700 that did not bow
[10:22] the need to bail but the Bible said
[10:24] there were seven thousand let's listen
[10:26] to brother Ram's quote
[10:39] that God doesn't make any mistakes
[10:45] I make thousands of mistakes in each
[10:48] month and each year so
[10:51] shall see him
[10:52] [Music]
[10:56] a fourth and Final witness is from
[10:58] October 23 2022
[11:01] Branham Tabernacle wrote quote dear
[11:03] brother Joseph number one I have heard
[11:05] you say that you believe every word of
[11:07] this message is thus say the Lord from
[11:09] the depths on my heart and with every
[11:11] fiber of my being I believe that it is
[11:13] the very voice of God speaking lip to
[11:15] ear to his bride
[11:16] end quote
[11:18] so again we see the spirit of idolatry
[11:21] upon the leadership at Branham
[11:23] Tabernacle
[11:24] Branham Tabernacle leadership says they
[11:26] believe
[11:27] with every fiber of their being every
[11:30] word on the tapes is thus saith the Lord
[11:32] and yet brother Brandon said there's
[11:34] Mix-Ups on the tapes he's not infallible
[11:37] it's an awful thing to say he's
[11:39] perfectly infallible
[11:41] only God makes no mistakes and he can be
[11:44] wrong on so many things and he makes
[11:46] mistakes on tape all the time so who are
[11:50] we going to believe Brandon tabernacle's
[11:52] current leadership or brother Branham
[11:54] let's believe brother Branham
[11:56] and one more sad awful statement from
[11:59] this October 23rd blog post is that
[12:02] Branham tabernacle's leadership says
[12:04] quote
[12:05] the holy spirit is here to lead us to
[12:07] understand what is and isn't the word
[12:09] that is the same devil that spoke to Eve
[12:11] and said surely he didn't mean every
[12:13] word sound familiar end quote
[12:17] friends notice what Branham tabernacle's
[12:19] leadership is saying they're saying it
[12:22] is Satan who says we need the Holy
[12:25] Spirit to help us understand what is the
[12:28] word and what isn't the word on brother
[12:29] branham's tapes so Branham tabernacle's
[12:32] leadership is saying Satan is the one
[12:35] who says we have to rightly divide the
[12:37] tapes
[12:38] friends this is one of the most awful
[12:40] delusional statements I've ever heard
[12:42] from Branham tabernacle's leadership
[12:44] because it is the holy spirit that says
[12:46] we have to rightly divide the word of
[12:48] Truth according to the Bible
[12:50] and prove all things according to first
[12:53] Thessalonians 5 21 and second Timothy 2
[12:55] 15.
[12:56] even brother Branham himself
[12:58] said we have to be careful to discern
[13:01] The Human Side versus the prophetic side
[13:03] as he said and he cares do you care
[13:05] 1963.
[13:08] did you find
[13:15] [Music]
[13:17] you past announce there there would be
[13:20] this happening now
[13:23] see I've always asked you to be careful
[13:27] what you're listening to I think there's
[13:30] so much of it that it's just the human
[13:33] side but always if there is something
[13:36] that goes forth it will speak it it's
[13:39] thus saith the Lord even to Visions or
[13:43] anything that
[13:45] and that's reason I say that now that
[13:48] there is any uh any prophecy concerning
[13:51] and I have nothing on it from the Lord
[13:52] and be your sure now if I say anything
[13:55] from the Lord like that to tell you it's
[13:57] always I'm speaking now but when he
[14:00] speaks I say it's not me it's thus saith
[14:03] the Lord and I can't say it until he
[14:05] tells me I could be all together wrong
[14:07] am I thought about Martin Luther King I
[14:10] don't know I can't say it that's just my
[14:12] opinion anything
[14:14] and Jesus Christ himself said the holy
[14:17] spirit will guide you into all truth so
[14:20] Saint Paul the Bible and Jesus Christ
[14:23] all say we've got to rightly divide the
[14:25] word of Truth and we need the Holy Ghost
[14:28] to help us understand what is God's word
[14:31] and what isn't God's word coming out of
[14:33] the mouth of every human born in sin
[14:36] shaped in iniquity but yet redeemed and
[14:38] called by God to preach like brother
[14:40] William Branham
[14:42] so friends let's keep praying for the
[14:44] leadership of Branham Tabernacle they
[14:45] keep doubling down there's no repentance
[14:47] no humility and they will receive no
[14:50] correction they are in a very sad
[14:52] spiritual state
[14:54] and in summary as future videos will
[14:56] show Branham Tabernacles leadership is
[14:59] always doing two things first they're
[15:01] always saying what the tapes do not say
[15:03] brother Brandon never said every word on
[15:06] my tapes is thus saith the Lord brother
[15:09] Graham never said just press play and
[15:11] obey
[15:12] brother Brown never said put the Tate
[15:13] Ministry first before living preachers
[15:16] and second Bram Tabernacle is always
[15:19] breaking the word of God in these six
[15:21] ways first they're idolizing brother
[15:23] Branham by making every word thus saith
[15:25] the Lord same thing that happened in
[15:27] Acts 14 verse 11 when heathens try to
[15:30] idolize Paul and Barnabas and said the
[15:33] gods are come down to us
[15:35] second they're deleting parts of the
[15:37] fivefold ministry which breaks Ephesians
[15:39] 4 8-16
[15:41] third Branham Tabernacle leadership is
[15:44] always name-calling others which breaks
[15:46] Ephesians 4 29 and Colossians 4 verse 6.
[15:49] and of course our future videos will go
[15:51] through these topics
[15:53] fourth Branham Tabernacle is saying that
[15:55] preachers are anointed with the spirit
[15:58] of Satan for rightly dividing the word
[16:00] and proving all things
[16:03] which breaks first Thessalonians 5 21 2
[16:06] Timothy 2 15.
[16:09] fifth they're encouraging preachers to
[16:11] neglect their gifts of preaching which
[16:14] breaks First Timothy 4 14 and Matthew 25
[16:16] verse 18.
[16:18] and six they're decreasing their
[16:20] physical Church attendance which breaks
[16:22] Hebrews 10 verses 24 and 25.
[16:28] in closing let's have a word of prayer
[16:30] for the leadership at Branham Tabernacle
[16:33] dear heavenly father with all kindness
[16:34] and love in my heart I pray for the
[16:37] leadership of Branham Tabernacle that
[16:38] they'll repent of these lies
[16:40] this is just the first lie Lord there's
[16:42] at least 23 more so I pray you be
[16:44] merciful
[16:45] may they come to themselves may they
[16:48] overcome these complexes that they have
[16:51] may they admit their wrongs and their
[16:52] sins dear God and their false doctrines
[16:54] and may they finally receive the spirit
[16:56] of truth that will guide them into all
[16:58] truth I pray this humbly I pray this by
[17:02] your Holy Spirit In Jesus Christ's name
[17:04] amen
[17:06] Lord willing we'll continue this series
[17:07] soon if you have any questions concerns
[17:10] or testimonies about this video please
[17:12] contact me
[17:14] God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[17:16] the desire of your heart
