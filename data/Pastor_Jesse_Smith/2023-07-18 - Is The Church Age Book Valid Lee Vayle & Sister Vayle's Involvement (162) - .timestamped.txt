[0:02] greetings friends in the mattress name
[0:04] of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of
[0:08] this video is to answer the question is
[0:10] the church age book valid
[0:13] should followers of William branham's
[0:15] bible-based message read preach from and
[0:20] Trust the exposition of the seven Church
[0:22] ages published in December 1965. my
[0:27] answer to this question is yes followers
[0:29] of William branham's bible-based message
[0:31] should use appreciate and glean Bible
[0:36] revelations from the Holy Spirit through
[0:38] reading the church age book this video
[0:41] contains three reasons why I believe the
[0:43] church age book is valid and I'll also
[0:46] cover Lee Vale and sister veil's
[0:49] involvement with the church age book
[0:51] according to brother Ram's own words
[0:54] so we'll begin with the three reasons I
[0:56] believe the church age book is valid
[0:58] reason number one brother Branham called
[1:00] The Church age book his own book at
[1:03] least nine times and he said he wrote it
[1:06] by the leading of the Lord I'm going to
[1:08] give the quotes for these reasons in
[1:11] chronological order the first quote is
[1:13] from the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:15] December 4th 1960
[1:18] well the brand said we're going to write
[1:20] a commentary
[1:22] to send to all the world brother Brown
[1:24] said after the last election when JFK
[1:27] was elected
[1:28] he said the Holy Spirit began to reveal
[1:31] to him to warn the people and to place
[1:33] this book so notice the Holy Spirit
[1:36] revealed to him to warn the People by
[1:38] making a book about the seven Church
[1:40] ages let's listen to the quote
[1:43] behind us from the Magnetic Tape we're
[1:45] going to write a commentary on the seven
[1:48] Church ages to stand to all the world
[1:50] that we can because we are in the last
[1:53] day we are at the end time
[1:57] never dawned upon my heart so much until
[2:00] the the last election and then I seen
[2:03] where we were at and the Holy Spirit
[2:05] began to reveal to me to to warn the
[2:09] people and to place this and I cannot do
[2:11] it in a church like this sufficiently
[2:15] and then if I sit down and just wrote
[2:17] the book I feel that if I got to the
[2:19] pulpit and the inspiration of the Holy
[2:22] Spirit amongst the Christians came up on
[2:24] me to help me then I would be more
[2:27] sufficient to write the book then after
[2:29] I took it off the tape because there
[2:31] we'd get the inspiration of it
[2:34] the next quote is from the laodicean
[2:36] church age December 11 1960
[2:39] brother Ram said he felt led of the Lord
[2:41] to do two things one of them was go to
[2:45] Jeffersonville and write the church age
[2:47] book he said quote then I said I must go
[2:49] to Jeffersonville and write this book
[2:51] end quote and he said in the name of the
[2:54] Lord he did not know the inspiration of
[2:57] the seven Church ages until he sat down
[2:58] and studied it and preached it let's
[3:01] listen to the quote
[3:03] then I said I must go to Jeffersonville
[3:06] and write this book because I don't know
[3:08] how much longer I've got to be here but
[3:10] if I express this and it goes on writing
[3:12] After I'm Gone the words will live on
[3:15] yes I've got the history roll down which
[3:18] I'll go in the book and I'll come here
[3:20] to bring it before the church to find
[3:22] the inspiration of the holy spirit
[3:24] because I didn't know these things
[3:25] myself that's true that's in the name of
[3:28] the Lord that's true I did not notice
[3:32] third quote is from the Third Exodus
[3:35] June 30th 1960
[3:38] brother random said I'm trying now to
[3:40] get it proofread and make books out of
[3:42] it of the church ages
[3:45] so notice he said I'm trying to get the
[3:47] church age book proofread and make books
[3:49] of it and brother Branham again
[3:51] validates the church age book by saying
[3:53] quote then if the Lord tarries and I
[3:56] move on you'll see that the things I've
[3:58] said in the name of the Lord will be
[4:00] come to pass just as it was said
[4:02] never has failed yet and some of it has
[4:05] to happen later end quote of course this
[4:08] statement goes along with the seven
[4:09] major Visions from 1933 and also the
[4:13] thus saith the Lord's statement brother
[4:14] Brandon said about Joel 2 verses 23-26
[4:18] which says the fullness of Pentecost
[4:20] will be in the bride right before the
[4:22] time of the Rapture let's listen to the
[4:24] quote and then besides that I'm trying
[4:27] now to get it proof read and make books
[4:31] out of it uh Church ages seven books of
[4:35] the church age seven tapes and make it
[4:38] in sets we get it done just as cheap as
[4:40] we possibly can so everybody can get it
[4:43] then if the Lord tarries and move on
[4:48] you'll see that the things I've said in
[4:51] the name of the Lord will be come to
[4:53] pass just as it was said never has
[4:55] failed yet and some of it has to happen
[4:57] later
[4:58] the next quote is from Harvest Time
[5:01] December 12 1964. brother Branham said
[5:04] I'm writing a book
[5:06] and notice he calls it my commentary
[5:08] that's a literal quote now I'm writing a
[5:11] book my commentary
[5:13] now friends it's sad some preachers will
[5:16] say brother branham's Church age book or
[5:19] brother random sermons are not
[5:20] commentary and yet brother Branham says
[5:22] the opposite he says his sermons and
[5:24] writing about the church Ages was his
[5:27] commentary so there's nothing wrong with
[5:29] saying the church age book is brother
[5:30] Adam's commentary because the beautiful
[5:32] part is a lot of it we know was spoken
[5:35] with thus saith the Lord a lot of the
[5:37] symbols and meanings from Revelation
[5:39] chapters one two and three
[5:41] were given to us from Brother Branham
[5:43] with thus saith the Lord let's listen to
[5:45] the quote
[5:47] I'm Ronnie
[5:48] Roddy Kerry on the
[5:53] large oh no I have a brochure of each
[5:55] Church age
[5:57] next from why I had to be Shepherds 1964
[6:01] December 21st
[6:03] brother Ram said I am writing a book of
[6:05] it let's listen to the quote
[6:07] those seven Mysteries back through those
[6:10] seven Church ages there were seven
[6:12] hidden mysteries I'm writing a book of
[6:14] it in a great Theologian said to me now
[6:17] August said brother Branham see how
[6:19] Satan will try to jerky off a road he
[6:21] said brother random you know what I
[6:23] believe the Lord will reveal to you what
[6:25] we're to do next is to you'll be some
[6:27] great secret is here and there are these
[6:29] Seven Seals
[6:31] the next quote is from who do you say
[6:32] this is December 27 1964 brother Branham
[6:36] calls the church age book a special book
[6:39] and he said I got a special book coming
[6:41] out let's listen to the quote
[6:50] this lady will see a church age would be
[6:52] I got a special book coming out on it
[6:54] pretty soon the Lord willing see this
[6:57] lady you see it is show that it's
[6:58] already over she's already sealed in
[7:01] there and she Christ is on the outside
[7:03] the next quote was from birth pains
[7:05] January 24th 65.
[7:08] brother Ram said I've got coming a book
[7:11] the commentary of the first four
[7:13] chapters of Revelation so again he says
[7:16] I've got a book coming out and the
[7:18] second time he calls it a commentary so
[7:20] it's sad preachers say the church age
[7:22] book or brother bam sermons were not
[7:24] commentaries of course they were
[7:27] brother Ram sermons were not scripture
[7:30] they were a prophet's commentary on the
[7:32] scripture and many of those comments
[7:34] were spoken with thus saith the Lord
[7:36] which we rejoice in let's listen to the
[7:38] quote from birth pains I've got coming
[7:41] to book out on that the commentary of
[7:42] the first four chapters of Revelations
[7:44] read it as soon as we get it all prayers
[7:46] and it proves the honors shattered doubt
[7:48] what Luther's message was justification
[7:50] one uh sanctification is the next
[7:53] process in the natural birth and then
[7:55] come to Pentecostals exactly
[7:58] the next quote is from in knoweth and
[7:59] not 1965 August 15th
[8:03] brother Ram said I've got the church age
[8:05] coming forth now in the books
[8:07] so again he says it's his church age
[8:10] book let's listen to the quote of course
[8:13] I've got the church age
[8:15] for now in the
[8:19] in the ladies see on Church age that
[8:20] we're in let's just look at the
[8:22] conditions
[8:24] the next quote was from November 27
[8:26] 1965. brother bran said Gordon Lindsay
[8:29] was printing my book so here he calls it
[8:32] my book just one week before the book
[8:34] came out let's listen to the quote doing
[8:37] a great job printing he's printing my
[8:39] book now the uh
[8:41] the seven Church ages
[8:44] and the last quote is from leadership
[8:45] December 7th 1965. if I'm not mistaken
[8:49] this is the second to last sermon
[8:51] brother Branham ever preached I believe
[8:53] communion was his last sermon and
[8:55] brother random called it quote my
[8:57] writing of the church Ages end quote
[9:00] so here's the ninth time brother Branham
[9:03] called the book his writing let's listen
[9:05] to the quote
[9:07] about my writing of the church ages
[9:10] moving on to the second reason I believe
[9:12] the church age book is valid
[9:14] the reason is because nearly all of the
[9:16] content in the book is biblically
[9:18] accurate and very important and for that
[9:22] reason I made a quick reference sheet on
[9:25] the important doctrinal teachings
[9:27] brother Branham gave us in the church
[9:29] age book as some of you may know who
[9:32] follow my channel I recently put out a
[9:34] video called The Church age book two
[9:36] mistakes I found and three additions to
[9:38] brother Rams tapes it's video number 158
[9:41] and this addresses the few mistakes and
[9:43] additions to the church age book
[9:45] and yet it's a very special book as
[9:48] brother Brandon said so the church age
[9:50] book in my opinion is the same as
[9:52] brother Branham sermons brother random
[9:54] said there's Mix-Ups on the tapes
[9:55] brother Brandon said sometimes there are
[9:58] seeds in the Cherry Pie
[10:00] he says if you ever hit a seed in the
[10:02] Cherry Pie just spit out the seed but
[10:04] keep eating cherry pie that's what any
[10:06] True Believer will do they'll enjoy all
[10:08] the wonderful Bible revelations brother
[10:10] random preached and when brother Branham
[10:12] makes human mistakes or makes human
[10:14] opinions
[10:15] that are not in the Bible we just spit
[10:17] those out and we accept all the great
[10:19] cherry pie all the great Bible teachings
[10:21] brother Adam gave us the Bible way to
[10:24] describe this is not Cherry Pie and
[10:26] cherry pits or cherry seeds the Bible
[10:28] way to describes this the Bible way to
[10:31] describe this is called rightly dividing
[10:33] the word of truth that's found in second
[10:34] Timothy 2 verse 15. study to shoe
[10:37] thyself approved unto God a Workman that
[10:40] needeth not to be ashamed rightly
[10:42] dividing the word of Truth
[10:44] here's a screenshot of my church age
[10:47] book quick reference topical sheet it's
[10:51] got 13 references to 13 important
[10:54] doctrines or sections from the church
[10:56] age book the first is on the importance
[10:58] of receiving genuine Revelation from God
[11:00] begins on page 12 ends on page 17. the
[11:04] second is the true Sabbath and the
[11:06] Lord's Day
[11:07] from Pages 43 to 48 the third section is
[11:10] the godhead and water baptism in the
[11:12] name of the Lord Jesus Christ there's
[11:14] actually six sections in the book that
[11:16] talk about these two important subjects
[11:19] the next subject is Christ is the Tree
[11:21] of Life followed by the serpent seed
[11:23] teaching from Pages 97 to 107.
[11:27] the next section is torment in the Lake
[11:29] of Fire does not last eternally since
[11:31] Sinners do not possess eternal life so
[11:33] the non-eternal hell teaching is found
[11:36] on pages 131 to 139
[11:40] the true baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[11:42] the fact tongues are not the initial
[11:44] evidence of receiving the Holy Ghost
[11:46] are found in three sections in the book
[11:49] the next section is God's election of
[11:51] each True Believer and the elected
[11:53] members of the Bride of Jesus Christ
[11:54] from Pages 148 to 157
[11:57] the seven spirits of God refers to the
[12:00] holy spirit's continuous Ministry in the
[12:02] lives of seven men
[12:04] The Book of Life
[12:06] the seven major visions of 1933
[12:09] the end time Prophet sent to this
[12:11] laodicean church age
[12:14] and lastly a resume of all the church
[12:16] ages a brief overview of each age
[12:20] two quotes about the important content
[12:23] of this book are both from 1965 the
[12:26] first quotes from trying to do God of
[12:27] service without it being God's Will from
[12:30] November 27 1965 brother random said you
[12:34] all seen in my book it'll all be drawed
[12:36] out in the seven Church Ages which he
[12:38] told me which I stand by as a witness to
[12:41] God to be judged at the day of judgment
[12:44] for it it come from God not from my
[12:47] thinking end quote
[12:49] so friends this is a powerful statement
[12:51] brother I'm speaking of the drawing of
[12:53] the seven Church ages now each age had a
[12:56] certain portion of truth that brother
[12:57] Brandon Drew on the chalkboard and then
[12:59] the Holy Spirit made those light and
[13:01] shadows those same seven circles of the
[13:04] church ages and manifested those lights
[13:06] on the back wall of random Tabernacle
[13:09] and there were numerous Witnesses of
[13:11] this event and some of them made
[13:13] testimonies about it but notice again
[13:15] brother Brandon said I'll be judged by
[13:16] God for the teaching that had come from
[13:19] God that's a powerful statement to make
[13:21] and so that's one more reason we can
[13:23] trust the content in the church age book
[13:25] let's listen to the quote
[13:31] which he told me which I stand by as a
[13:34] witness to God to be judges to their
[13:36] judgment for it it come from God not
[13:39] from my thinking the second quote is
[13:41] from the Rapture December 4th 1965.
[13:45] brother Ram said the church Ages were
[13:47] drawn by the Holy Spirit and now we're
[13:50] drawn in his book
[13:52] so again this quote shows how God
[13:54] himself validated the scriptural truce
[13:57] and content in the church age book by
[13:59] coming down himself in the form of the
[14:01] pillar fire and putting the lights and
[14:03] shadows on the back wall of random
[14:05] Tabernacle and of course there's a
[14:06] recording on that as well so let's
[14:09] listen to the quote from the Rapture and
[14:10] then we'll hear the recording from the
[14:12] pillar Fire coming down in 1961. I had
[14:16] him drawn out on the board
[14:17] up there Church Ages which
[14:20] we draw it out in the book and if that
[14:22] Holy Spirit didn't come down in a big
[14:25] pillar afar and went right back on that
[14:27] wall and draw them out himself uh three
[14:29] or four hundred people sitting looking
[14:30] at it
[14:35] now look this way y'all now that's just
[14:37] like it is when it comes on the glory
[14:39] here Steve
[14:42] [Music]
[14:43] it's just it's just a reflection just a
[14:47] reflection that is it's not the right
[14:48] here's the light hanging right here I
[14:50] hear this woman
[14:52] I just had to catch it I thought it was
[14:53] over somebody
[15:01] [Music]
[15:04] now you're seeing what I'm seeing too
[15:08] one of them is the natural the other is
[15:09] the supernatural there's a man sitting
[15:12] on the outside here
[15:13] on the list nine looking over towards
[15:15] that light struck him he's from Seymour
[15:17] Indiana and he's got I had a stroke if
[15:20] you'll believe sir God will heal you
[15:22] that's broken amen
[15:25] the third reason I believe the church
[15:27] age book is valid is that brother
[15:29] Brandon put a lot of emphasis on the
[15:31] book
[15:32] and I want to share two quotes about
[15:33] that the first quote is from scriptural
[15:36] signs of the time April 10th 1964.
[15:40] brother random calls the picture of the
[15:43] seven Church ages an astounding picture
[15:46] and again testified about the moment
[15:48] when the pillar fire came down in the
[15:50] Branham Tabernacle to vindicate that
[15:52] that drawing was from god let's listen
[15:54] to the quote you have astounding picture
[15:56] there tonight's going in that book uh
[15:58] three years how the Lord be drawn out on
[16:00] a Blackboard and show just how the
[16:02] church ages of failed and when and how
[16:04] they would go up and down and as soon as
[16:05] that was finished that great Angel of
[16:07] the Lord that light before practice many
[16:09] people sit here come right on the side
[16:11] of the wall or stand there at people
[16:12] fainting and draw it right out with
[16:14] itself on the wall
[16:16] and the second quote was from the
[16:17] anointed ones at the end time July 25th
[16:20] 1965
[16:22] brother Brandon makes an astounding
[16:24] statement here he said wait till you get
[16:26] the book The Church age book you'll
[16:28] understand it if you just got any light
[16:30] in you
[16:31] and he was referring to the topic or the
[16:33] doctrine of the book of life I just
[16:36] think that's an important statement a
[16:39] tremendous statement brother Brandon
[16:40] said if you have any light of God in you
[16:42] you'll understand the Book of Life After
[16:45] reading the church age book and all
[16:47] message believers who are born again or
[16:49] have any light of God in them can say a
[16:51] wonderful Amen to that let's listen to
[16:54] the quote
[17:00] moving on to the final section let's
[17:02] look at Lee Veil and sister vale's
[17:04] involvement in the book and this also
[17:07] includes proof brother Branham reviewed
[17:09] Lee vale's work at least a couple of
[17:11] times meaning brother Branham knew the
[17:13] content that was in the book
[17:15] the first quotes from the future home
[17:17] August 2nd 1964.
[17:21] brother Brandon said brother Vale and
[17:22] those are working upon those now
[17:24] Faithfully to get them in book form
[17:25] let's listen to the quote
[17:28] the veil and those are working upon
[17:30] those now Faithfully to get them in book
[17:32] form
[17:34] the next quote is from questions and
[17:36] answers part two
[17:37] August 23 1964 this is one of two quotes
[17:41] where brother Brandon mentioned sister
[17:42] Vale involved in the church age book
[17:45] he just says oh God help brother Vale
[17:48] and sister Veil let's listen to the
[17:50] quote
[17:51] you're riding putting every word that I
[17:53] say down try
[17:56] oh God help brother Vale and sister
[17:59] avail
[18:00] here's the second quote about sister
[18:02] Vale it's from a shame 1965 July 11th
[18:06] brother Brandon was asking his
[18:07] congregation if any had read brother
[18:10] vale's rewriting or grammarizing of the
[18:13] church age book two or three of them did
[18:15] in the congregation
[18:17] and brother Brown compliments Lee Bailey
[18:19] said I think you've done a real job
[18:20] brother Vale a real job and then he said
[18:23] sister Vail I think sister Vale did it
[18:26] and you just wrote it down and she done
[18:28] it let's listen to the quote
[18:34] for me have you read any of it yeah I
[18:37] think you've done a real job brother
[18:38] Bill real job dude I think sister Vale
[18:41] did it you just uh wrote an answer
[18:44] regarding sister vale's involvement a
[18:46] wonderful Minister asked me a couple
[18:48] years ago about sister avails
[18:50] involvement in the church age book and
[18:52] this lovely Minister this wonderful
[18:55] brother does not use the church age book
[18:57] and my reply was yes I see there's two
[19:00] quotes about sister Veil doing some work
[19:02] related to the church age book
[19:04] but I have nine quotes of brother
[19:06] Brandon saying it was his book
[19:08] and there are two quotes after this
[19:10] sister Veil quote where brother random
[19:13] calls the book his own and that's where
[19:15] brother Brown said Gordon Lindsay's
[19:17] printing my book and he said quote my
[19:20] writing of the church Ages end quote so
[19:23] my conclusion is that brother Branham
[19:24] considered the book his own because he
[19:27] preached it and he got the Revelation
[19:28] and inspiration from the Holy Spirit to
[19:30] preach the series on the seven Church
[19:32] ages but then somehow brother and sister
[19:34] Vale were doing some sort of work on it
[19:37] nothing doctrinal it seems it seems
[19:40] brother random said brother Vale and
[19:41] sister Vale were just adding grammar to
[19:43] it which is evident there's words in the
[19:46] church age book that we never hear
[19:47] Brother random sang so I think most
[19:50] people will come to the conclusion that
[19:52] brother Vale and sister Vale did not
[19:54] write the church age book next let's
[19:56] look at a quote from doors indoor from
[19:59] February 6 1965. brother Brandon said
[20:02] quote my tapes end quote were sent to
[20:04] brother Vale to grammarize them and then
[20:06] here's where brother Branham says it
[20:08] went through a few revisions back and
[20:10] forth a couple times I love this quote
[20:13] because brother random says himself
[20:15] he revised the church age book a couple
[20:18] times he looked at leeville's work at
[20:21] least a couple times and revised it and
[20:23] then approved that it would be sent to
[20:25] the printer for printing and it even
[20:27] came out during his lifetime let's
[20:29] listen to the quote
[20:31] am I types of the seven Church ages I
[20:35] sent them to him to grammarize him
[20:37] because My Old Kentucky hit hate and
[20:41] Toten carry and fetched that don't go
[20:42] good for people who read this book so he
[20:45] was going to grammarize it for I mean
[20:46] then after he got through sent it back a
[20:48] couple times for more statements but
[20:50] your book is going to press now after
[20:52] about three four years
[20:54] next from Christ is revealed in his own
[20:57] word August 22nd 1965 regarding Lee Vale
[21:01] brother Brandon said levale is the
[21:03] writer of the books Lauren said he's
[21:05] getting the book ready now the seven
[21:07] Church ages and working with the Seven
[21:08] Seals now of course we don't want to
[21:10] misunderstand this quote and give leave
[21:13] ale the credit for the church age book
[21:14] because then we'd have to do away the
[21:16] nine other quotes where Bella Graham
[21:18] said this was his book so of course
[21:19] brother Branham is referring to leevail
[21:21] editing the books and fixing the grammar
[21:24] let's listen to the quote
[21:26] well Bale is our brother here a writer
[21:28] of the books and he's getting the book
[21:29] ready now the seven Church ages and
[21:32] working with the Seven Seals and we'll
[21:34] soon hope to have him out pretty soon
[21:37] the final quote is from a man running
[21:39] from the presence of the Lord February
[21:41] 17 1965. brother Brown said the seven
[21:44] Church age book has answers to a lot of
[21:46] questions that's been in the people's
[21:48] hearts and he said brother Vale kind of
[21:51] helped him with this and would glamorize
[21:54] to keep the line of the same thought
[21:57] and give him help with grammar
[21:59] so again I think this is proof that
[22:02] brother Lee Vale and sister Vale did not
[22:04] write the church age book they
[22:06] grammarized the book they edited the
[22:07] book and they did their best to keep the
[22:09] same line of thought the same Revelation
[22:11] that God had revealed to brother Branham
[22:13] during the seven Church age sermons
[22:15] let's listen to the quote
[22:17] so I got brother Vale to kind of help me
[22:20] with this and keep the line of the same
[22:22] thought and give it grammar and I'm sure
[22:25] I might remember it would be a mystery
[22:27] to him sure enough so uh the brother of
[22:30] veil is really good on that so he's as a
[22:34] in closing

[22:37] prove to you the validity of the seven
[22:40] Church age book again I love this book
