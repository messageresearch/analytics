[33:02] 13
[33:06] and they brought young children to him
[33:08] that he should touch them
[33:10] and his disciples rebuked those that
[33:13] brought them
[33:14] but when jesus saw he was much
[33:16] displeased
[33:18] and said unto them suffer the little
[33:19] children to come unto me
[33:21] and forbid them not for of such
[33:25] is the kingdom of god that's why we'll
[33:27] baptize them at early ages if they feel
[33:29] that to be baptized and
[33:30] that's why we'll let them come to jesus
[33:32] as early as possible praise god amen
[33:34] verse 15 for verily i say unto you
[33:38] whosoever shall not receive the kingdom
[33:40] of god as a little child
[33:42] he shall not enter therein we just love
[33:45] verse 16
[33:46] and he took them up in his arms put his
[33:48] hands upon them

[34:46] heavenly father we've read your word
[34:48] we know lord this is the most important
[34:50] part of the service lord although
[34:51] singing is so important to drive away
[34:54] our evil thoughts or anything we're
[34:55] battling lord god it sets us free lord
[34:57] god
[34:58] uh transform our minds lord god we're so
[35:01] grateful
[35:02] but father we know the word has life
[35:04] lord god and we just pray god you

[35:07] anoint everyone to hear lord god anoint
[35:09] me to hear as well
[35:11] and father we just enjoy your presence
[35:13] lord god today
[35:14] meet every need lord as those who press
[35:17] their way out to the house of god to
[35:19] hear from god
[35:20] we know judgment begins at the house of
[35:21] god so does blessing
[35:23] so does healing so does teaching so does
[35:25] correction all these great blessings
[35:27] here begin at the house of god we're
[35:29] happy to be gathered in your house
[35:31] and so father we thank you for this time
[35:33] this the scriptures we've read
[35:35] and father we also thank you for this uh
[35:37] child zion lord you've blessed us with
[35:39] as we dedicate him soon here so father
[35:41] bless your people i pray
[35:43] in jesus christ's name the saint said
[35:45] amen god bless you for being seated
[35:47] there praise god
[35:52] so i'm gonna invite my wife and my
[35:53] family up here
[35:55] and we'll have a word of prayer here for
[35:59] zion's dedication as they're coming i
[36:02] just want to read a scripture hebrews
[36:04] 12 22
[36:10] the mount zion we looked at that a few
[36:11] weeks ago is the highest mountain in
[36:13] israel it's the mountain where jesus
[36:15] will reveal himself to the 144 000
[36:18] on that mountain according to revelation
[36:20] 14. but the bible says
[36:22] it refers this this mountain also refers
[36:26] uh to the church of the firstborn so it
[36:28] refers to the born-again
[36:30] holy ghost-filled saints amen so this
[36:32] mountain peak here
[36:33] and that's exactly what happens with 144
[36:35] thousand they get born again
[36:37] of the holy ghost and they get it on top
[36:39] of a mountain
[36:40] so it symbolizes the height of human
[36:43] existence right
[36:44] being born again not living to the
[36:46] things of the flesh
[36:47] but walking in the spirit praise god and
[36:50] the verse 22 says but ye are come
[36:52] unto mount zion unto the city of the
[36:55] living god
[36:56] the heavenly jerusalem and to an
[36:58] innumerable company of angels
[37:00] to the general assembly and church of
[37:02] the firstborn
[37:03] which are written in heaven and to god
[37:06] the judge of all and to the spirits of
[37:09] just men
[37:10] made perfect and to jesus the mediator
[37:13] of the new covenant and to the blood of
[37:15] sprinkling
[37:16] that speaketh better things than that of
[37:19] abel praise god
[37:20] so who do you have at this top of mount
[37:21] zion you have the saints right you have
[37:23] all the born again saints
[37:24] but most importantly you have jesus
[37:26] christ amen the mediator
[37:28] of that new covenant praise god so
[37:31] brother man could you get a few pictures
[37:33] of us
[37:43] the story behind his name is that my
[37:45] wife had a dream
[37:46] um she was expecting and in the dream
[37:49] she had the baby and
[37:51] handed the baby to me and said here's
[37:52] your son zion jesse so we didn't know
[37:55] what name you know
[37:57] and then my wife
[38:02] and so my wife said it was a very
[38:04] supernatural dream she woke up kind of
[38:06] shaking and really felt the presence of
[38:08] the lord so
[38:10] that's why we decided to name it zion
[38:11] and jesse i'm so grateful for another
[38:13] boy as well
[38:15] okay so we're very grateful so
[38:18] thank the lord jesus for his healthy
[38:20] arrival and let's just bring a blessing
[38:22] over him to the children

[43:02] series on the mystery of god's will
[43:04] brother cam is reading that chapter with
[43:05] his family right now he said it's been a
[43:06] great blessing to his family so
[43:08] i'm very encouraged about that um
[43:12] and so it's nice to see the word of god
[43:13] having a great impact and
[43:15] helping people uh before i forget
[43:17] someone uh
[43:18] before i forget i know who it was but
[43:20] someone said our family an anonymous
[43:21] check in the mail
[43:23] this week there's no name on it just
[43:26] says god bless
[43:28] for a substantial amount of money so um
[43:31] whoever was maybe there's nobody here
[43:35] whoever it was i don't know who it was
[43:37] but thank you for your kindness and
[43:39] generosity
[43:42] god's word is true you know god's word
[43:43] is true god is faithful
[43:45] and if we honor him in our little humble
[43:47] ways
[43:48] then he certainly opens the windows of
[43:50] heaven and pours out blessings upon us
[43:53] i forgot to announce that wins i think
[43:55] we got the the letter wednesday and i
[43:57] forgot to announce it wednesday at
[43:58] church
[43:59] um but you know we're humbled you know
[44:02] just things like that just make me want
[44:03] to cry
[44:04] and uh so i'm not going to cry i'll cry
[44:07] at the end of the service while we're
[44:08] worshiping jesus
[44:09] lord willing we'll see but i just want
[44:11] to thank whoever had on their heart to
[44:13] do that may the lord richly bless you
[44:15] and uh we just want to extend it forward
[44:17] you know we just always want to be a
[44:18] help and
[44:19] be a blessing to other people as as
[44:21] we're able right we just
[44:22] as we're able the bible says good to
[44:24] those of the faith especially those of
[44:26] the household of faith
[44:28] so we want to treat and love another uh
[44:30] as best as we can
[44:31] by god's grace so philippians 4
[44:34] we're working our way through the book i
[44:35] trust it's been a blessing to you
[44:37] it's been a great blessing to me uh so
[44:40] verses one to nine we'll try to get one
[44:42] to nine today
[44:43] i don't i don't know if we'll get that
[44:44] far but we'll try to let me set a timer

[44:56] that i want to keep them here all day
[44:59] i want to watch my time uh so lord bless
[45:02] them
[45:03] what's that okay not too late tonight
[45:05] okay
[45:07] okay wonderful awesome what a blessing
[45:13] hallelujah we just you know it's a good
[45:16] good reminder we gotta enjoy our parents
[45:17] while we have them yeah
[45:19] i was listening to a preacher one time
[45:21] and he wasn't in the message but he
[45:22] noticed
[45:23] different people in his life that he met
[45:25] different
[45:26] ones he met ministered to they always
[45:29] they felt their lives were cursed
[45:30] until they honored their parents and so
[45:33] the point he was making the bible says
[45:35] honor thy mother and father right
[45:37] and then he he just noticed a lot of
[45:39] people let's say hundreds of people
[45:41] had struggles and curses in their lives
[45:43] like just things they couldn't get over
[45:45] and he advised them you know have you
[45:47] ever asked your parents
[45:48] you know forgiveness from things you've
[45:50] done against them and he said as soon as
[45:52] they would do that many of them would
[45:53] see victory in their lives
[45:55] because it's one of god's promises amen
[45:57] it's the first promise
[45:59] i'm sorry first commandment with promise
[46:00] right for a long life on the earth so
[46:03] just something to keep in mind there
[46:04] it's always good to honor uh
[46:06] parents praise god so the first section
[46:09] is the god of peace and we want to
[46:11] look at three thoughts here in verse one
[46:15] so verse one says therefore my brethren
[46:17] dearly beloved and longed for
[46:20] uh my joy and crown so stand fast
[46:24] in the lord my dearly beloved so you
[46:27] want to look at these uh three thoughts
[46:29] here
[46:29] dearly beloved uh my joy and crown and
[46:32] standing fast
[46:33] in the lord all right so i want to just
[46:37] uh
[46:38] you know as i read this here i remember
[46:40] back in chapter one and and
[46:42] scholars can recognize how this this
[46:45] letter is one of paul's most loving
[46:47] letters
[46:48] i think we're all familiar with some of
[46:50] his more rebuking letters
[46:52] right corinthians does that sound
[46:53] familiar to anybody
[46:56] uh galatians he said i might have to
[46:58] work with you to get born again
[47:00] you know he said i'm gonna have to birth
[47:01] you again uh he really bawled out a lot
[47:04] of
[47:04] churches but this is noted as one of his
[47:07] most loving letters
[47:08] and so as i was reading this you know he
[47:11] calls them my dearly
[47:12] beloved and i reminded me of earlier in
[47:15] the chapter earlier in the book rather
[47:17] where he said
[47:18] every time i remember this church
[47:20] remember he was only there for a short
[47:22] time maybe days maybe a week a couple
[47:24] weeks he wasn't there very long
[47:27] but every time he remembered that church
[47:29] that god
[47:30] used him to start he thanked the lord
[47:32] for it every time
[47:33] praise god my talk about talk about a
[47:36] victory talk about an impact
[47:38] these people had on his life just in a
[47:40] short
[47:41] very short period of time there was such
[47:43] an impact no doubt lydia was one of them
[47:45] right the philippian jailer was one of
[47:47] them
[47:47] him and his household were some of them
[47:50] that had such an amazing impact
[47:52] on the prophet's life that every time he
[47:54] thought of him he just offered a quick
[47:56] prayer do you
[47:56] do that sometimes you you run into
[47:58] somebody saying lord bless them
[48:00] can i just pray for you real quick
[48:03] that's why i prayed for my mom yesterday
[48:05] i said oh let's all come in here and
[48:06] pray i don't want to miss the
[48:07] opportunity to pray for people
[48:08] and ask god's favor upon their lives but
[48:11] the bible says always in every prayer
[48:13] mind for you
[48:14] all making requests with joy so
[48:18] the love that he felt for them caused
[48:20] him to have a feeling in prayer
[48:22] so as he remembered oh such great times
[48:25] in the lord
[48:26] it made him joyful as he prayed i hope
[48:28] my life
[48:29] does that to you i and your life does
[48:31] that to me when i think of you
[48:33] i get happy praise god i don't get
[48:35] discouraged i don't get
[48:36] uh angry i don't get bitter i don't get
[48:39] jealous i don't get selfish right
[48:40] we want to be joyful when we think about
[48:43] one another in the lord praise god
[48:44] or when you think of lymah our saints in
[48:46] life our friends in albion right
[48:48] our friends uh uh at sheffield oh it
[48:51] ought to bring such a joy to our lives
[48:53] to think about wow thank god for their
[48:55] testimonies thank god for
[48:57] all that they've done in our lives
[48:58] praise god amen so he said always in
[49:01] every prayer of mine and that's i don't
[49:02] know if he's being
[49:03] uh what do they call that
[49:07] i don't know if he's exaggerating but he
[49:09] says every prayer
[49:10] uh for you all making my request with
[49:13] joy
[49:14] is it possible every prayer he was uh
[49:16] remembering them each time he prayed
[49:18] it's possible especially for a prophet
[49:21] and what was he thanking god for for
[49:22] their fellowship
[49:24] in the gospel from the first day until
[49:27] now
[49:28] thank god church that we know the
[49:29] difference between fellowship with the
[49:31] world
[49:32] and fellowship in the gospel amen
[49:35] there is no fellowship like the
[49:37] fellowship in christ jesus
[49:38] amen amen in other words you'll never
[49:40] have a friend like a christian friend
[49:43] amen praise god you'll never have a
[49:45] trustworthy associate
[49:47] like you will have in the church of
[49:48] jesus christ amen
[49:51] you'll never have a more giving uh a
[49:54] person
[49:55] than you'll find in the body of jesus
[49:57] christ praise god
[49:59] amen because it's the fellowship
[50:02] in the gospel so paul was thanking god
[50:04] for the fellowship that they had
[50:06] what a wonderful testimony that these
[50:08] saints had
[50:10] and then i thought later and just again
[50:13] we're remembering the beginning of his
[50:15] letter where he said
[50:17] even as it is me for me to think of this
[50:20] of you all
[50:21] because i have you in my heart so paul
[50:24] had a special place
[50:26] he made room in his heart we seen that
[50:27] song make room right we need to make
[50:29] room for jesus right he's knocking on
[50:31] the door of our hearts
[50:32] we gotta let him in but also we have to
[50:35] have room in our hearts for other people
[50:38] if we don't have a feeling for somebody
[50:39] we got to pray until we do have a
[50:41] feeling for somebody
[50:43] praise god not just our friends and
[50:44] family but even our enemies praise god
[50:46] because jesus said you must love your
[50:48] enemies praise god
[50:49] amen but look the saints weren't just
[50:52] in his mind they were also in his heart
[50:54] which means his emotions right
[50:57] he he emotionally felt a connection to
[51:00] them
[51:00] uh because of the fellowship that they
[51:03] had in the gospel
[51:04] in other words the good news of jesus
[51:06] christ had such an impact
[51:08] on them that it impacted him and he
[51:10] could never get away from it brother
[51:12] banks
[51:12] he could never get away from remember he
[51:14] wrote this from a prison praise god
[51:16] he wrote it from a prison he wrote this
[51:18] letter from a prison and even in prison
[51:20] even in change he couldn't get away from
[51:23] the love of those holy ghost-filled
[51:25] christians
[51:26] amen so think about that even though
[51:29] he's in physical change
[51:30] he's spiritually free from those chains
[51:33] where many chains of bondage praise god
[51:35] and he changed the bitterness and he
[51:37] changed the fear he was free from those
[51:39] any chains of doubt about their love
[51:41] he was free from all that even though he
[51:43] was in natural chains
[51:45] he was free from the spiritual change
[51:47] because we know jesus breaks every chain
[51:49] amen he might let you suffer with a
[51:51] little physical chain
[51:53] right but he's going to set us free from
[51:55] spiritual change
[51:56] because he's the waymaker the chain
[51:58] breaker right we know there's power in
[52:00] one name
[52:00] the name of jesus amen amen hallelujah
[52:04] look at that because i have you in my
[52:07] heart
[52:10] remember jesus said from the abundance
[52:11] of the heart
[52:13] the mouth talks so your words we say
[52:16] about each other are very important
[52:18] because it shows if they're in our
[52:20] hearts in a good way or in a bad way
[52:24] right that's why no matter who whoever's
[52:26] against you whoever's against you
[52:28] say good things praise god let the love
[52:30] of jesus christ the bible say
[52:32] let the love of jesus christ rule your
[52:34] hearts amen
[52:36] right let the love of christ rule your
[52:38] hearts let
[52:39] love always rule have preeminence over
[52:42] everything praise god in other words
[52:44] remember love is benevolence right
[52:46] good will amen you want the best you
[52:49] want god's blessings you want to see
[52:51] people get deliverances and healings
[52:53] and victory and salvation and repentance
[52:56] you will you want the best for them
[52:57] which is god's word amen
[53:01] that's the only good thing there really
[53:02] is god's word amen
[53:05] so we thank the lord for that see he
[53:08] made a place
[53:09] in his heart for the saints in a special
[53:12] place
[53:13] in his heart praise god i think that's a
[53:16] beautiful testimony
[53:17] especially because only being there for
[53:19] a short time and then i just i i brought
[53:22] up the other
[53:23] examples when he used beloved in the
[53:25] letter
[53:26] he said wherefore my beloved as you have
[53:28] always obeyed
[53:30] not as in my presence only but now much
[53:32] more in my absence
[53:34] work out your own salvation with fear
[53:36] and trembling so that means while he was
[53:37] there brother bang for that short time
[53:39] they were obeying everything he was
[53:40] teaching them
[53:42] but he but someone must have come and
[53:44] told him later but maybe epiphanicists
[53:46] or some of those other brothers he
[53:47] mentioned at the end
[53:48] they must have spent time there and then
[53:51] reported back to paul
[53:52] in the prison saying they're actually
[53:54] more obedient now to what you taught
[53:56] them
[53:57] and that's how we should be as well
[53:59] right we we shouldn't decline in
[54:01] obedience we should increase in
[54:02] obedience
[54:04] right we shouldn't we shouldn't increase
[54:06] in
[54:08] slavery to sin we should increase in
[54:10] freedom of the spirit
[54:11] amen praise god amen we should increase
[54:15] in liberty praise god we should increase
[54:17] in joy and love and the fruits of the
[54:19] holy spirit
[54:20] and if not then we've got to check our
[54:22] ground and make sure our ground
[54:23] has no more thorns in it praise god amen
[54:26] make sure they're rooted up by the holy
[54:28] spirit let the great guard or jesus
[54:30] root up any thorns and bitterness
[54:32] because we should be bringing forth love
[54:34] their obedience grew after the prophet
[54:36] left so does ours amen hallelujah even
[54:39] though the prophet brother graham's off
[54:40] the scene
[54:41] our obedience grows amen we still love
[54:44] god we still believe god's word
[54:45] we'll hang on if nobody else will stand
[54:47] we'll stand for jesus amen
[54:50] so our obedience grows and
[54:53] that really shows you love the prophet
[54:55] of god when you obey his bible-based
[54:57] teachings praise god
[54:58] amen my wife says i do this all the time
[55:00] so i'm gonna try to be more aware of
[55:02] that always
[55:03] like this i'm trying to be more aware of
[55:06] my mannerisms here
[55:07] not to get in the routine you know now i
[55:10] wanted to say this uh
[55:13] paul used dearly beloved seven times
[55:16] now this is a good example church this
[55:19] is one of his well i'm sorry not this
[55:20] one the next one
[55:21] corinthians was one of his most scathing
[55:23] letters right
[55:25] but yet twice he calls him his dearly
[55:27] beloved
[55:28] so that proves church sometimes when you
[55:30] love somebody sometimes you got to
[55:31] rebuke him a little bit
[55:33] we hate to be on the receiving end but
[55:35] we ought to be thankful if we need it
[55:38] right right because he was their gospel
[55:41] father right he was the one
[55:43] that brought them the word a prophet of
[55:44] god so he calls
[55:47] uh seven times paul uses uh dearly
[55:50] beloved so
[55:50] dearly beloved avenge not yourselves
[55:54] now just picture the picture you're
[55:56] reading that for the first time
[55:58] there must have been people at the roman
[55:59] church that wanted revenge
[56:02] right if i could just get back at so and
[56:04] so if i could just get back
[56:07] they wanted revenge so paul he changes
[56:09] his word into matching
[56:12] oh my dearly beloved please
[56:15] can you can you kind of hear him like a
[56:17] fatherly type of figure
[56:20] oh children my dearly beloved children
[56:23] do not avenge yourselves don't don't try
[56:26] to get back at people
[56:28] let god be the avenger let god be the
[56:31] avenger right
[56:31] vengeance is mine saith the lord praise
[56:34] god
[56:35] so we can we kind of get that idea
[56:37] because remember paul said you have many
[56:39] uh your many teachers but not many
[56:41] fathers
[56:42] praise god so paul knew the first one
[56:44] who brings you the message
[56:46] is like the father in the faith right
[56:48] and so he said you have
[56:49] some thousand teachers but not many
[56:51] fathers
[56:53] and you in our lives we should be able
[56:55] to recognize when did the word first
[56:57] come to us
[56:58] praise god and recognize who did god use
[57:01] and make sure that person
[57:02] is their life is lined up with god's
[57:04] word amen amen
[57:06] so for us for me it's like brother
[57:08] brother simon right brother brother
[57:09] brooks brother cam
[57:10] i'm sorry brother brother craig some of
[57:13] those fathers that
[57:14] sat down and took the time to teach me
[57:16] the word of god
[57:17] i looked up to them like fathers you
[57:19] know i look up to them like i'm talking
[57:20] to brother brooks this week about that
[57:22] same thing
[57:22] we were talking uh just keeping prayer
[57:26] you know he lost his mother and also
[57:27] just keep him in prayer he said it's
[57:28] really hard on his sister ruby
[57:30] um so just keep him in prayer but he's
[57:33] doing good by god's grace
[57:35] uh i just want to notice that avenge
[57:37] that yourselves but
[57:39] neither give place unto wrath for it is
[57:41] written vengeance is mine
[57:43] i will repay saith the lord so
[57:46] you don't have to you and i don't have
[57:47] to worry about getting anybody back
[57:50] right you have to worry about making
[57:53] anything right
[57:54] now unless you did something wrong to
[57:55] somebody then you go make it right
[57:57] but paul nearly tells him god will fight
[58:00] for you
[58:01] amen amen god will fight your battles
[58:03] praise god
[58:04] someone hurt you someone offended you
[58:06] someone that's around god
[58:08] will fight the battles praise god and
[58:10] god will bring it
[58:12] to a head either in this life or
[58:14] certainly the next life to come
[58:16] now our prayers as christians is god
[58:17] help me to make everything right now on
[58:19] this side
[58:21] right because like the man says we don't
[58:22] want any trouble down at the river
[58:24] right we don't want we don't want there
[58:25] to be any questions and uh
[58:27] wondering or worrying about this or that
[58:30] uh god just bring
[58:31] everything uh to a head now so i can
[58:33] have everything
[58:34] no debts praise god no debts amen
[58:40] now i just want to give you the
[58:42] definition so what's the definition
[58:44] definition of dearly beloved
[58:46] my esteemed my
[58:49] favorite people right
[58:52] my worthy ones of my love
[58:56] dearly favorites he'd say avenge not
[59:00] yourselves
[59:02] see church we we don't want to be
[59:03] prideful like get bride pride cam was
[59:05] telling me about that yesterday
[59:07] i like that little rhyme because it's an
[59:08] evil sin right bride is an evil sin
[59:13] so i guess you know it we know where the
[59:16] apple of jesus's eye but we don't brag
[59:18] about it
[59:19] and we don't get prideful about it
[59:23] but we have to recognize the reason
[59:25] where that is because he's called us to
[59:26] a high calling
[59:28] we look at every other people's lives in
[59:30] our family how come they don't live
[59:31] higher
[59:32] how come they don't live higher it's
[59:33] because they're called to it but they've
[59:34] turned it down
[59:35] but you and i have received it and
[59:37] because of that paul calls us the
[59:39] beloved the favorite of god
[59:41] amen amen and if you don't remember that
[59:44] go to song of solomon
[59:46] and read all about that praise god read
[59:48] all about that how she the shoe
[59:50] of mine is the apple of his eye he said
[59:53] there's many women but you're my one and
[59:54] only dove
[59:55] you're my you're my garden and you're my
[59:58] locked and secure garment and you're
[1:00:00] sealing to me to no one else
[1:00:02] you're my one and only that's how we are
[1:00:04] where jesus is one and only praise god
[1:00:07] where is dearly beloved
[1:00:13] how many believe that
[1:00:16] that's what the scripture says where is
[1:00:18] favor
[1:00:20] not because uh not not not by pride
[1:00:23] but by the free moral response free more
[1:00:26] agency
[1:00:27] remember god can't force anybody to
[1:00:29] heaven nor can he force people
[1:00:31] to hell he has to give them free more
[1:00:33] agency
[1:00:34] so because you've surrendered your free
[1:00:36] moral ability because you said god
[1:00:38] i don't want my choices i want your
[1:00:40] choice praise god
[1:00:41] because you've done that uh surrender of
[1:00:44] responsibility and choice
[1:00:46] and you've prayed like jesus in the
[1:00:48] garden not my will but thy will be done
[1:00:50] because you prayed that then jesus looks
[1:00:53] on you as you're his favorite
[1:00:55] his dearly beloved like a husband does
[1:00:58] his wife
[1:00:59] there's many great women out there but
[1:01:01] there's only one mrs jesse smith
[1:01:04] she's my favorite you know one and only
[1:01:06] praise god
[1:01:08] that that's the picture it's a man he
[1:01:11] can only choose one
[1:01:12] you know there's all the choices right
[1:01:13] you can only choose one that's your
[1:01:15] favorite praise that's the one you want
[1:01:16] to have the rest of your life praise god
[1:01:18] and that's that's why we are he's called
[1:01:20] us not to just be a woman a woman a
[1:01:22] church a church a pride of bride
[1:01:24] but his favorite his one and only his
[1:01:26] true bride who's filled with the holy
[1:01:28] spirit amen
[1:01:29] who truly obeys all his word and wants
[1:01:31] to be dressed
[1:01:32] with his word amen because the bible
[1:01:35] said put you on
[1:01:36] the lord jesus christ amen put on the
[1:01:38] garments of righteousness praise god
[1:01:41] put on the clothes of holiness right
[1:01:43] physically and spiritually praise god
[1:01:45] put on the garments of righteousness
[1:01:47] amen hallelujah so i'm not calling
[1:01:52] myself
[1:01:53] god's favorite i'm just saying god said
[1:01:55] i'm his favorite
[1:01:57] you take it up with god if you disagree
[1:01:59] but if i don't act like god's favorite
[1:02:01] then you come correct me because i want
[1:02:02] to be god's favorite
[1:02:04] right just like i got to correct you if
[1:02:05] i have to right you have to correct me
[1:02:07] if you have to
[1:02:08] we want to be god's bride praise god
[1:02:11] that's what dearly beloved means you
[1:02:12] know
[1:02:13] sometimes we just read over right
[1:02:16] but clearly uh it's an esteemed calling
[1:02:19] to be the dearly beloved of christ jesus
[1:02:24] now here dearly beloved longboard nearly
[1:02:27] beloved
[1:02:28] so here he says it twice i think one in
[1:02:30] first corinthians and then one in second
[1:02:32] wherefore my dearly beloved flee from
[1:02:34] idolatry
[1:02:36] okay remember we looked at this uh we
[1:02:38] didn't get to it but
[1:02:40] curses will come upon people for
[1:02:42] idolatry
[1:02:44] that was with dan and eve remember that
[1:02:46] man said people can have their names
[1:02:47] removed from the book of life
[1:02:48] we've looked at many different uh idols
[1:02:50] right
[1:02:51] we've looked at all the kinds of member
[1:02:53] iniquity the series we did on iniquity
[1:02:55] there's so many kinds of idols but here
[1:02:57] paul has to
[1:02:58] bring this fatherly tone down and say
[1:03:02] children you're my dearly beloved you're
[1:03:04] jesus's favorite
[1:03:06] or you might say my favorite he said you
[1:03:10] have to flee for my adultery i doubt you
[1:03:12] he so he said don't avenge yourself
[1:03:15] don't try to
[1:03:16] carry out your own wrath children don't
[1:03:18] do that
[1:03:19] your favorites of jesus don't do that it
[1:03:21] says and don't make yourselves idols
[1:03:24] don't let anything so make you so happy
[1:03:27] or
[1:03:27] or consume all your thinking like you do
[1:03:30] jesus
[1:03:31] give jesus the first place give him the
[1:03:34] highest praise amen
[1:03:35] hallelujah praise god give jesus the
[1:03:37] highest praise amen
[1:03:39] give him the best of your time the best
[1:03:41] of your energy praise god
[1:03:42] the best of your money right the best of
[1:03:44] your efforts give him the best of
[1:03:46] everything praise god because he's
[1:03:47] worthy of it
[1:03:49] amen
[1:03:52] so yes again as a father
[1:03:56] don't try to get revenge stay away from
[1:03:59] that
[1:04:00] love and please he said don't engage in
[1:04:03] idolatry
[1:04:04] now we know the closest thing for us
[1:04:06] would probably be like worshiping
[1:04:08] brother branham
[1:04:09] right like the churches uh out west
[1:04:11] right or a little bit further west in
[1:04:13] here we've
[1:04:14] gone on that over and over and over
[1:04:15] again they worship mother brandon
[1:04:17] uh but the other thing is not to worship
[1:04:18] ourselves right in that age where
[1:04:20] there's so much financial prosperity we
[1:04:22] cannot worship
[1:04:23] ourselves and our own families right
[1:04:27] and you'll see it if anything ever
[1:04:28] becomes uh above the lord you'll see it
[1:04:30] in your life and that
[1:04:32] the sin will manifest itself right and
[1:04:35] we've got to say god forgive me
[1:04:38] i confess my sins cleanse me with your
[1:04:41] blood
[1:04:42] and lord i give you first place again
[1:04:43] praise god amen
[1:04:45] right because it's the the spirit of
[1:04:48] this age
[1:04:49] remember the spirit of this age is uh to
[1:04:52] say i have need of nothing
[1:04:55] i don't need to study the word of god i
[1:04:58] don't need to sing songs
[1:04:59] right i don't need to go to church i
[1:05:02] don't need that
[1:05:04] and thinking they need something else
[1:05:06] right but that is our greatest
[1:05:08] need to be with god speech dearly
[1:05:09] beloved praise god amen
[1:05:11] to be with jesus and his people those
[1:05:14] that live
[1:05:15] at mount zion praise god the general
[1:05:17] assembly of the firstborn praise god
[1:05:19] that's who we want to be a part of amen
[1:05:21] that group that group has to get
[1:05:23] our attention and
[1:05:26] flee from idolatry
[1:05:31] now here's the other mention he says it
[1:05:33] uh
[1:05:34] again in second corinthians having
[1:05:37] therefore i think this is beautiful
[1:05:38] having therefore these promises dearly
[1:05:40] beloved let us cleanse ourselves from
[1:05:42] all filthiness of flesh and spirit
[1:05:45] perfecting the holiness and the fear of
[1:05:46] god
[1:05:48] again thank thinking that we excuse
[1:05:50] ourselves unto you
[1:05:51] we speak before god in christ but we do
[1:05:54] all things dearly beloved for your
[1:05:56] edifying
[1:05:57] so paul and his missionary team did you
[1:05:59] know there's women on this missionary
[1:06:01] team
[1:06:02] they weren't preachers but they were on
[1:06:03] his team just like jesus remember jesus
[1:06:06] had susanna
[1:06:07] and the wife of jesus and all those
[1:06:08] women getting the food and doing
[1:06:10] everything like that
[1:06:11] jesus had a team or paul had a team just
[1:06:13] like jesus did
[1:06:15] he said we we do all these things for
[1:06:18] your edification
[1:06:20] so paul's whole life was to build up the
[1:06:22] corinthian church
[1:06:23] right his whole life was to build up how
[1:06:25] can i strengthen the philippian church
[1:06:27] how can i strengthen righteous christ
[1:06:29] fellowship that ought to be our prayer
[1:06:32] right you can't church you and i cannot
[1:06:35] strengthen people in kenya and africa
[1:06:36] like we'd like to right
[1:06:38] i mean they can watch our services but
[1:06:39] how can we really edify them
[1:06:41] right it's very hard to do and so god
[1:06:44] set it up where
[1:06:45] god's not asking us really to edify them
[1:06:47] as much god's asking us to edify one
[1:06:49] another here
[1:06:51] with the love of god amen so we that's
[1:06:54] why we come to church how can i build up
[1:06:55] brother amen
[1:06:56] how can i build up my wife how can i
[1:06:58] build up the saints
[1:07:00] that's the attitude we need to have when
[1:07:01] we come to the house of god help me to
[1:07:03] be able to build them up also
[1:07:05] everything i do is for their edification
[1:07:09] not tear down build up praise god but i
[1:07:14] like this here so
[1:07:15] he says it again children don't have
[1:07:17] idols
[1:07:19] don't worship this world right don't let
[1:07:21] anything come between you and jesus
[1:07:24] don't take wrath as a father don't take
[1:07:26] wrath dearly beloved
[1:07:28] my favorites and my favorite people
[1:07:31] please
[1:07:32] separate yourself from all filthiness of
[1:07:35] the flesh and spirit
[1:07:37] he gets down to this really touching
[1:07:40] fatherly manner it says separate
[1:07:42] yourself from anything that will
[1:07:44] pervert your mind and your thinking
[1:07:47] separate yourself from that
[1:07:48] you're my favorite you're god's
[1:07:50] favorites
[1:07:52] right because these boss they're paul's
[1:07:54] favorite right and jesus is favored
[1:07:56] there is dearly beloved
[1:08:01] now i think we all can admit we have
[1:08:02] room to get rid of some filthiness in
[1:08:04] our minds and our thoughts right
[1:08:07] so anybody here has got the perfect
[1:08:08] thought life never thought anything bad
[1:08:11] all week
[1:08:13] and everything all just blessings thrown
[1:08:15] out of you all the time
[1:08:16] no doubt no fear no unbelief no no no
[1:08:20] no critical spirits right no lust no
[1:08:22] pride no just all
[1:08:24] love all the time well just so you know
[1:08:27] later on
[1:08:28] this chapter paul finishes the chapter
[1:08:30] by saying how to
[1:08:31] win the battle of the mind which we're
[1:08:34] familiar with but i think if we're
[1:08:35] honest we all need to
[1:08:36] revisit that like i was telling my
[1:08:38] brother or paul yesterday i was
[1:08:41] like i'm telling paul
[1:08:44] uh when ben and rod came in here just
[1:08:46] preached on angels right
[1:08:47] i felt so happy i was just so well
[1:08:51] that was for you and your wife's
[1:08:52] answered of your prayers right
[1:08:56] i just felt so happy and so that and
[1:08:58] that night with it bang i got home and
[1:09:00] i went looked up all the other all the
[1:09:02] other brother ben rod sermons
[1:09:04] i started listening to him i'm like
[1:09:07] especially the one about prayer back in
[1:09:09] 2016
[1:09:09] in there and benjamin and austin are on
[1:09:12] the video you know
[1:09:13] i shared with austin he's like oh praise
[1:09:15] the lord he's trying to just pray for
[1:09:16] him he's trying to get
[1:09:18] get back with god but i thought wow i
[1:09:21] told paul i said
[1:09:22] we have such treasures
[1:09:25] we have the sermons that we have soared
[1:09:28] up on youtube
[1:09:30] the sermons you have on your phone for
[1:09:32] brother branham or from our church
[1:09:33] they're treasures and they have
[1:09:36] transformative power praise god
[1:09:39] amen so we need the reminding of the
[1:09:42] holy spirit to go back
[1:09:44] and listen to that because it helped my
[1:09:46] prayer life i went listen i'm listening
[1:09:48] to half of it
[1:09:49] it's like a two hour two half hour study
[1:09:51] brother ben did
[1:09:53] and it just stirred my prayer life back
[1:09:55] up
[1:09:56] and then the angels stirred us up you
[1:09:57] know just knowing and being aware of the
[1:09:59] angels of god
[1:10:03] and so i thought my what a what a
[1:10:05] blessed people we are
[1:10:07] uh and maybe may we yield to god
[1:10:12] washing away all of our filthiness of
[1:10:14] flesh and spirit
[1:10:18] that should be our prayer god to make uh
[1:10:20] make me an offering
[1:10:22] right wash away cleanse as the offering
[1:10:25] had to be washed right
[1:10:26] wash away any filthiness of my mind and
[1:10:29] my body
[1:10:33] and he talks to them like children
[1:10:35] favorites of god
[1:10:36] favorites of god cleanse yourself from
[1:10:39] any
[1:10:39] filthiness of mind and body
[1:10:45] yeah he says it to timothy said to
[1:10:46] timothy my dearly beloved son there it
[1:10:49] is
[1:10:49] my favorite son look at that and one of
[1:10:52] my daughters asked me daddy is it okay
[1:10:53] to have a best friend this morning
[1:10:55] she asked me is it okay to have a best
[1:10:56] friend or someone you our favorite uncle
[1:10:58] is that right i think it was
[1:10:59] yeah it was haley that's your idea and i
[1:11:02] was just studying on this i got up at 5
[1:11:03] 30 you know to study and everything
[1:11:05] at about eight o'clock she asked me yeah
[1:11:06] is it okay to have a favor i said
[1:11:08] yeah the bible says we can have
[1:11:10] favorites you know
[1:11:12] they're our dearly beloved right
[1:11:15] now we should show love to everybody but
[1:11:17] some people are going to impact you more
[1:11:19] you're going to have a unity with some
[1:11:21] people more than others
[1:11:24] right it's not that you
[1:11:28] don't love other people you love
[1:11:29] everybody if you're a real christian you
[1:11:31] love your enemies as we said
[1:11:32] but there's some people you just love
[1:11:34] more
[1:11:35] because they're your favorites that's
[1:11:38] what the bible says my dearly beloved
[1:11:41] son
[1:11:42] my favorite my esteemed son
[1:11:47] remember he went and circumcised timothy
[1:11:50] because it was going to help it was
[1:11:52] going to help the jews listen to timothy
[1:11:54] preach
[1:11:55] remember he wouldn't circumcise titus
[1:11:57] because they were false brethren
[1:12:00] that were just trying to get titus to
[1:12:02] join their false ranks
[1:12:04] their false doctrines so one case he did
[1:12:07] uh circumcise the brother another case
[1:12:09] he didn't
[1:12:10] based upon their motives and their
[1:12:11] objectives this is quite a
[1:12:14] quite a brotherhood here
[1:12:18] so he says my dearly timothy my dearly
[1:12:20] beloved son
[1:12:25] what beautiful words grace how many want
[1:12:26] god's grace mercy and peace
[1:12:29] if i just have those three things that's
[1:12:30] all i really need right there amen
[1:12:32] i can have god's grace his favor his
[1:12:36] mercy forgive me and my transgressions
[1:12:39] and his peace where i'm not at war with
[1:12:41] god i'm at peace with god
[1:12:43] i think i'd be one of the happiest
[1:12:44] gentlemen don't you
[1:12:47] the last time he says it is the philemon
[1:12:50] unto felenen
[1:12:51] our dearly beloved our our favorite
[1:12:56] are and highly esteemed brother
[1:13:02] remember this was the slave owner right
[1:13:05] who had the slave leave
[1:13:07] he got converted when he met paul and he
[1:13:10] sent the slave back and said philemon
[1:13:11] put his account all that he cost you
[1:13:13] put it on my account right and he had
[1:13:16] confidence that
[1:13:18] philemon uh would not hold it against
[1:13:20] his runaway slave that cost him
[1:13:22] we'll just say thousands of dollars
[1:13:24] right this man cost me a thousand
[1:13:26] dollars
[1:13:27] paul said put it on my account i'll pay
[1:13:29] the fee
[1:13:31] see because he he philemon was dearly
[1:13:33] beloved and when you love somebody
[1:13:35] you're able to help them out praise god
[1:13:37] you're willing to go the extra mile for
[1:13:39] them
[1:13:40] amen and we're still in verse one by the
[1:13:42] way chapter four
[1:13:46] i didn't think i thought i was going to
[1:13:47] get through this whole chapter uh today
[1:13:49] i don't think i'm going to uh let's
[1:13:51] finish verse 1.
[1:13:52] so he said my dearly beloved and long
[1:13:55] for
[1:13:57] he says my joy and crown
[1:14:03] so stand fast in the lord my dearly
[1:14:04] beloved now let's look at this here now
[1:14:06] i'm using albert barnes here
[1:14:08] brother graham references him in the
[1:14:10] church age book he was a truly anointed
[1:14:11] man of god
[1:14:12] with the spirit of the man age a true
[1:14:15] anointing of the holy spirit
[1:14:16] he said my joy he said the source of my
[1:14:19] joy so paul is saying
[1:14:20] this philippian church you're the source
[1:14:22] of my joy you make me happy
[1:14:25] now not just that their physical being
[1:14:28] right but their obedience to christ
[1:14:32] there it is right there and they didn't
[1:14:34] get less obedient
[1:14:35] they got more obedient as time went on
[1:14:38] that's why they caused paul joy these
[1:14:41] people are really dedicated to the word
[1:14:43] of god
[1:14:44] they really love the message they're
[1:14:45] really gonna uh allow the word of god to
[1:14:48] transform their whole lives
[1:14:50] year after year decade after decade
[1:14:52] praise god until their whole life is
[1:14:54] cleansed from filthiness
[1:14:55] they're really into christ amen amen
[1:14:58] they're really into it they're not
[1:14:59] pretenders
[1:15:00] they're not make believers they want to
[1:15:02] be fully transformed
[1:15:04] to be like christ he said that causes me
[1:15:08] joy when people are so hungry for christ
[1:15:12] oh glory amen he said you're the source
[1:15:15] of my joy
[1:15:16] he rejoiced in the fact they've been
[1:15:18] converted under him
[1:15:19] and in their holy walk and their
[1:15:20] friendship our chief joy is our
[1:15:23] friends that's what i said i got to see
[1:15:25] my family yesterday
[1:15:29] i'm just full of joy like that's my
[1:15:31] family right
[1:15:33] and this is the chief he says our chief
[1:15:35] joy
[1:15:36] is our friends i hope you feel the same
[1:15:40] but my chief joy is not my phone
[1:15:43] right right my chief
[1:15:46] joy is not the van out there that i
[1:15:47] really need to sweep out pretty bad
[1:15:49] i'll tell you that don't go looking in
[1:15:51] there after service okay
[1:15:53] oh sorry
[1:15:56] thank you sorry i got a little shortcut
[1:15:58] on there
[1:16:00] so the chief joy our chief joy in life
[1:16:03] is human interaction
[1:16:05] with souls that have been transformed by
[1:16:08] the spirit of christ
[1:16:09] amen it's our chief joy right it's our
[1:16:12] main joy in life is to be around people
[1:16:14] that have the love of christ
[1:16:16] that's true that's true and i've told
[1:16:19] you this before i love going to my
[1:16:20] family events and
[1:16:21] now thankfully at my side of the family
[1:16:23] i got some message believers on that
[1:16:24] side
[1:16:24] thank god it makes a lot easier
[1:16:28] now some of you don't so just keep
[1:16:30] praying
[1:16:31] just keep praying there's gonna be some
[1:16:33] hard family gatherings
[1:16:34] right as far as there may become battles
[1:16:36] but i don't know
[1:16:37] any greater weapon than god's love and
[1:16:40] if you go
[1:16:41] and just church we're coming up to
[1:16:43] thanksgiving and christmas
[1:16:44] pray before you go to those family
[1:16:46] fellowships pray
[1:16:48] right pray and ask god to give me a word
[1:16:51] give me an opportunity give me a chance
[1:16:53] to share your love with somebody
[1:16:57] like yesterday my brother was thanking
[1:16:59] me uh he and i talked on the phone
[1:17:02] uh early this year so back in january
[1:17:05] february
[1:17:06] he was having trouble with his boss and
[1:17:09] uh i said i said can i just pray with
[1:17:11] you right now we prayed
[1:17:13] and then he said uh months later nothing
[1:17:15] had changed he said so they had their
[1:17:17] annual
[1:17:18] meetings brother john would probably
[1:17:19] know about that you know you got to have
[1:17:21] a meeting with your boss or your
[1:17:22] supervisor every year
[1:17:24] and my brother said at that meeting
[1:17:27] the boss did something totally out of
[1:17:29] cater he said well what do you
[1:17:31] feel what's on your heart what do you
[1:17:33] like about my leadership he said what do
[1:17:35] you not like about my leadership
[1:17:37] i remember we had prayed for things to
[1:17:38] change and they weren't changing
[1:17:41] and then my brother told me after that
[1:17:43] prayer god opened up that door and he
[1:17:44] said you might not like what i'm going
[1:17:46] to say boss
[1:17:47] but here's what i think and he said
[1:17:50] their relationship has totally changed
[1:17:53] now here's a millionaire right he's
[1:17:54] probably a multi-millionaire he's single
[1:17:57] he don't have a wife and children
[1:17:58] so he spends all the money on himself
[1:17:59] bro
[1:18:01] that's how i tell him pause it man he
[1:18:04] needs to have children and he can lose
[1:18:05] some of his selfishness
[1:18:07] that's what happens when you have
[1:18:08] children right man can i get amen
[1:18:14] but with each one it's another part of
[1:18:16] you i got eight now right so
[1:18:17] eight parts of my selfishness are gone
[1:18:20] hopefully
[1:18:21] i tell you i still battle like crazy i
[1:18:24] can just overcome
[1:18:25] defeat jesse smith right the the sin in
[1:18:27] my members
[1:18:29] but he was saying what a change all we
[1:18:31] did was talk about it and pray
[1:18:33] and then god put it on the man's heart
[1:18:35] to just open himself up for criticism
[1:18:38] and for some honest discussion and he
[1:18:40] said my boss has totally changed his cut
[1:18:42] he said
[1:18:42] he said tapped his face said his
[1:18:44] countenance is totally changed
[1:18:47] i thought wow that's the power of prayer
[1:18:48] right there
[1:18:50] the power of prayer might have to wait a
[1:18:51] few months you know
[1:18:53] i have to wait a few years put it into
[1:18:56] the nail scarred hands put it into the
[1:18:58] faithful hands of jesus christ
[1:19:00] amen give it to the hands of the one
[1:19:02] who's gone in the fires
[1:19:04] greater than the ones you've gone
[1:19:05] through praise god he's walked through
[1:19:07] the fires of calvary right the fires of
[1:19:10] affliction praise god amen
[1:19:12] he's walked through those fires he's
[1:19:13] been through harder battles than we have
[1:19:15] if we put it in his hands
[1:19:17] and trust in him and wait upon him the
[1:19:18] bible said our strength will be renewed
[1:19:20] like the eagle
[1:19:26] chief joy is our friends the chief
[1:19:28] happiness of a minister of the gospel
[1:19:31] is in the pure lives of those to whom he
[1:19:33] ministers to
[1:19:36] that's so true hallelujah amen thank you
[1:19:38] jesus that's nothing but the truth
[1:19:40] now it's interesting i went looking for
[1:19:41] that scripture we're going to get to it
[1:19:42] next
[1:19:43] about no greater joy well i typed in the
[1:19:45] same words and i come across
[1:19:47] a similar thought in the in the second
[1:19:49] epistle i'd forgotten about
[1:19:51] i rejoiced greatly that i found
[1:19:54] 10 million dollars is that what he said
[1:19:58] no i regret re rejoice greatly
[1:20:01] that i found of thy children walking
[1:20:05] in the truth so paul was not
[1:20:09] he was not making things up he was not
[1:20:12] giving people lip service
[1:20:14] his real joy his greatest joy in life
[1:20:17] was to hear about christians obeying the
[1:20:20] word of god
[1:20:20] and faithfully living the word of god
[1:20:23] that
[1:20:24] was his greatest joy remember he had
[1:20:26] access to all the money through gamalia
[1:20:28] and the sanhedrin council i mean he
[1:20:31] could he had a license to go arrest
[1:20:32] people just breaking down people's doors
[1:20:34] i mean he had he had all the power right
[1:20:36] maybe not all the money but he had all
[1:20:38] the power you could ask for
[1:20:41] right that's like police officer power
[1:20:42] you know that's like judge power
[1:20:44] the power to take people's freedom and
[1:20:47] their lives
[1:20:48] but yet he said my rejoicing is that i
[1:20:52] found my children walking in truth
[1:20:55] sometimes i'm sure john and bang the
[1:20:58] other way johnny
[1:20:59] sometimes there's those moments where
[1:21:01] your children are maybe singing together
[1:21:03] or worshiping god and that's those
[1:21:05] moments like you try to catch them
[1:21:07] right obeying the lord that's the time i
[1:21:09] just whis
[1:21:12] pull out my phone real quick and try to
[1:21:13] record it you know
[1:21:16] it's like i caught them they're not
[1:21:18] arguing
[1:21:20] there's no discord it's just love
[1:21:23] amen
[1:21:26] and that's where that's where you have
[1:21:28] the greatest joy
[1:21:30] when you find your children walking in
[1:21:32] your truth doing
[1:21:33] what you ask them to do he said i
[1:21:36] rejoice
[1:21:37] greatly as we have received a
[1:21:41] commandment
[1:21:42] from the father so see before you can
[1:21:45] obey you've got to have the commandments
[1:21:47] right that's why we need to come to
[1:21:49] church and lord what do you want to tell
[1:21:50] me what have i missed
[1:21:52] has there been any commandments i've
[1:21:53] neglected give me your commandments that
[1:21:55] i can walk in them
[1:21:57] and that will cause great rejoicing amen
[1:22:00] it will but see it stems from first
[1:22:03] having the commandment
[1:22:04] the word of the lord thus saith the lord
[1:22:07] the word of god
[1:22:08] receiving it walking in it and rejoicing
[1:22:12] greatly
[1:22:13] praise god like recently i was talking
[1:22:16] to brother craig
[1:22:17] uh on an email and he's like or just
[1:22:20] whoever it is you know we haven't talked
[1:22:21] we haven't seen each other for years uh
[1:22:24] but just
[1:22:25] even brother brooks the other day we
[1:22:27] were talking about that just how uh
[1:22:30] they hear about our ministry right they
[1:22:32] hear about our lives and
[1:22:34] and they they say good things right and
[1:22:37] that's such an encouragement like
[1:22:38] uh that's what i want to do because many
[1:22:40] times how many ever you feel alone
[1:22:42] sometimes anybody ever feel alone
[1:22:43] sometimes
[1:22:44] you know satan tries to isolate us and
[1:22:46] get alone but even in those times that
[1:22:48] we're alone we're really not alone
[1:22:50] because jesus is with us praise god so
[1:22:53] when those
[1:22:53] like we sing that song in those lonely
[1:22:55] hours if we can learn to rejoice in
[1:22:57] those hours and thank god for those
[1:22:58] hours and talk to god in those hours
[1:23:01] it'll keep us faithful praise god keep
[1:23:03] us
[1:23:04] joyful about what god's called us to do
[1:23:06] and then people will hear about our
[1:23:08] testimonies
[1:23:10] praise god it's in those lonely hours
[1:23:16] where we've got to receive the
[1:23:17] commandment walk in the commandment
[1:23:22] so he had great rejoicing that he found
[1:23:25] them
[1:23:26] i love to find my children obeying god's
[1:23:28] word i sure do
[1:23:30] i know you do i know moms do too right
[1:23:32] i'd love to catch him obey in the word
[1:23:34] of god
[1:23:35] that's what that's what john felt here

[1:28:48] given the commandment
[1:28:50] praise god i'm gonna do it my time okay

[1:29:17] greater joy than to see a faithful
[1:29:19] group of people they're my beloved right
[1:29:21] that know the truth they've received the
[1:29:23] commandment
[1:29:24] and they walk in the commandment they
[1:29:25] obey the commandment no greater joy than
[1:29:27] that
[1:29:30] sometimes yeah i'm always reminded but
[1:29:31] the desperate bride tells me
[1:29:33] he pastored for a number of years then
[1:29:34] god you know led him to give the church
[1:29:36] back up and he's not pastor but his
[1:29:38] famous his favorite saying he ever gave
[1:29:39] me brother bank
[1:29:40] was he said i've learned as a pastor
[1:29:43] that i don't get excited about
[1:29:44] uh like when uh when uh he said i don't
[1:29:47] get excited about uh
[1:29:49] um big crowds he said i get excited
[1:29:52] about the people that come back
[1:29:53] faithfully
[1:29:54] every service amen
[1:29:57] i thought man that blew my mind like
[1:29:59] forgive me jesus
[1:30:01] right because we want to see growth and
[1:30:03] we want to see all these things but he
[1:30:04] said i've learned
[1:30:06] i don't know what a word of wisdom that
[1:30:07] was yes
[1:30:09] i've learned to rejoice when i see
[1:30:11] people faithful
[1:30:12] right because there's no greater joy
[1:30:15] than the scene
[1:30:16] one life transformed truly transformed
[1:30:18] to christ
[1:30:20] and just think about that getting daily
[1:30:22] victory
[1:30:23] you can depend on them they're going to
[1:30:25] get the victory they're going to come to
[1:30:26] the house of god and pray
[1:30:28] and sing and support the church because
[1:30:30] they're daily conquering through christ
[1:30:32] jesus amen
[1:30:33] they look into victory not just once in
[1:30:35] a while victorious but every day
[1:30:37] victorious praise god
[1:30:39] christ is living through them constantly
[1:30:42] these are my favorites they're my
[1:30:45] favorites too praise god
[1:30:48] those that faithfully serve jesus christ
[1:30:52] my fear and beloved
[1:30:55] thank you jesus praise god
[1:30:59] see when others testify about you that's
[1:31:01] when you know
[1:31:02] but i should say that's an encouragement
[1:31:04] to know
[1:31:05] that god is working through my life
[1:31:09] and take it not as a private way but
[1:31:10] take it as a just an encouragement
[1:31:12] right that oh my must be
[1:31:16] i must be on the right path i must be on
[1:31:18] the perfect will of god
[1:31:19] if people are testifying that i'm
[1:31:22] walking in the truth
[1:31:24] that i'm being faithful to the things of
[1:31:26] god
[1:31:28] then i have no greater joy than that
[1:31:29] praise god that i walk in the truth and
[1:31:32] i obey the commands
[1:31:35] so i'm still that just you know i'm
[1:31:36] still at 47 minutes hard to believe
[1:31:38] right hardly
[1:31:40] now let's look at the crowd real quick i
[1:31:43] think i can get a few
[1:31:44] maybe one or two more scriptures here
[1:31:48] now he said let me turn back to
[1:31:49] philippians here i want to get this idea
[1:31:52] on crowd
[1:31:55] thank you for your patience therefore my
[1:31:57] brethren dearly beloved and longed for
[1:32:00] you we didn't even look at the long four
[1:32:02] part right we didn't even look for that
[1:32:03] this is how you long to be with them
[1:32:06] i can't wait to see all of you on
[1:32:08] wednesdays and sundays i can't wait to
[1:32:09] see you
[1:32:11] think how sad would be if it was just my
[1:32:13] family and i you know
[1:32:15] we'd be happy to have our family but we
[1:32:17] just can't wait to see
[1:32:18] god's people in the house of god
[1:32:22] you long to be together in the house of
[1:32:24] god to sing god's praise to worship him
[1:32:26] to honor him
[1:32:27] to learn from him from his word
[1:32:33] look at the scripture says but we
[1:32:34] brother being taken from you for a short
[1:32:37] time in presence
[1:32:38] not in heart so you can you you know
[1:32:41] when someone really loves you
[1:32:43] someone really loves you when you feel
[1:32:45] like they're with you all the time
[1:32:47] that's what paul was saying i'm not
[1:32:49] there but it's like i'm there
[1:32:50] right he says i'm present but he said
[1:32:54] he said i left you for a short time
[1:32:56] presence but not in heart in other words
[1:32:58] my heart is always with you i'm always
[1:32:59] praying for you i'm always thinking
[1:33:01] about you
[1:33:03] that's what he said endeavor the more
[1:33:05] abundantly to see your face with great
[1:33:07] desire i just can't wait to get there
[1:33:09] can't wait to see god's people can't
[1:33:11] wait to see the faces of the saints
[1:33:13] wherefore we would have come to you unto
[1:33:16] you even i
[1:33:17] paul once and again but satan hit us now
[1:33:19] look at this paul's admitting
[1:33:21] there's times that missionaries want to
[1:33:23] do work but then satan hinders them
[1:33:25] right there's times you and i want to do
[1:33:27] something good but satan
[1:33:28] hinders us did paul quit what do you
[1:33:31] think de paul do you think paul quit and
[1:33:32] gave up
[1:33:33] missionary work no he probably said
[1:33:35] we'll just put another
[1:33:36] put another round of ammunition there
[1:33:38] fire it again one of these times is
[1:33:39] going to go off praise god
[1:33:41] my brother i'm saying taking sides with
[1:33:42] jesus right he said i don't know what
[1:33:44] i'm doing right now so i'm just putting
[1:33:45] more ammo in and pulling the lever
[1:33:47] and he said one of these times it's
[1:33:49] going to go off praise god
[1:33:51] see there's going to be times satan
[1:33:53] hinders us satan even hindered the
[1:33:55] prophet of god right
[1:33:56] he hindered paul he hindered
[1:33:59] some of his brother rams trips but he
[1:34:01] didn't give up he kept resting on he
[1:34:03] kept obeying the truth he kept being
[1:34:05] faithful and god honors the faithful
[1:34:16] he said wherefore we would have come
[1:34:18] unto you once again the satanist
[1:34:20] for what is our hope our joy or crown
[1:34:24] of rejoicing so a crown
[1:34:28] here is not like well
[1:34:31] i'm a ruler like we talk we we often
[1:34:32] talk about kings and priests which you
[1:34:34] are
[1:34:36] you're ruling over brother man says lust
[1:34:39] the devil hell sin and the world
[1:34:42] you are supposed to be kings over all
[1:34:44] that and you
[1:34:46] are if you're filled with the spirit of
[1:34:47] god or if you're overcoming in
[1:34:49] sanctification
[1:34:50] right you're starting to get victory
[1:34:51] over that
[1:34:54] but this is not the crown he's talking
[1:34:56] about he's about the crown
[1:34:58] of rejoicing okay
[1:35:02] so he's talking about what is our hope
[1:35:04] our joy our crowd
[1:35:06] are not even ye in the presence of our
[1:35:09] lord jesus christ at his coming
[1:35:11] for ye are our glory
[1:35:14] and joy
[1:35:17] so he's talking about the presence of
[1:35:19] jesus christ coming look at verse 19
[1:35:21] you are our crown in the presence of the
[1:35:24] lord jesus christ
[1:35:26] so paul says when we get to the meeting
[1:35:28] in the air praise god
[1:35:30] he said you are my crown of rejoicing
[1:35:34] so paul is going to be rejoicing oh the
[1:35:37] saints at philippi they made it they
[1:35:39] overcame
[1:35:40] they made the rapture praise god they
[1:35:42] made the first resurrection amen
[1:35:44] and that rejoicing and paul's heart will
[1:35:46] be a crown
[1:35:48] of uh authority on his head praise god
[1:35:52] it'll be his it's his crown of rejoicing
[1:35:55] in other words
[1:35:56] that that's the that's the rejoicing
[1:35:58] that that god
[1:35:59] vindicated his ministry that his
[1:36:01] ministry fulfilled its purpose praise
[1:36:03] god
[1:36:03] that the saints that he preached you
[1:36:05] received it believe it
[1:36:07] and let the gospel work through their
[1:36:09] lives amen
[1:36:11] it's a crown of rejoicing in the
[1:36:14] presence of jesus christ
[1:36:16] how do we think brother abraham is going
[1:36:17] to be shouting with rejoicing with the
[1:36:19] crown of rejoicing
[1:36:21] right when he presents the bride right
[1:36:24] to jesus
[1:36:26] that's what he's talking about he said
[1:36:28] you people are my crown
[1:36:29] of rejoicing because you've received the
[1:36:32] gospel
[1:36:34] at the presence of jesus christ that's
[1:36:36] gotta be his rapture coming
[1:36:38] it has to be his rapture coming
[1:36:43] for ye are glory and joy so what did
[1:36:45] paul get the most
[1:36:46] joy out of life seeing people obey the
[1:36:50] message of the hour
[1:36:52] are you with me there was no greater joy
[1:36:55] than to see the word preached and the
[1:36:57] word he taught he labored
[1:36:59] and taught him the full counsel of god
[1:37:01] there was not nothing
[1:37:02] made him happier and he said nothing
[1:37:04] will make me as happy
[1:37:06] as knowing that the people received it
[1:37:08] and then we all meet jesus who's the
[1:37:10] author of all of it at the rapture
[1:37:12] praise god
[1:37:14] there's no greater joy than that there's
[1:37:16] no greater reason to shout or praise god
[1:37:19] or
[1:37:19] than to see people that really love it
[1:37:22] and really want to live it for his glory
[1:37:24] praise god
[1:37:27] give me a few more minutes give me seven
[1:37:28] more minutes that's my hour okay give me
[1:37:30] some more minutes
[1:37:32] now verse one he says
[1:37:35] so this just i can't get through verse
[1:37:36] one hardly today therefore my brother
[1:37:38] dearly beloved long for my joy
[1:37:40] and my crown see people should make you
[1:37:43] happy
[1:37:44] not things people
[1:37:47] make us happy
[1:37:51] our crown is a crown of rejoicing
[1:37:55] god validates our life as we see our
[1:37:57] life's efforts are not in vain
[1:37:59] and people receive it and live it and
[1:38:01] accept it to praise god
[1:38:03] and meet us in the air with jesus he
[1:38:06] said so stand fast in the lord
[1:38:09] my dearly beloved so he says it twice he
[1:38:11] starts with dearly beloved and he ends
[1:38:13] with dearly beloved
[1:38:15] oh my favorites in other words therefore
[1:38:17] my favorites
[1:38:18] and long for my joint crown so stand
[1:38:20] fast in the lord my favorites
[1:38:22] you know why god repeats things so you
[1:38:24] don't miss it right jesus
[1:38:26] barely barely right verily verily i say
[1:38:30] unto you
[1:38:30] he's repeating it for emphasis and he's
[1:38:33] repeating my favorites
[1:38:35] you're my joy my crown stand fast my
[1:38:37] favorites
[1:38:39] right he's trying to emphasize that a
[1:38:42] double emphasis
[1:38:44] that you are god's chosen because you
[1:38:48] receive his word
[1:38:52] you have to do something for eternal
[1:38:53] life right you have to do something or
[1:38:55] else everybody's gonna be saved
[1:38:57] you have to do something it's surrender
[1:39:00] it's repent right
[1:39:01] the gospel john the baptist came
[1:39:03] preaching the gospel repent
[1:39:04] for the kingdom of god is at hand jesus
[1:39:06] repented or preached says
[1:39:08] repent the kingdom of god is near amen
[1:39:11] amen
[1:39:12] repent surrender your choices surrender
[1:39:15] your
[1:39:16] your free will and accept god's will and
[1:39:19] do god's will the mystery of god's will
[1:39:23] so stand fast in the lord he said
[1:39:26] so stand fast in the lord my favorite
[1:39:30] my esteem so stand fast in the greek
[1:39:32] means to stand firm to persevere
[1:39:35] to persist to keep one standing well
[1:39:38] that means someone's trying to get you
[1:39:39] to fall
[1:39:41] right someone's trying to get you to
[1:39:44] fall
[1:39:45] someone's trying to get you to not walk
[1:39:47] in the truth and bow down to a lie
[1:39:50] right he said stan he said didn't say
[1:39:51] bow down tell these people bowing all
[1:39:53] these democrats well republicans are
[1:39:55] about the same thing right
[1:39:56] most of them right they're bowing down
[1:39:59] to these organizations and bowing down
[1:40:01] paul said stand praise god stand
[1:40:05] for the gospel stand for truth
[1:40:07] hallelujah
[1:40:08] stand for it be firm persistent
[1:40:14] live for it be an example for it
[1:40:19] persevere that means you have to fight
[1:40:24] i'm so happy i'm so happy i love you
[1:40:25] you're my joy you're my joy i don't i'm
[1:40:27] never happier than you thinking about
[1:40:28] you guys
[1:40:29] now stand keep it up praise god stand
[1:40:33] persist in the message of god in the
[1:40:36] message of the hour
[1:40:38] now this reminds us of ephesians 6. he
[1:40:41] said you're
[1:40:41] you're battling all spiritual
[1:40:43] principalities and powers
[1:40:46] right you're battling a wickedness in
[1:40:47] high places you're battling demon powers
[1:40:50] all the time trying to get into your
[1:40:51] mind right
[1:40:52] trying to get you to tap the wrong thing
[1:40:54] right try to get you to
[1:40:55] say the wrong thing at the water cooler
[1:40:59] trying to get you to think the wrong
[1:41:01] thing and eat the wrong thing right all
[1:41:03] kinds
[1:41:04] all kinds of they're trying to destroy
[1:41:06] us fully right those demon powers
[1:41:08] but paul said put on the armor of god
[1:41:10] the whole thing praise god
[1:41:12] amen believe all the word amen
[1:41:15] put on all the word of god that you can
[1:41:18] stand and he said
[1:41:19] having done all to stand
[1:41:22] it's about doing what we've been told
[1:41:24] praise god
[1:41:26] it's about doing we're not bowing we're
[1:41:28] standing because we're doing
[1:41:30] what paul tells us to do to take a firm
[1:41:33] stance on it to stand there
[1:41:36] having done all do everything in your
[1:41:38] power remember
[1:41:39] diligently obey the word of god
[1:41:42] faithfully obey the word of god
[1:41:44] do all that you can to stand against the
[1:41:46] wickedness in this hour
[1:41:48] hallelujah
[1:41:52] let me go to verse two i'll have to stop
[1:41:55] after that
[1:42:01] yeah this is this was one of the most
[1:42:03] striking verses
[1:42:04] when i first started studying this
[1:42:06] remember church
[1:42:08] this church yeah i got here
[1:42:12] paul's closing this letter and he now
[1:42:16] just breaks into an individual problem
[1:42:18] of the church
[1:42:20] he says unity between two sisters was
[1:42:23] one problem in their church and remember
[1:42:24] this is a church that started
[1:42:26] through a purple selling uh sister who
[1:42:29] had a lot of income she's a pretty rich
[1:42:31] lady
[1:42:33] see god saves the poor and the rich
[1:42:34] praise god
[1:42:36] and a prison earthquake this is a church
[1:42:39] that started with
[1:42:39] this rich woman lydia and then
[1:42:43] a prison earthquake a philippian jailer
[1:42:46] these were some of the founding members
[1:42:47] of the church
[1:42:49] you see and he's finishing the letter he
[1:42:51] says i beseech
[1:42:53] yodius and beseech syntacky
[1:42:57] that they'd be of the same mind in the
[1:43:00] lord
[1:43:02] oh you mean he's not he's not telling
[1:43:04] them uh to pray
[1:43:05] for more prisons to be shaken down with
[1:43:08] earthquakes
[1:43:10] he's not doing that
[1:43:13] now you could have right you could have
[1:43:15] said pray for miracles
[1:43:17] i'll tell you this would be a real
[1:43:18] miracle too to have sisters and one
[1:43:19] according to the church
[1:43:21] and brothers and the brothers said not
[1:43:24] just sisters i'm not preaching all the
[1:43:26] sisters
[1:43:26] i preach on all of us praise god but in
[1:43:29] this case
[1:43:30] the church that started with these
[1:43:32] mighty miracles
[1:43:34] and a rich woman and the miracles in the
[1:43:37] he said before i finish this
[1:43:39] uh i beseech now that means beg
[1:43:44] i beg i beg you
[1:43:47] and i beg synthetic that they be of the
[1:43:50] same mind in the lord so it shows
[1:43:53] they had different thinking they didn't
[1:43:56] both
[1:43:57] obey the holy spirit they had different
[1:44:00] thoughts about the things of god
[1:44:02] and he calls them out by name don't be
[1:44:06] discouraged if your name ever gets
[1:44:07] called out
[1:44:08] i was on the receiving end this week one
[1:44:11] of the brothers i debated made a whole
[1:44:12] hour
[1:44:13] 13-minute video about me and how i'm
[1:44:15] dishonest
[1:44:16] i wrote back and said i think you
[1:44:18] misunderstood me
[1:44:20] i'll write back later when i got time to
[1:44:22] deal with it
[1:44:24] love you and god bless you that's the
[1:44:26] first video i've had made about me
[1:44:30] wasn't the best one i think it's a
[1:44:32] misunderstanding
[1:44:35] but look he's saying there's two sisters
[1:44:37] in your church
[1:44:39] this church started supernaturally they
[1:44:41] started supernaturally but they got
[1:44:43] common problems anyone know what that's
[1:44:46] like
[1:44:47] you see supernatural miracles in your
[1:44:49] life but you got pretty simple
[1:44:51] common problems anybody anybody know
[1:44:53] what i'm talking about
[1:44:56] there's my hour a church so
[1:45:00] supernatural in its origin as paul
[1:45:02] finishes the letter
[1:45:03] as far as we know this is the last time
[1:45:05] he communicated with them as far as we
[1:45:06] know
[1:45:08] one of the things he brings up is can we
[1:45:09] get these two sisters
[1:45:11] to think the same way about god's word
[1:45:19] now look uh the writer says he avoids
[1:45:22] favoritism because he says beseech
[1:45:23] before both of them
[1:45:26] right so someone so he knew they might
[1:45:28] have mind battles
[1:45:29] you know those sisters that would have
[1:45:30] my battle so he says i beg eudius and i
[1:45:33] beg synthetic i'm begging both of them
[1:45:35] see there was wrongs on both sides
[1:45:38] right i'm begging both of you sisters
[1:45:42] can you be in the same mind of the lord
[1:45:46] can we start thinking the same way
[1:45:50] instead of conflict and butting heads
[1:45:52] and butting heads and butting heads
[1:45:54] can we just live in peace
[1:45:58] uh who thinks this was the holy ghost
[1:45:59] filled church
[1:46:02] you only go spill people sometimes butt
[1:46:04] heads for the day
[1:46:06] yeah sure did oh a prophet wouldn't
[1:46:10] worry about you know just some sister's
[1:46:11] problems in the church you know a
[1:46:12] prophet a real prophet would
[1:46:15] because he knows a little lesson leavens
[1:46:18] the whole church
[1:46:20] it's important to be able to look each
[1:46:21] brother in the eye shake their hand and
[1:46:23] say i love you in the lord it's
[1:46:24] important
[1:46:25] it's a board member look that sister and
[1:46:26] i say love you the lord
[1:46:28] god bless you but these sisters they
[1:46:31] didn't have the same mind
[1:46:34] instead of instead of being in unity
[1:46:36] they were in
[1:46:38] battle
[1:46:42] remember this is the letter of the mind
[1:46:43] remember it's the letter of love
[1:46:45] joy ten times
[1:46:51] paul mentions the mind ten times
[1:46:56] mind the same thing sit think the same
[1:46:58] thing
[1:47:03] ten times it's so important church what
[1:47:05] we feed our minds
[1:47:07] praise god what we think about
[1:47:12] so important how we think about conflict
[1:47:15] i'm not going to get to the coach and
[1:47:16] brother brahma said
[1:47:17] he said he didn't you know in 1959 he
[1:47:19] didn't want to build
[1:47:20] he didn't want to add on to the
[1:47:21] tabernacle he said but the rest of the
[1:47:22] church did
[1:47:23] so he said i threw my idea out of it and
[1:47:25] let's go ahead and build the church
[1:47:27] or renovate it you know they just go on
[1:47:31] a new section of the ground tabernacle
[1:47:33] and this is one of the scriptures he
[1:47:34] quotes about uh
[1:47:37] whatever's pure think on those things
[1:47:38] right whatever's holy he talks about
[1:47:40] unity of the mind
[1:47:46] i think there's times all of us need to
[1:47:48] throw some of our ideas out
[1:47:52] and the church said i think all of us
[1:47:56] sometimes are so
[1:47:57] we all can have our own opinions we're
[1:47:59] so opinionated
[1:48:03] we can be so dogmatic
[1:48:06] that sometimes god will use it to show
[1:48:08] us how prideful we can be at times
[1:48:13] and we all have to learn that sometimes
[1:48:15] our opinions aren't always right
[1:48:18] and god can work opposite of our
[1:48:21] opinions
[1:48:21] on how the church should go is that true
[1:48:25] god did the opposite of what brother
[1:48:26] branham wanted right he allowed him to
[1:48:28] renovate and then he
[1:48:29] and then in 1963 god hiding himself in
[1:48:31] simplicity
[1:48:32] he says oh the tabernacle looks so
[1:48:34] beautiful you remember that
[1:48:36] listen to that if you haven't listened
[1:48:37] to that lately he just praises the
[1:48:39] brothers and how they've added on in
[1:48:40] such a beautiful
[1:48:41] but he was dead set against it but he
[1:48:45] he was able to he said sacrifice my
[1:48:48] opinion
[1:48:49] for the good of the church so we can be
[1:48:51] in one mind
[1:48:55] let me just finish that thought
[1:49:02] well let me finish with that
[1:49:05] i actually was going into the
[1:49:06] friendliness part let me finish that now
[1:49:08] one thing that draws me here is you all
[1:49:10] now he's back in
[1:49:10] jeffersonville that's right you know
[1:49:13] lots of friends i'm so i'm grateful
[1:49:15] if i just counted especially people i
[1:49:16] know maybe a million around the world
[1:49:18] it was once estimated by some probably a
[1:49:20] personal knowing
[1:49:21] of about 10 million people but there's
[1:49:23] something about home about
[1:49:24] certain people everybody's got that
[1:49:27] there's special
[1:49:28] people in your life
[1:49:31] right he's met millions of people but he
[1:49:33] said there's special people in your life
[1:49:35] that's why it's okay to have favorites
[1:49:38] as long as you would do
[1:49:40] as long as you the way you treat them
[1:49:41] you'd be happy to treat
[1:49:43] the others who aren't your favorites
[1:49:44] with that much love too
[1:49:46] help them out
[1:49:49] you know i believe that if there isn't
[1:49:50] then why is our wife special to us that
[1:49:52] he uses a common example
[1:49:54] your white in other words brothers your
[1:49:55] wife should be your favorite person
[1:49:57] right
[1:49:57] right brothers i thought i'd hear some
[1:49:59] more amens on that one
[1:50:01] just kidding
[1:50:07] it's okay to have special friends just
[1:50:09] get it it's okay to have best friends
[1:50:13] you know i believe that see our wives
[1:50:16] our husbands
[1:50:17] it's special and you have had they have
[1:50:18] that with friends there's something
[1:50:20] other that you just love to meet with
[1:50:21] them and just talk with them
[1:50:23] there's little spots would you have
[1:50:25] around someone you just love to be
[1:50:27] around
[1:50:29] you got those people what is it it's
[1:50:30] because of their atmosphere
[1:50:32] that they create
[1:50:36] around them so if you want to be
[1:50:39] friendly
[1:50:40] if you want to have best friends if you
[1:50:42] want to have people
[1:50:44] if you want to be somebody's favorite
[1:50:45] create that atmosphere
[1:50:48] right create love
[1:50:51] create care and concern
[1:50:55] show the love of jesus christ praise god
[1:50:58] create it because you can do it you can
[1:51:01] create it
[1:51:03] remember paul says these are the people
[1:51:05] you're supposed to love the most
[1:51:06] your best friends should be around here
[1:51:09] at least some of them not maybe not all
[1:51:11] of them but your best friend should be
[1:51:12] your local some people in your local
[1:51:14] church
[1:51:14] because you're with them all the time
[1:51:18] he says you've been in nice people but
[1:51:21] yet you couldn't stand to be around them
[1:51:22] it's their atmosphere
[1:51:24] look at that the man said sometimes
[1:51:26] they're nice people but it's hard to be
[1:51:28] around them
[1:51:30] it's their atmosphere it's love so in
[1:51:32] other words some people don't
[1:51:34] create love they create criticism
[1:51:38] they create quarrels but
[1:51:42] some people create love and you just
[1:51:43] love to be around them
[1:51:46] and it's okay if they're your favorites
[1:51:47] okay everybody's got special people
[1:51:51] he says love goes out deep it does great
[1:51:53] things and jesus christ
[1:51:55] is the love of god let's stand to our
[1:51:56] feet i'll stop right there
[1:51:58] the bible said a man that hath friends
[1:52:00] must show himself
[1:52:02] friendly and there's a friend that
[1:52:04] sticketh closer to the brother
[1:52:06] that's our lord jesus christ musicians
