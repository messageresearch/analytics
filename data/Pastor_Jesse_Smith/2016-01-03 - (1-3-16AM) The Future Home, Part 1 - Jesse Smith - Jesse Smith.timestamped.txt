[1:07:01] it's how uh we're recognized as the
[1:07:03] government is how we run uh this this to
[1:07:06] them it's a business but to us it's the
[1:07:07] Church of the Living God but you have to
[1:07:10] have some form of written bylaw so I
[1:07:12] spent a few more hours working on that
[1:07:13] this week and try to shorten it a little
[1:07:15] bit and took some advice uh some nice
[1:07:18] advice from Brother Jean and Sister Amy
[1:07:20] had a good question in there so I try to
[1:07:21] answer that in the bylaws and appreciate
[1:07:23] the people who over that and then John
[1:07:25] bang and I will vote on that because the
[1:07:27] we're the board of directors what a tiny
[1:07:28] little board of directors we are but uh
[1:07:31] we we're the ones recognized by the
[1:07:32] state we have to vote on that uh after

[1:08:03] appreciate the prayers of the Saints and
[1:08:04] thanks for our sister doing that thanks
[1:08:06] sister for putting that together by the
[1:08:07] grace of the Lord so be sure to look at
[1:08:09] that here by the grace of the Lord okay
[1:08:12] I believe that's it we're trying to
[1:08:14] preserve time this morning and uh get
[1:08:16] right to the word of God so if we can
[1:08:18] stand here let's open up to Revelation
[1:08:20] chapter 21 by the grace of the
[1:08:22] Lord brother bang I have a slideshow
[1:08:25] whenever uh ready with some quotes a lot
[1:08:28] of quotes like I said there's over 300
[1:08:29] but I won't get to all those
[1:08:36] today so Revelation chapter 21 uh I sent
[1:08:39] an email out about that a few days ago
[1:08:40] as well if you wanted to read the future
[1:08:42] home or listen to it kind of prepare
[1:08:44] your heart so I did was I went uh
[1:08:46] paragraph by paragraph through this
[1:08:48] entire
[1:08:49] message uh and then searched all the
[1:08:52] times the prophet said New Jerusalem
[1:08:55] future home uh new
[1:08:58] city things like that after he preached
[1:09:00] it to see what else the Lord had him add
[1:09:03] to it so I feel like we got a a good
[1:09:06] teaching on it by the grace of
[1:09:09] God Revelation 21
[1:09:13] verse1 if you're there say
[1:09:16] amen and I saw a new Heaven and a new
[1:09:18] Earth for the first Heaven and the first
[1:09:21] Earth were passed away and there was no
[1:09:24] more sea and I John saw the holy city
[1:09:28] New Jerusalem coming down from God out
[1:09:30] of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned
[1:09:34] for her
[1:09:35] husband now we're going to stop right
[1:09:37] there we know the whole chapters about
[1:09:38] this we'll be getting to that uh this
[1:09:40] morning and evening service but let's go
[1:09:42] to Second Peter chapter 3 these are the
[1:09:44] prophet's texts that he used here uh to
[1:09:46] preach it himself brother Bram said this
[1:09:49] is an important subject so how many feel
[1:09:51] like it's
[1:09:52] important it's a very important subject
[1:09:55] it's your
[1:09:56] home second Peter chapter
[1:10:02] 3
[1:10:04] now we want to just start at verse five
[1:10:08] because just a conserve time this is a
[1:10:10] really long message if you know this
[1:10:12] message brother B it was a three-h hour
[1:10:13] and 40 minute message now the last 40
[1:10:15] minutes was a prayer line uh so but it's
[1:10:19] a quite a lengthy message verse five for
[1:10:22] this they willing are ignorant of that
[1:10:25] by the word of God the heavens were of
[1:10:27] old and the Earth standing out of the
[1:10:29] water and in the water so what the world
[1:10:33] calls laws of nature the Bible calls the
[1:10:34] word of God the laws of nature hold
[1:10:37] everything in place that's what science
[1:10:38] calls it uh but we call it the word of
[1:10:41] God verse six whereby the world that
[1:10:44] then was being overflowed with water
[1:10:48] perished and notice there's three worlds
[1:10:50] in here but the heavens and the Earth
[1:10:53] which are now by the same word are kept
[1:10:55] in store reserved unto fire against the
[1:10:58] day of judgment and predition of ungodly
[1:11:00] men but beloved be not ignorant of this
[1:11:03] one thing that one day is with the Lord
[1:11:05] as a thousand years and a thousand years
[1:11:09] as one day now let's get down to verse
[1:11:11] 10 but the day of the Lord will come as
[1:11:14] a thief in the night remember we
[1:11:15] mentioned that on Thursday night's
[1:11:16] message in which the heaven shall pass
[1:11:19] away with a great noise and the elements
[1:11:21] shall melt with fervent Heat
[1:11:24] the Earth also and the works that are
[1:11:26] therein shall be burned up seeing then
[1:11:28] that all these things shall be dissolved
[1:11:30] what manner of persons ought ye to be in
[1:11:32] all holy conversation and godliness
[1:11:35] looking for and hting unto the coming of
[1:11:37] the day of God where in the heavens
[1:11:39] being on fire shall be dissolved and the
[1:11:41] elements shall melt with fervent heat
[1:11:44] nevertheless we according to his promise
[1:11:46] look for new heavens and a new Earth
[1:11:48] wherein dwelleth righteousness praise
[1:11:51] God let's have one more word of prayer
[1:11:53] have a need on your heart Hearts make it
[1:11:54] known to God Heavenly Father you see the
[1:11:55] people's hearts bless this reading of
[1:11:57] Thy word open it to us so we can
[1:11:59] understand it Lord we thank you for your
[1:12:00] mercy in Jesus Christ's name the church
[1:12:02] said amen God bless you being SE there
[1:12:04] praise the Lord let's look this morning
[1:12:07] here uh if we can let's look at the New
[1:12:11] Jerusalem our future home sorry let get
[1:12:13] a little overlap there uh so we want to
[1:12:16] look at this by the grace of the Lord
[1:12:18] and uh see that the New Jerusalem is our
[1:12:20] future home it's a pyramid city which
[1:12:23] most of us are aware of um but if not
[1:12:26] then we'll just show it right through
[1:12:27] the scripture and so forth uh by the
[1:12:30] grace of the
[1:12:31] Lord praise God now the first slide I'm
[1:12:33] going to skip past I just had my notes I
[1:12:35] kind of keep little things I like to add
[1:12:37] at the beginning of the messages there
[1:12:38] so I'm G to skip past that we read our
[1:12:40] text and the brother R said the future
[1:12:42] home is an important subject of a very
[1:12:44] important subject to me it's a very
[1:12:45] blessful one hope it strikes you the
[1:12:48] same way I can only give an inspiration
[1:12:50] I received and I was speaking this
[1:12:51] morning on the future home with the
[1:12:53] Heavenly bridegroom and Earthly bride
[1:12:55] where they're going to live brother Ram
[1:12:59] said he just preached the highlights of
[1:13:00] this message he said it would take weeks
[1:13:03] to preach the whole thing but I've wrote
[1:13:05] down some scriptures some notes just to
[1:13:07] hit the highlights of it to where it'll
[1:13:09] let you study and it really helped me
[1:13:11] study to hit the highlights of this just
[1:13:13] his highlights uh brother BR said this
[1:13:15] he feasted on this message for weeks
[1:13:18] afterwards you ever had a message like
[1:13:20] that it just so strikes you that you
[1:13:21] just can't get over it you just want to
[1:13:23] dwell and regurgitate it and feed on it
[1:13:25] and listen to it again and again butam
[1:13:28] tells us in proving his word last Sunday
[1:13:30] week ago I spoke on the subject the
[1:13:31] future home in the bridegroom I've been
[1:13:33] feasting on that ever since knowing that
[1:13:35] when this life is over I'm going to that
[1:13:38] City I'm Bound for that City Nothing
[1:13:40] Else Matters what if the sun doesn't
[1:13:42] shine today or tomorrow never comes what
[1:13:44] difference does it make we got a home a
[1:13:47] resting place tired or not tired we
[1:13:49] still have that resting place you say
[1:13:51] that's an old man's dream no it isn't
[1:13:53] it's isn't it's the Bible
[1:13:56] truth brother says in question and
[1:13:58] answers by the way I got so many letters
[1:13:59] on my message two three Sundays ago on
[1:14:01] the future home that sure hit home
[1:14:03] somewhere there's a lot of them it did
[1:14:06] me too I've never got over it
[1:14:09] yet amen let's begin teaching there like
[1:14:12] I said we have quite a bit to get
[1:14:13] through I'm going to be reading a lot of
[1:14:14] quotations and uh scriptures I try to
[1:14:16] put most of the scriptures up here
[1:14:18] because I knew I kind of had to go fast
[1:14:20] through it but uh did anybody get a
[1:14:22] chance to listen to it well I shouldn't
[1:14:23] ask said but sorry I don't want to
[1:14:24] embarrass anybody that didn't but
[1:14:26] hopefully somebody got a chance to
[1:14:27] listen to it it'll be nice and fresh on
[1:14:29] your mind if not then afterwards maybe
[1:14:31] this week you want to listen to it it's
[1:14:32] such a blessing uh bring a real Spirit
[1:14:35] of Love in Your Heart uh now brother bam
[1:14:38] reads two texts he read Revelation 21
[1:14:41] and second Peter chapter 3 brother Ram
[1:14:43] said John told us about the new Earth he
[1:14:45] told us all the details about it but he
[1:14:47] said Peter explained how we get it which
[1:14:50] is Through Fire okay here he says it
[1:14:54] right here see he doesn't he said John
[1:14:57] doesn't explain it Peter does John just
[1:14:59] said I saw new heavens and new earth
[1:15:01] first was passed away there's no more se
[1:15:04] but we turn back to Second Peter now
[1:15:07] Peter explains how this process comes
[1:15:10] about so Peter explains the process John
[1:15:14] tells what the effect of the process was
[1:15:17] amen kind like a cause and effect praise
[1:15:19] God now if you notice in the text there
[1:15:22] are three different worlds describe the
[1:15:25] past condition of the world the present
[1:15:28] condition of the world and the future
[1:15:30] condition of the world but it's the same
[1:15:31] world it's the same Earth okay so here
[1:15:34] it is we're read read this for our text
[1:15:36] the Earth standing out of the water and
[1:15:38] in the water that was the world that
[1:15:41] then was so in the days of Noah that
[1:15:44] world that was covered by water that was
[1:15:46] the previous condition of the earth he
[1:15:48] said now verse seven but the heavens and
[1:15:51] the Earth which are now by the same word
[1:15:54] are kept in store so now we have a
[1:15:55] different condition of the same Earth
[1:15:58] praise God and now we have a third
[1:16:00] condition of the earth nevertheless we
[1:16:02] according to his promise look for new
[1:16:04] heavens and a new Earth so brother Bram
[1:16:07] lays this out he refers to three stages
[1:16:10] of the
[1:16:11] earth okay brother says that one that
[1:16:13] now is and the one to come the old world
[1:16:16] stood out for the water Genesis 1:1 and
[1:16:19] now the world that is now present and
[1:16:21] then again he refers to another one
[1:16:23] three worlds three stages of the world
[1:16:25] now not three planets one planet in
[1:16:28] three
[1:16:29] stages okay you have to get this or else
[1:16:32] brother said you'll be all confused now
[1:16:34] brother said the Earth is redeemed in
[1:16:36] three stages just like
[1:16:38] men notice how God makes plain to us his
[1:16:41] Plan of
[1:16:42] Redemption what God has done to redeem
[1:16:45] the world he's done the same plan to
[1:16:47] redeem his people for the unchangeable
[1:16:50] god changes not in any of his plans or
[1:16:53] anything all right he how he led us to
[1:16:56] himself to a Tabernacle in Us by three
[1:16:59] stages of Grace now look at this just as
[1:17:01] he led the world to three stages to come
[1:17:03] to the world now look as God will come
[1:17:06] to the world after it's gone through
[1:17:07] three different stag of purification
[1:17:09] that's exactly how he comes to us
[1:17:12] through three stages of Grace I've
[1:17:14] taught that at the beginning I've never
[1:17:17] changed since it's God's word look what
[1:17:20] he says next if that wasn't a kind
[1:17:23] confirmation oh a great a great loving
[1:17:25] blessing from God when I seen this and
[1:17:28] since a boy the first time Christ ever
[1:17:31] dealt with me I've still always taught
[1:17:33] those three stages of Grace amen glory
[1:17:37] amen that's important Church you know
[1:17:39] why this was such a a a a burden to me
[1:17:42] that when we made those videos on our
[1:17:44] website three works of Grace I went back
[1:17:46] to this message we have two videos that
[1:17:48] teach the three works okay but it's just
[1:17:50] two videos part one and part two and and
[1:17:53] I taught the Sunday school last year and
[1:17:54] showed and showed these to the children
[1:17:56] the Earth is redeemed in three Works
[1:17:58] justification sanctification baptism of
[1:18:00] the fire uh Ezekiel said we had go
[1:18:03] through three Works a new heart new
[1:18:04] spirit my spirit in Ezekiel 36 Israel
[1:18:08] possessing the land had to get justified
[1:18:09] by passing the Red Sea brother brand
[1:18:11] said get Sanctified or approved in the
[1:18:13] wilderness for 40 years and then the
[1:18:15] baptism of Holy Ghost was Crossing
[1:18:16] Jordan yeah the life of Abraham brother
[1:18:19] ra said he had to be justified by
[1:18:21] getting called out from his family his
[1:18:23] sanctification was all the time up till
[1:18:25] he got the baptism of the Holy Ghost for
[1:18:27] him which was the token of circumcision
[1:18:29] brother brandom said Hallelujah the
[1:18:32] natural birth of a baby first the water
[1:18:35] breaks second is the sanctification the
[1:18:37] bloody show and the third is the baptism
[1:18:39] of the Holy Ghost In other words the
[1:18:41] spirit of the baby cries
[1:18:43] out so see it's three in
[1:18:46] everything now this is part of who this
[1:18:48] mzc so I got different color slides here
[1:18:50] so you'll notice that but brother baham
[1:18:52] said there are three stages to
[1:18:55] Perfection for everything let's say
[1:18:57] everything can we everything by
[1:18:59] everything has three stages of
[1:19:01] perfection man is perfected in three
[1:19:03] stages through justification
[1:19:05] sanctification and the baptism of the
[1:19:07] Holy Ghost brother man said the body
[1:19:10] this is what we're going to preach on
[1:19:11] next with the three bodies the body is
[1:19:14] perfected in three terrestrial that's
[1:19:16] your flesh body Celestial that's your
[1:19:19] theophany and then glorified body that's
[1:19:22] your final body
[1:19:24] Hallelujah which is not a spirit body
[1:19:25] brother man it's a perfected flesh body
[1:19:29] Hallelujah next is the Earth is
[1:19:31] perfected in three stages flood water
[1:19:34] Christ's blood sanctification and the
[1:19:37] fire which is to come to cleanse the
[1:19:39] earth now if you want to copy this just
[1:19:41] email me or something like that a baby
[1:19:44] now we already saw this the baby water
[1:19:46] blood bloody show Spirit next the brides
[1:19:50] perfected brother B says this in future
[1:19:52] home through
[1:19:53] Luther Wesley and brother Brandon's
[1:19:56] ministry that's what he says I got the
[1:19:58] quotes if you want it I know what I'm
[1:20:00] preaching this morning I done gone
[1:20:02] through this a few times here all right
[1:20:04] next we're not done brother Bram said
[1:20:07] God gives us three gifts of perfection
[1:20:09] did you know he said that he said first
[1:20:12] is Faith second is the gift of Hope
[1:20:15] brother man said the third gift is
[1:20:16] Charity amen look it up three greatest
[1:20:19] gifts look it up he said those three
[1:20:22] look at godhead the godheads perfected
[1:20:24] in three father above us son God With Us
[1:20:27] Holy Spirit in US yeah God God's
[1:20:30] perfected in threes and this is the one
[1:20:32] he brings out in the mezic he said a
[1:20:34] plant is perfected in three stages a
[1:20:36] stalk tassel grain yeah now the last two
[1:20:40] are just repeats from the previous one
[1:20:41] I'm waiting for more examples so if you
[1:20:43] guys find some good examples for me let
[1:20:44] me know I'll just add them to that right
[1:20:46] there we got five six seven we got eight
[1:20:48] right there eight obvious examples of
[1:20:50] how you got to come uh through
[1:20:52] Perfection you love the Lord amen okay
[1:20:56] praise the Lord step one justification
[1:20:58] I'm going to go uh quickly kind of
[1:21:00] through these but I want to point out a
[1:21:01] few things because we know the Earth's
[1:21:03] first step was justification by water
[1:21:06] Noah's flood was like a washing a water
[1:21:09] baptism for the
[1:21:11] earth oh yes it was brother said yeah
[1:21:14] the first step is repentance toward God
[1:21:16] repent be baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:21:19] see showing that repentance was genuine
[1:21:21] or to remit our p sins now this is
[1:21:24] important baptism just forgives our past
[1:21:27] sins that has nothing to do with your
[1:21:30] future sin because people can go through
[1:21:33] justification and then Fall Away
[1:21:37] amen remission take away of the past sin
[1:21:40] has nothing to do with the future
[1:21:42] remember the Bible said you can uh you
[1:21:45] can trotten down the spirit of Grace
[1:21:48] whereby you were already Sanctified with
[1:21:49] remember that in Hebrews Hebrews chapter
[1:21:53] 10 you can do despite the grace of God
[1:21:55] even after God Sanctified you and clean
[1:21:58] you out you can go through that and then
[1:22:00] you can go back like a pig to its
[1:22:03] water just your sin has been chopped off
[1:22:06] of what you did so when you got baptized
[1:22:08] real genuine God took his big sword of
[1:22:11] the word and cut off all your past sins
[1:22:13] glory amen because the Bible said if we
[1:22:16] say we have fellowship with him and walk
[1:22:18] in darkness we don't do the truth but if
[1:22:20] we walk in the light as he's in the
[1:22:22] light
[1:22:23] we have Fellowship one with another the
[1:22:24] blood of Jesus cleans us from all sin if
[1:22:27] we say we have no sin we deceive
[1:22:30] ourselves talking about in your flesh
[1:22:31] and your spirit if we confess our sins
[1:22:34] he's faithful and just forgive us our
[1:22:35] sins cleanse us from all righteous if we
[1:22:37] say we've not sinned we make him a
[1:22:40] liar so see that's why it's important
[1:22:42] you got to go on that's why the
[1:22:44] dominations are all wrong and they're
[1:22:45] leading people to the wrong way when
[1:22:47] they say oh just say a prayer and now
[1:22:48] you're filled with the Holy Spirit
[1:22:50] impossible that's not how God did the
[1:22:52] Earth Earth that's not how God does his
[1:22:54] bride that's not how God redeems
[1:22:55] anything amen it's three works of Grace
[1:22:58] to Perfection amen so brother said
[1:23:01] notice the Anan world he had after
[1:23:04] repented he said Noah he g a water
[1:23:08] baptism covered over with water that was
[1:23:11] justification the Second Step was
[1:23:13] sanctification types the blood of Jesus
[1:23:16] purchasing the Earth did you know that
[1:23:18] he bought the Earth when the blood
[1:23:20] dropped upon the Earth he bought it
[1:23:21] because all things are purchased by
[1:23:24] Blood amen exactly right brother man
[1:23:27] says that he said but sanctification
[1:23:30] sets our minds in order for Holiness to
[1:23:32] think right the second stage cleanses
[1:23:35] the Mind sets the mind of the heart in
[1:23:38] order for Holiness see a man can repent
[1:23:41] and he's still thinking the wrong things
[1:23:42] immoral man every immoral looking woman
[1:23:44] he finds is still there so a man does
[1:23:46] not Sanctified he can be get baptized
[1:23:48] but when he sees a sexy dressed woman
[1:23:50] he's still drawn to it and can't get
[1:23:51] over it he don't got the victory like
[1:23:53] he's supposed to have but is might not
[1:23:55] be his fault necessarily because we know
[1:23:58] he's got to go through sanctification
[1:24:00] maybe he just got saved are you with me
[1:24:03] Church you see that so you gotta balance
[1:24:05] that out or if he smells a drink it's
[1:24:08] still there don't get me wrong I haven't
[1:24:11] chewed tobacco or smoked a cigarette for
[1:24:13] 14 years but when this flesh smells it
[1:24:15] it wants it but there's nothing in my
[1:24:17] soul or mind that even comes close to
[1:24:20] giving over to it why CU I'm Sanctified
[1:24:24] amen I'm cleaned out and the mind is
[1:24:26] changed sanctification is the mind the
[1:24:29] character of the person get
[1:24:32] Sanctified it's their daily habits
[1:24:34] that's sanctification amen you can't get
[1:24:37] over some daily habits check your
[1:24:40] sanctification but then when he get
[1:24:42] Sanctified that cleanses that desire out
[1:24:43] of them
[1:24:46] see it takes the want of it away I don't
[1:24:49] want to do that anymore because you're
[1:24:51] sanctified
[1:24:53] he can still be tempted right but it
[1:24:55] takes the one of it away and then he's
[1:24:58] baptized with the Holy Ghost burned up
[1:25:01] cleaned up put in the service of God
[1:25:03] sanctification only sets them aside for
[1:25:07] service you're still not in service yet
[1:25:09] unless you're filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:25:11] now brother said Christ came and shed
[1:25:14] his blood upon the Earth cleansing it
[1:25:17] and cleaning it that's the world we live
[1:25:19] in now remember Satan he said in the
[1:25:21] scripture to take him to make him break
[1:25:23] God's plan to receive it and tried to
[1:25:26] give him the world without him dying
[1:25:27] remember that he tried to give him a
[1:25:30] gift without purchasing it and brother B
[1:25:32] said you know it's the same thing with
[1:25:33] Abraham the man tried to get him the
[1:25:35] land where he was gonna bury his
[1:25:37] Sarah and Abraham said I'm not taking it
[1:25:40] but I'll buy it from you amen because it
[1:25:43] must be purchased he said let it be
[1:25:45] known this day that I bought this
[1:25:47] bearing Place see purchased Satan tried
[1:25:49] to give him the kingdom which belongs to
[1:25:51] him now he tried to give it to him as a
[1:25:53] gift but he wouldn't receive it cuz see
[1:25:55] then Satan could still have a claim on
[1:25:57] it but it had to be bought amen that's
[1:25:59] why I don't understand people begging
[1:26:01] for money all the time or begging for
[1:26:02] this and begging for that if it's if
[1:26:04] you're begging for and it's given to you
[1:26:06] then it really wasn't a real gift from
[1:26:08] God but when you wait on God and trust
[1:26:11] in God then you know you've got real
[1:26:13] Faith amen and you can wait on it and
[1:26:15] you know God brought it to you praise
[1:26:17] God is that
[1:26:20] right but people always look at for a
[1:26:22] handout in this modern
[1:26:24] USA our tax dollar is going to support a
[1:26:27] bunch of Beggars that don't want to work
[1:26:28] that could work but don't want to work
[1:26:31] I'm not gonna get on politics anyways so
[1:26:34] not and not everybody you know my
[1:26:35] parents were on uh uh welfare for a
[1:26:39] while because my dad they got laid off
[1:26:40] so I'm thankful for welfare and when my
[1:26:42] wife and I first got married uh we had
[1:26:44] that little plan the welfare plan that
[1:26:46] gave us some free food and milk and eggs
[1:26:47] and stuff like that I'm thankful for
[1:26:50] welfare but I'm talking about those that
[1:26:52] have the mentality you owe me something
[1:26:55] and don't want to pay the price like
[1:26:57] Abraham paid the price later David got
[1:26:59] offered remember after basba he fell he
[1:27:02] got offered a place to set up an ALT he
[1:27:05] said I will not accept it but I will buy
[1:27:07] it amen I will pay the price and I'll
[1:27:11] I'll make sure that this is truly ours
[1:27:13] so you can't take it back
[1:27:16] later even as a son of man came to be
[1:27:19] ministered
[1:27:20] to I'm sorry came not to be ministered
[1:27:22] unto but to minister and to give his
[1:27:24] life as a ransom a ransom is a price for
[1:27:27] redeeming Jesus gave his life as a price
[1:27:31] to redeem you and I amen the Bible said
[1:27:33] we were redeemed in First Peter chapter
[1:27:35] 1 with the precious blood of Jesus
[1:27:37] Christ how many love the Lorden redeem
[1:27:40] means to liberate by paying the ransom
[1:27:44] amen hallelujah so you were bought back
[1:27:47] when Jesus blood dropped upon the Earth
[1:27:50] he said I have bought this Earth and
[1:27:52] guess what your bodies were laying there
[1:27:54] in the earth amen so your bodies
[1:27:57] naturally have been baptized in water in
[1:27:59] those days right your bodies have been
[1:28:02] purchased by the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:28:04] is that right and soon they'll be
[1:28:06] changed into a glorified body amen God
[1:28:10] has even purchased and washed your
[1:28:11] natural flesh if he done all that how
[1:28:14] much more your soul praise
[1:28:16] God
[1:28:18] Amen but man say your body's part of the
[1:28:21] earth so Jesus wased and purchased it I
[1:28:22] just preached it so I'm going to I guess
[1:28:24] I jumped ah head a little bit
[1:28:26] sorry says it see it was blood was shed
[1:28:29] at Calvary dropped upon the Earth to
[1:28:30] redeem the Earth and you are of these
[1:28:32] other parts that draw out this earth the
[1:28:34] earth you're a part of the earth your
[1:28:37] body and your soul is a part of God an
[1:28:39] attribute of God glory amen
[1:28:43] hallelujah look what he says next and
[1:28:45] you being a part of the earth it's
[1:28:47] Redeemed by it see your flesh was
[1:28:50] redeemed it was bought that's why you
[1:28:53] can say Satan get out of my body cuz
[1:28:55] Jesus purchased his body amen the
[1:28:58] literal body I'm talking about
[1:29:00] Hallelujah he bought it yes amen that's
[1:29:03] why brother man said in this he said you
[1:29:04] hear me on the tape say take your hands
[1:29:06] off God's Property he bought it Church
[1:29:08] by sheding that Holy Blood and we have a
[1:29:11] right to take God in his word and
[1:29:13] believe every promise to keep this thing
[1:29:15] healthy
[1:29:16] amen glory it's been baptized by Noah's
[1:29:20] day it's been purchased by the blood of
[1:29:22] Jesus Christ amen he said your body was
[1:29:26] justified under Noah's
[1:29:27] baptism
[1:29:29] Hallelujah you believe that amen and
[1:29:32] your flesh when it dropped upon there
[1:29:34] the Earth is be cleansed by fire the
[1:29:35] place where you live with the baptism of
[1:29:37] the Holy Ghost a dwelling place for
[1:29:39] Christ and his bride amen step three is
[1:29:42] a baptism the Holy Ghost types the fire
[1:29:44] that will burn the
[1:29:45] Earth he said then it is now to get a
[1:29:47] fire baptism see what happened Christ
[1:29:50] called repentance and sanctification and
[1:29:52] with the fire of God came down and burn
[1:29:54] out all the filth come down and dwells
[1:29:56] in the human heart talking about how it
[1:29:58] applies to you and I but it has to go
[1:30:01] through a baptism of fire Holy Fire of
[1:30:03] God which cleanses the earth and the
[1:30:05] heavens around it then it's purchased
[1:30:07] that the redeemed can live on it live in
[1:30:10] a place I'm G skip ahead he says holy
[1:30:13] fire from God comes down from God out of
[1:30:16] heaven and burns it up to make it ready
[1:30:18] for God to dwell did you notice the
[1:30:20] Bible said even the elements remember
[1:30:22] the periodic table of elements from
[1:30:24] science I don't remember much about that
[1:30:25] all other than they were just called
[1:30:27] elements but all those will be burn up
[1:30:30] and God will start over again amen
[1:30:34] hallelujah for God in the new world that
[1:30:36] is to come is to dwell on the
[1:30:38] earth he said God dwells in the human
[1:30:41] heart brother man said you're right but
[1:30:42] he the bride becomes one and they go to
[1:30:45] their home in the new world and the same
[1:30:46] Plan of Redemption is used to redeem
[1:30:48] both world and the persons that live in
[1:30:50] it amen
[1:30:52] Glory the Bible said the Earth is
[1:30:54] reserved unto fire it's got a it's got a
[1:30:58] a date coming up it's got an appointment
[1:31:00] it's got a reservation time to get a
[1:31:02] fire baptism sir oh so do you if you're
[1:31:06] a Christian amen you've got an appointed
[1:31:08] date a certain time and and Jesus Will
[1:31:11] baptize you with the Holy Ghost in fire
[1:31:14] our bodies are reserved under Fire
[1:31:16] Hallelujah the Holy Ghost Fire oh my oh
[1:31:20] yes come of the day of God where the
[1:31:23] heavens being on fire the heavens the
[1:31:25] atmosphere will be on
[1:31:27] fire and dissolve the elements shall
[1:31:30] melt with fervent heat now I'm taking
[1:31:34] this right in the order brother randoms
[1:31:35] teaches it in most cases next brother R
[1:31:37] after the shows the three Works he goes
[1:31:40] into how a new Earth does not mean a
[1:31:42] brand new Earth it just means a b over
[1:31:46] Earth on the outside shell we'd say he
[1:31:49] calls it he says the frame Remains the
[1:31:51] the same but he's got to burn all the
[1:31:54] sin off around it and in all the
[1:31:57] atmospheres okay so I'm going to go kind
[1:31:59] of fast for this because that's not very
[1:32:00] hard for it's not like a big doctrinal
[1:32:03] debate we have well let's see I'm not g
[1:32:05] to spend as much time on that because
[1:32:06] it's just kind of simple okay the new
[1:32:08] Heavens the new Earth the heavens being
[1:32:10] on fire should be dissolved new heavens
[1:32:12] and new earth so it says new Earth new
[1:32:14] Heavens now he said' one if you read
[1:32:16] these passages one might be led to think
[1:32:19] that the whole planet will be destroyed
[1:32:21] but a close study with the help of the
[1:32:23] Holy Spirit we can see the truth of this
[1:32:26] that's what we're going to do it's only
[1:32:28] the atmospheres around it and the sin
[1:32:30] that's upon the Earth that will be
[1:32:33] destroyed what does it do the thistle
[1:32:35] sickness death politics sinful man
[1:32:38] sinful woman evil spirits will be gone
[1:32:40] away and annihilated because we're going
[1:32:42] to live right here brother Brandon says
[1:32:45] right here is where we live the thistles
[1:32:47] germs and things will be completely
[1:32:49] taken
[1:32:50] away he said and all the heavens above
[1:32:52] us in here is contaminated with evil
[1:32:55] spirit now I don't have the scripture
[1:32:57] but I know there's one in Hebrews where
[1:32:58] the Bible said that um the heavens have
[1:33:00] to be purged as well because demons are
[1:33:03] allowed to go before the The Throne of
[1:33:05] God and accuse Jose day and night or
[1:33:07] sister marelen or brother J they're
[1:33:09] allowed to go there but thr the Throne
[1:33:10] of God day and night and accuse us
[1:33:12] because of that the heavens need purged
[1:33:15] amen glory it's in Hebrews I don't have
[1:33:18] the scripture in front of me but I can
[1:33:19] find I just have time with all the other
[1:33:21] ones I just forgot to put it down there
[1:33:23] but brother said even the heavens need
[1:33:27] purged all right now the old world the
[1:33:30] framework was not destroyed by a water
[1:33:33] the world was only washed off it's got
[1:33:35] its baptism so will the framework remain
[1:33:38] though it be burnt by
[1:33:39] fire it don't destroy the Earth it just
[1:33:42] destroys the sin that's on it okay so
[1:33:44] here's the framework the core outer core
[1:33:47] mantle you know this from school
[1:33:49] whatever more this remains all the same
[1:33:53] the only thing that's going to change is
[1:33:55] the outside here comes sin is present
[1:33:57] right now but there's coming of fire
[1:34:00] that's going to be so great it's gonna
[1:34:02] burn
[1:34:03] everything okay you have your fire you
[1:34:06] know Burns
[1:34:08] atmospheres okay then sin is gone it's a
[1:34:11] sin cleansed Earth and now the framework
[1:34:14] Remains the Same inside it just burned
[1:34:17] all on the outside yeah does that
[1:34:20] help
[1:34:22] he talks to brother Leo he says see it
[1:34:25] doesn't mean the Earth the planet is
[1:34:26] going to pass away but the world Cosmos
[1:34:30] the politics the Sinners germs disease
[1:34:33] will pass away can you say Amen to that
[1:34:35] Peter said a melt with fervent heat not
[1:34:37] the planet The Works
[1:34:40] therein and that's what the Bible says
[1:34:43] the earth and the works that are therein
[1:34:45] shall be burned up I don't see any head
[1:34:47] spinning yet so I'm going to keep going
[1:34:48] when I see head spin I'll slow down a
[1:34:49] little bit I'm I'm just kidding
[1:34:52] but I don't want to go too fast but I
[1:34:53] think so this might you might have heard
[1:34:54] on the tape a few years ago or maybe
[1:34:56] last week or something like that I want
[1:34:57] to get to the most important things okay
[1:35:01] I'm gonna skip past that okay I like
[1:35:03] this too brother B says not alog
[1:35:05] together just a literal fire like
[1:35:07] brother said La brother Bram said lava
[1:35:09] is GNA come up out of the earth and
[1:35:10] Destroy brandom Tabernacle he said that
[1:35:13] he said lava is gonna destroy this
[1:35:15] Tabernacle here he said in questions the
[1:35:16] answer
[1:35:18] 64 right so you see that he said there's
[1:35:22] going to be fire from the inside of the
[1:35:23] earth spew out and there's gonna be fire
[1:35:26] from the heavens as well there's also a
[1:35:28] holy fire that will take away Satan and
[1:35:31] all of his all the Devils both Heaven
[1:35:33] and Earth killing all the germs all the
[1:35:35] insects even the H2O will explode think
[1:35:37] of that talk about a
[1:35:39] noise if they split an Adam and there
[1:35:41] was so much noise and light what's going
[1:35:43] to happen when they destroy all the
[1:35:44] water
[1:35:45] too with all the Adams in there right
[1:35:50] look brother giv a t you know when a man
[1:35:52] receives a baptism of fire there's a lot
[1:35:54] of noise around there
[1:35:55] too when the earth gets baptized there's
[1:35:58] a lot of noise brother it's the same way
[1:36:01] when you're born again amen glory they
[1:36:04] think that's a shame to hear people
[1:36:05] scream and shout like that just wait
[1:36:07] till the Earth gets a
[1:36:09] baptism oh my now all the outside the
[1:36:13] crust and hundreds of feet below it will
[1:36:16] just simply be completely demolished the
[1:36:19] holy wrath of God will come upon it will
[1:36:21] cleanse it will change the entire
[1:36:23] surface of the
[1:36:25] Earth not all the inside just the
[1:36:29] surface he said maybe hundreds of feet
[1:36:32] below the surface praise God so now
[1:36:36] brother man used the new word the Earth
[1:36:38] will be renovated not annihilated just
[1:36:40] like you're
[1:36:42] renovated Jesus said Heaven Earth shall
[1:36:44] pass away in other words Heaven Earth
[1:36:45] shall be changed so instead of pass away
[1:36:47] he used the word changed no not
[1:36:50] annihilated for later we see a New
[1:36:53] Jerusalem coming down from God out of
[1:36:55] heaven and sitting upon this Earth it
[1:36:57] doesn't mean it'll be annihilated the
[1:37:00] systems will be
[1:37:01] changed again in Matthew 5:5 Jesus said
[1:37:04] the meek shall inherit the earth it
[1:37:05] isn't going to just have another Earth
[1:37:07] it's going to be the same Earth the
[1:37:09] baptism of fire only cleanse it make it
[1:37:11] fit place for his Meek to live in just
[1:37:14] like he did us his creation to live in
[1:37:16] before he could come in it he had to
[1:37:18] give us a baptism of fire then the Holy
[1:37:20] Ghost could come in the baptism of
[1:37:23] fire so who's that talking about when he
[1:37:25] says the meek shall herit the Earth he's
[1:37:26] talking about the people that live in
[1:37:28] the new city sir praise God that's who
[1:37:32] will inherit the earth the true Meek the
[1:37:34] true humble that submit to all the word
[1:37:36] of God that's meekness submitting to the
[1:37:39] word of God not just acting all kind and
[1:37:42] nice and trying not to step on brother
[1:37:43] Jean's toes and brother Andy's toes and
[1:37:45] trying to be like a real softspoken man
[1:37:48] soft spoken preacher that's fine I mean
[1:37:50] if you want to do that if God leads you
[1:37:52] to do that that's fine but what you need
[1:37:53] is to submit to God Amen and obey the
[1:37:56] word and Let the Fire come upon you and
[1:37:59] change your life
[1:38:02] amen then we get that baptism fire Holy
[1:38:04] Ghost can come in what does it do it
[1:38:06] burns up everything contrary to the word
[1:38:08] out of you it won't believe nothing else
[1:38:11] but the word because it is the
[1:38:13] word you're the same man in stature that
[1:38:17] you was when God called you the same
[1:38:18] woman so the same the same 5 fo 11 frame
[1:38:22] that went there to worship and praise
[1:38:24] God the day after my wedding and then I
[1:38:27] got the holy ghost in the service during
[1:38:28] the I believe during the song service
[1:38:30] and when I walked out I was the same
[1:38:32] stature same height same everything I
[1:38:34] had a little wet face because of my
[1:38:35] tears and praising God but in the same
[1:38:37] stature I was the same exact thing but
[1:38:40] on the inside I was a new man I had new
[1:38:43] life I had a fire I had a Zeal I had a
[1:38:46] love I never experienced before say man
[1:38:49] but fire on the inside amen
[1:38:53] it was a regeneration the old life
[1:38:54] passed away the old desires passed away
[1:38:58] used to like to drink cuss fuss stew and
[1:39:00] run around immoral just that that thing
[1:39:03] just died if we could say can we just
[1:39:05] say just died ready just died that died
[1:39:08] yeah you don't fuss anymore you don't
[1:39:10] cuss
[1:39:11] anymore praise God that died because the
[1:39:14] fire already cleaned it out and burned
[1:39:16] it out it's already out of your life see
[1:39:19] then you was sayings instrument now you
[1:39:21] are
[1:39:23] redeemed that's the way the world would
[1:39:25] be the same way redeemed new Heavens new
[1:39:27] Earth just like you're a new creature
[1:39:29] the Greek word anybody knows your new
[1:39:31] cre creat creation a new creation in the
[1:39:33] same old
[1:39:35] Temple
[1:39:37] Glory again the meek inherit the earth
[1:39:39] it isn't going to just have another
[1:39:41] Earth it's going to be the same Earth
[1:39:42] I'm trying to get the Plan of Redemption
[1:39:44] here before if I don't get nothing else
[1:39:46] so brother B if you don't get nothing
[1:39:47] else I he said I want you to see the
[1:39:49] Plan of Redemption those three works of
[1:39:50] Grace
[1:39:52] if you can get that he said he'd be
[1:39:56] happy like he did us before he could
[1:39:59] come he had to give us the baptism of
[1:40:01] fire the Holy Ghost come to live in the
[1:40:02] fire
[1:40:03] baptism I'm doing pretty good I'm 27
[1:40:06] minutes in and I got 73 slides done
[1:40:09] already praise the Lord I don't see
[1:40:11] anybody passed out either eyes
[1:40:15] crossed I see that that's pretty good
[1:40:17] too says in the great age to come in the
[1:40:20] renovation
[1:40:21] you're going to burn it up like the fire
[1:40:23] to burn all the worldly things off like
[1:40:25] you do the Christian you save him you
[1:40:27] baptize him you sanctify then renovate
[1:40:30] the world from him
[1:40:33] amen and to claim him then is your own
[1:40:36] by putting the holy spirit in him
[1:40:38] Hallelujah that's what we did with this
[1:40:39] church we just renovated it the owner
[1:40:41] walked in and said my she didn't use
[1:40:43] that word but that's basically what she
[1:40:44] was saying what a renovation you've done
[1:40:45] to this place same frame same everything
[1:40:49] but all the marks on the wall and the
[1:40:50] old dirty nasty carpet all of it got
[1:40:52] we'd say torn out of here burned up but
[1:40:56] not really but it got it got renovated
[1:40:58] and all behold All Things become new
[1:41:01] praise God so God renovates the world
[1:41:04] from us cleans all our dirty spots now
[1:41:08] brother B then goes into this I know it
[1:41:10] might seem out of order but I'm just
[1:41:11] going with the way the prophet taught it
[1:41:13] okay I won't do that with who this MZ
[1:41:15] because that's an even deeper subject
[1:41:16] than this to my opinion this is a simple
[1:41:19] subject compared to who's this MZ
[1:41:22] we'll get to that later by God's grace
[1:41:24] um says this be not ignorant we read the
[1:41:28] scripture 1,000 years is one
[1:41:31] day how many knew
[1:41:33] that the Bible tells us we read this in
[1:41:36] our text one day with the Lord is as a
[1:41:38] thousand years and a thousand years as
[1:41:39] one day now the bride you know this they
[1:41:44] lived and reign with Christ a thousand
[1:41:46] years so the bride has to have one day
[1:41:49] with Christ amen praise God they sit on
[1:41:53] the throne they're given judgment they
[1:41:55] get to rule during the Millennium and
[1:41:57] things like that we'll get to that as
[1:42:00] well the Bible said the rest of the Dead
[1:42:03] live not until the thousand years were
[1:42:05] finished so only the Blood Washed bride
[1:42:09] and those 144,000 seal with the Holy
[1:42:12] Ghost and Christ as far as we can tell
[1:42:14] now there's a few questions on that but
[1:42:17] for the most part let me say like that
[1:42:19] because brother man said he said it
[1:42:21] looks like there might be nations in the
[1:42:22] Millennium it looks like there might not
[1:42:24] be he said I don't know I don't have the
[1:42:26] answer until God shows me but I'm saying
[1:42:29] those that live in the city or those not
[1:42:30] City those that live near the temple
[1:42:32] with Christ and those that live in the
[1:42:34] millennium are those who are Blood
[1:42:35] Washed and the rest who didn't get the
[1:42:37] Holy Ghost they don't live until the
[1:42:39] thousand years is
[1:42:41] over and they that live will reign a
[1:42:44] thousand years that's one day now look
[1:42:46] what brother man says the Millennium
[1:42:47] Reign is not the new
[1:42:49] Earth right so the Millennium is not
[1:42:52] that pyramid coming down that's after
[1:42:54] the Millennium we're talking about the
[1:42:56] new Earth that the new Earth that
[1:42:58] receives that holy city but brother M
[1:43:00] make sure he tells him the Millennium is
[1:43:01] not the new Earth he said the Millennium
[1:43:04] Reign is a thousand years he said the
[1:43:07] Millennium is just a resting place a
[1:43:09] period not all the new heavens and the
[1:43:11] Earth it's a type of the old seven day
[1:43:13] out of Eden the seventh day after he
[1:43:15] made the world the seventh day he rested
[1:43:16] in Eden and the Millennium remember God
[1:43:18] rested on the seventh day in Genesis
[1:43:20] chapter 1 you remember that but it got
[1:43:22] interrupted by sin so God never got to
[1:43:25] finish his his thousand years with his
[1:43:27] little Adam and Eve but he's gonna get
[1:43:30] that right that's what the Millennium is
[1:43:31] all about right amen the Millennium is
[1:43:34] not the end of it there will still be
[1:43:36] time after the Millennium the Millennium
[1:43:38] is a space of time not the new Earth so
[1:43:41] the future home is not the Millennium
[1:43:43] the future home comes after the
[1:43:44] Millennium this is what I showed on
[1:43:46] Thursday day one was a thousand years
[1:43:50] that's like en O's age there and then
[1:43:52] this is like Noah's day all right so
[1:43:56] after 2,000 years the prophet says God
[1:43:59] does something every 2,000 years right
[1:44:01] hey vard what's your name Sir William
[1:44:03] night let's give William round Applause
[1:44:04] well thanks for coming
[1:44:06] William nice to have you sir I never
[1:44:09] seen him before so I want to make sure I
[1:44:10] greet him so that was about 6,000 years
[1:44:13] ago that was day two day three was the
[1:44:17] next thousand day four was the next
[1:44:19] thousand that's when Christ was on the
[1:44:21] earth day five was the first thousand
[1:44:24] years after Christ now we're in the
[1:44:26] church ages we're now finishing up this
[1:44:29] sixth day right a day with is the Lord
[1:44:32] is a thousand
[1:44:34] years next comes the fire of the earth
[1:44:38] now my other Earth disappeared I used to
[1:44:39] have other earth right there I'm not
[1:44:40] sure what happened I had Earth there
[1:44:42] sorry about that anyway so day seven
[1:44:45] will be the Millennium so there's the
[1:44:47] word Millennium God wants his seven day
[1:44:51] yeah God had six days the seventh got
[1:44:53] interrupted now Satan's had six but
[1:44:55] God's going to get his seven back amen
[1:44:58] that
[1:44:59] right now the Millennium is not the
[1:45:01] seventh day I'm s I'm sorry the
[1:45:03] Millennium is the seventh day forgive me
[1:45:05] but there's an eighth day we know is
[1:45:07] coming next the eighth day is the new
[1:45:11] heavens and the new Earth the eighth day
[1:45:13] is the New Jerusalem that's what we're
[1:45:15] preaching this morning the new city our
[1:45:18] future home amen it's not up in heaven
[1:45:21] heaven comes down to earth brother
[1:45:23] random says amen
[1:45:25] hallelujah people always say oh in
[1:45:27] heaven One Day in heaven one day they
[1:45:28] don't even know what they're saying
[1:45:30] Heaven comes down to earth my friends
[1:45:32] and we get to dwell on the earth for all
[1:45:35] eternity that's right so now the Earth
[1:45:38] has been a fire baptism now this future
[1:45:42] home can come down and Crown the
[1:45:45] Earth that's the Eighth Day brother said
[1:45:48] see the world has now almost 6,000 years
[1:45:52] every 2,000 years I had a destruction
[1:45:54] I'm going just skip past that I've
[1:45:55] already taught on that I've already
[1:45:56] taught on this you've already seen this
[1:45:58] every 2,000 years Noah Messiah son of
[1:46:00] man vot to the Gentiles and goes back to
[1:46:02] the
[1:46:05] Jews okay
[1:46:07] next he says this now notice this
[1:46:10] Millennium is a type of the seventh day
[1:46:12] praise the Lord then comes the white
[1:46:15] Throne judgment see we still have
[1:46:16] judgment we're still in time in the
[1:46:18] Millennium it's not a day it's 1,000
[1:46:22] years now I need I know I need to study
[1:46:25] more on the Millennium but one thing I
[1:46:27] know is this we're taught from the Bible
[1:46:29] and brother Brandon the Bible said they
[1:46:30] shall build houses and shall
[1:46:33] inhabit the Millennium is a time where
[1:46:35] we
[1:46:37] build you build brother Jesse you don't
[1:46:40] have much skills well I will have skills
[1:46:42] over there I might not have the handyman
[1:46:44] skills right now brother Kevin I can
[1:46:46] hardly you know make something straight
[1:46:47] and maybe make a birdhouse hardly but
[1:46:50] over there I'll build if I can't build
[1:46:52] with the hands I'll build by the spoken
[1:46:55] word amen
[1:46:57] hallelujah it's exactly right but the
[1:46:59] new Earth he's already went and prepared
[1:47:02] the place it's built we have nothing to
[1:47:04] do with the building of
[1:47:07] it and remember the seventh Feast was
[1:47:10] the Feast of Tabernacles where they
[1:47:12] built
[1:47:13] booths so The Seven Feast types the
[1:47:16] seventh day the
[1:47:19] millennium
[1:47:21] and now in the book of Isaiah now he
[1:47:22] goes to Isaiah we're not going to read
[1:47:24] that today because I want to make sure
[1:47:25] we get to it brother use that text for
[1:47:27] the Millennium we'll have a whole
[1:47:28] another sermon on the Millennium I'm not
[1:47:29] ready for it now like I said I've been
[1:47:31] pouring myself into the three bodies and
[1:47:33] who's this mezic and future home now the
[1:47:36] New Jerusalem is after go and Magog now
[1:47:39] if you want to copy this next one I did
[1:47:41] this in 2008 it's so small don't try to
[1:47:43] read it but I put everything in order
[1:47:45] that I felt led uh after reading brother
[1:47:47] bram's message okay but this is the one
[1:47:49] I showed on Thursday tonight this is the
[1:47:51] apostal order of end time events you
[1:47:52] have The Binding of the tears that's
[1:47:54] what's going on now all the Antichrist
[1:47:56] people churches whatever more are
[1:47:58] uniting against the word together they
[1:48:00] don't love the real word they don't want
[1:48:02] to really live all the Bible they have a
[1:48:03] form of godliness but they deny the
[1:48:05] power of the spirit to cleanse their
[1:48:06] lives they let their women cut their
[1:48:08] hair when Paul says the women should
[1:48:10] have long hair praise God they let
[1:48:13] people go and and uh they're like lot
[1:48:16] everything they see and hear torments
[1:48:17] them they go to movies and TV shows and
[1:48:19] sports and pour all this filth into
[1:48:21] their souls and no wonder they have no
[1:48:23] fire for Jesus Christ no wonder they're
[1:48:25] not born again they're tormenting
[1:48:27] themselves by allowing demons that come
[1:48:28] in through their eyes and ears the eyes
[1:48:30] and ears are the gates of the
[1:48:32] soul but after this we're United with
[1:48:34] Christ The Rapture of the Bride Comes
[1:48:36] next it's the first
[1:48:37] resurrection after that the tribulation
[1:48:40] after that the battle of Armageddon then
[1:48:42] fire after the battle fire comes and
[1:48:44] burns the Earth then we can walk out on
[1:48:46] the ashes of the wicked in the
[1:48:47] Millennium not that we want to but we
[1:48:49] love Jes Jesus so we have to Satan loose
[1:48:53] is after the Millennium Battle of go and
[1:48:55] Magog that's Satan's demise he's cast a
[1:48:57] lake of fire after that battle then the
[1:49:00] white Throne judgment I had no room up
[1:49:01] here so I had to put it down here that's
[1:49:03] the second resurrection and then you
[1:49:05] have the new Heavens new Earth that's
[1:49:06] the eth day there he comes he coming
[1:49:08] down out of Heaven praise the Lord
[1:49:12] that's the best I know as of right now
[1:49:14] you love the Lorden the New Jerusalem is
[1:49:16] a result of Earth's birth pains that's
[1:49:19] what we're seeing right now now I just
[1:49:21] got an email by all the uh recent
[1:49:23] earthquakes in California and to me I
[1:49:25] just said praise the lord it's just all
[1:49:26] birth pains yeah just one another one of
[1:49:28] those pains that woman has you know and
[1:49:31] just have to go through it right it's
[1:49:33] coming into a birth brother B said
[1:49:35] brother said when he preach birth pains
[1:49:37] he
[1:49:37] said the S subject saying that the world
[1:49:40] is in birth pains now the old has to be
[1:49:43] done away with so the new can be born he
[1:49:45] said how the pains birth pains has
[1:49:47] struck the world World War I World War
[1:49:49] II she cannot stand another labor pain
[1:49:52] with these missiles and things one more
[1:49:54] war will throw her in outer space for
[1:49:56] she will now be delivered there will be
[1:49:57] a new Earth the Bible said there will
[1:50:01] be so the New Jerusalem is Eden again
[1:50:04] brother Bram says next in the future
[1:50:06] home now this new Earth let's look at it
[1:50:08] for a few minutes
[1:50:09] now he said now I'm skipping down a lot
[1:50:12] this is the same thing he already said
[1:50:13] No More Tears no more nothing in the new
[1:50:15] new Earth Satan's cast out in the new
[1:50:18] Earth and new Heavens will never be
[1:50:19] blackened again again when the new Earth
[1:50:21] is come the devil will be bound Satan
[1:50:23] will be he's loose now he's an accuser
[1:50:25] but the new Earth he will be bound and
[1:50:27] cast in Lake of Fire in the Holy
[1:50:30] Fire heavens and earth have met God and
[1:50:33] man is reconciled a restored Eden has
[1:50:36] begun see all the curse is gone so when
[1:50:39] this new city finally comes it will be
[1:50:41] heaven uniting with Earth both perfect
[1:50:44] both cleanse a perfect union between a a
[1:50:47] Godly woman prepared and a Godly Man the
[1:50:50] Earth yeah that's right amen the Bible
[1:50:52] said the new city came down as a bride
[1:50:54] adorned for its husband are you with me
[1:50:57] church so the Earth in that case
[1:50:59] represents the man because that new city
[1:51:01] represents a
[1:51:04] woman and then the Earth is restored by
[1:51:06] the same thing there can be no more
[1:51:08] cursing storms winds typhoons you are
[1:51:11] reconciled man and God is met the new
[1:51:13] Earth will be put on its Eden Beauty
[1:51:17] again man and God Has Come Together
[1:51:20] bride and bridegroom Heaven and Earth
[1:51:21] has Embrace each other God has come down
[1:51:23] to dwell among men his Tabernacle is
[1:51:25] with them no more sin God has already
[1:51:27] took up his Abode potentially because
[1:51:29] the kingdom of God is on the earth in
[1:51:31] the hearts of his Saints brother man
[1:51:33] said the baptism of Holy Ghost is
[1:51:34] potentially God living on the
[1:51:37] earth does that surprise you glory
[1:51:40] potentially he's already here living on
[1:51:42] the earth in your soul if you're born
[1:51:44] again his attribut that he was in the
[1:51:47] beginning now his attribut is redeemed
[1:51:49] what's he waiting to redeem the Earth to
[1:51:51] set his attributes on it to fulfill
[1:51:53] exactly his predestinated

[1:52:40] and the heavens and the Earth is husband
[1:52:42] and wife so is Christ and the church so
[1:52:46] Heaven and Earth or new city and Earth

[1:52:51] praise God and they meet in one big
[1:52:53] glorious Plan of Redemption is brought
[1:52:55] right in the bosoms of God
[1:52:57] again I love this we read this last
[1:52:59] night in our Bible time we're almost
[1:53:00] through the New Testament we just got to
[1:53:01] get through the rest of St John we're
[1:53:02] through the whole new testament reading
[1:53:04] out loud with our kids so I'm thankful
[1:53:05] for that my wife does a great job and
[1:53:07] the kids do a great job reading too
[1:53:10] Christ is preparing the New Jerusalem
[1:53:12] right now did you know
[1:53:14] that John 14 we read this last night
[1:53:16] this was a chapter we just by God's hand
[1:53:18] we read this chapter last night
[1:53:20] I thought well that's the Lord let not
[1:53:22] your heart be troubled ye believe in God
[1:53:24] believe also me in my father's house are
[1:53:26] many mansions if it were not so I would
[1:53:28] have told you I go to prepare a place
[1:53:30] for you I and if I go and prepare a
[1:53:33] place for you I'll come again receive
[1:53:34] you unto myself that where I am there ye
[1:53:37] may be also brother B said in the new
[1:53:39] Earth there's a new city now listen
[1:53:41] don't forget this Jesus said in John 14
[1:53:44] he would go to prepare let y let not
[1:53:46] your heart be troubled he said if you
[1:53:49] believe in God believe also in me I'm
[1:53:50] going to prepare a place for you now you
[1:53:51] know I'm going to skip that Christ is
[1:53:54] there under the construction of this New
[1:53:56] Jerusalem
[1:53:59] now don't move don't miss this Christ is
[1:54:01] in heaven
[1:54:03] today preparing the New
[1:54:05] Jerusalem now I don't know how he does
[1:54:07] this but the Bible said he intercedes
[1:54:09] for us at the same time this City's
[1:54:11] being built only God could do that for
[1:54:14] you Brothers we have to leave home if
[1:54:15] we're going to build something or go get
[1:54:17] away but he stands right there
[1:54:18] intercedes for us all the prayers all
[1:54:20] around the world and he's able to build
[1:54:22] at the same time that's my
[1:54:24] God that's the God we serve
[1:54:27] amen he's got plenty of time for because
[1:54:29] he's outside of time Glory he created
[1:54:33] time and he slips in it and out of it as
[1:54:35] he
[1:54:35] likes that's right don't move don't miss
[1:54:38] it Christ has gone is preparing a place
[1:54:41] that's been in construction for many
[1:54:43] thousand years preparing a place he said
[1:54:45] notice the Redeemer and the
[1:54:47] redeemed the Jerusalem which you not
[1:54:49] here on Earth but we are of the
[1:54:51] Jerusalem
[1:54:53] above where the word come from from
[1:54:57] predestination that's our home the New
[1:54:59] Jerusalem then is not heaven because
[1:55:02] heaven will remain after the Earth is
[1:55:04] burned over Heavens will remain they'll
[1:55:06] just be cleansed and purged right but
[1:55:09] what we call Heaven which is the Throne
[1:55:11] of God that's what we call Heaven is
[1:55:14] that what we mean when we say heaven
[1:55:15] what do you really mean when we say oh
[1:55:16] one day I going to see him in heaven one
[1:55:17] day I'll see her in heaven you mean the
[1:55:19] Throne of God
[1:55:20] where God
[1:55:21] dwells so the heavens itself the space
[1:55:25] the atmosphere will remain but the
[1:55:27] throne in heaven will come down to earth
[1:55:29] that's why I said Heaven comes down to
[1:55:31] Earth because heaven is where God is
[1:55:34] amen Revelation 212 and I John saw the
[1:55:37] holy city New Jerusalem coming down from
[1:55:39] God out of Heaven Out of Heaven so see
[1:55:43] heaven's still there but the city comes
[1:55:45] out of it as a bride adorned for a
[1:55:48] husband remember it's not heaven brother
[1:55:51] Adam says John said I saw it coming down
[1:55:54] from Out of Heaven it's to be on the
[1:55:56] earth he ain't going to make a new world
[1:55:59] it's this one right
[1:56:01] here he's gonna burn it off cleanse it
[1:56:04] like he did you his plans must forever
[1:56:07] remain remember it's going not to be
[1:56:09] Heaven it comes down from heaven John
[1:56:12] saw the city descending from heaven like
[1:56:14] a dove like
[1:56:17] Heen okay
[1:56:20] so the type of the New Jerusalem
[1:56:22] descending was Jesus
[1:56:24] baptism that's a type brother B gives
[1:56:26] him this message when Jesus got baptized
[1:56:29] the Dove came down and brother Ram said
[1:56:30] like the dove descended so will the
[1:56:32] Heavenly City descend upon the
[1:56:35] Earth and just like our baptism just as
[1:56:37] we serve the Lord and the Holy Ghost
[1:56:39] comes down to anoint us it's a type of
[1:56:41] the new city coming down to dwell
[1:56:44] Forever on the
[1:56:46] earth brother says it's also in Harvest
[1:56:49] Time he talks about the new city same
[1:56:51] thing with Jesus look when he was
[1:56:52] baptized in water he made the
[1:56:54] preparations to begin with by the father
[1:56:56] he's raised up and here come the dove
[1:56:58] upon the lamb what do he do when he put
[1:57:00] that Dove on there he claimed part of
[1:57:02] that life next he goes into us then when
[1:57:05] a man and woman goes into God complete
[1:57:07] now not under just some spell or some
[1:57:09] under some emotion but really when the
[1:57:11] word in him becomes one God has saved
[1:57:13] that person Sanctified him renovate
[1:57:15] everything of the world away from him
[1:57:17] with the fire of the Holy Ghost and
[1:57:18] lives in that person reflecting himself
[1:57:21] that perfect man or woman living by the
[1:57:24] word praise God so can you see that
[1:57:29] there's the types of the Holy Ghost
[1:57:30] filling jesus' body and the type of the
[1:57:32] Holy Ghost filling a real Christian
[1:57:34] today is the type of that Heavenly City
[1:57:36] coming down from
[1:57:37] heaven praise the Lord the new Earth is
[1:57:41] the Throne of heaven when it comes down
[1:57:43] to
[1:57:44] earth the man says see for heaven to
[1:57:47] dwell on the earth it must the Earth
[1:57:49] must have a fire for heaven to come down
[1:57:52] and dwell now when he's talking about
[1:57:53] heaven he's talking about The Throne
[1:57:55] okay so that's the clarification the
[1:57:57] Throne of Heaven comes down to earth yet
[1:57:59] there remain three Heavens remember that
[1:58:01] second Corinthians 12:2 there's still
[1:58:03] three Heavens praise God the first
[1:58:06] Heaven brother manam says I don't have
[1:58:08] the quote here the first Heaven is the
[1:58:09] atmosphere around the earth the second
[1:58:11] heaven is all space and universe as it
[1:58:13] keeps expanding and so forth the third
[1:58:15] heaven is where God's Throne was well is
[1:58:18] right now but was when day it'll be it
[1:58:20] was one day praise the Lord am so I this
[1:58:23] just real simple I just showed it again
[1:58:25] just that coming down now that's a
[1:58:27] beautiful picture I found on the
[1:58:28] internet I don't know who gets the
[1:58:29] credit for that that sure is a nice
[1:58:30] picture I'm not selling it so I don't
[1:58:32] have to I don't have to cite it I'm not
[1:58:34] selling it not making any money off that
[1:58:36] now Heaven comes down to earth a type of
[1:58:38] Jesus baptism I to skip that one he says
[1:58:40] like a dove coming down future home
[1:58:42] future home future home future home John
[1:58:46] the Baptist saw the Heavenly Dove come
[1:58:47] down to earth on Jesus and then St John
[1:58:49] saw the Heavenly City come down to earth
[1:58:51] both John's saw the same saw something
[1:58:53] that's very similar I thought that was
[1:58:55] interesting and John means the Beloved
[1:58:58] praise the Lord now here what will the
[1:59:00] new Jerusalem look
[1:59:02] like it will be just what we like yeah
[1:59:06] now whether you know it or not if you're
[1:59:08] a bride
[1:59:09] member if you're a bride member the new
[1:59:11] Earth will be just what you
[1:59:14] like you think why is that brother Jesse
[1:59:17] well let's listen well like did you ever
[1:59:19] think of that now bride what it look
[1:59:21] like it's prepared and designed by the
[1:59:23] Divine architect what will the city look
[1:59:25] like we're talk about that he has
[1:59:28] designed it with tender hands for his
[1:59:30] beloved
[1:59:33] bride oh it's gonna look like can you
[1:59:36] imagine a man marrying a wife that's
[1:59:38] able now I wish I would have been able
[1:59:39] when I first got married to ask my wife
[1:59:42] honey I'm so rich what kind of kitchen
[1:59:45] would you
[1:59:46] like well Jesse don't you think we
[1:59:48] should talk about how many children to
[1:59:49] have first yeah but I forgot about that
[1:59:52] because we actually forgot to talk about
[1:59:53] that before I got married but everyone's
[1:59:54] a blessing we're letting God have full
[1:59:57] control how he builds and puts every
[1:59:59] little thing just exactly to her touch
[2:00:03] just what she would
[2:00:05] like amen now the Divine architect has
[2:00:09] designed the new city where we will live
[2:00:10] with his bride just to her touch no
[2:00:14] wonder the Apostle said no eye has seen
[2:00:16] or has ears heard neither enter the
[2:00:18] heart of man what God has prepared for
[2:00:19] them that love him it will be just what
[2:00:23] you
[2:00:24] like I don't go there much but sister
[2:00:26] Wendy I really like mountains I like
[2:00:28] driving when I go down to North Carolina
[2:00:30] I like driving through those mountains I
[2:00:31] just think M that's just beautiful I
[2:00:32] also like Lakes
[2:00:34] too uh the ocean was okay I wasn't
[2:00:36] really big on the ocean just kind of
[2:00:38] makes me a little scared like man
[2:00:39] where's the end of that ocean at you
[2:00:40] know back a lake I can see the other
[2:00:42] side and it's pretty you know I like
[2:00:44] that and said whatever you like it will
[2:00:47] be there for you
[2:00:49] because he designed it with you in
[2:00:54] mind now the measurements new see we're
[2:00:56] making good ground
[2:00:57] 133 out of 307 we're almost 150 almost
[2:01:01] halfway there so the measurements now
[2:01:04] the Bible says this the city's four
[2:01:06] squares so the foundation's in a square
[2:01:09] and it's 12,000 furlongs the length and
[2:01:12] bread of the height of it are equal so
[2:01:14] length width and height are all
[2:01:17] equal butam says see we find out it's
[2:01:19] 1500
[2:01:21] square see plenty of room it'll be
[2:01:25] renovated that's true by the fire
[2:01:27] there'll be no more Seas there's plenty
[2:01:28] of room for a city this large because
[2:01:30] there's no more sea there see and I'm
[2:01:32] kind of scared of seas I just realized
[2:01:34] that that's why God's gonna take it
[2:01:35] away glory amen I like that Revelation
[2:01:39] 211 I saw a new Heaven new Earth for the
[2:01:41] first and the first Heaven vers Earth
[2:01:43] were passed away and there was no more
[2:01:45] sea because God loves me amen
[2:01:50] Hallelujah now look if you go on Google
[2:01:52] you can type in the calculations from
[2:01:54] furlongs to Miles and look 12,000
[2:01:56] furlongs is exactly, 1500 square miles
[2:02:01] brother Ram did his homework he got
[2:02:03] exactly right yeah praise God brother
[2:02:06] said God showed him the new city just
[2:02:08] wasn't something I like to study this
[2:02:09] this week God showed him that new city
[2:02:11] in a
[2:02:13] vision you know how far it would reach I
[2:02:15] measured off this week it would reach
[2:02:17] from Maine to Florida and from the
[2:02:19] Eastern Seaboard to 600 miles past west
[2:02:22] of the
[2:02:23] Mississippi you say there ain't no room
[2:02:26] when the Sea's gone there will
[2:02:28] be because nearly four fifths of the
[2:02:31] earth is in water but remember the sea
[2:02:34] is gone there's United States I just did
[2:02:37] a Google search I said from the capital
[2:02:39] Maine forget the capital Maine now to
[2:02:41] Capital Florida I forget that too but I
[2:02:42] did a search and it was
[2:02:45] uh almost 1600 miles from Capital to
[2:02:48] Capital
[2:02:50] okay but the city
[2:02:52] is500 yeah so subtract 100 miles off of
[2:02:55] my drawing there you understand what I'm
[2:02:58] saying this and look here's here's the
[2:03:00] Mississippi right here there you go
[2:03:02] there's Mississippi 600 miles past the
[2:03:05] Mississippi that's how big your home is
[2:03:08] the
[2:03:09] Lord 1500 I'm sorry 12,000 furlongs or
[2:03:14] 1500
[2:03:15] miles so if you look on Earth it's about
[2:03:18] that big
[2:03:20] it's not that big is it compared to the
[2:03:21] rest of the earth it's a little little
[2:03:24] crown on top of that Earth little Crown
[2:03:28] the wife is the crown of the husband is
[2:03:29] that right that's exactly that's the
[2:03:31] word of God church now really we know
[2:03:33] though it's going to be over by
[2:03:35] Israel okay so it's not gonna be on the
[2:03:37] US that's where brother brother if you
[2:03:40] listen to questions answer 64 a lot of
[2:03:42] questions about is the new city going to
[2:03:44] be in Jeffersonville is the new city
[2:03:45] going to be in America do we have to
[2:03:46] move to Jeffersonville brother BR said
[2:03:48] you misunderstood and they did they
[2:03:49] misunderstand him he said while he was
[2:03:51] studying it he rejoiced because he
[2:03:53] realized all the people that traveled to
[2:03:55] his church travel from about 1500
[2:03:59] miles yeah he said from Alabam up to
[2:04:01] Jeffersonville and Colorado across the
[2:04:03] Jefferson he said oh my his starts
[2:04:05] crying he said he said they come from
[2:04:07] the East and West amen they come from
[2:04:09] the lands of the far to die with his
[2:04:11] Kings to Feast with his guest how
[2:04:13] blessed his pilgrims are
[2:04:15] amen
[2:04:17] glory that's how our church is they come
[2:04:19] from the East and the West don't they
[2:04:21] Wendy comes from the West the AL saints
[2:04:22] come from the East they come from the
[2:04:25] East and West whenever I share out with
[2:04:27] people you have people in church that
[2:04:29] drive two hours they're like what I
[2:04:31] wonder if they start wonder what kind of
[2:04:33] things do you preach just this Bible
[2:04:35] right here just that's all I preach just
[2:04:36] this Bible and if I Don't Preach
[2:04:38] something in this Bible I'll repent of
[2:04:40] it praise God hallelujah he said the
[2:04:44] bread and the height are the same he
[2:04:47] said 1500 miles of tra transparent
[2:04:51] gold the Bible says the city's Four
[2:04:53] Square the length and the breadth and
[2:04:55] the height of it thereof and the city
[2:04:57] was pure gold like unto clear
[2:05:01] glass now the city must be a pyramid
[2:05:04] right can't be a cube right brother B
[2:05:08] tells us why makes really good sense
[2:05:10] right it's logical we'd
[2:05:12] say most people think it's a cube
[2:05:15] because they see four square but it's
[2:05:17] impossible to be a cube if not there's
[2:05:19] going to be a lot of Shadows right right
[2:05:21] if the new cities a cub there's going to
[2:05:22] be a lot of Shadows on the earth and
[2:05:24] people won't be able to walk in the
[2:05:26] light amen Church won't be able to walk
[2:05:29] in the light if it's a cube so it can't
[2:05:32] be a cube it's got to be a pyramid but
[2:05:35] now that don't mean it's necessarily a
[2:05:36] cube or Square there's another
[2:05:38] geographical measure that the dimensions
[2:05:40] are the same and that's a pyramid let me
[2:05:44] draw it brother draws it said notice the
[2:05:46] dimensions the angle the same all of
[2:05:48] them length by height there's another
[2:05:50] measure the pyramid proves it so it
[2:05:51] can't be this it's got to be
[2:05:54] that both are for square because the
[2:05:57] base of the pyramid is Four Square all
[2:06:00] four measurements are all the same
[2:06:03] praise God but now he
[2:06:06] says see you got to have that City it's
[2:06:08] a Holy Mountain remember the Bible calls
[2:06:10] it my Holy Mountain Glory when have you
[2:06:13] ever seen a cube-shaped Mountain church
[2:06:16] it's IR logical cubes are always
[2:06:18] mountains pyramid shaped is that
[2:06:21] right then he quotes uh Isaiah 65 they
[2:06:25] shall not harm or destroy and all my
[2:06:26] Holy Mountain the city is not a cube
[2:06:29] it's a mountain so it's just a great
[2:06:31] Mountain like the pyramid the city is on
[2:06:34] the
[2:06:35] mountain a city on a mountain a mountain
[2:06:39] on top of a mountain a pyramid on top of
[2:06:42] a pyramid and the church said amen
[2:06:45] that's how God wants his final City to
[2:06:47] be a pyramid on top of a
[2:06:50] pyramid oh I love it church I love it
[2:06:52] the throne cannot be seen if the walls
[2:06:55] are straight up and down just like a
[2:06:57] cube so it must be a pyramid brother B
[2:07:00] said said if the walls were straight up
[2:07:02] and down the city could only be seen
[2:07:04] from the outside or the inside so if you
[2:07:06] have a cube and the throne was on top
[2:07:10] you can only see the light if you're
[2:07:11] right inside the cube right inside the
[2:07:13] city he said or from the inside the
[2:07:16] throne can only be seen from the out out
[2:07:18] side if you if you have a pyramid if you
[2:07:22] have a pyramid the Throne of Christ can
[2:07:24] be seen in every
[2:07:25] direction Hallelujah north south east
[2:07:28] and west now brother said the Pyramid of
[2:07:31] Giza which is we know the Pyramid of
[2:07:33] Enoch right because no sinful man could
[2:07:35] build that lasted all these thousands of
[2:07:37] years had to been a man a man of
[2:07:40] God right the py of Giza is a witness of
[2:07:43] the pyramid shaped new city that is to
[2:07:45] come in the earth even its location I
[2:07:47] know the Egyptians came after and they
[2:07:48] decorated all up and there stuff like
[2:07:50] that but before time it was God's
[2:07:52] pyramid is it right because it was a
[2:07:54] witness all throughout all those ages
[2:07:56] that there's a pyramid coming to the
[2:07:59] pyramid Glory it was a witness to all
[2:08:02] the ages that there's statures of
[2:08:04] pyramids that need to be capped off by
[2:08:07] another pyramid amen
[2:08:10] glory and is also witness because the
[2:08:13] the pyramid will the pyramid from Heaven
[2:08:15] the new city will sit down in the Middle
[2:08:17] East right on top of Israel amen so it
[2:08:21] had to be built by a man of God had been
[2:08:23] built by Enoch had to be a pyramid
[2:08:25] because it had to type this new city
[2:08:27] this new pyramid coming from God out of
[2:08:29] heaven and it has to be on the Holy
[2:08:33] Land said this being this way would
[2:08:36] answer exactly Enoch's sign in Egypt did
[2:08:39] you know that that's Enoch's
[2:08:41] sign the pyramid would it Enoch before
[2:08:44] the end to liveing destruction when
[2:08:46] justification come and he brought forth
[2:08:47] the sign and in this pyramid is seven
[2:08:49] steps going to the king's chamber seven
[2:08:51] Church ages I preached on that few years
[2:08:53] ago I have to dig out the notes it's
[2:08:54] been a while sorry about that I don't
[2:08:56] have the notes ready today he said watch
[2:08:58] Whose station it is standing there and
[2:09:00] you'll see the day you're living in the
[2:09:01] pyramid so there's just a general
[2:09:04] there's Cairo and then there's Giza
[2:09:06] that's where the pyramid is there's
[2:09:07] Israel I got my geography right
[2:09:10] everybody okay and there's a picture of
[2:09:12] the real Pyramid of Giza and it's
[2:09:15] sitting right there look how close it is
[2:09:17] to Israel right right now something
[2:09:19] tells me the very center of that pyramid
[2:09:21] will sit right I don't know something
[2:09:23] tells me that I
[2:09:25] imagine right so there the that pyramid
[2:09:29] city is going to sit right
[2:09:31] there now the missing Capstone on Enix
[2:09:34] pyramid types
[2:09:36] Christ right yeah The Headstone so the
[2:09:40] Pyramid of Enoch or Giza is missing the
[2:09:42] headstone because Christ is The
[2:09:44] Headstone and he's not here yet but he's
[2:09:47] coming there's a special spot right for
[2:09:49] him I'll say this a special heart
[2:09:52] special spot right in your
[2:09:54] heart yes there is amen and he's coming
[2:09:57] to cap off that special spot amen and
[2:10:00] Rapture you
[2:10:02] glory Christ is The Headstone who's
[2:10:04] coming to this world to cap the Bride of
[2:10:06] Jesus Christ at the
[2:10:08] Rapture that is a sign in Egypt to let
[2:10:11] everyone know there's coming a headstone
[2:10:13] to Cap all the Believers in Jesus Christ
[2:10:17] that is the sign
[2:10:18] Enoch sign to the whole
[2:10:23] world all the rest of the stones in the
[2:10:25] pyramid are laying so perfect you
[2:10:26] couldn't run a razor blade between them
[2:10:28] weighing tons now when the pyramid cap
[2:10:31] does come the pyramid itself the body of
[2:10:33] Christ will have to be H now see he's
[2:10:35] typing that pyramid to the body of
[2:10:37] Christ and this is from statue perfect
[2:10:38] man which we've been preaching
[2:10:40] on see not only some Creed or some
[2:10:43] Doctrine it'll have to be so perfectly
[2:10:45] like Christ till when he comes he in
[2:10:47] that min ministry will fit right smack
[2:10:49] together then will come the Rapture the
[2:10:51] going home so Christ can't come down to
[2:10:54] cap off our our bride Church our pyramid
[2:10:58] bride church until our ministry looks
[2:10:59] just like
[2:11:01] Christ his was so humble people didn't
[2:11:03] know it was the Messiah was so humble
[2:11:05] that's why I don't mind having a humble
[2:11:07] Ministry but I am looking for more power
[2:11:11] right I'm thankful for the power I've
[2:11:12] seen but I am looking for more
[2:11:14] Power
[2:11:16] Glory Jesus Stand The Headstone on the
[2:11:20] throne when his Saints is Crown Him King
[2:11:22] of Kings Lord of Lord and he's The
[2:11:27] Headstone are you with me so Christ is
[2:11:30] tight by that missing headstone we're
[2:11:32] looking for a headstone we're looking
[2:11:33] for
[2:11:35] Christ now the Great Seal on a dollar
[2:11:38] bill is also a witness of the Rapture
[2:11:40] and the new
[2:11:42] city now I've been preaching an hour
[2:11:44] right now so I usually preach hour and a
[2:11:47] half I'll try not to honestly I'll try
[2:11:49] not to go sorry uh future home I don't
[2:11:51] have my pocketbook he says but get out
[2:11:53] of United States an eagle on the end see
[2:11:56] they didn't know what they were doing
[2:11:57] now they didn't put that that pyramid on
[2:11:59] there uh as a Christian thing they just
[2:12:01] did it because of Freemasonry or
[2:12:03] whatever I'm not a conspiracy theorist
[2:12:05] but I do believe there's a lot of
[2:12:06] conspiracies out there I do believe they
[2:12:08] a lot of them worship the devil I do
[2:12:09] believe that but see brother said they
[2:12:11] didn't even know what they were doing
[2:12:14] it's wrote in Latin the Great Seal
[2:12:16] neither did Caiaphas know he was
[2:12:18] prophesying when he said one man must
[2:12:20] die for the entire nation so brother
[2:12:23] said that when they made that dollar
[2:12:25] bill they were prophesying with that
[2:12:27] this is a prophecy whether they knew it
[2:12:29] or not Hallelujah so this annuate cotius
[2:12:35] is he has favored our undertakings and
[2:12:37] hasn't God blessed our nation Church
[2:12:39] they didn't even know what they they
[2:12:40] might have been Freemasons I don't care
[2:12:41] what they were God's hand was still with
[2:12:43] the Christians in this nation I don't
[2:12:45] care what they put on the dollar bill
[2:12:46] it's what God's putting on our heart
[2:12:48] that's why God's favored us amen and
[2:12:51] here it says the Great Seal like brother
[2:12:53] said now this right here novas Oro seum
[2:12:57] that means the New Order of the ages
[2:12:59] yeah we know the New Order is on there
[2:13:00] but didn't it start a good order where
[2:13:02] the the the gospel could be presented
[2:13:03] and preach to the United States and God
[2:13:05] could raise up a prophet out of this
[2:13:06] country Glory Hallelujah is that right
[2:13:11] and there's that that number right there
[2:13:12] is that
[2:13:13] 1776 the Roman numerals I know that's
[2:13:17] the Illuminati eye or whatever more but
[2:13:19] brother M said it's God that represents
[2:13:21] God
[2:13:22] too they use that symbol for evil but
[2:13:25] really it can be used for
[2:13:26] good just like brother said that uh
[2:13:29] remember the snake on a pole for all the
[2:13:30] doctors that actual symbol is a pagan
[2:13:33] symbol but they copied off of God's
[2:13:35] symbol amen look it up that healing
[2:13:39] symbol is actually a pagan but they
[2:13:41] stole it from
[2:13:42] Moses because that was Christ judged and
[2:13:45] if you look at Christ's judgment on
[2:13:47] Calvary if you look and live you shall
[2:13:49] be healed amen glory but they stole it
[2:13:53] just like they stole the
[2:13:55] pyramid that do mean I'm not gonna touch
[2:13:57] a dollar bill I'll I'll take a dollar
[2:13:58] bill I'll work my tail off for them so I
[2:14:01] can feed my little
[2:14:02] babies
[2:14:05] right yes sir there's the Great Seal
[2:14:08] here it is the city it's not a flat Cube
[2:14:11] but it leans so it can be seen what kind
[2:14:14] of God would clean off the Earth and not
[2:14:16] want to be seen by all the inhabitants
[2:14:17] of it
[2:14:18] hide himself up there in his little Cube
[2:14:20] home oh what are they doing down there I
[2:14:22] don't know what are they doing down
[2:14:25] there like here got got a cube here
[2:14:28] God's G like
[2:14:29] this better check on brother Jesse there
[2:14:32] I wonder what's he doing
[2:14:33] today but instead it's a pyan so every
[2:14:36] direction he looks it's all his children
[2:14:38] all around him Hallelujah 360 degrees of
[2:14:43] light coming everywhere light from every
[2:14:45] angle that's my God that's his throne
[2:14:47] and we're his people
[2:14:49] amen
[2:14:54] glory and upon this Holy Mountain the
[2:14:56] Lord should be descend upon his holy
[2:14:58] mountain here he is that's the reason
[2:15:00] the Capstone wasn't put on by
[2:15:02] Enoch see that's the reason the Capone
[2:15:04] has to come now the mount will be pushed
[2:15:06] up and it'll be the mountain of the
[2:15:09] Lord did you catch that but B said the
[2:15:12] Earth will have to push up a mountain to
[2:15:14] receive the
[2:15:16] city
[2:15:18] this is struggles people sometimes
[2:15:20] that's why I'm going to go a little bit
[2:15:21] slower now everybody take a deep breath
[2:15:23] ready I tell my children in that class
[2:15:26] yeah tell them to take a deep breath
[2:15:27] because I know it resets their system
[2:15:28] but also resets mine Mr Smith Mr Smith
[2:15:31] about 50 questions in one minute
[2:15:32] sometimes I'm like children take a deep
[2:15:35] breath so I'm back to that tomorrow so
[2:15:37] you pray for me tomorrow I'm really
[2:15:38] gonna need your prayers tomorrow I got
[2:15:40] two weeks off the new city which is a
[2:15:42] holy mountain will sit on this
[2:15:46] mountain yeah in the earth time of
[2:15:48] purifying baptism will F there will be
[2:15:50] volcanic such as this earth exploding
[2:15:53] and will push up a pyramid like
[2:15:56] Mountain see plenty of room to do it
[2:16:00] this whole thing will be changed the
[2:16:01] whole surface will be changed you got it
[2:16:03] it'll push up a pyramid like
[2:16:07] mountain now actually my drawing isn't
[2:16:09] very good in a moment you'll see I I
[2:16:11] have like a rectangular prism draw
[2:16:13] Mountain so that forgive me I that's my
[2:16:15] fault I didn't even think about that
[2:16:18] said this would be exactly with the word
[2:16:20] if it does which it will Isaiah 65:25
[2:16:24] they shall not hurt or destroy and all
[2:16:25] my Holy Mountain now look at the
[2:16:28] elevation of Israel and Egypt look at
[2:16:31] the variation elevation you have Mount
[2:16:32] Si up here your Mount Lebanon over here
[2:16:35] look how look at the crazy elevation and
[2:16:36] you have the Dead Sea you have the gulf
[2:16:39] Gulf of Suez look at this different
[2:16:41] elevation and God said I'm going to
[2:16:42] raise me I can't put a mountain on top
[2:16:44] of that so I got to raise up a mountain
[2:16:46] amen reminds me of John the Baptist how
[2:16:48] The Valleys will be made level all the
[2:16:51] mountains will be brought down amen so
[2:16:53] here's what we got now this is my silly
[2:16:55] drawing here this is my computer 101
[2:16:58] drawing here not a computer programmer
[2:17:01] but see now this should have been a
[2:17:03] pyramid so forgive me it should have
[2:17:04] gone out like this that's where I made
[2:17:06] the mistake it's a pyramid on top of a
[2:17:08] pyramid so forgive me your pastor made a
[2:17:09] mistake if I'm your pastor forgive me I
[2:17:11] know we have some visitors I'm not your
[2:17:12] pastor but I made a
[2:17:14] mistake so God has to raise that up when
[2:17:17] he's burned with fire or something
[2:17:19] brother something there around there God
[2:17:21] has to raise up a mountain to receive a
[2:17:23] mountain and it might be higher than
[2:17:24] that I just drew it a small one because
[2:17:26] we could I just wanted you to see the
[2:17:27] general picture all right okay then the
[2:17:29] mountain or then the pyramid comes down
[2:17:31] and sits upon that mountain it's a
[2:17:32] mountain on top of a
[2:17:35] mountain so the new city is a mountain
[2:17:38] on top of a mountain they ask brother BR
[2:17:40] would you please explain Isaiah 2
[2:17:44] ver2 now I have it up here for you but
[2:17:47] brother BR says yes I did already
[2:17:50] explain that the Sunday before last
[2:17:52] that's brother BR what about this
[2:17:53] mountain in Isaiah
[2:17:55] 2:2 said I already explained it last
[2:17:58] week uh the house of the Lord shall be
[2:18:00] established in the top of the mountains
[2:18:02] and all the nations shall flow into it
[2:18:04] if you haven't w got the tape on the
[2:18:05] bride and the bridegroom suure home
[2:18:07] explains it exactly that way so if you
[2:18:08] got your Bibles Isaiah 2 verse one the
[2:18:12] word that Isaiah the son of Amos saw
[2:18:13] concerning Judah and Jerusalem and it
[2:18:15] should come to pass in the last days
[2:18:17] that the mountain of the Lord's house
[2:18:19] shall be established in the top of the
[2:18:21] mountains amen it's right there the
[2:18:25] mountain on top of the mountains it's
[2:18:27] exactly
[2:18:29] scriptural and shall be exalted above
[2:18:31] the hills and All Nations shall flow
[2:18:33] into it did we have a word-based prophet
[2:18:35] or not Church everything I've tried to
[2:18:38] show you off the year I took you back to
[2:18:40] the
[2:18:41] word that's what you have to do with
[2:18:42] hard subjects like we're talking about
[2:18:44] theophanies afterwards I'm just going to
[2:18:46] prepare you a little bit for the
[2:18:46] theophany message message if I preach
[2:18:48] something against your thinking that I
[2:18:49] don't mean to I just try to find what's
[2:18:51] found in the Bible and what matches that
[2:18:54] in the quotes yeah if I can't find a
[2:18:57] match I'll say I don't know right
[2:18:59] because I don't
[2:19:00] know I'm not God I don't know but if
[2:19:03] brother Ram lays down the scripture and
[2:19:05] with the quotes and it makes sense then
[2:19:06] praise the
[2:19:08] Lord but let me say this if it's a
[2:19:10] belief you have and it raise your faith
[2:19:12] and praise the
[2:19:13] Lord I don't want to hurt anybody's
[2:19:16] faith but we are to get rid of every
[2:19:18] tradition that's not of God but I'm not
[2:19:20] saying your tradition I'm just saying if
[2:19:22] if anything I believe is against the
[2:19:23] word let's forget it and let's just
[2:19:24] accept the word I just want to prepare
[2:19:26] everybody because I know you know we
[2:19:27] Kevin and I were talking sunny and I
[2:19:28] Wendy and I were talking and so there's
[2:19:30] a lot of different thoughts about theop
[2:19:31] and things like that so I just want to
[2:19:32] PR prepare everybody just know if I
[2:19:34] preach anything come ask me about it I
[2:19:37] want to be approachable I want to be
[2:19:39] humble and be able to repent if I'm
[2:19:41] wrong but if I'm right that I want to
[2:19:43] say praise the Lord the Lord showed me
[2:19:44] the right thing I didn't get in the
[2:19:46] flesh on that one okay I just want to do
[2:19:48] the best I can so there's light at the
[2:19:51] top of this mountain and it's typed by
[2:19:53] Si Mount siai when Moses went on top of
[2:19:56] the mountain and mount Transfiguration
[2:19:58] when Jesus was on top of the
[2:20:00] mount okay because the Bible says this
[2:20:02] Revelation 21:23 the city had no need of
[2:20:04] the sun neither the moon to shine in it
[2:20:06] for the glory of God did lighten it and
[2:20:08] the lamb is the light
[2:20:11] thereof said notice Mount Si was where
[2:20:14] God descended on top of it when he spoke
[2:20:16] to Israel a pillar of Fire he descended
[2:20:18] on top of mountain Mount Si so brother
[2:20:20] is typing it so God coming down to meet
[2:20:22] with Moses on top of Mount Si was a type
[2:20:25] of Jesus on top of the new
[2:20:27] city on the mount Transfiguration when
[2:20:30] he declared this is my beloved Son hear
[2:20:32] ye him he descended in the pillar of
[2:20:34] light and Shining brightness on the top
[2:20:36] of the mountain Before Peter James and
[2:20:38] John and represented both his glory with
[2:20:41] Moses and
[2:20:43] Elijah Glory so the light from this
[2:20:46] throne at the top of the mountain
[2:20:49] remember we just read this the lamb is
[2:20:51] the light thereof now look you catch
[2:20:53] that the lamb is the light but look also
[2:20:55] the Bible
[2:20:56] said show me a pure River of Water of
[2:20:59] Life clear as Crystal proceeding out of
[2:21:02] the Throne of God and of the Lamb so the
[2:21:04] throne is the Throne of God and the lamb
[2:21:06] because God is always invisible and the
[2:21:08] lamb is always visible don't forget that
[2:21:11] as we get into those three bodies God
[2:21:13] will always be and forever brother M
[2:21:15] said Jesus's body is the final resting
[2:21:18] place of the Holy Ghost amen glory you
[2:21:22] catch that God will always Jesus body
[2:21:25] will always be the visible image of God
[2:21:27] but God's invisible Spirit cannot be
[2:21:30] seen by man never was seen by man and
[2:21:33] never will be because it's invisible
[2:21:36] it's Eternal but Jesus said when you've
[2:21:38] seen me you've seen the manifestation of
[2:21:40] the father amen glory so the Bible says
[2:21:44] Throne of God and lamb it's not two
[2:21:46] Thrones it's one
[2:21:48] Throne where the spirit dwells in the
[2:21:51] sun and the sun rules for all eternity
[2:21:56] amen you can't get that mixed up you
[2:22:00] always got to have God perfects
[2:22:02] everything in
[2:22:03] threes Body Soul Spirit even God is
[2:22:06] perfected in Body Soul spirit in the
[2:22:08] body of
[2:22:09] Christ that's why God cannot be three
[2:22:11] persons I tell my children that at bible
[2:22:12] studied a few nights ago to have three
[2:22:14] persons listen you got to have three I
[2:22:17] wish had three more fingers up here
[2:22:19] brother Jose come on up here put up
[2:22:21] three fingers right here to have three
[2:22:22] persons you got a body Soul Spirit Body
[2:22:24] Soul Spirit Body Soul Spirit there's
[2:22:26] your Trinity three
[2:22:28] persons right is that right you have to
[2:22:32] but in Jesus the Bible said he had Body
[2:22:34] Soul Spirit and the Bible said in him
[2:22:36] dwell the fullness of the godhead bodily
[2:22:39] all that the godhead was was in those
[2:22:41] three parts and the church said let's
[2:22:43] give our brother round Applause here
[2:22:44] thank you
[2:22:45] sir that's right I told my children to
[2:22:48] have three persons you have to have
[2:22:50] three you have to have nine
[2:22:52] parts that's paganism that's tritheism
[2:22:56] brother said trinitarianism is of the
[2:22:58] devil thus sayith the Lord
[2:23:01] amen and it teaches he heathenism
[2:23:04] paganism polytheism it's a lie from the
[2:23:07] pit of Hell don't believe that God is
[2:23:10] one and his name is Jesus Christ am amen
[2:23:13] he said when you've seen me you've seen
[2:23:14] the
[2:23:15] father go like I challenged those
[2:23:18] trinitarians at one time I said show me
[2:23:20] one scripture where you have an old man
[2:23:22] a young man and a dove all sitting on a
[2:23:23] throne in heaven show me one you will
[2:23:25] never find one right because that's
[2:23:28] tritheism that's paganism that's how
[2:23:30] they draw the beautiful paintings in the
[2:23:32] Vatican and stuff like that I've seen
[2:23:34] them at least on the internet I've never
[2:23:36] been there myself you see them they draw
[2:23:38] old man a young man and a dove that's
[2:23:40] that's
[2:23:41] paganism that's heathenism there's one
[2:23:44] God and when you've seen him you've seen

[2:24:08] class understand it you knowen I am a
[2:24:11] teacher but I'm not going to make this a
[2:24:13] class it's just funny that brother calls
[2:24:15] this congregation as class
[2:24:17] during the Seven Seals he says that okay
[2:24:19] so the light comes out of the lamb and
[2:24:22] so you have this white radiant light
[2:24:24] proceeding in all directions like I said
[2:24:26] 360 Degrees all around the light
[2:24:28] proceeds from the lamb he is the light
[2:24:30] of the
[2:24:32] world okay oh sorry I forgot to flash

[2:24:48] 1500 miles high the whole world will see
[2:24:50] the light of the world Jesus sitting on
[2:24:52] the throne on top of the world top of
[2:24:54] the church top of Mount Zion Glory which
[2:24:58] is 1500 miles half the size of United
[2:25:00] States and raise his Plum up till you
[2:25:02] can see him in the world over 1500 miles
[2:25:05] high there he is I'm closing with this
[2:25:08] now look at brother says
[2:25:10] next brother Bram said there is a pillar
[2:25:12] of fire hovering over his head as he
[2:25:15] sits on the throne
[2:25:18] does that surprise you we've had a
[2:25:20] pillar of fire in our day above a
[2:25:22] prophet William brandom that surprise
[2:25:25] you says on the top of the mount will
[2:25:27] set the lamb the city will need no light
[2:25:30] for the lamb is the light of the city
[2:25:33] thereof and above the lamb will be the
[2:25:35] father which is the
[2:25:37] logos God the great light the Eternal
[2:25:39] Light that'll just shine above the
[2:25:41] throne and Jesus will not be on the
[2:25:43] father's Throne he'll be on his throne
[2:25:46] and the father will hover over the son
[2:25:49] which the father and son will be
[2:25:53] one Hallelujah isn't that beautiful
[2:25:57] church God always letting us know
[2:25:59] through all eternity he is the pillar of
[2:26:02] fire he is God he is Christ Christ and
[2:26:05] the father are one and this answers to
[2:26:08] this at this time the son commited the
[2:26:10] kingdom back to the father brother bar
[2:26:13] tells this in questions answers while
[2:26:15] they're yet speaking I'll answer before
[2:26:16] they can think I'm thinking of them
[2:26:17] that's right Jesus will commit a perfect
[2:26:20] age to the perfect Living God that he
[2:26:22] has redeemed and given over to the
[2:26:23] fathers that right will turn to God the
[2:26:25] Father which is Spirit not a man
[2:26:28] spirit all nature of goodness gathered
[2:26:31] together that's God the city with the
[2:26:33] throne in the top and he is ascended up
[2:26:36] on the throne that perfect Kingdom the
[2:26:38] time when the kingdom that Jesus is to
[2:26:41] surrender to the father that God might
[2:26:44] be all in all do you know the Bible
[2:26:46] taught that
[2:26:48] Jesus Reigns through the Millennium as
[2:26:49] son of David when the new city comes
[2:26:52] Jesus gives the kingdom back to the
[2:26:54] father amen that's right well that's the
[2:26:57] Bible take out your Bibles let's close
[2:26:59] to
[2:27:00] this you know your Bible this is 1
[2:27:03] Corinthians 15 is a powerful chapter
[2:27:05] yeah it's got the new it's got the new
[2:27:08] Earth a new city and the Rapture all in
[2:27:10] it Mer but every man his own order
[2:27:13] Christ the first fruits after they that
[2:27:15] are Christ that is coming then cometh
[2:27:17] the end so the End of Time
[2:27:20] Glory the end of time is this when he
[2:27:23] shall delivered up the kingdom to God
[2:27:25] even the father so when this visible son
[2:27:30] Returns the kingdom back to the father
[2:27:32] other words say now it's all in your
[2:27:34] control
[2:27:36] father oh my when he shall put down all
[2:27:40] Rule and all authority so look he's
[2:27:42] ruling and has all authority over all
[2:27:43] the earth now he's ruling the nation
[2:27:46] with a rod of
[2:27:48] iron oh for he must reain till he have
[2:27:52] put all enemies under his feet so after
[2:27:55] the white Throne judgment all enemies
[2:27:57] are put under his feet glory to God all
[2:28:00] demons are judged they're thrown the
[2:28:01] Lake of Fire all everyone's under his
[2:28:04] authority and now he comes upon the new
[2:28:06] Earth and he reigns until all enemies
[2:28:09] are under his feet now as son of
[2:28:13] David the last many that will be
[2:28:15] destroyed is death
[2:28:17] at the end of the white Throne judgment
[2:28:19] death is cast in Lake of Fire how many
[2:28:20] know
[2:28:22] that for he ha put all things under his
[2:28:24] feet so see that eternal spirit allowed
[2:28:26] that body of that son when he saith all
[2:28:29] things are put under him it is Manifest
[2:28:31] that he is expected which did put all
[2:28:33] things under him and when all things
[2:28:35] shall be subdued unto him then shall
[2:28:37] also the son also be subject unto him
[2:28:41] that put all things under him that God
[2:28:45] may be all in all yes remember Jesus
[2:28:48] said after his resurrection Matthew
[2:28:49] 28919 he said all power and authority is
[2:28:52] given unto
[2:28:53] me right and now he goes back to the
[2:28:58] father and said okay I've done what you
[2:28:59] asked me to do now the kingdom is back
[2:29:02] for your it's all
[2:29:04] yours are you with me Church yeah amen
[2:29:07] that's a great mystery I'm not even
[2:29:09] pretending sister marel to understand
[2:29:10] that all the way I'm not even going to
[2:29:11] pretend to do that I don't but I know
[2:29:13] that's what the Bible said see because
[2:29:15] God must Reign Over everything even that
[2:29:17] Creative Body of his
[2:29:19] son is that
[2:29:21] right to him that overcometh will I
[2:29:23] grant to sit with me in my throne even
[2:29:26] also as I overcame and sat down with my
[2:29:27] father in his
[2:29:30] throne Isaiah 6524 it should come to
[2:29:33] pass that before they call I will answer
[2:29:36] and while they yet speaking I will hear
[2:29:38] the wolf and the lamb shall feed

[2:42:35] use them brother B said you'll be
[2:42:36] responsible reason he said most people
[2:42:38] can't manifest gifts is because he can't
[2:42:39] trust him yet yeah so God help us to be
[2:42:42] trustworthy is that right that's true am
[2:42:46] so you put a one by John if you think
[2:42:48] he's the most gifted a two by Andy a one
[2:42:50] by me or rting somebody else if you
[2:42:51] think so put a two by the second most
[2:42:53] gifted and a third by the third most
[2:42:56] gifted okay at the bottom this is for
[2:42:59] all the members now if you want to
[2:43:00] request an interview with me to discuss
[2:43:02] questions just put a check there sign
[2:43:03] your name we can talk you feel someone's
[2:43:06] not qualified for one of these so John
[2:43:08] bang and I or Andy let us
[2:43:11] know uh I feel someone new might be
[2:43:13] qualified let me know put a check there
[2:43:16] now the last one everyone has to check I
[2:43:17] feel I complet this ballot with
[2:43:18] sincerity based upon my leadership of
[2:43:20] the Holy Spirit and sign your
[2:43:22] name now um also the last thing is um
[2:43:27] tithing if you're not a tither uh then I
[2:43:29] ask if you don't tithe then just filling
[2:43:31] this part from the bottom down because
[2:43:34] we're not going to count votes of people
[2:43:35] that uh don't pay ties because they're
[2:43:37] not official members according to the
[2:43:38] bylaws and according to brother Brandon
[2:43:40] so they can't vote on these things uh
[2:43:43] but if you don't pay ties just do from
[2:43:44] here on down I would would like their
[2:43:45] their I would like their feedback and
[2:43:47] their advice on who they think is most
[2:43:48] gifted in the spirit though I would like
[2:43:50] that okay and then if you need any
[2:43:52] counsel from me or anything like that
[2:43:53] but tith pairs only brother bam said
[2:43:55] ties are
[2:43:57] Eternal We'll preach on that in part two
[2:43:59] tonight it's on uh the Kings the brother
[2:44:01] B said the kings bring their Glory and
[2:44:04] Honor into the the new city and brother
[2:44:06] B said that's ties and offerings because
[2:44:09] ties and offerings are
[2:44:11] Eternal so TI tithers can do the whole
[2:44:14] thing those that don't tithe just start
[2:44:16] from here and go down by God's
[2:44:18] grace okay so brother van can you put on
