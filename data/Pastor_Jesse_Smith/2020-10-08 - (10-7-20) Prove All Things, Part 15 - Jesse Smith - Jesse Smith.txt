continue on proving all things part 15 tonight acts 17 verse one we're getting closer and closer to getting done with this debate here but i'd like to keep it going by god's grace i got a couple of texts and emails from people that were really enjoying it so i would like to keep on that i had a pastor from connecticut called me and said he's really blessed by it and then a brother from south carolina i'm sorry now he lives in virginia so they're both texting about it saying what a great blessing it was so praise god let's uh go to acts 17 uh one i think we'll skip verse one there's just some hard uh city names in there that's gonna read verse two and three i wasn't gonna i read it on sunday i wasn't really ready for it so i was doing my best but acts 17 2 and 3. let's try those and we'll read those together and we'll look at the scriptures here tonight by god's grace let's read those uh two and three the three does on three one two three and paul as his manner was went in unto them and three sabbath days reason with them out of the scriptures opening and alleging that christ must needs have suffered and risen again from the dead and that this jesus whom i preach unto you is christ let's have one more word of prayer if you ever need on your heart let's make another god your heavenly father we love you god we bless your holy name we're falling in love with you more and more jesus father speak to us tonight help us tonight lord god strengthen us lord establish our hearts make us more solid in the truth of god and thank you that we've always been accepted in your word we are the children of the blessed we're not cursed we're blessed and we thank you for that and lord we hang our souls upon your promises your mercy your salvation in jesus christ's name and the saint said amen god bless you as being seated praise god so let's uh go on my my wife gave me a gentle reminder that i i've been trying to preach 35 or 40 minutes on wednesday night so i would try to do that uh i forgot last week i think i preached about an hour 15 or 20 last wednesday night so forgive me um let me do a 40 minute timer there we go we'll see how this goes tonight by the grace of the lord so we look let's look at part 15 tonight by god's grace uh i wanna if you would uh let's just look at a few great definitions here paul open and a ledge you never think about those words there open is open the mind or cause somebody to understand so paul three sunday or three saturdays in a row was trying to get people to open their minds you ever feel like that you're trying to get your family to open their mind would you you know i think we do it all the time right we think my what what avenue or what angle could i try to take with my friends or my family to try to get them to think about the message right to get to think about the truth that's what paul was doing paul was using the scripture and he was trying to open their mind to look look what look at this little scripture here look at look at this and this morning i was actually working on i'm actually going to change my document real quick uh this morning i was looking on it and there were so many old testament scriptures that pointed to god opening the gospel to the gentiles david wrote of it twice david said twice all nations will worship the lord isaiah said it five times that there would be a great light to the gentiles amen he said he said the root of jesse he said would bring rest to the gentiles the bible said to uh to to the messiah would the gentiles seek for rest praise god amen hallelujah foretold that was 800 years maybe 900 years before the messiah uh isaiah said the jesus would or the messiah would bring judgment to the gentiles and he said in isaiah 49 that uh the jesus or i'm sorry that god would bring a light to the gentiles in isaiah 6 60 verse 3 uh the bible said god would show light unto the people and to the gentiles praise god and hosea the bible said that god would offer salvation to the gentiles jeremiah also said so look there's four prophets already uh you have david isaiah hosea and jeremiah jeremiah said the gentiles shall know the lord and in his name should will the gentiles trust in the name of the lord amen ah just and so paul can you imagine paul was citing some of those in his letters he was citing hosea he was signing isaiah he was citing these men trying to get them to open their mind would you just open your mind and try to understand that these are scriptures jesus fulfilled remember how many believe did everybody believe no some believe i'm glad i'm one of those some praise god i'm some of those that believe the message of this day with thus saith the lord amen i'm glad i'm one of them i'm glad the lord could open my mind praise god amen that god could open my mind through brother bran's preaching and brother craig's teaching and brother brooks is preaching amen i'm glad god could open my mind through those brothers amen and cause me to understand what god promised for this day he promised it like the days of noah he promised it like the days of lot that there would be a son of man in the end times to restore all things praise god i'm glad amen that he showed it to me my mind could be open and he could cause me to understand now alleging is more simple just means explaining so paul had to explain here's what isaiah said here's what hosea said and here's here's what jesus did he had to take the scripture and he had to try to convince him and show that jesus needed to suffer jesus had to be the suffering servant of isaiah 53 and he had to rise again he had to defeat death and he said this is the man i'm preaching unto you praise god now i want to just give an example and i i think i mentioned it on sunday i just never got to it and i thought well i think i'll throw it or not throw it i think i'll place it in here tonight so everybody can see this uh how important it is to rightly divide the word of truth now on the debate the brother said if you believe william branham is a prophet you have to believe everything he said to be a follower of him i said no i don't i don't have to believe everything he said i got to believe what he said as it's vindicated in the word of god right i don't have to believe everything he said but i've got to believe what he said from the word that's what i've got to believe praise god and it's got to be back the bible he said test me by the word but the man said prove all things test me by the word and he said and he said uh any doctrine has to have two or three witnesses praise god and so we've done we've done what brother graham told us to do test him by the word prove all things make sure in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word is established praise god see how they try to pin you in a corner well you got to believe everything no i don't the bible never said you had to believe everything elijah said you never had to leave everything moses said thank god thank god we don't have to believe everything abraham said because he lied right we we don't have to believe that sarah's not what wasn't his uh wife right we don't have to believe that although he told that to the king of egypt and we don't have to believe everything he said we just got to believe what he said with thus saith the lord and the word right so let me give you an example now i've heard numerous preachers preach i said i'm not bastion preachers i love preachers especially those well those that preach the truth but everybody makes mistakes i make mistakes as a preacher but look i've heard many people i've heard numerous preachers even here at our church over the years read this quote now i wonder how many of us said amen well after tonight i don't think you'll say amen if anybody reads this quote anymore at least these words in the quote these words by faith you're saved that's that's your faith in god amen the blood keeps you clean from sin because it makes a sacrifice amen the blood doesn't save you i don't say amen to that the blood the blood keeps you clean i'll say amen to that but i can't say amen to that right and church i listened to i went back and listened to it last saturday when i was studying brotherham says that he says the blood doesn't save you it only keeps you clean now look what his reasoning see he must have read this somewhere because it sounds okay but it's not all the truth he says how you say you're saved by faith you're saved and that by foreknowledge god calling you now that's true right because you're predestinated god knew you'd believe by faith so god predestinated you would be saved right that's true you are saved and the blood makes an atonement that's true amen constantly keeping you clean amen and then by one spirit you're baptized in the holy ghost into the fellowship of the believers amen in the fellowship of the holy spirit amen to be led by the spirit amen doing signs and wonders amen so i can say amen to almost everything in that quote except that little phrase the blood doesn't save you and i've had preachers here preach that i thought now i i'll just be silent in that in those times i'll be silent you might be silent uh because i was telling you that i was listening to the message communion his last sermon now really wasn't even a sermon brother perry greene preached and brother ram comes up he and brother branham serves communion and they record him talking for i think it was like 27 minutes so listen to it if you get a chance so i was listening brother said on the same basis we could absolutely justify the salvation army they do not believe in any form of water baptism and said we don't need it now if we don't need water baptism why are you baptized said the water can't save you the blood saves you i'll agree with that how you doing sister god bless you so look so brother adam says in his very last recorded uh talk i'll say like that brother adam said the blood saves you okay so brother man makes this argument with salvation army but man the salvation army said you don't need baptism the brotherhood says because the salvation army says water saves you you know you know they say that you're saved by going to the water the water saves you can you imagine that the water at their pool saves you can you imagine but that's what salvation army believe you gotta you gotta go to the water and brother man's argument is the water don't save you the what saves you well i i thought he just said the blood don't save you isn't that what he just said the blood done satan so see church as a as a student of the message like you are too you are too if you listen to it and study it and you compare thoughts and as a student of the message brother said the blood doesn't save you but then at the end of his message he says the blood does save you and church there's many other scores of quotes where he says the blood saves you it's just that one quote from uh adoption so he must have been studying he must have read like a different author or something like that and he just must have tried he was he was majoring a little bit on ephesians 2 8 where you're saved by grace through faith he was kind of too hard on that and for some reason he said the blood doesn't save you but then many many other times when ram said the man says the water doesn't save you the blood saves you i'll agree with that that's right the blood saves you not the water so i got an email back you know from brother joseph branham a few weeks ago uh and he said i believe every word on tape so brother joseph believes the blood doesn't save you and the blood does save you because i wrote him back i said well which one do you believe and he don't email me back now so see when it comes down they'll say general things but when it comes down to giving a real yes or no answer whether no they'll be wrong they don't even write you back when you try to when you finally pin them in a corner and say uh is billy paul the joseph are you the joseph see you later we'll talk about it same thing that's just i'm not comparing well i shouldn't say that i'm gonna skip that uh so see that's all they can say they all they can say is well i believe everything i don't believe everything brother brahms said i believe what brother brahm said as it's backed up by the word of god and the holy spirit right and god almighty in jesus christ praise god which is the one self same person praise god so see you have one that says we're not saved by the blood you know the one that says we are saved by the blood but we must take the water as an outward emotion that an inward work of grace has been done see so we must communion so see church water doesn't say communion doesn't save but jesus says to do it in remembrance of me and he says because it's part of your testimony right when you get to heaven you can stand there and say yes one time i walked down to that lake and my daddy baptized me haven you can say that that's part of your testimony my daddy buried me in the name of jesus christ in other words i wasn't ashamed to declare to the to the world remember when you're baptized there's all those people swimming around there half naked and everything like that you were a witness your testimony that you believe in the righteousness and the modesty of jesus christ amen praise god it's a testimony praise god the water doesn't save you but obeying that gives you a testimony you overcame you're a public witness your faith is real praise god amen but the water doesn't save you neither does the when we had the bread and wine last month that doesn't save us but it it gives us something to do uh to show our faith right so we can testify and we can be a witness that we follow jesus christ and we follow him in every word and the saint said and we follow him in every word and the saint said every word if he said baptized if he said a wine if he said bread we'll do it we'll do whatever jesus says because we believe every word he said praise god now church what do you got to do with everything with brother brahm like they tried to corner me and i said no i said every word of brother brand you got to take every word back to the bible so they brought this quote uh they have two quotes they brought also i'll probably maybe i'll get to it tonight there's one quote brother brahms says the trinitarians and the oneness all bow at the cross of jesus and they're all saved and then they use a quote from anointed ones in the end time where brother brahm says if a man can't believe he's one person he's lost that's quite a harsh statement and so he asked me well how can how can they be at the cross in one quote in the vision and then they're lost another quote well i said this all i can say is this quote didn't have thus saith the lord the one about their loss that doesn't have those saith the lord but the vision was thus saith the lord right so see you gotta and i said brother ram is a very zealous person he was he was a very dogmatic person he thought he was right all the time which is okay some of you are like that i didn't get very many amens on that that's true anyhow some of you just right we just we just think we're right i'm kind of like that sometimes sometimes my wife tries to tell me i'm wrong no i don't say that but that's what i feel like sometimes we're all a little prideful right and the church said i'll say amen amen sometimes i'm a little prideful but brother ram he's a man he was very dogmatic uh yeah can you go get jen there thanks yeah sorry she was sleeping she likes that she likes that nap on the way to church she likes that neck but church this is a good exercise for us if brother adam says that the blood doesn't save us and then he says it does well let's go to the word if there's any disagreement what does the word say well if the real revelation is this we're saved by grace through faith in the blood right because what are you trusting in are you trusting in the physical cross of jesus no are you trusting in the blood of jesus yes amen he he had holy blood the bible said it was the blood made by god amen god is a spirit doesn't have blood so he made a holy blood for his son and that blood was poured out and shed that we might be forgiven that blood was cursed that we might be blessed amen he became cursed that we might be blessed so see it's that blood we have faith in the blood in other words i'm trusting in jesus and shed blood to cover my sins amen i don't physically lay a hole sister beatrice of a goat remember we talked about it again we i don't lay a hold of a goat and bring it here and trust that that all my sins are on the head of that goat no but one day i went to the altar and i trusted that my sins were put on the head of the son of god amen the lamb of god and when he died he paid for my sins he paid my price i'm redeemed i'm repaid the ransom for my sins and now i inherit his righteousness amen just like i in the old testament i inherit that righteousness of that goat or that lamb or that bullock now i inherit the righteousness of god's lamb jesus christ amen so see i'm saved we have to accept ephesians 2 8 i'm saved by grace through faith but what about romans 3 25 whom god has set forth to be a propituation through faith in his blood so you've got to put this together with this if we're saved through faith but the bible said we we're saved through faith in his blood we got to put them together faith is the word actually means assurance or trust because it's revealed right right we know faith is revelation so when you have faith god is revealed that you can trust in his word right so we're saved by assurance in the blood of jesus christ praise god that it was shed for our sins and the the righteous died for the unrighteous that the righteousness of the righteous one might come upon the unrighteous praise god amen so see i i do this all the time sister naomi all the time i get quotes like this and i've learned over these uh 15 or 16 years of preaching not every word brother adam says now said the lord and you've got to take it back to the bible every time but see people like to be lazy and they don't want to study the bible right we see we've seen preachers they don't want to study so they'll just they'll use any quote just to try to it's a new quote people never heard it try to get them excited but that i mean it's okay to get excited about quotes right so if it's the word of god that's okay but when we when we know in our heart that that something is a little off there or we maybe it doesn't that quote doesn't actually go with all the scripture then we're the ones we're supposed to labor we're supposed to labor and doctrine and the bible gives double honor to those who labor and doctrine praise god god gives a double honor to them and so do his people but see we just don't just draw any quote and not uh and not rightly divide it it's got to be rightly divided all right now and then this one too here's the one brother i'm talking about if we walk in the light as he's the light we have fellowship with one another and the blood of jesus cleanses us see brother i was saying see the blood cleanses you he said it doesn't save you it cleanses you well he had a scripture for that but of course he corrected it later right and he said the blood does save you and the blood keeps you why are you here tonight because the blood cleanses you tonight praise god it cleanse you for your sins this week right we all sin this week we all fell short of god's glory but we had a blood there to cleanse us again praise god in other words cleanse us anew in our minds the blood has forever saved us it's eternally saved us and we're our name is on the book of life praise god but in our minds we and here on earth and time we make mistakes and satan tries to take to take it up to god but and he has a right to condemn us or accuse us as long as we don't confess but once we confess it's forgiven praise god and he cleanses us he cleanses us tonight from all sin praise god yet in god's mind as far as eternity our name is already on the last book of life it's just as good as done but we get current accusations well lord did you see malachi did this lord did you see lydia did that did you see the uh dad did that jesse did that you see that well he's got a right to do that right satan's got a right to accuse but we've got the right to confess praise god and be forgiven amen and to be cleansed so see this proves we must walk in the light of our day that's one thing to believe the signs hate they hate that doctrine but it's scriptural you have to walk in the light of your day acts 19 is the one we read on sunday right we finished with that on sunday morning uh if if the ephesians didn't walk in the light of their day they would have stayed under john's baptism they would have been bold they would have been excited all these things and had scripture but they would not have had the baptism of the holy ghost amen they had to walk in the light of the day and it came through a man it came through paul praise god it came through a prophet he was filled with the holy spirit praise god amen so see the ephesians had to walk in the light with other saints and then jesus blood keeps us clean and it kept them clean as well does that make sense so see church if you ever hear that quote just just kind of hold your peace because you know people are going to use it people preachers love the adoption series right because who doesn't want to be adopted bible says if you got the holy ghost you're adopted or you started the adoption the bible says you finish adoption when you get a new body so if any of us are born again tonight which i'm trusting many of us are if some of us are born again we are in the stages of of adoption if we just got born again we're just brand new to adoption god's showing us now a son and daughter my your name on the word is just as good as my name right right church that's what adoption is you take you take ownership of the family business and jesus said i'm always about my father's business adoption praise god see that's what adoption is you're born again and now you know how the king's business operates amen you know how to run the father's business but you don't know everything right away right but you can be trusted with it and it'll slowly uh the bible said you go from glory to glory from faith to faith he can trust you more and more as long as you stay sincere and as long as you stay cleansed under that blood god will you'll increase your faith you'll increase your your responsibility praise god and you'll be a true servant of god man or woman true servant of god not preaching of course but just serving god doing god's will praying for the sick women can pray for the sick women can cast out devils women can prophesy women can have words of knowledge right words of prophecy right all these words of wisdom now let's get back to the debate here i just want to start a few minutes on that wow so i did 20 minutes 22 minutes on that well just that one thought praise god anyways i hope that helps somebody by god's grace i hope that helps somebody because you know we all i do it all the time brother branson man you just come across thoughts that he was just sharing like the one i shared a few months ago he said he said jesus is not on his throne in heaven he said jesus is in heaven he's on the throne of your heart now can you imagine that jesus is not in heaven but he said it he said it in the church age series in 1960 he said that jesus is not in heaven he's on the throne throwing your heart a few months later he says jesus is on the throne right now well we know he didn't go back and forth we know the body sits there but the spirit is in on the throat of our hearts so he cracks it later but i've heard preachers go and say deity is not in heaven deities in you now can you imagine them saying that god's not in heaven right now god is not in heaven to see church we got to have an understanding we got to be patient and we we can't just swallow anything i'll tell you this a real born again child of god can't swallow everything right you just can't say amen to everything that's preached you got to go study it out yourself right now see that's where they get the bride worship if if there's no jesus in heaven then who you praying to you're just praying to myself oh jesus live in me i'm jesus i'm jesus right the bible said our father which aren't in he said well how do you teach us how to pray jesus my father in heaven that's that's why they get to this place in the philippines they have that bride worship doctrine where we're the bride and we get the we get the worship seekers he ain't in heaven anymore he's in us well the thing is is he is in heaven and he is in us at the same time praise god all right let's look at this uh the brother's third question for me was at what point does exaggeration become lying he just he's got a complex against brother branham he just i love the guy but he's just got a complex so it's so incredibly uh aggressive how could the seventh angel be so lacking in credibility that was his question for me and he gave examples like he said all the details about the 1933 ohio river uh baptism and the cl and the pillar of fire coming down he said that was all made up uh visiting buddha's grave confucius is great muhammad's grave he said brother ram never did that he said brother ram wasn't under the arizona cloud he said brother m didn't go around the world seven times so let me share with you a little bit about what i said here uh just give me a moment here that was question what three question three just a moment here all right so here's what i said um i said only god knows at what point exaggeration becomes lying because we've all exaggerated things right and sometimes church humans are just forgetful of their memories i forget i've forgotten a lot of stories over the years uh the only way to know is if you talk how would you know brother brown was lying well you have to talk to him he'd have to admit he was lying or that's the real the only way either god would show you that's the only way you would know uh that they admitted it on purpose uh and brother branham uh he said many times he said he said i've sinned thousands of times he said i'm trusting in the blood to forgive me he said when i say i've done wrong i said brother forgive me i didn't mean to do that he said there's blood sacrifice he says certainly god knows my heart there's power in the gospel that holy church moving on okay so i'm just trying to show that uh brother branham we don't know when exaggeration becomes line because we're not god god would have to show us or uh we have to admit it now guys you close that door there or thanks sister i didn't want to have course i asked you something there thank you i appreciate that thank you so only god knows now he says how could the seventh angel be so lacking credibility so i turned it around i said i believe brother ram was very credible that's what i said he said oh how could he be so he's lacking credibility i'm like he was extremely credible i said especially pointing the people to the bible right divine healing salvation water baptism doctrine i met the sister hume she was healed of tuberculosis in 1955. i met her that sounds pretty credible to me if somebody tells you to go weigh yourself two mondays in a row and you're gonna overcome uh tuberculosis that's that's pretty credible to me if that happens right uh and and i said in my own study i've heard what brother branham preached and i went and acted on it and i've cast out devils i've seen god stop a woman's bleeding i've seen god heal a kidney stone and arthritis and bring two barren wombs forth with babies i just saw what he said and the brotherhood said it well i believed it because it's in the bible praise god that's credible to me i don't know about you but that's pretty credible to me but i agreed i said yes there are changes in his stories but that comes with anybody and i tried to say this brother branham was not a scholar brother adam drove around constantly praying for the sick he just got a couple weeks off here and there every now and then to go rest his body but he was still in visions all the time still he saw visions and then he had all those letters coming into his house and then he said the phone rang all day that's why i'm glad i got a cell phone so i can just turn on silence i remember when that stinker used to ring all the time and we had a landline i remember unplugging it at our first house lydia won't remember that but i unplugged the thing i'm like enough of that well brother ram said his wife got white hair because of so many calls and she was what 20 years younger than him she got white hair because all the calls now can you imagine trying to study sister beecher's you guys are trying to study and write down all of your vision sister naomi all the visions he had and all the prophecies can you imagine trying to study that and bring bring but today we can silence the phone oh i can find where brother graham oh this doesn't line up this this doesn't line up and you can study it memorize it you can sound like a scholar i'm sorry brother man wasn't a scholar he was a prophet praise god now paul was a scholar and a prophet so there's nothing wrong with being a scholar as long as it's the holy ghost in you but see brother brown was this kind of man he was kind he was a servant he was given his life for the gospel praise god he wasn't a scholar like many people get to be today and i said it's impossible for you i told this man to say all those examples are false i said because you weren't there right and i and i even told this i said i've heard brother tell those stories and on some of those stories he'll say now brother so-so you were there can you say amen so that they can get you on the tape the very same stories they say brother-in-law lied on yeah brother man will call i love how he does that because he wants there to be a witness against it right now look here's what i told him i said now as far as the 1933 ohio river uh well i'm sorry i got these mixed up that was the municipal bridge i'm sorry so change this in your mind to the municipal bridge the prophecy brother ram said he predicted 16 men died right now there's only two men that died on record at least in jeffersonville's record well there's a couple things perhaps brother brown forgot the number of men from the vision maybe he said to maybe he said hey we don't know because we don't have the original recording or perhaps the construction company covered up more deaths which they cover up all the time church i've talked to saints in new york they saw the twin towers fall and they know it was an inside job and yet today they say oh it was the taliban or whatever a bunch of nonsense see i'm not a conspiracy theorist but i know when there's a conspiracy and i know when it's not a theory praise god and so uh a construction company covered up 16 people that wouldn't be any problem at all there's a video on youtube uh of a man in jeffersonville who doesn't believe brother ram's a prophet but he's interviewed and he remembers his parents talking about the 16 people dying on the bridge but yet there's no record in the government of jeffersonville who cares that doesn't so it comes out of this i can't prove 16 men died neither can he he can't prove 16 men didn't die right so what does it come down to a prophet's word against these guys word and i'll take that prophet's word anytime praise god i'll take that every time amen because he's credible with the word praise god he's credible as a man of god now the ohio river now that one i didn't get a chance to study but there's people i've heard in the congregation they testified it now they say there was only a hundred people there when brother graham baptized those 17. i'm sorry baptized and this and this on the 17th one the pillar of fire came down and said as john the baptist was full run for forerunner the first coming so will you forerun the second coming well these guys leave the signs say it never happened but there's people that were witnesses and said it did well watching brother ministry knowing he talked to angels seeing his discernment i believe it and they can't prove it didn't happen because they weren't there praise god now visiting buddha confucius muhammad's graves on the on the on the debate i say show me some proof i said you've shown me no proof and and all they say they don't they don't say any proof on the debate they just say he lied and that's why some people say i won the debate because i actually gave bible examples real examples but this guy said well show me some proof in fact my question was you've made all these assumptions and you've never showed any proof of it are you just assuming he said no and so i was waiting to hear the proof and there was none it was just like no he lied about this he lied about that lied about that lied about that i'm sorry you couldn't that wouldn't work in a court of law church just saying jesse lied or so-and-so lied show me some proof right you got to show you got to present something they don't present anything there's no so i'm just going to believe brother brown that he did visit those graves i don't know that he did but neither do you know that he didn't the only way to know is to follow him along around his whole entire life right that's the only way you would know that he lied or anything like that which i don't believe he did now there are quotes where ram said he was under the cloud when the picture was taken by his own receipts brother brahm was not in arizona on february 28th but he could have been there by vision and that's what ezekiel 8 15 is ezekiel sitting in uh saudi arabia i think or iraq and the bible said god picks him up by the lox and carries them a hundred miles right back to the temple of jerusalem that was by vision so brother adam could have been he was in texas at that time he could have been taken by vision and he could have been under that cloud when the picture was taken on february 28th right but either way even if he wasn't brother ram never said this he never said he never said thus saith the lord i was under that when it was taken he never said that he just said he did he just said he was there but it wasn't thus saith the lord now the cloud was prophesied of right the cloud was in the name of the lord this is going to happen he called it a pyramid before he called in the cloud so that was thus saith the lord and it happened amen praise god amen so see now and they see they say oh there was a it was a thor rocket that made that cloud well it might have been but it might not been and the other thing is they're using the data which they they weren't even a witness of it so see they're taking information that they're not a witness of and saying this proves it was a a lie that was just your witness anybody can make up a false document a government document in fact that's what they're trying to get trump for now that russian document that was all made up by the democrats and they're finding that out now that whole russian uh conspiracy theory that was all laid up and they're finding documents now but they made up documents to make it look like he was interacting with the russians and i'm not a uh i'm not a foo i didn't even vote for trump the first time i'll probably vote for him this time uh but i'm not a trump conspiracy theorist or anything like that i wouldn't even vote for the man the first time but it's it's it's an idea where you can't make a document thus say the lord the bible thus saith the lord praise god now did he go seven times around the world i don't know but they didn't show me any proof like how could you show me proof he never went around the world seven times how could you prove that another way is the other idea is he never said this he never said thus saith the lord i'm going around the world seven times he never said that so it's not about saith the lord and i still asked i said show me one shred of evidence they couldn't show me anything so here's some additional thoughts oh yeah they said brother graham's introduction to pentecostalism was was wrong remember how he said he went to mishawaka and he met the pentecostals there and he preached for them remember that story he said they said brother man made that all up but i've never studied the topic but their newspaper article is and thus saith the lord so they they have a newspaper article that says brother branham went to a pentecostal tabernacle roy e davis was his pastor and brother ram said see i never was a pentecostal until i met the chewaka pentecostals and so they see say see uh he went to pentecostal church he lied that's not that newspaper doesn't prove anything right it could have had a pentecostal name without the experience praise god just like a lot of people have a luther name but they don't have the luther experience luther had the experience his testimony says that the just shall live by faith fell like lightning from heaven praise god amen have you ever had a scripture fall like lightning from heaven and zap you praise god that's what martin luther had now how many luthers have that experience hardly any where it actually falls it falls from heaven and it transforms your life and instead of going along with the system you try to change the system i don't think many lutherans have had that same experience so it's possible it's possible his his church's name roy davis name was pentecostal but they didn't have the experience or it's possible that's a false newspaper article and it wasn't true it was just doctored up we don't know we weren't there neither was he neither was glee the sign they weren't there either and they say brother ram never saw vicarius filet day at the vatican although he said it numerous times well i said prove it they didn't have any proof they just said he lied well you don't get away with that right you can't do that in a court of law you can't say somebody lied without proof as i said they you know what they would do they dismiss that and that's what we do we that's why we dismiss their lies right we dismiss their assumptions we dismiss their uh uh their attacks because we know brother man preached this word and that's what we live on the word of god that he preached amen i'm almost out of time here now so i said he was extremely credible with the word truth healing i said it's impossible to say all these are false because he wasn't there offered no proof now there's a few things i didn't get to i'm going to skip these tonight uh yeah he makes all these he misinterprets john 16 13 and he says the flagstaff uh cloud was one of the biggest lies that's a that's a bunch of nonsense that's a bunch of nonsense let me get to something uh i got a little more time on uh now here's a little more on the cloud uh remember the four four points on the cloud it's believe the signs word against brother branham the thor rocket that is not the absolute brother braham said never said thus saith the lord i was under the cloud when the photo was taken so it's not a prophecy the the vision of the seven angels was prophesied in the name of the lord and brother could have been there by vision according to ezekiel 8 15. yeah let's finish with the godhead can we finish with the godhead i know y'all like the godhead right i love it praise god oh my the more i think about it the more i enjoy it so my third question is i heard on their uh i heard on their podcast he had a he had a muslim turned christian he interviewed a muslim turned christian and there they spent like three podcasts discussing the godhead and the guy said well really three persons is like three minds and i was like what i'm like oh my goodness and that it stuck with me because you know i've listened to almost all their podcasts because i like to prove them wrong because that's what god's called us to do he said uh answer all things the bible said ever have an answer for every man for the hope that lies within us that's first peter 3 15. and i heard that thought three separate minds and so i said so my question was does god have three separate minds as your podcast said and if so which scriptures explicitly teach this and claim he's three persons okay so i'll close with this just give me a few more minutes okay so he starts off by saying i misunderstood the podcast no i didn't i understood exactly what he said or the other guy said now he has he has some good scriptures here go to romans 8 27 let's read that one romans 8 27 i'll say it like this god doesn't have three minds but god has a divine mind but jesus's humanity has a different mind okay did you catch that the eternal spirit of god has only one mind but god made himself an image a body that did have a human mind and it wasn't exactly the same because it was limited on purpose now i don't want to say god has two minds i'm not saying that god has one mind but his son has a human mind and that human mind listen church i hope this is clear that human mind while it was on earth was not equal to god's mind because jesus said i don't know the day or the hour of my second coming so that human mind of jesus was not divine does everybody understand that jesus said who touched me and he didn't know but ramsay wasn't lying he wasn't lying he said who touched me the woman with the blood issue he didn't know right jesus said i only do that which i see the father do amen praise god he said i do nothing of myself but what i see the father do so see we god doesn't have two minds god has one mind but he allowed his son his image to have a human mind but now now this is why i'm not sure this is where we gotta this is further revelation now is that mind fully the mind of god i don't know does jesus right now know the day and the hour i don't know if anybody does let me know i don't know does jesus human body right now it's a glorified body sitting on the throne does that human body that glorified mind does that glorified mind know the day and the hour i don't know well i guess we'll find out i don't know i because because church brother brahm says when we get a theophany if you die you get a theophany he calls it a word body he says it's the word body so you believe the word but even paul and his word body doesn't know the day of the hour because jesus said only the father knows the day of the hour okay so even our idea of a word body well that's got to have a little tweaking to it because it doesn't know everything if that's the case then we won't need god for out eternity but eventually he's going to answer our questions all throughout eternity well if we knew everything we wouldn't ask any questions right so some of these things we've heard and thought and believed all these years sometimes we need correction right we've got to be careful what we say what we believe now romans 8 27 you got it malcolm that's okay no that's okay i got it i didn't know if you had it i didn't ask you my fault uh here's where it says the holy spirit has a mind and he that searches the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the spirit because he maketh the intercession for the saints according to will of god okay so see so brother the brother rod saying see there's three different minds but it's one person i'm sorry three different persons with three different minds but one god that's what he says so there's the mind of the spirit and then first corinthians 2 16 says the mind of christ and paul said in philippians 2 he preached it a few months ago we must have the mind of christ so he's he uses scripture to show it looks like there's three minds but there's not three minds right there's one divine mind and then there's one human mind of jesus because the mind of the spirit is the mind of the father how many can say amen to that the father is not a different person than the holy spirit jesus had two dads right jesus admitted he didn't know all things he prayed to avoid the cross and he says the trinity is the only way to explain jesus humanity i don't believe that our way is the only way to understand jesus humanity right god is invisible so jesus is the image of the invisible god right and this this brother even said god died on the cross god the spirit did not die on the cross you can't kill a spirit on a cross praise god you can't kill a spirit right god's the one who's got to get rid of he's got to annihilate that spirit i'm talking about demons now right and satan god's the only one that can annihilate a spirit you can't nail a spirit onto the physical cross and yet that brother believes god died on the cross well i said a image of god died the son of god died the lamb of god died the temple of god died but god the spirit did not die amen think man what do these people think some of them don't think as much as they think they do they don't think as much as they think they do he kept saying i don't believe in three gods and i said i i said i know you say that but you're teaching you're creating say that the creed say the father is not the son and the son is not the holy spirit and the holy spirit is not the the father the creed say it oh they say uh almost like 99 they don't come out and say three gods but if one is not the other and they're all three out the other that's got to be three there's got to be three gods and they quoted augustine which this man turned out to be a pretty awful man he said augustine of hippo he's the one that gave the catholic church the right to kill people if they wouldn't uh proselyte into the catholic church remember that that was saint augustine hippo he said if you deny the trinity you'll lose your soul so he said try to describe it you'll lose your mind and then his question he said jesse he said what giant of the faith of the last 500 years would deny the trinity and i said well i said i heard no scripture for three minds i said but the spirit's mind is the same as the father's mind the trinity essentially teaches three gods because the creed says the father's not the spirit did jesus have two fathers i said the revelation of the one person that god had was lost at the beginning of the church ages jesus taught it he said a woman injected three measures of leaven in the bread that was father son holy ghost at the beginning of the church age then it grew in this 11 lump and that's what their religion is 11. church we should have a unleavened church here praise god we should have a sin free church praise god because we don't have any false doctrine injected into our faith we should have a pure unleavened gospel praise god amen hallelujah thank you jesus if there is any leaven let's ask god to get it out and what does it produce now it produces pedophilia all right every nation under heaven where the catholic church is there's sex abuse claims everywhere every single one of them that's what their fathers and holy ghosts produced so you get one thing wrong it'll start leading them you'll get another thing wrong another thing wrong another thing wrong and i said paul never taught three persons i said jesus had a human mind but brother adam said thus saith the lord trinity is the of the devil but they can still be saved because the trinity is not salvation the trinity is a mystery right because there's no trinity it's the godhead as one person and i'm gonna close with this thought down here oh yeah he said can you he challenges me he said jesse said can you point out one giant of faith in the last 500 years who believed in one person i said i don't know any giant uh who believed in one person but it's not required for salvation but i said all the bible writers were true giants including jesus and they all taught god was one person so he talked about all the giants the last 500 years well i went back to the last 2000 years what about those giants that wrote the bible praise god amen i'm not talking about the giants the last five years the real giant was jesus amen he was the giant praise god the giant of faith the giant of deity praise god amen these teachers see how they with their words they try to trap you so i said i'm not looking at this 500 i'm looking at the beginning paul was a giant of faith james john peter praise god these giants of faith never taught god was three persons he's one one person let's stand to our feet i better stop i said jesus and the bible writers all taught monotheism not triatheism that's what they teach triath trithesism is three gods that's basically what they teach they won't say it but it's basically what they teach did i have something else i really want important i want to say yeah as you're saying i'm going to just read proverbs 30 verse 5 and say and this is one regret i wish i would've had i wish you would have labored more on this proverbs 30 5 and 6 especially for the godhead now church here's one of the biggest uh concerns i got about the godhead now all these got now he's talking about all these people that lived 500 years ago no in that age church 500 years ago they had this saying called sola scripture which means by scripture alone i've never heard of that sola scriptura luther used it wesley they all used it they wanted to be sola scriptura by scripture alone they all want to say i just use scripture alone i'll only use scripture alone and these brothers say the same thing they only use scripture but what about proverbs 35 and 6 every word of god is pure he's a shield unto them that put their trust in him add thou not unto his words lest he reprove thee and thou be found a liar so the same people that say we're only scripture only scripture only scripture they're the ones that say he's three persons he's got three minds and the bible says they're gonna be found liars because they claim i only use the bible i only use the bible but then they add their lie in there in order to fit their agenda right and fill their churches of course a lot of them now because the covenant are getting they're actually decreasing but they'll say anything to keep the people in there rather than tell them just the word of god look what happens when we just tell the people the word of god you find out who really loves god right they'll hang around for you a few services never see them again right because they don't love the word of god but all of us that love the word of god that believe every word of god is pure we hang around because it's what we live for it is our life musicians if you'll come the word of god is our life so i got a few more i think we got maybe one or two more messages yeah and then i got i still got another hour to go through on the on the debate i hope that's a help by god's grace is that okay church by god's grace is that okay hope everybody enjoyed that tonight the scripture is clear the scripture is clear that men of god are credible yet they're fallible sometimes in their human mind they make mistakes but they won't make a mistake with thus saith the lord the church we can rest assured that god has revealed the mystery of the godhead to us and we're just clinging to scripture alone we're going to cleave to the pure word of god how many believe god is your shield tonight amen the bible said faith is a shield bob said every word of god is a shield everywhere god is pure the word of god is your shield against those lies let's thank god for that tonight by god's grace let's have a word of prayer let's bow our heads here [Music] by god's grace hope i didn't sound mean i i didn't want to sound mean tonight i guess a little zealous tonight for the truth i know when we did the debate it was supposed to love my heart broken [Music] the holy spirit will start anointing my mind my heart that would be so zealous it'll be so perfect for this message so i hope by god's grace everybody understands i have so much love for these people now church let's just as we close think about the blood [Music] aren't we grateful for the blood of jesus church are you saved by the blood tonight and just as importantly are you clean tonight by the way yes let's have a word of prayer there's anything to confess confess it now so you can leave you haven't done it already but it's the blood church
