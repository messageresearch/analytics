[0:03] Revelation chapter 11 the themes of this
[0:09] chapter are the Jewish temple of God the
[0:12] two witnesses to Israel the passing of
[0:15] the second woe and the seventh trumpet
[0:17] sounding it seems from verse one that
[0:21] the Jewish temple will be rebuilt in the
[0:23] near future as an Angels given a
[0:26] commandment to measure the temple the
[0:28] altar and the worshippers therein
[0:30] presently the Jewish temple has not been
[0:33] rebuilt in Jerusalem
[0:34] due to the Dome of the rock the Islamic
[0:37] shrine is standing on the Temple Mount
[0:38] the former location of Solomon's Temple
[0:42] the two witnesses to Israel prophesy for
[0:46] 1260 days or three and a half years this
[0:49] three and a half year ministry is the
[0:51] final three and a half years of the
[0:53] Daniels 70 weeks prophecy from Daniel
[0:56] chapter 9 verses 24 to 27
[1:04] the passing of the second woe seems to
[1:06] be a great and deadly earthquake that
[1:08] will strike Jerusalem after the two
[1:10] witnesses are resurrected from the dead
[1:12] and raptured up to heaven the seventh
[1:17] trumpet sounding causes more worship of
[1:19] God in heaven but also brings an
[1:21] earthquake and hail upon the earth and
[1:22] this is the time when the kingdoms of
[1:24] this world become the kingdoms of our
[1:26] Lord in Christ
[1:30] the timing of events is as follows
[1:34] the rebuilding of the Jewish Temple in
[1:37] Jerusalem could happen either before the
[1:39] rapture or afterwards we are not sure
[1:41] but it seems that the official worship
[1:44] inside of the temple will be after the
[1:46] rapture based upon the verses that
[1:48] follow verses 1 and 2 the
[1:51] three-and-a-half year Ministry of the
[1:52] two witnesses will most likely take
[1:55] place immediately after the rapture of
[1:57] the Holy Ghost filled New Testament
[1:59] church for this is what God promised to
[2:02] do he would return to Israel after he
[2:05] called out a Gentile bride for his
[2:07] namesake since Christ was rejected by
[2:09] his own people Israel at Jesus's first
[2:12] coming to the earth the timing of the
[2:16] second woe and seventh trumpet seemed to
[2:18] follow the departure or rapture of the
[2:20] two witnesses
[2:24] the symbols and key revelations include
[2:26] the two witnesses the Beast
[2:29] the rapture of the two witnesses the
[2:32] remnant and the seventh angel concerning
[2:37] the two witnesses we are actually told
[2:39] they're symbols two golden candlesticks
[2:41] or two olive trees these same symbols
[2:45] were seen in Zechariah chapter 4 olive
[2:48] trees produce oil which represents the
[2:51] power or anointing of the Holy Ghost
[2:53] candlesticks produce light through the
[2:56] same oil so we again see the
[2:58] representation of the power and
[3:00] anointing of the Holy Ghost
[3:01] just as Zechariah chapter 4 verse 6
[3:04] stated then he answered and spake unto
[3:07] me saying this is the word of the Lord
[3:09] unto Zerubbabel saying not by might nor
[3:12] by power but by my spirit saith the Lord
[3:16] of Hosts the Beast is a symbol of the
[3:20] evil demonic spirit Kingdom recall that
[3:24] the Roman Kingdom was the fourth and
[3:26] final kingdom that would rule the world
[3:28] according to Daniels interpretation of
[3:31] Nebuchadnezzar's dream of the times of
[3:34] the Gentiles in Daniel chapter 2 this
[3:37] symbol tells us then that the Roman
[3:39] Kingdom which is robed by the mother
[3:41] harlot or Roman Catholic Church will
[3:44] prevail to kill the two witnesses or
[3:46] prophets of Israel
[3:49] the rapture of the two witnesses is a
[3:52] key revelation because it is the sixth
[3:54] and final rapture recorded in the Bible
[3:56] which follows Enoch Elijah Jesus alone
[4:00] Jesus with the Old Testament Saints and
[4:03] the New Testament Bride of Christ
[4:08] the Renmin is a symbol of the 144,000
[4:12] Jewish believers from Revelation chapter
[4:14] 7 verses 1 through 8 who are to be
[4:17] marked or sealed with the seal of the
[4:19] Living God which is the baptism of the
[4:22] holy ghost this remnant is frightened
[4:25] after seeing the rapture of the two
[4:27] prophets who were preaching that Jesus
[4:29] Christ is their Messiah but they also
[4:32] give glory to God after seeing the
[4:34] supernatural power of God or the rapture
[4:36] of the two witnesses the key revelation
[4:40] about the seventh angel who sounds the
[4:42] seventh trumpet in verses 15 through 19
[4:44] is that this angel is a literal angel
[4:48] and not a human being
[4:51] this is different than the other 2/7
[4:54] angels
[4:54] mentioned in the book of Revelation
[4:58] this is clear because the seventh angel
[5:00] with the seventh trumpet has a heavenly
[5:03] ministry and a trumpet blowing like the
[5:06] six previous heavenly angels exorcised
[5:08] as well
[5:10] the seventh angel did not have an
[5:12] earthly Ministry of preaching like the
[5:15] other seventh angels we saw in
[5:16] Revelation chapter 3 verse 14 and
[5:19] revelation 10 verse 7
[5:23] God has always used man to save man
[5:26] through the foolishness of preaching he
[5:29] does not use angels to preach and lead
[5:31] his people but rather he uses gifted men
