TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] Look at Job, a perfect man, a just man. And God permitted the evil devil to come up on him and chastise him and everything else for the perfecting of his spirit. See, so evil spirits has God uses evil spirits many times to work out his plan and his will. Greetings friends in the name above all names, the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of this video is to look at reasons why good people suffer or we'd say why do Christians suffer. Recently, our church was asked to pray for about three families within the span of one or two weeks. And in each of the families, the father had passed away. So, three families were left with widows and children. And so, this topic of why we suffer has been on my mind. So, I thought I'd make a video on this here by the grace of God. So, the outline is fairly simple. We'll look at two perspectives on why good people suffer and then we'll look at at least five reasons why God allows suffering. So, let's begin with two perspectives on why good people suffer. The first perspective is God's perspective on absolute goodness or holiness. So, the question, why do good people suffer in one way isn't true because there's no good people. A better question is why does God bless evil people? Because the Bible says in Jeremiah, the heart is deceitfully wicked above all things. Who can know it? So in other words, the question is flawed. Why do good people suffer? There are no good people. We're all sinners. We all fall short of the glory of God. There's only one good person, one good human being, and that was the Lord Jesus Christ. The one good person, the Lord Jesus Christ, was willing to choose to suffer in order to redeem us. So why did the one good person suffer? to redeem others and he willingly chose suffering. So that's the first perspective. The second perspective is God's perspective on believers obeying his spirit and not their own works or effort. But when believers obey the Holy Spirit, they're doing good in the sight of God. So for God's absolute standard of goodness or holiness, there's no one holy except Jesus. But God does recognize the righteous choices that his people make through his leading of the Holy Spirit. And this is all by grace, faith, and divine character that God builds up in our lives. Now, in Mark 10:18, Jesus told the rich young ruler, "Why causest thou me good? There's none good but one, that is God." So notice Jesus is testing him. The rich young ruler is likely trying to flatter him. And that's true because Jesus eventually exposed how he wasn't willing to sacrifice everything to follow the Lord. So he had some sin in his life still. But Jesus was testing him to see if he believed Jesus was God. Cuz Jesus said, "There's none good but God." Now, if the rich young ruler was a believer, he would have said, "Well, you're the Messiah. You're God." So Jesus was testing the rich young ruler and he failed the test. The Messiah was to be God according to Isaiah 9:6. A son was to be born which was the Lord Jesus. He'd be called the mighty God, the prince of peace, the everlasting father, wonderful counselor, all those great titles for the Lord Jesus Christ. So Jesus said there's none good but God, but he was a manifestation of God. He was the son of God. So Jesus was and is good. Now regarding the second perspective on goodness, Proverbs 12:2 says, "A good man obtainth favor from the Lord." Well, any honest Christian would want to be a good man. And this would be according to God's second perspective, not the first perspective on absolute holiness or goodness, but on the second perspective that by the Holy Spirit, God can lead us to make good decisions. Luke 23:50 calls Joseph of Arythea, he was a good man and a just. So the Bible calls him a good man. So this is in the second perspective on believers who by the spirit of God obey the word of God. The Bible also says this about Barnabas in Acts 11:24. For he was a good man and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith. So Barnabas was a Holy Ghost fil believer and the Bible calls him a good man. So that's what we want as believers. We want God's spirit to consider us good. In other words, we're trying our best to obey the Holy Spirit and make good choices. But none of us are saying we have absolute goodness or absolute holiness. That's only the Lord Jesus Christ. Jesus said in Matthew 12:35 that a good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth good things. So Jesus said we can be good not the absolute holiness but the surrendered obedient heart to the Lord Jesus Christ. And in Matthew 25 the Bible said Jesus will tell those who are faithful with their talents well done good and faithful servant. So it is God's grace that lets us be good that lets us do his will. Ephesians 1:6 said, "He which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ." So any goodness in our lives, it's according to the goodness of God, that he's led us into good decision-making, obedience. Ephesians 2:10 says, "For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works." So God created us to be saved, be filled with his spirit, then we can do the right works or good works. So in one way, are we good? No. We don't have the perfect goodness or perfect holiness. That's only the Lord Jesus Christ. But in another way, are we good? Yes. When we repent, get filled with God's spirit, and obey the spirit of God and do the right decisions, the correct choices. When we obey the word of God, that makes us good in the sight of God. So, let's look at five reasons why we suffer here. The first reason is to be tested, proved or tried to the devil. This is found in Job 1:es 8-12. God compliments Job's faith to the devil. And God said, "Have you considered my servant Job?" Now, it's a very humbling thought to think that God would consider you and I. Asked the devil to consider you and I about our goodness or our obedience, we'd say, and Job recognized eventually that this was a trial of his faith. In Job 23:10, Job said, "But he knoweth the way that I take. When he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold." So sometimes, friends, we suffer because God is proving our faith to the devil. Remember the Bible said the devil's the accuser of the brethren. He accuses us day and night before the throne of God. The scripture says, so let's remember if we can't figure out why we're suffering, why we're going through a test, if we didn't do anything wrong, it could be that first reason God is testing us or trying us, proving to the devil that we will obey God because we love God, not just because of the blessings he gives us. The second reason we suffer is because we're being tested, proved, or tried to ourselves. This is also found in the book of Job. It's also found in Romans 8:17-18 in 2 Timothy 2:12. Many years ago, I was reading my Scoffield Bible and I found this footnote on Job 42:6. Wherefore, I abhore myself and repent in dust and ashes. So here we see the second reason Job suffered so he could see what was inside of himself. And Scofield calls this self-nowledge or self-standing and self-judgment. I'll quote Scofield referring to Job. He said, "The godly are afflicted that they may be brought to self-nowledge and self-judgment. Such afflictions are not penal for their sins but remedial and purifying." End quote. So this footnote from Scoffield meant so much to me years ago and still means so much for me today. In other words, we suffer to be tested and shown what's inside of us that we can understand the need that we have to be more purified and we can judge ourselves that we be not judged as 1 Corinthians 11:31 and 32 say. So Job is tested so he can see his own sinful condition. the fact that he needed to repent in dust and ashes. Verse 6 said, "I abhore myself." So in other words, he had to be shown that he hated his sin nature on the inside of him. Now, if you want friends, I can make a separate video on all the sins Job committed. Although God said he was perfect in heaven, he was perfect in heaven by the blood sacrifice. He still sinned down on earth just like every one of us, everyone except the Lord Jesus Christ. Romans 8:17 and 18 the Bible says and if children then hes of God and joint heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may also be glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. So see we have to suffer in order to be glorified and so the testing or proving of ourselves will produce humility that we need to reign with Christ. So we need the tests and trials to suffer in order to be glorified. And we also see this in 2 Timothy 2:12. Beautiful scripture here. If we suffer, we shall also reign with him. If we deny him, he will also deny us. So see, we must suffer in order to reign. This is what brother Ram said in the Simranian church age chapter 4. Unless we suffer with him, we cannot reign with him. You have to suffer to reign. The reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering. Character is a victory, not a gift. A man without character can't reign because power apart from character is satanic, but power with character is fit to rule. So to go along with this, I found another quote from brother Brandham, Questions and Answers on the Holy Ghost 1959. He's talking about Job. He said, "Look at Job, a perfect man, a just man, and God permitted the evil devil to come upon him and and chastise him. and look and everything else for the perfecting of his spirit. So that's another way to say this second reason for suffering is to be tested and proven to ourselves that we might be perfected that we might be humble and have character that can reign with Jesus Christ in the millennium and reign with him at the white throne judgment sit with him in judgment and also reign during the new Jerusalem. The third reason we suffer is to learn obedience. Hebrews 5:8 and 9 tell us this. Brother Bham quotes this in the church age book again. He Jesus learned obedience by the things that he suffered. He was actually made perfect by the things that he suffered. Hebrews 5:8-9. Though he were a son, yet he learned he obedience by the things which he suffered. And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him. Brother Ram said in plain language, the very character of Jesus was perfected by suffering. And according to Paul, he has left his church a measure of suffering that they too by their faith in God while suffering for him would come to a place of perfection. Friends, all of us need to learn to obey. And so the third reason we go through suffering is so we can learn to obey. So the first reason to suffer was to be proven to the devil. The second reason would be proven to ourselves. The third reason to learn obedience. And the fourth reason is greater fruitfulness. Scoffield cited this John 15:2 Jesus said, "Every branch in me that beareth not fruit, he taketh away. And every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it that it may bring forth more fruit." So the purging is the cutting. The Greek means to cleanse of filth, impurity, to cut off useless shoots on a tree or vine. Metaphorically, to cut away from guilt. So God knows if we suffer, we'll have greater fruitfulness. Of course, because we have better character. We can look at so many Bible examples. You know, Joseph in the book of Genesis. He suffered, was sold into slavery. But look at his fruitfulness. After he endured the suffering, he became second in command, type of the Lord Jesus Christ, seat at the right hand of the father. David ran from Saul, went through a lot of sufferings for years and years. But because of that, he was a much better king than Saul. He had greater fruitfulness, way more victories. I think I calculated it last time. Saul had five victories. David had at least 14 recorded in the scripture. So greater fruitfulness after suffering. Paul suffered much. He goes through his list of sufferings in the book of 2 Corinthians. But then he would say in 1 Corinthians 15, he labored more than all the apostles by the grace of God that was with him. Paul was more fruitful because of all that he suffered. And the fifth and final reason we go through suffering is a testimony to help others or to judge others. So we see this in James 5:11. Brethren, we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the patience of Job and have seen the end of the Lord that the Lord is very pitiful and of tender mercy. So Job went through awful afflictions in order to be a testimony of patience. And we're told if we're patient, the end of God's ways for our lives will be very pitiful and merciful. So if we go through suffering, our testimony will help someone else whose suffering. Hebrews 2:17 and 18 also speak of this. Wherefore, in all things, it behooved him to be to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for the sins of the people. For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to secure them that are tempted. So because Jesus suffered, he can help others who are suffering. Secur means to help or give aid. And then Hebrews 4:15 says he can be touched with the feeling of our infirmities. So when we experience suffering and get through it and get victory over it, then we can feel what other people are feeling when they suffer and we can be a help to them. our testimony can help them or we can pray for them. There's lots of examples of this. Job suffered so much. He lost his whole family, all of his children. He lost all his money. Yet, he never cursed God. That's a great testimony to help everyone else who's gone through similar trials. Brother Brandham's youngest daughter, Sharon Rose, before she died, she had crossed eyes and that really stuck with brother Brandham. But then during his ministry, he saw crossed eyes healed repeatedly. So through his suffering of seeing his daughter pass away in the different condition, it led to a testimony to help others. God gave him faith to pray for other children that had crossed eyes. And as far as a testimony to judge others, we don't like to think of that, but there's at least three witnesses. The queen of the south, she had to cross the desert to find the gift of God in her day, the gift of Solomon's discernment and wisdom. And Jesus said she'd be used to judge the Pharisees and religious people of Jesus' day a thousand years after she lived because they wouldn't go to hear Jesus. The men of Nineveh repented at the preaching of Jonah. And Jesus said a greater than Jonah's here. They wouldn't repent at the preaching of Jesus. So the men of Nineveh will judge those who didn't repent at the preaching of the Lord Jesus. Then remember 1 Corinthians 5 and six say that the saints will judge the earth. The saints will judge angels. God will use each of our testimonies to judge others. Unfortunately, we don't like to think about that, but that's why God helps us overcome. But let our suffering be a testimony to help others here on this side by the grace of God. In closing, friends, I hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God. A great portion in the church age book that speaks of this subject is the Samriian church age. It starts with the conditions of the age on page 115 in the old book. And one of the most beautiful quotes in there is page 118. quote, "The cloudy skies and storms of life are no signs of God's disapproval. Neither are bright skies and still waters signs of his love and approval. His approval of any of us is only in the beloved. His love is elective which he had for us before the foundation of the world. Does he love us?" Ah, yes. But how shall we know? We shall know because he said so and manifested that he did love us. For he brought us to himself and gave us of his spirit, placing us as sons. And I love this last part. And how shall I prove my love to him? By believing what he said and by conducting myself with joy amidst the trials that he in his wisdom allows to come to pass. God has proved his love to us by sending Jesus Christ. He's commended his love, sending Christ to die on the cross, the righteous for the unrighteous. The Bible says that plainly in the book of Romans. But we can show our love by believing what he said and conducting ourselves with joy amidst trials. There's many, many verses about having joy in the midst of trials in the New Testament, such as Romans 5:es 3 and 5. I'm not going to read all this, but I encourage you to go read it. The Bible said, "We glory in tribulations also because tribulation works patience. Patience works experience, which is godly character, and experience works hope." James 1:es 2-4 says, "Count it all joy when you fall into diverse temptations, knowing that the trying of your faith workketh patience." So we can have joy because our patience is strengthening. Our faith is strengthening. And of course a beautiful example, Paul with the buffeting messenger of Satan, the thorn of his flesh. 2 Corinthians 12:9 and 10. Most gladly therefore will I glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ may rest upon me. For when I am weak, then I am strong. We also know this principle. when we're really weak physically or suffering physically, we're just constantly thinking about the Lord, meditating on the Lord more, and we're actually stronger spiritually when we suffer. So friends, if you're going through suffering now, cast your cares on the Lord. Reach out to the Lord. Praise the Lord. Do all you can do to be joyful and be thankful for what God has already done for you and what he has promised to do for you. Although you might not know, you can still trust God. God is trustworthy. He's the only trustworthy one. Hallelujah. And remember, you're suffering partly so you can reign with Jesus Christ because he suffered for you. Surely, you can suffer for his cause. The suffering is producing character. And character is not a gift. Character is a victory. If you have any questions, concerns, or testimonies about this video, please contact me. God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart. very happy to be here this afternoon and again in a defense of the gospel of Jesus Christ to bring the good tidings, the good news that Jesus raised from the dead, living among man today, his church. The same Jesus that was yesterday will be today and forever. He is never failed. [Music]
