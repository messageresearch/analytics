TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] having a church family every Christian needs a church family today we have the convenience of automobiles that allow us to travel almost any distance necessary in order to have a home church but in Bible days there was very limited freedom in travel their home church was often the closest Church believers had home churches in every city with elders as leaders and gatherings took place in the homes of the believers in Titus 1:5 Paul commanded Titus to ordain elders in every city for this cause left ivy and Crete that thou should have set in order the things that are wanting and ordain elders in every city as I had appointed thee the book of Romans and Colossians records that Aquila and Priscilla had a church in their house and so did nymphets Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus likewise greet the church that is in their house salute the Brethren which are in Laodicea and nymph as' and the church which is in his house the reasons for a church family are numerous first you need to feel God's love from others and express God's love to others according to John 13:35 by this shall all men know that ye are my disciples if you have love one to another second you need to be provoked or receive inspiration from others and then provide inspiration to others according to Hebrews 10 24 and 25 and first corinthians 14 verse 6 third you need exhorted or comforted by other believers according to Hebrews 10:25 fourth you need to be happy or joyful which jesus said comes through taking communion and washing the Saints feet in John 13 14 to 17 and haxe to 42 to 46 if you know these things happy are ye if you do them fifth you need to limit the number of voices you hear focusing on the faithful God sent voice of your pastor and the four other gifts God sends into your church John 10 4 and 5 and when he put it forth his own sheep he goes before them and the Sheep follow him for they know his voice and a stranger will they not follow but will flee from him for they know not the voice of strangers John 10:27 my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me sixth you need to learn proper judgment in church family situations how to judge yourself and fellow church family members Peter says judgment begins at the house of God with those that obey God first Peter 4:17 for the time has come the judgment must begin at the house of God and if it begins first at us what shall be the end of them that obey not the gospel Paul states this even more clearly in 1st Corinthians 6 verses 2 through 4 do you not know that the Saints should judge the world and if the world should be judged by you are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters know ye not that we shall judge angels how much more things that pertain to this life if then you have judgments of things pertaining to this life set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church 7th you need to learn to forgive and love like Christ within your church family Ephesians 4:32 32 and grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice and be kind one to another tender-hearted forgiving one another even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you financially supporting your home church as a Christian you should financially support your home church with tithes and offerings I have a two-part series explaining New Testament Christians should pay tithes to their pastor so he can live with the gospel as he focuses on prayer and preaching Christians pay offerings to promote the welfare of the physical church building paul ordained that the corinthian christians should bring their financial support on the first day of the which was Sunday in first Corinthians 16 verses 1 & 2 the final gathering as you've learned the local home church gathering represents God's sheep willingly gathering as a flock to be fed taught corrected comforted and cared for but God has one final mandatory gathering that all men and women will attend like sheep and goats gathered unto a shepherd this is called the great white throne judgment according to Revelation chapter 20 verses 11 to 15 Christ will judge each person by their works recorded in the heavenly books names found in the book of life will be granted eternal life and those names missing will be cast in the lake of fire Matthew 25 verses 31 to 46 is a second text about the great white throne as Christ likens this event as he himself the chief Shepherd separating sheep the saved from goats the lost if you've studied your Bible carefully though you will know that the true sheep who heard Christ's voice and followed him during their earthly lives were not being judged in this event but were seated in judgment upon Thrones next to Christ as his bride just as he promised the overcomers revelation 3:21 to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and then sat down with my father in his throne paul promised the same reward for faithful earthly service to the lord jesus christ saying do you not know that the saints should judge the world and if the world should be judged by you are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters know ye not that we shall judge angels how much more things that pertain to this life yes the true Holy Ghost field sheep will be sitting down with Christ in his throne at the great white throne but the multitude group who is granted eternal life are only symbolized as sheep proven by the fact they are surprised to be given eternal life by Christ for they say Lord when saw we thee an hungred and fed thee or thirsty and gave thee drink when saw we thee a stranger took the in or naked and clothed thee or when saw we thee sick or in prison and came unto thee and the King shall answer and say to them verily I say unto you inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren ye have done it unto me true Holy Ghost field Christians already have the assurance of their salvation while on earth and won't be surprised on Judgment Day as Paul says 2nd Timothy 4 6 through 8 for I am now ready to be offered and the time of my departure is at hand I have fought a good fight I have finished my course I have kept the faith henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the Lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not to me only but unto all them also that love his appearing in conclusion I trust the Holy Ghost has illuminated your eyes to see the necessity of a home church one of my main purposes in having a youtube ministry is to point you and all of my viewers to Jesus Christ that you may find God's position for you in your local church I am NOT and have never considered myself to be the pastor of YouTube nor the pastor of other men's sheep but I am seeking to point sheep to God's truth that they may be led of the Holy Spirit to a local flock or a home church if you do not have a home church I trust that the Holy Ghost now will lead you to that place if you have any questions about having a home Church please contact us god bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
