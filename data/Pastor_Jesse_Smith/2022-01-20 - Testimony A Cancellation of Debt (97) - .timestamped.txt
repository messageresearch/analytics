[0:00] [Music]
[0:08] greetings friends in the mattress name
[0:10] of the lord jesus christ
[0:12] i'd like to just make a quick testimony
[0:13] video here about something recently that
[0:16] the lord did in a very wonderful and
[0:18] supernatural
[0:19] way by the grace of god
[0:21] i've had it on my heart to share this
[0:23] testimony and also thank the brother
[0:26] from england who has led to the lord to
[0:28] meet this need in our local assembly
[0:31] to begin with this is a testimony of a
[0:33] brother in our local church who i'll
[0:34] call
[0:35] alan of course that's not his real name
[0:38] he's a 25 year old man allen came to our
[0:40] church around 2015 or 16
[0:44] and he stayed at our church for about a
[0:45] year and a half
[0:46] he attended nearly every service i
[0:49] baptized him in the name of the lord
[0:50] jesus christ
[0:52] and he faithfully served the lord for
[0:53] that year and a half he was such a
[0:55] wonderful brother to me and also he was
[0:57] like a big brother to my children he
[0:59] would play with them laugh with them
[1:02] and show them a lot of love
[1:03] after that year and a half he was with
[1:05] us he started having mind battles and
[1:07] decided to leave our church and he told
[1:10] me that he knew
[1:11] from the moment he left our church his
[1:13] life would go downhill because he was
[1:15] basically running from the presence of
[1:16] the lord and he said that is what
[1:18] happened for the next five years
[1:21] so for the next five years alan gave
[1:22] himself holy over to the world
[1:25] drugs the occult you name it he still
[1:28] had desires for worldly things and
[1:30] perhaps one day we'll make a video where
[1:32] he can share his own testimony himself
[1:35] i wanted to get out a quick testimony
[1:36] video because i think it would encourage
[1:38] the saints and also our brother peter
[1:40] from england
[1:41] alan said he would do so many drugs that
[1:44] he should have died many many times but
[1:46] the lord spared his life because he knew
[1:48] in the very depths of his being that the
[1:50] message was right god's bible-based
[1:52] message to william branham and the fact
[1:54] that he didn't die proves that god had
[1:56] his hand on allen's life
[1:59] and god had a purpose for alan's life
[2:01] that he is still going to fulfill
[2:03] during this five-year time period i
[2:04] would hear from alan every once in a
[2:06] while we would keep in touch through
[2:08] facebook and i would go on his facebook
[2:10] page and just be saddened by the
[2:11] pictures and things that i saw him write
[2:15] and it was discouraging because we had
[2:16] invested so much in allen during that
[2:19] year and a half but god kept us
[2:21] encouraged and during the whole five
[2:23] years alan was gone at least two of my
[2:26] daughters and perhaps more would put
[2:28] weekly prayer requests in for alan and
[2:31] another friend to return to our church
[2:34] now currently these daughters of mine
[2:35] are now 12 10 and 8 years old so that
[2:39] means when alan first left they were
[2:41] three
[2:42] five
[2:43] and seven years old
[2:45] as a father it truly warms my heart that
[2:49] jesus christ heard all the prayers of my
[2:51] little girls over this five-year time
[2:53] span even when sometimes i had doubts in
[2:56] my mind if allen would return or not
[2:58] then in 2021 allen decided he was ready
[3:02] to return to the church seek the baptism
[3:05] of the holy ghost and and fully serve
[3:07] god and stop running from the lord
[3:09] finally in december 2021
[3:12] alan returned by the leadership of the
[3:14] holy spirit and also brought his
[3:16] girlfriend with him who also desires to
[3:19] seek the lord
[3:20] as alan returned we put him right to
[3:22] work i gave him a job here
[3:25] painting at the church until he could
[3:27] find a regular job
[3:28] alan and i had many times of rejoicing
[3:31] after the first service that he attended
[3:33] he came up for prayer and he said he
[3:34] felt burning on the inside of his body
[3:36] which we know was the holy spirit
[3:39] cleansing him out and later that week
[3:41] after that supernatural experience he
[3:43] observed how god gave him overcoming
[3:45] grace and he noticed his temper was gone
[3:48] so the holy spirit was doing a
[3:49] sanctification work through our brother
[3:51] and he literally felt it on the inside
[3:53] of him
[3:54] as i would talk with alan about his
[3:56] situation of course finances would come
[3:58] up and i'm a pastor that's one of my
[4:00] desires to help out the saints
[4:01] financially and i found that allen had a
[4:04] lot of debts and our church is a small
[4:06] church we've always tried to be generous
[4:08] and give as much money as we possibly
[4:10] can so our church wasn't able to help
[4:13] him out with any of his debts
[4:14] one day after fellowshipping with allen
[4:17] i was leaving his apartment and i was at
[4:19] a red light sitting in the car just
[4:21] thinking about a situation i just
[4:23] whispered a humble prayer to the lord
[4:25] jesus
[4:26] i said something like lord you own the
[4:28] cattle on a thousand hills
[4:30] and i know that you can send the
[4:32] finances that he needs to get out of
[4:33] debt
[4:34] so he won't worry about all the debts he
[4:36] accumulated while he was in the world
[4:38] sinning and running away from you
[4:40] i'd even consider taking out a personal
[4:42] loan to help out our brother because i
[4:44] was so
[4:45] blessed that he left everything and
[4:47] traveled across the entire united states
[4:49] just to move into our local church
[4:51] because he knew the presence of jesus
[4:53] christ was in our church and he needed a
[4:55] home church he knew god chose the
[4:58] foolishness of preaching to save them
[5:00] that would believe
[5:01] for some reason though i could never
[5:02] call the bank to get the personal loan i
[5:04] just kind of kept waiting on the lord
[5:06] for it and then one tuesday morning i
[5:08] turned on my phone and checked my email
[5:11] and i had an email from paypal
[5:13] and i looked at the money someone was
[5:14] trying to send me i was completely
[5:16] shocked the amount of money was in
[5:18] thousands of dollars and i knew when i
[5:21] looked at that screen that it was jesus
[5:23] christ answering my prayer to help
[5:25] cancel our brother's debts
[5:28] and of course that email was from our
[5:29] brother peter from england
[5:32] and apparently he had listened to a few
[5:33] of our live streams or archive services
[5:35] on youtube and he heard me talk about a
[5:37] financial need but i never said the
[5:39] amount but the holy spirit put it on our
[5:41] brother's heart to help out this couple
[5:44] who had left everything to follow the
[5:46] lord jesus christ and this end time
[5:48] message why waited for the money to be
[5:50] cleared into my account and i didn't
[5:52] tell alan about it until a wednesday
[5:55] night service when i preached about the
[5:57] disciple whom jesus loved of course the
[5:59] sermon was about saint john
[6:01] the one that knew he was loved by jesus
[6:03] christ
[6:04] at the end of the sermon i talked about
[6:06] how
[6:07] each one of us should realize that we
[6:09] are the ones that jesus loves i could
[6:11] say i'm jesse the disciple whom jesus
[6:14] loved and each member of the church
[6:15] could say i'm so-and-so the disciple
[6:17] whom jesus loved
[6:19] at that moment i had thought to make the
[6:21] end of this sermon the announcement
[6:23] about how god had provided for allen's
[6:25] financial debts so i finished the sermon
[6:27] by saying allen
[6:29] the disciple whom jesus loved it was a
[6:32] special moment as i showed on the screen
[6:33] how we had received thousands of dollars
[6:36] to get alan completely out of debt
[6:39] and i told aon i said and i said just as
[6:41] jesus christ took away your sin debt now
[6:44] jesus christ is going to take away your
[6:46] financial debt it was a beautiful moment
[6:49] of weeping and worshiping and giving god
[6:51] glory
[6:52] and it proved to alan and his girlfriend
[6:55] that jesus christ can provide every need
[6:57] we may have to wait on it we certainly
[6:59] have to wait on his perfect will for
[7:01] every prayer request but we know jesus
[7:03] christ is jehovah jireh
[7:05] the god who provides
[7:07] brother allen says now this weight of
[7:09] burden
[7:10] worrying about the financial debts has
[7:12] lifted off his shoulders and he no
[7:15] longer stays up at night or wakes up at
[7:16] night worrying about the financial debts
[7:19] that we as a church couldn't help him
[7:21] out with
[7:22] because we're such a small church
[7:24] he's now free from that worry he's free
[7:25] from that anxiety
[7:27] and he and his girlfriend were so moved
[7:29] by this expression of love
[7:32] from jesus christ through our brother
[7:33] peter from england that they immediately
[7:36] wanted to go be baptized in the name of
[7:38] the lord jesus christ
[7:40] both of them were re-baptized a few days
[7:42] ago as a sign of recommitment to the
[7:44] gospel of jesus christ and the god who
[7:46] loves them
[7:47] in closing i want to thank brother peter
[7:49] from england
[7:51] brother peter the lord led you to do
[7:52] something that i could not do
[7:55] you followed the leadership of the lord
[7:56] and did something that not even the
[7:57] church could do for our brother
[7:59] brother peter you fulfilled the
[8:00] scripture
[8:02] from second corinthians 8 verse 7
[8:04] because you have abounded
[8:06] in generosity toward the needy saints
[8:08] therefore as ye abound in everything in
[8:10] faith and utterance and knowledge and in
[8:12] all diligence
[8:13] and in your love to us see that ye
[8:16] abound in this grace also
[8:18] thank you brother peter for abounding in
[8:20] the grace of generosity and care for
[8:22] god's saints you've also manifested the
[8:25] love of god in philemon 1 verse 18
[8:28] where paul said if he hath wronged thee
[8:31] or oweth thee ought put that on mine
[8:34] account of course paul was speaking to
[8:36] philemon about philemon's servant who
[8:39] had deserted him named onesimus and paul
[8:42] said
[8:43] put his debt on my account and i'll pay
[8:45] it off
[8:46] brother peter from england that's what
[8:48] you've done you've shown the love of
[8:50] paul
[8:51] you have taken
[8:52] allen's debt upon yourself and paid it
[8:55] off
[8:55] thank you brother and i hope this video
[8:58] has expressed our gratitude first
[9:00] towards the lord jesus christ for
[9:02] putting that on your heart
[9:03] and also for obeying the lord jesus
[9:05] christ to help our brother get out of
[9:07] debt
[9:08] and have a true supernatural sign from
[9:10] god that jesus christ is with him as he
[9:13] leaves and forsakes everything of the
[9:15] world all of his family friends and
[9:17] everything else to follow this
[9:18] bible-based message this end time
[9:21] message that god sent our prophet our
[9:23] brother william branham
[9:25] i'll leave everyone with the premier
[9:26] scripture proverbs chapter 3 verses 5
[9:29] and 6
[9:30] trust in the lord with all thine heart
[9:32] and lean not unto thine own
[9:33] understanding
[9:34] in all thy ways acknowledge him and he
[9:37] shall direct thy paths
[9:39] trust in the lord with all your hearts
[9:40] friends god hears all your prayers
[9:43] he heard the prayers of my little girls
[9:44] for the last five years he heard my
[9:46] prayer sitting at that red light there
[9:49] in downtown akron and he hears your
[9:51] prayers too
[9:52] god bless you and may jesus christ be
[9:55] the desire of your heart
