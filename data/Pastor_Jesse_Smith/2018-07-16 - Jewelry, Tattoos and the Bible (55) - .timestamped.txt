[0:07] greetings friends in the Mattress name
[0:09] of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose
[0:12] this video is to teach what the Bible
[0:14] says about jewelry and tattoos to begin
[0:18] with the Bible supports wearing rings
[0:20] necklaces and bracelets within four
[0:23] guidelines but the Bible forbids the
[0:26] wearing of earrings and nose rings and
[0:28] also forbids tattoos in a few moments
[0:32] I'll share the scriptures that support
[0:33] these teachings four guidelines for
[0:36] jewelry while the Bible allows
[0:39] Christians to wear rings necklaces and
[0:41] bracelets
[0:42] God gives us four guidelines on the
[0:44] quality and amount of these accessories
[0:46] that we should wear first the time spent
[0:50] on our outward adorning should be
[0:51] minimal more time and emphasis should be
[0:54] spent on prayer which is spiritual
[0:56] adorning prayer will help you put on
[0:59] humility shamefacedness which is
[1:01] bashfulness reverence and sobriety which
[1:05] is self-control rather than our outward
[1:08] appearance what is valuable in the sight
[1:10] of God is a meek quiet and submissive
[1:13] attitude according to 1st Peter 3 verses
[1:16] 4 & 5 second the quality of jewelry
[1:20] should be average
[1:21] very costly and expensive jewelry should
[1:24] be avoided as taught by both st. Paul
[1:26] and st. Peter in 1st Timothy 2:9 and
[1:30] first Peter 3 verse 3 Paul said we are
[1:34] not to be adorned in gold or pearls or
[1:36] costly array Peter said we do not seek
[1:39] an outward adorning of the wearing of
[1:41] gold or putting on of expensive apparel
[1:44] third the amount of jewelry worn should
[1:48] be minimal as sobriety means
[1:50] self-control the haughty or prideful
[1:53] daughters of Zion lacks sobriety and
[1:55] wore 21 different outward accessories in
[1:58] Isaiah chapter 3 verses 16 to 24 ranging
[2:03] from fee ornaments all the way up to
[2:05] bonnets for their heads God assured
[2:07] those women that all their attempts to
[2:09] look beautiful would backfire and their
[2:11] end was a burning destruction and
[2:13] desolation as Isaiah chapter 4 described
[2:17] fourth and finally and
[2:20] with wicked devilish symbols or
[2:22] otherworldly images or foul language
[2:25] would not be pleasing to God and thus
[2:28] should be avoided at all times whatever
[2:30] we do in word or deed should all be done
[2:33] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:35] Colossians 3:17 and whatsoever ye do in
[2:39] word or deed do all in the name of the
[2:41] Lord Jesus giving thanks to God and the
[2:44] Father by him scripture that supports
[2:48] rings necklaces and bracelets the
[2:52] biblical pattern for rings is that they
[2:54] were acceptable to God when they had a
[2:56] meaningful purpose such as in the cases
[2:58] of Mordecai Joseph and the prodigal son
[3:01] Mordecai received a signet ring from
[3:04] King Ahasuerus when he was given the
[3:06] power and authority of Haman's former
[3:09] position in Esther chapter 8 verses 2 &
[3:12] 3 Joseph son of Jacob was given a ring
[3:16] to wear when he was exalted to
[3:17] second-in-command in Egypt according to
[3:20] Genesis 41 verse 42 even our Lord Jesus
[3:23] is parable of the prodigal son included
[3:26] a ring being placed upon the prodigal
[3:29] finger once he was restored to his
[3:31] family today Christians are most likely
[3:34] to wear wedding rings to symbolize their
[3:36] unending vow of marital faithfulness to
[3:39] their spouse we believe God accepts
[3:41] Christians who wear wedding rings for
[3:44] this godly purpose wedding rings are
[3:46] sometimes condemned in Christian circles
[3:48] but there is no scriptural evidence for
[3:51] this idea the Bible offers support for
[3:54] the wearing of necklaces and bracelets
[3:56] in moderation necklaces were worn by
[3:59] Joseph and Solomon's bride in Genesis 41
[4:02] verse 42 and Song of Solomon chapter 1
[4:05] verse 10 necklaces were also used to
[4:08] represent the reward of obedience if
[4:10] children faithfully obeyed the
[4:12] instructions and laws of their parents
[4:14] the grace of God would be as a chain
[4:16] about their necks a corner proverbs
[4:18] chapter 1 verse 9 bracelets were worn by
[4:21] Rebecca upon her engagement to Isaac in
[4:23] Genesis 24 verse 22 God himself in the
[4:28] allegory of his rescuing and adorning of
[4:31] Israel as his wife was said to put
[4:33] bracelets upon her
[4:34] hands in Ezekiel 16 verse 11 scriptures
[4:39] that forbid earrings and nose rings
[4:41] there seems to be a clear and obvious
[4:43] scriptural pattern that teaches we
[4:45] should abstain from wearing earrings
[4:47] nose rings and getting tattoos which is
[4:50] this God does not want its people to
[4:52] pierce their skin shed their own blood
[4:55] or leave permanent marks or scars on
[4:57] their skin the only exception was in the
[5:01] Old Testament when God commanded Abraham
[5:03] and his seed to circumcise all their
[5:05] males but we know New Testament
[5:07] believers are not under the law of
[5:09] circumcision according to Galatians 5
[5:12] verse 6 in Romans 2 verse 29
[5:15] concerning earrings there are seven
[5:17] portions of scripture that described
[5:19] their usage in negative terms there are
[5:22] two scriptural portions that use
[5:24] earrings allegorically in positive terms
[5:27] two other scriptures reference earrings
[5:30] in ambiguous terms therefore I conclude
[5:34] that the wisdom of God would lead us to
[5:36] avoid earrings at all times because the
[5:38] negative witnesses in scripture greatly
[5:41] outweigh the positive
[5:42] additionally modern-day earrings require
[5:45] piercing bleeding and the scarring of
[5:48] the body which God never ordained for
[5:50] his obedient people I will now cover all
[5:53] scriptural witnesses about earrings and
[5:55] I'll begin with the seven negative
[5:56] witnesses about earrings 7 negative
[5:59] scriptures about earrings in Genesis 35
[6:03] verses 1 to 4 Jacob was commanded by God
[6:06] to return to bethel and build an altar
[6:08] of worship jacob commanded that his
[6:10] family bury all their idols and earrings
[6:13] under an oak tree in shi Djem it seems
[6:16] Jacob's family had to bury all that they
[6:18] worshiped which included false idols and
[6:21] the fashion of wearing earrings before
[6:24] they could appear before the Living God
[6:26] at the house of God today we must be
[6:29] careful that jury does not become an
[6:30] idol in our lives a second negative
[6:33] witness about earrings was found in
[6:35] Israel after the exodus out of Egypt in
[6:38] the absence of Moses the backslidden
[6:41] idolatrous people of Israel broke off
[6:43] their earrings at the command of Aaron
[6:45] in order to build the golden calf
[6:47] which God abhorred according to Exodus
[6:50] 32 verses 2 & 3
[6:52] it seems Israel received these earrings
[6:54] from the Egyptians during the exodus
[6:56] according to Exodus 3 21 and 22 and
[6:59] chapter 12 35 to 36 God's purpose though
[7:04] was not for Israel to wear the earrings
[7:05] but to use them to help build the
[7:07] Tabernacle in the wilderness according
[7:10] to Exodus 35 verse 22 later in Israel's
[7:13] exodus journey their armies obtained
[7:16] earrings as spoils of war and they
[7:18] dedicated them to the tabernacle of the
[7:20] Lord as an oblation and memorial
[7:23] according to numbers 31 vs. 48 to 54 so
[7:28] in both cases it again appears that
[7:30] earrings were never meant for everyday
[7:32] wear a third negative witness involved
[7:36] Gideon's interactions with the
[7:37] Ishmaelites in judges chapter 8 verses
[7:40] 22 to 27 scripture stated that the
[7:43] Ishmaelites were known to possess golden
[7:45] earrings but Israel was not known for
[7:48] that custom rather than rule over the
[7:50] Ishmaelites Gideon requested and
[7:52] received their earrings and formed an
[7:54] ephah that later became an object of
[7:57] idolatry in Israel note the similarity
[8:00] of idolatry associated with earrings and
[8:03] Gideon's ephod and the golden calf of
[8:05] Aaron in Isaiah and Hosea you'll find a
[8:10] fourth and fifth negative witness about
[8:12] earrings in both contexts God's two
[8:16] prophets record the earrings were a
[8:17] hindrance to women as a source of pride
[8:20] and even lustful seduction according to
[8:23] Isaiah 3:20 and Hosea 2 verse 13 the
[8:27] bonnets and the ornaments of the legs
[8:29] and the headbands and the tablets and
[8:32] the earrings and I will visit upon her
[8:34] the days of Balaam wherein she burned
[8:36] incense to them and she decked herself
[8:38] with her earrings and her jewels and she
[8:41] went after her lovers and forgot me
[8:43] saith the Lord
[8:45] Deuteronomy 15 verse 17 in Exodus 21
[8:49] verse 6 provide the sixth and seventh
[8:51] negative witnesses about earrings these
[8:54] earrings were called all's in the King
[8:57] James Version and were strictly given to
[8:59] Jewish slaves who willingly rejected
[9:01] and their God given inheritance then
[9:04] thou shalt take an awl and thrust it
[9:07] through his ear unto the door and he
[9:09] shall be thy servant forever and also
[9:12] unto thy maidservant thou shalt do
[9:14] likewise then his master shall bring him
[9:17] unto the judges he shall also bring him
[9:19] to the door
[9:20] or unto the doorpost and his master Shou
[9:23] bore his ear through with an awl and he
[9:25] shall serve Him forever
[9:26] I believe the hall is the ultimate
[9:29] example that God has never wanted his
[9:31] followers to pierce their ears in any
[9:33] way as they required piercing through
[9:35] the skin producing shed blood
[9:37] these all's or earrings were designed to
[9:40] leave permanent marks on the ears of the
[9:42] Jewish slaves so that their choice to be
[9:44] a slave for life would be instantly seen
[9:47] by all it seems unnatural that God would
[9:50] ask his free people to wear earrings
[9:52] that were just like the earrings that
[9:54] went through slaves ears for there was
[9:56] always to be a difference between the
[9:58] holy and unholy according to Leviticus
[10:00] chapter 20 verse 26 this is why we do
[10:03] not believe God ever asked the Jews to
[10:05] wear earrings as an everyday accessory
[10:07] again the pattern for earrings seems to
[10:10] be that slaves and heathens used ear
[10:13] piercings while God's people may have
[10:15] possessed earrings as customary
[10:17] engagement gifts or perhaps even as a
[10:20] form of currency to barter but not for
[10:22] everyday wear two positive witnesses for
[10:26] earrings the two positive allegorical
[10:29] witnesses for earrings are found in
[10:31] proverbs 25 12 and ezekiel 16 11
[10:34] Proverbs described golden earrings as
[10:37] representing a wise person correcting an
[10:40] obedient ear God himself in an
[10:43] allegorical story said he adorned Israel
[10:46] with earrings but we must be careful to
[10:48] keep both of these examples as
[10:50] allegorical and not literal especially
[10:54] in light of the seven literal examples
[10:56] of earrings being described in a
[10:58] negative way too ambiguous passages
[11:01] about earrings there are two other
[11:03] portions of scripture that were
[11:05] ambiguous about the usage of earrings
[11:07] which included Rebecca's engagement and
[11:10] job's restoration both Rebecca and Joe
[11:14] were given earrings as gifts
[11:15] but we are not told what they did with
[11:17] them it seems Rebecca's earrings were
[11:20] given to her as an engagement custom and
[11:22] not as an everyday accessory especially
[11:25] when we consider that her relatives in
[11:27] the next generation Jacobs family were
[11:30] commanded to bury their earrings before
[11:32] presenting themselves before God in his
[11:35] provided place of worship Bethel the
[11:37] idea that earrings were simply an
[11:39] engagement gift also connects back to
[11:41] God's adorning of his engaged spouse
[11:43] Israel in Ezekiel 16 11 job was given an
[11:47] earring by each of his friends after God
[11:50] restored his health and family in job
[11:52] chapter 42 verse 11 we cannot presume
[11:55] that God wanted job to walk around daily
[11:57] wearing multiple earrings especially
[11:59] since we know the haughty daughters of
[12:01] Zion were 21 different accessories that
[12:04] manifested their prideful lustful hearts
[12:08] furthermore we know God is more
[12:10] interested in the inward adornment than
[12:12] the outward this story of job provides
[12:15] more support that earrings were used by
[12:17] the followers of God as gifts of custom
[12:20] and perhaps currency or barter rather
[12:23] than for everyday wear nose rings
[12:27] concerning nose rings we do not have two
[12:30] or three clear witnesses that prove
[12:32] godly people wore nose rings and so we
[12:35] cannot teach that God allows them nose
[12:37] rings or nose jewels are alluded to in
[12:40] only two scriptures Genesis 24 47 in
[12:44] Isaiah 3:21 in the Genesis account the
[12:48] servant of Abraham put an earring upon
[12:50] Rebecca's face at the time of her
[12:52] engagement to Isaac which seemed to be a
[12:54] temporary nose ring since God has never
[12:57] asked his obedient people to pierce or
[12:59] permanently scar their bodies this act
[13:02] of putting an earring upon her face
[13:04] could have simply been a custom for her
[13:05] engagement we have very little
[13:07] information about this event and so we
[13:10] cannot use this one isolated scripture
[13:12] to allow our minds to believe that God
[13:14] wants all his people to wear nose rings
[13:16] in fact the rest of Scripture is a
[13:18] witness that God does not want us to
[13:20] wear nose rings because the rest of
[13:22] Scripture never teaches anyone to wear
[13:24] nose rings either the account of nose
[13:27] jewels in isaiah 321 Appy
[13:29] to be a negative example of nose jewels
[13:31] as the prideful seductive daughters of
[13:34] Zion were born with 21 different
[13:36] accessories one of those was nose jewels
[13:39] we already learned that the end of these
[13:41] prideful seductive daughters of Zion was
[13:44] destruction and desolation based upon
[13:46] these two accounts one that seems
[13:48] customary in Genesis and one that seems
[13:51] negative in Isaiah I can build a strong
[13:53] case that Christians should abstain from
[13:55] wearing nose rings tattoos and the Bible
[13:59] concerning tattoos the Lord God told
[14:02] Moses in Leviticus 19:28
[14:04] you shall not make any cuttings in your
[14:07] flesh for the dead nor print any marks
[14:09] upon you I am the Lord based upon this
[14:13] scripture and two other reasons we
[14:15] believe tattoos are forbidden for Jews
[14:17] and Christians first tattoos are never
[14:20] commanded nor approved of in the New
[14:21] Testament
[14:22] second the pattern of our holy God is
[14:25] that humans not pierce mark or cut their
[14:28] bodies in any way as tattoos permanently
[14:31] marked the skin the Bible gives multiple
[14:33] examples of heathens who cut their own
[14:35] bodies due to demonic possession first
[14:38] the prophets of bale cut themselves to
[14:41] no avail in the days of the prophet
[14:43] Elijah thinking that their false gods
[14:45] would hear their requests second the
[14:48] maniac of Ghidorah who is possessed with
[14:50] a legion of demons was known to cut
[14:52] himself with stones
[14:53] when a person willfully cuts their own
[14:55] body today it is a clear sign of some
[14:58] demonic possession or influence and the
[15:01] individual must repent and seek the
[15:03] deliverance through the blood of Jesus
[15:05] Christ the desire to get a tattoo would
[15:08] seem to come from a minor form of
[15:10] demonic influence as the Holy Ghost will
[15:13] not lead us to defile our bodies which
[15:15] are the temples of the Holy Ghost
[15:16] Christians who already have tattoos and
[15:19] feel the conviction of their mistake
[15:21] should first repent and then vow to
[15:23] never get another marking on their body
[15:25] believers should not feel pressure to
[15:27] spend a lot of money to remove their old
[15:29] tattoos because God is quick to forgive
[15:31] and ready to pardon sins
[15:33] instead the believer should try to cover
[15:36] up their tattoos especially if the
[15:38] images are immoral or evil in conclusion
[15:43] I hope these scriptures have proven to
[15:44] you God's perfect will for jewelry and
[15:47] tattoos if you have any questions about
[15:50] the scripture we've referenced please
[15:51] contact us god bless you and may Jesus
[15:56] Christ be the desire of your heart
