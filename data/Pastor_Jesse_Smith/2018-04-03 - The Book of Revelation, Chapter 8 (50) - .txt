TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] Revelation chapter 8 the themes of this chapter are the opening of the Seventh Seal and the sounding of the first four trumpets of judgment upon the earth and its inhabitants the opening of the seventh and final seal causes silence in heaven for the space of half an hour after the silence ends all the prayers of the Saints are made ready to be answered and preparations are made for the sounding of the seven trumpets a great earthquake also takes place upon the earth before the trumpets begin sounding the first trumpet sends hail and a mixture of fire and blood upon the earth the second trumpet causes the sea to become blood during the third trumpet the star named wormwood falls upon the rivers and fountains of waters causing much death the fourth trumpet sounds and a third part of all light is lost and there is no day for eight hours an angel then warns the inhabitants of the earth that three woes will be coming upon the earth through the last three trumpets the timing of these events are as follows our conviction although we could be wrong is that the opening of the Seventh Seal is the rapture of the New Testament Bride of Christ and takes place at the unknown Day an hour that Jesus foretold in Matthew 24 verse 36 and mark 13 verse 32 the rapture is the next major Bible event that is to take place and will be immediately followed by the Tribulation Period so we are watching and praying for that moment as Jesus commanded the timing of the sounding of the first four trumpets is also something that we could be wrong about but here is our conviction it seems these first four trumpets sound after the rapture during the last three and a half years of Daniels 70th week and also after the hundred forty-four thousand Jews are sealed by the Spirit of God we come to this conclusion because revelation 7 verse 1 says that no tree can be hurt until after the 144,000 are sealed in the first trumpet we see a third of the trees burn up so this is why we believe the trumpets sound after the 144,000 Israelites are sealed with the Holy Ghost notice that the first four trumpets are pronounced or initiated by the two witnesses of Revelation 11 as they will be given power over nature according to revelation 11 verse 6 and the effects of the first four trumpets are an interruption of nature which also enlightens us to know that all seven of the trumpets sound under the sixth seal which we're taught in Revelation chapter 6 verses 12 to 17 the symbols and key revelations in this chapter are the seven seal and the silence in heaven for half an hour what is remarkable about the seventh seal is that there are no symbols given which is different than the six previous seals there are no symbols for the seventh seal or rapture because if there were Satan could use those symbols and try to do damage to the bride of Jesus Christ the rapture is such an important and secretive event that the father would not even a the Sun to know the day or hour of his own return for his bride mark 13:32 but of that day and that hour knoweth no man no not the angels which are in heaven neither the son but the father we believe the phrase silence in heaven for half an hour contains a key revelation because silence in heaven would mean that the four beasts who worship Christ without ceasing day or night according to Revelation 4 verse 8 finally stop worshiping Christ we believe this is because Christ the object of their worship will leave heaven to go down to the air or sky to rapture the dead in Christ first and then change the bodies of the living Saints according to 1st Thessalonians 4 verses 16 and 17 and first Corinthians 15 verse 52 which is the rapture or caught up experience of the Gentile bride if you'd like more bible scriptures quotations or if you have any questions about the book of Revelation please contact us god bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
