TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] Now you see it's wheat time now. It's getting harvest time. This is not Luther's age. This is not Pentecost age. This is a bride age. We all know we're living in the Ladya age. There will never be another age to it. It can't be. So we're living in the Ladya age. And these seven seals that help that book is a mystery to people should be open at that day. Greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of this video is to answer the question, what is the bride age according to God's prophet, brother William Marin Brandham. Recently, one of the saints and I were talking about this in the parking lot after church. So, I thought I'd make a video about it by the grace of God. It had been years since I studied this subject. I knew there was just a few quotes on it. There's only six quotes on the bride age and they're all from 1965. So, it was really wonderful to revisit this subject. I'm going to start with the quotes from God's prophet, Brother Brandham. I'm not going to give you my answer to what I think the bride age is until after I read through all six quotes from God's prophet, Brother Brandham. But I do want to say, pretend you had never heard any preaching about the bride age. As you go through these six quotes, just try to listen to what brother Brandham is saying, and then hopefully you'll reach the same conclusion that I did. If not, I'm not saying I'm absolutely right. I could be wrong, but I think there are a lot of false teachings about the bride age, a lot of misunderstandings, and I think the Holy Ghost would guide us into all truth on this topic if we simply asked him and approached this topic with a humble heart by the grace of God. And for these last two videos, I've tried to start the video without wearing my glasses. A brother had asked me if he could see my eyes on the videos. Sometimes there's glare on my glasses, and he can't see my eyes. So, I just thought I would honor his request at the beginning of the videos. If that helps him to see that I'm being sincere, then I want to try to honor those requests. And if I forget, pardon me, forgive me. Let's start with this. Let's start with the five sermons in which brother Brandham used the phrase bride age. The first was it is the rising of the sun, April 18th, 1965. And then 7 months go by where he doesn't mention it at all. And then he mentions it five times within 13 days. Right at the end of his life, he mentions it in the invisible union of the bride of Christ, November 25th, 65. 2 days later in I have heard but now I see November 27th. And then modern events are made clear by prophecy. He mentions it twice in this sermon from December 8th, 1965. And the final time he mentions it is in leadership, December 7th, 1965. So I'll put on my glasses now so I can read these quotes here a little better by God's grace. Let's read through all six quotes by the grace of the Lord. Now it's really important to get the context here. So in the first quote from it is the rising of the sun in paragraph 92 brother Brandham mentions the last day and Luke 17:30 in the day that the son of man will be revealed or waved over the people. So, brother Brandham mentions Luke 17:30 and then Malachi 4 and the different scriptures that we are acquainted with. In other words, the scriptures that brother Brandham was to fulfill. He said that the word again is waved over the people and the dead traditions of man is dead and the son of God is alive again with the baptism of the Holy Ghost right among us and is giving us life. Then he talks about the wave sheath, the first one that come to mature. Then brother Renham applies the wave sheath to his day and says the first time there will come forth for the bride age for a resurrection out of dark denominationalism will be a message. So it's brother Ram's message of the baptism of the Holy Ghost that the full maturity of the word has turned back again in its full power and being waved over the people by the same signs and wonders that that he did back there. So, brother Ram's talking about the same signs and wonders from Jesus's own earthly ministry, the son of man, the resurrected Christ. Jesus Christ was the first resurrected. He was the first fruits, the wave sheath, the fulfillment or anti-ype of the wave sheath from the feast of first fruits from Leviticus chapter 23. And then brother Ram talks about our resurrected life through the baptism of the Holy Ghost. He said in paragraph 97, "Because I live, ye live also." Speaking to his wife, "What a resurrection that was," speaking of Jesus' resurrection. "And what a resurrection this is to be quickened from the dead to be made alive in Christ Jesus by God's quickening power." Then brother Ram says, "The word was waved back to them on the day of Pentecost. The word made manifest. It's to be waved again in the last day." So brother connects the baptism of the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost to our day. So the baptism of the Holy Ghost is available today and it brings resurrected life. Now this is according to Ephesians 2 1-10 and of course other verses. Ephesians 2:1 says, "And you hath he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins." Brother Ram talked about that to be quickened from the dead. Then I'll go to Ephesians 2:5. Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ. So the quickening from the dead, we can see plainly in Ephesians 2 1-10, a spiritual resurrection. So brother Ram is saying the bride age is the time when the original baptism of the Holy Ghost from the day of Pentecost is now available today. Notice that baptism of the Holy Ghost is not in dark denominationalism. In other words, the Lutherans, the Methodists, the Baptist, the denominated Pentecostals do not have the baptism of the Holy Ghost. They're not quickened from the dead in their souls. Now, the second quote 7 months later is from the invisible union of the bride of Christ. In paragraph 3:24, brother Ram says, "The word that fell on the day of Pentecost will not work for this day." No sir, that was for Pentecost. This is for the bride, going home of the bride. We got something different. The Pentecostals represented that again. We're in the bride age. No more than the word of Noah would work in the days of Moses. No more than Moses law would have worked in the time of Paul here. He tried to tell them, "You are dead to that and you cannot have that." Now, if you go up two paragraphs earlier, Brother Ram's talking about the rapture in paragraph 3:22. Brother, let's get all these things ready for one of these days. The fire is going to fall. Let's get ready for the fire. Let's get ready for the firefalling time. Now, if you haven't seen the video I made on this topic of the word that fell on the day of Pentecost won't work for this day, I would encourage you to go watch it. Brother Brandon is simply saying in order to be raptured, we need more than just Acts 2:4 to be fulfilled. We need 1 Thessalonians 4 to be fulfilled about the shout voice trump. We need 1 Corinthians 15 to be fulfilled about change in a moment, in a twink of an eye. That's all brother Ram is saying. Brother Ram is not saying we don't need the book of Acts or the baptism of the Holy Ghost. He says there's different scriptures that need to be fulfilled. We need the rapture scriptures to be fulfilled. And then the next paragraph, paragraph 3:25, after he says bride age, the ram said, "Look up. Get ready. The fire is going to fall. One of these days, God is going to let him come and a sight to behold. Would you be ready when he comes? Would you be ready to go up with him when he comes? The secret rapture of the supernatural bride. So, brother Bram is saying in order to be ready for the rapture, we can't be a part of the Pentecostal movement. We've got to be in the bride age. Let's go to the third quote. It's from I have heard but now I see. Shreveport. 2 days later, November 27th, the evening service. Hopefully, your picture is getting clear about what the bride age is by God's grace. Paragraph 187. Now, it's beginning to pull away. The wheat begin to be seen. This is not a Pentecostal age. This is the latter-day age. This is the bright age. This is the evening light. This is when Malachi 4 must be fulfilled to follow God's pattern. This is Luke 17:30 to be fulfilled. So, Brother Bam uses the two verses he used back in April from it is the rising of the sun. Luke 17:30 and Malachi 4 to say we're in the bride age. And now notice he brings out how we are not in a Pentecostal age. In other words, he's separating his ministry from the Isuza Street Pentecostal revival. And that fits with the idea from it is the rising of the sun about dark denominationalism. Brother Random is separating his ministry and the restored baptism of the Holy Ghost from the denominational Pentecostal movement that was prior to his revival. So we can see brother Brandham is differentiating his revival with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the sign of a prophet. Luke 17:30 Malachi 4 turning the hearts of the children back to the fathers. He's separating his revival of the baptism of the Holy Ghost from the previous revival which was the Isuza Street Pentecostal revival. Next, the fourth and fifth quotes are in the same sermon from modern events are made clear by prophecy December 6th, 1965. And in these fourth and fifth quotes, they're saying the same thing. And brother Random is separating his revival, his message from the Bible from the Isuza Street revival. In paragraph 55, he said, "And this one Methodist says this, the Baptist says this, the Pentecostal said this, the one said this, the Tunis says this." Then down in paragraph 56, we're not living in a Pentecostal age. We're living in another age. Now he's talking about the Isuza Street Pentecostal revival. See, we're not living in a Methodist age. We're living in another age. We're living up here to the bride age, the calling out of the church and getting it together for the rapture. That's the age that we're living in now. To my honest opinion, that's exactly the truth. So, Brother Ram has gone through the history of revivals since the reformation. Luther, Wesley, Methodist, Baptist, Pentecostal, oneness, Tunis, and he's bringing us up to his day, the latest revival, the most recent revival. Then down in paragraph 62, he says, "Bride age again. Now, and with patience, we have to wait for this for the prophecies that's promised. Every one of them must be fulfilled in this age." Then he says, "We're not living in the Methodist age, the Baptist age. We're living in the bride age, the calling, bringing back to God through a channel that he promised to bring it back in. He promised to do it. So we know that channel would be Luke 17:30, the son of man anointing a son of man, the Lord Jesus Christ anointing a prophet. Brother William Brandham, Malachi 4, the spirit of Elijah turning the hearts of the children back to the Pentecostal fathers. And now let's get to the sixth and final quote. Leadership, December 7th, 1965. In paragraph 139, Brother Brandham said, "The life, sure, the the stalk back here carried the life." Certainly it did. But you see when it become the stock and it was finished the organization the life went right on into Wesley come right out went in. So brother Ram's talking about the life of the wheat plant. And recently I made videos about this regarding brother Ram's masterpiece. Brother Ram's masterpiece was the life of the wheat plant. In other words, the progression of the life through the wheat plant. That was a type of the life of the Holy Ghost being restored starting at Martin Luther's day to brother Brandham's day. The life flowing through the church ages in restoration, God restoring the church beginning with Martin Luther and finishing here in Brother Ram's day with brother Ram's message. Then down in paragraph 140, Brother Ram said, "This is not Luther's age. This is not Pentecost age. This is the bride age. As Moses called a nation out of a nation, Christ today is calling a church out of a church. You see the same thing in type, taking them to the glorious eternal promised land. Now, that's the rapture. Once the rapture happens, we're changed in a moment in twink of an eye. We're given glorified bodies. That's eternal life. That's the eternal promised land. We all we're all desiring by the grace of God. Then down in paragraph 142, brother Ram said, "Now to refuse that person that's doing the calling, Christ, no matter if you're Pentecostal, Methodist, Luther, whatever you are, you've got to this age. Nothing against them. Not at all. But in this age now, you've got to accept like they did in that age, the person of Christ, which is the word." Then down in paragraph 143, now what life Luther had was justification. Wesley had sanctification added to it. The Pentecost had the restoration of the gifts coming back in added to it. But now it's completing in the body. You see the three phases of it. Now when the resurrection comes, the life that lived in them Lutheran that's went out. The life that lived in the Methodists went out. The life that went into Pentecostals will all be raptured out of the ground in the body of the bride to be taken in before Jesus Christ. Glory to God. Oh, it's exciting. It's the truth. So friends, we've made it now through all six quotes on the bride age. So my conclusion that I've understood through the quotes and the scriptures is that the bride age is the time or age after the Isuza Street Pentecostal denominated in which the life of the wheat plant or life of the Holy Ghost moved into the seed. So the life of the Holy Ghost left the Pentecostal denominations and moved into the ministry of God's prophet William Brandham and the churches, the true bride churches who've accepted his Bible revelations and have the baptism of the Holy Ghost, the true life of the seed, the true life of the Holy Ghost. In other words, it's the time after the chaff separated from the wheat. So the Pentecostal denomination is the chaff. And now brother Am's message and the churches who are born again have the seed which is the full word of God, the full revelation of truth. Here's a visual I made on the masterpiece video. It's a wheat plant sideways and this wheat plant represents a timeline. So the Lutheran revival started around 1517. I'm not making these dates absolute, so bear with me. That was probably the stalk. The Methodist revival started around 1738. That's the head of the wheat plant. The Pentecostals represent the chaff from 1906. And now the bride age is the full word, the seed, the same life, the same doctrine, power of the apostolic age back in the bride. The alpha church has become the omega church. And I just put 1963 because that was the opening of the seven seals, brother's commission as he said. So the bride age is the time that God has restored the baptism of the Holy Ghost, the full revelation of the word into the believers of the latest message, the latest revival, which is the bride's revival. Brother Ram calls it the awakening of the bride in the feast of trumpets 1964. So the Isuza Street Pentecostal move died out. They denominated. And now we are in the bride age. We're in the time when those who have the baptism of the Holy Ghost will receive the Bible revelations that William Brigham taught. In this next section, let's look at how brother Ram taught Leodysia was not over. So some people when they talk about the bride age will say Leodysia is over. They're wrong. That's not what brother Ram taught. So I found that in four out of these five sermons where brother Ram talked about the bride age he used the word Leodysa and told the people that they were still living in Leodysia. This proves he did not think Leodysia was over. So start in the visible union of Christ Shriveport he said in paragraph 163 at the end time both trees are coming to the seed and proving themselves. Here we are right today. Leodysia and the bride just as clear and pretty as it can be in the scripture and right before your faces. Then he says you can't be a virtuous bibleelving Christian and associate yourself in the denominational affair. So there we see the difference between the bride and the leodysans. The bride is a virtuous bibleelving Christian and the leodysans are denominational Christians. Next in the sermon I've heard but now I see brother Ram used le oysia again in paragraphs 106 and 107. In 106 he said and we are not living in Luther's age, Wesley's age or the Pentecostal age. The Pentecostal age was only a restoration of the gifts coming back to the church but we're living in the evening time. We're living in a time of the calling out of the bride. Paragraph 107. And just as it was hard for the Catholics to see Luther and the Luthers to see the Wesley and the Wesleys to see the Pentecostal age, so it is hard for the Pentecostals to see this age. Revelation tells us in this Leodysian church age, he was put out of the church that they're naked, poor, miserable, blind, and don't know it. So notice, brother Ram says in this Leodysian church age. So first he said today Leot in the bride and then he said in this leodyian church age. Next in the modern events made clear by prophecy. This is the sermon where brother Ram used the bride age twice. Three times in this sermon, brother Ram said, "We are still in Leodysia." So it's paragraph 19 first. Do you realize that that's promised in this very age that we're living, the Leoian church age, this seventh church age that we're in now. So brother Ram says we're in now the Leoian church age. So these preachers that say we're not in it, they don't know the quotes. So we can just pray for them and hopefully this video will help them as well. Paragraph 158, how can I tell this Leodysian church age the good things when God spoke against it? Again, this Leodysian church age. And then the third time he says it in the sermon is paragraph 263. Notice now they done to him just exactly what the prophet said they would do, just as they are doing this very same day in the Leodysian age. This very same day is the Leodysian age. Now this next section I just want to show how brother Ram clearly said in 1964 we are still in Leodysia and Leodysia lasts until the church is raptured off the earth. That means we're still in Leodysia because the church has not been raptured off the earth. The first one is questions and answers part 364. They're asking brother Brandham is mercy over and no one can be saved. Brother Ram says, "Don't never think that." He said, "The seventh church age." We're at the end of the seventh church age. When I say the end, that doesn't mean it's this very hour, this very minute. So, Brother Ram says we're at the end of the Leodysian church age, but we're still in the Leodysian church age. Brother Ram said, "So, just keep on believing, keep on praying. God's still got mercy open. Just keep flowing into it as fast as you can. God will do the stopping when it's time to stop." Beautiful quote here. We're at the end of the seven church age, but it's not the very end. Second quote is from part four of questions and answers 1964. He was asked, "Brother Brandon, have you made statements recently concerning that church age has ended?" Leodysa, he said, "No, I never said it's ended. If you did, you misunderstood it or I said it wrong." So I love Brother Am's humility. This is the last church age is the end of the church age is the Leosa. It hasn't ended. When it ends, the church is gone. Now friends, we are not gone. We're still here. So the Leoian church age is still going on. But Ram says, "So as long as the church is here, it hasn't ended." So preachers that tell you Leosia has ended, they don't know the quotes. They're wrong. We feel sorry for them, but let's pray for them. And next, Brother Ram says it just as plainly a few paragraphs later. Questions, answers, part 464. The church age ending and is blacked out. The bride is called, "We have already entered into the tribulation period." With a question mark. No, no, no. The bride when she's taken from the church then the church age will cease. Leodosa goes into chaos. That's the tribulation period. The bride goes to glory. And the tribulation period sets in upon the sleeping virgin for three and a half years while Israel is getting its prophecy. So according to brother Brandham, the church age lasts until the bride goes to glory. Now next in the final section I just want to use some more quotes from late November and December 1965 saying we're still in Leodysia trying to do God a service without it being God's will. November 27th brother Ram says how many knows that this is the seventh church age. Say amen. Congregation says amen. The Leoysian age a lukewarm that God spews out of his mouth. Notice brother Ram says this is the seventh church age. Next, in the rapture 1965, a very famous, popular, well-loved, and often listened to sermon, brother Ram says, quote in paragraph 76, "We all know we're living in the Leoian age. There will never be another age to it. It can't be. So, we're living in the Leoian age." And I'd say, "Yes, brother Ram, we all know we're in the Leoian age. Those of us who are baptized with the Holy Ghost and have the right teaching from the scripture, but a lot of preachers don't say we're in the Leodysian age, but brother Ram said, "We all know we're living in the Leoian age." We are living in the Leoian age. The third quote is from modern events made clear by prophecy. Paragraph 19. I might have played this earlier, but it's worth listening to again. The Leosian church age. This seven church age that we're in now is naked, miserable, blind, and don't know it. What age are we in now? Brother Ram said the very month he died. We are in the Leodysian church age. This seventh church age we are in now. And finally in the last sermon, the last full sermon brother Ram ever preached leadership 1965 December 7th. Brother Ram said in paragraph 305, he's making the altar call. Oh, think today the hearts are becoming stony filled with the world indifferent church members lukewarm like that rich young ruler and don't know that the great Holy Spirit standing knocking at the door in this Leodysian church age. So friends, brother Ram is clearly saying the Holy Ghost is here in this leodyian church age still knocking at the doors of hearts. Praise God for that. Praise God for his mercy. Brother Ramb believed mercy was still available and we were still living in the Leodysian church age until the bride goes home in the rapture into glory with her husband the Lord Jesus Christ. In closing friends, hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God. It was very refreshing to go back and revisit the bride age. So friends, many people say, let's say what the tapes say. I agree. Brother Ram said that and God hiding himself in simplicity. Now of course he means as it lines up with the word of God. Brother Ram was not telling us to be parrots and just repeat everything he said. Brother Ram was not telling us to idolize every word on the tape. That's idolatry. That's heresy. Brother Ram said he's not infallible. In 1961, questions and answers. Brother Ram said, "My answers are not infallible, but the scriptur is infallible." He said, "I'm sure all of you understand that." And yes, we're sure all people that have the baptism of the Holy Ghost will understand that that Brother Ram is not infallible. But people who are not born again will exalt the tapes to being equal with the Bible or above the Bible. That's wicked. That's sinful. That's heresy. So hopefully this video cleared up a lot of the misconceptions about the bride age. I've heard lots of different ideas, lots of different sermons about the bride age. But if you just look at what brother Brandham said, he said it was the revival after the Isuza Street revival. By God's grace, we use the context of all six quotes. Brother Ram talked about the bride age. He was not saying Leodysia was over. He was simply saying the Holy Ghost moved out of the Isuza Street revival into his revival. And it's the bride's revival and it's still going around the world now. It's the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Now, we are waiting for the latter rain to fall. Brother Ram told us that the latter rain is the showdown between Jesus and the denominations right before the rapture. But we have the bride's revival. The bride is awakened. We have, as brother Bram said, we have resurrected life. We have revival. That's what a revival is. It's resurrection. We have resurrected souls by the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Thank God that God is rich in mercy according to Ephesians 2 and has quickened our dead lives and made us alive by true salvation by grace through faith, not of ourselves. It is a gift of God. And then that same grace of God led us into two more works of grace. Sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the soul. Friends, if you're not saved, repent of all your sins. Put your faith in the blood of Jesus Christ. Confess every sin you know. Be baptized in water in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Learn to daily seek God. Read your Bible. Pray daily. Obey daily. And at one glorious moment, God will baptize your soul with the baptism of the Holy Ghost. You'll be sealed until the day of your redemption. You'll have power, as Jesus said, to be a witness to your family, to your co-workers, to your friends, to your church. You have power to be a spiritfilled witness of Jesus Christ. If you have any questions, concerns, or testimonies about this video, please contact me. God bless you, and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart. &gt;&gt; Very happy to be here this afternoon. And again in defense of the gospel of Jesus Christ to bring the good tidings, the good news that Jesus raised from the dead, living among man today, his church. The same Jesus that was yesterday will be today and forever. He is never failed. [Music]
