[0:02] then we find out the Apostle is a
[0:04] special man he's a he's a set an order
[0:08] he's a man that's sent from God to set
[0:11] the things in
[0:14] order greetings friends in the matchless
[0:16] name of the Lord Jesus Christ what is an
[0:19] apostle this video is going to answer a
[0:21] viewer's question who asked me about
[0:23] this the viewer said please cover the
[0:25] entire fivefold ministry as a position
[0:28] of calling I I appreciate the questions
[0:31] an apostle means he that is sent
[0:34] according to the Greek Lexicon it also
[0:36] means a delegate messenger one sent
[0:40] forth with orders God's Prophet brother
[0:42] random often said Apostle means one sent
[0:45] and that definition of course is in the
[0:47] Lexicon hi friends I'm Jesse Smith
[0:49] pastor bride of Christ Fellowship here
[0:51] in akan Ohio USA and I defend the
[0:53] original Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ
[0:55] that he revealed to St Paul then had to
[0:57] restore through Martin Luther John
[0:58] Wesley and the late Prophet William Mary
[1:00] and brandham who lived from 1909 to 1965
[1:04] and I also defend brother Ram's Godly
[1:06] Christian character let's begin with
[1:08] defining an apostle again here is a
[1:11] screenshot an apostle is he that is sent
[1:14] a delegate messenger one sent forth with
[1:19] orders God's Prophet brother randam
[1:21] repeated this in 1955 position in Christ
[1:24] he said Apostle means one cent and I
[1:26] like this statement I've often wondered
[1:28] why the missionary ever wants to be
[1:29] called missionary so brother like the
[1:31] word Apostle of course so do we we're
[1:34] Bible Believers let's listen to the
[1:36] quote Apostle uh word Apostle means one
[1:40] that's sent I've often wondered why the
[1:43] missionary ever wanted to be called a
[1:46] missionary a missionary is an
[1:49] apostle the word a missionary means one
[1:51] sent Apostle means one sent a missionary
[1:55] is an
[1:56] apostle next brother B said Apostle is a
[1:59] special man he's a Setter in order this
[2:02] means he goes into a area where there's
[2:04] no Believers he makes converts and then
[2:06] he sets them in order with pastors
[2:09] Elders deacons and so forth he's a
[2:12] special man let's listen to the quote
[2:14] then we find out the Apostle is a
[2:16] special man he's a he's a Setter in
[2:19] order he's a man that's sent from God to
[2:22] set the things in order brother brandom
[2:25] also said the Apostle is the highest
[2:27] office in the Bible in the New Testament
[2:29] he said this in remembering the Lord
[2:31] 1962 he said it's the highest calling in
[2:34] the Bible higher than a prophet he's
[2:37] talking about how judas's scarrett sold
[2:39] out this office but clearly said an
[2:41] apostle is higher than a prophet let's
[2:43] listen to the quote he sold Jesus for
[2:47] personal
[2:48] gain we ridicu J Judas we say he was a
[2:54] filthy a bad guy he's not fit for no
[3:00] place or no Society he isn't fit for
[3:03] heaven why he sold his Lord if you had
[3:08] the opportunity to even to be a a
[3:13] disciple to be an apostle the highest
[3:16] calling in the
[3:18] Bible higher than a prophet he had the
[3:22] opportunity to be a a apostle and sold
[3:27] that right for personal gain am and now
[3:32] he has to remember that that's how he
[3:34] remembers Jesus personal gain in Mark
[3:38] 10: 28-31 Jesus Promised the apostles
[3:42] the highest reward he said they would
[3:44] get a h hundredfold in this world
[3:46] speaking of Christian friends and
[3:48] fellowship and support but also a h
[3:50] hundredfold in the world to come another
[3:53] scripture says Jesus also told Peter
[3:56] that he and the other Apostles would
[3:58] judge the 12 tribes of Israel in the
[4:01] Regeneration or in the Millennium so
[4:03] they have a special place of leadership
[4:05] and oversight in the Thousand-Year
[4:07] Millennial Reign the next scripture 1
[4:10] Corinthians
[4:11] 12:28 Paul says God set some in the
[4:14] church first apostles secondarily
[4:17] prophets thirdly teachers and after that
[4:20] Miracles then Gifts of healing helps
[4:22] governments diversity of tongues so here
[4:24] St Paul sets forth the fact that
[4:27] Apostles are of the highest Authority
[4:29] now that we've defined the Apostle let's
[4:31] look at a few Bible examples here the
[4:34] first time the word Apostle is used in
[4:35] the Bible is Matthew 10 1-4 in Matthew
[4:39] 10:2 it says now the names of the 12
[4:42] apostles are these so Jesus called 12
[4:45] disciples or 12 Apostles he was going to
[4:47] send them out also want to read Luke
[4:49] 10:1 this proves Jesus Christ was the
[4:52] greatest Apostle of all time that's what
[4:55] even brother brandham said Luke 10:1
[4:58] after these things the Lord appointed 70
[5:00] other also and sent them two by two
[5:02] before his face into every city and
[5:04] place with he himself would come so
[5:08] here's the order and pattern of ministry
[5:11] by the Lord Jesus Christ he would send
[5:13] his Apostles out two by two they'd go
[5:16] into a city they'd heal the sick they do
[5:19] signs wonders and miracles and then
[5:20] Jesus himself would come so this is the
[5:23] organizational plan of the greatest
[5:26] missionary ever the Lord Jesus Christ
[5:28] and the Bible also says he would heal
[5:30] entire multitudes anyone who believed
[5:33] could be healed Jesus Christ the
[5:35] greatest missionary and brother Ram said
[5:37] that in faith cometh by hearing 1954 he
[5:40] said Paul is the greatest missionary
[5:42] since
[5:44] Christ so Jesus Christ is the greatest
[5:46] missionary Paul was the greatest
[5:49] missionary of Sinners saved by grace
[5:51] because the Lord Jesus was born of a
[5:53] virgin without sin St Paul had three
[5:56] missionary Journeys in the book of Acts
[5:58] and he started churches such as Antioch
[6:01] in Bida Iconium Lyra Derby Philippi
[6:06] thessalonica Corinth Ephesus and more
[6:10] let's look at a few more scriptures
[6:11] Matthew 28:19 and 20 Jesus tells his
[6:15] Apostles to go therefore teach All
[6:18] Nations so we see here Apostles must be
[6:20] teachers of the word of God yes they
[6:22] must have signs wonders and miracles but
[6:24] they also must have the ability to teach
[6:26] and baptize teaching them to observe all
[6:29] things whatsoever I commanded you so
[6:32] Apostles do Great Signs wonders and
[6:34] miracles they convince people of the
[6:35] power of God but then they also teach
[6:37] them or instruct them on how to live a
[6:39] Christian Life here's a beautiful Bible
[6:41] example of Jesus telling St Paul to stay
[6:44] in the city of Corinth to establish a
[6:46] church in that City Jesus told Paul not
[6:49] to fear he said no man will hurt thee
[6:53] and Paul stayed there a year and 6
[6:55] months teaching the word of God among
[6:57] them another example is Titus 15 Paul
[7:00] said he left Titus in cre that he should
[7:03] set in order the things that are wanting
[7:05] and ordain Elders in every city as Paul
[7:08] had appointed him so Titus was most
[7:10] likely an apostle Titus was called his
[7:13] son by St Paul in Titus one4 and his
[7:17] brother Titus was called his partner and
[7:19] fellow helper in 2 Corinthians 2:13 and
[7:23] second Corinthians
[7:25] 8:23 Titus went up with the apostles to
[7:28] Jerusalem in Galatians Ians 2:1 and he
[7:31] had Earnest care for the churches 2
[7:33] Corinthians
[7:35] 8:16 Paul's Second Epistle to the
[7:38] Corinthians was sent to them by the hand
[7:40] of Titus according to 2 Corinthians 8:16
[7:43] through1 18 and chapter 9 veres 2-4 and
[7:47] 2 Corinthians
[7:50] 12:8 next in act 13: 1-4 we see Paul and
[7:53] Barnabas sent forth by the Holy Ghost
[7:56] this is how missionaries or Apostles are
[7:58] sent forth they're sent forth by God and
[8:01] of course before they're sent forth they
[8:03] have to minister unto the Lord with
[8:04] prayer and fastings so Apostles humble
[8:07] themselves they fast and pray and wait
[8:09] for the leadership of the Lord to send
[8:10] them forth and one more verse I want to
[8:12] read here Mark
[8:15] 63-32 in these verses Jesus tells the
[8:18] apostles to come apart and rest after
[8:21] their long missionary trip so the
[8:23] Apostles of Jesus needed rest due to the
[8:26] difficult labor travel and
[8:28] Ministry before closing I want to talk
[8:30] about some of my observations about
[8:32] Apostles or
[8:34] missionaries personally I know very few
[8:37] Apostles because I don't get out very
[8:39] much I've never traveled very much I
[8:41] spent most of my years as a preacher as
[8:44] a pastor so I've always stayed with the
[8:45] flock for the most part the most
[8:48] biblical missionary or Apostle I've ever
[8:50] seen is a brother from Guyana South
[8:53] America he flies into the remote parts
[8:55] of Brazil in order to make converts to
[8:59] the message of the hour usually they
[9:01] introduce the Lord Jesus Christ baptism
[9:03] first God's given him many wonderful
[9:05] signs Miracles and wonders he goes to
[9:08] such remote parts that he has to get on
[9:10] a boat many times and just travel down
[9:13] the Amazon by boat in order to reach
[9:15] these Villages an interesting
[9:17] observation I found was that most
[9:19] missionaries from the United States that
[9:21] call themselves missionaries when they
[9:23] go overseas they're really just doing
[9:25] Evangelistic work and not missionary
[9:28] work because missionary work or Apostle
[9:31] work means you go to a place where
[9:32] there's no Believers and you try to make
[9:35] Believers in order to set in order a new
[9:37] church and when this realization from
[9:40] the Bible came to me back in about 2010
[9:43] I was making about four or five trips
[9:45] down to South America I thought I was
[9:46] doing missionary work and I found out I
[9:48] wasn't I was doing Evangelistic work and
[9:51] so on one or two occasions I'd asked the
[9:53] brother from South America can we go out
[9:55] into a public place where there's no
[9:57] Believers and try to make belie belies
[10:00] we did that twice I think and the second
[10:02] time I think we had a few converts that
[10:04] were baptized in the name of the Lord
[10:06] Jesus Christ according of the brother
[10:08] but that's real missionary work when you
[10:10] go out to people who have not believed
[10:12] people that have not heard the message
[10:14] and you try to establish new churches
[10:16] also I want to say that ministers in the
[10:18] fivefold ministry can have more than one
[10:19] gift St Paul was a prophet because he
[10:22] prophesied numerous times like about the
[10:24] Rapture in 1 Corinthians 15: 51-54
[10:29] he even said he was a prophet and the
[10:31] word of God came to him in 1 Corinthians
[10:33] 14 he called himself a teacher in 1
[10:36] Timothy 2:7 he called himself an apostle
[10:39] in Romans
[10:40] 1:8 and he was doing Evangelistic work
[10:43] in Acts
[10:44] 1536 and 41 brother Ram said St Paul was
[10:48] the pastor at Ephesus remember he was
[10:50] there 3 years so brother ramam said he
[10:52] was doing pastoral work there so Paul no
[10:55] doubt had all five preaching gifts of
[10:57] the fivefold ministry and because Jesus
[11:00] Christ was the greatest preacher of all
[11:01] time we'd say the only real preacher
[11:03] Jesus had all the preaching gifts he was
[11:05] an apostle as brother Ram said he was
[11:07] the greatest missionary or Apostle ever
[11:09] no doubt he was a teacher no doubt he
[11:11] was a pastor to his little flock of
[11:14] Apostles he did Evangelistic work and of
[11:17] course he was a prophet the god prophet
[11:20] and brother Ram said Jesus had all the
[11:22] fruits of the spirit so Jesus had all
[11:23] the fruits of the spirit all the
[11:25] preaching gifts and he had all nine
[11:27] gifts of the holy spirit as well even
[11:29] Martin Luther according to brother
[11:30] brandham had all nine spiritual
[11:33] gifts so we know preachers can have more
[11:36] than one preaching gift and also more
[11:37] than one of the nine gifts of the holy
[11:40] spirit getting back to St Paul it's easy
[11:42] to see how Paul's gifts were used at
[11:44] different times as far as his five
[11:46] preaching gifts he was Apostle Paul was
[11:49] an apostle when starting a new church
[11:51] like in Corinth there in act chapter
[11:54] 18 but then he moved in the Pastoral
[11:57] role when he stayed in Ephesus for 3
[11:59] years years giving them the whole
[12:00] counsel of God according to acts chap 20
[12:03] and then once he would leave Ephesus
[12:05] then he would be an apostle go back into
[12:07] the Apostle work to start other churches
[12:09] on his travels we also see this in
[12:12] brother Brandon's Ministry he started
[12:14] preaching as a pastor in Jeffersonville
[12:17] and then the Holy Spirit sent him out to
[12:18] be an evangelist and then he would do
[12:21] Apostle work such as when he went to
[12:22] India 1954 won many souls to the Lord
[12:25] Jesus Christ so we can see brother Ram
[12:28] go between the different preaching gifts
[12:30] that he had and apparently he saw his
[12:32] role as a type of a pastor maybe like a
[12:35] senior pastor during the end of his
[12:38] ministry because he spent extensive time
[12:41] in
[12:41] 1962 preaching at brandham Tabernacle
[12:44] teaching at brandham Tabernacle to store
[12:46] up the food that we would need today he
[12:48] taught extensively of course in
[12:50] 1963 and I want to play one quote from
[12:53] 1963 brother random said you look to me
[12:55] as your pastor and I am your pastor so
[12:58] this was probably like in a senior
[13:00] pastor role so let's listen to this
[13:02] quote from perfect Faith
[13:04] 1963 know ye what I have done to
[13:09] you you call me your pastor and you say
[13:13] well for so I
[13:15] am if I your pastor have been identified
[13:19] by Jesus Christ that I do his work then
[13:24] believe my word
[13:27] amen by Act ing this Act of Faith by
[13:30] laying hands upon you I have condemned
[13:34] the disease and affliction that's
[13:36] bothering
[13:37] [Music]
[13:38] you in closing friends I hope this video
[13:42] was a blessing by the grace of God the
[13:44] apostles the highest calling in the
[13:45] Bible Jesus Christ promised the greatest
[13:48] reward for the Apostle so we've covered
[13:51] the Apostle and I have a video on a
[13:53] pastor Lord willing will try to get to
[13:54] the three final preaching gifts
[13:57] evangelist teacher and profit by the
[14:00] grace of God remember Jesus told us to
[14:03] pray that God would send forth labors
[14:05] into the kingdom into the field so let's
[14:08] end with a prayer for the apostles dear
[14:11] God we love you Lord God we know this is
[14:13] the final Church age Lord God but still
[14:16] there is a harvest that needs to be done
[14:18] so father I pray you'd send forth
[14:20] Apostles into the field for your glory
[14:22] Lord God that they could win souls and
[14:25] set up churches that would Worship You
