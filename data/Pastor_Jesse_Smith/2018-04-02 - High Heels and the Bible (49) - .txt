This video offers three reasons why the Bible does not support the wearing of high heels. First, a high heel-like shoe is mentioned with the prideful, haughty daughters of Zion in Isaiah 3:16. Second, damage the human body, which is the temple of the Holy Ghost. Third, high heels present the female body in a seductive, sexual manner that can cause mental mental adulteries based upon Matthew 5:27-28. Two scientific research articles are presented that support these facts.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to teach what the Bible says about high heels with all reverence and humility I believe the Bible is against the wearing of high heels there are three reasons why the Bible's against the wearing of high heels first a high heel like shoe is alluded to in Isaiah chapter 3 verse 16 second high heels damage the human body which is the temple of the Holy Ghost third high heels present the female body in a seductive sexual manner reason number one scripture alludes to the haughty prideful and seductive daughters of Zion wearing high-heeled like shoes in Isaiah 3 verse 16 moreover the Lord sayeth because the daughters of Zion are haughty and walk with stretch forth necks and wanton eyes walking and mincing as they go and making a tinkling with their feet these judgement bound prideful women were mincing when they walked and the tinkling sound was heard the word mincing means taking short steps and high heels naturally limit the length of each step making sounds with the feet is the definition of tinkling note that their necks were also stretched out which would be a result of wearing these unnatural and ungodly feet we're based upon the evidence in the Isaiah text there is a strong case that the haughty daughters of Zion were wearing some type of high-heeled shoe recall that there is nothing new Under the Sun according to Ecclesiastes chapter 1 verse 9 high heels cannot be a new design that the world has never seen before but rather a revival of an older rebellious and seductive act high heels cannot be considered an area of Christian Liberty either for we will see shortly that there are scientific evidence that women in high heels cause men to become more sexually attracted to them meaning that high heels promote lustful thoughts any act that causes another person to stumble into sin is then a for act and cannot be considered a Christian liberty holy scripture never supports men or women wearing high-heeled shoes since there is an absence of God requesting believers to wear high heels we should refrain from wearing them reason number two high heels damaged the human body or the temple of the Holy Ghost there is scientific evidence that supports the damaging physical effects that wearing high heels has upon people a research article from 2014 stated that high heels put excessive stress upon the foot bones and ultimately lead to damage to the musculoskeletal system Christian should be alarmed at any activity that damages their bodies or temples of the Holy Ghost recall that Christians do not belong to themselves but are the purchased property of Jesus Christ and therefore should not purposely prop up their bodies in a way that will lead to musculoskeletal damage later on in life 1st Corinthians 6 verse 19 and 20 what know ye not that your body is the temple the Holy Ghost which is in you which you have of God and ye are not your own for ye are bought with the price therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit which are gods reason number 3 high-heels present the female body in a seductive sexual manner a recent 2017 study suggested that men are more attracted to women in high heels due to the lumbar curvature that high heels produce while preparing this video about high heels I spoke with a licensed podiatrist about the effects of high heels this doctor stated that high heels are the absolute worst shoe a human being could wear due to the damaging effects they have upon a person's entire body he also noted that during his training he had multiple textbooks state the fact that high heels never help the human body they only damage it wearing high heels then cannot be considered modest because it draws sexual attention to the wearer recall that all Christians are called to dress in modest apparel which is apparel that does not draw attention to themselves 1st Timothy 2:9 in like manner also that women adorn themselves in modest apparel with shamefacedness and sobriety not with broided hair or gold or pearls or costly array furthermore high heels lead others to Harbor lustful thoughts of fornication or adultery that sinners will have to answer for on the day of judgement according to our Lord Jesus Christ in Matthew 5 verses 27 and 28 jesus said you have heard that it was said by them of old time thou shalt not commit adultery but I say unto you that whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart in conclusion we pray that you will take heed to God's Word and abstain from wearing high heels for the biblically based reasons presented on this video if you would like more information about the history of high heels and the scriptures we reference in this video please contact us god bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
