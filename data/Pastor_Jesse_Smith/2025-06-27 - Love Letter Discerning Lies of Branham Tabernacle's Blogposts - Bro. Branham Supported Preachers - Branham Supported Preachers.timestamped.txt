[0:03] Every man or that feels a call of God
[0:06] upon his life, get into the ministry.
[0:08] Start preaching. We need him.
[0:12] Get into the ministry. Start preaching.
[0:15] We need him.
[0:18] Greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:20] of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of
[0:22] this video is to read through a recent
[0:24] post from Random Tabernacle and rightly
[0:27] divide the word of truth. One of the
[0:30] commenters on a video who is a tape
[0:32] listener said that these blog posts were
[0:35] love letters. And so I've read these
[0:37] blog posts over the years and I do not
[0:39] believe they're love letters as far as
[0:41] the true love of God because the Bible
[0:43] says in Ephesians 4:15 that we speak the
[0:47] truth in love. And this is in the
[0:49] context of the five-fold ministry.
[0:51] Ephesians 4 8-16.
[0:54] When we speak the truth in love, we grow
[0:56] up into him, Christ, in all things,
[1:00] which is the head, even Christ. So, when
[1:02] we speak the truth in love, we grow up
[1:05] into the word. So, I thought I would
[1:07] test this commenter's claim to see if
[1:11] these blog posts were truly love letters
[1:13] or see if they were lie letters. This
[1:16] video goes along with a recent set of
[1:18] videos I've done about Premium
[1:20] Tabernacle. One was called awful cult
[1:22] won't go to church released June 6, 2025
[1:28] and the other was called abandon five
[1:31] parallels with Brandham Tabernacle and
[1:33] King Ahaz shutting the church doors the
[1:36] idolatry of Brandom Tabernacle. So when
[1:38] this commenter said the blog posts were
[1:40] love letters, I knew that was wrong. So,
[1:42] I thought I'd give one example of a blog
[1:45] post and show how it's off the word and
[1:48] the people that are being deceived here
[1:49] are just taking in the false doctrine,
[1:52] the false propaganda, and not really
[1:54] getting to hear what brother said about
[1:56] these questions. So, with that, let's
[1:58] get started here by the grace of God.
[2:01] This is a blog post from March 23rd,
[2:05] 2025, so about 3 months ago. This one
[2:07] really stood out to me, so I'd like to
[2:09] go through this one. I'll leave a link
[2:11] to it in the description. The apparent
[2:14] love letter says, "Dear tape listeners,"
[2:16] and then there's five questions and
[2:18] answers. Let's go through each one of
[2:19] these questions and we'll show how these
[2:21] are not true statements. We can prove it
[2:24] by the word and also quotes from God's
[2:26] prophet, brother Brandham. The first
[2:28] question and answer is, are we in his
[2:30] perfect will by playing the tapes?
[2:34] Answer, yes.
[2:36] Now, I want you to notice here just
[2:37] one-word answers. No Bible verses were
[2:41] given. Now, the pastor did list Bible
[2:43] verses at the bottom. We'll go through
[2:45] those at the end.
[2:47] And this proves the Bible is not their
[2:49] absolute. There is no Bible verse that
[2:51] says you're in the perfect will of God
[2:54] by pressing play and neglecting the
[2:57] five-fold ministries. This proves they
[2:58] are idolattors. The current pastor is
[3:01] not like his father, Brother Brandham,
[3:03] who said the following. I have to answer
[3:05] from the Bible. Notice Brother Brandham
[3:08] had to answer from the Bible. His
[3:10] youngest son does not answer from the
[3:12] Bible. Let's listen to the quote. For my
[3:14] part, I I would know I have to answer
[3:17] from the Bible. I have to answer from
[3:20] the Bible.
[3:22] And remember friends, Brother Brandham's
[3:24] absolute was Jesus Christ. It's the word
[3:27] of the living God, the Bible. Brother
[3:30] Ram said, "If I die in my tracks, my
[3:32] absolute is Jesus Christ.
[3:34] If I die in my tracks, my absolute is
[3:37] Jesus Christ.
[3:39] That's what I believe. And so if Brother
[3:42] Ram's youngest son had the absolute of
[3:45] the Bible, he would list Bible
[3:47] scriptures for these answers. And of
[3:49] course, there are none listed. Let's
[3:51] listen to these quotes. My absolute is
[3:52] Jesus Christ. Brother Ram notices
[3:55] everybody makes their own absolute. And
[3:56] that's what Brandham Tabernacle has
[3:58] done. But we have one absolute. That's
[4:00] the word of living God. And then he
[4:02] says, "God's absolute is his word." So
[4:05] God's own absolute is his word. The
[4:08] absolute of the Brandham tabernacle is
[4:10] the tapes, which is idolatry. Let's
[4:12] listen to the quotes. And that's what's
[4:14] the matter in the Christian faith today.
[4:17] We got too many traffic jams. Everybody
[4:19] making their own absolute when we got
[4:21] one absolute and that's the word of the
[4:23] living God. That settles it forever. No
[4:26] matter what anyone else says, it's
[4:29] almost gotten to a place like it was in
[4:31] the days of judges. Everybody has their
[4:33] own absolute. But it all fails like the
[4:36] Pharaohs and so forth. But God's
[4:38] absolute is his word. He gives it and
[4:40] heavens and earth will pass away, but it
[4:42] shall never pass away. I like that.
[4:46] Because you get two men, you got two
[4:47] opinions. It's got to come to one final
[4:51] absolute.
[4:53] And my absolute is the word, the Bible.
[4:57] And as a pastor here of the church, my
[5:01] absolute is the word. Let's look at some
[5:04] more quotes from brother Brandham. Did
[5:05] Brother Brandham ever say that the
[5:07] people were in the perfect will of God
[5:09] by playing the tapes and not listening
[5:11] to preachers? No. But I want you to see
[5:13] brother Brandham prayed to God, let us
[5:16] walk in your perfect will. And he says,
[5:18] "Take all the word, not just a word here
[5:21] and there, the full gospel, all that
[5:24] Jesus taught us to do." He said, "The
[5:26] acts of the apostles is not just
[5:28] framework. It's the word of God." So I
[5:31] want you to notice in this quote,
[5:32] brother Brandham says, "The perfect will
[5:34] of God is taking every word Jesus taught
[5:36] and the acts of the apostles." In other
[5:38] words, the gospels in the Bible,
[5:40] Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, and the
[5:42] book of Acts is the perfect will of God.
[5:46] And where did Jesus ever say it's the
[5:48] perfect will of God to play tapes and
[5:50] not listen to living preachers in the
[5:52] five-fold ministry? You're right. Jesus
[5:55] never said that. Neither did the book of
[5:56] Acts say that. Let's listen to the
[5:58] quote. Oh dear God,
[6:01] we don't want your permissive will.
[6:03] Father, let us walk in your perfect
[6:06] will. Let us just not take a word here
[6:09] and there and make it to fit a dogma or
[6:11] creed or something. Let us take the word
[6:14] as it is. Believing the full gospel,
[6:18] all that Jesus taught for us to do.
[6:22] We do not believe that the acts of the
[6:24] apostles is just a framework. We believe
[6:27] it's the word of God. It's the acts of
[6:29] your holy spirit in the apostles. And we
[6:32] believe that the same Holy Spirit, Lord,
[6:34] that come upon them and the way they
[6:36] acted, it'll do the same thing in us
[6:38] when it comes upon us if it's the same
[6:40] spirit. Next in the church age book,
[6:42] brother Brandham said the spirit of God
[6:45] has one voice and the spirit of God
[6:48] would only say what the word says.
[6:50] Brother Brandham said Paul warned them
[6:53] that even he himself nor anyone else
[6:55] could change one word of what he had
[6:57] been given by revelation.
[7:00] So Brandham tabernacle changes many
[7:02] words about the five-fold ministry. But
[7:04] brother told us the true prophet of God
[7:07] would not change one word. Paul said
[7:09] that proves brother Brandham was a
[7:11] prophet of God. That proves Brandham
[7:13] Tabernacle currently today does not have
[7:15] a prophet of God. Let's listen to the
[7:17] quote. How careful we must be to hear
[7:19] one voice for the spirit has but one
[7:22] voice which is the voice of God. Paul
[7:25] warned them to say what he said even as
[7:27] Peter did likewise. He warned them that
[7:30] even he Paul could not change one word
[7:33] of what he had given by revelation.
[7:36] Oh, how important it is to hear the
[7:38] voice of God by way of his messengers
[7:40] and then say what has been given them to
[7:42] say to the churches. The second question
[7:45] and answer says, "Does the bride need
[7:47] more than what is said on the tapes?"
[7:50] Their answer was no. So, is this true?
[7:53] Is this God's love? Or is this a lie?
[7:56] Did Brother Ram ever say this, that the
[7:58] bride only needs what's on the tapes?
[8:01] And of course, no. Brother Ram never
[8:02] said this. But let's look at what did
[8:04] brother Ram say we actually need. Let's
[8:07] look at that word need and look at
[8:09] quotes where brother Ram said what we
[8:11] need. And there are quotes where brother
[8:13] Ram said we need preachers. He never
[8:16] said we need tape players. Look it up. I
[8:19] challenge anyone to look it up. In 1955
[8:22] in the sermon job, brother Bram said,
[8:23] "We need preachers that'll preach the
[8:25] word." He didn't say, "We need preachers
[8:27] that will sit down and press play."
[8:29] Let's listen to the quote. We need
[8:31] preachers that'll preach the word. Tell
[8:34] us the truth about
[8:37] tell us we must be born again and bring
[8:39] us on the basis of the shepherd to Jesus
[8:42] Christ the son of God. Introduce all the
[8:44] good things that God's got for us.
[8:46] That's the pastor. There it is. That's
[8:49] the kind you get the violence from.
[8:51] Might be in a bar or a mission, but just
[8:53] so you're getting fed is the main thing.
[8:56] Friends, brother M never said you only
[8:58] need one preacher. me. Brother Ram never
[9:00] said, "Someday before the rapture, I'll
[9:02] command all preachers to sit down and be
[9:04] quiet so everyone can follow my son and
[9:06] his schedule." That's a bunch of
[9:08] nonsense. In fact, Brother Ram said men
[9:11] would come after him and make more
[9:13] sense. Brother Ram hoped they could make
[9:15] it come to life and they have. That's
[9:18] how I came in the message. God made the
[9:20] message come to life to other men,
[9:21] living men who preach it to me, and I
[9:23] received it. And now I do the same by
[9:26] the grace of God. This is from birth
[9:27] pain 65. Let's listen to the quote.
[9:30] These men, if they pick up this and go
[9:32] out with it, they can make more sense to
[9:34] it. See to bring it to a place you would
[9:36] I just want to lay this seat. Hope they
[9:38] make it come to life. notice. But I'm
[9:41] very thankful for these open doors that
[9:43] I've had to go into and the inspiration
[9:46] it's given to young men like your pastor
[9:47] here that's caused them as I'm beginning
[9:49] to get old and know that my days are
[9:52] numbered and know now that these young
[9:54] men can take this message and sweep it
[9:57] on to the coming of the Lord if he
[9:59] doesn't come in and my generation which
[10:01] I'm hoping to see him. I look daily for
[10:04] him and watch keeping myself prepared
[10:07] for that hour.
[10:09] Next, Brother Random said, "Water from
[10:11] the rock." 55, "The spirit of God takes
[10:14] the word just as we have need of it,
[10:16] where the preacher will not try to use
[10:18] his own thoughts, just let the Holy
[10:20] Spirit move." And brother Ram tells the
[10:22] congregation not to criticize it. Well,
[10:23] that's what Brandham Tabernacle does.
[10:25] They criticize living preachers. But
[10:27] Brother Ram said, "That's what we need.
[10:29] We need the Holy Spirit to anoint
[10:32] preachers to give us the word of God."
[10:35] Brother Ram never said, "We just need
[10:36] what's said on the tapes." Let's listen
[10:38] to the quote. The Holy Spirit takes the
[10:40] word of God and just gives it right out
[10:42] in every heart just as we have need for
[10:44] it. If we can get ourselves submitted to
[10:47] the Holy Spirit, the word of the
[10:49] preacher will not try to use his own
[10:51] thoughts. Just let the Holy Spirit move
[10:54] and let the congregation not try to
[10:56] criticize, but just set with an open
[10:58] heart and honest before God, then we'll
[11:01] have a real meeting.
[11:03] Next, in the uncertain sound, brother
[11:05] Ram said, "We need men, not just one
[11:07] man." Notice, Brother Ram said, "What we
[11:09] need today is men and preachers that
[11:12] preach God's word." Brother Ram never
[11:15] said, "We just need to press play and
[11:17] listen to tapes only." Let's listen to
[11:19] the quote. What I say today, what we
[11:21] need today is man with experience that
[11:24] knows what God means and takes God's
[11:25] experience by God's Bible and preaches
[11:27] God's word, has God's signs and God's
[11:30] vindication.
[11:31] If you don't know beans from or split
[11:34] beans from coffee, preach anyhow.
[11:36] There's one thing you know. If your
[11:38] candle got lit, go tell somebody how it
[11:39] got lit. Maybe theirs will get lit, too.
[11:42] Right off of yours. Amen. It's what we
[11:44] need today. In the next quote, Questions
[11:47] Answers part three, they asked Brother
[11:49] Brandham, "Is it true no one should
[11:50] preach but you?" And notice Brother Ram
[11:52] said, "We need them. We need every man
[11:54] that feels a call of God on his life get
[11:56] in the ministry and start preaching." He
[11:58] didn't say get into the ministry and
[11:59] start pressing play. So who's right? Is
[12:01] Brandham Tabernacle currently right or
[12:03] was brother Brandham right? Brother
[12:05] Brandham was right. Brother Ram said we
[12:07] need them. Hallelujah. Let's listen to
[12:09] the quote now. Brother Brandham, is it
[12:13] true that no one should preach but you?
[12:18] We have seen
[12:21] your
[12:22] We have seen you ordained man. We do
[12:26] don't believe you would do that if there
[12:30] were not if they were not to preach.
[12:33] Mercy, brother, sister, ever who told
[12:36] you nobody's preached for me, I'd sure
[12:38] be a four subject of God's with all
[12:40] that. No. Every man or that feels a call
[12:44] of God upon his life, get into the
[12:47] ministry, start preaching. We need them.
[12:51] Man of God are anointed all over the
[12:52] world to preach the gospel. See, I'm
[12:55] just one little pebble on the beach
[12:57] among many big stones. See, so uh
[13:01] there's just many that's more eligible,
[13:04] more worthy, more of anything to preach
[13:06] than me. I'm just one little humble
[13:10] person laying out ear. I'm one grain of
[13:12] wheat and a whole garner. See, so it's
[13:15] just, you know what I mean? Any man
[13:18] that's called of God needs to preach the
[13:20] gospel.
[13:22] Third question says, "Are we missing
[13:24] something by only listening to the
[13:25] tapes?" Their answer was, "No. Is that
[13:28] the truth or is that a lie? I believe
[13:31] it's a lie." Did Brother Ram ever say
[13:33] this? No, brother Ram never said this,
[13:35] but they asked Brother Brandham in
[13:37] questions and answers on the seal 63.
[13:39] Would the bride of Christ have a
[13:41] ministry before the rapture? And so the
[13:43] tape ministry people are missing out on
[13:46] what brother Bram said is the great
[13:48] ministry of the five-fold ministry, the
[13:51] living preachers, not the tape pressers
[13:54] or tape players. And notice the tape
[13:57] worshippers are missing out on the great
[13:59] ministry, the message of the hour.
[14:01] Brother Brandham calls the five-fold
[14:02] ministry the message of the hour.
[14:04] Brother Ram did not say there's only one
[14:06] gift and it was me. He said all these
[14:09] gifts are plural. Notice apostles, not
[14:12] just one. Prophets, not just one.
[14:14] Teachers, evangelists, pastors. Brother
[14:18] Ram used this in the plural, meaning
[14:20] there's more than one preacher. It's the
[14:23] entire five-fold ministry around the
[14:25] world. Let's listen to this quote. The
[14:27] five-fold ministry is the message of the
[14:29] hour. It's a great ministry. That's what
[14:31] Brandham Tabernacle is missing out on.
[14:33] Would the bride of Christ have Would the
[14:37] bride of Christ
[14:40] have a ministry before the rapture?
[14:43] Sure. That's what's going on right now.
[14:47] The bride of Christ certainly it is the
[14:50] message of the hour. Amen. The bride of
[14:52] Christ. Sure. She's consist of apostles,
[14:56] prophets, teachers, evangelists, and
[14:57] pastors. Is that right? That's the bride
[15:00] of Christ. Sure. She's got a ministry.
[15:02] Great ministry. the ministry of the
[15:03] hour. It'll be so humble. And let's look
[15:06] at that quote from earlier about is it
[15:08] true no one should preach but you notice
[15:10] Brandom Tabernacles missing out on four
[15:13] of the five folds of the five-fold
[15:16] ministry and really it's five out of
[15:18] fivefolds because God never called dead
[15:20] people to lead living people. God always
[15:23] called living preachers to lead the
[15:25] living. So is Brandon Tabernacle missing
[15:27] something? Yes, they're missing all
[15:29] fivefolds of the five-fold ministry. and
[15:32] ask yourself when did brother Ram change
[15:34] this? When did brother Ram said he was
[15:36] the only one to preach and we're just to
[15:38] sit down and just press play and obey.
[15:41] So this proves Brandham Tabernacle
[15:43] currently has changed the gospel.
[15:45] There's awful repercussions for that.
[15:47] Again, let's listen to the quote from
[15:48] questions and answers part three. Now,
[15:51] brother Brandham, is it true that no one
[15:54] should preach but you?
[15:58] We have seen
[16:00] your
[16:02] We have seen you ordained man. We do
[16:06] don't believe you would do that if there
[16:09] were not if they were not to preach.
[16:13] Mercy, brother, sister, ever who told
[16:16] you nobody's preached for me, I'd sure
[16:18] be a four subjects of God with all that.
[16:20] No. every man or that feels a call of
[16:24] God upon his life, get into the
[16:26] ministry, start preaching. We need him.
[16:30] And then remember that birth pains quote
[16:32] from 65. This proves Brennham Tabernacle
[16:35] is missing out on more understanding of
[16:38] the message. They're missing out on more
[16:39] life because brother Brandham said,
[16:41] "These men will pick this message up and
[16:43] make more sense of it and make it come
[16:46] to life." So let's listen to that quote
[16:48] again. These men if they pick up this
[16:50] and go out with it they can make more
[16:52] sense to it. See to bring it to a place
[16:54] you would I just want to lay this seat.
[16:57] Hope they make it come to life. Notice
[17:00] okay the fourth and final question. Can
[17:02] we be the bride by only listening to the
[17:04] tapes and their answer is a most
[17:06] emphatically yes.
[17:09] And finally they use a scripture. They
[17:11] use Amos 3:7. Now remember, nothing to
[17:14] be revealed. God will do nothing at all
[17:16] until first he reveals it to his
[17:18] servants, the prophets. So they use a
[17:20] quote from brother Brandham who's
[17:21] quoting from Amos 3:7. Thus all we need
[17:25] has been spoken and is on the tapes. Or
[17:27] when his seventh angel returns to earth,
[17:29] he will tell us then. Oh, there's so
[17:32] much propaganda in here. And look,
[17:34] there's even a false imagination because
[17:36] they say, "Or when his seventh angel
[17:38] returns to earth." So Brandham
[17:39] tabernacle is open to a return ministry
[17:41] of brother Brennham. These people are
[17:44] off the word. It's so incredibly sad.
[17:47] They're open to brother Ram coming back
[17:50] and telling them more of what they need
[17:52] to hear. Again, this proves the Bible's
[17:54] not their absolute. Brother Ram said,
[17:56] "All that we have need of is in the
[17:58] Bible." Brother Ram said, "You can't add
[18:00] to the Bible nor take away from the
[18:02] Bible because that's what the Bible
[18:03] says." There is a textbook on
[18:05] psychology, one we all need. It is the
[18:08] Bible. It is written by God and contains
[18:11] God's psychology.
[18:13] We have every article of the Bible,
[18:16] vivid evidence right here now. All
[18:19] sufficient God to provide everything
[18:22] that we have need of. Now, someone said,
[18:25] "Well, that's seven seals and brother
[18:26] Brandham that'll be revealed in the last
[18:28] days. Some great mystery how we get
[18:30] closer to God." No, sir. It can't be.
[18:33] Whosoever shall take one word from this
[18:35] Bible or add one word to it, his part
[18:37] will be taken the book of life. What it
[18:39] is is a revelation on what has been
[18:41] missed back there to bring to it's
[18:43] already wrote here. It's in here. It's
[18:45] to reveal what already has been written.
[18:47] Amen. See, because you can't add one
[18:49] thing to it or take one word from it.
[18:52] So, did brother Brandham say we can be
[18:53] the bride by only listening to the
[18:55] tapes? The answer is no. Brother
[18:57] Brandham only supported listening to
[18:58] tapes when there was no preacher. That
[19:01] was in questions answers part three
[19:03] 1964.
[19:05] They asked brother Brandham, "We have no
[19:08] preacher where we live. Are the tape
[19:10] services sufficient?" Brother Ram said,
[19:12] "Well, let that be according to the way
[19:13] your children are going." So notice,
[19:16] Brother Ram only approved it when there
[19:17] was no preacher. Which of these people
[19:20] today following the Brandham tabernacle
[19:22] do not have a preacher that lives close
[19:23] to them? And remember, they'll be judged
[19:26] if they fail to go to hear living
[19:29] preachers. Just as the Queen of Sheba
[19:31] crossed the desert to hear the wisdom of
[19:33] Solomon, Jesus said, "She'll be used to
[19:35] judge those in Jerusalem and those who
[19:37] lived in the time of Jesus who would not
[19:40] go to hear Jesus preach and they live so
[19:43] close to Jesus." Whereas the Queen of
[19:45] Sheba made a great travel. She
[19:47] sacrificed a lot to travel great
[19:49] distance to hear the gift of God for her
[19:52] day. What will be the judgment on the
[19:54] people today who do not go to hear
[19:57] living preachers? only God knows. And
[19:59] then later, Brother Ram was asked, "If
[20:01] you don't have a church to go to, should
[20:03] you just listen to the tapes?" He said,
[20:05] "That'd be fine." So, let's listen to
[20:07] those two quotes. But then remember,
[20:08] there was quotes from the same series
[20:11] where Brother Bram said, "You go to
[20:13] church. If you can only get one slice of
[20:15] bread, go to that church to show which
[20:17] side you're on." Let's listen to the
[20:19] quotes. Brother Brandham, we got just 10
[20:21] minutes now. Brother Brandon, we have no
[20:23] preacher where we live, but we have tape
[20:27] service on Sunday night only. Should we
[20:31] take our children to another church for
[20:34] Sunday school? Are the tape services
[20:37] sufficient? Well, let that be according
[20:40] to where your children are going. See,
[20:42] now if you get your children, they're
[20:44] young, and you get them out into some
[20:46] kind of a group out there that'll just
[20:48] pound the stuff into them that they they
[20:51] shouldn't know. I wouldn't do it. If
[20:52] they if they seem to learn enough from
[20:54] the tapes and things and you say you put
[20:56] them over in a Catholic church, take
[20:58] them over to Catholic church, take them
[21:00] over to something like that. I wouldn't
[21:01] advise that thing. if they uh but now if
[21:04] you got a nice little church over there
[21:05] maybe disagree two or three things with
[21:06] you and your children want to go to
[21:07] Sunday school they're full gospel people
[21:09] or something well that's perfectly all
[21:10] right but see when you come to a place
[21:12] where depends on how your children take
[21:14] it see watch what your children does
[21:16] what how they react to it let's see if
[21:18] you don't have a church to go to should
[21:21] you just listen to the tapes yes that's
[21:24] I that'd be fine brother Brandham should
[21:27] we go to the other churches even when
[21:31] they disagree with you. Sure.
[21:35] Yep. Jesus did when they disagreed with
[21:37] him. Go ahead.
[21:41] Uh we notice Sharon said, "Uh, should we
[21:46] go to another church that disagrees with
[21:47] you?" Sure. I don't I'm not the only
[21:49] pebble on the beach, you know. There
[21:51] just other godly man everywhere. I hope
[21:53] I'm one of them. See, but don't never
[21:55] get down here. I was called in on
[21:57] something like this uh the other day uh
[21:59] a group in Arizona called my attention
[22:02] to that. See, a ministerial group said,
[22:04] "The only thing that we have against
[22:05] you, Brother Bram, is one of the things
[22:07] the people that come out here with you,
[22:09] we can't get them to go to church
[22:10] anywhere." Said, "They got children and
[22:11] everything. They won't go to church."
[22:13] And said, "Well, we told them they're
[22:15] welcome to come to our church. I know
[22:16] they put a pressure on you and want you
[22:17] to join, but you don't have to join, but
[22:19] put them kids in Sunday school
[22:21] somewhere.
[22:23] And you go to church. Don't sit at home
[22:25] go fishing, hunting, and things like
[22:26] that on Sunday." Amen. You say, "Well,
[22:28] I'm not a legalist." Well, you better be
[22:30] in that manner for a while, dishonoring
[22:32] the resurrection of Christ. So, we see
[22:34] friends, the Brandon Tabernacle pastor
[22:36] has no gift to rightly divide the word.
[22:39] Amos 3:7 is not about Paul's five-fold
[22:42] ministry. How can Amos 3:7 delete
[22:46] Ephesians 4 8-16? It cannot. Not one
[22:50] word of Paul can be changed according to
[22:52] brother Brandham. And yet, Brandham
[22:53] Tabernacle deletes Ephesians 4 and the
[22:56] verses about the five-fold ministry. And
[22:58] notice Brandom Tabernacle is only using
[23:00] one verse, Amos 3:7, to prove their
[23:03] point. But that breaks the principle of
[23:04] the word. The word says we need in the
[23:06] mouth of two or three witnesses to
[23:08] establish every word of truth. Amos 3:7
[23:12] says, "Surely the Lord God will do
[23:13] nothing, but he revealth his secret unto
[23:15] his servants, the prophets." Now, this
[23:18] verse is true. No doubt about it.
[23:20] Brother Ram was a true servant of God, a
[23:22] prophet. He revealed the secret of the
[23:24] seven seals. That's undeniable. There's
[23:27] over 38 differences between Brother
[23:29] Brandham's revelation on the seals
[23:31] versus Clarence Larkin, Uriah Smith,
[23:34] Charles TA Russell. I have videos that
[23:36] prove that. So, I'll leave links to that
[23:38] in the description by the grace of God.
[23:40] But, Brother M said he could never take
[23:42] one word away from the Bible nor add one
[23:44] word to the Bible. The Bible is the
[23:46] absolute. And the Bible never says we're
[23:49] in the perfect will of God by playing
[23:51] the tapes and neglecting the five-fold
[23:53] ministry. The Bible never says the bride
[23:55] only needs what is on the tapes. The
[23:58] Bible never says only listen to tapes
[24:00] and you won't miss out on anything. And
[24:02] the Bible never says you can be the
[24:04] bride by only listening to the tapes and
[24:06] neglecting the five-fold ministry. The
[24:08] Bible says the exact opposite in
[24:10] Ephesians 4 8-16.
[24:12] Verse 11 lists apostles, prophets,
[24:14] evangelists, pastors, teachers. Verse
[24:17] 12, for the perfecting of the saints,
[24:19] the work of the ministry, the edifying
[24:21] of the body of Christ. So tape players
[24:23] are missing the perfection of the
[24:25] saints. They're missing the work of the
[24:26] ministry. They don't have a real
[24:27] ministry and they're missing the
[24:29] edifying or building up of the body of
[24:31] Christ. Verse 13, we need the five-fold
[24:33] ministry till we all come in the unity
[24:35] of the faith and of the knowledge of the
[24:37] son of God unto a perfect man unto the
[24:39] measure of the stature of the fullness
[24:41] of Christ. So the tape worshippers will
[24:43] not be unified by the Holy Ghost with
[24:46] other believers. They'll miss out on the
[24:49] knowledge of God. They won't come unto a
[24:51] mature man. They won't come to the full
[24:54] measure of the stature of Christ that
[24:56] they should because they're neglecting
[24:58] the five-fold ministry. And as verse 14
[25:01] says, they will be tossed to and fro
[25:03] like children carried about with every
[25:04] wind of doctrine.
[25:07] And I have a video series of over 24
[25:09] false doctrines that prove Brandom
[25:11] Tabernacle is being carried and tossed
[25:13] by all these 24 false doctrines. and
[25:16] they're being deceived as Ephesians 4:14
[25:19] says. Let's finish the video by going
[25:21] over these verses here and show how they
[25:24] have nothing to do with tape playing.
[25:27] Matthew 4:8 says, "The devil taketh him
[25:29] up to an exceeding high mountain and
[25:31] showeth him all the kings of the world
[25:32] and the glory of them." This verse says
[25:35] nothing about tape playing. It's about
[25:36] Jesus's temptation.
[25:39] Matthew 11:25 and 26. This is Jesus
[25:42] praying, I thank thee, oh father,
[25:44] because thou has hid these things from
[25:46] the wise and prudent and revealed them
[25:47] unto babes. Even so, Father, for it
[25:50] seemed good in thy sight. This is Jesus
[25:52] thanking the Lord despite Capernium,
[25:55] Tyrie, Sidon, and Cherzan rejecting his
[25:59] ministry. This has nothing to do with
[26:01] pressing play on the tapes. Matthew
[26:03] 24:6,
[26:05] "And ye shall hear wars and rumors of
[26:07] wars. See that you be not troubled, for
[26:09] all these things must yet come to pass,
[26:10] but the end is not yet." That's speaking
[26:12] of the conditions of the end time. And
[26:15] again, there it doesn't say anything
[26:17] about pressing play on tapes. Mark 16:16
[26:21] is about believing and being baptized.
[26:24] He that believeth and is baptized shall
[26:25] be saved. He that believeth not shall be
[26:27] damned. There's nothing in Jesus's words
[26:29] about just pressing play and avoiding
[26:31] preachers. In fact, Romans 10 says, "You
[26:34] can't be saved except you hear a
[26:35] preacher, not a tape player." John 14:12
[26:40] is about Jesus doing greater works in
[26:42] the bride, and that means more works. No
[26:44] one could do a greater miracle than
[26:47] Jesus Christ. Verily, I say unto you, he
[26:50] that believeth on me, the works that I
[26:52] do shall he do also, and greater works
[26:53] than these shall he do, because I go to
[26:55] my father.
[26:57] So any believer will do works of the
[27:00] Holy Ghost. Thank God for healings,
[27:02] miracles, words of wisdom, words of
[27:04] knowledge. But again, this verse says
[27:06] nothing about being in the perfect will
[27:08] of God by pressing play. 2 Thessalonians
[27:11] 2:3. Let no man deceive you by any
[27:14] means, for that day shall not come
[27:16] except there come a falling away first,
[27:18] and that man of sin be revealed the son
[27:20] of predition. This verse is about the
[27:23] future Pope Antichrist.
[27:25] But notice the tape worshippers are
[27:27] being deceived by a man and numerous men
[27:30] in the Brandham tabernacle leadership
[27:33] that have fallen away from the five-fold
[27:35] ministry. It could not be any planer.
[27:37] The hundreds of thousands of people or
[27:39] maybe million or more that are
[27:41] influenced by Brenham tabernacle are
[27:43] being deceived. They're falling away
[27:45] from the Bible verses about the
[27:46] five-fold ministry. Hebrews 4:12 is
[27:49] about the power of the word. For the
[27:51] word of God is quick and powerful and
[27:53] sharper than any two-edged sword,
[27:55] piercing even to the dividing of sunder
[27:57] of soul and spirit and of the joints and
[27:59] marrow, and is a discerner of the
[28:00] thoughts and intents of the heart. The
[28:02] word of God always does this. It divides
[28:05] between the soul, spirit, and body. It
[28:08] discerns or judges the secrets and
[28:11] thoughts, intents of the heart. The word
[28:12] of God does this in the five-fold
[28:14] ministry. Of course, brother Brandham's
[28:16] gift of discernment did this very often,
[28:19] and we're thankful for that by the grace
[28:20] of God. But this verse never says to sit
[28:23] down, preachers, and just press play.
[28:26] Revelation 2:6 is about the deeds of the
[28:28] Nicicoatans.
[28:29] But this thou hast that thou hatest the
[28:31] deeds of the nickels, which I also hate.
[28:34] No doubt Jesus hates any man-made deeds.
[28:37] And that's what Brandham Tabernacle is
[28:38] doing. All their 24 false doctrines are
[28:41] man-made deeds. They say every word on
[28:44] tape is infallible. Every word on tape
[28:46] is thus sayith the Lord. The tape boys
[28:48] are the true five-fold ministry. The
[28:50] token is not the baptism of the Holy
[28:52] Ghost. To them, the token is the tapes.
[28:55] Such nonsense. Such awful deeds of the
[28:58] nickelotans.
[29:00] Revelation 6 3 and 4 is about the second
[29:02] seal. Again, nothing in here about being
[29:04] in the perfect will of God by playing
[29:06] tapes.
[29:08] Revelation 17 is about the mother
[29:10] harlot, the Roman Catholic Church.
[29:12] Revelation 19:11-16
[29:15] is about the battle of Armageddon
[29:18] where Jesus comes out of heaven riding a
[29:20] white horse. So this shows the Lord's
[29:22] day, Jesus coming at the battle of
[29:24] Armageddon. Joel 2:25
[29:27] speaks of God restoring and this is what
[29:30] God has done through the church ages as
[29:31] well. I will restore to the years that
[29:34] the locust hath eaten the cankerworm and
[29:36] the caterpillar and the palmer worm, my
[29:38] great army which I sent among you. No
[29:40] mention here of playing tapes. And in
[29:43] fact, Brandham Tabernacle should say
[29:45] God's restoring what the book of Acts
[29:47] did, which was support the five-fold
[29:50] ministry. It's sad. Brand Tabernacle
[29:52] can't see that. Brother Ram came to
[29:54] restore the apostolic faith. The
[29:56] apostolic faith was to receive the
[29:58] five-fold ministry, to grow by the
[30:00] five-fold ministry, be united through
[30:01] the five-fold ministry. But again, they
[30:04] can't see that because of their
[30:05] deception and their idolatry. And last
[30:07] but not least is Amos 3:6 and 7. We
[30:10] already talked about that. These verses
[30:12] speak of how God reveals his secret to
[30:15] his prophets. Prophets are likened under
[30:17] trumpets being blown. And God does
[30:20] nothing until we he reveals his secret
[30:22] unto the servants, the prophets.
[30:25] So, Brother Ram gave us the secrets of
[30:27] the seven seals. No doubt about that.
[30:29] So, we rejoice in God sending us a
[30:31] genuine prophet in this day. Let's close
[30:33] with a word of prayer for the tape
[30:34] worshippers. Dear God, I humbly pray,
[30:37] Lord God, that you'll help the tape
[30:38] worshippers to repent of their sins.
[30:40] God, repent of their idolatry, their
[30:41] false doctrine. And God, please, if it's
[30:44] just helping one, I just pray use this
[30:46] video and the videos of others, other
[30:48] preachers who are speaking the truth
[30:50] about the five-fold ministry, even if
[30:52] just one person can be saved out of
[30:54] this. I pray you grant it for the glory
[30:55] of God. Lord, our hearts are turned back
[30:58] to the apostolic fathers. Therefore, we
[31:00] must earnestly contend for the faith
[31:01] which was once given to the saints. And
[31:04] the faith given to the saints was the
[31:05] five-fold ministry preaching the word of
[31:08] God. Faith comes by hearing, hearing by
[31:10] the word of God. How shall they hear
[31:12] except they hear a preacher? So, Father,
[31:14] help the leadership to repent, Lord. If
[31:16] not, may the next generation repent,
[31:17] dear God. We ask for the people to be
[31:20] brought out of deception, into the
[31:22] truth, into the marvelous light of the
[31:24] Lord Jesus Christ. May the Bible become
[31:27] their absolute. Grant it, Lord. May they
[31:29] humble themselves and repent in tears,
[31:31] oh God. and may that get right with you.
[31:33] I pray Lord, I humbly ask this in the
[31:36] name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[31:40] If you have any questions, concerns or
[31:41] testimonies about this video, please
[31:42] contact me.
[31:45] God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[31:47] the desire of your heart.
[31:50] very happy to be here this afternoon and
[31:52] again in defense of the gospel of Jesus
[31:54] Christ to bring the good tidings, the
[31:58] good news that Jesus raised from the
[32:00] dead, living among man today, his
[32:02] church. The same Jesus that was
[32:04] yesterday will be today and forever
[32:08] is never failed.
