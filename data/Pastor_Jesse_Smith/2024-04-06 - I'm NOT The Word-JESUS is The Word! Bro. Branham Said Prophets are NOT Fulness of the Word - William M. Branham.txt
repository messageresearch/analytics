TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I love how brother brandham glorified Jesus Christ and said Jesus Christ is the fullness of the word brother brandham always separated the fullness of the word being Jesus Christ and all the Believers as just having a part of the word in their souls of course that's the seed of God according to 1 Peter 1:23 being born again not of corruptible seed but of Incorruptible by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever here's some quotes I'd like to emphasize the first is from the voice of the sign 1964 brother brandom says I'm not the word I'm a man notice all these brother brandom worshippers are saying brother bram's the word brother bram's the word but brother Bram said I'm not the word I'm not the word I'm a man but you see he uses this body because he died to sanctify this body that he might use it and give a gift just like pulling it out of gear then the Holy Spirit takes over next in the signs of his coming 1962 brother R said Jesus was the word and brother said we have to approach God through the word the word comes to the prophets they're not the word notice brother Bram said the prophets are not the word Christ is the word brother BR list Elijah Moses all the great prophets they wasn't the word then he says it again they wasn't the word but Jesus was the word now watch he was the word see not Jesus he just said this because he was the word but to us we have to approach God through the word see the the word comes to the prophets they're not the word in Old Testament Elijah Moses all those great prophets they wasn't the word they were the uh they were a perverted body with at the word of God came to the Bible said the word of God come to the prophets they wasn't the word but Jesus was the word hallelujah amen oh I just love that all right in the restoration of the Bride tree 196 2 brother random says we're not the word the word of the Lord came to the prophets they wasn't the word but the word come to them but Jesus was the word again brother Brandon magnifying Jesus Christ Jesus Christ is the fullness of the word now we are not the word the word of the Lord came to the prophets they wasn't the word but the word come to them but Jesus was the word next in Souls that are in prison now brother random said you're a part of God and I am a part of God see but I am not all of God and then brother am quotes the scriptures as Sons adopted by Jesus Christ just as the Bible says in Romans chapter 8 we have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry ABA father you're a part of God and I'm a part of God see but I'm not all of God neither are you all of God see see it's attributes of God upon us as Sons adopted by Jesus Christ which God himself become flesh to die for us lastly from his unfailing words of Promise 1964 brother randam said Jesus was not just a prophet he was God he said the prophets had their part of the word their part of the word the part that was given to them for that age but he Jesus was the fullness of the word he was the word itself how many knows that in the days of his visitation to his on Earth that he was God manifested in in a body called Jes Jesus that was God in a man that's right not just a prophet he was God and the prophets had their part of the word they are part of the word the part was given to them for that age but he was the fullness of the word how many knows that he was the word itself now there is a lotted portion of the word for today is that right that would be him again is that right so that him the same yesterday thank you Lord Jesus for sending us a bible-based prophet the late William brandham Hallelujah to the Lord Jesus Christ amen oh I just love him there's something in my heart just bubbling over how I love the Lord [Music] Jesus
