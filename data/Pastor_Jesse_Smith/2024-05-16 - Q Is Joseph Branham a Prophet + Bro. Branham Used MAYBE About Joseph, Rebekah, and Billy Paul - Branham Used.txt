TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] somehow I was inspired to say Joseph Thou Art God's prophet and maybe when I leave I pray that and maybe when I leave I pray that a double potion of the spirit will come upon Joseph greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to answer a viewer's question about Joseph brandham and so by God's help I'll try to do that in this video by the grace of our Lord hi friends my name is Jesse Smith I'm Pastor bride of Christ Fellowship here in akan Ohio USA for about the last 18 years or so and I defend the Gospel of Jesus Christ that he revealed to his true servant the late William brandham God's true prophet he lived 1909 to 1965 and also defend The Godly character of God's Prophet brother William brandom so after getting this question this week I thought I'd make a short video answering the viewer's question referencing my previous video addressing the question of is Joseph brandom a prophet and of course I don't believe he is so getting back to the viewer's question he said Shalom My Precious brother I hope this email finds you well I received several questions from my sister in the Lord she was asking me if Brother Joseph is a prophet so I said no however she showed me where brother brandham was saying Joseph thou art a prophet she even thinks Brother Joseph is a type of Joshua for our days therefore I need a Clarity with regard to that may you please find the attached document my precious brother end quote so this is a two-part question so I'll do my best by God's grace to briefly answer this the first question is Joseph brandham a prophet because of this quote from brother brandham so I'll play the quote from Brother brandham of course I'm familiar with it it's from thirsting for Life July 28th 57 brother Brandon said somehow I was inspired to say Joseph Thou Art God's prophet and maybe when I leave I pray a double portion of the spirit will come upon Joseph for the age to come if there is one let's listen to the quote in the dedication of the little boy at the altar somehow I was inspired to say Joseph Thou Art God's prophet and maybe when I leave I pray that a double potion of the spirit will come upon Joseph for the age to come if there is one so again friends I'm very familiar with this quote notice first brother BR said I was inspired to say Joseph Thou Art God's Prophet but again there's no thus sayith the Lord's statement remember friends brother Ram told us to be very careful how we listen to him he said if there's anything from the Lord it will speak it thus sayth the Lord so in this quote there is no thus sayith the Lord of course I'm taking that from he cares you care 1963 let's listen to the quote now see I always asked you to be careful what you're listening to see there's so much of it that it's just the human side but always if there is something that goes forth it will speak it it's thus sayeth the Lord even to Visions or anything and that's the reason I say that not that there is any uh any prophecy concerning it I have nothing on it from the Lord and be sure now if I say anything from the Lord like that to tell you it's always I'm speaking now but when he speaks I say it's not me it's thus sayeth the Lord and I can't say it until he tells me I could be altogether wrong in my thought about Martin Luther King I don't know I can't say that's just my opinion so that's the first point there's no thus sayith the Lord in this 1957 quote so we cannot make it thus sayith the Lord remember brother Ram said in the church age book he had divine inspiration that 1977 ought to terminate the world's systems and of course that did not happen he said so I repeat I sincerely believe and maintain as a private student of the word along with divine inspiration that 1977 ought to terminate the world systems and Usher in the Millennium and friends I have a whole subject on the 1977 topic so please watch that if you have questions about that I'll leave a link in the description brother Brandon was calculating dates regarding Abraham and also the church ages and how much time the church ages had compared to the time the Jews had with God's spirit or being grafted into the holy tree As Romans 11 talks about and brother random said both of those numbers equal 1977 but of course he did not say thus sayith the Lord so he was just trying to be a student of the word of God he was just trying to have an understanding of when the end time might be and notice again he said with divine inspiration so just like brother Ram said inspiration with Joseph without a prophet here with 1977 he says divine inspiration so it's clear brother bandam thought he simply just thought he was inspired by the Holy Spirit but it wasn't it was just his own human thought and the reason we know that is because brother Ram said if it's from God it will say thus sayith the Lord and this also brings out the idea that any believer myself or you or anyone we're trying to understand what is the mind of the Holy Spirit and sometimes we might think we're inspired of the Holy Spirit when we when we're not actually inspired of the Holy Spirit and of course God will forgive us if we think we're inspired of the right thing but we're not as long as we don't say thus sayith the Lord as long as we don't say something false in the name of the Lord this reminded me of the quote from Souls that are in prisoned now November 10th morning 1963 brother Ram said a sister had a dream that he was going to get shot getting out of his car going into a meeting he said the woman's dream said then the spirit said so he's speaking about the Holy Spirit then the holy spirit said not at this time but it'll come later uh-huh so brother brandom agreed with the sister's dream he said uh-huh God forbid that I compromise on anything so here's another example where brother Ram thought the Holy Spirit was telling him something so it's the same idea as him saying well I felt inspired to do this I felt inspired about 1977 I felt inspired about Joseph being a prophet and so we can rest assured brother brandham did not say thus sayith the Lord about Joseph he did not say thus sayith the Lord about 1977 and he did not say thus sayith the Lord about this sister's dream about him being shot and killed going into a meeting some sister just had a dream she sent it to me and said I seen him that church fixed the way go to kill me secretly sometime I'm getting out of my car going in be fired but said then the spirit said not at this time but it'll come later amen God forbid that I compromise on anything I know nothing but Jesus Christ and him crucified the next point is that brother brand said the word maybe if you look at that quote again brother Bram said Joseph thou are God's prophet and maybe when I leave so notice the emphasis brother says is maybe this isn't a thus sayith the lord it's a maybe and the reason that word maybe is so important as you probably know know is that brother Ram said the same thing about Billy Paul and Rebecca in 1951 brother Ram said maybe my little boy would be fully a prophet sent from God so notice again just like Joseph brother BR was hoping Joseph would be a prophet brother Bram hoped Billy Paul would be a prophet but of course neither one are prophets let's listen to the quote And then trying to keep myself from sin at that time as much as a new how I thought maybe God would let my children come in to the blessing the full blessing and maybe my little boy would fully be a prophet sent from God I pray to that and next this is in March 1957 brother randam thought Rebecca would take his place seeing visions but notice he used the word maybe again brother R was telling the story of the posum that got healed through his prayer to the Lord Jesus and he said the next morning early I went out and as I started out little Rebecca who I believe is going to maybe take my place someday she's seen her first Vision just recently so friends it's undeniable brother random used the word maybe with Billy Paul Rebecca and Joseph and so all three of them were not prophets brother Rand was just hoping they would see visions and have a Ministry like his but of course brother Ram did not support women preachers let's listen to this maybe quote about Rebecca all night long I couldn't get that POS off my mind the next morning early I went out and as I started out little Rebecca who I believe is going to maybe take my place someday she see her first Vision just recently one more thing I want to say about this first part of this question is my video on Joseph bradam shows he doesn't meet the Bible requirements for a prophet and on that video I show there six qualifications at least for a genuine profit brother Brandon meets all six requirements but Joseph brandham only meets three of them and one of them is questionable it seems like Joseph does live a holy life I don't know though but he fails the second requirement teaching the word of God in Purity I have videoos showing over 24 false doctrines coming out of Brenham Tabernacle which Joseph Brenham doesn't repent of so I'll leave a link to those videos and a playlist in the description by God's grace the third require having converts and fruits of his ministry it seems Joseph meets that if they're genuinely saved people I don't know I don't believe his converts can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and propagate and believe so many false doctrines and lies that's just my humble opinion though I'm not the judge only Jesus Christ can judge but Jesus said by their fruits they are known the fourth requirement is reveal Secrets according to Amos 3:7 Joseph brandham has not revealed any Bible Secrets only his father has done that especially with the revelation of the Seven Seals and of course the 12 New Testament Mysteries the fifth requirement is anointing for Supernatural Works uh Joseph may have fulfilled this there's people that have testimonies about him praying for the sick maybe even raising the dead so that's possible I don't know but I wasn't there and sixth and finally you have to foretell of the future in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ brother R has at least six prophecies that came to pass Joseph has none as far as I know I've sat down and talked with two of Joseph bram's childhood friends and neither have ever heard him say thus sayith the Lord with it coming to pass now on my video series about Joseph I show him using thus sayith the Lord once he said thus sayith the Lord their church was in the perfect will of God I humbly disagree there's no way their church can be in the perfect will of God and change the fivefold ministry and add so many false doctrines to Paul's gospel so I personally believe Joseph would be a false prophet if he's considered a prophet at all but he did use the name of the Lord in that quote so that's why I think he's a false prophet let's listen to that false prophecy I've returned from Arizona with the word of the Lord for us keep playing the tapes [Applause] prise name [Applause] Jesus prise the [Applause] Lord he man you are in my perfect will keep playing those tapes I'm Coming For You [Music] [Applause] hey we all want to be in his perfect will as sure as I'm sitting here when he spoke to me he said keep playing the tapes you're in my will I know this is it is thus sayith the Lord it [Applause] is [Applause] [Music] [Applause] amen now the second part of the question is Joseph brandham an anti-tip of Joshua of the Old Testament of course my answer is no of course Joshua from the Old Testament took God's people into the promised land it was the third work of Grace they had to leave Egypt they had to get through the Wilderness and then they had take the promised land I believe those three steps are justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost for the New Testament Joseph brandham does not take anybody as far as I know into the baptism of the Holy Ghost again because of all the false doctrines all the times they break Paul's gospel through their man-made Creeds and false doctrines so I personally do not see any similarities between Brother Joseph brandham and Joshua of the Old Testament as many of you might know brother Ram talked about how his ministry typed Joshua and the Believers following him typed Caleb he talked about that in spoken word Original Seed and also that same portion was put in the church age book chapter 5 perriam and church age brother Bram said now let us stand like Joshua and Caleb our promised land is coming in sight even as theirs now Joshua means Jehovah Savior and he represents the end time leader that will come to the church even as Paul came as the original leader Caleb represents those that stayed true with Joshua so clearly the holy spirit is telling us that brother bram's Ministry typed Joshua spiritually Joseph branham's Ministry does not fulfill Joshua's Ministry in type Joseph brandham cannot type Joshua because he leads people out of gathering more as we see that day approaching rather than Gathering more as we see that day approaching Joseph brandham leads people into worshiping tape saying every word on tape is thus sayith the Lord he says that you have to realize that brother every Brother Joseph believes everything that brother brandom says is the Lord amen am I believe everything BR says thus sayth the Lord of course there are so many more false doctrines there's at least 22 more false doctrines in closing friends I hope this video was helpful by God's grace I thought I'd revisit it here in 2024 that original video about is Joseph brandom a prophet is from 2020 so it's been over four years since I've answered this question so hope it was a help by the grace of our Lord friends remember brother Ram said the most important thing of our day is a preacher who can rightly divide the word of God and I'm not just talking about myself I'm talking about all the Holy Ghost filled preachers who are rightly dividing the word of God giving the true interpretation of the scripture by the holy ghost that Jesus Christ revealed to brother brandham and also understanding brother bram's quotes now to bring up this faith in Christ there's ministers that's the most important thing of the day is a good god-sent preacher I admire them and they're G gift is far beyond anything could be done in anything else is a preacher a man who knows how to rightly divide the word of God it's a sin it's heresy to say every word on tape is thus sayi the Lord Brother R said there's mixups on the tapes in questions and answers 1964 and he said those four beautiful words if there's any questions he said look in the Bible he said especially for ministers let's listen to those quotes the other day I got something mixed up I happened to hear it it's I caught it right there and it's on the tape and I I probably hear from it when I was talking about the seven trumpets I said it was seven trumpets I was referring to the Pentecostal Feast from the Pentecostal Feast until the seven uh until the um the trumpets there was seven sabbaths oh was a great teaching there I didn't touch the edge of it but if you happen to catch that on your tape remember look in the Bible you see it's seven months after that count off seven months January February March April May June July it' be July 7even months which represents the full seven Church ages so we're grateful to stand with God's true Prophet brother William brandham and of course we pray for his son Joseph brandham that he'll repent of all these false teachings coming out of brandham Tabernacle father God we ask in Jesus Christ's name you'll help our dear brother Joseph Lord to repent of these false teachings that are coming out of brandom Tabernacle Lord I pray he would humble himself to the word of God and accept the truth of Thy word dear Lord give an honest heart Lord God give him the isav of the holy spirit that he might see the word of God in its Purity he might recognize the truth on his 24 false teachings that are coming out of his church let his spiritual eyesight be enlightened by the grace of God that he'll repent of these 24 false doctrines and serve you with a pure heart father we know all things are possible to them that believe that's why we ask that's why we pray for our dear brothers and friends and false Doctrine I pray you deliver him help him in Jesus Christ's name amen if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
