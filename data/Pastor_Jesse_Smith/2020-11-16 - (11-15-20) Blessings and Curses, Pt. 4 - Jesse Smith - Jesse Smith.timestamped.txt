[0:03] [Music]
[0:17] i think the storm put out our wi-fi so i
[0:19] have to
[0:19] use a phone as a hot spot to do the live
[0:22] stream tonight so
[0:23] saints can hear the word god but just i
[0:25] like to bring things
[0:34] just the external battery
[0:38] power to the live stream did she turn on
[0:40] the live stream
[0:51] i just thought i'd share my answer
[0:54] because i was listening to other
[0:56] preachers this weekend um
[0:59] but some people think that uh
[1:03] you know with biden and harris
[1:06] they might win that they would be the
[1:08] fulfillment of brotherhood's vision
[1:11] about america so i just want to share a
[1:15] few things about that i just
[1:17] to make it short in summary i don't know
[1:20] if it is the fulfillment or not
[1:22] i'm not sure myself so
[1:26] um i've heard a couple preachers say it
[1:28] is but i i think
[1:30] that they're just presuming that's just
[1:32] my opinion
[1:33] there's a couple reasons for that the
[1:36] first one
[1:36] it's kind of out of order so if the
[1:39] order
[1:40] number five the fifth thing that
[1:41] happened was the advancement in
[1:43] technology with the roads and the
[1:45] driverless cars well that hasn't
[1:46] happened yet it's closer
[1:47] it's really close um tesla i just saw a
[1:51] few heart attacks
[1:52] uh the last few weeks they're really
[1:54] close
[1:56] they're closer than ever before yeah so
[1:59] i have a website
[2:00] and i was reading it uh from october
[2:04] they feel like they're closer than ever
[2:07] to get ready
[2:08] they have a couple of a couple companies
[2:11] against waymo
[2:12] waymo's the company used to be the
[2:13] google cars they are now active
[2:15] in arizona uh it's like a taxi service
[2:19] okay for driverless cars but arizona is
[2:21] good with
[2:22] at least some of the parks right that's
[2:24] right there's some parts that get snow
[2:26] right up and down
[2:27] i don't know about that i wouldn't do
[2:30] anything about that i've never
[2:31] been out so i don't know anything about
[2:33] it just what i've heard
[2:35] anyways uh they're looking to go to like
[2:37] uh after
[2:38] you know they're established in arizona
[2:39] they're looking to go with the
[2:40] driverless cars
[2:42] um to warmer places like florida texas
[2:45] and then i think san francisco i'm not
[2:48] mistaken so anyways they're not quite up
[2:50] on that and that was the fifth vision
[2:52] the sixth vision
[2:53] um was the election okay it's either
[2:57] it was either a brotherhood said it
[2:59] plainly the church age book but the ramp
[3:01] says i believe that the woman that rises
[3:03] in power is the roman catholic church
[3:05] he said but i knew it could also be a
[3:07] president or vice president
[3:10] he said but then the nation bowed to the
[3:12] woman
[3:13] so we have to think what woman would an
[3:16] entire nation
[3:17] bow to so
[3:20] um i think i think it's just presuming
[3:22] to say that that
[3:23] the fifth or the sixth vision is
[3:24] fulfilled i think that's presuming
[3:26] um because it may be possible too you
[3:29] know president trump could still win the
[3:31] election it's possible
[3:32] i think the chances are slimmer each day
[3:35] um but anyways i just want to share that
[3:38] with you that i told the brother that i
[3:40] wasn't sure
[3:40] i think it's i just don't think it's a
[3:42] wise thing to say it is because
[3:44] i was preaching in 2016 that it was
[3:46] going to be hillary clinton was going to
[3:47] be the fulfillment of that and i was
[3:48] wrong
[3:50] so i i don't want to i try to learn my
[3:52] lesson from that
[3:54] and not try to jump ahead uh
[3:57] about prophecy billing i'm sorry
[4:00] prophecy
[4:01] being fulfilled so i told the brother i
[4:03] said i don't know
[4:04] i i personally think it's the catholic
[4:06] church but it could be again it could be
[4:08] you know a catholic president joe biden
[4:10] and a woman vice president it could be
[4:12] that
[4:13] and then the catholic church working
[4:14] through them because i guess i didn't
[4:15] already met with the catholic pro with
[4:17] the pope i guess
[4:18] i didn't see that but someone said he
[4:19] did
[4:22] so all i know is that whoever the woman
[4:24] is the nation has to bow
[4:26] i don't know any other uh bowing that
[4:30] the nation will do other than that
[4:32] what brother ram talked about in the
[4:33] squeeze where the the
[4:35] the ecumenical move will get so much
[4:37] power that they will persecute the true
[4:39] bride
[4:40] they're trying to put v i don't know
[4:44] so i i just i just feel like that fifth
[4:47] one would actually be fulfilled first
[4:49] because all the other ones were right in
[4:50] order you know with communism fascists
[4:52] all
[4:52] the other ones were right in order so it
[4:54] seemed like the driverless cars had to
[4:57] be fulfilled
[4:57] the rams said i saw them driving on
[4:58] beautiful highways
[5:00] and they were playing games in the
[5:02] vehicle and everything so
[5:04] i just thought i'd update you on that i
[5:05] don't know for sure you're not going to
[5:07] see me jump to conclusions because i've
[5:08] already done that i don't want to do
[5:10] that again
[5:10] i want to jump to conclusions all right
[5:15] so i didn't update everybody on that
[5:18] okay
[5:19] all right so we'll stand here let's
[5:21] stand and we'll go back to
[5:23] scripture here
[5:29] so tonight i want to go back to
[5:33] uh 23.
[5:38] let's finish that thought number is 23
[6:05] all right that's uh numbers 23 23.
[6:11] so we see in this scripture church that
[6:13] no one can curse
[6:15] what god has blessed because it's god's
[6:18] work amen
[6:20] i'm here glad to be god's work cannot
[6:24] curse what god

[8:42] we'll see how we do i hate to just
[8:44] preach 40 minutes for karen we drove an
[8:46] hour 15 minutes to get here
[8:47] what's your grandmother's name again
[8:49] monica let's give monica around
[8:57] [Laughter]
[9:17] so i'd like to we'll finish this thought
[9:19] church with uh lord willing with um
[9:23] deuteronomy number is 23. he makes those
[9:26] up
[9:26] and then i want to get to this really
[9:28] good thought at the end
[9:30] um it's a it's a thought i never seen
[9:32] before so a couple weeks ago
[9:34] i was i was so excited i was telling my
[9:35] wife about this did you ever hear you
[9:36] ever read this in the bible
[9:38] it's a good thought about the promised
[9:40] land so i want to close with that
[9:42] but first let's uh finish up here
[9:44] numbers 23 23
[9:46] no devil or no
[9:50] witchcraft worker or curious arts worker
[9:54] can put any curse upon those god is
[9:57] blessed
[9:58] because we are in the hand of god being
[10:01] formed and shaped into the image of
[10:03] christ praise god
[10:05] uh god balak uh balaam said neither
[10:09] curse them right they cannot be cursed
[10:11] they can't be blessed i'm sorry they
[10:12] can't be cursed they can only be blessed
[10:14] and what does balak say baalik says i'm
[10:16] fine don't curse them or bless them
[10:18] that's impossible right you're either
[10:20] curse or you're blessed
[10:21] right and so a balak had a bad attitude
[10:24] and
[10:25] he had he was against god's people uh
[10:28] now i want to keep reading numbers 23 26
[10:30] but balaam answered and said unto balak
[10:32] told nah i thee saying all that the lord
[10:34] speaketh that must i do
[10:37] and balak said unto balaam verse 27 come
[10:40] i pray thee i will bring thee unto
[10:41] another place
[10:42] per adventure it will please god that
[10:44] thou mayest curse
[10:46] me them from fence isn't that is that
[10:48] interesting
[10:50] an unbeliever thinks well maybe the
[10:51] location determines if somebody's
[10:53] blessed or cursed
[10:55] i'll say this it doesn't determine the
[10:56] location physically it determines your
[10:58] spiritual location
[11:00] praise god because i'm i am dead and my
[11:03] life is hid in christ jesus praise god
[11:06] amen paul says we're dead of ourselves
[11:10] but our lives are in other words our
[11:12] location our place of habitation
[11:14] is in christ amen it's in the holy
[11:17] spirit praise god
[11:18] but this man balak thought well maybe if
[11:20] we change their
[11:22] uh maybe we change the physical location
[11:24] like we can curse them from a different
[11:26] angle
[11:27] there's no angle you can curse god's
[11:29] children and praise god
[11:30] now this morning i wanted to get to this
[11:32] uh and brother amen
[11:34] uh sang about it zechariah 9 9.
[11:37] i was looking at that idea of the shout
[11:39] of a king
[11:40] and remember they did shout for the king
[11:42] jesus when he came on uh
[11:43] the cult the foul of an ass right
[11:47] zechariah 9 9 rejoice greatly o daughter
[11:50] of zion
[11:50] shout o daughter of jerusalem behold
[11:53] thy king cometh unto thee he is just and
[11:57] having salvation
[11:58] lowly and riding upon an ass and upon a
[12:02] quote a
[12:02] foul of an ass so here we see the
[12:05] shouting
[12:06] at the coming of a king praise god and
[12:09] that's what uh
[12:10] balak and balaam saw they saw this shout
[12:13] of the king amongst israel because the
[12:16] king of heaven
[12:17] had come down to dwell with this people
[12:20] above the cherubims praise god
[12:22] and so the king was there in the camp
[12:24] praise god
[12:25] with the ark of the covenant and so they
[12:27] had a shout about
[12:28] them they had a joy about them they had
[12:30] a rejoicing about them because god's
[12:32] presence is here and that's how we feel
[12:34] tonight
[12:35] god's presence is here praise god and so
[12:37] it makes us shout and it makes us happy
[12:39] he makes us weep and cry it makes us
[12:42] praise the lord
[12:43] because the king is amongst his subjects
[12:45] praise god amen
[12:46] amen just like when he come down through
[12:48] here you know we know the story
[12:49] uh but matthew 21 14 says
[12:52] on his way church the blind and the lame
[12:55] came to the temple and he healed them
[12:56] before he jumped on that
[12:57] that cult he was healing the blind and
[13:00] the mane
[13:01] and then he gets on the cult and then he
[13:02] comes in the verse 15 matthew 21 15
[13:05] when the chief priests and scribes saw
[13:07] the wonderful things he did
[13:08] and the children crying in the temple
[13:10] like monica right
[13:12] crying in the temple and saying hosanna
[13:15] to the son of david
[13:16] they were sore displeased see true
[13:19] praise will always upset the enemy
[13:22] we see but when we really praise god
[13:24] satan gets upset
[13:25] but god pours out his blessings upon us
[13:28] amen so
[13:28] no matter no matter the time no matter
[13:30] the situation the trial
[13:32] we must always praise god because he
[13:34] inhabits his praises
[13:36] and satan will he'll get discouraged you
[13:38] resist him through the praises
[13:40] praise god praise god that's resisting
[13:42] satan and pretty soon satan will flee
[13:44] praise god amen
[13:45] amen look at that sore displeased at
[13:48] these children saying hosanna
[13:50] hosanna save us and be saying hosanna
[13:53] that's what i thought was so inspired
[13:54] all those songs buddy
[13:56] uh see it's it's the true worship that
[13:59] god loves
[14:02] because in verse 16 jesus said here's
[14:04] thou these i'm sorry they said
[14:06] here's not what they say is and jesus
[14:07] said yay yes
[14:09] have you never read of course they had
[14:11] read it
[14:12] and he's rebuking that i've read this
[14:14] before uh have you had never have you
[14:17] read
[14:17] out of the mouth of babes and sucklings
[14:19] thou asked perfected praise
[14:22] so jesus corrects them and rebukes him
[14:24] said you should have read this
[14:26] this is that this is that scripture this
[14:28] is that fulfilled
[14:29] this day scriptures prevailed praise god
[14:32] now perfected means to repair or to
[14:35] strengthen or to complete praise
[14:37] amen in other words when you have
[14:39] children when you have that
[14:41] that sincere childlike worship
[14:44] it's complete praise it is the very
[14:46] definition of praise
[14:48] like that little monika like she just
[14:50] gets caught up in the atmosphere and
[14:52] she's smiling and
[14:53] first time here right she wasn't looking
[14:55] at my suit was she brother
[14:57] was she checking out say oh that unholy
[14:58] roller he he should have shined his
[15:00] shoes
[15:02] that's that's the children have perfect
[15:04] praise
[15:05] they they feel the friends of god they
[15:07] hear the songs of zion and they just
[15:09] start praising the lord
[15:10] that's perfect that's complete that's
[15:12] how god wants us all to be
[15:13] praise god that's childlike praise
[15:18] save us save us that's what holds it i
[15:20] mean save us
[15:22] save us so that the shout of the king
[15:25] in the camp and whatever that king is
[15:27] there's always a shout to praise god
[15:29] now brother graham uh in the church age
[15:33] book goes through
[15:34] this story of balak and balaam
[15:39] he said uh balak told balaam to go down
[15:41] the valley and look
[15:42] upon their back parts to see if there
[15:45] wasn't
[15:45] possibility some way he could curse them
[15:49] now listen the tactics that balak used
[15:52] are the same tactics they use today
[15:55] the big denominations look down upon the
[15:57] small groups
[15:59] and anything they find amongst them to
[16:01] make out a scandal
[16:02] they bring it out and shout it
[16:06] if the moderns live in sin no one says
[16:08] anything about it but let one of the
[16:09] elect get into trouble and every paper
[16:11] blasted across the country haven't you
[16:13] seen that on
[16:14] the internet you know in social media
[16:16] you let a christian
[16:17] uh fall into sin like did you see this
[16:18] week one of those mega church pastors in
[16:20] new york
[16:21] he got caught in adultery so he resigned
[16:23] and it was all over and everybody's
[16:25] mocking up he probably deserves he
[16:27] probably deserves some of that
[16:28] punishment right because he knew better
[16:30] but it was all over it was all over
[16:32] all the stations all the social media
[16:34] pages and that's what brother man is
[16:36] saying here that's
[16:37] that's the modern day balak right they
[16:39] want to find
[16:40] something something connected to christ
[16:42] and and reproach it
[16:44] and they just want to look down and make
[16:46] it look evil
[16:48] he says yes israel had her carnal parts
[16:52] they had their side that wasn't
[16:53] praiseworthy
[16:55] but in spite of their imperfections by
[16:57] the purpose of god
[16:58] that works through election by grace
[17:02] and not by works can you say amen to
[17:04] that
[17:06] they had the cloud by day and the pillar
[17:09] of fire by night
[17:11] they had the smitten rock the brazen
[17:13] serpent and the signs and wonders
[17:15] they were vindicated not in themselves
[17:17] but of god
[17:19] that's what i like when we went through
[17:20] those testimonies this summer
[17:22] everybody had these powerful testimonies
[17:24] and what was it it was god
[17:26] vindicating your life praise god
[17:29] because we know brother branham was
[17:30] vindicated he has a picture with the
[17:32] pillar of fire none of us have that as
[17:34] far as i know
[17:35] but he had that vindication but see our
[17:38] association with that
[17:39] we want to say we're following that same
[17:41] message we're following that same pillar
[17:44] of fire
[17:44] but still god has to vindicate our lives
[17:47] and that's the beauty of our testimony
[17:48] we overcome by what god is doing in our
[17:51] lives
[17:52] amen so we can just say just like israel
[17:55] we're following a prophet
[17:56] who had the pillar of fire praise god
[17:58] but he hasn't stopped he's still moving
[18:00] today hallelujah
[18:02] he's still with us today he's
[18:03] vindicating god is vindicating his
[18:06] people he's been dedicating us
[18:07] as real christians hallelujah
[18:13] goes now in the night i'm going back to
[18:14] 1954.
[18:17] he said balak failed to see that
[18:19] spitting rock that brat serpent
[18:21] making atonement for israel that's the
[18:23] matter tonight the people look down and
[18:25] say
[18:25] pentecost did this pentecost did that
[18:28] and they're this way in that way
[18:29] they fail to see the rock jesus christ
[18:32] going before there
[18:34] in the power of the resurrection of the
[18:36] holy ghost
[18:37] he said it's still the covenant people
[18:40] amen i know they talk about you and say
[18:44] well this preacher run off with this
[18:45] man's wife
[18:46] but over in their ranks they did the
[18:47] same thing he said don't tell me i come
[18:50] out of it i know
[18:51] they just got a lot of prestige to
[18:52] smother it down and you have to stand
[18:54] and bear it that's right can i say it
[18:56] like this
[18:58] the believe the sign people which are
[19:00] probably watching so god bless them
[19:01] tonight
[19:02] he's already made a long video about me
[19:04] and criticized some things i said but
[19:06] that's fine you all can do that
[19:08] you got a right to do that uh but
[19:11] when they talk i'll just say this with
[19:13] love when they talk about the message
[19:14] they make everybody the message sound
[19:16] the same
[19:17] well they'll say well this message
[19:19] preacher did this they had a child abuse
[19:21] so that's what all message churches are
[19:22] like right
[19:24] and so isn't that what's happening here
[19:26] that's what balak
[19:27] balak uh thought well look at israel now
[19:30] this is after israel built the golden
[19:31] calf
[19:32] i mean that was pretty awful isn't that
[19:33] downstream of the most i mean you can
[19:35] get your name removed from the book of
[19:36] life from for idolatry
[19:39] right but that's what bailiff was doing
[19:40] he said look they did this
[19:42] uh they complained about the quail they
[19:44] complained about the
[19:45] the bitter waters they complained about
[19:47] all these things they made
[19:49] the idol these people deserve curses but
[19:52] god said i can't curse them because i've
[19:54] given them my covenant praise god
[19:56] they have the promise of abraham praise
[19:58] god amen
[20:00] and so brother says they do the same
[20:02] thing today so when one message person
[20:04] falls this group that's against us they
[20:06] make everybody out like that but let me
[20:08] say it
[20:08] we're not all like that some of us are
[20:11] really justified
[20:13] amen amen some of us are really
[20:15] sanctified praise god
[20:17] some of us are really filled with the
[20:18] holy spirit praise god
[20:20] and our lives are pure our lives are
[20:22] clean our lives are
[20:23] sweet smelling savor unto god amen amen
[20:27] but they like to focus all together
[20:29] when they see one person fall they want
[20:31] to group all the message churches into
[20:33] that
[20:33] my brother man says listen he said don't
[20:35] let it bother you
[20:36] you have to stand and bear it amen
[20:40] that's fine i'll stand with brother adam
[20:41] anyway praise god amen
[20:43] no matter what people say about the
[20:45] message we'll stand with brother ram lie
[20:46] because he stood for christ
[20:48] amen amen hallelujah he stood for christ
[20:53] lord i said if you've got the holy ghost
[20:55] you're god's child your abraham seed
[20:57] you got an unconditional covenant
[20:59] written in your heart
[21:00] by god almighty himself who can't take
[21:04] it back
[21:05] well why because it's written on your
[21:08] soul how do you understand that
[21:09] the bible said the law in the new
[21:12] testament would be
[21:13] written upon the heart praise god
[21:16] it's written so it's written there and
[21:18] it can't be removed
[21:19] god can't undo it because it's a seal a
[21:22] writing unto the day of redemption
[21:25] he said amen he swore he wouldn't do it
[21:28] hallelujah
[21:30] but ram said you don't deserve your
[21:32] healing tonight there's not a one of us
[21:34] in here that deserves to even hear the
[21:36] gospel
[21:37] there's not a one of you deserves the
[21:39] grace of jesus christ none of us
[21:40] we're all all together but by god's
[21:43] grace he did it anyhow
[21:45] there's none of you deserve your healing
[21:46] every one of you ought to die
[21:48] me too all of us
[21:51] we're not deserved to live on the earth
[21:53] that's right we're not deserving to look
[21:55] at god's creation
[21:56] but god has promised us and he cannot
[21:59] lie
[22:00] he swore that he would do it healing
[22:02] belongs to us then amen
[22:04] salvation belongs to us the holy ghost
[22:07] belongs to us
[22:08] he said heaven belongs to us
[22:14] [Music]
[22:21] [Music]
[22:25] hallelujah he said heaven belongs to us
[22:29] now we're the sons of god now we're
[22:31] sitting in heavenly places in christ
[22:32] jesus
[22:33] there's nothing can harm us because
[22:36] we're blessed
[22:38] amen thank the lord that is beautiful
[22:40] church
[22:41] i'm just quoting god's prophet
[22:47] he said now look balaam and baylor come
[22:49] down here and curse the people
[22:50] he said it was the fundamentalist trying
[22:52] to curse the holy rollers he said
[22:55] he said you mean to tell me that israel
[22:57] was holy holy rollers
[22:58] he said yes they was brother the same
[23:01] kind of spear was on them that day
[23:03] is on what they call holy rollers today
[23:07] it's coming right up you say can you
[23:09] prove that yes sir
[23:10] when they crossed through the river down
[23:12] there the red sea and got on the other
[23:14] side moses got so in the spirit
[23:16] till he sang in the spirit
[23:20] and miriam jerked up the tambourine and
[23:23] went down the banks and danced and beat
[23:25] the tambourine
[23:26] and the daughters of israel fouled her
[23:28] beating tambourines and dancing
[23:29] if that ain't an old time holy roller
[23:32] meeting i've never seen one
[23:34] that the same spirit is in the church
[23:36] today that they call holy rollers
[23:37] so i say that they was holy rollers to
[23:40] the world
[23:41] praise god well let me just do that the
[23:43] way i just try to
[23:45] wake myself up and let's let's say we
[23:47] have the victory we need to take the
[23:48] tambourine and we would
[23:49] run around the church and praise the
[23:51] lord and say hallelujah
[23:53] that we have the victory it's the holy
[23:56] rollers church
[23:57] it's the holy rollers they were they
[24:00] were not from the fundamental group
[24:02] they had the
[24:07] [Music]
[24:12] come on up here okay let's give a round
[24:21] of the
[24:28] [Music]
[24:31] you're lord help me
[24:48] [Music]
[24:59] [Music]
[25:07] this is what they had the other group
[25:10] didn't have it they were half
[25:11] message believers i don't want to be a
[25:14] half message believer
[25:15] i want to be sold out 100 percent
[25:18] message believer
[25:19] amen with the shout of the king
[25:24] in the camp the bible said you could see
[25:25] it and hear it
[25:27] oh so you mean it wasn't a a silent
[25:29] reverent
[25:30] quiet uh quiet holy ghost
[25:35] it was loud they had the shout and the
[25:37] game praise god
[25:38] they were happy they were set free
[25:41] praise god
[25:42] um that's my vocal chords i didn't want
[25:45] to do that for tomorrow but anyway
[25:47] see the shout of the king my man said
[25:49] they had to shout
[25:50] and it started back there at the red
[25:52] seashore that's where it started
[25:55] this shot of the king this this
[25:56] happiness this joy this victory
[25:58] it started there yeah they had a lot of
[26:00] times they fell short but god still
[26:02] looked at the blood sacrifice and said
[26:04] that's my people
[26:06] you can't curse them that's my that
[26:08] that's my people that's my
[26:10] precious treasure praise god oh my i
[26:13] love that i think that's beautiful
[26:15] all right so let me be done there uh
[26:17] with that thought
[26:19] now if you got your bibles let's go to
[26:21] the next thought
[26:23] uh with let's look at to self-inflicted
[26:26] curses
[26:26] i mentioned this this morning with
[26:28] jezebel uh let's look at it let's
[26:30] look at another one first go to genesis
[26:32] 27 verse 12.
[26:34] you got your bibles there well i wish i
[26:36] regret wearing the sweater because it's
[26:37] kind of hot after dancing around here
[26:41] i was going to regret that genesis 27
[26:43] 12.
[26:47] now we'll read 12 and 13. now look
[26:51] these uh these uh founding fathers of
[26:54] the faith will say
[26:56] they knew if you did wrong things curses
[26:59] were to follow
[27:00] right now church we would say like this
[27:03] i think we've grown up in america
[27:05] we may not call it a curse we just may
[27:06] call it like consequences right that's
[27:08] what these people would call in school
[27:10] oh if you break the rules you're gonna
[27:11] have consequences well that's kind of
[27:12] what curses are right
[27:14] if they're temporary they're just
[27:15] consequences to bad decisions
[27:20] okay so verse 20 uh i'm sorry chapter 27
[27:22] verse 12
[27:25] my father her adventure will feel me and
[27:27] i shall seem
[27:28] to him as a deceiver this is jacob and
[27:30] his mother rebecca
[27:32] and i shall bring a curse upon me and
[27:34] not a blessing
[27:35] and his mother rebecca said unto him
[27:37] upon me thy curse my son
[27:40] only obey my voice and go fetch me them
[27:44] now here rebecca is asking for a
[27:47] self-inflicted curse
[27:50] is that something she cared so much
[27:51] about jacob getting the blessing
[27:54] and she liked him better with favoritism
[27:57] she said let your let the curse be on me
[28:01] now as far as i found isaac never cursed
[28:03] anyone
[28:04] even after really realizing he was
[28:06] deceived but we know the story right we
[28:08] know
[28:09] jacob went off and uh married rachel and
[28:11] leah and remember he had uh layman do a
[28:14] lot of bad things to him
[28:15] so you invent eventually you oh you're
[28:17] you are going to reap what you sow right
[28:20] but in this case rebecca thought she was
[28:22] going to get a curse and didn't
[28:24] you see sometimes just because we think
[28:26] we might be cursed or just
[28:27] because someone might say a curse that
[28:29] doesn't mean it's going to happen
[28:32] okay next scripture
[28:36] now here's what i was mentioning this
[28:37] morning first kings 19 1-2 with ahab and
[28:39] jezebel
[28:42] first kings 19 1-2 that's why i ain't
[28:45] scared brother bang if somebody curses
[28:46] me
[28:47] i don't have a fear at all i know where
[28:50] god brought me from
[28:51] i was in the depths of hell and dead and
[28:53] sin brother
[28:54] john i've been washing the blood
[28:56] brothers
[29:02] i was in the depths of sin you know i
[29:04] know what it's like to be
[29:05] in the grave and god brought me out of
[29:07] that grave praise god
[29:09] i came running out of that great there's
[29:10] a song about that we need to sing that
[29:11] sometime
[29:13] i came running out of that grave praise
[29:14] god you can't curse when god is blessed
[29:18] first kings 19 1 and ahab told jezebel
[29:21] look at him going back he's licking his
[29:22] womb darling
[29:25] all that elijah had done honey look what
[29:27] elijah did to me
[29:28] look what the preacher did to my
[29:30] prophets look at him he's like a little
[29:31] baby
[29:32] and with all how he had slain all the
[29:34] prophets with the sword that's what he
[29:36] did with name off right
[29:38] remember she's like why are you so sad
[29:40] why are you sitting there like a
[29:41] like a baby you're just like oh david
[29:44] wouldn't sell me as a land she's like
[29:46] let me let me let me let me do something
[29:48] about that
[29:50] all right she got that masculine spear
[29:56] verse two then jezebel sent a messenger
[29:58] to elijah saying
[30:00] so let the gods do to me and more also
[30:03] if i not take thy life as the life of
[30:05] one of them
[30:06] by tomorrow about this time so she put
[30:09] herself
[30:09] under a curse by tomorrow this time if
[30:11] you're not dead let the gods kill me did
[30:13] she die that next day
[30:15] no she lived she outlived ahab
[30:18] so see even when sinners say curses it's
[30:21] not always going to take effect
[30:24] it's not always going to take event
[30:25] because a lot of people just say
[30:27] things right they don't even really
[30:29] they're just not really thinking what
[30:30] they're saying
[30:32] and did elijah get cursed he got
[30:35] raptured
[30:38] right now she tried to curse the man
[30:40] that's going to be raptured
[30:41] you can't curse but god is blessed amen
[30:44] and we're going to the rapture
[30:45] you can't curse us we're going up praise
[30:47] god we're getting the blessing
[30:57] oh think about that church and by god's
[31:00] grace we live to see it
[31:01] we'll escape all the curses of this
[31:03] earth the curse of the mark of the beast
[31:05] and god will take us up to glory amen
[31:08] hallelujah
[31:09] no matter what they try to curse us i'm
[31:11] gonna take your money i'm gonna lock
[31:13] down your bank account go ahead
[31:15] i've got heavenly treasures that you
[31:16] can't even know about i mean i'm
[31:18] trusting him but he promised me that
[31:20] praise god
[31:21] right what does that mean to me that's
[31:23] fine say whatever you want
[31:25] i know i'm a child of the king i am who
[31:27] i i am who god says i am praise god
[31:30] i know you i know i am i'm a child of
[31:32] god
[31:33] he's blessed me you see people can
[31:35] mutter anything they want
[31:37] let them mutter pray for them like jesus
[31:40] father forgive them
[31:45] proverbs 2 i'm sorry proverbs 18 21.
[31:47] this is up for mayor one
[31:49] but death and life are in the power of
[31:51] the tongue
[31:52] and they that love it shall eat the
[31:54] fruit of us you gotta love the life of
[31:56] god
[31:56] right we gotta love speaking god's word
[31:58] then you'll enjoy the blessings of it
[32:01] speak lives speak life speak speak the
[32:03] word speak the truth speak
[32:05] speak blessings praise god and then
[32:07] you'll see the benefits of it
[32:10] now also the opposite is true as well if
[32:12] you start talking hopelessness
[32:14] if you start talking to feet if you
[32:17] start talking there's nothing good for
[32:18] me
[32:19] then you're going to end up going that
[32:20] wrong direction you and i must
[32:22] physically and spiritually speak life
[32:26] right speak life
[32:29] speak this there's no weapon that's
[32:31] formed against me that shall prosper
[32:34] praise god i am more than a conqueror in
[32:36] christ jesus
[32:38] nothing can separate me from jesus's
[32:40] love
[32:43] bye what promises amen what a oh what a
[32:46] box of ammunition you got right here
[32:48] praise god hey
[32:49] what a sharp sword we have to weave at
[32:52] the enemy praise god
[32:54] and we'll enjoy the fruits of it if we
[32:56] can just speak it and believe it
[33:01] but ram said if we want a blessing
[33:06] he said be a blessing to someone else
[33:12] and a blessing will return
[33:16] he said like casting your breath first i
[33:18] feel so discouraged go do something nice
[33:26] it's going to return it will return to
[33:28] you
[33:29] that's the scripture cast your bread
[33:32] upon the water so bread is something it
[33:33] was daily sustenance right
[33:35] you had to have it to eat or to live
[33:37] rather you could eat anything else
[33:39] something it was a daily necessity cast
[33:41] your daily necessity your daily portion
[33:43] upon the waters in faith and it will
[33:46] return to you brother said to return
[33:48] buttered
[33:50] i don't know he said that's true in all
[33:53] walks of life you'll find that
[33:55] you usually reap just what you sow
[33:59] so let's do good talk good and be kind
[34:02] and people talk about us we'll say good
[34:05] things and kind things about them
[34:08] and good things will come our way if
[34:11] we'll give them out
[34:13] if there's that condition yeah
[34:16] like yesterday i was uh i was bragging
[34:19] on somebody who's
[34:20] really against me now i was bragging on
[34:21] them yesterday i said i baptized that
[34:23] person had such
[34:24] faith i baptized them in december in a
[34:28] late
[34:29] they had such faith now this person 18
[34:32] now i think and
[34:33] says all kinds of evil things against me
[34:34] says i love satan now
[34:36] but yesterday i had a chance to say
[34:38] something nice about him
[34:40] because that's going to return to me
[34:42] sometimes somebody's going to say
[34:43] something really nice about me
[34:46] he's a real brother he's a real
[34:47] christian that's what i wanted to say
[34:49] praise god
[34:50] i want people to look at my life and say
[34:51] look at the faith that he's he's got
[34:52] faith with nature
[34:53] he's got faith with uh praying for the
[34:55] sicker he's got
[34:57] faith with preaching the gospel or being
[34:59] a witness or something like that how
[35:00] many want people to say nice things
[35:02] about them
[35:03] absolutely so i had a chance yesterday
[35:06] should i
[35:06] should i say something good about this
[35:08] person that curses me
[35:10] i said what i said i've baptized people
[35:12] with great faith that ties out
[35:14] water in 20 degree weather just saying
[35:18] nice things about people
[35:20] because it's it's a law whatever you
[35:22] reap i'm sorry whatever you sow that's
[35:24] what you're going to reap
[35:26] and that's like blessings and curses
[35:30] thank the lord but man says
[35:35] he says if people say well i'm weak my
[35:37] faith not a very good christian
[35:39] that's just what the devil wants you to
[35:40] say you're just talking his language
[35:43] right then
[35:44] see satan's got a language doesn't he's
[35:46] got a dialect
[35:48] oh i'm weak i'm not very much i'm not a
[35:50] good christian
[35:52] he said you're just talking his language
[35:54] see you must never say that don't never
[35:56] let your testimony be negative
[35:57] let it be positive all the time i'm
[35:59] saying i have god in my heart i believe
[36:01] it with all my heart
[36:02] i believe in divine healing with all of
[36:04] my heart praise amen
[36:05] amen there's that law and that's a
[36:09] self-inflicted blessing or curse
[36:11] right because satan's trying to he's
[36:13] trying to make you doubt and say the
[36:14] negative well that would be a
[36:16] self-inflicted curse did you accept what
[36:18] he
[36:18] he's trying to whisper in your ear but
[36:21] instead you've got to take
[36:22] you got to do that i should say like
[36:24] it's the god-led blessing right the
[36:26] god-led blessed because god is leading
[36:27] you to say
[36:28] the right thing right
[36:31] now he says never permit a negative
[36:34] thought to come in your mind if you can
[36:36] help it
[36:36] when it starts don't entertain it well
[36:39] you say i can't help those thoughts from
[36:40] coming
[36:41] well that's like the farmer that said he
[36:42] can't stop the birds from flying over
[36:45] his place but he could sure stoop them
[36:47] or stop them from roosting
[36:48] that's a good thing you see you can't
[36:50] help the thoughts but don't entertain
[36:52] them just pass it on say no sir jesus
[36:55] christ is my savior
[36:56] all things are mined by god i'm going to
[36:58] keep them i'm going to testify of them
[37:01] amen the man calls it reaping and sowing
[37:05] your words reaping and sowing
[37:10] in 1955 brother ram said god can only
[37:12] bless you as you confess
[37:14] what he's done for you he's the high
[37:17] priest of our confession is that right
[37:19] hebrews chapter 5. he said that he's the
[37:22] high priest of our confession
[37:23] he can only do for us what as we accept
[37:26] it and believe it
[37:27] and confess it that's where bang helped
[37:30] me with that lying vanities he really
[37:31] helped me on that one
[37:33] i had to confess it it's a lie it's a
[37:35] lie it's a lie it's a lie
[37:38] and god eventually brought the healing
[37:40] so we
[37:41] we know god is he's a high priest of our
[37:44] confession we must confess the truth we
[37:46] must confess his promises
[37:48] if it's his will they'll follow through
[37:50] if it's his will praise god
[37:52] now here's another self-inflicted curse
[37:53] remember this one jesus was being
[37:55] crucified
[37:56] and pilate said i am innocent of the
[37:59] blood of this person
[38:00] see you do it and in matthew 27
[38:03] 25 then answered all the people and said
[38:06] his blood beat upon
[38:08] us and our children now that one was
[38:12] a real curse brother ben calls it the
[38:14] blood curse
[38:15] even all of history mel gibson that
[38:17] famously
[38:19] did the passion he recognized he got
[38:22] criticized because he called it the
[38:23] blood curse
[38:24] because he put it in the passion movie
[38:25] that was way back way back
[38:27] maybe 2006 or something i mean it's a
[38:30] self-inflicted curse
[38:32] they let they say let his blood be upon
[38:34] us and god has had to
[38:35] honor that because they wanted it on
[38:38] them
[38:38] and of course the holocaust they lost
[38:39] six million they've lost millions more
[38:41] because this blood curse self-inflicted
[38:44] curse
[38:46] now here's another one i don't know what
[38:47] happened afterwards because the bible
[38:49] doesn't
[38:49] say acts 23 14 remember that the bible
[38:53] said they came to the chief priests and
[38:54] elders and said we have bound ourselves
[38:56] under a great curse
[38:58] that we will eat nothing until we have
[39:00] slain paul
[39:01] now did they slay paul no so whatever
[39:04] curse they were under either they gave
[39:05] up on it and it wasn't inspired
[39:07] or they actually died from it i don't
[39:09] know what it was
[39:11] but see this is an example they try to
[39:13] use curses
[39:14] that you can't curse but god is blessed
[39:17] amen praise god paul was blessed
[39:20] he had a different testimony than to be
[39:22] slain by these men he had to go to rome
[39:24] and give his life as a testimony for
[39:26] christ there
[39:28] see another example just people can they
[39:29] can shout out whatever they want
[39:31] right that doesn't mean it's going to
[39:32] happen okay
[39:34] let's look at a few more then i'm going
[39:37] to bring it down to
[39:38] that i told you the close the scripture
[39:40] um
[39:42] okay authority figures sometimes
[39:45] did temporary curses in the bible so
[39:47] let's look at a few of those
[39:49] sometimes fathers uh curse children in
[39:53] the bible
[39:54] sometimes spiritual leaders uh
[39:57] cursed people but it only counts when
[40:00] it's prophetic
[40:02] or allowed for god's glory or as a form
[40:05] of punishment because no one can curse
[40:07] what god has blessed
[40:08] so here's the first one uh genesis nine
[40:12] oh twenty-four who said i were just
[40:13] talking about this this morning oh i
[40:14] forgot about that that was in my notes
[40:16] genesis 9 24 and noah awoke from his
[40:19] wide and knew what his younger son had
[40:20] done unto him
[40:22] he said cursed be canaan a servant of
[40:24] servants shall be
[40:25] shall he be unto his brethren and he
[40:27] said blessed
[40:28] be the lord god of shem and canaan shall
[40:31] be his servant
[40:33] now from the story it looks like ham
[40:35] walks into his father's tent
[40:37] after he got drunk showing he was the
[40:38] foolish virgin not like enoch who was
[40:41] raptured before
[40:42] and the bible said he was uncovered so
[40:44] mo so noah was
[40:46] uncovered his nakedness was bare right
[40:48] and so i don't know what ham did once he
[40:50] was in there but he went and told the
[40:51] brothers about it
[40:53] and then noah came to himself later and
[40:56] heard about it
[40:57] and then he curses it's interesting he
[40:58] doesn't curse ham
[41:00] he curses his son canaan he basically
[41:03] curses his grandson so i'm not sure why
[41:07] sometimes i think uh you know remember
[41:10] god is merciful remember god sometimes
[41:11] is merciful like with ahab
[41:13] god uh god god had the biggest curses on
[41:18] ahab's children and not on him
[41:21] okay they have to die a very awful death
[41:23] but that's what it looks like here it
[41:24] looks
[41:25] like noah was led by god not to curse
[41:29] ham but it went to his son canaan and
[41:32] again that have to be by four knowledge
[41:34] you say how could god curse the grandson
[41:36] well by god's poor now she can do it
[41:38] he must have known that canaan would
[41:39] have been just an ordinary
[41:41] unbelieving person that's that's the
[41:43] only way i could make sense to it right
[41:47] so see that ham and i'm sorry canaan was
[41:50] cursed to be servants
[41:51] but christians are blessed not to be
[41:54] servants to sin
[41:55] we're to be servants to righteousness
[41:57] praise god amen
[41:58] because he was cursed to be disturbed
[42:01] but we're
[42:02] blessed to be god's children praise god
[42:04] his servants
[42:05] amen go to genesis 27 22.
[42:09] we got somebody back there he's real
[42:12] good too where is
[42:19] that's what i'm saying genesis 27 22
[42:22] they're all good
[42:22] i'm not good all right and jacob went
[42:25] here on to isaac's father and fell him
[42:27] and said the voice is jacob's voice
[42:29] but the hands are the hands of esau
[42:32] and he discerned him not because his
[42:34] hands were hairy
[42:35] as his brother esau's hand so he blessed
[42:37] him now notice church
[42:39] he was deceived how many know isaac was
[42:41] deceived isaac thought he was blessing
[42:44] esau
[42:45] right he thought it was esau he honestly
[42:47] thought so he blesses him
[42:50] and does it go to esau no it goes to
[42:54] jacob
[42:55] right because jake because
[42:58] isaac was blessing jacob by god's
[43:01] leadership
[43:03] praise god god inspired isaac to say
[43:07] those words it wasn't isaac's thought
[43:09] it was god's thought praise god see that
[43:14] so even in someone's deception even in
[43:16] them not even
[43:17] understanding what they're doing they
[43:18] can be so filled with god's spirit to
[43:20] cause a blessing to come on somebody
[43:22] because it's really god's blessing and
[43:24] not the man's blessing
[43:26] praise god like church when i when i
[43:28] dedicated zion i could have said i'm
[43:30] going to bless you
[43:31] with 500 acres of land right i could
[43:34] have just from my
[43:36] my own mind right like my dedicated they
[43:38] owe me invest these children
[43:40] i can just thought from my own mind and
[43:42] try to do these blessings but that does
[43:44] it's not going to happen
[43:45] if it's a man's idea or man's blessing
[43:47] or a man's curse
[43:48] it's not going to happen it has to be
[43:50] led by the holy spirit praise god
[43:53] and so isaac he's totally to see what
[43:55] he's doing but it doesn't matter
[43:57] because god sees that jacob really wants
[43:59] the blessing
[44:00] jacob really wants the birth right you
[44:03] know esau is going to turn
[44:04] wayward and marry a heathen and uh the
[44:07] bible said he's a fornicator too
[44:09] i think he had two wives i'm not
[44:11] mistaken three
[44:13] olympia has been reading up there three
[44:15] wives
[44:16] the bible said he was a fornicator and
[44:18] he turned from the truth
[44:20] so see again it goes back to god's
[44:21] foreknowledge so god can bless you even
[44:24] when people don't even know what's going
[44:25] on
[44:26] praise god because god is the one who
[44:29] inspires it
[44:34] see blessings and curses must be in
[44:36] prophetic
[44:37] or inspired of god remember god's with
[44:40] the curse on the serpent god put the
[44:41] curse on me
[44:44] just like jezebel's attempted curse upon
[44:46] elijah wasn't of god
[44:48] didn't happen good good and curse what
[44:50] god is blessed
[44:51] here's another one now this one church
[44:54] actually came to pass
[44:56] uh genesis 31 32
[44:59] so god was upset how many remember god
[45:01] was upset with rachel
[45:04] she stole her father's gods and she hit
[45:07] him you know in her
[45:09] uh her private area
[45:12] uh genesis 31 31-32 with
[45:15] jacob says this he's like why did you
[45:17] overtake me you searched everything and
[45:19] didn't find it
[45:20] and jacob said with whomsoever thou
[45:21] findest thy goods let him not live
[45:24] before our brethren discern that what is
[45:26] in thine
[45:28] i said what is thine with me and take it
[45:30] for jacob knew not the rachel's soul
[45:32] look at this again just like with isaac
[45:34] isaac didn't know who he was blessing in
[45:36] church look at this
[45:37] jacob didn't even know who he was
[45:38] cursing
[45:40] see it's all led by the spirit of god
[45:42] and the church said
[45:45] if god ever leads you to say something
[45:47] in his name
[45:48] it's going to happen whether it's a
[45:49] curse or whether it's a blessing
[45:51] jacob is cursing his own life but it's
[45:53] not really him it's god
[45:56] god is going to take this woman off the
[45:58] scene right after she has benjamin
[46:01] god takes a mother you know it was her
[46:06] it was her second son right joseph was
[46:07] the first one benjamin was the second
[46:09] one
[46:09] she has the baby and she dies because
[46:12] she was cursed for taking those idols
[46:16] and what a lesson that is right what
[46:18] unless that is for any bride right
[46:20] any woman don't take an idol into your
[46:23] bosom right
[46:24] don't take a high down to your life
[46:26] that's why john says
[46:28] my dearly beloved flee from idolatry
[46:31] he said my little children he said love
[46:33] one another
[46:34] he said don't take idols don't don't
[46:36] worship
[46:38] because this is a saved woman rachel is
[46:39] disabled the bible said she was going to
[46:42] build the house she built the house of
[46:43] israel
[46:45] like leah leah rachel they built build
[46:47] that all those
[46:48] they built the house of israel but yet
[46:51] she had a temporary curse
[46:53] because she took those gods and those
[46:56] idols
[46:57] so this is an example of a spiritual a
[47:00] husband figure
[47:01] cursing his wife but it wasn't by his
[47:04] leadership right it was god
[47:06] it was god because in genesis 35
[47:11] um she dies verse 8 35-18 that came to
[47:15] pass as her soul was in departing
[47:17] where she died that she called his name
[47:20] benoni but his father called him
[47:22] benjamin and rachel died and was buried
[47:24] in the way
[47:25] wrath which is death
[47:28] so that's a serious thing there see
[47:31] jacob wasn't even aware what his wife
[47:33] had done but the holy spirit picked it
[47:35] up
[47:35] the holy spirit wasn't pleased with that
[47:36] woman taking those idols
[47:39] right so god took her off the scene
[47:41] right after benjamin was born
[47:45] that's what i was saying church uh
[47:47] authority figures sometimes
[47:49] uh speak temporary curses for blessings
[47:54] that was my 40 minutes so let me go to a
[47:56] couple more thoughts
[48:01] go to genesis 49 5-7
[48:06] genesis 49 5-7
[48:13] i'm not mistaken i believe this is jacob
[48:15] as well jacob
[48:17] is blessing his sons
[48:20] i want you to notice here notice he's
[48:23] not cursing his sons
[48:25] he's cursing their anger it's a really
[48:28] important thing to notice there
[48:29] he's not cursing simeon and levi he's
[48:32] cursing
[48:33] their anger look at verse 5 49 verse 5.
[48:36] simeon levi or brethren
[48:38] instruments of cruelty are in their
[48:39] habitations
[48:43] oh my soul will come not bow into their
[48:45] secret unto their assembly mine honor
[48:47] be not thou united or in their anger
[48:50] they slew a man and in their self will
[48:51] they dig down a wall
[48:53] cursed be their anger for it was fierce
[48:56] and their wrath for it was cruel i will
[48:58] divide them in jacob
[48:59] and scatter them in israel so here's a
[49:02] temporary curse right
[49:04] temporary he's got a scatter number and
[49:06] he curses their anger
[49:08] curse would be that anger
[49:12] let's see were there tribes punished
[49:15] absolutely
[49:16] there are consequences to decisions that
[49:19] we make
[49:20] the sons and the tribes were punished
[49:24] but later they must have got saved
[49:26] praise god
[49:27] because the sons reign on 12 thrones in
[49:31] heaven
[49:32] go to revelation 4 10. the gram tells us
[49:35] this
[49:35] revelation 4 10.
[49:39] so these are these brothers really
[49:41] battled anger anybody ever been there
[49:42] before
[49:44] anybody ever have a temper before yeah
[49:50] these these men battled anger so much
[49:53] that their father
[49:54] cursed it by the spirit of god the curse
[49:56] of the spirit of god curses that anger
[49:58] they're they're fighters warriors
[50:00] they're they're cruel men
[50:03] and jacob curses that evil attitude that
[50:06] they have
[50:07] somewhere along the road god forgive god
[50:09] forgives them they repent of their sins
[50:11] and they're forgiven because the four
[50:13] and 20 elders fall down before him that
[50:15] sat on the throne
[50:16] and worship him that liveth forever and
[50:18] ever and cast their crowns before the
[50:21] throne
[50:21] they worship jesus program said see he
[50:26] said
[50:28] he says they were white robe the 20 and
[50:31] four elders
[50:32] there will be 20 and four elders there
[50:34] will be 12 of them
[50:36] for the 12 tribes of israel the 12
[50:39] apostles for the church and they sat in
[50:42] the courts of the great king praise god
[50:45] amen man men that were so cruel and so
[50:49] angry
[50:49] god had to curse their anger in order
[50:52] that they might be
[50:53] chastened so they would repent and then
[50:56] here in heaven they rule
[50:57] and they sit in the court of heaven
[50:59] praise god ah
[51:00] that's a sort of redemption i want to be
[51:02] a part of praise god
[51:04] because there's parts about me church i
[51:05] don't like very much you hung around me
[51:07] hanging around me long enough you're
[51:08] gonna find some things i'm not perfect
[51:10] my children can tell you but please
[51:11] don't
[51:12] my wife can tell you i've got thoughts
[51:14] of myself i make mistakes
[51:15] but i'm trusting in the same grace that
[51:17] raised those boys up that brought them
[51:19] out of their
[51:20] human weaknesses and exalted them to
[51:22] heaven will be the same grace that
[51:24] exalts us
[51:25] to the right hand of christ as the bride
[51:27] of jesus christ amen
[51:29] amen glory they got to sit in the courts
[51:32] of the great king praise god because god
[51:36] had to chasten them and punish them
[51:38] and deal with their cruel hearts
[51:41] they're so angry and bitter violent god
[51:44] had to deal with their violence
[51:46] and burn it out of them through
[51:47] sanctification they couldn't get the
[51:49] holy ghost so
[51:50] god had to sanctify them and sanctify
[51:53] those
[51:53] bad habits out of them by his grace
[51:58] but then said remember they're sitting
[52:00] out there these are
[52:02] here's the bride in christ sitting on
[52:03] his throne his wife sat by the church
[52:07] he said there's the 24 elders and
[52:09] there's the 144 000 eunuchs of the
[52:12] temple
[52:12] ministering to him
[52:16] thank you jesus bye i don't know i don't
[52:19] know about you church but that's amazing
[52:20] grace to me
[52:24] cursed be their fierce anger
[52:27] fears who do you know that has fierce
[52:29] anger i can tell you a couple people
[52:31] i know they got fierce anger right i
[52:33] don't know a couple people that really
[52:34] got a lot of fears lust too
[52:37] you got a lot of fierce pride i know
[52:38] some of you guys got some real fear i
[52:40] know this people have real fierce
[52:41] bitterness
[52:42] but see our god specializes in redeeming
[52:46] his sons and daughters he specializes in
[52:49] that
[52:50] he's the only one that can do it praise
[52:51] god but if they're willing he will
[52:53] redeem them
[52:55] praise god he may allow them temporary
[52:57] curses brother amen for maybe
[52:59] years and decades and decades but his
[53:02] his ways are perfect praise god he's the
[53:04] potter they're the clay
[53:06] the potter knows how to fashion the
[53:07] claim praise god
[53:09] amen he knows how to break it down and
[53:11] build it up praise god
[53:13] that's what god did for cindy and levi
[53:15] let's go to this
[53:16] get your bibles let's go to uh ii kings
[53:19] 17
[53:20] this is glorious church this is glorious
[53:25] i think it is i hope it's a blessing to
[53:27] you you know i've read the bible i think
[53:29] this is my third or
[53:30] fourth or fifth time i can't remember
[53:32] i'm almost done reading the bible a full
[53:34] way through
[53:35] it's the one i just gotta do i highlight
[53:37] it so i know when i got up all the way
[53:38] through
[53:40] second kings 17 verse 7.
[53:45] i appreciate everybody's patience thank
[53:46] you for your patience
[53:48] tonight i hope you're being blessed by
[53:50] the word of god
[53:55] in second king 17 it's this just amazing
[53:58] story it's just laid right in the middle
[54:00] of the chapter here
[54:01] i should say the middle to the end
[54:05] so we all know israel was taken out of
[54:06] the promised land right because we read
[54:08] it because of the curses god
[54:10] exiled them god deported them god
[54:12] allowed them to be carried away captive
[54:14] out of the land
[54:15] because of all the curses they allowed
[54:16] in their lives notice i said the curses
[54:19] they allowed
[54:20] right they wanted the curses they
[54:22] enjoyed sin
[54:24] for a season they remember church
[54:27] remember how many years they were in the
[54:28] promised land about 1500.
[54:30] look we've only been in this land about
[54:31] 200 30 or 40 years i think america is
[54:34] 240 years old
[54:36] so i'm like what's up with 1776 minus
[54:39] 1776 minus 2
[54:42] i did it a couple of weeks really let me
[54:46] do that subtraction
[54:47] real quick just for my sake because i i
[54:49] know i did it last time
[54:51] what's 2020 minus 1776.
[54:55] oh 244.
[54:58] i know i thought it was 243. i was
[55:00] sitting right around there somewhere
[55:03] so think about that now look at that
[55:05] 1500 years and finally after the 1500
[55:07] years
[55:08] finally they get kicked out of lane
[55:10] that's amazing grace
[55:12] that's amazing grace and they only had a
[55:14] few good kings in there like
[55:15] didn't have that many good kings josiah
[55:18] hezekiah you know
[55:20] david solomon asa was a good king
[55:24] we've only been here 244 years on this
[55:26] land
[55:29] but notice if you go to verse 7.
[55:36] for it was so that the children of
[55:37] israel had sinned against the lord their
[55:38] god which had brought them out of their
[55:40] land of egypt
[55:41] from under the hand of pharaoh king of
[55:42] egypt and appeared under god
[55:44] and walked in the statues of the heathen
[55:46] whom the lord cast out from before the
[55:48] children of israel
[55:49] and of the kings of israel which they
[55:50] had made and the children of israel did
[55:52] secretly now look here that's what i
[55:53] want to bring out here
[55:55] why did god kick them out because they
[55:57] did they were secretly sinning
[56:00] verse 9 and the children of israel did
[56:02] secretly those things that
[56:03] were not right against the lord their
[56:06] god
[56:07] and they built them high places in all
[56:10] their cities
[56:11] from the tower of the watchmen to the
[56:13] fed cities
[56:15] and they set up them images and groves
[56:17] in every high hill and
[56:18] under every green tree and there they
[56:22] burn incense in all the high places as
[56:24] did they even
[56:25] whom the lord carried away from before
[56:27] them and rock wicked things to provoke
[56:28] the lord to anger
[56:30] for they served idols and the lord and
[56:32] said to them he shall not do this thing
[56:33] yet the lord testified against israel
[56:35] look at this
[56:36] how did god testify against them and
[56:38] against judah by
[56:39] all the prophets right when god wants to
[56:43] warn somebody what's he going to do
[56:45] send him a preacher praise god amen
[56:48] when god's going to warn his people
[56:50] about the curses and the blessings
[56:51] what's he do
[56:52] send him a holy ghost bill preacher
[56:54] praise god
[56:55] let him click on that servant about
[56:57] blessings and curses amen
[56:59] online how does god mourn his people
[57:03] through the prophets and by all the
[57:06] seers saying turn in
[57:07] how do they warn them turn from your
[57:09] wickedness repent
[57:11] leave those curses turn from your evil
[57:15] ways and keep my commandments and
[57:16] statutes
[57:17] according to all the law which i
[57:18] commanded your fathers which i sent to
[57:20] you by my servants
[57:21] the prophets notwithstanding what they
[57:23] do they would not hear they harden their
[57:25] necks
[57:26] see church that's why let me say like
[57:29] this
[57:29] i've had people come in our church and
[57:31] they say i like how you cry at the end
[57:33] of the service
[57:36] and you know why they said that he said
[57:38] the one brother said he said because
[57:40] it's helping me to let down my guard he
[57:42] said i'm so
[57:43] hard-hearted i can't even cry for jesus
[57:45] i can't even be happy enough to cry for
[57:47] jesus
[57:48] he said i love how you cry at the end of
[57:50] service it's helping me to overcome
[57:53] my hard heart that was back to the other
[57:57] church
[57:59] and so i've always remember that and
[58:00] i've always said this and said god
[58:02] always let me have a soft sensitive
[58:03] heart to the holy spirit
[58:06] that people here see what they're saying
[58:08] stop being so hard-hearted
[58:10] he said turn from your sin see it's sin
[58:12] that makes people not want to worship
[58:13] god
[58:14] it's hard hearts how come people don't
[58:17] want to be happy as a christian
[58:18] and more the holy spirit learn more
[58:20] about god and serve god it's because
[58:22] they got hard hearts
[58:23] they turned from the right way and they
[58:26] gone
[58:28] the wrong way but when you have a soft
[58:31] heart towards god
[58:32] you can be taught god you can learn
[58:36] more about god and it changes your life
[58:39] it doesn't just make you smarter you're
[58:41] like a computer
[58:44] no it makes you love god more it impacts
[58:47] your daily life
[58:52] how does how the prophets turn people
[58:54] away or how the prophets
[58:56] warn them they say turn away from your
[58:57] evil ways keep my commandments and my
[59:00] statutes
[59:00] according to all the law which i
[59:02] commanded by your fathers which i said
[59:04] to you by my servants
[59:07] i always want to have a soft heart
[59:09] toward the holy spirit
[59:11] i always want to love worshiping him and
[59:13] praising i don't want a hard
[59:15] attitude towards god
[59:23] in verse 23 he warns them again until
[59:26] the lord removed
[59:26] israel out of the site as he had said by
[59:28] all his servants the prophets
[59:30] so was israel carried away out of their
[59:31] own land to assyria
[59:33] unto this day see he was warned by all
[59:36] his
[59:36] servants he kept saying preacher
[59:39] after preaching i hope god just does
[59:41] that but for us
[59:42] we'll receive it praise god those keep
[59:44] sending us preacher uh brother randy
[59:46] right brother
[59:47] nathaniel brother cam brother desperate
[59:49] bride you'll get upset us creature
[59:51] and not rebuke us but strengthen us
[59:53] praise god
[59:57] encourage us to walk in obedience walk
[59:59] in the blessings of god
[1:00:01] diligently hearken to the word of god
[1:00:08] now here's the here's the part i want to
[1:00:10] get to verse 24
[1:00:12] and the king of assyria brought men from
[1:00:14] babylon and from
[1:00:15] kuthath and from ava and from hameth and
[1:00:18] from
[1:00:19] sethurbane and placed them in the cities
[1:00:22] of samara instead of the children of
[1:00:23] israel and they possessed the samaria
[1:00:25] and dwelt in the cities thereof and so
[1:00:28] it was at the beginning of their
[1:00:29] dwellings there that they feared not the
[1:00:31] lord therefore the lord sent
[1:00:33] lions among them which slew some of them
[1:00:36] now catch this all of god's people
[1:00:38] brother amen except the very poorest
[1:00:40] israelites
[1:00:41] everybody else was carried away or slain
[1:00:43] and so the assyrian king's like hey i'll
[1:00:45] send in my babylonian god
[1:00:46] i'll send my i'll send my catholic
[1:00:48] church members in there
[1:00:51] i'll send my denominations in there and
[1:00:54] what happens they go in god's holy land
[1:00:56] and lions are eating them up because
[1:00:58] they don't fear god
[1:01:00] imagine that lion's chasing you down
[1:01:02] because you don't fear god
[1:01:04] they're probably calling on witches they
[1:01:06] were probably uh sacrificing their
[1:01:07] children all these things
[1:01:11] and so they say
[1:01:15] so they go to the king and say we don't
[1:01:17] know that in verse 26 we don't know
[1:01:19] the manner of the god of this land
[1:01:21] therefore he sent lions among them
[1:01:24] yeah so they go back to the king and
[1:01:26] said who is this god in this place
[1:01:28] he's sending lions to kill us verse 27
[1:01:32] then the king of azir commands saying
[1:01:33] carry the other one of the priests whom
[1:01:35] now
[1:01:36] whom he brought from them to let him go
[1:01:38] and dwell there and let him teach them
[1:01:39] the manner
[1:01:40] of the god of the land
[1:01:45] now i want to because of time's sake go
[1:01:47] to verse 32.
[1:01:49] so he sends a jewish priest back to the
[1:01:52] land to teach these heathens
[1:01:54] how to fear god look at verse 32
[1:01:59] and so they feared the lord and
[1:02:02] look at this and made unto themselves
[1:02:06] of the lowest of them priests of the
[1:02:08] high places which sacrifice for them
[1:02:11] in the houses of the high places
[1:02:15] look at verse 33 they fear the lord
[1:02:18] and serve their own gods
[1:02:22] after the manner of the nations whom
[1:02:24] they carried away
[1:02:25] from deaths now what am i trying to say
[1:02:28] i'm trying to say this these people had
[1:02:31] a partial
[1:02:32] fear of god but not a whole fear of god
[1:02:36] but look what a partial fear of god did
[1:02:38] brother amen instead of getting slain by
[1:02:40] lions
[1:02:41] they feared god enough say well we won't
[1:02:43] do witchcraft and we won't kill our kids
[1:02:44] anymore
[1:02:46] so we'll fear god this far but we'll
[1:02:48] still practice
[1:02:49] idolatry on the side and you know what
[1:02:52] the scripture was brother of values i
[1:02:53] drove to church today
[1:02:54] i was thinking about this the scripture
[1:02:56] that came to me where paul said
[1:02:58] they will keep to themselves teachers
[1:03:00] having itching ears
[1:03:02] look the babylon or the assyrian god
[1:03:05] sends a teacher
[1:03:06] so they hear what they want to hear so
[1:03:09] they can escape
[1:03:10] the curses of god but then also enjoy
[1:03:13] the lust of the world
[1:03:14] doesn't that sound like the judas church
[1:03:19] have a form of godliness and deny the
[1:03:22] power thereof
[1:03:24] you can in your in your free time church
[1:03:26] i go to verse 41
[1:03:27] in your free time read through there the
[1:03:29] lions stopped coming
[1:03:31] because they have a partial fear of god
[1:03:33] and i think
[1:03:34] brothers and sisters ever honest that's
[1:03:36] what's happened in a lot of messed
[1:03:37] circles
[1:03:38] they have enough fear of god not to do
[1:03:41] their big evil sins they won't murder
[1:03:43] they won't cuss they won't cut their
[1:03:44] hair they won't cross-dress
[1:03:47] but yet they enjoy sinful habits on the
[1:03:49] side
[1:03:51] and they think that they've avoided
[1:03:54] god's curses
[1:03:55] but if it's the same situation as this
[1:03:57] they're still assyrians
[1:03:59] they're not jews and so it is today
[1:04:02] just because people fear god enough to
[1:04:03] read their bible and not commit evil
[1:04:05] sins that doesn't mean their holy ghost
[1:04:06] feels saints
[1:04:08] it just means they have enough truth to
[1:04:11] fear god
[1:04:12] but on the side they want to continue
[1:04:14] living in sin
[1:04:16] look at verse 41 so these nations fear
[1:04:19] the lord
[1:04:20] and look at that can you believe that i
[1:04:23] was shocked i read that i didn't i
[1:04:24] highlighted that my bible with my
[1:04:26] highlighter and purple marker
[1:04:27] that's how shocking it was i hadn't
[1:04:29] thought about this before
[1:04:31] people and brother brahm said it you can
[1:04:32] have a partial hunger
[1:04:34] he said you've got a partial hunger for
[1:04:35] the holy ghost but not a full hunger
[1:04:39] see the brotherhood said you could have
[1:04:41] just enough religion
[1:04:43] he said to make you miserable
[1:04:46] they just enough religion so they uh
[1:04:49] they were miserable
[1:04:50] they couldn't do the things they wanted
[1:04:51] but then they could still enjoy a little
[1:04:53] pleasurable sins they want to kill their
[1:04:54] children or
[1:04:55] you know go to witchcraft and tarot
[1:04:57] cards but i
[1:04:58] still want to enjoy my netflix i still
[1:05:01] enjoy my cigarettes
[1:05:02] i still enjoy my pornography i still
[1:05:04] enjoy uh
[1:05:05] chasing after millions of dollars
[1:05:12] i hope that's powerful to you as it was
[1:05:15] to me
[1:05:16] i'm going to say tonight lord help me to
[1:05:18] have a full fear of the lord
[1:05:20] church it's scriptural you can have a
[1:05:22] partial hunger for god
[1:05:25] and you won't see curses in your life
[1:05:26] you won't see lions and you won't see
[1:05:28] your house being broke down honestly
[1:05:30] i don't want a partial fear of god i
[1:05:33] want a total fear of god
[1:05:36] i don't want to live with amen by some
[1:05:37] of the words that come out of the crowd
[1:05:39] of god
[1:05:40] how many will live by every word that
