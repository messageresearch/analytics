[0:19] the yard I told her she'd reminded me
[0:22] and I told her about it I said honey

[0:26] critical of people I don't want to be
[0:28] who whose job is it it's not my the gods
[0:30] want to criticize not me there's a woman
[0:33] went over there I miss Dow I don't know
[0:34] where they ever heard of or not oh such
[0:36] a disgrace it was in India that's the
[0:38] reason we couldn't even have her
[0:39] meetings in the open air she got over
[0:41] there and tried to take offerings from
[0:42] them people and and and because they
[0:45] wouldn't give their little rupees a poor
[0:46] little woman has got a job packing Marty
[0:48] on top of her head up steps and things
[0:50] like that from 5:00 to 10:00 gets a
[0:52] rupee a day at 21 cents thing she has to
[0:54] work hard to keep that job a woman weigh
[0:57] in mud to their knees and so forth poor
[0:59] little old thing take care of her little
[1:01] babies and so forth a rupee 21 cents and
[1:05] they're fussing with them people and
[1:06] taking those rupes and turn them back
[1:08] into America money and they said you

[1:14] see you people they didn't have to give
[1:16] me a penny to go over come back pay my
[1:18] expenses pay all the auditorium rents
[1:20] all the hotel bills everything and then
[1:22] everything I had left I tuck it on the
[1:23] street not to give it some Society I
[1:25] took it out and give it to the poor
[1:26] little people that starving to death
[1:28] that's where your money that's where
[1:30] money best of my knowledge I could do it
[1:33] myself I only wish I'd had more to do it
[1:37] with now but my my my brother
[1:42] sister this woman started taking up
[1:44] offerings and fussing at him they said
[1:45] you come to take what we got not to help

[2:11] time he gets there said my meanings is
[2:13] greater than he ever had anyhow well
[2:16] that's true might beeny I don't know but
[2:18] the thing she had it under control to a
[2:20] place you couldn't even have a meeting
[2:21] in the open air that's what it was and
[2:23] they they started her out and she stood
[2:25] there and said you black Devils you said
[2:28] I like that and they try to get her get
[2:29] out and she wouldn't do it and somebody
[2:31] hit her on her head with a brick and

[3:00] him and honest hearted people I look
[3:02] around see these other things as goes on
[3:04] and in that I I start criticizing in my
[3:06] heart see and I don't want to get that
[3:08] way if I do that I'll lose favor with

[3:13] Americans and see the way look at women
[3:15] how they dress and look at man how they
[3:17] act and how they drink and cuss and
[3:20] smoke and chew and claim to be
[3:22] Christians till they just notates me

[3:51] and a grind tell Miss human my mental
[3:54] powers are breaking like that you see
[3:55] and I've got to get away for some rest
