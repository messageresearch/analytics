[0:03] But he sets some in the church,
[0:05] teachers, apostles, prophets, gifts of
[0:08] healing, working of miracles, and all
[0:10] those things are set in the church. Do
[0:13] you believe that? Amen. I never need to
[0:15] stay worthy to be set out of the church.
[0:17] He set them in the church for the
[0:19] perfecting of the church. And to be in
[0:22] the church until he comes again. And to
[0:25] be in the church until he comes again.
[0:30] Greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:32] of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of
[0:34] this video is to show how the Bible and
[0:36] God's prophet brother William Maron
[0:39] Brandham teach that preachers are to
[0:41] keep preaching until Jesus returns.
[0:44] We're so thankful that we have the word
[0:46] of God, the Bible, the holy scriptures,
[0:49] which is our absolute. And then God in
[0:51] his mercy in the 20th century sent a
[0:54] genuine Bible-based prophet William Mary
[0:56] Brandham who pointed us back to the word
[0:58] of God restored the faith of the
[1:00] apostolic fathers according to Malachi
[1:03] 4:es 5 and 6 Matthew 17:11 Acts 3 20 and
[1:08] 21. It's been 60 years since God took
[1:11] brother Random home. And as we wait for
[1:13] the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ, we
[1:15] want to remain faithful to what the
[1:16] Bible teaches and what God's prophet
[1:18] pointed us to, the Holy Scriptures. This
[1:21] video will also go along with recent
[1:23] videos about the false doctrines coming
[1:25] out of Brandom Tabernacle. One of their
[1:28] main false doctrines is that everyone
[1:30] should stop preaching and just press
[1:32] play and obey. That's a false doctrine.
[1:35] That's heresy. And so, the truth of
[1:37] God's Bible will be declared in this
[1:39] video by God's grace.
[1:42] Let's start with a brief Bible
[1:43] foundation of how preachers are going to
[1:45] remain until Jesus comes. The first
[1:48] verse is the great commission. Matthew
[1:50] 28:19-20.
[1:52] Go ye therefore and teach all nations,
[1:54] baptizing them in the name of the father
[1:56] and of the son and of the holy ghost. We
[1:59] know there is one name to the father,
[2:00] one name to the son, and one name to the
[2:02] holy ghost. And that's the name above
[2:04] all names according to Philippians
[2:06] chapter 2. That's the name of the Lord
[2:08] Jesus Christ. 10 days later after Jesus
[2:11] said this, Jesus filled Peter with the
[2:13] Holy Ghost. As John the Baptist said,
[2:15] Jesus would baptize believers with the
[2:17] Holy Ghost. And then Peter in Acts 2:38
[2:21] told new believers to repent, be
[2:23] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:26] But verse 20, teaching them to observe
[2:28] all things whatsoever I have commanded
[2:30] you, and lo, I am with you always, even
[2:32] unto the end of the world. Amen. So
[2:36] Jesus says, "You're going to go,
[2:37] therefore, teach all nations." Teaching
[2:40] is one form of preaching. We know
[2:41] there's five preaching gifts. And notice
[2:43] they're going to teach until the end of
[2:46] the world. Jesus will be with us, all
[2:48] the believers, and all the apostles and
[2:50] preachers, pastors, evangelists,
[2:53] teachers, until the end of the world. 1
[2:56] Corinthians 1:18 says, "For the
[2:58] preaching of the cross is to them that
[3:00] perish foolishness, but unto us which
[3:02] are saved, it is the power of God." And
[3:04] then down in verse 21, for after that in
[3:07] the wisdom of God, the world by wisdom
[3:09] knew not God. It pleased God by the
[3:11] foolishness of preaching to save them
[3:14] that believe. So 1 Corinthians 1:18 and
[3:17] 21 support the great commission. God
[3:20] chooses preaching to save believers and
[3:23] all nations must hear the preaching by
[3:25] living men and then the end will come.
[3:28] As Jesus said in Matthew 24, Jesus said
[3:31] in Matthew 24:14, "In this gospel of the
[3:34] kingdom shall be preached in all the
[3:36] world for witness unto all nations, and
[3:38] then shall the end come." And of course,
[3:41] this means living preachers, not dead
[3:43] preachers. Dead preachers cannot preach.
[3:45] They've already entered into their
[3:47] eternal reward. This is speaking of
[3:49] living preachers. Romans 10:14 and 15
[3:52] say, "How can they call on him in whom
[3:54] they have not believed? How shall they
[3:56] believe in him of whom they have not
[3:58] heard? How shall they hear without a
[4:00] preacher? And how shall they preach
[4:02] except they be sent? How beautiful are
[4:04] the feet of them that preach the gospel
[4:06] of peace and bring glad tidings of good
[4:08] things. Ephesians 4 8-16 is an entire
[4:12] passage on the five-fold ministry. But
[4:15] verses 11, 12, and 13 show how preachers
[4:18] will preach until we all come in the
[4:20] unity of the faith, which means the
[4:21] coming of the Lord. And he gave some
[4:24] apostles, some prophets, some
[4:25] evangelists, some pastors and teachers,
[4:27] for the perfecting of the saints, for
[4:29] the work of the ministry, for the
[4:31] edifying of the body of Christ, till we
[4:33] all come in the unity of the faith and
[4:35] of the knowledge of the son of God unto
[4:37] a perfect man, unto the measure of the
[4:38] stature of the fullness of Christ.
[4:42] Paul also told Timothy in 2 Timothy 4:2,
[4:45] "Preach the word, be instant, in season,
[4:47] out of season, reprove, rebuke, exhort
[4:50] with all longsuffering and doctrine."
[4:52] So Paul as a prophet ordained preachers
[4:54] after him just like God's prophet
[4:56] brother Brandham ordained preachers
[4:58] after him. Paul didn't say sit down and
[5:02] just read my letters the whole time. No.
[5:05] Paul told Timothy you preach the word.
[5:07] Paul also said in Colossians 1:28 whom
[5:10] we preach speaking of Christ in you the
[5:12] hope of glory the baptism of the Holy
[5:14] Ghost. We preach Christ, warning every
[5:16] man and teaching every man in all wisdom
[5:18] that we may present every man perfect or
[5:21] mature in Christ Jesus. So the maturity
[5:25] of the believer comes through the
[5:27] preaching, the hearing of the word,
[5:29] taking heed to warnings. Every person
[5:32] must receive the teaching, the wisdom of
[5:34] God, and that brings maturity.
[5:37] Notice God manifests his word through
[5:39] preaching, not through pressing play,
[5:41] but through preaching. Titus 1:3, "But
[5:44] hath in due times manifested his word
[5:46] through preaching, which is committed
[5:48] unto me according to the commandment of
[5:50] God our savior." So there's a very
[5:53] simple and short Bible foundation of how
[5:56] preachers are to preach until Jesus
[5:58] returns. He said, "Lo, I'm with you
[6:00] until the end of the world. This gospel
[6:02] must be preached to every nation. Then
[6:04] the end shall come." I'd also like to
[6:07] play a quote from Brother Ram's book,
[6:09] The Exposition of the Seven Church Ages
[6:11] in chapter 7. Brother Random said,
[6:13] "Christendom has become a labyrinth." He
[6:16] said, "What can help?" He said, "Only
[6:18] the one thing is needful." He's quoting
[6:20] Luke 10:42 where Mary came and sat and
[6:24] listened to Jesus preaching. Brother Ram
[6:26] said, "Return to Christ, looking to
[6:28] Christ as the only leader." Notice, not
[6:30] Joseph Brandham, not even brother
[6:32] Brandham. Christ is the only leader and
[6:36] walking in his footsteps, setting aside
[6:38] all other ways until we all reach the
[6:40] goal. and have come to the unity of the
[6:43] faith. So, brother Ram quotes Ephesians
[6:46] 4:13 till we all come in the unity of
[6:48] the faith. That's about the five-fold
[6:50] ministry. So, the one thing is needful.
[6:53] Come and hear the word of God being
[6:55] manifest through living holy ghostfilled
[6:57] preachers. That's how we come to the
[6:59] unity of the faith. As the heavenly
[7:01] master built everything on the ground of
[7:03] scriptures, so should we leave all
[7:05] peculiarities of our special confessions
[7:07] and be satisfied with the revealed word
[7:09] of God which belongs to us all. With the
[7:12] Bible in our hand, brother Ram says we
[7:14] should cry, I believe what God has
[7:16] revealed in this book. I will obediently
[7:18] keep his commands. I hope for that which
[7:20] he has promised. Christians give ear.
[7:23] This is a beautiful section brother
[7:25] Random wrote by the grace of God. And
[7:27] notice with our Bible in our hand, the
[7:29] Bibles are absolute. God's commands are
[7:31] to preach until Jesus returns, not press
[7:34] play, sit down, and neglect your
[7:37] preaching gifts. God promised that
[7:40] preachers would preach and then the end
[7:42] would come. Now, I'd like to show six
[7:44] quotes from God's prophet, Brother
[7:46] Brandham, where he says, "Preachers must
[7:48] preach until Jesus returns." And again,
[7:51] Brother Ram never changed this. Brother
[7:53] Ram kept the same message because it was
[7:54] a Bible-based message. And I'll go in
[7:57] chronological order here. By the grace
[7:58] of God. The first quote is from March
[8:01] 1954, the resurrection of Jerus. Brother
[8:05] Random quotes Ephesians 4:11, speaking
[8:07] of the five-fold ministry. I never did
[8:10] say where they'd be set out of the
[8:11] church. So, brother So, notice Brother
[8:13] Ram said the gifts would never be set
[8:15] out of the church. Yet, Brandham
[8:17] Tabernacle, the current leadership, is
[8:19] setting the preaching gifts out of the
[8:20] church. But brother Ram said, "I never
[8:23] did say that." He set them in the
[8:25] church. So Jesus set those preaching
[8:27] gifts in the church for the perfecting
[8:29] of the church and to be in the church
[8:31] until he comes again. Beautiful quote,
[8:33] brother Ram, supporting the Bible
[8:35] teaching on the five-fold ministry.
[8:38] Let's listen to the quote. It's the same
[8:40] Lord. See, but he sets some in the
[8:43] church. Teachers, apostles, prophets,
[8:47] gifts of healing, working of miracles,
[8:49] and all those things are set in the
[8:51] church. You believe that? Amen. I never
[8:54] he say where they be set out of the
[8:56] church, he set them in the church for
[8:59] the perfecting of the church and to be
[9:02] in the church until he comes again.
[9:06] Second, from July 1954, God's provided
[9:09] way of healing. Brother Ram said
[9:11] preachers are doing their part to
[9:12] encourage people's faith. Preachers
[9:14] can't heal. He said but we have a part
[9:17] in doing it. That's preaching the
[9:18] gospel. That's one part in doing it.
[9:21] Brother Ram said these signs and wonders
[9:22] and everything. So everything is
[9:24] speaking of the five-fold ministry. The
[9:26] preaching is gifts and everything in the
[9:28] church to stimulate the church to keep
[9:30] the church together for every attribute
[9:32] of Jesus life until he returns again in
[9:36] glory. So notice preachers doing their
[9:38] part until he returns again in glory.
[9:40] Let's listen to the quote. Now these
[9:42] meetings and people gathering that's
[9:44] what it's for is to encourage faith to
[9:46] bring faith up. We couldn't heal
[9:49] certainly not but we have a part in
[9:51] doing it. That's preaching the gospel.
[9:53] That's one part in doing it. Another
[9:55] part would be speaking with tongues.
[9:57] That's part if it's by revelation. And a
[10:00] gift of prophecy. That's another uh
[10:03] thing. Then uh signs and wonders and
[10:06] everything is gifts and everything in
[10:08] the church to stimulate the church to
[10:10] keep the church together for every
[10:12] attribute of Jesus life until he returns
[10:15] again in glory. Amen. Amen. Amen. Again
[10:19] in July 54, God providing healing for
[10:22] this generation. Brother Ram said, "And
[10:25] he Jesus commissioned human beings to go
[10:28] to all the world and preach the gospel
[10:30] and demonstrate the power of the Holy
[10:32] Ghost until he returns as a sign." Of
[10:36] course, brother Ram quoting Matthew
[10:37] 28:19 and 20, the great commission,
[10:40] human beings. So, not just Brother
[10:42] Random. It's not just press, play, and
[10:44] obey. It's human beings preaching until
[10:46] he returns. It's a sign of Jesus's great
[10:50] commission being fulfilled. Let's listen
[10:52] to the quote. And he commissioned human
[10:55] beings to go to all the world and preach
[10:59] the gospel and demonstrate the power of
[11:02] the Holy Ghost until he returned as a
[11:05] sign. Yeah, it's God's provided
[11:09] sacrifice. Tonight is the person of the
[11:13] Lord Jesus in the person of the Holy
[11:16] Spirit here tonight proving himself to
[11:19] be Jehovah Gyra, the Lord's provided
[11:23] sacrifice for your healing tonight.
[11:27] Third, again in July 54, God providing
[11:29] healing for this generation. Brother Ram
[11:31] again quotes the great commission. Go
[11:34] into all the world and preach the gospel
[11:35] to every creature. How far? To all the
[11:38] world. And when this gospel is gone to
[11:40] all the world, then I will return.
[11:43] Brother Random again supports preachers
[11:45] preaching. And then the preaching going
[11:47] to every nation, then the end comes.
[11:49] Preachers will preach all the way to the
[11:52] end. Let's listen to the quote. He's our
[11:55] kinsman redeemer. Amen. God made flesh
[11:59] kin folks to us in order to redeem us
[12:02] from the curse of sin and sickness and
[12:05] tonight has sent the Holy Spirit to
[12:08] dwell with the church and show signs and
[12:11] wonders of healing and salvation until
[12:14] he returns again. Amen. How long was it
[12:17] to last? Go ye into all the world and
[12:20] preach the gospel to every creature. Go
[12:22] ye into all the world and demonstrate
[12:24] this power to every creature. These
[12:27] signs will follow them that believe. How
[12:29] far? To all the world. Yes. And when
[12:32] this gospel's gone to all the world,
[12:34] then I will return. That's right. These
[12:38] signs shall follow them to all the world
[12:41] in my name. They shall cast out demons.
[12:45] They shall speak with new tongues. Or if
[12:47] they take up a serpent or or drink a
[12:49] deadly thing, it would not harm them.
[12:51] And if they lay their hands on the sick,
[12:53] they shall recover.
[12:56] Jesus said that that would be the same
[12:59] sign. The fifth quote is a beautiful one
[13:02] from Perseverance 1962.
[13:05] Brother Ram said, "I believe there's a
[13:06] church coming into that perfection." He
[13:08] quotes the five-fold ministry, apostles,
[13:11] prophets, teachers, pastors, evangelists
[13:13] for the perfecting of the church. He
[13:15] said, "The pastors and teachers and so
[13:17] forth will be so with the word until the
[13:19] whole thing will work right up to the
[13:21] coming of the Lord." So, Brother Ram
[13:23] says, "The five-fold ministry will work
[13:25] right up to the coming of the Lord.
[13:27] We'll have preachers right up to the
[13:29] coming of the Lord." The preachers are
[13:31] never going to sit down and just press
[13:33] play. They're not going to neglect their
[13:34] gifts. They're not going to be wicked
[13:35] and slothful servants as Jesus said.
[13:37] Let's listen to the quote. Now I believe
[13:40] that there's a church coming into that
[13:43] perfection,
[13:44] that ministry of perfection where the
[13:49] offices were apostles, prophets,
[13:51] teachers, pastors, evangelists for the
[13:54] perfecting of the church, then pastors
[13:56] and teachers and so forth will be so
[13:58] with the word until the whole thing will
[14:01] work right up to the coming of the Lord.
[14:03] I believe that and I believe we're
[14:05] nearing that time now.
[14:08] I believe it so.
[14:10] And sixth and finally in October 62, the
[14:13] statue of perfect man. Brother Ram's
[14:15] closing the service. He's praying. He
[14:17] quotes Ephesians 4:11 during the prayer.
[14:20] For God is set in the church, apostles,
[14:22] prophets, teachers, pastors,
[14:24] evangelists, all for the perfecting and
[14:26] bringing all these virtues into it for
[14:28] that perfection of the coming of the son
[14:32] of God. So we see brother Ram saying the
[14:34] five-fold ministry will bring the church
[14:36] to the perfection they need to be in the
[14:39] maturity they need to be in for the
[14:41] coming of the son of God. Preachers will
[14:43] preach until the coming of the son of
[14:45] God. Let's listen to the quote. For God
[14:48] has set in the church apostles,
[14:50] prophets, teachers, pastors, and
[14:52] evangelists all for the perfecting and
[14:55] bringing all these virtues into it to
[14:57] that perfection of the coming of the son
[14:59] of God. Each one of these stones are
[15:01] material off of that one. This is
[15:03] material of this. Each one of these
[15:05] virtues belong to him and they're
[15:06] pouring out of him down to him. Amen.
[15:10] And next, real briefly, I'll just go
[15:12] over quickly some of these quotes I've
[15:14] been putting on videos recently where
[15:15] brother Ram supported preachers all the
[15:16] way up till his death and questions and
[15:19] answers on the seals. Should evangelists
[15:21] continue on the field? Brother Ram said,
[15:23] he said, "In this hour, of course,
[15:25] certainly by all means, don't change a
[15:27] thing." So, brother Ram said, "All the
[15:30] evangelistic work should continue and
[15:33] should never change. Don't change a
[15:35] single thing about the five-fold
[15:36] ministry." Yet, what has random
[15:38] tabernacle done? They've changed almost
[15:40] everything about the five-fold ministry.
[15:42] And notice, Brother Ram said, "If you do
[15:44] that, you'll get scrupled up. You become
[15:46] odd, peculiar. People walk into a church
[15:48] and they don't hear a living preacher.
[15:49] They hear a tape playing." That's a cult
[15:52] mentality. That's cultish behavior. He
[15:55] said, "Continue on your evangelistic
[15:57] service. just as you always did. In
[15:59] questions and answers part 364, brother
[16:02] Brandham, is it true no one should
[16:03] preach but you? He said no. Every man
[16:06] that feels a call of God upon his life
[16:09] get into the ministry and start
[16:10] preaching. We need them. Any man that's
[16:13] called of God needs to preach the
[16:15] gospel.
[16:16] Questions and answers part 464. Would we
[16:19] still be on fire and preach the gospel
[16:21] or is the time over? No. Keep preaching
[16:24] just as hard as you can preach, brother.
[16:25] Stay with it. I'm right with you. And
[16:28] then in birth pain 65, Bill Ram said,
[16:30] "These men, if they pick up this and
[16:33] goes out with it, they can make more
[16:34] sense to it. See, to bring it to a place
[16:36] you would, I just want to lay this seed
[16:39] and hope they can make it come to life."
[16:43] Now, the final section of this video, I
[16:44] just want to show three quotes where
[16:46] Brother Bram said, "We're still waiting
[16:48] for his coming." So, I know there might
[16:50] be some false teachers out there that
[16:52] will look at the quotes I've used that
[16:54] say, "Preachers must preach until he
[16:56] comes again," and they'll say, "Well,
[16:58] Jesus already came or something like
[16:59] that. The Lord has already come, so
[17:01] that's why we don't need preachers
[17:02] anymore." That's a lie. That's not found
[17:05] in the scripture, and it's not found in
[17:06] Brother Ram's quotes. We just saw six
[17:08] quotes where Brother Ram said, "The
[17:10] five-fold ministry will keep preaching
[17:12] until Jesus returns along with all those
[17:15] Bible verses." So here's three quotes
[17:18] where brother Ram says Jesus has not
[17:20] come yet. We're still waiting on the
[17:21] coming of the Lord and the coming of the
[17:23] Lord is still at hand. So only deceive
[17:26] people or people that are lying on
[17:28] purpose would say the Lord has already
[17:29] come and and therefore we don't need
[17:32] preachers. The first one is questions
[17:34] and answers part 364. Brother Random
[17:37] said that person of the Lord Jesus is
[17:39] sitting at the right hand of the majesty
[17:41] on high and will come again in great
[17:44] power and glory. So this is 17 months
[17:47] after brother man preached the seven
[17:48] seals and he's still saying that Jesus
[17:51] is in heaven and he will come again. He
[17:54] hasn't come he will come again. Let's
[17:56] listen to the quote. To make me the
[17:59] person of the Lord Jesus Christ would be
[18:01] an antichrist. Amen. See, for that
[18:03] person of the Lord Jesus is sitting at
[18:06] the right hand of the majesty on high
[18:08] and will come again in great power and
[18:10] glory. But next is from what is the
[18:13] intraction on the mountain. I love this.
[18:15] July 65. Brother Ram's on the phone
[18:17] hookup with lots of churches. And he
[18:20] says all these churches in different
[18:22] states are all waiting for the coming of
[18:24] the Lord. That means the Lord hasn't
[18:26] come. Therefore, preachers should keep
[18:27] preaching. Brother Ram said Arizona was
[18:30] waiting for the coming of the Lord.
[18:31] Texas, Illinois, New York, Connecticut,
[18:33] Indiana, all waiting for the coming of
[18:35] the Lord. Let's listen to the quote. We
[18:38] send greetings from the east coast to
[18:41] the west to all our friends in Christ
[18:44] who's listening in.
[18:46] We send greetings over in San Jose,
[18:50] Brother Borders, the group up there. We
[18:53] send greetings up in the mountains,
[18:56] Prescott, Arizona, to Brother Leo Mercer
[18:58] and his group that's up there waiting
[19:00] for the coming of the Lord. We send
[19:03] greetings to those in Tucson that's
[19:05] gathered tonight waiting for the coming
[19:07] of the Lord. down in Houston, Texas, to
[19:10] those who are waiting for the coming of
[19:12] the Lord. Up in Chicago, to those who
[19:14] are waiting for the coming of the Lord
[19:17] up on the east coast, New York and
[19:21] Connecticut and the great groups up
[19:24] there that's waiting for the coming of
[19:25] the Lord. We don't have room here to
[19:28] seat them. So, we just have to send them
[19:31] the word through the the medium of the
[19:33] telephone. We send greetings to brother
[19:35] Junior Jackson tonight and his group
[19:38] down in Clarksville, brother Ruddle up
[19:40] on 62 and his group waiting for the
[19:43] coming of the Lord. And we're gathered
[19:45] here tonight at the home church, the
[19:48] tabernacle waiting for the coming of the
[19:50] Lord. And then finally, just three weeks
[19:53] before brother Ram passed in San
[19:56] Bernardino, California, Brother Ram
[19:58] said, "We preach the coming of the Lord
[20:00] is at hand. Let's get to the fields down
[20:02] there and notify the heathen. See, do
[20:05] something about it. So, weeks before he
[20:07] died, Brother Ram is still looking for
[20:09] the coming of the Lord. The Lord had not
[20:11] come in 1963.
[20:13] The Lord has not come yet. We're still
[20:15] waiting for the coming of the Lord.
[20:17] Therefore, we should keep preaching. Do
[20:20] something about the lost who have never
[20:22] heard the gospel. Let's listen to the
[20:24] quote. We preach the coming of the Lord
[20:26] is at hand. Let's get to the field and
[20:28] notify the heathen. do something about
[20:30] it.
[20:32] In closing, friends, I hope this video
[20:33] was a blessing by the grace of God.
[20:35] Yesterday, this thought came to me about
[20:37] going through all the quotes where
[20:38] brother Ram said, "Preach until Jesus
[20:40] returns." So, we're thankful for those
[20:41] six quotes. Of course, there's probably
[20:43] more, but those are the first six I
[20:45] could find. Then, of course, the Bible
[20:47] fully backs it up, fully supports that
[20:49] preachers should preach until the Lord
[20:51] returns, until the great commission is
[20:53] fulfilled. And the end of the great
[20:55] commission is the gentile rapture, the
[20:57] pre-tribulation rapture by the grace of
[20:59] almighty God. We're thankful that
[21:01] Revelation 22 says, "The spirit and the
[21:03] bride say come." The voice of God is in
[21:06] the current five-fold ministry as far as
[21:08] preaching leadership. But as brother Ram
[21:11] said, every person can be the voice of
[21:13] God as they're yielded to the Holy
[21:15] Ghost. I and my father are one,
[21:20] not three.
[21:22] We are one. Amen. Glory. Glory to God.
[21:26] God is in him. God speaks to him. He's
[21:30] the war his own.
[21:33] But he is God's voice through human.
[21:37] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And every
[21:39] believer in tonight is likewise
[21:43] possessed.
[21:45] So possessed so completely given over to
[21:48] his words become like the words of
[21:50] Christ. He speaks
[21:53] and the word is made flesh. He speaks
[21:56] and the word is manifested. The works
[21:58] that I do shall you do also. These signs
[22:01] shall follow them that bleed. And as
[22:03] I've maintained for numerous years, the
[22:06] sign that the rapture will be upon us
[22:09] will be Revelation 13:16. As brother Ram
[22:12] taught in spoken word, his original seed
[22:15] 62. Brother Ram said, "I believe
[22:17] according to Revelation 13:16 that the
[22:19] bride will be forced to stop preaching."
[22:22] So, we see preachers will keep
[22:24] preaching. It seems right up until the
[22:26] time of the squeeze, the time right
[22:28] before the rapture where Jesus will pour
[22:31] out the latter reign, which Brother Ram
[22:32] calls rapturing faith in the church age
[22:35] book. Hopefully, by God's grace, we'll
[22:37] see the dead in Christ rise first. And
[22:40] that's because at Jesus's resurrection,
[22:43] the Old Testament saints, many of them
[22:45] arose and were seen in the city. So
[22:48] perhaps that will repeat here at the
[22:50] Gentile rapture by the grace of God.
[22:52] That would be such a stimulating event,
[22:55] would certainly raise our faith and give
[22:56] us rapturing faith. We're so thankful
[22:58] for the promises of God, the word of
[23:00] God. Let's continue to do what brother
[23:02] Random said. With our Bible in our hand,
[23:04] we should cry. I believe what God has
[23:06] revealed in this book, especially
[23:08] related to the five-fold ministry for
[23:09] this video. I will obediently keep his
[23:12] commands. I'll keep the commands of
[23:14] Jesus to keep preaching until all
[23:16] nations have heard the gospel. I hope
[23:18] for that which he has promised. He will
[23:20] bring us to a unity of the faith as
[23:22] promised in Ephesians 4:13. He'll do it
[23:26] through the preaching of the five-fold
[23:27] ministry.
[23:29] If you have any questions or concerns or
[23:30] testimonies about this video, please
[23:32] contact me.
[23:33] God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[23:36] the desire of your heart.
[23:39] Very happy to be here this afternoon and
[23:41] again in defense of the gospel of Jesus
[23:43] Christ to bring the good tidings, the
[23:46] good news that Jesus raised from the
[23:48] dead, living among man today, his
[23:50] church. The same Jesus that was
[23:53] yesterday will be today and forever.
[23:57] It never fails.
