Description:
Our teaching video on Revelation Chapter 6 covers the main theme of Jesus' Revelation of the first Six Seals. 

By the grace of God, we are not guessing on the revelations of these Seals, as God has sent a prophet named William Branham to give us "Thus Saith the Lord" about the interpretations.

The symbols and key revelations in this chapter are numerous but our video focuses on the Four Horses, the Souls Under the Altar in the 5th Seal, and the Great Day of Wrath in the 6th Seal.
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] Revelation chapter 6 the theme for this chapter is Jesus's revelation of the first six seals recall that the teaching on this chapter was thus saith the Lord according to God's prophet William Branham the timing of the events in this chapter are well known to us as William Branham gave us thus saith the Lord about them the first seal referred to the white horse rider who wrote during the first two Church ages around 53 ad to 312 ad when the false church began to tell small white lies and deceive many people away from the truth of God's Word conquering many souls into his evil deception of false Christianity the second seal spoke of the Red Horse and his writer who started writing at some point during the third church age between 312 and 606 AD this horse and his rider now had state power for the rider had United Church and state and could kill anyone who disagreed with him the third seal was about the black horse and his writer who began writing at some point during the 4th church age and continued writing in the 5th and 6th church ages as well from around 900 AD to 1900 ad the fourth seal was about the pale horse and his writer who started writing during the seventh and final church age as this pale horse fights with the fourth beast the flying eagle that represents a prophets revelation as God brought out Israel out of Egypt on eagle's wings meaning he brought them out through the Ministry of the prophet Moses according to Exodus 19 verse 4 this is the writer that you and I must contend with for we must have the flying eagle anointing that overcomes the pale horse rider who is named death or spiritual death the fifth seal takes place sometime after the rapture of the New Testament church for there are no more horse riders or beasts at the time of this seal because the church ages are finished and Christ has already taken his wife or bride in the rapture before the Great Tribulation Period the sixth seal will take place sometime during the Great Tribulation Period for it is the great day of the wrath of God and all holy ghost ville believers are kept from the wrath of God the symbols and key revelations in this chapter are numerous so we encourage you to read the book the revelation of the seven seals by William Branham which is available at www.fixez.com any souls into a false form of Christianity during the first two Church ages the writer was eventually given a crown which represents the literal crowns given to the early Pope's who were the leaders of the mother harlot the false church or the Roman Catholic Church which rides the beast or spirit of Rome that is deceiving billions yet today the overcomers of this white horse or spirit filled believers were empowered by the anointing of the lion which was a bold powerful anointing of the Holy Ghost the red horse represents the bloody killing with the great sword which the Roman Catholic Church achieved by uniting church and state during the third and fourth church ages the Roman Catholic Church shed much blood through their bloody Crusades Inquisition and other wars of conquest the overcomers of this red horse were empowered by the anointing of the calf which was power to labor greatly for Christ and to give their lives as a sacrifice many times as martyrs the black horse represents the time period known as the Dark Ages which occurred during the fourth fifth and sixth Church ages during this evil ministry the Roman Catholic Church and her daughter churches began capturing the wealth of the world as the balances in his hand reveal this continued church and state power had control over the natural necessities of life wheat and barley and sought to control the spiritual lives of men as well during this time the Roman Catholic Church came into possession of priceless artworks which now fill its museums galleries and libraries the overcomers of this black horse were empowered by the anointing of the man which was cunningness and discernment of God's wisdom in the leaders of the Reformation period like Martin Luther and John Wesley to name a few the overcomers were also given a tremendous promise from Christ who cried out in the midst of the four beasts that the black horse rider could not hurt the oil and wine meaning that the Antichrist spear would never be able to separate the true believer from the power of the Holy Ghost and the stimulation and inspiration that he daily brings to the believer the pale horse represents the combined colors of the three previous riders and means that those three evil powers would be combined in the final rider named death who rides all the way into the Great Tribulation Period this means our church the latest in church age must battle spiritual death the deceptive lying spirit of the Antichrist as well as has United Church state government world systems who hold and control all the wealth of the world the overcomers of this pale horse you and I are to be empowered by the anointing of the flying eagle which is the revelation of the word of God through a genuine prophet of God as described earlier referring to the Ministry of Moses in Exodus 19 verse 4 we have received this anointing through the Ministry of God's prophet William Branham who preached the revelation of the seven seals and the seven church ages with thus saith the Lord these four horses have the same rider who is actually the same person in the successive or continual evil ministry this person is the spirit of the Antichrist for this Spirit is the spirit of death and has even identified as death by the fourth beast the flying eagle this is the spirit of disobedience to the Word of God which hates the true Word of God and will not obey it the Antichrist spirit of death is the opposite of the Holy Spirit who is life each horse rider is identified by one of the four beasts as the beasts represent the powers or anointings of the Holy Ghost that will combat overcome and defeat each of the riders in the ages in which they ride the souls under the altar in the Fasil were revealed to be the martyred Jews along with all this Jews of the nation of Israel and are not martyred Christians this is true because they were slain for the word of God but not for the testimony of Jesus Christ this revelation was previously taught in Chapter one of the book of Revelation so please see our video on chapter one remember that Saint John had both the testimony of Jesus Christ and the Word of God to further prove these are faithful Jews they asked for revenge for their blood but Holy Ghost filled Christians like Stephen do not ask for revenge but rather ask for forgiveness for their enemies also these Jews are given white robes after death but Christians have white robes before death while they live on the earth for they are born again of the Holy Ghost and have eternal life now while they're on the earth a final observation is that more faithful Jews are going to have to be martyred after the rapture for revelation 6 verse 11 says that their fellow servants should be killed as they were the great day of wrath in the sixth seal is a complete interruption of nature during the Tribulation Period as a massive earthquake takes place the Sun becomes black and the moon becomes as blood stars fall to the earth every mountain and island are moved out of their places this major interruption of nature will be directed by the two witnesses or prophets of revelation 11 verses 3 to 14 it is likely that these two witnesses are literally moses and elijah brought back to the earth by God to preach Christ to the 144,000 Israeli believers during the Tribulation Period as revelation 11 6 so vividly describes the Ministry of Elijah and Moses we pray you can now see the importance of this seven seal book and you can understand why John was weeping much in chapter 5 verse 4 if it was not going to be revealed these revelations mean so much to the believer because they expose how Satan defiles a church and shows the progression of the Antichrist spirit which goes from small white lies of deception followed by a bloody red United Church and state meaning it kills men and in flu of true believers followed by a money-hungry kingdom building conquest and then it ends in complete spiritual death a rejection of the Word of God with no Holy Ghost baptisms and no Holy Ghost experiences the glory of these revelations also show how the true Christian overcomes Satan and his Antichrist spirit through the anointing of the Holy Ghost the oil and wine that Satan cannot touch or defeat if you like more bible scriptures quotations or if you have any questions about the book of Revelation please contact us god bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
