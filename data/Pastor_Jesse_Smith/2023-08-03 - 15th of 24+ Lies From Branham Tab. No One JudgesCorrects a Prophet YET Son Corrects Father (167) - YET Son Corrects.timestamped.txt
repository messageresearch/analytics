[0:00] [Music]
[0:06] that's just
[0:08] made it read s
[0:13] and yes
[0:17] [Music]
[0:32] greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:35] of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of
[0:38] this video is to show the 15th lie
[0:41] coming out of Branham Tabernacle which
[0:43] is prophets are not judged or profits
[0:48] cannot be corrected or profits do not
[0:52] make mistakes
[0:53] friends I'll be playing two audio clips
[0:56] as evidence of this lie along with
[1:00] sharing two blog posts
[1:02] and a cub Corner magazine as evidence of
[1:06] this lie
[1:07] let's briefly review the 14 previous
[1:10] lies lie number one every word on tape
[1:13] is thus saith the Lord the tapes can
[1:15] never be wrong the tapes have no
[1:17] mistakes the tapes have every answer lie
[1:20] number two all the answers are on the
[1:22] tapes lie number three random Tabernacle
[1:25] claims we must unquestionably believe
[1:28] every word on the tape is thus say if
[1:30] the Lord even if brother Branham lied
[1:32] is that all churches must catch a false
[1:35] vision of a denominational mandate to
[1:38] play the tapes and every church is a
[1:40] tape Church
[1:42] the fifth lie is the tapes are the token
[1:44] and being part of a tape church is the
[1:47] token
[1:48] the sixth lie is Tate boys are the true
[1:50] fifo Ministry and tapes are number one
[1:53] in the five full ministry
[1:55] the seventh lie is brother branham's
[1:57] Spear and soul are identical to Jesus's
[2:00] spirit and soul
[2:02] the eighth lie is that brother Branham
[2:05] has a living Ministry and anyone who
[2:06] doesn't believe that is a Demas
[2:10] the ninth lie is that revelation 22
[2:12] verse 16 is Jesus telling us all to be
[2:15] taped churches
[2:17] the tenth lie is that the angel of
[2:19] revelation 22 verses 6 through 9 and
[2:22] verse 16 is brother Branham
[2:24] the 11th lie is that brother and tapes
[2:27] are the absolute
[2:28] the 12th lie is that anyone who does not
[2:32] play tapes is a make-believer and
[2:34] unbeliever
[2:36] the 13th lie is that thus saith the Lord
[2:39] Branham Tabernacle is in the perfect
[2:41] will of God by playing tapes and
[2:43] decreasing living preachers
[2:46] and the 14th lie is that Branham
[2:49] Tabernacle
[2:50] are the greatest people of all time
[2:52] brother Branham is the greatest prophet
[2:55] of all time
[2:56] and Branham tabernacle's current Pastor
[2:59] has the greatest Ministry
[3:00] and that brother random son is the most
[3:03] blessed person on Earth
[3:07] now let's look at the 15th lie but
[3:09] before we get into that I want to
[3:12] reference my 95th video it's about a 33
[3:14] minute long video and it's called
[3:17] brother branham's Human Side welcomed
[3:19] correction and answer the question who
[3:21] are you to correct God's prophet
[3:24] this video was released December 28 2021
[3:28] so if you'd like a full teaching about
[3:31] how brother Brandon welcome correction
[3:33] and actually receive correction from
[3:35] numerous people please watch that video
[3:37] with an honest humble heart and you will
[3:40] see both Bible proof from numerous
[3:42] prophets in the bible such as Moses
[3:45] Elijah Saint Paul Saint Peter numerous
[3:49] other prophets that receive correction
[3:51] and were corrected and also numerous
[3:54] examples of other random receiving
[3:56] correction from people who are not even
[3:58] prophets like his wife and brother
[4:00] Sherrod
[4:02] so let's look at the first audio
[4:04] evidence of this live the first audio
[4:06] evidence is from a sermon preliminary by
[4:09] Branham Tabernacles current Pastor he
[4:12] says quote Nolan judges a prophet no one
[4:14] corrects his word this is and this isn't
[4:16] what a mess end quote
[4:19] I'll play this audio in a moment but
[4:21] notice Bram Tabernacles Pastor is trying
[4:24] to say no one can judge his father in
[4:27] order to deified his father and deify
[4:30] every word on his father's tapes if no
[4:33] one is to judge anything on tape then
[4:36] that would mean no one has the gift of
[4:38] discernment
[4:39] and if that's the case then Branham
[4:41] Tabernacle is guilty of taking away from
[4:43] the word of God they're guilty of
[4:45] deleting one of the nine gifts of the
[4:47] holy spirit according to First
[4:48] Corinthians chapter 12. and the Branham
[4:51] Tabernacle deletes the gift of
[4:52] discernment then it's possible their
[4:54] names could be deleted out of the book
[4:56] of life according to revelation 22
[4:58] verses 18 and 19 because we cannot
[5:00] delete even one word of the revelation
[5:03] of Jesus Christ
[5:04] so I'll play the audio now of random
[5:07] tabernacle's current Pastor saying no
[5:09] one judges a prophet but immediately
[5:11] after I'm going to play three quotes of
[5:14] God's Prophet brother Branham inviting
[5:17] the people to judge him and his ministry
[5:20] as a prophet so again random Tabernacles
[5:23] contradicting their own Prophet they say
[5:26] no one judges a prophet and then brother
[5:27] Ram says Judge Me by the word of God the
[5:30] first quotes from obey the voice of the
[5:32] Angel 1950 brother Branham says if these
[5:36] things that I have said come to pass
[5:37] then you believe God he says if they
[5:40] don't come to pass I am a false prophet
[5:42] he said that's fair to any congregation
[5:44] isn't it he says you judge according and
[5:47] he says look at it in the way you should
[5:49] as a Christian men and women and then
[5:52] you can pass your opinion and I'll pray
[5:54] that God will bless us and give us his
[5:56] presence notice brother random isn't
[5:58] angry when he's saying judge me
[5:59] according to the word of God he says
[6:02] that's being fair according to brother
[6:04] random there is a Fair way to judge a
[6:05] prophet
[6:06] and the way to fairly judge a prophet is
[6:09] to see if his prophecies come to pass
[6:11] so let's listen to the quotes back to
[6:13] back
[6:14] it can be no one judges the prophet
[6:17] no one corrects his word this is and
[6:20] this isn't what a mess they want to go
[6:23] back to the age behind us
[6:28] [Music]
[6:30] they do not come to Texas
[6:36] [Music]
[6:37] and you just let God use judged
[6:40] according don't be prejudiced uh try to
[6:45] just be forever and just come sit down
[6:48] and look at it in the way that you
[6:50] should as Christian men and women and
[6:52] then you can pass your opinion no one
[6:55] judges a prophet
[6:59] [Music]
[7:04] no one judges a prophet you judge
[7:08] according
[7:09] here's a second quote from Brother
[7:11] Branham Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[7:12] today and forever
[7:14] brother Brandon invites the people to
[7:16] judge this meeting brother Graham says
[7:19] the way to judge is to use Deuteronomy
[7:21] chapter 18 verses 21-22 the way we know
[7:26] a prophet is if his word comes to pass
[7:28] brother Ram says judge it by your own
[7:31] self and by the word again brother I am
[7:33] saying this in kindness
[7:35] brother is not saying you can't judge me
[7:37] this is a second witness brother and a
[7:39] welcomed judgment he welcome correction
[7:42] he wanted people to be able to judge if
[7:44] he was a prophet or not and of course he
[7:46] was a genuine Prophet let's listen to
[7:48] the quotes back to back
[7:50] it can't be no one judges a prophet
[7:54] no one corrects his word this is and
[7:56] this isn't what a mess they want to go
[7:59] back to the age behind us
[8:01] and what he says comes to pass and hear
[8:04] him well I'm with him
[8:06] that's where to judge this meeting
[8:07] tonight
[8:09] if the word says so in the holy spirit's
[8:11] true it'll manifest it if it doesn't
[8:13] then it's not the holy spirit amen
[8:16] that's Judge it by your own self and by
[8:19] the word
[8:21] no one judges the prophet
[8:23] that's way to judge this meeting tonight
[8:26] judge it by your own self and by the
[8:28] word
[8:29] in the third quote from Abraham in a
[8:31] seat after him from 1961 brother random
[8:34] said God told them how to tell it to
[8:36] tell if a prophet was a genuine Prophet
[8:39] or not if what they say come to pass
[8:41] then it's right if it isn't it isn't now
[8:44] you be your own judge so again brother
[8:47] Brandon is telling the people to judge
[8:49] me I'm a prophet of God judge me on the
[8:53] basis of whether things come to pass or
[8:55] not so Branham tabernacle's Pastor is
[8:57] deceived he's not saying what his father
[9:00] said let's listen to the quotes back to
[9:02] back
[9:03] it can't be no one judges the prophet no
[9:07] one corrects his word this is and this
[9:09] isn't what a mess they want to go back
[9:12] to the age behind us
[9:15] signs and wonders proof whether it's
[9:17] right or not God told him how to tell it
[9:19] if what they say comes to pass then it's
[9:21] right if it is it isn't it now you be
[9:23] your own judge you better flee to God
[9:26] Pentecostal while you got a chance to
[9:28] I'll share two other quotes very quickly
[9:31] and have faith in God 1958 brother
[9:33] Branham says write it in the fly leaf of
[9:35] your Bible and say that brother Branham
[9:37] said so if it doesn't come to pass I'm a
[9:39] false prophet for I have thus saith the
[9:42] Lord
[9:42] brother was talking about God's anger
[9:44] against the United States but notice
[9:46] brother Brandon again welcome the people
[9:48] write down my prophecy Judge Me by
[9:51] whether it comes to pass or not well
[9:53] Iran was not afraid to be judged by the
[9:55] prophecies that the lord gave him that
[9:57] proved he was a genuine Prophet God's
[10:00] anger is handled against the nation
[10:03] and you're going to receive
[10:06] punishment and judgment rather than a
[10:09] fly lead to your Bible and said that
[10:11] brother Branham said so it doesn't come
[10:13] to pass I'm a false prophet
[10:16] for I have just stay at the law
[10:20] and then in spoken word original seat
[10:22] 1962 brother Ram said the elected is the
[10:26] only kind that will catch it the word of
[10:28] God brother Branham asked a hypothetical
[10:30] question well you say how do you know
[10:33] that you're not right brother Ram says
[10:34] then test me by the word come test your
[10:37] denomination by this word let's see
[10:39] who's right prove all things the Bible
[10:41] said so again brother Graham is inviting
[10:44] others come test me by the word come
[10:46] Judge Me by the word and let's see if
[10:48] the denomination is right or the
[10:50] Revelation Jesus Christ gave me as a
[10:52] prophet is right let's listen to the
[10:54] quote
[10:55] remember it's the elected is the only
[10:58] kind that'll catch it
[11:01] what do you say how do you know it
[11:02] you're not right then test me by the
[11:04] word
[11:05] come test your denomination by this word
[11:08] prove all things
[11:13] audio from Branham tabernacle's current
[11:15] pastor
[11:16] and in this audio
[11:19] the Branham Tabernacle Pastor corrects
[11:21] brother Branham
[11:23] and yet Branham tabernacle's pastor says
[11:25] no one corrects the prophet of God no
[11:28] one judges the prophet of God
[11:30] right I'm tabernacle's pastor
[11:32] said brother Branham thought the coming
[11:34] of the Lord
[11:35] was in his generation and there was
[11:38] nothing to hinder the coming of the Lord
[11:39] and then the Branham Tabernacle Pastor
[11:42] says that wasn't God's time for the
[11:45] coming
[11:46] and Branham tabernacle's Pastor is
[11:48] saying this is the time of Jesus's
[11:50] coming
[11:51] and friends this audio shows the
[11:53] spiritually blind state of Branham
[11:55] tabernacle's pastor and their entire
[11:57] church this is utter hypocrisy
[12:00] random Tabernacle claims they don't
[12:02] correct the prophet they don't judge the
[12:04] prophet and yet by their own words
[12:06] they're judging the prophet and saying
[12:09] the prophet's lifetime wasn't the time
[12:11] for the coming of the Lord God had the
[12:13] coming of Lord for a different time
[12:15] Branham Tabernacle is saying
[12:17] the coming of the Lord was hindered in
[12:20] brother branham's time even though
[12:21] brother random said he didn't see
[12:22] anything to hinder the coming of the
[12:24] Lord
[12:25] so let's play these three audio clips
[12:27] back to back we'll play random
[12:30] tabernacle's current Pastor saying no
[12:32] one can judge a prophet and then we'll
[12:34] play Brenham Tabernacles current Pastor
[12:37] judging the prophet correcting the
[12:39] profit brother Branham and then we'll
[12:41] play brother Ram's quote about how he
[12:43] did not see anything hindering the
[12:45] coming of the Lord during his lifetime
[12:47] let's listen to the quotes
[12:49] it can't be no one judges the prophet
[12:53] no one corrects his word this is and
[12:56] this isn't what a mess they want to go
[12:58] back to the age behind us
[13:01] and that the time that we're living in
[13:03] there's never been a time like this it
[13:06] wasn't for back there the same thing in
[13:07] the time brother Branham thought then
[13:09] and this is it he doesn't see nothing
[13:11] that's hindering it but God had a time
[13:14] and a plan thank God for that that's
[13:25] it
[13:26] no one corrects his word this is and
[13:29] this isn't
[13:30] brother Brandon thought then and this is
[13:32] it he doesn't see nothing that's
[13:34] hindering it but God had a time and a
[13:37] plan
[13:38] before moving on I do want to say it is
[13:40] true no one corrects a thus saith the
[13:42] Lord from a true Prophet like Moses
[13:45] Jeremiah Ezekiel Elijah Saint Paul Saint
[13:49] Peter brother Bradham but we do have to
[13:51] wait until the thus say the Lord comes
[13:54] to pass which is judging it and that's
[13:57] according to Deuteronomy 18 verses 21
[13:59] and 22 and Jeremiah 28 verse 9.
[14:03] Deuteronomy 18 21 says if and if thou
[14:06] say in thine heart how shall we know the
[14:07] word which the Lord hath not spoken when
[14:09] a prophet speaketh in the name of the
[14:11] Lord if the thing follow not nor come to
[14:13] pass that is the thing which the Lord
[14:15] hath not spoken but the prophet has
[14:17] spoken it presumptuously Thou shalt not
[14:19] be afraid of him
[14:21] brother random quotes this scripture
[14:23] almost verbatim and we would see Jesus
[14:26] July 12 1962 and brother Graham said
[14:30] quote that's the way Israel knowed their
[14:33] prophets end quote and then brother
[14:34] random went on to say that's how he can
[14:36] be judged as well because he was a
[14:38] prophet of God
[14:40] a prophet that fulfilled Malachi 4 5 and
[14:42] 6 Luke 17 30 Revelation 10 7 Matthew 17
[14:47] 11 Amos 3 verses 7 and 8 and numerous
[14:50] other scriptures
[14:52] also Jeremiah 28 verse 9 says this
[14:55] Jeremiah said the prophet which
[14:57] prophesied the peace when the word of
[14:59] the Prophet shall come to pass then
[15:01] shall the prophet be known that the Lord
[15:03] had truly sent him
[15:05] so again here's another Prophet so Moses
[15:07] said it now Jeremiah says it and of
[15:09] course brother Branham said it but all
[15:11] prophets are judged when there thus
[15:14] saith the Lord prophecies come to pass
[15:16] they're judged a genuine prophet of God
[15:18] and then each person has to judge that
[15:21] prophet in their own heart whether
[15:23] they'll receive it or reject it as
[15:24] brother random said he said that's
[15:26] making it fair every person has to judge
[15:28] a prophet of God and that's what acts 13
[15:31] 46 says then Paul Barnabas wax bold and
[15:35] I'll skip down to the end and the
[15:37] scripture says and judge yourselves
[15:38] Unworthy of everlasting life Lo we turn
[15:41] to the Gentiles so the Bible records
[15:45] that every person's reaction to the
[15:47] prophet of God judges each person if we
[15:50] receive it it judges us worthy of
[15:53] eternal life if we reject it it judges
[15:56] us Unworthy of everlasting life
[15:59] thank God we've received brother Branham
[16:01] as a genuine prophet of God he's turned
[16:03] our hearts back to the apostolic fathers
[16:05] he's pointing us back to Acts 2 38 for
[16:08] salvation and the baptism of the Holy
[16:10] Ghost back to Ephesians chapter 2 verses
[16:12] 8 through 10 we're saved by grace
[16:14] through faith it is a gift of God no man
[16:17] can boast to Salvation it's all Jesus
[16:19] Christ and so we've judged our own
[16:21] selves worthy of everlasting life by the
[16:24] grace of God
[16:26] now I want to move on to two blog posts
[16:28] the first is from April 10 2021 the
[16:32] pastor of Brenham Tabernacle wrote quote
[16:34] but the tapes can never be wrong end
[16:37] quote
[16:40] now friends this is a lie brother
[16:41] Branham said there's Mix-Ups on the
[16:43] tapes
[16:44] brother Brandon said I make mistakes all
[16:46] the time like mixing up 700 that did not
[16:49] bow the knee with seven thousand seven
[16:51] thousands the actual number that did not
[16:53] bow the need to bail in the Days of
[16:55] Elijah
[16:56] let's play these quotes back to back
[16:59] random Tabernacle says the tapes can
[17:01] never be wrong let's listen to brother
[17:03] Ramsay the opposite
[17:04] like the other day I got something mixed
[17:06] up I happen to hear it yes I caught it
[17:08] right there and it's on the tape and I I
[17:10] probably hear from it when I was talking
[17:12] I was a great teaching there I didn't
[17:13] touch the age of it but uh if you happen
[17:16] to catch that on your tape remember look
[17:17] in the Bible you see it's seven months
[17:20] after that I I I'm a minister the gospel
[17:23] uh many times I've preached that I know
[17:25] that was seven thousand I just happened
[17:27] to say 700 I didn't mean the 700 I meant
[17:30] you I just didn't read it out of the
[17:33] scripture just come to my mind while I
[17:34] was talking and I just said 700 instead
[17:36] of 7 000. I make that mistakes the whole
[17:39] time I'm a second blog post is from July
[17:42] 30 2022
[17:44] random Tabernacles Pastor wrote quote
[17:46] thus we learn what is on the tapes are
[17:48] the words of God and there are no
[17:50] mistakes in the words of God end quote
[17:53] of course this is a lie random
[17:56] Tabernacles making every word on tape
[17:58] thus say the Lord that's heresy that's
[18:01] idolatry that's a deity spirit and
[18:04] brother Brown said the opposite again so
[18:06] let's play those quotes again there's
[18:08] mix up on the tapes my brother RAM does
[18:10] those types of Mix-Ups all the time as
[18:12] he said let's listen to the quotes
[18:14] like the other day I got something mixed
[18:16] up I happen to hear it yes I called it
[18:18] right there and it's on the tape and I I
[18:20] probably hear from it when I was talking
[18:22] I was a great teaching there I didn't
[18:23] touch the age of it but uh if you had to
[18:26] catch that on your tape remember look in
[18:27] the Bible you see it's seven months
[18:30] after that I I I'll administer the
[18:33] gospel uh many times I've preached that
[18:34] I know that was seven thousand I just
[18:37] happened to say 700 I didn't mean the
[18:39] 700 I mean you I just didn't read it out
[18:43] of the scripture just come to my mind
[18:44] while I was talking and I just said 700
[18:46] instead of seven thousand I make that
[18:48] mistakes all the time I'm our final
[18:50] piece of evidence is a cub Corner
[18:52] magazine here's the issue it's issue
[18:54] number 32. I'll put a screenshot on the
[18:57] video for you
[18:59] if you open the magazine to page number
[19:02] three I'll put a screenshot of this as
[19:04] well
[19:05] voice of God Recordings and Brandon
[19:07] Tabernacle writes quote no mistakes as
[19:10] we said before God's prophets have thus
[19:12] saith the Lord if we believe that to be
[19:14] the truth and we must also believe that
[19:15] God's prophets make no mistakes because
[19:17] God makes no mistakes end quote
[19:20] friends this is sad propaganda to
[19:23] Children which is why we stopped getting
[19:25] the Cub the corner magazine so I'll
[19:27] leave this quote up on the screen and
[19:29] I'll play quotes from Brother Branham
[19:30] that say the exact opposite the first is
[19:33] from the identified Christ of all ages
[19:35] 64.
[19:36] brother Branham said he proved to you
[19:39] that every Prophet made their mistakes
[19:41] but God makes no mistakes let's listen
[19:43] to the quote now all I could say I'm a
[19:46] man my words can just fail it's like any
[19:49] other man all of us I prove to you
[19:50] tonight that every Prophet everything
[19:52] else they made their mistakes
[19:54] but God makes no mistakes
[19:56] his word is the truth how many believes
[19:58] that he is the word
[20:00] Also let's play another quote where
[20:01] brother random said Nathan a prophet of
[20:03] God in the days of David made a mistake
[20:05] not willingly but the fact is he still
[20:08] made a mistake he told David to do all
[20:10] that was in David's heart and then God
[20:12] had to correct Nathan and David on that
[20:14] statement let's listen to the quote
[20:17] Nathan the prophet said David do all is
[20:19] in your heart cause God's with you
[20:22] the prophet made a mistake not willingly
[20:24] that night the Lord comes the prophet
[20:25] said go tell my servant sort of conserve
[20:28] time let me just share a few more
[20:29] examples of how prophets make mistakes
[20:31] brother Brandon called Saint Peter a
[20:34] prophet but yet Saint Peter was to blame
[20:36] in Galatians Chapter 2 for not eating
[20:38] with the Gentiles so the prophet made a
[20:41] mistake and another Prophet Paul
[20:43] corrected him
[20:46] in 1965 The God Who is rich in Mercy
[20:48] brother Branham was preaching and there
[20:50] were theologians behind him and he said
[20:52] maybe they will correct me when I'm
[20:53] wrong I hope so so this shows again
[20:56] brother Branham was humble and open to
[20:59] receiving correction brother Brown
[21:01] didn't tell the theologians none of you
[21:03] can ever correct me because I'm a
[21:04] prophet of God none of you can ever
[21:06] judge me because I'm a prophet let's
[21:08] listen to the quote
[21:09] I feel kind of small to stand here and
[21:11] speak with such theologians behind me
[21:13] and maybe they'll correct me when I'm
[21:17] wrong
[21:19] I hope so
[21:21] also brother Ram said numerous times he
[21:24] wasn't infallible and brother random
[21:26] said it was an awful thing and Tommy rot
[21:28] to say he was perfectly infallible which
[21:31] is what Branham Tabernacle is saying
[21:32] random Tabernacle is saying awful Tommy
[21:35] rot things
[21:37] make mistakes you pray for me I'm not in
[21:40] Southpaw I'm your brother
[21:43] they're claiming here that some brethren
[21:45] up there that said that I sent them up
[21:47] there and they're preaching that man
[21:49] should lead their wives and hunt for
[21:51] their spiritual mate
[21:52] and it um that I am perfectly infallible
[21:56] that there's nothing and over some of
[21:59] the office things you've ever heard in
[22:00] the Ministerial Association got a hold
[22:03] of it and they're writing me a letter by
[22:06] and um and I sent them up there and it's
[22:09] causing a lot of confusion and some of
[22:12] them prophesying and saying that one man
[22:13] should leave this wife and go marry that
[22:15] one uh this church knows that we don't
[22:17] stand for No Such Tommy Rod is that we
[22:20] believe in the Bible brother random also
[22:22] said his wife Mita was his correction
[22:25] and also brother random said brother
[22:27] Sheriff corrected him about giving and
[22:30] receiving and you can again see that on
[22:31] the 95th video now my wife she's my
[22:36] correction you know Brethren want I'm
[22:39] talking about she's one time I thought
[22:41] it wasn't right to receive a presence
[22:46] brother shares a man corrected me on
[22:49] that because
[22:49] [Music]
[22:52] you're mistaken there
[22:56] [Music]
[22:59] to lose
[23:01] their reward
[23:02] that is more blessing to give than it is
[23:06] in closing
[23:08] hope this video has been a blessing
[23:10] friends friends the spirit of Truth is
[23:13] guiding us into all truth as Jesus
[23:16] Promised in John 16 verse 13 churches
[23:20] like Brenham Tabernacle and other tape
[23:21] churches are being guided away from the
[23:24] truth they're turning off their
[23:26] discernment gifts they're neglecting the
[23:28] gifts that God gave them
[23:30] and an evil spirit of idolatry a deity
[23:33] spirit is causing them to do this so
[23:35] let's pray for them

[23:38] merciful to Branham Tabernacle their
[23:40] leadership and all the tape church
[23:42] people around the world God may they
[23:43] repent of their idolatry may they humble
[23:46] themselves and recognize these quotes
[23:48] from Brother Branham and these
[23:50] scriptures from the Bible may they come
[23:52] to genuine repentance and may they
[23:54] forsake their taped Church lies all
[23:58] these 24 plus lies granted Lord Jesus I
[24:01] know you'll save the elect for the elect
