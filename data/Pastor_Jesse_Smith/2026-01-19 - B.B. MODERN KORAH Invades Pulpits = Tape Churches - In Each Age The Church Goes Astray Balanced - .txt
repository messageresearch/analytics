TRANSCRIPT
========================================
And they say the gifted ministry of Ephesians 4:10-13 that God gave the church has failed. So they are taking over. Here we are right in the midst of the fulfillment of prophecy called the gains of Kora and they don't even know that they have fulfilled it. Greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of this video is to show the tape boys favorite church age book quote that they like to twist and misconstrue and then show how if taken into context along with other quotes from the church age book about the five-fold ministry actually proves they are the core movement of this day. Recently, this thought came to me as I've been reading through the church age book another time. And I've honestly felt as I've read through the church age book that the church age book is a complete repudiation of the false doctrines coming out of the current brand of tabernacle leadership. And that's because the church age book is a complete repudiation of the antichrist spirit which starts out as deeds of nicicoatans and then turns to doctrine of nicicoatans and the doctrine of balum and then finally the Jezebel spirit. So our biblical foundation is Ephesians 4:es 8-16 that establish the five-fold ministry of living men preaching the living word. Not dead men preaching the word, but living men preaching the living word of God. And it will be in place according to Paul until we all come in the unity of the faith. That's still happening. This message is still going around the world, converting souls, saving souls, filling souls with the Holy Ghost. So the Holy Ghost is still bringing unity to the body of Christ around the world. And brother Bram said, "We are to preach until Jesus returns." As a recent video showed, by the grace of God, the Bible, and brother Bram never said, preachers are going to sit down and just press play at the end time. There's no Bible verse that says that, but thank God, the Bible says, "The five-fold ministry will bring the bride to the unity of the faith and the fullness of the stature of the measure of Jesus Christ." So, let's read the first quote that the tape boys love so much that they even sing about it as I put in a video and I'll leave a link to that in the description as well. In the video from Brandom Tabernacle, someone sings a song special and uses this line from the church age book to condemn the five-fold ministry and the leadership of Brandom Tabernacle is they're clapping, singing, and going along with it. Sadly, we should have pity on them as brother Brandham says in the church age book. So we must always have our filter on in this deceiving day. For in every age the leoty and the clergy goes astray. So Ephesians 4 is not enough to bring this bride in shape. But the voice of the chief shepherd is on tape. And that's why we persuade and obey for. But here's the two sentences that they like to misconstrue. It's from page 252 in the old blue church age book. Nor is it even enough that we see the five-fold ministry of Ephesians 4, apostles, prophets, teachers, evangelists, pastors. For in each age the church goes astray and is not just the leoty but the clergy group. Shepherds are wrong as well as sheep. End quote. &gt;&gt; For in every age the leoty and the clergy goes astray. &gt;&gt; So tape boys will take this simple phrase for in each age the church goes astray and they will use that to say that no one should preach anymore because the preachers have all gone astray. So sad. So ridiculous. Such an antichrist statement to lump all the preachers as going astray. And yet the word of God doesn't teach that. Brother Brandham never taught that every single preacher will go astray and the preachers should just sit down and press play. That's a lie. That's heresy. That's nonsense. That's a false doctrine. Now, let's read the full context of the quote here. Let's go up a few sentences earlier. Thus, when we see that the messengers are in his hand, we see the Lord identifying himself with these men and granting them his power. It is not enough that he has associated himself with the whole church, which we saw when he was seen standing amongst the seven golden candlesticks. Nor is it even enough that we see the five-fold ministry of Ephesians 4, apostles, prophets, teachers, evangelists, pastors. For in each age the church goes astray and is not just the leoty but the clergy group shepherds are wrong as well as sheep. Now I'm going to pause right there. So brother Ram sets it up as in every age the church goes astray. That's true. And he's connecting that with the seven church age messengers. Now notice the next sentence gives the full context. So let's read that quote. Then God brings himself on the scene as the chief shepherd in the ministries of these seven men to lead his people back to the truth and the abundant power of that truth. End quote. So we see an order that brother Brandham gave in this quote. First the church goes astray, then God sends the messenger. So let's apply that to brother Brandham's day. The Pentecostals went astray. So what did God do? God sent a messenger named William Brandham to bring the church back to the truth and the abundant power of the truth. So Brandham Tabernacle has completely misconstrued this quote. This quote actually proves that we as the true bride of Jesus Christ with the five-fold ministry are restored back to the truth because we have the apostolic truth and the power of the Holy Ghost. So this proves tape boys are not preachers. They have no gift to rightly divide the word of truth. They can't even understand one paragraph. If they can't understand one paragraph of the church age book, how are they going to understand one sentence in the Bible? They're not going to. And their fruits have proven that they're corrupt fruits. Now, also on top of that, you have the scripture that says, "God never leaves himself without a witness." Acts 14:17, "Nevertheless, he left not himself without a witness." So, this Bible verse proves Brennham Tabernacle is misinterpreting this church age. a quote random tabernacle saying God has no witnesses that are preachers. So that's why we just press play and obey. But that's a lie. God never leaves himself without a witness. There's 10 times brother Ram said always had a witness. You can look it up. Brother Ram says this 10 times God always has a witness. That means someone has been faithful. Not everyone has gone astray. There's someone who's faithful in every age at all times and all seasons of that church age. There's 10 quotes on this again, but I'm going to read just one where brother Ram says, "There's many hundreds of witnesses alive in 1950." Quote, "God has never left himself without a testimony. There's always been somebody somewhere that God could put his hand and say, "Here's my servant. He's always, it's gotten down to sometimes just about one left, but God has always had a witness." You believe that, don't you, Noah? and and down many times through his prophets and so forth, but he's never left himself without an earthly witness that he could work through, speak through, who would go out in the midst of criticism and declare him. That's right. And I'm thankful that he's got many, many hundreds of servants now he can work through just before the coming. End quote. Beautiful, powerful quote here from God's prophet, Brother Brandham. Notice he doesn't even make himself the only witness. He says there's many, many hundreds of witnesses Jesus Christ still has on the earth. And that's true. So that must be true today as well because according to the church age book quote, now we have the truth and the abundant power of the truth because the messengers already came. And that lines up with Ephesians 4:es 8-16 on the purpose and ministry of the five-fold ministry. So now let's see what else did brother Ram say about the five-fold ministry in the church age book. I would like the tape boys to know this. So if you go to page 129 in the old blue book, brother Ram said, quote, "If you don't think this is true, just listen to this. All over the world in both Pentecostal and fundamental groups, they are organizing the businessmen. They have invaded the pulpit without a call from God. They have styled themselves as the fishers of men and the founders of a move of God. And they say the gifted ministry of Ephesians 4 10 through13 that God gave the church has failed. So they are taking over." End quote. Friends, who is saying the five-fold ministry has failed? It's the Brandham Tabernacle. It's the Tate Boys. And they even sing songs about it. &gt;&gt; For in every age, the leoty and the clergy goes astray. &gt;&gt; Who's the one that says preachers have to catch the vision? They have to play the tapes and sit down and just press play. That's Joseph Brandom. &gt;&gt; But they got to catch the vision. You got to play the tapes. They're the token. &gt;&gt; Who is saying the five-fold ministries failed? It's the current Brandham tabernacle. Let's keep reading. Quote, "Here we are right in the midst of the fulfillment of prophecy called the gang sayings of Kora, and they don't even know that they have fulfilled it. They're blindly going on preaching experience for truth." End quote. So, brother Ram says, "Whoever says the five-fold ministries failed, are the modern-day Kora." The gang sayings, which means opposition or rebellion of Kora, Core rebelled against Moses and Aaron. Not just Moses, but Aaron as well. Brother Brandham is represented by Moses. Aaron represents the five-fold ministry because Aaron had five sons and that represents the five-fold ministry. So according to brother Brandham, whoever says the five-fold ministries failed and invades the pulpit, in this case with tape players is the modern-day Kora that fulfills Jude 1:1. Woe unto them for they've gone in the way of Cain and ran greedily after the heir of Balum for reward and perish in the gang saying of Kora. So brother Ram says this prophecy means someone is telling others that the five-fold ministry has failed. That could only be Brandham tabernacle. And which church is one of the richest churches in the world in the message? Brennan tabernacle. So the Bible calls it greedily after the heir of Balum and Kora. The rebellion of Kora. And again, that's not me saying that. That's brother Brandham saying that in the church age book. If you don't think this is true, just listen to this. All over the world in both Pentecostal and fundamental groups, they are organizing the businessmen. They have invaded the pulpit without a call from God. They have styled themselves the fishers of men and the founders of a move of God. And they say the gifted ministry of Ephesians 4:10-13. But God gave the church has failed. So they are taking over. Here we are right in the midst of the fulfillment of prophecy called the gain sayings of Kora. And they don't even know that they have fulfilled it. They are blindly going on preaching experience for truth. May God have pity on them. May their eyes be opened before it is too late. Oh, listen to me. When did the prestige of money, social leadership, business ability, or sheer mental prowess ever qualify a man for spiritual leadership, or give any weight to the word of God. And when in any way materiality or human values begin to show as the media by which God works instead of the Holy Spirit alone, then we are fighting against God, not for him. &gt;&gt; Let's continue reading. quote, "May God have pity on them. May their eyes be open before it's too late. Oh, listen to me." End quote. So again, we want to pray at the end of this video uh that God will have pity on these people who say the five-fold ministries failed and the ones who are invading the pulpits with their tape players. Let's keep reading. Quote, "When did the prestige of money, social leadership, business ability, or sheer mental prowess ever qualify man for spiritual leadership or give any weight to the word of God? And when in any way materially or human values begin to show as the media by which God works instead of the Holy Spirit alone, then we are fighting against God, not for him. End quote. So see friends, the tape church ministry is fighting against God, not for God. They're the ones saying the five-fold ministry has failed. &gt;&gt; For in every age, the leoty and the clergy goes astray. And no doubt Voice of God and Random Tabernacle put out great quality products. But just because they have the prestige of money and business ability doesn't mean they can invade the pulpit, which they have done and continue to do around the world by telling preachers to sit down and just press play. Let's continue on this quote here. Let's continue on the quote a little bit further down. quote, "But when you see a social or financial structure come into the church that divides the folks in any way, that is not of God." End quote. So, Brandham Tabernacle has divided the folks because they don't gather more as they see that day approaching. Remember, divide in any way. So, notice Brandom Tabernacle has divided them away from the five-fold ministry and now even divided the members of Brandom Tabernacle away from each other. Let's keep reading. quote, "It is another sign of the time in this physically rich but spiritually impoverished Leodysian age which we are now living." End quote. We'll skip down a little further here. Quote, "Yes, it is the rich, powerful organization that has the wealth and always pushes out the little people that serve God." End quote. So, which organization is rich and powerful? It's Brandham Tabernacle. And see how they're always pushing out the little preachers that serve God? I've seen it of course when I went to South America and it continues to go around the world. Voice of God and other tape boys will come into little churches and convince the pastor just to sit down and press play. And that's what brother Brandham said the antichrist spirit is doing. Brother Ram says, quote, "The little flock always loses out to the big organization." End quote. That's true. Some little flocks might lose out, but the true little flock, the true bride of Jesus Christ will not lose out. They'll stay with the word of God because they have the restored word and the restored power of the Holy Ghost. Let's look at a third quote now from the church age book. I thought it went well with this topic. This is page 125 in the old blue book. Quote, "But when the church itself destroyed the word of God, it was tantamount to premeditated murder. There is your hybrid religion. Wake up America before it's too late. When the church gets away from the word, it will believe anything. It is like Eve." End quote. Now, I just bring out this quote to show how the tape church movement is a hybrid religion and they will believe anything that their pastor says or associate pastor says because they've gotten away from the word of God many scriptures, not just the five-fold ministry scriptures in Ephesians 4. And brother Bram goes on to quote 2 Timothy 4:4. And they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned unto fables. And I mentioned this in a previous video, but tape boys will believe anything their false leadership says, no matter how much of a fable it is. Remember, there's 25 lies coming out of current Brandom Tabernacle. So, they'll believe all these 25 lies or 25 fables. Like the first one saying every word on Brother Ram's tapes are thus sayith the Lord. That's a fable. They say the tapes can never be wrong. That's a fable. They say the tapes have no mistakes. That's a fable. When brother Ram plainly said there are mixups on the tapes, they believe the fable of just unquestioning believe every word on the tape. Even if brother Brandham lied. That's according to Joseph Brandham, not me. He said, "I don't care if it's a barefaced lie. We're still going to believe every word on tape." &gt;&gt; What did that angel of the Lord say? Get the people to believe you. So when they're trying to make you doubt, well, the prophet didn't say this and didn't say this, and he made a mistake here, made a mistake here. I don't care if it's a barefaced lie. The world can prove it. I believe it. I don't care if it's a barefaced lie. The world can prove it. I believe it. &gt;&gt; The angel said, "Get the people believe WHAT YOU SAID." AMEN. We believe it. They believe the fable that tape boys are the true five-fold ministry. They believe the fable that brother Brandham's soul and spirit is identical to Jesus's. They believe the fable that brother Brandham's followers are the greatest of all time. They believe the fable that brother Brandham is the greatest prophet of all time and they don't say except for Jesus. They believe the fable that brother Brandham is their pastor even though brother Brandham's dead and said he won't always be their pastor. They believe the fable that they can sit at home and deny Hebrews 10:24 and 25 about gathering more physically as we see that day approaching. And those are just a few of the fables they'll believe. But notice once they get away from one scripture, they'll believe anything. They'll believe all these lies or fables. Let's do a fourth and final quote here from the church age book. It's just a simple principle here that woe to the man that declares an evidence that is not found in the word of God. Brother Ram's talking about how speaking in tongues is the evidence is not in the word. He says quote once more we're anxious to know where this is found in the word. If it isn't there then God has not spoken it and woe unto him who would add to that word. End quote. Remember Brandon Tabernacle says the tapes are the token. In other words, they're saying the tapes are the evidence of the Holy Ghost. They also say going to a tape church is the evidence of the Holy Ghost, which is a lie. Those are both lies. The token is the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the soul. It's the seal unto the day of redemption, as Hebrews 4:30 plainly teaches. And brother Ram taught repeatedly and faithfully throughout his entire ministry. So notice again, brother Ram says, "Woe to any man who makes an evidence other than what the Bible says." So that's what Brandham tabernacle has done. So woe unto them. They make a false evidence of the token. And again, where are all those fables found in the word of God? They're not found in the word of God. Never says God's going to stop having living preachers. It never says to sit at home and don't gather more as we see that day approaching. It never says dead men can be your living pastors on the earth. It never says brother Random is the angel of Revelation 22 because brother Ram teaches us there's no pre-existence of souls. So, brother Ram did not pre-exist in order to reveal the book of Revelation to St. John. That's a fable. That's a lie. So, we thank God for the truth in the church age book and again see plainly how Brennham Tabernacle has misconstrued it, twisted it to their own shame. In closing, friends, I hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God. This thought was quickened to me a few weeks ago and this morning after prayer and reading the Bible and the church age book, I thought I'd make a video on this. Hopefully, it strengthens the people's faith in the word of God. The church age book again is brother Ram's teaching and commentary. He called it his commentary on the church age book. And that points us back to the Bible. Let's not be the core group saying the five-fold ministry failed. Let's be the group that's with Moses and Aaron. Hallelujah. In type. Let's be with brother Brandham and the five-fold ministry. The way we know we are is if we obey the word of God rather than rebelling against the word of God. As brother Brandham said, this is very simple. Give everyone the word test. We must give Brennham Tabernacle, the current Brennham Tabernacle, the word test. And when we do, they fail the word test every time. Give &gt;&gt; it the word test. &gt;&gt; That's way to tell where it's right or wrong. &gt;&gt; That's just just give it the word test. &gt;&gt; See what it says about the word. Any spirit, see what it says about the word. If it denies the word, it's not of God. &gt;&gt; No matter what it is, if it denies the word, it's not of God. &gt;&gt; Look, give it the word test and see what happens. But that shouldn't surprise any true believer because they're businessmen. They're not preachers. If they were preachers, they would preach. They'd rightly divide the word of truth. So, as time goes on, friends, we see the evidence of the Holy Ghost. It's receiving the word of God for your day, being in the word all the way. Like brother Ram said in the church age book, it's another quote I don't have right in front of me, but he says, he said, they substitute experience instead of the word. So, see, they have these experiences. says, "Oh, I listen to all these tapes at home and I'm getting so close to God, yet they're denying all these scriptures." That's a lie. We're not taking experience over the word of God. The word of God is the absolute. The word of God will produce the right experience, an experience of obedience, an experience of holiness, righteousness, a pleasing testimony in the sight of God. So, we're thankful for that, friends. Please share this video with someone you know that might struggle with this topic. And we believe the Holy Ghost will guide the believers into all truth. When the spirit of truth has come, as Jesus said, he will teach you all things and guide you into all truth. That's the evidence of being a true holy ghostfilled believer. You can be taught the word of God by the spirit of God. For the spirit and the word of God are one. So, let's close with a prayer for current Brandham tabernacle. Dear God, I pray for the current Brennham tabernacle leadership. God, may they take warning from this if they see it. Lord God, we can see they have a cult mentality. They don't listen to anyone else except their pastor and the tapes, which means they won't accept correction. So Lord, I just pray their hearts would open. If they have true hearts, if they're hungry and thirsting for righteousness, they'll have a heart to hear this. And not just from me, but from anyone else who will speak the truth to them in love. Lord, you know this is done in love and brotherly kindness also as a warning. The Bible said them that sin, rebuke before all. And Lord Jesus, if you anointed Brother Brennham to warn those people out in Arizona in 1964 about their cult tendencies, Lord, you're the same yesterday, today, and forever. You'll anoint people to do it today. So God, be magnified, be glorified. We pray for repentance for this generation of the brand tabernacle. And Lord, we pray for a Hezekiahike revival where they'll open the church doors and let real preachers in to preach the gospel. Lord, let thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. If you have any questions, concerns or testimonies about this video, please contact me. God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart. Very happy to be here this afternoon and again in a defense of the gospel of Jesus Christ to bring the good tidings, the good news that Jesus raised from the dead, living among man today, his church. The same Jesus that was yesterday will be today and forever. He never failed.
