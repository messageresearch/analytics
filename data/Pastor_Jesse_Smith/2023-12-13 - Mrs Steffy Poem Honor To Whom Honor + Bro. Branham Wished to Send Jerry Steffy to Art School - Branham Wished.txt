TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and bless this little church and help me Lord as I go to bring the message to other people and may we together like one person one family stick together and pray together and live together in holy Unity of the Holy Spirit until Jesus receives us into the kingdom or we ask it in his name and for his glory amen time to interrupt you you sure can brother as a token of our appreciation and by the the work of a young man in our midst we present this picture to you brother Brandon with the full expression of our love and appreciation thank you brother nille Jerry stey that painted that picture brother Jerry stey painted that picture God bless that boy Hallelujah that's very fine Jerry if you're here this morning hallelujah it's too bad I wish I had the means to let that boy go to school for an artist I believe God is an art don't you God is in music God is in art God is in this and it's too bad to see a talent like that wouldn't be uh uh developed more he does the more developing it'll be and I I pray that God will bless you Jerry and thank you brother Neville into this church for this fine uh picture and for the verse that goes under it I'll read it Lou you want me to read it all right sir brother devil will read the verse amen I had an idea what he's not a man of stature tall nor lofty in his way he sounds himself no trumpet as he goes from day to day has no desire for wealth nor Fame but none his place could fail he's just the way we want him our own dear brother B he teaches us with faithfulness the undiluted word no fancy ways no love for praise just following the Lord amen his speech is soft and gentle he raises not his voice except to cry against the wrong and then he has no choice never got a lot of learning from Colleges and Schools but he knows what is important and he sure nobody's food for the knowledge he has given is eternal from above he has no Creed except our Christ no law but Sovereign Love there was no great announcement to his lowly humble birth but to us he's the greatest man who lives upon the Earth we count it more than privileged to know him as a friend we cherish all he stands for and will right to the end amen he says he's not a preacher he's modest as can be but get him in the pulpit and it isn't hard to see he was foreordained a Propet let men call it what they will God granted us great favor when he gave us brother Bill sign a little flock amen thank thank you for your thoughts who compose that I think his mother did that's I'm not worthy of those things of saying that but that's more to me than all the money in the world see s somebody regard you as his servant God may I ever live true to that is my prayer God ever bless you my thoughts will always be far you and I expressly love you too
