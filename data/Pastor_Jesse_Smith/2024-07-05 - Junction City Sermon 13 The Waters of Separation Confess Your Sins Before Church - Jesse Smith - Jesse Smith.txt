TRANSCRIPT
========================================
always so blessed to come here and see the Saints pressing on in the Lord and I love hearing testimonies brother irin Shar just a little testimony got to witness to somebody yesterday God opened a door there so thankful for the supernatural working of the Holy Spirit praise God Numbers Chapter 19 uh we'll read one two and then skip down to nine because I'll be preaching through uh the beginning of this chapter here and uh really the whole chapter is beautiful it's a beautiful type um and I think you'll understand you know uh this basically is a type so this scripture in numbers 19 is a type or foreshadow uh of confessing our sins before we come into the presence of God before church we should confess our sins before we come into service right uh and really every day of our lives right if we want to feel the presence of God like brother Daniel's wonderful testimony there about wanting to feel the presence of God we all want to feel God's presence if we want to do that then uh we have to confess our sins and this is a beautiful type of that by God's grace so numbers uh 191 says and the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron saying this is the ordinance of the law which the Lord hath commanded saying speak on the children of Israel that they may bring I'm sorry that they bring thee a red heer without spot wherein is no blemish and upon which never came yoke and there's of course all these detailed requirements for the red heer but let's give down to verse 9 let's let's all read verse 9 if we can on three 1 2 3 and a man that is clean Shall Gather up the ashes of the hepher and lay them up without the camp in a clean place and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water of Separation it is a purification for sin so this red heer would be burnt the ashes would be mixed with water and then when someone was uh unclean they'd have to be sprinkled with this Waters of Separation before you could come back into the camp and even before you could go into the Tabernacle of worship so God set this up you had to be purified before you could come in worship how many believe he still feels that way God wants us to come purified Before the Throne of god let's have a word of prayer if you would let's just bow our hearts here as we approach the Lord father God we're thankful for tonight Lord we surrender all Lord we sing such wonderful songs here Lord as we come into your presence Hallelujah we surrender Our Lives God we surrender our thoughts Lord our actions God our our souls we surrender everything to you Lord God have your way tonight Lord God just use me to speak your word Lord even as last night Lord that we were uh visited by the Holy Spirit there in akan we thank you God for that Lord and dealing with or seeing you deal with Souls lord it's such a wonderful thing God we just ask that the same Holy Spirit Lord that was dealing with brother Irvin and uh witnessing last night and and with brother Daniel Lord last night and and there in akan last night Lord the same Holy Spirit that's been working will continue to work here tonight move tonight God for your glory Lord may you be glorified may you be magnified purify us Lord God that we can come into your presence and have fellowship with thee Lord so we'll be grateful we'll be happy when we leave this place thank you for the independence of the Holy Ghost Lord hallelujah thank you for our natural blessings as well we ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name and the Saints said amen amen God bless you as your being seated so I want to back up a little bit and um you know we were here last time two weeks ago and how many enjoyed the Millennium did everybody enjoy that okay well wonderful I want I just thought I'd show you some pictures now that I got the opportunity to so I like visuals I like to see it you know because then my mind can I can picture a little better of course a lot of us are visual Learners here in the 21st century right with all the technology and the screens so you know right after I left the lord gave me a great understanding it's it's very simple to tell which one which of the two events the Bible's talking about is it talking about the Millennium or is it talking about the future home and after I left I think it was the next day I I think I started studying this again and I preach it at our church a few days later and I just found these now there's more than three but I found three very easy attributes that distinguish the Millennium from the future home or the New Jerusalem okay so the Millennium is where we live on the earth in a glorified bodies as we looked at a few weeks ago and we rule over all the sinful people right that make it through the battle of Armageddon we rule over them and Jesus sets some over Nations some over cities so the very least you'll be over one city by God's grace that's at least according to the scripture uh the Christians will rule over at least one city and uh but we looked at that you know briefly last week or two weeks ago but remember Sinners there's still a curse during the Millennium there's still a curse not on us but it's on the Sinners they're still a curse if they get out of line they can be cursed the Bible says it we read it but in the New Jerusalem the Bible said there's no more curse all the curse is done away and brother this this struck me as I left last time CU we were talking about this in the Millennium Nations can be deceived they get deceived at the end at at the at at the end right they get deceived and remember Jesus will send a plague on them and cause no rain to fall if they don't come and worship in Jerusalem amen so there are nations can be deceived Nations can uh disobey Jesus but in the future home all the nations are healed right and then in the Millennium a child could die the Bible say 100 years old that's in Isaiah 6520 and the nations are killed at the end because Satan he goes out at after the Thousand Years remember he goes to the for four corners of the earth and he gathers all the people in against Jesus and us at New Jerusalem but fire comes down from heaven I'm sorry not New Jerusalem Jerusalem fire comes down and de devours all Satan's armies and all those people so there still is death in the Millennium but in the New Jerusalem the Bible said there's no more death all right so does that help by God's grace oh you can now you can just you can lay it in there perfectly you can just see W if you're wondering about the scripture it's got to meet whichever conditions it meets it's either Millennium or New Jerusalem Hallelujah that's the picture I drew last time I just have it up there for my sake but this was the one I was talking about in the Millennium it's ezekiel's Temple and just one side of this is 750 ft long and God puts the River of Life through there you can read this in Ezekiel vers or chapters 40 through 48 you can read all about it it's a beautiful uh a beautiful story and see all the nations you have to come in one of these three ways I like three that's a good number and when whatever way you whatever Court you come in you can't go out the same way and that's what we experience spiritually today when we come to church we never leave the same we actually leave differently we leave more in love with Jesus how many can say Amen to that it's in it's in Ezekiel if you read it you cannot leave the same way you came you have to leave a different gate and that's what we experience every service Hallelujah I left church last night closer to God than I was when I came Hallelujah I I left church last night more in love with Jesus than I was before Hallelujah Glory so you see all this and remember Jesus is there he'll be in the holies of holies and there'll be no Veil because remember the Bible said there'll be no Ark of the Covenant because the Lord is there Hallelujah we don't need an ark because the Son of God is there the presence of God is there in the body of Jesus Christ amen so that gives you the size here's the millennial Temple size here's a here's American football field now maybe you probably don't know may seen those too often but think about maybe you know 12 or 11 football fields can fit in one of these Millennial temples and this is right going to be right there in Jerusalem right for the Thousand Years okay there you can see herod's temple in the days of Jesus when Jesus walked the Earth that's the size Mo I'm sorry Moses Tabernacle uh maybe about three could fit in a football field and Solomon's Temple was about half maybe 2/3 of American football field there you get the size of it now the Ezekiel I'm sorry the millennial Temple is very small compared to the New Jerusalem the millennial Temple is only 750 ft wide but the New Jerusalem each side is 1,500 miles wide so there's no comparison this is this is what it would look like this is the size of the New Jerusalem brother said it goes from Maine to Florida that's just one of the New Jerusalem that's one side of it that's how long it is hallelujah amen and it's a pyramid Saints it's going up like this all the way up you're going up in the presence of God but your body never gets tired Hallelujah you can walk all those steps you you don't have to count your steps because it'll never matter you'll never get tired amen hallelujah and that's what it looks like I love this picture but remember you know uh this picture is not exactly accurate there's no more sea in the in the New Jerusalem there's no more sea and there might be lakes and RI no no doubt there's Rivers uh but there's no more sea so I'm not sure maybe those are lakes I don't know about the I don't I didn't talk to the artist who drew that picture but that's the size of the New Jerusalem and the Bible says it's going to come down right there this is 1,500 miles and that's right that's the exact location Hallelujah of where the New Jerusalem is going to be like that one okay it's going to be right there over uh Jerusalem because that's the city of God that's mzc City king of Salem king of Jerusalem king of righteousness king of Peace hallelujah amen that's God's holy place we sing that song great is the Lord and greatly to be praised from the song the city of the great king hallelujah amen the New Jerusalem and this is Clarence larin's drawing of it so this is 1,500 miles long there's three gates on every side that says Gad Reuben and uh Simeon and look here's the River of Life flowing down here and these are all little these are all Mansions the Bible said Jesus went to prepare you one of those Mansions so these are all these houses going up there and there's no need of a temple because Jesus Christ is the temple hallelujah amen there's no need of the sun because the lamb is the light thereof Hallelujah God and man become one this is this is the bride City this is after the Millennium this is in the New Jerusalem that's where we live with Christ hallelujah how many looking forward to that amen God's called you to it amen he's called you he's revealed it to you praise God all these false churches are preaching all the false Doctrine and the Bible says that they can't they're not born again they're lovers of Pleasures more than lovers of God but this is for the city that loves God Hallelujah the people that live there love Jesus Hallelujah and they're washed By the Waters of the word all right now let's get to this message here tonight that's just a brief little review there so you got some visuals now is that all clear by God's grace hopefully hopefully you got the Millennium now I'll preach on the New Jerusalem later this summer by God's grace okay we'll try to do that now our text was numbers 19 now the Waters of separation would happen outside of this is Moses's Tabernacle it has to happen out here you know people like let's say somebody would die in their tent well before they come to worship and as soon as that happened they had to get a priest these are women they'd have to get a priest and go sprinkle that tent and all the people in there because the death somehow you know with with infectious diseases and uh it it would spread right so they had to be cleaned physically and they had to be sprinkled to represented a spiritual cleansing as well but nobody if somebody let's say somebody died in in the tent and you were around that person when they died if you tried to go here they wouldn't let you in because you weren't clean you actually had to wait 7 days a whole week Hallelujah so you can be clean but if you didn't be clean the Bible said theyd cut you off so see before you came to worship you had to be clean all right and that's what this point of this message is about before you come to worship God you got to be clean Hallelujah and God made a way for you to be clean Hallelujah now I don't know if you ever seen this picture no this is how Israel would Camp whenever they would travel anybody see a certain shape in there of how they're how they're camped anybody see a cross in there Hallelujah imagine God looking down from heaven and how does God arrange his people God arranges his people looking down from heaven God sees the cross these are people of the Cross these are people trusting in the cross hallelujah amen there are lives are centered around the cross the word of God their entire makeup looks like a cross God has put Redemption right in their life right in the the order of where they camp and this is this is of course a father and son but if you read Numbers 22 remember Bao took balum up and he looked down he tried to curse him and Bam's like the Holy Spirit came on him said I can't curse him he said I see a unicorn these people are blessed they've got the pillar of fire they've got a prophet he said I can't I can't can't curse them I can only bless them Hallelujah this is what he saw amen he saw he couldn't see anything else God can't curse a people that's trusting in a blood sacrifice God can't curse someone who's trusting in a substitutionary sacrifice are trusting in his system for Redemption for forgiveness for purification Hallelujah for the anointing of the Holy Spirit hallelujah amen now if you study it real closely each one of these had a banner right the ox the eagle The Lion and the man how many familiar with that this was for and remember what was this based on this was all based on what was what Moses saw in heaven so this is the Throne of Jesus in heaven remember there was four there was four cherubims and they had the faces of those animals so Moses saw that in heaven and God said now you got to build that on Earth hallelujah amen glory got the 24 Elders around the throne you got uh the rainbow of Jesus Hallelujah you got the rainbow Covenant Around Jesus lightning and thunder is coming forth from there so Moses saw that pattern up in heaven and he created it or I'm sorry he recreated it on Earth Hallelujah then brother brand tells us these are anointings for the church age right this was the early church age this was the the martyrs this was the man age like Charles finny uh Martin Luther John Wesley but we're under the eagle age we're under under the prophet age by the grace of God hallelujah that's the anointing for today a prophetic Revelation no other church has thus say the Lord like we've got it no other Church understands the Book of Revelation like we understand it praise God the church ages the Seven Seals no other church has that praise God because God has that anointing poured out upon us hallelujah I just read a quote last night they asked brother brandom in 1964 brother raham can we join labor unions and brother Ram said yes as long as they don't you know make you sin or something he said but mark my words thus sayith the Lord one day that push to be in a union will come to religion right so I I work in a I used to work in a teachers union I got out of the union now because the Supreme Court said I could so that was good then now they're not going to send my $900 to the Democratic party amen that's that's all I got out of the dues anyway but you know I had to if I want to be a teacher I had to be in the union before right I had to go through that process brother Bram said thus sayith the Lord if one of these days days towards the end time towards the Rapture towards the squeeze time you're going to the churches are going have to join their Union or they can't have church and that's where brother man said they may shut our doors he said but the bride will keep having Church hallelujah amen we have to have it in houses right if if we live to that time we have to we have to have it somewhere by God's grace so we see that by the grace of God we're living under this prophetic anointing brother R could say thus sayth the Lord and we know it's going to happen by God's grace cuz it always came to pass Hallelujah now here's another picture of the Throne of God you got your 24 elders and here's the four beasts everybody see the four beasts there they got the ox the eagle uh the man the lion and then there's the man uh altar of incense got the Candlestick there's Jesus uh and the rainbow I can't see the Rainbow on this one oh yeah it's right here right there's the rainbow okay so Moses saw that and he recreated that on the earth praise God and now we know that those those cherub those four CH Chans are anointings of the Holy Ghost that we live under praise God Amen now I don't know how familiar this this is Moses Tabernacle R if you're pretty familiar with Moses Tabernacle okay so this is that this is the three parts this is the outer court that represents your body so Moses when he built that it was it was for Israel but it's actually speaking of what we would experience because now you're the temple of God Amen yeah this this this this room is a temple this is a place to worship thank God for our sisters open up their homes by God's grace but really you're the temple of God God wants to dwell in you now Hallelujah so see the outer Court had the Brazen altar uh the labor this and then the holy Place represents your spirit and mind but the Hol of holies represents your soul you got a body Spirit Soul everybody see that this is what God was telling Moses Moes Hallelujah God was tell and God was telling us why did God's Temple have three parts because we have three parts and I preach this I have to preach this again sometime but all three parts of your body are calling out feed me feed me all day David said my soul thirsts for the Living God hallelujah that's why you come to church tonight amen you come to church because your soul was saying feed me the word I need the word I need to worship I need the fellowship with the Saints I need more of God amen that's what David said my soul thirst after the Living God hallelujah and uh Ephesians 2 says you have the desires of the body and the mind right your body is all day saying well at least mine saying feed me give me some water give me some coffee you know you got to make sure you give it the right thing though by God's grace right your body saying feed me feed me give me this and your mind is also saying that let me think about something let me figure something out what what I got to work on now right what what uh what what job on the farm do I got to accomplish what do I got to get done see your mind's constantly saying feed me feed me something I can learn or something I can accomplish something I can do and this is what God was showing us that God dwells in a temple it's got three parts to it and God wants to fill all three parts hallelujah hallelujah I tell you being a church like this being a church service like this you got a good opportunity to have all three parts filled with the Holy Ghost amen cu the Bible said when you're gathered in one place with one Accord then the Holy Ghost can come Hallelujah that's right I'm glad our brother could feel it so see our brother fell it right right in here right he feels it in his body when he comes to church when you step in the room you can feel something's different here now at our service last night I didn't feel it to the very end Brothers you know you can you can watch my sermon on YouTube I'm not saying you have to but if you did you know you'd see me excited but it wasn't to the very end till the Holy Ghost fell and I really could feel it you know so the whole service I'm preaching about an hour and a half and I'm I'm just saying Lord you know in my mind I'm like Lord am I preaching the right thing that you know I'm not getting a lot of amens and I'm not seeing any shouting or Screaming going on and so I'm wondering you know am I Lord did I did I miss your mind you know that but then after we close somebody come up for prayer and we come up for prayer the Holy Ghost fell and people started weeping and I was weeping and praying and crying and everything and we're praying for deliverance right there Hallelujah so see but you know the whole time I'm preaching I got the holy ghost in my soul I know this word is right people are saying amen so you know they're thinking about the word of God right so I had the anointing here here but I didn't feel it to the very end I sure like to feel it praise God I don't have to feel it brother John but I sure like to feel it hallelujah amen glory amen now also so us the first application is that represents your body soul and mind but it also represents justification how many know that there's only three works of Grace there's not four there's only three justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's what those three offices I'm sorry those three locations represent Hallelujah does that make sense everybody right we all know people that they just got saved right but they're not really into the holy place and we know they're not living in God's presence right they just got saved they just got the blood Jesus's cross the water the water baptism Hallelujah and then you get up in here you got candlesticks uh that's light that represents the knowledge of the church ages right the bread represents the word of God uh the Mysteries that's what I wrote my book on that's my 12 New Testament Mysteries there's 12 pieces of bread there and brother R said we're feeding on that shoe bread of the word of God and then the inset represents prayer you got to have prayer before you go in the presence of God and the presence of God got the law the Bible said God's going to write the law upon the fleshly tables of your soul Hallelujah the Mana is in there the fresh word in other words there's there's an eternal word there's an eternal I'm sorry that's the seed man is the seed it's called the coriander seed it's the seed of God you're born again of The Incorruptible seed of God the word of God hallelujah oh my and then the rod it was Aaron's Rod that buted that was death to life that was Resurrection so it's your soul that's been resurrected resed your body's getting old I'm getting gray hair I got Grays on over here my my body hasn't been resurrected but my soul's resurrected my soul was dead but now it's alive Hallelujah we were dead in sins and trespasses but now we've been quickened by the holy spirit amen we've got Aaron's rod in our souls hallelujah oh my this is good Hallelujah I love this this is always one of my favorite messages to preach I preach this everywhere I've gone by God's grace but see remember you have three parts you have a body and I'm going fast on this cuz it's more review it's just more a visual so you can see it hopefully this will help somebody tonight I don't know what's uh going on with my circles there I don't remember the order I got here okay oops well let me just zoom in there okay so can everybody see that you got the three parts you got the body which is the outer Court you got the human spirit the mind I just made it a little bigger cuz I want the circles to get smaller as you go and then the Sol of of man the soul body Spirit Soul everybody say amen amen all right now this is just another view of it this is what I was talking about earlier now what's what's different here is the you got to have Waters of Separation before you can even get in here that's what numbers 19 is all about you can't even be a worshipper Glory until you've got the Waters of Separation sprinkled on you Hallelujah you can't even come to church you can't even get close to God's presence until you've been sprinkled with the Waters of Separation this was a great revelation to me brother I tell you this is this made me shout made me cry dance this is beautiful so in other words first you got to have like a First Act of repentance right and then you get baptized in water but you first got to come into the court why do you why did y'all want to get baptized because you first repented of your sins you didn't want to be under the fear of man amen say God forgive me I want to be free I want to be a real believer hallelujah praise God so see that's what this means you have to have the waters separation first outside the the court and then you come in you represent you see Jesus's blood sacrifice the substitutionary death that's justification water baptism then you come into sanctification this is uh sanctification by knowledge the word and prayer knowledge is the light because the Bible says light is knowledge in the New Testament second Corinthians and then the word is the bread and the prayer and that brings you into the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that's what brother R was preaching in this sermon the basis of Fellowship brother says you don't talk to God necessarily out here the Bible says you he he would talk to Aaron Above The Mercy Seat amen hallelujah hallelujah that's where Fellowship brother that's the point of brother's sermon is that you have Fellowship in the holies of holies in other words your most intimate Fellowship is when you're born again Hallelujah then you can really have fellowship with the word of God you can really worship God you can really talk to God when you're born again Hallelujah see then nobody can talk you out of there because you've talked to God about it you've talked to the word you've looked at the word you know what the word says hallelujah oh my Hallelujah now those are more of the types I've already mentioned I can I can send this to you if you want so if you want to write it down if you want to go listen to the sermon it's the basis of Fellowship 1961 and brother Brandon preaches this I'm going to skip some things here uh brother Brandon preached this and there was a Jewish rabbi sitting there this is and this is what he tells in Bas of Fellowship here not long ago I was speaking on this at a fellowship meeting and one of the great rabbis United States met me back behind back there and said I've never heard that like that in my life he's talking about the three courts of the Tabernacle and how it's justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost he said I've been a rabbi and come from a generation of rabbis Rabbi after Rabbi after Rabbi and now he's a Pentecostal Rabbi with the baptism of the Holy Ghost oh my so just showing him just showing him the reality of this showing him the reality of this what it means for us it made this Jew convert to Christianity CU he saw Jesus Jesus's death is here and then he saw the water baptism of Jesus he saw the word the church ages the prayer and then he saw the presence of God and he got the Holy Ghost all because of this sermon Hallelujah this sermon will take you into the presence of God hallelujah because you got to be sprinkled first and confess those sins before you come into the presence of God and then church it tells us to do it every day we learn from this confess your sins every day so you can enjoy the presence of God in your home in your vehicle even after a funeral service amen or at a funeral service amen the presence of God can come around you all the time because you're walking the under the spring you're walking under the purification of the holy spirit in your life amen like our sister said last time I love that testimony sister Ruth how you can minister to the uh the young people there while you're giving them meals and write them you that's the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit can come into a certain place where you might not expect it and it can heal somebody and they'll Testify the next day amen hallelujah what is that it's a sister that's walking in the purification of the she's purified so she's having fellowship with the Lord and the Lord tells her you go pray for this person or send this person a card amen give them a card and the Holy Spirit Will begin dealing with them how does how do we know how to do these things because we're led by the Holy Spirit we're having fellowship with the holy spirit amen all right y'all y'all enjoying this now I want to say this brother the brother hit it brother Daniel you hit it right on the head you said we got to confess our sins right this is part of my notes so when we're battling Devils will not move until they're exposed am so see when we have you know what mind battles or or lust of the eyes lust of Flesh pride of life if there's any sin in there that that that that condemnation won't leave until we confess it to somebody or at least to God right if you didn't sin against somebody then all you got to do is confess it to God and then you have to hate your sin right you have to hate it brother man said uh the some people that would say demon possessed it's because they worship that Spirit they love to feel lust or they love to feel depressed they want the pity of of people right they love that Spirit but you the Bible said you've got to hate even the spotting of the Garment of the Flesh in Jude the Bible says You must hate your sin so you must hate your sin what's bothering you you must confess it and then when that happens it's as if you're being sprinkled by the anointing of the Holy Ghost and now you're clean Hallelujah and now that Spirit has to go hallelujah it's like what Jesus said in Matthew 12 no man can spoil a house except he binds up the strong man right who's going to get in your house the only way they're going to get is if they bind you up because you're the strong man and that's what Jesus is saying with your mind the only way the devil can get in your mind is if you let the word of God get bound up and you don't let the word of God rule over your mind is that the church said but if you expose if you call on Jesus and say Jesus I'm I don't want to be bound up anymore amen I don't want to be living in sin I don't I don't want this feeling anymore I forgive me I I let the wrong person in forgive me come rescue me come save me you know Jesus is the savior Hallelujah not just of the body but he's savior of the Soul he's savior of the human mind Jehovah is our Salvation that's the meaning of Jesus Hallelujah and Jesus will come and set us free in the sometimes the prison of our mind sometimes because we all struggle right we all struggle remember the time brother raham lied to the IRS he said there was so much going on he had so many meetings with lawyers he said his head was swimming right ever feel like that you get so busy your head swims and here's a man who he's got the Holy Ghost in his soul right but then he gets a call and he says tell them I'm not here and he has his wife lie to the IRS and then he tries to pray for a baby and the Holy Spirit said don't put your lying hands on that baby before you repent of that he's like okay wait right here I got to go apologize he called the IRS back and said forgive me I was under stress I lied to you and I called I caused my wife to lie and these IRS guys said wow I think more of you now than I did before see when we can humble ourselves and admit our wrongs people will think more of us because you know why they're hiding their sins and they know you're you're not they've got demons that are not exposed but you've exposed the demons so they'll think more of you and the church said don't feel bad to go confess to somebody that that will prove to them God's working in your life think of how many demons they're hiding in their Liv especially these churches that have evil spirits and attack us and say all kind kinds of things against us oh the Holy Ghost is preaching tonight amen hallelujah but you go and you you can you make make that right by God's grace confess your wrongs and God will honor you he that humbles himself what will happen God will exalt you that's what happened to brother brandom and how many believe brother brand had the Holy Ghost for sure but where where where was the trouble right here in his mind not the soul the soul was good the soul was sealed to the day of redemption but all the stress up here caused even his body to say I got to get away from this problem caus him to lie but he made it right by the grace of God hallelujah and just I just want to share this too maybe some of people are battling spirits tonight but even if you're not remember this for somebody else uh we you know we uh Faith Works by love right the Bible said Faith Works by love so when we're living by faith we're actually living in love we we're we're loving Jesus we're worshiping Jesus the we should be but here are some of the quotes from brother Brandon brother BR said unbelief is the chief of all Devils right people that won't believe they won't believe that's the chief of all demons that's what brother R says now brother I like this one the religious devil is the worst demon to deal with Pharisees Sadducees herodians right that's the worst demon right Jesus had to turn like Jesus would meet with the publicans I'm sorry Jesus would meet with the uh the tax collectors and and the prostitutes he would save them but he couldn't get those Pharisees that move an inch is that right so what that's a spirit of Pride right that's a prideful Spirit a religious spirit is a prideful Spirit pride is exalting yourself above the word of God now brother man said this now listen nervous anybody ever get stressed out you don't raise your hand unless you want I do brother said nervous that this this demon the stress demon is the worst feeling anyone could have I got threatened uh a few months ago and it my stomach was just ch churning for weeks I got a threat and Simon had warned me he didn't know what he was doing but Simon was trying to warn me the Holy Ghost was trying to warn me that a threat was coming and my stomach churned for weeks and I can say Amen to that the evil spirit of nervousness and stress is one of the worst feelings anyone could live with like that's why Satan wants to make us un certain about the next job or what's going to happen at the presidential election like he loves to take these what ifs but the Bible said cast down any imagination that exalts itself against the word of God hallelujah so see we can't live under stress we got to cast those things down any nervous feelings we got to cast it down and say Jesus will take care of me Jesus will help me and then you'll feel good again by the grace of God and brother said the spirit of fear remember second Timothy says uh 2 Timothy 1:7 says God has not given you the spirit of fear brother said fear accompanies doubt so when you start doubting things fear Creeps in it's like two demons right doubt and fear kind of work start working brother man said fear is the greatest thing against the church today isn't that something right fear I I'm talking about us the people that love God that believe they got the Holy Ghost the the biggest challenge for us is fear right we're afraid what's going to happen we're afraid about this afraid should I do this I'm afraid right but see we can overcome all these things as the Bible said God's not giv us a spirit of fear what has God given us he's given us what power love and a ah you're good Bible Church here hallelujah you know the Bible so you you you don't have to accept fear you don't have to accept nervousness you can say I cast that down because God is not giving that to me amen you can say God sprinkle me from this fear sprinkle me from this nervous sprinkle me from this religious spirit or whatever it may be sprinkle me from this uh pride and lust or whatever may be sprinkle me from that I want to be clean all right good just thought I'm laying this in there now that's that's my closing right there so I got to jump ahead now now uh let's go to numbers 1910 I sure did I'm at 35 minutes okay so maybe give me about 30 more minutes by God's grace maybe I I could preach two parts on this we'll see I got so many things I want to preach to you but just I'm trying to follow the leading of the Holy Spirit I like to preach on the future home and uh teach to you the word of God hallelujah these are important years you know you look back on these years and you'll say wow I wish I could go back to those years because that's what I feel I wish I could go back to when I first came in the message and I got to hear them for the first time it was such a wonderful feeling Hallelujah numbers 1910 now we read uh 199 now verse 10 says and he that gathereth the ashes of the heer shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the even and it shall be unto the children of Israel and see this and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them for a statute forever so this cleansing is for all Jews and any stranger anyone who comes to live in this camp that cross Camp I showed you amen anyone that comes to live they have to be clean By the Waters of Separation they got to be sprinkled or else the will be defiled by sin and of course infectious disease as well so there's multiple there's a couple reasons for this so notice this was for in other words new Believers but it's for experienced Believers as well and of course I'm using this for us we need the sprinkling of the Holy Ghost new Believers but also experienced Believers I've been preaching 20 years I still need the sprinkl of the Holy Ghost to purify me because I get dirty just like anybody else Hallelujah all right so that that's why this is important now while you're there let's um yeah that was the verse yeah and notice here's what brother says now this is also if you also want to listen to the water separation 55 it's the same topic he said oh what a beautiful picture that separation the Waters of Separation separated the guilty and made them holy and brought them back into Fellowship again so that's why this message is so important if you ever feel like God I'm not really talking to you I feel like I'm so far from you you need this message because this message will bring you back into fellowship with God hallelujah he says the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all unrighteousness and makes us holy and puts us back into Fellowship again with the father see beautiful isn't it Hallelujah now if you got your Bible verses 2 and three speaks of a red heer now brother R said in this red heer brother Ram said this red heer was pointing to Christ so this red heer in the Bible is isn't a heer a girl is that right okay sometimes I get those mixed up I'm not a farmer brother so you forgive me I was not raised on a farm I was raised in the city but brother R says the red heer a female cow represents Christ why because God has both man male and female attributes right he has dominant attributes and he has recessive attributes right because everything came out of him now I don't know if you saw this but remember last year there was a uh a Christian in Texas and he sent five red heers over to Israel you remember that one of them one of them is disqualified now it's not clean enough they're down to four so they're down to four and so Israel has to have one of these in order to set up its new Temple that's why some people think the Rapture is going to be pretty soon because now they haven't had these red heers for over a thousand years I mean they haven't because they 2,000 years because they've been out of the land and now so conveniently the people are back and now they got a red heers but there's a short time to use them though because they get too old and there are certain laws so it may be a sign maybe not but notice notice this this red he heph had have no blemish and that's what the Bible said Jesus was without and no blemish there never came a yoke upon this red heer and brother man said Jesus wasn't Yol to any denomination he wasn't a Pharisee he wasn't a sadducee he didn't come out of them he came out of God Amen he didn't come out of the Sanhedrin he came out of the mind of God hallelujah because he was God Amen and he had to be sacrif I'm sorry the red heer had to be killed outside of the camp and that's what the Bible says they took Jesus out of Jerusalem and crucified him without the camp Oh hallelujah amen well man said Christ was not yolk with any organization now here's a picture of Solomon this is some artist rendition so there there's Jerusalem right and there's the temple there's the holiest of holies during the days of Salon this is what they imagined you know Salon had so much money he built this like this beautiful you know white path maybe porcelain path and this is where they' kill the red effort it had to be outside the camp right and remember Jesus was crucified outside of the courts right and there's a hiss up there's a hiss up and everything like that now we'll get to this here now and then the Bible said they had to sprinkle it seven times let me read that here yes in verse four numbers 194 and alas of the priest shall take of her blood with his finger and sprinkle of her blood directly before the Tabernacle of the congregation seven times so elzar took the blood and he had to take the blood he sprinkled it once 2 3 4 5 6 7 brother Ram said what does that represent he says that seven Stripes meant the seven Church ages he said at every age had to be represented by Blood nothing else no other way Hallelujah so look at that the same blood that was sprinkled for Ephesus was sprinkled for samna right Sardis thyra Philadelphia and leoda amen in other words the same blood that we're under the blood of Jesus is the blood that was St Paul was under Hallelujah Paul irius Martin Columba Luther Wesley brother random every Church age Messer was under the same blood it's the blood of Jesus Christ in other words the blood of Jesus Christ is sufficient sisters for today it's just as sufficient today as it was 2,000 years ago amen hallelujah if the blood saved them at the beginning of the church age the same blood will save us at the end of the church age that's what brother man teaches as a type oh I love it amen and it was a once and for all sacrific this red heer they only needed one sacrifice and Jesus only had to die one time Hallelujah so there is blood even for Leo deia because there are seven sprinklings every Church age is under the same blood Hallelujah of course that represents the seven spirits of God life spirit is life and the life is the blood and then in verses we're not going to read these because I want to get to the end in numbers 19 5-10 it had to be burnt you had to burn the red heer then you had to mix the ashes with water and then the people could be cleansed and Israel had to keep this water with the ashes and mixed up this watery ashes they had to keep this for long periods of time uh one historian said it one heer all those ashes would last for a 100 years so that this would last your lifetime in other words the uh the Water the Waters of cleansing the blood would never lose its power during your lifetime Hallelujah that's showing that the blood of Jesus Christ will never lose its power Hallelujah as long as you're alive there's purification for you amen as long as you're alive there's blood for you Hallelujah as long as you're trying to serve God God will a way he can cleanse you Hallelujah and make you whole and allow you to come back into fellowship with him oh thank the Lord amen oh yeah brother says when they killed it they had to have Scarlet there was they burned Scarlet hup and was put together he says and those three Scarlet his up in the water represented justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost so brother pulls out all these types seven Church ages three things had to be mixed the three works of Grace he's pulling out all these types to show everything pointed to Jesus Christ amen no yoke right no no denomination outside the camp Jesus crucified outside of Jerusalem hallelujah oh it's beautiful so wood his up and Scarlet represents justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost oh my now here's where we want to get to because this is going to be important for you and I if Israel touched any dead body they had to be required to be cleansed other words you couldn't have death on you and try to come worship God now you got to see the spiritual we got to see the spiritual type here am in fact you were cut off from the the whole camp that whole cross Camp amen you were cut off if you didn't get cleansed from your deadness all right that's numbers uh 1913 and 20 let's I'm going to read 13 whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead and purifieth not himself defileth the tabernac of the Lord and that Soul shall be cut off from Israel because the water of Separation was not sprinkled upon him he shall be unclean his uncleanness is yet upon him all right now verse 20 but the man that shall be unclean and shall not purify himself that Soul shall be cut off from among the congregation because he have defiled the sanctuary of the Lord the water separation ha not been sprinkled upon him he is unclean can everybody see that everybody see that in other words God saying you can't worship you can't be a part of this church you can't have the experience of a worshipper you can't have fellowship with me unless you're clean when you get when you touch dead things you can't have fellowship with me if you're touching touching dead stuff if you're touching sins if you're playing around with sin you can't have fellowship with me and the church said amen that's what God is saying here hallelujah it's such a beautiful type look look look what God did God did all this to make us clean oh the red heer the seven sprinkles and the three things outside the camp God did all this so we could be clean and we could have fellowship with him Hallelujah and this is uh this is a beautiful type here now yeah now see this here let's look at verse 11 and he that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days he shall purify himself with it on the third day and on the seventh day he shall be clean but if he purify not himself the third day then the seventh day shall he be not clean now look you had to go through all seven days you I'll say like this there's no shortcuts with God some people say well I just got saved yesterday brother said I got saved yesterday and I want to preach tomorrow brother man said no you can't do that the Bible said lay hands on no man suddenly amen hallelujah what talk about the rock and roll guys they would sing rock and roll on a Saturday night and repent and then try to sing on Sunday morning at church brother said you can't do that lay hands on no man subtly see because because cleaning out is a process so see if you miss if you miss the sprinkling on you had to get sprinkled on day one if you miss the sprinkling on day three you got to start all over again so you have to thoroughly purge yourself in other words you got to be sincere about being clean I like this too you got to come and be fed the word of God you got to come and enjoy the presence of God each time the doors are open I like that amen you got to come to church every time the church doors are open and the church said amen hallelujah brother Ram said if you love God he said they can't chain you out of coming to church he said they can't fence you out let me see if I have that quote right in front of me did I have it saved yeah is that too small he says now if you love God you couldn't they couldn't wire you away from church they couldn't chain you away from it they can't hide a Believer from God hallelujah and see church people let all these things make a miss church shame on them they're missing coming into fellowship with god brother man said if you love God you want to be with God's people hallelujah and brother that's what I've seen over the years brothers that's what I've seen people that their first thing they do is they start missing church and then pretty soon they fall away if they don't repent of that because they they've been touching dead things and then God God will cut them off from the church and that's my prayer brother Daniel that's my prayer brother Howard my prayer is God only let people come here that are clean in other words we don't want leaven in our church we don't want people sleeping around and doing drugs God if they're not going to repent keep them out of the church we we just want people that are clean here hallelujah now this is the place to be clean like somebody that's maybe unconfessed yeah come and sit but repent at the end of the service praise God you understand what I'm saying I've also I preach this also and some people have said well well I didn't want to come tonight because I i' had fallen short no if you fell short come here and confess it don't stay away from God's house it ain't G to help you staying at home you're missing out on Fellowship praise God you're missing on the the purification of the word of God hallelujah I've seen too much in church services to want to miss church Hallelujah I've seen the supernatural people healed in tongues interpretation and miracles people getting uh victory over generational curses and and so much joy and victory I've seen so much in church I never want to miss church because I never know when God's going to move amen and I don't want to miss it when he does Amen a few years ago brother I could count it on one hand how many times I missed Church in my entire life as a pastor I think I'm I'm up to three or four in 18 years of pastoring I think I've only missed four or five Services where I was sick and I hope it stays that way I hope I don't get to two hands by God's grace I hope I can always count them on one hand by God's grace so I'm trusting God to purify me amen so this is a this is for us in the New Testament now today in the New Testament people are cut off from the spiritual effects of the Holy Ghost they're dull of hearing due to the hard hearts and the griev of the Holy Spirit they cannot experience the joy of worship because they're cut off due to their sin yet they can sit in church now I'm going to check my slides I got a lot of slides this turned into a very long sermon I'm just going to go back up here and then I'm going to try to bring this down to close I'm already at 51 minutes and I I told you I don't want to wear you out and I don't I I really don't so here's the whole point of this just to summarize it I'm giving you the short version and I can preach more if you want later by God's grace here's how I brought it to other churches as well as a pastor as if you if you've attended church any any any amount of time you see people that come to church but they don't get anything out of it and in my mind brother for Years brother irin I'd wonder how can these people come here they don't pray they don't shout they don't scream they don't cry they don't speak in tongues they don't pray for the sick they just sit there with their arms folded and look like they're mad all the time like how can people do that what kind I mean and then they don't want to talk to people after the service or if they do talk they don't want to talk about God I'm like how how can they come here and not be impacted and I wonder that for years and then the Revelation came of this they are here those people are here physically but God spiritually won't let them into fellowship with him because they're defiled everybody cat you how can we come to church and we love God and we'll cry and we'll weep and we'll rejoice and we'll praise God we we know God's talking to us but other people can sit right there and be like they've chewed their nails so long I don't even know how they have any nails left and sometimes I want to say can I try by to that that looks pretty good I'm just joking brother brother Brooks gave me that joke one time I was chewing my nails he said that looks good could I have a about of that I'm like man that guy's been eating his uh nails so long I don't even know how he has any nails left instead of shouting amen he's like focusing on that's that's really good you're eating the wrong thing brother amen you should be eating on the word of God hallelujah you should be digesting brother said digest the word of God chew on that word again hallelujah amen but I wonder for years as a pastor actually yeah I started pastoring in 2006 so this Revelation came in 2017 or 2016 so for 10 years brother I wondered why in the world how can people come to church and they they're never happy you never see them smile you never see them praying on their knees you you never see them come up for prayer and then the revelation of this struck me it's because they've been handling dead things in their life and when they come to church God will not accept their Fellowship because they're disobeying the word of God and the church said Hallelujah but this is what I found Saints I found this if I confess all my sins before I come to church then the Holy Ghost will let me into the outer court and I'll come in there sister Sarah and I'll see Jesus Christ sacrificed for my sins and it will mean something to me it's different for other people you preach about Jesus they just sit there like it don't mean nothing to them how can it mean nothing to them because they've got theyve touched dead things and they're not even spiritually here do you understand what I'm saying I've seen some animals die you know from getting ran over on the road I had to bury some my cats and things like that it's a sad thing I wept and cried but can you imagine if your lamb or your uh uh whatever uh the pigeon what's the other one the heer you sacrifice one of your calves and this is one of your dear calfs in the old I'm talking about the Old Testament you would you know your children would cry seeing that lamb die that means so much to you but that that paid for your sins and you'd cry and say oh God thank you for forgiving me but it's heartbreaking and then we come to church and someone preach on Jesus and you don't cry about it it don't mean nothing to you what's happened the spirit of God has been grieved Hallelujah I'm talking about your first love you you and I need to have our first love the cross of Jesus means to it has to mean something to us it has to move us Jesus died to forgive my sins that ought to make me happy that ought to make me thankful that ought to make me want to go out and serve others and give my life as a s as a sacrifice or offering for somebody else and the church said hallelujah how can the cross not mean something to people brother how can you preach on the blood and don't move people it's because they've let sin in their lives somewhere and I'm not saying you cry every service I'm just saying you know when they's sin in your life you know I know so people will come to church and they they get no fellowship with God because they have unconfessed sins and then the water the this is the labor where the priest would wash their hands right after killing the sacrifice that represents water baptism people don't get excited we just have three people baptized a few weeks ago I was excited Hallelujah I was rejoicing one of the sisters was crying before she was crying right after the baptism I thought there's a real sincere believer right there amen hallelujah see but you know some people if they got sin their life oh someone's baptized I can't make it I can't make it to the baptism oh big deal it don't mean nothing to them anymore because they're spiritually cut off from the fellowship everybody understand isn't this a isn't this a beautiful type this will make a Jewish rabbi into a holy ghost Rabbi amen I know Jesus said don't call any man Rabbi I know that but brother I called him Rabbi you know just it's just a title it's not like a master or God or Lord you know it's not like something serious like that and see then people come to church and you know they're not moved by the seven Church ages those seven candlesticks right there seven fingers those seven cands the church ages don't move them and all those promises to the Overcomer in the church ages man that ought to move us praise God and brother said your life is depicted in the seven candlesticks do you realize that your life in other words you are one of those Wicks and your Wick is dipped into the oil oil and there's another Wick that the world sees you are dipped into the oil of God you're feeding on the oil of God you're pulling from the Holy Ghost on one side and you're a burning light to everybody else oh my Hallelujah the Bible said you're rooted and grounded in Christ Hallelujah I'm getting excited amen when my voice goes up I get a little excited see a part of you your soul is drawing on the oil and then everybody sees your light shine amen you're like a city on a hill that cannot be hidden praise God brother said that's your life in the church ages and look you're on the same oil as all the other SE six Church ages you're feeding on the same oil Martin Luther was feeding on you're feeding on the same oil St Paul was feeding on Hallelujah because we got the same word of God and then the bread brother the bread is the Mysteries that fresh shoe bread there's 12 uh doctrines called Mysteries that's what I wrote the book on and you're feeding on the WRA brother you're feeding on the godhead he's only one person and the Bible said that bread never goes stale they had to switch it every week but and God switches it God gives you a fresh sermon every week hallelujah oh my it's beautiful it's a beautiful time amen and then what's the last thing what's the last thing before you're born again prayer how many know that you've been born again you had to pray before you got born again the altar of incense right the priest had to get the he got had to get a fire off there and he had to put it in the sensor that now the pope has one it's a it's a it's a false copycat right it's impostor but there's a real s there's a real there was a holy sensor right and the high priest had to get that on fire and he had to make all the incense go there in other words his prayers had to go into the presence of God and if he didn't go in there he died if he didn't have that sensor he died I'll say like this if you didn't and remember there was fire in that sensor so you got to have the fire of God when you pray you got to have some life when you pray you got to have the fire of God the church said you got to be praying in the spirit amen under sanctification glory and when you pray in the spirit that takes you into the presence of God hallelujah and then brother says in there it's just you and God Amen because God's in your soul now it's like you're going in there but God's actually coming in here in the soul and the church said amen see see that beautiful beautiful type brother man said this will make a Jewish man a holy ghost man Hallelujah I'm already at an hour so let me I'm going to close now by God's grace this is the shortest I ever preached on this yes okay now I'm closing how many know they're sprinkling the New Testament and it ain't for your I'm sorry ain't it's not for your water baptism sorry my grammar let's go to this one first there's only one time that the word sprinkle is used in the New Testament and it's not when John the Baptist John the Baptist didn't sprinkle anybody he took him down into the water Hallelujah Peter said you are elect remember election that's part of predestination remember that forign knowledge predestination election uh justification glorification remember that preach it a few about a month ago now the Five Points of predestination five steps you're chosen according to the four knowledge there it is four knowledge of God the father through sanctification that means separation sanctify sanctify means to separate right you clean something and you separate it you sanctify away from everything else so God takes you out of your for your old church your denomination and he separates you hallelujah or he separates you from your dirty habits or your old habits the way he used to live he sanctifies you he separates you unto what what does he take you to he takes you unto what now obedience and spring spr Ling of the blood of Jesus Christ and the church said amen the Jews couldn't even come worship God unless they were sprinkled first they couldn't even they couldn't go in the Holy I'm sorry the they couldn't even go to the outer Court unless they were sprinkled they couldn't even how how many know there's five Old Testament sacrifices did you know that the sin offering trespass meat offering I can never remember those last two there's five Old Testament sacrifices and the Jew could not give any of those unless they were first sprinkled or Anointed with God's purification now how many want to come to church and give God a sacrifice that he's pleased with I hope all hands would be up I hope all hearts are up Hallelujah the Bible said we're spiritual priests we offer spiritual sacrifice unto God giving God glory giving God thanks singing worshiping praising God uh giving food to the poor all these things helping out people those are all spiritual sacrifices that God rece receives all right you see when you repent when when you repent and you start obeying god let's say you're disobeying let's say you lied like brother Brandon as soon as you say God I'm sorry I'm going to go tell the person I'm sorry I lied you've just been sprinkled oh there it is amen hallelujah or if you're a husband you got to go say you got to tell your wife honey I'm sorry I did this as soon as you say sorry you're sprinkled with the anointing you're you're forgiven and the church said everybody understand now when you finally obey and you confess your sin you confess your wrong and you go back and you make it right you're sprinkled with a fresh anointing amen hallelujah you got a fresh anointing and then when you go into worship you can enter all the way in into fellowship with God Almighty then the cross means something then the water of washing and Water by the word then it means something then prayer can be effective then the church ages and the word of God feasting on the word and then prayer it means something because now you're sprinkled and you're separated from your past sins Hallelujah so now you know Church there is sprinkling in the New Testament Lord hallelujah everybody examining your life now everybody should be examining your life during this uh message by God's grace in other words you ask yourself am I having fellowship with God do I feel like I'm in Fellowship With God all it takes is obedience Lord for forgive me I'll go make this right or Lord forgive me I won't do that I'll separate myself from that I want to be sprinkled and I want to come back into fellowship with you that's how quickly God does it I'm glad church I'm glad brother Irv I'm glad I don't have to wait seven days till God will fellowship with me again that's how long they had to wait you had to wait seven days if something died in your home or is there some some infectious disease you had to be sprinkled on the first third and Seventh Day now you can go to church boy I I would not have liked living In Those Old Testament days I'm glad I got a blood that cleanses me right away by God's grace it brings me back into Fellowship praise God now this this verse should now take on a new meaning for all of us here tonight I believe this is my last verse Jesus says therefore if thou bringest thy gift to the altar now that was Old Testament but for us it's bringing our praise bringing our worship bringing our our amens Thanksgiving to the word of God and you remember your brother has something against you oh he my sister is upset with me my brother's upset with me I Sinn against them what did Jesus say did Jesus say just keep offering no he said before you come and worship you go make that right first leave there thy gift before the Altar and go thy way first be reconciled to thy brother and then come and offer thy gift can everybody see the the this is the anti-type of the type the type was you can't come and worship until you're cleansed and here's the antitype I can't come to church and serve God until I've confessed the wrongs that I've done and then the word of God and then God will have fellowship with me Hallelujah now let's stand to our feet and I want you to look at this slide this last slide if you feel you're out of fellowship and what I mean by that is you don't you don't feel the peace of God you know what you need you need a sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ if some if the if the enemy has taken your peace you can get it back tonight the Bible says something you the Bible said you can be sprinkled you can be separated and you can be o obedient to the word of God and God will bring back a fresh anointing on you I've seen it brother I've been pastoring for 18 years this is absolutely the truth I can be discouraged when I come to church there's times I'm I don't even feel like going to church I'm the pastor I preach almost every time there's times I don't even feel like going to church because I'm tired I'm worn out I'm sick I didn't sleep good last night but I it's never fail me if I I always just press through the church and then when I'm there I can I start worshiping God I confess my sins or whatever I say God forgive me my bad attitude and God's spirit freshly anoints me oh my for 18 years years has been that way Hallelujah in other words we always have a way to be purified we always have a way to get back into fellowship with God God's not trying to keep us out he's trying to invite us in but we got to come God's provided way anybody need forgiven tonight you've got a blood that you can be sprinkled with tonight anybody feel guilty tonight of any sin you have a blood that can take away that guilty feeling you can be sprinkled the Holy Ghost will come anoint you when you obey and make that right anyone need redeemed right you feel I'm I'm I'm bought back into the the the the plan of God the family of God you got a blood for that you feel you're you're you're far from the church the blood of Jesus Christ can reconcile you anybody feel like they need Purge and you got some dirt build up the blood can Purge you Hallelujah anybody feel like you you're not doing anything for God you're not doing a good work the blood can take away that feeling and the blood can sprinkle you and put you back into service anybody feel immature or like you're not growing by the grace of God you can confess that obey God and there's a blood to purify you from that Hallelujah is the word of God clear tonight amen let's bow our heads here again the Waters of Separation The anointing of the water would separate you from your sin any dead thing you touch in other words any sin you've dealt with or touched the blood of Christ will separate you from that and bring you back into Fellowship you know we've seen it at our church too before we pray uh after I preach this there was Couples you know like a husband and wife and they were maybe arguing or something and I always appreciated a couple of them would they'd stay out in the car and confess they talk to each other and forgive one another before they would come into church I thought that was really mature brother B says we want to be in here now I know we're not perfect what we should be growing in this brother B said we should be in here 30 minutes beforehand praying so we should be praying at six o'clock God's going to have to help us by God's grace it's a good it's a good habit it's not a law but it's a good habit you know we'll have we'll have better Services if we pray more before service but I have always appreciate those married couples that once they heard my message on this now it's God's message it's not mine once they heard the preaching on this they actually applied it to their lives and they'd sit in the car and I knew before church if I saw them out there and they were talking and they weren't really happy I kind of knew what was going on I was like oh they're letting the Waters of Separation they're letting it wash them before they come to church I said I like that that's real mature I say love you all God bless you now not every time can you do that right but you want to do that as much as possible and there there's also this idea too as soon as the service is over if you got to go confess something go confess something so you can feel that fresh anointing by God's grace how many want that how many want to feel clean by God's grace let's bow our hearts and we'll have a word of prayer father God I've preached an hour and 10 minutes just 70 minutes here Lord thank you God for these special moments Lord God I look back when I would sit on metal chairs when I first came in the message and I'd be in Saturday night services just like this where there's no instruments it's only clapping we only have the instruments of the hands oh this brings back such great memories to me Lord God thank you for this church here thank you for this body of Believers that love you dear God lord I preach your word tonight Lord and I've seen this message Lord uh move the people in such a way Lord God I ask Lord that the great Holy Spirit that's here tonight Lord would lead your people back into fellowship if anyone feels far away from God hopefully not everybody feels that way but Lord if anybody feels far away from God lord may they know there's a water of separation there's a sprinkling of the spirit of God hallelujah that can bring them back into Fellowship that will forgive them Lord if they confess their sin and obey the word of God hallelujah thank you God lord may we recognize if death has entered into our home if we've let something some sin into our home Lord God may you clean out our homes Lord especially our brothers with our cell phones God may we keep them clean Lord God may we only look at good things Lord God for the glory of God Hallelujah Lord you know our hearts Our Lives we want to be guilt-free we want to enjoy the Forgiveness of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah we want to be free indeed Lord God so father move upon your people here tonight Lord God and I pray Lord if there's anything they need to confess they would confess it and they could be clean and they could get back into that Fellowship where the the cross meant more to them Lord the water meant more the knowledge of the word the bread the prayers meant more and then they could go into your presence Hallelujah and they could have fellowship with with you they can talk with you Lord God from God to God's child Hallelujah from father to son from father to daughter and they could have their Fellowship restored I pray you bless it Lord God bless your people as they look to you Lord may they have this sweet fellowship with you I ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen hallelujah let's sing that course there I surrender all here and church while we're singing if there's anything you need to surrender confess it now and the Holy Spirit Will sprinkle you with a fresh anointing Hallelujah
