[0:03] But the main thing is right in the
[0:04] middle of the road with the old spirit
[0:06] in you to keep you warm and moving.
[0:08] Amen. Oh yeah.
[0:09] &gt;&gt; And knowing enough to keep yourself
[0:10] under obedience to the spirit and move
[0:12] just as the spirit moves, not till or
[0:14] not after, just as the spirit moves.
[0:17] &gt;&gt; Greetings, friends, in the matchless
[0:19] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The
[0:21] purpose of this video is to look at the
[0:23] prophet of God's statement about the
[0:26] main thing being staying in the middle
[0:29] of the road by the grace of God. This is
[0:31] a biblical teaching, a biblical
[0:33] principle by the grace of God. So, we'll
[0:35] look at that and look at some real life
[0:37] examples here by the grace of God. I was
[0:39] recently inspired by this thought by
[0:41] listening to sermons from other brothers
[0:43] in the message, which I greatly
[0:44] appreciate. I don't agree with
[0:46] everything they say, but I like the
[0:47] history of the message that the brothers
[0:49] were bringing out. And I think it's
[0:51] helpful to see where the message has
[0:53] come, where it is now, and where the
[0:56] Holy Ghost wants to take us in the
[0:58] future should the rapture ty the grace
[1:01] of God. So let's begin with a biblical
[1:03] foundation by the grace of God. Brother
[1:05] Brandham uses this verse often. Isaiah
[1:07] 35:8, "And highway shall there be and a
[1:10] way, and it shall be called the way of
[1:12] holiness. The unclean shall not pass
[1:14] over it, but it shall be for those the
[1:16] wayfairing men, though fools shall not
[1:18] heir therein." So, I'll be showing a
[1:20] visual in a moment of a path, a road
[1:23] between two streams, two ditches, we
[1:26] might say. So, that's my symbol of the
[1:29] way of holiness by God's grace. This
[1:31] topic also relates to some videos I made
[1:34] a few years ago called How Far Cans into
[1:37] Sin. So, I'll leave links to those in
[1:40] the description by God's grace. Speaking
[1:42] of the straight and narrow way, Jesus
[1:44] talked about that in Matthew 7:13 and
[1:46] 14. Narrow is the way which leadth unto
[1:50] life, and few there be that find it. So,
[1:52] praise God, we found the narrow road.
[1:54] And it's our desire to stay right in the
[1:56] middle of that road. Proverbs 4:25, 26,
[2:00] and 27 tell us to let our eyes look
[2:03] right on. Ponder the path of thy feet.
[2:06] Turn not to the right hand, nor to the
[2:08] left. Remove thy foot from evil. And
[2:12] there's some very beautiful special
[2:14] verses. 1 Thessalonians 5:21, prove all
[2:16] things, hold fast that which is good.
[2:19] And verse 22, abstain from all
[2:21] appearance of evil. 1 John 4:1,
[2:23] "Beloved, believe not every spirit, but
[2:25] try the spirits whether they are of God,
[2:27] because many false prophets are gone out
[2:29] into the world." I love 2 Timothy 2:15,
[2:32] "Study to show thyself approved unto
[2:33] God, a workman that needeth not to be
[2:36] ashamed, rightly dividing the word of
[2:37] truth." I love what God told Joshua in
[2:40] Joshua 1:7. Only be strong and very
[2:43] courageous. Turn not from it to the
[2:46] right hand or to the left that thou
[2:48] mayest prosper whethersoever thou goest.
[2:51] Two more beautiful scriptures. I love
[2:52] this one. 2 John 1:9. Whosoever
[2:55] transgressth and abideth not in the
[2:58] doctrine of Christ hath not God. He that
[3:00] abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he
[3:01] hath both the father and the son. Then
[3:04] Hebrews 2:1, "Therefore, we ought to
[3:06] give the more earnest heed to the things
[3:08] which we have heard, less at any time we
[3:11] should let them slip." So there is a
[3:13] definite Bible foundation of staying in
[3:15] the middle of the road, staying in the
[3:16] truth, not turning to the left or the
[3:18] right. And this is helpful again because
[3:20] of 2 Corinthians 13:5. Examine
[3:23] yourselves whether ye be in the faith.
[3:25] Prove your own selves. Know ye not your
[3:28] own selves how that Jesus Christ is in
[3:30] you, except ye be repribates. So, we're
[3:33] told to examine how we're walking on the
[3:35] straight and narrow way by the grace of
[3:37] God. Now, each time we might sin or
[3:40] teach a false doctrine or make a
[3:42] mistake, it's like a step away from the
[3:44] middle of the road. A good example is
[3:46] Galatians 2:1 and 12 where Peter, a holy
[3:49] ghostfilled man, separates himself from
[3:52] eating with the Gentiles because of fear
[3:54] of the Jews. And we often see that in
[3:55] our lives. Fear will sometimes cause us
[3:58] to leave the truth. But we're thankful
[4:01] that the Holy Ghost sent correction to
[4:02] Peter through Paul. Paul said he was to
[4:05] be blamed to his face. And so there's
[4:07] times God corrects us and gets us back
[4:09] on the straight and narrow. And remember
[4:12] Peter was a bornag again holy
[4:13] ghostfilled believer who got a little
[4:15] off the beaten path. We'd say there's
[4:18] numerous quotes where brother Ram talks
[4:19] about the middle of the road. Here's two
[4:20] that are very special to me and I'm sure
[4:23] to you. The Patos vision 1960. Brother
[4:26] Ram said, "When a good road is built,
[4:27] the highest part is in the center
[4:29] because it lets all the trash wash off
[4:31] to both sides." When a man really comes
[4:33] to Christ, he got his eyes centered on
[4:35] Christ. If he's a little a bit
[4:37] emotional, he'll be a fanatic. If he's a
[4:39] little bit cold, he'll get on the other
[4:40] side and be just a cucumber over on that
[4:42] side. C is intellectual. But the main
[4:45] thing is right in the middle of the road
[4:47] with enough spirit in you, keep you warm
[4:48] and moving. Amen. and knowing enough to
[4:51] keep yourself under obedience to the
[4:52] spirit to move just as the spirit moves.
[4:55] Not till or not after, just as the
[4:57] spirit moves. Let's listen to the quote.
[5:00] &gt;&gt; See, it shall be a highway and a way and
[5:05] it shall be called the way of holiness,
[5:08] not a highway of holiness. See, a roads
[5:10] built a way a good road is built highest
[5:13] parts in the center because it lets all
[5:15] the trash wash off to both sides.
[5:18] &gt;&gt; That's it. When a man really comes to
[5:20] Christ, he's got his eyes centered on
[5:22] Christ. If he's a little bit emotional,
[5:24] he'll be a fanatic. If he's a little bit
[5:26] cold, he'll get on his other side and be
[5:28] just a cucumber over on that side. See,
[5:31] is intellectual. But the main thing is
[5:33] right in the middle of the road with
[5:35] enough spirit in keep you warm and
[5:37] moving. Amen.
[5:39] &gt;&gt; And knowing enough to keep yourself
[5:40] under obedience to the spirit and move
[5:42] just as the spirit moves, not till or
[5:44] not after, just as the spirit moves.
[5:47] Next, God hiding himself in simplicity.
[5:49] March 1763,
[5:51] Brother Ram said, "One side's highly
[5:53] intellectual, cold and indifferent. They
[5:55] deny everything there, and the others
[5:57] got on the other side. The other side's
[5:59] a radical bunch of emotion and denying
[6:01] the word, but the real true church stays
[6:03] right in the middle of the road. It's
[6:04] got the Bible knowledge of what God
[6:06] said, and it's spiritual enough to be
[6:08] warm in its heart." And then he mentions
[6:10] Isaiah 35:8. Let's listen to the quote.
[6:14] There's one side that's highly
[6:16] intellectual, cold and indifferent. They
[6:19] deny everything there. And the others
[6:22] get on the other side on the other side
[6:24] of the radical bunch of emotion and deny
[6:26] the word.
[6:28] &gt;&gt; But the real true church stays right in
[6:30] the middle of the road. Amen.
[6:33] &gt;&gt; Now, if you notice, it's it's it's got
[6:36] the Bible knowledge of what God said,
[6:40] and it's it's spiritual enough to be
[6:42] warm in its heart, and it's just a road.
[6:44] Isaiah said it would be that way. He
[6:46] said, "There shall be a highway."
[6:49] &gt;&gt; So, here's a simple visual I made here
[6:51] by God's grace. Here you can see the
[6:53] balance is in the middle of the road.
[6:55] It's the middle mark. And I'm taking
[6:57] that from Paul's words where he said,
[6:59] "Let us press towards the mark of the
[7:00] high calling of God in Christ Jesus, the
[7:04] most obedience we can give to the Holy
[7:07] Ghost." But each one of us are subject
[7:10] to the human spirit that we're given.
[7:13] Some of us will be emotional. So that's
[7:15] on the right side of the road. Maybe
[7:16] we're a little too emotional and we
[7:18] might lack doctrine at times. The other
[7:20] side is we're too intellectual, which
[7:22] might develop some legalism at times.
[7:25] But as we show with Peter, Peter kind of
[7:27] went to the legalism side where he
[7:29] wouldn't eat with the Gentiles, but the
[7:31] Holy Ghost was faithful to bring him
[7:32] back to the balance, back to the middle
[7:34] by the grace of God. I also then would
[7:37] add terms in here, Bible terms to help
[7:40] us understand more about this. I believe
[7:42] the wise virgin will stay on the path.
[7:45] They'll stay as close as they can to the
[7:47] middle of the road. I believe the
[7:50] foolish virgin kind of get off the
[7:51] beaten path out in the weeds, we'd say,
[7:53] out in the grass. as you can see in the
[7:55] picture. But then the makebeliever like
[7:57] the Judas Escaric group, the Balum
[7:59] group, the Esau group, they totally fall
[8:02] off the path into the water. And those
[8:04] are the ones that are lost. So here's a
[8:07] couple quotes I like to share. The first
[8:09] one is from perfect strength and perfect
[8:11] weakness. Brother Ram said, "Paul was
[8:14] concerned lest he'd step off the path
[8:16] somewhere." So now you can see where I'm
[8:18] bringing this visual in. I'm making
[8:20] these lines on both sides of the center
[8:23] line just to show how sometimes we take
[8:24] a step away from the center of the road.
[8:28] We get a false doctrine or we start
[8:31] majoring on a minor, we might say. So
[8:33] Peter clearly took a step away from the
[8:36] middle when he separated himself from
[8:39] the Gentiles.
[8:41] And now I just want to use a quick
[8:42] example of two groups that I see in the
[8:44] United States. The first group I've
[8:46] called the goat group, but as I've
[8:48] listened to more of their sermons, I
[8:50] think a better title might be the open
[8:52] book group. And this was not an
[8:54] observation I made first. It was first
[8:56] from a brother from another country, a
[8:58] European country. He listened to all
[9:00] their recent youth meetings and revival
[9:03] meetings and they kept using the term
[9:05] open book, open book, open book and
[9:07] that's what he shared with me. So I
[9:10] think if they had their own title,
[9:11] they'd call themselves the open book
[9:12] group. And then also here in the USA we
[9:15] have what's called like a seventh seal
[9:16] group. And as I go through this we'll
[9:18] talk about the differences the major
[9:20] differences between these two groups.
[9:22] Okay. So one major differentiation
[9:24] between these groups is the type of
[9:27] music that they play. And I've heard
[9:29] them preach against each other over the
[9:32] years like the last six or seven years.
[9:34] So the open book group allows a lot more
[9:37] music variety which I believe is right.
[9:39] So that's my personal preference. It's
[9:41] okay to have variety as long as you
[9:42] don't insert rock and roll. But the
[9:45] other side, the seventh seal group, they
[9:48] limit the variety of music. And I
[9:50] believe they grieve the Holy Spirit by
[9:51] doing this. So on my visual here is
[9:54] another quote where it says, "Lord,
[9:56] brother was praying,"Lord that I'll not
[9:58] step out of your blessed path from March
[10:00] 22nd 57." So as you can see in the
[10:03] picture, I made a dot step to the left
[10:05] of the path. That would be an
[10:06] intellectual decision where you grieve
[10:09] the Holy Spirit by not having drums
[10:11] perhaps not letting the people dance,
[10:14] shout, scream when we see that in the
[10:16] Bible such as when Israel came out of
[10:19] Egypt on the day of Pentecost. Brother
[10:22] Ram said they were shouting, jumping,
[10:24] leaping, praising God. So that's the
[10:26] first example with music. Second example
[10:29] is regarded to the open book group. They
[10:33] preach basically that it's always God's
[10:36] will to heal. Now, the circle for the
[10:39] emotional group has taken a step to the
[10:42] right. We know it's not God's will to
[10:44] heal always. Perhaps I'll make a video
[10:45] about that in the future. But what I've
[10:48] even witnessed from these preachers is
[10:50] that they claim publicly someone's going
[10:52] to heal. And I've seen two cases where
[10:54] the people have died and then they say,
[10:56] "Well, they still got their healing
[10:58] because they got a theophony body." But
[11:00] that wasn't the healing that everyone
[11:01] was expecting and desiring. So it's a
[11:04] little disingenuous to say that oh God
[11:07] answered our prayer for healing because
[11:08] that's not what people were expecting.
[11:10] People were expecting the people to
[11:11] continue to live. The next topic is
[11:14] about exalting brother Brandham too
[11:16] highly. So, the emotional group or the
[11:18] open book group now takes another step
[11:21] away cuz I just recently heard one of
[11:23] their most popular preachers say that
[11:26] they must believe every word from 47 to
[11:29] 65 just like every word from Genesis to
[11:32] Revelation.
[11:34] So, this is a sin or step away from the
[11:36] truth that's on the same level as the
[11:38] press play and obey false denomination
[11:41] of the current Brandom Tabernacle
[11:43] leadership. So now that's two steps away
[11:45] from the beaten path right down the
[11:48] middle of the road to my humble opinion
[11:49] by the grace of God. So this shows this
[11:52] emotional open book group doesn't have
[11:54] enough teaching to bring the rightly
[11:57] divided truth on these particular topics
[12:00] by God's grace. And the final subject
[12:02] I'll talk about is interracial marriage.
[12:03] I've made numerous videos about that. I
[12:05] talked to some friends last year that
[12:08] went to this seventh seal group even in
[12:11] my own home state here in Ohio and they
[12:14] were already married and it's a black
[12:16] woman and a white man. They were already
[12:17] married. They've been married for over
[12:19] 20 years and they walked into this
[12:22] seventh seal group church and the people
[12:24] didn't know that they were already
[12:26] married. So when they got the couple
[12:28] separated, they tried to convince the
[12:30] black woman to leave the white man
[12:32] because brother Brandon was against
[12:33] interracial marriage and they didn't
[12:35] even know that they were already
[12:36] married. So to me, this is a form of
[12:38] racism. So that's a step away from the
[12:41] solid beaten path of the Bible. There's
[12:43] over six examples of believers
[12:46] intermaring between nations and peoples.
[12:49] And brother Ram called Moses and Zapora
[12:51] God's perfect will and God's choice, as
[12:53] a recent video showed. So, I'll leave a
[12:55] link to that video in the description as
[12:57] well. Also, from watching other videos,
[13:00] too, the emotional group or the open
[13:03] book group, they also reject interracial
[13:06] marriage. So, that's another step away
[13:08] from the beaten path to the right for
[13:09] them. So, the circle moves to the right.
[13:13] So, just to even it out, I'll say one
[13:14] more thing about the seventh seal group.
[13:16] I have videos of some of these preachers
[13:18] saying you can only get saved through a
[13:22] member of the message. And to me, that's
[13:25] a lie. Brother never taught that. So
[13:27] that dot on the intellectual side goes
[13:29] one step further to the left.
[13:32] So now both groups are at least three
[13:34] steps away from down the middle of the
[13:36] road by God's grace. Brother Ram never
[13:39] taught that you can only get saved
[13:41] through a message person. Brother even
[13:43] believed Catholics could be saved as
[13:45] long as they were trusting in the blood
[13:46] of Jesus Christ.
[13:48] &gt;&gt; I've took this stand that if the
[13:51] Catholic Church, a Catholic, a Roman
[13:54] Catholic or Orthodox or whatever he may
[13:57] be, if he's looking to the Catholic
[13:59] church for salvation, the person's love.
[14:03] If the Baptist is looking to the Baptist
[14:05] church for salvation, love. If the
[14:09] Pentecostal is looking to the
[14:10] Pentecostal
[14:12] church for salvation, he's lost.
[14:16] &gt;&gt; But if the Catholic Pentecostal
[14:19] or Baptist, Presbyterian, or whatever,
[14:22] if he's solemnly trusting in Jesus
[14:26] Christ, he's saved.
[14:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:28] &gt;&gt; Because it's by faith are you saved? And
[14:31] that by grace, Catholics can be saved.
[14:35] Baptists can be saved, Pentecostals are
[14:37] saved. because that we all accept what
[14:41] Christ did for us. That's it's our own
[14:44] personal faith in a finished work that
[14:47] Christ did for us. Therefore, I have
[14:50] never draw a denominational boundary or
[14:54] had a barrier. I've tried to reach out,
[14:56] take everyone in my arms and point them
[14:59] to the cross. And that so I believe that
[15:03] a person is saved if he's a Methodist,
[15:06] Baptist, Catholic, or whatever he might
[15:08] be, if he's solemnly trusting Jesus
[15:11] Christ for his grace. But if he's a
[15:14] Catholic and believing the church saves
[15:16] him, then he's lost. If he's a Pentecost
[15:18] and believing the church saves him, he's
[15:20] lost. Amen.
[15:21] &gt;&gt; But no matter what he is, what church he
[15:24] goes to, if he is solemnly depending on
[15:27] the blood and merits of Jesus Christ,
[15:30] he's saved. I don't care what church
[15:31] he's in. For it's by faith are we saved.
[15:34] That by grace.
[15:36] &gt;&gt; In closing, friends, hope this video was
[15:38] a blessing here. By the grace of God, I
[15:40] thought it'd be helpful to give a visual
[15:42] of how groups sometimes get off the
[15:44] beaten path. They take steps away from
[15:46] the truth of God's word. And friends,
[15:49] please know that I put myself on that
[15:50] chart every day. Every time I study, as
[15:54] the Holy Spirit brings it to my
[15:55] remembrance, I try to ask myself, am I
[15:57] in the middle of the road? Is my heart
[15:59] warm for the Lord Jesus Christ? Are my
[16:02] emotions yielded to the Lord Jesus
[16:04] Christ? And also, am I using my
[16:07] knowledge and understanding that God's
[16:08] given me, the wisdom God's given me in
[16:10] order to obey all the word of God? I'm
[16:13] not claiming I'm perfect. I've never
[16:15] claimed that. I've got areas I can grow.
[16:18] And I think if I would judge myself on
[16:20] that road, I probably leaned towards the
[16:22] more intellectual side, but then the
[16:24] other Wednesday, I danced around the
[16:25] church. I didn't plan it as a song
[16:28] leader. I just started singing I could
[16:29] sing of your love forever. And I danced
[16:31] all around the church. It just struck
[16:32] me. That anointing just fell on me. I
[16:34] was shouting, rejoicing, dancing all
[16:37] over the church during the first song of
[16:39] the song service. And when we have guest
[16:42] preachers, I might be the loudest amen
[16:44] corner at our church. I've always loved
[16:46] to make noise, praise the Lord, clap,
[16:48] stomp, dance. So, by God's grace, I just
[16:51] try to do my best to stay in the middle
[16:52] of the road. Of course, there are times
[16:54] I get cold on God. I need to return to
[16:56] my first love. Just like Jesus said in
[16:58] Revelation chapter 2, every person goes
[17:00] through that. There's times, Brother Ram
[17:02] said he needed revival in his life. Then
[17:05] he says we need a daily revival. Brother
[17:07] Ram says, "Every time the Holy Ghost
[17:08] comes back on me, like it came on me
[17:10] when I was born again, I have a boohoo
[17:12] experience." So, I have a quote video
[17:15] about that perhaps. I'll link that up in
[17:16] the video as well. So, again, the main
[17:18] thing is 2 Corinthians 13:5. Examine
[17:21] yourselves whether you be in the faith.
[17:22] Prove your own selves. Know ye not your
[17:25] own selves how that Jesus Christ is in
[17:27] you, except you be reprobates. We don't
[17:30] want to be repbates. Repbates are
[17:31] rejected from the faith. They're the
[17:33] ones that fall off into the ditch or
[17:35] into the waters or the streams on on the
[17:37] sides of the highway of holiness. We
[17:40] want to stay on the highway of holiness
[17:41] by the grace of God. And the way to do
[17:43] that is to have Christ in you. That's
[17:45] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Christ in
[17:47] you, the hope of glory. So friends, if
[17:50] you're not born again, repent, be
[17:52] baptized. That justifies you. Get
[17:54] sanctified. That gives you a new spirit
[17:57] according to Ezekiel 36. New heart is
[18:00] justification. New spirit sanctification
[18:02] gets your habits and daily life cleaned
[18:04] out. And then God will give you his
[18:06] spirit. The baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[18:08] the seal of God unto the day of your
[18:10] redemption. Praise God that Jesus Christ
[18:12] can keep us in the middle of the road.
[18:15] If you have any questions, concerns or
[18:16] testimonies about this video, please
[18:18] contact me.
[18:20] God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[18:22] the desire of your heart.
[18:26] &gt;&gt; Very happy to be here this afternoon and
[18:28] again in defense of the gospel of Jesus
[18:30] Christ to bring the good tidings, the
[18:33] good news that Jesus raised from the
[18:35] dead, living among man today, his
[18:37] church. The same Jesus that was
[18:40] yesterday will be today and forever.
[18:44] He never failed.
