[0:02] what about the people that believe in
[0:05] the Lord now and don't and not the way
[0:09] you preach they don't have to believe
[0:11] this they don't have to believe the way
[0:12] I preach it see don't have to believe
[0:15] that so the thing for you to do is to
[0:18] remember that I speak to you in the name
[0:20] of the Lord amen hallelujah amen Lord
[0:25] hallelujah be prepared or you don't know
[0:28] what time something can happen
[0:31] greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:33] of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of
[0:36] this video is to give my reaction on
[0:38] Justin Peterson's claims against brother
[0:41] brandham as a false prophet and
[0:43] charlatan of course I strongly disagree
[0:45] with those accusations I believe William
[0:48] Brandon was a genuine prophet of God and
[0:50] a genuine honest servant of the Lord
[0:52] Jesus Christ in this video I'm defending
[0:55] William brandham as a genuine prophet of
[0:57] God Justin Peters released this video on
[1:00] February 2nd 2025 it's called history of
[1:03] the Pentecostal charismatic movement the
[1:06] video starts at about the 53 minute and
[1:09] 35 second Mark and it's less than half a
[1:12] minute long it ends at the 54 minute and
[1:15] 52 Mark I'll begin by sharing the video
[1:19] of Justin Peters giving a one minute
[1:22] summary of His reasons why he thinks
[1:24] William brandham was a charlatan and
[1:26] false prophet and then I'll give my
[1:28] reactions afterward Ward by God's grace
[1:31] so here's the video of Justin
[1:34] Peters William brandham William brandham
[1:37] is the father of the post World War II
[1:39] healing Revival movement brandham taught
[1:42] that only those who accepted his
[1:44] teachings would be saved he prophesied
[1:46] that all of the world's denominations
[1:48] would be consumed by the Roman Catholic
[1:51] controlled World Council of churches and
[1:53] brandham said that this would happen
[1:55] just before the Rapture and the
[1:57] destruction of the world which he
[1:59] prophesied would happen in the year
[2:01] 1977 well we're a few years past 1977
[2:05] aren't we and we're yet we're still here
[2:08] he denounced the Trinity as a demonic
[2:10] Doctrine I've actually got audio of
[2:12] William brandham saying this and he said
[2:13] and I quote trinitarianism is of the
[2:16] devil thus saith the
[2:20] Lord It's Oneness theology what TD Jake
[2:24] is to this day
[2:27] modalism he proclaimed himself to be the
[2:29] angel of Revelation 3:14 and he also
[2:34] claimed to be I'll give you two guesses
[2:36] and three three three guesses two of to
[2:39] Elijah Elijah these people were
[2:43] fascinated with Elijah so false prophet
[2:48] charlatan so my first reaction is
[2:50] looking at the words false prophet and
[2:52] charlatan brother brandham was a genuine
[2:55] prophet of God brother brandham spoke
[2:57] with thus sayith the Lord on tape at
[2:59] least six six times and these thus sayi
[3:02] the Lord prophecies have come to pass I
[3:04] made a video about that a couple years
[3:05] ago I'll leave a link to that in the
[3:07] description so you can watch it if you'd
[3:09] like to by the grace of God but here's a
[3:11] summarized list of those six thus sayith
[3:13] the Lords first in 1958 brother Bram
[3:16] told Marilyn Hickey she'd be pregnant if
[3:18] she had Faith with thus sayith the Lord
[3:20] and she had the baby 10 years later
[3:22] second 1961 brother Braham said there'd
[3:25] be no greater gift to the Gentiles than
[3:27] his gift his prophetic discernment son
[3:30] of man gift in 1962 brother R said women
[3:33] would continue to strip themselves that
[3:36] came to pass in 1965 brother R had a
[3:39] vision of the USA Church dancing to rock
[3:41] and roll with Bob hered women that has
[3:43] come to pass fifth brother ROM
[3:46] prophesied of the death of Florence
[3:47] sharen in 1965 and that came to pass and
[3:51] six and finally brother Ram said no
[3:53] denomination will break up and come back
[3:55] to the word the apostolic revelation of
[3:57] the word of God he said that in 1965 and
[4:01] that has come to pass so that quick list
[4:04] there obviously proves brother brandom
[4:05] is a genuine prophet of God he spoke in
[4:08] the name of the Lord and those
[4:09] statements came to pass he also meets
[4:12] the other five requirements for a
[4:14] genuine prophet of God as I put on my
[4:16] video three Prophecies of William
[4:18] brandham in that video I go through the
[4:21] numerous qualifications to be a genuine
[4:22] prophet of God there's at least six
[4:24] there could be more so without a doubt
[4:26] Willam brandham was a genuine prophet of
[4:28] God second Justin Peter said brother BR
[4:31] was a charlatan I had to look this up a
[4:33] charlatan is a malicious trickster a
[4:36] fake person who deceives for personal
[4:39] profit of course I believe that's a
[4:41] false accusation brother brandham was
[4:43] the opposite a humble servant of the
[4:45] Lord Jesus Christ he would and preached
[4:47] to the poorest of poor he would spend
[4:50] long hours praying for people he would
[4:53] preach long indepth sermons to feed the
[4:56] flock of God to fully reveal the
[4:58] revelation of Jesus Christ and there's a
[5:00] story even in 1963 in is your life
[5:04] worthy of the Gospel brother said he was
[5:05] offered five times his current salary to
[5:08] be a part of a bigger Pentecostal
[5:11] denomination and he turned it down
[5:13] because they asked him to compromise on
[5:15] his Bible Doctrine and he wouldn't do it
[5:17] he wouldn't compromise on the water
[5:19] baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus
[5:20] Christ the fact women should have long
[5:23] uncut hair and men should have short
[5:24] hair and the fact women are not called
[5:27] to preach among others brother brandham
[5:29] refused money in order to stay true to
[5:32] God's word as any genuine prophet of God
[5:34] would let's listen to the quote when a
[5:36] man come to me not long ago and sit at a
[5:38] table and said brother brandom I want to
[5:40] reach across the table a great man I
[5:43] want to take hold of your hand I love
[5:45] you I was in a church and heard him
[5:46] preaching said I love you I believe
[5:48] you're a God's servant I said thank you
[5:50] doctor I love you too he said I want to
[5:53] tell you how much I love you as a
[5:55] brother and said you see My Little Queen
[5:57] sitting here my wife you remember her I
[5:59] said I do said the doctor give her two
[6:02] weeks to live with sarom cancer and you
[6:05] come to the city and you prayed for her
[6:07] and looked up and saw a vision and
[6:09] looked back and told me thus sayith the
[6:11] Lord she'll be healed great spot in her
[6:14] back sunk in like that looked like a
[6:15] great big uh like the uh part of a
[6:19] woman's breast pulled inwardly in her
[6:21] back right on her spine is not even a
[6:24] spot of it
[6:25] today said there sets my queen a living
[6:28] today
[6:30] that how can I do anything but love you
[6:31] for praying that prayer of faith how can
[6:33] I keep from bleeding you to be a St of
[6:35] Lord when you saw me and told just
[6:37] exactly what would happen he said now
[6:39] I've got something for you brother
[6:40] Brandon he said I belong to the greatest
[6:43] Pentecostal League there is I said yes
[6:45] sir I know that he said I talked with
[6:48] the brother not long ago and they told
[6:50] me to get in contact with you and tell
[6:52] you that it was a shame that you took
[6:55] that god-given Ministry to a bunch of
[6:58] people off the river and around like
[7:00] that I said that right said yes said God
[7:04] sent that Ministry to hit the nerve
[7:06] spots the big spot the highlights I seen
[7:09] the devil talking right then I thought
[7:12] yeah jump out off this mountain and show
[7:15] you know office building see I thought
[7:17] just lead him out a little far my old
[7:19] mother used to say give the cow enough
[7:20] rope she'll hang her on S I said is that
[7:23] right yes said it's a shame but what you
[7:25] do said what are you today you can
[7:28] hardly buy yourself a
[7:30] meal and said look at Oral Roberts them
[7:32] stepped in and got out there with the
[7:35] 100th of the ministry you got and look
[7:37] what they go I said yeah that's right
[7:40] see and he said my group will take you
[7:43] we'll take you right in is as one of our
[7:45] Brethren they'll all give you the right
[7:47] hand of fellowship and we'll Charter a
[7:49] plane and give you your wages of 500 a
[7:51] week or more if you want it and we'll
[7:53] send you to every major city in the
[7:54] country this happened right in Phoenix
[7:56] Arizona right across the table and he
[7:58] said and we'll pay here said then let
[8:00] the world the outside
[8:03] world let the dignitaries the big guys
[8:06] the up and up so you're always talking
[8:08] about the down and out we got the up and
[8:10] outs so let them see the hand of the
[8:12] Lord and I take my wife long and others
[8:14] can prove that those things that you say
[8:16] comes to pass I said yes sir that'd be
[8:19] great I see the man in the position of a
[8:22] dll LD a writer of
[8:25] Books doctor of literature fine writer
[8:29] fine man see he didn't know the
[8:32] scripture did you know that angel that
[8:35] performed them kind of works never did
[8:36] go to S he stayed with the called out
[8:40] group
[8:41] Abraham he just didn't know it I just
[8:44] let him alone just sat there a little
[8:46] bit I just want to see what the catch
[8:48] was now I said well U uh what would I
[8:51] have to do said well brother Bram just
[8:54] the only thing they said we discussed it
[8:56] a few things little petty things that
[8:58] you teach it you just lay I'm a sign I
[9:01] said for instance what
[9:03] brother all he said you're baptism you
[9:06] know you know you kind of baptized like
[9:08] the Oneness something like that and said
[9:09] little things like that I said oh I went
[9:12] ahead and he said the initial evidence
[9:15] women preachers and just a few little
[9:16] things like that I said
[9:18] uhhuh I said you know I'm surprised that
[9:21] one servant of God would ask another
[9:23] servant of God after paying the tribute
[9:25] to me you did and calling me a prophet
[9:29] and knowing that the word of the lord of
[9:31] the revelation of the word comes to the
[9:33] prophet and you turn around Dr PPE it
[9:36] don't speak of your good intelligence
[9:39] and would say and ask one servant of God
[9:41] you asked another servant of God to
[9:43] compromise on the thing that means more
[9:45] to him in life
[9:48] itself I said no sir brother po by no
[9:53] means what I do it no sir what is it
[9:57] there's a grain of eternal life live a
[9:59] diey whether you're a great guy or not a
[10:01] great
[10:02] guy now friends let's get into these six
[10:05] bullet points that Justin Peters used on
[10:07] his video first he said William Brandon
[10:10] was the father of the postor War II
[10:12] healing Revival movement and I agree
[10:15] with that there are so many testimonies
[10:17] of God answering prayers brother
[10:19] brandom's prayers for the sick and
[10:21] Afflicted such as Congressman Upshaw his
[10:23] voice is twice on brother Ram's tape
[10:26] talking about the healing no longer
[10:28] needing crutches and his desire to
[10:30] spread the testimony of his healing with
[10:33] world leaders such as Joseph Stalin in
[10:36] order to try to convert their souls to
[10:38] Jesus Christ second Florence Humes was
[10:40] healed of tuberculosis I personally met
[10:42] her around 2010 before she passed away
[10:46] she was healed of tuberculosis Marilyn
[10:49] Hickey as we already said was given a
[10:51] thus sayith the Lord she'd have a child
[10:53] and she did 10 years later Georgie
[10:55] Carter who was healed of
[10:57] tuberculosis Haddie Waldrop Banks Wood's
[11:00] wife and Banks Wood's son Ernest farmer
[11:03] who was healed of crippled feet there's
[11:04] videos about his testimony online and a
[11:08] recent one I heard was a brother named
[11:09] Max Manning who's still alive a wall
[11:12] fell on him and he was in the hospital
[11:14] brother bam came and prayed for him and
[11:15] told him he'd get out and live for the
[11:17] glory of God and now he's over 90 still
[11:20] alive in perfect good health just as the
[11:22] prophet of God told him the second
[11:24] bullet point was only those who accepted
[11:26] his teaching would be saved
[11:30] so this is a false accusation brother
[11:32] Bram did not say this in 1964 questions
[11:35] and answers part one they specifically
[11:38] asked brother brandham if people don't
[11:40] believe this your message will they be
[11:43] saved he said yes if they believe the
[11:45] Lord if they didn't believe the baptism
[11:47] of the Holy Ghost that brother Brown
[11:48] taught well then he said of course
[11:49] they'll go into the tribulation if
[11:51] they're alive to see it he said but
[11:53] they're saved not because brother ramam
[11:55] said so but because the Bible says so if
[11:58] you accept the word the word gives you a
[12:00] pardon because the word's already taken
[12:01] your judgment let's listen to the quote
[12:04] what about the people that believe in
[12:07] the Lord now and don't and not the way
[12:11] you preach they don't have to believe
[12:13] this they don't have to believe the way
[12:14] I preach it see don't have to believe
[12:17] that for the last day message will they
[12:20] be saved yes if they believe the Lord
[12:24] see and if they they disagree and say I
[12:26] don't believe he's a word I don't
[12:27] believe that this is right I don't
[12:28] believe in a baptis the holy ghost that
[12:30] shows where they're headed for the
[12:31] tribulation period but those who can
[12:33] accept the word in its fullness not me
[12:35] preaching it because it's a Bible says
[12:38] so those who accept that is free because
[12:41] the word's already been judged the third
[12:44] bullet point was that brother Brandon
[12:46] prophesied that all denominations would
[12:47] be consumed by the World Council of
[12:49] churches just before the Rapture and
[12:51] destruction of the world in
[12:53] 1977 this is a false accusation brother
[12:56] Braham did not prophesy of that he
[12:58] predicted it
[12:59] I have a video on the 1977 prediction
[13:03] that brother Brandon made numerous times
[13:05] and at least I think 18 times or more
[13:07] brother brand said it's a prediction not
[13:09] a prophecy now he said he got it by
[13:12] divine revelation which if you notice
[13:14] was not spoken with thus sayith the Lord
[13:16] it wasn't in the name of the Lord
[13:18] there's at least three reasons he
[13:19] thought the 1977 date was divine
[13:22] inspiration as a prediction first he
[13:25] thought it was Israel's 70th Jubilee so
[13:28] 70 * 50
[13:29] from the first Jubilee He said was going
[13:31] to be around
[13:32] 1977 second he said 1977 was the time
[13:36] that the Gentiles would have had
[13:38] 1,954 years to have the gospel and that
[13:41] would have been equal to the time that
[13:43] Abraham and the israelies had the Old
[13:46] Testament from the time of Abraham to
[13:48] Christ so brother R thought it was 1950
[13:51] years from Abraham to Christ and then
[13:53] the Gentiles would get the same amount
[13:54] of time from Christ's Ascension or the
[13:56] book of Acts Church to the end of the G
[13:59] dispensation the end of the 7th Church
[14:01] age which he thought would be around
[14:03] 1977 but again no thus sayith the Lord
[14:06] there was no Prophecy from Brother
[14:07] brandham on this he said it
[14:09] repeatedly and third brother brandham
[14:11] said no democracy had lasted 200 years
[14:13] so United States declared independence
[14:16] in 1776 so brother randam added 200
[14:19] years to that and had
[14:21] 1976 so he had at least three reasons
[14:23] why he thought 1977 was an important
[14:26] date but again he never said it was a
[14:28] prophecy he said it was a prediction so
[14:30] I believe it's wrong for Justin Peters
[14:32] to state that third bullet point because
[14:35] it was not a prophecy but it is true
[14:37] that all the denominations will be
[14:39] consumed in the world Council of
[14:40] churches some type of ecclesiastical
[14:43] Unity with the Roman Catholic Church
[14:45] brother Ram said thus sayith the Lord
[14:47] all the denominations will take the mark
[14:49] of the beast in
[14:51] 1965 it's predicted that they're going
[14:53] to do it and they're going to do it for
[14:56] it's thus sayith the lord they're going
[14:58] to do it
[14:59] you think them Den nominations will ever
[15:02] break up their denomination come back to
[15:03] the word it's thus sayeth the Lord they
[15:06] won't will they go into the Antichrist
[15:09] exactly it's thus sayth the Lord they
[15:11] will what are you saying about I have to
[15:14] be a witness and so do
[15:16] you all believers that's according to
[15:19] Revelation 2: 20- 23 when the spirit of
[15:23] Jezebel will be judged and of course
[15:26] which church has the spirit of Jezebel
[15:28] the Roman cathol cic Church all the
[15:30] daughters and all the children of the
[15:32] mother Harlot Jezebel will be cast into
[15:34] a bed and destroyed this is speaking of
[15:37] the battle of Armageddon I believe and
[15:39] so that Spirit of Jezebel mentioned in
[15:41] Revelation 2:
[15:43] 20-23 is the mother Harlot The Jezebel
[15:46] Church spoken of in Revelation chapter
[15:48] 17 and
[15:50] 18 the fourth bullet point was that
[15:53] brother Ram denounce the Trinity as a
[15:54] demonic Doctrine and that is true Justin
[15:58] Peters is wrong on this the god of the
[16:00] Old Testament Jehovah or Yahweh never
[16:02] said he was three persons any
[16:05] monotheistic Jew would know that God of
[16:08] the Old Testament never called himself
[16:10] three persons or two persons he was
[16:13] always God Alone of course Justin Peters
[16:17] is a trinitarian so that's why he'd be
[16:19] so zealous against this statement by
[16:22] brother brandham but brother bram's
[16:24] right the Trinity Dogma is such an awful
[16:27] false Doctrine I've two videos called
[16:30] the seven problems with the Trinity
[16:31] Dogma I've also put out a recent video
[16:34] about let us make man in our image and
[16:35] how it's not speaking of three persons
[16:37] so there's numerous videos about how the
[16:40] Trinity is a false Doctrine on my
[16:41] channel and trinitarianism is of the
[16:44] devil with thus say the Lord because
[16:45] it's an addition to the word of God God
[16:48] never asked to be called three persons
[16:50] Proverbs 35 and6 says we must not add to
[16:54] the word of God or else we'll be called
[16:56] Liars revelation 22:18-19
[16:58] says not to add a word or take a word
[17:00] away the Trinity Dogma adds words onto
[17:03] God's words so it's a false Doctrine the
[17:06] Trinity Dogma is a heresy in of itself
[17:09] and brother Brandon wisely pointed out
[17:11] look at the false corrupt fruits of the
[17:13] Roman Catholic church the church that
[17:15] first pushed the Trinity Dogma so hard I
[17:18] think I had eight problems with the
[17:20] Trinity Dogma in my 2021 book so I'll
[17:22] read those here briefly first and most
[17:25] decimating to its validity the Trinity
[17:27] Dogma adds to the Bible as we've already
[17:29] said second Jesus and his Apostles
[17:31] taught and affirmed pure Hebrew
[17:33] monotheism rather than trinitarianism
[17:36] third the Athenian Creed or 6th Century
[17:39] trinitarian confessional contains
[17:40] multiple contradictions to Biblical
[17:42] teaching on the godhead and there are
[17:45] six examples of how the Creed
[17:47] contradicts the Bible in this section
[17:50] fourth major Bible contradictions and
[17:53] inconsistencies exist among
[17:55] trinitarians fifth the early
[17:57] trinitarians did not affirm that the
[17:58] holy hly Spirit was divine until the
[18:00] Council of Constantinople in 381 ad six
[18:05] trinitarian images and artwork are often
[18:07] deceptive creating false representations
[18:10] of the godhead seventh trinitarians use
[18:13] two fear tactics to persuade others to
[18:15] believe in the Trinity heresy and hell
[18:18] and then eighth God sent a prophet named
[18:19] William Brenham to warn the Christians
[18:21] about the false Trinity
[18:23] Dogma the fifth bullet point was William
[18:25] Brenham proclaimed himself to be the
[18:27] angel of Revelation 3:14 the angel to
[18:31] the lean church and that's true I don't
[18:33] believe he did it directly as far as I
[18:35] know so please correct me if there's
[18:36] quotes where he directly says he is that
[18:38] angel but as far as I can find he did it
[18:40] indirectly in the church age book that
[18:42] was released in December
[18:44] 1965 first of all there would be nothing
[18:47] wrong if brother baham did say he was
[18:49] fulfilling the scripture of Revelation
[18:50] 3:14 because that's what many prophets
[18:53] did such as John the Baptist in Matthew
[18:55] 3:3 John said I am the voice crying in
[18:59] the wilderness prepare you the way of
[19:00] the Lord John said I fulfilling Isaiah
[19:03] 40:3 so so even if brother Ram did say
[19:06] he was the Fulfillment of Revelation
[19:08] 3:14 there' be nothing wrong with that
[19:10] as long as it was true which we believe
[19:12] it is true he did fulfill the role of
[19:15] the seventh angel to the seventh and
[19:17] final Church age some may find it
[19:20] interesting though that in January of
[19:22] 1961 brother Braham denied that he had
[19:24] anything to do with the seventh Church
[19:26] age messenger it's from the questions
[19:28] aners sermon let's listen to the quote
[19:30] now if you'll notice and I Little Willy
[19:33] out there put my name on that star out
[19:35] there and that's the reason I passed it
[19:37] over you see cuz I I don't think now I'm
[19:39] going to be honest as I can be I don't
[19:42] think I'd have anything to do with that
[19:44] messenger see that's right I believe
[19:46] that I'm maybe be sent for a part this
[19:49] church to help build that message up to
[19:51] a place to where it would when this
[19:53] Forerunner comes that he will come but I
[19:56] believe me being what I I am I am uh uh
[20:01] uh I believe that I have the message of
[20:04] the day I believe that this is the light
[20:06] of the day and I believe it's pointing
[20:09] to that time coming you see I believe
[20:12] that the message that he said down there
[20:14] uh the message that you have but then in
[20:17] the church age book in chapter N9 on the
[20:19] latery in church age brother brand
[20:22] basically puts all these Bible verses
[20:24] about his ministry together to say that
[20:26] the seventh Church age messenger is also
[20:29] the prophet of Revelation
[20:30] 10:7 he starts this section about the
[20:33] messenger by quoting Revelation 10:7 so
[20:36] he connects Revelation 3:14 the seventh
[20:39] angel with the 7th Angel Revelation 10:7
[20:42] it must be a human Prophet I have videos
[20:45] about that if you'd like to watch that
[20:47] and then there's a quite a long section
[20:49] where brother Ram uses the following
[20:50] bible verses to show how the seventh
[20:53] angel of Revelation 3:14 is the same
[20:56] seventh angel of Revelation 10:7 he uses
[20:59] Amos 3 6 and 7 Revelation 10 3 and 4
[21:02] about the seven Thunders Matthew 1710
[21:05] and 11 Jesus's words about Elijah will
[21:08] surely come and restore all things and
[21:11] then Malachi 45 and 6 Elijah turning the
[21:14] hearts of the children back to the
[21:16] apostolic fathers and also in my 2021
[21:19] book I go through three or four reasons
[21:22] why the angel of Revelation 3:14 has to
[21:25] be a human man it cannot be a Heavenly
[21:27] angel that has Heavenly attributes so
[21:30] let's go through those briefly here by
[21:31] God's grace it's on pages 409 and
[21:35] 410 the first reason is God does not
[21:38] tell human prophets to write handwritten
[21:40] letters to Heavenly Angels remember
[21:42] Revelation 2:1 unto the angel of the
[21:45] Church of Ephesus write why would Jesus
[21:47] tell John to author a handwritten letter
[21:49] to a Heavenly Angel at Ephesus God
[21:52] doesn't do that God speaks directly to
[21:55] Heavenly angels from his throne second
[21:58] the seven angels are symbolic of human
[22:00] preachers because men are sometimes
[22:01] referred to as angels in scripture such
[22:04] as John being called a messenger by
[22:06] Jesus in Matthew 11:10 the word angel
[22:08] means messenger David is twice called an
[22:11] angel of God in 1st Samuel 29:9 2 Samuel
[22:15] 19:27 Paul says the Galatians received
[22:18] him as an angel of God in Galatians 4:14
[22:22] and there's a prophet called an angel in
[22:25] Revelation 22: 8 and 9 the third fact
[22:28] fact is that God uses men to help save
[22:30] men Angels assist men but men are God's
[22:33] primary tool for sharing his way to
[22:36] Salvation and fourthly notice the
[22:38] location of these Seven Stars or these
[22:40] seven angels they're in Jesus's right
[22:42] hand both Moses and Jesus defined God's
[22:45] right hand as his power and authority
[22:47] reserved for Christ and not Angels
[22:50] according to Hebrews
[22:52] 1:13 and Jesus Promised his servants his
[22:55] men His prophets and apostles would
[22:58] inherit God's power to witness his
[23:00] resurrection in Acts 1:8 and acts
[23:04] 4:11 and the sixth and final bullet
[23:06] point is that brother Ram claimed to be
[23:08] Elijah and that's true I agree brother
[23:10] Ram did claim to have the spirit of
[23:12] Elijah I don't know if there's a quote
[23:14] where brother Braham specifically said
[23:15] that but again like the seventh Church
[23:18] age messenger he alluded to it I made a
[23:20] video recently about how brother Braham
[23:22] said the spirit of Elijah is the Lord
[23:24] Jesus Christ it's the Holy Ghost with
[23:26] certain attributes upon man the spirit
[23:29] of Elijah is simply the holy spirit with
[23:31] certain attributes anointing a man and
[23:33] brother R was one of those five men who
[23:35] had the spirit of Elijah or will have
[23:37] the spirit of Elijah the five are Elijah
[23:41] Elisha John the Baptist William brandham
[23:43] and then the Elijah with Moses in
[23:45] Revelation 11 also I made a video about
[23:48] William brandham as the messenger to the
[23:50] seven Church age and there's five
[23:52] attributes that he has that both John
[23:54] the Baptist and Elijah had I'll go
[23:58] through those here briefly they all
[23:59] spoke with thus sayith the Lord as I
[24:01] mentioned earlier brother random spoke
[24:03] with thus sayith the Lord at least six
[24:04] times and it came to pass they were all
[24:06] men of the Wilderness Elijah John the
[24:08] Baptist and brother Brandon was a man of
[24:10] the Wilderness they all three rebuked
[24:12] immoral women Elijah rebuked Jezebel
[24:16] John the Baptist rebuked herodias and
[24:19] brother Ron rebuked Marilyn Monroe sexy
[24:21] dressed women jacyn Kennedy and more
[24:24] fourth all the men condemn the false
[24:26] religions of their time Elijah condemned
[24:29] Ahab and Jezebel's false prophets John
[24:32] the Baptist condemned the Pharisees
[24:34] Sadducees calling them a brood of
[24:37] serpents a den of vipers and brother Ram
[24:39] condemned all the denominations of his
[24:41] day he even indicted them in
[24:44] 1963 for crucifying the Lord Jesus aresh
[24:48] in the spiritual realm as Hebrews
[24:50] chapter 6 speaks of when the modern
[24:52] denominational churches disagree with
[24:54] the word of God or teach a false
[24:56] Doctrine they're crucifying the fact of
[24:58] the Holy Ghost to the people and Fifth
[25:00] and finally all three men had human
[25:03] weaknesses when the anointing left
[25:06] Elijah ran a fear of Jezebel John the
[25:09] Baptist wondered in prison if Jesus was
[25:12] the Christ or should he look for another
[25:14] and brother R would say when the
[25:15] anointing left him that he was no
[25:16] Prophet but yet of course he was under
[25:18] the anointing he would say that he was a
[25:19] prophet of
[25:21] God in
[25:23] closing friends hope this video was a
[25:25] blessing by the grace of God my simple
[25:26] humble reactions to Justice Peter's
[25:29] accusations against brother William
[25:30] brandham over the years I've enjoyed
[25:32] some of Justin Peter's videos especially
[25:34] how he exposes false modern day prophets
[25:37] and all the corruption among these
[25:39] famous but false preachers but in the
[25:41] case of William brandom I humbly
[25:42] disagree he's completely wrong brother
[25:44] brandom was a genuine prophet of God
[25:47] before we close I'm going to play a
[25:48] video portion from the video I made
[25:50] about brother brandham and the
[25:51] controversy about him wearing shorts at
[25:53] the end I put six reasons why I believe
[25:56] brother Bram is a genuine prophet of God
[25:57] so I'm going to put that video portion
[25:59] in here just to remind our friends about
[26:01] the certainty of God vindicating William
[26:04] brandham as a genuine prophet of God
[26:06] here's that clip before finishing this
[26:09] video Let Me Again State the absolute
[26:11] proof that brother Brenham was a genuine
[26:13] prophet of God first there are six
[26:15] verses that declare this authorative
[26:18] phrase that Jesus must remain in Heaven
[26:20] until God has turned the hearts of the
[26:23] end time Believers back to the apostolic
[26:25] faith and these are the six scriptures
[26:27] that God used brother random to fulfill
[26:29] they are acts 3:20 and 21 Matthew 1711
[26:33] and 12 Malachi 45 and 6 Revelation
[26:37] 107-11 Amos 3:7 and Luke 17:30 and again
[26:41] friends remember no accuser brother
[26:43] brandom has read my 2021 book and tried
[26:46] to refute the Bible truth in that book
[26:49] it's over 800 Pages proving brother
[26:51] random was a genuine prophet of God you
[26:53] know why they haven't because they're
[26:55] afraid of the truth and they're so
[26:57] disingenuous they won't read research
[26:58] the other side of this subject that
[27:00] proves to me they're not serious
[27:02] researchers they're not honest
[27:04] researchers and they're very
[27:06] disingenuous the second reason brother
[27:08] Bram revealed the 12 New Testament
[27:10] Mysteries there's only 12 doctrines
[27:12] called mysteries in the New Testament
[27:13] and brother brand revealed all of them
[27:15] six of them he gave us thus sayith the
[27:17] Lord for the third point is brother Ram
[27:19] gave us eight other Pauline doctrines
[27:21] with thus sayith the Lord the fourth
[27:23] point is that there are six fulfilled
[27:26] thus sayith the Lord prophecies from
[27:27] Brother
[27:28] these people that say none of brother
[27:30] Ram's prophecies were foretold in
[27:32] advance they're foolish they're ignorant
[27:34] they don't know what they're talking
[27:35] about shame on them I have a video that
[27:38] shows six undeniable prophecies thus
[27:42] sayi the Lord that have come to pass the
[27:44] fifth point is there's 14 Pauline
[27:47] doctrines that brother brandham restored
[27:49] to the bride of Christ the New Testament
[27:51] Holy Ghost filled church every other
[27:53] church denomination every other Church
[27:55] Gathering is guilty of breaking one or
[27:57] all 14 of these this proves the true
[28:00] Holy Ghost filled Believers that follow
[28:02] brother's message are the Bride of Jesus
[28:04] Christ because they keep all the Paul's
[28:06] gospel and Paul said we'd be judged by
[28:08] his gospel in Romans
[28:10] 2:16 and then Paul said if anyone adds
[28:13] or takes away their curse in Galatians 1
[28:16] 6-12 again proving brother R was a
[28:18] genuine prophet of God because He
[28:19] restored the truth from Paul's gospel
[28:22] that churches had failed to preach and
[28:24] He restored it to the true bride of
[28:25] Christ today and six and finally brother
[28:29] Ram had many Supernatural Miracles
[28:31] healings and discernments undeniable as
[28:35] these solders and Warriors of the faith
[28:37] who had these experiences die off we're
[28:39] going to have to do a better job and I
[28:41] mean we as message Believers of
[28:42] reminding the people of all these
[28:44] testimonies our family right now is
[28:46] reading the generations book there's 38
[28:48] individuals who give testimonies in
[28:50] there and each one had thus sayith the
[28:51] Lord's from Brother brandham dreams and
[28:53] Visions discernments all from brother
[28:55] brandham and never one time did it fail
[28:58] and that's what I believe never one time
[29:00] did thus say the Lord fail coming from
[29:01] brother brandham did Brother Bram fail
[29:03] the brown bear Vision yes he told us
[29:05] that but on my video about the brown
[29:07] bear Vision there's 10 people some of
[29:09] them were prophets who failed Visions as
[29:12] well or disobeyed Visions they disobeyed
[29:14] thus sayi the Lord visions that God gave
[29:16] them so I'll put a link in the
[29:18] description to that video and also put a
[29:20] link to the video about the six
[29:22] fulfilled thus sayith the Lord
[29:23] prophecies remember brother Ram's
[29:25] accusers will always point us away from
[29:27] the Bible revelations that God gave to
[29:29] brother brandham and they'll nitpick
[29:31] brother bram's life they'll strain at a
[29:33] knat and swallow camel but what I
[29:35] mentioned here at the end this is what
[29:37] the accusers want us to forget about or
[29:39] try to distract us from all these
[29:41] absolute undeniable proofs that brother
[29:43] Bram was a genuine prophet of God
[29:46] reminds us of how Paul told Timothy Paul
[29:49] was thankful that Timothy was not
[29:50] ashamed of Paul Christ prisoner and
[29:53] that's what we say today we're not
[29:54] ashamed of brother brandom he was Christ
[29:56] prisoner of course he was a sin are
[29:58] saved by grace just like all of us but
[30:00] he was a mighty prophet of God that's
[30:02] undeniable and that's what both of my
[30:04] books have been all about brother bram's
[30:06] Ministry and restoring the modesty
[30:08] standards brother bram's Ministry
[30:10] finishing the mysteries of God
[30:11] Revelation 10:7 Amos 3:7 so we're
[30:15] thankful friends for God sending his
[30:16] Prophet brother William brandham it's a
[30:18] joy to defend the revelation of Jesus
[30:20] Christ from the scriptures as Paul
[30:22] defended the revelation of the Lord
[30:24] Jesus Christ and then God restored that
[30:26] Revelation through brother William
[30:28] brandham in Matthew 10:41 Jesus said he
[30:31] that receiveth a prophet in the name of
[30:32] a prophet shall receive a prophet's
[30:34] reward I don't fully understand this
[30:36] verse but I can clearly see in my life
[30:39] because I've received William brandham
[30:41] as a genuine prophet of God I've seen
[30:42] many rewards for that especially in the
[30:44] spiritual Realm by the grace of God
[30:46] brother BR pointed us to the absolute
[30:48] the word of God he raised our faith to
[30:50] believe in the Supernatural power of the
[30:52] Lord Jesus Christ He restored the
[30:54] apostolic Doctrine the Apostolic Faith
[30:57] by the grace of God
[30:58] God used him to finish the mysteries of
[31:00] God and we're beneficiaries of that the
[31:03] 12 New Testament Mysteries are likened
[31:04] unto the bread that was in the Holy
[31:06] place the bread of his face as the Bible
[31:09] calls in the Old Testament and so as we
[31:11] Feast weekly on the word of God it's as
[31:14] if we're eating at the king's table
[31:16] eating God's fresh Mana God's fresh
[31:18] Revelation God's fresh shoe bread we're
[31:21] eating God's word in the presence of the
[31:23] king and this Supernatural bread is
[31:26] giving us Supernatural strength to
[31:27] overcome from Leo deia by the grace of
[31:29] God if you have any questions concerns
[31:32] or testimonies about this video please
[31:33] contact
[31:35] me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[31:38] the desire of your heart
