[0:00] [Music]
[0:03] you don't have to wonder will I make it
[0:05] oh no it isn't whether I'll make it it's
[0:09] already made for me Christ in me has
[0:13] made it himself and I just trust in his
[0:18] anchor alone what a
[0:21] [Music]
[0:26] wonderful I remember when I was first
[0:29] converted and I begin to see the working
[0:33] of the spirit and how that some could
[0:36] just impersonate the real genuine Holy
[0:41] Spirit into such a way that it would why
[0:45] it would just impossible to tell which
[0:47] was right and wrong
[0:49] Harley and I seen a man that I knew and
[0:53] I and by discernment I knew that man was
[0:57] living with another man
[1:00] wife and here he was standing there
[1:03] speaking with tongues and interpreting
[1:06] and everything and giving messages and
[1:08] it and I got the other fell to a place
[1:11] to where I could speak to him a few
[1:13] moments and a real genuine
[1:16] Christian and I thought how can that
[1:20] Spirit The Same Spirit work I that's
[1:25] when I first seen Pentecost and it was
[1:28] at Mishawaka Indiana
[1:30] and I tell you it's certainly I thought
[1:32] for the first few hours I was there I
[1:34] was among angels and the next few hours
[1:37] I thought I was among demons when I seen
[1:40] that seen these two men one give a
[1:42] message one interpret I never heard
[1:44] speaking in tongues and things like that
[1:46] before I watched those Spirits how they
[1:49] move I thought oh my while the great
[1:52] Millennium has
[1:54] begun and then when I got a chance on
[1:56] the outside to talk to one of them and
[1:59] could tell what he was made from there
[2:02] was one as evil as he could be and and
[2:06] that night I watched him again and I
[2:08] thought oh get me away from here I can't
[2:11] understand how this is and I seen those
[2:14] things were in the Bible but here was
[2:17] one doing it that didn't have the spirit
[2:19] of God and the other one doing it that
[2:20] did have the spirit of God then I was
[2:23] all confused and I just left the whole
[2:25] thing go and years later after the flood
[2:29] was over
[2:30] I was going walking up the road going to
[2:32] Greens Mill Mr ier the state senator
[2:36] comes here to church he met me on the
[2:38] road and he put his arms around me he
[2:39] said Billy what does Christ mean to you
[2:42] now my father was gone my brother was
[2:44] gone and my wife was gone my baby was
[2:47] gone and I I said what does he mean I
[2:49] said Mr ier he means more than life to
[2:54] me I said something has happened within
[2:56] me a few years ago cry came to my heart
[3:02] and I I it's just become more than I am
[3:05] myself it's just something that's
[3:08] happened it wasn't because I was
[3:10] religious it wasn't it's just something
[3:13] that God through the grace did for me
[3:16] and I said though he would slay me I
[3:19] trust him just the same and if I was in
[3:22] hell and there was such a thing his love
[3:24] in hell I'd still love him that's all
[3:27] it's something in here he's right I
[3:30] deserve every punishment that I ever got
[3:34] you do the same amen but if that anchor
[3:38] that
[3:39] something that anchor of love of God
[3:42] that holds in the human heart other
[3:46] things become secondarily sitting on a
[3:49] log up there I was praying about
[3:51] something else and my Bible come open
[3:55] and I was reading in over in the book of
[3:58] Hebrews the 6th chapter and I was
[4:00] reading there how that it is impossible
[4:03] for those who were once enlightened and
[4:05] made partakers of the Holy Spirit see as
[4:08] they fall away to renew themselves again
[4:10] unto repentance for the rain cometh off
[4:14] upon the Earth to water it to dress it
[4:17] or which is prepared but that which is
[4:19] nine to rejection thorns and thistles
[4:22] which is nine to rejection is to be
[4:25] burned and the Holy Spirit kept speaking
[4:27] to me about that what is is that I'd
[4:31] read it over again and then a vision
[4:33] comes and I saw the world standing
[4:35] before me turning it was all disc it up
[4:39] and like cloud and ready for to plant
[4:42] and there went a man by white sowing
[4:45] seeds and after he went around the
[4:47] curvature of the earth another man come
[4:49] and black sewing seeds behind him and
[4:52] when the seeds there were a good man
[4:53] sold come up was wheat and the bad black
[4:57] man solded the seeds come up and dressed
[4:59] in black it come up and it was Weeds and
[5:03] oh one was contrary to the other a great
[5:05] drought comes in the vision and the
[5:08] little wheat bowed its head it was just
[5:10] so thirsty for a drink and the the weed
[5:13] bowed its head it was thirsty for a
[5:15] drink then a great Cloud come over and
[5:18] the rains come down and the little wheat
[5:21] raised up and begin to scream praise the
[5:23] Lord praise the Lord he was so happy to
[5:26] get that water and the little weed
[5:28] raised up holler praise the Lord praise
[5:30] the Lord for the same water then I
[5:34] understood see there it is the holy
[5:37] spirit will fall but by their fruits
[5:41] they are known said the Lord Jesus see
[5:44] not by the reaction of the spirit
[5:46] whether they heal the sick or whether
[5:48] they speak with tongues or whether they
[5:50] sing in the spirit or whether they
[5:52] Rejoice this way or that they can do all
[5:55] that and still be lost it's your life
[5:59] with with then you a born again
[6:02] experience now Paul was trying to get
[6:05] this to those Corinthians I'm more over
[6:08] Brethren I would have wouldn't have you
[6:10] ignorant how that our fathers were all
[6:14] under the cloud and passed through the
[6:16] sea and were baptized unto
[6:20] Moses every one of them went into the
[6:23] Wilderness Jesus said not all that say
[6:27] Lord Lord will ler in but the one that
[6:30] doeth the will of My Father which is in
[6:32] heaven it isn't what you say you could
[6:34] preach the gospel and still be
[6:36] lost certainly this is not just little
[6:40] kid stuff this is
[6:43] absolutely it's Dean and Christianity is
[6:47] not to be just a little like fabulous
[6:49] thing like well I'll go over to church
[6:51] and I know it's my duty to go that's not
[6:54] Christianity brother Christianity isn't
[6:58] is something that God has
[7:01] done God has chosen you in Christ and
[7:07] presented you as a love gift to Christ
[7:11] and it's God's calling election and if
[7:14] we have the opportunity to become that
[7:17] type of person and turn it down for
[7:20] little old things of the world now
[7:22] listen as we go
[7:24] on and all did eat that same
[7:30] spiritual
[7:32] Mana did you hear that the third
[7:35] verse and all did eat the same spiritual
[7:40] Mana what's he speaking of the rituals
[7:44] of the church people come to church and
[7:47] say they have repented and are baptized
[7:50] unto Christ taking on the name of the
[7:53] Lord Jesus and they did that in the
[7:55] wilderness also Paul said that's what
[7:58] the Cor have done they come in and was
[8:01] baptized unto Christ took on Christ
[8:04] outwardly
[8:06] professionally had taken him on
[8:08] intellectually had accepted him but
[8:11] brother it's a lot more than
[8:14] intellectuals it goes beyond that it
[8:17] goes to a a genuine
[8:21] birth not just the mental conception and
[8:25] emotional work but a birth an experience
[8:30] something that goes from down deep into
[8:33] the heart and change of the innermost
[8:37] being that makes you do things that you
[8:40] would not have done other words it makes
[8:43] you love those who are
[8:46] unlovable it makes you act different
[8:49] than you ever thought that you would act
[8:51] and when situations arise it's your
[8:54] anchor amen you don't have to wonder
[8:57] will I make it oh no
[9:00] it isn't whether I'll make it it's
[9:02] already made for me Christ in me has
[9:06] made it himself and I just trust in his
[9:10] anchor alone what a
[9:15] wonderful notice they all took
[9:19] [Music]
[9:20] communion that life that was in we know
[9:24] that it was a natural process because it
[9:28] was
[9:29] Frost like that rained from Heaven
[9:32] little Wafers with honey on them the
[9:35] wafer was just a little like a cracker a
[9:37] little cookie and had honey over the top
[9:40] of it and they all were partakers of
[9:44] that everyone passed through the Red Sea
[9:48] and was baptized through the cloud and
[9:52] through the sea un to Moses following
[9:56] his instructions as God's servant they
[9:58] were all baptized unto him they were all
[10:01] followers as we are today led by the
[10:04] Holy Spirit the great instructor of the
[10:08] Christian church we are LED through to
[10:11] water baptism and he said they all taken
[10:15] of the same
[10:17] [Music]
[10:18] Mana what did it do that Mana fell far
[10:22] Kora and for his group just as same as
[10:26] it did for Moses Caleb and Joshua
[10:30] they were all mixed together all
[10:34] partakers of baptism all partakers of
[10:38] membership all partakers of confession
[10:42] now all partakers of the
[10:48] communion you get it look at that solemn
[10:53] warning and Tabernacle folks get that
[10:57] way down deep
[11:00] amen remember it's yours Eternal
[11:05] destination hangs right
[11:08] there don't just pass it by like a
[11:11] little flutter or something this is
[11:14] something we must come respective to
[11:19] it's something that means whether we
[11:21] live Hereafter or
[11:25] not oh god look into our hearts
[11:29] examine Us by thy Holy Spirit and let us
[11:32] see this morning if there's any evil
[11:34] thing in us if there is take it away
[11:37] father we now lay it on the altar to
[11:39] walk away and leave it there if it's
[11:42] idleness if it's temper if it's
[11:46] indifference if it's neglecting if it's
[11:49] whatever it may be if it's hatred if
[11:52] it's malice if it's strive if it's
[11:54] whatever it may be oh God take it from
[11:59] from us today and at this coming revival
[12:02] may we be just so full of your charm
[12:06] Lord until many will come in and be
[12:09] saved the little Community here where
[12:12] we've tried so hard the first Revival
[12:14] now in 10 years out of H now I pray that
[12:17] you'll give us that real real spirit in
[12:21] our hearts and may it anchor there for
[12:24] eternity granted Lord
