[0:02] he said there was a test of a prophet if
[0:05] a prophet prophesied and that what he
[0:07] said come to pass and
[0:10] hearing but if it don't come to pass
[0:12] then God hasn't spoke that's all so
[0:14] don't don't fear Him that's
[0:17] right greetings friends in the matchless
[0:19] name of the Lord Jesus Christ what is a
[0:22] new testament prophet in this video I'll
[0:25] explain the requirements for a new
[0:27] testament Prophet by the grace of God
[0:30] this is the fourth video in the series
[0:32] of five videos on the five preaching
[0:34] gifts of the five full ministry
[0:36] according to Ephesians 4: 11 by God's
[0:39] grace we've already covered the Apostle
[0:41] the pastor and the
[0:43] [Music]
[0:45] Evangelist this video will cover the
[0:47] prophet and the final video will be on
[0:48] the teacher I'll begin with the
[0:50] definition of a prophet in the Hebrew
[0:53] lexicon the prophet is the spokesman or
[0:58] speaker for the Lord according to the
[1:00] lexicon so in both the Old Testament and
[1:02] the New Testament the prophet speaks for
[1:04] the Lord the prophet speaks in the name
[1:06] of the Lord the prophet will say thus
[1:08] sayith the Lord or the prophet will say
[1:10] something is spoken in the name of the
[1:12] Lord I want to start with two important
[1:15] points about prophets before I get into
[1:17] the six qualifications of a new
[1:19] testament Prophet the first point is
[1:22] that women cannot be New Testament
[1:24] preaching prophets but they can have any
[1:27] of the nine gifts of the Holy Ghost
[1:28] found in 1 Corinthians chapter 12 one of
[1:31] which is the gift of Prophecy women in
[1:34] the Old Testament and New Testament
[1:36] could have the gifts of Prophecy such as
[1:38] Miriam and Deborah in the Old Testament
[1:40] and Philip's four virgin daughters who
[1:42] prophesied according to the book of Acts
[1:44] if you like more teaching on this you
[1:45] can reference my video no women Angels
[1:47] no women preachers I'll leave a link in
[1:49] the description by the grace of God a
[1:52] second point is we need to differentiate
[1:54] between a preaching prophet and the gift
[1:57] of Prophecy the preaching prophets found
[2:00] in Ephesians 4:1 but the gift of
[2:03] Prophecy is in 1 Corinthians 12:10 to
[2:06] another the working of Miracles to
[2:07] another prophecy so the Bible teaches
[2:10] there's a difference between a new
[2:11] testament Prophet preacher who is a
[2:14] spiritual leader in the fiveo ministry
[2:16] and this new testament preaching Prophet
[2:19] can only be a man the New Testament
[2:21] differentiates the preaching Prophet
[2:23] from the man or woman who has the gift
[2:25] of Prophecy those who have the gifts of
[2:27] Prophecy are not leaders in the Church
[2:30] like a new testament preaching Prophet
[2:32] we can still call those men and women
[2:34] with the gift of Prophecy by the term
[2:36] prophets because we understand the
[2:38] difference between a preacher leader
[2:41] Prophet versus a person who has the gift
[2:43] of Prophecy the gifts of Prophecy which
[2:47] can be men or women need to be judged by
[2:49] two or three Witnesses when their
[2:51] prophecies are given according to 1
[2:53] Corinthians 14
[2:55] 27-29 the Bible said if they speak in
[2:57] the unknown tongue Let It Be two or at
[3:00] the most by three and let one interpret
[3:04] verse 29 says let the prophet speak two
[3:06] or three and let the other judge so the
[3:09] gifts of Prophecy must be judged in the
[3:12] congregation of the Saints when those
[3:14] prophecies go forth or if they're shared
[3:17] also maybe dreams are shared or
[3:18] something like that they must also be
[3:20] judged they're judged by those who have
[3:22] the gift of discernment which is another
[3:25] of the nine gifts of the Holy Ghost
[3:27] according to 1 Corinthians chap 12 but a
[3:29] preaching Prophet or five-fold Ministry
[3:32] Prophet isn't judged by two or three
[3:34] Witnesses brother ran told us this in
[3:36] the Rapture sermon 1965 he said nobody
[3:38] set before a prophet because he was
[3:41] absolutely the word of God he was that
[3:43] word in his day brother Bram said the
[3:45] gift of prophecy two or three has to set
[3:47] and judge whether that's right or not
[3:50] for the church can receive it let's
[3:52] listen to the quote prophets there's
[3:54] such a thing as gift of Prophecy in a
[3:56] church but a prophet is predestinated
[3:58] and for our d for the hour yes sir now
[4:02] if a prophecy Goes Forth two or three
[4:04] has to set and judge where that's right
[4:05] or enough where the church can receive
[4:07] it but nobody set before a prophet
[4:09] because he was he was absolutely the
[4:11] word of God he was that word in his day
[4:14] you see God reflect now God has promised
[4:17] to send us that again in the last days
[4:19] to bring that bride out of that
[4:21] ecclesiastical
[4:23] mess and the only way it can be done as
[4:26] we'll get to later though the preaching
[4:29] prophet must be tested as brother random
[4:31] said so a preaching Prophet isn't judged
[4:33] by two or three Witnesses but a
[4:35] preaching Prophet is tested to be a
[4:38] prophet as brother random taught this
[4:40] lines up with Deuteronomy chapter 18
[4:42] which is the test of a prophecy a
[4:44] prophecy that comes to pass proves the
[4:46] man is a preaching prophet of course
[4:49] that can also be applied to those who
[4:51] have the gift of Prophecy their
[4:52] prophecies must come to pass it's also
[4:55] important to remember though that some
[4:56] prophecies that are given by prophets
[4:58] are not fulfilled while the prophet is
[5:00] alive such as Isaiah's prophecy about
[5:03] the Rapture in Isaiah
[5:04] 25:8 this has still not come to pass and
[5:07] it's been well over 2,500 years since
[5:10] this prophecy was given by Isaiah I
[5:12] think I'll share that quote right now
[5:14] where brother ROM said Deuteronomy 18 is
[5:16] also the test of a prophet so again a
[5:18] prophet a preaching Prophet isn't judged
[5:21] by two or three Witnesses but a
[5:23] preaching Prophet his prophecies are
[5:25] given the test of a prophet that they
[5:27] come to pass brother Ram said this in
[5:29] the signs of his coming April 7th 1962
[5:32] let's listen to the quote now now God in
[5:36] all ages gave the people signs bear
[5:40] record of it Deuteronomy 18:22 also 1331
[5:44] if you want to put these scriptures down
[5:47] uh God gave Israel a an assured sign he
[5:51] said now God sends his word By His
[5:54] prophets is that right it's exactly what
[5:56] the Bible said the word of the Lord come
[5:58] to the prophets he said there was a test
[6:00] of a prophet if a prophet prophesied and
[6:03] that what he said come to pass then hear
[6:06] him but if it don't come to pass then
[6:08] God hasn't spoke that's all so don't
[6:10] don't fear Him that's right there be one
[6:14] among you spiritual Prophet I the Lord
[6:16] God will make myself know to him in
[6:18] Visions speak to him in dreams if it
[6:21] comes to pass then I that's me speaking
[6:23] sure God ain't going to lie you know he
[6:26] can't lie there's nothing in him to lie
[6:28] he's the Fountain of all Purity all
[6:31] truth is God so it can't be a lie come
[6:34] from God he's perfect pure so not's get
[6:37] into the six qualifications of a prophet
[6:39] and of course there could be more this
[6:41] is just a simple list I've come up with
[6:43] over the years I've used the same list
[6:46] of qualifications on two previous
[6:49] videos three Prophecies of brother
[6:51] William
[6:52] brandham and six thus sayi the Lords
[6:55] that have come to
[6:57] pass the first qualification is a thus
[6:59] sayith the Lord prophecy that comes to
[7:02] pass this is according to Deuteronomy
[7:04] 18:
[7:05] 21-22 how shall we know the word which
[7:08] the Lord hath not spoken when a prophet
[7:10] speaketh in the name of the Lord if the
[7:12] thing follow not nor come to pass that
[7:14] is the thing which a Lord hath not
[7:16] spoken but the prophet has spoken it
[7:19] presumptuously Thou shalt not be afraid
[7:21] of him also James 510 tells us we must
[7:25] remember the prophets who have spoken to
[7:27] us in the name of the Lord so a new
[7:30] testament Prophet must foretell
[7:32] something in the name of the Lord and it
[7:33] must come to pass God's Prophet William
[7:36] brandom did this on at least six
[7:37] occasions likely many more I'll leave a
[7:40] link to the description of I'll leave a
[7:42] link in the description to this video
[7:44] and again remember brother Ram says this
[7:46] was the test of a
[7:48] prophet the second qualification is a
[7:51] prophet reveals Secrets according to
[7:53] Amos
[7:54] 3:7 surely the Lord God will do nothing
[7:57] except he re reveal his secret unto his
[7:59] servants the prophets this is easily
[8:02] seen in prophets like Abraham Moses
[8:06] Isaiah Jeremiah and Ezekiel just to name
[8:08] a few but every Prophet was given
[8:10] Secrets or the mind of God to reveal to
[8:12] the people brother random of course
[8:14] revealed The Mystery of the Seven Seals
[8:17] and these Revelations of the Seven Seals
[8:19] were the seven Thunders from Revelation
[8:22] 10 and I have a whole video series on
[8:24] the Seven Seals proving brother Ram did
[8:25] not plagiarize them they were genuine
[8:27] Revelations from the Holy Ghost from the
[8:29] Lord Jesus Christ there's over 38
[8:32] differences between brother am's
[8:34] Revelation on the Seven Seals from
[8:36] Clarence Larin and Charles Tas Russell
[8:39] brother random also finished the mystery
[8:41] of God the 12 Bible defined New
[8:43] Testament Mysteries six of them were
[8:45] spoken with thus sayith the Lord and no
[8:48] other preacher even comes close to this
[8:50] so we thank the Lord that he's given us
[8:52] a genuine Prophet to reveal Bible
[8:56] Secrets the third qualification is a
[8:58] Godly life with with good fruits this is
[9:01] found in Matthew 7:1 15-23 Jesus talks
[9:05] about a false prophet he said you'll
[9:07] know them by their fruits false prophets
[9:09] have corrupt fruits or sinful lives true
[9:12] prophets have Godly lives Paul also said
[9:15] a true Prophet will not abuse his power
[9:18] in the gospel 1 Corinthians
[9:20] 9:18 I make the gospel of Christ without
[9:23] charge that abuse not my power in the
[9:26] gospel so brother random lived a Godly
[9:29] Christian life that's undeniable he kept
[9:32] all the word of God another Godly fruit
[9:34] I like to point out is Hebrews 10:24 and
[9:37] 25 a true prophet of God will stay in
[9:41] fellowship with churches a true prophet
[9:43] of God will go to church so this is one
[9:46] proof uh brother bram's son Joseph
[9:48] brandham is not a prophet he does not
[9:49] physically gather more with the
[9:51] Believers as we see that day approaching
[9:54] a prophet of God does not take years off
[9:56] from physically attending church St Paul
[9:58] never did that brother brandham never
[10:00] did that and so this is a proof that
[10:02] brother brandham was a genuine prophet
[10:04] of God but his son Joseph brandham is
[10:05] not a prophet of
[10:07] God another point I want to make is that
[10:09] in the Old Testament prophets could be
[10:11] alone in the wilderness like John the
[10:12] Baptist or Elijah and away from the
[10:15] church or Saints or Believers but the
[10:18] New Testament we taught different New
[10:21] Testament Believers and Prophets and any
[10:23] preacher in the fivefold ministry will
[10:25] gather more as we see that day
[10:26] approaching again according to Hebrews
[10:28] 10:2
[10:30] 24-2 and brother Ram learned this lesson
[10:32] in standing the Gap his sermon from June
[10:35] 23rd
[10:37] 1965 brother brandom said he had made an
[10:39] excuse in his mind he was going to go
[10:41] live out in the wilderness in Colorado
[10:43] but the Holy Spirit corrected him and
[10:45] said he wasn't an Old Testament prophet
[10:46] he was a prophet in the apostolic form
[10:49] with many Apostolic gifts so God kept
[10:52] his Prophet from leaving the church and
[10:54] going out in the wilderness I'll play
[10:56] that quote brother brandom says he was
[10:58] told by the Lord but that was the Old
[10:59] Testament prophets you've been called to
[11:02] a much higher office than that in the
[11:04] apostolic form let's listen to the quote
[11:07] said your wife will go to she won't live
[11:10] up in them Hills like
[11:12] that and you'll become a
[11:16] bum just as the dream showed you
[11:19] was I said I don't want to be
[11:23] that but the I don't want to have to
[11:28] live like like that I I want to do
[11:31] something different but I I was told
[11:34] that that you'd call me to be a a
[11:39] prophet and I want to live in the
[11:41] wilderness like the prophet but I was
[11:44] using my own excuse so I can hunt my own
[11:47] good and he said but that was the
[11:51] prophets of the Old Testament you've
[11:54] been called to be that in a much higher
[11:57] office than that Hallelujah he said you
[11:59] have more gifts besides that you was
[12:02] called to pray for the sick and to
[12:04] preach the gospel and and the apostolic
[12:08] Farms you know of of greater things many
[12:10] great gifts said why do you wait for me
[12:13] to move you every time you
[12:16] move where is your
[12:19] reward the fourth qualification is fruit
[12:22] to the ministry which is Souls one this
[12:25] is according to 1 Corinthians 9:2 Paul
[12:28] says for the the Seal of mine
[12:29] apostleship are ye in the Lord so the
[12:32] fact Paul won their souls was proof he
[12:35] was an apostle we see the same thing in
[12:38] 1 Thessalonians 2: 19 for what is Our
[12:41] Hope or Joy or crown of rejoicing are
[12:44] not even ye in the presence of our Lord
[12:46] Jesus Christ at his coming Paul won
[12:49] souls in thessalonica and those Souls
[12:52] were his hope joy and Crown of course we
[12:55] know God's Prophet brother brandham won
[12:57] many souls for the Lord he estimated
[12:58] around 2 million perhaps more by the
[13:00] grace of God the fifth qualification is
[13:04] prophets are sent by God with God's word
[13:06] to teach it in its Purity in Galatians
[13:09] 1: 6-2 Paul says anyone that changes the
[13:12] gospel or preaches a different gospel is
[13:14] a curse he says it twice and Jesus also
[13:18] said in Matthew 24:11 many false
[13:20] prophets shall rise and shall deceive
[13:22] many so God's Prophet brother brandom
[13:25] taught the word of God in its Purity He
[13:27] restored us back to the apostolic faith
[13:29] of the fathers according to Malachi 4: 5
[13:32] and 6 one very important video was a
[13:35] video I put out about 10 months ago
[13:36] called The Bride has hundreds of
[13:38] differences from all other churches
[13:40] absolute proof we are jesus' bride in
[13:43] the video I show over 110 differences
[13:46] between the true Bible doctrines brother
[13:49] Bram top versus denominational or
[13:52] non-denominational churches who teach
[13:54] false Doctrine I'll leave a link in the
[13:56] description by the grace of God going
[13:58] along with this idea of prophets teach
[14:00] the word of God in its Purity I want to
[14:03] bring out this point where a prophet
[14:06] interprets the word of God but it's not
[14:08] by The Prophet's own ideas or opinions
[14:11] but it's by the anointing of the Holy
[14:13] Ghost so a prophet teaching the truth of
[14:15] God's word we would say it's the prophet
[14:17] giving the interpretation of what the
[14:19] word means brother Ram said the
[14:21] interpretation only comes to a prophet
[14:23] he said this in modern events are made
[14:25] clear by prophecy 1965 let's listen to
[14:27] the quote in uh Hebrews 1:1 God in
[14:31] sundra times wrote the Bible by his own
[14:34] chosen way he never wrote it by
[14:37] theologians neither does he interpret by
[14:39] theologians amen there never was a time
[14:42] that that the theologians ever had an
[14:44] interpretation of the word of God the
[14:45] interpretation comes only to a prophet
[14:49] and the only way we're ever going to get
[14:50] out of this mess is for God to send us
[14:52] that Prophet just exactly the only way
[14:54] it's going to be done now to balance
[14:57] that we must show that brother Ram said
[14:58] I can't interpret God's word so again
[15:01] this shows the interpretation doesn't
[15:03] come from the thoughts of the Prophet
[15:05] it's not the prophet who has the ability
[15:06] to interpret God's word the Holy Ghost
[15:10] anoints the prophet and tells the people
[15:12] what the word of God means because
[15:14] brother Ram said God don't need any
[15:16] interpreter I can't interpret his word
[15:18] neither can anybody interpret his word
[15:20] so brother Ram saying not Moses not
[15:23] Jeremiah not Ezekiel not Isaiah no man
[15:26] can interpret God's word it's God's
[15:29] ability God Alone can interpret his own
[15:31] word but then of course he reveals the
[15:33] interpretation to prophets who tell us
[15:35] what God means let's listen to this
[15:38] quote from when their eyes were open
[15:39] they knew him
[15:40] 1964 as I said last night God don't need
[15:43] any interpreter I can't interpret his
[15:46] word neither can anybody interpret his
[15:48] word he's his own interpreter when he
[15:51] said he'll do anything he does it that
[15:53] settles it that's all there is to it he
[15:55] said he would do it and he did it that
[15:58] settles it you know nobody tell this is
[16:00] that or that's that he does it himself
[16:03] our interpretations is nothing to the
[16:04] scripture he speaks himself that's the
[16:07] way it
[16:08] is the Sixth and final qualification is
[16:10] prophets are sent by God with
[16:12] Supernatural works and or visions from
[16:15] God we see this in numbers
[16:17] 12:6 God said if there be a prophet
[16:19] among you I the Lord will make myself
[16:21] known unto him in a vision and will
[16:23] speak unto him in a dream brother Ram
[16:25] had many dreams and Visions one in
[16:27] particular was thus say the the Lord was
[16:29] the preview the bride I referenced that
[16:32] Vision on my video about the six thus
[16:34] sayith the Lords that have come to pass
[16:36] false prophets give false visions and
[16:39] divinations out of the deceit of their
[16:41] heart according to Jeremiah
[16:43] 14:14 the Lord said the prophets
[16:46] prophesy lies in my names I sent them
[16:48] not neither have I commanded them
[16:49] neither spake unto them they prophesy
[16:52] unto you a false vision and divination
[16:54] and a thing of not and the deceit of
[16:56] their heart so all prophets of God will
[16:59] have Supernatural Works Andor Visions
[17:01] from God and one thing about John the
[17:03] Baptist he had no Miracles the Bible
[17:05] said that in John 10:41 and John did no
[17:08] Miracle but all things that John spake
[17:11] of this man were true but John the
[17:13] Baptist did see Visions according to
[17:16] John 1: 32 and 33 John bear records
[17:20] saying I saw the Spirit descending from
[17:21] heaven like a dove and in Abode upon him
[17:24] and I knew him not but he that sent me
[17:26] to baptize with water the same said unto
[17:28] me upon on whom Thou shalt see the
[17:30] spirit descending and remaining on him
[17:32] the same as he which baptizeth with the
[17:34] Holy
[17:36] Ghost in closing friends hope this video
[17:40] was a blessing by the grace of God I
[17:42] think all these scriptures are a great
[17:43] place to start for how to define a new
[17:45] testament preaching prophet in the
[17:47] five-fold ministry we're so thankful the
[17:49] Lord Jesus Christ has sent brother
[17:51] William brandham as a genuine prophet of
[17:53] God in the fivefold ministry brother Ram
[17:55] stayed with the fivefold ministry he was
[17:58] faithful to all the these qualifications
[17:59] so we rejoice in that we know we're
[18:01] following a genuine prophet of God who
[18:03] is pointing us back to the absolute the
[18:05] Bible written and inspired by the Lord
[18:08] Jesus Christ perhaps in a future video
[18:10] I'll go through all these beautiful
[18:12] scriptures about prophets I made a list
[18:15] of them in my new Bible so I'd like to
[18:17] make a video on that in the future some
[18:19] of them I've mentioned in the last few
[18:21] videos about how a prophet sent from God
[18:24] is a sign of God's compassion upon his
[18:26] people so again a sign of God's love he
[18:28] would send us a prophet to teach us the
[18:31] word of God to warn us to help us to
[18:33] correct us to point us to the Lord Jesus
[18:36] Christ so we rejoice in that today if
[18:38] you have any questions concerns or
[18:40] testimonies about this video please
[18:41] contact me God bless you and may Jesus
[18:45] Christ be the desire of your heart
