TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] Revelation chapter 22. [Music] the themes of this chapter include the Throne of the New Jerusalem the Supreme deity of Jesus Christ warnings and blessings the Throne of the New Jerusalem is described in the first six verses a pure River of Water of Life proceeds out of the Throne of the lamb and the tree of life will bear 12 manner of fruits and its leaves also will be for the healing of the Nations the Servants of God shall see the Lamb's face and serve him the lamb will give light to everyone during his unending reign Jesus Christ Supreme deity is a major theme of this final chapter as Christ ends this book by reminding the readers of his titles from the opening chapters Alpha Omega beginning in the end the first and the last the root and offspring of David and the bright and Morning Star Jesus Christ has fully persuaded us that he is not a second person of the godhead but he is the image of the one person of God and all the godhead dwells in him bodily according to Colossians 2 verse 9. Jesus Christ gives multiple warnings and blessings in this closing chapter of the Bible Jesus warns us three times that he's coming quickly as verses 7 12 and 20 state Christ also gives multiple blessings the first is for those who keep the sayings of the prophecy of this book the second is Jesus promise to bring each person's reward with him at his coming as he will give to every man according to his work the symbols and key Revelations include Tree of Life the servants at the throne the four still conditions the spear and the bride and a warning to keep from adding or taking away from this book the tree of life is said to return to the Earth and be near the Throne of God on either side of the River of Life in Genesis chapters 2 and 3 the tree of life was in the midst of the Garden of Eden but the sin of Adam and Eve the husband and wife had caused them to be denied access to the tree of life but now in the New Jerusalem the pure sinless holy conditions of the original Garden of Eden have been restored God's Great Plan of Redemption has been completed as he first gained preeminence in his son Jesus Christ then gained preeminence in the Gentile bride of Jesus Christ and now God again has a sinless husband and wife Jesus Christ and his wife back in perfect fellowship and an eternal Eden with the Tree of Life just like in Genesis chapters 1 2 and 3 the tree of life is a symbol of the spirit of Jesus Christ for there can only be one way to eternal life the servants at the throne seem to refer to all those Born Again holy ghost-filled Believers which includes the New Testament Church and the 144 000 Jewish Remnant according to Daniel 7 verse 10 Revelation 14 verse 4. we believe this because who serves the husband Christ but his wife the bride of Christ these servants are said to have the right to Reign forever and ever fulfilling the Bible promise that new testament Saints would be Kings and Priests and Reign on the Earth according to Revelation 1 verse 6 and Revelation 5 verse 5. the four still conditions of revelation 22 verse 11 is a key Revelation fully taught throughout the entire Bible this Revelation shows that all people will end up in one of four spiritual conditions two of which are worthy of eternal life and two that are worthy of the second death the Lake of Fire every person will have one of two Destinies either saved or lost the saved are believers and the lost are either make Believers or unbelievers there are two kinds of Believers holy and righteous just as there are two kinds of the Lost filthy and unjust these four conditions were also taught by Saint Paul as he said we are all one of four types of vessels in second Timothy 2 verse 20 either gold silver wood or Earth the Believers would be gold and silver the wise and foolish virgins the unbelievers would be wood and Earth which are make-believers and unbelievers the Lord Jesus taught that there were four kinds of heart conditions in Matthew 13 verses 3 through 9. good thorny Stoney and Wayside in the days of the Earthly Ministry of the Lord Jesus there were four different crosses one for Jesus the Holy One one for the saved thief the righteous one cross for Judas Iscariot the make-believer and one cross for the Lost thief the unbeliever if we examine the two types of Believers holy and righteous we will find that they type the wise and foolish virgins of Matthew 25 verses 1 through 13. the main difference between these two believers who were both virgin or free from intercourse with idolatry is that the wise virgins had oil and oil is the symbol of the baptism of the Holy Ghost according to Zechariah 4 verse 6 and verses 11 through 14. Believers must make their calling election sure II Peter 1 verse 10 and be positive their life is filled with the oil of the Holy Ghost and this oil also represents that they are clothed with power according to Luke 24 49 and have boldness according to acts 4 verse 31 for the name of Jesus Christ the invitation of the spirit and bride to come and take of the Water of Life is a key revelation of how God will always use men who are filled with the Holy Ghost to save the Lost the holy spirit always has and always will speak through the bride the New Testament Church and the spirit does this through the five preaching gifts in the church which are the Apostle Prophet evangelist pastor and teacher according to Ephesians 4 verses 10 through 16. the true bride of Christ and her preachers are the mouthpiece of God on the Earth today if you and I expect to be made ready for the second coming of Jesus Christ we must submit to the pattern that Christ left for us we must follow the faith of the Holy Ghost anointed preachers that Jesus has sent down Through the Ages and their preaching will bring us unto the unity of Faith unto a perfect man according to Ephesians 4. we must obey the word they preach following their faith according to Hebrews 13 verse 7 and Hebrews 13 verse 17. we know this pattern will not change for Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever according to Hebrews 13 verse 8. the warning about the contents of this book is a key Revelation showing that God demands respect accountability and reverence for every word of God Jesus commanded that we live by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God in Matthew 4 verse 4. revelation 22 verses 18 to 19 states that anyone who adds to the Book of Revelation will have plagues added to them anyone who takes away from The Book of Revelation will have his part taken out of the book of life and the holy city preachers and all those who speak about the Bible must say only what the Bible says as Saint Paul taught his converts the whole Council or will of God according to Acts 20 verse 27. if we find ourselves hearing preaching that adds or takes away from The Book of Revelation we are bound by love to try and correct the preacher if we stay under that Ministry or seek out a different Ministry that is pure to every word of God even the changing of one word of God will bring great heartache and destruction as seen in Genesis 3 verse 4 when the serpent added just one word to God's word saying ye shall not surely die proverbs 30 verses 5 and 6 shows us that we must not add to any part of the Bible including the Book of Revelation proverbs 30 verse 5 and 6 say every word of God is pure he's a shield unto them that put their trust in him add thou not unto his words lest he reprove thee and thou be found a liar the timing of events is as follows this chapter seems to be chronological when it references events in the time of the New Jerusalem in the first five verses beginning in verse 6 until the end of the book there's a break in the visions of the New Jerusalem and we are given repeated warnings and blessings about the quick coming of Jesus as three times Christ says I come quickly May these unfailing words of Jesus Christ inspire you to get your life in order for Jesus's Second Coming recall Revelation 19 verse 7. let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready this concludes our series on the Book of Revelation even so come Lord Jesus if you'd like more Bible scriptures quotations or if you have any questions about the Book of Revelation please contact us God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
