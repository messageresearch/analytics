[0:02] this Mark in the head means that they
[0:04] will have to take the doctrine of the
[0:06] World Church system which is
[0:08] trinitarianism ETC and the mark in the
[0:11] hand which means to do the will of the
[0:13] World
[0:14] Church greetings friends in the
[0:16] matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[0:19] the purpose of this video is to go over
[0:20] the first of three ways that people will
[0:23] take the mark of the beast during the
[0:24] 7-year Great Tribulation period and the
[0:27] first way is by a mark in the right hand
[0:30] or in the forehead that's what this
[0:32] video will cover in a future video I'll
[0:34] cover the mark of his name and then the
[0:37] mark of the number of his name hi
[0:40] friends I'm Jesse Smith pastor bride of
[0:42] Christ Fellowship here in akan Ohio USA
[0:44] and I defend the original Gospel of
[0:46] Jesus Christ that he revealed to St Paul
[0:49] and then had to restore through Martin
[0:50] Luther John Wesley and William brandham
[0:53] and William brandham was a genuine
[0:54] prophet of God who lived from 1909 to
[0:56] 1965 I also defend brother Ram's Godly
[0:59] Christian Care character in this video
[1:01] we're looking at the first of three ways
[1:03] a person will take the mark of the beast
[1:04] and remember we will not be those who
[1:07] take the mark of the beast those of us
[1:09] who believe the true revelation of the
[1:11] Bible those of us who have received the
[1:13] finished mystery of God according to
[1:14] Revelation
[1:15] 10:7 according to Ephesians 4 there's
[1:18] one Faith one Lord one baptism we
[1:20] believe we've received the one Faith or
[1:22] the one true revelation of the Bible
[1:25] again the same Revelation that Jesus
[1:26] gave to Paul and then had to be restored
[1:28] through Luther Wesley and and brother
[1:30] brandham one reason behind making this
[1:32] video series is to warn every man
[1:34] Colossians 1:28 says whom we preach
[1:37] warning every man and teaching every man
[1:39] in all wisdom that we may present every
[1:41] man perfect in Christ Jesus where unto I
[1:44] also labor striving according to his
[1:46] working which worketh in me mightily so
[1:49] the Gospel of Jesus Christ should work
[1:51] mightily in us as Holy Ghost filled
[1:53] Christians then we should labor and
[1:55] strive to warn every man to let them
[1:57] know not to be a part of the Beast
[1:59] system nor take the mark of the beast
[2:02] which again can be taken in at least
[2:03] three ways according to the Bible so
[2:05] let's go read that Revelation 13 vers 17
[2:09] and 18 and that no man might buy or sell
[2:12] save that he had the mark so the Mark is
[2:15] the first way a person can receive the
[2:17] mark of the beast or so here's the
[2:19] second way or the name of the Beast or
[2:22] here's the third way or the number of
[2:24] his name here is wisdom let him that
[2:27] hath understanding count the number of
[2:28] the Beast for where it is the number of
[2:30] a man and his number is 63
[2:34] sc6 also we want to read Revelation
[2:36] 13:16 the verse right above this here is
[2:39] where it says the first Mark is in the
[2:40] right hand or the forehead Revelation
[2:43] 13:16 and he causes all both small great
[2:46] rich and poor free and bond to receive a
[2:48] mark in their right hand or in their
[2:50] foreheads so again you can get one or
[2:52] the other we as Holy Ghost filed
[2:54] Christians are going to get neither
[2:56] because we have the mark of the baptism
[2:57] of the Holy Ghost it's the Mark or or
[3:00] seal of the Holy Ghost unto the day of
[3:02] our Redemption according to Ephesians
[3:03] 1:13 and Ephesians 4:30 now in the Greek
[3:08] the word mark means a stamp or imprinted
[3:10] Mark of the mark stamped on the forehead
[3:12] or the right hand as the badge of the
[3:14] followers of the Antichrist the mark
[3:16] branded upon horses a second definition
[3:20] is thing carved sculpture Graven work of
[3:23] idolatrous
[3:24] images now as the first video showed
[3:27] which I'll leave a link to in the
[3:28] description the mark of the beast is a
[3:29] spiritual Mark it's always been a
[3:31] spiritual Mark it's the reprobate mind
[3:34] it's the mind that will no longer humble
[3:36] itself to the will of God or the word of
[3:38] God both the Old and New Testaments call
[3:41] this type of Mind a reprobate mind or
[3:43] rejected mind it's a disobedient mind
[3:45] that God rejects after that person
[3:48] finally rejects Jesus Christ or God and
[3:51] his ways for the final time only God
[3:53] knows when that happens here's an
[3:56] important point I put in my book while
[3:58] most people think 's Mark will be a
[4:00] computer chip tattoo or other physical
[4:03] Mark scripture teaches the opposite as
[4:06] the Beast Mark is also a spiritual mark
[4:08] an unbeliever receives after rejecting
[4:11] God's Mark which is the baptism of the
[4:13] Holy Ghost while the mark of the beast
[4:15] movement during the Great Tribulation
[4:17] May culminate with the implantation of a
[4:20] computer chip the mark itself begins as
[4:22] a rebellious stubborn or prideful human
[4:25] Spirit called a reprobate
[4:28] mind so now I'm going to read a a
[4:29] portion from my 2021 book and there's
[4:32] numerous scriptural references in here
[4:34] along with a quote from God's Prophet
[4:37] brother Brandon from his church age book
[4:39] released 1965 in fact I think I'll start
[4:41] with that quote right here by God's
[4:42] grace it's in chapter 10 of the church
[4:44] age book a resume of the ages brother
[4:47] Ram said quote thus all the people have
[4:49] to belong to the World Church system or
[4:51] be at the mercy of the elements for they
[4:53] cannot buy or sell without the mark of
[4:55] the beast in the hand or head this Mark
[4:58] in the head means that they will have to
[5:01] take the doctrine of the World Church
[5:04] system which is trinitarianism ETC and
[5:07] the mark into hand which means to do the
[5:09] will of the World Church with this great
[5:12] power the church systems will persecute
[5:14] the true bride this image will try to
[5:16] keep the bride from preaching and
[5:18] teaching Etc her ministers will be
[5:20] forbidden to give comfort and Truth to
[5:22] the people who need it but before the
[5:24] Antichrist in person which we believe to
[5:26] be a future pope of Rome or the current
[5:28] pope of Rome we don't know the day or
[5:29] the hour takes over the complete World
[5:32] System of churches the true church will
[5:33] be taken away from this world to be with
[5:36] the Lord God will catch away his bride
[5:38] for the great marriage supper of the
[5:40] Lamb end quote this is a powerful
[5:43] wonderful explanation of the mark in the
[5:45] right hand or forehead from God's
[5:47] Prophet brother brandham here's what I
[5:49] wrote about in my 2021 book by God's
[5:51] grace along with numerous scriptural
[5:53] citations first the mark of the beast
[5:55] can be in the right hand or in the
[5:57] forehead the right hand Mark symbolizes
[5:59] one who has promised or made an oath of
[6:01] allegiance to the works of the Beast
[6:03] under the guise of peace and safety and
[6:06] the reference to that is first
[6:07] Thessalonians
[6:09] 5:3 the world will be longing for peace
[6:12] and safety we see a lot of wars in the
[6:14] world we see violence especially in the
[6:16] large cities here in the United States
[6:17] and of course around the world so the
[6:19] world will be crying for peace and
[6:22] safety in this case the right hand Mark
[6:25] may be called the right hand of
[6:26] falsehood that's from Psalms 144:
[6:31] 8-1 the Bible also talks about the right
[6:34] hand of Fellowship between Paul and the
[6:35] apostles so when Sinners join with the
[6:38] mark of the beast in the hand it
[6:39] represents a right hand of falsehood a
[6:42] false Oath a false vow there's no truth
[6:45] in their oath there's no truth in their
[6:47] Covenant there's no safety or peace in
[6:49] their Covenant and this right-and Mark
[6:51] means all people including church
[6:53] members will have to do the will of the
[6:55] One World Church system hands can
[6:58] represent works as God promised to bless
[7:00] obedient Israel in all the works of
[7:01] thine hands in Deuteronomy
[7:04] 16:15 simple submission and obedience to
[7:07] the will of the Antichrist for the sake
[7:08] of financial gain will cause people to
[7:11] take this
[7:12] Mark billions of people will take this
[7:14] Mark simply because they want to buy and
[7:16] sell moving on to the forehead the mark
[7:19] in the forehead means the Beast
[7:20] followers will boldly and unashamedly
[7:22] accept the false doctrines of the World
[7:24] Church system which includes
[7:25] trinitarianism universalism and other
[7:27] doctrines not found in Scripture
[7:30] as many videos of mine cover the Trinity
[7:33] is a false heretical teaching St Paul
[7:36] never taught three persons the phrase
[7:38] three persons is not in the Bible
[7:40] according to the historical references I
[7:42] found the Holy Spirit was not even
[7:44] confirmed as a Divine person until 381
[7:47] ad and because trinitarianism is a false
[7:50] Doctrine it's leaven as jesus' Parable
[7:52] in Matthew 1333 says and once that
[7:55] leaven was introduced now look at the
[7:58] massive false doctrines that the Roman
[8:01] Catholic church now holds look how that
[8:03] leaven is spread to the entire religion
[8:06] of the Roman Catholic Church they make
[8:07] bread and wine the literal body and
[8:09] blood of Jesus Christ that's heresy they
[8:11] pray to dead people that's spiritualism
[8:14] so any honest person can see that the
[8:16] Trinity was this initial leaven that
[8:18] spread all the false doctrines to the
[8:21] entire doctrine of the Roman Catholic
[8:23] church and all the daughter churches or
[8:25] sister churches of the Roman Catholic
[8:26] church accept this lie that God is three
[8:28] persons that's nonsensical it's
[8:31] illogical God is one person who
[8:33] manifests himself in three ways to
[8:35] redeem mankind another note on
[8:38] universalism I'm not sure if you saw it
[8:39] last week at the Republican National
[8:41] Convention the convention was opened up
[8:43] with a prayer to the one true God of the
[8:46] Hindu religion a religionnews.com
[8:48] article says this at RNC an uneven
[8:52] awkward Embrace of religious pluralism
[8:55] as a republican official let a seek
[8:58] prayer images of Christian crosses flash
[9:00] behind her the prayer was led by a woman
[9:03] named harit cower Dylan a National
[9:07] Committee woman of the Republican
[9:09] National Convention for
[9:10] California the prayer said dear y guro
[9:14] are one true God we thank you for
[9:17] creating America as unique Heaven on
[9:19] this earth end quote friends this is so
[9:22] sad the name of God is not wahi guro the
[9:25] name of God is the Lord Jesus Christ and
[9:27] I just read this morning in Revelation
[9:30] 13 how the Beast will blaspheme the name
[9:33] of God and so Catholics blasphemed the
[9:36] name of God by ignoring the Lord Jesus
[9:38] Christ's name and giving God titles
[9:40] father son Holy Ghost calling him a Holy
[9:43] Trinity that's blasphemy changing the
[9:45] name of God and here it's blasphemy to
[9:47] say the one name of God is wahi Guru so
[9:51] we can see even American evangelicals
[9:54] Catholics are all uniting in this one
[9:57] World Church system they all believe
[9:59] they're all worshiping the one true God
[10:01] and they're not the only true God is the
[10:03] Lord Jesus Christ the forehead protects
[10:05] the a of brain known as the frontal lobe
[10:07] where decisions are made speech is
[10:09] formed and reasoning occurs it is
[10:11] fitting that God represents the forehead
[10:14] as a persuaded madeup mind and God said
[10:18] it's as hard as Stone such as Flint God
[10:21] told Ezekiel that he would make his
[10:22] forehead strong against their foreheads
[10:25] that's found in Ezekiel 3:1 and veres 8
[10:28] and 9 so God gave Ezekiel a strong
[10:31] forehead a madeup mind about the truth
[10:33] of God's word so Spirit-filled
[10:35] Christians are bold and unashamed of the
[10:37] Gospel of Jesus Christ that proves they
[10:39] have the Holy Spirit in their souls and
[10:41] it's symbolized as having the mark in
[10:43] the forehead that's also what the Bible
[10:45] says about the 144,000 in the Book of
[10:48] Revelation they'll have a mark in their
[10:49] forehead it just means their minds are
[10:52] made up their souls are sealed by the
[10:53] Holy Ghost and they're unashamed of the
[10:56] Gospel of Jesus Christ on the other side
[10:58] sinners foreheads have minds unashamed
[11:01] of committing evil while God promised to
[11:04] Mark the foreheads of the Believers who
[11:05] sighed and cried against all the
[11:06] Abominations done in Jerusalem as a sign
[11:09] they would be delivered from destruction
[11:11] that's in Ezekiel 9:
[11:13] 1-11 both God followers and Beast
[11:16] followers have marked foreheads and each
[11:18] person must choose the mark he will
[11:20] receive remember friends these marks can
[11:22] be received today but there will come a
[11:24] final time during the seven-year Great
[11:26] Tribulation where everyone will have to
[11:28] decide whether to take the Mark or not I
[11:30] personally believe that Mark will be
[11:31] laid down during the second half of the
[11:33] 7-year Great Tribulation period and
[11:35] that's because the 144,000 Jews have to
[11:38] have a Ministry of two prophets for
[11:40] three and a half years and so we know
[11:42] those 144,000 cannot die until after
[11:45] they're sealed by the Holy Ghost and I'm
[11:48] unsure whether they'll die or not I
[11:49] don't know for sure there seems to be
[11:50] quotes on both sides but if the mark of
[11:53] the beast was laid down at the beginning
[11:54] of the Great Tribulation period Then
[11:56] those 144,000 Jews would be killed but
[11:59] they can't be killed they have to live
[12:00] long enough to hear the three and a half
[12:02] year Ministry of the prophets and then
[12:04] after the prophets are raptured the
[12:05] remnant rejoices and then Jesus has to
[12:08] come and save Israel because Israel will
[12:10] be surrounded by the pope and all the
[12:12] armies all nations will come against
[12:13] Israel according to Zechariah 12 and
[12:15] Zechariah 14 so it's sometime in that
[12:18] second half of the 7-year tribulation
[12:20] period that the 144,000 will receive the
[12:23] baptism of the Holy Ghost the Bible
[12:24] calls it the Seal of God in the soul the
[12:26] Bible also calls it the mark in the
[12:28] forehead
[12:30] in
[12:31] closing friends hope this video was a
[12:33] blessing by the grace of God again it's
[12:34] a warning to everyone it's a warning to
[12:36] real Believers get the mark of the
[12:38] baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul
[12:40] be marked with God's Mark it's also a
[12:42] warning to everyone who will watch this
[12:45] to not take the mark of the beast if it
[12:47] comes during our lifetime no man knows
[12:49] the day or the hour so we don't know
[12:50] when it'll come but we see progress we
[12:53] see birth pains leading up to this one
[12:56] World Church system this one world
[12:58] government United with the One World
[13:00] Church so we want to be ready by the
[13:02] grace of God Revelation 19 says the
[13:04] bride has made herself ready so we're
[13:06] making ready by the grace of God I'll
[13:08] leave a link to this video it's called
[13:10] how to receive the baptism of the Holy
[13:11] Ghost there's a short little summary I
[13:14] use on how to receive the Holy Ghost
[13:15] daily read pray obey we must daily read
[13:19] the Bible we must daily pray and we must
[13:22] daily obey the word of God and then will
[13:24] receive the Holy Ghost that's according
[13:26] to acts 5:32 God gives the Holy Ghost to
[13:28] them that obey oy him we see in Acts
[13:30] chap 10 cornelus was fasting and praying
[13:34] obeying the word of God and then when
[13:35] Peter just preached a very short sermon
[13:37] he received the baptism of the Holy
[13:39] Ghost if you have any questions concerns
[13:41] or testimonies about this video please
[13:42] contact me God bless you and may Jesus
[13:46] Christ be the desire of your heart
