[23:11] here of
[23:14] angels having joy over sinners that
[23:17] repent
[23:18] angels are very much like humans aren't
[23:21] they they're very much like it
[23:22] a lot of emotions uh fighting we'll see
[23:26] they're warriors uh and so a beautiful
[23:29] picture here
[23:30] uh jesus's parable of the lost coin and
[23:33] uh we just
[23:34] see a beautiful picture here of angels
[23:36] rejoicing
[23:37] over these uh souls that are saved
[23:39] praise god
[23:43] you always wonder what how many angels

[23:50] a lot of them by god's grace let's read

[25:46] let's have communion and fellowship in
[25:48] jesus christ's name
[25:49] and saint said amen praise god god bless
[25:52] you again praise god
[25:56] all right so uh by god's grace i have
[25:58] numerous scriptures to go over i want to
[25:59] look up one
[26:00] real quick uh
[26:03] let's go to hebrews chapter one i think
[26:05] we'll start there
[26:07] hebrews 1 7.
[26:14] and i have a correction by the amen and
[26:16] wendy and hua
[26:17] i had yesterday i said something wrong
[26:19] so i'll correct it about the angel
[26:21] bodies
[26:22] so i just realized that as i was
[26:23] starting the scripture i made a little
[26:24] mistake
[26:25] so let's go to hebrews one
[26:29] and i looked and looked and looked on
[26:30] facebook for about five minutes i
[26:32] couldn't find that video of the angel
[26:34] but if i find it i'll share with you one
[26:35] of the saints from guyana
[26:37] posted it it must have been a couple
[26:38] weeks ago because i i looked and i
[26:40] couldn't find it
[26:41] and just uh neat to see the boy's leg
[26:44] lifted and moved over
[26:45] right on time our god is able praise god
[26:49] now who was it in the testimonies that
[26:50] said they thought they'd entertain an
[26:52] angel was that karen
[26:53] when she gave her testimony does anybody
[26:55] remember that okay she's not so
[26:57] i thought it was karen too that she
[27:00] answered a stranger and then looked away
[27:02] and then when she come back
[27:03] it was gone i think it was right outside
[27:05] of her house oh yeah that's right and
[27:07] her mom kind of corrected her i said
[27:09] and said i need to entertain angels next
[27:12] time so
[27:13] interesting very wonderful to see that
[27:15] hebrews 1 7.
[27:17] here's a good place to start defining uh
[27:20] angels
[27:21] uh in hebrews 1 verse 7.
[27:28] and i'm looking at another one now real
[27:30] quick let's read this one and we'll go
[27:31] to verse 4.
[27:32] i shouldn't say real quick i'm nervous i
[27:33] don't want to go too long
[27:36] so let me not be in such a hurry hebrews
[27:39] 1 7
[27:40] and of the angels he saith who maketh
[27:43] his angels
[27:44] spirits and his ministers of flame of
[27:47] fire
[27:49] all right so we know in the in in the uh
[27:52] the bible their makeup is a spiritual
[27:54] being
[27:54] it's a celestial body right there's two
[27:56] kinds of body there's terrestrial
[27:58] natural bodies like we have and there's
[28:00] celestial
[28:01] spiritual bodies the glorified is a
[28:03] combination of both
[28:05] praise god but a theophany is as a
[28:07] celestial
[28:08] uh it's different so an angel has a
[28:11] theophany body
[28:13] and notice what they are they're
[28:14] ministers right they're ministers
[28:16] the actual word angel we know means
[28:18] messenger
[28:19] so there are ministers and messengers
[28:23] uh and they minister according to god's
[28:26] will
[28:27] and notice a flame of fire so sometimes
[28:29] you know the the chariots of fire
[28:31] right that took elijah home angels right
[28:35] we must been angel uh horses and
[28:37] chariots and
[28:38] bye what a what a beautiful picture that
[28:40] is praise god
[28:42] and so angels here
[28:45] are sent from god they're god's servants
[28:47] they can become they're fiery
[28:49] now go up to verse 4 hebrews 1 4
[28:54] this just says just a good scripture
[28:56] about jesus jesus's human body
[28:58] angels were more powerful than jesus's
[29:00] human body remember jesus said
[29:02] he said without the father i can do
[29:04] nothing right so jesus human body was
[29:06] exactly that
[29:07] human it had no sin nature though that's
[29:10] what made it different from ours add
[29:11] word nature
[29:13] hebrews 1 4 being made so much better
[29:16] than the angels
[29:17] as he hath by inheritance obtained a
[29:19] more excellent name
[29:21] than they all right
[29:26] it seems like i'm missing a scripture
[29:28] that doesn't seem like the one i wanted
[29:29] to read yeah
[29:30] yeah he has an excellent more excellent
[29:32] name than that one
[29:35] oh i'm sorry it's verse 14. there it is
[29:37] sorry i knew there was another one in
[29:38] chapter one
[29:43] let's go to hebrews 1 13 let's read 13
[29:45] and 14.
[29:46] but to which of the angels said he at
[29:49] any time sit on my right hand until i
[29:51] make thine enemies
[29:52] thy footstool this is showing how no
[29:55] angel has ever been exalted to the place
[29:57] of christ
[29:58] right that's not reserved for them it
[30:00] was reserved for jesus
[30:02] verse 14 are they not all ministering
[30:04] spirits sent forth
[30:06] to minister for them who shall be heirs
[30:09] of salvation praise god praise the lord
[30:12] so they're sent forth to minister so
[30:14] when god
[30:15] does something supernatural many times
[30:17] it will be an angel praise god
[30:19] we'll say the holy spirit and you know
[30:21] generally speaking it's the same spirit
[30:23] but scripturally many times it's an
[30:26] angel
[30:27] right it's an angel doing the will of
[30:30] god
[30:30] praise the lord uh so we started hebrews
[30:33] one it's a great chapter for angels now
[30:36] scripturally the first uh chronological
[30:40] angel appearance is revelation 12 as far
[30:43] as the first mentioned before
[30:45] you know human history so let's go to
[30:47] revelation 12
[30:48] there are so many beautiful secrets in
[30:49] revelation 12.
[30:51] what a tremendous chapter of so much
[30:54] importance
[30:56] revelation 12.
[31:04] ram calls this uh the chapter about
[31:06] israel he said there's no
[31:07] there's nothing to do with the gentile
[31:09] bride chapter 12 has nothing to do with
[31:10] the gentile bride
[31:16] all right so uh we know the vision for
[31:19] the first two verses and then satan
[31:21] in verses uh three and four and then the
[31:24] christ child in verses five and six
[31:26] so verse seven is where we start with
[31:28] the origin
[31:30] of angels as far as the the first
[31:33] uh time of record i think that we have
[31:37] uh well now i'm thinking of another one
[31:38] i'm not thinking of job where the angels
[31:39] of god shouted for joy
[31:41] at the foundation of the world that
[31:43] might be the actual first one
[31:45] sorry there's uh 283 hits on angels in
[31:49] the bible so i didn't get through all of
[31:50] them
[31:51] um so just i'm just trying to do a
[31:53] review today
[31:55] so let's look at that one revelation 12
[31:58] 7 and there was war in heaven michael
[31:59] and his angels now see his angels so
[32:01] michael members called the arch
[32:03] archangel which it means chief angel
[32:06] so he's the chief michael was the chief
[32:09] angel
[32:10] uh and his angel so the chief had ones
[32:13] that belonged to him
[32:14] now we were talking about this yesterday
[32:15] there's there's a hierarchy and i think
[32:17] it's typed out beautifully in the days
[32:18] of david
[32:19] because david had captains over
[32:21] thousands and ten thousands and even
[32:23] hundreds
[32:24] so there was this order of hierarchy
[32:28] amongst the soldiers how much more the
[32:30] heavenly soldiers
[32:32] now we know demons have hierarchy right
[32:34] as well because the prince of persia
[32:36] right was over the persian kingdom
[32:39] uh then there was demons that just
[32:40] stayed in the in gattera
[32:42] right that they begged jesus they said
[32:45] don't make us leave
[32:46] the demons are territorial like the
[32:48] persian the demon the demon over persia
[32:50] territorial
[32:51] demon over gatherer territorial so they
[32:53] have territories
[32:54] right and brother ram says you go to one
[32:56] nation they have a certain spirit
[32:59] right he said some are really really
[33:01] military spirits fighters
[33:03] others are he said america's
[33:05] entertainment
[33:07] so entertainment demons and so you have
[33:10] all these different and they're
[33:10] territorial
[33:12] and so we've got to be aware of that and
[33:14] and church really like this
[33:15] the only way to get salvation is to
[33:16] break through some of those powers right
[33:18] to pray through until something somebody
[33:21] gets a breakthrough praise god
[33:23] hallelujah and so you see uh
[33:26] the order there's an order hierarchy
[33:28] with archangels
[33:30] uh now he fought angels thoughts or
[33:33] angels are fighters
[33:35] warriors uh and against the dragon and
[33:39] the dragon fought and his angels and
[33:40] prevail not neither was there found
[33:42] any more place in heaven
[33:46] all right now then verse nine and the
[33:49] great dragon was cast out that old
[33:50] serpent which called the devil and satan
[33:52] which deceiveth the whole world
[33:54] was cast out into the earth and his
[33:56] angels were cast
[33:57] out with him jesus said i saw like
[33:59] lightning fall from heaven imagine that
[34:02] lightning strikes and that was angels
[34:04] falling down to the earth
[34:05] adam and eve's earth imagine enjoying
[34:08] eden
[34:08] it's all beauty and all of a sudden
[34:10] lightning strikes
[34:12] and now demons are lurking everywhere
[34:14] you know because they're cast
[34:15] out of heaven down to earth
[34:18] so uh we see that now there's a
[34:21] scripture about
[34:22] okay now verse 10 and i heard a loud
[34:24] voice saying in heaven now has come
[34:25] salvation and strength and kingdom of
[34:27] our god and power and his christ
[34:29] for the accused of our brotherness cast
[34:31] down which accuses them before our god
[34:34] day and night so the man tells us like
[34:36] job there's demons constantly accusing
[34:38] us day and night
[34:39] but the blood of jesus christ is there
[34:41] to tell the devil that the
[34:43] the sins are put in the sea of
[34:44] forgetfulness praise god
[34:46] and he remembers them no more praise the
[34:48] lord
[34:49] now i want to look at the one the third
[34:51] part of heaven
[34:54] yeah verse four sorry i did skip over
[34:56] that there's
[34:57] look there's so much in this chapter
[34:58] about angels uh verse
[35:00] four and his tale drew the third part of
[35:03] the stars of heaven
[35:05] and did cast them to the earth and the
[35:07] dragon stood before the woman which was
[35:09] ready to be devoured to be delivered
[35:11] rather
[35:12] for to devour her child as soon as it
[35:14] was born
[35:16] so a third of the angels uh were
[35:19] demons now i'm looking for the scripture
[35:21] here yeah hebrews 12
[35:23] 22 honey can you pull that up there if
[35:24] you got your bible you can turn there
[35:26] hebrews 12
[35:26] 22. now we know
[35:30] um the bible uses hyperbole how many
[35:32] know what that is
[35:33] hyperbole is like an exaggeration right
[35:36] so the bible uses hyperbole
[35:38] so the bible says an innumerable company
[35:42] but like does god know the number yeah
[35:45] right does god know
[35:46] so that's hyperbole for us humans can't
[35:49] number it
[35:50] but god knows the number right
[35:54] uh the bible uses hyperbole all the time
[35:56] like uh when israel was getting uh
[35:58] surrounded the bible said there was uh
[36:00] there was chariots without number i
[36:02] think in the days of the judges
[36:04] uh the days of the kings and there were
[36:06] the number was the sand of the sea
[36:08] so the bible is using hyperbole it's a
[36:10] huge number right
[36:12] but god knows the number and so there's
[36:14] a large number of angels god knows the
[36:16] number
[36:17] right to us it's innumerable because we
[36:19] can't count that high
[36:20] but a third of them were deceived
[36:22] through lucifer
[36:25] right and so that's the beginning here
[36:28] of where we see
[36:29] angels all right now there's so many
[36:32] points here
[36:33] i didn't have time to really get them in
[36:34] order like i wanted to
[36:36] oh yeah let's go to job 38 then let's
[36:38] look at the actually the first one
[36:40] uh when the angels shouted at the
[36:43] foundation of the earth
[36:46] remember angels had to be created before
[36:48] the earth
[36:49] uh so if lucifer was cast to the earth
[36:51] the earth had to be there for lucifer to
[36:53] be cast down
[36:54] too so the earth had to be there i'm
[36:56] sorry the angels had to be there first
[37:00] now job 38 four i have seven as well
[37:04] thirty eight four the term job job 38
[37:07] 4.
[37:13] all right thank you hun where was thou
[37:15] when i laid the foundations of the earth
[37:17] declare if thou has understanding go go
[37:19] to verse 7 please
[37:21] who hath laid the measures thereof if
[37:23] thou knowest or who has stretched the
[37:24] line upon it you go to verse 7 please
[37:28] when the morning stars sang together and
[37:30] all the sons of god
[37:32] shouted for joy praise god now this is a
[37:34] good topic vang emailed me about this
[37:36] one time
[37:37] vang had a great question he said are
[37:39] these sons actual sons of god or are
[37:41] they angels well in this case i think
[37:42] they're angels
[37:44] okay uh and that's because of job so
[37:48] let's go to job
[37:49] the bible said the sons of god came to
[37:51] present themselves before the lord let
[37:53] me know what i'm talking about
[37:55] anybody okay is that new all right
[37:58] so job job one
[38:03] job one verse six so this is where
[38:06] god is hiding a mystery right the bible
[38:09] said the sons of god shouted for joy and
[38:11] people think that was actually humans
[38:12] but brother abraham says
[38:14] no you you were not you were just a
[38:16] thought of god before you came to the
[38:18] earth you didn't exist as a pre-existent
[38:20] soul
[38:21] i mean how many remember that from the
[38:22] church age book anybody remember that
[38:23] one
[38:24] you were not a pre-existent soul like
[38:26] talking in heaven and walking around in
[38:28] heaven you know
[38:28] flying around or whatever you were in
[38:31] the mind
[38:32] of god right i broke that said you
[38:35] weren't aware of it you were just in his
[38:36] mind just like a
[38:37] a natural child is in their father right
[38:41] right the seed is in the father and
[38:42] you're not aware of it you're not having
[38:43] fellowship with your dad you're just
[38:45] in your dad okay and so this is where a
[38:48] mystery lays because the sons of god
[38:50] saw the daughters of men that was human
[38:52] men but then the bible said when the
[38:54] sons of god shouted for joy
[38:56] at the foundation of the earth that was
[38:57] angels praise god
[38:59] so it's hidden now there was a day when
[39:00] the sons of god came to present
[39:02] themselves before the lord and satan
[39:04] uh came also among them so this has to
[39:07] be angels
[39:08] so you'll be really careful with the
[39:10] scripture right or else people get
[39:11] twisted up in their doctrine
[39:14] okay so thank god that the message came
[39:16] to us the brother man told us right
[39:18] after god
[39:19] you know made himself a light a
[39:20] theophany the logos he made angels next
[39:24] amen because he said the angels have to
[39:26] have something to worship
[39:27] they have to see something to worship
[39:28] right so they had to be able to see
[39:31] the light of god right the logos the
[39:33] body of god
[39:34] for god to dwell in all right so uh
[39:37] that's a good place to start
[39:40] oh here's another one i forgot hebrews 2
[39:42] 9.
[39:43] uh here's where men are a little lower
[39:47] than angels
[39:49] okay so this even goes back to jesus's
[39:51] body hebrews 2 9.
[39:57] remember church we are creators how many
[39:59] believe you're a creator
[40:01] right and brother man tells us that even
[40:04] the rap says even magicians can get so
[40:06] much
[40:06] into their mental powers that they can
[40:08] break glass remember that the babe
[40:09] talked about that
[40:11] he said that's just the human mind he
[40:13] said what about faith
[40:15] he said then you can move mountains and
[40:16] raise the dead and heal the sick and all
[40:18] those things like that
[40:20] he said so see humans have this access
[40:22] to this spiritual power praise god
[40:24] uh but they're not as high as angels
[40:28] okay but we see jesus who is made a
[40:30] little lower than the angels
[40:33] for the suffering of death so angels
[40:34] can't die right they can't die
[40:36] physically because they don't have a
[40:36] physical body
[40:38] crown with glory and honor that he by
[40:40] the grace of god should taste death for
[40:42] every man
[40:44] so an angels doesn't have a physical
[40:45] body can't taste death can't die
[40:47] so god had to create himself a human
[40:49] body to dwell in
[40:51] take it to the cross to pay for our sins
[40:54] amen
[40:55] praise god so jesus a little lower we're
[40:58] a little lower as well but we have
[41:00] the spiritual s we have the spirit in us
[41:02] right which gives us access
[41:04] uh to the supernatural realm
[41:08] all right okay so now i got that got
[41:12] that
[41:12] um let's look at the strength of angels
[41:15] so psalms
[41:16] 103 20. can you pull it up there here we
[41:19] see the strength
[41:20] of angels
[41:24] i love this part about angels psalms 103
[41:26] 20.
[41:31] how many know angels like worshiping god
[41:33] too
[41:35] how do you know when we're worshiping
[41:36] today during service we weren't the only
[41:38] ones angels are worshipping too
[41:40] the bible said bless the lord me his
[41:42] angels
[41:44] the angels worship right that excel and
[41:47] strength that do his commandments
[41:49] hearkening unto the voice of his word
[41:52] you see that original two-thirds of the
[41:54] angels
[41:54] they had to make that decision right
[41:56] they had to make the decision i'm going
[41:57] to continue
[41:58] to keep the commandments i'm going to
[42:00] continue to do what god
[42:02] said very similar to us right we've got
[42:04] to decide every day we have to die daily
[42:06] to do god's commandments praise god to
[42:08] keep his charge
[42:09] to be his messengers how many want to be
[42:11] a messenger praise god
[42:12] and deliver god's message to your
[42:14] friends family co-workers
[42:16] praise god so there's a lot of
[42:18] similarities between
[42:19] us and messengers remember malachi means
[42:21] my messenger that's why i chose it
[42:23] uh because i like that of a man being
[42:26] the messenger for god
[42:27] and i'm one of god's messengers praise
[42:29] god so
[42:31] that's the next ones let's look at uh
[42:38] here's a good one psalm 63 9 psalm 63 9.
[42:48] psalm 63 9.
[42:52] this is what i was talking about earlier
[42:53] many times when there's supernatural
[42:55] things
[42:55] we'll just say it's the holy spirit but
[42:58] technically it could be
[43:00] an angel of god as well right but see
[43:03] the angel of god is anointed with the
[43:05] holy spirit
[43:06] that's what the bible says uh psalms i'm
[43:09] sorry it's
[43:10] isaiah 63 9 my father isaiah
[43:13] isaiah my phone
[43:16] so angels are anointed with god's spirit
[43:20] right how many remember the anointed
[43:21] cherub
[43:22] how do you remember that lucifer's
[43:24] called the anointed cherub
[43:26] anointed with what well at one time he
[43:28] was anointed with god's
[43:29] right spirit right at one time he was
[43:33] perfect
[43:33] nothing wrong in him but then pride was
[43:35] found in his heart
[43:37] okay so uh here we go in all their
[43:40] affliction he was afflicted and the
[43:42] ain't there it is
[43:43] the angel of his presence the messenger
[43:46] of his presence the angels
[43:48] minister the holy spirit praise god they
[43:50] minister god's
[43:51] spirit to us save them in his love and
[43:55] his pity he redeemed them
[43:56] and he bear them and he carried them all
[43:58] the days of old
[44:00] praise god see angels bring the presence
[44:02] of god the blessings of god
[44:04] to his people
[44:08] amen
[44:12] let's look at uh zechariah 5
[44:15] 9. here's one of the first videos i made
[44:19] against believe the sign to try to bring
[44:21] correction to them and
[44:22] i i thought about making it one of the
[44:25] questions but i i think it was as
[44:27] important as the other questions so
[44:30] i believe the sign says zechariah 5 9 is
[44:33] women angels but there's no such a thing
[44:37] zechariah 5 9 then i lifted up my
[44:41] eyes and looked and behold there came
[44:43] out two women and the wind was
[44:45] in their wings you have women with wings
[44:48] right
[44:49] or they had wings like the wings of a
[44:50] stork which is an unclean bird
[44:52] so it tells us right away these are
[44:54] unclean spirits
[44:56] okay and they lifted up the ifa now if
[44:58] it was a basket for bread
[45:02] between the earth and the heaven now go
[45:04] to verse 10.
[45:07] then said i to the angel that talked
[45:09] with me whither do these bear the ephod
[45:11] verse 11. and he said to me to build it
[45:14] and house in the land of china how many
[45:15] know what
[45:16] shinar was babylon
[45:19] and it shall be established and set
[45:21] there upon her
[45:22] own base her so this is israel this is a
[45:25] vision
[45:26] zechariah sees of israel being carried
[45:29] away
[45:29] to babylon by two women with
[45:32] wings which historically were babylon
[45:36] and assyria
[45:37] when they carried away israel and took
[45:40] him into captivity
[45:42] okay so now believe the sign will
[45:46] use that verse 9 and they'll say see
[45:47] women have angels william branham is
[45:49] wrong
[45:50] so women can preach you know no no no
[45:53] wrong wrong
[45:54] angels are only men praise god only men
[45:58] are because they're messengers of the
[45:59] word of god
[46:01] right now to prove that you've got to
[46:03] have proof right
[46:04] uh go back to revelation 12. this
[46:07] chapter is just
[46:08] chock full mind it's just loaded with
[46:10] revelation
[46:11] what would we do without the book of
[46:12] revelation it solves so many
[46:14] doctrinal issues uh it just gives us the
[46:19] it's the unveiling that's what the word
[46:20] means unveil it's the truth unveiled
[46:22] before us
[46:23] praise god revelation 12.
[46:31] all right now verse 13.
[46:35] and when the dragon saw that he was cast
[46:37] unto the earth he persecuted the woman
[46:39] which brought forth the man child now
[46:41] he's cast to the earth after the rapture
[46:44] this is when he persecutes israel verse
[46:48] 14.
[46:48] and to the woman were given two wings of
[46:50] a great eagle
[46:53] that she might fly into the wilderness
[46:55] into her place
[46:56] where she is nourished for a time times
[46:59] and half a time
[47:00] from the face of the serpent now a time
[47:03] is a year
[47:04] and i don't have the scripture on that
[47:05] but a time and times
[47:07] and a half three and a half so it's
[47:10] three and a half years
[47:12] so this woman has wings and she's
[47:14] carried away
[47:15] from the serpent right and it's israel
[47:19] being carried away for three and a half
[47:20] years spiritually
[47:22] and she's uniting to the two prophets
[47:25] because the next
[47:25] verse says she's fed for three and a
[47:27] half years who she's what is she fed and
[47:29] who's she fed by
[47:30] it's got to be somebody with the word of
[47:31] god right what feeds you
[47:34] the word of god right the word of god is
[47:36] your food
[47:37] verse 15 and the serpent cast out his
[47:40] mouth
[47:41] i'm sorry out of his mouth water as a
[47:43] flood after the woman
[47:44] that he might cause her to be carried
[47:46] away the flood and the earth helped the
[47:48] woman and the
[47:49] earth opened her her mouth and swallowed
[47:52] up the
[47:53] the flood which the dragon cast out of
[47:55] his mouth
[47:56] and the dragon was wroth with the woman
[47:57] and went to make war with the remnant of
[47:59] her seed
[48:00] okay 144 000 is the remnant of israel
[48:04] which keep the commandments of god and
[48:07] have the testimony of jesus christ there
[48:09] it is when the 144 thousand receive
[48:10] jesus christ
[48:12] they're gonna make war against it
[48:15] right so that's when satan makes war
[48:17] against the 144 thousand
[48:20] okay you nourish yeah so nourish in
[48:22] verse 14 means fed
[48:25] okay and notice how many wings did she
[48:27] have two
[48:28] so this scripture uh revelation 12 14
[48:31] proves that a nation is represented by a
[48:34] woman
[48:35] and a nation with wings just represents
[48:37] a nation on the move
[48:39] right so if we go back to zechariah the
[48:42] two women were two nations
[48:44] that were taken israel carrying her off
[48:46] to babylon
[48:48] there's no women angels some of us got
[48:51] to be careful on the message i've seen
[48:52] message people post
[48:53] memes and they got women angels on them
[48:55] or baby angels with wings
[48:58] you'd never see a thing in the scripture
[49:00] right it's like brother man said that
[49:01] what was the
[49:02] angel i think he said it was six foot
[49:04] two is that right the ramp said
[49:05] he's two i know he said he's 200 pounds
[49:08] right 200 pounds
[49:09] i thought he said he was six foot two
[49:10] two hundred pounds ram was like five
[49:13] was he five three or five four he was
[49:16] shorter man but strong in the word
[49:19] tremendously strong in the word
[49:22] seventh angel with the word but the the
[49:24] angel was six foot two two hundred
[49:26] pounds
[49:27] large and he said he had fierce eyes and
[49:30] you know hair down to the shoulder and
[49:32] so angels
[49:34] are always men all right now let's go to
[49:37] hebrews 13
[49:38] 1-2 and here's where we start getting
[49:41] into
[49:41] the bodies of angels hebrews 13 1-2
[49:57] all right now look at look at the
[49:59] context here in
[50:00] chapter 12 he just said god is a
[50:02] consuming fire uh
[50:04] he's got god's gonna take he's gonna
[50:05] shake all the nations and then he
[50:07] jumps after this great warning he jumps
[50:09] into verse one let brotherly love
[50:11] continue
[50:12] i just love the bible writers right they
[50:14] they build up all this judgment and
[50:16] wrath and
[50:17] and then they go i love everybody now i
[50:20] love your brother like we saw with the
[50:21] philippians right paul will warn them
[50:23] and
[50:23] say these are a bunch of dogs i'm
[50:25] weeping with tears stay away from these
[50:26] dogs
[50:27] and then he gets back into be united in
[50:30] your minds love one another
[50:31] set your affections on things above they
[50:34] just as they're led by the holy spirit
[50:37] let bloody love continue be not
[50:39] forgetful to entertain
[50:41] strangers i don't know about you but i
[50:44] have a hard time sometimes with
[50:45] strangers because i'm just
[50:46] concerned about all the evil in this
[50:48] world right it's the days of noah
[50:50] and there's wickedness right everywhere
[50:53] um
[50:54] for thereby some have entertained angels
[50:57] unawares okay so the bible tells us
[51:01] church
[51:01] don't be for don't forget about that and
[51:04] in karen
[51:04] in karen's case you know she said she
[51:06] learned a lesson to
[51:07] entertain angels so you have to remember
[51:10] if they're strangers
[51:11] uh the bible said don't forget try to
[51:14] remember it might be an angel of god
[51:16] now that'd be something extremely
[51:17] tremendous wouldn't it now how many
[51:19] raise your hand how many think you have
[51:20] entertained angel anybody want to share
[51:21] it with anybody
[51:24] all right i guess brother van because
[51:26] brother man says when
[51:28] somebody repents angels visit your home
[51:30] so i was preaching years ago when
[51:32] acacia and lydia gave their heart to the
[51:34] lord i was preaching those months right
[51:36] before that about
[51:37] zechariah and elizabeth and living such
[51:40] a godly life until the angels visit your
[51:42] home so i was
[51:43] i was kind of presuming saying angels
[51:45] visited my home
[51:46] and led my girls to repent because i
[51:48] still remember the morning when
[51:50] you walked i was studying outside and
[51:51] she walked around and was weeping and
[51:53] gave her heart to the lord there
[51:54] acacia so i'm just presuming but i don't
[51:58] know
[51:58] you might know you might know a literal
[52:00] angel visited you
[52:02] but the bible tells us not not to be
[52:04] forgetful because when we entertain
[52:06] angels i'm sorry entertain strangers
[52:07] it may be angels now i looked up quotes
[52:10] on this and brother branham
[52:12] he uses this to reference genesis 18. so
[52:15] let's go to genesis 18 which is a
[52:17] type of our day right it's a type of the
[52:19] rapture the last visit
[52:21] thus saith the lord the last sign before
[52:23] the rapture genesis 18.
[52:32] okay so remember verse one the lord
[52:34] appeared unto him in the plane of
[52:36] mamrie and he sat in the tent door in
[52:39] the heat of the day
[52:41] okay then he sees three men i'm just
[52:43] gonna skip down a little bit
[52:44] and so abraham gets so excited honey go
[52:47] kill the animal you know
[52:48] let's make some butter and bread and
[52:50] meats
[52:51] and this where brother said god's not a
[52:53] vegetarian
[52:55] god eats meat now you might be healthier
[52:59] in the long run
[53:00] right eating vegetables only but god was
[53:03] not a vegetarian
[53:05] so uh let's uh verse eight and he took
[53:09] the butter and milk and the calf
[53:12] quite a meal there which he addressed
[53:15] and said it before them and he stood by
[53:17] them under the tree and they
[53:19] they did eat so here's where i made the
[53:21] mistake yesterday sister when
[53:23] uh so angels have a celestial body
[53:26] but god can put a physical body like
[53:28] brother man said like a vacuum cleaner
[53:30] suck up the
[53:31] the molecules right the dust and create
[53:33] a physical body
[53:35] and they can eat okay
[53:38] so but ram said that was jesus's
[53:41] theophany
[53:42] the vampire was jesus logos he said the
[53:43] logos come down
[53:45] and picked up all the particles to make
[53:48] a flesh body and then
[53:50] ate so
[53:53] i was wrong so forgive me i was wrong
[53:54] yesterday it wasn't fresh on my mind
[53:56] uh but god see god because remember the
[53:59] two
[53:59] angels went down to sodom but god stayed
[54:01] with abraham amen
[54:03] god's saying with abraham seed praise
[54:05] god that's us
[54:07] hallelujah and so
[54:11] we have this uh idea here
[54:14] where angels can put on
[54:17] a fleshly body but here's the key they
[54:20] can't
[54:20] change into a physical body
[54:24] so they can't leave from being a
[54:26] theophany
[54:27] and leave that and become a full man
[54:31] okay and here's the quote brotherham
[54:32] says put it on the whole armor of god
[54:36] he said when the sons of god saw the
[54:38] daughters of men
[54:40] he said the historians thought the sons
[54:41] of god he said it was fallen angels that
[54:43] pressed themselves into human flesh
[54:45] and seen women and how appealing that
[54:47] woman was and these
[54:48] sons of god became flesh but the man
[54:51] said if you take it that way my precious
[54:53] brother
[54:54] you're smarter than i am if you do that
[54:56] you make the devil a creator
[54:59] so the devil cannot create he just
[55:02] perverts what
[55:03] god's created that was a good point i
[55:06] wouldn't i forgot about that
[55:07] satan cannot create he could only
[55:09] pervert
[55:11] right so angels cannot create their own
[55:13] bodies
[55:14] with human seed right because they'd
[55:17] have to create their own human body
[55:18] and human seed in order to mix with the
[55:21] human egg
[55:22] right they can't do that but
[55:25] angels can possess human bodies and make
[55:28] humans do things
[55:30] because that's what every demon is right
[55:32] a demon is a fallen angel
[55:34] and where do they possess people in
[55:35] their minds right they're human spirits
[55:39] so demons can get in people's spirits
[55:42] but they can't change from a spirit
[55:44] to a physical they can't create
[55:45] themselves their own physical body
[55:48] and get out of that theophany and then
[55:51] be in a human body because then they'd
[55:54] be a creator
[55:56] okay so quite a subject that's
[56:00] got some deep questions brother you guys
[56:02] he was asking about the millennium
[56:03] yesterday i'm like i don't know brother
[56:05] i'll give you my guess like i told you
[56:07] i'll give you my guess but i don't know
[56:09] some of these things are so mysterious
[56:12] that god has kept them
[56:14] to reveal to us later praise god
[56:18] all right so uh that's one example of an
[56:21] entertaining angel remember samson's
[56:23] parents
[56:24] remember samson's mom met the angel she
[56:26] went home and told her hubby
[56:27] hey come over here let's look go again
[56:29] the angel came again
[56:31] and they they made the cake and then the
[56:33] angel ascended and they knew
[56:34] god was god and angel let them know
[56:36] you're gonna have a son named samson
[56:38] uh god visited gideon he said
[56:41] mighty man of valor see the angel knew
[56:43] his potential praise god
[56:45] god knows your potential too praise god
[56:48] brother man i really appreciate that i'm
[56:49] gonna
[56:50] i was thinking about that all week
[56:51] brother bang lying vanities
[56:53] see brother that's where we can be
[56:55] mighty men of valor
[56:57] ever understand that in a situation
[56:59] where it looks like everything is lost
[57:01] just quote the word quote the word lying
[57:04] behind
[57:04] and brother that makes us that makes us
[57:06] conquer that makes us more than
[57:08] conquerors in christ jesus
[57:10] i've been thinking about that off and on
[57:11] all week any problem i've just had said
[57:13] i've just said lying vanity
[57:14] line vanity praise god because that's
[57:18] that's when we are mighty men of valor
[57:20] that's when we are the
[57:21] sons of god that we should be praise god
[57:24] when we're quoting god's word
[57:26] hallelujah that's where i think that we
[57:29] can see in our lives where
[57:31] wow we're more than human god has given
[57:34] us this supernatural ability
[57:36] as long as we as long as we abide in
[57:38] god's will and obey god's leading
[57:41] then we see his supernatural hand
[57:44] that's right
[57:47] okay i'm just going down through my
[57:49] notes here real quick okay so yeah
[57:50] um let's then go to genesis 6 1 and 2
[57:54] just to read that since we're already
[57:55] here
[57:55] so angels can take on a physical body
[57:58] and eat uh
[58:02] but they can't create their own body and
[58:04] then have their own
[58:06] seed life they can't do that okay
[58:10] dennis so that's why genesis 6 1-2 is
[58:12] not fallen
[58:13] angels it's fallen believers
[58:16] men that have fallen short of the glory
[58:18] of god
[58:21] remember in those days church remember
[58:23] they could only be justified and
[58:24] sanctified how many
[58:25] remember that they couldn't get the
[58:27] baptism in the soul
[58:28] they could only be justified and
[58:30] sanctified so these were sons of god
[58:32] that were of the rights
[58:34] lineage but they made uh they made an
[58:37] awful mistake on the second biggest
[58:39] decision of their lives
[58:41] and god said this is awful this is
[58:43] causing all this unbelief
[58:45] and i'm going to flood the earth because
[58:46] of it see how important our marriages
[58:48] are by god's grace
[58:49] see how important that is genesis 6 1-2
[58:52] and it came to pass when men began to
[58:54] multiply on the face of the earth
[58:55] and daughters were born unto them that
[58:58] the sons of god saw the daughters of men
[59:00] that they were fair
[59:01] and they took them wives of all which
[59:04] they chose
[59:06] now look even in verse three if you look
[59:07] at the context god's not saying uh
[59:10] my spirit shall not always drive with
[59:12] angels right
[59:14] he's saying my spirit shall not always
[59:15] strive with man
[59:17] so we gotta look at the context and
[59:18] where the verse four is the giants there
[59:20] were giants in the earth in those days
[59:22] uh and also after that when the sons of
[59:25] god came in unto the daughters of men
[59:27] and they bear children to them the same
[59:29] became men mighty men of
[59:31] which were of old men of renown so these
[59:35] uh these marriages between the sons of
[59:37] god and the serpent seed created this
[59:40] intellectual race that's what we got
[59:42] today right intellectualism
[59:44] instead of faith in god's word so we see
[59:47] so many parallels
[59:48] from there to today how much time we got
[59:50] okay again i've been going about half an
[59:52] hour
[59:53] okay so let me look at the next one here
[59:56] angel was present
[59:59] all right let's go to psalms about and
[1:00:01] camp the angel lord and camp about those
[1:00:03] that fear the lord
[1:00:04] so let me pull it up here uh psalms 34
[1:00:12] 7.
[1:00:16] okay so this word and camp means to
[1:00:19] decline or
[1:00:20] go down to to bend down uh to lay
[1:00:24] siege against to encamp
[1:00:28] okay so it's to come down and be with
[1:00:32] so psalms 34 7 the angel of the lord and
[1:00:36] campeth
[1:00:37] round about them that fear him and
[1:00:39] delivereth him
[1:00:42] okay so you would think of an unbeliever
[1:00:44] right what does the unbeliever have
[1:00:45] they're full
[1:00:45] filled with fallen demons right right
[1:00:48] they're called
[1:00:49] like the maniac of godera he's filled
[1:00:50] with demons right but
[1:00:52] because he didn't fear the lord but a
[1:00:54] man that fears the lord he's got the
[1:00:55] protection
[1:00:56] of the lord praise god
[1:01:00] okay so here's where that question came
[1:01:02] with guardian angels now there's just a
[1:01:04] few quotes wendy went through him
[1:01:06] thoroughly more thoroughly than i did
[1:01:08] yesterday
[1:01:10] brother ram says garden angels a couple
[1:01:12] of times
[1:01:13] uh but he never preaches a whole sermon
[1:01:15] on it like i was sharing yesterday we
[1:01:16] gotta be really careful
[1:01:18] uh what we make a major doctrine and
[1:01:20] what we just
[1:01:21] keep at a minor doctrine like brother
[1:01:23] branham did
[1:01:25] okay so the question is do we have a
[1:01:27] guardian angel i personally think we do
[1:01:30] um because of this the angel lord in
[1:01:32] camps around them
[1:01:34] that fear him uh and delivereth them
[1:01:38] and then remember they rejoice when you
[1:01:40] get saved
[1:01:42] so they're you know by god's four
[1:01:44] knowledge he knows you're going to
[1:01:45] repent eventually right so he has his
[1:01:46] angel there
[1:01:47] protecting just like oh just like moses
[1:01:50] in that ark
[1:01:51] all those crocodiles want to eat them
[1:01:52] but the angels of the lord are right
[1:01:53] there saying get back
[1:01:55] get back i'm protecting my holy seed
[1:01:57] praise god
[1:01:58] god only it was only four dollars right
[1:02:01] moses was a baby he wasn't saved yet
[1:02:04] but it was god by foreknowledge
[1:02:06] protecting that art praise god
[1:02:08] amen
[1:02:11] so the angel lord encampeth round about
[1:02:13] them that fear him
[1:02:14] and delivereth him uh
[1:02:20] let me uh type i'm looking for this one
[1:02:22] it's just coming to me now
[1:02:23] okay yeah go to matthew 18.
[1:02:27] this is this is the scripture where
[1:02:28] brother man uses it for
[1:02:30] a uh he uses it for a uh
[1:02:34] guardian angel
[1:02:42] and this may be now brother amen had a
[1:02:45] good question too
[1:02:46] is the angel always there not that i
[1:02:48] don't know that it could go back
[1:02:50] up and down i don't know um it would
[1:02:52] come down when you need it right it's
[1:02:54] it's sent to help uh
[1:02:58] so or it could be there the whole time
[1:02:59] i'm not really sure i can't really think
[1:03:01] of a scripture that would answer that
[1:03:03] for sure or not
[1:03:04] because if if this is if this is
[1:03:06] speaking of an angel
[1:03:09] um then the bible says they're always
[1:03:12] beholding the father's face in heaven
[1:03:14] if that would mean the father would say
[1:03:16] go down there protect wendy
[1:03:17] go down there protect jesse right
[1:03:21] if that's the right interpretation so
[1:03:24] matthew 18 10
[1:03:25] take heed that you despise not one of
[1:03:27] these little ones for i say unto you
[1:03:28] that in heaven their
[1:03:30] angels do oh there it is they're angels
[1:03:33] they're angels theirs belongs to them
[1:03:36] right assigned to them
[1:03:38] their angels do always always
[1:03:41] behold the face of my father which is in
[1:03:43] heaven
[1:03:45] okay so i could be wrong on this but it
[1:03:48] looks like
[1:03:49] this is a guardian angel scripture
[1:03:51] because even the little ones have angels
[1:03:53] protecting them praise god
[1:03:54] thank god for that all right
[1:03:58] so beautiful scripture there beholding
[1:04:00] the face of my father which is in heaven
[1:04:02] now i've used i don't know if you
[1:04:03] remember this or not
[1:04:04] bang might remember but i use this
[1:04:06] scripture in the past with amen
[1:04:08] to possibly refer to theophanies because
[1:04:10] brother brown used it the theophanies
[1:04:12] it's in who is this melchizedek
[1:04:13] so brother brandon uses this in two
[1:04:15] different ways he uses it as you have a
[1:04:17] guardian angel
[1:04:18] but then he uses it and who's this
[1:04:20] melchizedek as your theophany's waiting
[1:04:22] there which paul says
[1:04:23] you have a body eternal the heavens now
[1:04:26] here's a little
[1:04:27] deeper then some people believe your
[1:04:30] theophany
[1:04:31] is your angel and it's just your body
[1:04:34] but i don't believe that i don't believe
[1:04:36] that i don't
[1:04:38] some people some people it may be but i
[1:04:40] don't believe that
[1:04:42] uh because see they put these two quotes
[1:04:43] together with these two scriptures
[1:04:45] and they say well my theophanies in
[1:04:46] heaven obama uses
[1:04:48] and then uh that's my angel
[1:04:52] my angel is my fiance i don't believe
[1:04:55] that
[1:04:56] i believe uh i believe angels are their
[1:04:58] own separate individual beings
[1:05:01] and i believe they're worshippers praise
[1:05:02] god i believe i believe they're
[1:05:04] rejoicers
[1:05:05] they're warriors praise god uh that's
[1:05:08] just my opinion i could be wrong
[1:05:09] but is that something that uh is that
[1:05:11] something to get upset about with your
[1:05:12] brother and say hey let's fight you know
[1:05:13] let's have a cold war is that something
[1:05:15] is that something to split a church over
[1:05:16] brotherhood no it's just so so minor
[1:05:20] like instead of worrying about that why
[1:05:22] don't we just get instead of fighting
[1:05:23] over that why don't we fight the devil
[1:05:24] in prayer
[1:05:25] i try to get somebody saved by god's
[1:05:27] grace
[1:05:28] you see so we got to be very careful
[1:05:30] especially in the message
[1:05:32] not to let satan exalt us in pride and
[1:05:36] say well i know more about it than this
[1:05:37] person
[1:05:38] and then argue and debate over minor
[1:05:41] things
[1:05:42] okay and i always want to have this
[1:05:44] attitude lord i can always learn more i
[1:05:46] can always grow in grace and knowledge
[1:05:47] of the lord
[1:05:49] all right you always want to have that a
[1:05:51] humble attitude
[1:05:56] okay so their angels all right so there
[1:05:58] so
[1:05:59] it really truly does look like each of
[1:06:02] us have
[1:06:03] a guardian angel from that scripture if
[1:06:06] it's applied
[1:06:07] in that way okay uh let's go
[1:06:11] all right there's just so many good ones
[1:06:12] here let's go to uh second king six
[1:06:15] fifteen and sixteen this is elisha i
[1:06:17] kept saying
[1:06:18] elijah this morning it's elisha
[1:06:21] elisha at gotham okay elisha
[1:06:25] second kings 6 15 and 16. can you put
[1:06:28] that up there casey when you got a
[1:06:30] chance
[1:06:33] and so this is where i don't know um how
[1:06:36] many angels we have
[1:06:38] assigned to us um
[1:06:41] and i'm not sure why there was such a
[1:06:43] huge multitude
[1:06:46] maybe it was all of israel's angels i
[1:06:47] don't know and when the servant of the
[1:06:49] man of god was risen early and gone
[1:06:51] forth behold and host
[1:06:52] compasses city both with horses and
[1:06:54] chariots and the servant said in them
[1:06:56] alas my master how shall we do and he
[1:06:58] answered fear not
[1:06:59] for they that be with us are more than
[1:07:01] they that be with them
[1:07:03] talk about seeing in the other dimension
[1:07:05] praise god
[1:07:07] the prophet by the way he's not even
[1:07:09] sweating a drop surrounded by enemies
[1:07:11] he's like
[1:07:12] don't worry about it there's more with
[1:07:15] us
[1:07:15] than with them next verse acacia verse
[1:07:18] 17
[1:07:19] and elisha prayed and said lord i pray
[1:07:21] thee open his eyes
[1:07:23] that he may see and the lord opened the
[1:07:25] eyes the young man he saw
[1:07:26] and behold the mountain was full of
[1:07:28] horses and chariots
[1:07:29] of fire around about elisha my how many
[1:07:33] are here tonight church amen
[1:07:34] glory how are you here tonight around
[1:07:37] god's people
[1:07:38] praise god i say this scripture
[1:07:41] comforted me when i first went to guyana
[1:07:42] it's my first time in a third world
[1:07:43] country
[1:07:44] we drove from the airport over then to
[1:07:46] georgetown
[1:07:47] but amen we drove by armed guards with
[1:07:50] uh
[1:07:51] ak-47s and ar-15s
[1:07:54] i'm like i'm gonna die here but i just
[1:07:57] but they just looked at the car you know
[1:07:59] and let it go
[1:08:00] and i realized later it's because god's
[1:08:02] angels are with us praise god
[1:08:04] and i'm reminded of that now that time i
[1:08:06] was really nervous but as you go on and
[1:08:08] learn
[1:08:09] you realize that if god before you who
[1:08:10] can be against you
[1:08:14] so angel armies that's what that song
[1:08:16] chris thomas sings the god of angel
[1:08:17] armies praise god
[1:08:19] he said open the eyes that our servant
[1:08:22] can see
[1:08:22] all the angels that surround us amen
[1:08:25] thank you jesus
[1:08:28] now there's three kinds of angels in
[1:08:30] scripture
[1:08:33] seraphim
[1:08:37] cherubim and archangel
[1:08:40] now there could be more because i didn't
[1:08:42] amen i didn't devote a lot of hours to
[1:08:44] this
[1:08:44] in fact i didn't devote any time to
[1:08:45] studying yesterday i never any time i
[1:08:47] just looked at it between services so
[1:08:49] there could be more
[1:08:51] but there's at least three kinds of
[1:08:52] angels
[1:08:54] uh the word archangel means the chief of
[1:08:56] the angels
[1:08:59] it's the highest rank okay
[1:09:03] cherubims um the definition
[1:09:06] is just cherubim and it looks like
[1:09:08] they're thrown guards
[1:09:09] okay that's what it looks like because
[1:09:11] they they always guard
[1:09:12] uh they always guard the presence of god
[1:09:15] right and there was cherubims on the
[1:09:16] mercy seat
[1:09:17] so you have archangel the chief angel
[1:09:20] then you have
[1:09:21] cherubims uh and then we know they
[1:09:25] surround the throne or
[1:09:26] around god's presence there and then
[1:09:29] their seraphims which are
[1:09:31] the word actually means fiery or burners
[1:09:35] and so these are angels that do the
[1:09:38] heavenly worship service
[1:09:40] so there's at least three kinds can
[1:09:41] anybody think of any other kinds of
[1:09:42] angels okay
[1:09:45] just those three i'm just curious if
[1:09:48] anybody can remember
[1:09:50] i just saw that like i like your help
[1:09:51] when you can give me some help and so
[1:09:53] every now and then i'll ask you for some
[1:09:54] help because i didn't get a
[1:09:56] lot of chance to study on that one um
[1:09:59] but yeah remember exodus 25 the
[1:10:01] cherubims faced each other
[1:10:02] had two wings and they were next to the
[1:10:05] mercy sea of
[1:10:06] uh the ark of god where god communed
[1:10:08] with the high priest
[1:10:10] okay so we've always thought michael and
[1:10:12] lucifer
[1:10:13] were the cherubims but then michael when
[1:10:15] lucifer got cast down
[1:10:17] then michael would have been the highest
[1:10:18] angel the archangel
[1:10:20] but i could be wrong on that there could
[1:10:22] be something else but that's just what
[1:10:24] we have
[1:10:25] uh as far as our understanding right now
[1:10:28] all right so
[1:10:30] let's look at the next one uh let's go
[1:10:32] to matthew 22.
[1:10:38] coming down to close i got about 15
[1:10:40] minutes here let's uh
[1:10:42] finish up here by god's grace i
[1:10:44] appreciate everybody's attention tonight
[1:10:45] by god's grace
[1:10:46] and also different more like a teaching
[1:10:48] and
[1:10:50] not really rebuking sin or anything like
[1:10:52] that just trying to increase your faith
[1:10:54] and teach you the word of god here
[1:10:55] tonight matthew 22 25.
[1:11:14] matthew 22 25.
[1:11:19] while you're turning there i still think
[1:11:20] remember i told you that story when i
[1:11:21] was driving to football practice in
[1:11:22] college
[1:11:23] my my buddy was driving 90 miles per
[1:11:25] hour we spun across
[1:11:27] three you know four lanes if you include
[1:11:29] the exit lane
[1:11:30] and we stopped god's our witness uh got
[1:11:33] we stopped
[1:11:33] maybe three inches from that concrete
[1:11:35] barrier
[1:11:37] and he couldn't even get out because his
[1:11:39] window or his door was right up against
[1:11:40] there couldn't get out
[1:11:42] we both had to climb out and as soon as
[1:11:44] we came to a stop
[1:11:46] all the trucks came flying by now what
[1:11:48] was that church
[1:11:50] that's angels of god amen right
[1:11:52] ministering
[1:11:53] protecting god's seed amen god needed a
[1:11:56] pastor in akron praise god amen that's
[1:11:58] his grace
[1:11:59] that's his grace to me but how
[1:12:02] i mean what other awful things we didn't
[1:12:04] flip or anything we just went
[1:12:05] you're just like uh 180s uh sure
[1:12:09] what's the circle eights what are those
[1:12:10] called what is it
[1:12:13] three sixties yeah i'm thinking of the
[1:12:16] eight one
[1:12:17] figure eight there it is yeah thanks
[1:12:18] brother that's the one i was thinking
[1:12:20] but just figure eight across and the 360
[1:12:22] until it came to a perfect stop
[1:12:24] right there no damage to any of us uh
[1:12:27] just amazing grace
[1:12:28] i'll say like this same by inches say by
[1:12:31] inches
[1:12:32] god's mercy so matthew 22
[1:12:35] as i have on here 25 to 33 but we won't
[1:12:38] read all that
[1:12:39] uh for time's sake jesus is
[1:12:42] uh answering the sadducees questions
[1:12:45] who's this woman going to marry in the
[1:12:46] resurrection right
[1:12:48] she each of her husbands dies she's
[1:12:50] married seven different brothers
[1:12:52] who's she gonna marry in the
[1:12:53] resurrection verse 29 jesus answered and
[1:12:55] said unto them
[1:12:56] you ye do air not knowing the scriptures
[1:12:58] nor the power of god
[1:13:00] for in the resurrection they neither
[1:13:02] marry
[1:13:03] nor are given in marriage so there's
[1:13:05] gonna be no wedding ceremonies in heaven
[1:13:07] right
[1:13:09] we're not gonna have to go to any
[1:13:10] wedding ceremonies right the only
[1:13:11] wedding ceremony is ours amen with jesus
[1:13:15] hallelujah praise god and that's the
[1:13:16] rapture and then the reception is
[1:13:18] the merits up for the lamb praise god
[1:13:20] then the honeymoon
[1:13:22] amen and then the future hope praise god
[1:13:27] so see he said you not heir you air
[1:13:30] rather not knowing the scriptures nor
[1:13:31] the power of god
[1:13:34] so they thought which one is she going
[1:13:35] to be married to in heaven he said you
[1:13:37] don't know the power of god
[1:13:40] verse 30 from the resurrection they
[1:13:41] neither marry nor given in marriage
[1:13:43] but are as the angels of god in heaven
[1:13:47] so now let's put our learning together
[1:13:49] right they're all men
[1:13:52] right angels are all men they can't
[1:13:55] press in the flesh in mary right
[1:13:57] because this scripture says right
[1:14:01] so we don't we we can't uh
[1:14:04] we can't say there's going to be wedding
[1:14:05] ceremonies in heaven
[1:14:07] because the angels don't marry right and
[1:14:10] let me read you this
[1:14:11] quote from brother branham because this
[1:14:12] explains it the best i've ever heard
[1:14:13] this is a true sign that's overlooked
[1:14:15] 1961. he said oh i love that word jesus
[1:14:18] said you do always err not knowing the
[1:14:20] scriptures
[1:14:21] neither the power of god oh how he would
[1:14:23] blaze that out today if he was standing
[1:14:25] here
[1:14:26] you always err not knowing the
[1:14:27] scriptures the power of god's associated
[1:14:30] in the scripture
[1:14:32] you do air greatly then he went on to
[1:14:33] say in the resurrection
[1:14:35] they neither marry nor given in marriage
[1:14:37] but they're like
[1:14:38] angels so jesus was trying to tell these
[1:14:42] pharisees they're like angels he said he
[1:14:44] didn't say they'd be
[1:14:46] angels now but they'd be like angels
[1:14:49] he says sex glands would be out of them
[1:14:52] they don't marry
[1:14:53] nor give in marriage praise god that's
[1:14:56] what jesus is trying to say
[1:14:58] he says you don't know the power of god
[1:15:00] you're thinking this woman has to be
[1:15:01] married to all those seven men
[1:15:03] and they're going to reproduce in heaven
[1:15:04] that's a mormon thought
[1:15:06] right that's a mormon thought and jesus
[1:15:08] said they're not going to have any
[1:15:10] sex glands you don't know the power of
[1:15:11] god right
[1:15:14] he said they're not going to have sex
[1:15:15] glands they're not going there's going
[1:15:16] to be no marriage ceremonies there i
[1:15:18] believe it like this
[1:15:19] that woman who had the seven husbands
[1:15:21] should be married to one of them
[1:15:24] that's what i believe now with brother
[1:15:26] there could be two i don't know how
[1:15:27] that's going to work
[1:15:28] but they're not going to have any
[1:15:29] relations because there's no desires for
[1:15:32] that
[1:15:33] there's just pure holiness there's only
[1:15:35] holy desires not carnal desires
[1:15:37] amen like the brother
[1:15:40] a brother from overseas from australia
[1:15:43] was texting me
[1:15:44] last winter he's like what about this
[1:15:46] scripture are you going to be with your
[1:15:47] wife and glory i said absolutely
[1:15:49] he said well prove it to me i said okay
[1:15:53] i said do you think adam's going to have
[1:15:54] a different house than he
[1:15:56] you think they're going to live in a
[1:15:57] different mansion adam's going to live
[1:15:59] over here on the north and then he's
[1:16:00] going to live down in the south
[1:16:02] she came out of him she's a part of him
[1:16:06] and i said what about christ i said
[1:16:08] christ is it
[1:16:09] the bible says when we get raptured we
[1:16:11] shall ever be with the lord
[1:16:13] right that's the whole point the whole
[1:16:15] point of this gentile age is for jesus
[1:16:17] to get a bride amen someone he can live
[1:16:20] with forever praise god somebody can
[1:16:22] call his own
[1:16:23] remember he said i come to take a people
[1:16:25] out for my namesake
[1:16:27] that's what this whole story is about a
[1:16:28] marriage praise god
[1:16:32] remember that's his bride right there's
[1:16:34] there's thousands upon thousands that
[1:16:35] minister to him the jews
[1:16:37] but then there's the gentile bride
[1:16:39] praise god
[1:16:42] and then the other one was remember 1st
[1:16:44] peter 3 uh joint heirs
[1:16:46] together of the grace of god so let me
[1:16:48] let me read that first peter 3
[1:16:49] that's the other scripture and it made
[1:16:50] him happy i said good john i kind of
[1:16:53] wiped my brow and said well thank god
[1:16:54] that because i didn't have any other
[1:16:55] scriptures after that
[1:16:57] either because there's not a whole lot
[1:16:58] in scripture
[1:17:01] joint heirs means together that means
[1:17:04] your husband your wife and husband you
[1:17:06] inherit things
[1:17:08] together right it belongs to both of you
[1:17:11] so that's scriptural
[1:17:15] if eve is a part of adam then god has uh
[1:17:18] it's not so much physical it's the
[1:17:19] spiritual part right because they were
[1:17:21] one spirit first so
[1:17:22] there's one person likely right unless
[1:17:24] you're paul or somebody
[1:17:25] i don't know there's one person likely
[1:17:27] that is kindred to your spirit and
[1:17:29] that's the one you're supposed to be
[1:17:31] with praise god
[1:17:32] i believe that in many cases now there's
[1:17:34] a whole other question on that but i
[1:17:36] won't get to that tonight here
[1:17:37] first peter 3 and uh
[1:17:43] yeah it's verse seven
[1:17:47] this is a good scripture on uh
[1:17:51] women honoring their husbands and then
[1:17:52] husbands loving their wives
[1:17:55] verse seven likewise the husbands dwell
[1:17:57] with them according to knowledge
[1:17:59] giving honor see brothers have to honor
[1:18:01] their wives
[1:18:03] unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel
[1:18:06] and as being heirs together of the grace
[1:18:08] of life
[1:18:09] that your prayers not be hindered okay
[1:18:11] so see that errors together of the
[1:18:13] graces of life the favors of life
[1:18:15] so your inheritors you and you get
[1:18:18] co-rewards
[1:18:19] right co-rewards
[1:18:22] okay so yeah is is matthew 22 a
[1:18:26] challenging scripture yeah i can't
[1:18:28] explain that
[1:18:28] but knowing what i know about all the
[1:18:30] other scriptures that causes me to say
[1:18:33] if a woman married seven men
[1:18:35] you know they all died one after another
[1:18:37] but that'd be a hard life
[1:18:38] uh perhaps one of them is her true
[1:18:41] husband
[1:18:42] okay perhaps one of them i don't know
[1:18:44] what you do with like brother brandon i
[1:18:45] don't know what you do with that
[1:18:46] remember brother had the dream though he
[1:18:48] said he went up to the white throne
[1:18:49] judgment and remember he said not white
[1:18:50] throne judgment the
[1:18:52] uh the judgment seat of christ for
[1:18:53] rewards but abraham said
[1:18:55] he said i'm not saying it's a vision he
[1:18:56] said it's a dream and he said i hope it
[1:18:58] will be
[1:18:59] so it wasn't thus saith the lord he had
[1:19:01] a dream he went up with hope
[1:19:02] and then he felt another hand touch it
[1:19:04] and it was mita
[1:19:05] he said i hope it's that way all right
[1:19:10] um okay so let's finish up here i got
[1:19:12] about eight minutes
[1:19:13] thanks for your patience
[1:19:17] all right a couple more we want to get
[1:19:19] to
[1:19:20] oh there's so many beautiful things here
[1:19:22] um
[1:19:25] let's go with um
[1:19:29] daniel 10 so daniel 10
[1:19:32] so this is the story you read a little
[1:19:34] bit about this yesterday
[1:19:36] uh of daniel seeking god's face wanting
[1:19:39] to know what's going to happen to his
[1:19:41] nation
[1:19:41] they were in exile it was coming down to
[1:19:44] the end of the 70-year prophecy where
[1:19:45] they were
[1:19:46] kept out of the promised land and he was
[1:19:49] reading jeremiah's writings
[1:19:51] and then uh he prayed and asked god he
[1:19:53] confessed his sins the sins of everyone
[1:19:55] in his family and then an angel finally
[1:19:59] broke through after 21 days
[1:20:01] all right so daniel 10.
[1:20:10] so chapter nine he sets his face uh gets
[1:20:13] the vision of the daniel 70 weeks
[1:20:15] in chapter 10. he was in more he fasted
[1:20:18] three weeks
[1:20:19] just a little bit of eat a little bit to
[1:20:20] eat for three weeks after the daniel 70
[1:20:22] weeks vision
[1:20:24] uh and then
[1:20:27] the angel came to him
[1:20:32] praise god and always love i always love
[1:20:33] what it said uh
[1:20:35] verse 11. my i just always love this
[1:20:37] here's what here's what angels think of
[1:20:39] your church here's what heaven thinks of
[1:20:40] you
[1:20:41] and he said unto me oh daniel a man
[1:20:43] greatly
[1:20:44] beloved what a message brother
[1:20:47] heaven loves me praise god oh that's
[1:20:50] what i want to hear praise god don't you
[1:20:53] heaven loves me jesus loves me the bible
[1:20:56] tells me so praise god
[1:20:57] but here an angel tells me so an angel
[1:21:01] tells me
[1:21:02] i'm greatly beloved in heaven understand
[1:21:04] the words that i speak unto thee now
[1:21:07] uh remember verse 13 but the prince of
[1:21:10] the kingdom of persia which stood me
[1:21:12] one in 21 days
[1:21:15] and lo michael one of the chief princes
[1:21:17] so one of the says here yeah this is a
[1:21:19] little tricky
[1:21:19] one of the chief princes so remember and
[1:21:23] judah calls him archangel
[1:21:24] here he says he's one of the princes so
[1:21:27] i don't know brother
[1:21:28] mystery at least for me right now uh
[1:21:31] came to help me and i remain there with
[1:21:34] the
[1:21:35] kings of persia now go to verse 20.
[1:21:38] then he said to me knowest thou
[1:21:40] wherefore i come unto thee and now i
[1:21:42] return to what
[1:21:44] to my picnic angels are fighting church
[1:21:47] and if they're fighting may we fight in
[1:21:49] prayer too
[1:21:51] they're fighting and wrestling against
[1:21:52] principalities and powers right
[1:21:56] with the prince of persia he's returning
[1:21:58] to the fight they're fighting
[1:22:01] and when i am gone forth lo the prince
[1:22:03] of greece shall come
[1:22:05] now let me say this i've been praying
[1:22:07] for years weeping and crying at this
[1:22:08] altar that god would rid this
[1:22:10] nation of abortion now if we get the
[1:22:12] victory
[1:22:13] if that happens i'm going to be just i'm
[1:22:16] going to be aware i'm going to believe
[1:22:17] that the angels of god broke through for
[1:22:19] my praying and
[1:22:21] fasting and crying because everybody
[1:22:23] says it's impossible
[1:22:24] and it may be but i've cried
[1:22:27] i've sighed and cried for the
[1:22:29] abominations done in this nation
[1:22:32] and i'm just going to see if god will do
[1:22:33] it by his grace
[1:22:35] and that would to me if that happens
[1:22:36] that will be an evidence everybody else
[1:22:38] thought it was impossible
[1:22:39] but god's angels stood up for our
[1:22:41] prayers amen
[1:22:42] i'm gonna that's what i'm believing and
[1:22:44] to me it's like
[1:22:46] that mountain's moving one rock at a
[1:22:48] time
[1:22:49] one rock at a time clarence thomas came
[1:22:51] out you see the article he come out and
[1:22:53] said we need to get rid of rogue versus
[1:22:54] wade it wasn't written the right way
[1:22:56] or it wasn't judged the right way
[1:22:57] clarence thomas said that i thought god
[1:22:59] blessed that man
[1:23:00] god bless that man and now trump's
[1:23:02] putting his third third
[1:23:04] justice up there and finally you know
[1:23:06] and you know
[1:23:08] the majority's been liberal since
[1:23:09] abortion
[1:23:11] since the 70s it's been a liberal
[1:23:14] uh supreme court justice for over what's
[1:23:17] that 40 50 years
[1:23:18] 50 years maybe more
[1:23:21] and now they're getting all upset
[1:23:23] because it might go conservative
[1:23:26] but one thing i know i've prayed before
[1:23:28] god i've asked god to do it i don't know
[1:23:29] if i'll do it but i have asked god
[1:23:31] and church god record god record my
[1:23:34] prayers just like he did daniel's praise
[1:23:36] god
[1:23:37] amen so this is where this is where the
[1:23:41] bible is real but amen this is where
[1:23:42] it's real i believe
[1:23:43] if we can get this victory it'll be
[1:23:45] absolute to me it'll be absolute
[1:23:46] vindication
[1:23:47] that angels have broke through the
[1:23:49] powers look think of the powers church
[1:23:51] over washington dc brother johnny now
[1:23:53] we're talking about that
[1:23:54] this deep state now there's a whole
[1:23:56] thing on that but
[1:23:58] you know these people are corrupt think
[1:24:00] of the demons that hover around there
[1:24:01] brother man said
[1:24:02] demons run every government satan's the
[1:24:05] one of everyone
[1:24:06] he's the head of every government think
[1:24:07] about that if he can break through and
[1:24:09] life can be saved that's nothing but
[1:24:11] god's grace
[1:24:13] but it had to be a wrestling fight
[1:24:15] against spiritual powers that's why we
[1:24:17] never give up praying amen
[1:24:19] because angels are fighting for us
[1:24:21] praise god i don't know you praise god
[1:24:25] amen
[1:24:29] where they're going to fight and so
[1:24:30] church where do we fight on our knees
[1:24:32] praise god and we plead with god we make
[1:24:35] our prayers
[1:24:35] and requests made known unto god and the
[1:24:37] peace of god which passes all
[1:24:39] understanding will keep your hearts and
[1:24:40] minds through christ jesus
[1:24:43] amen hallelujah
[1:24:48] okay so they're returning to fight
[1:24:51] angels are fighting
[1:24:53] then they rejoice praise god they
[1:24:54] rejoice when people get saved amen
[1:24:57] and they worship the lord they give god
[1:25:00] praise
[1:25:01] let me close here a couple more here i
[1:25:03] didn't have time to go through my order
[1:25:05] so i'm sorry i'm just kind of looking
[1:25:06] over
[1:25:06] making sure i get the most important
[1:25:08] ones uh we're not good well go and read
[1:25:11] it
[1:25:11] matthew 4 11 real quick just again how
[1:25:14] angels can come minister spiritual
[1:25:15] blessings to you
[1:25:16] like that's a perfect case with daniel
[1:25:19] the angel
[1:25:20] gives strength to daniel daniel's he's
[1:25:22] fast and he's weak after 21 days
[1:25:23] the angel come and strengthens him
[1:25:27] so matthew 4 11 jesus fasting 40 days
[1:25:31] and nights no food no water
[1:25:32] the devil leaves him and behold angels
[1:25:34] came and ministered unto him praise god
[1:25:37] hallelujah jesus received the blessings
[1:25:40] of the angels because they're ministers
[1:25:41] of god's spirit
[1:25:43] praise god now we know there's so many
[1:25:45] powers of angels like they delivered to
[1:25:47] three hebrew children jesus
[1:25:48] the angel delivered them
[1:25:52] one like the son of man in the flames
[1:25:54] and then the angels
[1:25:55] shut the mouth of lions praise god
[1:25:58] daniel and the lion's den
[1:25:59] so let's close with just a couple more
[1:26:01] scriptures i got a couple more here
[1:26:05] first corinthians 4 9 first corinthians
[1:26:07] 4 9.
[1:26:09] beautiful scripture our lives are a
[1:26:12] great theater how many know that our
[1:26:13] lives are like a theater
[1:26:16] this uh the world is like a stage
[1:26:20] and we are players on the stage
[1:26:23] and we know the one who wrote the story
[1:26:25] praise god
[1:26:26] we know who wrote the script praise god
[1:26:28] and we come to do our part when we
[1:26:30] realize oh i've got a part in this
[1:26:32] we come to do our part okay
[1:26:35] and god is really god is really and his
[1:26:37] angels are the only ones that know the
[1:26:38] will of god
[1:26:40] remember the bible said satan would not
[1:26:41] have crucified jesus had he known
[1:26:44] what was going to happen they would not
[1:26:45] have crucified the lord of glory
[1:26:47] because it's on a stage he does it all
[1:26:49] he's seeing it happen real
[1:26:50] real time like we are for i think that
[1:26:53] god has set forth us apostles last
[1:26:55] as it were appointed to death for we are
[1:26:58] made a spectacle that means theater
[1:27:00] we are made a theater unto the world and
[1:27:04] to angels
[1:27:05] and to men that's why brother ram said
[1:27:07] oh never call yourself weak in faith
[1:27:09] because those demons are watching us
[1:27:11] they're watching us on the stage
[1:27:13] oh that person said they're weak i'm
[1:27:15] gonna i know what they like
[1:27:16] i'm gonna bring this temptation i'm
[1:27:18] going to slip it in here
[1:27:20] see because they're they're watching
[1:27:22] don't ever confess you're a weak
[1:27:24] christian
[1:27:24] say i'm he said say i've got strong
[1:27:26] faith amen
[1:27:28] i'm more than a conqueror in christ
[1:27:29] jesus amen
[1:27:31] amen you start speaking the word the
[1:27:33] devil's got to flee anyway praise god
[1:27:35] resist him and he will flee praise god
[1:27:38] amen there's my hour so let me
[1:27:40] let me finish up here i'm just starting
[1:27:41] feeling good now here
[1:27:43] getting past all the all the tiredness
[1:27:45] and eating and everything like that
[1:27:47] it's a theater and so angels are
[1:27:49] watching
[1:27:51] and the evil ones when they uh the
[1:27:54] demons
[1:27:55] they watch and they respond but if we
[1:27:58] overcome them
[1:28:00] then we will judge them right
[1:28:04] first corinthians 6 3 know ye not we
[1:28:06] shall judge
[1:28:08] angels we were on the stage
[1:28:11] yet we were the ones being attacked we
[1:28:13] were the ones resisting them
[1:28:15] in the spiritual fight right the
[1:28:17] spiritual fight
[1:28:20] and so because we're able to resist them
[1:28:22] and drive them away then the bible says
[1:28:24] those will be the demons
[1:28:25] we judge at the white throne judgment
[1:28:28] if we can oh church if we can just
[1:28:30] overcome them now praise god
[1:28:32] can i say it like this if we can just
[1:28:34] judge that the word is right now
[1:28:36] we'll judge the fallen demons later
[1:28:38] praise god amen
[1:28:39] i'm talking about in everyday life right
[1:28:41] in our everyday lives
[1:28:43] uh in our church life and our family
[1:28:45] life if we can just judge that the word
[1:28:47] is right and not give in to fallen
[1:28:49] angels then we'll judge them later and
[1:28:50] condemn them
[1:28:52] for all their attacks on us to try to
[1:28:53] bring us down yet we overcame by the
[1:28:55] blood of jesus christ
[1:28:58] see we'll be a witness against those
[1:29:00] demons that tried to
[1:29:02] tear us down and separate our church and
[1:29:05] separate our families we'll be witnesses
[1:29:06] against them
[1:29:07] and we'll be overcomers because we've
[1:29:08] got the spiritual armor of god on
[1:29:10] amen glory
[1:29:16] all right last one i promise first peter
[1:29:19] 1
[1:29:19] 12. oh my
[1:29:23] we sing that song when the redeemed are
[1:29:26] gathering in
[1:29:28] washed like snow leave them all singing
[1:29:31] then the angels all will listen for they
[1:29:34] cannot
[1:29:35] join that song there's songs angels
[1:29:39] can't sing
[1:29:40] there's things angels don't know yet we
[1:29:43] know
[1:29:44] here it says it right here in the
[1:29:45] scripture unto whom it was revealed
[1:29:47] speaking of prophets now
[1:29:48] that not unto themselves but unto us
[1:29:51] they didn't minister these
[1:29:52] things so prophets wrote down the old
[1:29:54] testament scriptures
[1:29:55] and they didn't even understand it but
[1:29:57] we understand it now in the new
[1:29:59] testament praise god amen
[1:30:01] ezekiel probably didn't know what he was
[1:30:02] writing but amen a new heart
[1:30:04] new spirit and then my spirit praise god
[1:30:06] amen he didn't even probably know what
[1:30:08] he was talking about
[1:30:09] but we know it's god justifying us
[1:30:12] sanctifying us and filling us with the
[1:30:13] holy ghost praise god
[1:30:15] amen but they wrote it down maybe didn't
[1:30:17] understand it
[1:30:20] but unto us they did minister the things
[1:30:22] which are now reported
[1:30:24] unto you by them that have preached the
[1:30:27] gospel
[1:30:28] unto you with the holy ghost now see we
[1:30:30] gotta break what we need amen to preach
[1:30:32] with the holy ghost praise
[1:30:34] god amen i believe we are right i
[1:30:36] believe that
[1:30:37] that's what we need constantly preaching
[1:30:39] with the holy ghost
[1:30:42] set down from heaven which things the
[1:30:44] angels
[1:30:45] desire to look into lydia and i have
[1:30:48] talked about this at times we want to
[1:30:49] write like a
[1:30:50] a drama well i want to write one about
[1:30:52] angels
[1:30:53] and the angels in heaven you know kind
[1:30:55] of you know we know there's a book of
[1:30:56] life and the angels will try to look
[1:30:58] over there
[1:30:59] and sneak over there and god will say no
[1:31:00] get away
[1:31:02] no you're not allowed to look into these
[1:31:03] things these things are written for the
[1:31:05] redeemed of god
[1:31:07] they're written for us those of us here
[1:31:10] that
[1:31:10] are battling those of us in the human
[1:31:12] flesh thank god for angels praise god
[1:31:14] but we have a higher calling to sonship
[1:31:18] let's stand to our feet praise god

[1:31:25] the blood filled by the holy spirit
[1:31:29] we've fallen but they've been redeemed
[1:31:32] and angels the right ones have never
[1:31:34] fallen nor do they know about redemption
