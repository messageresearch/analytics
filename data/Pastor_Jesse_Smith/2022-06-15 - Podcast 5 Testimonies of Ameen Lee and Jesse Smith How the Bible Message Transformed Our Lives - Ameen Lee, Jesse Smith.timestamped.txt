[0:01] [Music]
[0:12] god bless you and welcome to the
[0:14] defending the message podcast i'm your
[0:16] co-host pastor jesse smith and we have
[0:18] our other co-hosts with us today
[0:20] hi i'm eamon and i'm glad to be here
[0:22] today with our pastor
[0:24] by god's grace we felt led to start
[0:26] recording some
[0:28] church testimonies of the saints
[0:30] in our church
[0:31] and we're going to use these testimonies
[0:33] by the grace of god to help defend the
[0:35] message because we know
[0:37] god's bible-based message today that he
[0:39] sent through his prophet brother william
[0:41] branham is under attack
[0:43] so there's a group that's left the
[0:44] message of brother branham and they're
[0:46] totally attacking it calling it false
[0:48] and all kinds of other words i would not
[0:50] repeat
[0:51] and it's really sad and it's a shame
[0:53] that they're attacking the the true word
[0:55] of god and their group has all these
[0:57] testimonies about how
[0:59] they've come out of the message and
[1:00] their lives are different but for us we
[1:02] understand if they've left the message
[1:04] which is the revelations of god then
[1:06] their lives
[1:07] cannot be perfectly in tune with the
[1:09] word of god so we feel burdened by the
[1:11] grace of god to share how
[1:14] our lives have been restored our lives
[1:16] have been transformed
[1:18] by the message because the message is
[1:20] the scriptures that god is fulfilling
[1:22] right now
[1:24] and we know the holy ghost is currently
[1:25] ministering to churches who preach the
[1:28] full revelation of god that believe that
[1:30] all the mysteries of god are finished
[1:33] and it's reproducing
[1:35] another book of acts church by the grace
[1:36] of god so we're going to start with the
[1:39] testimonies of brother amen and myself
[1:41] in this initial podcast and hopefully
[1:43] we'll be able to expand out to other
[1:45] saints in our church by the grace of god
[1:47] so brother amen and i are going to take
[1:48] turns asking each other questions
[1:51] and hopefully it's a blessing to you and
[1:52] hopefully you get a lot out of this
[1:53] podcast recording here
[1:55] and just so you know we're recording
[1:56] live at a sunday night church service so
[1:58] we have a very happy audience we have a
[2:01] very wonderful audience especially these
[2:03] young children smiling faces out there a
[2:05] lot of smiling adults so
[2:07] if you hear some noise in the background
[2:08] that's acceptable that's going to be
[2:09] normal and but it's something we're
[2:11] trying to do
[2:12] in order to save time and not have
[2:15] separate days to record we'd like to
[2:17] just record when we're all together by
[2:19] god's grace so hopefully there won't be
[2:20] much background noise and even if there
[2:22] is some noise i don't think it will
[2:23] bother you at all
[2:30] so our first question is what was your
[2:32] childhood like in relation to learning
[2:34] about jesus
[2:36] well i remember the first encounter i
[2:38] had with god was in fifth grade
[2:41] and this was when my dad started
[2:43] becoming a pastor of the church
[2:45] i think was assemblies of god church
[2:46] down in shibuya wisconsin
[2:49] and they were having their sunday school
[2:51] meeting and i was there and the first
[2:54] time i i felt god's presence was it was
[2:57] like a beautiful day and there was a
[2:59] song that was playing in the background
[3:01] it was at the cross by marathon singers
[3:04] and but i immediately felt the presence
[3:06] of god and i knew that that moment i
[3:08] wanted to serve him at that spot
[3:10] and that's when i started learning a
[3:12] little bit about god
[3:13] from my dad because he was a pastor
[3:16] and that's what that started my journey
[3:18] on being a christian learning to be like
[3:19] christian
[3:21] so how about you pastor jesse how was
[3:23] your childhood
[3:24] my first memories of god were my mom
[3:27] taking
[3:28] my brothers and i to church she would go
[3:31] all alone because my dad wouldn't go
[3:34] and i had all good interactions i
[3:35] remember in sunday school i remember the
[3:36] felt board and we would have we'd get to
[3:39] put pieces of
[3:40] felt and
[3:42] bible characters up on the felt board
[3:44] and i'd really kind sunday school
[3:45] teacher i can still remember her name
[3:47] ruth febak for some reason i can still
[3:49] remember her name she's very sweet to us
[3:51] i remember going in front of the church
[3:53] we of course went to assembly of god
[3:54] church and we would recite little rhymes
[3:57] about the bible every christmas and i
[4:00] can remember sunday school we'd sing
[4:02] songs i may never march in the infantry
[4:04] right in the calvary
[4:06] we had a lot of fun so those are my
[4:07] first memories
[4:10] i would say the most impactful one
[4:11] though was when i was in second grade
[4:13] and my mom had cancer my mom had liver
[4:16] cancer when i was in second grade and so
[4:17] i remember
[4:19] driving to the hospital with my grandma
[4:21] to visit her
[4:22] and
[4:24] seeing my mom lay there in the hospital
[4:26] bed and not knowing if she was going to
[4:27] come out the doctor said she had six
[4:29] months to live and i remember being very
[4:30] sad but then i remember my mom coming
[4:32] home and she was well i would learn
[4:35] later that there were two amazing things
[4:37] that happened that led to my mom's
[4:38] healing from liver cancer first there
[4:40] was another woman in my mom's church and
[4:42] she woke up one morning and the holy
[4:44] spirit spoke to her and gave her a
[4:46] scripture and the verse was psalm 118
[4:48] verse 17 i shall not die but live and
[4:51] declare the works of the lord so my
[4:53] mom's friend rushed to the hospital and
[4:56] told her that the holy spirit had given
[4:58] her this verse and that my mom was going
[5:00] to be well
[5:01] my mom received it right away because
[5:03] she had been praying over the last five
[5:04] or six years that god would give her a
[5:06] miracle she never asked god for any
[5:08] specific miracle she just said a miracle
[5:11] so my mom had faith in that promised
[5:12] word from her friend so my mom received
[5:14] that scripture right away and had faith
[5:16] in the promised word that she was going
[5:17] to be made well not long after that the
[5:20] doctors wanted to have some type of
[5:21] surgery to kind of look at the cancer
[5:23] and see if they could remove any on the
[5:24] night before her surgery my dad said he
[5:26] went into my mom's hospital room and
[5:29] laid his hand right on the location of
[5:30] the cancer
[5:32] and he said he rebuked that cancer in
[5:34] the name of jesus christ the next day my
[5:36] mom had surgery they opened her up and
[5:39] they could not find any liver cancer the
[5:41] cancer had completely vanished
[5:44] it was a bona fide miracle by the hand
[5:45] of jesus christ my mom still has the
[5:48] scar to this day from that surgery and
[5:50] also has that testimony from psalm 118
[5:53] verse 17.
[5:54] she's not died but she's lived and
[5:56] declared the works of the lord
[5:57] and my mom would take us to different
[5:59] churches in the toledo ohio area and
[6:01] testify about the healing power of god
[6:04] so i can say from a young age i had all
[6:06] positive experiences in church and then
[6:08] just a supernatural miracle i got to
[6:11] witness without when i was in second
[6:12] grade
[6:13] but amen anything else about your
[6:14] childhood did you remember
[6:16] yes uh middle school was we had this big
[6:20] gathering of churches so we had this big
[6:22] conference down in the semis of god
[6:25] church and i remember at the end of the
[6:27] service they're like oh who wants to
[6:29] accept jesus in their heart who wants to
[6:30] accept it and i i remember i went up i
[6:34] was the youngest one there because i was
[6:35] in middle school and i went up there i'm
[6:37] like yes i want to accept god and serve
[6:38] him from missing out so they took all of
[6:40] us those like maybe five or six people
[6:43] who went into this group and they're all
[6:45] giving us little packets and they're all
[6:47] talking to everyone oh
[6:49] god bless you guys i'm grateful you guys
[6:51] want to be christians and no one ever
[6:52] talked to me once
[6:54] and i'm like this is this christianity
[6:57] i'm like i was a kid so i didn't know
[6:59] any better but i'm like oh okay i guess
[7:02] i'm really young so no one wants to talk
[7:03] to me about following god
[7:05] but i still follow god from that point
[7:08] on regardless of the experience
[7:10] and that one stood with me the whole
[7:11] time
[7:12] hallelujah that's a beautiful testimony
[7:14] then brother can you share a little bit
[7:15] about how you had such a desire to go to
[7:17] church that sometimes you go by yourself
[7:20] yes so
[7:21] in high school
[7:23] so my dad used to be a pastor and they
[7:25] didn't like his preaching so
[7:27] they took him out of office and he
[7:30] stopped my whole family stopped going to
[7:31] church
[7:32] and i was the only one who wanted to go
[7:34] to church so my dad took me
[7:37] to
[7:38] a church it was a cma church and that's
[7:41] when i first started going to youth
[7:43] there and my dad only went and took me
[7:46] there once and after that he stopped
[7:48] taking me but that one time i went there
[7:50] i just felt like i was at home like this
[7:52] is where i belong here at church
[7:54] and from that point on i would go to
[7:56] church every single week
[7:59] in the rain in the snow i would walk a
[8:02] lot
[8:02] i probably lived maybe like
[8:05] three four miles away
[8:07] and
[8:08] i did a lot walking but i i just loved
[8:11] god so much that i wanted to go to
[8:13] church every single time and my dad
[8:15] would always yell at me he's like why
[8:17] are you guys why are you always going
[8:18] out so late why are you going hanging
[8:20] out with people and you're such a rebel
[8:22] and a kid but i'm like i just going to
[8:24] church to hang out with the youth and to
[8:27] hang out with my friends and
[8:29] that's not anything bad but my dad would
[8:31] always fight me for going for going to
[8:33] church
[8:34] but i assisted with it and
[8:37] from that point on you know my dad and i
[8:39] we didn't have a good relationship from
[8:41] that because he thought i was a bad kid
[8:43] but i was just going to church because i
[8:45] wanted to go to church
[8:47] that's an awesome testimony to see how
[8:49] you would walk through snow you know
[8:51] miles or we all hear about people who
[8:53] say i walk to school through
[8:55] numerous miles of snow just to get to
[8:57] school you know in the old days before
[8:59] they had snow plows and things but
[9:01] brother amen's just a real life example
[9:03] of someone that would walk through snow
[9:04] rain
[9:05] cold just to go to the house of god all
[9:08] by himself and so there we can see the
[9:10] love of god that was already in his
[9:12] heart from a child i think that's a
[9:14] beautiful testimony brother and that
[9:16] reminds me too when i was a child i had
[9:17] a heart for god so
[9:19] in third and fourth grade and fifth
[9:20] grade i started memorizing the scripture
[9:22] with my friend named eric
[9:24] and he took me to his word of life
[9:26] wednesday night
[9:28] bible club and i had a three ring binder
[9:30] i started memorizing the scriptures i
[9:32] wanted to really memorize but then
[9:34] something came into my life it was a
[9:36] cassette tape by amy grant
[9:39] she put out a secular album called heart
[9:41] in motion and i can still i can still
[9:44] picture the cover to this day now before
[9:46] this amy grant album she was actually
[9:48] singing for jesus she's saying thy word
[9:50] which is a beautiful song thy word is
[9:52] the lamp into my feet light into my path
[9:54] but that was the year she crossed over
[9:56] into secular songs
[9:58] and fifth grade was actually that was
[10:00] the time that i got that secular album
[10:02] from amy grant and that drove me away
[10:04] from god i stopped memorizing scripture
[10:07] i stopped want to go to church because
[10:08] now i was singing these love songs
[10:10] that's when i started to want
[10:11] girlfriends that was just the downfall
[10:13] of my life it was basically that secular
[10:15] music and i remember my mom warned me
[10:17] don't buy that don't buy that i don't
[10:19] want that in the house because she knew
[10:21] the evil effects
[10:22] but i was rebellious even as a fifth
[10:24] grader and that was the moment i left
[10:26] god and and i would later see how sinful
[10:28] music took me away from god but then god
[10:30] would use christian music later to bring
[10:32] me back to him
[10:39] so move to the second question the
[10:40] second question is when and why did you
[10:42] finally surrender to jesus and repent of
[10:45] your sins
[10:46] i think it's funny that my name is amen
[10:49] really funny because
[10:51] anything i hear from the word god i
[10:53] always automatically be like i believe
[10:54] it
[10:55] it was just in me when i was growing up
[10:58] so i never
[10:59] doubted god's word so it was just
[11:02] as soon as i heard the bible or i heard
[11:05] god
[11:06] i immediately just listened and just
[11:08] was drawn to it so
[11:10] i don't think there was an actual moment
[11:12] where i completely said i want to
[11:17] to follow god and like leave my life
[11:19] away from sin i think it was just kind
[11:21] of borne into me where
[11:23] i just heard about god and i just knew i
[11:25] just wanted to serve him from that point
[11:27] like what age would you estimate or what
[11:28] grade would you estimate where you
[11:30] really
[11:31] started growing or anything like that
[11:33] can you see like a certain moment where
[11:34] you like saw some growth
[11:36] okay so in in high school that's when i
[11:39] really started to grow
[11:41] in christ where i started going to
[11:43] i was taking choir and music and school
[11:46] and that's when i started using my gifts
[11:49] or my musical talent to i started
[11:52] playing music in church with their
[11:54] church band and that's when i started to
[11:56] grow in god with the knowledge and
[11:58] learning music
[12:00] and that's when my ministry just started
[12:02] learning how to play music and love god
[12:04] do that way
[12:05] awesome so god dealt with you heavily
[12:07] then in high school yes praise god
[12:10] okay so when when and why did you
[12:12] finally surrender jesus and repent
[12:15] so i surrendered and repented in it's
[12:17] either late 1999 december 99 or january
[12:20] 2000 i can never quite remember but that
[12:23] was my first year of college
[12:25] and again i'd been rebelling against god
[12:27] since fifth grade so for seven years
[12:30] i've been rebelling against god
[12:32] but when i was in college i was away
[12:34] from everyone i knew i moved from little
[12:35] liberty center ohio to akron ohio
[12:38] is a total culture shock to me
[12:41] because i was from a small farm town
[12:43] and i really had nobody i only knew the
[12:45] people on the football team
[12:47] in akron i knew no one else
[12:49] and so i was all by myself and so for
[12:50] that fall august september october
[12:53] november december
[12:55] i was of course still a sinner in
[12:57] college but on the weekends i would
[12:58] drive back home to see my girlfriend
[13:00] who's now my wife kristen
[13:02] and i would borrow my brother's car to
[13:05] go visit her and drive out to her house
[13:06] well cam had gotten saved that year so
[13:09] cam was the first one saved in our
[13:10] family which was a huge testimony and a
[13:12] wonderful blessing well in his car he
[13:14] had christian music and i would just let
[13:16] the christian music play
[13:17] and one of the songs came on called one
[13:19] of these days by ffh
[13:22] and it talked about seeing the hands
[13:24] that took the nails for me
[13:26] and having a mansion in heaven and as i
[13:28] just drove you know those
[13:30] couple miles out to kristen's house i
[13:31] would hear that and it was such a
[13:32] positive song it was it was a lot
[13:34] different than my rock and roll and my
[13:36] rap and metallica and snoop dogg that i
[13:38] was listening to it had such a those had
[13:40] such negative messages but when i heard
[13:42] this message of salvation and the cross
[13:46] and eternal life it really started
[13:48] softening my heart so
[13:50] in those months leading up to either
[13:52] december or january god used music to
[13:54] bring me
[13:56] back to him i was being drawn back to
[13:58] him at the same time during the weeks
[14:00] while at college
[14:01] the local pastor from the chapel mike
[14:03] arnold was meeting with me once every
[14:05] month or a couple times a month for
[14:07] breakfast and he'd talk about god also
[14:09] there was a couple guys on the football
[14:11] team at akron that were christians and
[14:12] they would try to be my friend to be my
[14:14] buddy so they started talking to me
[14:17] about god and then finally in december
[14:19] or january of 99 or 2000 they invited me
[14:23] to a athletes in action conference and i
[14:25] went
[14:26] and we were worshiping and i saw this
[14:30] large
[14:31] ohio state football player named tim
[14:33] anderson maybe he'll hear this and know
[14:35] how much i appreciate him but he was
[14:37] raising his hands worshiping and at that
[14:38] moment i felt so ashamed of myself god
[14:41] did he my mom of cancer god had brought
[14:43] me out of poverty
[14:45] giving me a full academic scholarship
[14:47] which was going to be worth a hundred
[14:48] thousand dollars or more
[14:50] and i felt so ashamed how can i not
[14:52] raise my hands
[14:54] to the god who's blessed me so much
[14:56] and so at that moment i started crying i
[14:58] started raising my hands i said if that
[14:59] guy can raise his hands what about me i
[15:02] can certainly do that and so i repented
[15:04] right there i accepted jesus christ as
[15:06] my savior as soon as the conference was
[15:08] over i remember that sunday night i got
[15:09] home i took down all my
[15:11] pictures on the wall i had pictures of
[15:13] immodestly dressed women i threw them in
[15:15] the trash
[15:16] i took all my cds of metallica and snoop
[15:19] dogg nirvana threw them in the trash and
[15:22] i opened my bible and that was the
[15:23] moment i repented and started following
[15:25] jesus christ
[15:31] so when did you first hear about the
[15:33] message and was your first
[15:35] first reaction to it i first heard about
[15:37] the message on thanksgiving night 2001.
[15:41] we're at a family gathering in wadsworth
[15:43] ohio and my brother simon was there and
[15:45] it was right after the 9 11 events
[15:47] and simon said you've got to sit down
[15:50] and hear this sermon it's a sermon about
[15:51] two seeds
[15:53] how god has two two seeds in the bible
[15:55] wheat and tears i'm like wow i never i'm
[15:57] like okay simon he kept asking me and
[16:00] asked me i'm like okay buddy we can do
[16:01] it you know we'll do it by god's grace
[16:04] and so that night it must have been
[16:05] around 10 or 11 o'clock on thanksgiving
[16:08] night we went up to my room in our
[16:09] college rental house
[16:11] and we listened to a two-hour sermon
[16:13] about two seeds and
[16:15] my eyes were just totally opened i never
[16:18] saw how god had
[16:20] two separate seeds a seed that was true
[16:22] to god's word but then as a false seed
[16:24] that would impersonate the true seed but
[16:27] ultimately be false and be rejected and
[16:30] so that was the first i heard about the
[16:32] message of the hour that god gave
[16:34] through his prophet brother branham and
[16:35] it was a very positive experience i mean
[16:37] i liked preaching before but now i love
[16:39] preaching that it just made preaching it
[16:41] took preaching to a whole another level
[16:43] because i never heard a man preach like
[16:44] that
[16:46] and so it was extremely positive
[16:47] experience life changing and then i
[16:49] started sharing with everybody i knew
[16:51] now i thought everybody was going to
[16:52] receive it i thought oh everybody can
[16:53] surely see these truths but found out
[16:56] the opposite most people turned it down
[16:58] which was understandable but to me
[17:00] it was a moment i'll never forget i just
[17:03] thought it was so fitting on
[17:04] thanksgiving night god brought me the
[17:06] message of the hour
[17:08] and before that i'd had so many
[17:10] questions i'd been a part of a penteco
[17:12] pentecostal church growing up and then i
[17:14] was part of a mega church presbyterian
[17:16] church and then i'd visited numerous
[17:17] baptist churches i'd visit all kinds of
[17:19] different churches but i never felt
[17:21] satisfied but once i heard that sermon i
[17:23] was satisfied i knew that's what i
[17:25] needed
[17:26] so brother amen when did you hear about
[17:27] the message and what kind of experience
[17:30] was it for you first summer the masses
[17:32] was 2014 and i was at the hmong church
[17:35] we were invited to go to pastor jesse's
[17:38] testimony meeting
[17:39] but i didn't go
[17:41] but i went after
[17:43] after they had their testimony meeting i
[17:45] went and showed up afterwards
[17:47] that's the first time i met pastor jesse
[17:48] and from the moment i met him i just
[17:51] knew
[17:52] that god was with him
[17:54] and that just instantly stuck with me
[17:57] the whole time
[17:58] so that time i was in the youth i was
[18:00] one of the leaders at the youth and i
[18:02] told my whole youth group i want to take
[18:05] our entire youth group to pastor jesse's
[18:07] church
[18:08] because the big theme they had was going
[18:10] out and like being with other churches
[18:12] i'm like okay let's take our entire
[18:14] youth group and go to pastor jesse's
[18:16] church so i got everything approved and
[18:17] we went to his church
[18:19] and pastor jesse preached my first
[18:21] sermon about
[18:22] the different types of denominations in
[18:24] the book of genesis
[18:26] and that's when i first heard the
[18:28] message and i was blown away by it and i
[18:31] went up for prayer i'm like
[18:32] this is something real that i always
[18:34] been praying for
[18:35] and i went and um went up there got
[18:38] prayed for and
[18:39] from that moment we went afterwards to
[18:41] burger king with the youth group and we
[18:43] were just talking about wow this is so
[18:45] different this is so
[18:47] refreshing
[18:48] and then we went back to our church and
[18:50] then we got yelled at big time by all
[18:53] the elders they're like pastor jesse's
[18:55] preaching a false
[18:57] doctrine and you guys shouldn't be going
[18:58] to this church because everything he
[19:00] preaches is false and it's of the devil
[19:02] and all that stuff but i'm like in my
[19:05] heart i'm like no this isn't right
[19:07] because i see love and holiness and god
[19:10] in this church
[19:12] so
[19:13] from that point on
[19:14] um this is when i first started being
[19:17] with my wife i met her a few years
[19:20] before him but this is the first time we
[19:22] actually interacted
[19:23] and i was telling her you know
[19:26] we're at a youth gathering and i was
[19:27] telling her and one of the places we're
[19:30] at i'm like pastor jesse
[19:32] has changed my life because he baptized
[19:35] me and i just feel so different from now
[19:37] and i was like yeah pastor jesse
[19:39] baptized me too
[19:41] and that's when mia will started talking
[19:43] a lot about the word and that's when she
[19:44] first shared um the serpent seed with me
[19:48] and
[19:49] at first i'm like okay it's i believe it
[19:51] yeah if i can find the bible i'll
[19:52] believe it you know
[19:54] and the first things he told me was you
[19:56] know since since we believe in this why
[19:58] don't we go to a wednesday night service
[20:00] and go to church today i'm like okay
[20:02] it'll be kind of like a little date
[20:04] we'll go together so we went to um
[20:07] pastor jesse's church on a wednesday
[20:08] night
[20:09] and this first sermon he preached to us
[20:11] was gideon about the barlow bread
[20:13] rolling down the hill and defeating the
[20:15] armies
[20:16] and that stuck with me forever
[20:18] and after that we started doing little
[20:20] bible studies from there on with pastor
[20:22] jesse and it just kind of went on there
[20:25] and then the turning point was a few
[20:28] months afterwards i decided to share
[20:31] a little bit of the message with my
[20:32] youth group and you know we have like
[20:34] little devotionals
[20:36] and
[20:37] they didn't receive it well and i got
[20:40] called out
[20:41] after by all the youth leaders and they
[20:44] were saying a lot of bad things about
[20:46] the church and you know they don't
[20:48] believe in water baptism the way we do
[20:51] and from that point i'm like okay you
[20:54] know you guys aren't sticking with the
[20:55] words so i'm not staying there any
[20:57] longer and from that point
[21:00] i told whoa who's my wife
[21:02] that i'm not staying in that church and
[21:04] i'm going to pastor jesse's church and
[21:06] we both decided to come and that's where
[21:08] we started coming to the message
[21:10] amen that reminds me of you know right
[21:12] before brother amen came to church
[21:15] in the summer of 2014 i had prayed and
[21:18] asked the lord i said lord
[21:20] i don't know if i should keep pastoring
[21:21] this church because the church was
[21:23] shrinking you know and getting smaller
[21:26] or if i should go out on the
[21:27] evangelistic field and just not be a
[21:29] pastor and just preach at other churches
[21:30] whenever i got invitations
[21:32] i just i said a simple prayer i emailed
[21:34] it to myself too and i said lord
[21:36] i said if you don't send me someone
[21:39] into our church
[21:41] that comes to faith in christ and
[21:44] believes our message
[21:46] by the end of the year
[21:48] i'm going to shut the church down and
[21:49] i'm just going to go into evangelism
[21:51] that was in the summer of 2014
[21:53] a couple months later probably around
[21:55] september or you know august or october
[21:58] of that same year that's when brother
[22:00] amen and sisterhood came in
[22:02] and i was just blown away you know they
[22:04] received the message right away
[22:06] it was beautiful and then in november of
[22:08] 2014 i specifically remember when
[22:11] brother amen came up to me and said i'm
[22:13] going to make
[22:14] your church
[22:15] my home church
[22:17] and i just sealed the deal right there
[22:18] and i knew that god i'd put a fleece
[22:21] before god like gideon i said lord if
[22:22] you want me to do this
[22:24] i really need you to give me this sign
[22:26] and so you know a month before two
[22:28] months before that deadline god gave me
[22:31] that sign and i've always told it
[22:32] everywhere i've gone you know god gave
[22:34] me an amen to the fact that i'm supposed
[22:36] to be a pastor
[22:37] uh because god gave me amen lee by god's
[22:40] grace so that's a beautiful testimony
[22:42] how it kind of ties in with my ministry
[22:44] as well how brother you're an answer to
[22:46] my prayer by god's grace yeah same here
[22:48] um i i was praying that year too about
[22:51] you know i was really tired of the way i
[22:54] was living with my church and how
[22:56] everything was so
[22:59] fake with christianity it doesn't seem
[23:01] real to me
[23:03] i knew god was real but every everybody
[23:05] who was living christianity professing
[23:07] it was really fake to me
[23:08] and that's when i prayed one time down
[23:10] on my knees first time i prayed on my
[23:12] knees i was asking god where's the god
[23:14] of jacob abraham and isaac why don't i
[23:17] see you god in the bible
[23:20] and where are you and that's when i
[23:21] first
[23:23] uh heard about this church and that's
[23:25] when i first met this one yeah i
[23:27] remember when you were baptized brother
[23:28] i still have the picture on my phone
[23:30] for your contact you had a t-shirt on
[23:32] and said there must be something real i
[23:34] just thought that spoke volumes
[23:37] that basically told about your life you
[23:39] know you were i mean you would walk
[23:41] through the snow brother in denomination
[23:43] just to go to church all by yourself
[23:46] all alone and so you were you were so
[23:48] hungry for god you just wanted a living
[23:50] god
[23:51] that when you found it
[23:53] god gave you the victory you came right
[23:54] into it and god gave you something real
[23:57] so i just oh that's always spoke volumes
[23:59] to me you know that you were hungering
[24:00] for god
[24:01] you were willing to do so much to try to
[24:04] get a hold of a living god but then god
[24:06] revealed himself
[24:08] and i'm sure was in the right time in
[24:09] right season
[24:16] okay can you say a story maybe multiple
[24:19] stories about the transformation of the
[24:21] message that how it transformed your
[24:23] life
[24:24] yeah uh before the message
[24:27] came to me in uh november 2001 i was in
[24:30] like a college type of campus ministry
[24:35] and there were very good people in there
[24:37] but i always knew there was something
[24:38] lacking
[24:39] and there were so many things that i
[24:41] knew was wrong going on in the church
[24:43] like for example they would only preach
[24:45] on four things all year they would never
[24:47] go into deep things of god and i
[24:48] hungered for more i knew that was wrong
[24:50] i knew there was a need for more word of
[24:52] god
[24:53] also there was really no power to
[24:55] overcome sin i saw that in the church
[24:58] i saw a lot of compromise i saw the
[25:00] leaders would preach something but then
[25:02] they would go purposely support
[25:05] sinful things like maybe filthy movies
[25:08] or filthy books
[25:10] or filthy sporting events i'll say it
[25:11] like that
[25:12] and i just saw a lot of hypocrisy in the
[25:15] church but i still love them i
[25:16] appreciated their grace to me but i just
[25:18] knew something was wrong
[25:20] and so
[25:21] when the message came to me i met a
[25:24] group of young brothers in the message
[25:26] like dave llewellyn craig booher freddy
[25:28] booer
[25:29] and i just i looked at these guys they
[25:30] were living such holy lives and i said
[25:32] either these guys are the biggest
[25:33] pretenders or they have the real holy
[25:35] ghost
[25:36] because i knew all these other guys
[25:37] their same age in college they said they
[25:40] were christians but they didn't live the
[25:41] life they didn't live a holy life
[25:43] like for example some of the guys in the
[25:45] college ministry would they would
[25:46] compete and see how many girls they
[25:48] could go hug
[25:50] in order to just squeeze up on their
[25:52] bodies
[25:53] i'm just trying to be as trying to be as
[25:55] gracious as i can be and yet these were
[25:57] the same guys that would lead bible
[25:58] studies
[25:59] and try to lead people to christ
[26:01] i knew that was wrong
[26:04] also in the churches you know the
[26:06] college campus they would they would
[26:07] have like a summer series called the
[26:10] church at the movies and they would play
[26:12] scenes from movies like sinful movies
[26:14] with cuss words and violence and sex
[26:17] scenes and they would talk about that
[26:19] well i knew that was wrong i could read
[26:20] the bible the bible says set no wicked
[26:22] thing before your eyes i i knew these
[26:24] things were wrong so when the message
[26:26] came it showed me the power of
[26:28] transformation
[26:30] power for holy living in a daily life
[26:33] and that's what i wanted i knew i wasn't
[26:35] living right and at that time when i was
[26:37] in those college ministries i was
[26:38] addicted to
[26:40] dirty magazines i was addicted to dirty
[26:42] pictures online
[26:44] i was addicted to cussing i was addicted
[26:46] to sports i was addicted to tobacco i
[26:47] was addicted to so many things
[26:49] all kinds of things and i knew i wasn't
[26:51] living the life the bible said i should
[26:53] live but as soon as i heard the message
[26:55] i started quoting acts 2 38 and i never
[26:57] cussed again
[26:59] and then as soon as i started listening
[27:00] to brother branham preach eventually i
[27:02] got victory over tobacco and the dirty
[27:04] pictures the dirty movie sports in other
[27:06] words i i found such power in the
[27:08] message of of god
[27:11] that it gave me power i'd never
[27:12] experienced before and that was proof
[27:14] that this message was right because it
[27:16] transformed my life
[27:18] brother amen what's the story you want
[27:19] to share about the transformation the
[27:21] message has made in your life
[27:23] i just hear
[27:24] one um
[27:26] when i first started going to the
[27:27] message
[27:28] it was life-changing to me
[27:31] but and me and while we were dating at
[27:33] the time and there were times where i
[27:36] would say a lot of things
[27:38] that were a bit mean and rude to her but
[27:40] i didn't know any better at that time
[27:43] and i found out by the grace of god that
[27:45] he's been showing me how to be a better
[27:47] person or how to be nicer with my words
[27:50] not how to not to be so much sarcastic
[27:54] and learn how to
[27:55] be more understanding towards one
[27:57] another and that's when god really
[27:59] started changing me and there are times
[28:01] when meanwhile we would get into a few
[28:04] arguments
[28:05] and i wouldn't know that there would be
[28:07] things inside of me
[28:09] that came out you know i wouldn't know
[28:11] these things unless it happened in that
[28:13] situation
[28:15] and god's been dealing god had deal with
[28:17] me with those issues you know i
[28:20] shouldn't be so
[28:21] angry at times or having a lot of
[28:24] temper tantrums
[28:26] in that situation or in multiple
[28:28] situations and
[28:30] god's been really helping me overcome
[28:32] you know being really angry at times
[28:35] thanks to them thanks to the message i
[28:37] that really transformed my life around
[28:39] where i can now talk to my wife and be
[28:41] more really respectful to her without
[28:44] hurting her feelings anyway
[28:46] and the other thing i'm pretty sure a
[28:48] lot of people are dealing with is with
[28:50] video games i used to be extremely
[28:52] extremely addicted to video games so
[28:54] what happened when i came to the message
[28:57] was i had
[28:58] a lot of game systems like
[29:01] playstation 4 xbox nintendo all that
[29:04] stuff and there was this time where
[29:06] pastor jesse was preaching about
[29:08] not having a tv in our house
[29:11] and i just felt burdened a month later
[29:14] we got rid of our tv
[29:16] and that felt like a great victory and a
[29:18] few months later
[29:20] meanwhile we're talking like oh let's
[29:22] you know let's get a tv we missed our tv
[29:24] so we go out and buy it again
[29:26] and then pastor jesse comes and preaches
[29:28] a similar message about getting a t
[29:30] creating a game rating of your tv
[29:32] because it's not good for you and me and
[29:34] who were like okay let's give it away so
[29:36] we gave it to uh
[29:38] one of her sisters and we gave away that
[29:40] tv
[29:41] and then the whole year goes by and we
[29:43] both wanted a tv again so we bought it
[29:46] three times
[29:47] about three tvs three times and pastor
[29:49] jesse came up
[29:51] and he preached another sermon about
[29:53] having tvs again
[29:54] and we're like okay i we give up i give
[29:57] up i can't do this anymore god you win
[30:00] well we got rid of our tv
[30:03] and that's the same thing that happened
[30:04] with my video games i was playing a lot
[30:05] of video games at the time too and got
[30:08] rid of the tv so you don't have a tv you
[30:10] can't play video games at the same time
[30:11] man god damn me with that so i sold my
[30:13] games and then i bought a new system and
[30:17] went and played that for a little while
[30:18] and then i sold it again because i
[30:20] feeling the conviction of god telling me
[30:22] to get rid of these things and i did
[30:24] that exactly three times
[30:26] again with the same thing with the tv i
[30:28] bought three different video game
[30:29] systems three times and i finally got
[30:31] rid of my last one
[30:33] the last one before i got the holy ghost
[30:35] and um
[30:37] god was really doing me my video game
[30:39] addiction and i think the grace by god
[30:42] that i am no longer play video games
[30:44] hallelujah i didn't know that so that's
[30:45] that's a new story to me brother so i
[30:47] never knew about the tv so it just must
[30:49] have been the unction of the holy spirit
[30:51] the inspiration of god praise god
[30:53] you know another story for me like you
[30:54] said earlier about love in your
[30:55] relationships that's been huge for me
[30:58] you know through the message that god
[31:00] gave brother branham it's pointed us
[31:01] back to the bible
[31:02] and the bible talks about how a husband
[31:04] must love his wife as christ loved the
[31:06] church
[31:08] and i would hear that denomination but i
[31:10] wouldn't understand it well then i would
[31:11] listen to brother branham and he would
[31:13] talk about how you actually do that he
[31:15] said you got to sit down with your wife
[31:16] you have to listen to your wife you have
[31:18] to show her respect she's not a doormat
[31:21] she should always be your sweetheart he
[31:23] said you should always be on a honeymoon
[31:25] with your wife
[31:26] and you know my wife and i before we got
[31:28] married you know
[31:29] during our childhood both of our parents
[31:31] were divorced and so we came from broken
[31:33] homes
[31:34] and even before i came in the message
[31:37] even as a christian i said the one thing
[31:38] i want is a happy marriage that's all i
[31:40] want i just want a happy home because i
[31:42] didn't have a happy home growing up mom
[31:44] and dad fought a lot and they fought
[31:45] over late religion of all things
[31:48] um that was the main thing they they
[31:50] fought about
[31:51] but then after the message came in 2001
[31:54] and 2002
[31:56] people would give us quote books and one
[31:58] of the quote books was about marriage
[31:59] and family so i got to read all these
[32:01] quotes from brother branham and it would
[32:02] always point me back to the bible and
[32:04] i'd have all these scriptures on a
[32:06] husband must love his wife and how
[32:08] brother branham loved his wife
[32:10] and now you know it's created such a
[32:12] wonderful atmosphere in our home it's
[32:15] all attributed to the love of god and a
[32:18] couple examples are we've had family
[32:19] members come and visit us and in
[32:21] particular one family member came and
[32:23] spent the weekend with us and when they
[32:25] were leaving they cried and then they
[32:28] called me up when they got home after
[32:30] three hour drive and said i'm still
[32:31] crying because i had never seen such
[32:33] love in a family before
[32:35] and then we had another family member
[32:36] who visited visits us quite often
[32:39] and she will just bring it up on her own
[32:40] and she'll say wow i've been to lots of
[32:43] places i've been around a lot of
[32:44] families
[32:45] but you have a special family something
[32:47] is special about your family something's
[32:49] different
[32:50] our kids work with a volunteer
[32:52] non-profit organization and the leaders
[32:54] of that organization
[32:56] will come up and say how do you guys do
[32:58] it how do you make children like this
[33:00] and we always say it's just by god's
[33:02] grace now i joke around and say well
[33:04] they got to listen to their dad scream
[33:05] and preach three times a week
[33:07] that's that's probably hard for them no
[33:10] that's probably part of it but they get
[33:11] to hear a lot of preaching but also
[33:13] their mother's at home and their mother
[33:15] is constantly talking with them
[33:17] correcting them teaching them about
[33:19] god's word and if you live what you
[33:22] preach
[33:23] if you practice what you preach it will
[33:26] produce the results of the bible it'll
[33:28] produce children that love jesus christ
[33:30] and because of that by god's grace i
[33:32] baptize six out of my eight children
[33:34] another transformation the message has
[33:36] brought is within literal church
[33:38] services when i would go to the
[33:39] pentecostal church sometimes there was
[33:41] power but it was mostly emotion was
[33:42] speaking in tongues
[33:44] and there would be tongues and
[33:45] interpretations when i was growing up
[33:46] but nothing real specific
[33:48] and yeah we had a couple healings some
[33:50] were powerful like my mother's healing
[33:51] from cancer that was tremendous
[33:53] but when i come in the message i saw
[33:55] things above and beyond that you know
[33:57] we've seen cancers heal we've seen
[33:59] seizures healed
[34:01] i've seen arthritis healed
[34:03] i've seen a kidney stone healed
[34:05] instantaneously so by the miraculous
[34:07] power of god
[34:08] numerous times people have received
[34:11] children that couldn't have children
[34:13] we've had numerous people in the
[34:14] hospital come all the way back from
[34:16] being on a ventilator like one of the
[34:18] brothers in the church his dad had had a
[34:20] heart attack but we prayed
[34:22] uh the brother laid a prayer cloth on
[34:24] him the doctor gave him less than a one
[34:27] percent chance to live but he's alive
[34:29] today by the grace of god the
[34:30] supernatural power of god my brother
[34:32] simon has prayed for people that were
[34:34] close to death and they come back
[34:36] to life in full health and complete
[34:38] victory in the name of jesus christ and
[34:41] then also we've seen power to cast out
[34:43] devils deliver people from addictions
[34:45] and i just didn't see that in
[34:47] denominations now that doesn't mean
[34:48] they're not denominations but when i
[34:50] come in the message and we saw the word
[34:52] of god preach we saw the same things
[34:54] that they saw in the bible that reminds
[34:56] me one time a woman came up and was
[34:57] bleeding i didn't know it she just said
[34:59] pray for me i prayed for her
[35:01] it was actually in this church around
[35:03] 2015
[35:04] and instantly the bleeding dried up
[35:06] inside of her body and then her and her
[35:08] husband called me the next day just
[35:09] rejoicing that jesus christ was the same
[35:11] yesterday today and forever he healed
[35:13] the woman's blood issue of 18 years in
[35:15] the bible and here was in 2015 jesus
[35:18] christ is still the same he still dries
[35:20] up blood issues by his grace and his
[35:21] mercy and that's my god something that
[35:24] yeah so i noticed when i was in the cma
[35:26] church there was no supernatural never
[35:28] any supernatural and they denied a lot
[35:31] of miracles but then when i first came
[35:32] to this message i started seeing the
[35:35] power of god and the muslim i will i
[35:37] would feel his presence a lot and just
[35:39] going to this church and i knew that god
[35:41] was real because i could just
[35:43] feel them i can see him and the people
[35:45] around me
[35:46] and with the the saints and
[35:49] the powerful testimonies and actually
[35:51] witness and see many things coming past
[35:54] like many healings this first time i
[35:56] actually seen someone speak in tongues
[35:58] and like answer prayers that god
[36:00] instantly
[36:02] you know gives it to you
[36:03] compared to being a denomination i've
[36:05] never seen any of that so by coming here
[36:07] you just see the power of god move
[36:09] so much more like god just blesses you
[36:12] so much more when you're walking with
[36:14] him
[36:14] at one time i was sick with what i think
[36:17] was strep throat for like seven or eight
[36:19] or nine days and i still came to church
[36:21] during the service i wasn't preaching
[36:22] thank god but we had a guest preacher
[36:24] from india and i couldn't even sing
[36:26] during the song service my throat hurt
[36:28] so bad i probably should not have been a
[36:29] church i was probably contagious but
[36:30] anyways i just i couldn't miss church i
[36:32] loved church so much
[36:33] but anyways i went up for prayer at the
[36:34] service he just prayed for me anointed
[36:36] me with oil i went back to my seat
[36:38] actually i was running the computer in
[36:40] the back and then as we were singing the
[36:41] last song i started singing and my voice
[36:44] was completely well after over a week of
[36:46] having no voice and
[36:48] a painful throat i was instantly healed
[36:51] right there in the in the service and i
[36:52] just shouted and praised god
[36:54] and so i've even experienced it in
[36:56] myself
[36:57] in my own life personally and i'll never
[36:59] forget this one on a wednesday night a
[37:01] few months ago
[37:02] one of the new sisters in our church
[37:03] sister lena her mom was missing her mom
[37:06] had gotten sick with an addiction and
[37:09] was missing well we didn't know what to
[37:11] do our hearts were all tore up because
[37:12] of that
[37:13] and so we just come up for prayer and i
[37:15] said let's just join hands and let's
[37:16] pray that they'll find lena's mother
[37:20] and we just prayed sincerely and i just
[37:21] love how god can move on wednesday night
[37:23] just like he can move on a sunday
[37:24] morning or a sunday night god's always
[37:26] moving whenever people have faith and we
[37:28] started praying and the prayer just kept
[37:30] getting more and more serious more and
[37:32] more sincere and then all of a sudden
[37:34] when the sister started shouting out
[37:35] jesus jesus jesus and we just felt the
[37:38] presence of god just like it fell right
[37:39] on us
[37:40] we were all weeping and crying and
[37:42] praising the lord and we were worshiping
[37:44] god and then all of a sudden a brother
[37:46] who was praying with us said get out
[37:47] satan get out satan get out satan and we
[37:50] just me i mean i remember my hands hurt
[37:52] afterwards because we were grabbing
[37:53] hands and holdings holding so hard you
[37:55] know just believing god's word at that
[37:58] moment
[37:59] and i think the next day if i'm not
[38:00] mistaken uh the sister got word back
[38:03] that they had found her mother she
[38:05] wasn't dead she was alive and that was
[38:07] that was just a reason to rejoice the
[38:10] fact that she was still alive because of
[38:11] her her health condition
[38:13] and then a week later i was able
[38:16] to talk with some of the mother's
[38:18] friends and relay some things and the
[38:21] mother repented
[38:22] of the evil that she did
[38:24] so it's like during the prayer we were
[38:27] shouting out to jesus jesus spirit comes
[38:29] down to vindicate that he was going to
[38:30] answer the prayer and then the brother
[38:32] was shouting get out satan get out and
[38:34] that was we believe that was the enemy
[38:37] being pushed out where the beforehand
[38:39] the mother couldn't repent but now she
[38:40] could repent because satan was cast out
[38:43] so that's just another example of the
[38:45] power of god just god heard our prayers
[38:47] the spirit came down right in the
[38:48] congregation
[38:49] and then god answered the request
[38:57] can you tell us why the message means so
[38:59] much to you so just as a summary the
[39:01] message has been the full revelation of
[39:03] jesus christ so i felt like in
[39:04] denominations i had a partial revelation
[39:06] of jesus christ but now i feel like i
[39:08] have a full revelation of jesus christ
[39:10] and that's scriptural because in acts 17
[39:12] 11 the bible said elias shall come and
[39:14] restore all things
[39:16] so before jesus returns he has to
[39:18] restore his word back and jesus is the
[39:21] word
[39:22] so i feel like we have a full
[39:24] understanding of jesus christ also
[39:26] revelation 10 7 says the mystery of god
[39:28] would be finished
[39:30] and so
[39:31] the bible defined mysteries about god
[39:33] they're finished so we can understand
[39:34] the bible
[39:36] as jesus told his disciples these the
[39:38] mysteries are given to you
[39:40] and then the bible says in deuteronomy
[39:41] 29 29 the mysteries of god are yours and
[39:44] your children's that you may do all the
[39:46] word of god
[39:47] so the message means so much to me
[39:49] because now i see jesus christ
[39:51] in his true character and now the bible
[39:54] has become a new bible and i see the
[39:56] living jesus christ not in a man-made
[39:58] denomination that adds to the bible or
[40:00] takes away from the bible but in a true
[40:02] book of acts experience i experienced
[40:05] jesus christ the way they did in the
[40:06] book of acts
[40:07] brother amen what advice would you give
[40:09] people with questions about the message
[40:11] of the hour
[40:12] i would firstly say pray about it to see
[40:15] if you really want the truth or not and
[40:17] god would certainly lead you first and
[40:20] second of all i think the most important
[40:22] thing is don't believe everything you
[40:24] hear that you should take everything
[40:25] back to the word of god
[40:27] because there's a lot of teachers that
[40:29] are very intellectual and they sound
[40:31] very
[40:32] good and sound and doctrine
[40:34] and they can lead you astray and when i
[40:37] was in the message i heard a lot of
[40:38] different
[40:40] stories from other people who were not
[40:41] in the message
[40:43] like some prophecies or teachings they
[40:45] had that didn't line up with the word of
[40:47] god and i was led astray for that for a
[40:50] season
[40:51] but it wasn't in the word of god and i
[40:53] always had to take everything back to
[40:54] where god take it back to your pastor
[40:57] and
[40:58] go from there and
[41:00] so i would advise
[41:01] people who want to know the truth well
[41:04] if they really want to know the truth
[41:05] then they should be able to
[41:07] kind of do your own homework and take
[41:10] everything back to the word of god and
[41:12] with this message you're able to take
[41:14] everything back to the word of god and
[41:15] that's why i believe it so much because
[41:17] it's all biblical it's all in the bible
[41:19] you can prove everything in the message
[41:21] that's been being preached
[41:23] and that's what gives us power to
[41:25] overcome this world
[41:27] any advice you want to get past your
[41:28] jesse
[41:29] yeah for people that are either
[41:31] optimistic or pessimistic about the
[41:32] message if you're optimistic about the
[41:34] message then the best advice i can give
[41:36] you is listen to brother branham and
[41:37] then have your bible right next to it
[41:39] because just like acts 17 11 says the
[41:42] men in berea were more noble than those
[41:44] in thessalonica because they searched
[41:46] the scriptures daily whether these
[41:47] things were so so that's what i did in
[41:49] my life i would listen to brother
[41:50] branham and then have my bible open and
[41:52] i would have the scriptures there to
[41:55] vindicate what brother branham said now
[41:57] of course for our listeners brother
[41:58] branham was not perfect brother bran was
[42:00] not god he was not infallible
[42:02] not every thought of his was right
[42:05] but the majority of his preaching was
[42:07] right and he did grow in revelation as
[42:09] he matured god showed him more and more
[42:11] of the revelation of the mystery of god
[42:15] so for people that are optimistic keep
[42:17] listening to the tapes
[42:19] and if you're optimistic i'd also say
[42:20] stay away from the jeffersonville
[42:22] movement because they worship brother
[42:24] branham they worship brother rams tape
[42:26] so stay away from that camp
[42:28] and also stay away from the camp that
[42:30] attacks brother branham
[42:32] but i would encourage you if you have
[42:33] questions reach out to us brother amen
[42:34] and i can take your questions
[42:36] or reach out to a trusted minister who
[42:38] has really studied brother brown's
[42:39] message and knows about a lot of brother
[42:41] ram's life and can be honest with you
[42:44] and share the real quotes from brother
[42:45] branham but also show how brother
[42:47] branham may have had human weaknesses
[42:49] but then also all the victories god gave
[42:52] him because brother man was different
[42:54] than everybody else because he spoke
[42:55] with thus saith the lord and in my 2021
[42:58] book i have over 30 examples of thus
[43:00] saith the lord's that have come to pass
[43:02] regarding prophecy but also regarding
[43:05] people's healings
[43:06] and bible doctrines and mysteries of god
[43:09] that are now finished so we have so much
[43:10] proof that this message is right so i
[43:12] encourage anyone who's optimistic to do
[43:15] those things
[43:17] so what is the most important thing you
[43:19] want listeners to know about jesus and
[43:21] the message
[43:23] probably hebrews 13 8 that jesus christ
[43:25] did the same yesterday today and forever
[43:27] that if you really love jesus christ and
[43:29] you read about him in the bible you can
[43:31] know that he's the same in every detail
[43:34] except there's no corporal body here
[43:35] today so as jesus acted in the gospels
[43:39] that's what the holy spirit acts like
[43:41] today in the lives of real people who
[43:43] are filled with his holy ghost
[43:45] that's the most important lesson i've
[43:46] learned that jesus christ is the same
[43:48] yesterday today and forever the bible
[43:50] says prove all things so everything
[43:52] that's true can be proven right by the
[43:54] bible every question we have can be
[43:56] proven by the word of god and the bible
[43:58] is our absolute brother branham was not
[44:00] our absolute he was pointing to the
[44:02] absolute which is jesus christ and his
[44:05] word
[44:06] so brother as we close here what's the
[44:07] most important lesson you've learned
[44:09] from the message that you'd like to pass
[44:10] on i think the one that hits me the most
[44:13] is
[44:14] when god tells you that there are four
[44:16] kinds of people on earth
[44:18] and there are two different types of
[44:19] christians
[44:20] and that's where it gets
[44:22] people get really confused that all
[44:24] christian all christians are lumped into
[44:25] one group which is not true because the
[44:28] catholics they don't represent all
[44:29] christianity or protestants they don't
[44:30] represent all christianities
[44:33] so i
[44:34] through this i learned about wise
[44:36] virgins and foolish virgins two types of
[44:38] christians and i'm thanking god that god
[44:41] chose us to receive all of this word to
[44:43] really understand that there's
[44:45] christians everywhere even in
[44:47] denominations
[44:48] but not everyone who says like they're a
[44:50] christian as a christian
[44:52] so i'm thankful that god's able to help
[44:54] us discern those things
[44:56] and that's just like what brother
[44:56] branham said we got to have the holy
[44:58] ghost to discern the two spirits in the
[45:00] framework of the church so that we can
[45:02] stay with the holy spirit and overcome
[45:04] the antichrist spirit
[45:11] we want to thank you for listening to
[45:12] this podcast we hope it was a blessing
[45:13] and we hope you like this direction
[45:14] we're going we like to give some
[45:17] testimonies of some of the saints in our
[45:18] church that helped defend the message
[45:21] showing that the power of jesus christ
[45:22] is the same yesterday today and forever
[45:24] transforming lives and that the book of
[45:26] acts is still going on and it's active
[45:29] and our lives are part of that book of
[45:31] acts by the grace of god through the
[45:33] constant moving of the holy ghost in our
[45:35] lives if you have any questions for us
[45:37] you can always feel free to reach out
[45:38] and email me at jesse.smith11
[45:41] sbcglobal.net or you can text me at
[45:44] 330-929
[45:46] we want to say god bless you and may
[45:48] jesus christ anoint you to defend the
[45:50] message of the hour as paul also said in
[45:53] philippians 1 verse 17
[45:55] he said knowing that i am set for the
[45:56] defense of the gospel
[45:58] [Music]
[46:42] you
