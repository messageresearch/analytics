[0:00] [Music]
[0:02] happy to see today is our first Pastor
[0:06] brother James Jones from Indianapolis
[0:08] back there
[0:09] [Music]
[0:22] greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:25] of the Lord Jesus Christ this is part
[0:28] two in a series proving that Jim Jones
[0:30] did not believe the bible-based message
[0:33] that God gave to his Prophet brother
[0:36] William Branham I'll begin with a
[0:39] disclaimer about the sensitive nature of
[0:41] this episode please do not allow
[0:43] children to listen to this episode as I
[0:45] have to cover some of the incredibly
[0:47] Wicked sins committed by Jim Jones but
[0:51] of course I'll just give a general
[0:52] overview of them and not include details
[0:55] and I'll also share some audio of Jim
[0:57] Jones himself
[0:59] as a review here's the outline of this
[1:01] series in part one we looked at the
[1:03] first three sections of this series
[1:05] first we looked at the accusation and
[1:07] character of brother Ram's accusers
[1:10] second we looked at the one brother
[1:12] random quote about Jim Jones and their
[1:15] Association and the third section was
[1:17] brother branham's nine warnings to
[1:20] Pastor Jim Jones and his associate
[1:22] pastors from October 1956.
[1:26] in this video we'll cover sections four
[1:28] and five section 4 is historical facts
[1:31] about Jim Jones and section 5 is a
[1:34] summary where we'll contrast the
[1:37] difference between Jim Jones and brother
[1:39] Branham and listen to audio from Jim
[1:41] Jones
[1:43] but before beginning section 4 I want to
[1:46] share two things that I believe will
[1:47] help the viewers understand that brother
[1:50] Branham had nothing to do with Jim Jones
[1:52] gross wickedness
[1:54] first I want to play audio from Jim
[1:56] Jones himself proving Jim Jones was an
[2:00] enemy of brother Branham as I mentioned
[2:03] in part one of this video series it's
[2:05] clear Jim Jones was against brother
[2:07] Branham
[2:08] in this audio you're about to hear
[2:10] you'll hear Jim Jones say he prophesied
[2:12] of brother random's death and said
[2:14] brother Branham would lose his head in
[2:16] Texas and also said that brother Branham
[2:19] told Jim Jones that Jim Jones could not
[2:22] preach the truth of the Bible of course
[2:25] these are lies from Jim Jones
[2:27] and the proof of that is that brother
[2:29] Branham did not lose his head in the car
[2:31] accident that led to his death in Texas
[2:34] in December of 1965.
[2:37] this proves Jim Jones was a false
[2:40] prophet and later we'll see how he
[2:42] falsely prophesied of a nuclear attack
[2:44] on Indianapolis in 1967 and of course
[2:48] that failed and a second proof from this
[2:51] audio is that brother random spent his
[2:52] entire life preaching the truth of the
[2:55] Bible and was unafraid and unashamed to
[2:58] preach the truth of the Bible the Gospel
[3:01] of Jesus Christ
[3:03] many times brother Brennan would preach
[3:04] one two three four or more hours on one
[3:08] sermon and from my personal experience
[3:10] no Bible teacher I've listened to has
[3:13] taught me more about the Bible than
[3:15] brother Branham let's listen to the
[3:17] audio from Jim Jones
[3:19] they won't tell you the truth
[3:22] because the black book is the easiest
[3:26] gravy trained
[3:28] that they've ever been on yes Alan came
[3:31] to me
[3:32] all Robert spoke this Billy Graham came
[3:35] right to us arms Jack and me and play
[3:38] through Hotel said I don't believe a
[3:40] thing in that Bible hardly
[3:42] right but he said it's the way to make a
[3:45] living
[3:46] Billy Graham who I prophesied his death
[3:49] Billy Branham rather
[3:51] said his head would be I said you lose
[3:53] his head his head was cut off in Texas
[3:57] he said you can't preach the truth about
[3:58] that Bible
[4:00] he said
[4:02] preach reincarnation you cannot preach
[4:04] the truth about the Bible you will be in
[4:07] trouble I said I choose to treat you
[4:09] preach the truth he said well I'll be
[4:11] around while you will be in trouble
[4:14] well I'm still here and his head is cut
[4:16] off of his body
[4:18] [Music]
[4:27] now friends this audio proves Jim Jones
[4:29] was an enemy of brother Branham from his
[4:32] own words and Jim Jones and brother bran
[4:34] were not in fellowship and remember
[4:36] there's only one brother random quote
[4:38] about Jim Jones and then that sermon
[4:40] showed that brother random knew little
[4:43] to nothing about Jim Jones because
[4:45] brother Ram said he didn't know whether
[4:46] the pastor would appreciate brother
[4:48] random preaching about women wearing
[4:50] modest clothing and women not cutting
[4:52] their hair and Friends remember brother
[4:54] random spent the last seven years of his
[4:56] life from 1958 to 1965 never having any
[5:00] fellowship with Jim Jones not mentioning
[5:02] him not giving him any support proving
[5:04] again brother Branham Is Not Guilty by
[5:07] association with Jim Jones
[5:09] and the second thing I want to share is
[5:11] an example of weak research from Brother
[5:14] Graham's accusers and one accuser in
[5:17] particular
[5:18] one of brother Ram's accusers apparently
[5:20] wrote a book about brother Branham and
[5:22] Jim Jones and on one of his videos he
[5:24] shows an introduction page it seems from
[5:27] this book and uses a quote from Brother
[5:29] Branham from 1956 from the sermon that
[5:33] Jim Jones was mentioned by Brother
[5:35] Branham and in this quote from Brother
[5:37] Branham it's at the close of the service
[5:39] and brother Brown said the spirit of God
[5:41] would be poured out and that it might
[5:43] fill people with the Holy Ghost or it
[5:45] might send forth a Ministry
[5:47] brother Adam's accuser tries to use this
[5:50] quote to say brother Brandon was sending
[5:52] forth Jim Jones's Wicked Ministry and of
[5:55] course this is an assumption it's a lie
[5:57] it's a misinterpretation of brother
[5:59] Ram's quote notice brother random's
[6:01] Accuser failed to read on or fail to
[6:04] continue listening to brother branham's
[6:06] quote because just a few short
[6:08] paragraphs after brother Ram said this
[6:10] brother and recognized what the pouring
[6:13] out of the Holy Spirit was and it was
[6:15] not to send forth Jim Jones's Ministry
[6:17] it was for healing forgiveness and the
[6:21] baptism of the Holy Ghost to all those
[6:22] who believed in the congregation this
[6:25] mistake of failing to read on or failing
[6:27] to listen on is a very common mistake of
[6:30] brother Ram's accusers just like I
[6:33] showed in the series on the Seven Seals
[6:35] where there were over 38 differences
[6:37] between brother Branham and Clarence
[6:38] Larkin and Charles Taze Russell and
[6:41] Uriah Smith on the Seven Seals and in
[6:43] most of those cases brother Ram's
[6:45] accusers just had to continue reading
[6:46] and the differences between brother
[6:48] Branham and those three men were just
[6:50] one paragraph or sometimes just one
[6:52] sentence away but that of course proves
[6:54] brother Ram's accusers research is
[6:57] biased on purpose so here's a picture of
[7:00] brother Ram's accusers book from his own
[7:03] video here's the cover of the book and
[7:06] apparently this is the introduction page
[7:08] or some page in the beginning of the
[7:11] accuser's book and the quote he uses
[7:14] from Brother Branham says quote I
[7:15] believe that God's going to pour out
[7:17] here in a few moments something I don't
[7:20] whether it's going to be a spontaneous
[7:23] healings whether it's going to be a
[7:25] filling with the Holy Ghost whether it's
[7:27] going to be a sending forth of a
[7:29] Ministry I don't know but something's
[7:31] fixing to happen remember I told you I
[7:33] never felt this right in the prayer line
[7:36] ask anybody here's men that's been with
[7:39] me since I was early in the ministry
[7:41] you've never seen that it picked up and
[7:44] I feel strong enough look like till run
[7:47] a mile C run through a troop and leap
[7:49] over wall I never felt that way never
[7:52] come back like that something started
[7:54] something's happening end quote
[7:57] so notice it's clear brother Branham
[7:59] said I don't know what the outpouring of
[8:01] the spirit is going to be and yet
[8:03] brother Ram's accuser says the
[8:04] outpouring was brother random sending
[8:07] forth Jim Jones's Ministry and of course
[8:09] that's a lie shortly after this quote
[8:11] from Brother Branham you hear Brother
[8:13] random singing the song there's a
[8:15] fountain filled with blood drawn from
[8:17] Emmanuel's veins and then in paragraph
[8:19] 86 brother Branham sees the pouring
[8:23] forth of the Holy Spirit and he says
[8:25] quote here it is why it's all over the
[8:27] building everywhere end quote so let's
[8:30] listen to both quotes the quote where
[8:32] brother random says he doesn't know what
[8:33] the pouring out is going to be and then
[8:35] we'll hear the quote where he knows what
[8:36] the pouring out is the pouring out is
[8:39] for healing and for Sinners to be
[8:41] forgiven and the Holy Spirit going to
[8:44] baptize this place illuminate it and
[8:46] then brother random condemns the devil
[8:48] in the name of Jesus Christ let's listen
[8:50] to the quotes
[9:01] fourth of a Ministry I don't know but
[9:04] something's fixing to happen remember I
[9:06] told you
[9:08] and to report this right in the prayer
[9:10] line ask anybody yours man's been with
[9:12] me since I was early in the ministry
[9:14] you've never seen that it picked up and
[9:16] I'll feel strong enough look like though
[9:18] just run a mile and see where they run
[9:21] through a troop Leaf over a wall I never
[9:23] felt that way never come back like that
[9:25] something started something's happening
[9:27] and I see the vision of people swarming
[9:30] down the aisle
[9:31] with her hands up and here they are just
[9:33] exactly where it was showing division
[9:37] one more time to sing before we go to
[9:40] prayer
[9:43] [Music]
[9:48] won't you come to the power I'll raise
[9:50] my hand to you won't you come up here
[9:52] Jordan let me join with you in prayer if
[9:55] God will hear my prayer for the blood
[9:58] and the wickedness
[10:09] all right
[10:10] [Applause]
[10:14] I want to ask you something do you feel
[10:17] strange I I'm not going by feelings but
[10:20] I'm going with that vision and
[10:22] Something's Happened Here
[10:25] do you believe that if there's anybody
[10:27] crippled or flicked I'll be your healed
[10:30] something I'm happy to ever Sinners
[10:33] forgiven I believe the Holy Spirits go
[10:36] to baptize this place illuminated
[10:39] are you ready people
[10:42] are you ready to receive it look at the
[10:45] people standing up this automatically
[10:48] there it is
[10:50] [Music]
[10:56] [Music]
[11:04] so this example again shows the
[11:07] cognitive dissonance of brother Ram's
[11:09] accusers rather than recognizing the
[11:12] truth about this particular quote and
[11:14] the pouring out of the spirit being
[11:16] Divine Healing forgiveness for Sinners
[11:18] and the baptism of the Holy Ghost for
[11:21] those who wanted the baptism of the Holy
[11:22] Ghost brother Ram's accusers cognitive
[11:24] dissonance caused him to misinterpret
[11:27] this quote about a possible sending
[11:30] forth of a ministry as brother random
[11:32] supporting Jim Jones which brother Brown
[11:34] did not support Jim Jones brother Brown
[11:37] did not send forth Jim Jones's Ministry
[11:39] the cognitive dissonance of brother
[11:41] Ram's accuser caused him to
[11:43] automatically misinterpret this quote
[11:44] about sending forth a Ministry Yet
[11:46] brother I am saying I don't know what
[11:49] the spirit is going to pour out brother
[11:50] Ram's accuser automatically makes false
[11:53] assumptions and false interpretations of
[11:56] brother Brown's quotes on purpose in
[11:58] order to relieve his mental anxiety that
[12:01] perhaps brother random was a true
[12:02] prophet of God
[12:04] now let's get to section 4 on historical
[12:07] facts about Jim Jones
[12:09] friends this is a brief overview I'm
[12:11] only using three online sources but all
[12:15] three sources seem to agree on all the
[12:17] facts about Jim Jones and then all these
[12:19] facts agreed with the audio that I'll
[12:21] share in the next section the audio from
[12:23] Jim Jones himself so the first website
[12:26] says in 1955 Jones left the Assemblies
[12:29] of God after starting there in 1953 this
[12:33] site says Jones left and established
[12:36] wings of healing a new church that would
[12:38] later be named The People's Temple now
[12:40] this website says Jones held his first
[12:43] joint meetings with William Branham in
[12:45] 1955 but again I can't confirm that all
[12:49] I know is that the tapes of brother
[12:51] Branham say brother random preached
[12:53] there in 1956.
[12:55] the same website populartimes.com said
[12:58] in 1956 Jones was ordained as an
[13:02] independent Assembly of God Minister by
[13:04] Joseph Matson Boze I cannot confirm that
[13:08] statement about Boze but then this
[13:10] website said Jones had meetings with
[13:13] brother Branham and that is true because
[13:15] we see the proof of that on tape but of
[13:17] course brother Brandon Warren Jones at
[13:19] least nine times in that sermon and
[13:21] Jones did not take heed to the warnings
[13:24] populartimes.com again said in 1958
[13:26] Jones made a second visit to Father
[13:28] Divine in 1958 to learn more about his
[13:31] practices then Jones bragged to his
[13:34] congregation that he would be like the
[13:36] successor of Father Divine and if you do
[13:38] research on Father Divine he was a false
[13:40] teacher who exercised excessive control
[13:43] over his congregants and friends this
[13:45] show is just two years after being in
[13:47] meetings with brother Branham Jim Jones
[13:49] had already left brother Ram's influence
[13:50] and went to a false teacher
[13:53] in 1960 again populartimes.com says
[13:56] Jones gradually separated from
[13:57] Pentecostalism and the laterane movement
[14:00] and then in 1960 people's Temple joined
[14:03] the Disciples of Christ denomination
[14:06] and remember brother warned Jones not to
[14:08] denominate or join a denomination in the
[14:10] 1956 sermon again showing Jones did not
[14:14] listen to brother Branham
[14:15] then in 1963 populartimes.com said that
[14:19] Jones gave a prophecy to his Indiana
[14:22] congregation that the world would be
[14:24] engulfed by nuclear war on July 15 1967
[14:27] leading to a new socialist Eden on Earth
[14:30] and that the temple must move to
[14:32] Northern California for safety so of
[14:35] course this is a false Prophecy from Jim
[14:36] Jones
[14:37] then in 1964 Jones joined and was
[14:41] ordained a minister by the Disciples of
[14:43] Christ
[14:44] then in 1965 a second website NZ
[14:49] herald.co writes that by 1965 when Jones
[14:53] was in his mid-30s he drifted away from
[14:56] traditional Christian teachings
[14:58] describing himself as a messiah and
[15:00] claiming he was The Reincarnation of
[15:02] figures like Christ and Buddha so notice
[15:05] Friends by 1965 brother Ram's last year
[15:07] on Earth Jim Jones was no longer
[15:10] teaching Christianity he was a
[15:12] self-proclaimed Messiah and claimed to
[15:14] be The Reincarnation of Christ and
[15:16] Buddha a third website the gospel
[15:19] coalition.org said in 1965 Jim Jones
[15:22] told his parishioners quote if you're
[15:25] born in a socialist Community then
[15:27] you're not born in sin end quote and of
[15:30] course this is a Lie the Bible says
[15:31] we're all born in sin Romans 3 says
[15:34] we've all fallen short of the glory of
[15:36] God because of our sin and brother
[15:38] Branham said numerous times at least 10
[15:39] times were all born in sin so we can
[15:42] clearly see by 1965 Jim Jones was not
[15:45] teaching Christianity he was disagreeing
[15:47] with the Bible itself and exalting
[15:49] socialism to the absolute truth and not
[15:52] the Bible
[15:53] in the early 1970s The Gospel Coalition
[15:56] website said Jones abandoned all
[15:59] pretense of being a Christian minister
[16:01] and Jones began preaching he was The
[16:03] Reincarnation of Buddha Gandhi Vladimir
[16:06] Lenin and Jesus
[16:08] the website says quote he would preach
[16:10] sermons lasting six hours or more in
[16:12] which he showed a preoccupation with sex
[16:14] the website goes on to say quote Jones a
[16:17] bisexual reportedly had numerous affairs
[16:19] with both men and women in his
[16:21] congregation his former bodyguard
[16:23] claimed that Jones appointed one of his
[16:25] secretaries to arrange for women church
[16:27] members to sleep with him he was also
[16:30] arrested in Hollywood Theater on lewd
[16:32] conduct charge after an undercover Los
[16:35] Angeles policeman said Jones had tried
[16:38] to molest him end quote
[16:41] populartimes.com said in 1974 after a
[16:45] period of negative publicity and reports
[16:47] of abuse at people's Temple Jones
[16:49] ordered the construction of the
[16:50] Jonestown commune in Guyana in 1974 and
[16:54] convinced or compel many of his
[16:55] followers to live there with him
[16:57] in March of 1977 a story in the new West
[17:01] magazine exposed the abuses at the
[17:03] people's Temple
[17:05] the article included allegations by
[17:07] Temple defectors a physical emotional
[17:09] and sexual abuse shortly after this Jim
[17:12] Jones fled the USA and went to live with
[17:15] some of his followers in Guyana
[17:18] and then tragically in November 1978
[17:20] Congressman Ryan led a fact-finding
[17:23] mission to Jonestown to investigate
[17:25] allegations of Human Rights abuses his
[17:28] delegation included relatives of Temple
[17:30] members and NBC camera crew and
[17:33] reporters for several newspapers the
[17:36] group arrived in the Guyanese capital of
[17:37] Georgetown on November 15th but
[17:40] tragically on November 18 1978 Jim
[17:43] Jones's security guards murdered all of
[17:47] Congressman Ryan's party and then that
[17:49] led to the mass suicide of Jones and his
[17:52] followers this mass murder suicide
[17:55] resulted in the deaths of over 909
[17:57] inhabitants of Jonestown it was the
[17:59] greatest single loss of American
[18:01] civilian life the massive loss of life
[18:04] on September 11 2001.
[18:07] some of Jim Jones last words were caught
[18:10] on tape and I'll play in a little bit
[18:12] but one of his quotes was quote without
[18:14] me life has no meaning just relax and
[18:16] you'll have no problem end quote
[18:19] here again we see Jim Jones exalting
[18:21] himself as equal to God of course this
[18:24] proves Jim Jones was a demon-possessed
[18:26] wicked person
[18:29] in closing
[18:31] friends for time's sake I got to stop
[18:33] right here this is the end of part two
[18:35] but Lord willing I'll finish this series
[18:37] with part three later in the next week
[18:40] by the grace of God I'll end with this
[18:42] quote I heard brother random say this
[18:44] recently it's from the anointed ones at
[18:46] the end time 1965 and it just related so
[18:50] well to brother branham's warnings to
[18:51] Jim Jones and what eventually played out
[18:54] in Jim Jones's life brother random says
[18:56] every Prophet cursed denominations and
[18:59] of course Jim Jones was warned by
[19:01] Brother random not to get into
[19:02] denomination yet he went into
[19:03] denomination and then again brother
[19:05] Branham used the example of Ahab and how
[19:08] Ahab reaped what he sowed he listened to
[19:10] lying prophets which led to his death
[19:12] and just like brother Brandon Moore and
[19:14] Jim Jones Jim Jones was the lying
[19:16] Prophet that led he and his over 900
[19:19] followers to their deaths and brother
[19:21] Graham said all you false teachers so
[19:24] saith God someday you'll reap what
[19:26] you're sowing you blind leaders of the
[19:27] blind end quote
[19:29] what an astonishing warning from the
[19:31] Holy Spirit to all false teachers
[19:33] including Jim Jones that they will reap
[19:36] what they sow Jim Jones sowed all these
[19:39] awful sins he was a demon-possessed man
[19:41] and sadly he reaped what he sowed let's
[19:44] listen to the quote from Brother Branham
[20:02] the holy spirit is the prophet of this
[20:04] hour and vindicating his word proving it
[20:09] the Holy Spirit was the prophet of Moses
[20:12] hour
[20:13] the Holy Spirit was a prophet of
[20:15] America's hour
[20:16] the Holy Spirit which wrote the word
[20:18] Crimson compared to her
[20:20] I didn't happen in the time in America
[20:22] Ahab was killed and the dogs licked his
[20:25] daughter according to the word of God
[20:28] all you forces
[20:32] Dear God
[20:34] [Music]
[20:41] I'm not angry
[20:44] I'm just telling you the truth
[20:48] in that room with the Holy Spirit as
[20:50] they say in that manner
[20:52] have I ever told you anything wrong but
[20:54] what God proved it to be right amen
