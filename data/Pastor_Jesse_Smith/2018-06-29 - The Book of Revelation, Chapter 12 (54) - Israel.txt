TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] Revelation chapter 12 the theme of this chapter is simply Israel as she is the woman clothed with the Sun who brought forth a man child Jesus Christ whom the great red dragon Satan tried to devour but failed because this chapter is highly symbolic we will combine the timing symbols and key revelations and go from the beginning of the chapter to the end the timing of verses 1 & 2 was just before the birth of Jesus Christ the woman with a crown of twelve stars was the people of Israel for the twelve stars represent the 12 tribes of Israel the woman's clothing of the Sun represents God's grace or his righteousness apart from the law that she was promised and will be given through this man child the moon represents the law that was under her feet because the moon constantly has a shadow on it and the Bible said the law having a shadow of good things to come in Hebrews 10 verse 1 the timing of verses 3 & 4 was again just before the birth of Jesus Christ the great red dragon was Satan as we are told this interpretation in verse 9 notice in verse 4 that Satan drew a third part of the stars of heaven and cast them to the earth which represents Satan deceiving a third of the angels in heaven and bringing them to earth to help him carry out his plans to steal kill and destroy the dragon then stood before the woman Israel ready to devour the Christ child which was fulfilled in Matthew 2 verses 16 through 18 when Herod slew all the children in Bethlehem from two years old and under the timing of verses five and six was during the first coming of Jesus Christ to the earth verse five speaks of the birth and life of Christ and the prophecy of his rule with a rod of iron during the 1,000 year millennial reign as taught in Revelation 19 verse 15 and revelation 20 verses one through six the manchild Christ was caught up unto God and his throne when he ascended to the Father 40 days after his resurrection according to Acts chapter 1 verses 3 through 9 Hebrews 8:1 and revelation 3:21 this is where Christ is currently seated right now as High Priest according to Hebrews 7 verses 24 through 26 and Hebrews 8 verse 1 in verse 6 the fleeing of this woman Israel into the wilderness represents that the Jews rejected their Messiah and were broken off from the life of Christ in the New Testament according to Romans 11 verse 19 God foreknew they would reject his son so he blinded them in order to call out a Gentile bride for his namesake according to Romans 11:25 and Acts 1514 yet our merciful God had a place prepared for them meaning he would not forsake them as the fifth seal proved and promised to feed them with the preaching of the two witnesses during the 1260 days or three-and-a-half-year ministry during the Tribulation Period taught in Revelation chapter 11 verse 3 the timing of verses seven through nine was sometime before Adam and Eve fell into sin because we are told how the dragon Satan was first cast to the earth Satan and his angels had fought a war against Michael the Archangel and his angels according to Jude 1 verse 9 and lost being cast to the earth a key revelation from chapter 12 verse 9 is that Satan deceives the whole world as also taught in Revelation 13:7 14-8 eighteen three and 1823 as every Kingdom is ultimately influenced and controlled by Satan according to Jesus Christ himself in Matthew 4 verses 8 & 9 Satan's tool for deception is the false Church the Roman Catholic Church who is Mystery Babylon which we will cover in Revelation chapters 13 17 and 18 the timing of verses 10 through 12 is at the beginning of and during the Tribulation Period the Lord's Day is coming in these verses meaning the kingdoms of men are going to fall to Christ and his kingdom Satan the accuser of the brethren is cast down out of heaven immediately after the rapture of the New Testament Bride of Christ Satan knows his time is short only three and a half years and so he comes to the earth with great wrath ready to lay down his evil mark of the beast but the 144,000 Jews will overcome Satan by the blood of the Lamb and the word of their testimony even loving Christ more than their own lives the timing of verses 13 through 17 is again during the Tribulation Period in verse 13 we learn more about Satan's plan to persecute Israel even going to make war against Israel but God will nourish her for three and a half years through the Ministry of the two prophets or witnesses of revelation 11 verse 3 God's love for Israel will swallow up a flood that Satan tries to bring against her a key revelation is the woman's remnant which must be the 144,000 mentioned earlier in Revelation 7 verses 1 through 8 for the Bible records this remnant as having both the commandments of God which is faith in the infallible teachings of the Old Testament and the testimony of Jesus Christ the New Testament faith if you would like more bible scriptures quotations or if you have any questions about the book of Revelation
