TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to enter the question should Christians pay tithe the answer is yes according to the Bible not only should they tithe but they should also give offerings here's scriptural proof directly from the New Testament about the necessity to give tithes and offerings there are four New Testament Scriptures that support tithing and offering ties are supported in 1st Corinthians 9 verses 1 to 16 and acts 4 verses 33 to 37 offerings are supported in Luke 21 verse 4 and acts 24 17 definition and origin first the word tithe means tenth or a tenth part 10% tithes originated before the law in Genesis chapter 14 with Abraham being the first type payer around 1900 BC so you and I need to remember that typing is an act of faith God originated before the law then ties were continued during the law about four hundred years after Abraham in 1490 BC as recorded in Leviticus chapter 27 verse 30 finally around 59 ad God confirmed that tithing was ordained even after the law in the New Testament in 1st Corinthians 9 verse 14 an example of tithing and offering for example if you were paid $1,000 for work $100 would be 10% and would be your tithe payment you'd have 900 left and would want to give a free will offering to support God's ministry if you gave $10 as an offering that would be an additional 1% making your total giving $110 or 11% you would have $190 left to use as you see fit payments to whom are ties paid as you'll soon see st. Paul teaches ties are paid to New Testament preachers just as Old Testament Saints paid their tithes and offerings to the Levites New Testament Christians are not under the Levitical priesthood but God has ordained a similar system for giving under the Melchizedek Priesthood in the Old Testament the believers brought their tithes and offerings to God's storehouse or tabernacle or temple according to Malachi 3 verse 10 Christians should bring their tithes and offerings to their storehouse or main place of worship which is their local church each local church is led by the pastor or Shepherd which is one of the five preaching gifts according to Ephesians 4 verse 11 the ties only not the offerings go directly to the pastor so you can either live on them not having to work a separate job while focusing on studying the Word of God and praying or he can work a regular job and donate most or all the ties to support the churches ministries helping the poor maintaining the facilities and doing missionary work etc the offerings go directly to the church treasury and not to the pastor as they pay for all the other needs of the assembly New Testament tithing scriptural proof number 1 in 1st Corinthians 9 verses 1 to 16 st. Paul replies to those who questioned his apostolic ministry detailing the rites of Ministers which include the right to be compensated for ministering the right to marry a Christian woman as Peter was married and the right to refrain from outside work Paul himself did not always exercise these rights as he did not want to hinder the gospel of Christ but he stated them since some preachers would have to exercise these rights Paul then compares a minister to a soldier a vineyard owner and a Shepherd which all directly benefit from their labor soldiers are paid vineyard owners eat their produce shepherds drink the milk from their flocks Paul even says the Old Testament law gives New Testament ministers these rights quoting Deuteronomy 25 verse 4 which compares preachers to laboring oxen thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out the corn Paul uses a greater to lesser argument to justify his right for preachers to receive money if he supplied spiritual things to the Corinthians the greater blessing it was suitable for him as a preacher to receive material blessings the lesser from them in return the climax of this passage is verses 13 and 14 proving tithes and offerings are ordained of the Lord do you not know that they which Minister about holy things live of the things of the temple and they which wait at the altar are partakers with the altar even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel Paul teaches that God wants New Testament preachers to live from the tithes and offerings of the Christians who benefit from their preaching just as or even so the Old Testament ministers the Levites live from the tithes and offerings of Israel a must stop and say that the love of money is a great danger for preachers who receive ties as Paul told Timothy to flee monetary temptations for it is a great temptation ensnare leading to destruction and perdition according to 1st Timothy 6 verses 6 through 12 but they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare and into many foolish and hurtful lusts which drown men in destruction and perdition for the love of money is the root of all evil which while some coveted after they have erred from the faith and pierced themselves through with many sorrows but Thou O man of God flee these things and follow after righteousness godliness faith love patience meekness ministers should not seek to get rich Christ gave all his money away and lived a total life of sacrifice pastors who receive tithes must be faithful stewards for they will give an account of themselves on the day they stand before the judgment seat of Christ for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ Romans 14:10 also even pastors must tithe on the ties they receive God ordains that everyone has to pay tithe even pastors scriptural proof number two acts for verses 33 to 37 gives us a detailed example of how the Holy Ghost immediately led the Saints who were freshly baptized with the Holy Ghost to follow this god-ordained pattern even before God taught it through st. Paul's ministry soon after being born again the believers sold their possessions and laid the money at the feet of the Apostles or preachers who made distribution based upon need and with great power gave the Apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus and great grace was upon them neither was there any among them that lacked for as many as we're possessors of lands or houses sold them and brought the prices of the things that were sold and laid them down at the Apostles feet and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need offerings scriptural proof number one Jesus allowed a destitute widow woman to pay all of her living in an offering to the temple and he looked up and saw the rich man casting their gifts into the Treasury and he saw also a certain poor Widow casting in thither two mites and he said of a truth I say unto you that this poor Widow hath cast in more money than they are for all these have of their abundance cast in unto the offerings of God but she of her penury hath cast in all the living that she had scriptural proof number two st. Paul himself the apostle prophet and teacher who taught God ordained tithes and offerings in the New Testament paid offerings himself to the temple in Jerusalem and herein do I exercise myself to have always a conscious void of offense toward God and toward men now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation and offerings whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple neither with multitude nor with tumult st. Paul further instructs us on a heart condition when giving it must be cheerful but this I say he which soweth sparingly shall also reap sparingly and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully everyman accordingly as he has purposed in his heart so let him give not grudgingly or of necessity for God loveth a cheerful Giver this is the end of part 1 please continue viewing part 2 which covers the following the blessings and benefits of paying tithes and offerings consequences of not paying God tithes and offerings if you have any questions about giving tithes and offerings in the New Testament please contact us god bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
