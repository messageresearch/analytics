TRANSCRIPT
========================================
On February [music] 18th, 1961, God's prophet, Brother William Marin Brham, [music] preached a sermon called Balman Gilead in Long Beach, California, as the [music] 13th out of 14 sermons preached in a two-week campaign. For further context on this [music] sermon, 7 days before this, on February 11th, 1961, Danny Henry gave his notable tongues [music] prophecy about brother Brandham and how he had chosen the narrow path and it was a glorious decision in the sight of the Lord Jesus. [music] And it would bring to pass the tremendous victory in the love divine. Two [music] months prior to this, Brother Brham had preached the revelation of the seven church ages in Jeffersonville, Indiana. And the pillar of fire [music] was visibly seen at the end of the series on the church ages on January 8th, [music] 1961. &gt;&gt; Now look this way, y'all. Now that's just like it is when it comes on glory here. See, it's a light where you're you're moving here. You see now look, it's just it's just a reflection. Just a reflection. That is See, it's not the light. Here's the light hanging right here. See, I hear this woman. I just happened to catch it and I thought it was over somebody now. You're seeing one. I'm seeing two. One of them is the natural, the other is the supernatural. There's a man sitting on the outside here of this line looking over towards that light struck him. He's from Seymour, Indiana. and he's got had a stroke. If you'll believe, sir, God will heal you of that stroke. Amen. Believe now. You believe with all your heart. &gt;&gt; At the conclusion then of the balm and Gilead sermon in Long Beach, Brother Brandham called the preachers up to the front of the [music] church to form a double line, as he called it, which was what we would call a prayer tunnel today. when those [music] desiring prayer walk through a prayer line with preachers on both sides of them so the preachers [music] can lay hands on them as they walk through the prayer line. Brother Random said he [music] called the pastors up, evangelists, missionaries because he didn't want the people's faith to be only in his ministry. He wanted their [music] faith to be in the ministries of their local pastors, evangelists, and missionaries. [music] &gt;&gt; I want to show you something. Pastors, evangelists, missionaries. How many of you all are believers? &gt;&gt; See, now I'm going to ask as many as you all the chance to come right down here with me. See, I I not let the evangelist have everything to do. The people, I don't want you to have your faith built into an evangelist. I want you to have your faith built in your own pastor. He's the man who's going to lead you from here out. See, and these men, come down, some of you brethren, come down here. Let's form a double life. Yeah. A double line. These men are men of God that believe. I'm going to stand right in the middle of them and we're going to pray. How many out there's going to be praying for him, too? Out there. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon then asked the people if they were proud of their pastors. And the congregation [music] said, "Praise the Lord." &gt;&gt; You know what I'm going to tell you? It makes me proud in my heart and grateful to find servants of God that'll stand before the people and say, "I'm a witness of this gospel, too." &gt;&gt; Aren't you proud of your pastors? Say, "Praise the Lord if you're proud of these pastors." We're proud of our brother. Amen. We're proud of them. &gt;&gt; And brother Brennham even said the pastors [music] had just as much of the anointing to lay hands on the sick as he did. They are your pastors. A pastor means a shepherd. These each of these men has just as much of anointing to lay hands on the sick as I do. &gt;&gt; Notice Brother Bram never exalted himself above the local pastors, evangelists, teachers, apostles, or missionaries. Brother Bram never told them to sit down and let Brother Bram do all the praying. He never said they should sit down and let Brother Ram do all the [music] preaching. Brother M never said when I leave just press play and obey. So we [music] see the true godly Christian character of brother Brham. The fruits of his life and ministry are the genuine [music] fruits of the Holy Ghost which is unlike the current leadership and Bible denying character we see at [music] the Brandom Tabernacle. But we continue to pray that their awful, sad, deceived spiritual [music] state will be cast down and they could have a genuine Holy Ghost [music] revival of repentance coming back to the word of God, which includes [music] living preachers standing behind the pulpits preaching the living word of God. Next, Brother [music] Random made such a shocking statement to me that I had to stop the tape and go back and listen to it to make sure I heard it correctly. Brother Brandham said those Long Beach pastors had a higher office [music] than Brother Brandham. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm not a preacher. They're a preacher. They've got a higher office than I have. They've got a higher office than I have. &gt;&gt; After hearing that, I thought, what would the current Brandom Tabernacle think if they heard those words from their prophet? This video's thumbnail is my guess as to what a tape [music] worshiping congregation might look like as they listen to that tape. And brother Brandham saying, "The Long Beach pastors had a higher office [music] than Brother Brandham, the man that they erroneously exalt to infallibility." And this [music] thumbnail is my imagination as to the surprise that would probably be on their faces if they were actually listening with honest hearts. I wondered if Brandham Tabernacle would ever [music] play this tape at their regularly scheduled one time a week worldwide tape playing [music] routine, which is far less than the three sermons Brandham Tabernacle held weekly while brother was alive. So notice current Brandham Tabernacle people are only listening to one sermon each week rather than the three live preaching sermons that brother Brandham ordained while he was alive. [music] So Brennham Tabernacle currently has changed from the the live preaching [music] schedule that their prophet ordained while he was alive on this earth. And I wondered if Brandham Tabernacle believed every word on tape was thus [music] say the Lord as they erroneously claim. Then what is the order of the offices now that they've heard brother Brandham's order [music] of the offices? Brandom Tabernacles blog post twice says brother Brandham is the greatest prophet of all time. So, if that is true, which I disagree with because I believe [music] Jesus Christ is the greatest prophet of all time, where does that place these Long Beach, California pastors, evangelists, and teachers, and missionaries [music] in the order of highest offices? In the September 13th, 2023 Brandham Tabernacle blog [music] post, they said, "Brother Random was called to a much higher office than all of them," referring to Abraham, Moses, Elijah, and Elisha. [music] So according to this quote from brother Brandham in Balgilead, these Long Beach pastors, [music] teachers, evangelists, and missionaries must have been some very special pastors if their office was higher than brother Brandham [music] who is Brandham Tabernacle's goat. And these Long Beach pastors [music] would therefore have a higher office than Abraham, Moses, Elijah, and Elisha. Before giving my thoughts on this question, [music] let's finish listening to the rest of this quote and hear brother Random explain why he felt these Long Beach pastors, [music] evangelists, and missionaries had a higher office than he did. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm not a preacher. They're preachers. They've got a higher office than I have. Mine's a prophetic office, and it's a prophet sign. Now, they're not they wasn't built for that. They wasn't ordained for that. But what does the Bible say? God has set in the church apostles. That's missionaries, [music] prophets, pastors, teachers, evangelists. Is that right? &gt;&gt; The gifts ordained of God and anointed. Now, I have no education. That's the reason I say I'm not a preacher. These men could take this word and they wouldn't have to use one of these gifts. They could just lay that word out there so they taste such a he couldn't get out of it. See? But I can't do that. That's not my calling. They are called for that now. But they're they're a man of God. Every man that's called of God is commissioned to lay hands on the sick and they shall recover. How many believe that? &gt;&gt; Then how you going to fail from getting well passed into a ark like this? &gt;&gt; So brother Random [music] says these Long Beach pastors had a higher office because their pastoral gifts were different [music] than Brother Random's prophetic gift. Brother Random said their pastoral gifts could tie Satan in such a knot that he couldn't get out [music] of it. And brother Random said, quote, "But I can't do that. That's not my calling." End quote. &gt;&gt; These men could take this word and they wouldn't have to use one of these gifts. They could just lay that word out there so that Satan is such a he couldn't get out of it. See, I can't do that. That's not my calling. They are called for that. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; So, brother Ram said, "These pastors could do something brother Brandham could not do because of the gift [music] of God in their life." So, what is the truth on this quote? Is this quote biblical from God's prophet brother Brandham? I believe it is when you consider the highest [music] offices in at least three different contexts. These three contexts are first the local church, [music] second the five-fold ministry, and third who the word [music] of God is revealed to. Let's first begin with the local church. In 1957, brother Brandham said he believed [music] the supreme authority of the local assembly is the local elder. [music] He said, "Show me by the Bible what's greater in the Bible than a local elder to a local church." And he went [music] on to say, "But the full and complete authority of the church is the pastor. Read that in the Bible. [music] See if that's not Bible order." That's exactly right. There's no one above the elder. I have nothing to do with what Brother Neville does here. That's up [music] to you and brother Neville. End quote. But I believe in the supreme authority of the local assembly. Show me with the Bible what's greater in the Bible than a local elder to a local church. [music] That's right. Yes. The sovereignty of the local church, each church in itself, but the full and complete authority of the church is the [music] pastor. Read that in the Bible. See if that's not Bible order. That's exactly right. There's no one above the elder. I have nothing to do with what brother Neville does here. That's up to you and brother Neville. If brother Neville wanted to preach Jehovah Witness doctrine, that's up to him and you. See, if he wanted to preach anything he [clears throat] wanted to, that's between you and him. That's all. If the congregation votes for him in there to preach that, that's all right. That's up to him. The only thing that I do just is owning the property. And if something another comes by that it's a like moving the pastor and they want to take a vote on that, you couldn't ask the deacon to do that. You'd come ask me. I'd come down and say, "If you want to move the pastor, tell me why. Has he done anything?" &gt;&gt; So now it's easy to understand why Brother Ran would say these Long Beach pastors, evangelists, and missionaries [music] had a higher office than him. He was referring to the local assembly. In the local assembly, no one has more authority [music] than the pastor. The second context is the five-fold ministry. Ephesians 4:11 [music] gives us the order of offices and it places the apostle first, prophet second, evangelist third, [music] pastors fourth, and teachers fifth. Of course, brother Brandham agreed with this Bible revelation. In remembering [music] the Lord 1962, brother Brandham said Judas sold his Lord after he had the opportunity to [music] even to be a disciple to be an apostle, the highest calling in the Bible, higher than a prophet. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; He isn't fit for heaven. WHY? HE SOLD HIS LORD AFTER HE HAD the opportunity to even to be a a disciple TO BE AN APOSTLE. THE HIGHEST CALLING in the Bible. Higher than a prophet. To be an apostle. The highest calling in the Bible. Higher than a prophet. So in the first two contexts we have two different offices that are higher than one another. [music] In the local church the pastor is higher than the prophet and the apostle as [music] far as authority over the local assembly. But in the five-fold ministry the apostle is above the prophet evangelist pastor and teacher. The third context [music] is to whom the word of the lord is revealed to. And the bible tells us the word of the lord came [music] to the prophet. So the third context is revelation. the office of receiving revelation. [music] Brother Ram told us in the anointed ones of the end time that there is no more higher order to [music] reveal the word than prophets. But the only way the prophet can be vindicated is by the word. &gt;&gt; No more. There's no more higher order to reveal the word than prophets. &gt;&gt; But the ONLY WAY THE PROPHET CAN BE A VINDICATED IS BY THE WORD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO THE highest office for revelation of the word of God [music] is the prophet. After that, it's my guess that it would be the five-fold ministry. [music] And then after that, it would likely be all the rest of the believers. This is based on a quote brother Random said [music] in the fifth seal. He said, "We don't want to never think that because some little wash woman [music] or or little plow boy out there couldn't get a revelation from God because you see it's God, he actually reveals himself in simplicity." Now, we don't want to never think it because some little wash woman or or a little plow boy out there couldn't get a re revelation from God because you see it God uh he uh actually reveals himself in simplicity. That's we had that Sunday to start this off on how he reveals himself in his simplicity. uh that's what makes him great. &gt;&gt; So based upon these [music] quotes from God's prophet brother Brandham and the Bible scriptures, we learned brother Brandham was showing the [music] supreme authority of the local church giving double honor to the pastors who labored in the word and doctrine according to St. Paul. As true Holy Ghostfilled message [music] believers, we do not add to the Bible nor take away one word from the holy scripture. We don't say press play and obey. We don't say [music] tape boys are the true five-fold ministry. We don't say the tapes are the token. We don't say preachers [music] should sit down and just press play because that's not in the Bible. We rejoice [music] in this quote from 1961 Bal and Gilead because it shows brother Ram's respect for [music] the five-fold ministry that St. Paul ordained in Ephesians chapter 4 by the leadership of the Lord Jesus [music] Christ who inspired Paul to write these truths. We strive, as brother Random did, to stay with every single word of the Holy Bible because we want to be blessed and not cursed. As Paul said in Galatians chapter 1, we hang our souls on any phrase of the Bible because we are fundamental believers in the Bible. Just like the [music] seventh church age messenger, William Miriam Brandom. And I believe that Paul said, "If an angel from heaven would come and teach any other thing than what you had already been taught in this scripture, let him be unto you a curse." Galatians 1:8. So I am a fundamental believer in the Bible. &gt;&gt; What the Bible says, I believe it. And I believe it's the truth and ready to hang my soul on any phase of the Bible or any any sentence comma whatever it might be [music] that God's word is everlasting true. It's inspired and written and we stay [music] with it. [music] &gt;&gt; [music] [music] [music] &gt;&gt; Heat. [music] [music] [music] Heat. &gt;&gt; [music] [music] [music] [music] [music] [music]
