[0:00] well now many of these
[0:02] little pretty faed mothers sitting here
[0:06] some of them 60 or 70 years old would
[0:08] say what have I done brother brandom
[0:11] you've raised your
[0:13] children you've done what you were
[0:16] supposed to do maybe some old dad
[0:19] sitting here say well I've hired the
[0:21] fields I've done this I never preach but
[0:24] you did just what God sent for you to do
[0:28] there's a place for you
[0:31] speaking to an old doctor yesterday one
[0:34] of my doctor friends
[0:37] buddies 80 something years
[0:42] old
[0:44] and his
[0:47] sister-in-law is here at the church
[0:50] tonight and she's been just a tingle
[0:53] teeny bit worried about him and I went
[0:57] to see him and as soon as I began to
[1:00] talk to him he brightened up told me
[1:03] about a hunting trip he taken many years
[1:05] ago up in Colorado in the very same
[1:07] country I hunt and just as brilliant and
[1:11] bright and I said Doctor how long you
[1:14] been practicing he said when you were
[1:17] nursing and way down I said a many a
[1:20] time he said I've practiced taking my
[1:23] buggy I put my saddle bags over my
[1:27] horse I took the little
[1:30] Cel and I've walked and I said yes down
[1:33] along the creek Banks 2:00 in the
[1:35] morning with your flashlight trying to
[1:38] find the house where her little child
[1:39] had tummy acre mother and labor
[1:42] pains that's
[1:45] right and I said you know doctor I
[1:48] believe
[1:49] across this dividing line here between
[1:51] Mortal and immortality God has a place
[1:55] for good old doctors that serve like
[1:58] that great tears come in his eyes and he
[2:01] started crying he reached up his feeble
[2:04] hands and said brother I hope so across
[2:08] the
[2:10] land god judges a man's
[2:13] Soul what he is then I give him this
[2:17] satisfying
[2:18] scripture many times plying through
[2:21] those dark muddy fields at night trying
[2:23] to help
[2:24] somebody maybe never get a penny for but
[2:27] it's all right I said Jesus said in the
[2:32] scripture blessed are the merciful for
[2:36] they shall obtain Mercy
[2:41] amen and that is
[2:45] true
