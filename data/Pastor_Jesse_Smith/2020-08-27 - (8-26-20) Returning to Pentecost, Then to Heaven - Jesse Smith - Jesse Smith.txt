little rough night sleeping last night you know but other than that he's been doing real good by god's grace let's pray for my wife and the baby i haven't heard anything about my dad so no news is good news um and i was just uh i was listening to a sermon yesterday in the car and all of a sudden the preacher is like if you believe it thank god in advance so but amen i'm just driving on the road all of a sudden i start clapping i say thank you jesus you're going to heal my dad you know i'm crying and everything i'm just going to try to do everything i can to put all my faith into this and trust god to do a great thing so we just want to be doers of the word praise god not yours only but doers so it's a good thing to have faith and that when we have faith we should already have the quarter right my bread's on the way i praise god i'm gonna go get my bread so i can rejoice because there's bread for me i got the purchasing price i got faith so let's remember that in prayer a very urgent request brother brooks said his mother-in-law sister ruby washington she's already been healed of cancer numerous times but she's got cancer again and they just sent her to hospice today she's got to be in her 80s maybe 90s wonderful saint when brother brooks was here in june he was telling testimonies about her she's been healed numerous times brother brooks says they're still believing for a miracle and sister ruby doesn't believe it's her time to go home i appreciate that faith let's just pray let's ask god to be merciful we've seen a couple people come out of hospice yes by god's grace i can't remember now but there's i remember there's numerous testimonies uh we've seen people come out of hospice and god has done great things so let's just keep that in prayer also uh brother vang his hours are still lower so let's just pray that the company will pick up by god's grace and simon's been overworked so let's pray for him that he's rested a little bit and then amen said pray

whether we're on our knees whether we're shouting crying god hears our prayers amen he hears the humble sincere prayers i'm so glad he does amen he is faithful praise god let's remember how great god is god heard jonah in the belly of a whale with vomit all over him and the bible said seaweed and if god heard that what about us praise god we're under the blood of jesus christ hallelujah so let's agree together let's you can let's bow our heads here heavenly father we love you jesus we sing out we praise you lord god we thank you god for your great works you're mighty to save oh god all things

you lord god for all these blessings father take this night lord god forgive us of our sins and lord please hear our prayers and our sincerity as as we said you heard jonah in the belly of a whale and

pray to know that all things are possible in jesus christ's name and the church said amen praise god let's take our bibles tonight let's go to our our text will be joel 2 i kind of want to go back to the rapture brother amen and i were talking on sunday and he just kept asking good questions about the rapture so i want to uh i want to preach just a little bit on the rapture tonight by god's grace and then we'll do our memory verse so let's go to joel 2. now i've said this before i'm going to keep saying one of these days i'm going to get the words up there our vision and joel 2 23-26 lord willing if god will help me i know it's a small thing but i never want to forget our vision because without the vision the people perish we have to know what season we're living in we have to know what word are we trusting in we're trusting in a full restoration of pentecost amen that's what we are trusting in that's the promise of god for this hour and it's not just thus saith ourselves or thus saith the denomination it's thus saith the lord amen hallelujah thank the lord i'm almost done with this last chapter i'm working on chapter 13 almost done i'm also about halfway done with the next youtube video uh i'm doing it on tape boys so i'm almost i just gotta record all the audio brother rams quote so everybody can hear tate boys are not in the five full ministry brother ram said they're a secondary ministry he said the highest form of communicating is live preachers but says that tate boys are secondary ministry they have their part but the highest communication is god anointing his fivefold ministry to preach to his wife joel 2. i still haven't heard back from uh jeffersonville so i'm kind of waiting on that by god's grace that's okay they waited six months for my email so they had patience with me i could have really kindness with them patience with them by the grace of the lord now just for time's sake uh i'm just going to read verse 23 because don't forget though verse 25 i'll restore to you the years all those years that the denominations were stealing away the anointing i said killing the anointing god remembered all those years and he's going to restore all those years praise god verse 23 let's read that together joel 2 23 on 3 1 2 3 be glad then ye children of zion and rejoice in the lord your god for he hath given you the former rain moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month praise god if you notice verse 25 and i'll restore to you the years that the locusts hath eaten praise god and goes through all those uh different stages of the same insect different stages of the antichrist spirit okay let's go to our memory verse matthew 6. what a great scripture for this coveted pestilence that we're living in that if we seek god first everything else will be added unto us amen i'm a witness of that praise god as i see god he supplies everything got a little testimony i'll share it hopefully during the preaching i'll wait till the holy spirit brings it out i was just feeling sorry for myself and again i was gonna complain to god and then god had a great testimony for us on saturday so i have to share that one here i may wait till live streams off so god is good i tell you god is just so merciful made me weep and cry god is so gracious uh matthew 6 30 let's read 39-34 on three one two three wherefore if god so clothed the grass of the field which today is and tomorrow is cast into the oven shall he not much more clothe you o ye of little faith therefore take no thought say what shall we eat or what shall we drink or wherewith all shall we be clothed for after all these things do the gentiles seek for your heavenly father knoweth that ye have need of all these things but seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you take therefore no thought for the morrow for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof may god add his blessings to ring of his word you may be seated praise god i'll write that down two testimonies at the end okay praise the lord okay can you switch over please malcolm thank you sir now kind of as i said i was talking with brother amen and he just had all these great questions about the rapture and the latter rain and so it made me brother amen as i was thinking about that it brought this quote to me it's from christ as the mystery of god is revealed you know what i just go to that then you can see it yeah so let me just start with this and lord willing sunday maybe i'll pick up on this lord willing um but this quote came to my mind after brother amen uh and i were talking christ the mystery god revealed this is a three hour sermon by the way it's i've never i don't think i've preached this whole thing remember a couple years ago i was preaching like one sermon just all the way through i don't think i preached this one i don't think so i'd like to well the graham said god's great mystery of how it's a secret he kept it in a secret nobody knows nothing about it even the angels didn't understand it see he didn't reveal it that's the reason i talk about the rapture under our seventh mystery when the seventh seal was opened there was silence right revelation 8 1. jesus when he was on the earth they wanted to know when he would come he said it's not even the son himself don't know what's going to happen remember he said the day or the hour knoweth no man not even the son not even the angels but the father only see god has this all to himself it's a secret and that's the reason there was silence in heaven for the space of an hour and the seven thunders uttered their voices and john was even forbidden to write it see the coming of the lord that's one thing he hasn't revealed yet of how he will come and when he will come it's a good thing that he doesn't now here's the here's what came to me as i was just meditating this week and listening to these sermons about the rapture but iran said he showed it or revealed it in every type that's in the bible you get that the seventh seal the coming of the lord is in almost every type in the bible now that's quite a statement therefore the entire bible is the revelation of god's mystery in christ now i i not personally this is my thought i don't believe every single type in the bible is about the rapture right personally so like i said you know like joseph revealing himself to his brother and that doesn't type the rapture now that's right after the rapture but see that doesn't type the rapture that types 144 000. so i think you understand what i'm saying now there could be a case made though that all even that type is related to the rapture right or related to the coming of the lord uh the tribulation right before the armageddon coming of the lord so there's a there's there's a way it could it could be right he said hum the entire bible is an expression of one goal god had one purpose he wanted to achieve all the acts of the believers in the bible has been in type expressing what god's great goal is and now in this last day he's revealed it and shows it and god's help well you'll see right here this morning what the lord has had in his mind all along and expressed it and you remember if you've heard preaching over the last 20 years like i have there's brother adam said in this sermon god has a threefold purpose so the whole bible is about these three purposes to get preeminence in his son which he did to get preeminence in the bride the gentile bride and then to restore eden right the new jerusalem okay so that's the kind of thinking that was coming to me this week uh as i was meditating on those thoughts now let's get back to the beginning here so i just want to preach just a few sermons on this lord willing um on returning to pentecost and returning to heaven okay uh and that my sub topic is the seven seals typed all through the bible so well lord willing we'll get to that maybe sunday and show how there's all the church all these women in the bible they all type the bride whether they're jew or gentile there's a way that all these women i mean you can look at eve even eve right she typed the second eve right the bride how she fell away but she'll be restored amen i mean you can take it with almost every woman in the entire bible and i love how brother just he says these things and they blow our minds but as we study the bible we find out that's exactly right he didn't have the education to say it so neatly like doctors but it but as we as we get under the anointing of the holy spirit we see what he's talking about praise god it goes back to the word now that was our text that's our vision and that's why i put it up here the bible said well there's no vision that people perish but he that keeps the law happy as he so look the word is the vision amen see they connect with no vision you perish but with the law you live so the law the word is the vision praise god so we ought to see the vision for our day now this vision means i like this divine communication if there's no divine thus saith the lord the people perish and that's right right if you reject mother's ministry without thus say the lord they'll perish in the tribulation now they might be saved right foolish virgin we're talking about but if they neglect the divine communication of the of the holy spirit through god's prophet they'll perish in the tribulation that's right church it is it has to be it was always that way now i love this i preached on this years ago uh man probably three four years ago habakkuk now remember chapter one is habakkuk he's complaining amen he's a prophet he's complaining he's like how are these uh sinners not judged and he's complaining to god and so god starts talking like this he said i will stand up or this is habakkuk i will stand upon my watch and set me upon the tower and we'll watch to see what he will say unto me so he complains on the first chapter and he says i'm going to stand the tower and see what god will answer to me and what i shall answer when i am reproved and the lord answered me and said write the vision so he's going to give him a vision and make it plain upon tables that he may run that readeth it amen what does it tell you church it tells you that when god gives you his word he wants you to be aggressive with it amen when god gives you a word he wants you to run with it he doesn't want you to be lazy he wants you to run with it praise god he wants in other words he wants you to actively work upon the the prophecy that he's given the divine communication praise god run with it in other words go tell somebody praise god go tell them amen make it known try to encourage somebody as you're running the race for christ amen he said make it plain upon the tables that he may run that readeth it so when god delivers his word divine word he wants you to run with it praise god that's what that's what the bible says we're doing running the race with what perseverance and patience amen we're patient we know the rapture is soon to come but we're patient we can wait next week if it's next week we can wait next year if it's next year god forbid we can wait if it's 10 more years but what if it's 50 years i'm thinking about that this week milly man you with white hair i see what will amen look like if he's sung leader with white hair what will i look like if my hair falls out because i look at i look at preachers brother amen that now they were younger but now they're older and all their hair fell out but yeah are they patient yes they're still running the race praise god they're still willing to wait praise god right because outwardly we might perish but inwardly we're renewed day by day praise god hallelujah so he said write it that you may run we got to have patience with the word he said for the vision is yet see every vision has a time amen it's got a time and you and i can't do any all we can do is run until it's time for that that vision that we're reading we just gotta run with that and just write until it's time this is the time that it's fulfilled praise god remember brothers at the rapture he said i won't be one second late amen it'll be right on time amen we just got to be patient and run but at the end it shall speak praise god to see when god gives a word it may not feel like it's speaking right then but just keep running keep laboring and then god will thunder from heaven amen amen hallelujah praise god it will speak it won't lie i'm so glad god doesn't lie amen his word through his prophet is the truth and god does not lie to us amen i've never seen it fail now i've seen my discipline i've been disappointed but i've never seen god fail amen see because it all depends on his time and season though at terry wait for it see wait church because it will surely come it will not tarry now this man what let me look at this habakkuk let me look at a backup real quick what year was this oh it's 6 26 uh this was oh this was a hundred years or more before ezra nehemiah and esther and malachi all came and and he's just asking for judgment upon uh the sinners and so his vision was still he wasn't even going to live to see it the church would you be happy in the message if you didn't live to see the rapture yes i'd be happy because i'd rather be in the house of the lord one day than a thousand days with the wicked amen with the tenth of the wicked i'd rather be here if i don't see it so maybe my sons will my dog my sons i can say that now my sons and my daughters will see him praise god amen gee it don't matter he said you just got to believe it this didn't happen for a hundred years but it's gonna happen wait for it praise god because i say like this we may not we may not see like uh the bride's revival like we want to but but it's coming but for sure we can see the world turning into sodom and gomorrah right and if we know sodom and gomorrah and noah's conditions are happening then we know we're ripening too praise god if they're if they're ripening and it's time to bundle them that we can see ourselves ripening as well absolutely praise god but it's all about our expectation right it's all about it's all about what are we expecting we got to expect what the word says and we got to be patient praise god it will come it won't be one second late it won't terry one second behold his soul which is lifted up is not upright see don't get prideful don't think you well i'll start the rapture no you're not unless god calls you to do it right but answer the rapture go from church to church you know it'll be like a wildfire but let's not be prideful let's just be serving god let's be so consecrated that god can use us in the rapture revival praise god that we can be but i love this i love this right here this is where martin luther got it to the just shall live by faith but listen to church see faith isn't what you think faith is you looking at the table and running and reading the vision praise god so faith is just believing what god wrote praise god we just got to say what the word says in order to say what brother brandon said when it lines up with the word and just keep rest and that is faith is trusting in god's word faith is assurance we're assured in what god has told us with us say the lord amen absolutely praise god see so see that's our vision we just got to wait in god's appointed time he'll do it now how many of us how many of us would honestly say like in the last 10 years you were ready for the rapture you were so on fire you had everything you had every devil under your feet who could say that right none of us none of us would say we're that ready right and then and but in god's eyes you know we see our affairs but in god's eyes he sees the whole world and he sees people that want the truth but it hasn't got to them yet amen because he's he's inspiring this person to be a missionary or expire inspiring that person to go preach to them and you know he's doing the the great commission praise god we just see ourselves but really we're not ready god will get us ready and god will save every last soul that wants to go to the marriage supper that i am amen amen remember he told that parable he said my house shall be full every chair every chair at that long table brother said we'll be filled amen and then jesus will serve us oh communion on oh every seat everything will be filled there won't be one person missing on that day praise god and god's got great patience for his harvest remember james james says that james 3 says that i don't have it on here now i'm going over the return to heaven quickly because it's not my main topic right you mean what do you mean return to heaven what i mean is that we were chosen in him before the foundation world so you and i came from the mind of god right that's what i'm saying but we got to return to pentecost first everyone the full bride every member has to return to pentecost so say like this we're there like some of us are there we're just waiting for everybody else to get there praise god right right praise god we're just wait if you've been born again then brother man said if you've been born again you can take somebody back to pentecost amen amen glory and we're waiting for all the bride members to get to pentecost so they can have that experience so they can be a witness amen so they can have the power and be endued with power from on high amen i'm willing to wait till my children get it till they act like me or somewhere close to me they have to be as fanatical as me but they gotta know what it's like to be on the day of pentecost amen i'll wait praise god i'll keep waiting i'm trusting that's gonna happen with all of our children all the children that come here we gotta trust and believe that they'll have the same experience we had like what sister naomi said when how old were you your 13 sister when you had that experience of maybe 12 i think it was like 12 or 13. i want to i want to see some of that happen to the children where they come to church and we got to carry them out because they're just crying or weeping or rejoicing we need to pray for that amen that's the same god hallelujah that's visited us the same god wants to do it to more of us and and more of us want to have it hallelujah amen it can happen at 12. look at that i mean my god our god is more than able praise god see remember god has to work with your will he can't force our children or he can't force us uh the adults that need the holy ghost he can't do that so he's got to wait until we're ready he's got to get us in condition and there's got to be we just got to be patient amen got to be patient we see we'll return to heaven see now the bible says we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle be dissolved we have a building of god and house not made with hands eternal in the heavens that's what i mean when i say we're returning to heaven you say i've never been to heaven well yet maybe not your body but your soul has right because the bible says you've already got a theophany there so that even that theophany was in the mind of god amen right for this we groan oh i'm groaning oh i can't wait brother amen i get a body where i don't have to worry about sinning anymore all these evil thoughts and all these all these evil things that come out of my mouth be selfish if one person i know is selfish i met him it's jesse smith this flesh amen this flesh is selfish so i've got to crucify this so it stops thinking about me and starts being concerned for other people praise god i was saying that this week i'm the most selfish person god help me and i've said it not me it's this evil body it's this past house amen so selfish and it's got to be constantly brought into subjection to the word of god oh but my house over there it's got not one selfish fiber in it amen it's all love amen that's my eternal house ah thank god amen i can't wait to get there amen a house that don't care about itself anymore just cares about other people i got a foretaste of it over here but nothing like that we're earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven so i'm returning back to my house my eternal house see if our home is eternal it always existed in the thoughts of god now let's get to this returning to pentecost now i'm going to pull up a little note i had here i had some thoughts uh okay there we go now this is this quote this is from the chapter one i'm sorry chapter three of the ephesian church of the church age book he that hath and near let him hear what the spirit saith the churches now we know the scripture joel 2 already says we've got to return to pentecost i'll restore how tragic it is that the first aid did not listen to the spirit instead of listen to man the church let's stop right there lord willing i'm going to be preaching on the seven church ages again short a short series because i've already preached 120 on it but i wrote that chapter and i want to preach it because there's things in there we have to understand when god speaks to the church age he's speaking to the true vine and the false vine that's what my man's talking about never think that a bride member can fall away a bride member can't because satan's sealed out and god is sealed in amen so when brother man says that like the church you know didn't listen to man he's not talking about the bride the bride doesn't listen to man the bride listens to jesus amen because she's married to him paul said in romans 7 you've died to the law of the flesh be married unto christ amen they were already married right so this is not speaking to the bride but thank god the last age will be a group rise up the true right last day and she will listen to the holy spirit and church brother said if you've got the holy spirit it can only point to the word of god amen amen amen i don't know that's why all these quotes from brother brahm they're great but you got to find which scripture is that talking about and then when you find that then you've got a vision amen then you can ride with that vision hallelujah that's right in the day of that's what we're seeing today gross darkness the light will return by pure word and we will return to the power of pentecost see that to welcome back the lord jesus christ amen a church it is getting gross dark all the time you see out there in california this week there they threaten more churches where they can't assemble now and now multiple pastors are going to court this week may even face jail time and these aren't even bride churches thank god that they're standing no doubt they're foolish virgins but thank god and church we god is just letting us see what's going to come we're just seeing a very small thing and these men of god are these men of god by god's grace they're standing up for their rights but wait till it comes to us we got to be ready church we got to pray for them god help them i watched a video this week i'm a man he's in the 70s he's crying he said we've look at all of our church buses we've we've busted into 1 million 500 children and now the over the 20 years of our ministry and now they're telling us we can't we can't even have sunday school we can't do all these things he said give us our rights back let us worship and he said his grandchildren are crying because they know grandpa's going to go to jail that's in america that's not in iran that's in america see how it's getting a lot closer to home now but see how it's just slowly it's like birth pains and i saw some birth things this week they get real hard and uh get harder they're getting closer right it's getting closer it's starting to get closer now to the u.s that's california and you see i saw this week today too these are black lives matters organization they they now they now they're walking through through suburbs at 3am and saying get out of your houses give them to us and give them to the they're just we're waking people up they're doing all kinds of evil things i saw a video today they they go up where people are eating outside of the diner and they'll say raise your fist to black live matters and get on your knee and people are just like they're they're surrounded there's a crowd of like a hundred people like saying raise your fist to black life matters and they're just and they're getting right in their face like this far away and they're eating and they got their masks on and doesn't that remind you of the riots when they're banging on lot's door see how close people are to getting to be this violent uh this violent mob see how close we are this is in america if we can see the gross darkness well then for sure we can see the light amen amen if we can see the darkness thank god that the light shines brighter in darkness amen our way of life our bible way of life is more clear it's more right it's more true than ever before amen as time goes on sister beatrice is going to get more clear that right brother amen because the darker it gets the brighter light shines although there's fewer lights there's still going to be bright they're still going to light this place up amen see as there as the darkness the light will return by the pure word and return to the power of pentecost to welcome back the lord jesus christ i'm so glad to be on god's side uh is trump and pence our saviors absolutely not but the bible says we should pray for them is that right i prayed for obama i didn't like it because of his decisions yeah george w bush i probably didn't care much about it at that time but see the bible says we should still pray we should still plead with god to help sinners repent and come to god amen this is the greatest country on earth church thank god for the liberties that we had this age started just after the turn of the 20th century now going back to azusa street in 1906 as it was to be the age in which the true church would return to being the bride she was at pentecost we know that there must be of necessity a return of dynamic power praise god and so they started the last time i looked at the uh the documentary of azusa street brother amen they were praying five to eight hours a day so they would take turns you know some people go to work and when they had a day off the the brothers or sisters would pray five to eight hours a day and that's when god restored all the gifts and when it first fell it was it was perfect there every time there was interpretation every prophecy there was a thus saith the lord and it happened everybody they prayed for got well it was the real power of god because god loves a sincere heart amen amen so see they knew oh this is the last time there's got to be a return so they prayed for it but see god knew there had to come a brother branham praise god that three years later god knew there had to come a perry green praise god hallelujah god knew there had to come up brother isaiah brooks and a donny reagan and now you and i praise god god knew there had to become more believers so they patiently ran the race there some of them are still running praise god and they're they're staying with the vision and they're being faithful until it's the appointed time of the rapture thank god now church this is what i said before just bear with me we are a book of acts church do we baptize the same way they baptize yes do we get the holy ghost the same way they get it yes do we have miraculous miracles yes we've just heard them this last few months with our testimonies are they as dynamic maybe not like we're walking on water like jesus right turning wine uh water to wine you know we're never gonna match jesus right but church we've seen great things and we're thankful for that but we realize before the rapture we gotta return to the fullness of pentecost praise god amen and remember they had one heart they had one soul they had one mind now say like this they had one bank account now that's gonna be the hard part for some of us not that we ever would do that you know like end our bank accounts but in other words we have to be so generous we just listen to we just have to have a heart for other people i was thankful a few weeks ago remember i said if anybody has a need let me know i was thankful somebody emailed me and i was able to meet that need that's what i want i just want if there's something i can do to help out our people our little flock if i see a little sheep out there that need something i want to give it to them praise god that's that we need to have a heart like that praise god and the people abuse the system god will straighten them out don't you think god will the only thing god anoint me with some discernment if i if somebody's off the word and i'm really praying about it sure yeah don't i believe so and even if even if i get used then i'm just like jesus praise god because jesus was used and he still prayed for them he said father forgive them they don't know what they're doing see so we got to see now we are so much like the book of acts right we don't mess with these denominations all right we just we just fellowship with the saints and we're so scattered of brothers not many of us we're a dying breed as far as numbers but we're alive with the power of god amen but look like we're dying but we just started living praise god our numbers are shrinking but our power's growing our faith is growing our love for jesus is growing amen yes it is thank the lord there's a whole lot of things i'm going to get to lord willing wednesday i had a list here about 20 things i only got to maybe about five of them remember this is the state of the lord church oh sorry this is a sermon this is from the notes about four years ago when i preach this what about the true seat brother i said the false seed is being bound together in economical groups the true seed though happened just as we said the people of god are being made ready see i'm just each service i get a little more ready for god to come right do you i hope so by the word of the truth from the messenger of this age glory in her will be the fullness of pentecost for the spirit will bring the people right back to where they were at the beginning that is thus saith the lord amen amen and because that's what joel 2 says thus saith the lord now we don't know exactly what that means does that mean when we see somebody paralyzed we'll speak to them it may be we'll have something happen though no doubt about that we'll have the faith of that praise god because let me just say like this remember church like my mom being healed of cancer she wasn't hoping on that she had faith in other words god woke up her friend and said go tell ruby this scripture she's going to be healed like that was in other words god made the miracle happen amen and if god does miracles in our ministry he'll get the glory we won't get the glory it's not something we'll work ourselves into god will give it by his grace amen and the only way we can fail is to deny it and and have unbelief because the bible said they did not have many works because they're unbelief so we just got to get out all the unbelief and just say god we believe amen that's right in other words nobody's going to glory in the presence of the lord you and i can't force miracles to happen you and i can't do those things but we can be prepared we can be made ready so when god wants to move we're the vessels that he chooses that's right i was thinking about that all these testimonies where god did things it was god chose to do it who's going to brag and say well it was all me you have no power of your own right now remember all the symbols reign is the refreshing of the holy spirit yeah that's that's what we looked at brother amen remember when we did that bible study yeah oil is the holy spirit the joy of the holy spirit i'm sorry oil's the bats the holy spirit wine is the joy of it because you know stimulation isn't in the bible how many know that bible rap said oil is a stimulation well if you tell somebody stimulation they're not going to know what that means in the bible but the bible says the joy of the lord is your strength amen praise god see that joy is the actual word i think that would be the best bible word for simulation wheat of course is what you eat the bread and then restore i'll restore saith the lord now here's where we get uh now notice verse 25 joel 2 25 why we need a restoration that antichrist spirit has eaten all but the root and bit of the stem now we're told all these insects are the one the same in different stages that's right they're antichrist spirit mystery of iniquity uh manifested in organization denomination and false doctrine through the ages now look that antichrist spirit is gonna it's gonna kill the the supernatural working of god and church don't sometimes don't you feel it working on you we're just trying to get you just to get comfortable in laodicea we've got to just knock that insect off praise god get off my branch right my wife pays our children to pick off caterpillars off of our our plants in the summertime right and the japanese beetles we just don't let i mean on our precious blueberries do you think we let those uh japanese beetles just take all of our fruits away no no we got the power if you we paint what a nickel a piece you pick off the japanese bead and throw it in the soapy water right was it location that did it we're not gonna let our pressure we're not gonna let this this this plant die we want to enjoy the fruits of this and god is saying the same thing he's going to enjoy the fruits of his bride tree amen hallelujah praise god what kind of what kind of farmer would you be to plant do all that work plant in those bushes let the devils eat away on it shake yourself up praise god get up and go to work amen yeah we you and i have to know that part of the battle is knocking off all the devils off getting them under our feet so that we can grow and become the real church of god amen he's got to knock it off poor that poor little look how god thinks of us we're just a poor little root and the stock is going to be restored god isn't going to plant a new church he's going to bring that original plant back to the original seed in other words brother said another branch out of the same root amen the same we're part of the same church same bride amen same holy ghost still believers we're just a continuation we're a fresh branch of the holy root he's doing it by what the teaching or the former reign next will come the harvest rain or rapturing faith that's thus saith the lord you know that oil types of spirit i'm going to skip that now let's look at a few quotes so church i believe mechanics and dynamics and i sent this one to amen this morning because we were he and i were talking about it so if we talk about something and i get a scripture i'll share with you too uh give ear o ye heavens and i will speak and hear o earth the words of my mouth my doctrine shall drop as the rain amen now doctrine is instruction and instruction is the order so people always wonder what is a what's doctrine order it's ordering you and i to do something and a lot of people that's why a lot of people don't like doctrine they don't want anybody telling them what to do but really if you're a christian you know it's not the preacher it's the word but look what god but see if you got the right heart god's doctrine god's instruction is like freshness of rain in other words you say oh now i know what to do praise god amen because now the order of the doctrine has told me this is what i must do that's doctrine and the bible calls it an anointing amen it's former rain hallelujah it's an anointing of orders god has to give the seed this first anointing of order so the bride knows what to do with the word amen amen see a lot of people don't like to be told what to do they just want to live their lazy lives right and just let things happen and let things go but that's not how we're supposed to live i got some quotes maybe i'm going to share on wednesday i'm sorry sunday brother branham said where is our george washington's he said where is our patrick henry's he said man that stood up for truth no matter the costs praise god that's what we need today don't we we need some men and women that stand up for the word no matter the cost all those men put their lives on the line so that's what i'm saying with this coming to california that's just shutting down the church what about when the holy ghost falls and they want to kill us right they're just trying to shut the doors see we got to be able to put we got to i'll say like this god's going to really squeeze out our true colors right vernon said when trials come it shows what you're really made of well we're going to see real quick hopefully in the next ten minute i mean five ten years whatever one year we'll see we're gonna see what we're made of right that's right so see doctrine this is the former rain that's why i believe the former rain is the mechanics ladder rain is dynamics okay so my speech is like the dew so when you hear god's word it says pray like this pray for the sick like this prophesy like this right set your morning like this act like this in the church sing your songs like this right whenever we get an order it's like fresh dew right it's refreshing it's like the rain oh now i know how to now i know how to preach and i know how to lead psalms right now i know how to pray for the sick now i know how to treat my children see it's freshness right and if you don't feel that way it's time we got the same forgive me lord it's like showers doctrine is like showers it's refreshing oh thank you lord now i know how to direct my life now i know the decisions i have to make now brother and starts comparing the former ladder rain to mechanics and dynamics like a car right now if anybody knows about cars who is dad because i know he works and bang bang works on a lot of cars he has ever since i met that guy he's been working on cars now let me ask you how much can the car run if just a few mechanics are off how much can they run by man you act you actually work a lot on cars too didn't you a little bit if your brakes are off and your mechanics are off you're going to get very far i mean all the other mechanics can be my everything's good to go got one brake line off one mechanic see people get oh i see too much mechanics too much mechanics mechanics are like rain it's like refreshing oh everything's getting in order the church is finally acting like the church hallelujah i'll tell you we had one mechanic go wrong this summer sister beatrice guess which mechanic it was the air conditioner did that how did that make us do that make us want to enjoy the dynamics very much not when it was 90 degrees out there my kids are like turn on the daddy can we leave you know i'm out talking the parking lot after church like daddy can we leave we're sweating like pigs in here one mechanic was off and nobody wanted deny me dynamics they want to get out of the dynamics see church see what this you see what we're saying people look down on the mechanics without the mechanics you ain't getting nowhere praise god without this word without a life that's pleasing to god we're not getting one inch off the ground for the rapture but with the dynamics we'll meet christ in the air amen hallelujah that's why we got to be patient lord if this mechanic is out as out of my life is out of order let me fix it lord amen i love this illustration donnie reagan he said we were astronauts right and he said before an astronaut takes off they got to sit there and just make sure check this gauge you ever seen that you ever seen the pictures there's like a million gauges and all the other pentecostals are flying in their planes we got the astronauts sitting there check check check check and he's saying that's what we're doing we're astronauts we're making all the checks they're flying here there oh but when all the checks are made when all the mechanics are made we're gonna get some dynamics amen and we'll fly way past all the pentecostal planes which i thank god for the plane rides i've been in praise god i thank god for the people sister beatrice i prayed for and they got healed thank god for those pentecostal plane rides i love flying up there amen but when it comes down to the rapture we got to sit in the shuttle praise god and make sure every no every knob every mechanic is ready and then when the appointed time comes it's going to be three two one take off i praise god so astronauts spend a lot of time in the cockpit just checking off all their other knobs and all their mechanics praise god but they can go so much higher hallelujah and you know what happens with one thing off one seal can kill all the astronauts if one seals off if one person's not born again they'll explode they'll never make it to space let me say something too this uniting time see the churches you nations uniting together it's uniting time of god and this bride and i say this with reverence and respect i believe the bride of christ is called i believe she's sealed the kingdom of god i believe the mechanics is there they're waiting for the dynamics that'll take her off the earth in the glory and the rapture i believe with all my heart yes sir we don't know how he's going to do it but he shall do it he is the dynamics now church let's just be honest this was 63 so that's what almost 50 some years ago 57 years ago so obviously we still need some more dyna i'm sorry some more mechanics right if the dynamics haven't come yet and everybody we know that we think's bride is still here then we must be still waiting on some mechanics praise god see what i'm saying see how there's people that got to get their lives in order before the rapture that makes me love god more that god would wait with somebody 10 20 30 40 50 years to repent praise god he's willing to wait for them to get their mechanics in order so they can he can give them the dynamics oh god is so good praise god we just become members of the machine of his body forming ourself into his image and see him uniting himself with us now just think just within the last two years these guys got the holy ghost they got in the body before that they weren't in the body when i was being raised i wasn't in the body it took until 2003 i finally found my part in the body so the body's can you imagine the body's like not complete the body of jesus still needs more people in it it ain't going to be raptured until it gets every everybody in place praise god and then when everybody gets in place she's going up to meet the lord amen amen so let's let's be thankful the body's getting done people are getting in the body of christ amen see and we see him uniting himself with us in his works with his love gifts and he hands them to us just before the wedding supper and we're waiting watching for that their big church is to be united the dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the holy ghost that we have worked in a small measure while the headstone is coming down to unite with the body now i've said this before scripturally you can't get the holy ghost twice in your soul so for those of us who already got the holy ghost this has to be a refilling right here amen oh that means all of our thoughts are not on jesus all the time like when you first got saved you got the holy ghost right and then you know you have battles and you start stop thinking we stop meditating on the lord all the time like when you got the holy ghost it was all message all word all the time and then we just have battles right but he says he says the dynamics will be a refilling of the holy spirit praise god those that don't have it they get it in their soul those of us that already got it we finally get our minds back to the transformed condition they need to be in amen praise god but when that head and the body unites together i never set my timer i know it's getting late here let me give me a few minutes here okay give me 10 minutes the full power of the holy ghost should raise you up just exactly like that even the dead that's dead in christ for hundreds of years ago will raise the beauty of his holiness and take a flight to the skies the dynamics is the holy spirit that lines up perfectly with former rain and ladder rain we're waiting on this ladder rain this final anointing of the holy spirit okay i for uh same quote i just for i just didn't delete it now brother adam says in another way he calls it he calls the ladder rain another surge of the holy spirit he says that's the outstanding scripture he so he's preaching the token right now i'm going to skip down he just says talking about his sermon i'm looking for a time of a break forth of the spirit of god in these last days that we're now living in for another surge of the holy spirit into the church for a rapturing faith just before it comes and everything is sitting right in order for that and i believe that we're now the time when the word should have preeminence and i believe that that the time to lay aside our creeds and our thoughts and come back to the word i believe it's still that time now here's a good quote brother man says we're coming in the third poll and he talks about how many you can feel that he's just in a prayer line how many you can feel that something's happened in you since you've had hands laid on you there it is this is what we waited for this is just starting to bloom now i did this for a purpose i did this for a purpose i'm working or something i'm taking charge of faith and going right back to begin and come in to kind of raise faith in a bracket where you've noticed never noticed it that way before not a faith but a perfect faith build it up in here and watch a perfect god with a perfect heart keep a perfect promise by his perfect word which is sharper than a two-edged sword discern of the thoughts and tents of the heart see what we're coming now to the perfection because the people has to come to this in order for the rapture that's what's holding it away right now is waiting for that church to come in that perfect raptured faith remember there's a point of time for that right so in other words if you're a part of the bride and i'm part of the bride you can't get it without me getting it we're all gonna get it praise god amen right looking for it it means here's why i brought this it means a lot of shaving down for me it means a lot for you but together we'll make it by the grace of god amen remember the third poll is just jesus's ministry right it's it's jesus ministry brother branham continued first poll signing the hand actually actually is i think it was on his left hand right he took the people but i can't remember chan it was maybe his right hand he would see the dots and that would tell him what the the sickness was the second poll was discerning of the thoughts and tense of the heart visions the third pole was the spoken word amen and jesus had the same thing first poll second poll third poll and so that's what we're looking for we're looking for the power of the spoken word praise god that's what they had the day of pentecost he said whatsoever i have a gift of you rise and walk in the name of jesus christ praise god spoken word power he said i don't have silver and gold see how god's got to get our money and finances lower we have silver and gold such as i don't have silver gold such as i have i give unto you the spoken word amen the fullness of pentecost will be in the bride but brother ram said the rapture message this is he died on the 24th so this was 20 days before he died to the church the bride the rapture is a revelation to her it's revealed to her the revelation the true bride of christ will be waiting for the revelation the rapture that's what we're waiting for now while i'm waiting i'm getting shaved down brother amen i'm like a sheep i'm waiting for this great revelation but the whole time god is shaving me down he's taking off all my all my wool that i let grow i shouldn't let grow i should keep i should actually keep it shaved right but i got extra weight i got to get rid of so i can go on the rapture right and so i'm just as i'm waiting for that final revelation i'm getting shaved down right all this wool getting shaved off me right waiting for that last revelation praise god waiting for that now it's a revelation for revelation his faith remember simon talked about that he had a good thought never thought about that before i've always just said they're one and the same because that might be right i don't know i have to study that out you cannot have a revelation without it being faith faith is a revelation because it's something that's revealed to you faith is a revelation faith is something that's been revealed to you because faith means assurance so if you're sure of something it's because god has shown it to you right god gave you a promise you're sure of it like it was with abraham that could cause anything contrary to what had been revealed to him as though it wasn't so now faith that's what faith is the revelation of god the church is built upon a revelation the whole entire body amen praise god now i brought these quotes from a sermon i preached back i think in 2015. this is what i was saying earlier none of us can none of us can create the rapture on our own in other words it has to be in god's appointed time just like none of us can do divine healing at our and our will works is faith expressed now if you can't come he said wave your hand like that so they can pack you up to the prayer line now look you people i suppose you had to come early because i told him early now if you don't have a prayer see you don't have a prayer card if you've got faith like that if you've got that faith like i taught see if it's revealed to you all right if it isn't revealed no matter if you've been in a dozen prayer lines it wouldn't help a bit you know that okay so let me just get back to this and remind us how the same attitude we have toward divine healing is the same one for the rapture we've got to wait until god gives us the revelation of the rapture just like we have to wait until god shows us a miracle right or till god tells us to speak the word amen so you could go in a dozen prayer lines but if god never reveals to you that you're going to be healed it's not going to do you any good see i might pray i could do all i could i could get down on my knees that's this is what we do right we try getting on our knees right we try laying hands on people which is good that's what we're supposed to do anoint you with oil any way you wanted to and pray until god by grace reveals that in your heart that it's over then it's done you don't even have to be in the line or nowhere it's done anyhow so i was thinking about who is dad i'm not sure if any of us ever got the revelation beforehand like i spoke the word right i spoke to the word because i felt inspired but i still had mind battles from time to time i just said keep speaking live keep speaking live remember that i'm not sure if it struck bang i'm not sure when it struck we were just doing the best we could right and god eventually did a miracle and a whole church gathered to acknowledge that it was great to be there praise god because god gets all the glory see so whoever got the revelation it was god's grace right i know i felt i was going to show this i know i felt inspired on that sunday when i was preaching on the book of philippians and the prayer class i know i felt inspired i ran into my office i couldn't find it and jose said i got one right in my bible from brother branham so i think i left that one with the the boy at the hospital up and after i think i left my brother-man prayer cloth there but see i was searching for i thought well let's try that maybe that maybe that's god's way to do it and brother bang said he took that prayer cloth laid it on his dad took it back and i got another one right in my office now he said two days later he woke up so i'm not sure when it i'm not even sure bang got the full revelation but see we just all we did we just acted upon god's word we knew god could do it that's faith we know he can now we didn't know when he would but we kept speaking god's word trusting him to do it and he did it praise god amen see so is but i can't say like brother amen i i couldn't say thus saith the lord but all i could do is just with my little faith that i had to just speak the word and see if god will do it there's only been a couple times in my whole life brother amen where i prayed for somebody and i really knew they were going to get healed just a couple times and even then the the devil comes and battles you right like are you sure about that what if you're wrong that's what he always tells me what if you're wrong what if you miss i just got like shut up you know i'm gonna go do something i'll study or something like that here i'll go let me go pray you just gotta tell me shut up right yes i'm get thee behind me devil praise god amen get me behind me you're on a fence unto jesus amen like the one time sister lisa came up for prayer she was at home and john was there at the other church at waterloo she just had a miscarriage and she said i want to be healed so i can have a baby church she she was on the phone she i had my cell phone up here and i was preaching to her she hung up she drove 30 minutes up to our church up there in waterloo and came up to the altar weeping and crying and i prayed for right there and i said it out loud i wonder if i got the recording i said god heard us tonight she won another baby it wasn't long after that maybe 10 or 11 months later she had been another baby i forget which one it was maybe hannah or i can't remember which one it was not maybe not hannah maybe the one after him i'm sorry i can't remember but that was one time i i remember i really believed god heard our prayer so what am i saying a lot of times church we're just acting on what we know is true and looking to see if god does it and church there's nothing wrong with that that's what we should do right because at least we're acting on some faith right that's right and what i love about with with who is dead god honored our little he said if you just got a grain of faith it can move mountains praise god if you've got faith like a mustard seed we had enough faith right to speak the word like a mustard seed we had enough faith to go put the prayer cloth right there and have bango do it and god honored that little mustard seed of faith hallelujah i don't have enough faith to say oh i know it's going to happen i don't have enough faith to do that but enough faith to pray for the sick see until god reveals it in your heart the man says if you don't have revelation yet just keep speaking lives i'm going to skip ahead he said these people got prayer cards but that don't mean they're going to be healed all depends on their faith in god he said no matter how religious you are good or bad unless the grace of god see drops in the heart you'll never get well that's why but amen the rapture is going to be god's grace to us amen it's not because we're better than anybody it's going to be a grace of god because he revealed it to us because we desired it praise god and we did everything we could do to forsake the gross darkness and walk in the light praise god because he's got it he's got to work with our our human will he can't force us but he's got to work with our human choices and our free more agency and yet his desire to bring his word to pass he's got to find some middle of the road praise god where we finally get our we finally say okay i'm done with this world i want to go to heaven in the rapture amen and when we get to that point then the latter rain will fall praise god amen by his grace amen i'll say that if we live to see it we might get old but amen we might have gray hair pretty soon i was picturing you with gray hair singing i love that guy you know maybe it'll be that long i don't know how long it's going to be but we got to run the race with patience praise god amen it'll happen just wait it's like rapture is going to happen right i think it's the last one let's stand here i got a couple more jesus said if you could believe it it would happen if you can't believe it it won't happen see we got to at least have a little grain of mustard seed i know god can heal who is dead i know it i just believe it i don't know for sure but i believe he can do it so i can't make you believe neither can you make yourself believe oh i'm going to really work my way into the rapture today you can't do it you are going to struggle you are going to fall flat see we're depending on god we're just gonna yield ourselves we gotta do the best we can with our free more agency get shaved out as much as we can and let god's grace bring it to us because he said he would give us the desire of our hearts not your faith god's faith hallelujah your intellectual faith might be believe it fine but unless the faith of god is on your heart see just keep believing it with all your heart until god does reveal it to you just keep believing it until god does reveal it so receiving faith for divine healing is a gift it's not a labor or human effort faith is a revelation from god now faith is revelations that's where i want to stay there just a moment it's a revelation he has revealed it to you by his grace it's nothing you did you didn't work yourself up into faith you ever have faith it's given to you by the grace of god and god reveals it to you therefore faith is a revelation and the whole church of god is built upon revelation the church said amen let's have the musicians come here i just want to bring that out again church that we are looking for a rapture our job is to keep ourselves clean keep all of our growth our our sinful growth shaved off keep shaved keep clean and then in god's appointed time he'll
