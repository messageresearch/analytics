word by the grace of god good to be back in the house of the lord as we kind of finish up the little meetings here um just uh grateful to have had the chance to be here and it's been a real blessing to me to be able to fellowship and just uh enjoy the word i guess even up here you enjoy the word you know the word's always good no matter where you are amen let's just turn if we can to second peter chapter one and we'll read verses 8 through 15. lord willing will try not to keep you long i always say that but it seemed like yesterday was i said that that seemed like the longest longest minister so we'll try not to wear you out but we'll just see what the lord would have for us this morning now second peter chapter one and we'll read verses eight through 15. it says for if these things be in you and abound they make that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ but he that lack at these things is blind and cannot see afar off and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things ye shall never fall for someone entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our lord and savior jesus christ wherefore i will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though ye know them and be established in the present truth yea i think it meet as long as i am in this tabernacle to stir you up by putting you in remembrance knowing that shortly i must put off this my tabernacle even as our lord jesus christ hath showed me moreover i will endeavor that he may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance for we have not followed cunningly devised fables when we made known unto you the power and coming of our lord jesus christ but we're eyewitnesses of his majesty amen let's bow our heads in a word of prayer heavenly father lord we just come here for this last service that you've ordained for this period of fellowship together lord we ask that you would just be with us once more lord as we hear in the scriptures lord just once more lord may just come amongst your people and speak to us this morning may anoint me as the speaker lord to just speak the the words that you would have for your people anoint the ears and hearts of the here lord to receive your word lord jesus and may it be a benefit to your children and to your bride lord we just pray right now in the name of the lord jesus christ that you would guide and direct us in all things get glory to yourself lord jesus we've come to lift you up father you said if we would lift you up that you would draw all men unto you father and we've come to lift up the name of jesus christ this morning we love you lord we ask that your perfect will and the way would be done in our lives may we just get ourselves out of the way and let your spirits speak to us this morning in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen you may be seated so this morning kind of want to just kind of continue in a kind of similar line as we mentioned yesterday uh we speaking on opening the channels and just maybe just a really quick recap of how we were how we've kind of been speaking this whole time about how the lord in the believers in this hour is desiring to express the life that he put in the believer he's he's designed to express that out through you as the believer it's not just for a minister it's not just for a prophet or something that we put on a pedestal but it's actually for the believer as we even spoke in the scriptures when when peter would walk through the streets and he seen the the one that was lame and he said silver and gold have by none but such as i have there is something that the believer possessed that they can offer to to people that have need if that remember that contrast we talked about and then bringing it yesterday by god's grace and talking about opening up the channels all these different avenues that god is desiring to express himself in and to to allow himself to to influence the believer through the sight and through the the taste and the conscience and all these different things that we talked about and how the devil tries to clog those things up and gum them all up and we need to take faith in the word to allow the lord and the holy ghost with the fire of the power of the holy ghost to clean all those channels out so that way god can express himself because he's put something in you that he wants to show it's not it's not just we're not just oh we've just arrived here and we're just bumps on a log but god has a purpose for your life god has a work for you to do you know the devil will be right there to tell you oh this is insignificant or this is this or this is that but no matter how small it may seem you know it's just like a watch you know if you take out one little gear or one little spring from that watch they won't tell time anymore so is it with the body of christ that every little piece is important every little bit is important i tell you what you know we look at the body even just in the natural body and someone would say oh well maybe your your pinky toe doesn't seem so important you know what but i tell you what i don't think any of us would just willingly give up our pinky toe it's part of our body that's me that's that part of me and so is it with god's body the bride of jesus christ his his body in this hour he wants every part in its place every part performing the work that it has every little bit has a part to play and so what the devil does is he's always trying to hinder that body you know he's always trying to take it and and pervert it somehow and distort it and make it so it's not fruitful make it so the body can't work the way it ought to but it but we believe we've got the victory in the lord jesus christ amen so this this morning what we really want to focus on is if i could give a title for the service this morning would be i will remember i will remember and as we read in the scriptures here you know peter talking about these things he said if you lack these things you're blind you can't see it far off we understand if we go back he's talking about the statue of a perfect man and all these attributes and and all those attributes wrapped up in the holy ghost because it all comes to to a capstone of perfect love and perfect love has it in all of these attributes so if if that be in you and a pound we find you're not going to be unfruitful but if we find we're struggling then sometimes we forget what god has done for us and it's amazing he says how much is he in just these few scriptures how peter keeps really telling as he's writing this epistle out he says i want to keep you in remembrance he says i want to keep you in remembrance he says in verse 12 he says i'm not going to be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things and i love what he says here though you know them so as we're talking this morning this isn't going to be anything maybe brand new or or groundbreaking or anything you say oh my goodness this is just to the intellectual mind it might not be stimulating but even as peter said i want to put you in remembrance of these things even though you already know them he said but i'm going to stir up your minds your pure minds by way of remembrance and he says i'm going to put you in remembrance i'm going to stir you up by remembrance he keeps mentioning these things i'm going to bring you into reference verse 13. i'm going to stir you up by putting you in remembrance moreover i will endeavor that after my decease you'll have these things in remembrance so what is he trying to say he says don't forget these things don't put these things out of your mind don't let the devil steal these things from you and as we're going kind of tying this into what we were ministering yesterday you know kind of by the grace of the lord we mentioned we wanted to focus on that part of memory today and that's what we really want to focus on that avenue of memory because in this day and age it seems like that's such a powerful sense in our spirit that the devil uses and remember he's very crafty he takes all of these different senses that you have and he weaves them together to try to paint you a picture of something that's not true so he's gonna take these senses of of memory and many times he'll bring back things in your life mistakes that you've made problems that you've had and all of a sudden what does he do he ties that he doesn't leave it there it's not just enough for you to remember but he wants to make you unfruitful he wants to clog up all those channels right so what does he do he takes these memories and different things that you may have had problems with and now what does he do it's not just memory now he runs over the conscience and i says oh you remember that time that this happened well because of that you should feel guilty you should feel so guilty that you can't you can't do anything for god how could you possibly do that don't you remember that and now he's laying on your conscience and all of a sudden your conscience is down and all of a sudden now now your affections become become kind of distorted because you start you start maybe getting depressed and you start getting down and all of a sudden it starts to affect even the natural senses and we take it to a spiritual place but where now your eyesight seems to kind of cloud over because you're so busy looking at the past you can't see what's in front of you there's a reason when you're driving a car that that that rear view mirror is really small but your windshield's really big it because we've got to focus on what lays ahead and not what's behind but what does the devil do he put your focus on that if you drove down the road in your car just staring at that rear view mirror you're going to get in an accident sure enough and that's what the devil does he starts tying these things together pretty soon your ego vision starts to get filmed over a little bit and then what what is that well as we spoke yesterday when these senses begin to get dulled what if it's a sign of sickness it's a sign that something's wrong somewhere if you can't see who you are that's what peter would say he said if you lack these things you you're blind and you can't see it far off to the point you forget that you were even saved at some point and i think there have been moments if we're all honest with ourselves there's been moments the devil's caught just about caught all of us probably in that place when we're down in despair you know we're human we have our struggles we have trials the devil's always there battering against you every day and sometimes he gets you down just starts kicking on it he just starts kicking you he starts kicking you and then what if he's not going to let up but there's got to be something in there's something in the belief there is something that's just there got to be there is something in the believer where that there's some that holy ghost raises up and says i will remember i'm gonna keep these things in remembrance i'm not gonna let it fall for me i i'm not gonna i'm not gonna just focus on the failures see because there's two sides to all these things so one of the first things that that we do is the devil brings up this memory it's such a powerful thing you notice in this day and age memory is one of the biggest tools even in the worldly realm memory is such a huge thing because we even see it in the political realm and in the societal realm and all these things now that you got twitter and facebook and all these things what is what do they do it's just a natural type of the spiritual when all of a sudden someone that was accepted in society they go back 15 years out of their facebook page or however long it was for their little twitter feed and they dig up a little tweet that they said 10 years ago then pretty soon the whole world just jumps on them that's what the devil does to the believer is he goes into your past he starts rooting around and tries to pull up something that says oh look at this and everything jumps on and starts kicking him down and pretty soon someone that might have even been accepted by the world gets cast out and ostracized it's amazing isn't it and that's what the devil's doing it's just a natural type of the spiritual of the condition of the people there's no love there's no forgiveness and what happens is we allow that to affect us in a spiritual way many times we get stuck we can't forgive others we can't even forgive ourselves because that like uh david i believe said in psalm 51 he said my sin is ever before my face you know if we're not careful we'll get stuck in that position the word where your sins just always before you and it's just constantly oh i'm just a failure i'm this and you've forgotten that you were purged you've forgotten the blood of jesus christ so what's the first thing with this memory is the devil starts there's it's like a positive and a negative version the positive version and i don't mean positive as in good i mean as in adding something to it is that what does the devil do he starts bringing up memories of the past he starts bringing up things that you've had issues with a brother or sister or just little things that you struggled with or places where you stumbled and fell because we've all stumbled and fallen we've all sinned and come short of the glory of god brother branham said we backslide every day every day we we have to ask forgiveness thank the lord for the blood of jesus christ i thank the lord and we even had brother bran with the vision where he was condemning that woman in the little restaurant or wherever it was i had a bit of a gassy i can't remember what it was but and then the lord has to take him back and show him that vision of that blood ring that that that protecting power that keeps the believer that even keeps that woman and gives her a chance and if we're not careful we lose sight of that so what the devil does is he starts bringing up these scarecrows from your past now i want you to think because it's a powerful thing and it happens you can look all through the scriptures i want you to think about adam and eve think about the guilt think about the power of memory that the devil would have had to try to attack adam and eve from the garden of eden could you imagine living eight nine hundred years seeing all the great great great grandchildren how many other greats it was coming up oh grandpa adam how was it what was it like in the garden oh man oh my goodness oh man it was wonderful yeah we didn't have any problems i could speak to that tree you'd be like oh little enoch you don't even you don't even know i could speak to a tree and it would move my name you don't see that line over there yeah grandpa adam the lord allowed grandpa adam to name that line that's why you call it a lion right now and then maybe the little one says but grandpa adam what happened and could you imagine the memories that fight in that channel of memory that they would have had to think back and say oh we lost it all we made a mistake grandma eve what happened i let the serpent get to me i didn't believe god's word and god kicked us out of the garden and now there's a flaming sword turning every which way to keep us from it could you imagine having to relive those memories having tasted of the good things of god in the garden of eden and then getting kicked out and having to live with those memories think about moses growing up knowing who he was he was raised to understand you are a deliverer this is who you are look at what look at this god put you here for a purpose raised for this purpose but then he has to live with the memory of just killing an egyptian of fleeing from the face of pharaoh after all of his successes after everything he thought was going to happen we've all been there i believe god gives you something say lord i'm gonna do this for your glory but we get out of the way we get our own ideas of it we fall fly on our face and we find ourselves running from the presence of god and he had to live with that memory of killing that egyptian and thinking about how he was rejected by his own brethren when he's trying to help them he's running from his own commission for 40 years in the desert just ignoring the call of god for his life what kind of what kind of memories don't you think when he was back there in the desert with those sheep and those quiet moments the devil was right there to say oh i thought you were a deliverer i thought i thought you were raised up to to deliver the children of israel what happened to you oh that's right there's a dead egyptian in the sand over there that you killed you're a failure you're nothing could you imagine and from a natural standpoint i'm sure moses at times would say yeah that seems to be right that sure seems to be right think about that think about joseph and all of his trials has betrayed by his own brothers the ones that you would think they love me they're my brothers cast into a pit sold into slavery no doubt the whole time you know even though he had no uh against himself there wasn't anything he did but what as a real believer you know even when we go through trials what's the first thing that happens lord what did i do you know because it's the desire of a believer to be right and many times we get before lord did i do something did i do is there something wrong no doubt joseph had to wonder what did i do to deserve this i wasn't trying i couldn't help that i was born a dreamer i couldn't help that that my father left me i didn't i didn't ask for this but those memories coming back throughout the devil trying to twist and distort oh you probably did this or you probably did that you know they have a scientific name for that it's called confabulation confabulation means you remember something that didn't actually happen you make up details and that that's what the devil gets us to do many times it's oh well you did something wrong over here and you thought well maybe that is right you start taking his words for it instead of getting down on your knees and getting before the lord and say lord you know i don't even know if that was the case but lord forgive me lord if i'd done any wrong let me lay it on the altar and get rid of it now so that there's nothing between us but no doubt joseph had to fight those battles he was a human we think our battles are something new no this has been going on since the fall and then to top it all off it seems like things are going okay and he ends up in potiphar's house and things need to oh well praise the lord things are kind of looking up i'm doing the best i can and then he's thrown back into jail thrown into jail for nothing and again don't you think the devil was right there and say yeah you know you did something you you know you know this you get you get paid back for all the stuff you did and joseph's praying like what what did i do but the devil's always right there to accuse he's the accuser of the brethren it's his job that's what he does but no doubt he had to question that no doubt he had the memories of thinking wow i remember i remember when the lord was giving me the dreams and showing me these things are going to happen i thought i thought these great things were going to happen but look at me down in a in a jail cell now think about david and the memories that he would have had just raised up to be king of israel all these wonderful things happen and then he goes with bathsheba and sins and on top of that commits murder don't you think that the devil was right there we know the devil was right there because the psalm 51 said my sins ever before me you know that you could you imagine that the torment that had to be there lord what have i done when nathan looked at him and said you're the man oh my you don't think the devil was right there trying to play on memory trying to bring it all back and hold him down absolutely he was and think about peter oh i love peter you think about peter imagine imagine put yourself in peter's shoes called of the lord to follow him recognize that but then think about the battles that he had to fight in between in between his betrayal in the in the resurrection and seeing the lord could you imagine the battles that peter had to face and even after that going to pentecost when when peter and we know he was a brash individual he wanted to get a head up he had a heart like a warrior he wanted to fight pulled out the sword and cut the ears off and just let's get him but then he then the lord says the the son of man will be betrayed and be crucified and peter says far be it from me o lord and he just imagine the one that he called the messiah looked right in peter's face and said get thee behind me satan you don't think and put yourself in those shoes if jesus christ looked at you and say get thee behind me satan could you imagine the guilt and the memory they had to follow peter around i imagine i imagine that there are probably whispers going around too i mean no doubt there had to be whispers i mean wasn't it so that jesus said i have chosen you 12 and one is the devil i wonder if when they heard that get the behind me saying i wonder if all said oh now we know now we know who it is oh my god that was fresh i never even thought about that before that wasn't that was the lord could you imagine you imagine the mind battles peter heard that had that i chosen you 12 when one of you is the devil and the lord says get thee behind me satan oh my goodness could you imagine the mind battles oh i i could i can't even imagine it to have your lord you said they said you are the lord thou art the christ the son of the living god declared it and to have the messiah look at you and say that and then on top of that come back and say lord i'll go with you wherever no you won't you'll deny me three times and then have it happen and then we know that satan played on his memory because as soon as the crew the third time it brought back to mind what the lord said and he went and wept bitterly why because he knew oh my you can't even imagine those my maps i can't and i've had we've all had a lot of light but i could not imagine that oh my think about paul paul greatest among the pharisees one of the greatest of all the pharaoh the pharisees and there he stands persecuting the church standing there at the stony of stephen causing many to blaspheme all these things happening and then the lord says why do you persecute me paul saw why why persecute his thou me it's hard for you to kick against the priests and the lord brings into that place but you don't doubt the devil was always there to accuse and we know that was the case because you can read through false epistles he says i'm the least of all the apostles who persecuted the church how how the devil was always there to accuse you know that's what that's the thing the devil does is he's right there to bring back up all your failures everything that you've done wrong he's more than more than willing more than willing to point you back to always point you back oh this is what you did this is why this is like this because you did that oh yeah the lord never forgave you with that don't you remember when he said this oh my i mean i can i'm just thinking still thinking about peter you imagine peter in those times when the lord jesus was crucified and died that had to be some agonizing days for peter oh my and no doubt there was probably gossip going on they weren't converted they weren't converted they were already fight no fighting with each other over who is the greatest in the kingdom they're already like whispering who is it that betrays you who's gonna betray him whispering one to another i wonder who it is and then to see peter called out like that not once but twice get thee behind me say no you're going to deny me three times oh you don't think the whispers were going around oh that had to be some agonizing days we've been through the i believe we've all been through some of those days sometimes when the devil's right there on your shoulder oh you you ain't no child of god how could you be a child of god that brother's up there preaching this your pastor's up there preaching that you know it was right for you you know he was just condemning you you know he's just and what is it now again the devil starts to weave his web now he takes those memories and he moves it right to reasoning he loves to use those two and those two are a lethal combination oh you know the reason why god can't do it is because of this thing you did in the past do you know the reason why you should have this guilty conscience is because this thing you did in the past do you know why you can't have love for your brothers and sisters it's because of this thing you did in the past the devil loves to bring that to your remembrance he loves to bring it back and just put it right before you like a big billboard and too many times as believers we fall for that we'll let the devil tell us the lies and we'll just take it because our reasoning he starts to work on that reason we're not our channels aren't clear we haven't taken the word in faith and cleared out that channel of reasoning to say devil the reason doesn't matter i put it under the blood devil this memory doesn't matter because just like paul said in philippians 3 13 and 14 he said i'm forgetting those things that are behind and i press towards the mark of the high calling in christ jesus so what did he do he said he had to forget those things that are behind so for with us we need to learn to forget our failures we've got to have the mind of christ and if the mind of christ who is god so eat the mind of god and if the mind of god can take these things and cast it into the sea of forgetfulness and we have the mind of christ that it behooves the believer to start filling up the sea of forgetfulness with all the failures with all the problems with all the issues that you've had and start casting them away stop looking in the rearview mirror stop looking at every one of your failures because like we spoke two nights ago it's not about my overcoming power i'm an overcomer because he overcame for me i'm not relying on my ability i'm relying on the lord jesus who already completed the work amen i just want to make myself available to put myself into the place where he can use me in the spot that he wants which it goes back to being in the part of being in the body just being in your position lord make me available lord let me be a prisoner to you let me be completely satisfied with who i am what you've made me what you've called me to do and let me whatever you put your hand to do it with all your might if the lord's called you to be a housewife be a housewife for god with all your might if he's called you to be a song leader brother amen and i see it that you do be a song leader with all your might he got brother bang back there in the computer brother is going to work that live stream and he's going to work the computer with all his mic why because it's a part of the body because it's a needful part you'd say oh no doubt that the devil might fight for the bank oh i'm just sitting back here on a computer not doing too much but if he wasn't what about all the ones on the live stream right now brother jesse who would desire to be here but can't and his family and different ones for whatever reason but god has a place for you to fulfill and no amount of the devil's bringing up memories can stop that except you allow it to hinder you and stop you in your tracks so that's the first thing he does the first thing the devil does with memory is in the positive sense is he digs up all the old things so what's the second thing he does so the devil likes to add to memory he likes to throw false memories in there a lot of times too oh did i do something wrong do that no sometimes trials are just trials sometimes trials just like job are meant for you to overcome sometimes god the lord jesus just wants to see how are you going to react let's let's put some tests to it so it's like uh it's like i know your brothers do like cnc's different things when those engineers make those parts they have to subject them to stress testing before they can put them on a machine because they got to make sure if i if i do it two millimeters too thin it's going to break when it's put under stress so what is the lord that's what he does with his people is he's holding you out he's shaping you he's molding you and every once in a while he's got to say okay i've i've done this little bit here let's put him to a test and make sure that this these things that i've been shaping are holding properly and sometimes you know what sometimes by the grace of god we pass the test and sometimes it seems like we crumble but you know what oh i say lord i just i want to be in the potter's hands lord if you got to break me down and mold me again that's fine i just want to be in your hands that's all i want amen so the first thing the devil does what does he do he brings up all those past thoughts the second thing he does is he makes us forget what god has done for you he makes us he's so what does he do he brings up all the negative and he makes us forget all the positives see there's nothing wrong remember all of these senses in particular right now we're talking about memory there's nothing wrong with them as long as they line up with the word they were they're meant to glorify god they're meant to to be part of the avenue which god can express himself we like to call we call it a testimony or a memory but what what is a memory of something that god has done for you and so what does he do he while he's busy pulling up scarecrows from the past he's sitting there like digging up holes and trying to shove in all the things that god has done for you he's like peter said he said you forget that you were purge of your own sins you start to forget that that there was one time you didn't even care about god and now you want to serve them with all your heart there was a time where you didn't even think about holiness or living holy and clean and now you you can't help but think about it almost all every day there's a quote i don't have here and i've been a lot of quotes and things but you can look them up and i'm paraphrasing but brother branham was talking about how the stress and different things in the life and how there's stress in your life and brother branham he's talking about everybody thinks stress is a horrible thing but stress is necessary without stress you wouldn't be able to live if there wasn't stress and tension in your body your muscles strength uh flexing and tension and ligaments and things holding intention holding things together you'd just be a big jelly ball if you didn't have stress in your life if there were molecular stresses holding this wood together it would just be it would be nothing and so is it with the believer see we think that when you become a believer and filled with the holy ghost that it's all easy street from there on out but brother branham says he says you'll have more stress in your life when you've received the holy ghost he said because there was one time you lived and you were just carefree now without many of us maybe struggled with certain things depression or something didn't feel like you were carefree but that was a personal selfish stuff when when the devil gets you in that place you're just saying oh what was me what was me i know because i've been there but you were just carefree you didn't think about it you know i die you know i just live my life you know i'll eat drink and be married for tomorrow we die i'm just gonna do what i want but then when you became a believer when the holy ghost came in and this word was revealed to you and you saw there's a life to be lived there's a standard that god has there's there's and then all of a sudden he puts a desire that holy ghost desire in your heart to live for him now there's stress because now one time you weren't thinking about god now you're thinking about god all the time and you're thinking about lord i want to live for you and my i want to i'm checking up all the time and what is it that will do he turns that against us he turns that that's a good kind of stress it's it's being there always aware always checking up lord i want to make sure i'm on the right path but if we're not careful we'll take it too far and the devil starts using that and now you start to forget you start focusing so much on it you start to forget what god did for you you start to completely forget what grace is anymore because we get so caught up in desires the proper desire the proper desire wrongfully executed is going to lead to nothing but pain your desire to live right before god executed in nothing but human ability will lead you to nothing but failure and depression and sadness and you'll you'll be in that spot where you'll forget that you were purged from your old sins like we read in galatians in a in the book of galatians he says what he said you started out in faith are you now made perfect by the wall no we're not we're made perfect by his grace he's perfecting the saints by his grace and by his word right now so what we got to do the devil is so busy doing that he starts to bury all those things and we understand there if you look even in the old testament especially how many times the lord speaks about bringing up a memorial i believe the stones on the ephod were a memorial before god and i'm just gonna we're not gonna take very long so i just give you these scriptures if you want to look them up but exodus chapter 12 verses 13 and 14 he's speaking of the passover he says this day shall be a memorial for you and for the children of israel forever for all your generations what was it it was to keep them remembering remember secret memory is good if it be applied properly all these things are good your conscience is good when it's the holy ghost pricking that conscience to get you away from sin amen affections are good when it's a holy affection striving to to get closer to god all these things are wonderful like we talked about imagination and how it has such a negative connotation but imagination is good if it's used in an inspiration of the holy ghost all these things are wonderful so god says you're going to keep the passover as a memorial for all your generations so you can remember what god did for you joshua chapter 4 when they're crossing the jordan and they step through and the jordan drives up and the lord tell let's turn there actually i like this one i like it all but i like this one a lot too joshua chapter four verses five through seven they're getting ready to step through the jordan to the other side into the promised land they're filing we're making our way finally it's been all these years in the wilderness and we're going over so what do they do it says and joshua said unto them passover passover before the ark of the lord your god into the midst of jordan and taking up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder according unto the number of the tribes of the children of israel that this may be a sign among you that when your children ask their fathers in time to come saying what mean ye by these stones then you shall answer them that the waters of jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the lord when it passed over jordan the waters of jordan were cut off and these stones shall be for a memorial under the children of israel forever so what was it it was a memorial it was something that they could look at it was a memory it was something to stir up peter said it was something to stir up their pure minds by way of remembrance to let them remember what god had done for them the supernatural power that god had displayed in their lives when they when they put the manna into the the holy holy was it they could take a bite of that manna and even though they were in the promised land that the manna had ceased they could still remember what god had done in providing for the children of israel all these things and and we even come to the point why one of the reasons communion is so important because first corinthians 11 23-26 we know these are communion scriptures that we read let's go there first corinthians 11 verses 23 through 26 for i have received of the lord that which also i delivered unto you that the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had stopped saying this cup is the new testament in my blood this do you this do he as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup he to show the lord's death till he come so what is it jesus himself setting forth a memorial of himself of his sacrifice of his of his body and his blood that was given for the believer so that we can always have something to look back and to remember that's why we don't have to have enough another memorial now because we can look back on that and see that that was it that was the perfect sacrifice that's the one memorial that we can look at and know that it was finished amen so we can always with that communion it's the holy time to come and check your life and the devil will be all you shouldn't take communion because of this and because of that and because of this and you say you know what lord if there's any art i will make it right i'm going to put it under the blood and while the devil's bringing up those scarecrows at the same time he's trying to condemn you for that you can look at the communion and remember what that stands for which is the forgiving power of the blood of jesus christ that cleanses you and makes you holy and perfect before him amen but what does the devil do he starts he buries those things he makes it so you don't remember him anymore he he makes you forget the testimonies of your life oh how many of you here how many of you here have ever been healed i've been healed i've i've had things that i was struggling or suffering i prayed and got healed i could that's a that's a memorial in your life that you can look back that's a good memory that you can look back how many of you were out in the world doing whatever you want to do and then god came along your path revealed a word to you revealed the truth of this hour to you and brought you to it i'm here because of that that is a memorial you right now being here you right now that may be listening on the live stream you are a living memorial of what god has done in this hour while it's getting smaller and smaller and falling away left falling away to the right all these different things here you stand don't let the devil steal those memories from you you get that spiritual amnesia we know brother brandon talked about that that's spiritual amnesia you start to forget who you are you start to forget what your purpose is you start to forget that you're even a christian anymore you start to forget it's not see there's a thing that spiritual amnesia didn't change who you are it changed what you thought you were it changed what you thought about yourself it changed with what your recognition it's a failure of recognition and that's what the devil does with these memories and we're talking about i will remember so we go through with that with that before us we want to always that's why we would read our word that's why we think upon the things of god because that's why we listen to messages and different things then we listen to the preaching of the word why because it's a bringing of remembrance it's a memorial before you always of who you are because the devil is out there every day trying to steal that away trying to steal it away trying to steal it away he's clogging her trying to clog our minds with so much garbage he's trying to clog our arts all those senses up trying to clog those channels up to where now we can't even remember who we are anymore and when that happens that's where we become unfruitful so what do we want to do we want to remember the word of the lord we want to remember i will i want you to let's go to psalms 77 just one of my absolutely favorite scriptures you know we okay we didn't uh we didn't go into this yesterday i was thinking about it after the service and i was thinking you know when it comes to that taste sense you know one of the hardest things it's uh because we know the tongue is where we speak from and all these different things one of the hardest things to say is i'm sorry one of the hardest things to do is confess really confess our faults one to another why it leaves a bad taste on the tongue it's not easy to get that out you know and it's something because we we ought to be honest with ourselves we need to be honest with ourselves that doesn't mean we go around speaking negatively if we're truly honest with the holy ghost with conviction not not not these false memories okay not letting the devil just build up fortresses around you and cage you in and you're speaking all these negative things about yourself but if if there's something you're struggling with if there if there's a battle you're facing if there's deliverance that you need if there's healing that you need if you need faith if you're if you're lacking in faith if you're lacking something as you can ask god for it you can be honest with god amen amen and that's what we need to do is be honest that's why i love this scripture so much psalm 77 will read starting at the first verse he says i cried unto god with my voice even unto god with my voice and he gave here unto me in the day of my trouble i sought the lord my soul ran in the night and ceased not my soul refused to be comforted i remembered god and was troubled have you ever had that how many have ever devils get you to a place where every time you think about the lord it almost troubles you because sometimes the devil's got you in that corner it's just seeing how short you come so that even the very remembrance of god is almost just a fearful thing not in a holy reverential fear but oh my i'm just done for i've been there where it seems like just like uh david my sin is just ever before me every time i think about the lord all i can see is my failures this is what he's saying he said i remembered god and i was troubled i complained and my spirit was overwhelmed thou holdest mine eyes waking i am so troubled that i cannot speak i have considered the days of old the years of ancient times i called to remembrance my song in the night i commune with my own heart and my spirit made diligent search see that's a good thing right there if you're troubled just get down and start searching lord if there's something wrong lord if there be any wicked way in me i want to surrender it lord i don't want to be in this spot i don't want to be downtrodden like this because god is not looking for his people to be downtrodden and just somber and and all depressed all the time and oh whoa the world's going down and no we ought to be the happiest people amen because of what god's done for us and what he is doing for us and what he will do for us but he asks will the lord verse 7 will the lord cast off forever and will he be favorable no more is his mercy clean gone forever does his promise fail forevermore has god's forgotten to be gracious had he in anger shut up his tender mercies say think about that how many of you ever felt like that oh lord are you have you just forgotten about me have you cast off uh have i failed your mercy have i gone too far you know brother branham i believe brother branham said himself like he says he said if you have any the slightest desire for god then you hold on to that the worry you have is when you don't care about it anymore when there's no desire you don't have any any even inkling of desire but if there's any desire but he's wondering these things he's he's enough you can tell he's in a dark place i love verse 10 though he said and i said this is mine infirmity but i will remember the years of the right hand of the most high amen who's the right hand that's jesus christ amen i will remember jesus christ i will remember the words of the lord surely i will remember thy wonders of old i will meditate also of all thy work and talk of thy doings that's what we need to be doing brothers and sisters when you get into that spot you say see i like how he did it though he said this is my infirmity he wasn't trying to be like so many of us claim that we have faith and don't have he said lord i got this problem but i'm going to remember what you've done for me amen i'm gonna remember that you pulled me out of denomination you pulled me out of the world you brought me to this place and you're not gonna leave me because you said he had begun a good work is faithful and just to complete it amen he's not going to stop brothers and sisters he made you the promise don't let the devil bury that promise don't let him push it out of your memory say oh yes i have this struggle i have problems this is my infirmity this is the this is the wound that i have this is the sickness that i have but i will remember the right hand i would remember the years of the right hand i would remember jesus christ i will remember that communion i remember that blood that was shed that forgave me that cleansed me that gave me a promise of everlasting life of eternal life amen yes what we have to do is remember what he's done now we go back now you start thinking oh this is what we need to do is remember what god's doing remember what he's done now we can go back and look at adam and eve again all those memories brought up and say oh yeah we failed in the garden maybe adam and times where he got a little frustrated so yeah he blew it all up eve why'd you have to go and blow it all up memories we fight those it's real this is real life try to sugarcoat it as if we don't as if we don't fight it's a battle brothers and sisters i have to be honest i try to be transparent with you because i i can't come up here like a priest acting like i'm just some special somebody that's got something you don't got no sir saved by the same blood filled with the same holy ghost amen god's working the same work and i got the same battles maybe not in the exact same form but we all fight these things remember oh eve thinking about those when she's when she stumbled with the serpent and i'm thinking yes i know oh you know i i couldn't help but to take her back because of my love for all the battles they had to fight oh you gave up eternal life in the garden you gave up but then they could say i will remember even in our trial how god came and he ripped those big leaves off us and clothed us with with robes of skin aprons of skin a sacrifice i will remember how he showed forth a coming sacrifice that would bring us back to eden amen i'll remember that even in the midst of our fallen state god still came and said your seed will bruise the head of that serpent amen that there will be a seed that will come who will give us salvation they can remember that moses moses in the desert comes in has an experience with god goes back no doubt there were all the chorus and the dathan's and all the remember we talked about that mixed multitude that mixed multitude was there in egypt just as much as they were in the wilderness no doubt whispers going around oh yeah moses you couldn't do nothing you're nothing but a murderer anyway but he can sit there no doubt those memories popping back up oh you married this this woman on the backside of the desert who you shouldn't have married all these different things all these things talking about but moses said i can remember when i had no hope just hurting sheep on the back side of the desert and god called out to me [Music] and he said i've come down to deliver him and i'm sending you moses he can remember the promise that god gave when he said put your hand in your bosom take it out again throw your stick down on the ground pick it up again i'll remember the commission think about joseph we'll go back to joseph now all the the accusations that probably followed him no doubt when he was put in prison after potiphar's wife the devil's right there oh you know you were flirting with her you know you were you know you were asking for it you were you know you you you were trying you know to do that and you're just scared because you knew it would get you in trouble that's the only reason you did it you know accusing that's how he does it even when things happen that you didn't want to happen the devil is right there to try to no matter what he remember he's playing both sides no doubt he was struggling but then he says i will remember i'll remember how god gave me those prophetic dreams to show me that i'll see my family again because those moon and the stars all came down and bowed down to me i'll remember what god has done for me what he made me that i i have lived my life the best that i could and i'm trusting jehovah to fulfill his promise and he did brought it all to pass raised him up to the right hand of pharaoh said i will remember the promises that god gave me i'll remember that my father loved me and gave me that coat and i'll remember that my heavenly father loves me david sitting there feeling condemned said you are the man you're the one that committed this murder you're the one who did this adultery i thought you were the man after god's own heart david but david can say i will remember his mercy endureth forever amen yes lord his mercy endureth forever i would remember how he brought me up in the sheepfold let me slay the lion let me slay the bear kept me from help me kill that philistine goliath kept me from the hand of saul fulfilled his word to me put me on the throne gave me a promise and i'll remember that that sacrifice stands and i'm gonna trust in that sacrifice peter oh here we go peter oh my i can see peter's struggling oh my oh could you imagine oh i can't try to imagine but i couldn't imagine what that's like when peter's sitting there thinking about all that oh you know you know the one you called messiah he said it was the messiah he stood there and called you he called you the devil he called you satan right to your face he was pointing at you oh and then he said one amongst you is the devil and then he pointed at you and called you the king of the devils you know that battle was raging and then peter but something had to tell him i will remember when i when he said but peter who do you say that i am he said thou art the christ the son of the living god he said flesh and blood has not revealed this to you simon son of jonas but my father which is in heaven and i say to you that thou art peter and upon this rock i shall build my church he said i will give you the keys to the kingdom and then jesus comes back and he says when you're converted you strengthen your brethren and then you know what he says he says i'll remember how he said i won't leave you comfortless but i will come to you and so peter goes to pentecost no doubt fighting those memories still fighting those memories no doubt but he said i'm going to remember the promise that he gave me i'm going to remember that he called me i'm gonna remember i'm not gonna let the devil try to pull it over on me and that's where the devil gets so many he gets them from going to pentecost he gets them from believing that full word of god for themselves they put themselves out oh you're just nothing but a devil the devil's putting up every roadblock to keep you from that holy ghost that he can date paul but peter would say i remember when when he called me out and said your name is simon you're the son of jonas he said you follow me i'll make you a fisher of men he could remember what god had done for him he wasn't gonna sit there and and let that deter him as crazy as it looked you don't think that maybe there are some people at first saw peter come in that upper room and said what is he doing here we heard about you peter we heard about what jesus said to you we heard about how you denied him and fled from the scene and peter said yeah but i remember how jesus said he said you go into jerusalem and you stay in that upper room you stay there do you be a dude with power from on high he said so i'm doing what he said i may have failed then but by his grace i won't fail now and it's the same way for you you the devil brings up those fails yeah i failed then yeah i might have fallen short but by his grace i won't fail now that's the same way this bride is he may have fallen then but this bride will not fail now amen paul persecuting the church all that guilt all those memories coming back but he would say i remember when i was on my way to damascus and that light struck me down said saul saul why persecuted thou me he said who out there lord send out jesus he said i would remember when i spoke to ananias when he prayed for me and the scales fell off my eyes and i could see clearly for the first time i could see the word of god clearly he said i'm going to show i'm going to show how much he's going to suffer for my sake oh my there's going to be a light to the gentiles he could remember that in closing [Music] we totally heard brother branham tell that story about the soldier with amnesia on that train that soldier many of us have i think many of us were on that train at one time brothers and sisters on that train he said he's going to the sanitarium where they're going to have to stay because they couldn't remember who they were couldn't know that nobody would claim them nobody even knew who they were thought they were dead didn't care about them didn't think anything of it but what happened they first they got off that train they got off the train for a little rest and what did they do they started looking around and i really like this because i never picked this up before but he says you said that soldier started looking around he said the first thing he started seeing he saw that water tank you know that was the first thing i saw was the baptism the water baptism that water tank was i saw the baptism in the name of jesus christ he said he saw that water tank something was familiar about that water tank you know when i saw that baptism there was something familiar about that baptism i didn't know at the time i had grown up not knowing i had amnesia but there was something familiar about that water baptism tank brother there's something familiar about the name of jesus christ to be baptized in it that was familiar and he said he looked around he said there's a little hill we had to look at a hill called calvary to take away the amnesia see if you ever find yourself in that amnesia go back go back to that waterway go back to that little hill he said when he saw that hill what'd he start doing he followed a little path yes yes when you see that hill you just start walking that little path you start walking that little narrow way yeah it's gonna weave around you're not gonna be able to always see what's around every corner you're not going to understand what's going on that little soldier didn't know either he didn't know why but something compelled him there's something that compelled him and i like it because that sold the other one that was watching him it's almost like the holy ghost just like yep he caught it i'm just gonna follow him on i'm just gonna i'm just gonna keep an eye on him i'm just gonna watch him go that's what the heavenly father is doing with you right now we're walking this path you've seen that you've seen that water tower you've seen that hill of calvary you walk in this path and around any corner now it's going to be the home that you've been looking for this whole time and the father at the gates just saying i knew you'd come back i knew you were there that's what jesus is saying to you right now he says i know you're there i know if you're struggling with that amnesia just go back and remember say this is my infirmity but i will remember jesus christ amen i'll remember what he did for me i'm not gonna let the devil steal away my testimonies i'm not gonna let him steal away all the things that god's done for me how he brought me out of denomination how he brought me out of the depths of depression how he brought me out of places where i just thought it was all over and i was cast out but somehow still i am here yeah i believe you have the same testimony you're still here you have a desire to live this word don't let the devil clog up that channel of memories blast it out with the word go back look at these if if the devil's blinded you so much to your own memorials in your life go back to these memorials these are eternal memorials as well that'll give you a remembrance that even when i'm gone you'll still keep these in remembrance amen amen let's stand praise the lord we don't want to let the devil make us forget we want a holy memory i will remember what the lord jesus has done for me i'll remember you know i'm going to remember what he's done for you brother i don't remember what he's done for sister wendy how a brother met you on a plane that's not coincidence that's pretty what what the world calls coincidence i call predestination amen amen i'm gonna remember what he's done in my life i'm gonna i'm gonna look back but i'm not gonna dwell i'm not gonna live my life looking in that little rearview mirror but what i need to what i see you know when you see obstacles ahead when you see when you see trouble on the road and you need to change lanes a little bit because you need to avoid yeah what do you do you look in that room and say lord oh there's a testimony right there i'm going to move right on over i'm going to pass this obstacle but if you're not looking you better watch out you might make a shipwreck there's a reason for it brothers and sisters all these things these memories and the conscience reason affection imaginations your see taste feel smell and hear all these things god wants to use them let the lord just overflow it with faith with love to to blast out those channels so everything that comes forth is just holiness and and love and peace and righteousness all these things that we desire to have he'll do it for you he's able he's doing it even now amen let's bow our heads heavenly father lord we just never want to put you out of our remembrance oh god lord jesus we want to always have these things in remembrance lord jesus of your blood of your sacrifice of your atoning power of the work that you're doing in our lives lord jesus of the the holy ghost that you've given to us father of the promises that you've given to us of a rapture lord that we know is just just over the horizon lord and lord jesus we're looking to that day the lord we don't want to forget the things that you've done for us father lord we can lord every trial that we come up against lord we can look and see what you've already done for us how lord if you could help us to overcome this obstacle and that obstacle if lord we can look at the scripture and see how you've overcome for your children father we can go forward in faith from there pressing to the mark of the high calling lord if we've clogged up any of the channels father may your holy ghost just go through and cover it up with faith lord cover it up with holy ghost power and divine love and charity lord and just clean out all those channels help us not to focus on our failures lord but focus upon your success father and what you did for us and how you accomplished it you're the one that accomplished it anything in our lives that happens isn't because we've done it but because you accomplished it in us lord if we could just let go of ourselves and just let you work on father but lord we stumble ourselves because we get in the way of the spirit that desires to work in us [Music] may not have gone the way [Music] permissive will for your perfect so we can rest in that lord we know that it's all in your hands and everyone the ones [Music] and give you the glory lord [Music] you know i'll tell you one thing is we'll have brother amen sing a song or two if anybody has need a prayer we pray for you the lord is here to do exceedingly and abundantly above whatever you can ask for i still want you to ask we can pray for you if need be but i want to just tell you this and the last little thing if i could leave you with this thought as we're kind of closing up these services take up talking about memory i tell you what the next time the devil you can keep playing brother that's fine and the next time that devil sits here and tries to remind you of your past i think you ought to remind him of his future it's the only reason he lives in that past is because you don't like to think what's going on he's trying to remember he's trying to hinder it it's like it's like a little it's like a little little man standing in front of a freight train trying to stop him from going he's trying to push all he can he can't stop he's trying to hinder it all he can but he can't stop it so when he's trying to point back to your past because that's already sealed your future's already sealed his future is already sealed so how about you remind him of those things head back to texas in the morning and by the grace of the lord i have a good report it is not 38 degrees in texas but it's like 60s and 70s but well we certainly love you all for those that are brother here that i had a chance to meet for the first time the different ones and ones that i've known already love each and every one of you pray that you just go forth and trusting in the lord jesus his word is true his promises are yea and amen and you're gonna make it you're gonna make awkward christian soldiers there's a reason that that's what they were saying when he saw that preview of the bride because what is it just keep marching keep marching don't don't let it stop [Music] so [Music] so [Music] you [Music] see [Music] so [Music] you [Music] well [Music] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] [Music]
