Description:
The rapture is a mysterious event because St. Paul called it so in 1 Corinthians 15:51, saying, "Behold, I show you a mystery...". Thankfully, God promised to finish the mystery of God at the end times in Revelation 10:7 and this video series shares the revelations from the Bible about the rapture of the Bride of Jesus Christ. In Part 1, we learn the rapture has two Bible names - the "caught up" experience and the "first resurrection". The video concludes by summarizing answers to questions about the rapture, such as "Who is the rapture for?" and "When will the rapture take place?", among others.
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to share the Bible revelations about the mysterious endtime event known as the rapture st. Paul specifically called the rapture a mystery in 1st Corinthians 15 verse 51 and reveal a part of the mystery saying behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed thankfully the Bible promised that all the mysteries of God would be revealed in the end times which includes the rapture mystery as revelation 10 verse 7 said that the mystery of God would be finished or revealed and then the revelation will be taken and prophesied before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings according to revelation 10 verse 11 the word rapture and it's to Bible names the literal word rapture is not used in the King James Version of the Bible but many Christians still use the word we choose to use the word rapture because it's definition is fully supported in Scripture and it gives us a common term to use with believers and unbelievers in the Bible the rapture is called two things first the caught up experience to meet the Lord Jesus in the air second the first resurrection we will briefly teach about these two names first the rapture is called the caught up experience which comes from st. Paul who use the words caught up to meet the Lord in the air in 1st Thessalonians 4 verse 17 and that is what we mean when we say rapture for it is the catching up or caught up experience or ascension of the Dead and living Christians into heaven right before the Great Tribulation Period and the end of the world second the rapture is called the first resurrection in Revelation chapter 20 verse 5 because there is also a second resurrection according to Christ Jesus and Scripture erection or rapture is Christ seizing away his bride her wife the Holy Ghost field Saints before worldwide destruction and then Christ allows them to live and reign with him for a thousand years in the Millennium the Bride of Christ includes the dead in Christ or those Holy Ghost field Christians who died and slept in Christ over the past 2,000 years and it includes the living Holy Ghost fill Christians who will never have to taste death the dead in Christ will be resurrected in incorruptible or perfect bodies and the living Saints will experience a body change into incorruptible bodies and live eternally without end with Christ the rest of the entire world population who denied Christ as unbelievers along with those foolish virgin Christians who did not receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost will have to die during the tribulation period or Battle of Armageddon and they will miss the thousand year millennial reign with Christ they will not live during the 1,000 year millennial reign because the lives they chose to live during their time on earth were not fit to rule and reign with Christ this is true because revelation 20 verse 5 said the rest of the Dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished the rest of the world population and foolish virgin Christian will remain in the graves according to Jesus in John 5 verse 28 and will be resurrected for their day of judgement at the great white throne which is called the second resurrection and was spoken of by Christ in Matthew 25 verses 31 to 46 in Revelation chapter 20 verses 11 through 15 understanding the rapture in order to understand the rapture and fully share the revelations about the rapture mystery we will answer the following questions briefly and then teach these scriptural truths more in depth than Vina Lee afterwards what is the rapture who is the rapture for when will the rapture occur where will the rapture take place at why will the rapture occur how will the rapture be done what is the rapture the rapture is the resurrection and ascension of the dead in Christ first the Christians who have died during the last 2000 years followed by the body change and ascension of the Living Holy Ghost vil Christians into the sky to meet Jesus at a secret return to cease away his people from the earth before the Great Tribulation Period who is the rapture for the rapture is for jesus' bride or wife which are the Holy Ghost field Christians who have loved and faithfully served Jesus Christ over the past 2,000 years including the dead and the living Jesus called this group the wise virgin in Matthew 25 verses 1 to 13 all sinners and foolish virgin Christians Christians who are not born again of the Holy Ghost will be left behind and going to the Great Tribulation Period or Jacob's trouble when will the rapture occur the rapture will occur at an unknown day an hour but the Bible and Jesus described the conditions times and seasons that must be met before the rapture can occur the bible teaches the rapture will occur before the Great Tribulation Period true Christians will love his appearing according to 2nd Timothy 4 verse 8 true Christians will watch and pray as Jesus commanded and be ready for the rapture where will the rapture take place at the rapture will be a universal event meaning it will take place on a global scale and believers will not have to be in one physical location in order to be a part of the rapture Holy Ghost filled believers might be working at the time of the rapture or sleeping in their beds on the other side of the world but it doesn't matter if they have the oil of the baptism of the Holy Ghost or the wedding garment of the baptism of the Holy Ghost they will be ready for the rapture and Jesus will call them to the air to meet the rest of the Saints in the sky why will the rapture occur the rapture will occur because Jesus Christ desires to take his Gentile bride to their wedding in the sky and then to their wedding supper in heaven Christ wants to receive his people unto himself and rescue his wife from the great tribulation period that is coming upon the earth to judge and torment the unbelievers as pilgrims and strangers on this earth the Holy Ghost field bride wants to leave this world and ever be with the Lord according to 1st Thessalonians 4 verse 17 how will the rapture be done the rapture will be done by the power and authority of Jesus Christ himself through his own shout voice and Trump the same Holy Spirit that quickened Jesus's own body and his resurrection from the dead and raptured his body twice will come upon the dead in Christ and the living Saints and translate them in a moment in the twinkling eye to the air to meet Jesus in the sky a corner first Corinthians 15:52 [Music]
