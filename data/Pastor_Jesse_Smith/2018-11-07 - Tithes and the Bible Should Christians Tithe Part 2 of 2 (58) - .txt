TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] the blessings and benefits of paying tithes and offerings six reasons God asked us to give tithes and offerings first to support the pastors and other ministers so they can focus on praying and preaching second to help further and finish the Great Commission missionaries or apostles one of the five preaching gifts cannot go preach around the world without financial support God lets each person no matter how rich or poor help support the Great Commission by paying tithes and offerings third paying tithes and offerings teaches Christians to fear God according to Deuteronomy 14 23 and thou shalt eat before the LORD thy God in the place which he shall choose to place his name there the tithe of Eichhorn of thy wine and of thine oil and the first things of thy herds and of thy flocks that thou mayest learn to fear the Lord thy God always fearing God is hating evil and the love of money is the root of all evil giving more than ten percent of your money away in faith teaches Christians to reject and ultimately hate covetousness selfishness riches and teaches them to love righteousness godliness and peace the rich young ruler in matthew 1922 feared losing his riches more than he feared God choosing to reject Jesus's invitation to be an apostle which exposed his heart of unbelief despite following all the other Commandments fourth to learn humility and contentment God said the ties were his in Leviticus 27 verse 30 so we must humble ourselves and realize we are nothing and could have nothing without God's generous hand and all the tithe of the land whether of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the tree is the Lord's it is holy unto the Lord and the tenth shall be holy unto the Lord tithing the hallowed things also this means Abraham was just giving back to Melchizedek what was already his you and I are just giving God a portion back of what already belongs to him all work and increase is a gift from God Ecclesiastes 5:19 every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth and have given him power to eat thereof and to take his portion and to rejoice in his labour this is the gift of God God is so gracious that he gives us a hundred percent of our income because he gives us strength to work a job all he asks is that we give a little over ten percent back to support the Great Commission God values contentment and those who set their affections on the treasures above in heaven and not upon earthly things but godliness with contentment is great gain for we brought nothing into this world and it is certain we can carry nothing out and having food and raiment let us be therewith content fifth it teaches us the cause-and-effect law of giving that we might be like God and that God might bless us proverbs 3 verses 9 and 10 says if you honor God God will increase your income or substance honor the Lord with thy substance and with the first fruits of all thine increase so shall thy barns be filled with plenty and thy presses shall burst out with new wine God wants us to live by all his loss for we will be happiest when we keep his wise commands this way we learn to be generous just like God who sends his rain upon the just and the unjust in fact this is what Jesus said we must do in order to become like our Heavenly Father Matthew 5:44 through 46 but I say unto you love your enemies bless than the curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you that ye may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his Sun to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust for if he love them which love you what reward have ye do not even the publicans the same acts 20:35 it is more blessed to give than receive 2nd Corinthians 9:6 through 7 but God loveth a cheerful Giver God loves a cheerful Giver and we must be cheerful givers 6th taifeng proves we are the seed of Abraham and that God foreknew our obedience just as God recognized Levi's righteous habit of tithe paying two generations before he was born while he was in Abraham's loins Hebrews 7 9 through 10 and as I may so say Levi also who received ties paid tithes in Abraham for he was yet in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him be encouraged and be certain that God knows you are paying ties and which of your children or grandchildren will pay ties in the future God is keeping track of the givers as well as the thieves but remember just as God called and blessed Levi in a tithes and offering system God will bless and honor you and your family for paying tithes and offerings consequences of not paying God tithes and offerings the Bible says there are negative consequences to not paying tithes and offerings both during this life and also in the next life at the white throne judgment the first consequence is being identified as a robber or thief in the eyes of God during life and at the judgment although a man may prosper financially on the earth without paying tithes and offerings heaven will recognize him as a thief will a man Rob God yet ye have robbed me but ye say wherein have we robbed thee in tithes and offerings it seems many lost people will meet Christ on judgement day as thieves according to 1st Corinthians 6 verses 9 to 10 or those who have robbed God of tithes and offerings and will not possess or inherit God's kingdom 1st Corinthians 6:9 through 10 know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate nor abusers of themselves with mankind nor thieves nor covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God the second consequence is a distant dormant unfruitful relationship with Christ during this life recall Malachi 3 7 return unto me and I will return unto you saith the Lord of Hosts but ye say where and shall we return these Jews who robbed out of their tithes and offerings needed to return to God so they were living in a distant and dormant unfruitful relationship with God a third consequence is a curse nation or family during this life Malachi 3 9 you are cursed with a curse for yet rod me even this whole nation a fourth consequence maybe suffering financial hardships during this life as Israelis suffered during the days of Haggai when they neglected the house of God in order to take care of their own houses is it time for you o ye to dwell in your sealed houses and this house lie waste now therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts consider your ways you have so much and bring in little you but you have not enough you drink but you're not filled with drink you close you but there is none warm and he the earnest wages earth wages to put into a bag with holes in conclusion please pray about giving tithes and offerings to your storehouse your local or home Church God has graciously gifted you 100 percent of your income so you should be happy to give over 10 percent of that to support Jesus's Great Commission and he promised to bless you in this life and in the future the 1000 year millennial reign and in the New Jerusalem if you have any questions about giving tithes and offerings in the New Testament please contact us god bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart you
