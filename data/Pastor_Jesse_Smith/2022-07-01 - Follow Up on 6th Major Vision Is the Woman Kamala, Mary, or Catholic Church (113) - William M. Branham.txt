TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] and in this would be a woman stand up that would govern the united states not actually a woman but a church not actually a woman but a church greetings friends in the mattress name of the lord jesus christ the purpose of this video is to follow up on my march 2021 video titled is brother branham's sixth vision fulfilled by kamala harris and joe biden it doesn't seem to be in this follow-up i want to share more quotes from brother branham to again show that brother branham never said thus saith the lord the sixth vision must be a literal woman the truth is brother ram did not know if the sixth vision would be fulfilled by a literal woman or mary or by the catholic church so it is still the opinion of preachers and other message believers and not a fact that the sixth vision is fulfilled i also want to say that this video is not made with any bitterness or spitefulness i'm not trying to cause any division or anything but i just want to humbly show more quotes from brother branham that i found since making the first video back in march 2021 and i hope viewers can then understand how we do not have a thus saith the lord from brother branham about the fulfillment of the sixth vision and thereby we should not act like it i also hope our viewers can see how some message believers either willingly or ignorantly just pick and choose quotes that fit their interpretation rather than acknowledging all the quotes from brother branham on a particular subject my prayers for these believers to be more humble and more balanced just as i want to be humble and balanced by the grace of god i still believe the three reasons why the sixth vision is likely not fulfilled which include number one some of brother brahms own words make it sound like the fourth vision is not fulfilled yet as he said it's in the process of coming to pass this would mean the fifth and sixth visions have not come to pass because the first three visions that have come to pass were fulfilled in that order second a couple details about the sixth vision do not seem to have come to pass such as many people not thinking kamala harris is beautiful and second people recognizing that kamala harris does not have complete power over the united states and our nation as a whole has not bowed to mrs harris third regarding the fifth vision brother branham saw the little fig leaf dress in a magazine but it seems this vision has still not come to pass yet because if it was the whole world would have to recognize that the little fig leaf dress had come to pass just like the undeniable fulfillment of the first three visions about mussolini hitler and nazism and fascism being swallowed up in communism so i don't believe there's enough evidence to show that the fourth and fifth and sixth visions have been fulfilled with undeniable proof like we have with the first three visions being fulfilled undeniably and now it seems i could add a fourth reason i do not believe the sixth vision is fulfilled and that would be brother random never gave a definitive about who the powerful woman ruler would be as he interpreted the woman in at least four different ways which i'll soon show by the grace of god again let me emphasize i do believe all seven major visions and i believe the first three are fulfilled so i believe there are four remaining visions that will be undeniably fulfilled with the same irrefutable evidence as the first three head i'm going to again define the sixth vision as written in the church age book quote then in the sixth vision there arose up in america a most beautiful but cruel woman she held the people in her complete power i believe that this was the rise of the roman catholic church though i knew it could possibly be a vision of some woman rising in great power in america due to a popular vote by women end quote five quotes about the sixth vision let's go through five quotes that prove brother branham was not positive about the fulfillment of the sixth vision because he said it could be at least four different women which were mary a vice president a president or the roman catholic church here's the first quote from 1960 notice brother branham said she'll either be president vice president or it'll be the catholic church as a woman so in this one quote he listed three out of the four possibilities as to the identity of the woman let's listen to the quote everything is woman and remember thus saith the lord there'll be a woman rule before the end time she'll either be president vice president or it'll be the catholic church as a woman a senior a great woman the nation bowed to her it'll be one before the end time thus saith the lord write it down find out your young people see if it happens if it isn't i'm a false prophet next the next three quotes are from 1961. here in the first quote brother ram said the woman will be a church and notice this means it won't be a literal woman like kamala harris so this quote makes us wonder why aren't the preachers saying what the tapes say in this quote let's listen to the quote [Applause] here in the next quote from jezebel religion 1961 brother branham said the woman being worshiped was mary so here's the fourth possibility of the identity of the woman from the sixth vision brother branham said it could be mary and again ask yourself why aren't preachers reading this quote or quoting this quote from brother branham since some of them say we believe all the quotes and some of them say say what the tapes say let's listen to the quote there will come a worship of a woman in the united states and they'll be married i'll see it 30 1931 seven things happen i got it i don't pay for here with me wrote it in 1931. here in the next quote this is one of the most popular quotes the preachers like to use which is the 70th week of daniel 1961. here brother ram said it was a great woman beautiful looking in real highly royals like purple again notice how brother ram said i don't know so ask yourself how can the preachers today know this woman was kamala harris if brother branham did not know was a literal woman let's listen to the quote now i predicted and said i saw a great woman stand up beautiful looking dressed in real highly royal black purple and i got little princes down here she was a great ruler in the united states perhaps the catholic church a woman some woman i don't know it'll be the catholic church i don't know i can't say the only thing i've seen i've seen the woman that was off now we'll listen to our fifth and last quote it's from 1963 here in the sermon once more brother brahm said the woman of the sixth vision was not an actual woman yet many preachers and message believers will say it's kamala harris and consider that this quote is even after the opening of the seven seals which everyone knows was a great time of further progressive revelation that god was giving to brother branham and again ask why aren't preachers saying what the tapes say regarding this quote let's listen to the quote and how that that permit women to vote in doing so that would elect the wrong president and in this would be a woman stand up that would govern the united not actually a woman but a church then i've seen her with nothing but ashes it's going to happen time will vindicate who is right about the sixth vision time will be the great vindicator of who is right about the sixth vision proving who is presuming and jumping to conclusions in error and proving who is being humble and waiting upon the lord to fulfill his word in humility i just want to say i've seen this air of jumping to conclusions on numerous occasions since i came into the message at the end of 2001. here's a few examples in 2009 and 2010 some message preachers were saying obama was the antichrist so the rapture would happen sometime during his presidency then in 2015 some message preachers were saying the rapture would happen because of the numerous blood moons and the pope's visit to the united states in 2018 some message preachers were saying god would return to the jews because 2018 marked the 70th year since israel was officially recognized as an independent nation which was 1948. if god returned to the jews then the gentile rapture would have to happen first so they were basically predicting the rapture in 2018. then in 2021 after the presidential inauguration in january some message preachers were saying the sixth vision was fulfilled and they were only waiting for the seventh vision the destruction or bombing of the united states to be fulfilled and then in this year march of 2022 about three months ago i heard a very influential message preacher say the rapture was only days away and then he said the rapture was only hours away because of the war in ukraine so it's obvious friends that message preachers or message believers are just going to keep making predictions every year about the coming of the lord and it's likely one year they will get it right because jesus said no man knows the day or the hour jesus never said no man wouldn't know the month week or year of the rapture but again we just want to be humble we don't want to jump to conclusions we want to avoid making presumptions and avoid trying to make ourselves seem more spiritual or make ourselves something that we're not we're not prophets and by god's grace i'll close by sharing the quote from brother branham that i think is the best indicator about when the rapture will occur as it relates to the time of the squeeze or the time period right before the rapture when the beast system is preparing to lay down its mark it's from spoken word as original seed 1962 this is when brother brahm said the holy spirit told him to pick up his pen and write and so the main indicator is that the united states government will change laws and force the bride to stop preaching let's listen to the quote i believe sunday the real bride of christ will be forced to stop preaching the word of god the bible prophesies of it in revelations 13 16 if you want to put it down denominations will force it to stop or take its mark then when the lamb will take his bride and judge the for this in closing i hope this video was a blessing to help others be more balanced and patient regarding the fulfillment of the seven major visions and really every prophecy that brother random gave us if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me god bless you and may jesus christ be the desire of your heart
