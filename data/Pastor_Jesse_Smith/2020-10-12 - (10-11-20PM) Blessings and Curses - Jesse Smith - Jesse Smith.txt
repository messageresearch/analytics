christ [Music] so [Music] appreciate the special let's give them a round of applause thank you let's if we could let's go to deuteronomy 28 by god's grace i'd like to look at uh blessings and curses tonight it's like i said it's quite a huge subject we'd like to maybe just hit the highlights tonight by god's grace and just see how far we can get so deuteronomy 28 verse 1. i like to i got some slides i want to show too so just give me a moment i'll get that ready uh it's important topic praise god we want to be blessed and walk in all of god's blessings and we don't want to be under curses we want to walk in the blessing of god so that's so important we know there's such a thing as permanent curses like the cursed children and the people on the left hand of jesus at the white throne judgment you and i will battle we don't battle that one we battle the temporary ones things problems we we create ourselves many times right punishments that we must live with because of decisions so god help us to overcome praise god i know he will deuteronomy 28 1. let's just read that uh one verse together it's quite an extensive chapter here uh if you remember from your reading you know deuteronomy 27 28 and 29 are the chapters that moses reiterates all the blessings and the curses as the children of israel prepare to take the promised land so he's basically repeating the law before they took the land um let's just read verses one and two let's read that together that would be a good reading for us tonight let's read verses one and two on three one two three and it shall come to pass if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the lord thy god to observe and to do all his commandments which i command thee this day that the lord thy god will set thee on high above all nations of the earth and all these blessings shall come on thee and overtake thee if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the lord died god let's have a word of prayer can we just our heads if you have a need on your heart let's make it known unto god heavenly father you see the hands lord you see the hearts lord and uh you're our living hope your only hope lord that we have and we rejoice in that hope we rejoice in your promises all that you've done in our lives to this point lord and all you're doing right now and all you're going to do we rejoice in it lord god you are our living hope dear god thank you for your blessings help us to sing through the pain when we go through trials and praise your name and uh lord give you honor and glory as we're tested and tried father tonight give me wisdom and help me to speak your word help the people to receive it and help me to rightly divide lord for your glory lord that the saints of god might walk in every blessing uh as we walk in this spiritual promised land of adoption uh in the promises of god so lord we just bless your holy name tonight and be with us tonight in christ jesus name we pray the saints said amen god bless you as you're seated there praise god so i have some quotes i'd like to share did wendy go home did anybody know oh okay praise god i was going to send her a text act i didn't know if she left i know she has praise god god bless us through anyhow we're going to text you real quick there so let's look at blessings and curses uh there are over let me refresh i thought there was over 300 cursed scriptures in the bible i'm sorry there's 161 old testament 20 new testament i went through all the new testament i made it through all the old testament ones but lord willing i'll do that so maybe this would be like a part one and maybe have a part two uh not next week is whether bender out here but maybe on a wednesday night or something like that i think it's just an outstanding subject to look at and how many want to overcome every curse and when i live enjoy every blessing that's what i want to do by god's grace i know the lord will certainly help us uh so let's look at our there's my notes i think i'll skip that one let's first define uh blessings and curses so we have a pretty sim or solid idea it's very simple of course um i found the hebrew definitions just to be like their own names so i had to go to the dictionaries so bless in hebrew means to pray salute adore but we would we refer to it as god's favor right god's protection if we are blessed we're under god's favor god is for us he's not against us right um so we see that in the hebrew and then also in our common dictionary curse in the hebrew was basically the same thing as its its name it didn't give me any synonyms um and i thought these were good words too according to what brother branham taught as well curse in the dictionary means inflict means to harm or punish okay so let's not forget you know uh hebrews 12. i think i preached on a couple wednesdays ago where uh hebrews 12 says the lord chastens every son whom he calls and he scourgeth every son or daughter and that literally means to blow to hit some hus to hit a child with a stick or some type of a instrument so jesus uh scourges or he chastens arms or is a little bit inflicts or punishes all of his children praise god to correct them right to teach them uh so uh i want to uh look at this here i want to just say this as well that for us we're calling it favor um but i want to just say to a blessing is always conditional uh it's always going to be conditional and it's always based upon god's foreknowledge of your obedience okay because god has to fore no god can't force anybody to heaven god can't force people to go to hell he has to give the three more agency so it's always based upon what god knows you're going to choose either obey or disobey so that that takes away all covetousness or jealousy right oh i'm jealous of that sister because all they do is get blessings well it's god knew that they would obey the word of god right so there's no reason to be jealous the bible said be happy for them right sharing their joy well that brother he's got so many blessings that uh i just i don't like him or something like that we shouldn't think that uh because god knew god's honoring their obedience praise god uh so it's something that we must always keep in mind god's blessing is gonna be based upon our obedience our free more agency okay so um and this is actually found i love this and i put this in the upcoming book by god's grace if the lord will help me i'm just waiting on get all the feedback back i've got it finished and just waiting on everybody else this is when abraham goes to sacrifice isaac but god provides a substitute in verse 16 by myself have i sworn saith the lord for because thou hast done this thing and has not withheld thy son thine only son that in blessing i will bless thee and multiply i will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is upon the seashore and thy seed shall possess the gates of the gate rather of his enemies and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou hast obeyed my voice remember god had already pronounced he'd already offered the blessings in chapter 12. remember when abraham was 75 he called him out said leave your country your kindred come to a place that i'll call you he said i'm going to bless you and but he but abraham had to prove worthy of that he had to meet the conditions of the blessing and god knew he would that's why he foreign knew him and he he called he knew he'd be abram and he knew he changed his name to abraham praise god amen god ordained that name he anointed abraham's father to call him abram you know and then abraham father of many nations and so it was based upon god's foreknowledge and it's a beautiful idea that god calls us and the children of god will be obedient to the word of god amen now uh in the message so amongst us uh we don't use the word curse very often do we like i've never heard anybody sister karen have you come to church i just feel cursed today i don't hear anybody use that word but i do hear people say i'm bound i'm struggling i'm feeding the black dog more than the white dog right uh i'm addicted uh i haven't been creating the right atmosphere this this is these are our words for curse right we're living under the punishment of god okay because i've never heard any of you say that how you doing today brother oh i'm real cursed today nobody nobody says that you know um and so i thought you know like wow how come we never heard a sermon called curses well because we don't use that word we use positive and negative right you know speak the word and never have a negative testimony in other words they're saying don't curse right don't speak curses with your mouth that's what it's really referring to and so uh in the message and we preach this all the time um we must find the cause to any curse right or any any addiction any box of rattlesnakes jesus you've accepted you gotta find the cause why did you accept it why did you let this into your mind right why didn't you cast it down why didn't you cast it out right why did you let it into your house or your life and so you got to find the cause to it jesus said that as well you gotta you let's sometimes we let evil thoughts in and it paralyzes the strong man and it spoils the house right the demons take out all the joy and all the blessings and all the victory and all all the blessings and we're left with no blessings well really we're under a temporary curse because of our own decision-making right or disobedience but the cause can always be found praise god i like that when the bible said when that uh uh when the uh the man uh i'm sorry when the prodigal he came to himself in the pigpen he finally came to himself and oh what was the cause of this oh i left my father's house and it's my fault i was i'm the guilty one but i can get out of this situation the father will surely make a way that i can get out of this situation amen see he knew i'm really not cursed i'm really blessed but it was my decision that caused me to be cursed but there's a way out let's go back to the father and repent praise god there's always a way out now look at this i found this good scripture i heard a preacher i'll mention him later derek prince he passed away but he's what a beautiful scripture oh sorry uh proverbs 26 2 as the bird wandereth as the swallow by fly so the curse causeless shall not come so in other words there's always a cause for a curse that comes right there's always a cause for a curse and that's what we got to find right if there's a problem let's find the cosmic that's what made brother branham's gift so different that's why he could only get to one at a time he had by the holy spirit he had to go down past just past the outer appearance he had to go down in their spirit realm and sometimes down into their soul realm to see are you even a christian yet right he said are you you ask him are you saved he sometimes he had to go down to the very he said if you'll repent and become a christian god will heal you of that uh that curse right or that ability whatever you have the sickness and but you know what brother amber always talks about you know he kind of beat himself up a little bit or roberts could just go through the prayer line right pray pray pray run them through pray pray pray they'd have many testimonies and bill abraham was concerned about it he said god should i be like oral roberts and the holy spirit said go just as you're led amen praise god so most of the time he just kept doing the discernment because that was the ability or robertson have that ability praise god no man or woman's had that ability so he he was led to do it that way because he had a special ability to find the cause of the problem and i've said this before any revival you go to where there's uh rejoicing or any service where there's anointing the it's always the same repentance is the key speaking the word and living the word amen because my wife and i have seen people go to camps uh come back saying they're filled with the holy ghost and just live like the devil so see they got the they're speaking the word but they never received the word right they felt the anointing on the body they were speaking it with their mouth and their mind but never got down to the soul praise god amen and i mean like divorces uh cigarette smoking drinking and movies and no church i mean that's what i mean like all the way the depths of satan just a full given over cursed life and come back from the youth camp saying they're born again a real saint of god can't do that because they're sealed into the kingdom of god and we're not you know we're not uh bashing anybody but we're looking at the the curses that exist around the message right it's it's up to you it's up to us right do we want blessings or curses it's up to us whatever we allow amen so see there is a cause for every curse now we'll get to the end as i preach a few weeks ago sometimes it's it's not like a curse sometimes it's a test and there may be no cause other than to humble you or give you a testimony okay so i'll just say that right away so we're aware of that right that's paul paul didn't do anything wrong but god said to humble you i'm going to let your eyes have eye trouble you're going to suffer and you're a satanic buffeting messenger from satan is going to dwell in your eyes and give you eye trouble not because of anything wrong you did but to keep you from getting prideful okay so see that he wasn't cursed right like we'd say for anything he did but he was afflicted in order to keep him humble it was a test of faith okay so i just want to let that be known right away first by god's grace and sometimes the saints of god do everything right they live right but then god has to give us a test a really hard tester trial to keep us humble or to produce something in our lives all right so i just want to bring this out too the true meaning of the blessing in deuteronomy 12. now god told moses i'm sorry abraham and i'll bless them that bless thee and curse them that curse thee and in these shall all families of the earth be blessed now we we look at this many times as a natural thing right oh god bless abraham's cattle god bless his family and his womb or his wife's womb and his seed and all these natural things but really this was speaking of justification this was speaking of forgiveness repentance this was speaking of salvation amen praise god it doesn't look like it right does that does anything in there look like water baptism to you no it just says blessed but paul picks this up in galatians 3 7 and he says know ye therefore they which are of faith the same are the children of abraham and the scripture foreseen that god would justify the heathen through faith preached before the gospel unto abraham saying in thee shall all nations be blessed amen see god interprets his word any way he wants praise god it just said you're all going to be blessed it didn't say justification the first time but god interprets that and god really makes us realize the greatest blessing there is is to be forgiven of your sins amen amen but you wouldn't know that by reading genesis 12 3 at least i didn't i don't know if some of you smart people caught it or not but i certainly didn't catch it i had to read that in galatians like wow god preached that god preached that to abraham god's the only preacher there is amen verse 9 so then they which are be of faith are blessed with faithful abraham did i go too fast no no okay i did all right now let's look at some kinds of curses here um like i said i'm only scratching the surface i haven't got to i maybe got to five of those old testament scriptures there's like 161 i only got to like five of them um now there's temp there's permanent curses like we know are for as you'll see the serpent cain unbelievers right permanent they're permanently cursed or permanently afflicted or uh punished right with uh in the lake of fire but you and i we're we're battling the temporary ones because we are blessed with eternal life how many god eternal life tonight amen now here can i hear a shout amen amen amen we got eternal life amen we're not cursed uh forever praise god god won't be upset forever right we've got eternal life and we'll be blessed but we've got to learn lessons and many times we're so stubborn we got to learn the hard way now let's look at some permanent ones i'm going to go through these kind of quickly because you're familiar uh god curses the serpent cursed above all cattle now he's been cursed ever since now i don't know if he's going to go back in the future home sister karen i don't know if god's going to turn the serpent back to having legs and we don't know that but he's cursed for quite a long time right so it looks like it's permanent i don't know maybe the uh maybe god will bring him back to his original state i don't know but then the ground is cursed that's permanent right until the future i'm sorry until the millennium so what i mean is just permanent a very long time okay uh next cain i believe thou art cursed from the earth and now look he this is what i love the bible calls it punishment here my punishment or my curse is greater than i can bear so cain sees he's punished he murdered his brother and all he cares about is himself he's not even caring about his brother what about me what about my punishment huck he's so selfish uh he said you're cursed from the earth and the ground won't bring forth you're a fugitive and vagabond uh he said my punishment is greater than i can bear jesus uh when he separates at the white throne judgment uh sheep from the goats depart from me he cursed and everlasting fire prepared for the devils and angels church god help us to uh feed the hungry right for i was hungry and you gave me no meat i was thirsty you gave me no drink now we can say that natural and spiritual right give somebody spiritual food like the church age book i was a stranger and you took me not in naked and you clothed me not sick and in prison and you visited me not okay and this is why they miss eternal life because they fail to have compassion in this life for someone who's hurting they only cared about themselves they were so selfish and so god said i'm cursing you punishing you and you'll cease to exist at some point because you've failed to help people on in this life may god help us praise god to help people peter says it as well their eyes are full of adultery now this is the balaam idea here the balaam group right which were borderline believers they believe for some blessings but then they turn away from the word uh he says full of adultery cannot cease from sin beguiling unstable souls see they they they're going down and they pull people down with them a heart they've exercised with covetous practice all they want to do is get other things that belong to other people for themselves and peter says they're cursed children which have forsaken the right way and are gone astray following the way of balaam the son of bosar who loved the wages of righteousness see church we've we gotta walk in the way of the word and we gotta love righteousness we have to love to obey he love to disobey we've gotta love obedience praise god that brings the blessing of god amen now let's look at some kinds of temporary boy i'm going through here pretty fast this might be a short sermon a little nervous here uh kinds of temporary curses actually we can spend a little bit time on this first one a little more time um there are the natural promised land blessings and curses they have a type and many of them have a spiritual application to the new testament and some of them are actually literal you know like some of these are some in other words some of the same blessings in the natural for the natural promised land exist for the spiritual promised land and i'll show you some simple examples that everybody can hopefully see by god's grace so you have those you have just general if if you say you're living in the promised land then we must obey if we want to be blessed praise god if we disobey we'll suffer we'll be punished now self-inflicted is where you curse yourself okay and hopefully nobody does that by god's grace um the man always said don't call yourself a weak christian that's cursing yourself right that's bringing that's inviting spirits right it's inviting spirits oh i'm weak so when satan hears you say you're weak then he brings the temptation you always fall to right or a new one that it's like the other one so that's it's inviting it's inviting evil spirits right we don't want to buy evil spirits we want to cast down evil spirits amen but there's numerous examples you'll see now there's authority figure curses usually dealing with husbands and fathers so husbands with wives and then uh fathers with children okay and sometimes people even say like preachers with congregations okay so there's so i gotta study more on all those but i think we i think we can see like a pretty common one like if we speak good about our children they'll turn out good but if we speak evil about our children they may turn out bad because we speak evil about them right it creates like we said creates the wrong atmosphere right they start believing a lie and then there's actual witchcraft curses which these people that do witchcraft curses are actually like professional sorcerers right they get paid for it like the tarot cards and then witches and they actually get paid for that uh like balak balak was trying to hire balaam now balaam never did it right he never could curse him because god said you're blessed israel but balak was into that he was a moabite so he was into sorcery he was inda we'd say we call it the occult there's actually that's a real thing right and those are curses church for my what i understand now these are always conditional and i'll say like this no one can curse an obedient child of god no one they can do whatever they want but you have a right they can say whatever they want but you've got a right to plead the blood of jesus christ amen and every one of his covenant blessings because if you're keeping his word then you're entitled to his favor amen praise god because you've honored him if you honor god god said i'll honor you amen amen so if you are under that if you're under the obedient blessings and something bad does happen then you know god had to allow it like we've heard like with job god had to allow it and so then you can rejoice you can still seek god for the understanding of why like paul did three times he prayed you imagine that three times why are my eyes why can't i see i must i love the word of god i'm a scholar i love this why can't i see i need to write the word of god you know three times he saw the lord and the lord finally gave the answer my grace is sufficient for you so see what does that teach us church sometimes one prayer god doesn't want to just talk to you one time sometimes he wants to talk to you more than that so keep praying about it right keep praying what does he like he likes that communion he likes that fellowship like jesus remember three times he went back in gethsemane three times do i have to take this cup and so we had that fellowship well here paul same thing three times and he gets the answer on the third time so don't let's not be discouraged i'll just be honest sometimes i pray for things and i forget to pray a second time now i'm still wondering sister karen in my mind why isn't god answered and then god has to bring like a sermon around or or to remind me oh you got to pray a second time oh keep praying about that keep praying keep seeking god because that means god wants your fellowship praise god he wants more of your time right because remember paul was going to get prideful unless jesus allowed this buffeting messenger to come and inflict his eyes he was going to get prideful so what does he need to avoid pride some honest prayer praise god he needs some pain in the body and some honest prayer now you won't hear a lot of amens on that one because nobody likes pain in the body which that's that's understandable but that's that's scriptural that is scripture job as well we know okay so there's there's numerous kinds now there could be more there's four right there and i put that fifth i just put a note on there there's actually there's could be more than that like i said i'm just kind of uh hitting the highlights tonight i just felt led uh to preach on this in fact amen and bang i think we talked about it last sunday night i think or was it two sundays ago we were talking about blessings and curses and so then yesterday i had a reminder pop up like four times studied blessings and curses and i'm trying to study the other one and and then all of a sudden i was uh looking at youtube and then the sermon came up i want to listen to about generational blessings and curses so i took that as like five or six voices study that studied that because it just kept coming and i've been wanting to do it for months and months and months i've said it before um so let's take your bibles let's do some good reading here and let's see how it's so it's amazing how many of these natural promised lands blessings are actually apply for the spiritual promised land as well now we know god doesn't deal with gentiles as a nation god deals with us as individuals right but we can still see though church we how many can still see god's mercy on america just for the saints that are here satan ultimately runs washington dc right ultimately but god is merciful to this nation what have we had 230 some years of 250 something years how old is our nation i'd like to do a little subtraction real quick 1776 to 2020. so to do some addition there but look at that look at the mercy of god he doesn't deal with us as a nation but he's letting our nation still be a city on a hill that cannot be hidden because of the few believers that still are here by god's grace i love that god always has his eyes on the remnant right even if everybody else amen is going off in sin as long as we live true to god god's eyes on the sparrow praise god his eyes on his people those that are making intercession and calling upon god god is seeking true worshipers amen amen who will worship him in spirit and in truth for the father secret such amen so if you got your bibles deuteronomy 27 actually i'm sorry yeah dude i'm 27 it ends with some curses so let's go through those and then we'll read through deuteronomy 28 this is the chapter of blessing and curses everybody a lot of people know that i guess scholars i knew about it before but then i forgot about it let's just go to deuteronomy 27. you get a good idea here now verses one to eight is where uh moses tells them to build uh the stones once they get in the promised land and and write the word of god on them and uh offer peace offerings and they got to be 12 whole stones and everything like that beautiful beautiful man they had the word they had their own tablets there see they had tablets of stone we got tablets of ipads and they had tablets of stone with the word of god written right on it verse 9 and moses and the priests the levites fake in all israel saying take heed and hearken o israel this day thou become the people the lord thy god thou shalt therefore obey the voice of the lord thy god and do his commandments and his statutes which i command thee this day and moses charged the people the same day saying there shall not i'm sorry there shall stand upon mount gerizim to bless the people i'm sorry these shall stand when ye are come over jordan simeon and levi and judah and issachar and joseph and benjamin and these shall stand upon mount evil to curse reuben gad and asher and zebulon dan and naphtali and the levite shall speak and say unto all the men of israel with a loud voice cursed be the man that maketh any graven image or molten image an abomination unto the lord the work of the hands of the craftsman and putteth it in a secret place and all the people shall answer and say right so brother man taught us the mantis it's not just a statue anything can be an idol anything that you worship and give more time to that and you try to draw strength from that that's the idol and look secret so see that's why secret sins are so it's so important to ask god to help us to cleanse our lives from secret sins because there's actually a curse upon anyone that would do that when they take idols and they bring it in and do it in secret there's actually a curse on that verse 16 cursed be the he that setteth light by his father or his mother i don't remember what that means and all the people shall say amen cursed be he that removeth his neighbor's landmark so this is with property and all the people shall say amen cursed be he that maketh the blind to wander out of the way and all the people shall say amen cursed be he that perverted the judgment of the stranger the fatherless and the widow and all the people shall say amen so we got to be careful how we we help people that's remember that's part of matthew 25. the people that get eternal life because they helped they gave food or water or else they like the spiritual food spiritual water judging the weak those that don't have a father don't have a mom don't have a spouse we have to support them verse 20. cursed me that lies with now we get into some sexual sins 20 to 23 he that lied with his father's wife because he hath uncovered his father's skirt and all the people shall say amen cursed be that life with any manner of beast and all the people shall say amen cursed me that lieth with his sister and the daughter of his father or the daughter of his mother and all the people shall say amen cursed me that lies with them his mother-in-law and all the people shall say amen cursed be he that smiteth his neighbor secretly and all the people shall say amen see they didn't want to do it publicly somebody could see it they wait till they're all alone and they basically curse somebody else right in the private right remember you can kill people with their your words too right you can smite them with your words secretly verse 25 cursed to be he that taketh reward to slay an innocent person like the hitmen right they hire hitmen uh and all the people shall say amen cursed be he that confirmeth not all the words of the law to do them and all the people shall say amen now that's the curse that paul said jesus jesus fulfills all these curses but that one especially they were cursed if they broke one of them right but not so with us right not so with us the bible said jesus took the curse of the law praise god right he took that curse of the law so if we fall short we're not totally cursed or punished right we're not we're not rejected from the covenant if we make a mistake we go to father and say forgive me cleanse me in your blood i i fell short i'm not gonna hide my sin i'm gonna confess my sin and you're gonna cleanse me and i'm gonna walk in the light as you're in the light amen okay chapter 28 this is beautiful let me see where okay so let's read one to 14. i know it's a lot of reading but this is good i remember reading this the first time i just kept underlining you know if you're blessed you're blessed you're blessed not and that was curse curse like there's i think there's 40 some curses from verses 15 there's more curses than blessings in other words uh well and we know why you know because man it was the law is the school teacher the law teaches us wow we are really sinful we need god living in our souls in order to overcome praise god that's what he's trying to teach us we can't do it on our own we've got to have jesus christ living in our soul praise god he must he must become our soul nature right he must fill us and seal us and circumcise the things of the world away and then we can walk like a true true child of god who walks by the spirit and not by the flesh deuteronomy 28 1 and this should come to pass if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the lord thy god that sounds familiar i preached this from someone's on that last year diligence right diligence that means eager eager to obey eager to hear what the preacher says right eager to put it into action if thou shalt hearken diligently into the voice of the lord thy god to observe and to do all his commands which i command you this day that the lord thy god will set thee on high above all the nations of the earth he's done that with america because there were so many believers right and the early founders or so many believers god did raise up america because remember it's like a anti-type of israel verse 2 i love this look at this man and all the blessings shall come on thee and overtake thee i'm just overtaken with blessings right that's really what a holy ghost christian can be i'm just caught up in all the blessings in church sometimes satan likes to distract us from being thankful for all of our blessings but if we look at our lives let's look honestly we are covered in blessings we you know your uh your cupboards are full right anybody got has anybody got any empty cupboards if so let me know after church we'll try to fill those with some canned goods and we'll try to but really many times we have so many blessings because god is faithful to his word he's honored your obedience when you diligently hearken unto him he honors your obedience because he's faithful and also like this the only time our children never lack anything is when dad forgets to go to the grocery store right or just too busy that's the only time we've ever lacked anything you know sometimes we run out of fruit and that you're like daddy you can go get fruit i'm like it's not because we don't have the money it's because dad don't have the time or don't make the time and that's that's what i would expect i would expect reading this chapter that if i've got the holy ghost and i'm living the promised land and god has diligently blessed me i'll lack nothing that's good i have everything i need because god has his favor upon me praise god because that's what he promised to do church you didn't make the covenant i didn't make the covenant god made the covenant amen and god is going to keep his word hallelujah i didn't start discovering it he brought he brought me he invited me to it praise god he's the one that did it so we have a right to believe it and to act upon it and expect god to back up his word and he surely does and the church said amen he surely backs up his word but it seems diligence in obeying and observing all the commands and then god's blessings will just overflow you like a flood if thou shalt hearken under the voice of the lord thy god you gotta hearken we gotta listen we gotta obey verse three blessed shalt thou be in the city and blessed shalt thou be in the field right so city life is that's where they would sell their goods right but the field is where they would plant their goods so wherever you plant or wherever you sell you're going to be blessed in both places verse 4 blessed shall be the fruit of thy body and the fruit of thy ground so your children and your crops and the fruit of the cattle the increase of thine kind and the flocks of thy sheep blessed shall be thy basket and thy store thy storehouses see you got lots in your baskets you got a lot in your storehouse why because you love god you you really you really care you're not about playing church you're about being the church amen right because you diligently hearken and you are the church you are god's bond jesus's body on this earth then he pours out his blessings on you because you're going to exalt you above everyone else praise god verse six mind this is beautiful ah yeah six blessed shalt thou be when thou comest in and when thou shalt be when thou goest out see when you come in the house when you leave the house verse seven the lord shall cause thine enemies that rise up against thee to be smitten before thy face they shall come out against thee one way and flee before thee seven ways in other words there's not going to be a battle you can't overcome if you diligently obey god's word in other words there's not going to be an enemy that just stays there week after week i can't defeat him i can't defeat it it's so hard no the bible says if you diligently hearken then that enemy is going to just go any other way it's it's gonna choose one of those seven ways right and it's gonna it's gonna flee before you right because god has made you an overcomer and because you're you're living by the power that god put inside of you you're taking his power acting upon it so all the enemies have to flee praise god and remember that ties in with i just scripture just came to me there resist satan and he'll flee so when the enemy comes it's not like hey enemy come on i'd like to try some of that or i like to i like to think about that i like to i like to act upon that i don't like to do that no it's resist the enemy then he flees amen right the same the same old uh new testament principle resist satan he'll flee we have that same promise today praise god amen they had it naturally we've got it spiritually there are times we have natural enemies don't get me wrong there's times there's times for war okay verse nine no i'm sorry verse eight the lord shall command the blessing upon thee and thy storehouses and in all that thou settest on hand to do and he shall bless thee in the land which the lord thy god giveth thee the lord shall establish thee and holy people unto himself and he has sworn unto thee if thou shalt keep the commandments of the lord thy god and walk in his ways and all people of the earth shall see that thou art called by the name of the lord and they shall be afraid of thee do you know which nation on earth has the most people trying to get in to become citizens america they're not lined up in russia right they're not lined up in china trying to get in they're not lined up and now maybe some of canada i don't know how many kids but the majority of them on a waiting list trying to get into this place praise god because of the freedom because of the laws that have established the godly laws that have been established in this nation oh i'm so thankful to live here by god's grace of course if god would have chose somewhere else i would have rejoiced in that too i still would have been an overcomer right no matter where you god would have placed you you would have been an overcomer praise god amen so we have to especially believe in you we in america we have to overcome that lukewarm spirit because we are we see rich and increased with goods we've got to truly overcome that and we got to depend on god more than we depend on anything else amen that so god chose us to do that amen so when we see the blessings increase we see the food increase and the clothes and and we see everything increase we don't get happy about that but we rejoice in what god has given to us but we also know god takes it away we'll still bless his name amen our confidence our trust is never in the blessings it's in the god of the blessings it's never in the natural things because remember paul told timothy he said teach those rich men not to trust in their riches because they're fleeting right they're fleeting do not trust in earthly riches but trust in the living god who's gracious to provide all things that we have need of amen all right now see that's why god's blessed america because of the commandments of the lord now look at verse 11 here it is the lord shall make thee plenteous in goods in the fruit of thy body and the fruit of thy cattle and in the fruit of thy ground in the land which the lord swear unt to thy fathers to give thee in the 1800s i can't i just read a book on it a couple well last year europeans visited the united states in the 1800s and they saw all the goods and they were blown away and they coined this term it's called american exceptionalism so the europeans right they had all the they had all the inventions before america had it right before the americans right so they come over in the 1800s you know they've been a country for less than 100 years and they want to see how they do it and this you can you can look it up look up american exceptionalism and all these european guys are like how are they doing they're doing more with less we have let we had less people in america we had less resources we found and now we're finding more like oil and all these all these great natural gas we're finding all kinds of resources here in america but in the 1800s we were doing more with less and the whole world had to uh admit it why because god said he said i will cause your goods to be plenteous if you diligently hearken unto my commands amen look it up it's called american exceptionalism israel's got the same thing going on today they have uh some of the most patents in in all the world this tiny little country with eight or nine million people that the most patents the the best technologies because god is on their side so i'm just like i said church i'm amazed at many of these natural blessings spoken to israel it's like god even applies them to natural nations in the new testament right even although we're not under the old covenant but yet a lot of these blessings seem to carry over and if we diligently hearken to the word of god god will provide everything amen everybody enjoying this tonight amen i hope so hope it's a blessing to your church it's been a great blessing to me verse 10 and all the all the purple all the people of the earth rather shall see that thou art called by the name of the lord and they shall be afraid of thee verse 11 and the lord shall make thee plenteous and goods and the fruit of thy body okay the fruit of thy cattle fruit of thy ground the lamb which the lord swear unto thy fathers to give thee the lord shall open i love this unto thee his good treasure the heaven to give the rain unto thy land in his season and to bless all the work of thine hand and thou shalt lend unto many nations and thou shalt not borrow boy we really struggled there right that's what that's one area america struggled in right with uh was it now 20 trillion in debt i can't remember how much it is there so it's interesting this is so interesting god blesses many of our natural things but then with this disobedience he's caused us to borrow so that's that's uh interesting now good treasure i like it that's the good treasure the good treasure is the rain right and the crops and everything but the bible says now we have treasure in earth and vessels the word of god written upon the fleshly tables of our hearts amen god's treasure living in you and i the god's presence that holy spirit that you feel the love that you feel the peace that you feel that's god's treasure for you and i amen treasurer's not up on a shelf right the treasure's in your soul amen that's spiritual treasure now 13 and 14 is where the where we end with the blessings and the lord shall make thee the head and not the tail now the one preacher i like derek prince he says the head makes the decisions the tales just drug around for the ride and he says are you making the decisions or do you feel like you're being drug around i'm i'm a slave to this i'm a slave to that now we all feel like slaves to work but we got to work right you know we all got to work i beg god i beg god for millions of dollars so i don't have to work and i can just preach full time i beg god for different things but i see his blessing in my current life praise god i've just kind of asked the immature prayers i'll say like that but see he says when you're a believer and you diligently obey you're not the tail you're not getting drug around you're the head i like this because the bible says you redeem the time see when you're the head you determine what happens throughout the day you don't get drugged around by you know your work doesn't determine your your spiritual relationship with god you determine it praise god that's why you put god first right that's why you got a morning routine while you seek the lord first because if not then you're a slave you're being dragged around by your schedule instead of you taking the work around and determine what's going to happen the rest of the day because you started the day in his presence amen hallelujah praise god you're the head not the tail you're the head see you you're led by the holy spirit right you you give god preeminence you put god first you make the decision this is how the day is going to go by god's grace unless something happens i'm going to put god first seek god first this is how it's going to go and thou shalt be above only and thou shalt not be beneath ever feel like you're so that's when we when we get and cursed as we get out of the will of god we feel like we're underneath everything we're just we're just everything's piled on top of us right everything's just but when you're walking obedience you're on top of it praise god you're on top of the problems you're on top of your responsibility see that you're not under the weight of them but you're ruling over them praise god amen i like that church what promises now who wants to be the tail in here and who wants to be underneath the weight of all these burdens who wants to be on the bottom ring you know if we have the ability to be on top if we have the calling to be the head let's let's live it let's do it let's live like we ought to live as a real christian let's possess the promises of god amen this is for promised land people though amen this is this is for promised land this is the people that are possessing the land praise god the lord will make you the head not the tail you'll be above not below if if thou see the if if thou hearken unto the commandments of the lord thy god which i command you this day to observe and do them and thou shalt not go aside from any of the words which i command thee this day to the right hand or the left to go after other gods to serve them praise god now i want to skip ahead the curses are here but i want to out uh 15 to 68 we're not going to go through all these i want to skip ahead i remember being before the message brother amen i was a christian i remember listening to john piper he's like a he's a reformed preacher kind of like a baptist i'm not sure exactly which denomination he goes to but i remember him preaching these verses and it just it shocked me even before the message i was shocked to hear this god was gonna curse israel if they didn't serve him with joyfulness and gladness of heart there's something to be said for being happy right if you're not happy you're probably not in contact with god you've shut him out of fellowship because god is god curses israel because they didn't come to church with joy and gladness right they they didn't serve they didn't wake up every day and say thank you lord hallelujah i'm so grateful for these blessings they're cursed because of their attitude their rotten attitude may god help us to be positive praise god count our blessings but look at this these i remember these i remember buying the cd i mailed it in i think it was before the internet or maybe right after the internet started but i mailed in and bought these cds i listened to them i was shocked by what i heard this man look at verse 44 he shall lend to thee and thou shalt not lend to him he shall be the head and thou shalt be the tail see we don't want to do that verse 45 moreover all these curses should come upon me and shall pursue thee and overtake thee until thou be destroyed because thou hearkenest not unto the voice of the lord thy god to keep his commandments and his statutes which he commandeth thee and they shall be upon thee for a sign and a wonder and upon thy seed forever that's really serious that's your children right that's from generation to generation for those that disobey god's word verse 46 i'm sorry verse 47. here it is right here why did they fall into this curse because thou service not the lord thy god with joyfulness and with gladness of heart [Music] i don't know if you got to wake up and just put on a happy song but you and i need to be happy they're cursed imagine not only them church but their children are cursed all because they stop seeing the joy in god's word there's so much joy in here every all the i mean there's a couple pages of curses right but a lot of this thing is blessings look you go to that blessing james and corinthians and acts i mean look at all these blessings but because of their attitude all they saw was struggle and all they saw was god with a stick like they say all right i don't mean to say that with the wrong attitude but people that leave the message god programs god just carried a big stick he does carry mixtape but he also carries a lot of blessings in the other hand right he also carries a lot of great blessings he's got a storehouse and with that other hand i think he opens the storehouse and he pours out all the blessings with that hand he's got the stick in the other one he does because thou servants not the lord thy god with joyfulness and with gladness of heart this is for the promised land people for the abundance of all things amen you got how many got lots of clothes in their house a couple of you okay how many got lots of food on your in your house and sometimes we're low but most of the time we got it i got lots of how many got money in the bank so you can pay off some bills so the bible says if you have an abundance we must be joyful and have a glad heart just just because of abundance praise god the very fact that you have plenty of things should make you happy and joyful praise god and we all battle it right we all battle feeling sorry for ourselves um i told you this before but i remember crying when we bought the house because we had a garage i just cried oh i thought i never thought i'd have a garage all the blessings you know and then we fixed our downstairs i remember crying when i went into my prayer closet we got i got my own office now my own room you know to study and preach it was just it was just amazing i never thought i'd have something like that but that shouldn't make me prideful and arrogant and want more it should make me want more of god amen then you want to obey more of god's word and serve him with joyfulness and gladness of heart i'm going to tell about amen amen said he couldn't fall asleep last night to what 4 am and he don't tell me these things because he knows i'm going to tell him he couldn't fall asleep till 5am he was so excited to come to church today now that's i pre and i know you didn't share it with me for that reason but i thought mine that's what we all need right that first love that joyfulness and in church i was watching him sing tonight you know you see that big ol i love that that makes me smile we should be thank we should have joyfulness and gladness of heart for the abundance that all that god's done for us this makes me think by the man when you were kind of like a stranger i took you into my house you know and now maybe god can have you and your wife do that sometime you know because you got kicked out of his house he couldn't live with my wife tonight and the kids there but he wasn't a stranger but you know we took him in that's we want to have like that idea all the time and we want to be able to see who's hungry who's thirsty who needs a place to stay we want to have that love we want to have that love for mankind because we're so blessed we have such an abundance we want to be able to help other people have what they need praise god because you didn't serve god with joyfulness gladness of heart for the abundance of all things verse 48 therefore shalt thou serve thine enemies if you will not serve god for all the blessings you'll serve your addictions that's what is for us today right you'll serve that you will not lord over it and rebuke it and overcome it you'll serve it because you lost your let satan's take your joy right satan took your gladness your joy therefore thou shalt serve thine enemies which the lord thy god shall send against thee in hunger and thirst nakedness does that sound like matthew 25 wow i just caught that right you fed me when i was hungry when i was thirsty and closed me when i was naked look at that my goodness and in want of all things so because we don't thank god for the abundance of all things and we can't even be happy about the natural blessing god said i'm taken all away and you're gonna suffer because you can't be thankful for the natural blessing i'm thankful for your job or your husband's job or your wife's job how many thankful for all that amen joyfulness gladness of heart lord for the abundance of all the things you've given to me thank you lord i'll serve you with joy i'll gladly go to church two times a week or three times a week or whatever i'll gladly do that because of all that you've done for me hallelujah praise god and he shall put a yoke of iron upon thy neck see uh uh what's the word i'm looking for addiction slave upon thy neck until they have destroyed thee verse 49 the lord shall bring a nation against the uh the from far from the end of the earth and as swift as the eagle flag that was speaking of babylon a nation whose tongue thou shalt not understand how many can see how this is a pretty serious thing how many can see this in people's lives in your life too certainly certainly here's a quote i read this morning if people didn't have a chance to come back to second service the preacher said this i thought it was so beautiful really you don't need to chase the blessings and who says i don't quote people other than brother branham really you don't need to chase the blessing he said what you need to do is meet the conditions right don't that's why church the morning routine is so important you gotta we gotta put god first in the morning like if if you put him first and make sure you have joy and gladness of heart everything else is gonna take care of itself god said i'm gonna have the blessings overtake you he didn't say you're gonna go over take the blessing he said the over oh the blessings are going to overtake you they're going to come searching for you like the goodness of god we sing god's goodness is just running after me praise god amen i just didn't realize that's all right now that's what the song's talking about the blessings overtake you praise god they're coming after me all the time praise god oh my we just refinanced our house and we got another check in the mail just unexpectedly you know the blessings are just running after us just running after us just god's mercy but i got to be careful right i got to keep the right attitude lord you give and you take away blessed be the name of the lord see we just got to chase i'm sorry we don't chase the blessing you got to chase god in prayer in the morning just meet the conditions god will take care of the blessings i know that was such a beaut when i heard that i was like what i thought i got to write that down so i emailed to myself i thought you'd really appreciate that now let me close with this i'm already at about an hour you still enjoying it all right good i feel good spirit in here tonight fairies god every night uh now there's just a few in here i thought i'd pull out okay uh but just the next slide there are exceptions like i talked about the beginnings i don't wanna i don't wanna act like there's never exceptions right like remember david said i'm promised three score in 10 years if i obey god that's 70 years and maybe 80 if god's merciful but jesus only lived 33 and a half right because he had a he had an exception there was exception to that god had a certain testimony for his life so i don't want to always put it off like oh it's just always a picnic serving god but you know apparently church if we read our bibles there's going to be some good times if we obey god we're not going to be lacking clothes food work we're gonna have everything we need by god's grace you mean god can feed eight children in 2020 you mean that oh yeah yeah he's mighty he's mighty to save i've been talking to people lately i remember the hmong thing i met a mom that had 11 kids i'm like i said bless your heart sister i said you're one of the most obedient women i know to that command she's like thank you eleven uh so it's not all picnic right there's still battles but see after the battle we enjoy the victory praise god like abraham after the battle he fellowships with melchizedek amen oh glory hallelujah after jesus battled satan he got visitation from angels and he enjoyed the blessings of god so health is pointed out church specifically in deuteronomy 28 21 now this says if they disobey they have pestilences and think about the coronavirus you know remember sometimes god it says verse 21 the lord shall make the pestilence cleave unto thee until they have consumed thee from off the land wither thou goes to possess it tim pruitt i'll share this quick tim pruitt shared a testimony there's families in his church that went to a family doctor he the man was a sinner he used to cuss but when chronovox came that doctor who cussed he got coronavirus and he died six times and each time when he died they were able to bring him back and so eventually he was in a coma the doctor woke up and he said the first thing he told the other doctor was hey i saw my brother come to me six times in visions and tell me to repent of my sins and he did and then the doctor told him you died six times and jesus was giving you a chance at eternal life i'll say like this six chances and brother tim brewer said the families went back to his practice and instead of hearing the rock and roll of the office it's piano jesus instrumental and then they walk in instead of greeting the doctor and he's custom swearing it's god bless you how are you today see there's curses right sometimes these curses turn out to be blessings the pestilence it claimed i don't know how long he was sick i can't remember from tim pruitt's testimony in the families in the church there but he died six times each time god sent him out repent repent and then finally wakes up and he repents i'll talk about grace church i just thought i'd share that with you to see god is still saving people and remember the message this morning remember the plum tree in the apple tree i told that story sister karen this morning but i saw the vision of the two trees right one was trinity one one was oneness brother ram said i was catching the fruits and rejoicing at all the souls saved that were trinitarians he said it was so glorious he said he was hugging the cross but he woke up from the vision thank god for thank god that foolish virgins will be saved amen it makes it makes him want to hug the cross just for somebody one person to say i'm sorry jesus and they might not know everything we know but it makes brother i am rejoicing when i hug the cross thank you for the cross that anybody could be saved no matter what you believe as long as you repent except jesus christ you can be saved it ought to make us rejoice too so health is a result you lose it right it's a blessing but it's a you lose it and then john 3 1 12 says i would above all that to prosper and be in health as your soul prospers right so as as we get stronger brothers and sisters as we get stronger in our souls our bodies should remain healthy too right i'm seeing growth in my soul i'm seeing more devotion to god i'm seeing more love to god and then we should also see the same in our body i'm bringing my body into more obedience to the word of god amen to that finances and plenty we saw in verses 8 11 through 12 reproduction with children deuteronomy 8 4 i'm sorry was it 28 for yeah the fruit of your body now today a lot of people want to have abortions right or have surgery so they don't have to have all these blessings but god said it was a blessing god said it was a blessing mercy goodness uh and all your work he said all your work will be blessed like i like karen's testimony about that amazon job fits her schedule fits right in the family helps the family provides the needs of the family i thought that was such a good thing god god specializes who would have thought that god would have done that you know you can work if you get done early it's like you're making extra money there's just so many blessings our god is bountiful and he's gracious and he wants to pour it out it will diligently harp into his voice now here's some exceptions real quick so we're trying to close but i'm having a hard time closing here so church exceptions exist for testing or testimonies not because you're cursed right so the health the exception is paul with his eyes already went over through i already went over that a couple wednesdays ago and just earlier today paul tried to say lord heal me my body my health should prosper just like my soul and jesus says no this is to keep you humble now finances and plenty i used to always think a christian should never beg but then i read the bible and lazarus was a banker and lazarus received bad things in his life but then jesus said when he got to there to abraham's bosom then he got the good things so there god i'll say this god needs a beggar to overcome right we're not told sister karen if he if he did anything wrong we're not told if he quit his job we're not told if his wife passed away our children right we're not told if his boss died we're not all we know is that he was a beggar and he was a child of abraham praise god so see and then paul paul said i've got one cloak now that was in second timothy but here he says i know what it's like to hunger i know it's like to have nothing he said but i'll be content in everything praise god because i can do all things through christ who strengthens me and then reproduction there's our exceptions paul said some people are just single right paul's singleness was an exception to that he wasn't called to have children for some reason and then all work yeah maybe with lazarus above okay let me find a place to close here um i think i'll just go to the what i want to finish with because the other ones i think i can uh well here let's go to this one let's go to speaking curses because that's one we got to be careful of okay we'll do this and then we'll close with the jesus takes away every curse so church jesus tells us to bless our enemies not to curse them so the new testament is mostly dealing with curses with our words we're not supposed to curse people or harm them with our words right and then he says he says but there are times we may curse things like jesus curse the fig tree and then i have lots of quotes i'm not going to share every night but brother ram will curse cancer in someone he'll curse it in the prayer line or he'll curse the female trouble he'll curse it because children of god have power to do that right and command that life he said i command that cancer to leave so jesus says love your you said you've heard it said love your enemy hatred i'm sure i love your neighbor hate your enemy but i say to you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you that ye may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh the sun to rise on the evil and the good instead of the rain on the just and the unjust and the church said i'm almost done here james but the tongue can no man tame it's an unruly evil full of deadly poison there with we bless god and even the father we curse men which are made after the similitude of god out of the same mouth proceedeth blessings and cursings my brethren these things ought not so to be let's make sure we're blessing people praise god we bless god we say oh praise the lord let's make sure we keep blessing our enemies as well here's where here's where jesus said uh verily i send you if you have faith and doubt not ye shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree so you can curse things right but also if you shall say to this mountain be thou removed and cast in the sea it shall be done so it's kind of like you're cursing the mountain kind of like that but you're just commanded to lead i just heard a new uh revelation on that fig tree uh jesus didn't curse it because it was out of season jesus cursed it because before the actual fruit came on i guess there's like a little bud that has to come first and so jesus saw because there was no buds on the tree it's basically like a dead tree so then he cursed it because it didn't have that initial bud right jesus wouldn't curse something for nothing right it was didn't it failed to even bring forth that first bud right and that's let's bring forth more than justification church come on let's bring more than sanctification let's produce the baptism of the holy holy ghost and let's produce real fruit to the holy spirit that we're blessed he said what sort of things you desire or ask in prayer believing you shall receive uh yeah so just real quick there's a whole list of other things but the main thing church if you sense a curse is i'm afflicted or i'm a slave or i'm something like this and i'm not seeing the blessing i'm not abundant in my life satan needs to be exposed and you have to resist him and then diligently hearken and obey that's the only way to get god's blessings let's stand to our feet here what's the cure for every curse jesus christ is the cure for every curse cursing is everyone remember here's what we read earlier right paul says we know this curse but no but that no man is justified by the law in the sight of god for it is evident that just shall live by faith the law is not of faith the man that doeth them shall live therein thank god there's more to this christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law being made a curse for us so i'll say like this the curse is gone jesus took it there's no more curse for you and i praise god we just get the blessing that he purchased praise god for it is written cursed is everyone that hangeth on a tree church you haven't have a right to say that i'm not cursed because jesus took my curse he took it he paid the penalty for my for that curse that was belong to me but jesus paid it and he set me free praise god why that the blessing not the curse that the blessing of abraham might come on bride of christ fellowship through jesus christ that we might receive the promise what is the blessing really the baptism of the holy ghost the promised land the promise of the spirit through faith revelation assurance trust in the will of god brother ram says he's praying when i see the token i'll pass over you it's a sign it's a sign that the price has been paid jesus paid the price and you receive it from him holding the token in your hand you have an assurance of resurrection you have the assurance that everything you have need of in this journey is provided in this token of his suffering at calvary when he met the price of every curse that could be put on you so i don't care what people try to put on us i don't care i really don't i don't care what any curse someone tries to put on me i'm blessed because i've got the token praise god i got the blessing of abraham the token he paid the price for every curse it can put on you that token speaks peace it speaks blessing not curse musicians if you'll come here i'll stop right there i gotta like i said i got a whole lot more slides there but let me stop for your sake our sake hope you enjoyed that by god's grace i think that's just such a beautiful thought [Music] really makes everything simple doesn't he we don't have to worry about the blessings and how the blessings are going together how am i going to have enough how is this going to don't you don't worry about that you don't chase the blessings you just meet the conditions and then god takes care of the blessings let's buy our heads for a moment here serving him with joyfulness and gladness of heart you know i had a i had a i'll say it like this i think it's the nicest way to say it i had a brand of worshiper text me this week and and say uh oh we're not servants you know we're we're the bride and we're not servants jews are servants he's us he's misunderstanding that quote and so i sent him a numerous scriptures where the bible says with my mind i serve god the law of my mind i serve god and paul says we don't we're not ones that serve our belly he said but we serve our lord jesus christ so see church yeah we're the bride right now we're serving right right now we have a service we have responsibilities to do and we need to do it with joyfulness and gladness of heart so as we bow our heads okay if you can you can stop the livestream as we bow our hearts we don't have to worry about anybody seeing our hands we bow our heads here
