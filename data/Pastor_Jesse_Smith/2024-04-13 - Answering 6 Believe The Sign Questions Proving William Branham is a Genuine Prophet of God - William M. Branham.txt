TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] what about the people that believe in the Lord now and don't and not the way you preach they don't have to believe this they don't have to believe the way I preach it see don't have to believe that but those who can accept the word in its fullness not me preaching it because it's a Bible sessle greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to answer respectfully a challenge from the believe the sign YouTube channel and the challenge was to answer their six simple questions so I'm going to do that now by the grace of God hi friends I'm Jesse Smith pastor bride of Christ Fellowship here in akan Ohio USA and I defend the bible-based ministry of God's Prophet The Late William brandham 1909 to 1965 Jesus Christ revealed Revelations to brother brandham and also defend brother bram's Godly character so by God's grace I'll give six brief answers to these questions the believe the sign website said they have asked a couple of really simple questions which have never been answered by message ministers or message Believers so by God's grace let's answer them number one can you please show us where William brandham is Vindicated as a prophet of God scripturally yes that's easy to do by God's grace uh one video I have goes over five requirements of a genuine prophet of God here's the screenshots you can see it requirements of a genuine prophet and this is from the video three Prophecies of William brandham it's my sixth video it was released October 4th 2014 I'll leave a link in the description to this so requirement one he had to live a Godly life of Holiness and that brother random did he taught the word of God in its Purity that he did had converts to Christ as fruit of his ministry that he did and number four is really important reveal secrets from the Bible that were previously hidden according to Amos 37 brother random certainly did this the main Secrets brother random revealed through Jesus Christ were the revelation of the Seven Seals of course and I have multiple videos about this subject and I proved by God's grace there's over 38 differences between brother ROM's Revelation from Jesus Christ on the Seven Seals compared to the teachings of Clarence Larin Charles T Russell and Uriah Smith and of course this is the information that believe the sign will ignore for example with the first seal believe the sign says brother random plagiarized it that's a lie Clarence Lin said the first seal is during the Great Tribulation period which is still yet in the future brother Ram said the first seal started at the beginning of the New Testament Church nearly 2,000 years ago so any honest person knows brother Ram did not plagiarize the Seven Seals in fact there's only one seal that brother brandom had the same as Lin and that's the Sixth Seal also my 2021 book The 12 New Testament Mysteries shows many more secrets that Jesus Christ revealed to brother brandham and of course to fulfill Revelation 10:7 to finish the mysteries of God and then the fifth requirement for a prophet was having the anointing of the Holy Ghost for Supernatural signs and prophecies brother Bram had many Supernatural testimonies of healings and prophecies regarding prophecies there was at least six prophecies brother R spoke in the name of Jesus Christ or in the name of the Lord that have come to pass it is undeniable brother random was a genuine prophet of God and I put that video out on August 23rd 202 3 6 thus sayith the Lord statements from William brandom that have come to pass it's video number 173 question number two why did William brandom change his mind and his doctrines through his ministry on topics such as the Trinity and water baptism and the verbal formula or formula that's simple you know 2 Peter 3:18 says but grow in Grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ so every Christian grows in Grace and grows in the knowledge of the Lord Jes Jesus Christ and the man who wrote this Peter he definitely grew in Grace and knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ even though he was called by Jesus to be an apostle while Jesus was alive on this Earth and then of course got the holy ghost in the book of Acts chapter 2 and then ministered for Jesus Christ the rest of his days and Peter of course grew in Grace and knowledge of the lord we see that in Galatians Chapter 2 where Peter had separated himself from fellowshipping with the Gentiles and he was already a holy ghost filled man he was already a prophet and of course this will get into an answer to a future question as well but every believer grows in Grace and knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ that's what Jesus Promised in John 16:13 when the spirit of Truth is come he will guide you into all truth so once the Holy Ghost comes upon a person they're born again the Holy Ghost will guide them into all truth and again we see that through the life of Peter of course so brother Ram had to change his mind because the Holy Ghost was revealing more truth to him just as St Peter and Jesus said would happen regarding the Trinity though the Trinity is a false Doctrine it wasn't started by the apostles it was started over 300 years after the apostles or around 300 years I've got an entire video on that so I'll put a link in the description for that and the Trinity Dogma adds to the word of God so that's a lie that's false Doctrine that's heresy and God revealed to brother brandham that God is one person not three persons there is no verse that says God is three persons in fact Hebrews 1:3 says Jesus is the express image of the person of God there's only one person in the godhead that's according to the Bible furthermore again in my book The 12 New Testament mysteries from 2021 I show brother Brandon restored 14 Pauline doctrines that most churches miss or teach falsely about so brother raham turn the hearts of the children back to the apostolic fathers also eight of those doctrines have thus sayith the Lord behind them so of course because these doctrines are true brother Rams thus say the Lord's statement gives Authority and validation that these doctrines are right they're part of the apostolic faith the original Faith it's the one faith that we must earnestly contend for according to the book of Jude verse three I also want to say I hope brother Rams accusers are not asking this question with a self-righteous attitude acting like they know it all and they don't have anything to learn I'm sure each one of brother Ram's accusers have something to learn about the Bible it's obvious they do because they falsely accuse brother brandom they don't understand true Bible Doctrine and they don't understand all the scriptures about conditional Promises of God among other things so please accusers of brother brandham please don't be self-righteous and act like you don't learn anything and you know it all already because you don't numerous times brother brandham said anyone who claims to know it all is wrong brother brand plainly said he didn't know all things he didn't have all the answers and anyone that said they had all the answers was wrong I don't know I I if I don't know I'm just going to tell you I don't know see I I don't I don't know all the answers folks I I don't know and if I don't know I'm going to tell you I don't know if I do know I won't tell you till I do know see but I I don't know when you hear a prophet Rising that's got all the answers to every gimmick that you can bring up remember he's not a prophet amen today they've got to know everything when you're going to have a tooth AE when you're going to have a tummy ache and everything else and tell you all about it that isn't the nature of our God watch the prophets watch Jesus question number three can someone who claims to be a prophet of God have prophecies and visions that have failed to come to pass the answer is no and brother random had no failed Visions or prophecies now friends I made a long video about the brown bear Vision how it was a conditional promise of God so I'm not going to repeat all those teachings I taught on that video so please go watch that video if you want to understand more about this some prophecies and Visions are conditional others are unconditional any Bible reader knows that on the video I show how God can interpret his word his Visions or his prophecies in any way he wants I show 10 Bible truths about visions and conditional promises again friends that's 10 Bible truths about visions and conditional Promises of God the accusers of brother brandham are not gifted with the Holy Ghost to interpret the word of God for us they teach many false doctrines and some of them that talk about brother brandham aren't even preachers so they don't have a gift to rightly divide the word of God so they shouldn't be trusted with their false teachings and their slander and then towards the end of that video the brown bear Vision Video I show brief responses to other accusations such as the India Africa vision of 300,000 it was most likely fulfilled in brother branham's 1954 Bombay India trip because the Bombay mayor estimated around half a million people so was probably an exaggeration so that's probably when the 300,000 were there in brother bram's meetings the tth vision was most likely fulfilled when brother brandham preached the Seven Seals in March of 1963 I gave seven important points about the seven major Visions brother brandham had in 1933 and then I spoke about the Ohio Municipal River Bridge prophecy brother Ram's accusers cannot prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that this did not happen because they were not there physically they cannot exalt government records as the absolute if you make government records the absolute then Moses was a fictional character Moses never performed the Exodus and brought Israel out of Egypt if you go by Egypt's government records and Fifth and finally the February 28th Arizona Cloud I made a video about this recently I made a video on July 11th 2023 about that the February 28th 1963 Arizona Cloud four reasons I believe it's a four reasons I believe it's of Supernatural origin video 161 I'll leave a link in the description by God's Grace all right question number four was can someone who claims to be a prophet of God teach that which directly oppose scripture and the answer is yes but of course it will be nothing major it won't be a major sin as the Bible differentiates major and minor sins I made a video about that recently so you can watch that video if you like as well I'll leave links in the descriptions I believe it was a two-part series if I'm not mistaken but the Bible example in Galatians Chapter 2 with St Peter Galatians 2:11 said Peter was to be blamed and Paul withstood him to the face because he withdrew himself from the Gentiles and he caused others to do it as well such as Barnabas and other Jews that's in Galatians 21-14 so yes and Peter was a prophet Peter foretold the day of the Lord in 2 Peter chapter 3 burning with fervent heat Peter saw Visions read acts chap 10 Peter was a genuine prophet of God and so on a minor subject yes a prophet could teach something that was directly opposed to scripture but of course the Holy Ghost would bring correction and that's what God did for brother brandham the Holy Ghost gave understanding to brother brandham as he approached the end of his ministry God finished the mysteries of God through brother brandham and all the major doctrines were taught scripturally by the grace of God number five can someone who claims to be a prophet of God lie in the name of the Lord the answer is no a genuine prophet of God cannot lie in the name of the Lord and brother brandham never lied in the name of the Lord I've been studying brother bram's Ministry since the end of 2001 I've been preaching brother bram's Ministry since the beginning of 2004 I've never seen brother Bram lie in the name of the Lord that's because brother Bram was a genuine prophet of God feel free to leave comments on this video if you have specific questions about statements I'll be happy to answer that as soon as I can get time for it by God's grace the only lying that's really going on is brother R's accusers lying about brother brandham slandering brother brandham jumping to false conclusions about brother brandham and they lie and slander and make presumptions all while harboring evil spirits because they've accepted false doctrines which are seducing spirits and I recently put out two videos about that the dangers of leaving the message from February 27th 2024 and March 2nd 2024 called the dangers of leaving the message of William brandham plus Jesus revealed the bible message to brother brandham and a great video to go along with this is the January 27th video 2024 the bride has hundreds of differences from all other churches absolute Bible proof we are Jesus's bride so again the same people that are accusing brother brandom of lying they're the ones lying about brother brandham they say brother brandham had no prophecies that came to pass I have a video proving there's at least six there's another Pastor here in the US working on finding more individual prophecies that were spoken to sick people and they were healed by the grace of God he had is over 10 so I look forward to digging into that maybe later this summer if the Lord allows by God's grace and six and finally where scripturally is it that the New Covenant relationship with Jesus Christ requires a gentile Prophet there is no Bible verse that says a person is required to recognize a gentile Prophet to have a relationship with Jesus Christ it's sad you know some of these accusers of brother brandham they left churches that were really sinful message churches they should not be called message churches but they're sinful churches and some of these sinful churches have false doctrines like this where you have to know about brother brandom in order to be saved that's a lie you have to know about the Gospel of Jesus Christ in order to be saved and Jesus says there's wise and foolish virgins so wise virgin churches are born again with the baptism of the Holy Ghost in their soul and they know about the prophetic Ministry of William branam but foolish virgin churches can still be virgin to the word of God they can still be saved but they'll be unaware of God's prophetic Ministry in this hour in other words they're ignorant of the bible-based ministry that God gave to William Brenham but they can still be saved of course because Jesus says there are two kinds of Christians wise virgin and foolish virgin Matthew 25 1-13 now if brother bram's accusers really want the verses that tell about a gentile Prophet all have to do is read Revelation 10 verse 7 says the mystery of God is finished and then if you read verses 8- 11 this message has to be taken to all the Gentiles this clearly shows brother brandham was a gentile prophet and his message would go to the gentile people because Jesus said in Luke 21:24 that Jerusalem would be Trot in under until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled then if you connect that with Romans 11:25 God will be with the Gentiles until the fullness of the Gentiles become in so Revelation 10:7 has to be a gentile Prophet because his message goes to the Gentiles Revelation 11 shows how there's two Jewish prophets that only minister to Israel you can see that in Revelation 11 and also in Zechariah 4 more verses include Acts 3: 20 and 21 it speaks of the restitution of all things Jesus will remain in Heaven until everything is restored or the restitution of all things the temple Institute people there in Israel helping restore Israeli Believers back to the Mosaic law so the 144,000 Jews will already be restored back to the law they're going to need the two prophets to point them to Jesus Christ so this scripture speaking of the restitution of all things has to be to the Gentile Church ages because it's the church ages that need restored to the book of Acts truths the book of Acts Foundation same is mentioned in Matthew 1711 and 12 Jesus said Elijah truly shall first come and restore all things this has to be a gentile Anointed with the spirit of Elijah because again the Elijah that comes with the spirit of Moses in Revelation 11 is only to Israel they're only dealing with Israel because God will only deal with Israel after the fullness of the Gentiles become in again according to Luke 21:24 and Romans 11:25 then of course Malachi 4:5 and6 Malachi 4:6 says John the Baptist turned the heart of the fathers to the children that's found in Luke 1:17 and then the second part of verse 6 Malachi 4 says turning the heart of the children to their fathers John the Baptist turned the hearts of the Believers at the time of Jesus's first coming and so then God needed a gentile Prophet with the spirit of Elijah for the people at the end time time to turn their hearts back to the apostolic fathers and this is true because the Elijah in Revelation 11 will not turn the hearts of Israel back to their fathers he's going to turn them to Jesus Christ the Elijah in Revelation 11 is not going to turn them back to Moses he's going to turn them back to Jesus Christ Luke 17:30 takes a little more understanding the son of man would be revealed in the last times when it was like the days of Noah and Sodom clearly we can see those conditions on the Earth today violence on the earth and sodomy taking over Jesus's son of man or prophetic Ministry already ministered to the Jews and Samaritans but it never ministered to the Gentiles so Jesus had to come in the form of a prophet a gentile Prophet to show the Gentiles the son of man prophetic ministry as well and of course God did that through brother bram's Ministry brother Bram was a man a sinner saved by grace but his prophetic discernment gift was a form of the son of man Jesus's prophetic Ministry to the Gentiles what about the people that believe in the Lord now and don't and not the way you preach they don't have to believe this they don't have to believe the way I preach it see don't have to believe that for the last day message will they be saved yes if they believe the Lord see and if they they disagree and say I don't believe he's the word I don't believe that this is right I don't believe in the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's shows where they're headed for the tribulation period but those who can accept the word in its fullness not me preaching preaching it because it's a Bible says so those who accept that is free because the word's already been judged in closing friends I hope this video was a help by God's grace I just thought I would make a brief response to these questions and if these questions are honest well then I appreciate that I appreciate all honest questions and these are honest answers by God's grace try to be as humble and as kind as possible what I've often found with these people that have left the message they left the message because they were a part of sinful message churches that's not brother brandom's fault that's not God's fault that's not Jesus's fault that's the fault of those sinful leaders in the sinful churches don't forget friends over 71 preachers left Jesus according to the Bible 70 left him and Judas es scarat left him we don't know all the evils that these 71 Preachers did but there was a lot of evil that came out of people that left Jesus Christ the same thing as repeated in this day Jesus Christ's Revelation was given to brother brandham brother brand was faithful to the re ation that Jesus gave him but many people around brother brandom turned out to be evil people and that's because Jesus said few there be that find the narrow road that leads to life and again 71 preachers left Jesus so we can expect many of the preachers that were around brother brandham would leave his message would leave the Bible Holiness standard would leave the word of God because that's what happened to Jesus but thank God there's a small Remnant that's faithful we believe we're a part of that by the grace of God I'm sure you do as well if you're a believer of this end time message Mage the viewers here and the main thing to do is stay in connection with Jesus Christ cuz he said the Holy Ghost will guide us into all truth as John 16:13 says if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
