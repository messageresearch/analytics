[0:03] I different with our great famous
[0:05] brother Billy Graham in his message
[0:07] other day he said that the Antichrist
[0:09] has already deceived the elected but I
[0:12] do not believe that because it's not
[0:14] possible they were elected and their
[0:17] names put on the book of life before the
[0:19] foundation of the world when the lamb
[0:21] was
[0:23] slain greetings friends in the matchless
[0:25] name of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[0:27] purpose of this video is to answer a
[0:29] viewer's question about Matthew
[0:32] 24:4 why can the elect not be deceived
[0:36] it's a great question so by God's grace
[0:37] we'll try to answer it by the holy
[0:40] scriptures and by the quotations from
[0:42] God's Prophet brother William Maran
[0:44] brandham so the outline has about four
[0:46] sections first we'll look at the answer
[0:48] the two reasons the elect cannot be
[0:50] deceived as far as what I found there
[0:52] could be more second all Christians can
[0:55] be deceived in the human Spirit but not
[0:57] the soul and it would be a temporary
[1:00] deception not a long-term
[1:03] deception third we'll look at brother
[1:05] bram's use of Matthew 24:24 in the
[1:07] sermon called the anointed ones of the
[1:09] end time from
[1:11] 1965 and lastly we'll look at the
[1:13] closest Ministries that
[1:15] deceive one interesting note brother
[1:17] Bram said deceive the elect if it were
[1:20] possible 191 times and 1965 was the year
[1:24] he said it the most with 51
[1:27] quotes and remember today is the
[1:29] greatest this day of deception according
[1:31] to Paul in 2 Timothy 3 it's verse 13 but
[1:36] evil men and seducers shall wax worse
[1:38] and worse deceiving and being deceived
[1:41] there has never been a day of Greater
[1:42] deception than today so it's so
[1:44] important that we have the spirit of
[1:45] Truth which is one of the reasons that
[1:47] the elect cannot be deceived so here's
[1:50] the full question why can the elect not
[1:51] be deceived Matthew 24:24 says if it
[1:54] were possible the elect cannot be
[1:56] deceived and that means both wise and
[1:58] foolish cannot be deceived that's a
[2:00] great point please make a video on why
[2:02] the true Christians will not take the
[2:03] mark of the beast so let's look at the
[2:05] scripture Matthew
[2:07] 24:24 for there shall rise false christs
[2:09] and false prophets and shall show great
[2:12] signs and wonders in so much that if it
[2:14] were possible they shall deceive the
[2:16] very elect now the reason it says if
[2:19] according to my humble opinion is that
[2:21] the foolish virgins are scarcely saved
[2:24] as lot is the type of the foolish virgin
[2:27] in the Old Testament lot basically had
[2:29] to be pulled out of Sodom by the angel
[2:33] but Abraham wasn't anywhere near Sodom
[2:36] remember Abraham was able to look from a
[2:38] far distance and see the smoke Rising
[2:41] after God had destroyed Sodom and
[2:42] gomorah with fire and
[2:44] brimstone so Abraham the type of the
[2:47] wise virgin was nowhere near Sodom and
[2:49] Gomorrah now the word scarcely in Greek
[2:51] means with difficulty or hardly again we
[2:55] can see how uh lot was hardly saved out
[2:58] of Sodom and even his wife turned around
[3:02] to look back at Sodom and then Jesus
[3:03] uses that he uses an example of an
[3:07] unbeliever remember Lot's wife as Jesus
[3:09] said in Luke 17 so we can use the good
[3:12] testimonies of Believers or we can use
[3:14] the failures of unbelievers as
[3:17] motivation to always believe Christ
[3:19] always obey the Lord Jesus Christ and
[3:22] remember friends we always have two
[3:23] kinds of Believers that are saved and
[3:26] two kinds of Believers that are lost
[3:27] brother R told us three kinds of
[3:28] Believers but then the church book he
[3:30] said there's another class of believer
[3:32] which is the foolish virgin now we find
[3:35] this in many places but one in
[3:36] particular is revelation 2211 it starts
[3:40] off with the unjust which are the people
[3:43] that were never saved then it goes to
[3:45] the filthy like Judas a scarat they were
[3:48] saved for a while but then they
[3:49] forfeited their salvation and became
[3:52] unclean those are the two types of lost
[3:54] people unjust filthy then you have two
[3:57] kinds of save people righteous like lot
[3:59] and then and holy like Abraham or the
[4:02] example from the cross of Jesus was
[4:04] Jesus was a type of the foolish virgin
[4:06] and then the save Thief was a type of
[4:07] the foolish virgin just scarcely barely
[4:12] saved now the first reason why the elect
[4:14] cannot be deceived is because a
[4:15] predestination God's choosing in his
[4:17] mind before the foundation of the world
[4:19] we see this in Ephesians 1: 4 and 5
[4:22] Revelation 138 their names are written
[4:24] on the Lamb's Book of Life before the
[4:26] foundation of the world therefore they
[4:28] cannot go along with the Beast system
[4:30] and then Romans 8:
[4:32] 29-35 that speaks of predestination and
[4:35] the five steps of predestination as I
[4:37] have a video on that if You' like a link
[4:39] to that I'll leave it in the description
[4:41] by the grace of God I'll play a quote
[4:43] here from but it wasn't so from the
[4:45] beginning and brother brandham cites
[4:46] Romans 8 and Revelation
[4:48] 13:8 as a reason the elect cannot be
[4:51] deceived let's listen to the quote and
[4:53] just about the time the Christ poured
[4:56] out his holy spirit it come on the scene
[4:58] the Antichrist come on the scene just
[5:01] about the time in the last days when the
[5:03] Holy Spirit begin to reveal himself the
[5:06] Antichrist reveals himself and about the
[5:09] time the coming of Christ the an of
[5:12] spirit comes also the Antichrist spirit
[5:15] so we see they Wen one with another
[5:17] Jesus said so close to it would deceive
[5:20] the very elected if it was possible uh
[5:24] different with our great famous brother
[5:26] Billy Graham in his message other day he
[5:28] said that the Antichrist has already
[5:31] deceived the elected but I do not
[5:33] believe that because it's not possible
[5:36] they were elected and their names put on
[5:38] the book of life before the foundation
[5:41] of the world when the lamb was slain now
[5:43] who it is I don't know see but the lamb
[5:46] was slain before the foundation of the
[5:48] world and the Antichrist will deceive
[5:50] all upon the Earth whose names were not
[5:53] written in the Lamb's Book of Life from
[5:55] the foundation of the world so you see
[5:58] we're pulling and sing to try to find
[6:01] where those people are that their name
[6:03] was put in the Lamb's Book of Life all
[6:05] that he forew he called those that he
[6:07] knew called he justified those who he
[6:09] justified he has already glorified so
[6:13] what do we got to fear about the thing
[6:15] of it is you say well will this live
[6:17] loose that shows that your name isn't on
[6:19] the book that's exactly right that
[6:22] proves that you wasn't when you try to
[6:23] live any kind of life and that you want
[6:25] to live that shows you haven't got it if
[6:28] you're a real Christian you'll live the
[6:30] real life because the Life of Christ is
[6:32] in you and you can do nothing else but
[6:34] Live the Life of Christ there's a few
[6:36] other verses that might be helpful acts
[6:38] 17 verse 26 says God has bounds that we
[6:42] cannot pass in the natural so he must
[6:44] have the same boundaries in the
[6:46] spiritual God will only let us go so far
[6:48] in the natural boundaries where we live
[6:50] where we travel where we go the Bible
[6:52] said he has determined the times before
[6:54] appointed and the bounds of their
[6:55] inhabitation so God determined our
[6:57] church age whether oldest or new
[7:00] testament and then how far we would go
[7:03] physically and Also spiritually God's
[7:05] already determined the wise virgin and
[7:06] the foolish virgin in his mind before
[7:09] the foundation of the world and this all
[7:11] goes back to his plan like Romans 9:21
[7:14] says hath not the Potter power over the
[7:17] clay of the same lump to make one vessel
[7:19] under honor and another under
[7:21] dishonor so God has power over his
[7:24] creation and Friends our own life will
[7:27] prove whether we're a vessel of Honor or
[7:29] dishonor honor if we love the Lord Jesus
[7:30] Christ that proves we're a vessel of
[7:33] Honor if we want to believe all the word
[7:35] of God that's proof that we are a vessel
[7:37] of Honor we're the elect we're the Holy
[7:39] Ghost filled Saints brother Ram said one
[7:42] proof of the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[7:43] is that you want to be in the word all
[7:45] the way you want to obey all the word of
[7:47] God so that's the first reason the
[7:50] second reason is because we have the
[7:51] spirit of Truth or God sends us the
[7:54] baptism of the Holy Ghost in our soul
[7:56] it's also called The Seed of God that
[7:58] God sends to be inside of us so the
[8:01] first reason is predestination the
[8:03] second reason is that we actually
[8:04] receive the seed of God the baptism of
[8:06] the Holy Ghost in our souls the baptism
[8:09] of the Holy Ghost is also called the
[8:10] spirit of Truth by Jesus it's called The
[8:12] Seed of God in 1 Peter 1:23 and a seed
[8:15] can only bring forth of its own kind so
[8:18] if we have the seed of God we'll bring
[8:19] forth the life of Jesus Christ these
[8:22] verses are John 14:17 the world cannot
[8:25] receive the spirit of truth that's why
[8:26] they can be deceived John 152 6 the
[8:30] comforter is the spirit of Truth so if
[8:31] we're the children of Truth we have
[8:33] truth inside of us therefore we cannot
[8:34] be deceived John 16:13 the comforter
[8:38] will guide us into all truth and that's
[8:40] the truth that's available for our hour
[8:42] as 2 Peter 1:12 says we live in the
[8:45] present truth so whatever truth is
[8:47] presently available the wise virgin will
[8:49] receive
[8:50] it just like the Ephesians and acts 18
[8:53] and 19 they received all of Apollo's
[8:56] truth until Paul came around and then
[8:57] they realized oh there's a baptism of
[8:59] the the Holy Ghost after it was preached
[9:01] to them they believed it Paul laid his
[9:02] hands on them in Acts 19 1-6 and they
[9:05] received the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[9:07] praise God for the present truth and
[9:10] another example is Martin Luther and
[9:11] John Wesley and William Seymour they
[9:13] could only receive the truth that was
[9:15] available for their day and they lived
[9:17] it Faithfully God will reward
[9:19] them and then I love 2 Thessalonians
[9:22] 2:13 it says we're chosen to Salvation
[9:25] through the belief of the truth so
[9:26] because we have the spirit of Truth we
[9:28] believe the truth that proves were
[9:29] chosen for salvation that proves we were
[9:32] predestinated in the mind of God before
[9:34] the foundation of the world 1 Peter 1
[9:37] 122 I love it too the soul is purified
[9:39] through the obeying of the truth so
[9:41] because we obey it purifies our souls
[9:44] makes our souls ready for heaven 1 John
[9:47] 4:6 we know the spirit of truth and the
[9:49] spirit of air so we can see the two
[9:50] spirits in the framework of the church
[9:52] by the grace of God and we can believe
[9:54] the spirit of
[9:55] Truth and again 1 Peter 1:23 we're born
[9:58] again by the in eruptible seed the word
[10:00] of God we have God's Own seed and the
[10:03] Bible says that seed cannot sin so we
[10:05] have a part of God's own life his holy
[10:08] spirit in our souls and that Holy Spirit
[10:11] in our soul that seed never sinned in
[10:13] the first place and it cannot sin the
[10:15] Bible says 1 John 3:9 whosoever is born
[10:18] of God doth not commit sin for it seed
[10:21] remaineth in him and he cannot sin
[10:23] because he is born of God that's
[10:25] speaking of the soul the soul that's
[10:26] born again does not sin but we sin in
[10:28] our human Minds when we lose a temporary
[10:31] battle in the battlefield of our
[10:33] minds in this next section it's going to
[10:36] be short but we do get deceived in our
[10:38] human
[10:40] Spirits yes a holy ghost philed believer
[10:42] a wise virgin can be deceived but only
[10:44] temporarily in the human mind or human
[10:47] Spirit we see this in Galatians Chapter
[10:49] 2 Peter was clearly born again he was a
[10:51] spokesman on the day of Pentecost he a
[10:53] spokesman to the Jews Gentiles and also
[10:55] Samaritans in the book of Acts but then
[10:58] he got the spirit of fear and he
[11:01] discriminated from the Gentiles and Paul
[11:03] had to come and correct him and rebuke
[11:05] him to his face but then he accepted the
[11:07] correction another example is how
[11:09] brother Bram lied to the IRS so brother
[11:10] Braham just got so worked up he said he
[11:13] felt like his head was spinning around
[11:14] so much stress with all the IRS meetings
[11:18] and questioning that he told his wife to
[11:20] tell the IRS agents he wasn't there but
[11:23] then of course the Holy Spirit corrected
[11:24] him he repented and made it right and
[11:27] one example that might work for some of
[11:28] us
[11:29] some people sometimes get prideful but 1
[11:31] John 1:8 says if we say that we have no
[11:34] sin we deceive ourselves and the truth
[11:36] is not in this notice John includes we
[11:39] he includes himself with we if we say we
[11:42] have no sin we deceive ourselves and of
[11:44] course again that would be a temporary
[11:46] deception in our human Spirits sometimes
[11:48] there are some dishonest message
[11:49] Believers and they take the quote too
[11:52] far that says as if you never did it in
[11:54] the first place and they'll say oh I
[11:55] don't have any sin I don't sin and if
[11:58] they're born again their soul doesn't
[11:59] sin but their human mind certainly does
[12:02] brother Ram says we sin every day and if
[12:04] someone's born again that could only
[12:05] take place in the human
[12:07] spirit in the next section let's look at
[12:09] brother Brams text for the anointed ones
[12:11] at the end time
[12:13] 1965 brother Brams first scriptures are
[12:16] Matthew 24:24 and then Matthew 5:44 and
[12:19] 45 how the rain falls in the just and
[12:21] the unjust and the Holy Ghost anoints
[12:23] false teachers at
[12:25] times then brother Randon goes to
[12:27] Hebrews 6 1-8 about rain falls on thorns
[12:30] and
[12:32] herbs and the Bible examples he uses are
[12:36] Moses and balam brother Ram says they're
[12:38] twins one was the true seed Moses one
[12:39] was the false seed
[12:41] balum then he uses micaa versus zedekiah
[12:45] in First Kings 22 it was so close it
[12:49] seemed but the elect could not be
[12:50] deceived both were prophesying but one
[12:52] was right one was wrong Jeremiah and
[12:55] hananiah are the third example Jeremiah
[12:57] chapter 28 and then David and usza from
[13:01] 1 Chronicles 13 David was anointed but
[13:04] got off by one word it caused the death
[13:06] of usza he was so close usza was so
[13:09] close but he broke the word of God then
[13:13] brother Ram cites 2 Timothy 3 1-9
[13:16] brother Ram said it was it would be so
[13:17] deceptive in the last days then brother
[13:20] Ram talked about the pope Antichrist who
[13:22] would do lying signs of Wonders
[13:24] Revelation 19:20 and 2 Thessalonians
[13:28] 28-10 and then brother Ram referenced
[13:30] the Egyptians Janice and jambers that
[13:33] could impersonate the first three
[13:35] plagues by the enchantments the rod into
[13:37] the serpent watered of blood and frogs
[13:40] out of water but they could not
[13:41] impersonate plagues 4 through1 including
[13:44] the healing boils and that gets into the
[13:46] truth that Satan cannot heal so hope
[13:49] that was a blessing to review some of
[13:51] brother M's main scriptures and examples
[13:53] from the anointed ones of the end times
[13:55] preached August 25th in the AM 1965
[14:00] lastly let's look at the closest
[14:01] Ministries that deceive again 2 Timothy
[14:04] 3:13 says this is the greatest age of
[14:06] deception now these are just my opinions
[14:09] but there are some Ministries that are
[14:11] easily detected as being sinful and they
[14:14] wouldn't deceive message Believers such
[14:16] as Kenneth copelan and Benny Hinn they
[14:18] claim to be prophets or claim to hear
[14:20] from God but they've lied so many times
[14:22] with us say the Lord that that wouldn't
[14:24] deceive the elect but I think the
[14:26] closest Ministries that deceive the
[14:28] elect today are the brandham Tabernacle
[14:30] and Joseph brandham Ministry because
[14:33] they can have Supernatural testimonies
[14:35] and healings even perhaps someone raised
[14:38] from the dead a couple years ago but if
[14:40] they break even one word of God such as
[14:42] physically not attending church which
[14:44] they haven't attended church for 5 years
[14:46] then they're off the word of God and of
[14:48] course I have a video series with 24
[14:50] plus lies coming out of brandom
[14:52] Tabernacle if false Doctrine is not
[14:54] corrected then it only grows like leaven
[14:57] or spreads like a canker Paul says and
[15:00] so the false doctrines of Bram
[15:01] Tabernacle have grown very much now I
[15:04] believe these followers of Bram
[15:05] Tabernacle can be saved but I would
[15:07] imagine they'd have to repent of their
[15:09] idolatry they worship the tapes they
[15:11] worship every word on the tapes and
[15:13] claim that every word is thus say the
[15:14] Lord even when brother Ram said this is
[15:16] not the Lord this is Brother brandom
[15:18] which he said on numerous
[15:21] occasions no doubt there's also
[15:23] five-fold preaching message Ministries
[15:25] that are deceptive when they start
[15:27] calling themselves the greatest of all
[15:28] time
[15:29] which I have a video about that if you'd
[15:30] like to watch that I believe that's
[15:32] getting into the first step of the
[15:34] four-step Antichrist process that's the
[15:37] Deeds of the nickol adans it's a saying
[15:39] and if this advances and it turns into
[15:41] an unbending doctrine that they teach
[15:43] and that would be the second step the
[15:44] doctr the nicians so we got to be very
[15:47] careful I have a video on the Deeds of
[15:48] nicians how to overcome that a sermon on
[15:51] that as well so I'll leave a link to
[15:52] that in the description by the grace of
[15:54] God in closing friends I hope this video
[15:56] was a blessing by the grace of God great
[15:58] question hope the answer was sufficient
[16:00] we're predestinated as Believers in the
[16:02] mind of God and then then God sends the
[16:04] Holy Ghost into our souls as a
[16:06] confirmation we are born again friends
[16:08] keep loving the truth growing in Grace
[16:10] and knowledge of the Lord growing in
[16:12] truth seek ye first the kingdom of God
[16:15] and his righteousness and everything
[16:16] else will be added unto you thank God
[16:19] we're the elect we were chosen in the
[16:20] mind of Christ before the foundation of
[16:22] the world if you have any questions
[16:24] concerns or testimonies about this video
[16:26] please contact me
[16:29] God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[16:31] the desire of your
[16:36] heart very happy to be here this
[16:38] afternoon and again in defense of the
[16:40] Gospel of Jesus Christ to bring the Good
[16:43] Tidings the good news that Jesus raised
[16:46] from the dead living among men today his
[16:48] church the same Jesus that was yesterday
[16:51] will it be today and
[16:53] forever is never failed
