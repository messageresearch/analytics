TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] Every man or that feels a call of God upon his life, get into the ministry. Start preaching. We need him. Get into the ministry. Start preaching. We need him. Greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of this video is to read through a recent post from Random Tabernacle and rightly divide the word of truth. One of the commenters on a video who is a tape listener said that these blog posts were love letters. And so I've read these blog posts over the years and I do not believe they're love letters as far as the true love of God because the Bible says in Ephesians 4:15 that we speak the truth in love. And this is in the context of the five-fold ministry. Ephesians 4 8-16. When we speak the truth in love, we grow up into him, Christ, in all things, which is the head, even Christ. So, when we speak the truth in love, we grow up into the word. So, I thought I would test this commenter's claim to see if these blog posts were truly love letters or see if they were lie letters. This video goes along with a recent set of videos I've done about Premium Tabernacle. One was called awful cult won't go to church released June 6, 2025 and the other was called abandon five parallels with Brandham Tabernacle and King Ahaz shutting the church doors the idolatry of Brandom Tabernacle. So when this commenter said the blog posts were love letters, I knew that was wrong. So, I thought I'd give one example of a blog post and show how it's off the word and the people that are being deceived here are just taking in the false doctrine, the false propaganda, and not really getting to hear what brother said about these questions. So, with that, let's get started here by the grace of God. This is a blog post from March 23rd, 2025, so about 3 months ago. This one really stood out to me, so I'd like to go through this one. I'll leave a link to it in the description. The apparent love letter says, "Dear tape listeners," and then there's five questions and answers. Let's go through each one of these questions and we'll show how these are not true statements. We can prove it by the word and also quotes from God's prophet, brother Brandham. The first question and answer is, are we in his perfect will by playing the tapes? Answer, yes. Now, I want you to notice here just one-word answers. No Bible verses were given. Now, the pastor did list Bible verses at the bottom. We'll go through those at the end. And this proves the Bible is not their absolute. There is no Bible verse that says you're in the perfect will of God by pressing play and neglecting the five-fold ministries. This proves they are idolattors. The current pastor is not like his father, Brother Brandham, who said the following. I have to answer from the Bible. Notice Brother Brandham had to answer from the Bible. His youngest son does not answer from the Bible. Let's listen to the quote. For my part, I I would know I have to answer from the Bible. I have to answer from the Bible. And remember friends, Brother Brandham's absolute was Jesus Christ. It's the word of the living God, the Bible. Brother Ram said, "If I die in my tracks, my absolute is Jesus Christ. If I die in my tracks, my absolute is Jesus Christ. That's what I believe. And so if Brother Ram's youngest son had the absolute of the Bible, he would list Bible scriptures for these answers. And of course, there are none listed. Let's listen to these quotes. My absolute is Jesus Christ. Brother Ram notices everybody makes their own absolute. And that's what Brandham Tabernacle has done. But we have one absolute. That's the word of living God. And then he says, "God's absolute is his word." So God's own absolute is his word. The absolute of the Brandham tabernacle is the tapes, which is idolatry. Let's listen to the quotes. And that's what's the matter in the Christian faith today. We got too many traffic jams. Everybody making their own absolute when we got one absolute and that's the word of the living God. That settles it forever. No matter what anyone else says, it's almost gotten to a place like it was in the days of judges. Everybody has their own absolute. But it all fails like the Pharaohs and so forth. But God's absolute is his word. He gives it and heavens and earth will pass away, but it shall never pass away. I like that. Because you get two men, you got two opinions. It's got to come to one final absolute. And my absolute is the word, the Bible. And as a pastor here of the church, my absolute is the word. Let's look at some more quotes from brother Brandham. Did Brother Brandham ever say that the people were in the perfect will of God by playing the tapes and not listening to preachers? No. But I want you to see brother Brandham prayed to God, let us walk in your perfect will. And he says, "Take all the word, not just a word here and there, the full gospel, all that Jesus taught us to do." He said, "The acts of the apostles is not just framework. It's the word of God." So I want you to notice in this quote, brother Brandham says, "The perfect will of God is taking every word Jesus taught and the acts of the apostles." In other words, the gospels in the Bible, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, and the book of Acts is the perfect will of God. And where did Jesus ever say it's the perfect will of God to play tapes and not listen to living preachers in the five-fold ministry? You're right. Jesus never said that. Neither did the book of Acts say that. Let's listen to the quote. Oh dear God, we don't want your permissive will. Father, let us walk in your perfect will. Let us just not take a word here and there and make it to fit a dogma or creed or something. Let us take the word as it is. Believing the full gospel, all that Jesus taught for us to do. We do not believe that the acts of the apostles is just a framework. We believe it's the word of God. It's the acts of your holy spirit in the apostles. And we believe that the same Holy Spirit, Lord, that come upon them and the way they acted, it'll do the same thing in us when it comes upon us if it's the same spirit. Next in the church age book, brother Brandham said the spirit of God has one voice and the spirit of God would only say what the word says. Brother Brandham said Paul warned them that even he himself nor anyone else could change one word of what he had been given by revelation. So Brandham tabernacle changes many words about the five-fold ministry. But brother told us the true prophet of God would not change one word. Paul said that proves brother Brandham was a prophet of God. That proves Brandham Tabernacle currently today does not have a prophet of God. Let's listen to the quote. How careful we must be to hear one voice for the spirit has but one voice which is the voice of God. Paul warned them to say what he said even as Peter did likewise. He warned them that even he Paul could not change one word of what he had given by revelation. Oh, how important it is to hear the voice of God by way of his messengers and then say what has been given them to say to the churches. The second question and answer says, "Does the bride need more than what is said on the tapes?" Their answer was no. So, is this true? Is this God's love? Or is this a lie? Did Brother Ram ever say this, that the bride only needs what's on the tapes? And of course, no. Brother Ram never said this. But let's look at what did brother Ram say we actually need. Let's look at that word need and look at quotes where brother Ram said what we need. And there are quotes where brother Ram said we need preachers. He never said we need tape players. Look it up. I challenge anyone to look it up. In 1955 in the sermon job, brother Bram said, "We need preachers that'll preach the word." He didn't say, "We need preachers that will sit down and press play." Let's listen to the quote. We need preachers that'll preach the word. Tell us the truth about tell us we must be born again and bring us on the basis of the shepherd to Jesus Christ the son of God. Introduce all the good things that God's got for us. That's the pastor. There it is. That's the kind you get the violence from. Might be in a bar or a mission, but just so you're getting fed is the main thing. Friends, brother M never said you only need one preacher. me. Brother Ram never said, "Someday before the rapture, I'll command all preachers to sit down and be quiet so everyone can follow my son and his schedule." That's a bunch of nonsense. In fact, Brother Ram said men would come after him and make more sense. Brother Ram hoped they could make it come to life and they have. That's how I came in the message. God made the message come to life to other men, living men who preach it to me, and I received it. And now I do the same by the grace of God. This is from birth pain 65. Let's listen to the quote. These men, if they pick up this and go out with it, they can make more sense to it. See to bring it to a place you would I just want to lay this seat. Hope they make it come to life. notice. But I'm very thankful for these open doors that I've had to go into and the inspiration it's given to young men like your pastor here that's caused them as I'm beginning to get old and know that my days are numbered and know now that these young men can take this message and sweep it on to the coming of the Lord if he doesn't come in and my generation which I'm hoping to see him. I look daily for him and watch keeping myself prepared for that hour. Next, Brother Random said, "Water from the rock." 55, "The spirit of God takes the word just as we have need of it, where the preacher will not try to use his own thoughts, just let the Holy Spirit move." And brother Ram tells the congregation not to criticize it. Well, that's what Brandham Tabernacle does. They criticize living preachers. But Brother Ram said, "That's what we need. We need the Holy Spirit to anoint preachers to give us the word of God." Brother Ram never said, "We just need what's said on the tapes." Let's listen to the quote. The Holy Spirit takes the word of God and just gives it right out in every heart just as we have need for it. If we can get ourselves submitted to the Holy Spirit, the word of the preacher will not try to use his own thoughts. Just let the Holy Spirit move and let the congregation not try to criticize, but just set with an open heart and honest before God, then we'll have a real meeting. Next, in the uncertain sound, brother Ram said, "We need men, not just one man." Notice, Brother Ram said, "What we need today is men and preachers that preach God's word." Brother Ram never said, "We just need to press play and listen to tapes only." Let's listen to the quote. What I say today, what we need today is man with experience that knows what God means and takes God's experience by God's Bible and preaches God's word, has God's signs and God's vindication. If you don't know beans from or split beans from coffee, preach anyhow. There's one thing you know. If your candle got lit, go tell somebody how it got lit. Maybe theirs will get lit, too. Right off of yours. Amen. It's what we need today. In the next quote, Questions Answers part three, they asked Brother Brandham, "Is it true no one should preach but you?" And notice Brother Ram said, "We need them. We need every man that feels a call of God on his life get in the ministry and start preaching." He didn't say get into the ministry and start pressing play. So who's right? Is Brandham Tabernacle currently right or was brother Brandham right? Brother Brandham was right. Brother Ram said we need them. Hallelujah. Let's listen to the quote now. Brother Brandham, is it true that no one should preach but you? We have seen your We have seen you ordained man. We do don't believe you would do that if there were not if they were not to preach. Mercy, brother, sister, ever who told you nobody's preached for me, I'd sure be a four subject of God's with all that. No. Every man or that feels a call of God upon his life, get into the ministry, start preaching. We need them. Man of God are anointed all over the world to preach the gospel. See, I'm just one little pebble on the beach among many big stones. See, so uh there's just many that's more eligible, more worthy, more of anything to preach than me. I'm just one little humble person laying out ear. I'm one grain of wheat and a whole garner. See, so it's just, you know what I mean? Any man that's called of God needs to preach the gospel. Third question says, "Are we missing something by only listening to the tapes?" Their answer was, "No. Is that the truth or is that a lie? I believe it's a lie." Did Brother Ram ever say this? No, brother Ram never said this, but they asked Brother Brandham in questions and answers on the seal 63. Would the bride of Christ have a ministry before the rapture? And so the tape ministry people are missing out on what brother Bram said is the great ministry of the five-fold ministry, the living preachers, not the tape pressers or tape players. And notice the tape worshippers are missing out on the great ministry, the message of the hour. Brother Brandham calls the five-fold ministry the message of the hour. Brother Ram did not say there's only one gift and it was me. He said all these gifts are plural. Notice apostles, not just one. Prophets, not just one. Teachers, evangelists, pastors. Brother Ram used this in the plural, meaning there's more than one preacher. It's the entire five-fold ministry around the world. Let's listen to this quote. The five-fold ministry is the message of the hour. It's a great ministry. That's what Brandham Tabernacle is missing out on. Would the bride of Christ have Would the bride of Christ have a ministry before the rapture? Sure. That's what's going on right now. The bride of Christ certainly it is the message of the hour. Amen. The bride of Christ. Sure. She's consist of apostles, prophets, teachers, evangelists, and pastors. Is that right? That's the bride of Christ. Sure. She's got a ministry. Great ministry. the ministry of the hour. It'll be so humble. And let's look at that quote from earlier about is it true no one should preach but you notice Brandom Tabernacles missing out on four of the five folds of the five-fold ministry and really it's five out of fivefolds because God never called dead people to lead living people. God always called living preachers to lead the living. So is Brandon Tabernacle missing something? Yes, they're missing all fivefolds of the five-fold ministry. and ask yourself when did brother Ram change this? When did brother Ram said he was the only one to preach and we're just to sit down and just press play and obey. So this proves Brandham Tabernacle currently has changed the gospel. There's awful repercussions for that. Again, let's listen to the quote from questions and answers part three. Now, brother Brandham, is it true that no one should preach but you? We have seen your We have seen you ordained man. We do don't believe you would do that if there were not if they were not to preach. Mercy, brother, sister, ever who told you nobody's preached for me, I'd sure be a four subjects of God with all that. No. every man or that feels a call of God upon his life, get into the ministry, start preaching. We need him. And then remember that birth pains quote from 65. This proves Brennham Tabernacle is missing out on more understanding of the message. They're missing out on more life because brother Brandham said, "These men will pick this message up and make more sense of it and make it come to life." So let's listen to that quote again. These men if they pick up this and go out with it they can make more sense to it. See to bring it to a place you would I just want to lay this seat. Hope they make it come to life. Notice okay the fourth and final question. Can we be the bride by only listening to the tapes and their answer is a most emphatically yes. And finally they use a scripture. They use Amos 3:7. Now remember, nothing to be revealed. God will do nothing at all until first he reveals it to his servants, the prophets. So they use a quote from brother Brandham who's quoting from Amos 3:7. Thus all we need has been spoken and is on the tapes. Or when his seventh angel returns to earth, he will tell us then. Oh, there's so much propaganda in here. And look, there's even a false imagination because they say, "Or when his seventh angel returns to earth." So Brandham tabernacle is open to a return ministry of brother Brennham. These people are off the word. It's so incredibly sad. They're open to brother Ram coming back and telling them more of what they need to hear. Again, this proves the Bible's not their absolute. Brother Ram said, "All that we have need of is in the Bible." Brother Ram said, "You can't add to the Bible nor take away from the Bible because that's what the Bible says." There is a textbook on psychology, one we all need. It is the Bible. It is written by God and contains God's psychology. We have every article of the Bible, vivid evidence right here now. All sufficient God to provide everything that we have need of. Now, someone said, "Well, that's seven seals and brother Brandham that'll be revealed in the last days. Some great mystery how we get closer to God." No, sir. It can't be. Whosoever shall take one word from this Bible or add one word to it, his part will be taken the book of life. What it is is a revelation on what has been missed back there to bring to it's already wrote here. It's in here. It's to reveal what already has been written. Amen. See, because you can't add one thing to it or take one word from it. So, did brother Brandham say we can be the bride by only listening to the tapes? The answer is no. Brother Brandham only supported listening to tapes when there was no preacher. That was in questions answers part three 1964. They asked brother Brandham, "We have no preacher where we live. Are the tape services sufficient?" Brother Ram said, "Well, let that be according to the way your children are going." So notice, Brother Ram only approved it when there was no preacher. Which of these people today following the Brandham tabernacle do not have a preacher that lives close to them? And remember, they'll be judged if they fail to go to hear living preachers. Just as the Queen of Sheba crossed the desert to hear the wisdom of Solomon, Jesus said, "She'll be used to judge those in Jerusalem and those who lived in the time of Jesus who would not go to hear Jesus preach and they live so close to Jesus." Whereas the Queen of Sheba made a great travel. She sacrificed a lot to travel great distance to hear the gift of God for her day. What will be the judgment on the people today who do not go to hear living preachers? only God knows. And then later, Brother Ram was asked, "If you don't have a church to go to, should you just listen to the tapes?" He said, "That'd be fine." So, let's listen to those two quotes. But then remember, there was quotes from the same series where Brother Bram said, "You go to church. If you can only get one slice of bread, go to that church to show which side you're on." Let's listen to the quotes. Brother Brandham, we got just 10 minutes now. Brother Brandon, we have no preacher where we live, but we have tape service on Sunday night only. Should we take our children to another church for Sunday school? Are the tape services sufficient? Well, let that be according to where your children are going. See, now if you get your children, they're young, and you get them out into some kind of a group out there that'll just pound the stuff into them that they they shouldn't know. I wouldn't do it. If they if they seem to learn enough from the tapes and things and you say you put them over in a Catholic church, take them over to Catholic church, take them over to something like that. I wouldn't advise that thing. if they uh but now if you got a nice little church over there maybe disagree two or three things with you and your children want to go to Sunday school they're full gospel people or something well that's perfectly all right but see when you come to a place where depends on how your children take it see watch what your children does what how they react to it let's see if you don't have a church to go to should you just listen to the tapes yes that's I that'd be fine brother Brandham should we go to the other churches even when they disagree with you. Sure. Yep. Jesus did when they disagreed with him. Go ahead. Uh we notice Sharon said, "Uh, should we go to another church that disagrees with you?" Sure. I don't I'm not the only pebble on the beach, you know. There just other godly man everywhere. I hope I'm one of them. See, but don't never get down here. I was called in on something like this uh the other day uh a group in Arizona called my attention to that. See, a ministerial group said, "The only thing that we have against you, Brother Bram, is one of the things the people that come out here with you, we can't get them to go to church anywhere." Said, "They got children and everything. They won't go to church." And said, "Well, we told them they're welcome to come to our church. I know they put a pressure on you and want you to join, but you don't have to join, but put them kids in Sunday school somewhere. And you go to church. Don't sit at home go fishing, hunting, and things like that on Sunday." Amen. You say, "Well, I'm not a legalist." Well, you better be in that manner for a while, dishonoring the resurrection of Christ. So, we see friends, the Brandon Tabernacle pastor has no gift to rightly divide the word. Amos 3:7 is not about Paul's five-fold ministry. How can Amos 3:7 delete Ephesians 4 8-16? It cannot. Not one word of Paul can be changed according to brother Brandham. And yet, Brandham Tabernacle deletes Ephesians 4 and the verses about the five-fold ministry. And notice Brandom Tabernacle is only using one verse, Amos 3:7, to prove their point. But that breaks the principle of the word. The word says we need in the mouth of two or three witnesses to establish every word of truth. Amos 3:7 says, "Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealth his secret unto his servants, the prophets." Now, this verse is true. No doubt about it. Brother Ram was a true servant of God, a prophet. He revealed the secret of the seven seals. That's undeniable. There's over 38 differences between Brother Brandham's revelation on the seals versus Clarence Larkin, Uriah Smith, Charles TA Russell. I have videos that prove that. So, I'll leave links to that in the description by the grace of God. But, Brother M said he could never take one word away from the Bible nor add one word to the Bible. The Bible is the absolute. And the Bible never says we're in the perfect will of God by playing the tapes and neglecting the five-fold ministry. The Bible never says the bride only needs what is on the tapes. The Bible never says only listen to tapes and you won't miss out on anything. And the Bible never says you can be the bride by only listening to the tapes and neglecting the five-fold ministry. The Bible says the exact opposite in Ephesians 4 8-16. Verse 11 lists apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, teachers. Verse 12, for the perfecting of the saints, the work of the ministry, the edifying of the body of Christ. So tape players are missing the perfection of the saints. They're missing the work of the ministry. They don't have a real ministry and they're missing the edifying or building up of the body of Christ. Verse 13, we need the five-fold ministry till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. So the tape worshippers will not be unified by the Holy Ghost with other believers. They'll miss out on the knowledge of God. They won't come unto a mature man. They won't come to the full measure of the stature of Christ that they should because they're neglecting the five-fold ministry. And as verse 14 says, they will be tossed to and fro like children carried about with every wind of doctrine. And I have a video series of over 24 false doctrines that prove Brandom Tabernacle is being carried and tossed by all these 24 false doctrines. and they're being deceived as Ephesians 4:14 says. Let's finish the video by going over these verses here and show how they have nothing to do with tape playing. Matthew 4:8 says, "The devil taketh him up to an exceeding high mountain and showeth him all the kings of the world and the glory of them." This verse says nothing about tape playing. It's about Jesus's temptation. Matthew 11:25 and 26. This is Jesus praying, I thank thee, oh father, because thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent and revealed them unto babes. Even so, Father, for it seemed good in thy sight. This is Jesus thanking the Lord despite Capernium, Tyrie, Sidon, and Cherzan rejecting his ministry. This has nothing to do with pressing play on the tapes. Matthew 24:6, "And ye shall hear wars and rumors of wars. See that you be not troubled, for all these things must yet come to pass, but the end is not yet." That's speaking of the conditions of the end time. And again, there it doesn't say anything about pressing play on tapes. Mark 16:16 is about believing and being baptized. He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved. He that believeth not shall be damned. There's nothing in Jesus's words about just pressing play and avoiding preachers. In fact, Romans 10 says, "You can't be saved except you hear a preacher, not a tape player." John 14:12 is about Jesus doing greater works in the bride, and that means more works. No one could do a greater miracle than Jesus Christ. Verily, I say unto you, he that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also, and greater works than these shall he do, because I go to my father. So any believer will do works of the Holy Ghost. Thank God for healings, miracles, words of wisdom, words of knowledge. But again, this verse says nothing about being in the perfect will of God by pressing play. 2 Thessalonians 2:3. Let no man deceive you by any means, for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed the son of predition. This verse is about the future Pope Antichrist. But notice the tape worshippers are being deceived by a man and numerous men in the Brandham tabernacle leadership that have fallen away from the five-fold ministry. It could not be any planer. The hundreds of thousands of people or maybe million or more that are influenced by Brenham tabernacle are being deceived. They're falling away from the Bible verses about the five-fold ministry. Hebrews 4:12 is about the power of the word. For the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing of sunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. The word of God always does this. It divides between the soul, spirit, and body. It discerns or judges the secrets and thoughts, intents of the heart. The word of God does this in the five-fold ministry. Of course, brother Brandham's gift of discernment did this very often, and we're thankful for that by the grace of God. But this verse never says to sit down, preachers, and just press play. Revelation 2:6 is about the deeds of the Nicicoatans. But this thou hast that thou hatest the deeds of the nickels, which I also hate. No doubt Jesus hates any man-made deeds. And that's what Brandham Tabernacle is doing. All their 24 false doctrines are man-made deeds. They say every word on tape is infallible. Every word on tape is thus sayith the Lord. The tape boys are the true five-fold ministry. The token is not the baptism of the Holy Ghost. To them, the token is the tapes. Such nonsense. Such awful deeds of the nickelotans. Revelation 6 3 and 4 is about the second seal. Again, nothing in here about being in the perfect will of God by playing tapes. Revelation 17 is about the mother harlot, the Roman Catholic Church. Revelation 19:11-16 is about the battle of Armageddon where Jesus comes out of heaven riding a white horse. So this shows the Lord's day, Jesus coming at the battle of Armageddon. Joel 2:25 speaks of God restoring and this is what God has done through the church ages as well. I will restore to the years that the locust hath eaten the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the palmer worm, my great army which I sent among you. No mention here of playing tapes. And in fact, Brandham Tabernacle should say God's restoring what the book of Acts did, which was support the five-fold ministry. It's sad. Brand Tabernacle can't see that. Brother Ram came to restore the apostolic faith. The apostolic faith was to receive the five-fold ministry, to grow by the five-fold ministry, be united through the five-fold ministry. But again, they can't see that because of their deception and their idolatry. And last but not least is Amos 3:6 and 7. We already talked about that. These verses speak of how God reveals his secret to his prophets. Prophets are likened under trumpets being blown. And God does nothing until we he reveals his secret unto the servants, the prophets. So, Brother Ram gave us the secrets of the seven seals. No doubt about that. So, we rejoice in God sending us a genuine prophet in this day. Let's close with a word of prayer for the tape worshippers. Dear God, I humbly pray, Lord God, that you'll help the tape worshippers to repent of their sins. God, repent of their idolatry, their false doctrine. And God, please, if it's just helping one, I just pray use this video and the videos of others, other preachers who are speaking the truth about the five-fold ministry, even if just one person can be saved out of this. I pray you grant it for the glory of God. Lord, our hearts are turned back to the apostolic fathers. Therefore, we must earnestly contend for the faith which was once given to the saints. And the faith given to the saints was the five-fold ministry preaching the word of God. Faith comes by hearing, hearing by the word of God. How shall they hear except they hear a preacher? So, Father, help the leadership to repent, Lord. If not, may the next generation repent, dear God. We ask for the people to be brought out of deception, into the truth, into the marvelous light of the Lord Jesus Christ. May the Bible become their absolute. Grant it, Lord. May they humble themselves and repent in tears, oh God. and may that get right with you. I pray Lord, I humbly ask this in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. If you have any questions, concerns or testimonies about this video, please contact me. God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart. very happy to be here this afternoon and again in defense of the gospel of Jesus Christ to bring the good tidings, the good news that Jesus raised from the dead, living among man today, his church. The same Jesus that was yesterday will be today and forever is never failed. [Music]
