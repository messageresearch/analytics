[0:03] the other day I got something mixed up.
[0:04] I happen to hear it. It's I caught it
[0:06] right there and it's on the tape and I I
[0:08] probably hear from it. Boy, it's a great
[0:10] teaching there. I didn't touch the edge
[0:11] of it, but if you happen to catch that
[0:13] on your tape, remember, look in the
[0:15] Bible. You see, and that um that I am
[0:19] perfectly infallible, that there's
[0:21] nothing. And what was some of the
[0:23] awfulest things you ever heard? And it's
[0:25] causing a lot of confusion. And uh this
[0:28] church knows that we don't stand for no
[0:29] such Tommy rod as that. We believe in
[0:32] the Bible.
[0:33] &gt;&gt; So the Bible is perfectly true. And
[0:35] that's what we stand on the Bible. It
[0:38] must be thus sayeth the Lord. It's got
[0:42] to come to one final absolute. [music]
[0:46] And my absolute is the word, the Bible.
[0:51] &gt;&gt; Greetings friends [music] in the matches
[0:52] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. This is
[0:55] part four in the series of 60 plus
[0:57] proofs. The tapes of William Brandham
[0:59] have mistakes on them. Yet, he's a
[1:01] genuine prophet of God. Part three ended
[1:03] at number 69. So, we'll increase this up
[1:06] to number 80 today by God's grace. So,
[1:09] I'll change the title and the thumbnail
[1:10] to 80 plus proofs. There are mistakes on
[1:13] the tapes. Yet, Brother Brandham is a
[1:15] genuine prophet of God. Friends, as I
[1:17] deal online with both preachers and tape
[1:20] worshippers, tape boys, I'm reminded
[1:23] again of how Brother Brandham said, "The
[1:25] Bible is the only book in existence that
[1:27] tells us where we come from, where we
[1:29] are, where we're going, and is thus
[1:31] sayith the Lord." Every word in the
[1:33] Bible is thus sayeth the Lord.
[1:37] And the quote where brother said this is
[1:39] the resurrection of Lazarus, 1953.
[1:42] Here's the only book that tells you
[1:44] where you come from, who you are, and
[1:46] where you're going. That's the only book
[1:48] there is in existence is that Bible. And
[1:50] I believe every word of it. Just I
[1:53] believe it's just like it's written
[1:55] there. I just ready to hang my soul on
[1:58] any phase and say it's thus sayith the
[2:00] Lord. Yes, sir. So notice brother Ram
[2:03] said it's the only book in existence
[2:05] where he believed every word of it. It's
[2:08] the only book that tells you these
[2:10] things. So that eliminates brother
[2:12] Random's own sermon books and the church
[2:14] age book and the seven seal book and any
[2:16] other books about his ministry as books
[2:18] that have every word as thus sayith the
[2:21] Lord. The Bible is the only book in
[2:23] which every word is thus sayith the
[2:25] Lord. That's according to brother
[2:26] Brandham. And of course we know that's
[2:28] according to the Bible itself.
[2:29] Revelation 22 tells us not to add one
[2:31] word nor take one word away from the
[2:33] words of this prophecy. The Bible says
[2:35] every word of God is pure. Add thou not
[2:37] unto God's words. In Proverbs 30, lest
[2:40] God call you a liar. And remember,
[2:42] Brother Ram said, "The most important
[2:43] thing of today is a good God-scent
[2:46] preacher, a man who knows how to rightly
[2:48] divide the word of God. It's the most
[2:49] wonderful gift in the world is to be a
[2:51] minister." I'm not exalting myself, but
[2:53] I'm just stating what Brother Ram said.
[2:55] A preacher is the most important thing,
[2:57] not a tape pusher or tape button pusher.
[3:01] So, only a God-called preacher can bring
[3:04] up faith in Christ, as Brother M said.
[3:06] So tape button pushers do not bring up
[3:09] faith in Christ, but they do bring up
[3:11] deception. They do increase the deity
[3:14] spirit in people by telling them to just
[3:16] press play and obey, which we know is
[3:19] disobey. Friends, when people stop
[3:21] discerning the tapes of brother
[3:23] Brandham, they open themselves up to the
[3:25] deity spirit. Whether you're a tape boy
[3:27] or a preacher, the Bible said, "Prove
[3:29] all things. Test every spirit." So,
[3:32] anyone who stands behind every quote
[3:34] from 47 to 65 is an idoltor, a heretic.
[3:38] They're seduced by the deity spirit.
[3:40] They don't believe everything on the
[3:42] tapes, and they certainly don't listen
[3:44] or hear what the spirit is saying on the
[3:46] tapes. They call us devils if we say,
[3:48] "Brother Brandham had an opinion on
[3:50] something." And yet, Brother Brandham
[3:51] said his opinion was just like anyone
[3:53] else's in marriage and divorce, February
[3:55] 1965.
[3:58] Brother Brandham admitted there were
[3:59] mixups on the tapes. He said, 'I make
[4:02] those kind of mistakes all the time,
[4:03] such as slips of the tongue, saying 700
[4:06] did not bow the knee rather than the
[4:08] 7,000 that the Bible says. So, how can
[4:10] these tape worshippers be born again? I
[4:12] don't know. That will be up to God.
[4:14] Especially the preachers who do not work
[4:16] full-time jobs. They have all day to
[4:18] study the quotes and the Bible, and yet
[4:20] they still come away saying, "Every word
[4:22] is thus sayith the Lord." They stand by
[4:24] every quote from 47 to 65. They are
[4:27] deceived and deceiving others sadly.
[4:30] Let's get in here to number 70. We'll go
[4:32] through numbers 70 through 80. So the
[4:35] 70th proof, not every word on tape is
[4:37] thus sayith the Lord is 1960 December
[4:41] 4th in the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[4:43] Brother Ram said quote when Apostle
[4:45] Peter said there is no other mediator
[4:47] between God and men but that man Christ
[4:50] Jesus one. End quote. So notice brother
[4:53] Ram said Peter said this but this is not
[4:56] thus sayith the Lord. It was actually
[4:57] Paul that said this. It's in 1 Timothy
[5:00] 2:5. For there's one God and one
[5:02] mediator between God and men, the man
[5:04] Christ Jesus. Any person who says that
[5:07] quote is thus sayith the Lord is
[5:09] deceived of a deity spirit, foolish,
[5:12] insane, idoltor, heretic, whatever the
[5:15] Bible calls them, that's what they are.
[5:17] They are tape worshippers. They are man
[5:19] worshippers. They're the ones bowing
[5:21] down to Nebuchadnezzar's image. They're
[5:24] not like the three Hebrew children that
[5:25] stood despite the pressure to bow down
[5:28] and worship Nebuchadnezzar's image of
[5:30] Daniel the prophet.
[5:32] Number 71. Brother Bram said, "We are
[5:34] co-equal with Jesus Christ in his
[5:36] presence." He said this in 1954.
[5:40] He said, "Oh brother, that's you that's
[5:42] born again are sons and daughters of God
[5:44] co-equal with Jesus Christ in his
[5:46] presence. Oh my." End quote.
[5:49] So, I can see brother Ram's talking
[5:51] about the relationship between God and
[5:53] the bornagain believers. He's restoring
[5:55] their fellowship in relationship in God
[5:58] perfecting his church 1954. But there's
[6:01] also quotes of Brother Brandon that say
[6:02] the opposite in 1958 tested faith
[6:05] produces goods. Brother Ram said, quote,
[6:08] there's never been a man equal to him.
[6:10] End quote. So, Brother Ram said, there's
[6:13] never been a man equal, but yet the
[6:14] other quote says we are co-equal in his
[6:16] presence. Friends, if you go to the
[6:19] Bible, Revelation 5:es 4 and 5, the 24
[6:22] elders in heaven were not as worthy as
[6:25] Jesus. They were not co-equal. The Bible
[6:28] said, "No man was found worthy to open
[6:30] and read the book." And one of the
[6:32] elders said to John, "Weep not. The lion
[6:34] of the tribe of Judah, the root of
[6:36] David, hath prevailed to open the book
[6:37] and to loose the seven seals thereof."
[6:39] So the Bible plainly teaches, "No man is
[6:42] co-equal to Jesus Christ, not even in
[6:44] heaven."
[6:45] You see that also in Revelation chapter
[6:46] 4 where the elders and the angels bow
[6:49] down and worship Jesus. Jesus gets all
[6:51] the praise, all the worship. He's the
[6:53] only worthy one. No one is co-equal to
[6:56] the Lord Jesus Christ. The Bible even
[6:58] says there's no equal to God. Isaiah
[7:01] 40:2, "To whom then will you liken me?
[7:05] Or shall I be equal? Saith the Holy
[7:07] One." So God's asking, "Who will be
[7:09] equal to me?" There's no one equal to
[7:11] God. Isaiah 46:5,
[7:14] "To whom will ye liken me and make me
[7:17] equal and compare me that we may be
[7:20] like?" So again, there is no equal to
[7:22] God. There is no equal to Jesus Christ.
[7:25] There's no one like Jesus. Now, in one
[7:28] way in heaven, we'll be sinless. Thank
[7:29] God by the grace of God for giving us a
[7:31] theophony and eventually a glorified
[7:33] body after the rapture. But still then,
[7:36] we will not be co-equal. Will not know
[7:38] everything God knows. will not be able
[7:40] to do everything God can do. He gives us
[7:43] a portion of eternal life. We do not get
[7:46] the fullness of the godhead bodily that
[7:48] was only given to Jesus Christ. Let's
[7:51] move on to number 72. And this one ought
[7:53] to destroy all the tape worshippers,
[7:56] their false doctrines, and idolatry. In
[7:58] 1961, questions and answers. Brother
[8:00] Random said, "I'm going to be honest as
[8:03] I can be. I don't think I'd have
[8:04] anything to do with that messenger." End
[8:06] quote. But when he's talking about how
[8:08] little Willie put Brother Ram's name
[8:11] under the star out there on the seven
[8:13] church ages and Brother Ram said, "As
[8:16] honest as I can be, I don't have
[8:18] anything to do with that messenger."
[8:21] Friends, how can the tape worshippers
[8:22] say this is thus sayith the Lord? If
[8:24] this is thus sayith the Lord, Brother
[8:26] Brandham is not the seventh church age
[8:28] messenger. These people are insane who
[8:31] say they stand behind every quote from
[8:33] 47 to 65. these evangelists, preachers,
[8:36] pastors, whatever they are, how can they
[8:38] stand behind that? Who then is a seventh
[8:41] church age messenger if not brother
[8:42] William Brandham? So what is the rightly
[8:45] divided truth here? Brother Ram was
[8:46] being honest. He was being humble. He
[8:48] said he was as honest as he could be. So
[8:50] at that time God had not yet revealed to
[8:52] him that he was the seventh church age
[8:54] messenger. But of course later he must
[8:55] have done that. In anointed ones at the
[8:58] end time 65, brother Ram said, "I
[9:00] challenge you. Check every newspaper."
[9:02] He said Malachi 4 restoring the hearts
[9:05] of the children back to the fathers is
[9:06] on the earth right now with thus sayeth
[9:08] the lord. And then in the church age
[9:10] book lays out in the chapter on the
[9:12] leosian church age that no doubt it was
[9:15] his ministry that was the ministry of
[9:18] the seventh church age messenger a
[9:20] prophet messenger. So please share this
[9:23] quote with anyone you know who worships
[9:25] the tapes. If that is thus sayith the
[9:27] lord then who is the seventh church age
[9:29] messenger? Is it Joseph Brandham? Is it
[9:32] Billy Paul? No, it is brother William
[9:35] Brandham. But he just grew in his
[9:37] revelation.
[9:39] The 73rd proof is brother Brandham said
[9:41] twothirds of the angels were deceived by
[9:43] Satan. He said this in questions and
[9:45] answers on Genesis 53. Quote, "And
[9:47] twothirds of the earth is in sin and
[9:49] more than that which twothirds of the
[9:51] angels was kicked out." End quote. So is
[9:54] that the truth? Is that thus sayith the
[9:56] Lord were twothirds of the angels kicked
[9:58] out of heaven? The answer is no. It was
[10:00] a third. Revelation 12:4 said, "And his
[10:04] tale drew the third part of the stars of
[10:05] heaven and did cast them to the earth."
[10:07] End quote. The tale of course was Satan
[10:10] the dragon. Satan deceived a third of
[10:13] the angels. And in that quote, brother
[10:15] Bram said twoth3s. Anyone that stands
[10:18] behind that quote has the deity spirit
[10:21] is an idoltor. [snorts] Number 74 is
[10:26] brother Ram said a prophet quote he
[10:28] don't hold meetings and discuss things
[10:30] end quote. This is from taking sides
[10:32] with Jesus 1962.
[10:35] But if you read the Bible friends in
[10:36] Acts chapter 15 a prophet did hold
[10:39] meetings. It was the prophet St. Paul.
[10:42] Acts 15:2 says Paul and Barnabas had no
[10:45] small dissension. They determined they
[10:47] should go up to Jerusalem under the
[10:48] apostles and elders about this question.
[10:51] So they held a meeting to discuss if the
[10:53] Gentiles could receive the baptism of
[10:55] the Holy Ghost. In Acts 15:6, the
[10:57] apostles and elders came together for to
[10:59] consider of this matter. In verse 12,
[11:02] the audience or multitude gave audience
[11:04] to Barnabas and Saul. And notice who
[11:07] gives the last word in this meeting or
[11:10] this council. It was St. James in verse
[11:14] 13. And after they had held their peace,
[11:16] James answered saying, "Men and
[11:18] brethren, hearken unto me." And if you
[11:19] go down to verse 22, it says, "Then
[11:22] pleased it the apostles and elders and
[11:23] the whole church to send chosen men of
[11:25] their own company to Antioch with Paul
[11:26] and Barnabas, namely Judas surname
[11:29] Barsabas and Silas, chief men among the
[11:31] brethren." So preachers around the
[11:33] message have said the prophet always
[11:35] gets the last word and prophets don't
[11:37] hold meetings, but here a prophet holds
[11:39] a meeting. And who did he give the last
[11:41] word to? St. James, which as far as
[11:43] history, I don't think he was a prophet.
[11:45] At least I haven't heard that. But the
[11:47] point I'm trying to make is that
[11:48] preachers today will say, "Brother Ram
[11:50] gets the last word on everything.
[11:51] Prophets don't hold meetings." But
[11:54] actually, the Bible gets the last word
[11:55] on everything. Jesus is the first and
[11:57] the last. And Jesus is called the word
[11:59] of God. Again, it's just a deception of
[12:02] the deity spirit to try to worship
[12:04] Brother Brandham to make him
[12:05] untouchable, every word infallible. It's
[12:07] a lying, deceiving deity spirit. The
[12:10] 75th proof is the 144,000 are martyrs or
[12:14] are they rescued by Jesus? In the fifth
[12:16] [snorts] seal 1963, brother Ram said,
[12:18] quote, notice these souls are to wait a
[12:21] little season for the 144 to be martyed.
[12:24] End quote. But then the church age book,
[12:27] Brother Ram says, speaking of the
[12:28] 144,000, quote, with the enemy repulsed,
[12:31] then Jesus comes and presents himself to
[12:33] the 144,000. End quote.
[12:37] So in the fifth seal, brother Ram said
[12:39] the 144,000 are martyed. But then in the
[12:42] church age book, brother Ram says the
[12:43] 144,000
[12:45] are saved because the enemy is repulsed
[12:47] by the coming of Jesus to the 144,000.
[12:50] So what is the rightly divided word of
[12:51] truth? I don't know. I think I would
[12:54] lean that Jesus would rescue them
[12:56] because they had the seal of the Holy
[12:57] Ghost and God is not going to judge and
[12:59] let the wrath of God come upon the
[13:01] righteous and the wicked. Just the
[13:02] wicked receive the wrath of Almighty
[13:04] God. But I could be wrong. I don't know.
[13:06] Brother Random said all the questions
[13:07] after the rapture won't hurt if we have
[13:10] a different opinion on them. He said
[13:11] that in questions answers on the seals
[13:14] 1963. But again, I just want to show how
[13:16] there's quotes on both sides of the
[13:18] topic by God's grace. The 76 proof is
[13:21] that brother Random called the sixth
[13:24] seal the fifth seal. So in the sixth
[13:26] seal sermon 1963, brother Random said,
[13:29] "Now watch here on the sixth seal
[13:31] 69-11,"
[13:33] speaking of Revelation 6:es 9-11. "And
[13:36] when he'd opened the fifth seal, I saw
[13:38] under the altar the souls of them that
[13:39] were slain for the word of God and for
[13:41] the testimony which they held." So this
[13:44] is undeniable. Brother Random says,
[13:45] "We're going to read the sixth seal and
[13:46] then he reads the fifth seal." So this
[13:48] has to be a slip of the tongue. That's
[13:50] the rightly divided word of truth. The
[13:52] sixth seal is not Revelation 69-11.
[13:55] That's the fifth seal. Anyone that says
[13:57] different is deceived. They're a liar.
[14:01] They're a heretic. They're an idoltor of
[14:03] the tapes.
[14:05] The 77th proof is brother Ram said the
[14:08] woman has sperm and egg. So he said
[14:12] woman has sperm in questions answers
[14:14] part 164. Quote they tried it over and
[14:17] over. It's infertile to the woman's
[14:19] sperm and now they can't find it. End
[14:21] quote. So, Brother Ram says, "A woman
[14:24] has sperm." And then, Brother Ram says,
[14:26] "A woman has an egg and thirst." 1965.
[14:29] Quote, "We realize, Father, that when
[14:30] the sperm, the genes from the male and
[14:32] female come together, there is only one
[14:34] out of a million that's accepted. One
[14:36] germ from the male finds the fertile egg
[14:38] of the woman, the female, and a million
[14:40] others perish." End quote.
[14:43] So, Brother Ram said, "Women have
[14:44] sperm." And then he said, "The fertile
[14:47] egg of the woman." So, how do we
[14:49] understand this? If every word is thus
[14:51] sayith the Lord. Do women have both egg
[14:53] and sperm in order to reproduce? If
[14:56] every word is thus sayith the Lord,
[14:57] women have sperm according to questions
[15:00] answers part one 1964.
[15:03] So what is the right divided word of
[15:05] truth here? The truth is women only have
[15:07] eggs. And brother Brand must have gave a
[15:09] slip of the tongue or just made a mental
[15:11] mistake when he said infertile to the
[15:14] women's sperm. Anyone that would say
[15:18] women have sperm and it's thus sayith
[15:20] the Lord. Every word on tape is thus
[15:21] sayith the Lord and they stand behind
[15:24] the quote that animal seed is infertile
[15:26] to the woman's sperm is deceived by a
[15:29] deity spirit. Proof number 78. Brother
[15:33] Ram said we are in a reformation. And
[15:35] then he says we're not in a reformation.
[15:37] We're in a restoration. So the first
[15:40] quote is questions answers part 164.
[15:42] Brother Ram said, "I was reading about
[15:43] Martin Luther here not long ago, not
[15:45] comparing ourselves with that, but this
[15:47] is a reformation just the same as that
[15:49] was." End quote. So, Brother Ram said,
[15:51] "His ministry is a reformation." And
[15:54] then he says in the church age book,
[15:56] quote, "The Lutheran Age did not restore
[15:58] the church. It started a reformation."
[16:00] I'm going to skip down a little bit.
[16:02] Quote, now notice in verse 25, it tells
[16:05] why we need a restoration. End quote. So
[16:08] in this quote in the church age book,
[16:10] brother Random is showing that Luther
[16:12] was a reformation, but his ministry was
[16:14] a restoration because he's using Joel
[16:17] 2:23-26.
[16:19] And he's talking about how God is going
[16:21] to restore the church. God isn't going
[16:24] to plant a new church, but he's going to
[16:26] bring back his original planting back to
[16:27] the original seed. So what is the
[16:30] rightly divided word of truth? Are we in
[16:31] a reformation or a restoration? Why I
[16:34] believe the rightly divided word of
[16:36] truth is that we're in a restoration
[16:37] according to Joel chapter 2 23-26
[16:40] because brother Ram said with thus
[16:41] sayith the Lord I'll restore sayith the
[16:44] Lord and the fullness of Pentecost will
[16:46] be in the bride with thus sayith the
[16:48] Lord. But what does a tape worshipper do
[16:50] when brother Ram said he was in a
[16:53] reformation just the same as theirs
[16:54] were? Are we in a reformation or not?
[16:57] Brother Ram said we were in one place in
[16:59] one place he said we weren't. We're in a
[17:01] restoration. So, do you stand behind
[17:03] every quote? And do you believe we're in
[17:05] a reformation and a restoration? Which
[17:08] one are we in? So, I hope you can see
[17:09] the deception and the folly of saying
[17:13] every quote on tape is thus sayith the
[17:15] Lord. In one quote, he says we're in a
[17:17] reformation. In the next quote, he says
[17:20] we're not in a reformation, we're in a
[17:21] restoration. Thank God for the Holy
[17:24] Ghost to lead and guide us into all
[17:25] truth. Proof number 79. Brother Ram said
[17:29] he can't interpret God's word and no man
[17:31] can interpret God's word. But then he
[17:33] says prophets were called to interpret
[17:35] God's word. In [clears throat] 1964 when
[17:38] their eyes were open, brother Ram said,
[17:39] quote, God don't need any interpreter. I
[17:42] can't interpret his word. Neither can
[17:44] anybody interpret his word. He don't
[17:46] need nobody to tell this is that or that
[17:50] is that. He does it himself. Our
[17:52] interpretations is nothing to the
[17:54] scripture. He speaks it himself and
[17:56] that's the way it is. End quote.
[17:58] I think I made a video about this quote
[17:59] before, but brother Ram said he cannot
[18:01] interpret God's word. No one else can.
[18:04] So if that is thus sayith the Lord,
[18:06] brother Ram did not interpret God's
[18:08] word. And so Tate Boy cannot say brother
[18:11] Ram interpreted God's word because
[18:12] brother Ram said he can't interpret his
[18:14] word and nobody else can. But then 8
[18:16] days later in God identifying himself by
[18:19] his characteristics 64 brother Ram said
[18:21] quote that was the characteristic of a
[18:23] prophet was when he foretold things and
[18:25] it happened. Now that was his
[18:27] characteristic of his identification
[18:29] that God was with him then that gave him
[18:31] the rights to interpret the word for
[18:33] that day because the word of God come to
[18:34] the prophets the characteristic of the
[18:37] prophet that he foretold end quote and
[18:39] there's many quotes like this friends if
[18:41] you listen to tapes of brother Brandham
[18:42] where he says God needs a prophet to
[18:44] interpret the word of God. Brother Ram
[18:46] even prayed in questions answers part
[18:48] 164. Quote, "We pray God that you'll
[18:50] give us prophets to interpret this word
[18:52] to us that we might know whether we're
[18:54] right or wrong." End quote. So what is
[18:57] the rightly divided word of truth here?
[18:59] Well, I believe both quotes can be true.
[19:02] No prophet of their own ability can
[19:04] interpret the word of God. I believe
[19:05] that's what brother Brandham is saying
[19:07] in the first quote when their eyes were
[19:08] open when he said, "I can't interpret
[19:09] his word. Neither can anybody interpret
[19:11] his word." In other words, there's no
[19:13] ability inside the prophet himself.
[19:15] Brother Brandon, Paul, Moses, Joshua,
[19:17] any other prophet. No prophet has any
[19:20] human ability to interpret God's word on
[19:22] their own. They need help from the Holy
[19:24] Ghost. They need a gift of a prophet to
[19:26] do that. And that gift comes from the
[19:28] Holy Ghost. So, I believe both quotes
[19:30] work together when you fully understand
[19:32] what brother Ram's talking about and the
[19:34] rest of the scripture. But I challenge
[19:35] any tape worshipper. Brother Ram said,
[19:37] "I can't interpret his word." And
[19:40] brother Ram said he has nothing to do
[19:43] with that seventh star, that seventh
[19:44] church age messenger. I challenge any
[19:46] tape worshipper to tell me they believe
[19:48] both of those. And then they'll see they
[19:51] don't believe every word on tape and not
[19:52] every word on tape is thus sayith the
[19:54] Lord. So sad these people are liars.
[19:56] They're deceived. They're anointed with
[19:59] the deity spirit. They need to repent.
[20:01] The 80th and final proof for this video
[20:04] is brother Ram said Elisha
[20:07] said do will not fall till I call for
[20:10] it. This was in spiritual food in due
[20:12] season 1965.
[20:14] Quote the same place that Elisha walked
[20:17] up and said why the dew will not fall
[20:19] till I call for it. End quote.
[20:22] Brother Ram said Elisha who came after
[20:25] Elijah said do will not fall till he
[20:28] called for it. But later on the sermon,
[20:30] brother Ram said it was Elijah. He said
[20:34] in paragraph 12, quote, "And Elijah the
[20:36] Tishbite said unto Ahab, there shall not
[20:39] be due nor rain these three years, but
[20:41] according to my word." End quote.
[20:44] Paragraph 33, quote, Elijah, he
[20:46] represented, "It wasn't going to rain
[20:48] now according to the word of the Lord,
[20:49] for three for 3 years and 6 months or
[20:52] until Elijah called for it." End quote.
[20:56] So in the same sermon you have brother
[20:57] Ram saying the person who called for no
[21:01] due to fall for three and a half years
[21:02] was two different people. It was both
[21:04] Elijah and Elisha. Well can't be both.
[21:07] So which one is the rightly divided word
[21:09] of truth? Well of course according to
[21:10] the Bible it was Elijah
[21:12] not Elisha. And anyone that would say
[21:15] Elisha was the one who called for due
[21:18] from heaven is deceived in a sad
[21:20] spiritual condition. They're a fool.
[21:22] They're a heretic. They are an idoltor
[21:25] of tapes. They worship a man. And the
[21:28] Bible pleads with us over and over again
[21:30] in the New Testament to keep ourselves
[21:32] from idols. Yet these people go year
[21:34] after year after year of saying they
[21:36] believe everything on the tapes is thus
[21:38] sayith the Lord. They stand behind every
[21:40] quote from 47 to 65 and they call people
[21:43] like me devils. And anyone who has an
[21:46] honest heart and is just trying to
[21:47] rightly divide the word of truth and
[21:49] take every word of brother back to the
[21:51] Bible, they call us devils. So friends,
[21:53] God will be the judge. Pride goes before
[21:55] the fall. Our duty is humble ourselves
[21:57] and keep doing what the Bible said and
[21:58] brother Ram said, rightly divide the
[22:00] word of truth, prove all things, test
[22:01] every spirit. Search the scripture daily
[22:03] whether these things be so. Thank you
[22:05] for watching part four. Lord willing to
[22:08] part five here in the future by God's
[22:09] grace. If you have any questions,
[22:12] concerns, or testimonies about this
