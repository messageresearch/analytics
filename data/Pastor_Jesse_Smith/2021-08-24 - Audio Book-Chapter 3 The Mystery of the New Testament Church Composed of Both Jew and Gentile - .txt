TRANSCRIPT
========================================
chapter 3 the mystery of the new testament church composed of both jew and gentile chapter 3 includes footnotes numbers 369-461 mystery number 3 of 12 how that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery as i wrote a four in few words whereby when ye read you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of christ which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the spirit that the gentiles should be fellow heirs and of the same body and partakers of his promise in christ by the gospel ephesians chapter 3 verses 3 through 6 knowing israel's position through god's covenant promises is necessary so you can understand your own for example if you're born jewish either accept christ as your messiah or remain ever faithful to the mosaic covenant if you're a gentile god has offered you a part of the new covenant whichever background you come from jew or gentile the next mystery shows how god planned and produced one new testament church composed of both jew and gentile the confusion about jews and gentiles composing one church the confusion about jew and gentiles composing one church centers on whether or not god would allow a previously unholy sinful people the gentiles into his holy separated family as you read the old testament the lord makes it clear only israel is his people under the mosaic covenant deuteronomy 14 verse 2 states for thou art and holy people unto the lord thy god and the lord hath chosen thee to be a peculiar people unto himself above all the nations that are upon the earth again if israel only obeyed god's commands he would set thee on high above all nations of the earth and all these blessings shall come upon thee and overtake thee if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the lord thy god would abraham's god raise up all other nations to the same honor and blessing as israel if so could jews and gentiles become one family and god entitled to the same benefits and inheritances the revelation of the mystery of one church composed of jew and gentile is that every born-again believer is part of god's family and entitled to all its rights benefits and future inheritances while this may not seem like a confusing issue to you it was a major issue during bible times this subject might not seem mysterious because you're likely living in the western civilization that's been established in judeo-christian culture for over 400 years the bulk of this chapter explores how god broke down the spiritual and physical walls that separated jews and gentiles through apostles paul and peter but a short section will address how westerners like myself and possibly you may be surprised or even confused how jews can be part of today's new testament church since we've been accustomed to gentiles only in the new covenant it can be difficult to imagine how a messianic jew might worship christ thankfully our gracious god offers liberties within the new covenant and values diversity within holiness biblical evidence for the revelation about jew and gentiles composing one church god hand-picked and separated israel to be holy unto himself exclusive of other nations thus forming the abrahamic covenant isaac was abraham's true seed of promise although abraham had seven other sons god further narrowed his choice on isaac's son jacob out of whom came the twelve tribes of israel although esau was his firstborn jacob's family went into egypt with 75 people but came out with possibly a few million because the first count of israel's men was six hundred thousand according to exodus 12 verses 37 and 38 there were women children and a mixed multitude to add to this sum as promised god blessed the wombs of israeli women through fruitfulness and multiplication yet god had made provision for gentiles god's provision for gentile proselytes in the old testament although not specifically called to judaism gentiles called strangers or sojourners were often accepted as proselytes beginning with abraham's covenant in genesis 17 verse 12 and verse 27 god prepared abraham and his descendants to accept proselytes the number of proselytes steadily increased until solomon 500 years after the egypt exodus gave a definite number of gentiles so journey with israel to be 153 600. male gentile converts were required to be circumcised in accordance with abraham's covenant proselytes enjoyed many privileges within mosaic law but males could never be priests whose offices were designed only for sons of levi all gentile proselytes kept moses's law including commands such as observing the sabbath keeping passover laws rejoicing on feast days ceremonial purifying from uncleanness through the red heifer's waters of separation god chose to use numerous gentiles in important and supernatural ways prominent gentile converts within judaism include rahab the gentile harlot of jericho the first recorded gentile proselyte joshua chapters two and six show she was spared from her city's destruction when she received and protected israel's two spies her record token signified her faith in israel's god rahab later married salman a prince of judah and great-grandfather of david putting her in the lineage of jesus christ ruth the moabitus a childless widow who chose to sojourn back to israel with her mother-in-law naomi after hearing israel had bread her godly virtue caught the attention of the wealthy bethlehemite named boaz who redeemed both she and naomi boaz was a son of solomon rahab's husband ruth and boaz wed and she bore obed the grandfather of david out of whose loins came christ uriah the hittite husband of bathsheba whom david slew in order to take his wife beforehand he was one of david's mighty men and chief officers his loyalty to israel the lord and his battles demonstrate extraordinary devotion to jehovah prophecy foretelling gentiles receiving god's new covenant building upon those gentile heroes at least four old testament prophets foretold god's will to unite the gentiles into his family through the new covenant god himself foretold his grace in genesis 12 3 saying in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed paul validates god's personal prophecy about the gentiles in galatians 3 verse 8 and the scripture foreseeing that god would justify the heathen through faith preached before the gospel unto abraham saying in thee shall all nations be blessed four human prophets that foretell god's grace to the gentiles are david isaiah hosea and jeremiah in the psalms david twice mentions all nations worshiping the lord psalm 22 verse 27 reads all the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the lord and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee he adds all nations whom thou has made shall come and worship before thee o lord and shall glorify thy name isaiah provides at least five references to the gentiles in chapter 9 verse 2 he writes the people that walked in darkness have seen a great light they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death upon them hath the light shined matthew 4 verses 13-16 explains this was prophecy fulfilled in jesus ministry to the gentiles isaiah 11 verse 10 says and in that day there shall be a root of jesse which shall stand for an end sign of the people to it shall the gentiles seek and his rest shall be glorious jesus is undoubtedly the root of jesse as he brought the soul rest of the baptism of the holy ghost according to both jesus and paul a third reference is isaiah 42 verses 1 through 9 and verse 1 reads behold my servant whom i uphold mine elect in whom my soul delighteth i have put my spirit upon him he shall bring forth judgment to the gentiles matthew 12 verses 14 through 21 proves this was also fulfilled in jesus's earthly ministry isaiah 49 verse 6 prophesied that in addition to restoring the tribes of israel the messiah would shine light for the gentiles paul and barnabas quote isaiah saying for so hath the lord commanded us saying i have set thee to be a light of the gentiles that thou should us be for salvation unto the ends of the earth finally isaiah 60 verse 3 tells us that the gentiles shall come to thy light and kings to the brightness of thy rising acts 26 verse 23 reiterates that christ's resurrection would show light unto the people and to the gentiles hosea 2 verse 23 provides a well-known gentile prophecy and i will say to them which were not my people thou art my people and they shall say thou art my god paul is inspired by the holy spirit to cite hosea in romans 9 verses 24 through 26 as proof of god offering his spirit to the gentiles even us whom he hath called not of the jews only but also of the gentiles as he saith also in hosea i will call them my people which were not my people and her beloved which was not beloved and it shall come to pass that in the place where it was said unto them ye are not my people there shall they be called the children of the living god jeremiah also prophesies of the gentiles coming to know the true god in chapter 16 verses 19 through 21 o lord my strength and my fortress and my refuge in the day of affliction the gentiles shall come unto thee from the ends of the earth and shall say surely our fathers have inherited lies vanity and things wherein there is no prophet shall a man make gods unto himself and there are no gods therefore behold i will this once cause them to know i will cause them to know mine hand and my might and they shall know that my name is the lord jesus first offers the gospel to the jews as god's covenant people israel was obligated to have the first chance to receive the new covenant jesus sent his disciples only to the jews in matthew 10 verses 5 through 7. 12 jesus sent forth and commanded them saying go not into the way of the gentiles and into any city of the samaritans enter ye not but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of israel and as you go preach saying the kingdom of heaven is at hand jesus recognized the gentiles defiled condition in matthew 15 verses 22 through 24 calling them dogs while calling israel children later though after israel steadfastly opposed his ministry jesus the one shepherd called the gentiles his other sheep he must bring into his one fold in john 10 16. jesus's parable of the wicked husbandman in matthew 21 verses 33-46 tells the same story god first offers his kingdom to israel the husbandman in the parable but they kill the son of the husbandman representing christ jesus interprets this parable for the jews in their ears saying therefore i say unto you the kingdom of god shall be taken from you and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof recall isaiah 60 verse 3 which says the gentiles shall come to thy light the light of jesus's gospel came to the jews first acts 3 verses 25 and 26 records peter telling jews god sent his son jesus unto you first to bless them with forgiveness of sins paul taught the power of god through christ was preached first to the jew in romans 1 verse 16. the gospel was meant to be their light as the prophets foretold but once rejected and blasphemed the light went to the gentiles the book of acts and peter's keys to the kingdom although most jews rejected jesus and supported his crucifixion a small remnant of believers trusted in him and knew he was alive and raised from the dead a portion of this group waited in jerusalem for 10 days and on the day of pentecost received the new covenant the baptism of the holy ghost according to acts chapters 1 and 2. fittingly peter was jesus's spokesman on that day as three thousand souls were added to the faith jesus previously gave peter the keys to the kingdom in matthew 16 verses 18 to 19 and at pentecost he used them first jesus says the kingdom of god is the baptism of the holy ghost within the believer in luke 17 verse 21 behold the kingdom of god is within you both john the baptist and christ call the inward filling of the holy ghost a baptism in matthew 3 verse 11 and acts 1 verse 5 respectively reading further in the book of acts the gospel begins spreading to non-jews beginning with the samaritans in acts 8 verses 1 through 40. surprisingly it was the persecution of saul later paul which brought about the spread of christianity to the gentiles before converting to christianity saul indirectly helped spread it to the very people group that christ would later send him directly to paul helped the gentiles receive jesus's gospel both before he was converted and after his conversion acts 8 shows philip the jewish evangelist preaching with miraculous signs and wonders to the samaritans half jews despised by full-blooded jews causing many to repent of their sins and accept water baptism philip then calls for peter and john to come pray and lay hands on them to receive the baptism of the holy ghost herein is the second time peter uses the keys to the kingdom for when he and john pray for the samaritans they are born again for as yet he was found upon none of them only they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus then laid they their hands on them and they received the holy ghost peter used the keys to the kingdom a third time to open the door of salvation to gentiles in acts chapter 10 following a supernatural vision in which god chose peter his soon intention to save the unclean gentiles the apostle goes with three men to the house of cornelius a roman centurion corneos was already a devoted follower of christ having a disciplined life of prayer fasting and almsgiving yet he hadn't been baptized yet peter's short sermon about god's divine plan to use jesus death and resurrection as a means to save and forgive whosoever believeth causes the holy ghost to fall on all them which heard the word this is amazing news the gentiles are now receiving god's blessings equal to the jews upon hearing this news the jewish christians in judea were upset and contended with peter when he returned to their company they accused peter of defiling himself by eating with uncircumcised men peter recounts the events in corneos's house to the apostles and brethren declaring that the holy ghost fell in corneos's house the same as it did on the day of pentecost according to jesus promise to baptize believers with the holy ghost humbled by god's spirit being poured out upon the gentiles as a gift peter says what was i that i could withstand god peter's story satisfies the apostles and acts 11 verse 18 reads when they heard these things they held their peace and glorified god saying then hath god also to the gentiles granted repentance unto life cornelius house then is a great turning point for the new covenant because god now shares his holy spirit gift with gentiles even though the men had not kept the circumcision token of abraham's covenant this turning point is a new spiritual time and season jesus labels the times of the gentiles in luke 21 24 and paul tells you it lasts for only a limited time romans 11 verse 25 declares the jews are blinded to christ until the fullness of the gentiles become in paul's gentile dispensation and peter's apostleship to jews you learn in chapter 2 that the apostle paul was given a dispensation or stewardship to preach christ's gospel to the gentiles according to first corinthians 9 17 ephesians 3 verse 2 and colossians 1 verse 25. herein we recognize paul's divine assignment to the gentiles first corinthians 9 17 says this sensation was committed or entrusted to paul for if i do this thing willingly i have a reward but if against my will a dispensation of the gospel is committed unto me ephesians 3 verses 1 and 2 tells you the gentile dispensation was given to him by god for this cause i paul the prisoner of jesus christ for you gentiles if ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of god which has given me to you word this verse proves paul's dispensation was the time he would oversee the ministry of grace in a stewardship given solely to him by jesus colossians 1 verse 25 explains his dispensation is a fulfillment of god's word or prophecy whereof i am made a minister according to the dispensation of god which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of god god specifically chose paul to take the gospel to gentiles while choosing peter to take it to the jews these were not two gospels but one for there is one faith scripture says both men had an apostleship to their respective group paul was god's apostles of the gentiles and peter was the apostle to the jews galatians 2 verses 7 through 9 reads but contrary-wise when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me as the gospel of the circumcision was unto peter for he that wrought effectually in peter to the apostleship of the circumcision the same was mighty in me toward the gentiles and when james cephas and john who seem to be pillars perceive the grace that was given unto me they gave to me and barnabas the right hands of fellowship that we should go unto the heathen and they unto the circumcision paul and peter are significant choices as messengers of god's new covenant for both men had experienced jesus's life-changing power paul had previously dragged christians to jail denying christ and urging them to blaspheme jesus peter had boasted of his devotion to jesus before denying him with cursing three times on the night of jesus's arrest paul and peter's friends families and acquaintances witness their spiritual transformation from failures to bold followers of jesus god's selection of paul as the herald of this gentile dispensation leaves no doubt to its authenticity because paul was originally a hebrew of hebrews in other words paul or saul was a staunch zealous mosaic covenant jew who likely despised gentiles for their uncleanness in our minds he would seem to be an unlikely choice to open the door of fellowship to the gentiles previous to christ humbling him through his conversion paul aggressively opposed any gentile defiling his hebrew synagogue and lifestyle saul kept moses's law along with the man-made traditions of the pharisees but once knowing christ's love paul counted all his efforts in man-made pharisee traditions as dung that he might win christ paul knew what it meant to violently oppose god's plans but later received grace from jesus christ with this experience he could freely preach grace to the gentiles who also once opposed god's holiness the moment paul turned to the gentiles acts 13 verses 14 through 52 captures the moment paul turned his ministry to the gentiles while on his first missionary journey with barnabas in antioch jewish leaders in a synagogue offer an opportunity for paul and barnabas to speak on the sabbath god's word is so true his gifts make room for themselves if god sends you to speak for him he will provide opportunities and listeners paul stands and preaches israel's history beginning with the exodus from egypt then going through joshua's conquest of canaan the judges then kings building to john the baptist's words about the one coming after him jesus christ the apostle then shows forgiveness through jesus death and resurrection followed by a warning to believe it a week later nearly the whole city comes to hear paul preach but certain jews were filled with envy after seeing other jews and gentiles believing in christ the angry jews contradict and blaspheme palm barnabas causing the apostles to announce god's official turning from the jews to the gentiles then paul and barnabas waxed bold and said it was necessary that the word of god should first have been spoken to you but seeing you put it from you and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life lo we turn to the gentiles for so hath the lord commanded us saying i have set thee to be a light of the gentiles that thou shouldst be for salvation unto the ends of the earth and when the gentiles heard this they were glad and glorified the word of the lord and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed this particular event gives evidence to blinded jews being responsible for their blindness paul says jews judge themselves unworthy of everlasting life paul says jews judge themselves unworthy of everlasting life god did not forcefully blind israel outside of their freemore agency rather israel wanted to disbelieve in blaspheme christ by foreknowledge god planned for this moment in advance and prepared paul and barnabas to herald his loving grace to the spiritually hungry gentiles after many more missionary travels paul returned to antioch and shared how god had opened the door of faith to the gentiles in acts 14 verse 27 and when they were come and had gathered the church together they rehearsed all that god had done with them and how he had opened the door of faith unto the gentiles since israel would not return to him in obedience he would leave her and turn to the gentiles paul's gospel as christ's judgment standard to say paul's teachings are important would be a gross understatement galatians 1 verses 6 through 12 and romans 2 verse 16 boldly declare curses upon anyone who changes paul's teachings because they will be christ's judgment standard on judgment day paul calls any variation to his teachings perversions in galatians 1 verses 6 and 7. then in verses 8 through 9 he gives a double warning of a curse to those who do change his original gospel message but though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you let him be accursed as we said before so say i now again if any man preach any other gospel unto you then that ye have received let him be accursed you might wonder why such strong words verses 10 through 13 state the reason paul received his initial gospel teachings and thereby authority directly from jesus christ himself and not from himself or other men anyone changing paul's teachings were actually changing christ's teachings which would warrant a curse as proverbs 30 verses 5 and 6 and revelation chapter 22 verses 18 and 19 support notice verse 8 again how paul says he and his fellow preachers we as well as angels cannot change one word christ taught him it seems likely from galatians 1 verse 17 paul received his revelations from christ in the wilderness of arabia jesus didn't send paul to a seminary although god used those in the past nor did jesus send paul to learn from peter no christ had a special ministry for paul and needed to teach him personally face to face imagine paul communing with the same light that caused his conversion on the road to damascus but now he's not persecuting jesus the light but letting the light teach him the divine revelation of the mystery of god bible readers may be reminded of another prophet moses communing with the eternal light in the wilderness in order to receive the revelation of the ten commandments a modern example of god meeting a prophet in the wilderness is detailed in chapter 13. romans 2 verse 16 says god will judge the secrets of men by paul's gospel in the day when god shall judge the secrets of men by jesus christ according to my gospel of course paul is not claiming his teachings came from his own mind when he writes my gospel but rather from his dispensation or stewardship from jesus christ as galatians 1 verse 12 and ephesians 3 verse 2 state understand not every word paul uttered from his lips nor wrote with his pen was from jesus as thus saith the lord satan forever labors to deceive men into worshiping other men as paul experienced and recorded in first corinthians 1 verses 12-15 the apostle said he was thankful he baptized none of the corinthians for they might have said they were baptized by paul in paul's name paul's own words admit he was not perfect nor infallible only his teachings from jesus carried authority the apostle writes in romans 3 verse 4 and verses 13 and 14 that all men lie and let deceit and bitter words spew from their mouths paul also said he sinned and did things he hated in romans 7 verses 15-19 although paul was not infallible his revealed gospel from jesus christ was paul's revelation from jesus was god's divine will for mankind and all will be judged by paul's epistles this means paul's inspired words about doctrine and christian living need resounded today since much of christendom rejects jesus's revelation the following divine gospel truths will either witness for or against mankind on judgment day and should not be added to nor deleted from pulpits water baptism is full immersion in water not sprinkling and should be administered in the literal name of the lord jesus christ no person in scripture was baptized in the titles of father son and holy ghost paul baptized ephesians in the literal name of the lord jesus in acts 19 verse 5. the godhead recognized as a genuine divine mystery by paul is never referred to as three persons instead paul says jesus is the image of the invisible god the hebrews writer likely paul says jesus is the image of god's one person in hebrews 1 verse 3. paul taught all churches appropriate hair length men have short cut hair while women have long uncut hair according to first corinthians 4 verse 17 and first corinthians 11 verses 1 through 16. modest clothing was commanded to christian women by paul in 1st timothy 2 verse 9. i wrote my first book on this subject and i'll provide you a free copy if you cannot afford one women preachers were forbidden by paul who said men only can teach other men in 1st timothy 2 verse 12 and 1st corinthians 14 verses 34 and 35 paul and other apostles never asked anyone to invite jesus into their hearts for salvation but rather preach repentance in anticipation for a later infilling of the holy ghost baptism paul's extensive teaching on the revelation of one church apostle paul writes extensively on this revelation of jews and gentiles composing one church he labels this subject as a mystery and fittingly provides sufficient evidence proving god accepts both jew and gentile into christ's body the church the following scriptures detail the one church romans 16 verses 25 and 26 first corinthians 12 verse 13 galatians 3 verses 6 through 29 ephesians 2 verses 11 through 22 ephesians 3 verses 1 to 21 and colossians 1 verse 27 colossians 3 verse 11 and colossians 4 verse 3. it's essential to read the entire book of romans as chapters 1 through 5 show the universal need for jews and gentiles to receive the righteousness of jesus christ he has graciously provided then chapters 6 through 8 teach how the new man or spirit-filled believer overcomes sin understands the mosaic covenant and walks in the holy spirit israel's downfall and unbelief the mystery of her blindness and her prophesied return to christ are taught in chapters 9 through 11. the one faith or guidelines for christian living are expressed in chapters 12 through 16. in romans 16 verses 25-27 paul ends his monumental teaching letter by telling believers god is going to establish and strengthen them according to the preaching of the revelation of the mystery of his gospel paul's revelation is that god wants all gentiles to obey the one faith this revelation was kept secret since the world began but now is main manifest and by the scriptures of the prophets according to the commandments of the everlasting god made known to all nations for the obedience of faith first corinthians 12 13 states paul's revelation that both jews and gentiles become a part of jesus's body through the baptism of the holy ghost for by one spirit are we all baptized into one body whether we be jews or gentiles whether we be bond or free and have been all made to drink into one spirit any jew or gentile with the baptism of the holy ghost is part of the family of god having the same benefits and inheritance abraham's spiritual seed galatians chapter 3 unpacks paul's revelation from jesus that anyone whether jew or gentile with faith in christ is a spiritual seat of abraham paul's letter to the galatians was probably one of his first epistles and shows how directly and intensely he attacked legalism and heresies in chapter 3 paul pleads with the galatians to avoid legalism especially since they started serving jesus by faith the apostle refers his readers to abraham and his justification by faith alone and quotes genesis 12 3 to prove abraham's seed is now a spiritual seed with the same justification it's amazing how much revelation god placed in this one short verse god foretold the times of the gentiles two thousand years in advance four verses teach that anyone with faith in jesus is a spiritual seed of abraham verse 7 says know ye therefore that they which are of faith the same are the children of abraham verse 9 says so then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful abraham verse 26 says for ye are all children of god by faith in christ jesus and verse 29 says and if ye be christ then are ye abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise the rest of chapter 3 highlights jesus the true seed of abraham taking the curse of the law upon himself so that we might be justified by faith in him paul then emphasizes the promise of the spirit or baptism of the holy ghost in their souls calling it the blessing of abraham the baptism of the holy ghost is a spiritual circumcision the new testament token for abraham's seed romans 2 verse 29 says it's the circumcision of the heart the chapter ends by stating those baptized into christ have put on christ's righteousness and shall inherit all of abraham's blessings genuine christians are abraham's spiritual seed by faith with the spiritual circumcision given to the jew first and also to the gentile to dissolve all doubts paul uses galatians chapter 4 to further prove his point twice his emphasis is on the born again experience the holy ghost baptism of the soul verses 1 through 7 explained god's spirit in your heart changes you from a slave to a son which is called the adoption of sons a second mention is in verse 29 as paul declares those born after the spirit are children of the free woman meaning you are abraham's true offspring and therefore inherit the promised blessings christ creates one body and one temple in ephesians chapters 2 and 3 paul both identifies and explains the mystery and revelation of god's new church chapter 2 begins with 10 memorable verses magnifying god's work in saving us by grace through faith beginning in verses 11 and 12 paul tells the ephesians to remember their hopeless gentile condition prior to knowing christ they were without christ being aliens from the commonwealth of israel and strangers from the covenants of promise having no hope and without god in the world verse 13 says they were far away from god but are now made nigh by the blood of christ in verse 14 paul declares jesus is our peace because he has made jews and gentiles one by breaking down the middle wall of partition between them paul is likely referring to the wall in herod's temple separating gentiles from jews upon the wall hung an inscription written in latin and greek warning gentiles of certain death if they would enter the inner courts beyond their court named the court of the gentiles in other words it was immediate war with jewish temple guards if a gentile attempted to get physically closer to worshipping almighty god jews enjoyed worship closer to god as the core of women and court of men surrounded the core of priests where sacrifices were offered christ's blood tears down this wall abolishing all the commandments against gentiles creating peace with god for both jew and gentile paul paints two pictures of the new unity in christ for jews and gentiles one body and one temple the cross makes them one new man in one body and christ is the head of this body this new body has access to father god through the one spirit the one holy temple is paul's second picture in verses 19 through 22 the apostle announces gentiles are fellow citizens alongside jews in the household of god this new holy temple has jesus christ as the chief cornerstone and the foundation of the apostles and prophets christian jews and gentiles are built upon this magnificent foundation making the temple grow together into god's dwelling place and habitation of god through the spirit paul's one temple imagery was divinely foreshadowed in the construction of solomon's temple one thousand years before christ this awe-inspiring temple took seven years to complete which foreshadowed jesus using seven church ages to build his spiritual temple during the times of the gentiles fascinatingly solomon didn't rely solely upon jewish help for its construction 1st kings 5 details solomon's partnership with a gentile king hiram of tyree in order to finish the temple both kings and their people jews and gentiles partnered together in making god's natural earthly habitation as a beautiful type of christian jews and gentiles composing the one temple of god's spiritual habitation the body of christ god's spiritual temple he dwells in today is currently under construction being built with devoted jewish and gentile hearts in ephesians chapter 3 paul calls himself a prisoner of jesus christ for you gentiles that he should preach among the gentiles the unsearchable riches of christ and to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery paul was a love slave for christ's will his calling was to preach jesus's amazing multifaceted love to gentiles as verses 17-19 affirm the apostle wants all men to see the fellowship of the mystery or joint participation in the greek verses 6 and 12 declare both jews and gentiles participate in partaking of god's promises by having full access to jesus christ ephesians 3 verse 5 emphatically declares this revelation was in other ages not made known unto the sons of men as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the spirit you learn even god's prophets cannot know revelations until the almighty ordains it additionally there can be no hard feelings towards jews for their previous separation from gentiles because it was ordained by the father how exciting it must have been for paul and those ephesians to know god was now presently revealing a mystery and they were the first to hear it another revelation of the mystery is that the one body of christians both alive on earth and those in heaven have one family name the lord jesus christ as verses 14 and 15 teach the name above all names is the lord jesus christ as the book of acts records believers being baptized in this name devils being cast out in this name and miracles being done in this all-sufficient name acts 4 verse 12 forever proclaims there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved in ephesians 3 verses 14 through 21 paul ends the chapter offering prayer that the ephesians would experience the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man his emphasis is on christ's spirit dwelling inside each believer also called the baptism of the holy ghost paul wants them to know the depths of christ's love which allows believers to be filled with all the fullness of god throughout all ages the church will glorify christ for sharing his power that worketh in us although in prison paul beseeches the prayers of his ephesian converts to pray for all men including paul ephesians 6 verses 18 through 20 records paul's main prayer request for boldness to share this beautiful revelation with anyone willing to listen praying always and for me that utterance may be given unto me that i may open my mouth boldly to make known the mystery of the gospel for which i am an ambassador in bonds that therein i may speak boldly as i ought to speak letter to the colossians paul's letter to the colossians another prison epistle supports the revelation of one church a city in present-day turkey about 100 miles east of ephesus colosse had a christian church through the missionary work of paul's helper epiphrus this letter is perhaps best known for giving the most complete expression of jesus christ supreme deity in chapter 1 verses 15-20 immediately thereafter paul names another mystery god now manifests to the gentiles christ in you the hope of glory this is the doctrine of the baptism of the holy ghost see chapter six but later in galatians 3 verses 10 through 14 paul has to remind the colossians a holy ghost-filled believer is a new man and must treat everyone in christ one body with love in jesus's one jew gentile church he is all and in all and have put on the new man which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him where there is neither greek nor jew circumcision nor uncircumcision barbarian scythian bond nor free but christ is all and in all put on therefore as the elect of god holy and beloved bows of mercies kindness humbleness of mind meekness long-suffering forbearing one another and forgiving one another if any man have a quarrel against any at the end of this letter in colossians 4 verses 2 and 4 paul echoes the same prayer requests he gave to the ephesians asking for open doors to share god's revelation continue in prayer and watch in the same with thanksgiving with all praying also for us that god would open unto us a door of utterance to speak the mystery of christ for which i am also in bonds that i may make it manifest as i ought to speak blessings and challenges in transitioning to one body the revelation of the one church mystery brings intimacy or partnership between jews and gentiles as paul wrote in ephesians 3 verse 9. examining the book of acts and paul's epistles reveals both the blessings of this partnership and the challenges that arose while transitioning to one body or one church god's blessings were apparent in paul's dealings with gentile churches three heartfelt examples include the philippians thessalonians and ephesians the church in philippi was paul's first european church started during his second missionary journey his letter to the philippians has been called his warmest and most personal in chapter 1 paul thanked god every time he remembered this church convinced god would finish the good work he began in them these christians had a place in paul's heart so much that he greatly longed to see them again the philippians loyalty to following paul's message was evident as they withstood heretics and legalists in the final chapter paul thanks the philippians for being the only church who contacted him about his physical needs having sent provisions to paul through epiphanitis paul assures them god will supply their own physical needs receive their giving as an offering to his glory and record their generosity as a deposit in their heavenly rewards bank account paul's two letters to the thessalonians demonstrate a deep emotional bond between the jewish apostle and these gentiles despite his very short stay among them this church was started during paul's second missionary trip as paul passed through thessalonica the capital city of macedonia thanksgiving and prayers were always flowing from paul's mouth for these believers because of their unceasing work of faith and labor of love despite persecutions the apostle was like a gentle nurse an instructive father among them taking nothing of theirs but giving out love only his ministry was so effective they willingly forsook their dead idols to serve the living and true god in 1st thessalonians chapter 4 paul provided much comfort to them regarding their deceased loved ones promising them a future meeting in the air with their brethren and jesus christ at his return but warnings about the antichrist spirit were communicated and disorderly and lazy brothers were given correction in his second letter in paul's eyes the thessalonian converts were his heavenly crown and his glory and joy paul's longest missionary stay was with the ephesians during his third and final missionary trip with whom he stayed three years according to acts 20 verse 31 it was through paul's teachings that 12 ephesians initially received eternal life or the baptism of the holy ghost in paul's farewell with the ephesians in acts 20 verses 17-38 one of the most touching and emotional scenes in scripture unfolds paul reminds them to imitate his humble selfless sacrifice and sincerity he taught them the whole counsel of god holding nothing good back from them he knows he's facing imprisonment and likely martyrdom but paul urges the leaders to feed and protect the saints because satan will send wolves into their flock finally in sorrow the jewish and gentile group praised and weeps together before accompanying paul to his departing ship proving christ's unsearchable love in his one body of believers and when he had thus spoken he kneeled down and prayed with them all and they all wept sore and fell on paul's neck and kissed him sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake that they should see his face no more and they accompanied him unto the ship many challenges sprang up as jew and gentile christians transitioned into one body the first challenge was likely peter's mistreatment of gentile christians recorded in galatians 2 verses 11-21 it seems this struggle happened before the jerusalem council because paul never cites the conclusions of the council in the letter to the galatians galatians tells us peter so feared legalistic jews that he refused to eat with gentiles the very men who had the keys to the kingdom from jesus received a vision straight from god about his cleansing of the gentile people and first saw the holy ghost baptized gentiles into the body of christ at cornelius house mistreated christian gentiles peter's influence was so great it caused barnabas to join him in the sinful separation but paul would have none of it was standing peter to his face in front of all the apostles and elders blaming him for hypocrisy it's believed peter repented and again fellowshipped with gentiles as he had before circumcision was the second issue in acts 15. certain jewish christians from judea were teaching gentiles must be circumcised to be saved paul and barnabas strongly resisted this teaching causing the brethren to send paul and barnabas to jerusalem to counsel with the apostles and elders about this doctrine this is often called the jerusalem council peter offers his conviction that gentiles are in fact saved and no different from christian jews paul and barnabas follow peter by sharing testimonies about god's miracles and wonders done among gentiles james gives the final convincing words to settle the matter and bring peace to every heart claiming peter's words were correct because they aligned with amos's prophecy that god would take the gentiles for his namesake in amos 9 verses 11 and 12. in that day will i raise up the tabernacle of david that has fallen and close up the breaches thereof and i'll raise up his ruins and i will build it as in the days of old that they may possess the remnant of edom and of all the heathen which are called by my name saith the lord that doeth this james's conclusion is not to trouble the gentiles with forced circumcision but give them four guidelines for the time being in acts 15 verse 20. abstain from pollution of idols abstain from fornication abstain from things strangled abstain from blood of course in the years to come jesus would reveal more truths for gentiles to live by through paul's epistles who taught the ephesians the whole council of god within his three years with them but here in acts 15 the jerusalem apostles and elders heartily receive james's sentence and send letters of this decision to all their churches making the saints rejoice in their christian freedoms a third example is again about circumcision but worthy of an individual mention which is paul's circumcision of timothy some wonder why paul would refuse to let titus be circumcised yet later paul himself would perform timothy's circumcision the answer is each case had different conditions leading to different results galatians 2 verses 3 and 4 explains titus a pure greek gentile was under pressure to come under the bondage of law keeping from false brethren paul vehemently opposed the false brothers refusing to become a part of their heretical legalistic movement timothy's circumstances were much different because no one was pressuring him to be circumcised he was half jew half greek his father didn't permit him to be circumcised as a baby yet he was diligently trained in judaism by his mother and grandmother it appears timothy voluntarily chose circumcision for three reasons he wanted to honor his judaic upbringing he didn't want to offend the jews he was associating with and he believed his circumcision might cause non-believing jews to listen to his gospel message acts 16 verse 3 says him would paul have to go forth with him and took and circumcised him because of the jews which were in those quarters for they knew all that his father was a greek as paul's travel companion timothy was in constant contact with jews and he felt he could influence them if he had the token of abraham's covenant in his flesh timothy's selflessness in regards to his physical body in order to promote the spiritual body of christians inspires believers to prayerfully seek any solution within holiness to overcome challenges to spreading the gospel of jesus christ it seems timothy followed paul's example to go to any reasonable lengths to save souls for though i be free from all men yet have i made myself servant unto all that i might gain the more and unto the jews i became as a jew that i might gain the jews to them that are under the law as under the law that i might gain them that are under the law to the weak became i is weak that i might gain the weak i am made all things to all men that i might by all means save some the feasts and holy days of israel the feasts of israel are historical worship events mandated for jews but prophetically reveal god's redemptive plan for jews and gentiles in particular the fourth feast the feast of weeks reveals god's plan to unite jews and gentiles into one body one church and more time must be devoted to its essential details kevin j connors the feast of israel provides an extensive teaching on the feasts conor writes ceremonies and all that pertains to the letter and ritual of the law are empty in vain apart from the reality in christ under the mosaic covenant god instituted three major feasts two of which had two additional minor feasts or holy days for a total of seven feasting or holy days in which israeli males were to appear before him with sacrifices three times in a year shall all thy males appear before the lord thy god in the place which he shall choose in the feast of unleavened bread and in the feast of weeks and the feast of tabernacles and they shall not appear before the lord empty every man shall give as he is able according to the blessing of the lord thy god which he hath given thee leviticus 23 provides a chronological list of the feast and holy days along with imperative details israel was to honor in both celebration and mourning depending upon god's commands feast of passover feast of unleavened bread feast of chief of first fruits feast of weeks the feast of trumpets holy day of atonement feast of tabernacles god initiated these gatherings to meet with his people on his terms the holy one appointed the meeting place and sacrifices to be offered giving his children annual meeting times to abstain from work in order to focus on their relationship with him each of the seven feasts and holy days allows you to see god's historical and prophetic purposes for israel and the gentiles the passover beginning on the 14th day of the first month of the new year at evening each family in israel sacrificed a one-year-old male lamb they were to eat a meal the lamb along with unleavened bread its historical purpose was to be a memorial of god delivering them from egyptian slavery full details are found in exodus 12 verses 1 through 29 leviticus 23 verses 4 through 5 and deuteronomy 16 verses 1 through 8. the passover's prophetic purpose was fulfilled in jesus death on calvary as he fulfilled every old testament detail to the letter truly messiah died for both jew and gentiles the sins of the entire world first john 2 verse 2 says jesus is the propitiation for our sins and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world christ delivered all from the slavery of sin paul teaches in first corinthians 5 7 believers experience a continual passover and faithfully partake of the lord's supper in remembrance of him the unleavened bread beginning on the evening of passover this bread feast lasted seven days emphasizing a diet totally separate from leaven it represented israel partaking of no egyptian influence as levin puffs up an entire lump of dough any israeli with leaven found in his house was instantly cut off from the congregation once in the promised land jewish fathers were to explain this bread feast to their children in memory of god's mighty hand to deliver israel all details are found in exodus 12 verses 8 through 39 exodus 13 verses 1 to 10 leviticus 23 verses 6 through 8 numbers 28 verses 17-25 and deuteronomy 16 verses 1 through 8. jesus christ again fulfills the prophetic purpose of this feast for his death separated us from our sins or leaven his blood washed away all sins just as the jewish houses were washed free from leaven he is the true bread of life from heaven all christians feast on continually and exclusively christ manifested sinless perfection being free from leaven or sinful influences unlike the pharisees 11 false doctrines in matthew 16 verses 11 and 12 paul teaches we still keep this spiritual feast not with old leaven neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth the sheaf of firstfruits this was the final feast of the first month observed on the day after the sabbath sunday following the passover a priest waved a sheaf of barley first fruits before the lord as a forerunner that the rest of the crop would later mature for harvest additionally a lamb burnt offering was included along with a meal and drink offering this feast is taught in exodus 23 verse 19 leviticus 23 verses 9 through 14 and numbers 28 verse 26. prophetically this feast foreshadowed the greatest day in human history the resurrection of jesus christ which took place on a sunday the first day of the week this feast was fulfilled as god not a priest waived his resurrected son before israel as the firstborn from the dead or first begotten from the dead jesus resurrection demonstrates that all believers would also experience the resurrection at harvest time or the end of the world romans 8 verse 11 promises the same holy spirit that raised christ from the dead shall also quicken our mortal bodies paul writes every man will be raised from the dead in his own order with christ being the firstfruits the wave chief and other offerings speak of jesus death and resurrection because they are inseparable the burnt offering represents jesus's sinless death through total obedience the meal and drink offerings speak of believers continual communion with christ through the lord's supper the feast of weeks also known as pentecost in the new testament the feast of weeks occurred in the third month or 50 days after first fruits the number 50 represents deliverance liberty or freedom for israel as every 50 years they celebrated the jubilee year in which slaves were released from bondage and debts and all inheritances were restored to their original owners after moses brought israel out of egypt following the passover they worshiped god and experienced the power and terror of his presence at mount sinai fifty days after the exodus while receiving the ten commandments once living in canaan israel's week's feast included numerous sacrifices two loaves of bread baked with leaven were waved before the lord israel was commanded to bring the following free will gifts burnt meat drink sin and peace offerings this feast marked the beginning of the four month harvest season in which israel was to harvest most but not all their crops in order for the poor and stranger to have food this feast is detailed in exodus 34 verses 22 and 23 leviticus 23 verses 15 through 21 numbers 28 verses 26 through 31 and deuteronomy 16 verses 9 through 12. acts chapter 2 fulfilled the feast of weeks also known as the day of pentecost the 50th day after first fruits pentecost symbolized spiritual freedom and liberty for souls of men by the baptism of the holy ghost ten days prior to this outpouring of the holy ghost jesus promised his disciples he would send this spiritual baptism and commanded them to wait for in jerusalem and being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from jerusalem but wait for the promise of the father which saith he ye have heard of me for john truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the holy ghost not many days hence but ye shall receive power after that the holy ghost has come upon you and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem and in all judea and in samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth israel's reception of the ten commandments type the pouring out of the holy ghost on the day of pentecost in figure 4 conor beautifully compares and contrasts many not all of the aspects of the giving of moses's law to the giving of the holy ghost old testament pentecost compared to new testament pentecost first the presence of god manifests in thunders lightnings thick clouds fire audible voice in the new testament the prince of god manifests in rushing mighty wind licks of fire speaking in tongues in the old testament pentecost occurred at mount sinai on the 50th day in the new testament it occurred in jerusalem near mount zion on the 50th day the old testament pentecost was the birthday of judaism through the old covenant in the new testament pentecost was the birthday of christianity through the new covenant the old testament pentecost had the giving of the law on tables of stone written by the finger of god the new testament pentecost had the giving of the holy ghost on fleshly tables of men's hearts written by the spirit of god at the old covenant pentecost three thousand souls died at the new testament pentecost three thousand souls were added to the church in the old testament pentecost it was the ministration of death through the law of sin and death in the new testament pentecost it's the ministration of life through the law of the holy spirit at the old testament pentecost there was glory on moses face in the new testament pentecost the glory of god is in the face of jesus christ in the old testament pentecost moses's face was veiled so people could not see the glory in the new testament pentecost believers have unveiled faces to be changed into the same glory of christ in the old testament pentecost the glory was to be done away with in the new testament pentecost the glory remains the most unique aspect of weeks is the waving of two leaven infused loaves of bread herein is the revelation of one church composed of both jew and gentile as these loaves are called a new meat offering unto the lord notice these two loaves are called one offering singular the two loaves are one substance just as the two peoples jew and gentile become one paul teaches this in first corinthians 10 verse 17 for we being many are one bread and one body for we are all partakers of that one bread again the apostle says having abolished in his flesh the enmity even the law of commandments contained in ordinances for to make in himself of twain one new man so making peace when the priest waved two loaves in israel he foretold god waving both spirit-filled jews and gentiles before the world the first loaf waived was the 120 born-again jewish christians on the day of pentecost soon afterwards the lord waved a second loaf the spirit born gentiles in corneos's house before peter and other witnesses the new aspect of this offering is the addition of levin which was forbidden in passover and accompanied by the threat of excommunication but in this third month of the year leaven is acceptable passover represented the sacrifice of the sinless son of god while pentecost represents the ministry of the new testament church and the sin nature that remains inside their bodies holy ghost-filled jews and gentiles still sin but do not let it have dominion over their daily lives christians now present and give their lives as offerings unto god during this new testament season leaven is a common representation for evil and sin through the baptism of the holy ghost christians become new creatures in christ jesus just as the leavened wave loaves were new offerings spirit-filled christians have both divinity christ's spirit in their souls and sin in their flesh dwelling inside them as paul explains in colossians 1 verse 27 and romans 7 verse 17 and 7 20 respectively john goes as far as saying the believer's soul the nature of the human spirit anointed with the holy ghost is the christian's true identity and cannot sin whosoever is born of god doth not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of god christ's new church would always have the element of sin to deal with but she was given the holy spirit to bring unity to other christians while overcoming sin's effects ci scofield describes the unique meaning of the two loaves contrasted to the one wave sheaf at first fruits observe it is now loaves not a sheaf of separate growths loosely bound together but a real union of particles making one homogeneous body the descent of the holy spirit at pentecost united the separated disciples into one organism at pentecost god united the souls of the christians through the indwelling power of the holy ghost causing them to have one heart and one soul this same unity spread to the gentiles at corneas house and then multiplied into many millions more gentiles leviticus 23 verses 15 through 21 speaks of five additional sacrifices of this feast that complement the two wave loaves burnt meat drink sin and peace offerings just as a burnt offering was totally consumed in devotion to god christians give themselves wholly to god's work meat and drink offerings symbolize the bread and wine believers consume in the new testament lord's supper the sin offering represents our constant need for jesus's forgiveness of sins through his heavenly role as high priest mediator the hebrew definition for peace offerings teaches these oblations stood for voluntary expressions of thanksgiving to god which christians faithfully offer through vocal praises by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to god continually that is the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name another aspect of the week's feast fulfilled in acts 2 is the holy euphoric worship by the 120 holy ghost-filled saints recall the 120 were so filled with god's spirit they left the upper room around 9 a.m and headed to jerusalem streets to boldly declare the wonderful works of god the onlookers from 17 nations were so amazed by the worship they saw and heard that they concluded they were drunk with wine acts 2 is clearly the fulfillment of deuteronomy 16 verses 10 through 12 which teaches israel was to rejoice with many people before the lord in remembrance of god granting them freedom from egypt romans 14 verse 17 validates this the kingdom of god is not meat and drink but righteousness and peace and joy in the holy ghost scripture says two different harvests took place in the first and third months barley started in the first month at first fruits and continued through the second while wheat harvest began in the third month at weeks and lasted until the seventh month exodus 34 verse 22 says weeks was the first fruits of wheat harvest while ruth 2 verse 23 differentiates the two feasts so she kept fast by the maidens of boaz to glean unto the end of barley harvest and a wheat harvest and dwelt with her mother-in-law both feasts had first fruits waived in anticipation for the rest of the crop to mature fulfilled by jesus's resurrection and the 120 being filled with the holy ghost 50 days later the feast of pentecost initiated a four month long period of wheat harvest until the next feast trumpet began in the seventh month the week's four-month period signifies the long nearly 2000 year period from 30 a.d to present in which god would offer the new covenant to both jew and gentile until the times of the gentiles were fulfilled this left lots of time to labor and harvest before the next phase of life the former and latter reigns before the final harvest reaping the wheat harvest was the main task of the feast of pentecost just as jesus's great commission emphasizes saving souls in the field of the world's nations but no harvest is possible without both former and latter reigns rain has a symbolism in both the old and new testaments on the day of pentecost peter declares the falling of the holy spirit fulfilled joel's prophecy of god pouring out his spirit in joel 2 verse 28. hosea 6 verses 1 through 3 is another evidence that god symbolizes his spirit coming down upon the people as rain his going forth is prepared as the morning and he shall come unto us as the rain as the latter and former rain unto the earth now look at the truth of the two rains necessary for harvest former and latter the purpose of the former rains were to water the seeds at the beginning of the autumnal growing season while the latter rains were the last rains necessary to bring the seed to maturity in the spring israel had a sacred year and a civil year the sacred year was from march or april to september or october the civil year was from october or november to february or march the former rains fell around october or november and the latter rains fell in the first month of the sacred year around march or april logically the latter rain had to fall in or shortly before the first month just in time for israel to harvest the barley firstfruits to be waived by the priest on the feast of first fruits the former and latter rain truth must be applied prophetically to the times of the gentiles or from 30 a.d to the present christians today are in the spiritual feast of weeks the long season of harvest before god returns to the jews in the feast of trumpets peter was clear that god was going to pour or reign his spirit upon all flesh which has been verified through the gentiles receiving the holy ghost in the book of acts and all throughout 2 000 years of church history holy ghost rain showers have fallen upon every age and its leaders from john the divine to iranians from columba to luther from wesley to wigglesworth but jesus and other prophets foretold end time conditions in the time of the gentiles before the final harvest would ultimately mere a spiritual famine due to disobedience christ asked nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth paul calls it a falling away or apostasy from truth caused by an influx of seducing spirits who grow increasingly more deceptive then amos 8 verses 11 and 12 reads behold the days come saith the lord god that i will send a famine in the land not a famine of bread nor thirst for water but of hearing the words of the lord and they shall wander from sea to sea and from the north even to the east they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the lord and shall not find it jesus describes the final wheat harvest in matthew 13 verses 24-30 and verses 36-43 christians are indeed labeled wheat matching the wheat harvest of israel's natural feast of weeks and are gathered into christ's barn but the apostate tares are burned in fire since jesus's final harvest is required before the wrath and judgment of the great tribulation former latter reigns are necessary to bring the wheat to maturity james 5 verses 7 and 8 support these prophecies giving us a promise of one more former latter rain before the last gentile harvest be patient therefore brethren unto the coming of the lord behold the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth and has long patience for it until he received the early and latter rain be also patient establish your hearts for the coming of the lord draweth nigh the holy spirit's inspiration helps us find more details about the gentile latter rain prophecy in joel 2 verses 23-26 it's a fitting location because the beginning of the new covenant is also located in this chapter joel 2 verses 28-32 verses 23-26 describe what the former and latter rain holy ghost anointings will produce in christians lives be glad then ye children of zion and rejoice in the lord your god forget given you the former rain moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month and the floor shall be full of wheat and the fat shall overflow with wine and oil and i'll restore to you the years that the locusts hath eaten the worm the caterpillar and the palmer worm my great army which i sent among you and ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the lord your god that hath dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed the hebrew word for former can mean teacher meaning christians should expect a great teaching anointing to come in preparation for the rapture harvest chapter 13 explains his teaching ministry after the former reign god plans to send a latter reign anointing or rapturing faith as his church recognizes the conditions times and seasons of the rapture she will begin seeking god for the latter rain through prayer as zechariah 10 verse 1 says ask ye of the lord rain in the time of the latter rain so the lord shall make bright clouds and give them showers of rain to every one grass in the field jesus will then send his spirit in the same measure as the day of pentecost producing the same results this divine latter rain will restore back to the final church everything the early church possessed wheat word wine joy and oil baptism of the holy ghost before the rapture harvests christ church will have the same power truth miracles and faith of the apostolic saints jesus promises to bring the last church right back to where she started at pentecost in acts 2. joel 2 verse 23 says the latter rain is sent in the first month in hebrew this phrase can mean formally at first shortly before the rapture the latter rain falls on the gentile church as it did formerly at first on the day of pentecost the feasts of the seventh month following the four month long feast of weeks came two holy days and one feast in the seventh month or september-october time period trumpets atonement and tabernacles these final holy and feast days have nothing to do with the new testament church for she is already in heaven enjoying the marriage supper of the lamb based upon first thessalonians 4 17 the church was caught up or snatched off the earth by jesus in the rapture harvest before the tribulation then god grafts israel back into his blessings and immediate focus of ministry the trumpets on the first day of the seventh month israel held a sabbath to blow trumpets and offer burnt meat and sin offerings made by fire unto the lord this day is called a holy convocation or sacred gathering or assembly trumpets were blown for many purposes but here they were to gather israel for the day of atonement or national cleansing nine days later trumpets was not a rejoicing time like weeks but rather a call to self-examination israel knew trumpets meant preparing them to appear for atonement in mourning for the tenth day was a day to afflict their souls meaning humiliation and being downcast trumpets is taught in leviticus 23 verses 23-25 and numbers 29 verses 1-6 prophetically the feast of trumpets represents the prophetic ministry of the two witnesses of revelation 11 verses 1 through 13 during the first three and a half years of daniel's 70th or final week prophet's voices are likened unto trumpets in ezekiel 33 verses 1 through 9 isaiah 58 verse 1 and hosea 8 verse 1. with the help of two prophet supernatural ministry the guileless 144 thousand faithful jews will be gathered in jerusalem hearing the two prophets preach about jesus christ prepares them to receive him at atonement as always faith comes by hearing in the meantime israel's worshiping god in their newly rebuilt temple three times daniel foretells israel offering animal sacrifices as they are currently forbidden to offer them due to their lack of a temple animal sacrifices will again be allowed as part of israel's seven year covenant with the pope antichrist but he will cut them off in the midst of the weak in order to enshrine his own abomination that works desolation the day of atonement on the tenth day of the seventh month was israel's national cleansing the most holy day of the year jews came to the temple fasting and mourning in complete humiliation of body and spirit before god almighty in a day to afflict their souls along with all routine sacrifices two goats were offered to god for atonement one died on the altar and the other carried away israel's sins far away into the wilderness describes more aspects of this atonement day saying on this day only which took place but once a year the high priest entered into the holiest of all within the veil with the blood of the lord's goat the sin offering here he sprinkled the blood on the mercy seat the blood of the sin offering on the great day of atonement brought about the cleansing of all sin all iniquity and all transgression the priesthood the sanctuary and israel as a nation experience blood atonement thus being reconciled to god atonement is taught in leviticus 16 verses 1-34 leviticus chapter 23 verses 26-32 and numbers 29 verses 7 through 11. prophetically atonement is fulfilled after the three and a half year ministry of the two witnesses when israel meets their messiah jesus christ face to face israel will acknowledge their atonement since she rejected the actual atonement two thousand years prior jesus death on the cross and heavenly acceptance having seen their two prophets raptured to heaven the 144 thousand jews glorify god as the realization of jesus as their messiah solidifies then the holy king of kings and lord of lords jesus christ physically appears to the faithful jewish remnant seeing jesus scars one brave jew will ask what are these wounds and thine hands jesus sweetly answers those with which i was wounded in the house of my friends instantly the guilt and shame of their ancestors overtakes them they are now aware how israel willingly crucified god's son the root of jesse david's righteous branch the seed of the woman this causes israel to desperately mourn as never before despite their fatal move the crucified one now calls the jews his friends amazing grace overwhelms the remnant zechariah 12 verses 10 through 14 captures their bitter humiliation and i will pour upon the house of david and upon the inhabitants of jerusalem the spirit of grace and of supplications and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced and they shall mourn for him as one mourneth for his only son and shall be in bitterness for him as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn in that day shall there be a great morning in jerusalem as the morning of hadadraman in the valley of megadon and the land shall mourn every family apart the family of the house of david apart and their wives apart the family of the house of nathan apart and their wives apart the family of the house of levi apart and their wives apart the family of shimyai apart and their wives apart all the families that remain every family apart and their wives apart israel's souls are afflicted and rightly so but then god opens a fountain of forgiveness zechariah 13 verse 1 states in that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of david and to the inhabitants of jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness being forgiven and blameless the 144 thousand can be born again by the baptism of the holy ghost also called the seal of god in their foreheads isaiah 66 verse 8 prophesied of israel's incredible spiritual birthday claiming it would happen in one day saying who hath heard such a thing who has seen such things shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day or shall a nation be born at once for as soon as zion travailed she brought forth her children with the 144 thousand born again three of gabriel's six tasks listed in daniel 9 24 are now complete finish the transgression make an end of sins and make reconciliation for iniquity israel has finally been reconciled back to god she's finally received the new covenant returning to the current new testament believer we experience our spiritual day of atonement when we're born again by the baptism of the holy ghost one requirement of being born again is repentance according to acts 2 38 repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost in the greek lexicon repent means an abhorrence of one's past sins this abhorrence matches the afflicted soul requirement of the old testament day of atonement after genuine repentance the believer obeys god's word and is soon born again by the holy ghost acts 5 verse 32 reads and we are as witnesses of these things and so is also the holy ghost whom god has given to them that obey him for this cause the church did not need to go through the tribulation period as blinded israel did her sins were already atoned for by the precious blood of jesus christ romans 5 verse 11 declares and not only so but we also joy in god through our lord jesus christ by whom we have now received the atonement the true spiritual day of atonement took place on the morning of christ's resurrection showing himself to mary magdalene first jesus said touch me not for i am not yet ascended to my father christ forbid contact to fulfill other scriptures through his death he was not only the two goats but also the spiritual red heifer of numbers 19. any priest or jew who touched the sacrificed heifer or its ashes was instantly unclean jesus knew he should not be touched yet until he presented his blood to the father after talking with mary jesus ascended to his father in heaven to present his acceptable sacrifice and obtain our redemption according to hebrews 9 verses 11 and 12 but christ being come and high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us once received in heaven and possessing our redemption christ descended back to earth on resurrection sunday and showed himself alive to the disciples no doubt he was embraced by his beloved disciples one week later he fulfilled thomas's desire to touch his scars jesus said reach hither thy finger and behold my hands and reach hither thy hand and thrust it into my side and be not faithless but believing the sacrificial work is done jesus with a new glorified body can now be touched the book of hebrews unveils jesus's complete redemptive work as god's one and only atonement for sins christ shed blood fulfilled every oblation and sacrifice cleanse the heavenly sanctuary and allowed him to be both mediator and high priest between god and man jesus can rapture his church off the earth before the tribulation because she's already cleansed by the atonement she having no condemnation through believing and receiving the baptism of the holy ghost has already passed from death unto life her soul is sealed unto the day of redemption the tabernacles following the solemn day of atonement came the celebratory tabernacles which occurred after the final harvest of the year fruit tabernacles began on the 15th day of the seventh month and lasted eight days during the first seven days israelis would rejoice while dwelling in temporary booths made from tree branches in remembrance of god making israel dwell in booths after their exodus from egypt each day involved its own burnt meat and drink offerings besides the routine daily sacrifices unto god the eighth day was a sabbath and included a final offering made by fire as a solemn assembly and holy convocation this feast is taught in leviticus 23 verses 33 through 44. prophetically israel's tabernacles foretold christ's one thousand-year millennial reign detailed in isaiah 65 verses 19 through 22 and revelation 20 verses 1 through 6. the sun's peaceful reign after the tribulation and battle of armageddon fulfills the true meaning of this feast this feast follows the final fruit harvest which has its fulfillment in revelation chapter 14. verses 13-16 show the son of man reaping the harvest of the earth which is the 144 thousand being sealed by the holy ghost in verses one through five they are called first fruits unto god and to the lamb in verse four later in the chapter verses 17-20 teach the gathering of the vine and its destruction through the wrath of god all sinners who took the mark of the beast experienced this awful judgment before the millennium with all the harvest complete you see the barley harvest of first fruits fulfilled by christ's resurrection with the old testament saints the wheat harvest of weeks represented the one church composed of jew and gentile lastly the fruit harvest before tabernacles represented the spirit sealed 144 000 jewish remnant back to tabernacles the seven days of rejoicing represents god getting his seventh day with his creation recall from genesis chapters one and two that god had six days or six thousand years of peace during his week of creation second peter 3 verse 8 explains a day with god equals a thousand years of man's time but beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day is with the lord as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day but satan interrupted god's seventh day of rest when he possessed the serpent and begowed eve into eating the fruit who shared it with adam plunging mankind into sin bondage edenic conditions will be restored and god will have a sin-free rest day living in temporary booths will be fulfilled as christ's spirit-filled followers build their own homes harvest crops and reign over cities and nations with him isaiah 65 verses 21 and 22 read and they shall build houses and inhabit them and they shall plant vineyards and eat the fruit of them they shall not build and another inhabit they shall not plant in another eat for as the days of a tree are the days of my people and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands yes the one jew gentile church will rejoice for one thousand years as satan is bound and cast into the bottomless pit with no tempter the church exercises complete joy fruitfulness peace and victory the eighth day holy convocation symbolized the beginning of the eternal covenant eight is god's number of a new beginning here the eighth day is the first day repeating which speaks of the unending cycles of eternity time is over the new jerusalem our eternal home has come down to earth out of heaven no more temporary booths or homes christ's family has made it to her eternal home everything done on earth will be done as it were in heaven since heaven has come down to earth the multi-national great multitude revelation 7 verses 9 through 17 gives you a glimpse of christ's multinational new testament church gathered before god's throne calling her a great multitude which no man could number of all nations and kindreds and people and tongues christ's word sent via the great commission did not return void every nation under heaven had the opportunity to repent and those who received it have eternal life and loudly worship their savior with cries and palm waving this great praise likely takes place in the new jerusalem as jesus leads his people to living fountains of waters the sun is not needed and he wipes away all tears from their eyes matching the future home description in revelation 21 verse 4 and 22 verses 1 through 5. every skin and hair color imaginable is beautifully represented in this eternal gathering this great white robed multitude is like a bride's expensive radiant flower bouquet kept and preserved for decoration in the couple's first home jesus is one jew gentile church is a timeless incorruptible bouquet bride the multitude's journey to god's throne wasn't easy the angel tells john they suffered through great tribulation yet wash their robes white in the blood of the lamb paul declares all that will live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecution all godly saints suffer some form of persecution but it's allowed so we'll know christ in the fellowship of his sufferings since it's a church from all nations israel must be included this shows not all jews are blinded to christ as their messiah most are blinded but not all god's immutable purpose to have a church from every nation is accomplished believers from every nation are represented because god so loved the world westerners understanding easterners converting to christ the bulk of this chapter deals with gentiles coming into relationship with the god of the jews a major issue in bible times today though westerners must recognize and understand how the gospel is returning back to easterners and god allows liberties and diversities of worship within our holy calling a brief look at the last 500 years of history allows you to trace god's revivals moving from east to west and now back to the east germany experienced revival with martin luther in the 16th century 200 years later god moved mightily in england through john wesley's ministry the azusa street revival manifested in california usa 100 years after wesley but the revival has left america because she left god's word america's laws no longer honor god as she's legalized the killing of nearly 50 million babies along with the protection of homosexual marriage indeed god is currently stirring revival fires in the middle east and china voice of the martyrs canada reports middle easterners are coming to christ by thousands upon thousands the council of foreign relations says china's christian revival is so great it may have the world's largest population of christians by 2030. you've probably realized god's revival will end up back in the east where it started in jerusalem when the 144 thousand israelis are sealed with the holy ghost during the tribulation these facts demonstrate your scriptural knowledge of god's desire to have one jew gentile church no nation tyrant military or leader can stop god's predestined plan to save souls in every nation chinese muslims hindus and more are all coming into the open door of faith unto the gentiles jesus assures us he is the door and saves all who come through him in john 10 verse 9 i am the door for by me if any man enter in he shall be saved and shall go in and out and find pasture it's necessary and natural for western-born christians to rejoice in god's mighty move in the east and pray for every lost soul to find salvation in christ concerning christian liberties god allows believers to express their faith in different ways within his holy plan four examples include foods observance of holy days wine and jewelry a full teaching addresses these topics in my book restoring christian modesty god's perfect will for your outward appearance eastern christians may make different choices than westerners in food holy days wine usage and jewelry should we hear of eastern christians worshiping in ways different than our own let us not be quick to judge instead let us be quick to express patience with our eastern brothers and sisters and even reach out in love and seek to understand why they choose certain actions just as paul wrote we must respect others convictions and be thankful they are trying their best to worship jesus christ you can be confident that the god who started the work of salvation in their lives will complete it if they are sensitive to the holy spirit he will guide them into all truth specifically messianic jews may worship in ways unfamiliar to us they may keep the natural feasts and holy days of israel nazarite vows and other old testament commands while believing in jesus christ remember paul took his liberties as a jewish christian keeping jewish feasts in israel when possible and keeping vows to god these actions were no longer required under the new covenant but paul knew he had liberty to express his faith through his personal convictions paul knew jesus the god who gave him the bulk of the new testament was also the god of the old testament as jews chinese muslims and hindus all come to christ by the thousands let us rejoice in their salvation and respect their liberties westerners need humility including myself let's humbly acknowledge our extreme ignorance of jewish and other eastern traditions many gospel stories cannot be understood without valuable details from jewish culture may westerners become meek and learn from the meek one christ jesus valuing god's vast beautiful diversity the rewards for receiving the revelation of the one church of jew and gentile those who receive the revelation of one church composed of jews and gentiles gain the rewards of fellowship and promises paul says all men can see the fellowship of the mystery or partnership of the mystery all christians will benefit from godly partnership no matter our race culture or skin color holy ghost-filled christians must partner together in strengthening each other this may manifest in praying for one another and helping meet each other's physical needs as the philippians met paul's needs another form of partnership is having preachers cooperate in spreading the gospel they must work together holding joint meetings in a city rather than competing against each other the body of jesus christ edifies or builds up itself in love not jealousy and competition leaders may agree to go separate directions in their ministries yet fully support one another pastors and ministers must lead the way in this partnership just as paul and peter modeled galatians 2 verses 9 and 10 reads and when james cephas and john who seem to be pillars perceive the grace that was given unto me they gave to me and barnabas the right hands of fellowship that we should go unto the heathen and they unto the circumcision only they would that we should remember the poor the same which i also was forward to do a second reward is benefiting from god's promises as paul says all spirit-filled jews and gentiles are fellow heirs and of the same body and partakers of his promise in christ by the gospel all christians are privileged with the same promises of eternal rewards as well as the earthly benefits of salvation divine healing gifts and fruits of the spirit and more god's promises give us boldness and access with confidence to heaven's only high priest jesus christ certainly the faithful prayers of both jews and gentiles can touch the heart of the invisible god through his son who feels our pains and ever lives to make intercession for us the consequences for rejecting the revelation of the one church of jew and gentile there are three possible consequences for rejecting the revelation of the one church composed of jew and gentile the sins can be labeled as prideful discrimination cursing the blessed and complacency peter pridefully discriminated against gentiles by refusing to eat with them due to peer pressure from other jews who felt gentiles were still unclean paul said peter was to be blamed which in the greek lexicon means find fault with condemn peter's sin had brought temporary fault and condemnation upon him and led by the spirit paul called it out and corrected him christians today may fall under the same prideful self-righteous spirit thinking they are more holy than other ethnic groups thus separating themselves jude 1 verse 19 warns that those who permanently separate themselves show they are carnal and sensual likely not having the baptism of the holy spirit let us physically gather more with saints as we see christ's second coming swiftly approaching cursing the blessed is a second consequence to rejecting the one church revelation just as taught in chapter 2 some gentiles may think israel is forever cursed and then condemn all jews in their angry hearts for crucifying their own messiah when a person curses others in air it reveals their own corrupt spiritual condition according to 2 timothy 2 verse 26 these corrupted ones are caught in the snare of the devil and need deliverance through repentance paul teaches complacency or lukewarmness is a major consequence of knowing god has opened the door of faith to the gentiles but not taking advantage of the opportunity romans 11 verses 18 through 22 explains how gentiles are tempted to boast against the branches or jews but gentiles must keep the fear of the lord since god's goodness has extended to us the gentiles we must continue in his goodness or else be cut off from god's blessings due to complacency the apostle john in revelation 3 verses 14 through 19 identifies the same spirit of lukewarmness falling upon the gentile churches in the last days in his letter to the laodiceans christians must constantly keep the spirit of revival in their lives hungry and thirsting for more of christ's righteousness a holy ghost-filled christian daily acknowledges his need to fully depend upon the spirit's leading and strength you desire to increase your obedience perfecting holiness in the fear of god you can't stay the same or grow complacent you must and will overcome the inward sin nature violently battling against your mind jesus died and rose again to give you this victory conclusion god's loving heart desires unity harmony and partnership between christians of all nations kindreds and tongues he sent his holy spirit into believers hearts to accomplish this divine oneness the true born-again church of jesus christ has always been and always will be one people by the holy ghost jews and gentiles are truly united in one body as one bread with a real merging of particles united by the fire of the holy spirit the one church fulfills jesus's prayer for perfect unity in john 17 verse 23 i in them and thou in me that they may be perfect in one and that the world may know that thou has sent me and has loved them as thou hast loved me action steps to joining and blessing the one church of jew and gentile number one repent and seek the baptism of the holy ghost for this is the fire of god that will make your soul one with every born-again jew and gentile on the earth being born again is the only way to join the one church number two frequent prayer should be made for believers around the world especially those facing persecution do not neglect your own spiritual body hebrews 13 3 tells you to remember them that are in bonds as bound with them and them which suffer adversity as being yourselves also in the body number three put your faith into action by financially supporting the body of christ give to poor christians in your area and be generous to missionaries who will take the gospel to future members of the one church worldwide
