chapter 17 verse one jesus is such a wonder how could he cleanse our sins and then place the holy ghost within us what a wonder what amazing thing jesus has done i'll have slides after we read the text here so uh acts 17 we'll do one through three let's look at uh prove all things again we looked at it wednesday i'd like to continue on that by god's grace i think we'd all know that as satan fights against us and battles us it actually makes us stronger right and so i found that as i go back and listen to uh the little debate we had that it's sharpening uh me it's making me uh more clear on the scriptures and the truth and it as the scripture says it dissolves all doubts so we're thankful for that that the holy spirit dissolves all doubts so acts 17 1-3 we'll just read one through three but look at verse four only some of them believe not everyone believed that paul would debate only some of them believed and so we know that all those who are predestinated to believe they will be saved the father will not lose one praise god we know that all that the father has given me will come it's our duty just to sow the seed and then any good ground that it falls upon it will bring forth praise god amen so let's read acts 17 1-3 let's read all three those together praise god i'd like to hear your voices as well let's read one through three on three one two three now when they had passed through amphipolis and apollyanna they came to thessalonica where was a synagogue of the jews and paul as his manner was went in unto them and three sabbath days reason with them out of the scriptures opening and alleging that christ must needs have suffered and risen again from the dead and that this jesus whom i preach unto you is christ look at this verse 4 and some of them believed now remember jesus had already told peter he said flesh and blood has not revealed this unto you but my father which is in heaven amen well then how did paul convince some of these people if only the father can reveal it it was the father working through paul amen so god needs someone today right to be led by the holy spirit each one you and i as we witness and uh testify to others as we witness the holy spirit will reveal it to all those who want to see it praise god all those that want to be saved may god add his blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated praise god that thought just struck me i actually didn't prepare that thought what a what a beautiful thing god using man to save man brother ram said he always does that he works in partnership with man to save man praise god so if you could switch over there we'd like to show some quotes today and some scriptures by the grace of the lord you know the message from wednesday was such a blessing you know even to my children come up and told me after service how much they enjoyed that so i thank the lord it really helped me even last night i was praying that i was saying lord your strength is perfect when i'm weak because when i'm weak then i'm strong i'm depending solely upon his power because i have none of my own amen praise god that uh that's beautiful scripture there from uh ii corinthians 12 what a blessing that is just uh uh pulsates in our hearts brother braham said that the word of god pulsates in our hearts because it is life the word of god is life amen so let's uh start there by god's grace i'm gonna put up my computer in case i need to look up any scriptures it's real handy to find that okay so we'll look at part 14 today by god's grace so i look uh here at the word of god and i just want to highlight just a few of those things remember it was paul's manner so it was paul's custom it was his habit paul's way of doing missionary work is to go into was to go into the jewish synagogues and and witness and wait for his turn to talk i remember paul was an older man he had a reputation amongst many uh people as a faithful jew but when he became a christian he became an enemy to many of the jews but yet he would go to the synagogue every saturday and in this case in thessalonica he went there three sabbaths in a row so three weeks in a row and he would reason with them out of the scriptures showing how the bible said jesus needed to suffer he needed to die for our sins that he could raise to forgive us praise god and the bible said he hadn't so he argued from the word see this needed to happen so god had to do this and so paul was doing a a scriptural debate showing by the word how these things that happens now look god god did it and then so god did jesus crucifixion and then he comes around after to show what he did praise god we're in the same today god sent a prophet right god finished the mysteries of god and here we are trying to declare of what god already did praise god but one of these days we're going to catch up praise god and the prophecy is going to catch up to us and we will be able to say amidst the latter rain that this day this scripture is fulfilled amen if that happened on the day of pentecost they said this day the scriptures fulfilled joel chapter two how about us with that other portion of joel chapter two praise god amen if jesus could recognize this day praise god uh what about this day and i was preaching that amen a few years ago at cam church i was preaching on this day the scriptures fulfilled and i was saying how this day the scriptures fulfilled how the jesus christ is getting a bride ready for the rapture and i was just showing the separation time and i said this day this scripture is fulfilled and a sister was visiting and she started speaking in tongues and we stopped the service right there were praising god and worshiping and called the prayer line come up for prayer see there's something about a church when you can catch the revelation of of what god is doing right now how many people how many want to be able to see what god's doing right now praise god and we're living in the midst of it this is the bride's revival praise god and if we recognize it as that then we'll live like that amen and then we know the day and hour that we're living in praise god now i want to look at this here uh is his habit was to go in amongst them now the reason we don't do that uh is because uh the other denominations are having church while we're having church right i've always wondered you know my mind i like to i like to maybe model this and maybe i will one day if i ever uh stop pastoring or something like that and try to try to go out and witness to others but i've always liked that idea of paul going to the churches that should have received the message of the hour and trying to argue with them to get them to receive the message of the hour i've always liked that because i know that's thus saith the lord how many believe that that is thus saith the lord this is how the first church was started remember we got to be returned back to the apostolic faith so perhaps at some point this will be our our manner of which maybe after they shut our doors right would that be something i just thought of that never thought of that but uh this was paul's manner for missionary work when there were no christian churches there were no message churches he was trying to start them praise god and after he started them of course he sent letters after he left he said the two letters to the churches in thessalonica uh establishing them in the faith praise god now that word reason uh it means there's no so when you look at the lexicon different he uh different english phrases uh are listed and it shows you know three four fives there's six different phrases this word reason takes one of them is reason so there's two scriptures that use this greek word like that and so this reason uh paul reason he uh let's look at the first definition thinks different with oneself now that wasn't what he was doing mingling thought with thought that's what he was doing paul was trying to mingle new thoughts to them praise god in church if i can do that today if the holy spirit can help me today it will help you if i can if i can help you think about god's thoughts that will bring life to you because the word is life amen and it's a thought life remember paul told the philippians one mind one accord it's a thought life so that's why we gather that's why we take out all this time on sunday to gather to hear the thoughts of god and to receive that thought of god receive that seed of god water with praise and it will bring forth of its own kind amen amen it means to ponder to revolve in your mind think about it over and over that's how many times i get sermon thoughts uh some will just it won't leave me it'll be there monday tuesday maybe to leave a couple days come back thursday or friday come again on saturday or sunday morning just come your mind comes back to these thoughts you want to revisit those thoughts now here's what paul clearly was doing he was doing some of those two he was conversing and discord discourse with one argue and discuss and you can argue right you can argue with the right heart the bible says you can be angry and sin not right so you can be angry arguing and not sinning didn't the bible say jesus looked at the pharisees and the bible said he was angry at them remember that in the scripture there was times he had uh i forget it wasn't the word angry but it was a a word where jesus was angered with the pharisees he perceived their thoughts and he had anger against them and there's times to do that right there may be times to do that now church though we like to err on the side of love right how many can say amen to that amen you wouldn't you know right away we think oh if somebody's mad then they're they got the wrong spirit well it depends jesus surely didn't have the right spirit i'm sorry jesus surely had the right spirit right when he was angry when he had the cords and he went through the temple and beat out the money changers did he have the right spirit yes he did it didn't seem like it to others but he did he had the right spirit and so we got to take that same attitude now as i was studying this morning i remembered brother branham preached a whole sermon on his debate with the preacher about tongues as in of initial evidence so people that say oh brother ram didn't believe in debates well they just don't they just forgot maybe brother brahm had numerous debates uh and so this one he tells while he's in washington he's telling about the debate this is not the debate uh i don't i don't have it on uh recording as far as i know so brother ram said so in the debate the gracious brother him being the visitor so he must have visited branham tabernacle i said now i'm willing to discuss this with you if you'll stay strictly with the scripture and don't leave the scripture and i said then at the end of the discussion that you can shake my hand and will still feel brothers one to another so these are the debates we like and the church said amen but there could be a debate where you could get angry and you still have the holy spirit because jesus did he said because if i you don't i wouldn't do it because i said because perhaps when it's over you're going to feel the same way you do and i will too so brother knew this brother amen most people are not going to be changed through a debate but he said he still wanted to stand up for the truth about the word of god that tongues is not the evidence tongue is evidence of the holy spirit anointing you to speak but it's not evidence that the person's born again and he knew at the end of the day most people are not going to be swayed but some will believe praise god amen some will believe amen now the next and the very next thing now look at this isn't this interesting he had a debate and he had moderators so and we had a debate this week didn't we was that this week the presidential debate seems like a year ago but all the busyness that happens this week and they had a moderator right i thought he did an awful job i watched a little bit that's my opinion because it was like trump was debating two people but being we got moderators here that sworn businessmen because that's what i went through too i felt like i was debating two people i was but being we got moderators here that sworn businessmen you know and so forth that they're they're just they're not interested in either side no that's not the case with all moderators they're just taking down what's facts so their moderators that brother debate would just write down the scriptural facts about what they were saying he said no matter what their decision is it is just five or six men just form certain scripture way the scripture is given who takes it who really throw the light on it that's the one that tells you see so brother ram had moderators afterwards who would say who won or lost the debate and he said he won the debate [Laughter] see did you know that did you know that random debates and people said they judged him whether he won or lost see most people don't think about that because maybe we haven't heard it but he did i'll show it to you now here while he's talking about the debate on tongues he actually goes to a different debate he had he at least had three debates i found and then brother bosworth were the pillar of fire that's at least four debates he was there at that debate okay now that answers like dr hegery up there that time you know the lutheran dean you know i told him you remember the debate that we had so brother graham had a debate with a lutheran doctorate praise god you remember the debate we had you know there on he was telling me about the witch woman you know that prayed for the sick and got healed and said god couldn't heal you've heard the story so brother man had at least these two debates one is tongues the evidence of the holy ghost and the second one uh divine healing is it real or not and then of course the question came up uh can demons heal the brotherhood tells us no he said but people if they approach that woman with the attitude of real faith mother said they can get healed now that's quite a subject that's a whole other message but brother ram does say that he he says that could happen he said he was telling me about the witch woman you know prayed for the sick that god healed and god and said god couldn't heal you've heard the story see you mean that i said sure so see brother branham had other debates was that new to anybody anybody was that new to then yeah good good so brother ram had numerous debates so here's where he says he won so then but this fellow lost the debate you know of course there's a lot more but you see what i'm talking about there see come right back to the beginning right back to the beginning so my man was saying that he won the debate he had moderators that judge and the moderators would look at the scriptures and say well we think by the brandon one and so brother branham had his opinion and then the moderators had opinions about who won or lost the debate right and so do i i'm sure people on the other side to believe this the sign side i'm sure they say rod won but i disagree i think i won by the word of god not that it matters but it matters about what who thinks or about god who thinks or got who you think or god forgive me it matters about what god thinks who won i can't say it forgive me i guess all chopped up in my words this morning forgive me it only matters about who's who god thinks won that's mine that's what i was trying to say it only matters about god god god determines who the winner is praise god and our word will win every time praise god amen in fact i i texted the brother who hosts the debate he was my moderator but he didn't inject any of his thoughts and i said who do you think won he thought he thought he said he said for sure this message has all the questions i'm sorry all the answers to the question he said this message won i said praise the lord that's exactly what i felt i felt better coming out of there and i had brother john graham called me up this week and he said i enjoyed the debate he said will you debate him again i said absolutely because i know this word right got it god loves battle praise god god is a he's mighty in battle hallelujah amen he don't back down brother said i remember they challenged billy graham one time and the muslim said well we'll bring sick people before us and you and we'll see who healed him and billy graham just left him away and brother bam said well he said i appreciate that he said but he said uh if i was billy graham i think i would have said if i didn't have the faith to do it i would call somebody who had the faith to do it because god is a god of showdowns praise god god is a god of battles amen he's a mighty conqueror he's a man of war the bible says praise god amen and yes it's a war of words but did brother random engage in wars of words yes he did amen he had at least those debates right there all right okay so those are the quotes i just had a few new quotes on debates i wasn't sure if you were aware of those or not uh i didn't read the one there's one i read when i preached it a few wednesdays ago brother man brother brahma had the debate remember against 300 ministers about the water baptism and the serpent seed how many remember that he said i wasn't going to go up billy said don't go up he said but the angel lord said go on up he said they're going to have these questions for they're going to try to trap you in your doctrine and the angel said do not fear i'm with you and the man said whenever he says that i don't fear anymore i know god is with me praise god amen and so he had at least those three debates and then he attended the debate on uh at the houston coliseum there in 1950. okay now that was uh just getting through our first i'm sorry no we're still finishing rod's second question uh the weight of doubt is overwhelming on brother branson's ministry what do we do with deuteronomy 18 20 to 22. so on wednesday we looked at some of those uh visions brother branham had and i hope it's making sense to you church that that with each vision you have to see is this conditional or is this unconditional you have to look at it that way like my wife shared that scripture from jonah if you just read jonah three it doesn't look like there's any condition to it let's read it jonah 3 4. let's read it it was just such a fresh thought so i appreciate my wife sharing that many times i'll have that my wife will share a scripture with me right before i preach and it's a help jonah 3 4. jonah 3 4. daniel hosea joel and amos obadiah jonah micah nahum so yeah look at the word of god here do we does the word of god record any conditions no it doesn't so look at verse uh uh verse 1 and the word lord came unto jonah the second time saying arise go into nineveh that great city and preach unto it the preaching that i bidding let me just stop right there how many know sometimes when you disobey god's word he'll bring the same thing around and say you need to do it now all god did was repeat the same thing you already said and sometimes you wonder why does sermons go service after service oh we already heard that well maybe god's waiting for some of us to obey it i know that's true you know with people that have left and where god has tried to warn them ahead of time and they just don't want it so they leave that's fine they can do whatever they want but i'm just saying if someone doesn't obey it god is merciful he'll give them another chance to obey it amen because god is merciful hallelujah if you would have been joining wouldn't you appreciate god's mercy he just got spit out of a whale's belly right arise go to that great city and preach unto it the preaching that i bid thee so he didn't want to preach it he didn't want to preach it so he rebelled against it and so god had to take him through a harsh trial he said i had to be taken down to the depths of hell jonah said so sometimes church our lives will seem like awful right sometimes our lives will seem awful because we haven't obeyed praise god but if we obey then god will raise us up amen amen to raise us up out of that situation to show us he's rich in mercy praise god and then he'll say do it again i'm going to tell you again do it i'm going to tell you the second time please do what i asked you to do already oh verse 3 and jonah arose and went under nineveh according to the word of the lord now nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days journey and jonah began to enter in the city a day's journey and he cried and said yet forty days and nineveh shall be overthrown period do you see any conditions in there does anybody see any ifs in there i don't see any now of course we know this there may have been more recorded right i'm sorry there may have been more spoken uh when jonah literally preached this but as far as this scripture it looks like thus saith the lord i'm destroying it in 40 40 days but keep reading your bible what happens now all the people could have said thus saith the lord we're going to die in 40 days thus saith the lord and if they just said what that said they would have thought there was no conditions for it and so see church with every vision of brother branham we've got to look at it and say is this conditional or is this unconditional but see believe the sign don't do that they look at one and oh if it's failed or if apparently brother didn't obey it well then he's not a prophet well jonah didn't obey this first one and he was still a prophet right now look at verse five and so the people of nineveh believed god and proclaimed a fast and put on sackcloth from the greatest of them even to the least them and we know in chapter four uh jonas mad because god didn't destroy it and god has to plead with jonah you need to have mercy in church that's our that's our story right we don't want to be prideful message believers we want to be message believers that have mercy on people and compassion i feel for the catholics don't you i feel i've been to there you know last year i went to a funeral it's awful i feel for those people uh it hurts my heart to know that people are in those type of systems it makes me sad it it makes me pray for them what was i saying yesterday i saw something i just almost broke down and cried i was so sorry that these people were in such a condition at a church oh yeah it was that one i almost started crying i was watching where uh they marry people at branham tabernacle they have a living minister and then they say okay now after they get the you know the husband or i'm sorry the wife up there they step the minister steps off and say now we're gonna let our pastor william branham marry them and church i about started crying i was there in my car i just i just was leaving aldi and i was gonna plug it in and listen to it i i thought my can you imagine and the brother had a good point that was exposing this can you imagine if we went to a methodist church today and a preacher got up there and said okay we're gonna have a wedding and okay now we're gonna our pastor john wesley preached and he sat down and and pretend they're pretending and thinking that john wesley is actually there preaching and i've seen brother branham's sons do that i've seen both of his sons do that on tape they'll say okay now i'm gonna step aside i'm gonna let our pastor our daddy preach the gospel my church my heart hurt i thought how can someone that loves jesus be under that delusion see there's something underneath that right it's some type of pride or there's something hiding under there that's really awful now the brother said it might be necromancy which is playing with spirits the dead interceding with the dead it may be right but this one thing i know paul never said uh paul never said uh you know anything like that paul told timothy he said preach the word praise god amen he didn't say imagine a dead man there he said you preach the word amen church that's the delusion people are under in this day around our message and so we need to have compassion how many want to have compassion on them god be merciful bring them out of this how can they picture that and there's quotes my man said i won't always be your pastor that was in future home 64. the man said i won't always be your pastor all right so let me move on we ought to be thankful for what god has given us praise god we have a how many are thankful for the word of god being rightly divided to us amen i'm so thankful for that we have to pretend things or imagine things and we can church everything we can do by god's grace we can point right to the bible and say that's what they did in the bible now brother rod gave some additional points after he wouldn't condemn bruce jenner for cross-dressing i don't condemn his soul but i condemn that action as a sin it's an abomination and i said that clearly i don't condemn his soul but it's a sin it's an abomination and though so he said uh rod never backed up brother branham like he did moses striking the rock and this is one of those times where i didn't have anything planned and the holy spirit gave me what to say he said brother ram never had see if he was a real prophet god would have backed him up anyway well now there's another thought on that god didn't always back up what the prophets did god didn't bring to pass everything that every prophet ever said right not every single there was times he did it but not every single time and so as i was sitting there the holy spirit brought this quote to me brother branham said i was in balaam's shoes i've never heard that quote before let me see if i can find it real quick here oh there's my little guy there so let me just type in to prove it to you here in balaam's shoes i didn't have a chance to look this up okay so let's look at this here this is from 1947. let's let me read this quote to you here oh it's quite a quote how it must have been so good to me to let me get by with such as that when even i wouldn't make any believe it or not just bring them on you see because i knew the strength and the power of god let me pause right there so brother i'm saying it early in his ministry he got so zealous and he was so impressed by the miracles he said bring me the hardest cases first to try to raise people's faith and brother brahm said that was wrong he should not have done that so that's what he's saying here now that just the very fact he could do that proves he's a prophet of god right and how did god let me get but i said god let me get by with that i do not know because jesus christ there was many mighty works he could not do is that scripture because of their unbelief and look what he was look at the power was in him and then merely with the gift of healing challenged anything belief or unbelief come on up and he let me look at this for six months get by with that so six months he he disobeyed what the angel lord told him to do right that began to break my heart when i seen that what i had done and i tried to hold up before you people and preach i couldn't do it it just melted me right on down and i come to the pulp and i seen then that i was preaching and telling how bad balaam was and i was standing in balaam's shoes i was doing the things the angel lord met me up there and said don't do it now church that's a humble man right there because balaam was lost and went to hell but brother adam will see church brother i'm saying even a prophet sometimes i can he can disobey the word of the lord and he could he could be acting like a disobedient prophet but yet he's still a true prophet what did balaam do god said don't go up to barrack so balaam went against it and he said can i go again he said can i go oh fine go ahead and go right so balaam disobeyed the first word the angel of the lord gave brother man the first word don't do that don't bring the hardest cases first brother brandon did it anyway and yet god still blessed him how many remember when baal went up to barrack did god meet with him in the tent or not yes or no do you say it out loud did god meet with balaam in the tent yeah he was disobedient he disobeyed the first word he went to barack and when he got to barrack he said bert build seven altars uh kill seven bullocks seven birth sacrifices and i'll go talk to god tonight did god talk to him yeah yeah he did so this idea that uh brother branham oh god never backed up brother branham even when he was disobedient like moses when moses smote the rock yes god did not in everything but in some things now it's probably a quote you haven't heard too many times preaching the message right but it's in the it's in the message right it's amongst his so to me that's humility that's a man that i can appreciate because sometimes like paul sometimes well johnny i do things that i hate and i wish i would not have done it sometimes i can say but amen oh wretched man that i am but thanks be to god who gives me the victory through jesus christ my lord amen that's a man that i can respect right there an honest man and yet god did those great miracles all right let me pull back up the keynote here sorry i didn't plan to show that but i just thought it might help you okay there we go so see that's wrong god did back him up in some cases and then the holy spirit brought that to my remember it says john 14 26 said i not plan to say it but i loved it i was all nervous for a little while but then all the nervous went away i just waited for the holy spirit church that's what that's all i enjoy doing don't you two just wait on the presence of the lord amen just wait on him he'll show up praise god hallelujah now let's go to the next okay so the second question now my second question was about the baptism of the holy ghost i said since you believe someone gets the holy ghost at the moment of salvation do you negate that means to do away with so do you do do you do away with the examples from the acts or the book of acts of receiving the holy ghost after you believe so i said what do you do with all those examples and i even used jesus apostles they believed in jesus they found him for three and a half years but they weren't born again to the day of pentecost right so that was one example i used now let me pull up i got to open up something real quick i forgot i wanted to share this okay so next so here were his reasonings and i think they're wrong of course there we go so our brother believes that there's only two kinds of believers saved and lost well brother branham said there's three kinds when he preached it and then the church's book he says there's four kinds right so there i believe there's four because it fits the four kinds of grounds there's four kinds of conditions uh holy righteous unholy unrighteous you know there's and revelation 22 4 is the earthly number and brother ram grew in revelation so he said there's only two kinds he says the disciples now this is interesting he said disciples weren't converted until acts 2 4 and i agreed with that because jesus said that he told peter he said wait he said when you're converted strengthen your brethren in other words go up to pentecost wait there get all emptied out until heaven comes down to fill you up praise god amen that's what he said wait till you're converted praise god i believe with that but he's he's confused now go to romans 8 9. he says romans 8 9 says you cannot be a christian without the spirit now i i agree with that but not his interpretation of it romans 8 9. romans 8 9. now remember i told you last week this is the holy ghost chapter it starts off with the holy ghost ends with the love of god who can separate me from the holy ghost the love of god hallelujah height nor death nor anything can separate me from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord verse 9 but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of god dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of christ he's none of his now there's a couple way you can ways you can apply this when you have justification you have the holy spirit in your mind but you don't have it in your soul right and is it is a justified person truly god's child yes yes how about sanctification if you've got the holy spirit in your mind and you're in the process of being sanctified are you god's child yes you are but he you know he's saying this scripture means as soon as you're justified you're filled with the holy spirit we know that's not the case it's not the case because if you have the first two works of grace you still have the holy spirit in your mind now the mystery part of that because the holy ghost is a mystery right the mystery part of that you can be like judas you can be justified and sanctified but then deny it and trample foot the son of god and your name gets blotted off the book of life that's the great mystery of it right by manchester you can you can climb up that pyramid and then fall off the bible says the holy spirit you were sanctified with you counted a unholy thing the bible says that let's read it uh hebrews 10 just to prove it to you the bible says you can be sanctified by the holy spirit but then trample under it in other words you can make it all the way to jordan but if you don't cross over you're not in the promised land amen hebrews 10. verse 29 hebrews 10 29 clearly says it's a clear bible teaching of how much sore punishment suppose ye shall he be thought worthy you had trodden underfoot the son of god and hath counted the blood of the covenant wherewith he was sanctified here's a man that was sanctified by the holy spirit i mean separated right the word actually means separated and cleaned so a man can be cleaned right but then he can go back and get dirty but see when you're born again it seals that dirt out praise god of your soul amen and have done despite the spirit of grace so god's grace leads you into justification sanctification but if you don't follow on into the baptism of the holy ghost and you trample it down then the bible said there's punishment for that and jesus said if you don't overcome and return your first love i'll blot out your name off the book of life it's a great mystery but i'll say this i'm glad to know the mystery amen i'm glad to know the mystery and church and in many cases i don't know you and i don't know many times if people are saved or not remember the member of the preacher brother ramsey brother man talked about he got to a spot where he wouldn't serve god anymore and he was working in a car shop and he told the black brother he said go buy me some alcohol and he said god forbid i'd buy a servant alcohol but the ramp said he died god took him off the scene because he died he stopped preaching all these things but brother man said he was saved now i don't understand that the brotherhood said he was saved somehow brother bam saw it or something he preached and all these things but then he backslid and went away and i and brother man said he must have gotten saved somehow at the end now that would line up with first corinthians six right or yeah first corinthians six if a brother's backslidden uh get the leaven out of the church that his soul uh deliver him to satan that his soul might be saved it's a great topic it's a great subject but it's the word of god amen and then the brother said he told me he said the works of grace terminology is not in the bible well i disagree with that it's right in the bible the holy spirit he said the holy spirit is received just by believing i disagree with that as far as in the soul now here's what's striking and people have told me this before in fact the first year i was a teacher at copley i was working the summer painting i paint the classrooms and i worked with a science teacher from the middle school who since retired and we got into that debate it was it was fun it was one of the best debates i ever had paint in and just listen to we could listen to jesus music you know we're debating while we're painting and i said well yeah i said did you ever read the book of acts uh they believed and then they got the holy ghost and he said he said you can't use stories for doctrine i said well then why was it written then wasn't it a true story didn't the bible say they believed in samaria but then they hadn't received the holy ghost so he said call peter and john that's the example i used i said call those brothers who got the holy ghost lay hands on them and they'll get the holy ghost praise god is that a true story is that a fairy tale church that's a true story but he's saying you can't use the book of acts and then and then they say it's a history book you can't use history for doctrine you can't use history to prove current teaching history validates current teaching praise god and so the brother says the same things oh they're just stories and they can't be used for doctrine i'll tell that but i'll say it like this church every bible story can be used for doctrine the bible says that remember the holy scriptures paul told timothy the scriptures are profitable for doctrine right for instruction for training in righteousness that the man may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto every good work hallelujah thank you jesus and then he said as soon as you believe the spirit flows out of you well that's not true you got to wait to your seal with the holy ghost then the spirit then the water flows out of you all right so let me look at a few of these so here's my reply i probably already said a lot of my reply but let me just go through it here quickly what was this my second question or was this oh yeah uh his second question um i said it's a mystery uh yeah i don't know i'm not sure if i got it i'm not sure if i have my notes on that anyways i'll just go off it in mark 16 i'm going to read this in mark 16 the bible said god works with us mark 16. god needs someone to say or he needs someone to help him right because he can't force people so he uses man to save man you don't have to do it but he does it to give us something to do praise god he gives us a job to do he gives us talents praise god mark 16 19 and then after that the lord had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and sat on the right hand of god and they went forth and preached everywhere the lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following so the holy god works with you how many glad god works with you amen you can talk for god praise god you can work for god you can do something for god amen because god is working with you all right uh and then there's that scripture where paul said uh the work i do the works of god uh mo i labor more abundantly but not me but the grace with me let me look at the grace of god with me labor okay yeah it's first corinthians 15 10 but by the grace of god i am what i am and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain but i labored more abundantly he worked more abundantly than they all than peter and james and john paul labored more than all them yet not i but the grace of god which was with me praise god amen so what was laboring with him grace was laboring that's why brotherhood said five is labor and grace amen grace labors when you have grace and receive god's favor it makes you want to labor it makes you want to work to show your appreciation to god hallelujah hebrews 4 verse 9 this whole chapter is about entering into the baptism of the holy ghost hebrews chapters 2 and 3 talks about israel trying to get to the promised land which finishes it and shows that the holy ghost is the promised land for the believer today verse nine there remained therefore a rest to the people of god this is what i tell those sabbatarians all the time they already had the sabbath day but the bible said they need a rest no i mean they'll argue well they'll email till they're blue in the face because i've eaten with them till i'm about blue in the face say we you need to rest i said i said i've got i've got a two-fold rest on sunday right uh i rest for my labors right i don't work my regular job my teaching job i rest that way and plus i don't work at my house i don't move the grass i don't uh so i'm so i'm resting my body but actually i'm preaching so i'm really not resting my body but you guys get to rest your body now unless you're sweating like me and you know you're saying amen so loud you're sweating like me but you don't have to but i guess that's true when i'm not preaching i guess that's true praise god and i get to sit listen to somebody else preach but in some sundays i don't work my body and i don't work the job and so i fulfill i have a sabbath day sunday's my sabbath day right but like paul said paul said the priests transgressed the sabbath because they worked on the sabbath they had to offer sacrifices and do the altar of incense and they work but jesus said it's okay because they're certain they're serving god's purpose and so even though i work i'm still serving god's purpose i'm not breaking the word amen oh hallelujah praise god hope that makes sense but see how can they say that that the saturdays the rest when the bible said there still was a rest remaining for he that has entered into his rest verse 10 has also ceased from his own works as god did from his let us picnic is that the right word lydia does that say picnic let us vacation therefore to enter into that rest the word church labor huh we're supposed to labor to enter into the baptism of the holy ghost i remember when i preached edin uh which sister was that sister walker emailed me afterwards and said i needed to hear that because we we have to we have to make our flesh submit to the holy spirit it's hard it's a labor sometimes right like you've got to really work at it right there's certain things i've got to i've got to work at it not to give into that sin you've got to work at it right because you've got to bring this body into subjection so the bible says let us labor not vacation to enter into that rest just like a woman giving forth a baby labor labor to bring the rest right lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief so see those that don't believe don't labor but if you believe you labor praise god in other words you work with grace you let grace work in your life i believe it with all my heart i believe this message with all my heart that's beautiful praise god for the word of god so what is the rest the word of god the word of god is quick powerful sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even the dividing asunder of the soul and the spirit and of the joints and of the marrow i love that see the word of god helps your soul helps your mind helps your body praise god amen god's word heals your body it transforms your mind and it fills your soul amen this is beautiful man it's just it's perfect for the three parts of a human soul body spirit and and rod doesn't believe in that either brother johnny told me he said i don't believe in that soul body spirit i thought boy that's why you can't get the revelation of it you can't get the revelation of it you'll miss it that's why they can't see the baptist holy ghost because they can't see that man has three parts and then they can't see god's one person father son holy ghost yet one person we are body soul spirit yet one person same thing right that's one of the questions coming up so maybe we'll get to that this morning running out of time here ah what a beautiful scripture and as a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart so brother man had that gift so he laying in here is the messiah sign right the discernment of spirit brother man could judge people's thoughts because that's what discerning is judging it's judging the thoughts and intents of their heart i like verse 13 neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight but all things are naked and open unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do so god sees he's the word he sees right through everything any little charade people can put on a little act any little pretending on any little guile god sees through all that and church the word will see through it too when you give some the word test we'll look at that tonight that brother said that's how you know the bride give the people the word test he said after the word i'm kind of getting to my sermon tonight so sometimes i can't just i can't avoid that it all kind of flows together man said he said the miracles come after the word amen but the word comes first in other words the true interpretation of god's word comes first and then god sends the miracle amen you know the example program gives elijah with the shulamite woman who's gonna die and he said give me he said go make me the cake first amen go believe go act on the word first act on the true word first get your doctrine right and then the miracles will come later praise god i'm going to preach that tonight again so you got to bear with me again tonight i'll reason quote but that's how you know with the showdown when the showdown comes between jesus and denomination but man said that's how you know he said give him the word test if you want to listen that's the spoken words original seed i just listened to the last uh hour last night beautiful ah we'll go over tonight a little bit by god's grace that's where the the lord said pick up your pen and write so see church it's always the word first that's why with rod i he and he even says this on the debate brother man he has miracles he said i still see miracles in my life so he had miracles while he was a oneness he was raised in the oneness church he had merit he saw miracles and then he came to message for 40 years he said he saw miracles there and now he's out of the message he sees miracles there so it's not the miracles first it's the word first amen let's put god's word first let's put the revelation first praise god and then the miracles will come but see if if they cry out long enough god's going to send rain no matter what sea you are because the rain falls on the just and the unjust the rain just quickens what seed is inside i hope you're enjoying this today church i'll share them i love it oh my iron sharpens iron praise god amen and we just get sharper and sharper who can see right down what is the truth on that that's the word praise god so what labored in paul's life grace grace does work oh and i brought out too i brought out that mark 14 where jesus said the kingdom of heaven is like a wheat plant and it grows up uh uh the something and then the stalk and then the corn and the kingdom of god is within you so the kingdom of god is the baptism of the holy ghost it grows in three stages in your life but i'm saying with the statue of men you grow into the next phase you grow up into it praise god thank you lord now let me let's read that one foolish virgin are blessed even they're justified but they're still blessed they're still god's children they're not as bright but they're still god's children go to matthew 25 34 was the thief on the cross still god's child yes yes did he live the life peter lived and john no he only was a believer for the last few hours or minutes of his life but he was still saved he didn't live close to the life they lived but he's still a child of god matthew 25. 34 25 34 then shall the king say unto them on the right hand come ye blessed of my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world so they have a certain portion in the new jerusalem not in the city but it must be outside this city they have some portion in jesus's kingdom his rulership his domain right and when was it prepared before the foundation of the world and this is the group that didn't even know they were doing good to jesus brothers they're shocked they're surprised on the day of judgment when did we ever visit you when did we clothe you when did we feed you he said when you did it to the least of those message believers you did it unto me praise god that's right so we can see that plainly by the grace of god amen now go to acts uh acts eight i read a quote yesterday where bam said uh imperfect faith he said now brother man he said i'm just hitting the highlights he said you dig down deeper in these things and bring out more of it that's what we're supposed to do we're not supposed to stop at revelation 10 7 malachi 4 5 and 6. we're that's great that's where you start but then you dig down and find the rest of it praise god there's more of it that we can bring out and it teaches the same revelation just more of it acts 8 verse 12 but when they had believed philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of god and the name of jesus christ they were baptized both men and women then simon himself believed also when he was baptized he continued with philip and wondered but holding the miracles and the signs which they had done go to verse 16 for as yet he was fallen upon none of them only they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus then laid their hands on them and they received the holy ghost now you know simon i said this on wednesday simon wanted to give the holy ghost to people but look at verse 12. he wants to buy i'm sorry verse 20. he wants to buy it with money but peter said to him thy money perish with thee now he just got baptized and peter's like your money's gonna perish with you he just got saved wouldn't you be happy but peter recognizes his heart isn't cleaned out right he's not sanctified at all he just got baptized because that was thought that the gift of god may be purchased with money so your thoughts can cause you to be per can cause you to perish see people's thoughts about god and the holy ghost look at that the baptism holy ghost can cause them to perish now of course this is coveting as well right he's covered something that wasn't given to him and he thinks he can buy a spiritual gift with money so how far did he get on the statute perfect man not very far he might have got the faith he might have got the virtue if he hung around there for a little while you know i'm one of them believers praise god i wanna but when it come down he surely didn't get the knowledge because he didn't have knowledge to know that you know god has to give you that ability to pray for people to get the holy ghost that has to be a gift of god verse 21 thou s neither part nor lot in this matter for thy heart is not right in the sight of god repent now what church this is the same this is the same this is the same man that said acts 2 38 repent and be baptized right are you that just struck me are you with me he just said repent and be baptized they got baptized he said can i buy the holy ghost he said repent go back to where you started you never did repent all the way isn't that striking see how many people among us brother johnny have we've seen over the years amen people get baptized and they never repented to begin with and so they'll say things that are just oh how could you say that about brother branham or how could you how do you say it about jesus and then the the thing to do is go back you never repented to begin with again we don't know how far he got until he had to go back and repent he might have got faith anybody got some virtue but then satan stole it away somehow we don't know but he says repent and he just told him acts 2 38. now that's not in the story but we know that's how that's what he's on the day of pentecost repent therefore this thy wickedness and pray god so you want to repent you got to pray if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven me for i perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity he was a slave to iniquity so he knew better iniquity is when you know better right so he knew better he just got saved baptized following the believers but then when he saw people get the holy ghost he's so coveted after that it was an evil thing it was bitterness in his heart now think about that bitter towards peter and john because they have a gift i don't have doesn't that come around us sometimes in the message yeah i've had people tell me i wish i was a preacher and they were women i've had a woman tell me she wished she was a preacher because then she could preach and bawl people out in the message yes i know i had people tell me that well how do you get there you don't start there if you really if you really repent you don't start there you get iniquity got to get the evil spirit on you and that takes you in the bond takes you in bondage to iniquity you know it's wrong but you do it anyway because you worship that spirit now look i like verse 24. then answer simon said pray ye to the lord for me now that's actually i don't know if i like that scripture or not that as far as his attitude that none of these things which you have spoken come upon me oh yeah that's good scripture but the reality of it is the man needed to pray himself yeah we appreciate other people praying for us but really when it comes down to repentance we're the ones who got to repent right mom can't repent for me preacher can't repent for me you've got to repent for you now you don't you don't need to go to acts 10 but an accident cornelius was praying fasting and giving alms before he was born again i had a person know me last week and said why can't i get the holy ghost i said are you praying fast and giving alms he said no i said go read acts chapter 10. you want the holy ghost do what the bible says do what jesus says because the cornelius was praying fast and giving alms seeing angels and yet wasn't born again well they're out of us people live in laodicea they want to live like the world and try to get the blessings of god you've got to deny the world the world must be crucified unto you and you to the world praise god amen i've given up multiple meals just for this service this morning and not to brag on me but just let you know if i've got to do that just to get spiritual minded what about the rest of us praise god people think as soon as they believe the message they're born again that's a bunch of nonsense they've got to walk the road they've got to walk through the red sea they've got to walk through the wilderness they've got a crossover praise god amen with no fear about what's going to happen once you're born again see they get scared what's mom going to say what's the family going to say i don't know if i can leave the church well then go back to egypt because we're going to canaan's land amen come and go with me to my father's house praise god and go back you don't want to go then go back that's really my house we'll possess the promised land joshua said that amen we'll possess it i wonder how many times i've repeated that let's go back to that thought earlier god will repeat something jonah how many times have i preached praying fast come to church early and pray or stay stay after church and pray longer and how many times have i repeated that perhaps that's maybe the holy spirit trying to get us to obey it because it's thus saith the bible right thus saith the bible god gives the holy ghost to them that obey him that's the state of the bible i want to be a faithful bible preacher praise god let me look at the next thought here yeah and i preached this i think uh maybe naomi and beatrice might remember i preached this on a wednesday night a few wednesday nights ago it's really this is a fresh revelation to me i've never realized the evil of telling people you are born again as soon as you just believe i've never realized it but now it's starting to become one of the biggest sins i can think of i don't know if it's pride or i don't know what it is i'm just trying to replace it as far as sins can you imagine amen telling somebody they just repented their sins can we can we imagine telling them you are all you did was say a sinner sinner's prayer repeat after me jesus i love you i believe in you come in my heart amen oh now you are sealed you're filled you're circumcised your clothes and this is what rod and the group do nothing against him but i'm just saying this is my debate right you're born you're quickened you're baptized and all the rest well my wife and i can tell you we were in college campuses we saw many people that went said the sinner's prayer and they weren't nothing of this the only thing that was born in them was a greater desire to watch movies and smoke and drink and live like the world nothing was really born to them so what evil what sin is that where they tell people you're filled god's spirit is flowing out of you and you just said a sinner's prayer what evil is that i'll tell you what it is one thing it's a form of godliness but denying the power thereof there it is there it is it's the white and suffolker jesus said you are white and beautiful supplicers you're a beautiful cave where dead bodies go or a beautiful gravestone whatever that application is you're beautiful on the outside but inside you are full of corruption what spirit what evil spirit would tell people god's life is flowing out of you and you are sealed and the world is circumcised unto you and yet they'll go enjoy all every pleasure of the world that's the evil spirit church that's an evil spirit giving them a form of godliness and denying the power the blood of jesus christ denying the power thereof the lord willing the holy spirit will give me more insight on that i need to make that a major doctrine is it because the holy ghost how many know the holy ghost baptism is a major doctrine well this is the evil of it this is the evil that goes against the true teaching is that you already got all these things you imagine telling israel you just you're walking out of egypt you know with the they got they got uh earrings on you're already in canaan's land what kind of wickedness would that be you're just possessed your land you're already there go ahead and possess it right now and yet egypt is like a few feet away that's what they're doing they haven't really crossed through the waters where all the task masters die when my cussing died and i never cussed again and my cigarette smoke and died all the task masters are dead praise god they never even pastored that and yet they're telling you you are in the promised land you are a possessor of all these promises maybe potentially but not literally i'm really grateful for the message of the hour oh i think i am because two years ago bible club we had a brother come in nice brother but he believes us and he told five-year-olds we had kindergarteners there first second third fourth so we had five grade levels there and he said he said if you he said how many believe and the all the kids raised their hand because they did yeah they raised their hand while they're like playing with suckers and you know and he said jesus said the works that i do you'll do also and greater these greater works than these shall you do and he said children don't you know you might walk into hospitals and bring out every sick person out of the hospitals because you're already filled with the holy spirit and you can do greater works than jesus i'm i'm literally sitting there like oh god i feel pain in my heart like this is so wrong it's so wrong and so when i i always close it because i'm the leader that i just go up there and i say jesus uh forgive us we love you help us to you know be kind help us to grow in knowledge of your word like what can i say and there's parents all standing in the back but you know he was in and out i was there every week so i think they got the idea so i taught him i taught him the three works of grace later so they knew i don't care what he says i know what the bible says but what evil is that to tell someone you have all the blessing you're in canaan's land and they're just a few feet away from their egyptian lifestyle that's wickedness that's a lie let me see what okay let me close with this one here i'm a little over an hour let me close with this one here you enjoying this praise the lord me too i really am i i just love this message i love how it defeats every foe praise god now so he gave one last additional point he criticized the idea that receiving the word for your day is receiving the holy ghost baptism he criticized that because remember he says you can't use acts because those are stories now can't use jonah now it's just a story you can't use that no you can use it so let's read these this proves beyond a shadow of a doubt you have to believe all the word for your day if you want to be born again not if you want to be saved if you want to be born again okay let's go to acts 18 24 please acts 18 24. this proves it beyond all shadow doubt brother ram said these were shouting baptist brother amen apollos was preaching and the bible said he was mighty mightily convincing them that jesus was the christ can you imagine a mighty teacher he's just proven he said look at this i imagine he was using psalm 16 and isaiah 53. look at this and he was mildly teaching them eloquently he never stuttered like i do i stutter all morning right you just saw me stutter and everybody laughs at me and i laughed too so i deserved to be laughed at but uh this man never stuttered he was so eloquent he could write he could rightly divide it and point to everything and lay it all out and people were excited and happy to come under sanctification the ephesians were acts 18 24 and a certain jew named apollos born at alexandria an eloquent man boy i wish i got that gift but i don't sorry i guess you all lose out and mighty in the scriptures came to ephesus but that's one thing i do desire i do desire to be mighty in the scriptures this man was instructed in the way of the lord and being fervent in the spirit so he was real zealous i want to do that too so i can get some of these but i surely can't get the eloquent one ah now that's my desire now being fervor in the spirit he spake and taught diligently the things of the lord knowing only the baptism of john he didn't know the full word of his hour and he began to speak boldly in the synagogue look at that bold he going a bunch of those jews i'm sanctified i'm justified he'd preach jesus boldly that's why we've seen a lot of message preachers fall away they were bold but they never got born again right you can be bold you can be eloquent my we got eloquent preachers thank god for them thank god for apollos but the idea is don't stop with sanctification go all the way in cross over jordan let the word go before you drive out all the enemies of your life praise god and possess the promises god gave for you i'm going to say amen to that amen glory hallelujah that's what we need he began to speak boldly verse 26 in the synagogue whom when aquila and priscilla had heard they took on the hit on him unto them rather and expounded unto him the way of god more perfectly now see women preachers will use this one and say well see uh priscilla was a preacher too she instructed apollos no i don't think that's what it means if that's what it means then that contradicts what paul said in 1st corinthians 14 and 1st timothy 2. so she might have testified and she could testify and say now listen apollos i was i was sanctified too but once aquila and i heard the message of paul and a peter we got the holy ghost it's real there's more than just that bold and there's more than that there's an in living the spirit of jesus christ is living in me and through her testimony she can instruct how many believe that it's just like john chapter 4 with the woman at the well right she went in the scene and said come and see a man that told me everything i ever did is not this the messiah it's a testimony praise god thank the lord hallelujah so no pursuit didn't preach him a sermon can you imagine we're still saying aquila can you sit down hubby i'm gonna preach now i don't think i can imagine that that's what would have had to happen verse 27 and when he was disposed to pass into a chao the brethren wrote exhorting the disciples to receive him who when he was come help them much which had believed through grace for he mightily convinced the jews and that publicly now look he's a public debater look at that that's why i like that guy ray comfort he gets on that have you ever seen him he gets on that uh soapbox uh over there in california every saturday and he video records it and he debates all these atheists up and down i love it i've always told my wife if the lord tarries and i don't think california is going to fall in the ocean i'm going to go out there and get training on that i would love i'm starting to get into debating i think that's a good idea because that's what they did in the bible the bible said he publicly showed by the scriptures that jesus was the christ amen and we can publicly show that this message is jesus christ amen but ram said i may not do it but this message will introduce jesus christ to the world amen that's what he said and look away to jesus 1963 i think december 29th so see he publicly convinced them verse one of chapter 19. we'll finish with this yeah i'll just stop right there cause i'm gonna i'm ready about an hour and 15 minutes here and it came to pass that while apollos was at corinth paul having passed through the upper coast of ephesus i'm sorry came to ephesus and finding certain disciples he said unto them have ye received the holy ghost since he believed and they said to him we have not so much as heard whether there be any holy ghost yet brother amen they heard everything about jesus is the resurrected messiah he's the crucified lamb he's the risen lamb all these scriptures he fulfilled they rejoiced they were so bold and happy about it but they never knew there was more they never knew there was more word for their age so god sent it to them i love that amen that's the reason god sent the message to you and i because he knew he wanted it praise god he knew he wanted to go further with god amen god we he knew it so he sent it to us so we could become and the bible said he gives us his word that we can become the sons of god we already were sons of god but when the holy ghost comes then we fulfill it we manifest it that we are the sons and daughters of god amen glory and he said to them unto what then were you baptized and they said unto john's baptism so baptism is connected to the baptism holy ghost you're you have to be correctly baptized and then if you weren't like in acts chapter 10 like a po like corneos then you'll immediately get baptized peter commanded them to be baptized after they're already baptized to the holy ghost verse 4 then said paul john barely baptized with the baptism of repentance saying unto the people that they should believe on him which should come after him that is on christ jesus and when they heard this they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus and when paul laid his hands upon them the holy ghost came on them and they spake with tongues and prophesied and all the men were about 12. i love this apollos is out of town so a guest minister comes in he preaches the message of the hour and the people get the holy ghost i wonder who got it first i wonder if apollo's got it while he was out where was he at in verse corinth i wonder if apollos the pastor got the holy ghost in corn while his home church got it there with paul in ephesus oh my that's beautiful praise god see this proves church you have to receive the word of your day to receive the holy ghost now jesus can come jesus could come and and in a vision of someone and they could get saved and sanctified and maybe filled with holy ghost but that that's a possibility but one thing's for sure many people need a man they need a preacher a physical man to preach them the word of the hour and god sends his own men to work for him to preach the word of the hour that the people can receive the word of their hour and receive it and be baptized with the holy ghost like when i was in guyana let's say murphy when i was in guyana i had a brother i loved this brother because when i would be preaching they had you know they had a doorway and there was no door on it and it's like 90 degrees and i'm preaching i'd be preaching and the spirit would be rising he'd go like this he go that's solid that's solid brother jesse he was just that's that was his way of preaching i said that was the way of preaching with me rather and i love that brother but he come up afterwards i said brother you just said you're so happy why are you so happy he said i was a muslim he said i was drunk with alcohol on the couch watching a movie he said and jesus christ appeared to me he starts crying while he's saying this he said jesus christ came to me in a vision i was high on weed i was drunk he said jesus christ came to me and said something like this i'm real and i want you to serve me and he said he fell on his knees he was drunk and high and he said brother amen when his niece hit the floor it all left him all the drunkenness all the it all left him but he didn't stop there sister beatrice he went to church and pretty soon he met some message people amen and then he came to the message church and got born again praise god amen that's what i'm saying jesus can save people himself just by visions but jesus is not going to just throw you out there to just do it all by yourself he attaches you to the body amen the body of believers praise god because we are a body and we need each other and we're the body of christ amen so the ephesians got the holy ghost by receiving a part of the body of christ that when they received paul they received christ musicians if you'll come i don't know about you church but that's solid praise god that this sermon is solid amen it's the word of god it is the word of god lord willing tonight we'll maybe i'll just continue on this oh yeah i thought about doing the showdown i may do that one i got just got to get a few thoughts together on that one but i had a lot i was gonna go through question three for both of us did i get to question four okay i got the question for okay yeah okay so i left off so i left off at two and a half hours into the debate it's about three and a half hours so i got about no i'm just gonna hit the highlights of there by god's grace are you grateful for the solid word of god amen i'm glad to stand on the solid rock of god's word i'm glad we're amen i don't have to lie to these kids and say oh you got baptized you're filled with the holy ghost i'm glad i don't have to lie through my teeth like that what kind of preacher would i be i encourage him you're saved now go on to sanctification remember sunday school lily i taught you a maokai that one year i said where do you think you are i gave them three little boxes are you in justification sanctification or matches that's the holy ghost and they had to decide because they need to know that you don't stop after justification you don't stop after just going through the red sea well then it's hot then you need some man and then you need some water it's not really a place to live who wants to live in the desert i want to live where there's milk and honey praise god i live where i got my own place it's not sandy there's plenty of milk honey grass just room for me praise god where's it's just the nice atmosphere where i can live in other words i want to live where god wants me to live amen god don't want me living in this earth he wants me to possess the promised land hmm that's our heads for word of prayer here i
