TRANSCRIPT
========================================
And there's only one thing eternal. Satan's not eternal. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No. Amen. &gt;&gt; He He becomes Satan. Hell is not eternal. Hell was created. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not eternal. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Greetings [music] friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of this video is to look at a current event related to [music] the revelations that God revealed to his prophet, Brother William Brandham. This past week, a famous [music] evangelical named Kirk Cameron went on record saying he's not settled about hell and has asked for further discussion about hell to determine whether it is eternal or not. So this topic of course just piqu my interest as a end time message believer of the revelations that God revealed to William Brandham, God's true prophet. William Brandham taught that hell was not eternal as I have a few videos about this. So I'll leave links to those in the description so you can watch those. And so this week the evangelical Christian community mostly in America I would imagine or United States has been up in arms about Kirk Cameron. He's a famous former actor and he's open to the idea that hell is not eternal. And it's refreshing from my point of view to see Kirk Cameron being honest and it's sad to see his opponents attack him the way they do. Now, I don't support Kirk Cameron in any way. I did like a little bit of the work he did with the Way of the Master series, but that was a work mostly of justification because it reminded me of St. Paul in Athens in Acts chapter 17 where he's trying to convince sinners who are intellectual giants to accept the truth of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. I appreciate that work of justification. But of course, they did very little work on sanctification and very little work on the baptism of the Holy Ghost because if I'm not mistaken, they believe a person is filled with the Holy Ghost as soon as they believe the gospel. And of course, that's wrong. The Bible foretold it in Ezekiel 36. There's three works of grace. justification, sanctification, the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Ezekiel called it a new heart, a new spirit, and then God's spirit. Jesus even breathed on his disciples who were already saved and ministered with him for over 3 years. He breathed on them and said, "Receive the Holy Ghost. Go up to Jerusalem until you're endued with power from on high." So, the baptism of the Holy Ghost was more power for the believer in the soul. And Jesus is the one that originated the language of the baptism of the Holy Ghost in Acts 1:5. He said, "You shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence." So, let's start with the videos here on Kirk Cameron. Just two short videos here by God's grace. The first video will show Kirk Cameron saying that he's open to believing that there's not a continual eternal torment. Here's the video. So my position as it stands today and again I'm I'm I'm I'm we're the beauty of this is that we're always learning and growing, right? So I'm open to new light. If you guys have a position that you can share with me, I will gladly change my mind. I used to hold the position of conscious eternal torment because that's just what I was taught by people that I love and trust. I've learned that there are other positions and a very robust argument can be made for conditionalism or annihilationism as Edward Fudge uh posits here and it it fits the character of God in my understanding more than the the conscious eternal torment position because it brings in the mercy of God together with the justice of God. It doesn't leave judgment out. It is just, but it also fits with the Old Testament picture of the fate of the wicked, which is to be uh destroyed. It is to die and it is to perish, not live forever in an eternal barbecue. And the classic verses that used to get me into eternal torment, you know, the punishment, uh, everlasting punishment, everlasting destruction, um, fits beautifully with a destruction, punishment, judgment that is irreversible and lasts forever. That is the eternalness of that punishment and that destruction. So that's where I am today. &gt;&gt; Now I want to play a video from Ray Comfort who worked with Kirk Cameron for over 10 years with Living Waters Ministries. And he said he talked to Kirk Cameron on the phone and Kirk Cameron clarified and said he's not settled on the issue and is asking for further discussion. So here's the video. Some of you are aware of the fact that Kirk recently shared his questions and developing thoughts about the biblical nature of hell and the fate of the wicked. On his show, his son asked him a question and Kirk gave his honest thoughts, indicating that he finds the view known as conditional mortality or annihilationism to be both compelling and possibly biblically supported. While it certainly seemed from some of the things Kirk said on his podcast that he was indicating that this is now his official view, when I spoke with him personally on the phone, he told me that while he believes the Bible appears to point in the direction of this view, he's not settled on the matter and has asked for further discussion. Now friends, hopefully Kirk Cameron will have the courage to stand upon the truth. I consider this topic of non-eternal hell a minor. Sort of like serpent seed. It's a minor, but it is more light that is shining for the believer to see in order to further illuminate the word of God. Like brother Ram said about the serpent seed we put out on a recent video that it just shines more light on the truth that we're all trying to see. Of course, we realize that that doesn't save a man. Neither does it condemn a man. But it only brings light upon the subject that we're all trying so hard to get the people to see. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It only brings light. So hell being not eternal is a minor. You don't have to believe that hell is not eternal in order to be saved. In other words, you don't have to believe in annihilationalism in order to be saved. Nor do you have to believe in the serpent seed to be saved. But it just shines more gospel light on the word of God. And truly believing the truth about hell not being eternal and the serpent seed. It is a restoration of the apostolic faith, the biblical faith that was once delivered to the saints. So, I've watched some other videos about responses to Kirk Cameron amongst other evangelicals, and none of them can prove by the Bible that Kirk Cameron is wrong. They cite their regular scriptures, but then sadly they cite their church fathers or church creeds rather than the Bible. They normally cite Matthew 18:8 where Jesus said cast into everlasting fire. And so they just focus on that one verse. And I know there's a few other verses they focus on, but the truth is there's more verses that testify that hell is not eternal and that sinners do not go through punishment eternally. Now, I think you'll find the most thorough teaching from God's prophet, Brother Brandham, in the church age book, chapter 4. It's in the Samriian church age under the reward for overcoming section. Brother Ram breaks it down. It's so simple. It's so scriptural to show that hell is not eternal. And it's so important to know that the Bible never says they burn eternally. It never uses the word eternal to speak of burning or torment eternally. Yes, the Bible says everlasting, but anytime everlasting is not applied to God. It does not mean eternal. So everlasting fire or everlasting burning does not mean eternal because it's not applied to God. It's applied to the sinner and their punishment and their torment. So it's that simple. Brother Random there in the church's book shows how the word forever can be used lots of different ways and it doesn't always mean eternal such as God judging the house of Eli forever. And when you search the scriptures, God didn't judge it eternally. He judged it four generations later. So everlasting in that context just meant a vanishing point. Eventually it would end. Then brother M shows how destruction and perish are always used in relation to God's judgment upon sinners which means they have an ending point. Any unbeliever has an ending point. But the believer does not have an ending point because the believer has eternal life or life everlasting or life eternal. And I love this quote. quote, brother Brandham says, "Now, if a sinner is going to go to hell and then suffer the same as you are going to heaven and enjoy heaven, then he has the same kind of life you already have." And that's the main point of this topic. If someone is going to suffer consciously eternally, they already have eternal life. They already have the same life that the believer has. And of course, that's a lie. They do not have eternal life. That's why I suggest for every person on the fence about this, the accusers of brother Brandham or those who don't even know about brother Brandham, do a Bible concordance study on eternal life and life eternal. If you do, you'll find 30 verses only in the New Testament that talk about eternal life and life eternal. And if you read them in context, you'll see how life eternal is only promised to the believer, not the unbeliever. Eternal life and life eternal is only promised to the believer, not the unbeliever. Even if you look at the first occurrence of eternal life in Matthew 19:16, the rich young ruler says, "What may I do that I might obtain eternal life?" So this proves he did not have eternal life. And that's what I saw from some of the videos of these attackers of Kirk Cameron. They believe through their creeds that everyone already has eternal life. That's why they can burn eternally. That's a lie. This proves it with the very first occurrence of eternal life. This rich young ruler did not have eternal life. He knew he didn't. That's why he came to Jesus to ask for it. And then he went away sadly because he refused to receive it. He refused to sell out all that he had, give to the poor, and follow the Lord Jesus Christ. First John, the book of First John will give you the most truth on this topic. Although all 30 verses are great, 1 John proves that eternal life is only for the believer, and no murderer or no sinner with sin unconfessed has eternal life. 1 John 3:15, "And ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him." So we get so much revelation here. Eternal life must be inside the believer. No murderer with unconfessed sin of murdering has eternal life in them. Therefore, they cannot live eternally. Now, their human spirits will last many thousands of years. Think of Cain. He's been dead o almost 6,000 years. And his human spirit and human soul is still being tormented in lake of fire right now. So, those human spirits can last thousands. Brother Ram says perhaps millions of years. They can burn millions and millions of years, billions of years. We don't know. But at some point they will be annihilated and cease to exist. They will perish. They will be destroyed. And Satan will be destroyed as well. Satan is not eternal. There will come a time when there's no more sin, no more devil, no more temptation. The Bible says the last enemy that's to be defeated is death in 1 Corinthians chapter 15. Thank God. And once death is done away with and annihilated, then God's people can live eternally in the new Jerusalem with the Lord Jesus Christ. 1 John 2:25 says, "This is the promise that he hath promised us even eternal life." It's not promised to unbelievers. And this is the record 1 John 5:11, "That God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his son. He that hath the son hath life, and he that hath not the son of God hath not life." It's so clear. Unbelievers do not have eternal life because they have not accepted the Lord Jesus Christ. They've not repented of their sins, been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and they have not received the baptism of the Holy Ghost. These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God, that ye may know that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God. 1 John 5:1-13. And lastly, 1 John 5:20. And we know that the Son of God has come, and hath given us an understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his son, Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life. So we get the truth that God is one person. God is invisible but he's manifested in his son Jesus Christ. This is the true God. Not a second God, not a second person. Jesus Christ is God, supreme deity, the image of the invisible God. And Jesus Christ is eternal life. In closing, friends, I hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God. I just thought I'd do this current event because it relates directly to the message of the hour. for this beautiful revelation God gave us through his prophet brother William Brandham. No doubt brother Brandham finished the mystery of God. So here's a mystery all these evangelicals still arguing about is hell eternal or not but God's prophet brother Brandham gave us the revelation many many decades ago. So we rejoice in the truth of God's word. See, and if you got life without in, HOW CAN YOU PERISH? &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE BECOME A PART OF THE ETERNAL. AND THERE'S ONLY ONE thing eternal. SATAN'S not eternal. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He He becomes Satan. &gt;&gt; Hell is not eternal. Hell was created. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not eternal. AND THESE BODIES are not eternal. &gt;&gt; They were created. BUT THE SPIRIT OF GOD IS ETERNAL. &gt;&gt; AMEN. IT NEVER HAD A BEGINNING OR it never has an end. And the ONLY WAY WE CAN HAVE ETERNAL LIFE FROM THAT GREEK WORD ZOEY, WHICH MEANS GOD'S OWN LIFE, WE HAVE WE BECOME A PART OF GOD WHEN WE BECOME SONS AND DAUGHTERS OF GOD. AND WE HAVE A LIFE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO THE PART THAT LIVES US [laughter] THAT RECOGNIZES THIS WORD FROM HERE TO THERE THAT RECOGNIZES IS A ONION LIFE. LIFE WITHOUT IN IS GOD'S OWN LIFE IN US. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Just as Jesus said, the Holy Ghost will guide us into all truth. So, those of us who've been message believers have already been guided into this truth. We don't have to wonder about this, debate about this. The Bible's clear on this. You only have eternal life when you have faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. Saving faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. And if you don't have that today, repent of your sins. Get on your knees. Cry out to God for mercy for all your sins. Confess all your sins. Call upon the name of the Lord and you shall be saved. Be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. I made this saying through scripture. If you want the Holy Ghost daily read Bible, pray obey every day. You've got to read the Bible. Pray every day. Obey the Bible. And the Bible said God gives the Holy Ghost to them that obey him in Acts 5:32. Friends, we rejoice in the blood of Jesus Christ. That is what saved us. And then the life of the blood now comes upon us to sanctify us and then fill our souls. We call the baptism of the Holy Ghost cuz that's what Jesus called it. And through that baptism of the Holy Ghost, we are made ready for Jesus's secret coming, the second coming of Jesus Christ, the pre-tribulation rapture of the bride of Jesus Christ, snatching his bride away. They'll be caught up or snatched away to meet the Lord in the air. And then God will go back to the Jews and pour out his wrath upon the Gentiles. Praise God for his mercy and his love. Praise God for his son Jesus Christ, the shedding of his blood and the sending of the Holy Ghost that we can have life eternal with Jesus Christ our Lord. If you have any questions, concerns or testimonies about this video, please contact [music] me. God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire [music] of your heart. Very happy to be here this afternoon and again in defense of the gospel of Jesus Christ [music] to bring the good tidings, the good news that Jesus raised from the dead, living among man today, his church. [music] The same Jesus that was yesterday will be today and forever is never failed.
