[0:00] of all the times that I've been behind
[0:02] the pull pit at the Tabernacle I have
[0:05] never never in any time of my Ministry
[0:08] ever worked into the Realms of God and
[0:11] the spiritual Realms has been this
[0:14] time beyond anything I ever did in any
[0:17] time of my Ministry in any meeting at
[0:20] anywhere like this mostly it's on
[0:22] healing this is revealing of Truth by
[0:25] The Same Spirit Same
[0:28] Spirit I'd like to to add this that of
[0:33] all the services I've ever had in my
[0:36] life I believe this week has been the
[0:40] most glorious time of all my life in
[0:43] Services no matter what I have I've seen
[0:47] great Miracles performed of course
[0:49] before in healing
[0:51] services but this is beyond
[0:54] that that's been one of the great times
[0:58] highlights of my life
[1:00] is to be here and seeing the little
[1:03] Tabernacle take on this different look
[1:06] not only that but the inside take on a
[1:08] different Lo
[1:10] Hallelujah this has been a tremendous
[1:12] week for me I'm tired my mind is tired
[1:16] because I I have was the best that I
[1:19] could do and something strange going on
[1:21] every day I would be amazed to walk in
[1:24] the room and be there for a few minutes
[1:27] and see something just turn me
[1:29] completely around
[1:30] and here I go in there I pick up the
[1:32] notes I pick up books of Dr Smith you're
[1:35] a Smith and all all the writers and and
[1:38] read in read down in their books I say
[1:40] now here's the Sixth Seal here's the
[1:42] fourth seal now what does this man say
[1:44] he'd say what was this that I look over
[1:47] here and get another man he said it was
[1:48] such and such and it looked like it just
[1:51] it just didn't work right and I thought
[1:53] well what is it Lord I walk up and down
[1:55] the floor a while I kneel down and pray
[1:58] go back and pick up the Bible sit down
[1:59] read walk back and forth then all of a
[2:02] sudden when I got quiet they just
[2:04] unfolded like that then I grab a pen
[2:06] right quick go to write it down like
[2:08] that whatever I was seeing and doing
[2:10] watching it like that to got it roll
[2:11] down then I take the rest of the day go
[2:13] down and chase this out and see if it
[2:15] tied all the way down through the
[2:17] scriptures then it prove all things I
[2:21] got this year and I think now there's
[2:22] many people had Visions there's many
[2:24] been Revelations if it's contrary to the
[2:26] word leave it alone that's right leave
[2:28] it alone now
[2:30] now then I run this e down like this run
[2:33] it down like I jot down little things I
[2:35] thought well the class will be glad to
[2:37] hear this because it ties here ties here
[2:39] I let's see what does this say here yes
[2:40] it yeah here it is right here see bring
[2:43] it back through the Bible and tie the
[2:44] thing down through the week there his
[2:46] own tapes you're welcome to them and I
[2:49] have did it to the best of my knowledge
[2:51] under Christian Fellowship grace of God
[2:55] to all Man by Jesus Christ I've done the
[2:59] very best that I I know how you've been
[3:00] one of the finest classes there's been
[3:03] nobody could have said any nicer you all
[3:05] have come in here at 1:00 in the day up
[3:08] till 5:00 to whenever they opened the
[3:11] church and brought the let the people
[3:13] come in you stood in the cold you set in
[3:16] the snow you've done everything stood
[3:18] around the wall your legs ACH i' see the
[3:20] men sit down let the women sit up in
[3:22] different ones and stand like that
[3:24] sitting around I thought Lord this been
[3:27] a mysterious week the whole thing been
[3:30] kind of strange how would people come
[3:33] see them stand around the outside in the
[3:35] windows in the doors back around the
[3:36] back everywhere listening and as far as
[3:39] a speaker I'm far from a speaker I I got
[3:42] that much intelligence to know that I'm
[3:44] not but I'm not a speaker but why would
[3:46] people sit and listen like that why
[3:49] would they do it they don't come to hear
[3:51] a person like me but they're coming
[3:53] because there's something in it drawing
[3:55] a
[3:56] people see there's something in it
[3:59] that's dra
[4:00] this
