[0:11] Old Testament teaching on hair length
[0:15] in the Old Testament we once again find
[0:18] the indisputable truth that God never
[0:21] asked a godly Jewish woman to cut her
[0:23] hair so we conclude that st. Paul's
[0:26] teaching from the New Testament must
[0:28] have been in complete harmony with God's
[0:30] desire for hair length in the Old
[0:32] Testament some Bible readers may be
[0:37] familiar with the Nazarite vow from
[0:39] Numbers chapter 6 verses 1 through 21
[0:42] part of this vow was for the dedicated
[0:44] individual a man in this case to not cut
[0:47] his hair for a period of time uncut hair
[0:50] was a sign of total consecration or
[0:52] dedication to God in this vow we cannot
[0:56] find an example of a woman under a
[0:58] Nazarite vow ever cutting her hair so it
[1:01] would seem that only men were to cut
[1:03] their hair at the conclusion of their
[1:05] Nazarite vow
[1:06] it seems women in the terms of their
[1:09] hair were under a lifelong Nazarite vow
[1:12] meaning they were to never cut their
[1:14] hair just as God commands in the New
[1:16] Testament we believe God has always
[1:19] asked all godly women whether Jewish or
[1:21] Christian to do the same leave their
[1:24] hair uncut as a sign of total
[1:26] consecration and dedication to the plan
[1:29] of God keeping her husband as her ruler
[1:32] over her we believe that all Christian
[1:35] women are under a similar total
[1:37] consecration to God to not cut their
[1:39] hair in order to display the New
[1:42] Testament teaching on headship based
[1:44] upon the New Testament text we have
[1:46] already covered we believe it is the
[1:48] Bible command of God Himself that all
[1:51] Christian women let their hair grow long
[1:53] and uncut
[1:55] furthermore as you read deeper in the
[1:58] Old Testament there are two specific
[1:59] cases in the Old Testament where God did
[2:02] command the cutting of hair but it was
[2:04] never a command given to godly Jewish
[2:06] women such as Sarah Rebecca Abigail
[2:09] Esther and the like so we do not believe
[2:12] these two examples pertain to
[2:14] consecrated Christian women today the
[2:17] first example is from Deuteronomy
[2:19] chapter 21 verses 10 through 13 Moses
[2:23] commanded that Israelite men were to
[2:24] have their new wives taken from
[2:26] captivity after war with an enemy nation
[2:28] shave their own heads as part of their
[2:31] transition into the Jewish religion and
[2:34] culture the second example is from
[2:37] Jeremiah 7 verses 28 through 30 God
[2:40] speaks to Jerusalem the capital of the
[2:42] nation of Israel and operates them for
[2:45] their disobedience rebellion and
[2:47] abominable acts God said cut off thine
[2:51] hair o Jerusalem and cast it away and
[2:53] take up a lamentation on high places for
[2:56] the LORD hath rejected and forsaken the
[2:58] generation of his wrath it is difficult
[3:02] to tell if God is speaking literally to
[3:03] every man and woman or just men or just
[3:07] women in this case and it is possible
[3:10] that this is just figurative language
[3:11] where God is speaking to the entire
[3:13] people one thing is for sure God told
[3:17] them to cut off their hair because he
[3:19] was rejecting and forsaking this
[3:20] generation due to their wickedness and
[3:23] abominable acts let us today live such
[3:26] godly lives that God will not reject us
[3:29] we can start by obeying God's commands
[3:32] on different hair lengths for men and
[3:34] women so we again conclude that God
[3:37] never asked an obedient faithful godly
[3:40] Jewish woman to ever cut her hair for
[3:43] the sake of fashion convenience style or
[3:45] beauty as women believe they can today
[3:48] the Bible is clear that all women are to
[3:51] have long uncut hair as a sign that they
[3:54] are under the headship of their husbands
[3:56] and Christ and
[4:00] United States history of hair length
[4:04] from the beginning of our nation the
[4:06] United States most American women obeyed
[4:09] the Bible and kept their hair long and
[4:11] uncut until the 1920s the Roaring
[4:16] Twenties marked the ending to appear in
[4:18] in which women kept the glory God gave
[4:20] them the 1920s was the first time the
[4:24] majority of American women rejected the
[4:26] glory of God that God designed
[4:28] specifically for them in dressed for the
[4:32] occasion me and Miller wrote the new
[4:36] decade of the roaring 20s transform
[4:38] young women's fashion as never before
[4:40] for the first time women grabbed their
[4:43] long hair which had always been so
[4:45] time-consuming to style and snipped it
[4:48] off bobbed hair was all the rage the
[4:51] boyish Bob was chin length or even
[4:53] shorter in understanding fashion
[4:58] Elizabeth R wrote the extreme of the
[5:01] 1920's style was the short straight
[5:03] sleeveless v necked Jimmy's dress worn
[5:07] with the net cliche over short hair for
[5:10] not only wear women's clothes changing
[5:12] many women now had short hair and wore
[5:15] makeup in the article short hair short
[5:19] career by Ethel Williamson it says after
[5:22] World War one ended big changes were
[5:24] afoot not only had woman won the right
[5:27] to vote but dancer Irene castle had
[5:29] bobbed her hair as the 1920s roared in
[5:32] more and more women headed for beauty
[5:35] shops to have their hair bobbed at the
[5:37] time few women were eager to have their
[5:39] bobs done in a barbershop with a row of
[5:42] men watching and snickering in many
[5:44] cases this would be the biggest decision
[5:47] the woman would ever make to cut off a
[5:49] lifetime growth of hair
[5:50] knowing her husband father or boyfriend
[5:53] was dead set against it how sad and
[5:57] disgraceful that our nation fell from
[5:59] the godly standards it once held and
[6:01] women began despising the glory of long
[6:04] hair that God reserved for them but
[6:07] there is a small remnant of Holy Ghost
[6:09] field Christian women today that still
[6:12] honor the Bible and wear their hair the
[6:14] way God wants it
[6:16] a prophet restores truth on hair length
[6:21] as our website and previous video state
[6:25] we believe God's in a genuine Bible
[6:27] based prophet to this earth by the name
[6:29] of William Branham since brother Branham
[6:32] was a Bible based prophet God led him to
[6:34] preach and teach repeatedly on the Bible
[6:37] truth that men and women should honor
[6:39] God with their hair length based upon
[6:41] 1st Corinthians 11 verse 1 through 16
[6:43] this Bible based teaching was a
[6:46] restoration of the truth of the Bible
[6:48] that Christians had honored for
[6:50] centuries but now has been rejected in
[6:52] the churches of the Western civilization
[6:54] since the roaring 20s or 1920s
[6:59] let's listen to this prophet of God
[7:01] teach and restore the truth of the Bible
[7:03] to the people of God in regards to hair
[7:06] length cut the hair what they gonna do a
[7:10] hair to a woman is a mess right back on
[7:15] there's arrived is one that is
[7:17] consecrated more a perfect
[7:19] Samson must consecrated to age into a
[7:23] purpose therefore he had long hair the
[7:25] woman that's a child of God let your
[7:28] hair grow - or she's consecrated to
[7:30] every word of God this prophet was also
[7:35] constrained by God to warn the people of
[7:37] the haunting that would take place
[7:39] during the Tribulation Period because
[7:41] the world and churches rejected the
[7:44] truth about the Prophet goes on to
[8:19] encourage our Christian sisters to wear
[8:22] their crown of glory long uncut hair
[8:25] just as Christ were crown of thorns for
[8:28] us all we see that go down streets mu
[8:32] ladies as long hair said he's
[8:34] old-fashioned
[8:35] remember
[8:36] that's scholars that's a crown that
[8:40] you're wearing
[8:41] Godse was your glory man has pride why
[8:49] am i prime she was wearing kind of
[8:52] floors for your law where was pried open
[8:57] shamed
[8:58] in conclusion we pray that you will
[9:02] consider all the Bible and historical
[9:04] evidence that we have presented in this
[9:06] video and if you are a true Christian
[9:08] man we pray you will begin cutting your
[9:10] hair frequently so as not to bring shame
[9:12] upon yourself and your head the Lord
[9:15] Jesus if you are a true Christian woman
[9:18] our prayers that you will now let your
[9:20] hair grow long and uncut for the rest of
[9:24] your consecrated walk with the Lord
[9:26] Jesus that your obedience will bring
[9:28] honor to your husband and to Christ
[9:31] we want to encourage all viewers to
[9:34] search the Scriptures and see if you can
[9:36] present any Scripture in which God asks
[9:39] a godly Jewish or Christian woman to cut
[9:41] their hair
[9:42] we will humbly repent and change our
[9:44] doctrine if we can be proved wrong by
[9:47] the Word of God alone but we believe you
[9:50] will find that God never asked any godly
[9:52] woman to cut her hair just as God never
[9:55] asked anyone to wear makeup
[9:57] just as no believer in the book of Acts
[9:59] was ever baptized with sprinkling or the
[10:02] titles father son Holy Ghost were never
[10:05] called apollon at one single baptism
[10:08] just as God never said he was three
[10:11] separate distinct or co-equal persons
[10:14] may each of us humbly learn to live by
[10:16] every word of God in the Bible which
[10:18] will keep the anointing of the Holy
[10:20] Ghost upon us that the glory of God not
[10:22] depart from our lives our homes and our
[10:25] churches if you would like more bible
[10:28] teaching in history about long hair in
[10:30] the bible please contact us god bless
[10:34] you and may Jesus Christ be the desire
[10:36] of your heart
