TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] I enjoy brother Neville's preaching and everything and I certainly enjoy that fine oldfashioned singing it and it was a marvelous Masterpiece that I ever heard one and I was so happy to know that uh the one who the Lord was using to bring the message I was associated with in the work of the Lord greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to see how God's prophet brother William brandham supported and was benefited very much by Brother Orman Neville's radio Ministry at least from 1954 to the end of brother Ram's life 1965 based upon these quotes from God's Prophet brother brandham it shows he lovingly happily and enthusiastically supported the five full ministry he supported the Outreach Ministries of the fivefold ministry and it proves William Brandon was not a press play and Obey legalist or Bible n like the current brandom Tabernacle has become the current brandom Tabernacle is in a sad very sad spiritual condition they don't even physically attend church brother brandom always physically attended church and brother Bram said you cannot be as good of a Christian if you don't physically come to church now the fell said I be a Christian and stay home just as well no you can now you've got to meet together with the rest of the body he has blessed us together in heavenly in Christ Jesus and to you old man or woman when you separate yourself from Believers people say I can stay at home be just as good a Christian as I can at church you can't the Bible said not forsake our stim ourselves together and that much more as we see the time coming if you're a Christian you long to go where other Christians are in fellowship with other Christians so you cannot stay away from church and live the same life it can't do it because it's like I I I I'm hungry but I'll never go to a table I just I'll never eat I just I ain't going to do it see you've got to go and feed on the word of God and fellowship one with another we need one another more now than we ever did need each other is now as we go through these quotes from God's Prophet you'll see how brother BR believed in Outreach radio Outreach so of course today he would support YouTube Outreach podcast Outreach any means to get the Gospel of Jesus Christ out to the people and remember brother Neville's radio sermons were going out to the public anyone at all his sermons were going out to people who are not his sheep or not part of his home Church you know today some people are so critical of YouTube Ministries or Rumble Ministries or any social media Ministries it just shows they don't have understanding and brother Bram said when people are like that critical like that he said it's just their human mind wants something to pick on and up in that same place there was one looked like an eagle and one look like an Haw on where's them horses that come got Elijah I just goes to show you see the human mind just wants something to pick on that's right now I notic by God's grace I'll leave a link to the YouTube playlist of the videos I made on the over 24 lies coming out of brandom Tabernacle brother brandom said some of the most awfulest things you've ever heard such as brother brandom is perfectly infallible which is in essence what brandom Tabernacle is currently saying because its pastor says every word on tape is thus sayith the Lord that's heresy that's idolatry so shame on Bram Tabernacle the current bam Tabernacle and its leadership for promoting such idolatry such lies but hopefully this video will help somebody overcome those evil spirits by the grace of God so we'll start here in 1954 the first quote is acts of the Holy Spirit brother BR said I enjoy brother Neville's preaching and everything on the radio program he said his wife and kitties everybody watches for that program from what I've read it was either at 9:30 or 9:00 a.m. on every single Saturday morning he said we look forward to it and we're glad of it let's listen to the quote I enjoy brother Neville's preaching and everything and I certainly enjoy that fine oldfashioned singing that he and the sisters does to on the the radio program if you all have never heard them yet many of you or turn in every Saturday morning and listen to them and you'll certainly be blessed while my wife and kitties and everybody's watching to that program just like it was if I was going to be down there myself and I down there one of the loved one in the family we look forward to that that program on Saturday morning and we're so glad of it next in 1955 brother random said it's a fine radio broadcast the singing's really good let's listen to the quote and brother Neville will announce the full program on his broadcast next Saturday morning how many hear the broadcast don't you think it's fine I tell you that singing is really good I heard brother Temple I believe on it the other day and um I appreciate that song you dedicated to us we just all listening in and in 1956 brother random publicly apologized to brother Neville it seems like brother brandom was supposed to preach on the radio broadcast but he went to the wrong location so he said I want to publicly apologize to brother Neville but brother Rand was in Jeffersonville and he was supposed to be a New Albany for the radio broadcast let's listen to the quote and just before we have prayer and the reading of the word I want to apologize publicly to brother Neville yesterday I stayed home from down in Kentucky yesterday purposely to preach for him on the broadcast next Saturday God willing and brother Neville willing I want to speak on the morning broadcast next Saturday for brother nville and uh so he U was so gracious to to forgive me he's is he said I guess I took advantage of him and he's one of those guys that can I can pass the compliment back and U expecting somebody and what got me upset was early that morning when they called me to brother ly and them in new Aly and I it was just about 10 minutes to 9:00 and I said oh I supposed to be on that broadcast in 10 minutes and here me and Jeffersonville him down there waiting for me so I brother Woods called him yesterday and I thought i' let brother Woods apologize for me first you know so he just penalized it to make me speak this morning come on down so here we was and so we were then next in September of 1956 brother BR asked if brother Neville and his sister would sing a song special he said because we all enjoy to hear them on the radio let's listen to the quote I would just like to ask brother Neville if he and his sister would sing a special for us just before would you like that we'd all enjoy we hear him on the radio all right tonight or not next in 1957 brother Bram gave some of the most inspiring quotes about the radio Ministry brother Rand said he heard brother Neville preach one of the most appropriate sermons for the day that we're living in he said it was a great treasure dearly in my heart so this shows brother Brandon was a prophet of God who loved the fivefold ministry the fivefold ministry would strengthen him and give him great Treasures that lines up with 2 Corinthians I believe chapter 3 the Bible said we have treasure in Earth and vessels God using a pastor Ministry or man Neville to give a treasure to the prophet Ministry by the grace of God and also you find other little nuggets in here brother Ram said while they were listening to the radio program he was helping his wife by washing dishes then brother Ram says it was a marvelous Masterpiece the radio sermon by Brother Orman Neville if I ever heard one and then he was so happy to know that the one the Lord was using to bring the message through the radio Outreach he was associated with in the work of the Lord so it made him thankful wow I'm associated with this preacher on the radio that's putting out these marvelous masterpieces and then he prays that God would continue to be with Orman Neville for the great powerful messages the sermons not pressing play and Obey he was grateful for both the powerful messages in the song and in the word so brother Neville's Ministry was singing and preaching let's listen to this quote thank you brother it is understood that the Neville Trio is one of the best trios in the nation that's right that's right and um how many heard the broadcast yesterday I am an old veteran preacher over 20 years old and I Heard lots of sermons but I believe I heard one of the most uh appropriate sermons for the day that we're living I heard it yesterday by our pastor brother nille you who missed that missed the great treasure that was dearly in my heart and when my wife was washing dishes Juni I was helping her so that won't hurt Lord makes you woring too so while I was helping her wash the dishes we both had to stop uh to just to remark to each other how that the Lord was using our brother and yesterday's message on the radio and it was a marvelous Masterpiece that I ever heard one and I was so happy to know that uh the one who the Lord was using to bring the message I was associated with in the work of the Lord and so and the quart head or the trio yesterday was just marvelous and they are all the time and so is our pastor and we appreciate this with all of our hearts and pray that God will continue to be with our brother and Grant these great powerful messages both in song and in the word as the time goes on and then in the evening service that same day God keeps his word brother Ram said I wish every listener would listen to that program brother Neville's radio program he said I was never so blessed in listening to the program last Saturday he said how many heard that message that was a masterpiece so brother brah the same day later that same day is still feeding on the Revelation and the Masterpiece the Holy Ghost gave to brother Orman Neville on the radio sermon one of the brothers said who is that preacher and brother Ram said that's brother Neville that's his time on the radio notice the brother didn't say who's that tape boy pressing play the brother didn't say that the brother said who's that preacher then brother Bram said I love to hear Brother Neville speak not because he's a good preacher because he lives what he preaches let's listen to the quote and I wish that every listener would listen to that program now he doesn't tell me to say this but I never was so blessed in listening to a program as I was this last Saturday how many heard that message that was a masterpiece wlrp 9:00 until 9:30 each Saturday morning the Neville Trio and I was speaking to the brother who takes the recordings brother Leo which is in the room and he was so carried away with it that he didn't he said say who's this preacher he was has the radio on and brother Jean or some of them said it's brother naille this is his time and it really was wonderful not only that but everyone I tell you the reason I i' love to hear Brother Neville speak not mainly because he's a good preacher but because I know that he lives what he preaches and I would rather you would live me a sermon than preach me one it'll be more effective then in September 57 brother Bram said he really gets joy out of listening to the preaching and singing of brother Neville and then the singing of the Neville quartet let's listen to the quote and we're yall listen to his radio now and and and invite all your neighbors to listen I really get joy out of listening to their preaching and singing the Neville quartet I don't say that because he's sitting here if I said that didn't mean if my heart would be a hypocrite right I'd have to repent but I mean it now I'd rather give him a little Rose butt now than a whole Reef after he's gone then brother Bram says in October 57 regarding the Neville quartet I'm sure they do you good good turn and listen to them on the radio Ministry let's listen to the quote don't forget the services brother Neville's broadcast now that's on wlrp Saturday morning at 9:00 the Neville quartet and I'm sure they do you good turn in listen to them and if I can if I get back in time or see I'm going to get back I'll call wife if the Lord permits me go see dear old brother Bosworth uh uh you all and I'll be back Sunday night next in 1959 brother random and who is this said he and his wife and kitties will get around the little radio and hover around it to listen to brother Neville and his broadcast his wonderful words how he exalts the God that he loves and believes and brother Ram says he loves brother Neville because he was a theologian now most quotes make it seem like theologians are bad but here brother BR says a man in the fivefold ministry brother Bram said Orman Neville was filled with the Holy Ghost can be a theologian because it just means to study the ways of God study about God there's nothing wrong with studying about God in fact everybody in the message does that if they're honest and really loves God so it's not a bad thing to be a theologian as long as you're humble with it and you're baptized with the Holy Ghost of course we wouldn't go to theological schools that' likely be a sin because of their false Doctrine but in our humble way we're theologians we study the ways of God we study God's word and then there's a little nugget at the end of this quote brother R says when you see a minister and his wife getting along like that the love between Orman Neville and his wife in sweetness and humbleness just makes the church go that much better so a loving husband and wife relationship between the pastor and his wife impacts the rest of the church the rest of the church sees the love between the pastor and his wife and they follow that so the pastor and his wife influence the people their love for each other influences the people to be loving in their marriages as well let's listen to the quote don't forget brother Neville's broadcast on Sunday or on Saturday at 9:00 over wlrp I just love to hear them don't you the quartet or the Trio sounds so pretty wife and I and the kitties we all get the little radio out and and hover around it to listen to brother Neville and his broadcast and his wonderful words of how he exalts the God that he loves and believes don't say this to you strangers here if you're having a church home come jar with us I tell you not saying this in him sitting here no sir I've said this many times I love brother Neville this first he's a theologian first thing he's a child of God that next thing he's the same every day I've known him for years he's never changed one bit he's still arm and nville a servant of the Lord Jesus and I think he's got the other night I called up to asked him if he didn't in his program could make room for us to come down pray for the sick this some coming in was this morning you know and the little wife answered the phone and I was talking to my wife back there about it and how we thank God for his lovely little wife and his family that's that's very fine when you see a minister and his wife getting along like that and sweetness and humbleness that just makes the church go that much better that's just sweeter as the days goes by then in August of 1959 brother bandam again talks about our dear beloved Pastor brother Neville he made a remark that went over and over in brother bram's mind and he just can't forget it he was quoting it to his other friends to see how one sermon from the fivefold ministry can cause you to reach out and share with other people and brother Neville's comment was that when God takes away the Holy Spirit off the Earth the formal Church religion will not even know the difference CU they currently don't have the spirit of God working with them he says wasn't that astounding then brother R looks at his own Heart Lord i' like to live in this life until even the least bit of his grieving I'll know it in my heart brother Ram says I want to be gone in the Rapture when the Lord takes his Spirit off the Earth let's listen to the quote I heard our dear beloved Pastor brother Neville make a remark on his television uh Radio cast the other morning that just went over and over in my mind I just can't forget it I quoted it to a friend of mine last night and that was this that there will after the taking away of the Holy Spirit out of the earth that far Church religion will go right on not knowing the difference did you ever did you how many heard that wasn't that astounding they don't know the holy spirit so they won't know when it's gone and they'll just be going right on just the same when the last one is sealed into the body of Christ they'll still be going on trying to bring converts to it because they don't know what it is and their formal religions will continue on just like they were now it may not sink into you like it did to me but that was really an astounding statement that they'll be so far away just in religious rituals until they will not miss the holy spirit because they don't know what it is to begin with God have mercy on us brother I'd like to live in this life in my desire till if even the least bit of his grieving I'll know it in my heart if I should do something that would grieve him I'd be able to feel it just in a moment he let alone his absence I don't want to be here when he's not here I want to be gone man yes sir for there will be no blood on the mercy seat it'll be dark and Smoky and black the sanctuary will have no lawyer there to plead our case at that time you know the scripture says that yes the sanctuary was smoking there was no blood on The Mercy Seat then it's judgment so we see brother Ram loved astounding preaching through brother Orman Neville then we fast forward to 1965 in April around Easter time brother brandom says brother Neville was still preaching on the radio Ministry on the resurrection this is from it is it is the rising of the Sun let's listen to the quote you know you perhaps have been hearing the radio and the different ministers speaking our Noble brother Neville this morning speaking his Easter subject uh on the resurrection and I thought maybe I would take it a a little different path not to be different but just to add a little more maybe in another angle that completes all the quotes that I have on brother Neville's radio Ministry but I want you to notice too in August of 1965 the very last sermon brother Brandon preached at the brandham Tabernacle was called Satan's Eden he preaches the evening service on that Sunday but brother Ram told us that he felt led of the Lord not to preach in the morning so he could listen to brother Neville so notice it's the prophet yielding to the pastor in the local church by God's leading and brother brandom said he got a timely message from the Lord so we see how a prophet of God could be led of the Holy Spirit to let the pastor preach and then the prophet gets a timely message that he knew was from the Lord that he needed to hear brother brandham didn't say it's good for brother Neville to sit down and just press play so this is very encouraging I think it's fitting brother bram's last sermon at Brenham Tabernacle was when he yielded to the Holy Spirit and let the pastor preach in the morning and the prophet preached in the evening you see the unity of the five full ministry let's listen to the quote I will try to be briefly tonight because I know many has come from different uh sections of the country to for the service or stayed over some of you and have to go back or maybe a way to get back I thank you this morning I wanted to hear Brother Neville myself and I heard him many times and never heard him anytime but what I appreciate him but this morning that timely message I know I had the leading of the Lord to listen to that this morning very fine and I see why you people like to come and listen to him also and he'll always do you good I'm sure to listen to him and finally I want to play a quote from questions and answers on the seals 1963 they asked should evangelist continue on the field and brother Ram said of course don't change a thing don't get scrupled up now this is referring to evangelists in the fivefold ministry but I want you to see that brother random was always telling the five-fold ministry don't change a thing and so brother Neville kept his radio Ministry the whole time that the tapes were recorded at least from 54 to 65 he didn't change a thing he never told Brother Neville just sit down and press play and obey the sad part is today the brandom Tabernacle has changed it brother Ram said if you change anything he said you'll get scrupled up and that's what is happened to the current Brenham Tabernacle they're scrupled up they don't even attend church physically how could someone not feel led to attend church physically when the Bible says we must gather more physically as we see that day approaching Hebrews chap 10: 24 and 25 let's listen to the quote should evangelists continue on the field in this hour of course what they mean certainly by all means don't change the thing if Jesus is coming in the morning Preach Today like if it going to be 10 years from today but live like it's going to be at this hour don't don't get scrupled up now that's why I'm trying to warn you about see just don't be odd peculiar don't change nothing but if you're doing something wrong are doing evil repent come back to God continue on your Evangelistic service just as you always did in closing friends hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God again emphasizing the power of the fivefold ministry the unity of the fivefold ministry how a pastor's Ministry can edify a prophet of God so we thank God for the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is here guiding us into all truth helping us not to change a thing regarding the fivefold ministry and everything else in the apostolic doctrine that the Lord Jesus Christ revealed to St Paul let's continue to pray for the fivefold ministry that they'll receive astounding Revelations from the holy ghost that they can preach that they'll be able to preach marvelous masterpieces by the leadership of the Holy Ghost that will strengthen our hearts that we want to share with others that will just go around and around in our minds helping us to meditate on the Lord Jesus Christ all the day long as the good old hymn says this is my story this is my song praising My Savior all the day long if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
