========================================
[Music] greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to show what the Bible teaches about wise stewardship and how it condemns all forms of gambling I'm making this video after a believer requested this topic so I pray it's a blessing to many souls yes all gambling is sinful whether in the form of lottery tickets online fantasy sports leagues casinos and all other forms gambling falls under two of the three categories of sin first the lust of the eyes and second the pride of life as John says there are three categories of sins first John 2:16 for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the Father but is of the world in man's pride he rejects God's plan for his own life coveting after worldly pleasures rather than God's eternal treasures through the lust of the eyes seeing potential riches and power gamblers become covetous and lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God both of these conditions are found in Paul's prophetic endtime prediction about the sins of men in 2nd Timothy 3 verses 2 & 4 know this also that in the last days perilous times shall come for men should be lovers of their own selves covetous of pleasures more than lovers of God friends pride and covetousness are great temptations but God has promised to always make a way out for us in times of temptation according to 1st Corinthians 10:13 there hath no temptation taken you but such is as common to man but God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able but will with the temptation also make a way of escape that you may be able to bear it God calls you to be a fully armored Christian soldier and you must take the shield of faith the corn Ephesians 616 and faith is a revelation of God's will that you are trusting up and so with the shield you quench the fiery dart or arrow of pride and covetousness not letting it destroy you and your family you must stay safe and protected behind God's will then take the sword of the Spirit according to Ephesians 6:17 and cut down Satan's temptation by speaking God's Word against Satan or the evil spirit Jesus defeated Satan by saying it is written and it is written again in Matthew chapter 4 verses 4 & 7 st. Paul said our weapons are mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds and in this case the stronghold of gambling 2nd Corinthians 10 verses 4 and 5 for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ along with pride and the lust of the eyes here's six more reasons Christians should abstain from gambling number one money is to be gained God's Way not through man's way just like salvation has one provided way so does gaining money money should be gained through humility the fear of the Lord hard work and sound investments rather than risky unsafe decisions here we see humility and the fear of the Lord bring blessings in proverbs 22 for by humility and the fear of the Lord are riches honor and life next with hard work Christians are to work hard for their needs according to Ecclesiastes 9:10 whatsoever thy hand find it to do do it with thy might for there is no work nor device nor knowledge nor wisdom in the grave whither thou goest Paul even tells Christian slaves to work heartily as to the Lord and not to men in Colossians 3 verses 22 to 25 servants and whatsoever you do do it heartily as to the Lord and not unto men Paul also says if you make honest investments you'll reap honest rewards Galatians 6 verses 7 and 8 be not deceived God is not mocked for whatsoever man soweth that shall he also reap for he that soweth to his flesh shall reap corruption but he that so it to the spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting concerning sound investments Jesus strictly says sound investments are required for faithful stewards or managers of his resources in the parable of the talents in Matthew 25 verses 14 to 30 concerning this parable do faithful stewards gamble with their masters money of course not Jesus will call faithful investors good and faithful servants making them rulers of many things in the Millennium and the New Jerusalem Jesus will call unfaithful stewards wicked and slothful because they failed to invest their resources in the simplest easiest ways also david says all money comes from God and therefore belongs to him in first chronicles 29 11 to 14 then Oh Lord is the greatness for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is thine both riches and honor come Avey and in thine hand is to make great for all things come of thee and of thine own have we given thee money gained through gambling will probably be lost according to proverbs 13 11 wealth gods and by vanity shall be diminished but he that gathereth by labour shall increase you know your heart is evil if you want quick riches proverbs 28 22 says he that hast ahthe to be rich hath an evil eye and considereth not that poverty shall come upon him number 2 we should seek to gain contentment rather than riches gambling breeds sinful wicked covetousness but Christ is calling you and I to contentment which is a more valuable gain than millions or billions of dollars Paul literally states this in 1st Timothy 6 verses 6 to 12 but godliness with contentment is great gain for we brought nothing into this world and it is certain we can carry nothing out and having food and raiment let us be therewith content Paul continues and says riches are accompanied by great temptations which Christians must flee from but they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare and into many foolish and hurtful lusts which drown men in destruction and perdition for the love of money is the root of all evil which while some coveted after they have erred from the faith and pierced themselves through with many sorrows but Thou O man of God flee these things and follow after righteousness godliness faith love patience and meekness fight the good fight of faith lay hold on eternal life whereunto thou art also called and has professed a good profession before many witnesses proverbs 30 verses 7 & 8 towards a simple beautiful prayer of contentment I've often prayed we should ask God to keep us from being so poor that were tempted to steal but also keep us from getting rich if those riches will make us forget him two things have i required of thee deny me them not before i die remove far from me vanity and lies give me neither poverty nor riches feed me with food convenient for me lest i be full and deny thee and say who is the lord or lest i be poor and steal and take the name of my god in vain number three God's plan for your life may include having less money as Christians we should seek God to understand his calling for our life as some believers are called to be faithful with riches like Abraham and Solomon while others are called to be faithful to Christ yet being financially poor like Paul and the beggar named Lazarus proverbs 22 verse 2 says the Lord makes some rich and others poor the rich and poor meet together the Lord is the maker of them all first samuel 2:7 says something similar the Lord maketh poor and maketh rich he bringeth lo and lifteth up if you know God's will for your life regarding your finances it is easier to be content wherever God calls us on the continuum of money and wealth God wants us to be a witness with a testimony of receiving God's grace for our trials on Judgment Day on the wealthy side Abraham seems to be an excellent example of handling riches faithfully Genesis 13 to shows evidence he was very wealthy saying and Abram was very rich in cattle in silver and in gold but God saw his love for truth and how he faithfully trained his family and servants to obey God's Word God's own words say this in Genesis 18:19 for I know him that he will command his children and his household after him and they shall keep the way of the Lord to do justice and judgment that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he has spoken of him Abraham and his servants were so brave and courageous that they rescued the people and goods of Sodom and Gomorrah from four heathen kings in Genesis 14 verses 11 to 16 moving to Solomon we know Solomon was extremely rich and prosperous by God's hand as he only asked God for wisdom to rule his people in first Kings three verses 9 to 13 God made him rich as a reward because he did not ask for riches sadly though it was Solomon's many wives who turned his heart away from serving the Lord in his later years according to 1st Kings 11 verses three and four Christians can conclude it's not a sin to be rich but God is looking for the rich to have a surrendered heart Paul says rich Christians should be rich in good works according to first Timothy 6 verses 17 to 19 charge them that are rich in this world that they be not high-minded nor trust in uncertain riches but in the Living God who giveth us richly all things to enjoy that they do good that they be rich in good works ready to distribute willing to communicate laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come that they may lay hold on eternal life on the poor side st. Paul's own writings to the Corinthians defends his testimony has an apostle and says he suffered much for Christ being whipped five times beaten with rods thrice but also in hunger and thirst in fastings often and in cold and nakedness Paul's ministry was not one in great wealth and physical comfort as he was left hungry and thirsty many times at the end of Paul's life he asked Timothy to bring his one cloak to him in prison when he came to see Paul and a cloak is a heavy coat used for protection against stormy weather according to the Greek 2nd Timothy 4:13 the cloak that I left at Troas with Karpis when thou comest bring with thee and the books but especially the parchments jesus' story of the rich man and beggar named Lazarus in Luke 16:19 231 shows how the Lord made one rich man and the other poor after death lazarus the poor man was saved in Abraham's bosom while the rich man was lost to the torments of Hell the story alludes to the fact that the rich man didn't believe and obey the Old Testament the law of Moses meaning that the poor man Lazarus did while in hell the rich man asked Abraham to send Lazarus back to the earth in a miraculous resurrection in order to convince his five brothers to serve God and avoid hell Abraham's answer is that America would not convince them the Moses was more than enough to convict his brothers and grant them salvation this story should remind us of Jesus's other words that the rich are hardly saved Matthew 19 23 then said Jesus unto his disciples verily I say unto you that a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of God this story also reminds us some scriptures are promises based upon probability like David's testimony that he'd never seen the righteous beggin bread in psalm 37:25 i have been young and now am old yet have i not seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging bread indeed david never saw the righteous begging bread but in jesus's story lazarus was righteous yet begging bread his righteousness despite his necessity to beg for food caused God to save his soul and take it to Abraham's bosom Lazarus overcame the temptations of being poor having to beg for food and yet was saved the rich man could not overcome the temptations that came along with riches and was lost number 4 God has ordained seasons of less and more for your life this reason is closely related to reason number 3 but is worth examining by itself over 3,000 years ago the Holy Ghost inspired Solomon to say that we'll go through seasons of life in which we have less money and more money Ecclesiastes chapter 3 verses 6 and 11 say this a time to get and a time to lose a time to keep and a time to cast away he hath made everything beautiful in his time also he has set the world in their heart so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end Ecclesiastes also says your human flesh and mind will never be satisfied with the amount of money you have so settle it in your heart now that no matter the season you're in you will always be content with what God has given you Ecclesiastes 5:10 he that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver nor he that loveth abundance with increase this is also vanity additionally Solomon says you have increased goods in order to feed your increasing family size which is a season of life please last YZ 511 when Goods increase their increase that eat them and what good is there to the owners there of saving the beholding of them with their eyes friends because we will likely go through seasons of gain and loss we should save money for the times of loss or less this is God's wisdom teaching us proverbs 6 verses 6 to 8 go to the ant thou sluggard consider her ways and be wise which having no guide overseer or ruler provided through me in the summer and gathereth her food in the harvest proverbs 21:5 the thoughts of the diligent tend only to plenteous nests but of everyone that is hasty only to want proverbs 21 23rd to be desired in oil in the dwelling of the wise but a foolish man spent ahthe it up be content since you know from God's Word that part of your testimony in life may be to lose rather than to gain there are seasons for both remember godliness with contentment is great gain part of your testimony and test of your faith may be to become poor like Joseph as a slave and prisoner but later he became rich as second-in-command under Pharaoh job was first rich then lost all his wealth and children but eventually God restored his wealth and multiplied children to him Paul when he was known as Saul and a Pharisee no doubt had all his needs met but as a Christian he was used mightily by Christ to spread the gospel but at times lacked food and drink remember at the end of his ministry he even lacked the ability to quickly get a coat and he had to ask Timothy to bring him his one coat as he sat in prison preparing for the cold winter months our duty is to love God in the midst of all trials because we know he holds our lives and future in his hands all things worked for good to them that love the Lord number five gambling is a demonic social sickness without a doubt gambling destroys millions of individuals and families gambling often leads to a generational curse this is because the sins of pride and covetousness are often unconfessed within families causing children to mimic the sinful habits of their parents Exodus 20 verse 5 says I the LORD thy God am a jealous God visiting the iniquity of the father's upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me gambling addiction seems to hurt the poor more than anyone else because they have no savings to fall back upon millions are addicted seeking a quick financial cure and ruin their lives through gambling second these demons maintain a strong influence in physical areas like homes towns and cities such as Las Vegas this principle is proven by Scripture as the Legion of demons Jesus cast out of the man in Ghaderi did not want to leave that area in mark 5 verse 10 it says and he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country friends if you're a parent you want to pass on the legacy of Christ and a holy godly Christian heritage like Timothy's mother and grandmother second Timothy 1 verses 4 to 6 and 2nd Timothy 3 verses 13 to 17 prove this principle Paul saw the unfeigned faith in Timothy but knew at first dwell in his grandmother Lois and mother Eunice Paul told Timothy to continue in the things which he had learned knowing of whom he had learned them from a child Timothy knew the Holy Scriptures thanks to the godly legacy of his mother and grandmother parents should model God's teaching to Moses in Deuteronomy 6 verses 4 to 9 as God told the Prophet Moses to diligently train the children in righteousness by their conversations and even home decorations and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house and when thou walkest by the way and when thou liest down and when thou risest up and thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes and thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house and on thy gates number 6 God values generosity in your stewardship of his money it's already been proven that God does not love the sin of covetousness or gambling but God loves a cheerful Giver as specifically taught in 2nd Corinthians 9:7 every man according as he hath purposed in his heart so let him give not grudgingly or of necessity for God loveth a cheerful Giver God wants us to cheerfully give in a variety of ways such as enticing offerings to our local churches according to 1st Corinthians 9 13 and 14 palms which are seeker gifts of charity to the poor according to Christ in Matthew 6 verses 1 to 4 and also in meeting people's basic needs according to Paul in Philippians 4:12 2:19 these cheerful givings are investments for eternity because they ultimately are done to God's glory and are actually done to Jesus himself Christ taught this in Matthew 25 verses 34 to 40 because jesus said the giving of clothes food drink and housing to the needy was the same as giving Jesus himself these gifts we must redeem our time according to Ephesians 5:15 by investing in eternal things you have one life to live then comes judgment or eternity there's no reduce you either invest in God's kingdom or in Satan's Kingdom gambling and games provide no eternal significance they are simply fantasy and Paul said not to be given over to tales or fantasy first Timothy 4:7 but refused profane and old wives fables and exercise thyself rather unto godliness use your creativity your freetime your mind your strength for good and not evil live for others not for yourself reject the selfish life and live a life that invests eternally in the things of God all we have is given to us by stewardship as Jesus's parables teach us Christians are generous stewards of the money God has allotted to them gambling is a tragic waste it's a failure of stewardship gambling often leads to loss which limits and erases one's ability to be generous as God called us to be in closing I hope you can see God's views on the evils of gambling and also his eternal wisdom about how to use money for his glory please contact me with any questions concerns or testimonies about this video god bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
