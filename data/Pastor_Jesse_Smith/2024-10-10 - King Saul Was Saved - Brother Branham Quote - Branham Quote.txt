TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and the group that call themselves fundamentalists are these two groups saved now I don't know I wouldn't know how to answer that now are these groups saved I don't know explain the difference between the spirit that's a different question now now are these two groups saved let me make that just a little bit more sensible to you and say I don't know I wouldn't know now remember here's my thoughts it may be wrong my thoughts is that if a Roman Catholic or whoever he might be Methodist Presbyterian Church of Christ Lutheran wherever he is if he believes on the Lord Jesus Christ and solemnly trusting him for his salvation I believe he's saved but you see the Roman Catholic Church doesn't do that they believe that the church saves them see their their salvation is in the church like this priest was put off the air here sometime ago for saying there's no other salvation only in the the church see the Roman church now that's wrong salvation is by Jesus Christ that's right not by the church but by Christ now if these Apostolic or apostolics and fundamentalists now call themselves I like a fundamentalist come to me sure some time ago and he said to me he said uh you kind of lean calvinistic don't you I said where's long as Calvin's in the Bible I'm with him as I go the Bible and Calvin stays in the Bible but he gets off the Bible and I just Bel only it could be the Bible he said well he said I want to say something to you you told I've heard you say that if a man was once saved that he could never be lost I said that's exactly what the scripture says has eternal life and shall never come into condemnation or judgment but already passed from Death to life I said I wasn't me said that that was Jesus Christ said that he said I want to ask you something that said do you believe that Saul was saved I said the Saul the U the King Saul he said yes well I said sure he said now remember he was a prophet I said correctly the Bible said he prophesied with the prophets he had a gift the prophecy he wasn't a prophet but he would had a gift of Prophecy because he's down there with the prophets when they were prophesying but um we know that Samuel was prophet in that day so but Saul was prophesying with the prophets he said then if he was a prophet then he was saved I said absolutely he said then I want to ask you something that I want to ask you something said and then you say Saul was saved and he the Bible said that the Lord departed from him and he become an enemy to God and he committed suicide and then saying he was saved I said and you're a fundamentalist I said brother you're just not reading it right that's all you're not reading what the scripture say he said well Saul could not be saved if he become an enemy of God I said Saul was saved oh he said I said he was a prophet he had to be saved see God saved him and God's not an Indian giver as we call it he don't well if God give you the Holy Ghost KN and he's going to lose you right down here what what a foolish thing it would be for him to give you the holy ghost in the first place you might impersonate the Holy Ghost and act like you got the Holy Ghost but if you've got the Holy Ghost God knows your beginning from the end that's right that's loose way to run business God don't run his life he he's infinite he know the end from the beginning and know every thing it ever be here every fly every night what ever be on the earth he knowed all about it before the world ever began so see what would he run his business like that far he doesn't do that if you want if you've really got the Holy Ghost you're saved eternally I can prove that through the scriptures and we have time after time but to conserve the time to get these questions I might say this you see that this fellow said well then what would you say say about Saul I said sure Saul was saved I said remember Saul backslid I'll admit that he backslid and went away from God because he was greedy he liked money he brought up all them sacrifices and things when Samuel through the word of God told him to destroy everything but he even saved the king and he saved a lot of stuff and brought up because see instead of following the word of God just exactly like it says you put your own opinion in it that's where you back slide that's what I think about denominations and things they backslide because they don't follow the word and you show them the word they turn their back from and say well our church teaches this that's not right it's What God Says and Samuel was commissioned to go down there and or Saul was and Destroy Everything utterly everything destroy it all instead of doing that he saved some for sacrifice and he spared the King's life and he done everything and Samuel walked out to him and told him the spirit of God had departed from him and and all like that and Samuel died and about 2 years later well then Saul had got the spirit of God departed from him but he wasn't lost amen sure he wasn't the anointing went off of him now watch and see if it was now Saul got so far away from God to when he went to the battle he started to go to battle and he was worried about going to battle and he he asked the Lord for a dream the Lord wouldn't give him a dream there was no prophets in the land in that day no prophets Samuel was a prophet they had prophesizes but so forth but they he couldn't get an answer from God no he he went down to the urum Thunder and asked there and the Flash of the Lightnings upon the urum Thunder wasn't even answering and what did he do he crawled off into a cave where there was a witch a fortune teller and this witch he disguised himself like a footman and went down there and he said would you divine unto me the spirit of Samuel the prophet and she said um she said well now you know what Saul it said she was talking to Saul but she didn't know it said Saul said all got familiar spirits he must be killed he said I'll protect you from Saul but Divine unto me the spirit of Samuel so the witch went into her enchantments and first thing you know when she seen Samuel raise up the spirit of him coming materializing in front of him she said I see Gods rise from the earth that's one of the consolations look at Old Samuel standing there he' been dead two years but there he stood am not only he stand there with his Prophet robe on Not only was he still alive but he was still a prophet amen hallelujah she said you've deceived me to the pro and Saul said Samuel I don't know what to do I'm going to battle tomorrow and the spirit's gone from me and said I can't even get a Dream from the Lord and the you're Thunder won't speak to me I'm in a terrible shape he said seeing you become an enemy of God said why have you called me out of my rest see Samuel said that so why did you call me from my rest seeing that you become an enemy to God and then he went ahead and told him he said but however he had tell him the word of the Lord and when he did I remember he had been dead two years see but he said I'll tell you the word he told him the word of the Lord said tomorrow you're going to fall in the battle Jonathan your son is going to fall with you and he said by this time tomorrow night you will be with me all right if he was lost so was Samuel the prophet that's fundamental is what soal see see he said you will be with me tomorrow night but this time Hallelujah see then if Saul was lost so was Samuel because it's both in the same place no no fundamentalist you fundamentalist socalled like Church of Christ socalled and Christian so-called Christianity so-called today because you're an American you're supposed to be a Christian because you're you're an American see that that's socalled Christianity but a real Christian is a born again man of the spirit Born Again woman of the spirit that's really these others are impersonating but real Christians are called of God
