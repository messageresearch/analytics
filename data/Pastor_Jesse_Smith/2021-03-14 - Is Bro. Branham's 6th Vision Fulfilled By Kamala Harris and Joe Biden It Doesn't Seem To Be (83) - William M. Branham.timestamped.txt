[0:08] greetings friends
[0:09] in the matchless name of the lord jesus
[0:11] christ
[0:12] is brother branham's sixth vision
[0:14] fulfilled maybe
[0:16] but it's my personal opinion that it's
[0:18] not fulfilled
[0:20] two months ago after the united states
[0:22] presidential
[0:23] inauguration i was asked if i thought
[0:26] kamal harris was the fulfillment of
[0:28] brother branham's
[0:29] sixth vision my reply has always been
[0:32] it's possible
[0:34] but i personally don't think so based
[0:35] upon numerous quotes
[0:37] from brother branham numerous preachers
[0:39] have
[0:40] said the prophecy is fulfilled but those
[0:43] are all opinions
[0:44] as far as i can tell before getting into
[0:46] the specific reasons why
[0:48] i want to thank everyone for their
[0:49] supportive comments their likes their
[0:51] comments

[1:23] lord willing in june of this year my
[1:25] second book will be released
[1:27] it's about the mysteries of god that
[1:29] brother branham
[1:30] was used by god to finish
[1:33] now back to this video's topic a few
[1:36] christian brothers shared
[1:37] perry stone's video with me on the same
[1:40] subject
[1:41] of brother branham six vision and i
[1:44] agree with mr stone that it's possible
[1:46] the sixth vision
[1:47] is fulfilled but like him i'm not able
[1:49] to say so for sure
[1:51] also i don't watch stone sermons nor do
[1:54] i follow his ministry
[1:56] but i have noticed over the years that
[1:58] he often references brother adam's seven
[2:00] major visions
[2:02] let's review brother and seven major
[2:04] visions from 1933
[2:06] and then i'll explain why i don't
[2:07] believe the sixth vision is fulfilled
[2:09] yet
[2:11] this summary comes from brother
[2:12] branham's book and exposition of the
[2:14] seven church ages
[2:15] and of course i believe brother branham
[2:17] was a genuine prophet of god
[2:19] he was the seventh church age messenger
[2:21] of revelation 3 verses
[2:23] 7 through 22. he fulfilled revelation 10
[2:26] verse 7.
[2:28] he was a son of man revealing the son of
[2:30] man
[2:31] according to luke 17 30. he was also the
[2:34] elijah prophet
[2:36] jesus spoke of in matthew 17 11.
[2:39] the elijah prophet of malachi 4 5 and 6
[2:43] and the ministry of restitution spoken
[2:45] of in acts
[2:46] 3 verses 20 and 21.
[2:50] the first vision was mussolini's
[2:52] invasion of ethiopia
[2:54] and the horrible end of his life and
[2:56] note that he died on april 28
[2:59] 1945. the second vision was hitler's
[3:02] rise
[3:03] during world war ii the siegfried line
[3:06] and also
[3:07] hitler's mysterious end of life and he
[3:10] died two days after mussolini
[3:12] on april 30th 1945.
[3:16] the third vision was the rise of fascism
[3:18] nazism
[3:19] and communism with the first two
[3:21] swallowed up by the third
[3:24] also an admonishment to watch russia the
[3:26] king of the north
[3:28] fourth a plastic bubble topped car
[3:30] running by remote control with a
[3:32] steering wheel
[3:33] running down beautiful highways and
[3:35] people inside playing a game
[3:37] to amuse themselves the fifth vision was
[3:40] the moral plight of the world
[3:42] centered on women who cut their hair and
[3:44] wore men's clothing
[3:45] eventually going into a state of undress
[3:48] the last picture brother ram saw was a
[3:49] woman naked except for a little
[3:52] fig leaf type apron
[3:55] the sixth vision was the rising of a
[3:57] beautiful but cruel woman in the united
[3:58] states
[3:59] who held the people in her complete
[4:01] power brother branham said it was either
[4:03] the roman catholic church or a woman
[4:05] voted in
[4:06] by mainly the woman's vote
[4:11] the seventh vision was a terrible
[4:12] explosion and nothing left but debris
[4:14] craters and smoke
[4:16] all over america notice some details
[4:19] brother and gives on his tape
[4:21] sermons about the seven major visions
[4:24] change
[4:24] over the course of the final years of
[4:26] his life the reason for this in my
[4:28] opinion
[4:29] is that it seems brother branham did not
[4:30] have the original wording of his seven
[4:32] major visions
[4:33] since he did not have tape recorders
[4:35] when the original prophecy was spoken
[4:38] in 1933 nor were there educated scribes
[4:41] sitting in his church
[4:43] ready to write down every inspired word
[4:45] on that blessed sunday morning in 1933
[4:48] so it seems over the course of decades
[4:50] following brother branham was trying his
[4:52] best to remember all the details
[4:54] of the seven major visions prophecies
[4:57] brother branham lived a much more rugged
[4:59] life compared to how his
[5:01] skeptics live today some of whom
[5:03] probably live pampered lives
[5:05] in comparison to the missionary and
[5:08] evangelistic life
[5:09] of brother branham brother ram did have
[5:12] vacations of course but otherwise was
[5:14] constantly traveling preaching
[5:16] praying for the sick pouring out every
[5:18] ounce of his physical strength for the
[5:20] sick and needy
[5:21] and in and out of visions on a daily
[5:23] basis which also
[5:24] drained his strength today brother
[5:27] branham's critics
[5:28] attack him for what seems like changes
[5:30] in the prophecies
[5:31] but i believe they're wrong it's obvious
[5:34] brother branham was trying his best to
[5:35] recall the details of the visions
[5:37] and as usual brother ranu's critics are
[5:40] jumping to false conclusions
[5:42] to their own folly here's three reasons
[5:45] why i don't think
[5:46] kamala harris and joe biden are the
[5:48] fulfillment of the sixth vision
[5:51] reason number one a couple details about
[5:54] the sixth vision do not seem to have
[5:56] come to pass
[5:58] i do recognize mrs harris wore purple
[6:00] for the inauguration as one quote
[6:05] and said i says a great woman stand up
[6:07] beautiful
[6:08] looking dressed in real highly royal
[6:11] black purple
[6:12] and i got little princess down here she
[6:14] was a great ruler in the united states
[6:16] perhaps the catholic church
[6:19] a woman is some woman i don't know it'll
[6:21] be the catholic church
[6:23] i don't know i can't say the only thing
[6:24] i've seen i've seen the woman that was
[6:26] all
[6:28] but there were more details brother and
[6:29] gave about that vision
[6:32] first he said the woman was beautiful
[6:34] and many don't think
[6:35] mrs harris is beautiful second the woman
[6:39] would be cruel and hold the nation in
[6:42] her complete power
[6:43] mrs harris certainly seems to be cruel
[6:46] as she strongly supports
[6:47] planned parenthood and abortions
[6:50] but she doesn't have complete power and
[6:53] the nation has not yet bowed to her
[6:55] as other quotes from brother branham say
[6:58] well over 100 million americans do not
[7:00] even consider her a legitimate
[7:02] vice president and certainly have not
[7:04] agreed to worship and
[7:06] bow to her nor obey her
[7:09] here are brother m's quotes about these
[7:11] subjects
[7:12] 13 stars everything's the 13.
[7:16] everything is a woman and remember thus
[7:18] saith the lord
[7:20] there'll be a woman rule before the end
[7:22] time
[7:23] she'll either be president vice
[7:25] president or it'll be the catholic
[7:26] church as a woman
[7:28] i'll see our great woman a nation bowed
[7:30] to her
[7:31] it'll be one before the end time thus
[7:33] saith the lord
[7:34] write it down and find out your young
[7:36] people see if it happens
[7:38] if it isn't i'm a false prophet
[7:42] then in the sixth vision there arose up
[7:44] in america a most beautiful but cruel
[7:46] woman
[7:47] she held the people in her complete
[7:49] power
[7:50] i believe that this was the rise of the
[7:52] roman catholic church
[7:54] though i knew it could possibly be a
[7:55] vision of some woman rising in great
[7:57] power in
[7:58] america due to a popular vote by women
[8:02] friends notice brother branham says the
[8:04] exact words
[8:05] shall either be or these words show the
[8:09] interpretation was not certain
[8:11] so we must be careful not to interpret
[8:13] the visions ourselves
[8:15] in the church age book brother branham
[8:17] used the words i believed
[8:19] not god told me that this was the rise
[8:22] of the roman catholic church though i
[8:23] knew
[8:24] it could possibly be not god told me it
[8:27] was
[8:29] his interpretation was vague because he
[8:30] did not have thus saith the lord
[8:32] on the exact interpretation but some
[8:35] people today think they have
[8:36] the exact interpretation additionally to
[8:39] me
[8:40] it seems more likely the beautiful woman
[8:42] is the roman catholic church
[8:44] as revelation chapter 17 verses 1
[8:46] through 7
[8:47] describes her as a beautiful church some
[8:50] say the sixth vision is fulfilled
[8:52] by all three of the following because of
[8:54] the quote from that time
[8:56] in 1960 biden is the president
[9:00] harris is the vice president and the
[9:02] roman catholic church
[9:04] again this is possible but i think
[9:06] that's an opinion
[9:07] recall brother branham's own
[9:08] interpretations of the fourth fifth
[9:10] and sixth visions were vague on purpose
[9:14] which is so different than the first
[9:15] three visions because brother branham
[9:17] didn't have the divine interpretation
[9:19] of the fourth fifth and sixth visions as
[9:22] he used the words
[9:23] or could be or might or i don't know
[9:28] reason number two some of brother
[9:30] branham's own words
[9:32] make it sound like the fourth vision is
[9:34] not yet fulfilled
[9:35] as it's in the process of coming to pass
[9:38] if the fourth vision isn't completed
[9:40] then it's likely the fifth
[9:42] and sixth vision aren't fulfilled either
[9:45] looking at some of brother graham's
[9:47] descriptions of the driverless cars
[9:48] capabilities
[9:50] we understand they have not yet been
[9:52] realized such as the elimination of car
[9:54] accidents
[9:55] due to remote control brother branham
[9:58] said when the vision was fulfilled
[10:00] he said the cars couldn't hit another
[10:02] car because of remote control
[10:05] and also said that cars would keep
[10:07] getting more like an egg
[10:08] until the last day shape of an aide i
[10:11] said it will come to pass
[10:12] that those cars will not be run by a
[10:14] steering wheel it will be something
[10:16] other run it's that
[10:17] cars you're bringing out right now
[10:18] remote control for safety
[10:22] correct you won't be able to enter into
[10:23] a city any 20 mile zone you just go 20
[10:26] miles you can't hit another
[10:27] car because it's remote control see it's
[10:29] going like that
[10:30] right now but at other times brother
[10:34] branham made it sound like
[10:35] five out of the seven visions were
[10:37] fulfilled so we have brother brahms two
[10:39] different opinions
[10:40] on these subjects this is why i humbly
[10:43] believe the fourth vision
[10:45] isn't completely fulfilled yet it's
[10:47] still in the process of coming to pass
[10:49] here are the quotes i said such progress
[10:53] will take place
[10:55] i said see automobiles looking like an
[10:57] egg going down the street
[10:59] as cars down highways with some kind of
[11:01] a control they don't have to guide it
[11:03] i see an american family playing checker
[11:05] in the back of a car
[11:07] they've got the car right now they just
[11:08] had the highways to put it on
[11:11] the little volkswagen's a perfect game
[11:13] just exactly
[11:14] and it's uh all the other cars could you
[11:16] imagine 19 and 33 what the cars look
[11:18] like
[11:19] to now now let me say this
[11:23] can anyone prove any of those visions
[11:25] wrong were they not all fulfilled
[11:28] yes each one has been fulfilled or is in
[11:30] the process right now
[11:32] mussolini invaded ethiopia successfully
[11:34] then fell and lost it all
[11:37] hitler started a war he could not finish
[11:39] and died mysteriously
[11:41] communism took over both the other two
[11:43] isms
[11:44] the plastic bottle car has been built
[11:46] and is awaiting only a better network of
[11:48] roads
[11:49] women are all but naked and are even now
[11:51] wearing topless bathing suits
[11:53] and just the other day i saw in a
[11:55] magazine the very dress that i saw in my
[11:57] vision
[11:58] if you can call it a dress it was a
[12:00] plastic transparent type of cloth with
[12:02] three darkened spots that covered both
[12:04] breasts in a small area
[12:06] and then there was a dark place like a
[12:08] small apron below
[12:10] the catholic church is on the rise we've
[12:12] had one catholic president and will no
[12:14] doubt have another
[12:17] from my understanding of brother
[12:19] branham's quote it seems we're still
[12:21] waiting on both the driverless cars and
[12:24] the beautiful highways or road
[12:26] systems notice in this quote the
[12:28] driverless car was coming on the scene
[12:31] but was not yet on the scene and it is
[12:34] still not on the scene today in 2021
[12:37] as far as we've witnessed now
[12:41] that brings us into the election of
[12:43] president kennedy
[12:44] and this car coming on the on the scene
[12:46] bringing five
[12:47] things out of the seven that has
[12:49] happened exactly
[12:53] reason number three regarding the fifth
[12:55] vision it seems the fifth vision
[12:57] is in the process of coming to pass as
[12:59] well brother branham saw the little fig
[13:01] leaf dress
[13:02] in a magazine that he'd seen in his
[13:04] vision
[13:05] moving him to say the vision was
[13:07] fulfilled but to me it seems this vision
[13:10] is still in the process of coming to
[13:11] pass
[13:11] as well because women on a national
[13:14] scale
[13:15] have not yet entered the state of
[13:17] undress as he called it
[13:20] the fifth vision had to do with the
[13:21] moral problem of our age
[13:23] centering mostly around women god showed
[13:26] me that women began to be out of their
[13:28] place with the granting of the vote
[13:30] then they cut off their hair which
[13:33] signified that they were no longer under
[13:35] the authority of a man
[13:36] but insisted on either equal rights or
[13:38] in most cases more than equal rights
[13:41] she adopted men's clothing and went into
[13:43] a state of undress
[13:44] until the last picture i saw was a woman
[13:47] naked except for a little fig leaf type
[13:49] apron
[13:50] with this vision i saw the terrible
[13:52] perversion and moral plight of the whole
[13:54] world
[13:57] certainly the popularity of leggings
[13:59] shows the state of dress is moving in
[14:01] the direction of undress
[14:03] but it doesn't seem the women have
[14:05] reached the level of immodesty or
[14:07] undress brother branham saw in the
[14:09] vision
[14:10] i believe god's fulfillment of each
[14:12] vision will be so incredibly obvious
[14:14] that it will be undeniable
[14:16] just as the first three the whole world
[14:18] had to recognize
[14:20] mussolini's death and hitler's death and
[14:22] the rise
[14:23] of communism during and following world
[14:26] war ii
[14:28] as for the fifth vision believers i've
[14:30] talked to have never seen a woman dress
[14:32] in a little fig leaf dress style which
[14:35] we are thankful for in one way
[14:37] but according to prophecy it's coming to
[14:39] pass in the future
[14:41] so it seems the fifth vision is in the
[14:43] process of coming to pass as well
[14:47] being careful discerning between the
[14:48] human side versus the prophetic side
[14:52] in the second half of this video i want
[14:54] to remind my friends that brother
[14:55] branham taught us to be very careful
[14:57] when deciding if his words were his
[14:59] human thoughts
[15:00] or if they were god's thoughts you hear
[15:02] him say this and he cares to you care
[15:05] 1963 when asked if his previous
[15:08] prediction about martin luther king jr
[15:11] leading millions into a death trap was a
[15:13] prophecy or not
[15:15] note brother branham had publicly stated
[15:17] on three occasions
[15:19] oh lord just once more the third exodus
[15:22] and the indictment
[15:23] that millions of african-americans would
[15:25] die by martin luther king jr leading
[15:28] them into a death trap
[15:29] when asked whether his prediction that
[15:31] millions would die was from the lord
[15:33] he plainly said no that's just my
[15:36] opinion
[15:37] here's brother adam's did you prophesy
[15:41] that there be a million negroes uh
[15:44] killed on the or
[15:47] did you just announce that there would
[15:51] be
[15:51] this happening now
[15:55] see i've always asked you to be careful
[15:58] what you're listening to i think there's
[16:01] so much of it that
[16:03] it's just the human side but always
[16:06] if there is something that goes forth it
[16:09] will speak it it's thus
[16:11] saith the lord even to visions or
[16:14] anything
[16:17] no i just was talking about martin
[16:20] luther king
[16:22] on this great disaster that they're
[16:24] having in the south with the
[16:26] the colored people i said if
[16:30] those people were slaves i'd
[16:33] take my church and go south to help them
[16:35] people out of slavery
[16:37] i sure would because man makes slaves
[16:41] not god
[16:44] it's inspired of the wrong thing you see
[16:47] see they them people and that's reason i
[16:50] see that
[16:51] not that there is any uh any prophecy
[16:54] concerning it i have nothing on it from
[16:56] the lord
[16:57] and being sure now if i say anything
[16:59] from the lord
[17:00] like that to tell you it's always i'm
[17:02] speaking now
[17:04] but when he speaks i say it's not me
[17:06] it's thus saith the lord
[17:07] and i can't say it until he tells me i
[17:10] could be altogether wrong
[17:11] in my thought about martin luther king i
[17:14] don't know
[17:14] i can't say that's just my opinion
[17:18] based upon this quote friends notice
[17:20] that the fulfillment of the fourth
[17:22] fifth sixth and seventh visions were
[17:24] never pronounced by brother branham as
[17:26] being fulfilled
[17:27] with thus saith the lord brother branham
[17:30] only said they were
[17:31] genuine prophecies that would come to
[17:33] pass with us saith the lord
[17:35] additionally it's easy to see from the
[17:37] numerous quotes we've already showed
[17:39] that brother branham recognized we were
[17:41] still waiting on certain conditions
[17:43] in order for the visions to be fulfilled
[17:46] let me share a clear example of how
[17:48] important it is to discern between the
[17:50] human side
[17:51] and the prophetic side of brother
[17:53] branham as it can be
[17:54] literally one breath away in 1965
[17:57] brother branham said with thus
[17:59] saith the lord that a woman is
[18:00] spiritually dead if she cuts off her
[18:02] hair
[18:03] yet dances sings in the choir speaks in
[18:06] tongues
[18:07] runs and joins aid societies
[18:10] this is true as both jesus and paul
[18:12] taught false christs
[18:14] or religious people who only get
[18:16] temporarily anointed by the holy spirit
[18:18] later live a life of iniquity and are
[18:21] not born again
[18:24] they are dead in their souls having
[18:25] never received the quickening life of
[18:27] the baptism of the holy ghost
[18:30] now listen to brother branham pronounce
[18:31] this truth in the authority of thus
[18:33] saith the lord
[18:34] but in the next breath he references the
[18:37] wrong scripture
[18:38] saying first corinthians 14 but the
[18:40] chapter on hair length
[18:42] is first corinthians 11.
[18:46] if she cuts it off i don't care how much
[18:48] she dances
[18:49] sings in the choir speaks in tongues
[18:51] runs up and down
[18:52] or has all kind of aids society she's
[18:55] dead
[18:58] that's thus saith the lord
[19:02] the word of god first corinthians 14.
[19:08] amen she denied her nazarite
[19:12] bow and sold out to the god of this
[19:15] modern age
[19:18] she doesn't i'll shame on you lady
[19:22] or woman if you listen to this quote in
[19:26] context from
[19:27] the god of this evil age brother branham
[19:30] is talking about a woman's hair as a
[19:31] nazarite vow
[19:33] his overall topic was not speaking in
[19:35] tongues
[19:36] which first corinthians 14 fully covers
[19:39] the scriptural authority for a woman
[19:41] cutting her hair and being spiritually
[19:43] dead
[19:43] is in first corinthians 11 verses 5 and
[19:46] 6
[19:47] and verses 13 through 15. those
[19:50] scriptures say it's a dishonor and a
[19:52] shame
[19:53] or a disgrace vile reproach according to
[19:56] the greek lexicon
[19:58] for a woman to cut her hair for she
[20:00] dishonors her husband and eventually
[20:02] christ
[20:03] and eventually god so again
[20:06] our conclusion is exactly what brother
[20:08] branham said be careful what you're
[20:09] listening to
[20:10] because there's so much of it it's just
[20:13] the human side
[20:15] we should be careful before saying the
[20:17] fourth fifth and sixth visions are
[20:19] already fulfilled
[20:20] i believe this is why brother branham
[20:22] said a preacher who can rightly divide
[20:24] the word of truth
[20:25] is the most important thing today along
[20:28] with brother branham's martin luther
[20:29] king jr opinion
[20:31] i want to show a few other topics he
[20:33] gave his opinion on
[20:34] and time has showed us his statements
[20:36] were simply his human opinions
[20:39] second 1977 brother brandon's prediction
[20:43] about the earth's total annihilation
[20:44] before
[20:45] 1977 has proven to be his own human
[20:48] opinion
[20:49] and not a thus saith the lord
[20:52] but between 9 77 i predict
[20:56] that either a great destruction or total
[20:58] annihilation
[20:59] of the entire earth between now and 77
[21:03] i predicted it in 1933
[21:08] and it'll a great woman will rise up and
[21:10] be president or something like that
[21:12] in the nation and then there will come a
[21:14] total annihilation
[21:16] the entire nation will be wiped out and
[21:18] that
[21:19] i predict now this is not the lord
[21:21] saying this the other about the woman in
[21:23] his is the lord
[21:24] but i predicted in 19 and
[21:27] 30 33 that the world would be
[21:31] total annihilation before 77.
[21:34] so i didn't know that they had something
[21:37] that could annihilate it like they got
[21:38] now but i
[21:39] seen the nation in total annihilation
[21:42] just
[21:43] stumps and trees and things like that
[21:45] that so
[21:46] it's on its road
[21:49] and at 1906 the lady was seeing church
[21:52] aid set in
[21:54] and i don't know where to land
[21:58] but i predict it will be done by 1977.
[22:02] i predict not the lord told me but i
[22:06] predicted according to a vision that
[22:07] would show me
[22:08] some uh years ago that five of those
[22:11] things says
[22:12] oh the seven has already taken place
[22:14] about
[22:17] according to history there has never
[22:19] been a democracy at any time
[22:21] last over 200 years that was 1776
[22:25] july the 4th and we're
[22:28] just 11 years left
[22:31] will it make it no
[22:35] camp 11 years if it does it'll break all
[22:39] history
[22:42] because jesus did not say no man could
[22:44] know the year
[22:45] month or week in which his coming was to
[22:47] be completed
[22:49] so i repeat i sincerely believe and
[22:52] maintain as a private student of the
[22:53] word
[22:54] along with divine inspiration that 1977
[22:58] ought to terminate the world systems and
[23:00] usher in the millennium
[23:03] third brother branham said there would
[23:04] be no generation after his generation
[23:07] in 1958 and 1965.
[23:11] brother branham twice said we can't have
[23:13] another generation and
[23:15] we can't go another generation obviously
[23:18] these statements were just his opinions
[23:20] if they were based upon his
[23:22] understanding that a generation is 40
[23:24] years
[23:25] but these statements were never spoken
[23:27] with thus saith the lord
[23:28] so they were his opinions and brother
[23:30] branham is still
[23:31] a genuine prophet of
[23:35] abstain from god whole thing you don't
[23:36] have to make yourself moderate you make
[23:38] alcoholics when you do that
[23:42] oh we'll let her do this and let him do
[23:44] this and so forth like
[23:45] what can you expect we can't go another
[23:48] generation
[23:50] we can't do it
[23:53] we're at the end
[23:57] look at this teenage insane
[24:00] well we had a i told you the other day
[24:02] they've taken analysis there of the
[24:04] schools in arizona where i live
[24:06] and 80 percent of the children in school
[24:09] is mentally
[24:13] what will their children be we can't
[24:16] have another generation
[24:18] we're at the end jesus said these things
[24:21] would come
[24:24] but the word said that they'd be there
[24:26] 70 years that generation
[24:28] faded away 40 years as a generation
[24:32] this is almost two generations you're
[24:34] gonna be out hunter
[24:37] fourth brother branham said matthew 24
[24:39] would be fulfilled
[24:41] and his generation would see the coming
[24:43] of the lord in the church age book
[24:46] this quote is closely related to the
[24:47] third opinion but here in the church age
[24:50] book brother branham said matthew 24
[24:52] would be fulfilled in his generation
[24:54] since the pope visited jerusalem for the
[24:56] first time
[24:58] again if a generation is 40 years as
[25:00] brother branham repeatedly taught
[25:02] then a generation has come and gone and
[25:04] yet there is more to be fulfilled in
[25:06] matthew 24
[25:07] such as the rapture in verses 40 and 41.
[25:12] matthew 24 mentions signs in the heavens
[25:15] concerning this last day just before
[25:17] jesus comes
[25:18] i wonder if you noticed such a sign
[25:20] recently
[25:22] christ was now outside the church here
[25:25] is the sign in the sky
[25:27] the last eclipse of the moon was a total
[25:29] eclipse
[25:30] it waned to a total darkness in seven
[25:32] stages
[25:34] in the seventh stage the total darkness
[25:36] came as the pope of rome
[25:37] paul vi went to palestine to make a holy
[25:40] tour of jerusalem
[25:42] he was the first pope to ever go to
[25:44] jerusalem the pope is named paul vi
[25:47] paul was the first messenger and this
[25:49] man goes by that name
[25:51] notice it is the sixth or the number of
[25:53] men
[25:54] this is more than a coincidence and when
[25:57] he went to jerusalem the moon or the
[25:59] church went into total darkness
[26:01] this is it this is the end this
[26:04] generation shall not pass away until all
[26:06] be fulfilled
[26:08] even so lord jesus come quickly
[26:13] in closing i trust you can understand
[26:15] how we must be very careful
[26:17] how we interpret brother branham's
[26:19] visions and also all the visions in the
[26:21] word of god
[26:22] and friends i'm open to correction if
[26:25] i'm wrong on anything
[26:26] please contact me if i miss something
[26:28] regarding brother branham's seven major
[26:30] visions
[26:31] i'll end the video with brother
[26:33] branham's quote from questions and
[26:34] answers on the seals
[26:36] in which he urges his followers to be
[26:38] real humble
[26:39] and just be real real solid now
[26:42] that's what message believers should be
[26:44] solid not flighty
[26:46] and not quickly jumping to conclusions
[26:49] and adding their own interpretations to
[26:51] things
[26:53] don't try to put any interpretation but
[26:55] just believe me as your brother
