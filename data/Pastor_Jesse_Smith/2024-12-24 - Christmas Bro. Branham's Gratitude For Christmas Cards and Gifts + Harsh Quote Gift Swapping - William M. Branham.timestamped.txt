[0:00] [Music]
[0:02] I want to take this time to express to
[0:06] each and every one of you how grateful I
[0:09] am to you for your Christmas cards and
[0:12] gifts and things that was received at
[0:15] our house amen I certainly thank you
[0:18] with all my heart and I don't have words
[0:21] to express to you what I how I
[0:24] appreciate every one of them and may the
[0:28] god of Heaven bless you you richly is my
[0:32] prayer greetings friends in the
[0:34] matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[0:37] the purpose of this videoos to show
[0:38] quotes from God's Prophet brother
[0:40] brandham about his receiving of
[0:42] Christmas gifts and also his giving of
[0:45] Christmas gifts recently I received a
[0:47] text about the topic of Christmas and it
[0:49] made me think of these quotes so I
[0:50] thought I'd share them here by the grace
[0:51] of God hi friends I'm Jesse Smith pastor
[0:54] bride of Christ Fellowship here in akan
[0:55] Ohio USA and I defend the original
[0:57] Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ that he
[0:59] revealed to St Paul and then had a
[1:01] restore through Martin Luther John
[1:02] Wesley and the late Prophet brother
[1:04] William Marian brandham who lived from
[1:05] 1909 to
[1:07] 1965 and I also defend brother Ram's
[1:09] Godly Christian character I would say in
[1:11] this video I'm defending brother Ram's
[1:12] Godly Christian character I'm aware
[1:14] there's quotes on both sides of this
[1:16] topic there's numerous quotes where
[1:17] brother brandom is against gift giving
[1:20] but in this video I'm going to show the
[1:21] quotes where brother brandom was
[1:22] positive about gift giving and brother
[1:24] Brandon was thankful for gifts a lot of
[1:26] the quotes from this video came from my
[1:27] 2018 sermon I preached on how we worship
[1:30] at Christmas time so I'll leave a link
[1:33] to that sermon in the
[1:34] description also I did a video last year
[1:37] about four reasons I don't have a
[1:38] Christmas tree so I'll leave a link to
[1:41] that in the description as well I do
[1:43] give my children three gifts a piece
[1:45] though they get a book they get a
[1:47] clothing item and they get a toy of
[1:49] course my older ones don't get toys now
[1:51] they probably get gift cards or
[1:52] something like that now the Bible
[1:54] foundation for how we worship at
[1:56] Christmas is from Colossians 2:16 and 17
[1:58] and Romans 1413
[2:00] Colossians 2:16 And1 17 says let no man
[2:03] therefore judge you in meat or in drink
[2:04] or in respect of an holy day or of the
[2:07] new moon or of the Sabbath days which
[2:10] are a shadow of things to come but the
[2:11] body is
[2:13] Christ so here Paul gives the Colossians
[2:16] the right to not let someone judge them
[2:18] for how they worship on a holy day so
[2:21] that's what Christmas is for us it's a
[2:23] holy day we always have church on
[2:25] Christmas if it falls on a Sunday or
[2:27] Wednesday so at Christmas time we never
[2:30] cancel services in fact when Christmas
[2:33] doesn't fall on a Wednesday or Sunday we
[2:35] usually add a Christmas service so we
[2:37] have more worship of the Lord Jesus
[2:39] Christ during this holiday season so
[2:42] from Colossians 2:16 and 17 we see the
[2:44] Liberty that we have to worship any day
[2:47] that we call a holy day we consider a
[2:49] holy day Romans 14:13 said let us not
[2:52] therefore judge one another anymore but
[2:54] judge this rather that no man put a
[2:55] stumbling block or an occasion to fall
[2:57] in his brother's way so we get two
[2:59] lessons here we have the Liberty to
[3:01] worship on a holy day the way we want
[3:04] the way we're convicted by the Holy
[3:05] Spirit but we must stumble no man or
[3:08] woman so my life personally no one's
[3:10] ever told me that I've stumbled them
[3:12] because I give my children three gifts a
[3:14] peace and again I don't have a Christmas
[3:15] tree so I feel I can Worship the Lord in
[3:19] a pleasing way during this holiday
[3:20] season by the grace of God so now we'll
[3:23] go through six quotes about
[3:25] giftgiving then we'll look at a very
[3:27] harsh quote from Brother brandom about
[3:29] gift giving but also look at before and
[3:31] after quotes from the same sermon and
[3:33] then we'll look at brother R's final
[3:34] quote about receiving gifts in December
[3:38] 1965 okay so let's look at six quotes
[3:41] about gift giving the first one's 1951
[3:43] brother brand was saying his first wife
[3:45] hope went over the river to get the
[3:46] Kitty's Christmas presents so I don't
[3:48] know if brother random bought Christmas
[3:50] gifts every year for his children but
[3:52] here he did at this point so before the
[3:54] Ohio River flood of 1936 or 1937 I can't
[3:57] remember which one brother R's first
[3:59] wife hope would go across the river to
[4:02] buy things for their kids for Christmas
[4:04] because brother R was at work let's
[4:06] listen to the quote little old brother
[4:08] George the night come I remember it just
[4:11] day before Christmas wife went over the
[4:13] river to get the Kitty's Christmas
[4:14] present and then I remember the flood
[4:17] came along and she went over the river
[4:19] to get some things for the kitties for
[4:21] Christmas and I was working 3 years
[4:23] later in 1954 brother Ram said his
[4:26] church provided gifts for the children
[4:28] but they gave the gift after the sacred
[4:30] part of the service that must be the
[4:32] preaching part must be the sacred part
[4:34] and brother Ram said they gave boxes of
[4:36] candy oranges to the children let's
[4:38] listen to the quote I'm sorry I kept you
[4:41] late now the little children has a
[4:43] Sunday school Retreat here just in a
[4:45] minute they got all boxes of candy and
[4:48] oranges and a sack full of stuff over
[4:49] here for the little ones as soon as we
[4:51] get done with the sacred part of the
[4:52] service just in a minute 5 years later
[4:55] in 1959 brother brand said he would like
[4:57] to send a Christmas present to everyone
[4:59] but can because he's a minister and that
[5:01] would be too many people to send gifts
[5:03] to notice brother Ram said he
[5:05] appreciated all the cards and the gifts
[5:07] that he was given his wife and the
[5:09] children appreciated it and send their
[5:11] thanks but again I want to point out
[5:13] 1959 brother brand wished he was able to
[5:16] send everyone a Christmas present let's
[5:18] listen to the quote now as brother
[5:20] Neville has said and so do I want to
[5:24] thank each one of you for the membrance
[5:26] of Christmas your card brother and
[5:29] sisters fans here got yours and all the
[5:31] different ones here that sent me your
[5:32] cards around I do appreciate them and
[5:36] the gifts and things that you sent we
[5:38] certainly do appreciate it from my wife
[5:41] and I and we the children we thank you
[5:45] we would like to be able to send a
[5:48] Christmas present to
[5:50] everyone but that sure be a hard thing
[5:52] for a preacher to do it or maybe around
[5:56] as many as there is to go to I just
[5:59] wouldn't be able to do it you see I just
[6:02] but I wish I could even get the kitties
[6:04] everyone something I'd sure like to do
[6:06] it but it's not this ministers can't do
[6:09] that there's just too many to go by but
[6:13] we are all I'm sure myself and others to
[6:16] that we appreciate our congregations one
[6:19] of the greatest things that I think that
[6:21] you've done is your love and your
[6:24] undying faith that you have placed in me
[6:27] as your one of your pastors year and
[6:30] this year the next year 1960 brother
[6:34] Rand again takes time to express his
[6:36] gratitude for all the Christmas cards
[6:38] and gifts and he thanked them with all
[6:40] of his heart brother Ram said they had a
[6:42] Christmas tree in their house because
[6:45] Joseph wanted one and he had several
[6:48] gifts under his tree that he' opened and
[6:51] he said May the god of Heaven bless you
[6:54] richly was his prayer then he says we
[6:56] cannot send gifts back because he
[6:58] doesn't make enough money but he's
[6:59] grateful for the thoughts let's listen
[7:02] to the quote
[7:04] now another thing I would like to say as
[7:07] brother Neville has so well said that we
[7:11] wished you the best in the theseal
[7:14] tidings and this time of of Fellowship
[7:18] around these holy days and so forth and
[7:21] then I want to take this time to express
[7:25] to each and every one of you how
[7:28] grateful I am to you for your Christmas
[7:31] cards and gifts and things that was
[7:34] received at our house amen I certainly
[7:37] thank you with all my heart it certainly
[7:39] did US good this morning when I got a
[7:42] little boy small enough yet to kind of
[7:45] want a Christmas tree and we had it in
[7:47] the room and this morning going to there
[7:49] I found several gifts from my church
[7:52] here and my friends from around
[7:54] different places that had come in laying
[7:56] under the tree and uh don't have words
[8:00] to express to you what I how I
[8:03] appreciate every one of them and may the
[8:07] god of Heaven bless you richly is my
[8:10] prayer and now and us you know how it
[8:13] would be we cannot send back uh gifts
[8:18] because I just wouldn't make that much
[8:21] money you know I I make $100 a week and
[8:24] I got a big family and about 10 million
[8:28] friends it was sure be kind of hard to
[8:30] go around them but we U we are grateful
[8:33] to you and your thoughts and I'm sure
[8:35] you understand the next year in 1961
[8:39] brother Ram said he wished he could give
[8:40] Christmas presents to everyone but he
[8:42] can't do it he also thanks the church
[8:45] for the nice things that he was given
[8:47] for Christmas and then he tells a story
[8:49] he decided to buy a Christmas gift for
[8:52] brother Neville a new top coat but then
[8:55] it looks like the church actually paid
[8:57] for brother Neville's top coat so here
[9:00] you see brother Ram had a heart to want
[9:01] to give out a Christmas gift to brother
[9:04] Neville the pastor but then the church
[9:06] took care of it let's listen to the
[9:08] quote well I want to take this
[9:12] opportunity to thank this church and its
[9:17] members for the nice things that you
[9:20] gave me for
[9:23] Christmas a while ago my son came in and
[9:26] gave me a great big box and I was in
[9:27] this my study room study
[9:30] I opened it up and found a new suit of
[9:32] clothes from this
[9:35] Tabernacle and little personal things
[9:37] that people have sent me just up there
[9:40] which I haven't opened up until Joe
[9:43] comes in tonight and opens up his and
[9:45] then I I certainly appreciate that the
[9:49] Lord bless you I wish I could give
[9:52] Christmas presents to everyone I can't
[9:54] do it you know how it is you just can't
[9:56] do it that's all if you if you give to
[9:59] one shows respect like that you just
[10:01] can't do it a minister just can't do
[10:03] that and I understand that brother
[10:06] Neville this morning was presented with
[10:09] a
[10:10] new top
[10:12] coat so grateful to you all for my
[10:15] brethren there's a little secret to that
[10:18] that Billy Paul and I know you know I'm
[10:22] so slow about anything uh catching on
[10:27] anyhow about anything Billy told me the
[10:30] other day he said you know Daddy I was
[10:32] over at the supermarket and said who did
[10:35] I meet over there he had a little quiver
[10:38] in his voice brother Neville and said he
[10:41] had on a top coat looked
[10:43] terrible now I said would mind fit him
[10:47] and so uh and he said no he's a much
[10:52] bigger man than you are so I said I'm
[10:56] just going down and get him one so then
[10:58] um
[10:59] I get my check from the church like he
[11:04] does so at that time Billy come running
[11:07] up with a great big uh influential word
[11:11] and smile on his face Daddy the church
[11:14] is going to get him one well I know the
[11:16] church could probably get him a little
[11:18] better one than so I thought that's just
[11:21] wonderful so we could all have but uh we
[11:24] know that it come in A Real Fine Place
[11:26] in brother Neville needing that Cod
[11:29] and six and finally in 1962 brother Ram
[11:33] said they had a present there for the
[11:35] kitties brother ramam said it's nothing
[11:37] compared to God giving his son Jesus
[11:39] Christ he said but just as Mortals one
[11:41] to another we do that so brother R said
[11:43] we give gifts to one another to let them
[11:45] know that God gave the greatest gift
[11:48] ever his son Jesus Christ let's listen
[11:50] to the quote but um I think the church
[11:54] has got a little present here for the
[11:55] little kitties that while I was just
[11:56] looking at door back there oh you want
[11:58] to stay after Sunday school you just
[12:00] hold on see CU I I think they got some
[12:03] presence back there for the little
[12:04] fellas to give out this morning amen and
[12:07] um when I you little fellas remember
[12:10] while we're doing this I want to make
[12:13] this clear it's not Santa
[12:16] Claus because that's a story that
[12:18] someday you'll learn that's nothing to
[12:20] it but it's from Jesus Christ the truth
[12:24] of all truth is said the Son of God and
[12:28] we're giving you this little present
[12:29] this morning because it's letting you
[12:31] know that one time God gave the greatest
[12:33] present could ever be given to the human
[12:35] race his son and um we have a poor way
[12:39] expressing it and there's nothing we can
[12:41] give to compare with that but just as
[12:42] Mortals one to another we do
[12:45] that now let's look at the most harsh
[12:48] Christmas quote I've ever heard of now
[12:50] of course I could be wrong on that but I
[12:52] also believe it needs balanced and we
[12:55] have seen a star and we've come to
[12:56] worship him on December 16th 19 63 and
[13:00] Tucson brother brandom said all those
[13:02] who are intolerably with it Christmas
[13:05] tinsel and things will be burn with
[13:07] unquenchable fire and notice he says the
[13:10] world The Sinner will be punished they
[13:12] will punish with the world the worldly
[13:15] loving people so we'll listen to this
[13:17] quote but then we'll listen to quotes
[13:18] before and after so here's the first
[13:21] quote that I won't to follow I want to
[13:25] follow the Morning Star Christ I want to
[13:28] follow and find my Jesus this day I want
[13:31] to get away from all this your Christmas
[13:32] tensil and things because someday it's
[13:34] going to be burnt with unquenchable fire
[13:37] and all those who are
[13:59] tonight to Jesus Christ and his word
[14:01] raise your hand again now anybody that
[14:03] hasn't raised God bless you bless you
[14:05] now before this quote brother Bram says
[14:07] no matter what they're doing out there
[14:09] they're not worshiping God at Christmas
[14:11] time he said it shouldn't bother us for
[14:13] making Christmas what it should be then
[14:15] brother Ram said light shines the best
[14:17] in darkness brother Ram said we should
[14:19] scream out on the streets it's the birth
[14:21] of Jesus Christ not the visit of Santa
[14:23] Claus let's listen to the quote
[14:27] so no matter how how bad the outside
[14:30] looks and what they're doing out there
[14:32] that should not bother us from making
[14:36] Christmas what it should be see I think
[14:40] that the light shines the best in the
[14:45] darkness darker it is the better the
[14:48] light shines sometimes just a small
[14:51] light where there's much light is not
[14:52] noticed but the darker gets that small
[14:56] light will shine that much stronger
[14:58] that's what the Church of the Lord Jesus
[15:00] Christ should be reflecting the light of
[15:04] him while he is absent from the earth in
[15:07] the physical body the church should be
[15:09] the reflection of Jesus Christ in these
[15:11] dark hours when Santa Claus and tinel
[15:14] all over the street we should scream out
[15:16] it it's a birth of Jesus Christ and not
[15:19] the visit of St
[15:22] Nicholas we're living in an awful dark
[15:24] time that's when our light should really
[15:26] shine now now the quote after the most
[15:30] harsh quote in the same sermon brother
[15:32] Rams getting the people to Bow their
[15:33] heads and close the service and brother
[15:36] Ram said I'm wishing you the very merest
[15:38] of Christmas that God would guide you to
[15:40] the word made flesh so we see the
[15:42] balance from this sermon brother R
[15:44] rebuked Sinners and their worldly
[15:47] behaviors during Christmas time but he
[15:49] told us how we should worship we should
[15:52] talk about the birth of Jesus Christ and
[15:54] it was okay for brother Ram to say I'm
[15:56] wishing you the very merriest of
[15:58] Christmas let's listen to the quote
[16:00] let's bow our heads now he
[16:05] saying let's get your mind on
[16:11] him I'm wishing you the very merriest of
[16:14] Christmas that God will send his star
[16:17] from the East that Rose in the East
[16:21] 19900 years ago and will guide you to
[16:24] the word made flesh
[16:31] I
[16:33] surrender
[16:35] all
[16:37] I
[16:40] surrender arms up to God
[16:44] all to thee my
[16:49] blessed
[16:54] [Music]
[16:57] savior lastly I want to play a quote
[16:59] from a 1965 sermon December 7th
[17:03] leadership in California 3 weeks before
[17:05] brother Ram died he was still thankful
[17:07] for a Christmas gift he's at a banquet
[17:10] and he wants to thank a lady who gave
[17:12] him a box of Christmas candy he said
[17:14] that was my first Christmas present so I
[17:16] thank you for it so to me this is what I
[17:18] see I see a pattern or brother R I'm
[17:20] always thankful for Christmas gifts I
[17:23] never see brother M rebuking anybody
[17:25] around him for giving him Christmas
[17:26] gifts or his children or his wife we see
[17:29] brother brandom wanting to give gifts to
[17:30] others but not having the financial
[17:33] ability to do it so I see a pattern of
[17:35] brother random having this approach to
[17:36] Christmas gifts it's fine to give them
[17:39] as long as you give with the right heart
[17:40] the right Spirit God loves a cheerful
[17:43] giver and it's all right to receive
[17:45] gifts and be thankful for them and be
[17:47] grateful to those who gave you the gifts
[17:49] so let's listen to this quote from
[17:51] December
[17:52] 65 and uh I want to thank that lady I
[17:55] can't thank of her name Billy just told
[17:57] me that' give me a box of Christmas
[17:59] candy just brought out the car a few
[18:00] moments ago the sister I can't think of
[18:02] her name she's from here in California
[18:05] as my first Christmas
[18:07] present so uh I thank you for
[18:13] it
[18:15] enclosing friends hope this video was a
[18:17] blessing by the grace of God again all
[18:19] these quotes kind of came to my mind
[18:20] when I saw a text about Christmas so I
[18:22] thought I'd put these quotes together
[18:24] and make a video showing this side how
[18:26] brother random was grateful for gifts
[18:28] and wanted to give gifts wished he could
[18:30] give gifts if he could afford them and
[18:32] so by God's grace this is why I feel I
[18:34] have the Liberty to give gifts to my
[18:36] children and others as I feel led of the
[18:38] Lord and I always remember brother BR
[18:40] finished the mysteries of God and in
[18:42] brother bram's preaching and Teaching
[18:43] Ministry he never forbid anyone of their
[18:46] Liberty of gift giving and brother R was
[18:49] always thankful when he received gifts
[18:52] and publicly thank people for those
[18:54] gifts so I think this topic is a great
[18:56] lesson on the Liberties that we have
[18:58] have as Christians and also the
[19:01] responsibility to not cause others to
[19:03] stumble with how we worship during
[19:05] Christmas time or really any holiday so
[19:08] I'd encourage you to remember Romans
[19:10] 14:23 whatsoever is not of faith is sin
[19:14] so I have faith in the scriptures I read
[19:15] earlier Colossians 2:16-17 and Romans 14
[19:19] about liberties we have as Christians I
[19:21] have faith in that so it doesn't stumble
[19:22] me to give my children gifts or to
[19:24] receive gifts at times if people want to
[19:26] give them to me and this is mainly
[19:28] because because I see these quotes from
[19:29] God's Prophet brother brandham I see his
[19:31] public gratitude his public thankfulness
[19:34] and I see a prophet of God who wished he
[19:36] could give a gift to everybody but just
[19:38] couldn't afford it that resonates with
[19:40] me that's how I feel I wish I could give
[19:42] more gifts but probably the best gift I
[19:44] could give to anybody would be to pray
[19:46] for them tell them I love them I
[19:48] appreciate them and so forth by the
[19:49] grace of God so let's try to do that
[19:51] this Christmas season if we can as we
