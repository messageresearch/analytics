========================================
[Music] sometimes great guys get together you ever seen great so-and-so great so-and-so our great don't never do that there's no great ones Among Us there's only one great one and that's God greetings friends in the mattress name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to continue the series on the 24 plus Lies coming out of Branham Tabernacle today by God's grace we'll cover the 14th lie which is that Branham Tabernacle claims they are the greatest Christians of all time and not only that but brother Branham was the greatest prophet of all time Branham tabernacle's current Pastor has the greatest Ministry and also a family member from Branham Tabernacle says he is the most blessed person on Earth because of his family before getting started on this video let me go through the 13 previous lies number one every word on tape is thus saith the Lord plus the tapes can never be wrong the tapes have no mistakes the tapes have every answer number two all the answers are on the tapes line number three we must unquestionably believe every word on tape is thus say the Lord even if brother Adam lied the fourth lie is there's a false Vision that every Church must play the tapes and every Church must be a tape church and of course this is a lie this is a denominational mandate the fifth lies that the tapes are the token and being part of a tape church is the token the sixth lie is the Tate boys are the true five-fold Ministry and tapes are number one in the five full ministry the seventh lie is brother random spirit and soul were identical to Jesus Christ's spirit and soul the eighth lie is that brother Brandon's Ministry is a living Ministry and Branham Tabernacle calls anyone a Demas who doesn't believe that the ninth lie is that revelation 22 verse 16 is Jesus telling everyone to be taped churches as the perfect will of God the tenth lies that brother Branham is the angel of revelation 22 verses 6 through 9 and verse 16. the 11th lies that the tapes are the absolute the 12th lies that anyone who does not play tapes is a make-believer or unbeliever and the 13th lie is that Branham Tabernacle is thus saith the Lord in the perfect will of God by playing tapes and decreasing living preachers now this 14th lie that Branham Tabernacle and brother Branham are the greatest of all time was made known on two blog posts from Brenham Tabernacles Pastor we'll read those in a moment but if you want a full in-depth teaching on the subject I made a video it's my 116th video from July 27th of last year 2022 the video is called our message Believers the greatest Christians of all time the bride Pride goat debate when I made that video it was very sad for me to see both Branham Tabernacle and then five full ministry preachers calling themselves the greatest of all time over the course of this last year I've continued to watch these preachers who said they were the greatest of all time they've decreased the amount of times they're saying they're the greatest of all time but it still comes through for example last month in July preacher D went to another preacher's congregation and told their congregation their Pastor was one of the greatest preachers of all time and then sadly even a few days ago at a youth meeting in this area a guest Minister preached to the youth that they were the greatest youth of all time and of course the minister had no scripture for that friends it's a great detriment to tell our youth that they're the greatest youth of all time there's no scripture for it and it creates a false sense of security as Jesus said the greatest among you will be the servants friends how can the youth today be the greatest Servants of all time are today's youth doing anything different from the previous generations youth are today's youth praying more fasting more seeing greater miracles than any other generation before us so you can see it's a great detriment to tell the youth that they're the greatest of all time all right let's get into the actual evidence of this lie coming out of Branham Tabernacle we have we have three blog posts and one video on this topic the first blog post is from August 1st 2022 so exactly three years ago from the day this is being recorded Branham tabernacle's Pastor said quote and today he has sent the greatest prophet of all time William Marion Branham to lead his bride end quote get together here I'm saying great so-and-so great so-and-so our great don't never do that there's no great ones Among Us now friends Everyone's entitled to their opinion but again the pastor Branham Tabernacle gives no Bible support for this and the worst part is that random Tabernacles Pastor did not say except for Jesus Christ in other words Branham Tabernacles Pastor didn't even acknowledge that Jesus Christ is the greatest prophet of all time was Jesus when he essentially put his father brother Branham above Jesus Christ and remember friends there's quotes from my 116th video where brother random said Moses is the greatest prophet of all time John the Baptist is the greatest prophet of all time and of course brother Adam said Jesus Christ is the greatest prophet of all time as you and I know we have to rightly divide the tapes and prove everything by the word of God as brother Ram told us to do second blog post is from Saturday December 26 2020 quote it is the greatest age of all time with the greatest messenger of all time who is gathering the greatest people of all time end quote random Tabernacle is saying they're the greatest of all time and brother Randolph said don't never call anyone great and brother Branham said there's no great ones Among Us let's listen to the quotes hands great guys get together you're gonna say great so-and-so great so-and-so our great don't never do that there's no great ones Among Us so this is an extremely sad blog post random tabernacle's Pastor is exalting his congregation and all the people that follow him around the world as the greatest of all time friends it is a prideful sin to call yourself the greatest of all time the Bible says he that humbleth himself shall be exalted but here we have Branham Tabernacles Pastor exalting himself now and not humbling himself now and exalting his people now and not asking his people to Humble themselves here's three quotes that are helpful in balancing the truth about the greatest of all time remember that Branham tabernacle's current Pastor is saying the laodicean Saints are the greatest of all time but notice what brother random said in the sermon from 1960 to laodicean church age brother random said Jesus had complaints against the laodicean age he didn't commend this for nothing so Branham tabernacle's Pastor is not saying what brother Brandon said brother Branham said this age does not get commended for anything let's listen to the quote now the next verse would be to the other churches come in but he didn't commend this church he had a complaint against it not a command right amen you didn't command this for nothing this lady you'll see their age with all the light that they had and went back on it they didn't need any commanding and either rebuking the Gods he had a complaint for this church not a command second quote is from the 70th week of Daniel 1961. brother Ram said a Philadelphian church was the greatest age of Love we've ever had so how can Branham Tabernacle say they're the greatest age the greatest congregation when brother Branham said the Philadelphian age had the greatest love let's listen to the quote long come Wesley after that with his age we see exactly what Wesley's age what was it called Philadelphia in the greatest age of Love we've ever had the Philadelphian age was right a third and final quote was from the church age book page 309 brother random said the teaching and preaching in the Philadelphia Church age was the greatest teaching and preaching of all time the ram said the greatest works of Christian literature and teaching and preaching came from this era never has its preachers and teachers been matched and never will they be so that means the laosian age cannot match the literature teaching and preaching that came from the Philadelphian Church age now why isn't Branham Tabernacle saying what the tapes and the books say so see friends Branham Tabernacle just constantly contradicts themselves they constantly contradict brother Branham let's listen to the quote the preaching of the word was never greater as Satan raised up his hordes of free thinkers as The Originators of Communism rose up as liberal theologians spread their filthy Wares God raised up Mighty Warriors of faith and the greatest works of Christian literature and teaching and preaching came from this era never has its preachers and teachers been matched and never will they be The spurgeons Parkers McLarens the Edwards bunions muellers brainerds Barnes Bishops all came from this era they preached taught and wrote the word they glorified his name I want to remind everyone as well that brother Ram said the greatest message was when Jesus rose from the dead preachers today and of course Branham Tabernacle are saying we have the greatest message of all time but is that what brother Branham said brother random said it in go tell 1960 on Easter morning the disciples got the greatest message that any man could ever get let's listen to the quote but on Easter morning when these disciples got the greatest message that any man could ever get what did they get gold tell my disciples I am risen from the dead death had been conquered there never was nobody on Earth no prophet and then a second quote on this is that brother random said the Shepherds at Jesus birth had the greatest message that Messiah is here now I noticed brother Ram did not say this message the Shepherds had was the second greatest message after his message he said they had the greatest message let's listen to the quote from White had to be Shepherds 1964. a great learning man King's potent takes monarchs but here he comes to the greatest of all the messages what was the message Messiah is here now and to make that known he bypassed all the trains to make it known to Humble Shepherds the third and final blog post is from October 22nd 2022 it says quote I have said many times that I have the greatest Ministry in the world I get to introduce the voice of God to my church every Sunday end quote here I'm saying great so-and-song great so and so our great don't never do that there's no great ones Among Us you're the pastor of random Tabernacle says he has the greatest Ministry in the world friends which Bible character in the Bible said they had the greatest Ministry in the entire world which prophet of God in the Bible said they were the greatest prophet of all time and had the greatest Congregation of all time no one said that and Jesus said a tree is known by its fruit the fruit coming out of Branham Tabernacle is where the greatest we have the greatest current Ministry we have the greatest Prophet we have the greatest congregation and that's a prideful sinful state for their Church to be in we should not be seeing how great we can make ourselves we should be seeing how humble we can become the Bible says humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God and that God will exalt you in due season finally I want to show one video this is of a member of random Tabernacle and this is a son of brother Branham notice he says he's the most blessed person in the world and ask yourself why is it because the blood of Jesus Christ has forgiven his sins or something related to the work of Jesus Christ the answer is no he believes he's the most blessed person in the world simply because of the two men he's got to work with in his ministry his father and his brother so let's watch the video and then we'll make some comments on it and I said God bless me of of any man first of all he'll let me be his son he chose me and he didn't let me be a son of a prophet and to be a brother prophet and to have worked with both of the prophets in my lifetime surely I've been a blessed man all we have to do is push play and obey God bless you and remember if God thought it brother Branham spoken I believe it and that settles God bless you so notice again friends from the video this Branham Tabernacle member is saying things brother Branham never said brother Brown never said press play and obey brother Brown never said God thought it I spoke it you must believe it that settles it friends we must be aware of the idolatry coming out of Branham Tabernacle they are idolizing brother Branham and his tapes brother Branham never said every word I said on tape settles every situation and every question remember this is the same man who said brother randoms mind and soul were identical to Jesus and if you don't believe that you're the seed of discrepancy and of course that was more idolatry what I read about in this blessed book I saw come manifest in a man called William Branham he preached like the Bible preached he talked like Jesus he walked like Jesus he lived like Jesus but his name was William Brown the only difference is the Corporal body and anything I don't believe that is the seed of discrepancy anyone with spiritual understanding can see this is an idolatry-filled congregation and just to follow up here's a few quotes from brother Brandon that say opposite of what brother Brandon's son is saying brother said the Seal of God is the greatest blessing by LeBron's oldest son says working with his father and his brother is the greatest blessing and that's not what brother Brandon said let's listen to the quote last night on the greatest criminal there is in the world the mark of the beast and denied on the greatest blessing areas in the world the Seal of God tomorrow night I'm going to here's another quote brother random says giving to others is the greatest blessing in life it's not who you know but it's about giving to others let's listen to the quote but I would ask of you would be a prayer for me before you lay down tonight that God would keep me humble in my heart and would help me and bless me so that I could be a blessing to you people I found out that the greatest blessing in life is giving something out not receiving in but giving out what you do for others what means so much here's a third quote brother random says it's the greatest privilege if God knocks at your heart the greatest privilege is not who you work with in life let's listen to the quote see if God knocks at your heart that's the greatest privilege you ever had in all your life anybody ever did that is for God to give you an invitation to come to him in closing hope this video has been a blessing friends we're continuing to move on in this series we thank God for the Holy Ghost for the Holy Ghost keeps guiding us into all truth friends brother Branham modeled a humble life before us brother Brown never said he was the greatest of all time he never said his congregation was the greatest of all time but Iran was humble like in the seventh seal he said you forget anything about me I am your brother a sinner Say by Grace not fit to live that's exactly the truth and I ain't saying that to be humble that's facts there's nothing in me not one sound thing at all but the grace of God is let my poor dimming eyes look beyond the curtain of time end quote the Rand also said when the Holy Ghost comes on you it makes you Meek humble and forgiving he said quote that's what the Holy Spirit does it makes you Meek makes you humble makes you forgiving end quote brother Ram said quote not as we brag we have no brag only on Jesus Christ none of us we only brag on Jesus Christ end quote so friends let us continue to Humble ourselves and let us brag on Jesus Christ only if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
