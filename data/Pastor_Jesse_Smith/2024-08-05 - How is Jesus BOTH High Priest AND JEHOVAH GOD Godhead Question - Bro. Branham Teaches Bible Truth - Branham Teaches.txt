TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] God could not suffer as the eternal spirit but when he become man he could suffer and feel the the pain and The Temptations that that man went through greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to answer a viewer's question how can Jesus be both a high priest or mediator and also be Jehovah God my brief answer is that Jesus was both fully man and fully God as taught by the Bible and God's Prophet brother William brandham hi friends I'm Jesse Smith pastor bride of Christ Fellowship here in akan Ohio USA and I defend the original Gospel of Jesus Christ that Jesus revealed to St Paul then had to restore at the end of the church age through Martin Luther John Wesley and the late Prophet William brandham 1909 to 1965 I also defend brother Ram's Godly Christian character so let's start with the question that was asked it's a great question it's basically a godhead question so I can add this video to the other godhead videos if the viewers would like and I could create a playlist on my YouTube channel if you would like so please let me know if that's a desire for the viewers by God's grace here's the question from a precious brother from Zambia please it is my humble request from you please explain in a clear way of understanding about Jesus Christ being a mediator between we Believers and yet him is the greatest Jehovah what does this mean excellent question so my answer in as clear terms as possible is that the body of Jesus Christ is a human body the body itself is not God because God is an invisible Immortal eternal spirit and so the body of Jesus Christ is fully human but yet it does not have a sin nature it had a word nature because John 1:14 says the word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us so because Jesus Jesus was fully a man he could experience Temptation pain suffering and his Humanity had to pray to the Divinity that was both inside of him and also in heaven because the Bible said Jesus would lift up his eyes and pray to the Father in heaven and yet Jesus said the father dwells within him in John 14:10 Jesus said the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works and also this father is the same as the Holy Ghost it's the same person there's only one person in the godhead remember friends the godhead is a mystery according to Colossians 2:2 the mystery of God and Christ the Bible tells us also want to say that Jesus has two elements to him or two characteristics to him he has a humanity and he has a deity in the humanity it's fully flesh but it had the nature of the word so Jesus did not have a sin nature but then he also had a spiritual attribute or a spiritual nature inside of him which was the Holy Ghost or God the Father the Bible said the fullness of the godhead dwelt in Christ bodily it's found in Colossians 2:9 for in him dwell all the fullness of the godhead bodily so that must mean the full authority of God was in Jesus Christ because again we know the father dwelt in Jesus but then the Bible said he would lift up and pray to his father in Heaven you see that in John 11:41 and 42 at the grave of Lazarus Jesus lifted up his eyes and said father I thank thee that thou has heard me and I knew that thou hearest me always so see he looks up to heaven so the fullness of the authority of the Holy Ghost was inside of him and yet the holy ghost or father it's the same person the spirit of God was still able to be in heaven as well Jesus wouldn't lie and say the father's in heaven if the father wasn't in heaven this goes along with Matthew 28:18 and Jesus came and spake unto them saying all power is given unto me in heaven and in Earth so the fullness of the godhead bodily had to mean this power this Authority all of God's power and authority was given unto Jesus so the body of Jesus Christ in heaven does the high priest or mediation between us and then Jesus's father remember the father of Jesus is the invisible infinite eternal spirit that no man has seen nor will ever see remember no one will ever see the father because he's the invisible Spirit there's numerous verses that teach that like John 1:18 no man hath seen God at any time the only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father he ha declared him and then 1 Timothy 6:16 whom no man hath seen nor can see so it's clear no one ever has seen the invisible Spirit God the father and no man will ever see the invisible Spirit God the father now with that in mind let's go to 1 Timothy 2:5 for there's one God and one metair between God and man the man Christ Jesus so here we see between men and the invisible God is the Lord Jesus Christ remember he's fully man fully God so that's how Jesus can be both God and man his Humanity makes intercession to the father and his Humanity Can Be Touched by the feeling of the infirmities of those he's interceding for like you and I he's been doing this of course over the last 2,000 years since his Ascension to Heaven sitting at the right hand of the Majesty on high brother R told us the only intercessor between God and man is Jesus Christ from show us the father 63 let's listen to the quote our only intercessor between God and man is Jesus Christ that's according to the Bible you might have others try but there's only one that God hears and that's Jesus Christ that's right notice as he set to a high priest the same yesterday today and forever here's another quote 1958 Jesus Christ the same brother Ram said no other mediator between no other mediator between God and man the scripture says so Jesus Christ is the only one that that stands between God and man to make intercession he's the high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities so God had to become man in order to feel our infirmities but when God became man that body of Jesus was not God it was an image or manifestation of God because God cannot be touched God the Father cannot be touched by any infirmity but if God created a body then the body could feel the infirmities and make intercession to the father for those who need intercession let's listen to the quote for his body has been raised up and set on the throne of God tonight to make intercessions on our confession he is the priest high priest of our confession Hebrews 3:1 then he setting there as a high priest and may I say this there's no other mediator between God and man but Jesus Christ the scripture says so and he is the only one that stands between God and man to make intercession and the scripture says that he is the high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmity and also friends this is what brother R said God could not die as God or the spirit form so he made a body to dwell in that could die brother Ram said God couldn't suffer and take the penalty on himself as long as he was Jehovah in the spirit so God had to become flesh and dwell among us as a human being brother brandom said that he could taste death let's listen to that quote when their eyes were open they knew him 1964 let's listen to the quote that's the reason God was made flesh in order to die that he could suffer and take the penalty upon himself he couldn't do it as long as he was Jehovah in the spirit God the father in spirit could not do it but when God was made flesh and dwelt Among Us a human being then he could taste death and tast the penalty that he had put up on all human beings he tuck it up on himself and paid the priz here again brother Ram says it again in Investments 1963 God coming down to become man to die God could not die as a spirit because he could not die he's Eternal and he could not die but God could make himself in such a way that he could feel the pain he could feel and suffer God could not suffer as an eternal spirit but when he became man he could suffer and feel the pain and temptations that man went through let's listen to the quote God coming down to become man to die God could not die as a spirit because he he could not die he's in Eternal and he could not die but God could make himself in such a way that he could feel pain and he could feeled and suffer God could not suffer as the eternal spirit but when he become man man he could suffer and feel the the pain and The Temptations that that man went through like Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden and every once s here's another one it wasn't so from the beginning 62 brother Ram said God built himself a body that he lived in himself brother raham said it was not Jesus the body that showed the glory of God he said it was God he said it was the glory of God in the Son of God showing the glory of God so again brother R says the human body of Jesus had no glory of its own so the father had to come and dwell in him the father's the Holy Ghost and that brought the glory of God upon the body of Jesus Jesus reflected god let's listen to the quote God and otherwise built himself a body that he lived in himself God came down was manifested in flesh in Christ and it was not Jesus the body the Son of God it was the god of Glory in the son of God showing the glory of God you see through himself the god of Glory manifesting the glory of God and in him God dwelt in him and he reflected God friends it's also good to look at some verses about Jesus's Humanity because Jesus's Humanity was not fully God in other words Jesus's Humanity was not the eternal spirit it was fully a man Jesus's body was not Divine Jesus body was not Eternal now his body is eternal now because it's glorified but it wasn't while he was on the earth Jesus was fully man yet he had a word nature and then he was also fully God because all of God's Authority and Power dwelt in him here's some verses to keep in mind Jesus's Humanity did not know the day and hour of the Rapture of his own return for the Gentile bride of Jesus Christ that's according to Mark 13:32 also Jesus did not know who touched him when the woman with the blood issue touched him that was Mark 5:31 of course there's new nous other verses that show Jesus's Humanity but we also see Jesus's deity in John 8:58 Jesus said before Abraham was I am then in John 14 8-11 Philip said show us the Father and Jesus said have I been so long with you and yet thou has not known me Phillip he that has seen me has seen the Father and Jesus went on to say the father that dwelleth in me he doeth The Works beautiful scriptures there here's another quote from 56 faith brother Ram said he was a God man he was both man and God God was in him brother was talking about John 11 again the resurrection of Lazarus let's listen to the quote I said woman that won't work I said let me show you something he was a God man he was both man and God God was in him that's right I said when he went down to the Grave that's right he wept that was a man but when he draw that little St together he said Lazarus come forth now man had been dead four days stood on his feet live again that was more than a man that was God speaking out of there sir here's another helpful quote adoption part 3 1960 brother said brother R said now Jesus the body was a man we know that let's listen to the quote God only had one name and his name is Jesus that was his son he took the name of his son God now Jesus the body was a man man we know that that was the son of God that was overshadowed how we do not believe in one this type of people it says God's like your finger we believe there three ATT attributes of God remember friends the body of Jesus was a creation that's why the Bible said he's the beginning of the creation of God but that verse also applies to when Jesus the logos was created as the first light when God said let there be light Revelation 3:14 Jesus said the beginning of the creation of God so that verse has a compound meaning it means spiritually Jesus was the first creation as the logos of God the visible light and he was also the being of the creation of God as both a man and God and of course he's the only one of that kind that's why he's worthy of our praise worthy of our worship There's No One Like Jesus Hallelujah so friends let's remember that Jesus's body was a creation of God jesus' body was a veil of God Jesus's body was a manifestation of God according to 1 Timothy 3:16 but remember the eternal spirit of God dwelt inside the body of Jesus Christ the eternal spirit of God cannot be touched by infirmities because the eternal spirit of God cannot feel pain so God had to create a body and then that body could experience pain and suffering and then that body could make prayerful intercession for you and I because the body of Jesus Christ understands pain and suffering and infirmities so the body of Jesus J wasn't God meaning jesus' body was not an eternal spirit but the eternal spirit of God lived inside jesus' body and does so now by God's grace Also regarding Jesus's Humanity we know Jesus could be tempted he suffered Temptation the devil came to him to tempt him three times in Matthew 4 and also the parallel passage in Luke 4 but the Bible said God cannot be tempted James 13 for God cannot be tempted with evil neither tempteth he any man so we see the difference between the body of Jesus and the eternal spirit of God the father or the Holy Ghost in closing friends hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God I just thought I'd answer this wonderful godhead question there's so many more verses I could have used and quotes I just tried to pick out the ones that I could initially find so we're thankful that Jesus Christ ever lives to make intercession for us according to Hebrews 7:25 anytime we're are in need of help we can go in prayer to the Lord Jesus Jesus Christ he hears us and he'll Minister for us he'll intercede for us to the father and what we want of course is the perfect will of God if God wants to deliver us with a miracle praise the Lord if God wants to heal us instantly praise the Lord but if God has a reason for us to suffer or doesn't want to answer right away then we just got to trust God and love God we got to be mature Believers and know that God works at the pace of perfection we had a Preacher Brother Aaron come in last weekend and he quoted Charles Spurgeon who said God works at the pace of Perfection and surely that's the truth God makes all things beautiful in his own time and all things work together for good to them that love the Lord so we're thankful we know that Jesus can be both mediator and he's the image of the invisible God he is Jehovah God's image and Jehovah God dwells in Jesus Christ if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
