TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] when God has given you the true baptism of the Holy Spirit it's a new birth you're born to new of the Holy Ghost greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to show 12 phrases the King James version Bible uses to describe the one self-same event and experience of the baptism of the Holy Ghost friends remember that the baptism of the Holy Ghost is called a mystery in Colossians chapter 1. Saint Paul said it was the mystery hid from ages Christ in you the hope of glory and brother Branham gives us the revelation of this mystery in the church age book he said he gives it with thus saith the Lord now before we leave this subject I want to make myself very clear on what the baptism with the Holy Ghost is according to the word it is not according to me and it is not according to you it has to be according to thus saith the Lord or we are falsely LED amen and one of the scriptures that he uses out of the many was Acts chapter 19 verses 1 through 6 the Believers in Ephesus led by Apollos were already Believers but Saint Paul came to them and said have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed and of course they said no Paul laid his hands on them and then they received the baptism of the Holy Ghost so this shows that the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the third work of Grace the first step is being saved which is called justification the second stage is called sanctification that is getting a new mind or new spirit cleaning out your habits and then a person gets the third work of Grace which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost the Seal of the spirit of God in the believer's soul so I felt this video would be helpful because there is some confusion in some message churches but especially in denominations about what the new birth is some people teach the new birth is different from the filling or the filling is different from the baptism of the Holy Ghost but the truth is as God's Prophet brother random taught us through the Bible that the new birth is the same thing as the filling of the Holy Ghost which is the same thing as the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the holy ghost coming to live and abide in the believer's soul as many of my viewers know brother Branham grew in his Revelation on this subject as late as 1962 brother Brown taught the filling and the baptism were two different events let's listen to the quote I never thought there's a person believe that like me until this morning you heard Charles Fuller as it was going down he believes too that the new birth is not the baptism the Holy Ghost the new birth is being born the Holy Ghost is a baptism and but then by 1963 brother Branham taught they were one in the same such as this quote from the token message and then we'll listen to two quotes from the church age book where brother random says being baptized with the Holy Ghost or born of the spirit is one of the same and then he says the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the new birth it is the filling let's listen to the quotes every promise in the Bible is yours it belongs to you okay this token is up on you and God has sealed you now we want to check ourselves just for a moment when God has given you the true baptism of the Holy Spirit then the life of Jesus Christ is within you now that's true every Theologian I have to admit that to be this it's a new birth you're born to new of the Holy Ghost and because that God has did this and you know you're no good in yourself and you accept what God has did then he seals you into his kingdom by the Holy Spirit I mean for The Sinner to come forward and be born again which is to be baptized into the body of Christ by the Holy Ghost which is exactly what took place at Pentecost when the church was launched in other words to be born of the spirit is to be truly baptized with the Holy Ghost it is one and the same what is the baptism with the Holy Ghost it is the spirit baptizing you into the body of Christ it is the new birth it is the spirit of God coming in and filling you after you have repented having heard his word and been baptized in water as an answer of a good conscience toward God so now that we see the quotes of brother Branham prove the New Birth the baptism and the filling of the Holy Ghost are the one and self-same event I want to reference a section from my 2021 book on the 12 New Testament Mysteries revealed it's on pages 343 until 3 46. it's in the sixth chapter on the mystery of Christ in you the baptism of the Holy Ghost and in this section it's called unifying and differentiating terminology I showed there are at least 12 phrases or synonyms for the baptism of the Holy Ghost now in this section I show a chart proving there are three works of Grace in the New Testament justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost but I'll focus on these 12 bullets on page 345 here are 12 different phrases or words all describing the self-same event and experience of the baptism of the Holy Ghost the first terminology is converted from Luke 22 32 Jesus said when you're converted strengthen your brethren he was speaking to Peter the second phrase is endued with power from on high Luke 24 49 again the words of Jesus the third is born again or New Birth from John 3 verse 7 again quoting Jesus the fourth is receiving eternal life spoken by Jesus in John 10 28 and spoken by Saint John in first John 5 11-13 the fifth is love or charity spoken by Paul and Saint Peter in Romans 5 verse 5 First Corinthians 13 1-13 and second Peter 1 verse 7. the six is the Holy Spirit dwelling in you according to Paul in Romans 8 verse 11. the seventh is the spirit of adoption as spoken by Paul Romans 8 verse 15. the eighth is God the Father dwelling and walking in use spoken Again by Paul in second Corinthians 6 verses 16 and 18. the ninth is called the seal or spiritual Mark spoken by Saint Paul in Ephesians 1 verse 13 and Ephesians 4 verse 30. the tenth is called Christ in you mentioned earlier in Colossians chapter 1 verse 27 spoken by Saint Paul the 11th is washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost spoken by Paul in Titus 3 verse 5. and the 12th and final phrase is called washed robes made white in the blood of the Lamb written by Saint John of course in Revelation 7 verse 14. so without a doubt friends both brother Branham and the Bible proved the baptism of the Holy Ghost have at least 12 different phrases or terms that describe this one event this one experience understanding these truths will take away the confusion about the baptism of the Holy Ghost and remember Jesus Christ is the one who coined the phrase baptism of the Holy Ghost it's found in Acts chapter 1 verse 5 and of course other places in the gospels acts 1 5 says for John's really baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence in closing hope this short video was a blessing I just had this topic on my heart and thought I would make a short video about it to help the Saints by the grace of God over the years I've got numerous emails and comments asking about the baptism of the Holy Ghost and I felt the Holy Spirit bring this section of my book to my remembrance and I thought I would show how there's at least 12 perhaps more phrases or terms that all describe that one glorious blessed event of a soul being baptized with the Holy Ghost born from above if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
