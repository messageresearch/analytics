TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] trinitarianism is of the devil I say that thus sayith the Lord amen Daniel saw him many hundred years 700 years and said he was the Ancient of Days one like the son of man come in power and United with this Ancient of Days and the Judgment was set greetings friends in the mattress name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to answer a viewer's question about Daniel 7 9 through 14 a viewer asked if these verses prove the Trinity and of course my answer is no Daniel 7 does not prove the Trinity Dogma it's a man-made Creed it's man-made heresy it's an addition to the word of God so I'd like to give a bible-based answer based upon the Bible revelations that Jesus Christ revealed to his Prophet The Late William Aon brandham who lived from 1909 to 1965 this video defends the revelation of the godhead that Jesus revealed to brother brandham and then spoke with thus sayith the Lord Brother Bram said thus sayith the Lord trinitarianism is of the devil and it is because it's in addition to the word of God let's listen to the quote trinitarianism is of the devil I say that thus sayeth the Lord amen look where it come from it come from the N seeeing Council when the Catholic Church become in rulership the word Trinity is not even mentioned in the enre book of the Bible and as far as three Gods that's from Hell there's one God it's exactly right now do you say then you believe it all these people that as trinitarians are of hell no sir I believe they are Christians but the hour is approaching brother where they are sincerely wrong starting in Daniel 7 9-14 verses 9 and 10 speak of the Ancient of Days verse 11 speaks of the horn verse 12 speaks of the other beasts and then verses 13 and 14 again speak of the Ancient of Days and then one like unto the son of man comes to the Ancient of Days so trinitarians picture in their own minds that there are two persons they say the son of man is the second person of the Trinity coming to the first person of the Trinity the father of course this is a lie this is false teaching the fact fact is the father is invisible the father has never been seen and never will be seen there's numerous verses about this in the Bible if you begin in John 1: 18 it says no man hath seen God at any time so it's clear no man has ever seen the invisible God Colossians 1:15 says Jesus is the image of the invisible God and then 1 Timothy 6:16 says God dwells in the light whom no man hath seen nor can see so no one will ever see father God the heavenly father God the Father God the father is invisible so the Ancient of Days already cannot be a visible Heavenly Father the Ancient of Days is actually a visible image of the father but it's the logos of God or the theophany of God we could also say it's the logos of the Son of God because God's invisible out of God came forth a light that was the logos in the beginning that fulfills Genesis where God said let there be light before the Sun and the Moon came into existence so this Ancient of Days is the logos of God it came out of God therefore it's a creation it's a Son of God it's the visible image of God in the spiritual theophany form this logos is also spoken of in Proverbs 822 through 31 the Bible said the Lord possessed me in the beginning of his way before his works of old speaking of the wisdom of God or the logos of God God the father created the visible logos and God the father spirit dwelt inside the visible logos Proverbs 8:30 said then I was by him as one brought up with him and I was daily his Delight rejoicing always before him so it's not teaching two persons it's teaching the manifestation of one person the invisible becoming visible father invisible son visible so in Daniel 79 and 10 Thrones were cast down and this Greek word means placed down so the Thrones are getting placed in their position in preparation for the great white Throne judgment then we see the Ancient of Days sitting His Garment white as snow hair on his head like pure wool his throne was like the fiery flame and his wheels is burning fire verse 10 a fiery stream issued and came forth from before him thousand thousands ministered unto him and 10,000 times 10 thousands stood before him the Judgment was set and the books were open so we believe these thousand thousands ministering under him were the bride that would eventually sit on those judgment seats as Jesus Promised in Revelation 3: 21 to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and have set down with my father in his throne it was also promised in Revelation 20:4 I saw Thrones and they sat upon them and judgment was given unto them so the same event in Revelation 20 the white Throne judgment is spoken of in Daniel chapter 7 judgment is given unto the bride the Church of course they're going to be judging by the spirit of Christ as 1 Corinthians chapter 6 says do you not know that the Saints shall judge the world and if the world shall be judged by you are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters 1 Corinthians 62 and3 know ye not that we shall judge Angels how much more things that pertain to this life so we see the Ancient of Days in verses 9 and 10 that's the theophany of Jesus it's the theophany of the invisible father because the father can never be seen and then in verses 13 and 14 one un liken to the son of man comes to the Ancient of Days so this is the glorified body of Jesus coming to the theophany of God it is not a second person coming to the first person that would be polytheism that would be tritheism or three gods and remember friends the Holy Ghost in Acts chapter 2 manifested as 120 different lights so we cannot count a different manifestation of God as a different person if that's the case then the Holy Ghost is 120 different persons at least but we know God's not 120 persons God is one person so notice in Daniel 7:13 one like the son of man comes to the Ancient of Days so this glorified body of Jesus comes before the theophany of Jesus and this is for the great white Throne judgment Jesus talked about this in Matthew 2664 Jesus said unto them neveress I say unto you Hereafter shall you see the son of man sitting on the right hand of power and coming in the Clouds Of Heaven so the Pharisees and all those Sanhedrin that agreed for Jesus to be crucified Jesus told them you'll see me coming with the clouds of heaven and so this is what he was referring to Daniel 713- 14 notice he comes on the Clouds Of Heaven and the Pharisees and everyone all the goats are standing there along with the Sheep the foolish virgin and they're going to be judged by Jesus Christ just as Paul said Jesus Will judge Everyone by his Gospel according to Romans 2:16 then in verse 14 of Daniel 7 there was given him Dominion glory and a kingdom all people Nations languages should serve him his Dominion is an everlasting Dominion which shall not pass away in his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed this is speaking of the future home the New Jerusalem so notice friends we see God keeping his word god changes his form or God changes his manifestation just as Philippians 26 and 7 says he changes form that word form in the Greek means morphe morphe means the form by which a person or thing strikes the vision the external appearance even in heaven God can change his form Daniel 7 showed him like an Ancient of Days Ezekiel 1 though: 26-28 doesn't describe him exactly the same Daniel 7 does but it does say he had the appearance of fire but it did say he had the appearance of a man in Ezekiel 1 126 in Ezekiel 127 he's glowing and has the appearance of fire from the appearance of his loins even upward and from the appearance of his loin even downward I saw as it were the appearance of fire and it had brightness round about then there was a radiant rainbow like glory in Ezekiel 1:28 as the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain so was the appearance of the brightness roundabout this was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord so this could be the same manifestation as Daniel 7 versus 9 and 10 or it could be something slightly different and I say that because even in Revelation 5: six Jesus comes forth to take the book and break the Seven Seals and the Bible said he looks like a lamb that had been slain and he's got seven horns and seven eyes well that's a different manifestation than the glorified body of Jesus because it looks just like a man with a white robe and so forth so in Revelation 5:6 did the glorified body change its form I don't know but it seems like it did it changed its form so John could see the lamb as it had been slain the cross was our victory by the grace of God Almighty through death Jesus conquered death as the Hebrews writer expressed so we rejoice in the Revelation that God is one person who changes his form or manifests himself in different ways as 1 Timothy 3:16 Says great is the mystery of godliness God was manifest In the Flesh God can change his form from a pillar of fire to a rock in the wilderness to the body of MDC here to the Ancient of Days also to the glorified body of Jesus one likeing the son of man God is unlimited we cannot limit God's power to manifest himself in as many ways as he wants even at his baptism in Matthew chapter 3 you had the body of Jesus there in the water you had a voice from Heaven saying this is my beloved Son and you had the Holy Ghost ascending like a dove not three persons but three manifestations of the Holy One of Israel the creator of heavens and earth the unlimited Almighty omnipotent Lord Jesus Christ so before we close I want to play few quotes from God's Prophet brother brandham regarding Daniel chapter 7 brother brandham said the son of man coming to the Ancient of Days was the son of man uniting with the Ancient of Days I love that wording there it's the manifestations uniting for the white Throne judgment he also said the son of man joined in with him the Ancient of Days so we see these manifestations coming together to unite into one manifestation as First Corinthians 15 says that the Son of God when all enemies are under his feet will give the kingdom back over to the father mysterious yes no doubt but does it speak of tritheism or three persons no it does not it's one God manifesting himself both those quotes are from the Patmos Vision December 4th 1960 and then we'll listen to the church age book section where brother brandom lists Daniel 7 9-14 in Chapter 2 the Patos Vision let's listen to the quotes Daniel saw him many hundred years 700 years and said he was the Ancient of Days one like the the son of man come in power and United with this Ancient of Days and the Judgment was set Daniel saw him 700 years before that in the same position the same kind same man stand there the Ancient of Days and one like the son of man that joined in with him and all judgment was committed to him stand the white Throne judgment now he is coming the judge of all the Earth he will be crowned with wisdom that is what the white and glistening hair signifies see this in Daniel 7: 9-14 I beheld till the Thrones were cast down and the Ancient of Days did sit whose garment was white as snow and the hair of his head like the pure wool his throne was like the fiery flame and his wheels as burning fire a fiery stream issued and came forth from before him thousand thousands ministered unto him and 10,000 times 10,000 stood before him the Judgment was set and the books were opened I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spake I beheld even till the Beast was slain and his body destroyed and given to the Burning Flame as concerning the rest of the beasts they had their Dominion taken away yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time I saw in the night visions and behold one like the son of man came with the clouds of heaven and came to the Ancient of Days and they brought him near before him and there was given him dominion and glory and a kingdom that all people Nations and languages should serve him his Dominion is an everlasting Dominion which shall not pass away and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed there it is Daniel saw him with that white hair he was the judge opening the books and judging out of them Daniel saw him coming in clouds that is exactly what John saw they both saw him exactly the same they saw the judge with his judgment girdle over his shoulders standing pure and holy full of wisdom fully qualified to judge the world in righteousness Hallelujah so let's begin with reviewing the nine proofs the Trinity is heresy or false Doctrine you'll find this on pages 23 through 32 in my 2021 book I'm going to go through these quickly first and the most decimating to its validity the Trinity Dogma adds to the Bible second Jesus and his Apostles taught and affirmed pure Hebrew monotheism rather than trinitarianism third the athanasian Creed or 6th Century trinitarian confessional contains multiple contradictions to Biblical teaching on the godhead I list six examples in the book one of which is the shield of the Trinity which contains a blatant lie where it says the father is not the Holy Spirit the father is a Spirit According To Jesus in John chter 4 and the Holy Spirit is a spirit as its name declares so if the holy spirit is not the father then Jesus had two fathers and of course we know that's wrong fourth major Bible contradictions and inconsistencies exist among trinitarians fifth the early trinitarians did not affirm that the Holy Spirit was divine into the Council of constan ople in 381 ad so think of that friends the Holy Ghost was not considered Divine in trinitarian Minds until 381 ad nearly 300 years after the final Apostle died St John here's a quick visual regarding water baptism and the godhead the true Apostolic baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ was administered by Peter around 30 or 33 ad Paul continued that of course up to 59 ad as recorded in scripture in Acts 19:5 and then the enemy began to change baptism from the apostolic baptism to Modern baptism or the Liturgy baptism which is a false baptismal formula of father son holy ghost that was around 100 AD and then around 180 ad Theophilus coined the Greek word Trias shortly after that tertullian coins the Latin word Trinitas so both words mean Trinity then according to the world book from 2003 the so-called three persons were declared as one God at the Council of NAA in 325 ad and again that's not according to me that's according to the World Book 2003 page 447 under the word Trinity so with that visual it's just so simple to see water baptism was changed about 40 years after St Paul used it at Ephesus and then the godhead began being changed about 80 years after St John died around 180 ad again proving the Bible off authors did not teach three persons the Bible authors never had the idea of three persons in their minds six trinitarian images and artwork are often deceptive creating false representations of the godhead seventh some trinitarians use two fear tactics to persuade others to believe in the Trinity one is heresy the other is hell and eighth and finally God sent a prophet named William brandham to warn Christians about the false Trinity Doctrine so I think I misspoke earlier in the video I think I said there was nine proofs so I'm sorry about that there's eight proofs friends hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God our God is so great the Lord Jesus Christ we cannot limit him and his manifestations and most importantly we never want to add to the word by calling him three persons when he never says that and we never want to take away from the word of God so we just need the wisdom of the Holy Ghost we need the patience of the Holy Ghost to wait upon the timing of God and then God will reveal his will and his truth to us in his time and season if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
