[0:03] and in this would be a woman stand up
[0:05] that would govern the united states
[0:08] not actually a woman but a church
[0:13] not actually a woman but a church
[0:19] greetings friends in the mattress name
[0:22] of the lord jesus christ
[0:24] the purpose of this video is to follow
[0:26] up on my march 2021 video titled is
[0:30] brother branham's sixth vision fulfilled
[0:32] by kamala harris and joe biden it
[0:35] doesn't seem to be
[0:38] in this follow-up i want to share more
[0:40] quotes from brother branham to again
[0:42] show that brother branham never said
[0:44] thus saith the lord the sixth vision
[0:46] must be a literal woman
[0:48] the truth is brother ram did not know if
[0:50] the sixth vision would be fulfilled by a
[0:52] literal woman
[0:53] or mary
[0:55] or by the catholic church
[0:57] so it is still the opinion of preachers
[0:59] and other message believers
[1:01] and not a fact that the sixth vision is
[1:04] fulfilled
[1:06] i also want to say that this video is
[1:08] not made with any bitterness or
[1:10] spitefulness
[1:11] i'm not trying to cause any division or
[1:13] anything but i just want to humbly show
[1:15] more quotes from brother branham that i
[1:17] found since making the first video back
[1:19] in march 2021
[1:22] and i hope viewers can then understand
[1:24] how we do not have a thus saith the lord
[1:26] from brother branham about the
[1:28] fulfillment
[1:29] of the sixth vision
[1:30] and thereby we should not act like it
[1:34] i also hope our viewers can see how some
[1:36] message believers
[1:38] either willingly or ignorantly
[1:41] just pick and choose quotes that fit
[1:43] their interpretation
[1:44] rather than acknowledging all the quotes
[1:46] from brother branham on a particular
[1:48] subject
[1:50] my prayers for these believers to be
[1:51] more humble and more balanced just as i
[1:54] want to be humble and balanced by the
[1:56] grace of god
[1:58] i still believe the three reasons why
[2:00] the sixth vision is likely
[2:03] not fulfilled which include
[2:06] number one some of brother brahms own
[2:08] words make it sound like the fourth
[2:10] vision is not fulfilled yet
[2:12] as he said it's in the process of coming
[2:13] to pass
[2:14] this would mean the fifth and sixth
[2:16] visions have not come to pass because
[2:18] the first three visions that have come
[2:20] to pass were fulfilled in that order
[2:24] second a couple details about the sixth
[2:26] vision do not seem to have come to pass
[2:29] such as many people not thinking kamala
[2:32] harris is beautiful
[2:34] and second people recognizing that
[2:36] kamala harris does not have complete
[2:38] power over the united states and our
[2:40] nation as a whole has not bowed to mrs
[2:43] harris
[2:45] third regarding the fifth vision
[2:47] brother branham saw the little fig leaf
[2:49] dress in a magazine but it seems this
[2:52] vision
[2:53] has still not come to pass yet because
[2:55] if it was the whole world would have to
[2:57] recognize that the little fig leaf dress
[3:00] had come to pass
[3:02] just like the undeniable fulfillment of
[3:05] the first three visions
[3:07] about mussolini hitler
[3:09] and nazism and fascism being swallowed
[3:12] up in communism
[3:15] so i don't believe there's enough
[3:16] evidence to show that the fourth and
[3:18] fifth and sixth visions have been
[3:20] fulfilled with undeniable proof like we
[3:22] have with the first three visions being
[3:25] fulfilled undeniably
[3:28] and now it seems i could add a fourth
[3:30] reason i do not believe the sixth vision
[3:31] is fulfilled and that would be brother
[3:34] random never gave a definitive about who
[3:36] the powerful woman ruler would be
[3:40] as he interpreted the woman in at least
[3:42] four different ways which i'll soon show
[3:44] by the grace of god
[3:47] again let me emphasize i do believe all
[3:50] seven major visions and i believe the
[3:53] first three are fulfilled
[3:55] so i believe there are four remaining
[3:57] visions that will be undeniably
[3:58] fulfilled with the same irrefutable
[4:01] evidence as the first three head
[4:04] i'm going to again define the sixth
[4:06] vision as written in the church age book
[4:09] quote then in the sixth vision there
[4:11] arose up in america a most beautiful but
[4:14] cruel woman she held the people in her
[4:16] complete power
[4:18] i believe that this was the rise of the
[4:20] roman catholic church though i knew it
[4:22] could possibly be a vision of some woman
[4:24] rising in great power in america
[4:27] due to a popular vote by women end quote
[4:32] five quotes about the sixth vision
[4:35] let's go through five quotes that prove
[4:37] brother branham was not positive
[4:39] about the fulfillment of the sixth
[4:41] vision because he said it could be at
[4:43] least four different women
[4:45] which were mary
[4:47] a vice president
[4:49] a president or the roman catholic church
[4:52] here's the first quote from 1960
[4:55] notice brother branham said she'll
[4:57] either be president vice president or
[4:59] it'll be the catholic church as a woman
[5:02] so in this one quote he listed three out
[5:04] of the four possibilities as to the
[5:06] identity of the woman
[5:08] let's listen to the quote
[5:10] everything is woman and remember
[5:12] thus saith the lord there'll be a woman
[5:15] rule
[5:17] before the end time
[5:18] she'll either be president vice
[5:20] president or it'll be the catholic
[5:21] church as a woman a senior a great woman
[5:24] the nation bowed to her it'll be one
[5:26] before the end time thus saith the lord
[5:29] write it down find out your young people
[5:32] see if it happens if it isn't i'm a
[5:34] false
[5:36] prophet next the next three quotes are
[5:40] from 1961.
[5:41] here in the first quote
[5:43] brother ram said
[5:45] the woman will be a church
[5:47] and notice this means it won't be a
[5:48] literal woman like kamala harris
[5:51] so this quote makes us wonder why aren't
[5:52] the preachers saying what the tapes say
[5:54] in this quote
[5:56] let's listen to the quote
[6:00] [Applause]
[6:12] here in the next quote from jezebel
[6:14] religion 1961 brother branham said the
[6:17] woman being worshiped was mary so here's
[6:20] the fourth possibility of the identity
[6:23] of the woman from the sixth vision
[6:25] brother branham said it could be mary
[6:27] and again ask yourself why aren't
[6:29] preachers reading this quote or
[6:31] quoting this quote from brother branham
[6:33] since some of them say we believe all
[6:34] the quotes
[6:35] and some of them say say what the tapes
[6:37] say
[6:38] let's listen to the quote
[6:41] there will come a worship of a woman in
[6:42] the united states and they'll be married
[6:46] i'll see it 30 1931
[6:48] seven things happen
[6:50] i got it i don't pay for here with me
[6:53] wrote it in 1931.
[6:58] here in the next quote this is one of
[6:59] the most popular quotes the preachers
[7:01] like to use which is the 70th week of
[7:03] daniel 1961.
[7:05] here brother ram said it was a great
[7:06] woman beautiful looking
[7:08] in real highly royals like purple
[7:11] again notice how brother ram said i
[7:13] don't know
[7:15] so ask yourself how can the preachers
[7:16] today know
[7:18] this woman was kamala harris if brother
[7:20] branham did not know was a literal woman
[7:22] let's listen to the quote
[7:25] now
[7:26] i predicted and said i saw a great woman
[7:28] stand up beautiful looking dressed in
[7:31] real highly royal black purple and i got
[7:34] little princes down here she was a great
[7:37] ruler in the united states perhaps the
[7:39] catholic church
[7:41] a woman some woman i don't know it'll be
[7:43] the catholic church
[7:45] i don't know i can't say the only thing
[7:47] i've seen i've seen the woman that was
[7:48] off
[7:51] now we'll listen to our fifth and last
[7:54] quote it's from 1963
[7:56] here in the sermon once more
[7:58] brother brahm said the woman of the
[8:00] sixth vision was not an actual woman
[8:03] yet many preachers and message believers
[8:05] will say it's kamala harris
[8:07] and consider that this quote is even
[8:09] after the opening of the seven seals
[8:12] which everyone knows was a great time of
[8:14] further progressive revelation that god
[8:16] was giving to brother branham
[8:18] and again ask why aren't preachers
[8:20] saying what the tapes say regarding this
[8:22] quote
[8:23] let's listen to the quote
[8:26] and how that that permit women to vote
[8:29] in doing so that would elect the wrong
[8:31] president
[8:34] and in this would be a woman stand up
[8:36] that would govern the united
[8:39] not actually a woman but a church
[8:45] then i've seen her with nothing but
[8:47] ashes
[8:50] it's going to happen
[8:57] time will vindicate who is right about
[9:00] the sixth vision
[9:03] time will be the great vindicator of who
[9:06] is right about the sixth vision
[9:08] proving who is presuming and jumping to
[9:10] conclusions in error
[9:13] and proving who is being humble and
[9:15] waiting upon the lord to fulfill his
[9:16] word
[9:18] in humility i just want to say i've seen
[9:20] this air of jumping to conclusions on
[9:22] numerous occasions
[9:24] since i came into the message at the end
[9:26] of 2001. here's a few examples
[9:29] in 2009 and 2010 some message preachers
[9:32] were saying obama was the antichrist so
[9:35] the rapture would happen sometime during
[9:37] his presidency
[9:39] then in 2015 some message preachers were
[9:41] saying the rapture would happen because
[9:43] of the numerous blood moons
[9:45] and the pope's visit to the united
[9:46] states
[9:48] in 2018 some message preachers were
[9:50] saying god would return to the jews
[9:52] because 2018 marked the 70th year since
[9:56] israel was officially recognized as an
[9:58] independent nation
[10:00] which was 1948.
[10:02] if god returned to the jews then the
[10:04] gentile rapture would have to happen
[10:05] first
[10:06] so they were basically predicting the
[10:08] rapture in 2018.
[10:10] then in 2021 after the presidential
[10:13] inauguration in january
[10:16] some message preachers were saying the
[10:17] sixth vision was fulfilled
[10:20] and they were only waiting for the
[10:21] seventh vision the destruction or
[10:23] bombing of the united states to be
[10:24] fulfilled
[10:26] and then in this year
[10:27] march of 2022 about three months ago i
[10:31] heard a very influential message
[10:32] preacher say the rapture was only days
[10:34] away
[10:35] and then he said the rapture was only
[10:37] hours away
[10:38] because of the war in ukraine
[10:41] so it's obvious friends that message
[10:43] preachers or message believers are just
[10:44] going to keep making predictions every
[10:46] year about the coming of the lord
[10:48] and it's likely one year they will get
[10:50] it right
[10:51] because jesus said no man knows the day
[10:53] or the hour jesus never said no man
[10:55] wouldn't know the month week or year of
[10:57] the rapture
[10:59] but again we just want to be humble we
[11:01] don't want to jump to conclusions
[11:03] we want to avoid making presumptions
[11:05] and avoid trying to make ourselves seem
[11:07] more spiritual or make ourselves
[11:09] something that we're not we're not
[11:11] prophets
[11:12] and by god's grace i'll close by sharing
[11:15] the quote from brother branham that i
[11:16] think is the best indicator about when
[11:18] the rapture will occur
[11:20] as it relates to the time of the squeeze
[11:22] or the time period right before the
[11:24] rapture when the beast system is
[11:26] preparing to lay down its mark it's from
[11:28] spoken word as original seed 1962
[11:31] this is when brother brahm said the holy
[11:33] spirit told him to pick up his pen and
[11:34] write and so the main indicator is that
[11:37] the united states government will change
[11:38] laws
[11:39] and force the bride to stop preaching
[11:42] let's listen to the quote
[11:45] i believe sunday
[11:47] the real bride of christ
[11:50] will be
[11:54] forced to stop preaching
[11:56] the word
[11:57] of god
[11:59] the bible prophesies of it in
[12:00] revelations 13 16 if you want to put it
[12:02] down
[12:04] denominations will force it to stop or
[12:07] take its mark
[12:11] then when the lamb
[12:13] will take his bride and judge the
[12:16] for this
[12:20] in closing
[12:23] i hope this video was a blessing to help
[12:25] others be more balanced and patient
[12:27] regarding the fulfillment of the seven
[12:29] major visions and really every prophecy
[12:32] that brother random gave us
[12:34] if you have any questions concerns or
[12:36] testimonies about this video please
[12:38] contact me
[12:41] god bless you and may jesus christ be
[12:43] the desire of your heart
