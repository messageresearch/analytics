[0:00] greetings friends in the mattress name
[0:02] of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of
[0:05] this video is to examine and understand
[0:07] the quotation from the church age book
[0:09] that says brother Branham has the power
[0:11] of infallibility
[0:14] this quote is found on page 328 in
[0:16] chapter 9 of the church age book
[0:18] this video has six points I want to make
[0:21] about this quotation and let's start by
[0:23] reading the quotation quote on the basis
[0:26] of human behavior alone anyone knows
[0:28] that where there are many people there
[0:31] is even divided opinion on lesser points
[0:33] of a major doctor in which they all hold
[0:35] together who then will have the power of
[0:38] infallibility which is to be restored in
[0:41] this last age for this last age is going
[0:43] to go back to manifesting the pure word
[0:45] bride that means we will have the word
[0:48] once again as it was perfectly given and
[0:50] perfectly understood in the days of Paul
[0:52] I will tell you who will have it it will
[0:55] be a prophet as thoroughly Vindicated or
[0:57] even more thoroughly Vindicated than was
[0:59] any prophet in all the ages from Enoch
[1:02] to this day because this man will of
[1:05] necessity have the Capstone prophetic
[1:07] Ministry and God will show him forth he
[1:10] won't need to speak for himself God will
[1:12] speak for him by the voice of the sign
[1:14] amen end quote
[1:17] Point number one is that in the context
[1:19] it seems the author of this statement
[1:22] which was brother Lee Vale was referring
[1:24] to brother branham's Doctrine
[1:26] meaning brother Brown's Doctrine was
[1:28] exactly the same as Saint Paul's
[1:31] the first sentence of this paragraph
[1:32] refers to Major Doctrine
[1:35] and then the second sentence says
[1:37] brother Branham had the power of
[1:38] infallibility note also on the previous
[1:41] page the author Lee Vale said quote he
[1:45] is not Jesus Christ he is not the Son of
[1:48] God end quote so the context is clear
[1:50] the veil is not exalting brother Branham
[1:53] to equality with Jesus Christ the
[1:56] context is brother Brown's Doctrine was
[1:58] infallibly the same as Saint Paul's and
[2:01] I agree with that because brother Vale
[2:03] said major Doctrine and brother Vale did
[2:05] not say every Doctrine because we all
[2:07] know brother bran was not infallible on
[2:10] every single doctrine that he taught but
[2:12] he was infallible on the major doctrines
[2:14] because he spoke them with thus saith
[2:16] the Lord and they agree 100 percent with
[2:18] Saint Paul's Doctrine
[2:20] the second point I want to make about
[2:22] this statement is that there's other
[2:23] quotes from Brother Branham where he
[2:25] says I'm not infallible and he said it
[2:27] was one of the most awfulest things a
[2:29] person could do was to make brother
[2:30] Branham infallible as my previous videos
[2:33] has shown
[2:34] if you need that quote let me know also
[2:36] brother Bram said he was powerless which
[2:39] is the opposite of the definition of the
[2:41] absolute because the word absolute means
[2:43] Unlimited in power
[2:44] so brother man never made himself
[2:46] infallible brother Branham never made
[2:48] himself the absolute the only way to
[2:50] understand this statement from the
[2:51] church age book about the power of
[2:53] infallibility that makes sense is that
[2:55] brother Brandon would speak with thus
[2:57] saith the Lord which is infallible like
[2:59] every other true Prophet who ever lived
[3:02] like Moses Jeremiah Ezekiel and Saint
[3:04] Paul
[3:05] brother Brandon's major doctrines were
[3:07] taught infallibly and he spoke them with
[3:09] us saith the Lord such as water baptism
[3:12] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[3:14] godhead and the fact there's only one
[3:16] person in the godhead
[3:18] the baptism of the Holy Ghost as the
[3:20] third work of Grace and marriage and
[3:22] divorce to name a few these major
[3:25] doctrines all agree 100 with Saint
[3:27] Paul's writings in the New Testament and
[3:30] of course all the other New Testament
[3:31] writers
[3:32] the third point I want to make about
[3:34] this quote is that brother Ram's
[3:35] accusers such as believe the sign use
[3:38] this quote to make it seem brother
[3:40] Adam's followers make him infallible
[3:42] which is not true about the faithful
[3:44] followers of brother Ram's teachings but
[3:46] it is true about the headquarters of the
[3:49] tape church or tape worship movement
[3:51] located in Jeffersonville Indiana USA
[3:55] it's clear brother Ram's accusers cannot
[3:58] understand the context of this quote but
[4:00] the context again remember was Major
[4:02] Doctrine and the only way we know those
[4:04] major doctrines are infallible is that
[4:06] brother random spoke them with thus
[4:08] saith the Lord and they agree 100 with
[4:11] Saint Paul Saint John Saint Peter and
[4:13] the rest of the New Testament writers
[4:16] a fourth point is that as far as I know
[4:18] brother Branham never said he was more
[4:20] Vindicated than any other prophet in all
[4:22] the ages so to me this seems the veil
[4:25] added this thought and then this
[4:27] statement by Lee Vale would seem to
[4:29] imply that brother Vale thought brother
[4:31] Branham would be raptured and not die
[4:34] like Elijah was raptured and did not die
[4:36] and Enoch was raptured and did not die
[4:39] but we all know brother Branham died on
[4:41] December 24th 1965.
[4:45] notice in this quote by Brother Vale he
[4:47] said more thoroughly Vindicated than was
[4:50] any prophet in all the ages from Enoch
[4:52] to this day so why did Brother Vale say
[4:55] Enoch I don't know but it seems brother
[4:57] Vale thought brother Brandon would be
[4:58] raptured and not taste death like Enoch
[5:01] was raptured and did not die
[5:03] a fifth point is that Lee Vale did not
[5:06] say other than Jesus in this quotation
[5:09] and what I mean is that brother Vale did
[5:11] not write more thoroughly Vindicated
[5:13] than was any prophet in all ages other
[5:16] than Jesus or except for Jesus
[5:19] so this proves brother Vale in my
[5:21] opinion was wrong he should have added
[5:23] any profit in all the ages except for
[5:26] the Lord Jesus Christ
[5:28] and that's because no Prophet could be
[5:30] more Vindicated than the Lord Jesus
[5:31] Christ because every Prophet before
[5:33] Jesus wrote about Jesus prophesying of
[5:36] him and then every Prophet after Jesus
[5:38] spoke of Jesus and all the times Jesus
[5:41] fulfilled the word of God so no one
[5:43] could be more Vindicated than Jesus
[5:45] Christ and I feel it was wrong that
[5:47] brother Vale left out those words except
[5:49] for the Lord Jesus or other than the
[5:52] Lord Jesus Christ
[5:53] and Friends voice of God or
[5:55] Jeffersonville or Branham Tabernacle
[5:57] does the same thing as I'll show later
[5:59] they openly say brother and was the
[6:01] greatest prophet of all time
[6:03] and they failed to say except for Jesus
[6:05] or other than the Lord Jesus Christ
[6:07] which shows their exalting brother
[6:09] random to being equal with Jesus Christ
[6:11] or maybe greater than Jesus Christ which
[6:13] is an awful sin the sixth and final
[6:16] point is that this topic naturally leads
[6:19] into the discussion on the church age
[6:21] book validity
[6:23] which I will cover in a future video
[6:24] Lord willing and if you recall from my
[6:27] top 10 books I've ever read video the
[6:29] church age book is the second most
[6:31] influential book I've ever read in my
[6:33] entire life I love the church age book
[6:35] but it must be rightly divided just like
[6:38] all the brothers sermons since Lee Vale
[6:41] added some content to the church age
[6:43] book
[6:44] if you have any questions concerns or
[6:46] testimonies about this video please
[6:47] contact me
[6:49] God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[6:51] the desire of your heart
