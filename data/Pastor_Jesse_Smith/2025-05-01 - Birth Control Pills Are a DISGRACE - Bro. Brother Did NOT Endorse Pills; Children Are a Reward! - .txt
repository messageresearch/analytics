TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] Would you endorse birth control? No, I can't endorse it. No, sir. Greetings, friends, in the mattress name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of this video is to answer a viewer's question. Is using birth control pills a sin? And the answer is yes. Birth control pills cause human deletions? And of course, I'm using that word on this platform on purpose rather than another word. Birth control pills prevent implantation of an already fertilized OAM. Friends, the pro-life movement has a lot of strong research on this subject. I'll leave two citations in the description if you want to check it out. One's from Human Life International. Another one is from Eternal Perspective Ministries. And the science is undeniable. Birth control pills prevent implantation of an already fertilized OAM. People I know have read the fine print on a birth control label and it does say that it does say that the pills can prevent the fertilized OAM from implanting. So taking birth control pills is the same as actually having a human deletion at a human deletion clinic. I thought I'd start with the scripture, friends. Then we'll look at quotes from God's prophet, brother William Marin Brham. The scripture says in Psalm 139:13-14, "For thou has possessed my reigns, thou has covered me in my mother's womb." So God's spirit is right around the fertilized oam in every mother's womb. What an amazing act of almighty God to protect that child. And then David said, "I'll praise thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. Marvelous are thy works and that my soul knoweth right well. So God creates a human being. All the billions and billions maybe trillions of humans he's created. They are all fearfully and wonderfully made. Jeremiah 15 says, "Before I formed thee in the belly, I knew thee." So predestination tells us God knew us before he formed us. He knew us in the mind of Christ according to Ephesians 1:4 before the foundation of the world. Exodus 4:11 even says, "Who has made a man's mouth? Who makes him mute, deaf or seeing or blind? Is it not I, the Lord?" So, we know there's no reason to delete a human life. If there's any defect in the child, a Christian's attitude and a Christian's heart should be to receive that child because the Lord did it for a purpose. God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as saith the scripture. Galatians 5:21 says, "Envings, murders, drunkenness, revelings, they that do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God." So people that willingly take birth control pills that cause human deletions will not inherit the kingdom of God if they do it on purpose. Now, if they're ignorant and if they have the Holy Ghost, the Holy Ghost will guide them into all truth to show them their wrongs, and they'll repent. They'll feel really, really awful for any possible human deletions and they'll want to get right with God and never take them again by the grace of God. And then Revelation 22:14 and 15 says, "Those that have the right to enter into the gates of the New Jerusalem, the city, are blessed because they kept the command such as not deleting human life." And it includes dogs, sorcerers, whoreongers, and murderers. And of course that connects to birth control pills and the women that take them. So that's a good scriptural background there by God's grace. Let's go through some quotes from God's prophet, brother William Marian Brandham. In the first quote from 1954, brother Brandham says, "It's a baby as soon as the germ is fertilized." He said, "It's just as harmful to take the life of a little baby that ain't 2 months old as it is to pull a pistol and delete a man down in coldblooded deletion or murder." Brother Ram says, "I am against birth control. What God sends, God will take care of it." That's the truth. My parents had six children. God took care of us. I have eight children going on nine. God has taken care of us by his amazing grace. Let's listen to the quote from God's prophet. A baby's a baby when it's formed. the very first germ in the mother's womb. It's a baby. I'm firmly against birth control. See? Yes, sir. For Lord, it's just as much harm to to take the life of a little baby that ain't two months old as it is to pull a pistol and shoot a man down in cold blood murder. Yes, sir. I'm against birth control. What God sends, God will take care of. Second, in 1954, later about 7 months later, December 54, Brother Ram says it's a disgrace. Birth control or practicing birth control is a disgrace. Let's listen to the quote. You're not long ago, I met a woman that has committed some of those cases. Practicing birth control, that's the disgrace in America. This may kind of sting you a little bit, but watch it. what they'll do today. They used to they make fun of a man that's got four, five, six, seven children. Say it's a disgrace. It used to not be a disgrace. Then in 1956, Brother Ram said, "Children make you happy." And of course, there's lots of good quotes on how Brother Bram showed that children make parents happy. Brother Ram says, "It's a great duty to God for a woman to carry children and take care of children. And throughout all the eternities, you'll enjoy the blessings of God. If you bring a child into the world and raise it, right? What a promise. Throughout all eternity, you'll remember that you brought a child into the world and raised it to the glory of Jesus Christ. Let's listen to the quote. I think of sometimes how mothers will refuse to raise children, bring up children, and young women practice birth control, buy little dogs, and lead them around. And you only realize, lady, that just about 20 years of your life that you have that God's laed to you that you're going to be able to do this great duty for God. Do you know your child might be a modern Phiney or or something like that? Do you realize just 20 by about 20 years of your life as as long as you you'll be able to raise children and all through the eternities you'll enjoy the blessings of God if you bring a child in this world and raise it right that star that's shining out in glory and you'll be associated with it. See and then to refuse to raise the little fellas because you'd rather take your running around and carrying on. That's ridiculous. You shouldn't do that. And now don't do it. No sir, don't you do it. You be a happy person. Mothers of old, they love to raise children, but oh, this modern American day that we're living in now, I tell you, our nation is simply polluted. Now, skipping ahead to July 30th, 1964, morning service, questions and answers, part three. They asked Brother Brandham about birth control, and he says there's only one form of birth control that's acceptable. And brother Brandham says it's the number of days that a woman's not fertile. Some people call this the calendar method. Brother Bram says that's the right way of doing birth control. Husband and wife should not come together during the time the wife is fertile. It's amazing what God revealed to his prophet even back in 1964. And brother Ram admitted there at the end of the quote that some people would lie to him. They try to lie to him and say that they needed to take birth control pills when they didn't need to take it. Thank God for the spirit of truth, for the Holy Ghost. Let's listen to the quote. How do you feel about birth control? I had some of that on the interviews this morning. I'd rather talk personally with with you on those things. See, on those things there cause these words and things that I have to say that I'd rather say it if a husband and wife and there is a possibility of it being done in the right way. I'd say it to for general. There is so many days in a woman's life that she's not fertile. You understand? All right. Why? Now, there's sometimes a a child would kill a woman if she had a baby to kill her. You want to watch that, too. See? So, just be real careful about that. See? See, that's bringing life to what you're what you're in the earth to do. If your wife is sickly and a child would kill her, uh I I wouldn't do it. I don't think the Lord wants you to do it. And you you come to me personally on them things. Have it on private interview. Let me talk to you personally. See, now I can feel see each individual. I can tell where they're lying to me or not. See, they're telling me different things. I'd rather see. See, because you put out like this, you don't know it's because he's individual and things like that. I can tell it whether they're telling the truth or not. See, the next quote is again from questions and answers, but it's part four from 1964, the evening service. They asked Brother Brandham, "Is it wrong to limit the family? Did it mean practice complete birth control?" And brother Brandham said, "I already answered that, of course, to each individual." So, Brother Bam already answered this about limiting family size. The only right way to do it is through the calendar method. And I think it's important to say that a lot of people maybe in America perhaps they limit their family size because of fear, maybe selfishness, pride. And it's sad, friends. Someone told me this one time. I think I read it in a book where they asked when in history did believers mutilate themselves to limit their family size only in this Leoian church age. It's so sad. No wonder Jesus had no commendations for the Leosian church age. As brother Brandham said, a lot of people who claim to believe the message of the hour limit their family size on purpose for sinful reasons. Not for the health of the mother, but for sinful reasons. But of course, God can forgive the repentant ones. But let's listen to the quote by God's grace. Is this day wrong to limit your family? Did it mean practice complete birth control? I answered that of course to each individual. And the last and final quote is from that same sermon question and answers part 464. They asked brother Ram, "Would you endorse birth control?" No, I can't endorse it. No, sir. Let's listen to the quote. What would you endorse birth control? I don't know. I can't endorse it. No, sir. In closing, friends, I hope this video has been a blessing by the grace of God. Remember friends, just with baby deletions surgically done at a baby deletion clinic, almost 70 million children have lost their lives. It has to grieve the heart of God tremendously. And that's just in America. That's not in other countries. And that's just what has been reported. Now, on top of that, add up all the baby deletions that have happened through birth control pills. My goodness, how much human deletion has happened because of selfishness, fear, pride, or other sins. But friends, God is merciful. He's quick to forgive if a person is truly repentant. There is grace in the Lord Jesus Christ. He'll change your heart to the point you'll never want to do anything like that ever again and teach your children or your grandchildren to never do such a thing as that. Let's end on a positive note. Psalm 127 verses 3 4 and 5 say, "Lo, children are inheritage of the Lord and the fruit of the womb is his reward. Children are reward." And the word heritage means God's property. Children are God's property. That's why we let them develop and receive them when God sends them. Verse four, as arrows are in the hand of a mighty man, so are children of the youth. So a godly man's children are weapons against the enemy. We see that with our children. They're so soft and tender. They love the Lord. They pray. They sing. They play instruments. They are God's arrows against the enemy. And verse 5, happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them. They shall not be ashamed. They shall speak with the enemies in the gate. So God will raise up our godly children to be godly influences in the community by the grace of God. Praise the Lord for natural children and praise the Lord for spiritual children. Those who are baptized with the Holy Ghost. And that should be our prayer as parents that our children in the natural will receive the spiritual birth of the baptism of the Holy Ghost which only comes to predestinated sons and daughters of God. As Galatians 4 tells us. Galatians 4:6 says, "And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts, crying, aba father." So I believe if someone has the spirit of Christ, they'll cry, "Aba, father to God their father." And then they'll have the right attitude towards children, not to limit their family size unless there's some reason the mother can't have children, but to just accept the children as God sends them. If you have any questions, concerns, or testimonies about this video, please contact me. God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart. Very happy to be here this afternoon and again in defense of the gospel of Jesus Christ to bring the good tidings, the good news that Jesus raised from the dead, living among man today, his church. The same Jesus that was yesterday will be today and forever is never failed. [Music]
