TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] so we've got things here in the scripture that must be fulfilled and that is one of the things this boy caught to come greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ are there Bible verses yet to be fulfilled before the pre-tribulation Rapture of the Bride of Jesus Christ I believe the answer is yes in this video by God's grace I'll show five scriptures that I believe still need to be fulfilled before the Rapture can take place and we'll also go through numerous quotes from God's Prophet late William brandham hi friends I'm Jesse Smith pastor bride of Christ Fellowship here in akan Ohio USA and I defend the original Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ that he revealed to St Paul then had to restore through Martin Luther John Wesley and the late Prophet William Maran Branham who lived from 1909 to 1965 I also defend brother bram's Godly Christian character this week I was studying and I came across a quote from 1962 the spoken words Original Seed and brother Braham said we have scripture yet to be fulfilled i' had forgotten about this quote so I wanted to make a video about this topic by the grace of God over the last few years I've heard numerous preachers say there are no scriptures left to be fulfilled that never sat well with me to me it's illogical how can we still be here if there's no more scriptures to be fulfilled How can there be no scriptures being fulfilled at this current time that never made any sense to me and yet the preachers claim to be using quotes from God's Prophet brother brandham so I had my thoughts and my opinions and I've kind of put this up on the Shelf but then this week I came across this quote where brother BR plainly says there are scriptures yet to be fulfilled and that caused me to put these scriptures and quotes together so hopefully this video is a Blessing by the grace of God I like to begin with two quotes from God's Prophet brother brandham where he says he doesn't think there's one thing left in the prophetic word that would hinder the coming of the Lord Jesus the first quote is from 1956 and the second quotee is from 1964 I'll begin with the hear ye hymn quotee from 1956 here brother Ram says there isn't one thing left as I see in the prophetic word one thing left or one thing hindering the coming of the Lord Jesus not one thing left in the Bible everything has been fulfilled now think of this friends 6 years later 1962 brother Braham said there was scripture to be fulfilled he said it was the boycott scriptures and again the fact that we have quotes on both sides of this topic prove the insanity of people who say every word on brother Ram's tapes is thus say the Lord they're Anointed with a lying demonic Spirit but anyways let's listen to this quote 1956 hear ye himym there isn't one thing left because I see in the in the prophetic word one thing left a one thing hindering the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ this very hour not one thing Less in the Bible everything has been fulfilled waiting now for the coming of the Lord Jesus next let's look at the quote from The Trial 1964 brother Ram says I don't don't see one thing to hinder him from coming right now everything is setting just exactly right now for his coming now this is interesting this is 2 years after brother Ram said there was scripture yet to be fulfilled and of course we'll show some more quotes soon but let's listen to this one a trial 1964 and I believe court I want to say something to you this afternoon that I don't see one thing to hander him from coming right now that the world if I had time I could prove it to you is setting perfectly even by names and position the way it's supposed to be setting when he comes when is the hour I know not no one knows but he said when these comes to pass look up now I want to look at two quotes both from 1965 where brother Bram says there is scripture coming to pass in 1965 and there's yet scripture to be fulfilled so let's start with April 2465 proving his word brother baram said we're seeing it done it's fulfilling a scripture that has to come to pass brother talking about a message sweeping to bring the people out of denominational conditions back to the original gospel the Pentecostal Faith the scripture of course was Malachi 45 and 6 turning the hearts of the people back to the fathers the apostolic fathers so notice here in April 1965 brother Ram said it's fulfilling scripture and we're seeing it done so brother Ram said he was seeing scriptures fulfilled in April 1965 of course this is still happening last year I baptized I ized 17 former Amish believers who have left the Amish community and come to this glorious light of the message of the hour I'm seeing their hearts turned back to the original Apostolic Pentecostal Faith by the grace of God we're seeing it still today let's listen to the quote because immediately after that message the Earth is to be burnt with fire and the righteous walk out upon the ashes of the wicked so what never happened in the time of John we've got to have a message sweep back and bring the people out of all these denominational conditions back to the original genuine Pentecostal faith and we're seeing it done it's fulfilling of a scripture that has to come to pass all scriptures must be fulfilled how many more that we could apply it would take me longer in my time up now to show but you understand these things that has got to happen just exactly like this to Abraham's children just as he promised next is from August 15th 1965 knoweth it not brother Braham said as far as I know I don't see anything to hinder at this time the com of the Lord Jesus outside of the Readiness of his church so here he makes it seem like there's one thing left to be fulfilled the Readiness of the church remember this is just 4 months after he said he was seeing scripture come to pass the hearts turning back to the apostolic fathers and then this quote four months later says there is something hindering the coming of the lord it's the Readiness of the church let's listen to the quote let's think of the lady AA Church age and it's condition today as far as I know I don't see anything to hinder that this time uh the coming of the Lord Jesus outside of the Readiness of his church I want to share one more quote I love this quote from identification 1963 it's January 23rd brother makes a very insightful wise quote by saying everything that's pertaining to prophecy about the second coming of the Lord could take place within an hour and he says this in numerous occasions but I like but I'd like to play this one here just like when Jesus died on the cross there were so many scriptures fulfilled there in just the three or 4 days of his arrest death burial and resurrection and so I love this quote because God can fulfill his word very quickly as well no man knows the day or the hour God will fulfill it just as he determined so let's listen to the quote from identification January 23rd 1963 it's been a great time I've been preaching these strong messages about his coming and trying to lay out the the possibilities and the hour that we're now living in and how that everything to my opinion my humble opinion is just in condition for the coming of the lord The Rapture the next thing and all all that lacks could happen within an hour I believe many I don't know just how many but several of the outstanding prophecies pertaining to the Fulfillment of the coming of the Messiah and what he would do was fulfilled in the last seven hours at the cross now let's look at five Bible verses I believe still need to be fulfilled let's start with Revelation 13: 16 brother R plainly said this is the boycott scriptures that need to be fulfilled let's read Revelation 13:16 and he causeth all both small and great rich and poor free and bond to receive a mark in their right hand or in their foreheads Revelation 13 is a chapter where we see two different versions of the Beast the Beast out of the sea which was Imperial Pagan Rome and then the Beast out of the land which is the United States so brother R uses Revelation 13:16 to say there is scripture left to be fulfilled he says this in spoken word is original seed March 18th 1962 brother BR was reading the pick up your pen and write portion he said I believe someday the real bride of Christ will be forced to stop preaching the word of God the Bible prophesies of it in Revelation 13:16 if you want to put it down so friends despite all the things that have happened over these years with Co and everything we as the Bride of Jesus Christ have never been stopped from preaching the word of God so that shows there's still a prophecy yet to be fulfilled let's listen to the quote I believe someday the real bride of Christ will be forced to St stop preaching the word of God the Bible prophesies of it in Revelations 13:16 if you want to put it down denominations will force it to stop or take its Mark then when the lamb will take his bride and judge the for this and then a few paragraphs after that brother Ram said this kind of church will be put out of operation as far as they know it's at that time that Jesus will appear and he'll show which is bride and which is not then he says all the words that's been written must be fulfilled Jesus said so so we've got things here in the scripture that must be fulfilled and that is one of the things this boycott to come so here's the quote that shows it most plainly there are scriptures yet to be fulfilled before the coming of the Lord so this quote stirred up my heart this week let's listen to the quote remember there will be such a denominational Gathering pretty soon it'll be terrific and they will bring themselves together into this Federation of churches and then this kind of a church will be put out of operation as far as they know it's at that time that Jesus will appear and he will show which is brother bride amen which is not and remember Christian friends I'm a man I can make mistakes but God being God cannot make a mistake all the words that's been written must be fulfilled Jesus said so so we've got things here in the scripture that must be fulfilled and that is one of the things this boyau to come but before this boycot can come of the marking of the there has to be a seed sold for God to take a church out of it you understand now second let's look at Matthew 24 4-8 I believe these are scriptures that still need to be fulfilled and this was quickly to me of course during the covid years of 2020 2021 Matthew 24:6 Jesus said ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars see that you be not troubled for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet for Nations should Rise Against nation and Kingdom against Kingdom and there should be famines and pestilences and earthquakes in diverse places all these are the beginning of Sorrows so Matthew 24:7 said pestilences that's what I believe the covid-19 pandemic was it was a pestilence so that was a scripture that needed to be fulfilled and of course we have wars we have Israel against Hamas we have Russia and Ukraine so these scriptures are being fulfilled wars and rumors of wars all the these are the beginning of Sorrows so that's the second scripture that must be fulfilled the third scripture is Jeremiah 31:10 and there's many Old Testament verses like this God is still Gathering the faithful Jewish Remnant back to the Holy Land Jeremiah 31:10 says here the word of the Lord oh ye nations and declare it in the Isles of far in the aisles of far off and say he that scattereth Israel will gather him and keep him as a Shepherd doth his flock last time I looked it up the population of Israel was about 8 million but remember God only needs 144,000 of them to be virgins to the word of God that's what the Bible called them in Revelation 14:4 Israel was those which were not defiled with women for these are virgins Jesus will stand with them the 144,000 on Mount Zion according to Revelation 14:1 over the years I've seen numerous news articles from Christian news sources about Jews from Nations all over the world coming back to the Holy Land to live most recently I saw a video about Jews from Ethiopia returning to the Homeland so God's people Israel are still coming back to the Holy Land the fourth verse is 2 Peter chapter 3 verse 9 the Lord is not slack concerning his promise as some will as some men count slackness but as longsuffering to us word not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance so so this is a prophecy that God is bringing people to repentance as more time passes the longsuffering of God is allowing time to move on especially for the Gentile dispensation in order that Souls might be saved and again last year I saw at least 17 former Amish people be baptized get saved in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so this is fulfilling the prophecy of God's longsuffering to save the Gentiles and I think there's been an estimate there's over 300,000 Amish communities that have never heard the gospel the message of Jesus Christ so it seems like the gospel needs to go to them as well so they get a chance to hear it and then Fifth and finally there's numerous verses that kind of tie in with the fourth verse but Malachi 4:5 and6 says the hearts must be turned back to the Fathers as the quote from brother brandham said and we have Revelation 10 8-11 the finished mystery must be prophesied again around the world to the Gentiles this ties in with Luke 21:4 where Jesus said Jerusalem will be trotten down to the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled so we're still in the time of the Gentiles we're still in the time of the Gentile Church ages where Gentiles are being saved then Matthew 2414 Jesus said this Gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations and then shall the End come so again all these verses go together Revelation 10 8-1 John had to eat the book and prophesy again to every Kindred Nation people tongue and tribe and here Jesus says in Matthew 24:14 the Gospel must be preached into all the world so not every nation has had the gospel of the end time message preached to them there's many languages that still don't have the message in their language the first time I visit voice of God Recordings about 10 years ago one of the workers said there were still numerous languages they need to translate brother Ram's books into so people of those languages can have a chance to hear the word of God the go Gospel of the Kingdom so these scriptures make me think the end cannot come until all these nations hear the preaching of brother brandham and of course those in the fful ministry who continue to preach the same thing brother brandham did the finished mystery of God in closing friends hope this video was a blessing by the grace of God I'm sure there's numerous other scriptures too that need to be fulfilled before the second coming of our Lord Jesus Christ but again remember these verses could all be fulfilled very quickly just like when Jesus came gave his life as the Lamb of God as a sacrifice so many verses were fulfilled in a very short time period so it always encourages us to watch and pray and be ready brother BR said preach like he's going to come in 10 years but live like he's coming today he said that in questions and answers on the seals 1963 lets usen to the quote should evangelists continue on the field in this hour of course what they mean certainly by all means don't change the thing amen if Jesus is coming in the morning Preach Today like if it going to be 10 years from today but live like it's going to be at this hour don't don't get scrupled up now that's what I'm trying to warn you about see just don't be odd peculiar don't change nothing but if you're doing something wrong or doing evil repent come back to God continue on your Evangelistic service just as you always did if you're building a house put it on up Jesus comes tomorrow you be found faithful as the duty if you're building your church go on put it up I'd rather be putting my money in something like that and be found within my pocket see so just just keep on continue as you are everybody understand now continue right on just go right on as you are so please reach out share any scriptures with me that you think need to be fulfilled perhaps I can make a part two on this video I believe it's so important to know that we're in the Fulfillment of scripture right now we're the wise virgin we've got our lamps trimmed we're going out to meet him there's another scripture we could put in there as being fulfilled right now of course Malachi 45 and6 our hearts are being turned back to the apostolic fathers and Revelation 1316 is the verse I've shared with our church numerous times over the years that's the sign in my opinion my humble opinion that the Rapture will be on when the United States government starts shutting down the bride from preaching the word of God just as brother M taught and pick up your pen and write so let's be ready friends let's watch and pray Jesus will appear to all those that love is appearing as Paul Paul said not to me only but unto all them also that love is appearing in 2 Timothy 4:8 if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
