TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] greetings friends in the matches name of the lord jesus christ the purpose of this video is to defend william branham as a true prophet of god despite his disobedience to the vision god gave him about the brown bear i will show 10 undeniable bible truths about conditional visions conditional prophecies and also conditional prophetic promises to nations and individuals that can fail due to someone's disobedience i'll also show six important observations about the brown bear vision that must be considered before making a judgment about brother branham the truth of this matter is that it is undeniable that some of god's promises and prophecies whether revealed through a vision or through the written word or through hearing god's audible voice or through hearing a preacher in a church service are conditional and require human obedience to come to pass i conclude after much bible study and prayer that william branham's thus saith the lord brown bear vision was conditional while other thus saith the lord visions and prophecies given to him were unconditional please do not prematurely condem brother branham for disobeying a vision before first examining yourself as second corinthians 13 verse 5 says to see if you have recently disobeyed a conditional word from the lord whether delivered to you through a dream a vision through a preacher preaching to you or any other form of delivery the obvious conclusion is that we are all guilty of disobeying conditional words from the lord at some point in our lives and also remember that we all sin every single day which is disobedience to the vision or word of the lord recall jesus's words in john 8 7 he that is without sin among you let him first cast a stone here's the outline for this video first we'll briefly review why brother branham was a true prophet next we'll refute the brown bear accusations third i'll give brief responses to other accusations and lastly i'll give questions for brother branham's accusers that they either cannot or will not answer honestly briefly reviewing the proof brother branham was a true prophet friends i believe there's undeniable proof brother branham was a genuine prophet of god i summed up this six-fold evidence on my sixth youtube video called three prophecies of william branham the six-fold evidence is first live a godly life of holiness second teach the word of god in its purity third have converts to christ as fruit of his ministry fourth reveal secrets from the bible that were previously hidden fifth have the anointing of the holy ghost for supernatural signs and prophecies and sixth foretell the future in the name of the lord for time's sake i'm going to speak a little bit on the fourth fifth and six proofs the fourth proof about revealing secrets from the bible previously hidden this requirement is found in amos chapter 3 verse 7. brother branham was used by god to reveal the seven seals which were the voices of the seven thunders and they were not plagiarized from clarence larkin or charles tay's russell which if the lord is willing i'll make a detailed video about that i'm actually studying about that right now brother branham also revealed the twelve bible-defined mysteries such as the rapture the baptism of the holy ghost and more six of these bible-defined mysteries were spoken with thus saith the lord no other preacher even comes close to this and in fact i've never heard a preacher other than brother branham speak a mystery of god with thus saith the lord and if i'm not aware of it please share it with me i never heard billy graham say thus saith the lord nor have i heard any of the following preachers give uh thus saith the lord with a genuine bible mystery revealed such as benny hinn td jakes joel olsteen john macarthur charles swindle rick warren charles or andy stanley john piper or timothy keller brother branham is the only one who meets this fourth requirement to reveal secrets previously hidden the fifth proof is anointing for supernatural works according to first chronicles 16 verse 22 acts 5 verse 12 acts 10 verse 38 mark 16 verses 17 and 18 and john 16 verse 13. william branham had many supernatural signs and i've met two individuals who experienced this both have passed away already their names were florence humes healed of tuberculosis in 1955 and tom brown who had his thoughts and intents of his heart supernaturally discerned by brother branham in a private meeting in which brother branham gave him the answers to his questions before he even asked his questions by the holy ghost anointing brother branham foretold many healings such as florence humes and marilyn hickey and you can watch your testimony on youtube and there's numerous other people that have had healings foretold by brother branham and these prophecies were on tape and you can listen to them for free on youtube brother branham's ministry produced many amazing healings such as congressman upshaw being healed and coming out of his wheelchair also georgie carter's healing from tuberculosis after being bedridden for eight years just to name a few by the same holy ghost anointing brother branham foretold sister chicarian's death in 1965 god's prophets sometimes foretell deaths such as elijah foretelling king ahaziah's death in second kings chapter 1 verses 1 through 18. brother branham had a worldwide healing and discernment ministry noted by historians historians say brother branham's healing ministry was legendary as god used it to initiate the post-world war ii healing revival most notably by the dictionary of pentecostal and charismatic movements and this was written in 1988 quote the person universally acknowledged as the revival's father or pacesetter was william branham the sudden appearance of his miraculous healing campaigns in 1946 set off a spiritual explosion in the pentecostal movement which was to move to main street usa by the 1950s and give birth to the broader charismatic movement in the 1960s which currently affects almost every denomination in the country end quote after the angel of the lord met brother branham in may of 1946 healings multiplied through his state then the nation and then the world observed brother branham's ministry began first well before other evangelists because god ordained it oral roberts began his own healing campaigns in 1947 and billy graham rose to national acclaim in 1949 after only four years of supernatural ministry over one thousand ministers gathered at a voice of healing convention in 1950 to recognize branham's influence on the healing revival they praised god and paid tribute to brother branham for inspiring them to start praying for the sick as moses was given two signs to prove he was god's deliverer god commissioned brother branham with two signs as well a sign in his hand to identify sicknesses and discernment to know the secrets of hearts quote the power of a branham service remains a legend unparalleled in the history of the charismatic movement end quote the largest stadiums and auditoriums in the world were filled with worshipers and jesus christ mightily healed and saved his people the supernatural holy ghost anointing on brother branham moved him to speak with thus saith the lord over 30 times regarding doctrine and prophecy and this anointing turned our hearts back to the apostolic fathers of the faith according to malachi chapter 4 verses 5 and 6 and this is because brother branham had the spirit of elijah anointing him to fulfill the scriptures this spirit of elijah had at least five characteristics brother branham acted and spoke with thus saith the lord second he condemned religious man-made organizations third he condemned immorality in women and of course also men fourth he was a man of the wilderness and fifth he was human he was fearful and doubted when the anointing left his human spirit just like elijah and john the baptist regarding the sixth proof brother branham foretold the future in the name of the lord a requirement from deuteronomy 18 verse 22 and james 5 verse 10. as mentioned earlier brother branham foretold healings in the name of the lord jesus and they came to pass he also foretold three prophecies that are in the process of coming to pass which are the immoral condition of the united states churches second no greater ministry would rise to the gentiles other than his and third denominations would never return to apostolic doctrine and they will also take the mark of the beast brother branham also shared his vision of the seven major visions from 1933 three of which i believe are fulfilled and of course i could be wrong on that but i'm certainly open to correction first he foretold mussolini's invasion and death second he foretold hitler's rise in death and also the siegfried line and third he foretold fascism nazism being swallowed up into communism i personally still believe we're waiting for the fourth fifth sixth and seventh visions to come to pass and want to share this quote regarding the sixth vision which many people believe have come to pass but i personally don't believe that in once more lord on november 17th 1963 brother branham talked about the sixth vision and he said it would be a woman that would stand up and would govern the united states and he said not actually a woman but a church so again this proves you have quotes from brother branham on both sides of the issue in some places he makes it sound like it's going to be a literal woman who will be president or vice president but here in this quote he said not actually a woman but a church let's listen to the quote and how that did permit women to vote and in doing so that would let the wrong president and in this would be a woman stand up that would govern in the united states not actually a woman but a church then i've seen her with nothing but ashes it's going to happen there are also numerous future prophecies from brother branham that we are waiting to come to pass relating to the mark of the beast rome the vatican the united states and believers if you'd like to watch a video i made about it it's my 14th video it's called thus saith the lord future prophecies of william branham refuting the brown bear accusations friends i preach this brown bear subject to my home church in 2013 and again in 2020 and i made a document about it in 2013 which i share with other brothers who had asked me questions about the brown bear vision now back in 2012 when the accusers of brother branham went public i wasn't comfortable addressing all the questions because i hadn't studied out these questions my focus at that time was on doctrine which i'm thankful the lord led me to that area because accusers of brother branham normally fail bitterly in sound biblical doctrine for example some of them allow women preachers they believe in women angels they believe there's no modesty standard they reject a life of holiness they enjoy viewing sinful movies they believe in only one work of grace and they believe god is three persons without any scripture saying that i want to show six observations about the brown bear vision observation 1 a vision is simply a word from the lord and every word of god is thus saith the lord to understand the brown bear vision we have to understand the bible's teaching on visions the bible teaches visions are words from the lord genesis 15 1 says the word of the lord came unto abram in a vision first samuel 13 1 says the word of the lord was precious in those days there was no open vision in acts 26 19 saint paul clearly showed that people can either be disobedient or obedient to a heavenly vision he said he was not disobedient to the heavenly vision but both the saved and lost can obey and disobey visions from god the simple truth is a vision is another form of the word of god and there are consequences or rewards to disobeying or obeying the vision or word of god every word of god is thus saith the lord every word of god cannot fail but some of god's words are promises with conditions and others are without conditions as we'll soon see such as in the life of king saul joshua's generation i believe the brown bear vision was based upon conditions brother branham did not meet the conditions so not all of the vision came to pass but lots of it did observation 2 brother branham never said the exact phrase thus saith the lord i will shoot the bear there are only two quotes about the brown bear and brother branham never said the exact phrase of thus saith the lord i'm going to shoot it and hang it on my wall in the first quote brother branham only said thus saith the lord it will be let's listen to the quote many of you remember the vision that i had where i had shot the grizzly bear nine foot grizzly bear and the church remembers me telling it here and a caribou i had another member it's on tape here i've seen a great huge brown there yeah that might be a kodiak and it wouldn't work in canada because they're not there and see but wherever it will be it'll be it will be that's thus saith the lord the truth is the great huge brown bear was part of the vision came to pass god did his part of the vision as brother branham said later the group of brothers saw the brown bear that god had manifested this means brother branham's accusers are making the shooting of the brown bear an unconditional prophecy when in fact it never was because the shooting wasn't directly spoken with thus saith the lord so again brother rahm's accusers are misinterpreting his quotes as usual in brother branham's second quote about the brown bear he did presume he would shoot the bear but he never said thus saith the lord so we cannot make brother branham's statement an unconditional prophecy william branham's thoughts were not all thus saith the lord so we cannot make the second quote of prophecy because there was no thus saith the lord spoken by brother branham brother branham simply believed he was going to shoot the brown bear but shooting it was not thus saith the lord let's listen to the quote that's right this is very important presuming the future or making a human prediction that is wrong does not disqualify one from being a true prophet which is proven by the bible because in john chapter 21 verses 22 and 23 there went a saying abroad among the brethren that john should not die until jesus return so jesus's own disciples were making predictions about the future that john wouldn't die before jesus returned and of course those were just human predictions so we can't say jesus disciples were false disciples because they had human predictions that were eventually wrong all of us have human predictions that don't come to pass so we cannot condemn brother branham for having this human prediction brother branham's accusers condemn him because his vision was so detailed with his hands on the hips and so forth and the fact it did not fully come to pass but they fail to recognize bible examples of believers failing detailed promises of god given to them by vision or the written word or the spoken word as you'll soon see such as in the case of joshua's generation failing to drive out all the canaanites and possess the full borders of the promised land which were extremely detailed prophecies and yet the believers fail part of those prophecies observation 3 condemning brother branham for failing a vision means you must condemn yourself for your own failures of disobedience if you condemn brother branham as a false prophet for disobeying a vision you had better condemn yourself as a false believer if you've ever disobeyed god's word lied stolen lusted failed to witness to someone the lord placed on your heart failed to give to the poor and needy when prompted by the holy ghost because all your actions have consequences on the future and you missed out on future rewards now friends i know that i fall into that category and so do you as well we've all failed leadings of the holy spirit that if we had obeyed we would have gained the rewards for so please don't condemn yourself i'm not going to condemn myself i'm going to simply follow the bible commands of repenting and then moving forward with christ jesus our lord just as brother branham did observation 4 god forgave brother branham of disobeying the brown bear vision and stayed with his ministry guiding him into all truth such as the seven seals marriage and divorce anointed ones at the end times and many more brother branham repented of disobeying the brown bear vision so god forgave him according to his divine promise in 1st john 1 verse 9 which says if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us of our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness we should rejoice when god forgives others for we want to be forgiven too we rejoice god forgave abraham and isaac for their lies he forgave david of his murder and adultery he forgave moses of his murder and prideful exaltation of himself and all the other forgiveness examples brother brahms accusers have misapplied deuteronomy 18 verses 21-22 saying not to hear brother branham because he failed the brown bear vision but they're wrong for the following reasons first god stayed with brother branham giving him numerous thus saith the lord's statements after the brown bear vision honoring his prayers for the sick as well second brother branham's vision was conditional not unconditional just like isaiah's thus saith the lord that hezekiah would die yet another thus saith the lord came and said he'd be healed notice isaiah's first thus saith the lord did not come to pass also jonah's pronounced judgment upon nineveh did not come to pass due to their repentance regarding hezekiah's healing notice it was thus saith the lord you shall die but thus saith the lord was changed because of the permissive will of god like with balaam we know god does not change his mind but he does allow mankind to receive his permissive will based upon their own freemore agency and notice that thus saith the lord you shall die was not given to a nation as brother rams accusers like to point out it was given to an individual so that means thus saith the lord prophecies can be given to individuals and also be conditional brother branham's accusers seem to say only prophecies given to nations can be conditional which is wrong notice about jonah's warning against nineveh he never said it was conditional but the people of nineveh understood it was conditional so we have to apply that same principle to brother brahms ministry some of the prophecies brother branham made whether by vision or thus saith the lord could have been conditional even if they didn't sound like it or even if brother adam didn't say they were conditional so we have to treat all prophets the same they all have to be tested by the word of the lord as the bible says prove all things try every spirit observation five brother branham failed one vision the brown bear vision but obeyed many visions for the glory of god consider the many visions that brother branham obeyed and that came to pass such as the commission of the angel and his two signs like moses also the vision of georgie carter's healing from tuberculosis brother brown's vision of the miraculous healing of congressman upshaw came to pass brother branham's vision of florence humes healing from tuberculosis came to pass where he saw her weighing herself two mondays in a row brother graham's vision of florence chicarian's death came to pass despite numerous preachers prophesying of her healing and also the visions that the denominations would never break up and come back to the apostolic truth and the vision that no gift would ever rise to the gentiles greater than his and the vision of the immoral condition of the united states church all these visions have come to pass or are in the process of coming to pass observation 6 god can interpret his word any way he wants an important example is elijah being told by god to anoint three people but he only anointed one does this mean even god's own prophecies can fail of course not but brother branham's accusers would like you to ignore the scripture first kings 19 15-17 because it shows the truth that god can interpret the visions he gave to brother branham in any way he wants god gave elijah this command in first kings 19 verses 15 through 17. first the lord said elijah would anoint elisha and then he said anoint hazel to be king over syria in verse 15. and then in verse 16 he said anoint jehu to be king over israel if you read the bible the only one elijah did anoint was elisha according to second kings 2 9-15 when the double portion fell on elisha it seems elisha anointed haziel king over syria in second kings 8 verses 13-15 and it seems a son of a prophet anointed jehu king over israel in second kings 9 1-13 elijah only anointed elisha the other two things he did not physically fulfill that's because elijah left the scene because we know god's word can't fail this proves god can interpret his word any way he wants now this relates to the brown bear vision because god's vision given to brother branham of the brown bear could be interpreted as conditional again this would be an example like isaiah's conditional thus saith the lord to hezekiah who was an individual and not a nation and also jonas thus saith the lord warning of destruction to nineveh which turned out to be conditional ten bible truths about visions and conditional promises example one abraham his life shows a prophet can disobey a prophetic vision but still be a prophet and this closely relates to brother branham because brother brahm disobeyed a vision as well just as abraham did abraham was called a prophet in genesis 20 verse 7 but he disobeyed two aspects of his heavenly vision about dwelling in canaan in genesis 12 verses 1 through 4. first abraham allowed lot to go with him out of shinar after being told specifically to separate from his kindred and god did not visit abraham until after he obeyed and separated from lot as genesis chapters 13 and on prove god was patient until abraham fully obeyed the original vision or word from the lord second abraham left canaan during the famine according to genesis 12 verses 10 through 20. this disobedience led to abraham's first lie that sarah wasn't his wife and also the plaguing of pharaoh's house so we learn from abraham's example that genuine prophets who are saved and go to heaven can disobey heavenly visions and they will suffer the consequences but they will remain god's prophet balaam is a simple example of how a genuine prophet but of course we call him a false prophet because of his false teachings and the fact he went to hell in second peter 2 verses 15-17 can disobey a heavenly vision as balaam refused god's first word of the lord or first heavenly vision about not going with balak but then god allowed him to go this is recorded numbers 22 verses 12 through 21. back to abraham god still blessed abraham later in his life despite his disobedience to the two details of his vision of living in canaan away from his kindred because abraham was a prophet god bless brother branham despite his disobedience to the brown bear vision as he told in september 1962 because god still revealed the seven seals to him marriage and divorce and numerous other subjects to brother branham and also healed his wife's tumor by the spoken word in late 1963 and also healed him of a stomach issue in late 1965. if disobeying a prophetic vision disqualifies brother brennam then you have to disqualify abraham for twice disobeying his vision from the lord in genesis chapter 12. example two the believers in joshua's generation this example shows regular believers can disobey two prophetic visions yet still be saved and forgiven hence the description of israel served the lord all the days of joshua from joshua 24 31 this vision shows brother random can be forgiven of failing conditional promises moses and joshua were given prophecies from god that israel could drive out all the inhabitants numbers 33 verses 51-53 and possessed the entire promised land including the coasts one of which included the river euphrates according to joshua 1 verses 1-9 but because some tribes disobeyed the voice of god some nations were not driven out of the land read the entire chapter of judges too and not all the borders were possessed this does not mean joshua and moses were false prophets it means the people did not fully obey the visions and words from the lord joshua 24 31 proves that although the tribes did not drive out all the inhabitants they were still saved because it makes it seem joshua's generation was faithful saying and israel served the lord all the days of joshua and all the days of the elders that overlived joshua and which had known all the works of the lord that he had done for israel note also that joshua fulfilled his part but other tribes failed thus saith the lord vision of taking all the borders joshua 1 verse 4 showed the potential borders if israel obeyed this was a conditional promise given to joshua by vision or god speaking to joshua according to joshua 1 verse 1. these borders were not fulfilled until david's time in second samuel 3 verse 8 nearly 400 years later schofield's bible says 398 years joshua filled all god's will and land for he and his house according to joshua 11 verse 23 but numerous tribes did not obey all the vision such as ephraim not driving out the canaanites in joshua 16 verse 10 manasseh not driving out the canaanites in joshua 17 verses 12 through 13. the benjamites did not drive out the jebusites according to judges 2 verses 21 through 26 and zebulun asher and naphtali and dan did not drive out the canaanites in judges 2 verses 21 through 36. friends notice the men of ephraim dan asher etc could have all said we have thus saith the lord from visions from god given both to moses and joshua that we can possess all the borders of our land and we can drive out all the inhabitants they could have said we're going to drive them out according to the visions that were thus saith the lord part of those statements would have been true but it was based upon the condition of obedience as it turned out those tribes would have failed portions of the visions god gave to moses and joshua but that did not mean they were lost they simply failed the vision of the lord and would need to repent that's exactly what brother branham did when he repented of failing the brown bear vision here's the quote and i find out if god has spoken anything then we must go with that word in order to make it be fulfilled we've seen that as i told you last night i have a vision just recently that if i had to be there in the morning to be there and telling me six months before to be on that spot and stand there and say go down there three times with them and i just walked on the other man and the vision passed right through exactly god's part i was there standing so we want to remember you've got to stand on the word stay right with the word where the word leads you go right with the word and you'll bring out all right i'm sure my hands lord's up what will i do now father i've got many things that i do wrong i've just confessed my sin this morning before the church as i confessed to you on top of the mountain the other morning when it was blowing and snowing and up there on top of the mountain i cried out and asked you to forgive me for my stupidity and how i dreaded to come before my brethren who some of them regard me as your prophet servant and lord how i hated to come to for them and tell them of a stupid act that i would do a thing like that but god is good for my soul that i confess my sins and not hide them so to be honest with you and right before the people i have confessed it lord i'm wrong i'm all together wrong i pray forgiveness example three king saul his life shows a minor prophet can disobey written prophetic promises and miss out on future rewards yet still be saved saul's example most closely relates to brother branham regarding missing out on the blessing of shooting the brown bear it seems saul was a minor prophet according to first samuel 10 verses 11 and 12. but saul disobeyed the written prophecy of deuteronomy 17 verses 14 through 20 which said israel's king would prolong his kingdom for he and his children the prophet samuel interpreted this prophecy in first samuel 13 verse 13 after saul disobeyed the lord and was rejected from being king saying and samuel said to saul thou has done foolishly thou has not kept the commandment of the lord thy god which he commanded thee for now would the lord have established thy kingdom upon israel forever this verse proves king saul lost the reward of the kingdom forever if he would have obeyed so he missed out on the blessing of the vision because of his disobedience brother rana missed out on the blessings of his prophetic vision because of his disobedience but again god never left brother branham and he remained a genuine prophet of god this principle is also true in the new testament as first corinthians 13 verses 14 and 15 prove as they say some rewards can be lost due to disobedience now i believe this is speaking of the foolish virgin but it says if any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon he shall receive a reward if any man's work should be burned he shall suffer loss but he himself shall be saved yet so as by fire and of course we know saul was saved because the prophet samuel was called up and told him that saul would be with samuel the next day after his death and of course samuel was in abraham's bosom where the saved went because there was a great chasm between the saved and the lost in the heart of the earth example 4 prophets can doubt visions and disobey visions this helps us understand how brother branham did not think some visions were fulfilled the experiences of john the baptist and peter both who were prophets prove prophets can doubt visions and disobey visions and yet still be genuine prophets john the baptist saw the spirit of god descend and remain on jesus in a vision according to john 1 verses 32 through 36 but later in prison doubted his vision according to matthew 11 verses 2 and 3. this will help us later to see how brother branham could doubt if his visions were fulfilled like the tent vision and the vision of the three hundred thousand in a foreign meeting which i believe were both fulfilled more on that later moving on to peter in acts chapter 10 verses 9 through 17 peter didn't understand his vision even doubting it like john the baptist and peter even denied the voice it seems peter for a short time was disobedient to the heavenly vision which said rise kill and eat acts 10 17 says while peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean now of course god later interpreted this vision for him by taking him to the gentile house of cornelius and god was proving he had now accepted the gentiles and god also helped him understand this vision in galatians 2 where peter had separated himself from eating with the gentiles and paul corrected peter because of his segregation from gentile believers because paul told us the food of god and the creatures of god were made to be received with thanksgiving example five david as a minor prophet david suffered because he disobeyed prophetic written promises so this proves prophets can disobey thus saith the lord the word of god yet still be prophets king david was a minor prophet according to acts 2 verses 29-30 because nathan was the major prophet of his day but david was disobedient to the command about kings not marrying many wives and suffered because of it david's sin with bathsheba also had many evil consequences deuteronomy 17 verse 17 said neither shall he multiply wise to himself that his heart not turn away neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold again david being a minor prophet he even numbered the people disobeying scripture regarding that first god never told david to number the people and second david seemed to have a selfish motive in numbering the people for prideful reasons second samuel 24 verse 10 says david's heart smote him after he had numbered the people and david said unto the lord i have sinned greatly and that i have done and now i beseech the o lord take away the iniquity of thy servant for i have done very foolishly both major and minor prophets can disobey visions or words of the lord they can do foolishly but god is faithful and just and merciful to forgive all their trespasses example 6 solomon solomon suffered because he disobeyed the vision of the lord this closely relates to brother branham because both men saw visions and purposely disobeyed them solomon was purposely disobedient to the command about kings not marrying many wives and suffered because of it just like david was disobedient to that written command but also solomon purposely disobeyed a vision of the lord that he had in 1st kings 9 verses 1 through 9 when the lord appeared to solomon the second time and warned him if he should turn from following god him or his children and would not keep god's commandments and his statutes and go and serve other gods and worship them god would cut off israel out of the land solomon was purposely disobedient to a thus saith the lord vision of god because of his disobedience god stirred up two adversaries against solomon at the end of his life according to first kings 11 14 and verse 23. example seven as previously mentioned isaiah's prophecy of hezekiah's death shows how thus saith the lord's statements can be conditional to individuals this is very important because brother man's accusers say conditional promises are for nations only but again we see that the scripture and god's prophets are correct example eight shows the prophetic promise of salvation is conditional friends three verses proclaim the future promise of salvation to all or whosoever calls upon the lord but it is conditional joel 2 32 says whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord shall be delivered acts 2 21 repeats this saying whosoever shall call upon the name of lord shall be saved romans 10 13 says for whosoever shall call upon the name of the lord shall be saved friends these are true promises but they're conditional and they must be balanced millions if not billions of church goers have and are confessing that they shall be saved they are essentially saying it's thus saith the lord i'm going to be saved because i've called but this promise is conditional as matthew 7 verse 21 through 24 says and exodus 32 verse 33 and revelation 3 verse 5 say because these verses prove only those who call upon the name of the lord and do the will of god are saved matthew 7 21 says not everyone that saith unto me lord lord shall enter in the kingdom of god but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven exodus 32 33 says the lord said unto moses whosoever has sinned against me him will i blot out out of my book revelation 3 verse 5 jesus said he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white raiment and i will not blot out his name out of the book of life any honest person who reads the scripture will realize the promise of salvation is conditional and those who disobey the conditions of this promise will miss out on the future blessing of eternal life example 9 the prophetic promise of being filled with the baptism of the holy ghost is conditional and those who disobey this prophecy will miss out on the future blessing of being clothed or endued with power from on high and also miss out on ruling and reigning with christ during the millennium acts 2 38 seems to say all those who are baptized in the name of jesus christ shall be filled with the holy ghost but of course this promise is conditional peter said repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost anyone who's been around the lord jesus christ baptism has seen many people be baptized but then fall away into sinful disobedience never manifesting the baptism of the holy ghost in their daily lives yet the baptized one could honestly and truly say it's thus saith the lord from the word of god acts 2 38 that i'll receive the baptism of the holy ghost i shall it will be but again the reception of this promise is conditional based upon genuine repentance acts 8 shows the reality of this using the example of simon the sorcerer he was baptized believing in the lord jesus in acts 8 verse 13 but later he tries to buy the gift to pray for others to receive the holy ghost and peter says in verses 20 through 23 his money would perish with him his heart was not right in the sight of god he needed to repent of this his wickedness and pray to god if perhaps the thought of his heart would be forgiven him peter perceived he was in the gall of bitterness in the bond of iniquity now this scripture disproves brother branham's accusers who believe in one work of grace they believe a person is filled with the holy ghost as soon as they repent and say the sinner's prayer which is a false teaching simon the sorcerer had repented and been baptized but look at the condition of his heart his heart is still in wickedness it's in bitterness it's still in iniquity he was still going to perish yet he was already baptized in water yet his heart was not right in the sight of god yet simon the sorcerer could have said according to the thus saith the lord future promise of acts 2 38 and my obedience to it it's thus saith lord i'm going to receive the baptism of the holy ghost so it's clear to any honest christian that the promise of receiving the third work of grace the baptism of the holy ghost is a conditional promise acts 5 32 said god gives the holy ghost to them that obey him obviously simon the sorcerer had not obeyed god enough to receive the baptism of the holy ghost example 10 the prophetic promise of divine healing is conditional and those who disobey miss out on the future blessings of health and healing psalm 103 verse 2 and isaiah 53 verse 4 seem to say god heals all diseases as also proven by matthew 8 16 which says jesus healed all manner of sickness and all manner of disease jesus disciples were given all power to heal all diseases as well according to matthew 10 verse 1 so a sick person could potentially say it's thus saith the lord according to the vision or word of god that god will heal all my diseases but we learn from scripture that god's divine promise of divine healing can be missed due to disobedience because the bible said jesus could not do many mighty miracles because of people's unbelief or disobedience so we learn divine healing is based upon faith and obedience and the conditions must be met according to matthew 13 verses 57 and 58 matthew 17 verses 19 through 21 mark 6 verses 5 and 6 and luke 4 verses 18 and 19. at other times friends god does not heal us to keep us humble as in paul's case in second corinthians 12 7 as paul was even given a buffeting messenger from satan and then there's other times god might not heal us to take us home to heaven there are many many more examples of conditional bible promises such as james 1 verses 5 and 6 regarding the promise for abundant wisdom if a person asks without wavering that's a conditional promise also isaiah 26 verse 3 promises a peaceful mind if a person keeps their mind on god but again that's a conditional promise brief responses to other accusations lord willing i may make individual videos about the following accusations but i'd like to give a few short words here about them because this will help preachers or people who contact me with questions right now the vision of three hundred thousand in a meeting it's my humble opinion that brother branham seemed to misunderstand the vision thinking it was unfulfilled up until the time he died but i believe it's most likely the vision was fulfilled in his 1954 trip to bombay india in which he was told by the mayor of bombay that nearly 500 000 attend the meetings let's listen to the quote [Applause] is [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] this number of half a million could have been exaggerated and so it seems the 500 000 meeting could have been the 300 000 meeting remember it's possible for a prophet to doubt whether his vision or prophecy had come to pass as the example with john the baptist showed and also peter's doubt about his sheep vision in acts chapter 10 verse 17. it's clear brother branham wasn't sure where the meeting would be he said in india or somewhere east of africa somewhere where indians are at somewhere in that eastern country let's listen to the quote market in your bibles that you hear of this that i was in india or somewhere east of africa tanzania somewhere where indians are at somewhere in that eastern country which i believe will be india itself or there will be 300 000 people either they will be attending the meeting or if they'll be the archbishop told me that brother bam that that's 300 000 conversions another thing to keep in mind is that someone else could have fulfilled brother brandon's vision of the 300 000 in one meeting this is scriptural because god gave elijah instructions to anoint three people but he only anointed one of them and other people fulfilled the rest of the vision this is also seen in revelation 10 verse 11 because john is told to prophesy again of the open book to every people nation tongue and tribe but he did not fulfill that command it's the gentile church who fulfills that command which is the fulfillment of the great commission second the tent vision brother ram never thought this vision was fulfilled but we can't forget the interpretation of the angel who was always scriptural and said god would meet brother branham in the prayer closet so i believe this vision was fulfilled during the week brother branham preached the revelation of the seven seals because brother ram shut himself in for prayer and study and god surely met him let's listen to the quote where brother branham said the angel the lord interpreted the tent vision for him me the same voice the angel's voice he said i'll meet you in there and this is the third pull but nobody will know nothing about it and i said well i don't understand why i end there why that he said it will not be a public show this time and i said i don't understand going into that closet like that and he said is not it written by our lord when thou prayers do not like the hypocrites who like to be heard before man but enter into the secret closet and pray to the father who seeth in secret and he who sees in secret shall reward thee openly it's perfectly to the scripture every time it is and i said i understand here's the quote where brother branham said it was a tremendous week for him preaching the seven seals because he would be in the room constantly studying and praying this has been a tremendous week for me i'm tired my mind is tired because i i was the best that i could do and something strange going on every day i would be amazed to walk in the room and be there for a few minutes and see something is turning completely around and here i go in there i pick up the notes i pick up books of dr smith you're a smith and all the writers and read and read down in their books i said now here's the sixth seal here's the fourth seal now what does this man say he'd say what was this there that i look over here and get another man he said it was such and such and it looked like it just it just didn't work right and i thought well what is it lord i walk up down the floor along i kneel down pray go back pick up the bible sit down read walk back and forth then all of a sudden when i got quiet you're just unfolding like that then i grab a pen right quick go right down then i'd take the rest of the day go down and chase this out and see if it tied all the way down through the scriptures then it proved all things right i got this shirt i think now there's many people had visions there's many been revelations if it's contrary to the word leave it alone that's right leave it alone and remember friends it's biblical that prophets do not always understand their visions like john the baptist doubted his vision of jesus while he was in prison notice also the angel said the third poll wouldn't be a public show like the first two meaning his plans to re attend and hold meetings were likely a misinterpretation from the start because public services were used to show his first two polls the gift in his hand and also second the discernment of spirit another powerful point is that the tent vision showed an altar call and hundreds of people weeping sitting by the altar receiving the lord jesus let's listen to the quote keep your line straight and these kind of times i said yes so i got the line ready to throw again and just as it did at that time he taken me away again and he stood me up in the air over a great auditorium or a big tent oh i've never seen such a tent spread way out and in that there was a look like admittedly calling hundreds of people real soft and sweet they were weeping standing with the altar receiving the lord jesus and i said that looks better now what's amazing is that the week that brother adam preached the revelation of the seven seals he said there was over a hundred baptisms so it seems the tent vision prophecy of hundreds being saved was fulfilled during the week of the seven seals let's listen to the quote from the seventh seal and now i was asking billy he was so long about coming and getting me he said there had been a another group baptized which runs over a hundred this week of uh people being baptized in the name of our lord jesus christ amen so we are are thankful and god bless you the seven major visions here's a few points about the seven major visions it's my opinion brother branham said different things about these prophecies because he was trying his best to remember all the details of the 1933 prophecy he was not altering the prophecies but recalling them in my opinion it seems the church age book version of the seven major visions is the most accurate recalling since brother branham worked with levail to put into print what brother branham agreed was the closest statements to the thus saith the lord visions as possible remember brother branham was not a scholar he did not have time to sit around and memorize things like people do today he was constantly on sick calls prayer lines etc this may explain why brother branham said different things about the seven prophecies which shows he was just trying to remember all the details third brother brahm lived in the vision dimension he had lots of visions which means a lot of mental strain he said i live a big part of my life in another dimension and this is a life that brother rams accusers don't know about because they don't have visions constantly like brother branham had so they don't seem to have compassion and consideration upon brother branham and also regarding the seven major visions we have to be very careful what we make thus saith the lord because not every word surrounding the actual words of thus saith the lord was in fact inspired from god what i mean by that is words a few sentences before or few paragraphs before or a few sentences after or a few paragraphs after none of us including brother rams accusers know the exact prophecies brother branham made in 1933 because they were not recorded on tape after the fact brother branham tried to write them down and remember them so we give brother brahm the benefit of the doubt as he was trying to remember the seven prophecies to the best of his recollection the ohio river municipal bridge vision this prophecy is ultimately brother branham's word versus his accuser's word brother m's accusers cannot fully prove with absolute certainty that 16 men never died because they were not there every day during every moment of the construction they seem to make their micro fish research and absolute but that doesn't mean it is now also i cannot prove sixteen men died but i'm taking brother branham's word because of his bible-based teaching and the vindications he was a genuine prophet of god brother brahms accusers failed to recognize they cannot prove by egyptian historical records that moses led two million israelis out of egypt there's no historical record of that in egypt so should we refuse the bible records of moses and the exodus no we cannot exalt human research and historical records to infallibility like brother ann's accusers are doing with the research they've done at jeffersonville libraries and other government agencies you also have to take into account that john or jack vissing gave a testimony about the ohio municipal bridge and you can watch that on youtube as well where his family members remember men dying during the construction of the ohio municipal bridge so again ultimately it's brother branham's word against the accuser's word and i'm going to stand with god's prophet brother branham the february 28 1963 arizona cloud again this case is ultimately brother brahms word against brother rams accusers words brother rams accusers cannot fully prove with absolute certainty that the cloud was formed by a rocket they try to make their data and paperwork an absolute but that doesn't mean it is also i cannot prove that the cloud was formed by seven angels i'm taking brother braham's word because of his bible-based teaching because of the cloud prophecy from sirs is this the end time december 30th 1962 bill rashtran's evidence that the arizona cloud was formed by supernatural means and not human means and the supernatural revelation and vindication that god gave to brother branham regarding the seven seals sermons but there's a brother in the message named bill rostrom and you can watch his videos proving that the cloud could not have been formed by a thor rocket i've listened to the entire messages which was over six hours and all the scientific facts are proven and show that the shape of the cloud where it was located the time it appeared the density of the material required to make it all point to the fact that this was not a man-made cloud it was not made by a thor rocket it was a supernatural cloud another point is that brother branham never said thus saith the lord i was under the cloud when the photo was taken so we cannot jump to a conclusion and make every word of brother branham thus saith the lord some people attack brother branham because they say he wasn't there under the cloud when the photo was taken but to me that doesn't matter because brother graham never said thus say the lord i was under the cloud when the photo was taken a very important point is that the vision of the cloud and its fulfillment was in the name of the lord it was prophesied on december 30th 1962 and january 14th 1963. here's the first quote saying it's in the name of the lord let's listen to the my quote is god let us turn on the light i'm standing in an awful place if you but knew it remember i tell you in the name of the lord i've told you the in the next quote from january 14th brother braham said a vision sent him here of course that was the vision of the pyramid and constellation of seven angels let's listen to the i'm quote in phoenix tonight in the name of the lord i would will not try to explain what's happened many of people take the tapes be sure to get that one what time is it sir just before i left home a vision sent me here i don't know why i don't i'm not a tape salesman and i don't uh uh stress those things we get them and we gotta take a business around the world way into the jungles and everywhere they have a little something you put in the ears they got and can tape it into the tape and stand there and translate that right into the language and it goes around the world and um but the one that i had that uh what time is it served or is this the time sir i was saturday night three weeks ago at the church after all my life of seeing visions i never had anything like this before in my life i don't know what it is i'm just here but he sent me here i don't know what it means i'm just i'm just here and here on march 24 1963 brother branham said the vision was fulfilled with thus saith the lord let's listen to the quote now the vision plus the word plus the history plus the church ages and all blend together so i could truly say that to the best of my understanding and according to the word of god and the vision and the revelation the interpretation thereof is thus saith the lord another point i want to make is that brother branham could have been under the cloud on february 28th by translation just like philip god could have transported his physical body there for a moment and then brought him back or he could have been transported there by vision like ezekiel in ezekiel 8 verse 15 ezekiel was taken to jerusalem in the visions of god while sitting in his house in chaldea which was probably over a hundred miles away ezekiel's vision was not a translation like philip because ezekiel's body stayed in chaudia phillips body was literally translated to another area according to acts 8 verses 39 and 40. and of course i've been mocked and made fun of because of these two possibilities that i believe in but at the same time they are biblical possibilities an important point is that brother brahm did not say the word cloud before the event but he did call this cloud a snow white pyramid so brother rams accusers failed to recognize this saying there's no prophecy about it but there is he just didn't say the word cloud he said snow white pyramid let's listen to the quotes i could see those angels those shaped back wings traveling faster than sound could travel they come from eternity in a split like a twinkling of an eye not enough to bachelor i just twinkle they were there i didn't have time to count i didn't have time or they just looked mighty ones great powerful angels snow white wings setting heads and they were and what it did i was caught up into this pyramid of constellation and i thought now this is it i was numbed all over questions brother rams accusers cannot or will not answer correctly or honestly in the spirit of meekness friends i encourage you to ask brother branham's accusers if they ever reach out to you for any comments or questions to at some point ask them these humble simple bible questions which they will either ignore answer dishonestly or answer incorrectly the first question is about the trinity ask which bible verse calls jesus a second person or the holy spirit a third person with those exact words the honest and correct answer is none which means the trinity dogma is a man-made creed added by men god did not call to write or interpret his holy word as a follow-up question you could ask if the bible doesn't say those words then why are you adding to the bible which carries severe repercussions and you could also ask and why does your trinitarian creed contradict the giants of the faith who wrote the bible a related question would also be why do you exalt the trinitarian giants of the last 500 years like luther wesley and others above the giants who wrote the bible this question will show brother branham's accusers will not honestly answer questions about the unbiblical trinity dogma so in this case brother brahms accusers are adding to the word of god which carries severe repercussions a second question would be which scripture in the new testament or old testament shows god asking a godly woman to cut her hair the honest and correct answer would be none because god never did ask a godly woman to cut her hair a related question to ask would be if god didn't ask a godly woman to cut her hair why do you allow your wives and daughters to cut and trim their hair in this case brother m's accusers would be taken away from the bible because first corinthians 11 verses 1 through 16 clearly prove women were never to cut their hair and men were supposed to cut their hair short and remember paul said we would all be judged by his gospel according to romans 2 verse 16. a third question would be which verse in the old testament or new testament shows god allowing a man or woman to paint their faces the honest and correct answer would be none but it's likely brother brahms accusers won't answer this honestly because if they were honest they would recognize the four verses that condemn makeup wearing which are jeremiah 4 verse 30 ezekiel 23 verse 40 second kings 9 30 and proverbs 6 verses 16-17 yet some of brother branham's accusers allow their wives and daughters to wear makeup and yet there's no biblical support for that so again in this case they're taking away from the word of god they're ignoring or explaining away those four verses that condemn wearing makeup a fourth question would be which bible verse allows cross-dressing an honest and correct answer would be none because we know god condemned it in deuteronomy 22 verse 5 and there's no new testament scripture that tells us this abomination is undone or god no longer thinks cross-dressing is an abomination anymore you can also tell brother ram's accusers according to american history a woman wearing women's pants from the women's section of the department store is still cross-dressing because they're simply wearing pants and if they doubt that they need to read the book called women and pants by cynthia gregg and catherine smith from 2003 i have this book and it fully explains the uproar that happened in america when women started wearing pants and again brother brahms accusers are taken away from the scripture a fifth question would be why do you deny the three works of grace which allows new converts to be deceived when you tell them they are already born again by the baptism of the holy ghost when the new testament is clear that the holy ghost baptism comes sometime after a person initially believes an honest and correct answer would be that they're denying the second and third work of grace which essentially produces many false conversions you would point them to acts 19 verses 1 through 6 ephesians 1 13 along with four new testament bible examples of believers who were saved but not yet born again which are mary peter cornelius and the ephesians in acts chapter 19. you can see all this on my video called you can be saved but not born again by the holy ghost baptism in your soul it's video number 101 and again brother brahms accusers are taking away from the scripture by teaching there's only one work of grace a sixth question would be why don't you read brother jesse's two books that prove biblical modesty guidelines and the new testament mysteries that god had brother branham fulfill since you love research so much and since brother jesse offered them for free to some of your leaders on his 2020 debate an honest and correct answer would be that they don't want to research the other side of the debate because perhaps they're afraid of the truth as it seems they're only doing selective research and only researching to prove their own narratives as a i guess preacher recently told me the fact they will not research the other side proves they are not objective and they only want to push their own narrative their own false conclusion and of course i'm giving this offer to anyone who wants to read my books i'll mail them to them for free this is the sad truth about brother ramsey's accusers they fail to research the other side when i visited many of their sites listened to almost all their podcasts and youtube videos i'm not afraid of the truth as message believers we're not afraid of the truth because the truth will set us free and prove brother branham was a genuine prophet of god a seventh question would be when will you repent of falsely claiming brother branham pretended to speak in tongues because brother jesse's video shows your false assumptions the honest and correct answer would be they will repent as soon as they watch my video which shows they misunderstood brother branham brother branham just mixed up two testimonies and brother m's accusers jumped to a false conclusion in order to slander him the video made about that is called william branham did not pretend to speak in tongues defending jesus message and messenger it's video number 84. an eighth question would be when will you repent of teaching there are women angels an honest and correct answer would be they would want to repent as soon as they watch my video about how there are no women angels the video clearly shows zechariah's vision of women with wings represented nations and not women angels because there are not two or three witnesses of women angels in the scriptures but we do have two or three witnesses of women representing nations and the video to reference would be women angels and women preachers it's video number eight so in this case brother brahms accusers are adding to the word of god which carries severe repercussions a ninth and final question would be who fulfilled revelation 10 verse 7 if brother branham did not fulfill it an honest and correct answer would be brother branham did fulfill it the seventh angel cannot be a heavenly angel because angels do not preach mysteries to men and no other prophets declared an angel would finish the mysteries but the true prophets and jesus did foretell the spirit of elijah would finish the mysteries and restore all things according to joel chapter 2 verses 23-26 malachi 4 verses 5 and 6 daniel 12 4 matthew 17 verse 11 and luke 17 30. you can suggest they read my 2021 book called the 12 new testament mysteries revealed and in chapter 13 i give an overview of brother random's ministry and how he was a genuine prophet of god and i showed how six of the twelve of the new testament mysteries were preached by brother branham with thus saith the lord none of the following preachers have done this billy graham oral roberts kenneth copeland john piper john macarthur timothy keller joel osteen td jakes none of them have the only preacher who fulfilled revelation 10 7 was william branham in closing friends i think this video has proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that many bible prophecies visions and written promises are conditional and they can be conditional promises to an individual or a nation william branham was a genuine prophet of god as all the evidence shows and yet the same time he was human and he made mistakes and he disobeyed words from the lord but that's a universal problem that all christians have they love the lord jesus christ some of them are baptized with the holy ghost in their souls and the bible says in first john 3 that the seed of god does not sin but then paul says no good thing dwells in my flesh and paul says i have a war going on in my mind i want to serve the law of god but also have sin battling me in my mind as well the scriptures and history prove brother branham was a genuine prophet and if i can be a help to you especially if you're a pastor or minister with these subjects feel free to reach out to me by email please and lord willing i'll get back to you as soon as i can by the grace of god if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me god bless you and may jesus christ be the desire of your heart
