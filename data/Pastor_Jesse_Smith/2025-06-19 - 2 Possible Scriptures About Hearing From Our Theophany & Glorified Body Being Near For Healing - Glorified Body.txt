TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] You have then been formed into the living image of the living God. You heard from your theophony. If this earthly body be dissolved, we have one waiting. Greetings friends in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ. The purpose of this video is to do a third video on the topic of the theophony body. And we'll look at two possible scriptures that speak of believers either hearing from their theophony or having their glorified body near them. And this is based upon the feedback in the comments. So I want to appreciate everyone who left a comment and all the brotherly kindness and quotes and scriptures that the people shared. So may God bless you richly. If this is the first video you've seen in the series, I encourage you to go back look at part one. We defined the three bodies by the Bible. Your terrestrial body or your physical flesh body. The second body is the celestial body. That's the topic of these videos. The theophony body. It's an angel-like body. And then the glorified body, which is the flesh body swallowed up with eternal life. And the glorified body is the combination of all three bodies. And then we saw the order of the manifestation of believers. We started with Jesus who started out as thought and then went to theophony form the pillar of fire the logos. Then he came to flesh body and then he went to the glorified body and that's the current body the Lord Jesus is in. Believers go from thought to flesh body to be tempted and tested by sin and overcome sin. Then believers go into the theophony after death and then they'll go into a glorified body throughout all eternity. Then in part two, we showed the context for brother Ram's quote from who is this mazdc 1965 when he said, "You heard from your theophony." He was quoting 2 Corinthians 5:1. And I found in this quote that the Bible does not say anything about hearing from our theophony. It doesn't say anything about hearing from heaven, but it speaks of Paul longing for that heavenly body, that eternal body, longing for the theophony. And then we showed how Jesus heard from other people's theophanes. Jesus heard from Moses and Elijah and King Saul heard from the theophony of Samuel. And even as preaching that last night out of 1st Samuel 28, he saw God's ascending up. So it seems King Saul might have seen other theophanes as well, but he talked to only one theophony and that was the prophet Samuel's theophony. Also want to share a few additional points to consider by God's grace. First, the quote about hearing from our theophony is the only quote about this subject. I've never heard brother Random mention that anytime beforehand or after. And brother Ram does not expound on this statement that you've heard from your theophony. He only speaks of 2 Corinthians 5:1. But that verse doesn't talk about hearing from heaven. It talks about longing for heaven. Brother Ram does not preach an entire sermon on hearing from our theophony. And brother Ram does not give thus sayith the Lord that we hear from our theophony body. And remember he cares you care. 1963 brother Ram says you always have to be careful how you're listening. There's a human side to brother Brandham and then there's the divine side which is the prophetic gift that says thus sayith the Lord. So to my humble opinion this statement brother Brandham made about hearing from our theophony is just the human side because I can't find any scripture for it and there's no thus sayith the Lord for it. And that's just my humble opinion by the grace of God. Again, I'm open to correction. I'm just trying to do what brother Ram told us to do. Rightly divide the word of truth. That's what the Bible says. Prove all things. And be careful how I'm listening to the sermons of brother Brandham. And notice in uh John 16:13, Jesus said, "The Holy Ghost will guide us into all truth. Not the theophony body will guide us into all truth." But I understand even in the comments that the theophony has the same nature as the Holy Ghost because the theophony is an eternal body. And there's only one eternal nature that's the Holy Ghost. So I certainly agree that the nature of the theophony is the Holy Ghost. I don't see any scripture that says we hear from our theophony body rather than the Holy Ghost himself or God's spirit himself. And also friends, every other revelation from the Bible that brother Ram preached to us has lots of scripture to support it, such as the water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, the Godhead that God is only one person, the serpent seed, brother Ram's ministry, and the verses that he fulfilled, predestination, and many other Bible revelations. So that's why I think maybe this statement about hearing from our theophony isn't a Bible revelation. it's brother Ram's human side or his own opinion, but I'm open to it being true because I'm a believer in the Lord Jesus Christ and his holy Bible and I believe Brother Ram was a genuine prophet of God which I've preached and believe for over 21 years. Also, I'll share one more thing as I was preaching last night about the theophony. It seems the Old Testament saints who did resurrect in Matthew 27:es 51-53 did have glorified bodies. The scriptures say they came out of the graves. The bodies came out of the graves. So, we know Jesus raised with a glorified body. So, it would seem the Old Testament saints raised with glorified bodies. But again, I could be wrong, but the context seems to point to that because it speaks of bodies coming out of graves. Okay, so let's look at the two possible scriptures. The first possible scripture of someone hearing from their theophony would be John the Revelator in the book of Revelation. I want to thank the brothers for sharing this. Numerous brothers shared this with me. It's from Revelation 4:10 and 11 and Revelation 5:5. Now, without a doubt, John sees his theophony, but it is still questionable whether he heard from his theophony. So, we look at those verses in Revelation 4 10 and 11. The 24 elders fall down and cast their crowns before the lamb, before the Lord Jesus Christ, who's seated on the throne in heaven. Now, those 24 elders have to be 12 sons of Jacob from the 12 tribes of Israel and the 12 apostles of the Lord Jesus. Either Matias took Judas's Scariot's spot or St. Paul took Matias's spot. And then in Revelation 5:5, the Bible says, "One of the elders saith unto me, weep not. Behold, the line of the tribe of Judah, the root of David, hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seven seals thereof." So it's possible that John's theophony spoke to John and it's possible John heard from his theophony but again it just says one of the elders. It doesn't say that John heard from his own theophony. We also want to notice the context here of this verse though the context is after the church ages because of Revelation 4:1 says I will show thee things which must be hereafter. So I believe John was caught up by vision into the third heaven. That's noted in Revelation 9:7. And thus I saw the horses in the vision. So John is given a vision on the aisle of Patmos to go into the third heaven. And he sees things that must happen after the church ages. So from my understanding, the elders falling down, casting the crowns hasn't happened yet, but I could be wrong on that. That's just my humble opinion. So I believe John is seeing a future event because I don't believe we have two active beings at the same time. So consider that it's possible some people believe we have two active beings. We have a body, spirit, soul active on earth and then some people believe we have an active theophony that's worshiping in heaven casting down crowns or something like that. I personally don't believe that as I believe John was seeing a future event that once he got into his theophony he would participate in. But again I could be wrong. This is a deeper subject. So it's interesting to kind of think about these things and compare scripture with scripture. That's what spiritual people do according to the book of first Corinthians. They compare spiritual things with spiritual things. So there's a few reasons I don't think this is John hearing from his own theophony. First, brother Ram said a theophony has no spirit in it. He said that 1957 thirsting for life. So what spirit was in John's theophony that was able to talk to John if that's what happened? I'm not saying that's what happened but some people think that's what happened or can a theophony talk in heaven without a spirit in it because brother Ram said there's not a spirit in it. St. Paul in 2 Corinthians 5:es 1-5 he seems to say the theophony is simply waiting as a building in heaven. And second is what do the people do who believe in hearing from our theophony? What do they do with the quote from 1957 where brother Ram said the theophony doesn't have a spirit in it? Do they just ignore that quote or do away with it or say it was brother Ram's previous understanding but then he grew in revelation? So I'm just curious to know what they would do with that quote. And the third point is as some of the people in the comments said which was very humble. They said, "We can't say for sure John heard from himself as he was one of the 24 elders because it's not specifically stated that John was talking to John that John's theophony was talking to John's physical body." Okay. And then the second verse is Romans 8:30. Says, "Moreover, whom he did predestinate, them he also called, and whom he called, them he also justified, and whom he justified, them he also glorified." So, one of the saints on the comments shared this verse with me because brother Brandham quoted the end of this verse in 1954. Questions and answers part one. Brother Brandham said, "Your glorified body is right here at the tabernacle now. The presence of the Holy Spirit, which is your glorified condition. Your own glorified body is standing near you right now in Christ Jesus to give you a strength like a charge going into a battery. The Holy Spirit's in you. It's a charge. It's to charge your body to give you new strength to heal you from the sickness that you've got to make you well. So this quote basically says your glorified body is standing right near you to give you a charge of healing. Now again, does brother say this repeatedly time and time again. Does brother teach whole sermons on this? Not that I can find. I don't see a thus sayith the Lord in this statement. So this is not a thus sayith the Lord statement. So again, this is a possibility. It's a possibility. We hear from our theophanes. It's a possibility. Our glorified body is near us. I don't know. I can't say. I don't have any scripture that supports that. I've always thought Romans 8:30 just gives the four steps of predestination because four is an earthly number. On earth, we get to know the steps of our predestination. We're predestinated. We're called, justified, glorified. So, in closing, friends, again, I appreciate all the comments there by the grace of God. I'm still at the same spot I was when I started this little series. I still don't have two or three witnesses from scripture that clearly say we hear from our theophony or our glorified body gives us a charge of divine healing. But as the Bible says in Acts 17:11, we'll keep searching the scriptures daily whether these things be so. I certainly respect the people who take these quotes from brother Brandham and try to find biblical support for them. But it seems more likely to me that it's the Holy Ghost that I hear from and it's the Holy Ghost that heals me. And then finally on the theophony, since Brother Ram said the theophony doesn't have a spirit in it and it's waiting for us to enter into it, how can a theophony speak when it doesn't have a spirit? And either way, friends, as long as we hear from the Holy Ghost and obey the Holy Ghost, we're going to be all right. We're going to be born again because Acts 5:32 says, "God gives the Holy Ghost to them that obey him." So, we daily read our Bibles, pray, and obey the word of God, and God gives us the Holy Ghost. And then we have the down payment. We have the earnest of the resurrection that we'll get a glorified body and a theophony body. And we look at our lives, friends, we've heard the revelation on the water baptism. We've repented of our sins. We've heard the spirit tell us that the Holy Ghost, it's guided us to repent of our sins, be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, be filled with the Holy Ghost by the grace of God. We understand the Godhead. We don't add to the Bible. We don't add three persons to the scripture. We understand the mystery of the serpent seed, the revelation of the seven seals, the revelation of the seven church ages, the seven stars, and the seven golden candlesticks. We have a home church and we're gathering more as we see that day approaching. We're benefited from the labors of the five-fold ministry. It's Christ in them bringing us to a unity of the faith. So, we're so thankful that we hear from the Holy Ghost by the grace of God today. Thanks for all your feedback. Again, friends, I really appreciate it. If you have any questions, concerns, or testimonies about this video, please contact me. God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart. Very happy to be here this afternoon and again in defense of the gospel of Jesus Christ to bring the good tidings, the good news that Jesus raised from the dead, living among man today, his church. The same Jesus that was yesterday will be today and forever. He is never failed. [Music]
