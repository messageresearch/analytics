TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] a human faith in their faith of God and you must have The Godly face to believe [Music] greetings friends in the mattress name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to explain the different types of feelings love Faith fruits and more that lead to Greater revelation I personally believe these teachings are Revelations of the Holy Ghost because they help dispel confusion about these spiritual attributes and this helps the Bride of Jesus Christ to be more mature in understanding as Paul told us to be men in understanding in First Corinthians 14 20 Brethren be not children in understanding how be in Malice be children but in understanding be men also understanding these subjects will help us grow in Grace and knowledge or understanding of our Lord Jesus Christ as Peter said in second Peter 3 18 but grow in Grace and in knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ to him be glory both now and forever amen also brother Braham told us in the church age book we can have more of the same Revelation and that is what is happening today brother Branham has been off the scene for nearly 56 years but the Holy Ghost is still guiding Believers into all truth as Jesus Promised in John 16 verse 13 how be it when he the spirit of Truth is come he will guide you into all Truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come friends it is not that our Revelation is greater than God's prophet but we do have more support both scripturally and scientifically in some cases for the same Revelations God revealed to brother Branham just like brother Branham said the example brother Ram gave in the church age book was with Jesus's first coming the first prophecy was Genesis 3 15. the serpent would bruise Jesus's foot but Jesus would crush Satan's head and then down through the next four thousand years there was many many Prophecies of Jesus's first coming so over 4 000 years God gave more information brother Rams says about the same Revelation well the same thing is happening today as we are closer to the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost is giving us more understanding more information about the same Revelations let's listen to this quote from the church age book about more information of the same revelation Paul knew that first revelation was correct God can't give a first revelation then a second revelation if he did he would be changing his mind he can give a revelation and then add to it as he did in the Garden of Eden when he promised the seed to the woman and then later designated that seed had to come through Abraham and then later said it would come by the same Bloodlines in David but it was the same revelation it only gave the people more information to help them receive and understand it God's word can't change seed came exactly as revealed Hallelujah when we have Revelation on some of these topics we're going to get into we have the correct understanding a mystery is revealed so topics that were Mysteries now become Revelations and even some false doctrines can be dispelled or dismissed with the correct biblical understanding of these different subjects here's the outline for the video first we'll look at two types of fillings then four types of faith then we'll look at four types of love then we'll look at two types of temperance then we'll look at Four kinds of fruits and last we will look at two types of godliness let's begin with two types of fillings friends this topic is actually part of one of the mysteries of God is spoken of in Colossians chapter one it's the mystery of Christ in you the hope of glory so the two types of fillings are the filling of the Holy Ghost in the human Spirit or mind and the second kind is the filling or the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the soul and these are two different types of fillings this Revelation is important for understanding both the Old Testament and the New Testament and also specific quotes from God's Prophet brother Branham so beginning in the Old Testament the Bible says in numerous places that people were filled with the spirit of God and of course this can only mean in the human spirit Pharaoh recognized God's spirit in Joseph in Genesis 41 38. Pharaoh said a man in whom the spirit of God is Exodus 28 verse 3 says wise-hearted Jews were filled with the spirit of wisdom in order to make Aaron's Priestly garments Exodus 31 verses 2 through 5 says bezalia was filled with the spirit of God in all manner of workmanship and there are many more examples such as Caleb and Joshua and then even in the gospels the Bible says John the Baptist and his parents were filled with the Holy Spirit and of course this can only mean in the human Spirit or the mind the proof of this is found in John chapter 7 verses 37-39 Jesus stood and cried and said If any man thirst let him come unto me and drink then in verse 39 he said this spake he of the spirit for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because that Jesus was not yet glorified so John 7 37-39 is a major scripture for understanding these two types of feelings anyone before the day of Pentecost except for Jesus had the feeling of the holy spirit in their mind or human Spirit only and then beginning on the day of Pentecost Sinners Say by grace that were Justified and Sanctified could be filled with the Holy Ghost in their souls and then every person baptized with the Holy Ghost thereafter could be baptized in the soul but of course we know few would find that narrow road but there have been born again Holy Ghost baptized Saints in their souls since the day of Pentecost and still to this day I believe I'm one of them by the grace of God and I trust you are as well with the correct understanding of this topic friends on the two different kinds of fillings it helps us better understand quotes from Brother Branham that say something like this a Believer can be filled with the Holy Spirit and yet still be lost and go to hell well how can this make sense the only way it can make sense is if the person Brothers talking about was filled with the Holy Spirit in their minds or their human spirits and not their souls and then at some point they would have sold out the gospel like a Judas Iscariot they would have transgressed against God they would have trodden underfoot the Son of God afresh and done despite under the spirit of Grace as the book of Hebrews says and then Men cast away like Judas Iscariot the choice of your conduct you could you can't mix it now you're either far God or against God and the outward expression shows exactly what's on the inside a bird many of you think I got the badges the Holy Ghost I'm going to heaven that don't mean one thing that you're going to have it no sir you have the baptism the Holy Ghost every hour in your life and still be lost and go to hell the Bible says so it's exactly right look here you are a outside person you have five senses it contacts that outside body God gave you five senses not to contact him your Earthly home see taste feel smell in here then you have a spirit on the inside of that and conscience love and so forth five Outlets that you contact the spirit world with that with your spirit to go contacts the physical you decided that you've got you've got a soul that soul is that Jane that come from God there's one specific quote in particular that's very helpful on the subject brother random calls the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the human Spirit or mind a temporal gift so let's listen to the quote we're in the church with the wheat rest up Rejoice for the rest all the spiritual blessings is Right upon you you say well I prophesy King offices so did Balaam yes that has nothing I got the baptism the holy spirit that still has nothing to do with it only a temporal tip for you the real gift is your soul either born of God and that controls the whole thing to the word of God and the will of God and there you go and see then you are son and daughter of God you are a child of God four kinds of faith Friends by God's grace there are these four kinds of Faith the first kind is intellectual Faith this is the common human Faith every human possesses and even the common faith that angels have now the common human faith is Hebrews 10 verses 26 and 27 it says for if we sin willfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth that remaineth no more sacrifice for sins but a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation which shall Devour the adversaries so intellectual faith is Simply Having the knowledge of Truth you know the truth and then the Bible says also in Romans chapter 1 and Romans Chapter 2 that all men are without excuse on the day of judgment so everyone has an intellectual faith that there is a God because the Bible says only a fool says there's no God and then Romans chapter 1 says there are two undeniable proofs that leave every human without excuse first is God reveals himself inside each person's being or they know there's a God by their own body and mind and second all of creation or all of nature declares the glory of God and so all men are without excuse also James chapter 2 verse 19 says Thou believest that there is one God thou doest well the Devils also believe and tremble so fallen angels have this intellectual Faith or knowledge of the truth that Jesus Christ is God and they tremble at that but of course they're not saved they can never be saved second there's a saving Faith also known as justification by faith this is an anointing of God's divine nature that Peter speaks about in second Peter 1 verse 4 but saving faith is found in Ephesians 2 verses 8 and 9. for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourself it is the gift of God not of Works lest any man should boast the Third Kind of faith is the gift of faith the gift of faith is one of the nine gifts of the holy ghost from First Corinthians chapter 12 and it's different from saving Faith because the gift of faith is always present in a person's human Spirit from birth every person has a gift of the Holy Spirit and God will use it in their lives if they'll just yield themselves to that for example even Judas Iscariot had gifts of the holy spirit in his human Spirit he was sent out with a twelve to cast out Devils heal the sick raise the dead and the Bible makes it plain that Judas Iscariot operated those gifts but possessing gifts of the holy spirit does not make one saved possessing saving Faith makes someone saved and that is what Judas transgressed against that is what Judas forsook he rejected saving Faith he betrayed Christ for money the gift of faith is First Corinthians 12 verse 9 to another Faith by The Same Spirit so the gift of faith is always present in a person's human Spirit from birth on but saving Faith only comes upon a Believer after genuine repentance from sins the fourth type of faith is the fruit of Faith this is found in Galatians 5 verse 22 but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness faith again faith is one of the nine fruits of the spirit as well fruit of faith is the rarest form of Faith because it's only manifested in mature seasoned Christians whose souls are baptized with the Holy Ghost remember anyone sinner or Saint can manifest a gift of faith saving faith is more rare than the gift of faith being only present in the few Believers Jesus said would find the narrow path that leads to eternal life then of course the fruit of faith is even more rare because there's few people say but then out of the save there are even fewer who go all the way with God are guided into all truth and are baptized in their souls with the Holy Ghost four types of love the first type of Love is common human love Jesus spoke about this in Matthew 5 44 45 46 47 and 48 I'm just going to read verse 46 for if ye love them which love you what reward have ye do not even the publicans the same so Jesus says publicans are sinners can express this human love so everyone has this human love or care that they express to others but this is not the Divine love of God as we'll see soon this human love is sometimes mistaken for Christian love but it is not real Christian love brother Branham mentions this in the sermon presuming 1962 speaking of the Christian Science people he said they deny the Virgin birth they deny the blood of Jesus Christ and just talk about love so of course this group does not have the real love of God it is just a false human love let's listen to the quote foreign [Applause] second there's a type of love that the foolish virgin has which is probably brotherly kindness as stated in second Peter 1 verse 7. this is Christian love that allows a Christian who's not yet born again to keep the commands of Jesus because Jesus said in John 14 21 he that hath my commands and keepeth them he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved to my father and I will love him and will manifest myself to him so foolish virgins are still virgin to the word of God that they hold but remember they will not go all the way with the word of God so they have a love for God that keeps them undefiled from idolatry or spiritual fornication that makes them virgin to Christ but they're still foolish This Is The Love Someone Like Old Testament believer lot would have had the Bible calls him just lie in second Peter 2 verse 7 second Peter 2 verse 8 calls him a righteous man and second Peter 2 verse 9 calls him The Godly because God knows how to deliver The Godly out of Temptations so lot Abraham's nephew would have had some type of love for God a lesser love for God because he was still just righteous and godly but he wasn't nearly as devoted and full of love as Abraham was and the final proof of this is found in Matthew 25 verses 34 to 40. here we see Jesus giving the foolish virgins eternal life at the white Throne judgment and they asked Jesus when did we see you and hungered and fed you and thirsty and gave you drink or saw you as a stranger took you in or naked and clothed you or saw you in prison and came unto you and Jesus said in Matthew 25 verse 40 verily I say unto you inasmuch as ye have done it until one of the least of these my brethren you have done it unto me so These Foolish versions showed their love for other Christians Jesus's Brethren of course these were holy ghost-filled brethren in their souls the foolish version showed them Love by giving them water giving them clothes housing them visiting them in prison and other acts of Brotherly kindness the third type of Love is divine love or charity this is also known as the baptism of the Holy Ghost this is the love of the wise virgins this is spoken of in second Peter chapter 1 verses five through seven on the Statue of a pervert man the eighth and final step is Charity verse 7 says and to Godliness brotherly kindness antibody kindness charity this is the permanent love of God that God places in a believer's soul when they are sealed by the baptism of the Holy Ghost unto the day of redemption Romans 5 verse 5 says this and hope maketh not a shame because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us and of course First Corinthians 13 verses 1 through 8 speak of this love of God and this is the love that flows out of a true believer's Soul when he or she is baptized with the Holy Ghost in their souls this kind of love suffers long is kind envious not wanteth not itself is not puffed up this is the charity that never fails The Fourth Kind of Love is the fruit of love this is the most rare mature form of love this is one of the nine fruits of the Holy Ghost according to Galatians 5 verses 22 through 24. verse 22 specifically States this love but the fruit of the spirit is love we see this love in the Bible in the case of Saint Paul the Bible said he was always praying for churches like the Saints in Philippi and also we see his love for the Corinthian Church how he would write them harsh letters in order to get them to repent he had a Godly jealousy that they would remain Chase virgins unto Christ and we also see the fruit of love in Paul's life in second Corinthians chapter 11 where he gives his resume as being a true Apostle of Jesus Christ three times beaten with rods stoned once three times Shipwrecked he served Christ in hungered and thirst and fastings often and also had the daily care of all the churches this was the true love of Jesus Christ the rarest and most purest form of love the fruit of love two types of temperance friends there are two types of temperance or self-control the first is the anointing on the Statue of a perfect man a Believer receives before they're born again it is the fourth step or the fourth anointing on the Statue of a perfect man according to Second Peter chapter 1 verses five six and seven but specifically verse 6 and to knowledge temperance so this is the anointing of temperance that foolish virgins have they have a level of self-control because they're still virgin to Christ in other words they haven't committed spiritual fornication against Christ through idolatry they haven't built up Idols in their lives so in other words this anointing of temperance is part of sanctification the second work of Grace you remember friends Saints in the Old Testament could have justification and sanctification they could have these anointings of the Statue of a perfect man we see it in Joseph's life Joseph had amazing Temperance to deny Pharaoh's wife and her daily Temptations in Genesis 39 verse 9 Joseph said how then can I do this great wickedness and sin against God in verse 10 says and it came to pass as she spoke to Joseph day by day that he hearkened not unto her to lie by her or to be with her Joseph had such a strong anointing of self-control or Temperance that he turned down daily Temptations from Potiphar's wife and again we see Jesus parable of the ten virgins five were wise five were foolish so the five foolish would have had self-control they would have had an anointing of temperance because they were virgins to Christ and that's in Matthew 25 verses 1 to 13. the second type of temperance is self-control that only a mature holy ghost-filled believer can manifest and of course this is much more rare than the first kind of temperance this type of temperance is manifested by those who have the baptism of the Holy Ghost in their souls and also this Temperance is a fruit of the Holy Spirit according to Galatians 5 verse 23 meekness Temperance against such there is no law so this is even greater self-control than a Sanctified person has and we see it in Paul's life like in First Corinthians 9 27 he said but I keep under my body and bring it into subjection lest that by any means when I have preached to others I myself should be a Castaway so Paul had such power of temperance he kept his body under subjection because he didn't want to feel like he would be Cast Away he had a greater anointing of self-control we also see it in second Corinthians 11 verse 27 in weariness and painfulness in watchings often in hunger and thirst in fast things often in cold and nakedness Paul had such a powerful anointing of temperance he could fast often he could exist even in the cold weather he could persevere despite weariness he could persevere in the faith despite being hungry and thirsty that takes a great anointing of temperance and this is the mature Temperance that Holy ghost-filled Believers have because they're manifesting the fruits of the Holy Spirit four types of fruit friends there's at least four kinds of fruits the first kind is corrupt fruit which Jesus speaks about in Matthew 7 specifically verses 17 and 18. but a corrupt tree bringing forth evil fruit so of course these are sinners or make-believers like Judas Iscariot who bring forth corrupt fruit the second kind of fruit is the fruit of repentance which is the first stage of justification because remember there's three stages or steps to be born again justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost John the Baptist spoke of this in Luke 3 verse 8 but bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance so when a person genuinely repents there are fruits that come out of their lives so we can clearly see the Bible says there are fruits to repentance or fruits to justification this implies there must be fruits of sanctification because we also know there's fruits to the baptism of the Holy Ghost which are the nine fruits of the spirit so David gives us scriptures about fruits of sanctification because again David can never be baptized with the Holy Ghost in the soul the greatest level of anointing he could have would be in the human Spirit The Filling of God in his mind which no doubt he had at times Psalms one two and three speaks of this but we'll read verse 3 he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season so even in the Old Testament they could bring forth fruits of repentance justification and then fruits of sanctification as well fourth and finally is the most rare kind of fruit that's the mature fruit of the Holy Ghost baptism in the soul of the believer found in Galatians chapter 5. verse 22 but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace long-suffering gentleness goodness Faith meekness Temperance against such there is no law so amongst the Christians we have wise and foolish virgins the foolish virgins can only manifest fruits of justification sanctification but a holy ghost-filled Christian can manifest even more mature fruits and of course those are the nine fruits of the spirit and again Paul's life is a great example of this and Paul of course speaks of all these fruits and how they flow out of love in First Corinthians chapter 13. charity is patient charity is kind charity thinketh no evil charity can hope all things endure all things so we can see the connection between charity the love of God and how once that love gets in a believer's soul it will bear the nine fruits of the spirit two types of godliness friends again just like the two kinds of fillings godliness is one of the mysteries of God the Bible says in first Timothy 3 16 that there is a mystery of godliness God was manifest in the flesh and of course brother random tells us this is godliness restored to man through Jesus's life Jesus's example and then Jesus sending his holy spirit into believer's Souls so there are two types of godliness one is the initial level of devotion you receive as you approach your spiritual birth or before you're born again so in other words there is an anointing of godliness you receive as part of sanctification and it is the sixth step on the stature of a perfect man in second Peter chapter one this measure or portion of godliness or this anointing of godliness is the sixth character trait God adds to your being after he saved your soul but the second type of godliness is a mature rare spiritual state of devotion a Believer manifests after he's born again it's a pattern of holy living after your soul is baptized with the Holy Ghost this is found in numerous places but most notably in first Timothy 2 verse 2 the Bible said praying for kings and for all that are in Authority that we may lead a quiet and peaceful life in all godliness and honesty so mature godliness is godliness in every area of your life this is a much more mature godliness than just the sanctification godliness because this godliness impacts every area of a person's life so again we should see this in the difference between the foolish virgins and the wise virgins and Paul has at least five texts about mature godliness for Holy ghost-filled Believers you'll find it in Titus 1 verses 1 and 2 first Timothy 2 1-3 like I just read first Timothy 4 7-8 First Timothy 6 3-12 and second Timothy 3 1-17 in closing friends I hope this video has been a blessing the thought about these different kinds of fillings love Faith fruits Temperance and more came to me while I was writing my 2021 book about the 12 New Testament Mysteries that God revealed to brother Branham and then recently I was reminded about some of these subjects so I thought I would make a video on it quickly and share it with the Saints by the grace of God we're so thankful the Lord has given us these Revelations because they help us so much understand our lives and of course the lives of others and friends we want to strive to be the wise virgin we want to strive to have our souls baptized or fill with the Holy Ghost so we can manifest both the gift of faith and the fruit of faith mature Holy Ghost Temperance or self-control all nine fruits of the Holy Ghost according to Galatians chapter 5 and mature godliness that flows out from the soul of a holy ghost-filled believer if you have any questions concerns or testimonies please contact me thank you God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart
