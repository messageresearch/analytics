[0:12] [Applause]
[0:17] greetings friends in the mattress name
[0:19] of the Lord Jesus Christ
[0:22] the purpose of this video is to answer a
[0:24] viewer's question
[0:26] why did Brother Branham say with thus
[0:28] saith the Lord that a man could divorce
[0:30] his wife if she cut her hair
[0:34] to summarize it seems brother Branham
[0:37] said this because he was trying to
[0:38] remind the backslidden listeners that it
[0:42] is a great dishonor or repulse for a
[0:45] woman to cut her hair according to First
[0:48] Corinthians 11 verse 5. as the Greek
[0:51] lexicon's definition of Dishonor means a
[0:55] repulse
[0:57] but let me State clearly that the man
[1:00] who would make this severe and rash
[1:03] decision to divorce his wife for cutting
[1:06] her hair could not remarry another woman
[1:09] without committing adultery
[1:12] any man who divorces his wife for
[1:14] cutting her hair and then marries
[1:16] another woman is living in adultery
[1:19] and therefore cannot inherit the Kingdom
[1:21] of Heaven Jesus and his Bible are clear
[1:25] that any man that would divorce his wife
[1:27] for cutting her hair and then remarry
[1:30] would be living in adultery and thus
[1:32] would not inherit the kingdom of God
[1:34] according to Matthew 5 32 First
[1:37] Corinthians 6 verses 9 through 11 and
[1:40] Galatians 5 verses 19 through 21.
[1:44] an honest man that would divorce his
[1:46] wife for cutting her hair is sentencing
[1:49] himself to a single life according to
[1:52] the Bible and God's Prophet brother
[1:54] Branham it would seem the best decision
[1:56] a husband could make if his wife was
[1:59] cutting her hair would be to pray for
[2:01] his wife to come to repentance for
[2:04] dishonoring him Christ and God
[2:08] as a pastor I personally would never
[2:11] recommend a man divorce his wife if she
[2:14] cut her hair
[2:15] and later in the video I'll explain the
[2:17] reasons why
[2:18] but on a personal note friends divorce
[2:21] is so sad and so evil as I and my
[2:25] siblings live through my parents divorce
[2:28] it was the single most traumatic
[2:30] experience of my life
[2:32] and I'm not condemning my parents but
[2:34] just sharing it as a humble warning to
[2:36] the listeners
[2:38] I also realize there are many more more
[2:40] traumatic experiences a person can have
[2:43] and experience outside of divorce but
[2:46] I'm just sharing my life experience
[2:49] and I also realize I've been sheltered
[2:51] from more traumatic events
[2:53] but my parents divorce was the single
[2:55] most traumatic experience in my life
[2:59] and another personal note is that when I
[3:01] first heard this quote from Brother
[3:02] Branham I did not understand it I was
[3:06] very surprised to hear Brother Adam say
[3:08] this that a man could divorce his wife
[3:10] if she cut her hair I've never
[3:12] understood it
[3:13] but I feel like in time God has given me
[3:15] understanding
[3:17] and I feel like now I could answer this
[3:19] question both with scripture and also
[3:22] with sound advice or wisdom for married
[3:25] couples by the grace of our Lord Jesus
[3:27] Christ
[3:29] let me also say that this thus saith the
[3:31] Lord quote from Brother Branham that
[3:33] says a man can divorce his wife for
[3:35] cutting her hair is very easily
[3:37] misunderstood and misused by Satan if a
[3:41] person does not know his Bible and other
[3:44] brother random quotes
[3:46] friends God hates divorce and of course
[3:48] so do I
[3:49] and that's according to Malachi 2 verse
[3:51] 16.
[3:53] and I have never supported a divorce in
[3:55] my life
[3:56] I do understand some domestic situations
[3:58] are so serious that a separation is
[4:01] required usually for the woman's safety
[4:05] but again the Bible's clear about
[4:06] divorce God hates divorce
[4:10] here's the outline for the video
[4:12] first we'll review marriage and divorce
[4:15] which includes the only cause for
[4:17] remarriage after a divorce
[4:20] second we'll look at the 1956 thus saith
[4:23] the Lord quote from Brother Branham and
[4:25] will Define dishonor
[4:28] and lastly we'll look at some reasons I
[4:31] believe a man should not divorce his
[4:33] wife if she cuts her hair
[4:37] reviewing marriage and divorce and the
[4:40] only cause for remarriage after divorce
[4:44] friends as my two YouTube videos about
[4:47] marriage and divorce plainly teach there
[4:49] is one and only one condition that God
[4:51] allows divorce and remarriage which is
[4:55] unconfessed fornication
[4:58] this is a very short summary but the
[5:01] proof of this is found in two verses in
[5:03] the gospel of Matthew Matthew 5 32 Jesus
[5:08] said but I say unto you that whosoever
[5:10] shall put away his wife saving for the
[5:12] cause of fornication causes her to
[5:15] commit adultery and whosoever shall
[5:17] marry her that is divorced committeth
[5:19] adultery
[5:21] notice that Jesus says saving for the
[5:23] cause of fornication
[5:24] this means unconfessed fornication or
[5:28] sex before marriage on the part of an
[5:31] Engaged or espoused person
[5:33] so any unconfessed fornication that is
[5:37] found out later annuls the engagement
[5:39] vow of course these types of situations
[5:42] are very very rare
[5:44] and again in Matthew chapter 1 verse 19
[5:47] there's a clear Bible example that shows
[5:51] the only cause for remarriage after
[5:54] divorce and that is Matthew 1 verse 19.
[5:57] which says then Joseph her husband being
[5:59] a just man and not willing to make her a
[6:01] public example was minded to put her
[6:03] away privately
[6:05] so the Bible example is Joseph and Mary
[6:08] were vowed to each other and in the eyes
[6:10] of God they were already married but
[6:12] they weren't married yet physically and
[6:15] of course you probably know the story
[6:16] Mary conceived of the Holy Ghost
[6:19] the holy Child Jesus was conceived in
[6:21] her womb and she started showing Joseph
[6:24] found out and thought that Mary had
[6:27] committed fornication
[6:28] so Joseph was going to divorce her
[6:30] privately
[6:32] and then of course Joseph could have
[6:33] remarried if Mary had sinned but of
[6:35] course Mary did not sin
[6:37] Mary had conceived of the Holy Ghost
[6:40] so this Bible example
[6:42] is what Jesus is referring to in Matthew
[6:44] 5 32 saving for the cause of fornication
[6:48] this Bible example shows how serious a
[6:50] vow is between two people that are
[6:53] engaged or espoused in marriage
[6:57] so now we can clearly see the revelation
[6:59] of marriage and divorce how there's only
[7:02] one cause that allows a man to remarry
[7:06] after divorce and that is unconfessed
[7:08] fornication because the woman gave a
[7:11] false vow to the man
[7:13] and again this type of situation is very
[7:15] very rare
[7:17] this means friends there should be very
[7:18] very few divorces around those of us who
[7:22] claim to believe the message of the hour
[7:25] let's go through a few quotes from
[7:27] Brother Branham that forbid remarriage
[7:29] after divorce
[7:31] in the first quote from 1962 questions
[7:33] and answers brother Branham says a
[7:36] married couple can separate but they
[7:38] cannot remarry just like First
[7:40] Corinthians 7 says Paul said If a person
[7:43] depart they have two choices either stay
[7:46] apart or be reconciled they cannot marry
[7:49] again let's listen to the quote
[7:52] or the woman say to her husband I'm not
[7:55] going to mix up with that bunch of Holy
[7:57] Rollers I'm not going to do this I'll
[7:59] separate and leave you don't you leave
[8:00] the church you let her leave
[8:03] a brother or a sister is not under
[8:09] but putting you away and wants to depart
[8:11] for it you don't have to just hold on to
[8:13] him if they're wanting to leave you and
[8:15] they're going to leave you for the cause
[8:16] of Christ let them leave but
[8:19] [Music]
[8:20] God has called us unto peace
[8:26] he's already stated that but you don't
[8:29] have to live with an unbelieving husband
[8:31] or an unbelieving wife
[8:35] here's a second quote from 1961
[8:38] questions and answers
[8:40] brother Brown said he would not remarry
[8:42] his own blood brother who had a living
[8:44] spouse so brother Brandon would not
[8:47] marry his own brother because he would
[8:49] have then been living in adultery let's
[8:52] listen to the quote
[8:54] if you notice what Jesus said am I here
[8:57] I got a brother
[9:00] my own blood brother
[9:03] that's fixing to marry a woman
[9:05] and my brother
[9:07] has been married before and got a child
[9:10] by a good woman
[9:12] and he come to me to marry him and I
[9:14] said not at all
[9:17] said in Matthew
[9:19] whosoever puts away his wife and marries
[9:22] another saving the cause of fornications
[9:25] what she had to do before she was
[9:26] married and didn't tell him about it
[9:28] causes her to commit adulter whosoever
[9:30] marries her that is put away liveth in
[9:33] adultery
[9:35] so don't do that no you cannot go back
[9:38] to your to your first wife if she's been
[9:42] married again
[9:46] here in this final quote from marriage
[9:47] and divorce in 1965 brother random
[9:50] quotes Matthew 5 32 as I did earlier
[9:53] brother and plainly states
[9:55] what Jesus said when he said saving for
[9:57] the cause of fornication
[9:59] and again this quote has to line up with
[10:01] the other quotes brother Braham said
[10:04] that say there is no remarriage after
[10:06] divorce saving for the cause of
[10:08] unconfessed fornication
[10:10] friends many people misunderstand the
[10:13] marriage and divorce sermon from 1965
[10:15] but that's because they don't pray
[10:17] enough about it they don't seek the
[10:19] Bible enough about it
[10:21] let's listen to the quote
[10:25] I want you to know sure to support this
[10:28] same idea of one in many
[10:32] Matthew 30 uh I think it's Matthew 5 32.
[10:39] 31 to begin with
[10:41] it has been said whosoever shall put
[10:44] away his wife let him give her a writing
[10:47] of divorcement
[10:49] us Jesus speaking once said from the
[10:51] beginning my wife
[10:53] but I say unto you that whosoever shall
[10:57] put away his wife
[10:58] saving the cause of fornications causes
[11:02] her
[11:03] two
[11:05] commit adultery
[11:06] see whosoever shall put away his wife
[11:09] saving the cause of fornication causes
[11:11] her to commit adultery watch your Mary
[11:14] again and whosoever married her and is
[11:17] divorced committed adultery
[11:20] see she's got a living husband so no man
[11:22] can marry her
[11:24] I don't care what she does and who she
[11:25] is she's got a living husband there's no
[11:27] grounds for her at all
[11:28] but it's not for him causes her not him
[11:32] get it you'll have to make the word
[11:34] running continuity
[11:36] see nothing's saying he couldn't but she
[11:39] can't
[11:40] okay causes her not him
[11:44] that's exactly what the Bible says here
[11:48] it is not stated against him to remarry
[11:52] but her
[11:56] and the time
[12:00] the 1956 thus saith the Lord quote
[12:04] and a definition for dishonor
[12:07] before we listen to this quote from
[12:09] God's Prophet brother Branham I want to
[12:11] State four details about it to help us
[12:13] correctly understand it
[12:15] first brother Brahm is preaching on Luke
[12:17] 7 verse 36. that's the context of his
[12:21] sermon where the sinner woman uses her
[12:23] long hair to wash Jesus's feet it's
[12:26] obvious she could not have washed his
[12:28] holy feet with bobbed hair
[12:30] and the Bible never records God asking
[12:32] any godly woman to cut her hair
[12:34] so in the context brother Branham is
[12:36] rebuking modern women for cutting their
[12:39] hair when there is absolutely no Bible
[12:41] Authority for a Godly woman to cut her
[12:44] hair
[12:45] second brother Branham never says the
[12:48] man who divorces his wife can remarry an
[12:51] honest person will listen to the quote
[12:53] and realize brother Branham never says
[12:55] the man can remarry another woman
[12:57] so in other words many people add to
[13:00] this quote from 1956 they add their own
[13:02] interpretation to their own shame
[13:05] these people likely add to the Bible as
[13:07] well they add their own human
[13:09] interpretations or their own human
[13:10] opinions
[13:12] third we must not take away or delete
[13:15] other quotes and scriptures
[13:17] when we listened to this 1956 quote for
[13:21] example like God hates divorce in
[13:23] Malachi 2 verse 16.
[13:25] friends we cannot ignore so many other
[13:27] quotes from Brother Branham that command
[13:29] a couple to stay together if at all
[13:31] possible
[13:32] and never marry a second third or more
[13:34] time
[13:36] and fourth friends remember when a woman
[13:38] cuts her hair she's trying to assert
[13:40] Authority like when she puts on man's
[13:43] pants
[13:44] and friends I've seen this in my own
[13:46] life I've heard numerous women in
[13:49] passing say they're going to go get
[13:50] their hair cut and show their husband
[13:52] who's the Boss
[13:53] and these women are not even message
[13:55] believers they understand when they cut
[13:57] their hair they're dishonoring their
[13:59] husband and taking control in the
[14:01] marriage
[14:03] now friends let's listen to the quote
[14:05] from 1956 from the worst sinner in the
[14:08] city
[14:11] [Applause]
[14:21] [Applause]
[14:29] stay up the Lord
[14:32] too bad you got away from the
[14:34] old-fashioned training good one
[14:36] you used to sing a song as far as we
[14:38] compromise with sin put it out of the
[14:40] bars that she got out but how did the
[14:41] goats get in he just went out
[14:44] yes
[14:45] [Applause]
[15:04] that's the way you gotta come to him
[15:07] [Applause]
[15:12] amen
[15:13] [Applause]
[15:22] now let's define dishonor in First
[15:24] Corinthians 11 verse 5 because this will
[15:26] show us the Divine severity of a woman
[15:29] cutting her hair and also a man letting
[15:31] his hair grow uncut so we want to be
[15:34] fair we want to show the dishonor of a
[15:37] woman cutting her hair but also a
[15:38] husband growing his hair out uncut
[15:42] a wife who cuts her hair is a great
[15:44] dishonor as First Corinthians 11 verse 5
[15:47] says and she dishonors her head which is
[15:50] her husband and then in turn that
[15:52] dishonors his head who is Christ and the
[15:55] head of Christ who is the Father
[15:56] Almighty invisible God
[15:58] First Corinthians 11 verse 5 says but
[16:01] every woman that prayeth or prophesieth
[16:02] with her head uncovered dishonoreth her
[16:05] head for that is even all one as if she
[16:09] were shaven
[16:10] in the Greek dishonor means
[16:12] to dishonor disgrace to put the shame
[16:15] blush with shame one is said to be put
[16:19] to shame who suffers a repulse or whom
[16:22] some Hope Has deceived
[16:24] so according to the infallible gospel
[16:26] that Jesus Christ revealed to Paul
[16:28] according to Galatians 1 verse 12. and
[16:31] which will judge the secrets of every
[16:33] man's heart according to Romans 2 verse
[16:35] 16 and which cannot be added to or taken
[16:38] away without a curse coming upon a
[16:41] person according to Galatians 1 verses 6
[16:44] through 12 a wife that cuts her hair
[16:47] shames her husband and should make the
[16:50] husband blush with shame and causes him
[16:52] to suffer a repulse which is intense
[16:56] distaste
[16:58] so notice the severity of the dishonor a
[17:01] woman puts upon her husband when she
[17:02] cuts her hair
[17:03] it is a repulse intense distaste
[17:08] so this is why I believe brother random
[17:09] gave this warning in 1956 but again
[17:12] brother Branham never said the man could
[17:14] remarry
[17:15] now the same dishonor is true for a man
[17:18] who doesn't cut his hair he's a shame or
[17:21] vile according to First Corinthians 11
[17:23] verse 14 the scripture says doth not
[17:26] even nature itself teach you that if a
[17:28] man have long hair it is a shame unto
[17:30] him
[17:31] and shame means vile shame reproach
[17:35] dishonor disgrace
[17:38] so let's not leave out the warning
[17:40] against brothers who would grow out
[17:41] their hair and leave it uncut they would
[17:44] be dishonoring Christ and God
[17:47] friends another important scripture is
[17:49] revelation 9 verse 8 speaking of the
[17:52] fifth trumpet which is God's Wrath
[17:55] during the tribulation period the Bible
[17:57] said and they which were the locusts
[18:00] that come out of the Earth had hair as
[18:03] the hair of women and their teeth were
[18:05] as the teeth of lions and the Bible says
[18:08] power was given to them to hurt men five
[18:11] months in Revelation 9 verse 10.
[18:14] so these scriptures show that God is
[18:16] going to torment Sinners who cut their
[18:18] hair during the tribulation period
[18:21] God allows these locusts to have long
[18:23] hair like women to torment the women who
[18:25] cut their hair and Bob their hair
[18:27] and assert the authority of their
[18:29] husbands or their fathers
[18:31] so we can see how this verse lines up
[18:33] with First Corinthians 11 verse 5.
[18:36] it is a great dishonor for a woman to
[18:38] cut her hair it's a great dishonor for a
[18:40] man to grow out his hair long and Uncut
[18:44] and this reminds me of a quote from
[18:45] Brother Branham where he said the closer
[18:48] you get to heaven the closer you get to
[18:49] the glory of God and the incredibly holy
[18:52] presence of Jesus Christ were the angels
[18:54] of God are crying holy holy holy the
[18:57] more sinful that sin really is let's
[19:00] listen to the quote
[19:02] now we'll take the Pentecostal woman she
[19:05] shouldn't wear shorts make up her cut
[19:08] her hair
[19:09] but she looks back down at the Methodist
[19:12] say look at that woman do so and so
[19:15] say the woman don't wear shorts
[19:17] he said look at herself with a volunteer
[19:22] how are you Rising God the more sinful a
[19:25] whole thing looks
[19:28] and then sometimes in prayer you can
[19:30] imagine
[19:32] for the Holy Spirit
[19:35] thank you
[19:36] there
[19:37] in the whole thing of scales
[19:41] then when they come back down you seem
[19:42] like you're the people you're a rascal
[19:46] yeah yeah nothing but an old sarcastic
[19:50] you're a fool
[19:53] because you stand as an old crazy
[19:56] people
[19:58] whatever kind of them spheres
[20:00] where you can be in the presence
[20:03] of the emotion
[20:05] and your mind
[20:07] Holy Spirit lifting up the whole thing
[20:10] is
[20:11] the glory of the Lord has departed from
[20:14] the whole denominational outfit
[20:18] none of them that's right
[20:23] other reasons a man should not divorce
[20:26] his wife for cutting your hair
[20:29] friends here's a few reasons I think a
[20:31] man should not divorce his wife for
[20:33] simply cutting her hair
[20:35] first the husband has probably
[20:37] Dishonored his wife repeatedly
[20:39] and so why would a husband divorce his
[20:42] wife for dishonoring him when he's
[20:44] probably Dishonored her as well
[20:48] friends I'll just be honest and use my
[20:49] own marriage I think in my own marriage
[20:51] I probably dishonor my wife more than
[20:54] she dishonors me my wife has never cut
[20:56] her hair but of course she still sins
[20:58] every day like I sin every day
[21:01] but it's my opinion I proudly sinned
[21:02] against her way more than she sinned
[21:04] against me so why would I or any other
[21:07] man want to be so harsh against our
[21:09] wives if they Dishonored us
[21:11] and how could we be so harsh when we're
[21:13] guilty of the same type of Dishonor I
[21:17] believe it's hypocritical and sinful for
[21:19] a man to divorce his wife or dishonor if
[21:22] he is also dishonoring his wife
[21:25] and this is commanded in scripture first
[21:27] Peter 3 verse 7 commands husbands to
[21:30] honor their wives
[21:32] likewise your husbands dwell with him
[21:34] according to knowledge giving honor unto
[21:36] the wife as unto the weaker vessel and
[21:39] as being heirs together of the grace of
[21:41] life that your prayers be not hindered
[21:44] notice God will not hear husbands
[21:46] prayers if they dishonor their wives
[21:49] and remember according to Malachi 2 God
[21:51] is the witness between the husband and
[21:53] the wife
[21:54] and God will chase in the husband who
[21:56] mistreats his wife if he dishonors his
[21:58] wife
[22:00] husband should honor their wives because
[22:02] she is both your spouse and your sister
[22:06] another reason I believe husband should
[22:08] not divorce their wives for cutting
[22:10] their hair is because you made a vow to
[22:12] love her until death
[22:15] and brothers didn't you love your wife
[22:16] when you married her and didn't you want
[22:19] to love her unto death as long as you
[22:22] both lived
[22:23] as husbands and leaders we cannot forget
[22:25] the vows we made we cannot forget the
[22:28] first love we had for our wives
[22:30] another reason is as a husband as a man
[22:34] you're supposed to be like Christ loving
[22:36] the church
[22:37] isn't Christ merciful and forgiving and
[22:41] patient with his church when his church
[22:43] dishonors the word of God brother
[22:45] Branham said we sin daily no doubt the
[22:47] Bible agrees with that Paul said I Must
[22:49] Die daily
[22:51] so in the spiritual sense all of us as
[22:53] part of the church we daily dishonor
[22:54] Christ we think the wrong thoughts we
[22:57] say the wrong words we sin against God
[22:59] and yet God is merciful when we dishonor
[23:02] him he's merciful to convict us and then
[23:05] forgive us of our sins
[23:07] and one final reason is Brothers didn't
[23:09] you marry your wife because you believe
[23:11] she was your Eternal mate in glory
[23:14] sometimes Brothers forget that quote
[23:16] from Brother Branham where he said your
[23:18] wife should be your Eternal mate in
[23:19] glory always your sweetheart and the
[23:22] quotes where he said never let your
[23:24] honeymoon end
[23:25] a man whose wife cuts her hair should be
[23:28] patient should be prayerful should
[23:30] commit her soul to God stay with her be
[23:33] patient with her pray for her if she's
[23:36] open to it help explain the word of God
[23:39] and what it says about cutting hair
[23:41] take an eternal perspective to the
[23:44] situation think that you're going to
[23:46] spend eternity with this eternal mate
[23:48] and you'll love her and be patient with
[23:51] her until she's able to repent and fully
[23:53] obey the word of God
[23:56] in closing
[23:58] friends I hope this video has been a
[24:00] blessing this topic has always been a
[24:02] question on my heart since I heard this
[24:04] quote from 1956 but I believe now by the
[24:07] grace of God the Holy Spirit has
[24:08] directed me to other quotes from Brother
[24:09] Branham and of course many other
[24:11] scriptures where I'm able to give a
[24:13] sound biblical response to the question
[24:15] why did brother Brandon say this
[24:18] any honest person will see how the Bible
[24:21] plainly says a woman cutting her hair
[24:23] dishonors her husband repulses her
[24:26] husband
[24:27] but also an honest person will say that
[24:29] a man should never dishonor his wife
[24:31] so both the husband and wife need to
[24:33] honor one another
[24:35] they should be patient kind loving with
[24:37] one another they should have the love of
[24:39] First Corinthians 13. charity is patient
[24:42] charity is kind charity thinketh no evil
[24:44] charity can suffer all things when one
[24:47] spouse dishonors the other
[24:49] the one who's Dishonored with God's love
[24:52] should have long suffering for their
[24:54] spouse
[24:55] and Friends remember God hates divorce
[24:58] when dishonor happens in a marriage the
[25:01] spouse who is Dishonored must devote
[25:03] serious time to prayer fasting seeking
[25:06] God finding the leading of the Lord
[25:09] and I believe if a person does that if a
[25:11] spouse does that God will show them
[25:13] first Corinthians 13 and they'll Express
[25:15] all 16 of those attributes of divine
[25:18] love to their spouse
[25:21] if you have any questions concerns or
[25:24] testimonies about this video please
[25:26] contact me
[25:28] God bless you and may Jesus Christ be
[25:30] the desire of your heart
