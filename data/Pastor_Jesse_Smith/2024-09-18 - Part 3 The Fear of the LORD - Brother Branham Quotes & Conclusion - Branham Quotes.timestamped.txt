[0:03] and the spirit of the Lord shall rest
[0:05] upon him the spirit of wisdom of
[0:09] understanding the spirit of counsel
[0:11] might the spirit of knowledge and the
[0:14] fear of the Lord and shall make him of
[0:19] quick understanding and the fear of the
[0:23] Lord greetings friends in the matchless
[0:25] name of the Lord Jesus Christ the
[0:27] purpose of this video is to do a part
[0:29] three on the fear of the Lord in this
[0:32] video we're going to look at the quotes
[0:33] from God's Prophet brother William
[0:35] brandham about the fear of the Lord and
[0:37] we'll also bring this to a conclusion by
[0:38] the grace of God so let's begin with
[0:41] four quotes with the exact phrase of the
[0:44] fear of the Lord from God's Prophet
[0:46] brother brandham the first one is that
[0:48] Israel was at the Red Sea and they had
[0:50] separated from Egypt with the fear of
[0:52] the Lord and remember the Bible told us
[0:54] the fear of the Lord was to hate evil so
[0:57] Israel hated Egypt and then they
[0:59] departed from the evil so both those
[1:02] elements apply to the fear of the Lord
[1:03] you must hate evil and then depart from
[1:05] it let's listen to the quote 1956 Divine
[1:08] love and Sovereign
[1:09] Grace now there's the Israel right in
[1:13] the corner after stepping out the serve
[1:17] the Lord here they are back right up
[1:20] death charging right to them the dust of
[1:22] the wheels are coming the desert they
[1:25] being entangled out there somewhere and
[1:26] just slore them down if they started
[1:28] that way there there was a Red Sea
[1:31] before them and they couldn't get across
[1:32] that what are they going to
[1:34] do isn't this
[1:36] strange are heavenly father just saying
[1:39] back then we just watch this picture
[1:43] develop in the second quote brother Ram
[1:45] said the fear of the Lord went before
[1:47] Joshua and blind bmus had remembered
[1:49] that and that's true the fear of the
[1:51] Lord was upon all of Jericho the true
[1:54] anointing of the fear of the Lord though
[1:55] came on Rahab and her household only for
[1:58] only they were saved the fear of the
[2:00] Lord makes you depart from Evil hate
[2:02] evil and so the only ones in Jericho
[2:05] that wanted to be saved were Rahab and
[2:07] her family they had the token let's
[2:09] listen to the quote then he remember
[2:12] just out from that gate that great
[2:15] Joshua had marched Israel right over
[2:18] those same cobblestones right around the
[2:21] walls of
[2:23] Jericho and all of Jericho was shut
[2:27] up although they had the Israelite
[2:30] numbered many times but the fear of the
[2:32] Lord went before them amen they held
[2:36] their
[2:37] peace in 1961 the sixfold purpose of
[2:40] Daniel's visit to Gabriel Brother Bram
[2:42] read Isaiah
[2:45] 11: 1-9 and of course this is a text
[2:48] about the Millennium that's what brother
[2:50] R is talking about in the six full
[2:51] purpose of Gabriel's visit he was
[2:53] showing how one of the purposes of
[2:55] Gabriel's visit was to show Daniel when
[2:58] the most holy would be anointed
[3:00] and of course that's the millennial
[3:01] Temple receiving Jesus because brother
[3:04] Ram says Jesus is already anointed but
[3:06] when Jesus steps into the most holy
[3:08] place in the millennial Temple then it
[3:10] will be anointed and this is the Bible
[3:13] text of course where it goes through the
[3:14] anointing Upon Jesus it's a beautiful
[3:17] text let's listen to the quote listen
[3:20] everybody close now this is doing the
[3:23] time of the
[3:25] Millennium when the most holy is
[3:28] Anointed and there shall come forth a
[3:31] rod out of the stem of Jesse a branch
[3:34] that shall grow out of his roots who was
[3:37] that
[3:39] Christ out of his roots and the spirit
[3:42] of the Lord shall rest upon him the
[3:45] spirit of wisdom of understanding the
[3:48] spirit of counsel might the spirit of
[3:51] knowledge and the fear of the Lord and
[3:55] shall make him of quick understanding
[3:59] and the ear of the Lord and the Wolf
[4:03] also shall dwell with the lamb amen and
[4:07] the leopard shall lie down with the kid
[4:09] that's a goat and the calf and the Young
[4:13] Lion and the
[4:16] fatling The Lion and the Fatman together
[4:20] and a little child shall lead them the
[4:25] fourth and final quote with the exact
[4:27] words fear the lord is from presuming
[4:29] 196 62 brother brand again refers to
[4:32] Jericho and Joshua how the fear of the
[4:33] Lord was upon Jericho again Rahab was
[4:36] the only one who got under the true
[4:38] anointing of the fear of the Lord that's
[4:40] why she got saved that's why she had the
[4:41] token I want to bring a scripture in
[4:43] here it seems like all of Jericho was
[4:45] under the partial fear of the Lord and
[4:48] that's something I didn't cover in this
[4:49] series perhaps I'll do a separate video
[4:51] on it but the partial fear of the Lord
[4:53] is found in 2 Kings
[4:54] 17: 24- 41 the Babylonians had a partial
[4:59] fear of the Lord enough fear of the Lord
[5:01] to keep the Lions away yet they enjoyed
[5:03] secret sin and idolatry so this seems to
[5:06] be the fear of the Lord like Judas es
[5:08] scarat may have had we'd say the
[5:11] borderline Believers so most of the
[5:13] people in Jericho in the days of Joshua
[5:15] had a partial fear of the Lord they knew
[5:17] God was with the army of Joshua but they
[5:19] didn't have the full fear of the Lord in
[5:21] order to repent hate evil and be saved
[5:23] but let's listen to the quote Joshua he
[5:26] said we're more than able to good we're
[5:30] more than able why said they're only
[5:32] bread for
[5:34] us why they look great they are great
[5:37] but we have great
[5:39] bread yes said God gave us a promise and
[5:43] the fear of us is up on every one of
[5:45] them yet they different with us yet
[5:48] they're scared of us
[5:50] am sure said the fear of fear of the
[5:53] Lord's up on every one of them they're
[5:54] scared to death of us said let's go take
[5:57] it God give it to us so it's ours let's
[5:59] move on take it next there's only five
[6:01] quotes with the exact phrase beginning
[6:03] of wisdom from God's Prophet brother
[6:05] brandham brother Bram said Noah had the
[6:07] fear of the Lord and was saved this is
[6:09] from the message of Grace 1961 let's
[6:11] listen to the quote the grace of God
[6:13] reached over in Noah's
[6:15] time Noah just an ordinary
[6:19] man he and his family but because Noah
[6:23] feared
[6:25] God he believed God you can't fear God
[6:28] without believing how how can you fear
[6:30] something you don't
[6:31] believe you've got to fear God Solomon
[6:35] said the fear of God's beginning of
[6:36] wisdom yes amen now just the fear of God
[6:40] you're beginning to have wisdom and the
[6:43] fear of God Noah feared the Lord and he
[6:47] believed the Lord amen and that's what
[6:50] God honors is your faith in
[6:53] him that's right then when the fear of
[6:57] God come upon Noah God called him by
[7:01] grace and saved him in his
[7:04] house because it was Grace that did it
[7:08] not because Noah was a great big
[7:10] handsomer man than all the rest of them
[7:12] not because Noah went to the best Church
[7:14] there was in the country not because he
[7:16] belonged to the best in organization not
[7:19] because he could dress better not
[7:20] because he had more money not because he
[7:23] was some special person but because of
[7:26] the grace of God God saved Noah
[7:30] Grace save Noah the next quote is from
[7:34] respects
[7:35] 1961 the fear of the Lord was the second
[7:38] set of scriptures brother bandam used
[7:40] the first opening text was Psalms 105:
[7:43] 50 do my prophets no harm touch not M
[7:46] anointed and then right after the text
[7:48] Brother R went into the fear of the Lord
[7:51] he read Ecclesiastes 12 about the whole
[7:53] conclusion of the matter being to fear
[7:55] the lord then he said the fear of the
[7:57] Lord is the beginning of wisdom so it
[7:59] seems like the fear of the Lord and not
[8:02] touching God's anointed prophets and
[8:04] doing them no harm is the foundation for
[8:06] that sermon respects 1961 let's listen
[8:09] to the quote saying touch not my
[8:12] anointed and do my prophets no harm
[8:16] hallelujah praise our God I want to take
[8:20] a a subject from there of
[8:25] respect reading here David crying out to
[8:29] the Lord
[8:31] respects is what we owe to
[8:35] God and that's one thing that I would
[8:37] like to uh drill this to the heart of
[8:42] every person here tonight that in all
[8:45] things that we see going on we must give
[8:48] respects to it amen see we must respect
[8:53] it and David said that when they were
[8:57] very few men of Israel perhaps Abraham
[9:00] Isaac and Jacob who is speaking on very
[9:04] few men that he rebuked Nations and
[9:07] Kings for them God rebuked the Nations
[9:11] and Kings saying touch not my anointed
[9:13] and do my prophets no
[9:15] harm over in Ecclesiastes the 12th
[9:18] chapter and the 13th verse it's written
[9:21] like this see let us share the
[9:23] conclusion of the whole matter fear God
[9:27] and keep his Commandments for this is
[9:28] the full duty of man the conclusion of
[9:32] the whole matter is to fear
[9:34] God and when you cannot have respects
[9:37] until you have fear you've got to have
[9:41] fear of God Solomon said also in the
[9:44] Proverbs that the fear of God is the
[9:47] beginning of wisdom amen the fear of God
[9:51] is the beginning of wisdom now that
[9:55] don't mean that you're afraid of him but
[9:57] that means that you're giving him
[9:58] respect and
[10:00] reverence and when you respect God you
[10:03] fear God you fear that you might
[10:06] displease him in some way you fear L you
[10:09] would do something wrong you wouldn't
[10:11] want to I fear my mother I fear my my
[10:16] wife I fear my church I fear all of
[10:19] God's servants unless I should put a
[10:21] stumbling box somewhere in their
[10:23] way I I fear the people I fear the
[10:26] people of the city unless I should do
[10:28] something wrong wrong that would cause
[10:30] them to think that I wasn't a Christian
[10:33] see you've got before you can have
[10:36] respect you've got to have fear and God
[10:40] demands it he demands
[10:43] respects God does he demands it and fear
[10:47] brings it and we know that fear brings
[10:52] respects the next quote 1963 the way of
[10:55] a true Prophet I love how brother R uses
[10:57] the fear of the Lord as the beginning of
[10:58] wisdom with Amos
[11:00] 3:7 remember Amos 3:7 says surely the
[11:03] Lord will do nothing but he revealed his
[11:05] secret unto his servants the prophets
[11:07] brother R is talking about how the fear
[11:09] of the Lord will respect a prophet and
[11:11] of course brother ROM is showing how
[11:13] he's a prophet so we see True Believers
[11:16] have the fear of the Lord when a prophet
[11:18] speaks with thus say the Lord and that's
[11:20] what brother Ram did let's listen to the
[11:21] quote when a Li and Roth see who cannot
[11:26] fear and the fear of God is beginning of
[11:29] which wisdom is that right that's what
[11:31] the wise man said the fear of
[11:33] God now I want you people in that prayer
[11:37] line stand there all you that know that
[11:39] I know nothing about you raise up your
[11:42] hands
[11:45] everyone the good Lord of Heaven being
[11:47] my judge as far as I know in my life
[11:50] I've never seen one of them in my life
[11:52] they probably seen me from sitting out
[11:54] in the
[11:54] audience in the next quote God's power
[11:56] to transform 1965 brother Ram said
[11:58] people have lost the fear of the Lord in
[12:01] respects to thus sayith the Lord he said
[12:03] people used to tremble at the word of
[12:05] the Lord with thus sayith the Lord but
[12:07] they don't anymore they've lost the
[12:09] scare of it they don't fear God brother
[12:10] brandham said and that's so true brother
[12:12] brandham can say something like
[12:13] trinitarianism is of the devil thus
[12:15] sayith the Lord people don't tremble at
[12:17] that they're so indoctrinated with their
[12:20] additions to the Bible like three
[12:22] persons and father son Holy Ghost
[12:24] sprinkling or even baptism when the book
[12:27] of Acts shows baptism only happens in
[12:29] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[12:31] brother R gave us thus sayith the Lord
[12:33] on the godhead there's one person thus
[12:35] sayith the Lord on the true baptism the
[12:36] Lord Jesus Christ thus sayi the Lord on
[12:39] marriage and divorce only one man and
[12:41] one woman they're married until death
[12:44] there's only one cause for divorce and
[12:46] remarriage and it's extremely rare
[12:49] brother Ram said women or men can dance
[12:51] in the spirit shout speak in tongues but
[12:54] if a woman cuts her hair she's dead
[12:56] that's thus sayith the Lord people don't
[12:57] fear that anymore so many more examples
[13:00] but it's a powerful statement by Brother
[13:01] Bram let's listen to the quote it seems
[13:04] that people's lost your common deceny
[13:06] and modesty they're not like they used
[13:08] to be they used to be when the prophet
[13:11] said thus sayith the Lord the people
[13:14] trembled yes it certainly didn't the
[13:17] people moved for they was afraid but now
[13:21] they lost all their scare of it they
[13:24] don't fear God Solomon said the the fear
[13:27] of God is the beginning of wisd wisdom
[13:29] it's the beginning of it but the prophet
[13:31] can speak thus sayith the Lord people
[13:34] say nonsense see there's not a hope for
[13:38] them it's they say well we're smart
[13:41] we're intellectual we don't have to take
[13:42] that kind of stuff we know what we're
[13:44] talking about and last but not least the
[13:46] final quote is from the invisible Union
[13:48] of the bride of Christ 1965 brother
[13:51] Brandon prayed for the fear or trembling
[13:53] at the word of God before preaching the
[13:55] visible union he said the fear of God is
[13:57] the beginning of wisdom it's a humble
[13:59] simple powerful prayer let's listen to
[14:01] the
[14:02] quote May your spirit fall upon us and
[14:06] anoint the word to our hearts that we
[14:08] might go from here this evening better
[14:11] people than we are now and we might have
[14:15] a closer Insight on Jesus
[14:20] Christ granted Lord that we might
[14:23] understand the day that we're living in
[14:26] and the preparation of God for people in
[14:29] this
[14:31] hour this great crucial dark time that
[14:35] we're now living
[14:38] in God anoint us not only speaker but
[14:43] hearer and
[14:45] together make our hearts to tremble at
[14:47] your
[14:50] word for the fear of God is the
[14:53] beginning of
[14:54] wisdom Grant these things father for we
[14:58] ask it in Jesus Jesus name
[15:06] amen I'd like to title these few remarks
[15:09] that I was going to make here and some
[15:12] scriptures that I would like to follow
[15:14] up closely behind if the Lord willing to
[15:18] the uh the Thanksgiving message to the
[15:22] invisable of the
[15:25] invisable Union of the bride of Christ
[15:29] the invisible Union of the bride of
[15:34] Christ it doesn't sound like a
[15:37] Thanksgiving
[15:39] message though
[15:42] any uh scripture we thankful for all of
[15:47] it
[15:49] conclusion friends hope this Series has
[15:51] been a blessing by the grace of God
[15:53] again as I look at this screen from the
[15:55] Old Testament verses the fear of the
[15:57] Lord is all incompass ing it seems the
[16:00] fear of the Lord is your confidence your
[16:02] Refuge your Fountain of Life your source
[16:04] of Happiness it's your future
[16:07] reward it's the conclusion of life's
[16:09] purpose in the New Testament it's the
[16:12] same it's your source of God's mercy
[16:14] it's your hope in the last moments
[16:16] before death it's your motivation for
[16:18] perfecting Holiness in your life the key
[16:21] to a loving
[16:22] marriage your acceptance with God your
[16:26] humility as you work out your own
[16:27] salvation
[16:29] it's your mindset for sojourning here in
[16:32] service to God and so much more so we
[16:36] see the fear of the Lord is the
[16:37] conclusion of the matter it's the
[16:39] meaning of life in both the Old
[16:41] Testament and the New Testament this is
[16:43] an
[16:44] all-encompassing anointing and that's
[16:46] what it is it's an anointing of the Holy
[16:48] Ghost as we saw in the life of Jesus in
[16:50] Isaiah 11 1-3 friends if this is the
[16:53] anointing Jesus Christ had that's the
[16:55] anointing we need for our lives we need
[16:58] the an anointing of the fear of the Lord
[17:00] to hate evil to depart from Evil to love
[17:03] righteousness and obey God and have
[17:06] loving obedience to the word of God
[17:09] profound adoration for God profound
[17:11] honor for God that's the anointing we
[17:14] need and we can have by the grace of God
[17:17] friends I just believe the fear of the
[17:18] Lord this must be the anointing of the
[17:20] onfire condition of Revelation
[17:23] 3:15 Jesus said we're either going to be
[17:26] on fire lukewarm or hot having the fear
[17:29] of the Lord anointing it must be the
[17:30] onfire anointing in other words the
[17:32] baptism of the Holy Ghost this must be
[17:34] an anointing on someone who has the
[17:36] baptism of the Holy Ghost in the New
[17:38] Testament for again that's what Isaiah
[17:40] 11 1-3 said about Jesus Jesus had the
[17:42] fear of the Lord of course the spirit of
[17:44] knowledge Spirit of understanding the
[17:46] spirit of the fear of the Lord and he
[17:48] was baptized with the Holy Ghost as the
[17:50] Bible says and this must be the
[17:52] anointing on the wise version because
[17:55] she has extra oil she has the baptism of
[17:57] the Holy Ghost she wants wants to stay
[17:59] pure from all evil because her Lord her
[18:02] husband Jesus died and he was cursed
[18:05] with evil the Bible said cursed is
[18:07] anyone who hangs on a tree Jesus Took on
[18:09] our curse that we might receive his
[18:12] Blessing he was made sin that we might
[18:14] become his righteousness so here's a few
[18:17] more slides in conclusion wisdom from
[18:19] the fear of the Lord is your tree of
[18:21] life it's your principal thing Proverbs
[18:25] 4:7 the fear of the Lord helps you grow
[18:28] in all wisdom or maturity according to
[18:30] Daniel 1:4 Ephesians 18 Colossians 1:9
[18:34] Colossians 1:29 and Colossians 3 16 the
[18:37] Bible speaks of all wisdom on at least
[18:40] five
[18:41] occasions so if the fear of the Lord is
[18:43] the beginning of wisdom the way you get
[18:45] to all wisdom is continuing to walk in
[18:47] the fear of the Lord over the course of
[18:49] many years decades and then your mature
[18:52] Holy Ghost filled Christian walking in
[18:54] all wisdom friends we want to be like
[18:56] Jesus Christ so let's have order of
[18:58] prayer that God will help us to walk in
[19:00] this anointing father God we thank you
[19:03] for these scriptures on the fear of the
[19:04] Lord Lord we can see that you put this
[19:06] anointing on your son so God help us as
[19:09] the Bride of the Son of God the New
[19:12] Testament Church the Bride of Jesus
[19:14] Christ help us to walk under the
[19:16] anointing of the fear of the Lord we
[19:17] need it every hour Lord God we want to
[19:19] be on fire we want to have extra oil we
[19:22] want to be ready for your coming Lord
[19:23] God so we ask that that anointing would
[19:25] rest upon us and we would be able to
[19:27] mature Beyond pass the beginning of the
[19:30] fear of the Lord and mature into all
[19:32] wisdom because we want to be the wise
[19:35] virgin Grant it Lord God we know all
[19:37] things are possible to them that believe

[19:46] helps us to know you in the power of
[19:48] your resurrection and the fellowship of
[19:49] your sufferings so father I pray for
[19:52] this anointing to be on your people and
