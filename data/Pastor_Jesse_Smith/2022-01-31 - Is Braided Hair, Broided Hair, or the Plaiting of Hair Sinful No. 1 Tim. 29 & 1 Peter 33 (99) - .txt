TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] no not braiding hair not today braided hair is pretty [Music] greetings friends in the matchless name of the lord jesus christ is braided hair or broided hair or the plating of hair sinful the answer is no this may be surprising to some who reference both first timothy 2 verse 9 and first peter 3 verse 3 but a careful reading of these scriptures in context along with comparison to other hair and gold and jewelry scriptures show the braiding style of hair is not sinful as long as the cost for the styling is not excessive just like the wearing of gold and jewelries acceptable as long as the cost of the gold or jewelry is not excessive let's begin by reading both first timothy 2 verse 9 and first peter 3 verse 3. first timothy 2 verse 9 and 10 says in like manner also that women adorn themselves in modest apparel with shame-faceness and sobriety not with broided hair or gold or pearls or costly array but which becometh women professing godliness with good works first peter 3 verses 3 and 4 say who's adorning let it not be that outward adorning or plating the hair and of wearing of gold or of putting on of apparel but let it be the hidden man of the heart in that which is not corruptable even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit which is in the sight of god of great price i want to examine the greek meanings of both broided and plating the greek meaning of broided in 1st timothy 2 verse 9 is what is woven plated or twisted together a web plate braid braided hair the greek word for plating in 1st peter 3 verse 3 means an interweaving braiding a knot an elaborate gathering of one's hair into knots now that we can see both greek words essentially mean the same thing the context of the verses prove braiding hair is not a sin for two reasons the first reason is that the context shows pause saying only excessively expensive or luxurious hair styles that cost lots of money and very expensive jewelry like gold and pearls are sinful the proof of this is the fact that joseph son of jacob the patriarch of the 12 tribes of israel wore a gold necklace while in egypt so if you condemn all gold jewelry then you've got to condemn joseph for wearing a gold necklace but we know he's not condemned he's saved as he was a near perfect type of christ genesis 41 verse 42 says and pharaoh took off his ring from his hand and put it upon joseph's hand and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen and put a gold chain about his neck also in the new testament james said a man may come into the church with a gold ring james said not to show partiality to this rich man but he never said to instantly kick him out of the church because he had a gold ring on james 2 verse 2 says for if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring in goodly apparel and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment so i hope you can see from the context that wearing a gold necklace or owning a gold ring is not a sin it all depends on their cost and also the purpose for wearing them i'd like to share a real life example to illustrate what i'm talking about regarding an excessively expensive hairstyle one time a professing christian woman told me she thought it was fine for a christian woman to spend twenty thousand dollars on a hairstyle because the christian had earned the money and deserved to enjoy spending the money however she pleased i instantly disagreed and said twenty thousand dollars on one hairstyle would be a huge waste of money especially when poor saints around the world lack food clothing bibles message books shelter and more this woman's attitude which i believe is sinful is that attitude i believe paul is condemning in first timothy two verse nine and that's because paul used the word uncleanness in galatians five verse nineteen which means luxurious living so i believe paul is condemning luxurious living in first timothy two verse nine we're spending huge amounts of money on expensive hairstyles and jewelry which is really a waste of money and paul said those who live in luxury or uncleanness will not inherit the kingdom of god in galatians 5 verses 19 through 21 now the works of the flesh are manifest which are these adultery fornication uncleanness that's the word that means luxurious living lecheviousness idolatry witchcraft hatred variance emulation wrath strife seditions heresies endings murders drunkenness revelings and such like of the which i tell you before as i have also told you in time past that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of god the second reason is that the context shows paul is saying only excessively expensive or luxurious clothing is sinful and not all clothing if it's a sin to braid hair in first timothy two verse nine and first peter three verse three then it's a sin to wear gold jewelry and it's also a sin to put on apparel or clothing because first peter three verse three said or of putting on of apparel if it's a sin to put on clothing or peril everyone would be without clothing which would be immodest and sinful obviously so we can easily see the context is condemning excessively expensive clothing jewelry and hairstyles next here's a quote from brother branham about 1st timothy 2 verse 9 and you can hear him say it's not a sin for a woman to braid her hair today in the quote you'll hear him say he found history that prostitutes or flappers used to braid their hair but i've looked and i've not been able to find this historical reference in any of the commentaries that i read so that is something to continue to search for but again brother branham said it is not sin to braid hair and said christian women today should look different from prostitutes and worldly women let's listen to the quote brother branham does this first timothy 2 9 mean a woman cannot braid her hair does broad hair mean braided hair now look sister now this i'm glad that followed this i never fixed it there but it just it followed that good notice a braided hair in that day was a sign of a street woman that's what she done braided her hair and paul said to the christians now without adorning not let it be a braided or brought in braids the same thing to braid their hair because it looked like the rest of the world now you're supposed not to look like the world or act like the world see the women are supposed to be different there see no not braiding hair not today braided hair is pretty and it's a long waist in the fashion world now you see the women the way they do their hair today just keep your hair in any way just don't look like the world see don't look or dress like it if they wear shorts you wear a dress if they uh if they do their hair all cut it all off and bob it and do them every you you just let yours alone and uh the brady the question was does braden mean abroad and being braided yes that's right and now on the street i looked that up to find out years ago what the braided hair meant see the women actually the women of old they just pulled their hair back and tied it more like the ponytail today and they went around they had robes on like that but the women of the street took their hair and braided it all across their heads and wrapped it around like that and put flowers in it and things like that and that was kind of the flapper on the street just like you see the flapper today the way she dresses i'm saying flapper because you know i'm an old man so that's what this called them in my days what is they call them today i don't know chicks or something there so everyone is give them any kind of a name they like it in closing friends i hope this video was a blessing and hope it was helpful in this area of modesty and outward appearance this subject is a good example of how holy ghost-filled preachers need to rightly divide the word of truth those who misunderstand first timothy 2 verse 9 and 1st peter 3 verse 3 are essentially condemning all braided hair all wearing of gold jewelry and also condemning the putting on of all apparel it's plain to see that what paul and peter are saying is that it's more important to spend time on the inward man developing a meek and humble christian spirit both in male and female but especially in the case of our sisters who have a desire to look pretty paul specifically tells them spend your time allowing for the holy spirit to create in you a humble and meek quiet and gentle spirit if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me god bless you and may jesus christ be the desire of your heart
