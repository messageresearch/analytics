[0:00] I like to have a copy just in case I
[0:01] make a mistake or something I can go
[0:03] back and uh fix it by the grace of the
[0:10] Lord so uh ra would you raise your hand
[0:13] if you listen to the anointed ones of
[0:15] the end time is anybody uh listen to
[0:17] that sermon is that the one that you
[0:19] talked about last time you were here I
[0:21] don't know brother no I don't think I
[0:24] can't remember which one I probably
[0:25] talked about two men last time probably
[0:28] mentioned too many scriptures right to
[0:30] listen to the one you had said it was
[0:31] really good and I forget what it was
[0:33] called but it was really good about 3
[0:36] hours two 2 and a half hours or three
[0:38] hours okay was it God in hiding himself
[0:40] in
[0:42] Simplicity I would say something about
[0:44] appointed times
[0:46] or I'm not sure okay that's all right
[0:48] toer my
[0:50] phone that's all right what's the name
[0:54] EXC me what's the name of that again the
[0:56] anointed ones at the end
[0:58] times
[1:00] make of yes
[1:02] sir absolutely brother yes this is one
[1:04] you I just listened to it two or three
[1:05] times these last two weeks it's just a
[1:07] tremendous message
[1:09] tremendous um and just as a just real
[1:11] quick testimony when I first became a
[1:13] Christian I didn't know the message of
[1:14] brother brandom I was just going to a
[1:17] mega church there in akan I think they
[1:18] have Presbyterian roots and I read a
[1:21] scripture and I was like how is this
[1:23] possible and I just for two years I just
[1:25] scratched my head I don't understand
[1:26] this but then I heard about brother R's
[1:28] Ministry I went and listened to the
[1:30] anointed ones the end time and it
[1:31] dissolved all my doubts Amen in other
[1:33] words it just it just gave me complete
[1:35] understanding of this topic amen so this
[1:38] topic is tremendous it means so much to
[1:40] me because it proved to me brother
[1:42] brandham it was one of the proofs
[1:43] brother brandham was a prophet because
[1:45] the Bible said God will do nothing
[1:46] except he Reveals His secrets to his
[1:48] servants the
[1:49] prophets and also this this topic the
[1:52] anointed ones of the end time it ties
[1:54] him perfectly with the mystery of
[1:56] iniquity because the mystery of iniquity
[1:58] is the Antichrist spirit
[2:00] Paul said the the mystery of iniquity
[2:02] was already working in his day and it's
[2:04] going to go all the way up it's the
[2:06] trail of the serpent it goes all the way
[2:09] up you know uh to to the mark of the
[2:11] beast and then we know it even rides
[2:13] down into Armageddon right uh the the
[2:16] Antichrist will ride down into
[2:18] Armageddon and be defeated Hallelujah
[2:21] but uh it's a great it's a great subject
[2:23] because it's called a mystery in the
[2:25] Bible the mystery of iniquity iniquity
[2:27] means lawlessness so if is a worker of
[2:30] iniquity they don't honor God's law and
[2:33] church we're not under the law of Moses
[2:35] we're under the law of the spirit the
[2:36] Bible says but it's still a law the holy
[2:39] spirit is still a law praise God if we
[2:42] keep God's law we're blessed Hallelujah
[2:44] if we break God's law we got to repent
[2:46] Hallelujah and God will guide us into
[2:48] all truth amen now yes this was August
[2:51] 25th
[2:53] 1965 um as I Was preparing you know we
[2:57] after we got done there in Columbus I
[2:58] got to go to a little place and study a
[3:01] little bit and I was just overwhelmed
[3:02] with all the scriptures so um you know
[3:05] I'll be happy to take some questions
[3:07] afterwards as well if there's
[3:09] questions so uh the first verse that
[3:13] brother Brandon preaches and I I didn't
[3:14] get all the verses but I went like
[3:16] through the first half of this sermon
[3:18] it's a three-hour sermon and I tried to
[3:20] get uh the first verses that brother Ram
[3:23] uses uh because it kind of he calls it
[3:26] it lays the foundation it goes back to
[3:27] the Old Testament brings it all the way
[3:29] through the old test
[3:30] the first verse though was Matthew
[3:32] 24:4 and notice these are red letter
[3:35] words right Jesus Christ says uh there
[3:39] will be false christs and false
[3:42] prophets and they will show great signs
[3:44] and wonders this is interesting right
[3:46] it's an interesting thought a false
[3:49] Christ a false prophet is going to have
[3:51] signs and wonders yeah amen how can the
[3:55] devil's people have signs and wonders
[3:58] well there's two there's two ideas is
[3:59] with that right and we'll see that here
[4:02] as we go false I'll just say it now just
[4:05] to kind of uh make it plain because I'll
[4:07] be repeating it false prophets can have
[4:11] uh two types of signs and wonders they
[4:13] can have legitimate true
[4:16] Miracles but they can also have lying
[4:19] signs and wonders as well amen they can
[4:21] have both yeah and the secret to that is
[4:24] when they want to when when they want to
[4:26] do something genuine they can sacrifice
[4:28] and approach God and they can get under
[4:30] the anointing of God and then God can
[4:32] use their gifts in their life amen but
[4:36] the sad part is when they don't want to
[4:38] serve God then they'll go back into
[4:40] iniquity and they'll seek demonic
[4:43] spirits and demonic
[4:46] Powers okay and the clear example is
[4:49] balum we'll get to that in a little bit
[4:52] Hallelujah so it's it's that might be
[4:55] might be shocking but that's true that's
[4:57] what the Bible teaches that's what
[4:58] brother Ram teaches in this message
[5:00] okay so brother man he first points out
[5:03] notice they're false Christ he didn't
[5:05] say false Jesus is there's nobody
[5:08] there's very few people that come around
[5:10] and say well I'm a I'm a Jesus yeah
[5:12] because they know oh you don't have the
[5:13] scars in your hands and you know we know
[5:16] you're not a false Jesus right we know
[5:17] you're not a Jesus you don't have scars
[5:19] in your feet right there's no way you're
[5:22] back you know you're back in a physical
[5:23] body now because the Bible says you're
[5:25] in a glorified body right but it's false
[5:27] Christ which means they they're false
[5:30] prophets but they have the genuine
[5:32] anointing on them because Christ means
[5:33] the anointed one right the word Christ
[5:36] means the anointed so they're false
[5:39] anointed
[5:40] ones their soul is a false soul in other
[5:43] words their soul is The Bad Seed Jesus
[5:46] calls it right but they have the genuine
[5:49] anointing on them at times and you'll
[5:52] see what what I'm saying as brother ad
[5:54] gives beautiful simple examples from
[5:56] nature okay so just I'll try to let me
[5:58] try to get there
[6:00] there so uh these false christs are
[6:03] false prophets but yet they have the
[6:06] true anointing on them at times but not
[6:08] all the time now we are people that we
[6:10] want the true anointing on us all the
[6:12] time hallelujah amen we we we want to
[6:14] walk with the Holy Ghost anointing on us
[6:16] at all times how many want that by God's
[6:18] grace that's what I want Hallelujah I
[6:20] know I'm going to battle I know I'm
[6:21] going to sin every day you some point
[6:23] but I want to cast down that that that
[6:25] that uh battle I want to confess my sins
[6:27] I want to get right back in walking in
[6:29] the light as Christ is in the light
[6:31] praise God Amen thank you sir God bless
[6:34] you buddy love you now and notice
[6:38] they'll do great signs and wonders now
[6:40] like I said they can be either true
[6:42] genuine signs and wonders but they're
[6:44] also going to do deceiving signs and
[6:47] wonders okay now the next scripture
[6:48] brother R goes to is Matthew 5 verse 44
[6:52] so let's go to Matthew
[6:54] 544 by God's
[6:57] grace and Malachi can you read that for
[6:59] me son Matthew
[7:02] [Music]
[7:05] 5 Matthew
[7:07] 5:44 and
[7:10] 45 we can whenever you're ready buddy
[7:12] but I say unto you love your enemies
[7:14] bless them that
[7:19] Cur of
[7:26] father okay that last statement brother
[7:28] R brings it up he said notice God sends
[7:30] his reain on the just the the good and
[7:33] the unjust the bad amen right so both
[7:37] the good and the bad get God's Reign
[7:40] naturally right we I'm sure irin knows
[7:43] farmers who are sinners that don't love
[7:44] God right do they get rain from God yes
[7:47] they do but does Irving get rain does
[7:50] John get rain yes they do they're The
[7:52] Good Seed amen they're God's children
[7:55] but so do The Bad Seed they get rain as
[7:57] well and uh I'm not going to take the
[8:00] time to go there but there's many verses
[8:01] that call God's spirit rain or water
[8:04] Jesus said the Holy Ghost be like living
[8:05] water yeah amen um James 5:7 says the
[8:09] Holy Ghost will be like a latter rain a
[8:11] former and latter
[8:13] rain the Bible says the Holy Ghost is
[8:16] like rain and brings times of refreshing
[8:18] from the presence of the Lord remember
[8:20] when we had that drought a couple months
[8:22] ago in June or was it May and June it
[8:24] didn't rain for 28 days boy when it when
[8:26] it started raining John we walked out on
[8:28] our deck and I said this is so
[8:29] refreshing but then it became too hard
[8:30] and I had to go back in the house but
[8:33] when it first started rain it was such a
[8:34] refreshing praise God I was like oh I
[8:36] haven't felt this for a month praise God
[8:38] well that's what God said his spirit is
[8:40] like when we're singing How Great Thou
[8:41] Art I just started crying and raising my
[8:43] hands I got refreshed amen amen that's
[8:45] God's spirit amen it's refreshing us
[8:48] praise God it's making it feel new again
[8:49] it's making it feel making us feel in
[8:52] love with God hallelujah we might have
[8:53] battled all day we might have been
[8:54] working hard all day sweating out all
[8:56] day chasing the kids around all day
[8:58] praise God uh and it just been a busy
[9:00] day Hallelujah but when God's presence
[9:02] come it makes you feel fresh again
[9:04] hallelujah amen brings your joy back
[9:06] amen brings that smile back to your face
[9:08] amen makes you uh Cry tears of joy it
[9:10] refreshes because God Likens it unto
[9:13] rain praise God amen amen and brother
[9:15] Ram says notice the rain the Holy Ghost
[9:17] falls on true teachers and he says false
[9:20] teachers on true prophets and false
[9:23] prophets that's what brother Ram uses
[9:26] now next verse he uses is Hebrews
[9:28] chapter 6 go to verse four please
[9:31] Hebrews 6
[9:35] verse4 and just listening the sermon
[9:37] again like I said prove to me William
[9:39] brandham was a genuine prophet of God
[9:42] because like the Bible said I've never
[9:43] heard a man talk like this I was raised
[9:46] in church I heard all kinds of
[9:48] Pentecostal preachers go through our
[9:49] church we had Revival sometimes we had
[9:51] Revival services from Sunday to Sunday
[9:53] people would speak in tongu shout and
[9:55] prophesy which was great but I never
[9:58] heard a man preach like brother Bram
[9:59] Hallelujah who opened the word of God
[10:01] and then of course brother Bram had
[10:02] greater miracles than I saw you know uh
[10:06] and so it just proved to me never a man
[10:09] talk like this man that's what they said
[10:10] about Jesus right and brother R was
[10:12] anointed with the spirit of Jesus so are
[10:14] you so so am I praise God
[10:17] hallelujah uh Hebrews 6:4 now here's the
[10:20] illustration I kind of already used it
[10:22] you know with our farmer Brethren here
[10:24] verse four says for it's impossible for
[10:26] those who are once enlightened and have
[10:28] tasted of the Heavenly gift and were
[10:30] made partakers of the Holy Ghost and
[10:33] have tasted the good word of God and the
[10:34] powers of the world to come if they
[10:36] shall fall away to renew them again
[10:38] under repentance seeing They Crucified
[10:40] to themselves as Son of God aresh and
[10:42] put him to an open Shain that's quite a
[10:45] scripture but this is speaking of people
[10:47] like judas's scariot yeah and we won't
[10:49] have time to get there but in Matthew
[10:51] chapter 10 Judas is sent out with all
[10:53] the preachers and he's given power to
[10:55] cast out Devils raise the dead heal the
[10:57] sick I mean and the Bible ible said they
[10:59] all come back 12 come back and 70 come
[11:02] back to Jesus saying wow we the devils
[11:04] are subject to us we have power over
[11:06] demons and Jesus said don't Rejoice that
[11:08] you have power over demons but Rejoice
[11:11] that your names are in heaven Hall thank
[11:13] God hallelujah thank God that's what we
[11:15] should Rejoice over and Judas was one of
[11:17] those he was right there just rejoicing
[11:19] oh wow we can do Miracles we can cast
[11:21] out Devils but Jesus says be careful
[11:24] Rejoice because you're saved amen amen
[11:27] Rejoice because God loves you Hallelujah
[11:29] and you love God amen amen amen and even
[11:33] you Mal I we talking about this and even
[11:35] on the night uh Judas betrayed Jesus
[11:39] Jesus said one of you is going to betray
[11:40] me and not everybody turned to look at
[11:42] Judas and said I knew it was you the
[11:44] whole time the Bible said they looked at
[11:46] themselves yeah amen there was nothing
[11:49] about really Judas that separated him
[11:50] from the others they all they all fell
[11:52] short of God's glory didn't they amen
[11:54] just like all of us but the Bible tells
[11:56] us in another chapter I believe it's
[11:58] John 12 you don't have to read it but
[12:00] but Judas had a thief's heart and he
[12:03] didn't really care about the
[12:04] poor so see how people can come to
[12:07] church where they can hide things in
[12:08] their lives yeah you would have thought
[12:10] wow he's The Treasure of the church he's
[12:12] done Miracles he's one of Jesus's Inner
[12:14] Circle yet he was hiding his thief's
[12:16] heart the whole time now Church think
[12:19] think how easy this would have been
[12:20] brother John all he had to do is go up
[12:21] to Jesus and say Jesus can you pray for
[12:23] me for my my my sinful thieving heart
[12:25] that's all he had to do he just had to
[12:26] go to his Pastor I mean that's that's
[12:28] all he had to do but he wouldn't do it
[12:30] but see you and I we do that praise God
[12:32] Amen we go to Jesus in prayer and say
[12:34] God take this ly out of my heart or take
[12:36] this lust out of my heart take this
[12:38] greed take this anger take this
[12:39] bitterness out of my heart what does God
[12:41] do he forgives you he takes it out of
[12:43] your heart praise God hallelujah that's
[12:45] why we know we're not judases amen
[12:48] because we confess our sins Hallelujah
[12:50] and we overcome the wicked one praise
[12:52] God but Judas just let that stay in him
[12:55] the whole time yet he tasted of the
[12:57] powers of God
[13:00] now verse 7 now here's the
[13:02] illustration again like our farmer
[13:04] Brethren know all about for the Earth
[13:06] which drinketh in the rain that cometh
[13:07] of upon it and bringeth forth herbs meat
[13:09] for them by whom it is dressed receiveth
[13:12] blessing from God but that which bear of
[13:15] thorns and Briars is rejected is nigh
[13:17] unto cursing whose end is to be burned
[13:20] okay so he gives us the illustration you
[13:23] have herbs like uh what are some herb
[13:26] names like uh clangula is that an herb
[13:29] something like my wife could list off
[13:31] about 300 of them but I can I can't even
[13:33] LIF off list off one of them basil basil
[13:36] there you go so the the rain falls on
[13:39] the basil but also falls on all those
[13:41] awful Thorns that got out there right
[13:45] and that's what that's what the
[13:47] illustration we get from nature right
[13:49] God's spirit falls on Believers but also
[13:52] falls on make Believers amen like Judas
[13:55] he was a make believer he tried to
[13:56] believe for a while but then he sold it
[13:57] out amen
[13:59] okay so so the same thing is true in the
[14:01] spiritual the Holy Ghost will fall on
[14:04] genuine Holy Ghost filled Saints but it
[14:06] also falls on mate Believers yeah
[14:09] Hallelujah brother man says how he said
[14:11] what's the way to know he said the same
[14:13] way it's always been the same way to
[14:14] know who stays with the word of God Amen
[14:18] who passes the word test Hallelujah who
[14:20] believes the word who loves the word who
[14:22] will obey the word who will repent and
[14:23] obey the word of God hallelujah amen
[14:25] it's always the word test brother amen
[14:28] it's always the word text
[14:31] Hallelujah now the next verse brother B
[14:33] goes oh next he tells two
[14:37] stories uh the first one when he first
[14:39] became in contact with the Pentecostal
[14:41] people he went up to Michigan in
[14:43] Mishawaka and he saw two men one would
[14:46] speak in an unknown tongue and then the
[14:48] next one would prophesy and it' be
[14:49] exactly right I'm sorry interpret and it
[14:52] would tell secrets of people's hearts
[14:54] and brother Ram said this is like heaven
[14:57] right he said I he said I'm in amongst
[14:59] I'm amongst Angels but then he saw a
[15:02] vision of that second man with
[15:03] interpretation and he saw he was married
[15:06] I'm sorry he was living with a
[15:07] blackheaded woman but he was married to
[15:09] a blond-headed woman and then brother
[15:10] Ram said am I amongst
[15:13] Devils right so he said he went up to
[15:16] the first man he said he would and he
[15:18] discerned his Spirit he said that's a
[15:20] real servant of God and then he went up
[15:22] to the other man and he said he said
[15:23] brother I see you're living with a
[15:25] second wife you shouldn't do that and
[15:27] the man look what he did instead of
[15:28] repenting and saying brother R will you
[15:30] pray for me that I'll go back to my wife
[15:31] or how maybe stay away from his wife I'm
[15:33] not sure how he'd handle that but the
[15:35] point is instead of repenting the
[15:37] brother R said he just walked out of the
[15:38] meeting and left that's right he
[15:40] wouldn't repent he wouldn't pass the
[15:42] word test praise God Amen brother R said
[15:44] that's that's a thorn that man was a
[15:46] thorn the other man was a genuine herb
[15:48] praise God basil amen hallelujah let's
[15:52] be basil today praise God
[15:55] hallelujah I like mint though that's
[15:57] that's right that's my wife get some
[15:59] mint boy smells good I like walking by
[16:00] that part of the the garden there
[16:02] Hallelujah the Bible says our worship is
[16:03] like a sweet smelling savior to God when
[16:06] we pray when we sing God says he go
[16:09] that's a wonderful worship I like
[16:12] that that's my mint down there that's my
[16:14] basil that's my wheat down there
[16:15] Hallelujah and then he tells another
[16:17] story he had questions even about this
[16:19] afterwards so he went to his cave where
[16:22] he went to pray it was in Green's Mill
[16:24] he says and uh he says then he a vision
[16:28] broke out and he saw a man dressed in
[16:30] all white sewing seeds in his
[16:32] field but right behind him came a man in
[16:35] Black and he was sewing his
[16:38] seeds and brother Ram says he said then
[16:41] they started growing up and brother Ram
[16:43] said uh then the clouds came by and it
[16:46] started raining and the good seed of the
[16:48] man in white shouted praise the Lord for
[16:50] the rain praise the Lord for the rain
[16:52] and then brother ra said the bad seeds
[16:54] from the man in Black started getting
[16:57] the rain they said praise the Lord for
[16:58] the the rain praise the Lord for the
[16:59] rain praise God and brother bam said see
[17:02] and this is a Bible reference this is
[17:04] the story of the parable of the swer
[17:07] yeah Jesus was the man in white sewing
[17:09] good seed Satan come around and sowed
[17:11] the tears but both Lov the presence of
[17:15] God yeah come on brother both rejoy the
[17:18] both enjoyed the blessings of God praise
[17:20] God you don't think those Sinners and
[17:22] those false prophets and those mega
[17:24] churches you don't think they like to
[17:25] get healed too you don't think they like
[17:27] to shout and cry worship they like it
[17:30] too but what's different is their seed
[17:33] their seed is different because their
[17:35] seed produces the wrong fruits it
[17:37] produces lying adultery right it
[17:40] produces cheating but our seed produces
[17:43] Holiness amen obedience patience
[17:45] longsuffering meekness godliness
[17:48] goodness and love hallelujah amen that's
[17:51] what it produces in our lives amen so we
[17:54] can both shout praise the Lord tonight
[17:55] hallelujah amen as as we feel the spirit
[17:58] of God refresh us we can both shout
[18:00] hallelujah praise the Lord amen
[18:02] beautiful M Matthew 13 3-23 we're not
[18:06] going to read it but if you're writing
[18:07] it down plus I got the audio recording
[18:09] going it's been 18 minutes so far so
[18:11] we're making good time by God's
[18:13] grace and again church when I heard
[18:16] brother preach this it just tied the
[18:17] whole Bible together never had did a man
[18:20] ever preached like this before
[18:23] hallelujah amen it it was so beautiful
[18:26] so tremendous brother Bram said I'm
[18:29] quoting brother Bram he said quote the
[18:31] same holy spirit that anoints the church
[18:33] that gives them desire to save Souls
[18:36] that gives them power to perform
[18:37] Miracles it falls on the unjust the same
[18:40] as the just the very same spirit amen
[18:43] end quote The Same
[18:45] Spirit I was raised in Domination so
[18:47] when I come to the message I felt the
[18:49] presence of God before and it was
[18:51] familiar but what was different was the
[18:54] what we did after the anointing we
[18:56] started I started Living the word praise
[18:58] God
[18:59] that was different praise God cuz in
[19:01] when I was raised Pentecostal we go home
[19:03] we'd watch bad movies watch Dirty TV
[19:05] shows you know we some of the people
[19:08] would drink alcohol and get semi- drunk
[19:10] or
[19:11] whatever but they got the same anointing
[19:14] see but when we come to Christ when we
[19:16] come to the full word of God it produces
[19:18] different fruits hallelujah it's not
[19:20] corrupt fruits but Incorruptible fruits
[19:23] Hallelujah that's what the word of God
[19:25] produces in our lives amen hallelujah
[19:28] now go to Matthew 7:21 this and this was
[19:31] the verse I sat I still remember to this
[19:33] day I was sitting in
[19:35] my college dorm room as a freshman in
[19:39] akan and I was scratching my head what
[19:42] does this
[19:43] mean my roommate was out partying he'd
[19:45] bring in girls in the night time and I'd
[19:47] be like oh Micah don't bring in these
[19:48] girls he bring them in anyway I slept on
[19:51] the top bunk he and his girlfriend were
[19:53] sometimes sleep in the bottom bun I
[19:54] remember numerous times I'd read through
[19:56] this and they'd come in and I'd be
[19:57] sitting there right right there reading
[19:58] my Bible and I'd highlight this and what
[20:00] does this mean what does Matthew 7:21-23
[20:04] mean again red letter words Matthew
[20:08] 7:21 brother bam quotes this not
[20:11] everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord
[20:13] shall enter in the Kingdom of Heaven but
[20:15] he that doeth the will of My Father
[20:16] which is in heaven amen amen so it's not
[20:19] just enough to say Lord Lord you got to
[20:21] say that and you then you got to do what
[20:23] God says hallelujah amen you have to do
[20:26] the will of God and what's the will of
[20:27] God the word of God praise God yes amen
[20:30] amen verse 20 no I'm sorry 22 now look
[20:34] at this many not a few Church look this
[20:36] is amazing to me many people at the
[20:39] white Throne judgment many will say to
[20:41] Jesus in that day Lord Lord have we not
[20:43] prophesied in thy name and in thy name
[20:45] have cast out devils and in thy name
[20:47] done many wonderful
[20:48] works so prophecy cast out devils and
[20:53] wonderful works there's at least three
[20:55] types of Ministries there right and many
[20:57] wonderful works
[20:59] then will I profess unto them I never
[21:01] knew you depart from me ye that work
[21:03] iniquity remember iniquity is
[21:06] lawlessness now Jesus never said no you
[21:09] didn't cast out Devils no you didn't
[21:11] prophesy he just said I never knew you
[21:13] yeah so that means this is a group of
[21:15] people just like Judas a scariot that
[21:18] they would they would they would
[21:19] sacrifice they would pray at times they
[21:21] would worship God God's spirit would
[21:23] fall they would prophesy they would cast
[21:25] out Devils do many wonderful works but
[21:27] then after the service they go get some
[21:30] cocaine which preachers have done like
[21:32] Benny Hinn they got videos of it online
[21:35] you can see
[21:36] it and he's the one asking h i the Lord
[21:40] tells me there's seven people out there
[21:41] that got to give me $110,000 tonight
[21:44] where do you find that where do you see
[21:45] Jesus doing that amen but yet when he
[21:47] walks out he comes out under singing and
[21:49] praying and the anoint you can feel a
[21:52] strong anointing there and maybe
[21:53] somebody gets healed I don't know i'
[21:55] I've never seen if anybody got healed or
[21:56] not in his meetings
[21:59] but the point is Jesus says he never
[22:01] argues with him and says no you didn't
[22:03] so he's he's acknowledging you did
[22:05] Miracles but then after the service
[22:08] what' you do then yeah come on Amen
[22:10] right they went and lived a lawless life
[22:12] like I don't have to obey those Holy
[22:14] Spirit God God blesses me when I'm there
[22:17] I struggle like everybody else but
[22:19] that's not what that's not that's not
[22:20] that's not the right approach no we
[22:22] don't the Bible said should we uh should
[22:24] we live longer in sin that Grace May
[22:26] abound God forbid God Amen we should die
[22:29] to our sins amen but see they use the
[22:33] gospel they get the anointing and
[22:34] usually it's a money-making scheme like
[22:36] BM yeah and then after service what do
[22:39] they do they take that money they buy a
[22:41] Rolls-Royce or they buy a mansion or a
[22:44] private
[22:45] jet right and they live lives of
[22:49] iniquity okay so this is the verse I'm
[22:51] sitting there I can still I can still
[22:53] see my little cubicle in my dorm room
[22:55] and I was just highlight like what does
[22:56] that mean I was reading NIV Bible too
[22:57] you know
[22:58] missing scriptures and everything and
[23:00] then months later I heard brother
[23:02] brandom I'm like oh now it makes sense
[23:05] oh praise God hallelujah thank God that
[23:08] we can do the will of God hallelujah
[23:11] that's what see that's what's important
[23:12] it's crying out Lord Lord but it's also
[23:14] doing what God says to do praise God
[23:17] Amen and not living a life of
[23:18] lawlessness but living a life of
[23:20] obedience to the law of the holy spirit
[23:22] amen amen does that help by God's grace
[23:25] do this does this help tonight amen amen
[23:27] okay praise God I you know as I've been
[23:29] praying and preaching all summer I'm I'm
[23:30] in my heart I'm saying God what would be
[23:32] most beneficial for this young group of
[23:34] of Christians here and I know for me
[23:36] this was crucial in my walk with God so
[23:38] I want to make sure I give it to you by
[23:39] God's grace if I had more time I
[23:41] wouldn't have printed out papers but I I

[23:58] to give you print outs but I'm sorry I
[23:59] don't have one okay next brother bam

[24:07] anything does anybody do that here

[24:11] workers here seen it already but I don't
[24:14] have experience right I don't either
[24:16] Mali have you seen any is there grafting
[24:17] at the orchard where you work okay
[24:19] there's a little bit of grafting okay
[24:21] well brother said he had a friend out in
[24:22] Arizona who had a citrus farm and he had
[24:25] orange trees but he walked by the orange
[24:27] Tre he said I saw lemons on them and
[24:30] tangerines and tangelos and then oranges
[24:33] too and brother br's like what is that
[24:34] all about he's like if you trim off one
[24:37] of the branches of the orange and you
[24:39] Graft in a lemon tree branch that Branch
[24:42] will produce lemons although it's
[24:44] connected to the life of a orange
[24:46] tree oh my praise God and brother said
[24:50] will that tree ever put forth oranges
[24:52] again he said yes when it puts forth an
[24:54] original Branch from the original tree
[24:56] praise God amen and brother said look
[24:59] this tree has a a lemon branch and it's
[25:02] producing lemons yet it's connected to
[25:04] the the life of an orange and brother BR
[25:06] said that's like a Methodist a Methodist
[25:08] is connected to life of Jesus but they
[25:09] produce produce Methodist
[25:12] fruit right he says but he said a
[25:15] Methodist will always produ a method a
[25:17] Methodist but a true branch of Jesus if
[25:19] Jesus is the vine we're the branches if
[25:21] we're a real Branch from Jesus we'll
[25:23] produce Jesus fruit praise God
[25:25] hallelujah we'll produce Christ
[25:26] Hallelujah we won't produce method we
[25:29] won't produce Amish amen we won't
[25:31] produce Pentecostal like I was Raising
[25:33] we'll produce Christ hallelujah amen
[25:37] amen I love these stories look I love
[25:39] brother the Simplicity God gave to
[25:40] brother Ram like a child could
[25:42] understand that I'm sure they do right
[25:44] because they get raised in the message
[25:46] Hallelujah
[25:49] see oranges will come only from a new
[25:52] Branch from the original tree so we must
[25:55] be original branches and we are brother
[25:57] R preach this a sermon about the bride
[25:59] tree praise God hallelujah and we're
[26:01] we're we're an original I'm sorry we're
[26:02] a branch from the original tree so we'll
[26:04] have the same signs same Doctrine same
[26:06] wonders same Miracles Same Love same
[26:09] emotion same everything as the early
[26:10] church praise God Amen like I was
[26:13] telling uh I was telling our our church
[26:15] a few weeks ago if we go back 10 years
[26:17] I've seen all the nine gifts of the holy
[26:19] spirit operate in our little church amen
[26:21] right because we're the original we're
[26:23] part of the original word of God Amen
[26:25] I've seen all nine of them I've seen all
[26:27] nine of them and plus uh now the
[26:29] preachers we don't see a lot of Apostles
[26:30] anymore Cu uh it's it's a hard job it's
[26:33] a hard job I mean which who do we know
[26:35] that goes to places where there's no
[26:36] churches and starts a brand new church
[26:38] that's a hard thing to do but we've had
[26:41] a couple Apostles over the last 10 years
[26:42] maybe two but we've had all the other
[26:45] gifts you know preaching the preaching
[26:46] gifts see we want to have all that God
[26:48] has for us praise God Amen Hallelujah
[26:51] now we can't we can't make God do
[26:53] Miracles so we got to wait till it's
[26:54] God's time to use those gifts of the
[26:56] holy spirit amen
[26:58] like I said here before maybe I told you
[26:59] before it really helped somebody one
[27:01] time I said God is not like a uh you
[27:04] know airpods or God's not like a a like
[27:06] something in my pocket like I can well
[27:08] when I want to speak in tonu I'll just
[27:09] take it out and I'll just speak in tonu
[27:11] whenever I want that's not how God works
[27:13] you and I don't keep God in our pocket
[27:15] no I'll say like this God dwells in our
[27:17] Souls praise God Amen but when God wants
[27:19] to move it's at God's Direction not my
[27:21] direction praise God I can ask God to
[27:23] move but it's all up to God if he moves
[27:25] or not praise God Hallelujah but that's
[27:28] what the Pentecost that's where they
[27:29] made their mistake I was raised that
[27:30] church they'd say okay take out your
[27:32] tongues in other take out your tongues
[27:34] and let's all speak in tongues well you
[27:35] can't do
[27:36] that that's not you don't find that in
[27:38] the Bible the Bible says if they do that
[27:40] they're barbarians yeah yeah right amen
[27:44] Paul said if you can't give an
[27:46] interpretation keep silent in the church
[27:49] well we need some Paws to step into
[27:50] those churches don't we Hallelujah some
[27:53] brother Brams that come down their
[27:54] denominations and stir them up praise
[27:56] God m
[27:58] now brother R gets back to the scripture
[28:00] I'm not going to read these but in John
[28:01] 15:5 Jesus said I am the vine ye are the
[28:04] branches so he's the original tree we
[28:07] got to be a branch off the original tree
[28:09] and Jesus said in John 14:12 The Works
[28:11] that I do shall ye do also amen and we
[28:14] can do the same works of Jesus when
[28:16] we're attached to the same tree the same
[28:18] life hallelujah amen right it's just his
[28:21] love flowing through us like I told you
[28:23] last time that brother had the migraine
[28:25] and we just had an anointed service
[28:26] about a month ago I said come up for
[28:28] prayer then the service we prayed over
[28:30] him and while we're praying he said the
[28:32] migraine totally left him amen and I you
[28:34] know I I don't we don't plan those
[28:36] things out he's had other migraines
[28:37] before we prayed it didn't happen but it
[28:40] happens when God wants it to happen
[28:41] praise God Amen you see we just got to
[28:44] we just got to be connected to the vine
[28:46] see we do the works of God hallelujah as
[28:48] God leads us to
[28:50] work and church don't feel bad if you
[28:52] don't have the gift of healing the Bible
[28:54] said not everybody has the gift of
[28:56] healing not everybody's an
[28:58] apostle thank God because if if if that
[29:00] was the case if we're all Apostles we
[29:02] never see one another thank God we have
[29:04] pastors you know that stay around and
[29:06] just stay with the people if not we'd be
[29:09] oh see you John see you Irvin see you
[29:12] brother Aaron we we just be traveling
[29:14] all around and we'd have no stability in
[29:15] our lives amen thank God there's
[29:17] differences of body parts too the nine
[29:19] gifts of the holy spirit then brother R
[29:22] goes to Genesis 4 we're not going to
[29:23] turn there but he said now look here's
[29:25] two men that are worshippers there he
[29:26] starts calling them
[29:28] twins just like just like the wheat and
[29:30] The Tear are
[29:32] twins right the two seeds they sow the
[29:34] white the man and white the man the man
[29:36] in Black they look very similar and he
[29:38] shows us the first twins here Cain and
[29:41] Abel brother said they both worship God
[29:44] Amen but one worshiped God the right way
[29:46] while the other worshiped God his own
[29:48] way yesen and God only accepted the one
[29:50] who worshiped according to the word of
[29:53] God that was able praise God and that's
[29:56] why God will accept you brother Urban
[29:58] and and Wilma that's why God will accept
[29:59] these people all these people here
[30:01] because we're worshiping according to
[30:03] God's word and not our feelings praise
[30:05] God Amen we bring our feelings into
[30:08] obedience to the word of God we deny our
[30:10] feelings and we take God's word if
[30:12] there's if there's a contrast or if
[30:14] there's a difference we take God's word
[30:16] hallelujah
[30:18] amen thank you Jesus so brother starts
[30:21] showing how now look the anointing fell
[30:23] on the anointing fell on Cain I need to
[30:25] worship and God even said you know what
[30:27] to do if you just did what I told you to
[30:30] do you'd rule over your brother but he
[30:34] turned down that he turned it down but
[30:36] he look he was anointed to come and
[30:38] worship they worshiped at the same
[30:40] church they worshiped at the same altar
[30:43] praise
[30:44] God but one took the anointing of God
[30:47] the other one took his own
[30:49] anointing see both were trying to
[30:51] contact
[30:52] God okay next then brother Ram goes to
[30:55] one of the main characters that's B
[30:57] if you haven't read about balum you got
[30:59] to read about balum in your free time
[31:01] cuz I I have to preach a whole Sermon
[31:03] Just on BM because it's such a rich and
[31:06] deep and uh important story brother Ram
[31:10] says now another set of twins is Moses
[31:13] and
[31:14] balum he said both had Miracles both had
[31:17] Supernatural gifts yeah but he says what
[31:20] was the difference between Moses and
[31:22] balam he said Moses's teaching was
[31:25] perfect there's a lot preachers they
[31:27] that don't like teaching they say oh we
[31:29] need more miracles and we Jesus isn't a
[31:32] Doctrine I know Jesus isn't a Doctrine
[31:34] but if Jesus ever tells us to do
[31:35] something it's a Doctrine praise God
[31:38] like if you ever spend time talking to
[31:39] Jesus he's going to tell you to do
[31:41] something that's a Doctrine because a
[31:42] Doctrine means instruction praise
[31:44] God
[31:46] hallelujah said Moses teaching was
[31:48] perfect but balam's teaching was
[31:51] sinful balum taught the people were all
[31:54] the same moabites and Jews were all the
[31:56] same that's like people to they saying
[31:58] oh you're the same as Catholics brother
[32:00] said we are not the same yeah amen oh
[32:03] you're the same as Baptists no we're not
[32:05] no we're not praise God we are totally
[32:07] different praise God because we're
[32:09] following the full word of God and we're
[32:11] not ashamed of the word of God
[32:13] hallelujah
[32:15] amen now in Numbers 22 we're not going
[32:17] to go over but um Balo is a king moit
[32:21] king and he asked balam to curse Israel
[32:25] and so what does balum do he says well
[32:26] let me go talk to God and God said don't
[32:28] go with Bayo and you can't curse Israel
[32:31] so bam comes back he says okay I can't
[32:33] do it and Bayo says go back and ask
[32:36] again now you would think you wouldn't
[32:38] have to ask God a second time about
[32:41] something but to show to show the the
[32:44] lustful desire of balum for money balum
[32:48] goes back to God and God said go now did
[32:51] God change his mind no God let balam
[32:55] have his permissive
[32:57] will okay that's very
[33:00] important so if somebody like like and
[33:02] the example I love what brother R gives
[33:04] he gives the example of a woman preacher
[33:06] a woman preacher will say well brother
[33:08] God told me to preach and brother said I
[33:09] don't doubt that one bit but that wasn't
[33:12] the first thing God told you the first
[33:15] thing God told you what it's it's wrong
[33:17] for a woman to take authority over men
[33:19] praise God because that's God's original
[33:21] word
[33:23] hallelujah
[33:25] amen and I'm just going to say this too
[33:28] with the tape Church movement Joseph
[33:30] brandom said the Lord told him that he's
[33:32] in God's will for playing tapes he said
[33:35] thus sayith the Lord I told Joseph I
[33:36] said I don't doubt that I told him an
[33:38] email I said I don't doubt that but that
[33:40] wasn't God's first word amen amen
[33:43] because God can't change Ephesians 4:11
[33:45] praise God God can't change his his
[33:47] original method for people to hear the
[33:50] word of God it's living preachers
[33:51] preaching God's living word praise God
[33:54] amen amen I don't doubt that one bit but
[33:56] it wasn't God God's original will amen
[34:00] the Bible said how blessed are the feet
[34:01] of them who bring Gospel of good news
[34:03] where's brother R's feet today if you
[34:05] play a tape brother man's feet aren't
[34:07] here he's already gone on to his reward
[34:09] let him have his reward he can't be our
[34:11] pastor now he can still be our Prophet
[34:13] as far as he points us to the word of
[34:15] God through the tapes but he can't have
[34:16] a living Ministry now he's already
[34:18] living in another realm praise God Amen
[34:20] but we're living here and so living men
[34:23] with living feet must preach God's word
[34:25] and the Bible said how blessed are the
[34:27] feet of them who bring the gospel of
[34:28] good peace amen they asked brother brand
[34:31] should preachers keep preaching now or
[34:33] should we change our evangelism he said
[34:34] no keep preaching he said I'm right
[34:36] behind you praise God Amen so I know if
[34:39] brother was here he'd be right behind me
[34:40] saying Amen brother Amen brother keep
[34:43] preaching anoint the on in the end time
[34:44] keep preaching baptism in the name of
[34:46] the Lord Jesus Christ he'd be right
[34:48] behind the preachers hallelujah amen
[34:50] amen that's why I asked him I said
[34:52] Brother Joseph when are you going to say
[34:52] what brother ramam said you always say
[34:55] say what the tape say I said when are
[34:56] you going to say when you going to say
[34:57] that yeah when are you going to say what
[35:00] that tape says praise God I say it with
[35:02] love church I say it with
[35:05] love but see balam he went back to God
[35:08] for god's second opinion God don't have
[35:10] a second opinion no no but God will give
[35:13] you your heart's desire if it's the
[35:14] wrong
[35:17] desire now it's amazing in Numbers
[35:20] Chapter
[35:22] 23 uh balam of course earlier was warned
[35:25] by a talking dony
[35:28] the donkey warned him don't go but he
[35:30] still went
[35:32] yeah and then when he gets there church
[35:35] he makes sacrifice now here's a great
[35:37] lesson it's in numbers 23 veres 1 to 4
[35:40] why don't we turn there because I want
[35:41] to read one verse out of
[35:43] there this moabit King Bao he
[35:48] wants he wants balum to change his mind
[35:51] and curse
[35:54] Israel and notice how does baam get God
[35:57] to come down and talk to him he makes
[35:59] seven altars
[36:01] yeah and he sacrifices uh seven
[36:05] oxen and seven Rams that is a huge
[36:11] sacrifice now look at this he's a bad
[36:14] seed he's going he's going to go to hell
[36:15] eventually you know the Bible says that
[36:17] in second Peter chapter 2 but he knows
[36:19] he's going to go to hell but he knows
[36:20] how to contact God how do he contact God
[36:22] sacrifice yeah shutting in with God in
[36:25] the secret place right shut in with God
[36:27] in the secret place we sing that song
[36:30] how do you how do you contact God you
[36:31] got to isolate yourself you got to seek
[36:33] God the Bible said draw night to God
[36:36] he'll draw night to you praise God Amen
[36:40] now if you notice though balam mixes
[36:42] Heathen worship with Jewish worship
[36:45] because the heathens would build
[36:46] multiple altars God said there's only
[36:48] one altar
[36:50] yeah so see he mixes his Heathen
[36:53] religion well I'll do seven altars
[36:55] that's not what God wanted God wanted
[36:56] one
[36:58] alter and then look he he incorporates
[37:01] well I'm going to get clean animals
[37:04] right and then what's amazing he gives
[37:07] the most Exquisite or the most uh
[37:10] valuable offering it's burn
[37:12] offerings all all the other offerings
[37:14] you would keep a piece and you would eat
[37:16] it and the people got to be blessed but
[37:18] not with the burnt offering with the
[37:20] burnt offering everything burned you got
[37:22] nothing God got everything and that was
[37:24] the most valuable sacrifice you could
[37:26] possibly give so bam says I if I want to
[37:30] contact God I've got to make some great
[37:33] sacrifices if I want to hear the voice
[37:35] of God I've really got a sacrifice and
[37:37] so he does and the Bible said God comes
[37:41] down now let's read verse one because
[37:43] that's an important verse you want to
[37:46] read that brother John numbers
[37:47] 231 whenever you get it
[37:51] brother and Bam said unto ba build me
[37:55] here seven altars and deare me here
[37:58] seven ox and seven Rams all right so he
[38:01] goes through this
[38:04] motions and God tells him he still can't
[38:07] curse
[38:08] Israel
[38:10] hallelujah it's a beautiful portion God
[38:12] tell and uh the Bible said that he
[38:14] actually goes into a vision and he sees
[38:17] how blessed Israel is and love what
[38:20] brother Ram said brother Braham said Bao
[38:22] and balam were like these guys can play
[38:24] in the wilderness Israel
[38:27] uh they're not very faithful to God look
[38:29] at all their sins look at all they're
[38:31] complaining and they they just saw
[38:33] Israel based upon their natural things
[38:35] but brother raham said but God looked
[38:38] down from heaven and God saw uh the
[38:41] Brazen serpent other words God saw them
[38:44] forgiven God saw the pillar of fire god
[38:46] was in the pillar of fire hallelujah
[38:48] amen but see they they just bam just
[38:51] looked at all their mistakes it just
[38:53] shows God's not looking at your mistakes
[38:55] God's looking at your sacrifice praise
[38:57] God Amen Hallelujah and also God's
[39:00] presence will never leave you he'll
[39:01] never leave you he'll never forsake you
[39:03] praise God you're God's child he can't
[39:06] curse his own children praise God that's
[39:08] what we learned from the story of balum
[39:11] balum and Bao triy to get God to curse
[39:13] his children he said I can't curse my
[39:14] children I I can't do
[39:16] that now the one I wanted to read was uh
[39:19] chapter 24:1 sister Miram could you read
[39:21] chapter 24 verse one that's the one
[39:24] that's really important for us here
[39:25] tonight and when bam saw that it pleased
[39:28] the lord to bless Israel he went not as
[39:31] at other times to seek for enchantments
[39:33] but he said his face toward the
[39:35] Wilderness unbelievable scripture right
[39:38] there
[39:41] unbelievable bam saw wow if I If I
[39:43] sacrifice these animals God will come
[39:45] down and so he kept doing that right but
[39:48] before what did he do brother John when
[39:49] he went if he couldn't hear from God
[39:51] what would he do he' go to the demon The
[39:52] Witches he' go to the witches he would
[39:55] seek enchantments how how can I get a
[39:57] curse on this person what
[40:01] what and yet God would talk right to him
[40:04] yes why because he had the gift of a
[40:06] prophet yeah the Bible calls him a
[40:09] prophet yeah amen so if God gives you
[40:11] that gift God's going to work with you
[40:13] in that way so don't feel bad if you've
[40:15] never seen a vision or you never
[40:16] prophesied don't worry about it you
[40:18] ought to be happy praise God hallelujah
[40:20] brother brother say that carries a lot
[40:22] of responsibility look what it did with
[40:23] bam yeah come on brother so think about
[40:26] that here's a man no wonder he went to
[40:28] hell most of the time brother uran he'd
[40:30] go out and he talked to witches can you
[40:31] get me an enchantment can you do this
[40:33] and this and we'll conjure up this we'll
[40:34] conjure up these spirits but then he
[40:36] learned well I can contact God through
[40:37] through sacrifice here's the way I can
[40:39] talk to the almighty God but yet he was
[40:41] also talking to Demons at times that is
[40:44] balam is one of these people like
[40:46] Matthew chapter 7 Lord Lord did I not
[40:48] prophesy he did prophesy on he
[40:51] prophesied of the star of Jacob that
[40:53] would rise balam prophesied of the star
[40:56] that would lead the wise men to baby
[40:59] Jesus right and this was uh 1500 years
[41:03] before Jesus was born and he was right
[41:06] brother Ram said true prophecy false
[41:09] teaching from
[41:10] balam his prophecy was right his gift
[41:13] was right but his teaching was wrong
[41:16] what did his teaching do he said let's
[41:18] let's invite Israel to Moab let's have a
[41:21] uh let's have a a unified meeting
[41:23] brother liking to under Constantine
[41:25] uniting with the
[41:28] church right amen around 325 the Council
[41:32] of NAA that's what brother said that was
[41:34] the modern version of ba uh B PR yeah
[41:38] and what did balum say bam got up to the
[41:40] pulpit he says well I prophesied of
[41:41] Israel he said but all you Israelites
[41:43] were all the same you can have
[41:45] fornication you you men can sleep with
[41:47] these moabit women and they went out and
[41:49] did it and God killed 24,000 of them wow
[41:53] but yet when he prophesied it was thus
[41:55] sayith the Lord it was perfect perfectly
[41:56] right yeah but then he tried to get in a
[41:58] different office and teach them about
[42:00] sexual relations and family and because
[42:02] of that he went to hell and he did it
[42:04] for money though that's the reason why
[42:06] the Bible said he loved the wages of
[42:07] righteousness so he was getting paid oh
[42:09] yeah put a few more dollars in there
[42:10] guys put 10,000 more in there and I'll
[42:12] tell him about fornicating yeah what a
[42:16] devil amen but see he knew how to
[42:18] contact God and knew how to contact
[42:20] Devils come on that's a scary thing to
[42:23] do thank God we only contact Jesus
[42:25] Christ thank God amen amen I'd rather be
[42:28] a small little insignificant Pastor or
[42:31] whatever just preach God's word and be
[42:33] true to God and only contact God I'd
[42:35] rather do that than have all kinds of
[42:37] Supernatural Miracles or prophecies and
[42:39] contact Devils let me only be in touch
[42:42] with God Almighty Jesus Christ amen amen
[42:44] praise God hallelujah let me only honor
[42:46] and serve Jesus Christ so because I know
[42:48] when I get there he'll say Well done
[42:50] good and faithful serving
[42:52] Hallelujah you didn't contact witches or
[42:54] anything like that you only sought heav
[42:56] you waited on me praise God and In God's
[42:58] Time and season I answer you praise God
[43:08] Amen brother man said the teaching of
[43:10] Moses was perfect that was the
[43:11] difference he said we're not the same as
[43:13] the denominations we're separated
[43:17] people hallelujah he said the prophecy
[43:20] of balam was exactly right because he
[43:22] couldn't speak and nothing else but what
[43:24] God told him the anointing of God
[43:26] wouldn't speak nothing else and God
[43:27] Vindicated it by proving it was the
[43:29] truth but it was the teaching of balam
[43:31] that was wrong now what about all these
[43:33] message churches that say polygamy is
[43:35] okay it's the same devil amen amen they
[43:39] only preach that because they don't
[43:40] understand what brother R said they
[43:41] don't search their Bibles and they don't
[43:43] listen with a humble heart brother never
[43:46] supported polygamy no if you go read if
[43:48] you go listen to marriage and divorce
[43:49] there's only one one time when a man can
[43:52] divorce his wife and marry another only
[43:54] one and that's when that woman woman she
[43:57] lied to him at the beginning before they
[43:59] got married and said I I've never known
[44:00] a man and they got married and later he
[44:04] finds out she did know a man in that
[44:06] case only can a man put that one away
[44:09] and then marry another woman right
[44:12] that's the only one that's in Matthew
[44:13] Chapter 5 and Matthew 19 so let me just
[44:16] say like this in most cases marriage is
[44:18] until death and the church said amen
[44:22] Brothers there's no such a thing as well
[44:23] I want a new model I'm going to put away
[44:24] this this old model why I'm going to get
[44:26] a new new model wife shame on a man that
[44:28] would do that that's a lustful demonic
[44:30] Spirit praise God amen
[44:33] amen and what's the example of that it's
[44:35] Mary and Joseph Joseph he found Mary
[44:38] impregnated and he said well I don't
[44:39] want to disrespect her publicly I'll put
[44:41] her away privately cuz she said she was
[44:44] a virgin but look she's got a child now
[44:46] and look how God stopped that amen look
[44:48] look how God protects his word amen
[44:51] hallelujah praise God he said don't put
[44:53] her away cuz that which is conceived in
[44:55] Mary is of the the Holy Ghost praise God
[44:58] don't do not fear to take marry thy wife
[45:00] amen see the Bible interprets itself
[45:02] praise God
[45:04] Amen now that wasn't in my notes so
[45:06] hopefully that helps Somebody by God's
[45:07] grace now brother B next he goes through
[45:09] more examples from the Old Testament
[45:11] we're not going to read them but I just
[45:12] want to listen to you I would encourage
[45:15] you read First Kings chapter 22 it's
[45:17] micaah the prophet he's right after
[45:20] Elijah or maybe right with Elijah kind
[45:23] of it's kind of hard for me I haven't
[45:24] actually placed the the the
[45:26] chronological order together but it's it
[45:29] was Mah the true prophet of God against
[45:31] zedekiah the false
[45:34] prophet okay and so Ahab was the evil
[45:39] King and zedekiah and all the all the
[45:42] prophets were saying thus sayith the
[45:44] Lord go up go up and repossess the land
[45:46] Ahab go up and you'll be
[45:48] successful and they said uh what do you
[45:50] think Micaiah you're you're always I
[45:52] hate you you're always speaking evil
[45:54] against
[45:54] me
[45:58] he said if you go up there he said then
[46:00] he said you're going to die basically he
[46:02] said if you come back then the Lord
[46:03] never talked to me he said see why I
[46:06] hate him Jehoshaphat see why I hate this
[46:07] guy he's always speaking evil against me
[46:09] and brother said that's because Ahab was
[46:11] doing evil yeah if Ahab would do right
[46:14] God would speak good things to you
[46:15] praise God but when you do evil God has
[46:17] to speak judgments against you praise
[46:22] God and then the Bible said Mah said you
[46:25] know why I know because God showed me in
[46:27] heaven God was sitting on a throne and
[46:29] all these demons were coming up and God
[46:31] said who can deceive Ahab to believe a
[46:33] lie to go up and be killed and fulfill
[46:35] Elijah's prophecy and we've got Elijah
[46:38] we received Elijah and God heard this
[46:41] one that one and then the lying spirit
[46:42] said I'll come up I'll deceive those 400
[46:44] prophets I'll put a lying I'll be the
[46:45] lying spirit in their mouth and Mah said
[46:48] that's thus sayith the Lord and God said
[46:51] okay lying Spirit you go deceive Ahab
[46:53] he's got to he has to go die and fulfill
[46:55] what Elijah
[46:57] prophesied the church said but think
[47:00] about that think about you're one
[47:01] Prophet against 450 all 450 or shouting
[47:05] giving God you know trying to worship
[47:06] God or bail whatever they were doing you
[47:08] had 400 against one and God was with the
[47:11] one so don't be discouraged if you're
[47:12] standing alone if you're standing on the
[47:14] word you're standing with God hallelujah
[47:16] amen and really you're in the majority
[47:19] amen if God sing with you then the
[47:21] angels are with you and you're in the
[47:22] majority in heaven praise God Amen oh
[47:26] thank
[47:27] God the next one is Jeremiah and Hann
[47:30] and I in Jeremiah chapter
[47:32] 28 brother gives these examples haniah
[47:37] he agreed with the King and he put a
[47:38] yoke on himself and said he said thus
[47:40] sayi the Lord he said Israel is going to
[47:42] be back uh I'm sorry Israel is going to
[47:44] be back here in Jerusalem in two years
[47:47] thus sayi the Lord and Jeremiah had
[47:49] already said it's going to be 70 you
[47:51] know what Jeremiah said he said
[47:54] amen
[47:56] amen he said a prophet is known by when
[47:59] his word comes to pass yes amen so be
[48:03] it he knew where he stood church he
[48:05] didn't say well I don't know let me go
[48:07] check my writings let me go
[48:09] check he already spoke thus say the Lord
[48:12] praise God and the Bible said Hanah died
[48:14] that that very same year God killed him
[48:16] because he f prophesied a false prophecy
[48:19] yeah but look both look anointed hanah's
[48:23] got a yoke on and he he's he's so emot
[48:25] throws down the Yoke he said thus say
[48:27] the Lord and Jeremiah's over here thus
[48:29] sayith the Lord amen who you going to
[48:31] believe the one who's right with the
[48:32] word amen
[48:35] hallelujah you would you would have been
[48:37] on Jeremiah's side right you would have
[48:39] been on Mah's side
[48:41] right now the next one brother R gives
[48:43] is David when he brought the ark up the
[48:45] first
[48:46] time and uh brother R said look now this
[48:49] is a little bit different but he's
[48:51] saying here David danced and I danced
[48:53] remember I danced and shouted and jumped
[48:55] all over this place
[48:57] don't hit my head on there but the Bible
[48:59] said he had all the emotion all the
[49:01] jumping music everything but he he
[49:03] brought the Ark on a cart instead of
[49:05] carrying it on the levite shoulders and
[49:08] because that usza tried to steady it and
[49:10] he touched the ark and he died yeah yeah
[49:12] and brother said look when you obey the
[49:14] word of God you got to keep all the word
[49:16] of God yeah the dancing jumping shouting
[49:19] that's good but you also got to keep the
[49:21] word praise God amen amen so brother
[49:24] says look the anointing has to have
[49:26] obedience with it as well you can't just
[49:28] have emotion and excitement enthusiasm
[49:30] and praising God worshiping God that's
[49:32] good it's all good but you got to keep
[49:34] the word as well pra amen now sure just
[49:36] so you know three months later he
[49:37] brought the ark back again with with the
[49:40] Ark on the staves and God received it
[49:42] and nobody died yeah same dancing same
[49:45] that's why I'm happy to dance praise God
[49:47] same dancing same shouting same praising
[49:50] same everything the only difference was
[49:51] he now was obeying the word of God
[49:53] praise God fully now think about that
[49:56] just one thing off the word of God caus
[49:58] a man to
[49:59] die that's why I want this church to be
[50:01] founded on the word of God hallelujah we
[50:05] want you to have all the joy all the
[50:06] love all everything well we also want
[50:08] you to obey all the word of God Amen
[50:10] brother said you know
[50:12] uh he said when he said like he said uh
[50:16] the ark on a cart today is like a
[50:17] denominational idea like a woman
[50:19] preacher or praying to Mary like I've
[50:21] said or the Trinity that's a man-made
[50:23] cart yeah but see our arc's true our Ark
[50:26] is right where it needs to be praise God
[50:28] it's right above the heart of the
[50:29] preachers hallelujah what brother man
[50:32] says it's a nice little type there it's
[50:34] always above the heart it's right above
[50:35] the heart praise God all right
[50:39] now now brother now moves to our day and
[50:43] he reads 2 Timothy
[50:45] 3 where Paul said there will be perilous
[50:48] times in the last
[50:51] days and I want you to read 2 Timothy
[50:54] 3:13 so let's turn turn there 2 Timothy
[50:58] 3:13 and brother irin you could read
[51:00] that brother whenever you get it I'd
[51:01] appreciate that most you know this this
[51:04] is the section where Paul says men will
[51:05] be treacherous tra traitors heady
[51:07] high-minded lovers of Pleasures more
[51:09] than lovers of God having a form of godl
[51:11] denying the power thereof but Paul says
[51:14] something very important in verse 13 so
[51:16] brother uran could you read that
[51:18] please you men and shall and wor
[51:22] deceiving and being deceived amen
[51:26] so as as as deceptive as it was in Moses
[51:30] day or Mah's day or even Jesus day with
[51:33] Judas and Jesus our day is going to be
[51:37] more deceptive amen that's why I've said
[51:39] this from the PBA many times the most
[51:41] deceptive thing today to me is the tape
[51:43] Church movement because they love listen
[51:45] tapes they believe in miracles all these
[51:47] things but it's still wrong yeah that's
[51:49] my humble opinion that's why I'm looking
[51:51] at
[51:52] preachers I could be wrong but I believe
[51:55] I'm right
[51:56] because the word of God and brother's
[51:57] quotes go along with what I'm saying I'm
[51:59] trying to follow the word of God that's
[52:02] to me it's more
[52:05] deceptive like a woman just contacted me
[52:07] a couple weeks ago she said I follow uh
[52:09] brandom Tabernacle uh I want to come to
[52:11] your church do you guys follow the
[52:12] schedule Bram Tabernacle I said no ma'am
[52:14] she said okay I'm not going to come I
[52:15] said ma'am would you please consider
[52:17] here's a few videos I did about how a
[52:19] brandom tabernacle is off the word of
[52:21] God would you please like to listen to
[52:22] him she said no thank you I I I'll be
[52:24] happy with this now she won't even hear
[52:26] it now how is there any hope for that
[52:28] when you won't even hear the other
[52:31] side it's so sad I say I love you I'll
[52:34] be praying for you and I do pray for
[52:35] them I do pray for
[52:39] them now I want to get down to
[52:44] uh uh the pope now the Pope the pope
[52:47] Antichrist if we live to see it the pope
[52:49] will become this problem solver brother
[52:51] BR says and he'll solve all the economic
[52:54] problems all the peace problems the
[52:56] safety problems he'll solve all the
[52:57] problems but he'll have lying signs and
[52:59] wonders doing it yeah yeah who'll have
[53:02] Miracles now in most of the case it
[53:05] looks like they're going to be deceiving
[53:06] false
[53:07] Miracles okay yeah but he could he may
[53:11] have one Miracle that's a real miracle I
[53:12] don't know he he could be like bam he
[53:14] could get under the
[53:15] anointing but the Bible says lying
[53:17] wonders let's read that uh Revelation
[53:19] 1920 brother Aaron you want to read that
[53:21] when you get there Revelation 19:20 and
[53:24] then Mali do you want to go to 2
[53:26] Thessalonians 2:8 I'm going to send you
[53:28] to a different scripture to kind of
[53:30] conserve a little time here I God gra
[53:32] I've been preaching about 53 minutes you
[53:33] been a wonderful audience paying
[53:35] attention and enjoying the word of God
[53:37] God bless you for that so brother
[53:38] everyone have you ready 1920 yes sir and
[53:42] the Beast was taken and with him the
[53:44] false prophet that wrought Miracles
[53:46] before him with which he deceived them
[53:49] that had to receive the mark of the
[53:50] beast and them that worshiped His Image
[53:54] these both were cast alive into a lake
[53:57] of fire burning with Brimstone amen
[53:59] glory that's at the end of Armageddon
[54:01] right how did how did the Pope
[54:04] Antichrist get all these nations to
[54:06] fight against Jesus Christ he deceived
[54:08] them with lying signs and wonders
[54:11] yeah right did you know Church my
[54:14] brother showed me some videos there's
[54:15] magicians that walk on water that climb
[54:18] walls I think David Blaine's one of them
[54:21] I don't know these
[54:22] guys um one of them they said even flew
[54:25] away I don't know if that's trick I
[54:27] don't know if that what I don't know
[54:28] what it is but Satan does have pretty he
[54:31] can do pretty powerful things yeah
[54:34] right but the Antichrist he's going to
[54:37] be able to deceive because he's going to
[54:38] do lying wonders and lying Miracles now
[54:40] remember church we don't have time to go
[54:41] through this but in Exodus 11 those
[54:44] Egyptian M magicians did
[54:47] three imitations of God's power yeah
[54:50] first they were able to throw down rods
[54:52] and turns into snakes yeah but God's up
[54:55] their things death is swalled up in life
[54:58] amen hallelujah hallelujah and then
[55:00] they're able to turn water into
[55:03] blood and the last thing they could do
[55:06] was they could bring frogs out of the
[55:08] water but the next thing God said lice
[55:10] I'm turning all this dust to lice and
[55:12] they couldn't do
[55:13] it so they reached they can't even do a
[55:16] third of what God can do now really they
[55:18] can't do it they can't even do a third
[55:19] of a third of a third of a third because
[55:22] God is infinite God is powerful praise
[55:24] God but let just let you know our God is
[55:26] greater our God is stronger and our God
[55:29] will always have more power praise
[55:31] God and also in Ma I'm sorry yes in
[55:35] Matthew and Luke chapter 4 Satan takes
[55:38] Jesus up to a high mountain now think of
[55:40] that
[55:41] yeah and think think think what a think
[55:44] what a loving father God was God let his
[55:46] son be taken up to a high mountain by
[55:48] the
[55:48] devil see because God God only gave him
[55:51] permission to do certain things right am
[55:54] Satan has power to transport people now
[55:56] I don't know if that's what alien
[55:57] abductions is I don't know that's that's
[55:59] my guess I don't know but Satan could
[56:02] transport Jesus up to a high mountain
[56:04] tempt him and then bring him back to
[56:06] Jerusalem set him on the Pinnacle and
[56:08] show him all the kingdoms of the world
[56:10] in a moment's time yeah he has that
[56:12] power but remember he only has that
[56:14] power when God allows
[56:16] it I don't want that to happen to me so
[56:18] Lord spare me from that praise
[56:20] God just keep me safe and humble in my
[56:23] little place in the world you know
[56:25] keep me in the CLI of the rock praise
[56:26] God
[56:29] hallelujah but see Satan does have
[56:31] powers and he can do lying signs and
[56:33] wonders like uh I think we talked about
[56:35] last time apparitions right how many you
[56:37] seen the Catholic apparitions they they
[56:39] have they have statues of Mary and blood
[56:41] will flow out of her eyes and they'll
[56:42] they'll go kiss the statue oil oil will
[56:46] run out of Mary's hands the statue and
[56:48] they think that's God that's not God God
[56:51] never wanted us to kiss statues and bow
[56:52] down to statues and worship them
[56:55] but yet it's a lying sign and
[56:59] wonder right that that fit Satan can
[57:01] turn water to blood Satan can make blood
[57:04] come out of the statue it fits yeah he
[57:07] has power to do that if God allows it
[57:10] yes but how do you know who's right or
[57:12] wrong go back to the Bible yeah where
[57:14] does the bible say there's Purgatory the
[57:16] Bible don't say that where does the
[57:18] bible call the pope Holy Father Pope's
[57:20] not even in the Bible and the only
[57:22] person that's the Holy Father Is God
[57:23] Almighty Jesus Holy Father amen there's
[57:26] only one Holy Father that's God
[57:28] hallelujah amen that's how I know we're
[57:30] right am Mali can you read that it's 2
[57:34] Thessalonians 2 89 and 10 are verses
[57:38] about the Antichrist and he deceives by
[57:41] signs wonders and miracles now this case
[57:43] they're lying so that means they're
[57:45] they're motivated by the wrong Spirit go
[57:47] ahead
[57:49] malcol and then shall that Wicked be
[57:51] revealed and the Lord shall consume the
[57:53] spirit of his mouth and shall d the
[57:55] brightness of his coming even him whose
[57:57] coming is after the working of Satan
[57:58] with all power and signs wonders and
[58:01] with all deceivableness of
[58:02] unrighteousness in them that perish
[58:04] because they receive not the the truth
[58:05] that they might be saved there it is
[58:07] praise God how do you know the pope
[58:09] won't deceive you because you don't love
[58:13] sin you're
[58:15] chosen uh to Salvation by belief of the
[58:18] truth love of the truth in other words
[58:21] everyone in in the mark of the beast
[58:23] will hate truth but you love it praise
[58:25] God Amen so you know you're not going to
[58:27] be a part of that system you're not
[58:29] going to take the mark of the beast
[58:30] because Jesus Christ has already marked
[58:32] your soul with his holy spirit praise
[58:34] God Amen I can't be marked by two I can
[58:36] only be marked by one and I'm going be
[58:38] marked by Christ hallelujah amen
[58:42] amen and notice the pope will only
[58:45] deceive those people who love
[58:46] unrighteousness who love sin they put
[58:49] out an article two weeks ago the Pope
[58:51] the the Vatican did they put out an
[58:53] article and they now they're going to
[58:54] start uh uh investigating and and seeing
[58:57] if if if trans people and gays could be
[58:59] a part of the ministry with the Catholic
[59:02] Church oh my and trying to include
[59:04] them see it's going to church we're
[59:08] going to overcome by God's grace we're
[59:09] going to overcome amen we're on the side
[59:11] of the right praise God amen amen God
[59:13] standing with us amen hallelujah amen
[59:15] now before I move on brother man said
[59:17] this I'm going to read it he said when
[59:19] you listen to the tape even maybe I'll
[59:21] be gone
[59:23] someday when the Lord has finished with

[59:30] voice what I'm telling you if he takes
[59:31] me before his coming just remember I've
[59:33] spoken to you in the name of the Lord by
[59:35] the word of the Lord amen that's a
[59:38] prophet hallelujah amen in this sermon
[59:40] brother man makes a powerful prophecy
[59:42] brother John he says it's predicted that
[59:45] they're going to do it and they're going
[59:46] to do it it's thus sayith the lord
[59:48] they're going to do it he said you think
[59:50] them nominations will ever break up and
[59:52] come back to the word of God he said
[59:54] it's thus say the Lord they won't yeah
[59:57] he said will they go in the mark of the
[59:58] beast he said thus sayith the Lord they
[1:00:00] will praise God and look has a has a
[1:00:04] denomination since 1965 broken up and
[1:00:06] say we're coming back to the Lord Jesus
[1:00:08] Christ baptism not a one of
[1:00:11] them he was a genuine Prophet
[1:00:14] Hallelujah they only fall further and
[1:00:17] further away what man talks like that
[1:00:21] only a man that's been in God's
[1:00:23] presence Hallelujah I use that quote all
[1:00:26] the time these people say brother R
[1:00:27] don't have any prophecies that come to
[1:00:29] pass I said what about that show me one
[1:00:32] I'm still waiting for I'm still waiting
[1:00:34] yeah I made that video like nine years
[1:00:35] ago I'm still waiting for somebody to
[1:00:36] show me when Hallelujah they won't they
[1:00:39] can't praise God because God's word is
[1:00:42] always true God doesn't lie praise God
[1:00:45] amen
[1:00:49] amen
[1:00:52] now all right and then I want to hit a
[1:00:54] few more more scriptures here let's
[1:00:56] see yeah now I'm going to stop on
[1:00:58] brother bam sermon I stopped about
[1:01:00] halfway now I just want to lay in some
[1:01:01] Bible
[1:01:04] verses now I want to just talk about the
[1:01:06] anointing for a few moments here I've
[1:01:07] already been preaching an hour so maybe
[1:01:09] give me 20 more minutes here by God's
[1:01:11] grace we'll see how it goes I I always
[1:01:12] underestimate the time so it's probably
[1:01:14] be 30 minutes okay I I always say 15
[1:01:16] more minutes at home and it always turns
[1:01:17] into 30
[1:01:18] minutes I'm trying now to understand
[1:01:22] this topic you have to understand you
[1:01:24] have three Parts you have a body mind
[1:01:26] and
[1:01:28] soul okay and the anointing of on us is
[1:01:31] supposed to fall on all three areas
[1:01:33] right but with people like Judas and
[1:01:36] balam the Holy Ghost never Falls in
[1:01:38] their soul their innermost part but it
[1:01:41] can fall on their minds that's why balum
[1:01:44] could see Israel goodly tense he could
[1:01:47] see the star where in his had anointing
[1:01:49] on his mind but it never got down to his
[1:01:51] soul
[1:01:52] amen right that's the difference between
[1:01:55] the wheat and the
[1:01:57] tears
[1:01:59] okay and church every person has a gift
[1:02:02] of God in here yeah amen the Bible makes
[1:02:06] that plain Romans 11:29 let's read that
[1:02:09] that's going to be crucial for us to
[1:02:10] read there Romans 11:29 my do you want
[1:02:13] to read that buddy Romans 11:2 I use
[1:02:15] your name today in the sermon praise God
[1:02:17] and then John can you get a different
[1:02:18] scripture for me brother can you get 1
[1:02:20] Corinthians 12:7 1 Corinthians 12:7 and
[1:02:23] then Romans 11:2
[1:02:25] M these two verses say you have a gift
[1:02:29] and calling even if you don't
[1:02:31] repent like Bam Bam had a calling to
[1:02:33] serve God but he didn't
[1:02:35] repent right Judas brother said Judas
[1:02:37] had the highest calling in the Bible to
[1:02:38] be a missionary but he didn't
[1:02:41] repent right he had gifts anyway he had
[1:02:44] gifts he had he could cast out Devils he
[1:02:46] could do all those things Jesus gave him
[1:02:47] power to do okay M can you read that
[1:02:49] Romans 11:29 for the gifts and calling
[1:02:52] of God are without repentance awesome
[1:02:55] good job buddy see you you have gifts
[1:02:58] and callings whether you repent or not
[1:03:00] right remember Judas and Judas the
[1:03:02] scariot and balam are the prime examples
[1:03:04] the easiest ones to see because we know
[1:03:06] the Bible says they went to hell yet
[1:03:08] they had gifts yet they did Supernatural
[1:03:10] things okay then 1 Corinthians 12:7
[1:03:13] brother this has always been helpful to
[1:03:14] me 1 Corinthians 12:7 but the
[1:03:16] manifestation of the spirit is given to
[1:03:18] every man to profit with all how many
[1:03:21] men get it every man yeah that's why
[1:03:24] told you sisters and you Brothers when I
[1:03:25] first came all of you have a gift of
[1:03:28] God whether it's faith faith moves
[1:03:31] mountains you just God reveals the will
[1:03:33] and you just speak God's word and faith
[1:03:35] will move them out amen amen or how
[1:03:37] about knowledge someone needs a
[1:03:38] scripture and the Holy Ghost anoints you
[1:03:39] you give them the knowledge
[1:03:40] understanding of the word of God a
[1:03:42] sisters can have that how about wisdom
[1:03:43] wisdom is what to do and when to do it
[1:03:46] when should I buy that and a sister will
[1:03:48] say the Lord told me do this that buy it
[1:03:50] then and do do do and then build it
[1:03:52] there and that will be a gift of God God
[1:03:55] praise God tongues interpretation
[1:03:57] prophecy discernment we have a sister in
[1:03:59] the church she got discernment I've seen
[1:04:01] it we were going into to get a little
[1:04:04] rental trying to get uh her uh apartment
[1:04:06] to rent and I talked to the lady there
[1:04:08] she's really nice and we left and this
[1:04:10] sister in the church she's a new sister
[1:04:12] she said that woman's corrupt and I
[1:04:14] thought I don't think so she was pretty
[1:04:16] nice I mean she's kind of a young
[1:04:17] Christian maybe she
[1:04:18] just and come to find out she tried to
[1:04:21] steal the money thank God she didn't
[1:04:22] steal her money all the way and then one
[1:04:24] time my wife was really struggling she
[1:04:26] was hurting I think it was after one of
[1:04:27] the miscarriages and this new sister she
[1:04:30] the the Lord told her she only been to
[1:04:31] church about a year and a half sister
[1:04:33] Lena said go up and tell Kristen these
[1:04:35] certain certain things so she went up
[1:04:37] and she said the Lord told me to come
[1:04:38] tell you this and that and you're
[1:04:39] struggling with that and God wants God
[1:04:41] wants you to know this and it was
[1:04:42] exactly
[1:04:43] right that's just how simple it is amen
[1:04:46] it don't have to be like every time not
[1:04:48] be like thus say the Lord I'm going to
[1:04:49] do this and that in front of everybody
[1:04:50] you don't have to be like that every
[1:04:51] time yeah it might yeah but it don't
[1:04:54] have to be yeah you just follow God's
[1:05:01] leading all
[1:05:04] right so also let's read a good one here
[1:05:08] um I already went through balum bam had
[1:05:10] Visions from God he got the anointing
[1:05:11] but then he got on the anointing of
[1:05:12] Satan to teach false Judas had the
[1:05:14] anointing to uh to cast out Devils do
[1:05:17] all those things the disciples did but
[1:05:19] then he got Satan filled his heart to
[1:05:20] betray G uh betray Jesus the one that
[1:05:23] was new to me was Matthew
[1:05:25] 1227 Matthew 12:27 let's read that one
[1:05:28] brother Joel you want to read that for
[1:05:29] us Matthew uh 12:27 and
[1:05:32] 28 I never seen this till today I never
[1:05:34] really thought about
[1:05:35] it
[1:05:39] amen I love when I get fresh thoughts
[1:05:41] don't you like that it's Revelation
[1:05:43] praise God whenever you ready but you
[1:05:44] can read uh 12:
[1:05:47] 27-28 and if I by of cast out Devils by
[1:05:51] whom do your children cast them out
[1:05:54] therefore they shall be your judgment
[1:05:56] but if I cast out Devils by the spirit
[1:05:59] of God then the kingdom of God Has Come
[1:06:02] amen here's another group that's casting
[1:06:06] out Devils but they're Pharisees they're
[1:06:08] Children of the Pharisees who are the
[1:06:10] Pharisees the Pharisees were the
[1:06:11] legalistic Jews that rejected
[1:06:14] Jesus so here we have a group of people
[1:06:16] and Jesus said most of the Pharisees
[1:06:18] were children of the
[1:06:19] devil and they make their Converse twice
[1:06:22] as much children of the devil as they
[1:06:24] were yeah and yet they're casting out
[1:06:27] Devils isn't that
[1:06:30] something now they weren't using the
[1:06:31] name of Jesus because they didn't
[1:06:32] believe in Jesus so maybe they cast out
[1:06:34] devils like David did they played and
[1:06:35] worshiped
[1:06:37] Jehovah or maybe they said in the name
[1:06:39] of Jehovah and the name of Yahweh come
[1:06:42] out and then you it' have to come
[1:06:43] out because that's the power of God Amen
[1:06:47] yet the
[1:06:48] Pharisees hated Jesus just like balum
[1:06:52] hated the Jews yes am just like judas's
[1:06:55] scarrett sold out
[1:06:57] Jesus that was new to me i' never seen
[1:06:59] that till today I was like that's
[1:07:02] right so Judas balam and the children of
[1:07:05] the Pharisees likely in their souls
[1:07:07] brother said they have like a serpent
[1:07:09] they don't have the seed of God they
[1:07:10] don't have the dove in their soul yeah
[1:07:13] amen but God can anoint their minds and
[1:07:16] they can do Supernatural things they can
[1:07:19] prophesy they can heal the sick they can
[1:07:21] lay hands on the sick they shall recover
[1:07:23] they can discern
[1:07:24] but see then they leave God's anointing
[1:07:26] and they work iniquity they have their
[1:07:28] little sin secret on the
[1:07:30] side remember a few years ago U one of
[1:07:33] those dating websites the adultery
[1:07:35] websites I forget somebody hacked them
[1:07:38] and they they they they they shared all
[1:07:40] these men that were committing adultery
[1:07:41] on their wives and a lot of them
[1:07:42] committed uh suicide see these these men
[1:07:46] have Secret Lives I don't want to have
[1:07:47] any secret life I want everybody to see
[1:07:50] my life I want to be plain Hallelujah I
[1:07:52] don't want to hide nothing I want to
[1:07:54] give it all to Jesus praise God Amen I
[1:07:57] was so glad I'm like thank God I'm not
[1:07:58] one of them hallah thank God I got no
[1:08:01] Seekers praise
[1:08:03] God I tell Jesus forgive me of my sins
[1:08:06] give me Grace to overcome give me
[1:08:07] strength yeah amen I don't want a secret
[1:08:09] life all these guys had Secret Lives
[1:08:12] balum Judas the children of the
[1:08:15] Pharisees but what's interesting is they
[1:08:17] knew the approach on how to get the
[1:08:21] anointing and everybody knows it today
[1:08:23] you got confess your sins and you got to
[1:08:25] start worshiping
[1:08:27] God isn't that what the Bible says let
[1:08:29] me read that verse
[1:08:31] uh the Bible says he inhabits the
[1:08:33] Praises of his people let me find that
[1:08:35] oh yeah Psalms
[1:08:37] 22:3 Mal you want to read that Psalm
[1:08:40] 22:3 if you want to feel God's anointing
[1:08:42] start praising God but first confess
[1:08:45] your sins right CU you got to have a
[1:08:49] sacrifice that's a sacrifice God forgive
[1:08:51] me and then you start praising Jesus you
[1:08:54] can have your own worship session Sister
[1:08:55] Sarah you can just dance or you can
[1:08:58] praise God you get on your knees that's
[1:08:59] what I like to do in my prayer closet or
[1:09:01] at the church sometimes I lay on my face
[1:09:03] I'll just praise God and pretty soon
[1:09:05] you'll feel the anointing pretty soon
[1:09:06] you're going to start being joyful
[1:09:08] praise God or you start weeping and
[1:09:09] crying because you feel the sacred
[1:09:10] presence of Jesus amen
[1:09:13] amen Mal you want to read that Psalm
[1:09:17] 22:3 Thou Art holy oh thou that inhabit
[1:09:20] the praise of Hallelujah when you start
[1:09:22] praising God his anointing Falls right
[1:09:24] on
[1:09:26] you and the church said amen amen and
[1:09:30] that lines up with a verse I preached
[1:09:32] last time 2 Kings
[1:09:34] 3:15 Elisha said somebody bring me a
[1:09:37] Minstrel somebody bring me somebody that
[1:09:39] can play the strings like David and when
[1:09:42] when when when the menro played the Holy
[1:09:44] Ghost SP Elijah and he said make a
[1:09:46] valley full of ditches the victory is
[1:09:48] coming that's thus sayith the Lord amen
[1:09:51] praise God Amen the gifts of God started
[1:09:54] operating when he started worshiping and
[1:09:55] praising God Amen
[1:10:02] Hallelujah all right I'm at an hour and
[1:10:05] 10 see I'm almost done here so that's
[1:10:09] how you get the anointing now I'm going
[1:10:10] to bring up this topic Aon and I were
[1:10:12] texting about it and John we talked
[1:10:13] about it can Satan heal right we all
[1:10:15] agreed Satan can't heal that's what
[1:10:17] Jesus said in uh uh Matthew 12 I think
[1:10:20] it's 26 uh let me go back there I'm
[1:10:22] going to read that one
[1:10:24] [Music]
[1:10:25] but there's some interesting quotes I
[1:10:26] want to read a quote brother Aon and I
[1:10:27] were texting about this
[1:10:31] quote and it just related perfectly to
[1:10:33] this topic of the anointed Winds of the
[1:10:35] end times I thought it'd be perfect to
[1:10:36] read Matthew
[1:10:40] 12:20 six there it
[1:10:43] is so Jesus was casting out devils and
[1:10:46] the Pharisees are saying well you're a
[1:10:47] devil and Jesus said Devils don't cast
[1:10:49] out Devils yeah amen if they do Their
[1:10:51] Kingdoms divided yeah amen verse 26 and
[1:10:55] if Satan cast out Satan he's divided
[1:10:56] against himself how shall then his
[1:10:58] kingdom
[1:10:59] stand Satan cannot heal oh yeah the
[1:11:02] example I heard brother random give was
[1:11:04] uh when God sent boils on Egypt the uh
[1:11:08] the The Magicians couldn't take him away
[1:11:10] they couldn't bring healing is that a
[1:11:11] great example that was anointing was the
[1:11:13] time I thought that's a beautiful
[1:11:14] example yeah brother said he saw demons
[1:11:17] that would make ropes stand up straight
[1:11:19] or snakes dance or people walk on coals
[1:11:21] that's not that's not healing that's a
[1:11:23] trick yeah yeah some type of perverted
[1:11:25] trick demon power but God is the only
[1:11:27] one who heals he created the bodies
[1:11:30] Hallelujah and if he created it he can
[1:11:32] fix it Hallelujah no problem for him but
[1:11:35] Satan didn't create he can't he's not a
[1:11:37] Creator he's a perverter praise God
[1:11:40] amen
[1:11:43] amen now here's the quote brother ER and
[1:11:45] I were talking
[1:11:46] about brother Ram said he went to France
[1:11:49] and also another country I don't know if
[1:11:52] he says it in here but he says he went
[1:11:53] to France
[1:11:56] France he says oh yeah there's an idol
[1:11:58] of a dead woman in France and he
[1:12:01] said he said people would go up to that
[1:12:03] Idol and get healed and brother R said
[1:12:05] they can do that because God honors
[1:12:07] their faith okay now for me like I was
[1:12:11] telling brother Aaron that that might be
[1:12:13] true God might honor their faith but
[1:12:15] like I told brother Aaron I said if I
[1:12:17] want to teach something I got to be able
[1:12:18] to teach it from Genesis to Revelation
[1:12:20] so let me just give this as
[1:12:21] encouragement let's search our Bibles
[1:12:23] and if we can find some then I can come
[1:12:25] back and preach it praise God Amen okay
[1:12:28] now let me say this uh that was a great
[1:12:30] uh quote there brother I appreciate that
[1:12:32] brother
[1:12:34] Aaron
[1:12:36] um nine times brother Ram said Satan
[1:12:38] cannot heal we just read it we all agree
[1:12:40] Satan can't heal now here's some other
[1:12:42] thoughts brother Ram didn't give us all
[1:12:44] the details of that story maybe the
[1:12:45] witch doctors actually were giving out
[1:12:47] herbs to people and they got healed well
[1:12:50] that would be God using Divine Healing
[1:12:52] right remember the one time Isaiah said
[1:12:54] go get some figs and put it on those
[1:12:56] boils and the figs healed the
[1:12:58] boils God uses herbs to heal praise God
[1:13:01] he uses plants to heal sometimes see we
[1:13:04] don't know all the details right maybe
[1:13:06] they maybe he maybe they got the uh the
[1:13:08] herbs they rubbed them on they stood by
[1:13:10] the statue and left but it wasn't the
[1:13:12] statue it was God's herbs that did the
[1:13:14] healing Satan can't heal no right
[1:13:17] another example this is interesting
[1:13:20] Devils might have made those people act
[1:13:22] like they got healed by the statue
[1:13:24] because I've seen that
[1:13:26] before in Guyana and
[1:13:29] Pennsylvania women were two women come
[1:13:32] up for prayer and the Holy Ghost was
[1:13:34] there and before I could lay my hands on
[1:13:35] the woman she passed out and everybody
[1:13:37] thought praise God it's the Holy Ghost
[1:13:39] and I went down to pray for her she
[1:13:40] started kicking and fighting against me
[1:13:41] I said look at that Satan was doing
[1:13:43] everything he could so I couldn't lay
[1:13:45] hands on the sick so they'd recover my I
[1:13:48] said I learned a good lesson that day
[1:13:49] praise God Amen so maybe these sick
[1:13:52] people come before the idol and they
[1:13:54] pass out or something they get oh it
[1:13:57] could be pretend yeah come on we don't
[1:13:59] know we don't have enough details but I
[1:14:01] know that was real cuz then the I and
[1:14:03] then we prayed for her the devil was
[1:14:04] cast out she screamed and she was
[1:14:06] weeping and crying she was a new
[1:14:07] creature praise God Amen and then I was
[1:14:09] in Pennsylvania a couple years later
[1:14:11] over there brother Jim's Church brother
[1:14:12] Jim shix and a sister come up and the
[1:14:15] same thing happened and and the same
[1:14:16] thing happened people thought it was God
[1:14:18] I said no it's not it's the
[1:14:21] devil God God gave me
[1:14:23] you know he taught me before so I'd be
[1:14:26] ready and the same thing happened I went
[1:14:28] down to pray for her and she got this
[1:14:29] mean look on her face she's still alive
[1:14:30] today she's sweet sister boy she's she's
[1:14:32] really delivered from that devil now she
[1:14:34] she's so sweet she's forced brother Jim
[1:14:35] so much with all of her heart she got
[1:14:37] this mean face and she started cooking
[1:14:38] like this and I said in the name of
[1:14:40] Jesus Christ come out of her Satan come
[1:14:42] out and then she let out a scream and
[1:14:43] she was well after
[1:14:45] that see so that's two other thoughts
[1:14:47] that could happen because remember Satan
[1:14:50] does lying signs and wonders and
[1:14:52] miracles
[1:14:55] or here's another example the witch
[1:14:56] doctor could have been like balam and
[1:14:58] went and talked to God and prayed and
[1:14:59] made sacrifices and then maybe prayed
[1:15:02] for the people in the name of
[1:15:05] Jesus and then he went back to doing the
[1:15:07] witch witch enchantments like we don't
[1:15:11] know the
[1:15:12] details but we know God's the Healer
[1:15:14] praise God Amen he's the Creator he's
[1:15:17] the sustainer he's the Healer he's the
[1:15:19] forgiver he's the Redeemer praise God
[1:15:22] Jesus Christ is our all all praise God
[1:15:25] Amen two more thoughts Satan only has
[1:15:28] power when God allows it remember God
[1:15:31] allowed The Magicians just to to mimic
[1:15:34] the first three
[1:15:35] plagues God gave Satan power over
[1:15:38] everything in job's life except his
[1:15:41] life and again God let Satan take Jesus
[1:15:44] transported the mountain transported
[1:15:46] Jerusalem but he couldn't touch Jesus
[1:15:52] amen
[1:15:54] the second point and this is important
[1:15:56] brother Iran and John I want you if you
[1:15:57] guys are going to be preachers or
[1:15:58] whatever got to hear this one God will
[1:16:01] sometimes honor people's gifts even if
[1:16:03] they're disobedient
[1:16:06] yeah okay here's two here's three
[1:16:08] examples in numbers 20 God told Moses go
[1:16:11] speak to the Rock and'll bring forth
[1:16:12] water and Moses said you bunch of rebels
[1:16:15] all you guys do is complain and he
[1:16:17] smoked the Rock and brought forth water
[1:16:19] and God said you magnified yourself you
[1:16:22] pridefully glorified yourself you're not
[1:16:24] going to the promised land yet the gift
[1:16:27] operated brother Aaron told me a good
[1:16:29] story about a preacher that he heard
[1:16:32] there was a preacher he had the gift of
[1:16:33] healing but he got drunk right is that
[1:16:35] right and a mother brought her son up to
[1:16:37] be healed of club feet and under the
[1:16:40] anointing he prayed for her or prayed
[1:16:42] for the boy and the boy was healed yet
[1:16:43] the preacher was
[1:16:44] drunk because God honored the gift that
[1:16:47] was in the man's
[1:16:49] life isn't that something see that's
[1:16:52] right brother said he said you can send
[1:16:54] your soul to hell with a gift brother
[1:16:56] like balum did see that preacher got so
[1:16:59] relaxed I can get drunk anyway God still
[1:17:01] going to pour out his blessings well God
[1:17:02] is yeah if they have faith God's still
[1:17:04] going to honor
[1:17:05] Fai but we got to be faithful with our
[1:17:07] gifts amen the second example 2 Kings 2:
[1:17:12] 23-2 Elisha had a double anointing of
[1:17:15] the Holy Ghost my goodness and these
[1:17:18] children were mocking him saying thou
[1:17:20] bald head thou bald head you're a
[1:17:22] baldheaded creature and Elijah said thus
[1:17:25] sayith the Lord and the she bears come
[1:17:27] down there and killed 42 of
[1:17:30] them and brother R said that was not the
[1:17:32] spirit of God that was Elijah's anger he
[1:17:35] had the gift to do
[1:17:38] it he had the gift to do it that's why
[1:17:41] we got to be careful with the gifts yeah
[1:17:43] amen and now let me give you one from
[1:17:44] brother Brandon in 1947 brother Rand
[1:17:47] admits on tape he said I got to the spot
[1:17:50] in prayer lines when I said bring
[1:17:51] nothing up here but Mar mirales look up
[1:17:53] nothing but
[1:17:55] Miracles and he said think about that
[1:17:57] even Jesus never did that and brother BR
[1:17:59] said the Lord get let him got away with
[1:18:01] it for six months before he showed him
[1:18:02] he was wrong and brother Bram said I was
[1:18:05] in balam's
[1:18:08] shoes he was disobeying God yeah come on
[1:18:12] by trying to prove to everybody look
[1:18:13] what God can do look and God never said
[1:18:15] to do
[1:18:16] that think about that all the people
[1:18:18] with lesser diseases weren't even
[1:18:19] getting prayed for just the big Miracles
[1:18:22] because brother wanted to try to prove
[1:18:23] to everybody God was a Healer but he
[1:18:25] didn't ask God about that first God
[1:18:28] still honored his
[1:18:30] prayers he honored the
[1:18:33] gift
[1:18:35] Hallelujah and church I'll just be
[1:18:37] honest like this as a pastor I have a
[1:18:38] gift to pastor and sometimes some days
[1:18:40] I'll have bad days some days I'll
[1:18:43] struggle with sin different Temptations
[1:18:45] I'll ask God to forgive me I'll come to
[1:18:46] church I'll preach the word of God and
[1:18:48] God's holy ghost will fall but
[1:18:50] afterwards I still got to live a Godly
[1:18:52] life yeah amen amen I I'll be someone
[1:18:55] like I had such an awful day I I got
[1:18:57] angry I got I did this and I did that
[1:18:59] and yet God will still pour out his
[1:19:01] blessings because God honors his gift
[1:19:04] yes amen but I want to be faithful with
[1:19:06] my
[1:19:07] gift Amen
[1:19:09] brother I don't want to use the gift
[1:19:11] just for popularity just for money just
[1:19:13] for whatever I want to use God gift with
[1:19:16] a pure heart
[1:19:18] amen all right I'm closing it's been an
[1:19:21] hour and 20 so usually I preach an hour
[1:19:23] and a half so this is actually pretty
[1:19:24] good that's pretty good go to First
[1:19:28] John first John the book of First John
[1:19:30] at the end of the New
[1:19:32] Testament verses 7 to 10 if you want the
[1:19:35] anointing this is how we do
[1:19:39] [Music]
[1:19:41] it first John chapter 1 then we'll go to
[1:19:44] First John chapter 2 and we'll be done
[1:19:45] just two more two more portions of
[1:19:47] scripture saying you've been a wonderful
[1:19:49] uh Christian audience
[1:19:51] here
[1:19:56] verse
[1:19:58] seven if we walk in the light as he's in
[1:20:00] the light we have Fellowship one with
[1:20:02] another and the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:20:03] his son cleanses us from all sin how
[1:20:05] many can say amen amen all sin not some
[1:20:08] sin all
[1:20:10] sin when we say Sorry God takes it all
[1:20:14] away verse eight if we say we have no
[1:20:17] sin I didn't sin today brother I never
[1:20:19] sin we deceive ourselves and the truth
[1:20:21] is not in US
[1:20:23] see every and remember everybody has a
[1:20:25] gift right all the sisters have gifts
[1:20:28] too see we all got to be careful with
[1:20:30] our
[1:20:32] gifts verse n if we confess if that's a
[1:20:35] great big if isn't it that's a big
[1:20:37] little word isn't it that's a little
[1:20:38] word but it means a lot if we confess
[1:20:40] our sins he's faithful and just to
[1:20:42] forgive us of our sins and cleanse us
[1:20:44] from all unrighteousness now let's go to
[1:20:46] chapter 2 verse
[1:20:51] 20
[1:20:56] chapter 2 ver 20 this has gone very well
[1:20:59] praise God I didn't think I'd have
[1:21:01] enough time to get through that but I
[1:21:02] think I got most of it and if you want
[1:21:04] some homework you can go read all those
[1:21:05] chapters I listed out there and you can
[1:21:07] or List actually the best thing we do go
[1:21:09] listen to anointed ones at the end times
[1:21:11] that's a tremendous
[1:21:13] message chapter 2 verse
[1:21:17] 20 actually let's read 19 now think
[1:21:20] about the people that have left this
[1:21:21] church in sin they went out from us
[1:21:23] because why they were not of us they
[1:21:25] were different
[1:21:26] seed right I'm talking about the Sinners
[1:21:28] not the saints that go to another church
[1:21:29] I'm talking about the Sinners when they
[1:21:31] leave here and they sin they left
[1:21:33] because they weren't the same seed as
[1:21:34] you guys you guys are the right seed
[1:21:37] Hallelujah that's right for if they had
[1:21:39] been of us they no doubt would have
[1:21:41] continued with us but they went out that
[1:21:43] they might be made manifest that they
[1:21:44] were not all of us that's why people
[1:21:47] leave the church they're they're they're
[1:21:48] not the same quality as you Hallelujah
[1:21:51] they're not wheat like you are
[1:21:53] verse 20 but ye have an unction that
[1:21:55] means anointing what are we talking
[1:21:56] about the anointed ones at the end times
[1:21:58] who's the one that's really Anointed
[1:22:00] with the spirit of God it's us we're the
[1:22:03] real anointed ones of the end times
[1:22:04] praise God I heard a preacher preach
[1:22:05] that I really like that
[1:22:07] talk right the rain falls on the just
[1:22:10] and the unjust but the real people are
[1:22:12] the just ones the weak The Good Seed the
[1:22:14] children of God and we've got God's
[1:22:16] anointing on us praise God
[1:22:19] Amen but we have an anointing from the
[1:22:21] Holy One and you know all
[1:22:24] things now verse 27 the last verse and
[1:22:27] then we're going to close you've been a
[1:22:29] wonderful wonderful
[1:22:30] audience but the anointing which ye have
[1:22:33] received of Christ abides in you and you
[1:22:36] need not that any man teach you this is
[1:22:39] referring to overcoming seducers if you
[1:22:41] read the previous
[1:22:43] verse so when Satan's trying to seduce
[1:22:45] you or deceive you you don't need
[1:22:47] anybody to teach you you need the
[1:22:48] anointing yeah Amen brother you need the
[1:22:50] anointing to overcome lies the anointing
[1:22:52] to overcome gossip the anointing to come
[1:22:53] over lust or greed or fear fear of death
[1:22:57] whatever it is you need the anointing to
[1:22:59] overcome
[1:23:02] that need not that any man teach you but
[1:23:05] as the same anointing teaches you all
[1:23:06] things and his truth and is no lie
[1:23:08] there's no lie in the truth there's no
[1:23:10] lie in God's anointing praise God
[1:23:12] hallelujah won't
[1:23:15] lie he says even as it ha taught you ye
[1:23:18] shall abide in him and now my little
[1:23:20] children my little children and Young
[1:23:23] City abide in Christ that when he shall
[1:23:27] appear we may have confidence and not be
[1:23:29] ashamed before him at is coming let's
[1:23:32] stand to our feet praise
[1:23:35] God you know after a service like that
[1:23:37] it's good to worship god let's let's
[1:23:39] clap and give Jesus some some praise and
[1:23:41] can we do that by God's gra thank you
[1:23:43] Jesus thank you Lord we love you Jesus
[1:23:46] we love your anointing praise God
[1:23:49] hallelujah
[1:23:51] hallelujah
[1:23:54] Hallelujah he inhabits the Praises of
[1:23:56] his people praise
[1:24:00] God now I hope that was a help by God's
[1:24:02] grace was that a blessing amen it was
[1:24:04] this is one of the deepest subjects I
[1:24:07] think seven Thunders might be a little
[1:24:08] deeper I don't know it depends how you
[1:24:10] approach it I believe they're already
[1:24:12] revealed I believe the seven Thunders
[1:24:13] already utter their voices but some
[1:24:14] people don't
[1:24:15] but the point
[1:24:18] is we have to have the anointing of
[1:24:20] Christ on us when the anointing is on us
[1:24:22] we'll be able to judge between good and
[1:24:23] evil praise God and we will always stay
[1:24:27] with the word we'll always pass the word
[1:24:29] test and we will not be deceived yes
[1:24:32] amen hallelujah because the elect can
[1:24:36] not be deceived amen I'm a witness
[1:24:39] Brother Ray brother Irvin I'm sorry
[1:24:41] Irvin I'm a witness I heard this message
[1:24:44] in November 2001 I've not been deceived
[1:24:46] since no preachers come around and
[1:24:48] swindle me over with some you know
[1:24:50] money-making schemes or uh anything
[1:24:52] anything like that this message always
[1:24:54] proves who's right amen amen because
[1:24:57] it's the word of
