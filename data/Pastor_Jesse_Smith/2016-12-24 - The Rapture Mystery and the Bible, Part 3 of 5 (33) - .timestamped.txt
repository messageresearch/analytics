[0:03] when will the rapture occur the rapture
[0:07] will occur at an unknown day an hour
[0:09] according to Jesus in mark 13 verses 32
[0:12] and 33 so the literal day and hour the
[0:15] rapture is one mystery that God will not
[0:17] reveal about the rapture but the Bible
[0:20] and Jesus described the conditions times
[0:22] and seasons that must be met before the
[0:24] rapture can occur immediately after st.
[0:27] Paul wrote about the rapture of the true
[0:29] bride in first Thessalonians 4 13
[0:32] through 18 chapter 5 begins with these
[0:34] powerful words assuring Christians that
[0:37] they are not appointed to the wrath of
[0:39] the Great Tribulation but to be saved or
[0:41] delivered from the sudden destruction
[0:43] that will come upon the earth but of the
[0:46] times and the seasons brethren you have
[0:48] no need that I write unto you for
[0:50] yourselves know perfectly that the day
[0:52] of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the
[0:54] night for when they shall say peace and
[0:56] safety then sudden destruction cometh
[0:58] upon them as travail upon a woman with
[1:01] child and they shall not escape but ye
[1:04] brethren are not in darkness that that
[1:06] day should overtake you as a thief
[1:08] you're all the children of light and the
[1:10] children of the day we are not of the
[1:13] night nor of darkness therefore let us
[1:15] not sleep as do others but let us watch
[1:18] any sober for they that sleep sleep in
[1:20] the night and they that be drunken are
[1:22] drunken in the night but let us who are
[1:25] of the day be sober putting on the
[1:26] breastplate of faith and love and
[1:27] foreign helmet the hope of salvation for
[1:31] God hath not appointed us to wrath but
[1:33] to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus
[1:35] Christ who died for us that whether we
[1:38] wake or sleep we should live together
[1:40] with him what a glorious promise from
[1:45] God true Christians will not be
[1:46] overtaken by the wrath of God the sudden
[1:49] destruction coming upon the earth holy
[1:51] ghost filled Christians are children of
[1:53] the day and light and are appointed unto
[1:55] salvation and deliverance through our
[1:58] Lord Jesus Christ there are five reasons
[2:01] why the rapture is pre-tribulation on
[2:04] this video we will only summarize the
[2:06] five reasons and give the scriptural
[2:08] support for each reason if you'd like an
[2:11] in-depth teaching on this subject though
[2:13] please view our video called five
[2:15] reasons the rapture is pre tribulation
[2:19] reason number one the Tribulation Period
[2:22] is trouble for Israel the foolish virgin
[2:24] and sinners but not for the bride of
[2:27] Jesus Christ the following scriptures
[2:29] teach this truth
[2:33] reason number two there is no mention of
[2:36] the bride or true church in the
[2:37] tribulation text of the book of
[2:40] Revelation the word church appears 19
[2:43] times in Revelation but is absent from
[2:46] chapter 3 22 to chapter 22 verse 16 the
[2:50] true church is not mentioned in chapter
[2:52] 8 during the first four trumpets nor in
[2:54] Revelation chapter nine in the fifth and
[2:57] sixth trumpets and first world that
[2:59] passes when the second roll passes in
[3:01] revelation 11 the bride is not mentioned
[3:04] during the final harvest of the 144,000
[3:07] Israeli believers in Revelation 14
[3:09] there's again no mention of the Bride of
[3:11] Christ nor is she mentioned in
[3:13] Revelation chapters 15 and 16 when the
[3:16] seven last plagues and seven vials are
[3:18] poured out upon the earth reason number
[3:21] three the bride or true church is
[3:24] promised a pardon from God's divine
[3:26] wrath the following scriptures teach
[3:28] this truth
[3:33] reason number four Jesus thought the
[3:35] rapture was imminent and unknown as an
[3:38] approaching thief while other views such
[3:41] as the mid tribulation or post
[3:43] tribulation view can be numbered or
[3:45] counted the following scriptures teach
[3:47] this truth
[3:52] reason number five the rapture is the
[3:55] removal of the grace of God for the
[3:57] Gentiles in preparation for the
[3:59] revelation of the Antichrist and gods
[4:02] return to the Jewish people the
[4:04] following scriptures teach this truth
[4:06] Luke 21 24 Romans 11 23 to 26 second
[4:11] Thessalonians 2 verses 3 to 12 and
[4:13] Genesis 63
[4:16] [Music]
