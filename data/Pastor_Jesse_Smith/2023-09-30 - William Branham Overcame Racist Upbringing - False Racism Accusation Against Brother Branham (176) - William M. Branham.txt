TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] I was a southerner that light-colored people I met garment and from that time up it changed I love my brethren my colored Brethren I wouldn't be in African around preaching to him but I didn't love them they're God's people the same as we are greetings friends in the mattress name of the Lord Jesus Christ the purpose of this video is to show that God's Prophet brother William Branham was not a racist as some of his critics say and this racism accusation is of course a false accusation an evil slanderous attack upon God's true prophet I want to make a quick disclaimer for this video there's some mature content and terminology and words in this video so it's probably not suitable for children so adults please just listen to it yourself in summary brother Branham admitted he was raised to be a racist he said he was a southerner and didn't like black people but then he said he met God and from that time on he'd been changed I was a southerner that light-colored people and a vision came and told me where to go find it and all those white girls that I went with open out all of them four five stand there said Billy you're not going in there there I said yes I got to go so don't ever ask me for another date it didn't make any difference I meant Garland and from that time up it changed and point back to that time I was changed brother Graham said there's no difference between any race all races are God's children no sir the colored race is all for the same tree that we're off of and every human being the same one that is no different exactly that's right you're a human being just the same creative here by God made us in our colors and he made us the way he wanted us and we're all his children amen absolutely brother random said he loved his black Brethren he said they're God's people the same as we are I love my brethren my colored Brethren I wouldn't be an African around preaching to him but I didn't love them they're God's people the same as we are also it's clear brother Brandon had racial stereotypes his entire life and of course that was a result of being raised by a racist family of course no real believer supports any racial stereotypes today it seems there's a few reasons brother Branham had these stereotypes number one culturally he was raised in that type of environment sadly and then second all humans have some sinful traits that they battle over the course of their entire lives and these sinful traits that we all have as humans are not acceptable yet God has Mercy on each one of us each one of us sin every single day each one of us must rely on the blood of Jesus Christ all men have fallen short of God's glory but if we confess our sins Jesus Christ is faithful and just to forgive us of all unrighteousness I do also acknowledge that some so-called message churches are sinful churches and they could likely be racist of course they are not real Christians if they're racist and these churches should not even be called message churches because they don't obey the bible message that God sent brother Branham to restore and I also feel sorry for some of my brother Brandon's accusers who have left message churches because the message churches they left were sinful churches and were not good examples of message believers they were imposters and not real message believers but it's my hope through videos like mine and other message ministers who are genuine Christians that these accusers of brother Branham can repent of their false accusations and become real Christians and hopefully they will not stereotype all message Believers as sinful people just because the churches they attended that were called message churches were sinful churches here's the outline for the video friends first I'll share my personal experience with race in my childhood and in the message second we'll look at the false accusation against brother Branham about being a racist third we'll look at the presentism fallacy and the Civil Rights era fourth we'll show how brother random grew to love minorities through Jesus's love fifth we'll look at brother random stereotypes and six we'll look at two awful misunderstandings of anti-message leaders I'll begin with my personal experience with race as a child friends I was raised in a white Community I would say it was 99.9 percent White and really my siblings and I were the minorities my mother is Mexican and my father is British and so my Skin's a little darker because the DNA of my mother and I remember in my elementary days I was really dark because I would be in the sun all summer long and one boy in particular called me the n-word and I would go home crying and my dad would try to make me feel better he would call me his only black son and I just had to learn to laugh it off but even to this day it's painful when I think about it that as a minority I was name called mocked and made fun of my brothers and I were even called slang terms for Mexicans which I'm not going to repeat on the video so growing up I felt like a minority and was mistreated on a few occasions but when it came to the message my experience with race and the message has been nearly 100 percent positive after hearing the message in late 2001 I chose to follow a message Pastor who was black in 2002 and then this pastor even ordained me as a preacher and Pastor in 2004 and 2006 respectively and even in our current home church here in Akron Ohio we're a very small church but we have numerous minorities here which we love we have African Asian Believers one Believer from Central America and so we rejoice in the diversity that God has blessed us with in this small Humble Church the only negative I've seen amongst the message churches I've been around is that some people have used stereotypes about minority groups which I do not repeat that stereotype is that a certain race of people can never be on time to church or church functions or other things and that's a sad sinful thing for people to make fun of certain ethnic groups because of their behaviors so I feel sorry for those people I pray those people will repent of their stereotypes and really their pride that exalts himself above other groups second let's look at the false accusation against brother Branham this accusation that brother Branham was racist comes from numerous voices it's come from podcasts videos websites with the false accusation is that brother Branham was quote clearly racist end quote one website says that another podcast said brother random's movement was a political movement and not a religious movement and that brother Brandon was a racist white supremacist and they share their conspiracies theory that brother Branham worked with the KKK and again his movement was political and of course these are all lies these are all false accusations the one podcast in question majored on how racism is this secret some conspiracy theory behind the scenes and message churches that brother random kept a secret he kept it private on the side of course this is a lie this is total presumption about brother Branham but again there might be message churches that are racist but clearly brother Branham was not racist by his own words and by his own actions and remember friends how can we believe men like brother Adam's accusers that have such corrupt fruits I gave this list in part one of my Jim Jones video showing how Jim Jones did not believe brother Ram's bible-based message but these men today that are accusers of brother Branham how can we trust them when they falsely claim brother Brandon plagiarize the Seven Seals yet I've already shown that that accusation is false there's over 38 differences between brother Branham Clarence Larkin and Charles Taze Russell and the Seven Seals and these men will not even address one of my 38 points when they make their rebuttal videos or whatever they just speak their narrative they don't even address the facts that I've laid out they won't even do honest research how can we trust them about this supposed racism accusation we can't trust them second these are people that say God is three persons they willingly add to the Bible with no scripture if they add to the Bible how can we trust them third that they describe their podcasts and videos as juicy showing their love for gossip which is a sin next they say things like Halloween is fun they watch Dracula movies they dress up like Dracula so they admire a blood-sucking fictional fornicator and murderer how can we trust people that enjoy these wicked things also they watch filthy Hollywood movies with cuss words sex scenes murders and more proving their hearts are not clean before God so they cannot be trusted they love the things of the world more than they love the things of God they also frequently misinterpret quotes from Brother Branham like the two at the end of this video they can't even listen with an honest heart how can we trust their research we can't trust their research they also say women can cut their hair despite Paul forbidding it in First Corinthians 11 1-16 and also the entire Bible forbidding it and lastly they say there's only one work of Grace which is a obvious clear lie they're essentially teaching that even a child is filled with the Holy Ghost after saying some scripted sinner's prayer and of course we know those children are not filled with the Holy Ghost they have no fruits that they are filled with the Holy Ghost the Bible says a tree is known by its fruit so we can't trust these type of researchers we can't trust Brothers accusers for these reasons and of course there's many more and friends I'm still praying for them to repent of their sins the presentism fallacy and the Civil Rights era today there's a presentism fallacy among liberals and now in this anti-message group or brother rounds accusers as I call them what is a presentism fallacy Webster's Dictionary defines it as an attitude toward the past dominated by present day attitudes and experiences so we can see presentism in liberals today today's liberals judge the founding fathers of the United States of America by today's cultural standards which is not fair liberals falsely claim the founding fathers hated minorities and approved of slavery of course that's a lie that's not true any honest person knows slavery was a major issue for the founding fathers some of them were born into families that owned slaves and it was illegal to set the slaves free they knew slavery was wrong and were trapped from making an instant change so they work to slowly change the system the founding fathers of the United States were against slavery but had to make gradual steps to end slavery because they needed the support of the southern states to exist as a union remember Thomas Jefferson penned the following the quotation all men are created equal is part of the sentence in the United States Declaration of Independence which Thomas Jefferson penned in 1776 during the beginning of the American Revolution and it reads we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness notice the Constitution purposely calls all men equal because the authors believed all men were equal despite their skin color the second example is Jefferson's work with the Northwest Territory when the Northwest territory was purchased by Congress in the late 1700s it was purposely created without slavery so that's another proof the founding fathers were trying to get rid of slavery getting back to today's liberals in order to show their hypocrisy of this presentism fallacy why aren't liberals fighting modern slavery which is sex trafficking sex trafficking likely has hundreds of thousands of victims if not more why aren't they devoting more of their videos and podcasts and social media accounts to stopping trafficking the fact is they're Wicked sinners and they won't speak out against trafficking because they're probably a part of it and Friends each one of us has to ask ourselves that question what are liberals what are brothers accusers and even myself and the viewers what are we doing to stop slavery today what are we doing to stop sex trafficking today are you speaking out against it are you making monthly donations to organizations who work to set these modern day slaves free what about slave labor in other countries like Nike sweatshops are you supporting companies like Nike or even Walmart and Target that use sweatshops to produce cheap clothes what about the cheap labor that technology companies take advantage of to make the smartphones batteries for electric cars and more and what about some people having biases toward the homeless the poor and the beggars some have The Stereotype or bias that all homeless poor and Beggars are drug addicts but of course that's not true so we can clearly see the hypocrisy of modern liberals who are deceived by the presentism fallacy and now the accusers of the brother Branham have that same deception on them they're judging brother Branham by today's cultural standards which is unfair and of course they're misinterpreting brother Ram's quotes as well the honest fair approach is to put yourself in the person's shoes before making a judgment for example put yourselves in the founding father's shoes what if you were a genuine Christian one of the founding fathers and you're trying to change the culture and end slavery how would you do it if you can be honest and fair to the founding fathers of America then you can be honest and fair to brother Branham put yourself in brother Brandon's shoes what if you were raised in a very racist State like Indiana was and you were raised to be a racist how would you overcome would you overcome the facts are brother random did overcome racism when he became a genuine Christian he was a Holy Ghost Field prophet of God who fulfilled his commission to unite the body of Jesus Christ and he did it in the midst of a volatile Civil Rights era anyone who studied the Civil Rights era knows it was a very violent turbulent time but brother Brandon's bible-based message United all Races together and continues to do that in churches that have the true baptism of the Holy Ghost which we humbly believe our church is one of those examples having Africans Asians Americans Believers from Central America all coming together in one body the blood-bought body of the Lord Jesus Christ and before moving on there's also a criticism of Saint Paul and slavery the presentism fousey also criticizes Saint Paul for not calling for the abolishment of slavery in the Roman culture yet Jesus Christ ordained Paul to preach Jesus's gospel to the Gentiles and then in Romans 2 16 Paul said his gospel would judge all men so it's true Paul did not call for an end to slavery but this doesn't mean Jesus or Paul supported slavery it means god allowed it for a time and season like God has allowed free more agency all throughout human history God even allowed Israel to be in bondage of slavery in Egypt for hundreds of years before The Exodus through Moses friends the Lord God gives the promise that all men will be judged for their free moral agency decisions like Ecclesiastes 11 verse 9. the Bible says o young man know thou that for all these things God will bring thee into judgment second Corinthians 5 10 says for we must all appear before the Judgment seat of Christ that everyone may receive the things done in his body according to that he hath done whether it be good or bad so we can't criticize Paul who did not call for an end of slavery Paul could only preach what Christ called him to preach and it wasn't God's time at that time during Paul's life to end slavery but Paul gave the servants inspired words from Jesus Christ in First Corinthians 7 21 Paul said art thou call being a servant cared not for it but if thou mayest be made free use it rather for he that is called in the Lord being a servant it is the Lord's free man likewise also he that is called being free as Christ's servant so Paul by the leading of the Holy Spirit told the servants to not care for the fact that they were servants but if they could be made free use it for the glory of God and then in Colossians 3 22 Paul told servants to obey in all things your Masters according to the flesh fearing God and he told them whatsoever you do do it heartily as to the Lord and not to men and then he promised in Colossians 3 24 they would receive the reward of The Inheritance because they truly serve the Lord Christ remember in chapter 4 of Colossians Paul told the Masters be fair to your servants because you have a master in heaven so in Paul's gospel everyone was accountable the Masters were accountable to God the Masters had to treat their servants well and the servants had to work for the Masters like they were working for the Lord so as Bible Believers and Bible readers we have to accept that God allowed slavery God allows men to make their free moral agency and they'll be judged for the evil that they do you have to recognize Jesus did not call Paul to end slavery that was going to come later Paul's mission was to write the majority of the New Testament and as the Bible said he was to turn many from Darkness to the light of Jesus Christ The Gospel of Jesus Christ next we'll show how brother random grew to love minorities through Jesus's love this first quote is what I mentioned earlier from that time 1960 this shows the humility of brother Branham to admit to the listeners that he was raised in a racist environment but the blood of Jesus Christ changed him this should make us think more of brother Branham and his Godly character so you'll hear Brother Branham say I was a southerner and didn't like colored people but I met God and from that time I've Been Changed let's listen to the quote I want you to get this and don't you never let it pass from you what if a man's ever stood on that sacred Sands at the back side of the desert when he meets God face to face there's not enough Devils at all hell to take that away from him he knows he that God he knows he had an experience he talked to God regardless of what the opposition is he can say from that time something changed to me nice how well I can call the time hello Saloon that have been used as a church where some colored people was preaching the gospel I was a southerner and at light-colored people and a vision came and told me where to go find it and all the white girls that I've went with no 1145 stand there said Billy you're not going in there there I said yes I got to go so don't ever ask me for another date it didn't make any difference and from that time up it changed and point back to that time I was changed no man has a right before it until he's got an experience no matter what the intellectuals can say you know you met God in the next quote from serpent C 1958 brother Ram said blacks were just as much human as white brother random quoted acts 17 26 while Iran said the black man is your brother he's the same acts 17 26 says hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the Earth and have to determine the times before appointed and the bounds of their inhabitation brother Branham stands up for minorities in this quote and said they're just as much human as the white people are let's listen to the quote in such a way someone said to me said they're nothing but animals and I said I beg your pardon they're just as much human As You Are maybe a little more let me tell you when you got that kind of an attitude you're getting back towards an animal I said that man of he's as black as the Ace of Spades or visas yellow as a pumpkin or if he's as blue his name he go he might save your life by giving you a blood transfusion but don't you never put an animal's blood in you certainly he's a human it's because one skin was black and the other Brown another uh yellow in the other and white that has nothing to do with it the Bible said God of one blood made all man that's exactly right the places we lived in changing our colors had nothing to do with it God made it one one man All Nations one blood All Nations the same the Chinese the colored man can't say enough the black man can't say no that that Chinese he's y'all ain't gonna have nothing to do with him he's your brother and you white men can't say to the yellow man or the black man either one I have nothing to do with you he's your brother exactly right the next quote the greatest battle ever fought brother Branham says we don't have any lines of color the family of God doesn't draw lines of color we're all Brothers and Sisters in Christ and he says he missed his black sister who had just passed away sister Bell let's listen to the quote and I'm sure that sister Belle loved our Lord amen she was a good woman now she's one of us and here we don't have any lines of color the family of God doesn't draw lines of color whether we're red brown black or yellow it doesn't matter white whatever it is we are Brothers and Sisters in Christ and so we we love her and we'll miss her the Tabernacle how will I miss sister Bell's that great big course a man back there in the corner and taking her up home should talk about the Lord Jesus the next quote questions and answers on Genesis 53 brother random stood up to say blacks are human brother Graham said blacks are off the same tree we are the same tree and there's no difference let's listen to the quote now it's been it's been a hope that my colored friends it's in here will excuse this remark because it's absolutely not right the first time I ever met anyone in my life uh after I've been converted I was met brother George D Arc and now I'm down there and I was walked in the Lord led me to a little place that is disgusting for the colored man came from and they were trying to say that the colored man that Cain married an animal like an eight and through there come forth the colored Rays now that's wrong absolutely that's wrong and don't never stand for that because there was no colored or white or any other differences Just One race of people into the flood that adds a flood and Tower of Babel when they begin to scatter out that's when they're taking their colors and so forth they're all come from the same tree that's exactly right Adam and Eve was the father and mother Earthly of every living creature of human beings that's ever been on the Earth that's right black white pale Brown yellow whatever color you might be that's absolutely the place that you live in again any questions and answers on Hebrews part 3 1957 brother random stood up to say blacks are human God made us in our colors and were all his children let's listen to the quote the way he wanted us and we're all his children amen absolutely amen and the art to fuss and carry on like that amen that's wrong to do that they shouldn't do it next in oh Lord just once more 1963 brother random called blacks his Brethren that he loved he said they are God's people the same as we are let's listen to the quote I love my brethren my colored Brethren I wouldn't be in African around preaching to him but I didn't love him they're God's people the same as we are the Bible said of one blood God created All Nations we're all Brothers through the bloodstreet a colored man to give a white man a blood transfusion or vice versa now a white man can give the Japanese yellow man or the Indian the Red Man or want more or Japan or whatever he could give him a blood transfusion cause we're all the same blood the color of her skin where we live had nothing to do with it we're all human beings we all come from God God by one blood made all nations amen a colored man can give me a blood transfusion his blood's just the same as mine is mine says I give him one who am I to argue he's my brother in that same sermon oh Lord just once more brother random said slavery was never God's program God made man but man-made slaves brother random said we're to live together in unity and peace let's listen to the quote but back in the slave time they were selling slaves human beings like an auction block like they would have used car lot there's a buyer come forth through the country you need to buy them up and go sell them and make money on them just like you would on a used car or something never was God's program God made man man made slaves one's not to rule over the other or to live together in unity and peace in 1964 questions and answers part four brother Branham said blacks have souls he said they're my brothers and sisters and some of the finest people I ever met brother Branham called them precious people he said skin color means no difference to a born-again Christian Amen to that let's listen to the quote how can we find the will of the Lord or our home do should we move our home to Jeffersonville Indiana can a person be a Christian and dislike a colored people does God not want them to be uh treated like us cause they are dark in color would you what do you suggest in this do you believe in integration or segregation I believe in integration I believe that a man no matter what his color is or who he is he's a man just like I am it's exactly now I believe if they just leave those colored people alone and them Communists didn't get out there and Inspire them now they wanted now the real genuine colored people there's a genuine bunch of born-again Godly Saints and then people yes indeedy just because my skin is white and there's dark that don't mean one thing to me he's my brother if he's in Christ that's why different with the apricots message they didn't believe and believe those people had a soul that's what got me disliked there I said that man's a man is same as I am he's got the rights to the same privilege that I have his skin don't mean no difference to me or no other man is Born Again of the spirit of God but I said if they'd let those colored people alone there never would have been this as far and I said for Miss Pulpit we have lots of colored people that come here I don't think there's any here tonight but we have lots of colored people that come here to this church brother they're as welcome as anybody else is there are my brothers and sisters some of the finest people I've ever met in my life is some of them colored people then there's some of them that's Renegades just exactly like the white people or the yellow people or the brown people yes indeed again in questions and answers part 464 brother random was ashamed of people that were against integration he said Born Again people believe blacks and whites are all the same let's listen to the quote and do you people don't believe in integration be ashamed of you our nation permits integration and we should do what the big boss says do it's exactly right and now say not to come in places and so forth like that or shop and they're set in the back of the bus and so forth no sir the law says they're just the same as we are so we're same as they are so let's act that way let's be that way and that's exactly what all really true born-again people believe again in questions answers part 4 64. brother Branham believed all men are born equal let's listen to the quote I never had such a feeling for people as I have now poor people in Africa the way they were treated and I do not believe in that stuff I'm a southerner I was born across the river honor but I'm like Abraham Lincoln I come yearly calls I believe that men were born equal that's right and I do not believe in separating people and things like that when that people baptized with the Holy Ghost and so forth and again in that same sermon questions answers part 4 64. brother Ram said the blacks who are born again are precious Souls who are born again of the spirit of God let's listen to the quote to prove my porn is clear after they have integration they have it now legally lawfully they're causing more trouble now than if the first place see it shows that it is communism and not them precious Souls that's born to the spirit of God next let's look at brother branham's stereotypes first let's define a stereotype a stereotype is a conventional formulaic and oversimplified conception opinion or image so basically a stereotype is an opinion that's incomplete so I want to say stereotypes are never right stereotypes if not confessed are still sins like Pride like mocking others or making fun of others and one simple example is Saint Peter from The Book of Galatians chapter 2. here we have a Bible precedent of a holy ghost-filled man a man with the keys to the kingdom of God battling racism due to fear of his Jewish brethren in Galatians 2 verses 11 through 14 Paul blamed Peter for isolating himself as a Jew from the Gentiles and Paul withstood him to his face because he was to be blamed and Paul said that Peter walked not uprightly according to the truth of the Gospel and the Bible said Peter separate himself from the Gentiles because of fear fear of his Jewish brethren so friends Peter was Holy Ghost filled according to Acts chapter 2 but yet he struggled with segregation and it's recorded in the scripture a similar truth can be about brother random struggling with racial issues or stereotypes in the Civil Rights era and friends I don't want to repeat some of the stereotype words and phrases that brother random used I don't think it's necessary I don't think it'll be beneficial or edifying to anyone and I believe brother Ram's accusers wouldn't want their stereotypes or their sins repeated publicly and shared before everybody so that's why I'm not going to do that to brother Branham so to summarize this section it's clear brother Branham had stereotypes of course they were shaped by his culture and the social norms of those times but clearly as I showed through the other quotes brother random loved his black Brethren and he named all the different skin colors saying we're all God's children we're all one body the body of Jesus Christ and friends let's not judge brother Branham because we all have opinions that are not complete for my viewers watching this video who would be foolish enough to say his or her conception on every single issue is perfect I'm sure none of us would claim that that every one of our opinions especially about sensitive topics are perfect and complete the reality of it is is that we all fall short of God's glory in some way or another so let's avoid getting into the presentism fallacy by judging brother Branham based upon today's cultural norms and standards let your grace to brother Branham just like we'd want someone to show Grace To Us despite our stereotypes because it's true everybody has some stereotype everybody has some opinion that's not complete there's no perfect person except the Lord Jesus Christ now let's look at two awful misunderstandings of brother Ram's accusers the first one is the blood boil misunderstanding and the second misunderstanding is that brother Branham was a segregationalist so the first awful misunderstanding is from one of Brothers accusers it's from the sermon oh Lord just once more 1963 June 28th in the morning service brother Brandon was speaking about integration between black and white schools and brother Branham said quote so they don't need those things end quote in this statement my brother Branham was completely taken out of context by Warner Brothers accusers on a podcast the accuser was trying to say that brother Branham was saying black people don't need schools swimming pools and so forth brother Ram's accuser was trying to say that brother Branham didn't think blacks deserved anything and of course that's a lie if you listen to the context which we will in a few moments brother Brandon was saying the blacks with better schools did not need to go to the white schools because they already had Better Built schools they already had modern schools and brother Brown was telling this story he said of an old black brother who stood up that morning in a riot and he said there look at our schools they got swimming pools they got better schools and everything why do we want to go to their schools end quote so brother Ram said there was a riot and a black man stood up and said why do we want to go to the white schools we've already got better schools than what they have and so then brother Rams said God's got a variety brother random gave a stereotype he said a white man is always stewing and worrying a colored man is satisfied in the state he's in so they don't need those things of course no real believer supports any racial stereotypes today so let me State clearly brother Brandon was quoting an old black man who said our black community already has swimming pools we already have better schools than the whites why do we want to go to their schools and then brother Branham said that group of black people they don't need those things they didn't need a better school they already had good schools so brother man was not being racist in that context he was saying that black community already had better schools than the white community so they didn't actually need to go to the white schools if it was just about facilities let's listen to the quote there remember that old colored brother standing up that morning in that Rod yes the militia if he could speak he said I never was ashamed of being a black man mom maker made me a black man but this morning I'm ashamed the way my race is acted what's them people doing to us only been good to us a white woman raised up and said I don't want my children in school by a white woman said because they she won't pay the the interest take interest in my children like a colored woman was in my own race said they're so look at our schools they got swimming pools they got better schools and everything why do we want to go to their schools that's right I believe God is a God of of well I'd say he's a god of variety he makes big mountains and little mountains he makes deserts he makes for us he makes white man black man red man we should never cross that up and becomes a hybrid and anything hybrid cannot re-breed itself you're a ruining the race of people there's some things about a colored man that a white man don't even possess them tree a white man's always stewing and wearing a color man satisfied in the state he's in though they don't need those things the second awful misunderstanding is a quote from doors and door February 6 1965 one of Brothers accusers on his website said that brother Branham taught you were not a Christian unless you believed in racial segregation and of course this is a lie this shows the cognitive dissonance of brother Adam's accuser he can't even honestly listen to a quote from Brother Branham without putting his false narrative or his false interpretation on the quote so in the quote brother Brandon is talking about how God always separates his people from unclean things he talked about how God pulled Israel out of all the races of the world because God is a segregationalist and brother Brandon says I don't believe one should rule over other any race color or anything so brother Ram clearly says he's not for slavery notice brother Graham said you cannot be a Christian and be an integrationist but if you keep listening brother was talking about integrating with sin Christians cannot allow sin to come into their lives or come into their churches he's not talking about racial integration he's talking about churches should not integrate with sin and then Brothers says but there is a segregation the bride of Christ is segregated from the rest of the churches that's exactly right Church natural and the church Spiritual Church carnal and the Church of the word so brother Branham was referring to the Bride of Jesus Christ that she is spiritually segregated from sin and denominations proven by the context of brother Ram's quote which brother Ram's accuser ignored and then brother Ram's accuser ignored the scripture brother Branham used he said it has always been Jesus came to his own his own received and not but as many as received him so brother man shows how Jesus was rejected by the Jews so Jesus had to be segregated with the Believers his little group who followed him that's the segregation Brothers talking about segregating oneself away from sin into the true group of Believers brother man was not talking about racial segregation let's listen to the quote I am an integrationist absolutely I mean a segregationist I am a segregationist because I don't care how much they argue you cannot be a Christian to be an immigration that's exactly right God even separates his Nations he separates these people come out from among them he's a he is a segregationist don't even touch not through unclean things he pulled Israel uh the Jewish race out of every all the races of the world he is a segregationist but I don't believe that any man is to be a Slave God made man man made slaves I know what he wants to drool over are there any race color or anything but there is a segregation the bride of Christ is segregated from the rest of the churches that's exactly right Church National a church spiritual Church carnal the church the word it always has been Jesus came to his own his own received enough but as many has received him old Abraham Lincoln stuck that under his head his head on his arm like that he said that's wrong someday uh get that if it cost my life in the honored a museum in Chicago lays a dress with the blood on it freed that negro from that I see that sin and things is wrong God help me to get it and all other ministers of the Gospel we are born free children of God we have no business for any Creed or to run us into a world Council of churches we are free of our man in the Holy Ghost we have a right we come out of such stuff is that to be pinnacle right now we are free we don't have to be bound down to those things again and friends I could give many other awful misinterpretations of brother Adam's quote from Brother random's accusers for example I made a video a couple years ago brother Ram's accuser claimed brother Brandon pretended to speak in tongues I made a video showing how the accuser misunderstood brother Graham's quote I sent it to the brother and he never even acknowledged that he got it and I've sent it to a couple different Brothers in his group and they won't even respond to it they won't even acknowledge that they're wrong so how can we help people when they won't even allow themselves to be helped all we can do is pray for their genuine repentance for other brands accusers just continue to make lies all these false accusations it's incredibly sad so we must stand for the truth declare the truth and pray for their repentance in closing friends I hope this video has been a blessing I try to keep it a little shorter on purpose so I could get it out a little earlier by the grace of God perhaps I can make a follow-up video If people have good comments or questions or Bible verses in the comments section below and of course I'm always open to correction friends if I said anything wrong please forgive me I believe I'm a holy ghost filled Christian doing the best I can to rightly divide the word of Truth and with a sensitive subject like this I just asked the Lord to give me Grace to show brother random was not a racist Brotherhood loved all the races all the skin colors because he was a holy ghost-filled Christian and again friends after studying this subject I think more brother random than I did before he was able to Humble himself and admit he was raised to be racist but he overcame it he was changed by the Holy Spirit and I love how he quoted numerous Bible verses about how all men are created equal all men are created by God such as acts 17 verse 26. so I'll end with that scripture and hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the Earth and have determined the times before appointed and the bounds of their habitation God is made of one blood all nations of men to dwell on this Earth and may those of us who claim to be baptized with the Holy Ghost may we go forth from this moment and show the love of Jesus Christ to every skin color Every Nation every Kindred tribe and tongue may we show them the love of Jesus Christ just like brother Branham did if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me God bless you and may Jesus Christ be the desire of your heart foreign
