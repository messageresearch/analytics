TRANSCRIPT
========================================
He said there was a test of a prophet. If a prophet prophesied and that what he said come to pass then hear him. There must have been some of them tape boys or somebody slipped into the place down there and played some tapes to him or something other played some tapes to him or something other and found the predestinated. &gt;&gt; Greetings friends [music] in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Is it true that you can't have the token unless [music] you play tapes? I believe the answer is no, as I'm sure you probably [music] guessed. So, we want to look at that today by the grace of God. Recently, there [music] was a blog post put on Brandom Tabernacle's website from October 5th, 2025 [music] where the pastor of Brandom Tabernacle states specifically that he doesn't believe [music] believers can have the token unless they play the tapes. This is false doctrine. I believe this is a doctrine of the nicicoatans. [music] So, let's start by reading the blog post and then we'll share the truth of the matter afterwards. [music] So, here's a screenshot of the blog post and I'll pick up reading towards the end of the blog post. It says, "You've heard many ministers make excuses about playing the tapes, but most all say the prophet never said play the tapes in the church." Now, that is true. Brother Bram never said, "Play the tapes in the church and stop preaching full-time." So that's not an excuse. That's the truth. The truth is, Brother Ram never said, "Change the five-fold ministry in any way." So, of course, this man is deceived. He's majoring on a minor, as we'll see next here by God's grace. But the next statement says, quote, "The prophet said, Rahab made her home a church, and her church played the tapes. And because she played the tapes in her church, her and all her tape church were under the token and saved. Every other church perished. End quote. So there's some things you have to break down in this quote. First thing is, Brother Ram never said the words tape church in a phrase. You can go ahead and look it up. You can go ahead type it into any search engine of William Brandham sermons. He never said the words tape church together. There is no such thing as a tape church. That's a fabrication of man. That's a tradition of man as Jesus said in Matthew 15. And Jesus said they worship in vain based upon the traditions of man. The doctrines of man, man-made dogmas, man-made traditions. So let's look exactly at what brother Brandham said in the token. This is from September 1st, 1963. The first time brother Brandham preached the token message. And it's so sad. You know, Brandham Tabernacle majors on one paragraph. It's literally three sentences. And because of their false doctrine and their seducing spirits of the deity spirit, they use this one paragraph of three sentences to change everything about the five-fold ministry because they're led by the deity spirit. Anyways, here's what brother Bram said. But there must have been some tape boys slipped in somewhere for the predestinated seed. They slipped over to her house and played some tapes. She made her her own house a church to receive the message. End quote. So yes, I can agree with this quote. I understand what Brother Bam's saying. But nowhere before this or after this quote or any other quote in the next 2 years and 3 months of brother Ram's life did brother Ram ever say we need to change everything about the five-fold ministry. Preachers need to sit down and shut up or be quiet, however you want to say it, and just play my tapes. Brother Bram never said that. So, Brandham Tabernacle is not really saying what Brother Random said. Now, if you go listen to the second time brother Rand preached the token in Bakersfield, California, February 8th, 1964. Brother Ram says, quote, "There must have been some of them tape boys or or somebody slipped into that place down there and played some tapes to them or something another and found the predestinated." So, Brother Bram leaves it open. He said tape boys or somebody. So, that doesn't mean it was tape boys. It could have been tape boys or it could have been preachers. And then he said played some tapes to them or something another. So, brother Ram said it could have been playing tapes, but it could have not have been playing tapes because he said it could have been something other than playing tapes. So, again, random tabernacle is majoring on a minor. They're creating their own man-made dogma. And notice in either sermons, token from September 63 or token, February 1964, brother never said, "Thus sayeth the Lord, I'm changing the five-fold ministry. I want the preachers to sit down and just press play." The tape worshippers are under a strong delusion. As the Bible says, they are under a seducing spirit. So, is Brandon Tabernacle correctly interpreting Brother Ram's message? Of course not. There are so many other quotes they're noring. What about the quote in 1963 questions and answers on the seals? Brother Ram specifically asked, should evangelists continue on the field in this hour? Of course, what they mean? Certainly, by all means, don't change a thing. So, Brother Ram says, do not change a thing with evangelists yet. What do evangelists do today for tape boys? I don't even think they have evangelists. I think they just have people that give out their agapo tablets and just say press, play, and obey. That's different than the evangelist in brother Bram's day. So, Brandon Tabernacle has changed many things. When brother Ram said, don't change a thing. Notice what brother Ram said. If Jesus is coming in the morning, preach today like it was going to be 10 years from today, but live like it's going to be at this hour. Brother Ram didn't say press play like it's going to be 10 years from today. He said, "Preach." And he said, "Don't don't get scrupled up now. That's why I'm trying to warn you about, see, just don't be odd, pecure, don't change nothing, but for doing something wrong, like pressing play and disobeying or doing evil, repent. See, come back to God. Continue on your evangelistic service just as you always did." And remember friends, there are six quotes where Brother Ram says, "Preach until Jesus returns." I got a video about that I put out recently. He said the five-fold ministry is in the church until he comes again. And then he said, "Preaching the gospel until he returns again in glory." Amen. He said he commissioned human beings to preach the gospel until he returns as a sign. He said, "Show signs and wonders of healing and salvation until he returns again. Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature to all the world. And when this gospel is gone to all the world, then I will return." And we could go on and on and on, but I'll stop right there by God's grace. Now, let's look at the blog post again. It says, quote, "Brothers and sisters, please, I'm not saying a pastor cannot preach this message or it's wrong if he does." End quote. Now, the pastor likes to play both sides. But you can't do that because you're contradicting yourself. I have other videos where this pastor says, "We're make believers if we don't press play and obey, and we're deemists if we don't press play and obey." So clearly in his eyes, it's wrong if you don't play tapes. But here he says it's not. So this pastor's message changes constantly. Let's keep reading. Quote, "In my own way, I'm preaching now through this letter, but open your heart and listen to what the prophet is saying and warning you about. If your pastor is not or will not play the tapes in your church by making some kind of excuse, whatever it might be, according to the word." And I'm going to stop right there. End quote. No, the Bible never says preachers will stop preaching in the five-fold ministry and sit down and just press play. That's not what the word says. So, let's pick it up again. Quote, "According to the word, no matter how much he says, I believe the message of the hour." According to what I believe the word says, the token, the message of the hour is not being applied. End quote. So, I like this honesty from the pastor. The pastor is being honest. He's saying according to what I believe the word says. And of course, his belief is wrong. He has a false belief. There is no Bible verse that says preachers will stop preaching before the coming of the Lord and start tape churches and isolate themselves and neglect their preaching gifts. There is no scripture that says that. But at least the pastor's honest and he says he doesn't believe a preacher can have the token applied. That's fine. But that's what I believe about this pastor and any pastor that will sit down and neglect their preaching gifts. How can they be born again and neglect the very gift that God ordained for their life to preach the gospel? He ordained it before the foundation of the world. How can a disobedient, rebellious, neglectful man be born again who will not preach the gospel? I don't believe he can either. And remember, brother Ram said, "Every teaching must go from Genesis to Revelation." You cannot take the false doctrine of press and obey from Genesis to Revelation. But as my one video showed about King Ahaz, you can show shutting down churches as the antichrist spirit and not attending church physically as the antichrist spirit. We see in the days of Ahaz, they closed the church doors. That's what Brandham tabernacle has done. The Bible said in first John, they went out from us because they're not of us. So all these tape worshippers have left true churches that have living gospel preachers standing behind the pulpit preaching the gospel. So you can take that from Genesis to Revelation about the tape worshippers leaving true churches, closing church doors. That's the Antichrist spirit. And again, as I said earlier, this started out as a deed of the Nicicoatans. It was just a saying. Well, maybe we should just stop preaching and just press play and obey. Now it's become a doctrine. Now since 2015 when Brandham Tabernacle got a new pastor, now it's their main doctrine. And imagine they haven't gathered physically in church since 2020. March of 2020. What a shame. Now, someone called me a liar who was a tape boy on one of these comments and they said, "Oh, no. We do gather for a one-hour prayer meeting on Wednesday nights." And I'd forgotten about that. So, I guess it is true that they do have prayer meeting on Wednesday night for 1 hour, but it's a silent prayer meeting. No singing. And please correct me if I'm wrong. Does that in any way resemble the services that William Brandham held during his time as pastor of Brandham Tabernacle? The answer is a resounding and obvious no. The tape church worship movement has changed the gospel of Jesus Christ. They're taking away from the gospel. There are awful repercussions for that. May God have mercy on their souls. I hope by making these videos someone, just one, maybe two, maybe more will repent of their idolatry of William Brandham, repent of their doctrines, the nicladens, and return to the gospel truth of living preachers preaching the living word of God. So, if you know someone who is deceived in the tape church movement and they're open to more truth, please pray and share this video and the other videos about these topics with them by the grace of God. You might want to start with the video about is Joseph Brandham a prophet. Brother Ram said a prophet has to pass quote the test of a prophet end quote. Look it up. These tape worshippers don't even know that quote. They don't even know every prophet has to be tested according to Deuteronomy chapter 18. They have to foretell something in the name of the Lord and it comes to pass. Joseph has never done that. Now, he still has time to do it, but he's getting older. He's 70. But they cannot call Joseph a prophet unless he passes the test of a prophet according to Deuteronomy 18 and brother Brandham. Because brother Ram's just echoing Deuteronomy 18. So tape worshippers ignore so many quotes. They don't even apply what brother Brandham said. Brother Brandham said, "A prophet is to be tested, the test of a prophet." Also, friends, I have a playlist of videos about the evils and the false doctrines of Brandom Tabernacle. I think there's 13 or 14 videos on there. I would encourage you to go watch those. They're filled with quotes from Brother Brandham that show the folly of the current Brandom Tabernacle, their false doctrine, their lies, their deception, their strong delusion, their deity spirit. And all these tape boys that make comments on my videos, they never address those truths that I'm pointing out. They just name call me. They call me Kane. They call me Janice and Jambbras. All this nonsense. And I try to say, "Can you just address one of these statements, one of my claims on the video, and they won't address them. They won't address about women having sperm," Brother Brandham said. And yet they still say, "Every word on tape is thus sayith the Lord." They won't address how Brother Brandham said, "I don't think I have anything to do with that seventh church age messenger." And yet they still say every word is thus sayith the Lord. They won't even answer simple questions. When I asked the pastor Brandon Tabernacle in an email, does the third person of the trinity dwell in your heart? As brother Ram said in 1952, he just said something simple like I believe every word that the prophet told us or something like that. Something general like that. So that's what a deity spirit does. It deceives you, makes you blinded to the truth. You can't even recognize truth and error. You have no discernment. You've neglected your gift if you even had a gift. But the Bible says the Holy Ghost searches the deep things of God. Yay. the deep things of God. The Bible says the Holy Ghost, Jesus said, will guide you into all truth. So, they're in a sad spiritual condition, but thank God for the Holy Ghost leading and guiding us into all truth by the grace of God. Looking back at that playlist again, please consider watching the seven false teachings of the Jeffersonville tape church movement. Not every word William Brandham said was thus say the Lord. William Brandham's absolute was Jesus Christ, not his tapes. The token is the Holy Ghost baptism, not the tapes. That one most applies to this video. Tape boys are not part of the five-fold ministry. 80 plus proofs the tapes of William Brandham have mistakes yet he's a true prophet. Awfulist cult won't work or go to church. Five parallels with Brandham Tabernacle and King Ahaz and love letter discerning lies of Brandham Tabernacle's blog post and of course this video relates to that one as well. So in closing friends hope this video is a blessing by the grace of God. Friends it's so important to stay with the word of God. But Ram said he loved the Bible. He believed every word in the Bible was thus sayeth the Lord. And it's only the devil who's trying to get our eyes off the Bible and focus on anything else. And in this case, Brennham Tabernacles got their eyes off the Bible and they're focusing on paragraph 299 of the token message. September 1st, 1963, and they're straining at a net and swallowing a camel. They're worshiping the messenger instead of the message. And they're creating their own false doctrine based upon three sentences. And based upon those three sentences, they're throwing out the entire New Testament, the entire Old Testament, because they all had living preachers. And they don't even realize they're setting up the image, like Nebuchadnezzar set up of his God, Daniel. They're the one setting up the image of their God, William Brandham, and his tapes. It's so sad, but let's pray for them. Father God, in the name of Jesus Christ, I pray you be merciful to these tape worshippers. God, let your Holy Spirit continue to deal with them. All those that can be helped or saved. And I pray you would help them in the name of Jesus Christ. Use this video, other videos like this by other preachers, anyone who has a true heart, a true desire for the Holy Ghost gospel, the true token, the baptism of the Holy Ghost that will agree and say amen to every word of God. It will feed on every word in the Bible. The Holy Ghost can only feed on the word of God. Help these idolattors, these deceived ones, these seduced ones to repent of their idolatry. I ask it in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. If you have any questions, [music] concerns, or testimonies about this video, please contact me. God bless you and may Jesus [music] Christ be the desire of your heart. I'm very happy to be here this afternoon and again in defense of the gospel of Jesus Christ to bring the good tidings, the good news that Jesus raised from the dead, living among man today, his church. The same Jesus that was yesterday will be today and forever. He never failed.
