[0:09] greetings in Jesus Christ's name praise
[0:12] the name of the Lord God's message of
[0:14] the hour has come to akan the message of
[0:17] the hour is the prophecies and Promises
[0:19] from the Bible that God is fulfilling
[0:21] today right now God's message for
[0:24] Christians today can be summarized in
[0:27] three words restore reveal and Rapture
[0:31] before judgment strikes the Earth in a
[0:33] moment we'll expound on the scriptural
[0:35] prophecies and promises that teach us
[0:38] about our message of restoration
[0:40] Revelation and Rapture but first let's
[0:43] look at some Messengers God has sent in
[0:46] the past who had to preach the message
[0:48] of the hour to the generations in which
[0:50] they
[0:51] [Music]
[0:55] lived Noah's message for his hour was
[0:58] something similar to this repent and get
[1:01] inside the Ark of Salvation for God is
[1:03] going to destroy the Earth with a flood
[1:05] because of the continual wickedness of
[1:07] every man's heart Moses's message for
[1:10] his day sounded like this apply the
[1:13] token of the blood of the Lamb to your
[1:15] house for God has taking his Covenant
[1:17] people out of Egypt with a mighty hand
[1:20] and Into the Wilderness to prove them
[1:22] God wants his people to possess their
[1:24] Promised Land John the Baptist had the
[1:27] message of his hour saying repent and
[1:29] and be baptized and prepare the way for
[1:32] the Lord the
[1:34] Messiah our blessed savior Jesus Christ
[1:37] had the message of his hour saying I
[1:39] will be delivered into the hands of men
[1:41] to be crucified for the sins of the
[1:43] whole world but I will rise on the third
[1:45] day for your
[1:47] justification after he arose his message
[1:50] was receive ye the Holy Ghost T in
[1:53] Jerusalem until you are endued with
[1:55] power from on
[1:56] high next on the day of Pentecost St pet
[1:59] pet began preaching the message of his
[2:01] hour which was the coming and filling of
[2:03] the Holy Ghost to the Jews first and
[2:06] then the Gentiles now for 2,000 years
[2:09] God has sent messenger after Messenger
[2:12] to prepare the people to live the
[2:14] promises of their day the promises God
[2:16] wanted to fulfill in their lifetimes and
[2:19] in their
[2:20] Generations the most recent Messengers
[2:23] may be men and movements you are
[2:25] familiar with Martin Luther who lived
[2:27] during the 16th century preached the
[2:30] message of his hour which was the just
[2:32] shall live by
[2:34] faith in the 18th century God used a man
[2:37] by the name of John Wesley to Proclaim
[2:39] his message of the hour which was
[2:42] sanctification have Holiness of heart
[2:44] and life the next message of the hour
[2:47] was preached by William Seymour during
[2:49] the isua Street Revival of 1906 the
[2:52] message of that hour was the gifts of
[2:55] the Holy Ghost are returning such as
[2:57] speaking in tongues prophecy and the the
[3:00] rest of the gifts of the Spirit spoken
[3:01] of in 1 Corinthians
[3:04] 12 God proved each of these moves to be
[3:07] genuine as Millions have experienced the
[3:09] power of God through Luther's
[3:11] justification by faith Wesley's
[3:13] sanctification of the spirit and
[3:15] Seymour's preaching on the gifts of the
[3:17] holy spirit but God wanted to restore
[3:19] more he wanted to restore the true
[3:22] baptism of the Holy Ghost experience
[3:24] that leads us up to today's message
[3:28] [Music]
[3:31] God's message for this hour is to
[3:33] restore reveal and then Rapture the
[3:36] Bride of Jesus Christ let's look at the
[3:38] bible promises for our
[3:40] message first God promised in the
[3:43] following scriptures to restore all
[3:45] things his church had lost or forfeited
[3:48] over the last 2,000 years since the
[3:50] church began on the day of
[3:52] Pentecost acts 3:
[3:55] 21-22 teaches that Jesus will be in
[3:57] heaven until all things are restored
[4:00] Jesus prophesied in Matthew 17:11 that
[4:03] Elijah would come first and restore all
[4:06] things Malachi 4 5 and 6 teaches that
[4:09] this same Elijah Spirit upon a prophet
[4:12] would turn the hearts of the children
[4:14] back to the hearts of the fathers before
[4:16] Jesus returns the Lord willing we will
[4:18] soon share a video about the Elijah
[4:20] messenger of our day who Faithfully
[4:22] preached our message of restoration
[4:25] Revelation and rapture we can see from
[4:28] these scriptures that that God wants to
[4:30] restore the hearts of the Christians
[4:32] back to the same condition of the hearts
[4:34] of our Pentecostal fathers from the book
[4:36] of Acts when the New Testament Church
[4:38] was born with the right heart we will
[4:41] finish the Great Commission that the
[4:42] early church started we will also have
[4:45] completely surrendered Hearts to God
[4:47] that want to obey every word of God the
[4:50] heart of Jesus's bride will want to talk
[4:53] holy think holy dress holy and live holy
[4:56] in every way just like the early church
[5:00] next God promised to reveal all the
[5:03] mysteries of the Bible before the second
[5:05] coming of Jesus Christ in the following
[5:07] scriptures Revelation 10:7 says that the
[5:10] mystery of God will be finished by a
[5:12] seventh angel who receives the Open
[5:14] Bible from Christ The Mighty
[5:16] Angel Amos 3:7 says that God will reveal
[5:20] his Secrets through prophets and we know
[5:22] from the previous scriptures that this
[5:24] Prophet will have the Elijah
[5:26] anointing some of these Mysteries which
[5:29] must be revealed today include the Seven
[5:31] Seals and the Seven
[5:33] Stars the
[5:35] godhead mystery Babylon and the
[5:38] Antichrist the mystery of iniquity the
[5:42] Rapture Israel's blindness during the
[5:45] church
[5:46] age the New Testament Church as the
[5:48] bride of
[5:49] Christ and marriage and divorce just to
[5:52] name a few we pray that you'll want to
[5:56] understand all these Mysteries as Jesus
[5:58] told us it is given to you to know the
[6:00] mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but
[6:02] to them it is not
[6:05] given finally God promised to Rapture
[6:08] his bride or Spirit-filled New Testament
[6:11] Church Jesus taught Parables about his
[6:14] second coming and likened it unto a
[6:16] wedding Jesus is called the bridegroom
[6:18] and his church is called the
[6:21] bride Jesus is returning to Rapture or
[6:24] catch away his bride off the Earth
[6:26] before the horrible tribulation period
[6:29] Jesus's bride will make herself ready by
[6:31] letting Jesus wash her with the water of
[6:34] his
[6:35] word in The Parables Jesus told there
[6:38] were symbols used to help us understand
[6:41] what was required for bride Believers to
[6:44] be made ready for the Rapture one symbol
[6:46] was oil as the wise virgins had oil
[6:49] ready in their vessels and so they could
[6:51] go in with the bridegroom to the wedding
[6:54] the five foolish virgins did not have
[6:56] this oil so they could not be a part of
[6:58] the rapture or wedding of the
[7:01] Lamb another symbol was the wedding
[7:03] garment from Matthew 22
[7:06] 1-14 which represents the righteousness
[7:08] of saints which the Bride of Jesus will
[7:11] wear this wedding garment shows that the
[7:13] bride has accepted the righteousness of
[7:15] Jesus's works for salvation and her
[7:18] garments are clean through the washing
[7:20] of regeneration and renewing of the Holy
[7:22] Ghost one man did not have this wedding
[7:25] garment on so he could not be part of
[7:27] the Rapture the wedding and and he was
[7:29] cast out into outer darkness which
[7:32] represents the tribulation
[7:34] period we can clearly see that both the
[7:37] oil and the wedding garment represent
[7:39] the filling or baptism of the Holy Ghost
[7:41] experience Jesus taught us to receive if
[7:45] you've been baptized with the Holy Ghost
[7:47] you will be ready for the Rapture of the
[7:49] Bride of Jesus Christ and escape the
[7:52] tribulation in the Rapture you will meet
[7:54] Jesus in the air with the Saints who
[7:56] have gone on before us and then quickly
[7:58] go to the marriage supper of the Lamb so
[8:01] will we ever be with our
[8:03] [Music]
[8:08] Lord now that we can see what God's
[8:10] message of the hour is what are message
[8:13] Believers doing right now as stated
[8:16] earlier Believers are being washed and
[8:18] made ready by the preaching and
[8:20] receiving of Jesus's words Believers are
[8:23] also finishing the Great Commission that
[8:25] Jesus spoke of in Matthew 28 19 and 20
[8:30] go ye therefore and teach All Nations
[8:32] baptizing them in the name of the father
[8:34] and of the son and of the Holy Ghost
[8:37] teaching them to observe all things
[8:40] whatsoever I have commanded you and lo I
[8:42] Am With You Always even unto the end of
[8:45] the world
[8:47] Amen message Believers are also sending
[8:50] missionaries to take the message of the
[8:52] hour to All Nations once the message of
[8:55] the hour is preached in all nations then
[8:57] we know Jesus will return according to
[9:00] Matthew
[9:02] 24:14 and this Gospel of the Kingdom
[9:04] shall be preached in all the world for a
[9:06] witness unto all nations and then shall
[9:09] the End
[9:10] come Revelation 10 gives us a vivid
[9:13] picture of this completion of the Great
[9:16] Commission Jesus Christ is the mighty
[9:18] Angel who comes down with an open book
[9:21] this book symbolizes the Bible and all
[9:23] its Mysteries which are now open and
[9:25] revealed by the seventh angel or
[9:27] messenger our responsibility in this
[9:30] hour is like John in Revelation 10: 8-1
[9:34] we are to take the open book and eat the
[9:37] contents the truths of the Bible which
[9:39] will give us the strength and power to
[9:41] take the revelation of the Bible to many
[9:43] peoples and Nations and tongues and
[9:47] Kings we pray you will eat the open book
[9:50] as well by listening to and believing
[9:52] the Bible truce God has restored back to
[9:55] his holy ghost filled New Testament
[9:57] Church the Bride of Jesus
[10:00] Christ we conclude by saying to you the
[10:03] viewer the same words that Philip told
[10:05] Nathaniel after seeing what God was
[10:07] doing on the earth during his generation
