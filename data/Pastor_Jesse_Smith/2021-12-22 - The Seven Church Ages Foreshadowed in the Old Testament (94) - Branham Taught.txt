TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] greetings friends in the mattress name of the lord jesus christ recently the lord revealed to me how the seven new testament church ages are foreshadowed in the old testament here's the outline for this video we'll start with my personal story second we'll look at ages proven by the bible third we'll listen to brother graham's quote about this fourth we'll look at the old testament church ages timeline in comparison with the new testament church ages timeline then we'll look at my understanding of the old testament age messengers and then we'll finish with the three types of the church ages in the old testament here's my personal story about this topic years ago probably 15 years ago i heard brother branham say how the church ages were foreshadowed in the old testament well this was a question i had and i couldn't understand it so i just put it up on the shelf and then last month i was studying and preparing and i felt led to look at this book by a man named kevin j connor called the tabernacle of david here's a picture of it i was reading through the book and then i saw conor's timeline for old testament revivals from the days of solomon to the days of john the baptist i felt through that picture the lord helped me understand that the ages of the israeli kings of the old testament were foreshadowing the new testament church ages so i thank the lord that as we wait upon him he dissolves all our doubts and answers all of our questions bible proof for ages friends many people that have left the bible-based message of brother branham who i call accusers of brother branham have claimed there are no such thing as church ages this is a very shallow and weak statement on pages 411 and 412 in my 2021 book i address the subject is the term church ages biblically acceptable yes paul twice says the old testament had ages in ephesians 3 verse 5 and colossians 1 26 so it's apparent the 2000 year new testament time period has ages as well the apostle paul speaks of future ages beyond his in ephesians 3 21 unto him be glory in the church by jesus christ throughout all ages world without end if there are past and future ages there must always be ages ephesians 3 5 says which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men of course paul speaking of the old testament ages as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the holy spirit of course paul is talking about how the gospel going to the gentiles was not made known during the previous ages of the old testament in colossians 1 verse 26 paul says the doctrine of the baptism of the holy ghost was not known in previous ages or old testament ages even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations but is now made manifest to his saints skipping ahead to verse 27 which is christ in you the hope of glory so see friends it is undeniable the old testament had ages the new testament has ages and there will be ages all throughout eternity brother branham's quote about old testament church ages let's listen to brother ram's quote from 1954 the seal of god and you'll see as he wonderfully identifies that solomon's age was the beginning of the old testament church ages it begins with the church of edison then the second church eighth the third church age the fourth church age the fifteen hundred years of dark ages out through the lutheran age philadelphia age and down into the latest dna the light thing seeing in the old testament how they were perfectly typed at the beginning of silence all down to at the time of ahab the dark age and found out as jesse bell ahead a borderline preacher or a man who was on and off just like a lot of lukewarm church members today people on and off in the church today tomorrow get them anywhere compromising letting down going with the world yet calling himself christians and ahab and that condition fell for a beautiful little woman so wicked is all get out and later and brought idolatry into israel right in the darkest irons of israel dark now we find out that they come out of there with a blast standing on out and finally lukewarm down to god spewed him from his mouth and accepted the gentiles now we find out that he start off from the first in the ephesians church in the beginning of the church age the next turkeys begin to cool off and get lukewarm went on in and the dark age and just as as that day ahab marrying of idolater jezebel and brought idolatry into israel then protestantism marriage romanism catholicism and brought our dollar dreams of church come out to martin luther down to john wesley over into pentecost and out in from god's mouth and god points back to the jews again [Music] comparing timelines now friends let's look at brother branham's timeline for the new testament church ages which it seems he got a lot of the dates from clarence larkin as he said he got his dates from historians and let's compare it to kevin j connor's timeline for the old testament church ages from the time of solomon to john the baptist so here's the picture i saw in conor's book on page 148 he identifies solomon as the first age jehoshaphat as the second amos chapter 9 as the third hezekiah as the fourth josiah's age as the fifth ezra's age as the sixth and nehemiah's as the seventh notice that last age lasted until the early church in 46 a.d so here's a comparison of the old testament ages with the new testament ages on the bottom of course you can see the church ages that brother branham identified through the help of the holy spirit and clarence larkin it's important to keep in mind that the old testament ages lasted only a thousand years and the new testament church ages have lasted double about two thousand years it's also notable how the last ages are shorter as well note how both the new testament old testament ages had one age that was much longer than the others so in the new testament we know it's the thyroid church age which was about 914 years almost a millennium brother branham called it satan's millennium in the old testament ages it's likely the sixth age was the longest age which would have been ezra's age all the way up to the time of john the baptist my understanding of the messengers as i studied this subject i saw a great correlation between four of the old testament messengers and four of the new testament messengers here's a visual so you can see what i'm referring to i can see a great correlation between paul and solomon you'll see with the second third fourth sixth and seventh old testament messengers i did not agree with our christian brother kevin j connor but i believe the second messenger was likely jehoshaphat i agree with him there i thought the third was probably usia and after studying the scripture i thought hezekiah was the fourth i believe josiah can be proven was the fifth ezra could be proven as the sixth and i believe john the baptist would be proven as the last old testament messenger i'll briefly go through the reasons why i think these four men from the old testament foreshadowed the four messengers from the new testament and i'll leave a link in the description if you want to listen to the complete sermons on this subject i think i preached three or four sermons on this topic paul and solomon had very strong similarities for example both men were master builders one in the natural solomon building the temple and one in the spiritual as paul said in first corinthians 3 verse 10 according to the grace of god which is given unto me as a wise master builder i have laid the foundation and another buildeth thereon but let every man take heed how he buildeth thereon also both men solomon and paul wrote the inspired word of god paul wrote numerous epistles for us and solomon wrote numerous books of the bible for us both ages were warned to return to their first love god warned solomon not to fall away from his first love but we know he did at the beginning of his life solomon had one love in song of solomon 6 verse 9 he said my dove my undefiled is but one but then later we know he left his first love and had many wives first kings 11 verse 4 said for it came to pass when solomon was old that his wives turned away his heart after other gods and we also know in 1st kings 11 verse 3 solomon went from one love to one thousand loves having a thousand wives and concubines so solomon started on fire but he left his first love and we know the ephesian church age according to the words of jesus left their first love but by god's grace he gave them a way back remember repent and do the first works next both ages had the candlestick removed from their cities historically the candlestick was removed out of ephesus as the prophet teaches us in the church age book and the candlestick was removed from the nation of israel eventually as well so i truly believe this old testament age typed the ephesian church age in the second age with iranians and jehoshaphat i do not see as many major obvious types and shadows as the first age but i'll keep an open heart and perhaps the lord will show us a different messenger but i did see how both men had gifts of the spirit operating and both men sought the lord and condemned idolatry history said iranians had all the gifts of the spirit through his teaching in france's churches and resisted the idolatry of false roman bishops and he also had the true godhead teaching jehoshaphat had peace prosperity and supernatural deliverance through the gift of prophecy and through the removal of idolatry and seeking the lord in the third church age again it's like the previous age or the second age i don't see major similarities i only see minor so i'm hoping the lord will reveal more about this age later but i do see some similarities both ages show decline martin was a trinitarian but a tremendous man of god uzziah didn't reach the peace and prosperity of jehoshaphat according to the scripture also both men were builders martin built schools and sent out godly holy ghost-filled men and usia built engines and towers to keep israel strong and safe and protected also both men were famous for their good deeds in the fourth church age columba and hezekiah it's like the other previous two ages the second third i don't see many major similarities only minor so i could be wrong on this the similarities i saw were both men were known as the most godly men columba was compared to jesus disciples according to brother branham and hezekiah was honored above all other kings outside of david and solomon colombo was a powerful missionary likened unto jesus apostles he preserved the written word making the reformation possible his college sustained evangelism for over 700 years hezekiah led a great reformation he restored the altar the temple and worship after the wicked ahaz he destroyed the brass serpent he had a miraculous personal healing but sadly at the end of his life he was deceived by babylonian ambassadors and had a post-mature death in the fifth church age i see a very strong type between luther and josiah i see major similarities here such as first both men majored on justification or the passover the passover would represent justification because there was three feasts right in a row passover unleavened bread and first fruits so justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost and josiah had a major passover celebration just like martin luther majored on justification second kings 23 verses 21 and 22 say how there was not hold in such a passover from the days of the judges that judged israel nor in all the days of the kings of israel nor of the kings of judah next both men brought their generations out of spiritual darkness through the revelations of the written word we know martin luther helped bring the church out of the dark ages through his revelations on justification and many other topics he wrote many tracks which raised the faith of the people that day and set the spiritual captives free and he also translated the bible so he placed the written word back in the hands of the people josiah did the same in second kings 22 verse 8 the book of the law was found in the house of the lord it was given to shaphan and he read it to josiah josiah hears it he rents his clothes and god recognizes his humble tender heart and his tears and then he read the law to the people and restored the covenant so luther brought the restored word out of spiritual darkness and josiah brought the written word out of natural darkness into the light and third both men reform the true church martin luther is the most famous of the reformation ministers and again josiah reformed the church by restoring the law the covenant and the feasts in the sixth age i again see major similarities here i believe this is a true type with john wesley and ezra as the messengers to the age their similarities are both men preached or read the word in the open air format both men brought sanctification back to the people both men were thoroughly trained and prepared for their ministries both men enjoyed a god ordained open door of ministry with little resistance from the enemy and government and lastly the seventh age i see very strong similarities here between brother william branham and the church ages and john the baptist in the old testament and of course the major similarity is that they both had the spirit of elijah and prepared the way of the lord please see my five part video series that show william branham was the messenger of this day one of those videos shows how brother branham had the same elijah characteristics as john the baptist and elijah both men turned the hearts of believers john turned the hearts of the fathers to the children according to luke 1 17 and brother branham turned the hearts of the children to the apostolic fathers as he restored all things according to matthew 17 verse 11 and he turned the hearts of the children back to the fathers according to malachi chapter 4 verses 5 and 6. the three types in the old testament of the new testament church ages the first type friends is moses's golden candlesticks the menorah was a type of the gentile church ages we know this because in revelation chapter 1 jesus stands in the midst of the candlesticks and then he tells us these candlesticks are the seven gentile cities ephesus smyrna pergamos thyratira sardis philadelphia and laodicea and the bible also says these are the times of the gentiles the book of acts says paul and barnabas left the jews to go to the gentiles to take a people out for his name's sake in other words god was getting a gentile bride ready to be married to his son jesus christ and this wedding takes place in the air at the rapture the wedding ceremony takes place in heaven at the marriage supper of the lamb and the honeymoon is the one thousand year millennium on the earth as detailed in revelation chapter 20. the second type is joshua's seven chapter book the holy spirit revealed this type to my brother simon as he was studying and preparing meditating on the church age book in joshua 18 there are seven remaining tribes that had not possessed their land so before joshua died he sent out men to go investigate the land describe it and bring it back and write it in a book through those seven descriptions of the land joshua divides the land to the remaining seven tribes it's a beautiful type of how the prophet had a written book about seven tribes before he passed in order for them to possess the promises of god for their lives that's exactly what happened in brother branham's day brother branham had to finish the seven church age book right before he passed away in order for the people to understand the seven church ages to see how the previous six ages had possessed their promises and how the seventh age needed to possess the promises before the return of jesus christ and the third type of course is the kings of the old testament which this video is all about in closing friends i hope this video has been an encouragement to you it's really encouraged me that the lord was able to answer a question i had that i left on the shelf for many years it proves that as jesus said the holy ghost will lead and guide you into all truth although i still have a question on three of the messengers i can clearly see how four of them are directly related to the new testament church ages and what a blessing that is we're trusting as time goes on if the lord tarries the lord will reveal more and more about his word we'll become more established in the faith we become more sure of our faith more established in the faith and fall more in love with jesus christ in his word if you have any questions concerns or testimonies about this video please contact me god bless you and may jesus christ be the desire of your heart [Music]
