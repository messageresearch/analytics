[0:02] Revelation chapter 1
[0:07] the themes are the supreme deity of
[0:10] Jesus Christ and the Sevenfold glory of
[0:13] Christ on the Lord's Day
[0:16] the supreme deity of Jesus Christ is
[0:18] seen through his own words and the words
[0:21] John uses to describe him Alpha Omega
[0:24] the beginning in the end the Almighty
[0:26] the first in the last and the one with
[0:30] the keys of hell and of death Jesus is
[0:33] not a second person in the Godhead for
[0:35] the Bible never teaches that false
[0:37] doctrine
[0:37] Jesus is supreme deity the Express image
[0:41] or exact reproduction of the one person
[0:44] of God thus the supreme deity of our
[0:48] Lord Jesus Christ is the greatest of all
[0:50] revelations for a person cannot be
[0:52] justified or declared righteous and
[0:55] forgiven of their sins in the sight of
[0:57] God without first repenting and being
[1:00] buried in water and calling upon the
[1:02] name of God the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:05] according to acts 2 verse 38 then Peter
[1:09] said unto them repent and be baptized
[1:11] every one of you in the name of Jesus
[1:13] Christ for the remission of sins and ye
[1:16] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:20] the Sevenfold glory of Jesus Christ is
[1:23] seen in verses 12 through 16 as John
[1:26] gives us a physical description of the
[1:29] appearance of Christ when he physically
[1:31] returns to judge the world at the end of
[1:34] the Tribulation Period first his head in
[1:37] his hairs were white like wool as white
[1:39] as snow
[1:40] this means Christ is the one universal
[1:43] judge of all men who is crowned with
[1:45] experience maturity and wisdom has also
[1:49] seen in the final judgment the great
[1:51] white throne judgment of Daniel 7 verses
[1:54] 9 to 14 and revelation 20 verses 11
[1:57] through 15 second his eyes was a flame
[2:01] of fire
[2:02] this means Christ is now an angry judge
[2:05] seeing and rebuking the hard hearts
[2:07] according to isaiah 66:15 and first
[2:11] Peter 3 verse 12 third his feet like
[2:15] unto fine brass as if burned in a
[2:17] furnace this means Christ will carry out
[2:20] the divine wrath of Almighty God and
[2:23] crush all of his enemies for he himself
[2:26] took upon himself the wrath of God on
[2:29] the cross of Calvary as brass represents
[2:32] the divine judgment of God upon an
[2:34] innocent sacrifice a corner numbers 21 9
[2:38] and second King 16 verses 14 and 15
[2:43] forth his voice as the sound of many
[2:46] waters
[2:46] this means Christ's voice in judgment
[2:49] will include a multitude of voices and
[2:52] witnesses of all the true believers who
[2:55] will be witnesses against all the
[2:56] unbelievers who did not take warning
[2:59] from Christians who witnessed to them
[3:02] fifth the seven stars in his right hand
[3:05] this means the seven stars who were
[3:07] called seven angels were human
[3:10] messengers or preachers that would be
[3:12] safe in the hand of Christ and also have
[3:15] lives that were full of the power of God
[3:17] with signs wonders and miracles sixth a
[3:21] sharp two-edged sword out of his mouth
[3:24] this means the words Christ speaks will
[3:27] discern the thoughts and intents of
[3:28] every heart revealing every seeker of
[3:31] every heart while issuing judge
[3:33] it's upon those who did not do the will
[3:36] of God seventh his countenance as the
[3:40] Sun shineth in its strength
[3:42] this means the countenance face or
[3:45] presence of Christ will shine with
[3:47] divine righteousness as a holy light and
[3:49] will damned those who had pleasure in
[3:51] unrighteousness and believed lies
[3:56] the timing of events in this chapter
[3:58] deal with only one event the Lord's Day
[4:01] mentioned in verses 7 and 10
[4:04] but Lord's Day is the future day when
[4:07] Jesus physically returns to the earth
[4:09] when the days of men ruling the world
[4:11] are over and when the judgments of God
[4:14] begin to fall during the tribulation
[4:16] period the Lord's Day is when mercy is
[4:18] over and every eye of every sinful
[4:21] guilty soul will wail in fear of Jesus
[4:25] Christ Israel will also see Christ their
[4:28] Messiah return in mercy to the 144,000
[4:32] believing Jews the symbols and key
[4:37] revelations include the seven stars the
[4:40] seven candlesticks kings and priests and
[4:43] the phrase the testimony of Jesus Christ
[4:46] and the Word of God Jesus defines the
[4:50] stars and candlesticks himself telling
[4:53] us that the stars are the seven angels
[4:55] of the seven churches and the seven
[4:57] candlesticks represent the seven
[4:59] churches these seven angels are actually
[5:02] human messengers that lived upon the
[5:04] earth and shine the light of Christ to
[5:06] their age
[5:09] the seven candlesticks are the seven
[5:11] churches of the seven Gentile cities
[5:14] listed in chapters 2 & 3
[5:16] showing that each person in each age
[5:18] must burn brightly with the light of the
[5:20] Holy Ghost during their time on earth
[5:22] the fact that none of these seven
[5:25] churches are Jewish churches and all
[5:27] seven are Gentile cities proves that
[5:30] Jesus's words spoken to the seven
[5:32] churches in chapters 2 and 3 are
[5:34] prophetic and foretell what would happen
[5:37] during the Gentile dispensation as Jesus
[5:40] taught in Luke 21 verse 24 scripture
[5:43] teaches that God blinded the eyes of the
[5:45] Jews from seeing Christ as their Messiah
[5:48] in Romans 11:25 in order that God might
[5:51] call out a people for his name meaning
[5:54] Christ would call himself a Gentile
[5:56] group of believers to be his bride or
[5:58] wife
[6:02] kings and priests are the current dual
[6:05] offices of every Holy Ghost field
[6:07] Christian every Christian is a spiritual
[6:10] king who reigns in this life by the
[6:12] power of God over sin the flesh the
[6:16] world and the devil every Christian is
[6:19] also a spiritual priest offering the
[6:21] continual sacrifices of praises and
[6:24] thanksgiving from their lips along with
[6:26] faithful intercessory prayers for all
[6:29] men the phrase the testimony of Jesus
[6:34] Christ refers to New Testament believers
[6:37] who recognize Christ as the promised
[6:39] Messiah and Savior the phrase the word
[6:43] of God represents those who believe in
[6:45] the infallibility of the Old Testament
[6:48] notice that John had both the testimony
[6:50] of Jesus Christ and believe the Old
[6:53] Testament or the Word of God these
[6:55] phrases will be important to remember in
[6:57] chapter 6 in 12
