TRANSCRIPT
========================================
chapter 9 the mystery of babylon the great chapter 9 contains footnotes numbers 1454 to 1601 and upon her forehead was a name written mystery babylon the great the mother of harlots and abominations of the earth revelation 17 verse 5. by this point you know the true church's identity and her attributes as jesus's bride additionally the sixteen revelations of the kingdom of heaven further differentiate the true church from the false with this solid scriptural foundation you'll easily recognize the false church's identity the wisdom requirement the book of revelation teaches one requirement to identify the false church wisdom revelation 17 verse 9 says the mind which hath wisdom recognizes that mystery babylon the false church sits on seven mountains which is one of the eleven clues as to her identity god made the false church's identity extremely obvious even identifiable geographically by its seven mountains so that eternal life with him would be freely available to any and all who desire his love a second mention of the wisdom requirement comes from revelation 13 verse 18 telling us that wisdom counts the number of the beast 666 in order to avoid taking his mark god's compassionate heart allows everyone a chance to be saved for he makes wisdom easily accessible james 1 verse 5 explains how easily saying if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of god that give it to all men liberally and upbraideth not and it shall be given him in the greek liberally means simply openly frankly sincerely all god requires in exchange for his wisdom needed to recognize the false church and the beast's number is an honest selfless prayer requesting wisdom with the right motive few people ever pray in honest prayer because their intentions when praying are selfish motivated by lusts james explains that most prayers are not answered because they are asked with lustful intent jesus said few would find salvation meaning few would have wisdom freely offered through a sincere prayer to escape the false church destined for the mark of the beast consider the past and current global scale of selfish lustful prayers our heavenly father turns down billions of selfish prayers from around the globe because of their evil nature as the false church has deceived all nations the importance of godly wisdom can hardly be over emphasized solomon says wisdom is the principle thing therefore get wisdom and with all thy getting get understanding if you do not have the wisdom of god humbly bow your head in prayer and ask god for his divine wisdom at this moment before going forward in this chapter pray for more than a minute set your face to heaven praying until you feel god's presence surrounding you granting you the assurance that his wisdom is on the way the confusion about mystery babylon the confusion about mystery babylon centers around her identity is she for she is called a woman in revelation 17 verse 6 a real woman yet to rule in the future or merely a symbolic figure of all false religions city kingdom government empire or church the revelation of mystery babylon is her identity as the false mother church the roman catholic church and her daughters are protestant churches who partake in her iniquities please understand this revelation is not a personal attack on roman catholics but rather a desperate loving call for god's people inside the corrupt catholic system to come out that they be not partakers of the church's sins this chapter details 11 proofs that witness beyond a shadow of a doubt that the roman catholic church willingly upholds doctrines of devils abuses its power and makes merchandise of souls of men for self-gain no other church city kingdom or woman can even come close to meeting all 11 requirements something jerusalem is mystery babylon due to scripture's repeated references to her as a harlot but the holy city fails to meet a few scriptural requirements first jerusalem does not sit upon many waters as taught in revelation 17 verse 1. waters represent many peoples multitudes nations and tongues jerusalem's influence upon many nations is small in comparison to rome there are only around 11 million jews and about 82 percent live in israel and the united states the 11 million jews pale in comparison to the world's 1.3 billion catholics second jerusalem is never called babylon in scripture whereas peter refers to rome as babylon in 1st peter 5 13. rome is also the legs of iron or modern babylon-like kingdom vividly described in daniel chapter 2. third revelation 18 verse 3 requires mystery babylon to have strong relationships to the kings of the earth and ties with all nations but israel is despised by many nations and often suffers from bias and discrimination at the united nations on the other hand the vatican has diplomats to nearly every nation finally mystery babylon is condemned in revelation 18 verse 21 with prophecy that she will never be found or rebuilt after god's wrath destroys her mystery babylon has an expiration date roman the vatican will be destroyed jerusalem is promised a rebuilding a peaceful habitation and future kingdom in isaiah 2 verses 2 through 4 jeremiah 3 verse 17 and isaiah 65 verses 17-22 jesus will set up his millennial throne in jerusalem and all nations will gather there to worship and learn the law of god while the wolf and lamb peacefully feed together if you accept god's revelation of rome as mystery babylon you are among a large group of believers who have understood rome's place in scripture church fathers lactantius tertullian irenaeus and jerome taught this along with reformers martin luther john knox john calvin william tyndale and john wycliffe god has liberally granted his wisdom to many protestants that they might escape the false mother church rome and her daughter churches this chapter labors on rome's sins but i am by no means an expert on her rank rebellion and insatiable iniquity recommended reads include the two babylons by alexander hislop 1858 and 50 years in the church of rome by charles chinekui 1885. biblical proof for the revelation of mystery babylon revelation chapter 17 and 18 are the main texts that reveal mystery babylon's identity as the roman catholic church but additional bible books prove this statement beyond doubt proof number one the catholic church is a woman revelation 17 verse 3 describes mystery babylon as a woman chapter 4 showed how a woman symbolizes a church in scripture and is easily seen through two examples the people of israel and the new testament church referred to as the bride or wife of christ israel is called the church in the wilderness in acts 7 verse 38 and is likened unto a woman in many cases such as ezekiel 16 god calls israel harlot unto him israel's sister samaria has also been involved in abominations and whoredoms just as israel had john describes israel as a woman with a crown of twelve stars representing the twelve tribes of israel christ made of the seed of david is the man child who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron who was caught up unto god and to his throne the second example of a woman symbolizing a church is the new testament church referred to as the bride or wife of christ ephesians 5 verses 22 through 33 shows paul's teaching that a husband is to represent christ and a wife is to represent the new testament church in john 3 verse 29 john the baptist labels jesus christ as the bridegroom and his followers as the bride just as israel and the bride of jesus christ are symbolized as women so is the roman catholic church symbolized as the abominable woman of revelation 17. proof number two the catholic church is the modern day babylon revelation 17 verse 5 says this evil woman has babylon written upon her forehead babylon is first mentioned in genesis chapters 10 and 11 where we witness the origins of spiritual confusion at the tower of babel this group wanted to reach heaven by man-made memes while establishing a name for themselves god stopped their building by confounding their language the roman church is the modern babel because it promotes a false man-made path to heaven contrary to scripture in response to this failed religious system god has permitted confusing doctrine to deceive this church salvation is made confusing through catholic dogma which falsely adds a works requirement for salvation which one apologists calls an arduous process catholicism mandates an unscriptural post-death trip to purgatory just as original babel sought to exalt its own name roma also exalts its own name the holy see and mary's name mother of god far above the name of jesus christ further proof that the catholic church is babylon can be found in daniel chapter 2. in a dream nebuchadnezzar saw a great image and his babylonian kingdom was the head of gold babylon the literal kingdom fell to the medes and persians in daniel 5 28 who represented the great images silver breast and arms historically the grecian empire led by alexander the great was the next kingdom represented by the belly and thighs of brass the ancient roman empire followed the grecian and therefore was the legs of iron because the final earthly kingdom represented in the dream is rome mystery babylon must represent the roman power note carefully that rome is the final kingdom proven by the fact that only the second coming of jesus christ to earth symbolized as the stone cut out of the mountain that struck the image's feet can end rome's reign the first coming of christ did not end the roman empire more support is provided by daniel's description that the kingdom of christ will spread around the whole world or fill the whole earth when he the stone returns to end the roman reign christianity does not fill the whole earth at this moment for most governments ascribe to no official religion which church or woman is closely associated with the city of rome only the roman catholic church has this distinction you may be wondering how rome can still be ruling today since the roman empire fell in the 5th century revelation 13 verses 11 and 12 holds the answer for the beast or evil spirits motivating the roman empire that used to be ruling in babylon the medes and persians and grecians gained a new lease on life by migrating into the papacy the evil spirits of rome now rule through a global ecclesiastical influence rather than through military power the catholic church becomes the modern babylon because she is empowered by the same evil spirits but as a different appearance a church rather than an empire in addition to these bible witnesses we have a final prophetic witness that roman religion reigns until christ returns at armageddon william branham a prophet of god spoke with thus saith the lord that romanism would rule the world until jesus returns in march of 1962 branham said listen it's on tape now to the world i speak or wherever these tapes may go and to you people here no matter whatever happens to me you believe this russia communism isn't conquering nothing god's word can't fail romanism is going to conquer the world jesus christ was born into the roman kingdom and persecuted his first time come here by the roman kingdom and on his second advent coming now his message is persecuted by the roman denominations which is the mother of all of them and when he returns he will come back to wipe out that roman kingdom that the jews has always looked for him to come and wipe out the roman kingdom the catholic hierarchy with all the denominations in the world right now coming together as an organization the confederation of churches organizing themselves together it isn't russia it's rome thus saith the lord proof number three the catholic church is the mother of harlots like jezebel mystery babylon is called a mother in revelation 17 verse 5 clearly representing she is the original or first church of her kind the roman catholic church is the first human organized man-led church god is not leading this mother of harlots the roman church unashamedly claims to be the mother church the church from which every church took its start specifically she is the mother of limiting the holy one of israel by her tradition-based worship jesus says unscriptural traditions make god's word of none effect ultimately producing vain worship rather than contending for the apostolic gospel her greatest efforts have been in publicly crucifying the effects of the holy ghost to god's people through idolatrous practices see proof number six the true church of the living god never denominated or organized like the catholic church did the roman church is not the original holy ghost filled book of acts church the mother title of the immoral mother church implies that she has daughters or children jesus identifies the mother and daughter harlots in revelation 2 verses 20 through 24 calling the mother church jezebel as he pronounces judgment against both jezebel and her children jezebel clearly represents a church first women symbolize churches second she calls herself a prophetess claiming authority third she has doctrines plunging her into the depths of satan the mother jezebel is a fitting comparison for the roman church as both she and catholicism are linked to sexual immorality death and idolatry see figure 24 athaliah jezebel's daughter had a murderous evil spirit just as her mother ezekiel 16 verse 44 states this proverb plainly as is the mother so is her daughter figure 24 jezebel's sexual immorality is found in second kings 9 22 and revelation 2 verse 20. the roman catholic church's sexual morality is found by the clergy and none sex abuse epidemic jezebel's love for death is found in first kings chapters 18 and 21. the roman catholic church's love for death is seen through their papal wars and the inquisition period jezebel's idolatry is seen in first kings 18 verse 19 revelation 2 verse 20. the roman catholic church's idolatry is seen through their veneration of images and statues if the roman church is the mother of harlots who are the daughter harlots the daughters are all denominational and non-denominational churches that mimic the mother church these daughters behave exactly like their mother substituting traditional creeds for the true word while overlooking and legalizing sin a common thread binding the mother and daughters is the three-person polytheistic false teaching of the trinity their unity in false doctrine tritheism causes the daughter churches to justify their mother's evils failing to speak out against her past and current crimes against god proverbs 17 verse 15 says he that justifieth the wicked and he that condemneth the just even they both are abomination to the lord any church denying scripture while siding with and supporting the mother church is manifesting her daughterhood to the mother notice also the roman catholic church is the immoral mother church because she received the wrong seed or teaching god's word is likened unto seed in luke 8 11. the seed is the word of god but this mother church denies god's word and takes satan's lies or seed chapter 10 shows how the first mother eve also received the wrong seed by believing satan's lies proof number four the catholic church sits on many waters revelation 17 verse 1 and 15 describe the many waters on which the mystery babylon sits as people multitudes nations and tongues recent data shows how the catholic church sits on or has influence upon many peoples multitudes nations and tongues nearly 1.3 billion people are professing catholics 18 of the world's population nearly 222 000 parishes worldwide parishes in nearly every country on the earth nearly every nation has either diplomatic or other political relations with the holy see the number of catholics is greater than that of nearly all other religious traditions there are more roman catholics than all other christians combined and more roman catholics than all buddhists or hindus the world's two largest protestant churches are the anglican and methodists but they're estimated sizes of 80 million members respectively falls far below catholicism's 1.3 billion members anglicans and methodists do not claim to be mother christian churches as the roman church does only the catholic church sits upon many waters proof number five the catholic church sits on seven mountains or hills along with sitting on many waters revelation 17 verse 9 says mystery babylon also sits upon seven mountains as well as sitting on many waters mountains can also be interpreted as hills in the greek lexicon the city of rome which is home of the vatican is famous for having seven hills on which the ancient city of rome was built while the vatican is not built among these seven hills it's a mere five miles from the ancient hills some say that the seven mountains reference could refer to a different location such as istanbul turkey it is true istanbul has seven hills the religious majority in istanbul are muslim the second largest religion in the world but istanbul is certainly not the headquarters or mother city of islam which distinction goes to mecca istanbul is not mystery babylon because it does not meet the other ten requirements needed to be considered mystery babylon proof number six the catholic church is a harlot or to christ revelation 17 verses 1 15 and 16 call mystery babylon a great or both terms originate from the same greek word porne and can be defined as one who yields herself to defilement for the sake of gain another meaning literally says pornei is babylon i.e rome the chief seed of idolatry observe the harlots two gray evils defilement for gain and idolatry the catholic church is a defiled to christ the husband because she claims to be the true church or wife of christ but is not faithful to his word romans 7 verse 4 says the true church that is married to christ will not add to or take away from her husband's word according to revelation 22 verses 18 and 19 believers are clean only through jesus's word as he spoke in john 15 3 saying now ye are clean through the word which i have spoken unto you sadly this defiled unfaithful roman church receives and spreads false teachings against her professed husband christ the word for monetary gain like a harlot catholicism has received the wrong seed or false teachings of satan and shared those lies with peoples from nearly every nation revelation 17 verse 2 and revelation 18 verse 3 says she commits fornication with the kings and nations of the earth by pleasing governments and people rather than pleasing her professed husband christ for example during the pope's september 2015 visit to the united states his address to congress called for unity cooperation and peace but never mentioned the nearly 700 000 abortions or murders committed in clinics nationwide during that calendar year nor did he mention the nearly 54 million legal abortions committed since 1973. abortion is murder also called an abomination to god in deuteronomy 12 31 if god heard innocent abel's blood cry to him from the ground would he not also hear the 54 million voices cry to him in his heavenly temple if the pope was a true man of god he would have rebuked america and cried out against her for these senseless cold-hearted murders rather than praising her and emphasizing climate change needs above the sanctity of life instead like a wolf in sheep's clothing he was welcomed by the masses with a fanfare of trumpets and a course of amends because he's a tickler of the ears a false prophet and a lover of pleasure more than a lover of god here's a very brief list of some of the seed or false doctrine the mother harlot has received from evil spirits then shared and spread all over the world with kings nations multitudes and peoples mandatory clerical celibacy the roman church forces all priests to be celibate which contradicts the bible truth that even peter was married whom they claimed to be the first pope the bible plainly teaches that jesus healed peter's mother-in-law in matthew 8 verses 14 and 15. paul the celibate prophet of god also taught that peter was married in 1st corinthians 9 verse 5. the apostle paul also wrote in first timothy 4 verses 1 through 3 that seducing spirits and doctrines of devils teach that marriage should be forbidden undoubtedly the worldwide clergy sex abuse epidemic is one result of this false teaching if paul's advice for believers to marry rather than burn with desire in first corinthians 7 verse 9 was obeyed there'd certainly be less abuse transubstantiation this false doctrine teaches that the bread and wine in the eucharist are changed in substance but not appearance into the literal body and blood of jesus catholics claim the eucharist becomes christ's real presence that is his body and blood this lie establishes idolatry the harlot's second great evil exalting common bread and wine into deity paul calls the wine a symbolic cup of blessing not a cup of liquid deity another proof the bread is not divine is paul's teaching that one can eat the bread unworthily reaping guilt and damnation upon himself divine bread eaten would instantly and eternally make the consumer divine but that is clearly not taught in holy writ paul also says we do not know jesus after the flesh anymore instead we know him by his holy spirit being the seal of god in our hearts or souls the pope office and its holy father title the bible never created the office of a pope which means father in latin the new testament preaching officers are apostle prophet teacher pastor and evangelist paul never ordains a pope office jesus christ thought we should call no man father in matthew 23 verse 9. the apostle paul never requested anyone call him father even though he gave charges to believers as a father doth his children said elder should be entreated as fathers described his relationship with timothy was as a son with the father and claimed the corinthians were begotten to christ through the gospel which paul preached the pope is commonly called holy father which is absolute heresy and man worship because the only time the title holy father is used in the bible is when jesus prayed to his father god almighty and called him holy father in john 17 verse 11. the pope is receiving worship and being called a title that was meant for god himself alone breaking the first commandment kissing a pope's ring or priest's hand and bowing to a pope or priest it is common to see people kissing the pope's right hand and even bowing to him as worshipers have been doing for centuries the bible teaches that we are not to bow to any man worship or kiss any man's hand this man worship breaks the first commandment veneration of statues and images the catechism of the catholic church states that the seventh ecumenical council at nicaea in 787 justified the veneration of images of christ the mother of god angels and all the saints while this council may have justified veneration the bible never did nevertheless catholics worldwide bow down to kiss rub and weep on images further exalting them in a way that god never commanded towards any image or man-made statue all these acts of veneration break the first commandment about having no other gods and making no graven image unto any likeness that is in heaven on earth or in the water idolatry is the second great evil as she is the chief global seed of idolatry spread through the worship of statues and images communion of the saints catholicism teaches that there can be an exchange of spiritual goods through prayers between the disciples currently on earth and those that are in glory catholics are to pray for the dead that they might be loose from their sins but the bible says jesus blood already forgives you all trespasses the catechism encourages believers to fly to marry the mother of god in prayer and request prayer from her nowhere in scripture does jesus teach christians to pray to and for believers who have already died and left the earth praying to anyone other than god is a form of spiritualism and should not be taught nor observed for if the heavenly saints of god are not being contacted it would mean that evil spirits are being contacted by those misguided prayers deifying the virgin mary the idolatrous practice of worshiping mary the mother of jesus runs deep in catholicism for mary is called the all-holy one and was supposedly preserved free from all stain of original sin hebrews 4 verse 15 and romans 3 23 plainly teach that jesus is the only person who never sinned and the rest of humanity has sinned and fallen short of god's glory mary was not all holy for she was a sinner saved by grace and rejoiced in god her savior in luke 1 verse 47. in revelation 5 verses 1 through 5 jesus only not mary was found worthy to open the book and loose the seven seals additionally catholics exalt mary above god ascribing to her a saving office and the title's mother of god queen over all things advocate helper benefactors and mediatrix isaiah 43 verse 11 proclaims god is the only savior not mary the truth is that god the eternal spirit has no mother and mary was only mother to jesus's human mortal body jesus is the only mediator between god and men and our only advocate proof number seven the catholic church uses the scarlet and purple apparel revelation 17 verse 4 says the mother harlot is arrayed in purple and scarlet it is common to see priests archbishops and the pope frequently arrayed in these colors during annual festivals holy days and seasons of the church year you can do a google image search with the words pope scarlet purple and see hundreds of images of past and present popes priests bishops and archbishops adorning these distinctive colors proof number eight the catholic church is wealthy it's also clear from revelation 17 verse 4 that mystery babylon is a wealthy church as she is decked with gold and precious stones and pearls having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication the vatican receives free will donations from more than 1 billion catholics worldwide and has over 8 billion in assets vatican city also earns interest on its financial investments and has flocks of tourists and visitors for its museums galleries and libraries which hold their priceless collections the mass services of the roman church showcase golden cups and instruments with precious stones just as revelation 17 verse 4 foretold proof number nine the catholic church is drunken with the blood of the saints revelation 17 verse 6 says mystery babylon is drunken with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the martyrs of jesus is it possible that the catholic church is responsible for the death of millions of true christians history demonstrates that there was much corruption in the roman church and potpourri during the roman empire and middle ages protestant historians recorded medieval roman church practices in the most negative terms and recall the massive corruption of catholic church leaders including adulteries bribes extravagant papal art and architecture projects and most destructive wars of conquest samuel schmucker author of the glorious reformation details the horrifying tyranny and persecution by the catholic church during the middle ages he estimates the roman church was responsible for the deaths of nearly 68 million christians who dissented from her teachings this massive slaughter was possible through the catholic inquisition and crusades against heretics which are undeniable historical examples of the roman church being drunken with the blood of the saints revelation 18 verse 24 traces all the slain back to catholicism and in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints and of all that were slain upon the earth proof number 10 the catholic church's headquarters is a great city revelation 17 verse 18 says mystery babylon is that great city which reigneth over the kings of the earth the vatican is certainly a great city for this city-state is the epitome of church and state located on the west bank of the tiber river the vatican is the world's smallest fully independent nation-state it operates tax-free and has its own telephone system post office gardens astronomical observatory radio station banking system and pharmacy as well as a contingent of swiss guards responsible for the personal safety of the pope since 1506. history validates how the vatican has reigned over the kings of the earth particularly in europe beginning in the 5th century reaching its height of power during the middle ages then starting its decline in the 19th century napoleon bonaparte famously symbolized the vatican's decline in power when he snatched the french crown from the pope's hands to crown himself at his coronation rather than bowing to him in 1804 previously the holy see exercised power over europe's kings and monarchs recent popes have had shrinking political legacies rather than being major players in world politics like popes from the middle ages still vatican influence has flexed its muscle at times as pope john paul ii is credited with influencing kings or rulers of the earth by helping to end the cold war according to former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev former polish senator andres sichipiroski said pope john paul's pontificate was responsible for the downfall of communistic rule worldwide no church other than the catholic church can claim to be a great city and have influence politically and spiritually over the earth's leaders like vatican city proof number 11 the catholic church rides the beast the spirit of ancient rome revelation 17 verse 3 explains mystery babylon is to sit upon a scarlet colored beast full of names of blasphemy having seven heads and ten horns by examining each of these descriptions you can fully recognize that the catholic church sits on or rides upon the spirit of ancient rome scarlet was covered in proof number seven in bible symbolism a beast represents a human kingdom as taught in daniel 7 verse 23 the fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom upon the earth daniel chapter 7 lists only four kingdoms upon the earth until the second coming of jesus christ to the earth this time the kingdoms are symbolized as animals rather than as sections of a man like in nebuchadnezzar's dream in daniel chapter 2. proof number 2 details these kingdoms babylon is the lion the medes and persians are the bear the grecians are the leopard and rome is the dreadful and terrible beast with great iron teeth though this beast or ancient roman empire fell in the 5th century it had already gained new spiritual authority through emperor constantine in the 4th century when constantine changed the empire's capital from rome to constantinople in 330 rome's civil authority was weakened but its spiritual authority was strengthened the title supreme priest pontifex maximus which had been the prerogative of the emperor now devolved upon the pope constantine's move was a fulfillment of john's prophecy in revelation 13 verses 1-3 for this beast was wounded to death but his deadly wound was healed the ancient roman empire died or fell in the fifth century but the spirit of rome and its evil influence lived on through the roman catholic church observe that this one beast out of the sea is a combination of the four beasts mentioned in daniel 7 like a leopard grecians feet of a bear medes and persians mouth of a lion babylon and ten horns rome all the violent evil demons who inhabited each ancient kingdom never died they have only changed their dwelling places living now in the catholic system the power the roman church rides upon comes from evil spirits revelation 18 verse 2 validates this truth for mystery babylon is the habitation of devils and the hold of every foul spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird just as each ancient kingdom sought world dominance so the roman church seeks global influence and religious dominance writing the demonic beastly power that divides and conquers all nations peoples multitudes and tongues triple blasphemy revelation 13 verse 6 says and he opened his mouth and blasphemy against god to blaspheme his name and his tabernacle and then the dwell in heaven the beast or spirit of rome blasphemes god in three ways his name tabernacle and the saints that dwell in heaven the spirit of roman catholicism blasphemes god's name the lord jesus christ by substituting it with holy trinity and with the titles father son and holy ghost mass services and catholic wedding ceremonies issue prayers and blessings in the name of the father son and holy spirit rather than using the name of jesus christ in holy writ the father son and holy spirit titles were never used in worship or in blessing colossians 3 verse 17 commands us to do all things whether in word or deed in the name of the lord jesus christ ephesians 3 verse 15 and philippians 2 verses 9 through 11 teach that the name of jesus christ is the name above all names that the entire family of god in heaven and earth is named the lord jesus christ the roman church does not hollow god's revealed name the lord jesus christ as jesus taught us in his model prayer hallowed be thy name god's heavenly tabernacle is blasphemed because rome calls itself the eternal city and decks the vatican with priceless artwork gold and precious valuables of incalculable measure rome is not eternal for her plagues come in one day and she will be judged in one hour because strong is a lord god who judgeth her the new jerusalem vividly described in revelation chapters 21 and 22 is the true and only eternal city that is coming to earth from heaven and god not man is its builder and maker rome has blasting the saints that dwell in heaven through the practice of communion of saints or the teaching that men should pray to the saints rather than to god himself first timothy 2 verse 5 says jesus christ is the only mediator between god and man and christ never taught anyone to pray to mary or any other believer any true believer whether alive or dead would instantly reject any prayers sacrifice or worship directed to themselves just as paul and barnabas did in acts 14 verses 1 through 18. after god healed a through paul's divinely given words at lystra the natives were preparing to make sacrifices to paul and barnabas but these wise apostles were able to talk them out of their idolatry our lesson is that human beings are never honored with sacrifices prayers or worship for these expressions are reserved for god alone the mark of the beast since the catholic church rides the beast or spirit of rome you can now understand the mark of the beast revelation 13 verses 16 through 18 says and he causeth all both small and great rich and poor free and bond to receive a mark in their right hand or in their foreheads and that no man might buy or sell save he that hath the mark or the name of the beast or the number of his name here is wisdom let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast for it is the number of a man and his number is 600 threescore and six god's spiritual mark for his children is the baptism of the holy ghost upon the christian soul paul and john call god's spiritual mark a seal while most people think satan's mark will be a computer chip tattoo or other physical mark scripture teaches the opposite as the beast mark is also a spiritual mark an unbeliever receives after rejecting god's mark while the mark of the beast movement may culminate with the implantation of a computer chip during the great tribulation the mark itself begins as a rebellious stubborn and prideful human spirit both marks god's seal mark and satan's beast mark are spiritual marks that can be received today god's mark the seal of the baptism of the holy ghost is received spiritually when a christian fully obeys god's requirements for the new birth acts 5 32 said god gives the holy ghost to them that obey him obedience always requires sacrifice for the new birth christians must sacrifice their own will fully dying out to their selfish desires chapter 5 explains how christians die out or crucify the following sins unbelief hypocrisy reasonings sensuality impatience irreverence selfishness and resistance satan's spiritual mark is received when unbelievers reject god's seal by disobeying his path to the baptism of the holy ghost cain is the first pre-figure of someone receiving the mark of the beast not only did cain know god's perfect will animal sacrifice from god himself but he also told him he could rule over his sin nature if he simply obeyed cain like his father that wicked one blatantly rejected god's word and soon murdered his brother it seems god gave cain a physical mark so that other men would not kill him as he wasted his life wandering like a fugitive and vagabond genesis shows the beginning of both marks as cain was the first marked and immediately left the presence of god true believers are marked by constant worship dwelling in god's presence as seth's example proves in genesis 4 verse 26 and to seth to him also there was born a son and he called his name enos then began men to call upon the name of the lord unbelievers after cain did not receive a physical mark but instead took a spiritual mark for rejecting god's path to salvation these wicked evil cane-like rejecters of god's love are termed as reprobate in jeremiah 6 30. romans 1 verse 28 2 timothy 3 verse 8 and titus 1 verse 16. in the greek lexicon reprobate means not standing the test not approved unfit for unproved spurious according to romans 1 verses 28 through 32 god gives a person over to a reprobate mind who continually refuses his love refusing to retain his word in his mind while having pleasure in committing wicked abominable acts because god's love is so great his eyes run to and fro throughout the whole earth seeking each soul and offering salvation the father is always seeking true worshipers according to john 4 23 there will be no excuses for the reprobates who reject god's continual offer of love on the day of judgment because god has revealed his power and godhead to every person through his creation and the human body rejection is the key word for understanding the mark of the beast god desires almond to be saved but few there be that will find it meaning most will reject his gracious offer god foreshadowed the mark of the beast in the old testament with another physical mark called an awl or permanent hearing given to jewish slaves who purposely rejected freedom and wanted to remain slaves forever jewish slaves served six years but in the seventh year they could go free exodus 21 6 and deuteronomy 15 17 detail this mark for slaves who rejected their god-given inheritance which included all the blessings of the land of their forefathers today unbelievers show their spiritual ears are marked with satan's mark when they reject the good news of the gospel offering them freedom from sin through the holy spirit they choose to love sin and remain a slave to it rather than ruling over it like cain should have done believers submit to god's spirit and live righteously and godly in this present world the mark in the right hand or forehead according to revelation 13 verse 17 buying and selling during the great tribulation will only be accomplished through one of three ways the mark or the name of the beast or the number of his name first the mark of the beast can be in the right hand or the forehead the right hand mark symbolizes one who has promised or made an oath of allegiance to do the works of the beast under the guise of peace and safety in this case the right hand mark may be called the right hand of falsehood and means that all people including church members will have to do the will of the one world church system hands can represent works as god promised to bless obedient israel in all the works of thine hands simple submission in obedience to the will of the antichrist for the sake of financial gain will cause people to take his mark the mark in the forehead means the beast followers will boldly and unashamedly accept the false doctrines of the world church system which includes trinitarianism universalism and other doctrines not found in scripture the forehead protects the area of brain known as the frontal lobe where decisions are made speech is formed and reasoning occurs it is fitting that god represents the forehead a persuaded made up mind as a hard stone such as flint god told ezekiel that he would make his forehead strong against their the house of israel foreheads sinners foreheads have minds unashamed of committing evil while god promised to mark the foreheads of believers who sighed and cried against all the abominations done in jerusalem as a sign they would be delivered from destruction both god followers and beast followers have marked foreheads and each person must choose the mark he will receive the mark of his name the second means of buying and selling that will take place in the great tribulation is through the name of the beast revelation 14 verse 11 teaches sinners will receive the mark of his name the name of the beast has two applications because there is one name for the person of the antichrist the beast figurehead while the beast or spirit of rome is full of names of blasphemy the antichrist name is the name of one man as taught in revelation 13 verses 17 and 18 which says the number of his name it is the number of a man what is the name of the man who will be the antichrist it is the vicar of christ the blasphemous title given to the pope of rome who is said to have full supreme and universal power over the whole church a power which he can always exercise unhindered vicar means substitute originating from the latin word vicarius consider the other official names the pope has given bishop of rome vicar of jesus christ successor of the prince of the apostles supreme pontiff of the universal church patriarch of the west primate of italy metropolitan archbishop of the province of rome sovereign of the state of vatican city servant of the servants of god submitting to the name of the antichrist the roman vicar of jesus christ is equal to receiving the mark of the beast the beast or roman spirit is full of names of blasphemy according to revelation 17 verse 3. what are the beasts many names of blasphemy they are the different names of so-called christian churches all claiming to be true churches for there are thousands of religious denominations existing within the united states and undoubtedly thousands more worldwide muse on this for a moment thousands of different names catholic luther methodist baptism presbyterian to name just a few all claiming to be genuine churches of jesus christ without the power and character of true christianity most church members cuss blasphemy enjoy social drinking drunkenness watch sinful tv shows and movies lusts commit sexual sins fornication and adultery and justify themselves above others pride both peter and paul condemn all of these sins and more stating that christians are free from these sins and that they were committed before a person's conversion to christ in time past of our life just for an example imagine the blasphemy of a church of christ member enjoying a routine pleasure-filled sin-filled weekend on friday night he goes to a sports bar with the guys leaving his wife and children at home to enjoy a basketball game while getting drunk gossiping complaining and cursing players coaches and fans alike perhaps he flirts with another man's wife and gets her phone number in anticipation of a future affair on saturday after wasting the morning hours watching his favorite sinful netflix shows he takes his wife and children to the mall to purchase immodest sexually suggestive swimwear for their upcoming vacation to make the children happy he purchases the newest violent provocative and graphic video games they finish the night going out to eat before catching a movie that exposes them to murders blasphemies sexual morality lusts and lashes due to their exhaustion from the sin-filled weekend the family sleeps in and skips church on sunday but will spend the rest of the day preparing to host their super bowl party it's plain to see that this church of christ member and his family spent their entire weekend blasting the very name they claim to represent jesus christ if i call this man a catholic instead which means a member of the universal church then he just blasphemed jesus's true universal church the wife or bride of christ please remember that i am not attacking the people inside these churches but the antichrist spirit that is guiding their systems because their church bylaws creeds and leaders allow this type of blasphemous behavior the countless church members who live this way are fulfilling jesus's denunciation in revelation 3 verse 1. i know thy works that thou hast a name that thou livest and are dead unconverted sin loving church members have church names they live or confess church of god church of christ etc but are spiritually dead the beast is full of these blasphemous names and these church joiners know nothing of christ's power to make them new creatures therefore if any man be in christ he's a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new clinging to one of these thousands of blasphemous names by church joining and rejecting the new creature born again experience is essentially receiving the mark of the beast thus saith the lord on the mark of the beast it's imperative to share that god sent a prophet named william branham see chapter 13 to provide god's warning in revelation regarding the mark of the beast having rejected god's mark the baptism of the holy ghost the beast's followers will join rome's evil worldwide economical move through accepting the mark in one of three ways in the forehead or hand accepting the name of the beast or accepting the number of his name the three succeeding statements about the mark of the beast are available to read and listen to online at no cost the holy ghost inspired branham to share these statements while stamping each with thus saith the lord god's authoritative phrase signaling his divine will on may 4th 1954 branham preached without the seal of god which is the baptism of the holy ghost confederation of apostasy is the mark of the beast that's thus saith the lord on january 19 1964 branham announced i know it's unpopular to speak against organization but that's the mark of the beast that's the thing that's carrying us right into that it's making an image under the beast i don't say that for to be angry i say that because it's the truth brethren the day will come when phoenix will raise up maybe i'm going on but you'll know that that was thus saith the lord on august 23 1964 branham said thus saith the lord that same thing unionization will take place in religion you belong to denomination of some sort or you cannot buy or sell the number of the beast's name the third and final way by buying and selling will take place during the great tribulation is through the number of the beast the name of the beast has a number for is the number of a man 666 many have guessed as to what the number 666 represents but there's one clear answer in revelation since the beast is the spirit of rome the single man who is the head of the roman spirit seeking to unite all people under his leadership can be none other than the pope of the roman catholic church how does the pope's name equal 666 the title vicarius philae dei or vicar of gods in latin has been associated to the pope's office for centuries when the title vicarius file day is added up using roman numerals the sum is 666 as seen in figure 25. note that u and v were used interchangeably until the middle ages while some contest the validity of the title vicarious file day saying its earliest appearance is found in a forgery it is incontestable that the catechism of the catholic church exalts the pope's office as vicar of christ even to this day vicar translates to vicarius in latin add to this fact the eleven proofs of rome is mystery babylon and it seems very probable that the pope at some point in the past held the title vicarius fellaini day vicar of god's as it is nearly synonymous to his current title vicar of christ the image of the beast revelation 13 verses 14 and 15 unveils the beast's plan for humanity to make an image to the beast which had the wound by a sword and did live since the beast or spirit of rome is invisible it seeks an image for itself which is a worldwide economical council these organized churches will get together in a union with the roman catholic church it seems likely that the world council of churches will be the main component of this worldwide image unto the beast as this organization represents nearly 500 million christians and literally seeks visible unity or an image for christians this council is a false unity for any union without union upon true doctrine is erroneous the world council of churches has member churches who hold false doctrines that allow homosexuality adultery and lasciviousness just to name a few these churches do not have unity like jesus unity with the father for jesus always did those things that please the father the world counsels churches allow sins that displease and grieve the heavenly father jesus did pray for christian unity in john 17 verse 11 that they may be one as we are the bible teaches true unity only comes through adherence to the one faith john states christians should have no unity with teachers of false doctrine saying whosoever transgresseth and abideth not in the doctrine of christ hath not god he that abideth in the doctrine of christ he hath both the father and the son if there come any unto you and bring not this doctrine receive him not into your house neither bid him god speed for he that bideth him godspeed is partaker of his evil deeds all churches who reject true bible doctrine and join the world council of churches in a false unity manifest that they are true daughters of the mother harlot the roman catholic church the image of the beast or world council of churches will play a major role in the future great tribulation helping lay down the mark of the beast revelation 13 verse 15 says the beast gives life unto the image of the beast that the image of the beast should both speak and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed the ecumenical move will become so strong politically that governments will enact laws forcing all churches to come under dominion of the world council which is under rome's dominion great pressure to join will be placed upon everyone for this unionized church and state system controls finances and will have power to kill anyone who descends the false prophet or person of the antichrist revelation 19 verse 20 and chapter 20 verse 10 describe the judgment of a false prophet who is closely connected to the beast or spirit of rome a prophet is one who speaks for god who is this false prophet who claims to speak for god but teaches false doctrine and is closely connected to rome he can be none other than the pope of rome the catholic catechism teaches that the pope has the authority of christ and has an infallibility in virtue of his office when he teaches on matters of faith and morals yet the pope and his church are filled with false doctrine making his office the false prophet connected to the beast or roman spirit one of those false doctrines was assigning the title holy father to the pope a title given only to the heavenly father by jesus in john 17 11. any pope who accepts his title shows his completely blind spiritual condition for he is robbing god of his sacred distinguished title a modern example showing the pope is a false prophet is the assumption of mary dogma from 1950. pope pius xii announced mary the mother of jesus was taken assumed into heaven body and soul following the end of her life on earth there is absolutely no historical or new testament proof for this claim as it seeks only to further exalt and deify mary instead it remains a false doctrine from the false prophet another common name for the false prophet is the antichrist or the person who will rule deceive and influence the entire world during the great tribulation 2 thessalonians 2 verses 3 through 13 is a detailed description of him and his blasphemous actions he's called the man of sin he's called the son of perdition he's called that wicked in jerusalem's future rebuilt temple he opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called god or that is worshipped so that he is god sitteth in the temple of god showing himself that he is god his coming is after the working of satan with all power and signs and lying wonders just as the false prophet is said to work miracles in revelation 19 verse 20. he deceives with unrighteousness and lies allowing his followers to live in the pleasures of sin those who overcome him will be believers and lovers of truth another prophetic book daniel provides more support and evidence about the false prophet or antichrist pope's future plans daniel 8 verses 23-25 is a compound prophecy fulfilled first by antiochus iv from 175 to 164 bc and has a future fulfillment in the false prophet pope for he shall also stand up against the prince of princes jesus christ the antichrist pope will have political policy to cause financial craft to prosper magnifying himself in his heart all nations will support the false prophet pope because of his successful political and financial solutions daniel 9 verse 27 states he the antichrist pope will make a one week or seven year covenant with many but will break it after three and a half years in the midst of the week causing orthodox jews to cease offering their animal sacrifices and oblations in their newly built temple this three and a half year period in the great tribulation is the same period israel's two anointed witnesses or prophets are prophesying and manifesting god's power according to revelation 11 verses 2 and 3. daniel 11 verses 21 through 31 is another compound prophecy fulfilled by antiochus iv but with a future fulfillment in the antichrist pope the vile person or antichrist pope will make a peaceful league or covenant with israel through deceit and flatteries his deceitful heart will be against the holy covenant and he will pollute the newly built israeli sanctuary by taking away the daily sacrifice daniel 11 verses 36 through 45 is prophecy solely about the antichrist pope see the connection to 2 thessalonians 2 verse 4 as the pope will speak against god exalting and magnifying himself above everyone and everything you learn the antichrist pope will enter into the glorious land jerusalem and try to set up his own tabernacle in the glorious holy mountain god will let him swiftly come to his end though and none shall help him catholicism in the united states have you ever wondered if the united states a world superpower is mentioned in the bible god's spirit has foretold the prophetic description of the united states in revelation chapter 13. but did you notice that there are two beasts in revelation 13 the first is the beast out of the sea and the second is the beast coming up out of the earth the latter is the united states you've already learned the beast out of the sea is the spirit of ancient rome empowered by the same demonic forces that exercise worldwide dominion in the kingdoms of the babylonians medes and persians and ancient grecians ancient rome received a deadly wound when the roman empire fell but was healed when it gained spiritual authority through constantine in the roman catholic church the second beast in revelation 13 verses 11 through 18 is called the beast coming up out of the earth who exercises all the power of the first beast or beast out of the sea the power of the roman spirit will be exercised by the second beast or united states compare briefly the similarities between ancient rome and the united states's world dominance largest economies strongest militaries most influential politics most advanced technologies freedom and variety and cultural expressions and religious tolerance examining the five symbols of the second beast will prove it is indeed the spirit of rome in the united states first the second beast rides out of the earth and not the sea like the first beast since the sea or waters represent multitudes of people earth represents a place with a smaller human population north america second this beast has two horns which symbolize america's civil and ecclesiastical powers horns represent power in scripture as jeremiah 48 details moab's fall from great military power as the lord prophesies her horn would be cut off third it is like a lamb a young country just as a lamb as a young sheep but it does not have to be a lamp since scripture says like a lamb it is the american buffalo selected as the national mammal of the united states in 2016. fourth america speaks as a dragon meaning it makes phenomenal claims and warnings in front of the united nations in september 2018 president donald trump boasted america's military will soon be more powerful than it ever has been before for decades presidents have often issued warnings to rogue regimes such as the soviet union iran saudi arabia and north korea finally revelation 13 verse 13 says the united states does great wonders that he maketh fire come down from heaven on earth in the sight of men this prophecy was fulfilled in august 1945 when america dropped atomic bombs on hiroshima and nagasaki in an attempt to spare american lives and end world war ii history and scripture detail the spirit of rome rising in the united states colonial america began as a protestant movement to pursue religious freedom and a more abundant life indeed the pilgrim fathers part of the separatist movement that rejected the church of england's roman catholic-like governmental institutionalism came to north america to escape the church of england's religious persecution and founded plymouth massachusetts in 1620. for early americans catholicism though tolerated was their religious enemy and remained so for nearly 300 years even during john f kennedy's 1960 presidential campaign he had to overcome a widespread conviction that no roman catholic candidate could be elected president narrowly winning the presidency kennedy rose above the religious taboo against roman catholics through his style glamour and wit pledging his belief of the separation of church and state to protestant ministers during a televised speech in houston texas the book of daniel reveals how catholicism slowly but effectively gained acceptance and prominence in the once protestant strong america daniel 2 verses 40 through 43 describes the fourth kingdom or roman spirit which began as the ancient roman empire but was given a new life and appearance in the roman catholic church daniel says the roman spirit breaks and subdues all things like iron but its feet and toes are part iron and clay making the end of the roman rule partly strong and partly broken if iron is catholicism then clay is protestantism and daniel says they never truly mix with one another but daniel 2 verse 43 says the mixed iron and clay in the image's feet represents the two substances mingling themselves with the seed of men the devil's plan has been to control both catholic and protestant churches pitting each against the other in a proselytizing battle unconverted catholics and protestants have been mingling themselves with the seed of men or marrying other unconverted people spreading their corrupt religion by way of family tradition rather than by true spiritual experience today's unconverted catholics and protestants are the modern pharisees as jesus says in matthew 15 they draw nigh to god with their mouths and honor him with their lips but their hearts are far from god truly they worship god in vain teaching for doctrine the commandments of men catholicism gradually became accepted in the united states through mixed marriages of separate beliefs in which one spouse was catholic and the other was not generation after generation of catholics took marriage vows according to the catholic code of canon law promising to remove dangers of defecting from the faith while promising to do all in his or her power so that all offspring are baptized and brought up in the catholic church herein was fulfilled daniel's vision of the iron kingdom rome mingling with the seed of men and pledging to make all offspring roman catholic mystery babylon has slowly conquered the world through mixed marriages and unbelieving children who propagate their tradition-based dogma centered man inspired and dead religion to succeeding generations mixing unbelief among believers has always been satan's most effective tactic the devil knows he can most easily corrupt people's spiritual lives by polluting their daily actions and habits in their homes satan delights in destroying families in the garden of eden he divided and conquered the first family adam and eve by beguiling eve with his lies and misinterpretation of god's word in genesis 6 verses 1 through 3 god was grieved when the sons of god or godly lineage of seth married the worldly daughters of men or unbelieving women of cain's lineage solely based upon their beauty instead of their religious convictions marrying outside the faith caused spiritual degradation in solomon's reign and in the lives of disobedient jews in the days of ezra nehemiah the apostle paul warns christians are not to be unequally yoked or have intimate fellowship with unbelievers and details how corrupt teachers aim to infiltrate homes of spiritually weak people in order to lead them astray john agrees warning christians to refuse false teachers access to their house or from asking god's blessing upon their works the rewards for receiving the revelation of mystery babylon all those who receive the revelation of mystery babylon are first able to recognize the mother of false religion and escape her blasphemies abominations idolatries and spiritualism by rejecting mystery babylon true christians gain the reward of recognizing the true church the body of christ and see themselves as members in particular of this body perhaps the greatest reward is understanding who your true mother is the new jerusalem this glorious truth is found in galatians 4 verse 26 which states that the new jerusalem or the jerusalem which is above is the mother of us all in the greek mother means motherland so which is your native country rome or heaven is mystery babylon your mother or the new jerusalem as a genuine believer in jesus christ heaven is your home for ephesians 1 verse 4 says you were chosen in him before the foundation of the world you literally came from heaven because you came from god's mind heaven has always been your motherland in john 14 verses 1 through 3 jesus promised you when he left this earth he was going to prepare a place for you so you could be with him forever jesus is just about finished preparing the new jerusalem for you and the entire body of christ paul says you are seeking those things which are above and have set your affection on things above your motherland when you die or at the body change of the rapture you will return to your mother heaven the new jerusalem your future dwelling place with christ your husband is your motherland the final rewards are the current spiritual benefits you receive after accepting god's wisdom about the false church mystery babylon this chapter began with god's truths about wisdom being necessary for recognizing mystery babylon and because you prayed and asked god for wisdom the benefits are seven fold james 3 verses 17 and 18 declares all seven saying but the wisdom that is from above is first pure then peaceable gentle and easy to be entreated full of mercy and good fruits without partiality without hypocrisy and the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace through god's wisdom your character is pure peaceable gentle compliant merciful fruitful impartial and sincere the consequences for rejecting the revelation of mystery babylon rejecting the revelation of mystery babylon as the catholic church justifies the mother harlot proverbs 17 verse 15 reads he that justified the wicked and he that condemneth the just even they both are abomination to the lord catholicism's blasphemies abominations idolatries and spiritualism cannot be forgiven because she will not repent heaven will not forget her sins revelation 18 verse 5 states for her sins have reached into heaven and god hath remembered her iniquities the next chapter exposes her iniquity loving characteristics by not speaking against and leaving the mother harlot and her daughters rejecters of this revelation will be guilty of partaking in her sins while babylon followers are alive they will suffer the consequences of remaining in the mother harlot antichrist system members may be able to attend their spiritually dead churches but they will be unable to escape demonic influences being tormented by the multitudes of unclean spirits present in their gatherings revelation 18 verse 2 declares that catholicism the mother church with daughter churches is a habitation of devils and the hold of every foul spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird the fatal final future consequences of rejecting this revelation include taking the mark of the beast in your forehead or right hand bowing to his name or accepting the number of his name all those who take the mark of the beast will be cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone according to revelation 19 verse 20 this tragic conclusion of rejecting this revelation will be separation from the one true god being judged in the lake of fire conclusion our gracious and loving god freely offers his wisdom to all mankind that they might recognize both the true and false church the book of revelation provides a clear view of these two churches the pure blood washed wife of jesus christ versus the vile seductive named mystery babylon the great the mother of harlots and abominations of the earth all evidence suggests the catholic church is mystery babylon the 11 scriptural proofs the mark of the beast the name and number of the beast the false prophet pope thus saith the lord from the prophet william branham and the rise of catholicism in the united states revelation 18 verses 4 and 5 says the holy spirit is issuing a final call to god's people saying come out of her mystery babylon my people that you be not partakers of her sins and that you receive not of her plagues for her sins have reached unto heaven and god hath remembered her iniquities if you're a catholic and one of god's people please come out of catholicism and into the true church of jesus christ if you're trapped in a dead protestant church a daughter church of the mother church come out and let the holy ghost lead you to jesus church the choice is up to you as to which church you want to be a part of but jesus church cannot be joined for christ says you must be born into it ye must be born again unconverted catholic and protestant churches can be joined with membership classes vows and first communions but the true church is buried by baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ and born again of his holy ghost action steps to come out of babylon step one if you're a roman catholic or member of a denomination or non-denominational church holding catholic dogma i.e the trinity respectfully and graciously leave your home church and relocate to a new home church that believes the full gospel of jesus christ contact me if you need help finding a bible believing church step 2 if possible thank your former priest or pastor for his support when you leave his church it's likely you would have not reached your current spiritual state without his help you may want to share with him why you're leaving his church based upon the bible based truths in this book be gentle and speak the truth in love contact me for a free copy if you feel like to share this book with him step three as a new member in your home church faithfully and diligently stand at your post of duty supporting the church with tithes prayers attendance and service let christ's fivefold preaching ministry of ephesians 4 verses 8 through 16 bring you to a mature state of godliness or perfection
