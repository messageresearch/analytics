[0:00] [Music]
[0:06] greetings friends in the mattress name
[0:09] of the lord jesus christ the purpose of
[0:11] this video is to answer a viewer's two
[0:13] questions
[0:14] about water baptism the first is
[0:17] does water baptism save you and the
[0:20] second is
[0:21] can you get the holy ghost baptism
[0:24] before you're baptized in water
[0:27] here's the answers according to
[0:29] scripture first does water baptism save
[0:32] you
[0:33] the answer is no the act of being
[0:36] baptized in water
[0:37] does not save you we've all known people
[0:39] that have been baptized but then have
[0:41] fallen away from the faith
[0:43] you're saved by grace through faith
[0:46] according to ephesians 2 verses
[0:48] 8 through 10 for by grace are ye saved
[0:51] through faith
[0:52] and that not of yourselves it is the
[0:54] gift of god
[0:55] not of works lest any man should boast
[0:58] for we are his workmanship
[1:00] created in christ jesus unto good works
[1:03] which god hath before
[1:04] ordained that we should walk in them
[1:09] this means you are saved when you repent
[1:11] of your sins
[1:12] and believe in faith jesus died for your
[1:15] sins
[1:16] and you trust jesus's righteousness to
[1:19] save you
[1:20] you're saved at that moment but after a
[1:23] person is saved
[1:25] he or she will gladly be baptized if
[1:27] given the opportunity
[1:29] here's jesus saying those who already
[1:31] believe
[1:32] meaning they have already repented and
[1:35] loved him and his work on the cross
[1:38] will obey and be baptized in water in
[1:41] mark 16
[1:42] 16. he that believeth and is baptized
[1:45] shall be saved
[1:46] but he that believeth not shall be
[1:48] damned
[1:50] a second proof that the act of being
[1:52] baptized doesn't save
[1:54] is jesus's saving grace to the repentant
[1:57] thief on the cross matthew chapter 27
[2:01] verses 41
[2:02] to 47 show how this condemned thief
[2:06] was mocking jesus with the chief priests
[2:09] scribes elders and the lost thief
[2:13] likewise also the chief priests mocking
[2:15] him with the scribes and the elders said
[2:17] he saved others
[2:18] himself he cannot save if he be the king
[2:21] of israel let him now come down from the
[2:23] cross
[2:24] and we will believe him he trusted in
[2:27] god let him deliver him now
[2:29] if he will have him for he said i am the
[2:31] son of god
[2:33] and notice verse 44 the thieves also
[2:36] which were crucified with him
[2:38] cast the same in his teeth
[2:41] see both thieves were mocking jesus
[2:44] but the holy spirit must have come to
[2:46] him and he realized jesus's innocence
[2:50] the saved thief must have repented for
[2:52] he began standing up for jesus
[2:54] and judged him as righteous
[2:58] this is found in luke 23 verses 39
[3:01] to 43. the saved
[3:04] thief said thus thou not fear god seeing
[3:07] thou art in the same condemnation
[3:09] and we indeed justly for we receive the
[3:12] dew reward of our deeds but this man
[3:14] hath done nothing amiss
[3:17] and he said unto jesus lord remember me
[3:19] when thou comest into thy kingdom
[3:22] and jesus said unto him verily i say
[3:24] unto you today
[3:25] shalt thou be with me in paradise
[3:31] you learn from the scripture that jesus
[3:34] saved this repentant thief
[3:36] promising him eternal life to be with
[3:39] jesus in paradise
[3:40] and yet he was never baptized since you
[3:43] know hebrews 13 verse 8
[3:45] jesus christ is the same yesterday today
[3:48] and forever
[3:49] you know god has always and will always
[3:52] save by grace
[3:53] through faith the repentant thief was
[3:56] saved by grace
[3:57] through his faith in christ and would
[3:59] have been baptized
[4:00] if he had had the chance this saved
[4:03] thief was one of the last persons saved
[4:05] under the old testament
[4:07] for when jesus died he said it is
[4:09] finished
[4:10] the old testament was finished the veil
[4:12] covering of the holiest of holies was
[4:14] torn
[4:15] and the new testament began in the new
[4:18] testament
[4:19] god was going to use his holy spirit to
[4:20] lead men into the presence of god
[4:23] now called the baptism of the holy ghost
[4:26] rather than the physical room
[4:27] of the holiest of holies the unchanging
[4:31] god
[4:31] still saves by grace through faith in
[4:34] the new testament
[4:37] question number two can you get the holy
[4:40] ghost baptism before you're baptized
[4:42] in water according to the bible the
[4:45] answer is yes
[4:46] you can be baptized with the holy ghost
[4:48] before you're baptized in water
[4:51] cornelius and his house experienced this
[4:53] in acts chapter 10.
[4:55] the whole chapter is needed to
[4:57] understand this truth
[4:58] but verses 44-48 states specifically
[5:02] that the holy ghost fell upon corneas
[5:04] house while peter spoke to them
[5:07] and then peter commanded them to get
[5:08] baptized in water
[5:10] and they obeyed so we learn these truths
[5:14] first the holy ghost can fill the souls
[5:16] of believers who are unaware of god's
[5:18] desire for them
[5:19] to be baptized in water corneos and his
[5:22] house were either unaware
[5:24] of jesus's request for water baptism or
[5:26] were unable to find a preacher to
[5:28] baptize them in water
[5:31] second a person who is truly baptized
[5:33] with the holy ghost and born again
[5:35] will gladly obey all the word
[5:38] these newly born again saints didn't
[5:40] refuse to obey
[5:42] part of the bible commands no they
[5:44] gladly obeyed
[5:46] and so will all those who are truly born
[5:48] again
[5:49] if this is confusing please view my
[5:51] two-part series
[5:52] about the three works of grace this will
[5:55] help you understand when a person is
[5:56] ready to be filled with the holy ghost
[5:59] and it details god's three-step
[6:00] cleansing process
[6:02] he uses in order to fill a person's soul
[6:05] it's called justification
[6:07] sanctification and the baptism of the
[6:09] holy ghost
[6:11] here are two quotes from god's prophet
[6:13] brother branham that support these
[6:15] answers on this
[6:18] the bread i video jesus is the bread of
[6:21] life that's true
[6:22] but this is a symbol just like baptism
[6:25] baptism doesn't save you baptism is only
[6:28] a sign that you're witnessing to the
[6:30] congregation that you believe in the
[6:32] death burial and resurrection of jesus
[6:33] christ
[6:35] it doesn't save you water will not save
[6:37] you
[6:38] it's your faith that saves you but
[6:40] baptism is an
[6:41] order and it must be carried out because
[6:44] god can't save be baptized and then
[6:47] turned around said doesn't need to be
[6:48] done he cannot issue
[6:50] taking communion and turn around and say
[6:52] you know neither taking it
[6:53] you've got to do it
[6:56] a preacher if he come here preaching
[6:58] divine healing by laying on hands
[7:00] you'd have to preach that to you out of
[7:02] the word his hands laying home with
[7:04] being more than baptism or anything else
[7:07] you have to have faith if you haven't
[7:09] got faith you just go down a
[7:11] god center and come up a wet one you're
[7:13] still a sinner if your heart hasn't been
[7:15] changed
[7:17] the baptism means nothing just an
[7:19] outward expression that an inward work
[7:21] of grace has been done
[7:23] and no matter how many times preachers
[7:24] lay their hands on you how much they do
[7:26] this
[7:26] it doesn't mean a thing until you really
[7:28] believe it
[7:32] that all soul grace is the truth
[7:37] then why could anyone criticize and say
[7:41] that grace is wrong
[7:44] that we're saved by works we are saved
[7:47] by grace
[7:49] not through faith not by works
[7:53] works shows that you have been saved
[7:57] but what saves you the grace of god
[8:00] grace saves you grace is what god
[8:03] does for you works is what you do for
[8:06] god to show
[8:07] appreciation what god did for you but by
[8:10] grace
[8:11] are you saved
[8:15] not one time did he ever have to wait
[8:18] after that why peter speak these words
[8:21] to the gentiles
[8:22] the holy ghost alone even before there
[8:23] was that time
[8:25] is that right well acts 10 49
[8:34] give us evangelists in the world today
[8:36] not those who persuade and
[8:38] prove and make denominational children
[8:42] god raise yourself up some children
[8:46] have the people are to pray i'm thinking
[8:48] of carne elise's house
[8:50] it never happened to a gentile before
[8:52] but they were fasting and praying
[8:54] and when that man of god that prophet
[8:56] stood there
[8:58] and while he spake these words a holy
[9:00] ghost fell on him that heard the word
[9:04] god grant that kind of a meeting
[9:07] while peter spake these words
[9:11] oh god they were ready they were fasting
[9:14] they were waiting
[9:16] they were sincere they were
[9:22] also concerning water baptism i
[9:24] recommend you watch my video called
[9:26] water baptism in the name of the lord
[9:28] jesus christ
[9:29] so if you haven't been baptized in the
[9:30] literal name of the lord jesus christ
