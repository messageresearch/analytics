[0:00] [Music]
[0:02] greetings friends in the matchless name
[0:04] of the lord jesus christ
[0:06] the purpose of this video is to take a
[0:08] first look
[0:09] at the cover concept of my upcoming book
[0:12] called the 12 new testament mysteries
[0:15] revealed
[0:16] wraps your wisdom for christ's bride
[0:20] hope this video creates some enthusiasm
[0:22] for this upcoming book
[0:24] in order to spread the bible-based
[0:26] message that jesus christ revealed to
[0:28] his prophet
[0:29] william branham this is my second book
[0:32] as i wrote restoring christian modesty
[0:36] god's perfect will for your outward
[0:37] appearance two years ago in
[0:39] 2019 please know my motivation for
[0:43] writing books
[0:44] is not to make money last time i checked
[0:46] i had not made any money on my first
[0:48] book
[0:49] as i have given out about as many copies
[0:52] as i've sold
[0:53] the objective has never been to make
[0:55] money the objective has been to give
[0:58] everyone a chance
[0:59] to hear the message that god revealed to
[1:01] his servant brother branham
[1:03] one policy of our ministry is to make
[1:07] all these resources free if a person
[1:09] cannot afford them
[1:10] just as brother branham held this same
[1:12] policy for his ministry
[1:14] now we don't have nothing to sell well
[1:18] i'll take that back
[1:19] the boys has the books and tapes and the
[1:21] pictures i think and so forth
[1:23] in the back of the building and there i
[1:26] buy those books
[1:28] brother gordon lindsay prints those
[1:30] books and i buy them for 40 cents less
[1:32] than i have to sell them
[1:33] then pay for them to be transferred you
[1:36] know what you make
[1:37] you don't make nothing you lose on them
[1:39] it's the message
[1:40] and the pictures i think they just about
[1:44] expenses to send them is about we don't
[1:46] want to make nothing
[1:48] we brought nothing into this world it's
[1:50] certain we take nothing out
[1:52] what we're trying to do i wouldn't even
[1:54] let those books be there
[1:55] or those things if i didn't think it
[1:57] would help you some way see
[1:59] and i've told the boys if i walk to the
[2:02] bookstand stand around
[2:03] watch a few minutes and see an old dad
[2:05] come up say how much is that book
[2:08] it's uh 50 cents and he'd reach down
[2:10] only got
[2:11] give it to him anyhow let it go see
[2:14] anyone and
[2:15] can't afford it and anything like that
[2:17] some poor person
[2:18] let him have it that's right it'll come
[2:21] some other way somewhere
[2:22] and so it always has and it always will
[2:25] if you just
[2:26] put god first that's all put god first
[2:31] so if you cannot afford these two books
[2:33] then our ministry will be happy to
[2:35] provide you with either
[2:36] a free copy or a free pdf copy
[2:39] also the free audio book will be
[2:41] available online
[2:43] on our website on my personal website
[2:48] www.pastorjessesmith.com
[2:49] and also on my youtube channel pastor
[2:52] jesse smith
[2:53] with that being said here's the picture
[2:56] of the cover concept
[3:02] this book is likely going to be divided
[3:04] into two volumes because right now it's
[3:06] about 840 pages
[3:09] so you can see the book one on the cover
[3:14] the tentative release date is still june
[3:17] 15
[3:18] 2021 but this could be adjusted so i'll
[3:21] keep you posted
[3:22] on the release date my inspiration for
[3:25] this book came from brother branham's
[3:26] sermon
[3:27] is this the sign of the answer preached
[3:30] on december 30th
[3:31] 1962 in this sermon brother branham
[3:35] taught the seventh angel of revelation
[3:37] 10
[3:37] verse 7 was to finish all the mysteries
[3:40] of god
[3:41] and he was the same angel of the
[3:43] laodicean church age
[3:44] from revelation chapter 3 verse 14.
[3:48] in the sermon is this the sign of the
[3:50] answer brother branham quoted
[3:52] c.i scofield who taught in his
[3:54] commentary on matthew 13
[3:56] that there were 11 new testament
[3:58] mysteries and brother branham said
[4:00] the seventh church age messenger would
[4:02] finish all the mysteries of god
[4:04] this inspired me to search the scripture
[4:07] and i read every time the bible
[4:09] used the word mystery in the new
[4:10] testament and i found there were
[4:12] actually 12
[4:13] mysteries so one more than the 11 that
[4:16] scofield had originally written
[4:18] so this inspiration caused me to study
[4:20] these 12 mysteries
[4:22] taking them through the bible and
[4:24] brother branham's quotes
[4:26] and over the last 26 months i've written
[4:28] about 840 pages
[4:30] on this subject so this book will be
[4:32] divided into two volumes
[4:34] the first volume will contain the first
[4:36] six mysteries
[4:38] and the second volume will contain the
[4:40] last six mysteries here are the
[4:42] mysteries so
[4:43] book one will cover the mystery of the
[4:45] godhead from colossians two verse two
[4:48] that will be chapter one chapter two
[4:50] will be the mystery of israel's
[4:52] spiritual blindness from romans 11 verse
[4:54] 25.
[4:56] chapter 3 will be the mystery of the new
[4:58] testament church composed of both jew
[5:00] and gentile
[5:01] from ephesians 3 verses 1 through 11.
[5:05] chapter 4 will be the mystery of the new
[5:06] testament church as the bride of christ
[5:09] from ephesians 5 32.
[5:13] the fifth chapter will be the mystery of
[5:15] godliness restored to man
[5:16] from 1st timothy 3 verse 16.
[5:20] and chapter 6 will finish volume 1 or
[5:24] book 1
[5:25] and it is on the mystery of christ in
[5:27] you according to colossians 1 verse 27.
[5:32] in book 2 or volume 2 chapter 7
[5:35] is the mystery of the seven stars and
[5:37] seven golden candlesticks
[5:39] according to revelation 1 verse 20
[5:42] chapter 8 will be the mystery of the
[5:43] kingdom of heaven
[5:44] according to matthew 13 verse 11
[5:47] chapter 9 will be the mystery of babylon
[5:49] according to revelation 17 verse 5
[5:53] chapter 10 will be the mystery of
[5:54] iniquity according to second
[5:56] thessalonians 2 verse 7
[5:58] chapter 11 will be the mystery of god's
[6:00] will according to ephesians 1 verse 9
[6:05] and chapter 12 will be the mystery of
[6:07] the rapture
[6:08] according to first corinthians 15 51.
[6:15] there will also be an introductory
[6:17] chapter at the beginning of
[6:19] volume one or book one called god's
[6:21] mysteries are for you
[6:23] i'll cover all the scriptures in the
[6:25] bible where it talks about god
[6:27] hiding the mysteries from the wise and
[6:29] prudent but then revealing them
[6:31] unto babes such as would learn and other
[6:33] scriptures that show god reveals his
[6:35] secrets to his friends
[6:37] the ones who love him and keep his
[6:38] commands book 2 or volume 2 ends with
[6:42] chapter 13
[6:43] which is about elijah will restore all
[6:46] things
[6:46] in chapter 13 i detail all the
[6:48] scriptures
[6:49] about brother branham's ministry and how
[6:52] it was to finish the mysteries of god
[6:55] friends it's awesome to see that brother
[6:56] branham stated
[6:58] six of these revelations of the
[7:00] mysteries with thus saith the lord
[7:03] so we can be sure these are the
[7:05] mysteries that had to be finished
[7:07] as revelation 10 verse 7 says and then
[7:10] it's our duty to take these mysteries
[7:12] and their revelations around the world
[7:15] according to revelation 10 verses 8
[7:17] through 11.
[7:19] in closing i hope this video encourages
[7:22] you to study brother branham's sermons
[7:24] and better understand the mysteries of
[7:26] god i also hope it excites you
[7:28] to possibly get a copy of these two
[7:31] books as i believe they'll be a great
[7:33] blessing to you
[7:34] your family and your home church
[7:37] again my motivation is not to make money
[7:40] but to spread the message
[7:41] that god gave to brother branham friends
[7:44] we can rejoice that the secret things of
[7:46] god belong to us
[7:48] and our children as deuteronomy 29 verse
[7:50] 29 says
[7:52] the secret things belong unto the lord
[7:54] our god
[7:55] but those things which are revealed
[7:57] belong unto us and to our children
[7:58] forever
[7:59] that we may do all the words of this law
[8:03] let us rejoice in god's kindness to
[8:06] reveal his truths to
[8:07] us and our children if you have any
[8:10] questions testimonies or comments about
[8:12] this video

[8:19] the desire
[8:20] of your heart
